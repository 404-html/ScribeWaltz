1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.820
Optimal,
minimal.
At this altitude,

2
00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:06.150
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.890
Familiar else move closer.
Question.

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.950
I'm a cybernetic organism.
Living Tissue.
I wouldn't either.

<v 1>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.
I get asked all the time,</v>

6
00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:29.750
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

7
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.660
And my answer is inevitably Athletic Greens,

8
00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:35.150
it is your all in one nutritional insurance.

9
00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:39.560
I recommended it in the four hour body did not get paid for that and I travel

10
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:40.910
with it to avoid getting sick.

11
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.910
I take it in the mornings to ensure optimal performance.

12
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.410
It just covers all my basis.

13
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.400
If I can't get what I need through whole food meals throughout the rest of the

14
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.260
day,
and you can get 50 oh my God,
50% off.
Yes,
50% off.

18
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.840
For me.
It just covers the basis,
takes a load off my mind,

19
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.640
puts a lot in my body and check it out.

this episode is brought to you by 99 designs your one stop shop for all things

00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:24.890
graphic design related.

22
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.920
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers including

23
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.620
sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

24
00:01:33.621 --> 00:01:37.580
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

25
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.820
the brainstorming and a lot of it took place with designers from around the

26
00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:45.020
world.
And here's how it works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,

27
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.530
a website,
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

28
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.280
you submit that project and designers from around the world.

29
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.920
We'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

30
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.580
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

31
00:01:58.581 --> 00:02:00.320
money back.
It's that straight forward.

32
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.010
And many of you who are listening have already used it and created some amazing

33
00:02:04.011 --> 00:02:06.380
things that I'll be sharing it in the future.
But in the meantime,

34
00:02:06.381 --> 00:02:08.150

<v 2>Okay.</v>

38
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.670
<v 1>Hello Ladies and germs.</v>

39
00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:26.630
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

40
00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:31.631
I deconstruct world class performers to tease out and pull out the routines,

41
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:35.300
the habits,
the breakfast,
the favorite books,

42
00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:38.690
the behaviors and so on that you can use in your own life.

43
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.520
Borrow from these individuals who have achieved the pinnacle of whatever their

44
00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:48.140
chosen field might be,
whether that's chess,
hedge fund,
managing,
sports,

45
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.920
acting,
government,
you name it,
military,
it goes on and on.

46
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.280
And in this particular episode we have a four summit is very exciting folks and

47
00:02:57.681 --> 00:03:01.930
I was very nervous about the tech in managing all of the cables and so on,

48
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.620
but it turned out even better than I could have possibly hoped.

49
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.650
It was after a workout with these people who all could kick my ass in so many

50
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:12.790
ways,
it is impossible to count.

51
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.810
And that is a good thing because if you are the strongest person in the room,

52
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:20.080
if you are the smartest person in the room,
you're in the wrong room.

53
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.570
And we have three people.

54
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.750
So we have first Laird Hamilton who is widely considered the greatest big wave

55
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.770
surfer of all time.

56
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.270
He is also a very innovative influencer in Modern Board Sports and surfing.

57
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:38.260
So he is considered either the creator or certainly popularizer of towing

58
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:41.230
surfing,
which allows him and now many,

59
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:46.231
many other people to surf waves bigger than ever before possible and is largely

60
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:49.520
responsible for the rebirth of standup paddleboarding.

61
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.430
If you've seen people stand up paddle boarding,

62
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.250
chances are on some level you have Laird to thank for it.

63
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.290
Laird has started in many serving films and was the centerpiece of riding
giants,

64
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.050
a documentary about big wave surfing,
which of you have not seen?

65
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.820
You have to see it will make your palms sweat within the first few minutes.

66
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:08.200
It's insanity.

67
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.470
And he's also a considered the writer of the heaviest wave of all time,

68
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:17.320
or at least at the time that surfing magazine had him on the cover.

69
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.810
And the only caption was,
oh my God.

70
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.560
So He's been a contributing editor for men's journal.
He's been on Oprah,

71
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:27.780
Charlie rose,
60 minutes,
the Ellen degeneres show.
And uh,

72
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.760
he's also very well known and I admire layered for this,

73
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:35.200
for using his lifestyle and his skill set to raise money for charities,

74
00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:39.310
including race across America,
pipeline for a cure for cystic fibrosis,

75
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.330
rain catcher and muscular dystrophy,
et cetera.
He's an awesome dude.

76
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.480
And the only person perhaps as intimidatingly awesome is his wife Gabrielle

77
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.950
Reece.

78
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.480
Gabby has been named one of the 20 most influential women in sports and is best

79
00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:58.600
known for her fantastic success in volleyball.

80
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.000
But she's of course also to modeling.

81
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.730
She's had starring roles as a trainer on the biggest loser.

82
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.150
And a Reese is just incredible and I've had a chance to work out with Gabby.

83
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.900
Uh,

84
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.900
she is every bit as incredible as layered and they're both about a foot taller

85
00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:21.010
than I am,
but,
um,
let's not go there.
That's okay.
I feel okay in my,
my,

86
00:05:21.011 --> 00:05:23.860
no mish like stature in any case.
Uh,

87
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.530
Gabby has also used her sort of crossover success in these different fields to

88
00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:32.440
become the first female athlete to ever design a shoe for Nike.

89
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.470
And she now serves as a fitness expert for Yahoo health among many,

90
00:05:35.471 --> 00:05:36.304
many other things.

91
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.170
The last person in our little Monesha for,

92
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.990
I don't know how to say that in French is a Brian Mackenzie.

93
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.750
He is the founder of crossfit and directs and the author of the New York Times

94
00:05:46.751 --> 00:05:49.120
bestselling book,
unbreakable runner.
Uh,

95
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:53.410
Brian has created a lot of controversy and a used feature in the four hour body

96
00:05:53.411 --> 00:05:56.860
for a lot of it by suggesting a very counterintuitive approach to distance

97
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.360
running,
uh,
in which he challenges high mileage,

98
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:03.860
runs high carb diets and incorporates a lot of intense strength training in some

99
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:07.250
cases.
Very brief strength training to conquer everything from five ks to ultra

100
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:12.230
marathons.
And many of you out there have used his protocol,

101
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:16.370
his sort of eight week to 12 week protocol and the four hour body to go from

102
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.420
running nothing to running marathons and ultra marathons in record time.

103
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:25.370
So congratulations and layered for those of you who didn't see it was also one

104
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:27.740
of my surfing coaches in the Tim Ferriss experiment.

105
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:31.640
So just check that out@itunes.com forward slash timferriss two RS and two ss.

106
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.230
And without further ado,
here is layered Gabby and Brian

107
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.160
<v 3>guys,
welcome to the show.
I'm so thrilled to have you guys here.
And,
uh,</v>

108
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.230
I thought that we could just start off with a description of what just happened

109
00:06:49.241 --> 00:06:53.380
because I came in here this morning terrified of this workout.
And

110
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.660
Brian,
it's something else in mind.
And,
uh,

111
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.580
I came out out of the workout really exhausted,

112
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:08.440
feeling great and having done things in the workout I didn't think I was capable

113
00:07:08.441 --> 00:07:12.620
of.
And as hoping layered,
maybe you could just describe the training,
all of that,

114
00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:16.660
but that seems like a perfect scenario.
You know,
it was,

115
00:07:16.661 --> 00:07:21.190
I was very surprised it did all those things to you.
Well,
and,
and,
uh,

116
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.450
I mean,
ultimately I think it's about challenging your beliefs,

117
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.320
but also challenging your,
you know,
your physicality.
So,
I mean,

118
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.450
within that scenario of,
you know,
the things that we've done,
we've,
we're,

119
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.370
we're thermal regulating the heat,
the ice,
the pool,
the,
the lack of breath,
the,

120
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:43.270
the effort of,
you know,
uh,
swimming and jumping and,
you know,

121
00:07:43.271 --> 00:07:44.560
all the physical stuff.
I mean,

122
00:07:44.561 --> 00:07:47.650
there's just so many things happening simultaneously.

123
00:07:47.651 --> 00:07:50.760
I think it really is about just complete confusion.
Yeah.

124
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.630
And what I also realized,

125
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:55.720
and for those people who are not familiar with lyrics pool,

126
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.790
and why would you be there are stairs,

127
00:07:57.791 --> 00:08:01.390
there's a staircase built into the middle of the pool so that people can walk

128
00:08:01.391 --> 00:08:04.660
down.
But then you might think,
well,
wouldn't you just float up to the surface?

129
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.650
But you have everyone weighed down with giant dumbbells with giant,

130
00:08:08.651 --> 00:08:10.900
when you sign a set of steps that brings you into the pool,

131
00:08:10.901 --> 00:08:14.060
these are steps that are underwater in the middle of the poor,
correct.
Yeah,

132
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.260
correct.
And what I realized when it's empty,

133
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:24.030
so you can do,
so you can do your workouts when the pools out there
and,
uh,

134
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.090
uh,
the,
uh,
to Gabby,
you gave me some very good advice.

135
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:33.150
I just remember holding dumbbells and like your eyes don't need to be as wide

136
00:08:33.881 --> 00:08:37.600
open.
I just looked like,
I dunno a cat in a corner,

137
00:08:37.601 --> 00:08:41.740
I guess probably bug eyed and faster is not better.

138
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.320
And I was hoping maybe you could just elaborate on that.
Cause I think it's a,

139
00:08:44.321 --> 00:08:47.950
it's a really interesting concept that translates not just to the workout in the

140
00:08:47.951 --> 00:08:49.060
pool but to a lot of things.

141
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:54.130
Well we were just saying that earlier that it's very true to life,
um,

142
00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:55.980
that it's,
it is

143
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.250
<v 4>more about with purpose and with a,</v>

144
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.790
with a calm manner at times can actually be more effective.

145
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:08.040
And so the water really exaggerates all of that and also forces you to sort of a

146
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:09.360
yield to that method.

147
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:14.390
And so really just looking around takes up oxygen.

148
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.670
Right?
And so,
and actually you did very well today,

149
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:18.990
so you have to give yourself some credit.

150
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:22.680
But a lot of times we were so focused and our eyes open,

151
00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:27.610
like when you play land sports and you go to focus,
you do open your eyes.
It's a,

152
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.840
it's a focus mechanism.
Right?
Right.

153
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.570
But in the pool it's quite opposite where you have to relax everything that you

154
00:09:33.571 --> 00:09:36.840
can relax.
So all the air goes to the places that are doing the work,
right.

155
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:38.490
Your eyes,
your jaw,
everything.

156
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.550
And then it's moving in a way that you're,
it's what,

157
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.920
what amount of oxygen are you giving up for the amount of effort you're putting

158
00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:51.670
in and finding that sort of sweet spot of this,
this effort,
uh,

159
00:09:51.671 --> 00:09:54.550
especially when you're not doing rec,
really heavy,
heavy weight.
Right.

160
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.940
And it's more about the breath holding.
Okay.

161
00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.270
<v 3>Definitely.
And I was uh,
you know Brian,</v>

162
00:09:58.271 --> 00:10:02.710
we were chatting a couple of days ago when I was doing one of my usual walks in

163
00:10:02.711 --> 00:10:06.430
San Francisco and you got me very excited about the pool training obviously.

164
00:10:06.431 --> 00:10:08.290
And Rick,
who we both know,
Rick Rubin,

165
00:10:08.291 --> 00:10:12.580
who's been on the podcast has talked about this and you were talking about using

166
00:10:12.581 --> 00:10:16.700
the mask that I now have.
Yes.
As well as this training.
And uh,

167
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.240
when I asked you what were most excited about these days,

168
00:10:19.241 --> 00:10:20.830
one of the answers was the breath training.

169
00:10:20.831 --> 00:10:25.030
And I just love to hear what you are doing with the breath training,

170
00:10:25.031 --> 00:10:27.270
sort of some of the results you've seen.
A,

171
00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.280
because it's such a fundamental aspect of all life and sports,

172
00:10:32.411 --> 00:10:35.020
but,
uh,
having been exposed to like Wim Hoff and so on,

173
00:10:35.021 --> 00:10:36.910
it's sort of come to the forefront of my mind,

174
00:10:36.911 --> 00:10:40.370
but this is my first time ever really playing around with it.
Yeah.

175
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.120
Doing an exhale,
then trying to swim lengths of a pool,

176
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.870
which is completely different.
But yeah.
What is,
what has been,
um,

177
00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.870
what has been your experience and how are you doing some of that training?
Um,

178
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:50.751
well I,

179
00:10:50.751 --> 00:10:55.751
I first was given that training mask by a buddy of mine in Hawaii and in Kwai

180
00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.490
Elevation Training Mask.
Yeah.
Elevation training mask.
And you know,
I,

181
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.740
I looked at it now,
it was a little weirded out by it,
but I,
I was,

182
00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:04.300
with anything I get,
I'm like,

183
00:11:04.301 --> 00:11:07.570
I'm going to screw around with it and if it makes sense for me to screw around

184
00:11:07.571 --> 00:11:11.520
with it,
I'll continue to screw around with it.
If it doesn't,
I'll toss it.
Um,

185
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:16.150
and I immediately got a response out of my diaphragm.
Like when I took a breath,

186
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:20.650
you have to use your diaphragm had to use my diaphragm blue who don't have the

187
00:11:20.651 --> 00:11:24.670
visual,
the mask,
I guess it looks almost like a mass gain mass could use,
right.

188
00:11:24.671 --> 00:11:27.520
A bane mask for construction,
right.
You have the ventilation correct.

189
00:11:27.521 --> 00:11:32.140
Can change the amount of airflow that's permitted.
Correct.
Right,
correct.

190
00:11:32.141 --> 00:11:32.960
So you can get,

191
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.960
their whole scheme is from like 3000 feet to 18,000 feet and you can change all

192
00:11:38.331 --> 00:11:41.470
of those settings.
Laird likes to play around with a little further,

193
00:11:41.471 --> 00:11:45.430
which is typical.
Um,
which is good,
you know,
so unlike him,
Hey,

194
00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.440
I know it's very unlike him.
So anyway,
I got a,

195
00:11:49.441 --> 00:11:53.890
a quick understanding of this mask and I saw something that I have seen in with

196
00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:54.160
every

197
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.060
<v 5>athlete I've really ever worked with is like when you see a spinal fault or you</v>

198
00:11:58.061 --> 00:12:02.770
see a mechanical fault,
meaning their postures,
postures off positions off.

199
00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:05.860
So if I'm in,
I'm making a quarter extremity violation,

200
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.920
I am literally probably most likely making that fault with spinal mechanics or

201
00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:14.620
extremity violation.
Of your limbs is doing something funny.

202
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.000
Now your limb is actually compensating for making up for the lack of stability

203
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:20.770
that's going on here.

204
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.180
I think of being overextended or being flex too far forward.

205
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:28.330
If I flex too far forward,
I run into a wall.

206
00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:33.210
When I breathe [inaudible] breathe.
If I don't,
yeah,

207
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.010
I can breathe and I can,

208
00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:40.050
and this showed me immediately that I could get people who did not understand

209
00:12:40.781 --> 00:12:43.150
this concept,
which is a very hard thing to come by.
I mean,

210
00:12:43.151 --> 00:12:45.640
we can talk about it right now and people are probably like,
okay,
whatever,

211
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.210
you know.
But if I put the mask on,
I immediately go to my nose.

212
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.790
So I'm using my nose to breathe,
which is,
yes,

213
00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:54.460
you should be drawing and your breath for most of your breathing through your

214
00:12:54.461 --> 00:12:57.370
nose and you're forcing that diaphragm to work.

215
00:12:57.371 --> 00:13:02.200
So getting that concept down and then being introduced to Laird and Gabby

216
00:13:02.201 --> 00:13:04.610
through,
uh,
my friend Kai,
um,

217
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.860
I came up here and it wa it was just,

218
00:13:08.861 --> 00:13:11.230
it's exactly like Laird said.
It's say,
you know,

219
00:13:11.231 --> 00:13:13.310
it's mass confusion were confusing and we're,
we're,

220
00:13:13.311 --> 00:13:16.570
we're kind of tossing the entire nuts and bolts at you.

221
00:13:16.571 --> 00:13:20.740
And then it's exactly as Gabby's explaining in the fact that it's like,
look,

222
00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:25.980
you actually have to be conscious of what's really going on and controlled and

223
00:13:27.221 --> 00:13:31.840
like,
hey,
where are you focused?
Where are you doing?
Are you the energy of,

224
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.680
Oh my God,
that facial expression is literally costing energy,
right.

225
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:41.350
That cost must you reps.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,
exactly.
That's what costs you reps.

226
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.540
And so this sending to the other side.
Yeah.

227
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:45.130
And then all your friends see you not make it.

228
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.120
And this is made more sense to me in being not only somebody who was a

229
00:13:49.121 --> 00:13:51.910
competitive swimmer,
somebody who's a coach,
somebody who's worked.

230
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:56.590
But I specialize in movement,
but it's,
you have to learn,

231
00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.690
you will get efficient in that pool

232
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.620
<v 3>very quickly.
Right.
Because all of the,</v>

233
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:07.350
any energy leak is exaggerated.
Yes.
And just so people have a,
a visual,

234
00:14:07.351 --> 00:14:11.490
once again,
the first exercise we did in the pool,
I guess I had,
I want to say,

235
00:14:11.491 --> 00:14:14.730
started with 15 pound weights.
Uh,
dumbbells.
And then moved up,

236
00:14:14.731 --> 00:14:19.620
but you're sort of sinking to the bottom of the pool and then doing a shoulder

237
00:14:19.621 --> 00:14:23.040
press as you jump up to the surface of the pool.

238
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.900
And then you're bringing your arms down to your sides,

239
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.170
almost like you're swimming a stroke.
And that's when you got to be Jack,

240
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.210
like a jumping jack.
And that's when circle in a big circle.
That's when you take,

241
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.880
you take the breath at the top.
And so immediately I was like,
Oh,

242
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.880
I'm holding my breath underwater,

243
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:38.070
but I have to start exhaling as soon as I go underwater.

244
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.270
Otherwise I'm not going to,

245
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.180
I'm going to have to exhale and inhale at the top and that's what I'm going to

246
00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:43.090
swallow water.
Well,

247
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.170
it's also going to shorten your amount of air you can get in if you have to blow

248
00:14:46.171 --> 00:14:47.790
out and write reading,
which is all right.

249
00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:52.070
<v 5>Again,
counterintuitive costs money,
baby,
you know?
Exactly.
Cost money.</v>

250
00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.373
<v 3>So</v>

251
00:14:55.130 --> 00:15:00.130
the learning curve was so fascinating to me because even after 10 reps or 15

252
00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:02.750
apps,
I was like,
oh,
that thing that I was freaking out about.

253
00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:06.830
Unrepped three or four completely unnecessary.
Right.
And then,
uh,
Gabby,

254
00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:11.060
I think you mentioned this to me as I was doing one of the exercises I was even

255
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:15.050
more terrified of which was holding a dumbbell to my chest and swimming

256
00:15:15.051 --> 00:15:19.940
underwater,
back and forth across box.
That's called the ammo box.
Uh,

257
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.690
is if you feel like you can make it a exhale a little bit,

258
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.490
which is so counterintuitive,
that might've been B Mac.
Uh,

259
00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.810
but that's a trigger to your drain.
Yeah.
We'll,

260
00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:34.030
we'll also give you time because you knew your brain goes,
oh,
I'm exhaling,

261
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.440
I'm going to be inhaling.
Right.
So the rain,
so again,

262
00:15:36.441 --> 00:15:39.710
it's a little bit of a confusion.
Like you confuse yourself.

263
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.400
It maybe you confuse your,
your instincts,
right?
Like,

264
00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:47.840
like the breath holding the exhale drill.
Once you want to breathe in,

265
00:15:47.841 --> 00:15:51.380
as soon as you exhale,
you have a mechanism that's designed to breathe in,
right?

266
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.470
Because you have pressure on the diaphragm,
the you want to breathe in.

267
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:59.240
But once you teach the body to have to resist against that and know it's okay

268
00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.120
that you're not going to breathe in right now cause you still have the oxygen,

269
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:07.050
then that then leads you to a new place.
And what is ned?

270
00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:09.500
I have,
we've,
we've drained these glasses,
but Larry,

271
00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:14.490
can you elaborate on this very potent yellow elixir?
It is good.
Ah,

272
00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.530
I put put era my,
and wanted to take a now on,

273
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:21.490
now he is ready to climb Everest remote generated.
Yeah.

274
00:16:21.491 --> 00:16:26.270
And so we were doing the input exercises and then we would do ice bath for

275
00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:28.520
three,
at least three minutes minimum.
Yup.

276
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.780
And then about 15 minutes minimum in 20 in the hot box one,

277
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.810
the barrels on at two 20.
So I was about to take,

278
00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.900
I felt like I was ready for a nap and then I had this magic concoction.
What is,

279
00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.130
what is in this beverage?
Oh,
well that was a fresh,

280
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.370
fresh squeezed tumeric root.
Yeah.

281
00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:50.360
And you have a whole box of this turmeric root [inaudible] let's say you can get

282
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:54.920
it at the store.
Yeah.
But fresh,
fresh squeezed tumeric root,
uh,
uh,

283
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:59.980
liquid pepper extract and then a raw honey and apple cider vinegar water of

284
00:17:01.651 --> 00:17:06.170
course,
to do that was fully diluted by the way.
No,
that's uh,
that's intense.
Yeah.

285
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:10.280
But I,
but I really enjoyed it.
And you also showed me something earlier,

286
00:17:10.281 --> 00:17:14.780
which is about the size of a large cat.
It is a mushroom.

287
00:17:14.781 --> 00:17:17.300
What type of mushroom is this?
Yeah,
it's called the Chaga Chaga,

288
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.890
which is pretty uncommon.
Hard to find from an it,
from what I understand.
Yeah.

289
00:17:21.891 --> 00:17:26.840
Rare but rare.
More because it's unknown,
but also its uniqueness of the habitat.

290
00:17:26.841 --> 00:17:29.120
It comes from and,
and uh,

291
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:32.450
and then the ability to use it and most people just don't know about it.

292
00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:36.050
So it's uh,
but it's the most powerful mushroom in the world.

293
00:17:36.051 --> 00:17:39.260
They say the spores are found in the stratosphere.

294
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:44.240
They found Chaga spores like in the,
in the stratosphere while in space.

295
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.820
[inaudible] they only mushroom to that grows on a living.
Uh,
yes.
Yeah.

296
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:50.220
And doesn't take

297
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.690
<v 6>from it.
It's not live in Gaza.
The parasite.</v>

298
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:57.690
It's actually supplying the symbiotic relationship to the,

299
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.640
I think today sort of the theme for me has just been fear so far.
My own fear.

300
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.690
So I'd love to talk about that.
I just a little bit,
uh,
all three of you.

301
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:10.660
I think if they've sort of befriended fear in some ways,
but,
so Gabby,

302
00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.280
when when you were competing or even now,
uh,

303
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.780
obviously world class athlete,
uh,

304
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:22.010
what was your self talk like before a big match or before a big event?

305
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.740
How would you prepare yourself for that?
Why?
You know,
I'm not going to answer it.

306
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.400
I want to preface,
I want to help you out with the,
to,

307
00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:35.180
because I met this app is on a show
the extremist.
Yeah.

308
00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.700
And she was the host when I met.
Right,
right,
right.

309
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:43.230
And she came to interview me and she'd already interviewed like 60 other people

310
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:46.410
and gun an aspect of their sport.
Oh,
got it.

311
00:18:46.411 --> 00:18:50.400
For her for a matching volleyball,
like I respect that as an athlete,

312
00:18:50.401 --> 00:18:54.660
but for her to go out and jump out of a plane to beat to go hang gliding on some

313
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:59.070
crazy I to do a,
you know,
uh,
a dragster bike.

314
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.160
I mean these are because you're going into,
I don't,
I think,

315
00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.860
I mean you can ask her that question,
she can answer it instead of me,

316
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:09.420
but ultimately ask her the question of were what was more heavy like before a

317
00:19:09.421 --> 00:19:12.510
big match that you were going to play or like get on a drag bike that you've

318
00:19:12.511 --> 00:19:16.470
never been on and release the collection goes zero to 60 in a second.
No,

319
00:19:16.471 --> 00:19:21.320
that's helpful.
That's very helpful.
So I feel like even thank you honey.

320
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.440
More of a weakling and coward than I did before.
I ask the question,
but let me,

321
00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:28.450
<v 4>I have to say that when you,
when you,</v>

322
00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:32.920
when you practice many hours and you dedicate a lot of time to something,
yeah,

323
00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.450
it does have a different value.
Sure.
You know,

324
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.690
if I was doing MTV sports are the extremists,

325
00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:42.670
there was a margin of I'm going to do the best I can.
Yeah.
And certainly,

326
00:19:42.671 --> 00:19:46.240
you know,
Laird always jokes that if there's,
if there's something on the line,

327
00:19:46.241 --> 00:19:50.500
then I'm very good,
like really focused.
Like if you said to me,
Hey,
get real,

328
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.600
let's go for a mountain bike ride and,

329
00:19:52.601 --> 00:19:53.740
and we're going to go for like three hours,

330
00:19:53.741 --> 00:19:56.500
just the totally rad and extreme and go downhill.
I'd be like,
I'm good.

331
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.650
But if you said,
hey,
there's this point in purpose and we're going to,

332
00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.370
I would do it that.
Yeah.
So I'm a little different that way.
You need the,

333
00:20:03.371 --> 00:20:06.220
the stakes are the incentive or they talked of it kind of,

334
00:20:06.221 --> 00:20:09.400
and that's maybe not great actually.
I'll be honest with you.
So volleyball,

335
00:20:09.401 --> 00:20:12.580
I had a different emotional attachment because I invested a lot of time and it

336
00:20:12.581 --> 00:20:15.090
meant a lot to me.
Yeah.
Um,
so I,

337
00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:19.840
I had a different expectation that expectation.
Right.
Going into it.

338
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.010
Um,
I would kind of go through a ritual that would get me into a different head

339
00:20:23.011 --> 00:20:27.400
space where I was switching from,
you know,
me as a person to me the competitor.

340
00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.790
But um,
the ritual look like,
you know,

341
00:20:30.791 --> 00:20:34.090
it was sort of like the hair goes up in a ponytail and then you start putting

342
00:20:34.091 --> 00:20:38.230
some block on and then they put my white clean,
my glasses.
I put those on.

343
00:20:38.231 --> 00:20:39.940
It was all very thought out.

344
00:20:39.941 --> 00:20:43.810
I would detach away for everyone except my teammates.
Um,

345
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:48.880
but how long did that pregame ritual?
Maybe 15,

346
00:20:48.881 --> 00:20:52.360
20 minutes.
I took superstitious too.
I would never compete in the color red.

347
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.510
If I wore something and played badly,

348
00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:59.480
I would not use that visor or hair tire pair of glasses again.
Right.

349
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.780
So I did have those weird things,

350
00:21:01.781 --> 00:21:05.350
but I think like any athlete will tell you there's certain things that I wish I

351
00:21:05.351 --> 00:21:08.530
had been better at.
Um,
it took me,

352
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:13.960
I think having children has made me less concerned with making everybody happy.

353
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.010
Right.
And I think even when I was competing,
I was a lot,

354
00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:20.600
I was really concerned about how people felt.
Um,

355
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.070
so that was hard because it's hard to try to be,
oh you're trying to kick ass,

356
00:21:24.071 --> 00:21:28.550
but then you're worried about how people feel so bad dynamic.
So I did have,

357
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:32.500
I would change personality,
but I,
I will truthfully say that I also,

358
00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:33.940
I think I held myself back.

359
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:36.830
<v 3>So coming back to the parenting comment,</v>

360
00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.500
so having kids has made you care less about what people think.
Well,

361
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:45.950
you straight get meaner because you have no time to people outside of your kids

362
00:21:45.951 --> 00:21:46.784
or to the kids.
Also

363
00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:50.790
<v 4>everybody.
Okay.
Now I think,
you know,
listen,
you have less time.</v>

364
00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:54.210
And also as a woman we're taught as young girls,
hey,
be nice at some,

365
00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.520
if you're nice girls act like this.

366
00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.270
And so it takes a long time to get to a place to go.

367
00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:01.970
Okay there I'm going to do things,

368
00:22:01.971 --> 00:22:05.660
say things and believe in things that people aren't going to like and I'm going

369
00:22:05.661 --> 00:22:06.830
to be okay with that.

370
00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:10.490
It takes men do that so much easier and it takes women a very long time.

371
00:22:10.491 --> 00:22:15.410
And if you're the only athletes I've seen that do it very easily are generally

372
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.650
the youngest girl with all older brothers,

373
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:23.390
they understand it's not personal much sooner than girls.

374
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.460
And so,
you know,

375
00:22:25.461 --> 00:22:28.370
and the other thing I always say is I wasn't really groomed to be a champion

376
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:31.430
like Kerri Walsh for example.
Her whole life was groomed.

377
00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:34.400
She was told at an early age are a winner.
You can when it's okay to win,

378
00:22:34.401 --> 00:22:37.790
expect to win.
I fell into winning and learning to win.

379
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.990
And so that was another thing I had to overcome.
How did you fall into winning?

380
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:47.060
By being really tall and being decently athletic and getting into sports.

381
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:51.020
I didn't have the sort of familial support didn't at all and I,
and I was,

382
00:22:51.021 --> 00:22:53.840
I was a late bloomer and all these things.
So it was all like,
well,

383
00:22:53.841 --> 00:22:56.300
is it okay to win?
And like it's,
it's kind of going good.

384
00:22:56.301 --> 00:22:59.000
Like it was all that weird sort of things that you had to overcome.

385
00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.520
So I think there's a lot of things you learn in children,

386
00:23:01.521 --> 00:23:03.500
put things into real perspective for you.

387
00:23:03.501 --> 00:23:07.310
Age puts things into perspective and those usually happen kind of simultaneous.

388
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:12.430
Yeah.
Um,
and you again,
you have less time so you kind of cut through the crap.

389
00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:13.693
Yeah.

390
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.640
<v 3>Brian,
so you've worked with a lot of athletes,
you know,</v>

391
00:23:19.641 --> 00:23:22.580
a lot of world class coaches and you've traveled a ton.

392
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:26.660
When you think of the word successful,
who's the first person who comes to mind?

393
00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:32.190
Um,
I will,

394
00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:36.910
these two are easily at that list and that's cause you're sitting here,

395
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.050
what will you ask the question?
I'm sitting in front of two people

396
00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:45.960
<v 4>and my wife,
um,
you know,</v>

397
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.730
<v 5>what are the characteristic?
Why,
why do you know?</v>

398
00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.210
Without knowing who they were or what the,

399
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:05.010
I knew who Laird was.
I knew who Gabby was.
Irrelevant,

400
00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.870
towed to the situation and what I was brought into and how I met them.

401
00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:13.160
And at the top of that sits happiness.
Um,

402
00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:16.340
you take away the financial side of stuff.

403
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:21.150
You take away the extreme,
you take away the,
you know,
correct.

404
00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:25.540
The like,
Hey,
I was at the pinnacle of sport.
Like I was,
you know,
I,

405
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.890
I was a world class athlete.

406
00:24:27.891 --> 00:24:32.891
You take that away and you see how a dynamic is working and you see how people

407
00:24:33.831 --> 00:24:37.100
are functioning and they're happy.
They're surrounded by people who are happy.

408
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:41.660
They are.
It's,
it's a,
it's an ecosystem in itself.
Um,

409
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:43.850
so I think that's,
you know,

410
00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.600
it's easy to just say that because they're sitting right here,
you know,

411
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:51.950
because it's the truth.
You know,
I'm,
I know plenty of people like that,

412
00:24:51.951 --> 00:24:55.040
but I also know plenty of people that are miserable.
Then you would say,
oh,

413
00:24:55.041 --> 00:24:58.510
they're so successful.
And it's like,
hmm,
what do you consider it?
Right.

414
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.130
If you use the bank account maybe.
Yeah,
the big count.

415
00:25:01.131 --> 00:25:05.030
Or like even like just behavior.
Yeah,

416
00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.750
like behavior of,
uh,
like I'm threatened by you,
I'm,

417
00:25:08.751 --> 00:25:11.180
I'm insecure about this stuff.
Like,
it's like,
yeah,

418
00:25:11.181 --> 00:25:15.360
you got some stuff to work on still.
Yeah.
Before we get,
I,

419
00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:19.130
I'm,
I'm out of this situation,
like I've got to exit from this.
It would,

420
00:25:19.131 --> 00:25:23.930
it just doesn't work enough for me.
Yeah.
Like in the happiness.

421
00:25:23.931 --> 00:25:26.840
Let's talk about that for a second because one thing that really struck me in

422
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:31.870
why I like hanging out with you guys also have wanted to hang out more was when,

423
00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.320
uh,
I was filming for the Tim Ferriss experiment.
We did the surfing episode,

424
00:25:36.321 --> 00:25:37.250
which was a blast.

425
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:41.250
And thank you guys both for putting up with me for that period of time.
Uh,

426
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:45.350
and I suppose putting up with me now also,
but the,
the,

427
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.590
the memory that comes to me when people are like,
oh,
how was it?

428
00:25:48.591 --> 00:25:50.180
What was it like hanging out with them?
And I,

429
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:54.320
and it's the time at home when you were joking around with the kids and like

430
00:25:54.321 --> 00:25:58.730
doing the steam baths and the,
the ice baths.
That's,
I was like,
you know,

431
00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.350
it's not just the really,
really,

432
00:26:00.351 --> 00:26:04.280
really good athletes who have maintained an unbelievable level of physical

433
00:26:04.281 --> 00:26:07.470
performance.
Uh,
it's that you feel,

434
00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:11.160
you seem to have a very kind of integrated life,
uh,

435
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:13.860
with as spouses and then with the kids.
Uh,

436
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:19.670
but you obviously had had some challenges growing up.
Wasn't easy.

437
00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.740
What have you,
uh,
layered,

438
00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:26.330
like how have you guys thought about parenting and what you are trying to do

439
00:26:26.331 --> 00:26:30.550
differently with your kids?
Well,
I think that it's our,
you know,

440
00:26:30.551 --> 00:26:31.820
I think for everyone,

441
00:26:31.821 --> 00:26:36.821
you maybe want to be the parent that you didn't have or maybe you want to be the

442
00:26:36.981 --> 00:26:41.180
period you think you wanted.
Right?
You know,
you also,
of course,
you know,

443
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.040
depending on the relationship,
your parents,
if,
if

444
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.600
<v 7>they,
if you had an incredible one,</v>

445
00:26:45.601 --> 00:26:49.060
then you want to try to be the parent that you had.
Right?
So there was parents,
I,

446
00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:51.630
you know,
some of the parents I had were,

447
00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:54.130
they're going to want to be in some of the parents I had.
I,

448
00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:57.480
we're parents I didn't want to be.
And so,
you know,
you try to,
you try to,

449
00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.740
you know,
you tried to do the best you can and you,
and I mean,

450
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:04.140
you go from your instincts,
you go from your heart.
I mean you,

451
00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:05.520
when you really look at it,
when I,

452
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:10.420
if I look at the most important thing for me in parenting,

453
00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:14.490
being parented as a young child was being loved,

454
00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:18.630
I go like being loved was probably,
and if I can just,
you know,

455
00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:23.220
loving your children can override a lot of wrongs.
Yeah.

456
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:24.840
How do you,
how do you

457
00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:28.690
<v 4>demonstrate that?
Uh,
well,
I mean that sounds like a weird question,</v>

458
00:27:28.691 --> 00:27:30.520
but do you know what I mean?
Because I think a lot of smart,

459
00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:35.320
I know a lot of smart people who are just not good parents and like try,

460
00:27:35.321 --> 00:27:38.710
but they're not good.
We do it different like,
so for example,
Reese,

461
00:27:38.711 --> 00:27:43.450
our middle daughter who is more similar to Laird and very emotional shoe would

462
00:27:43.451 --> 00:27:47.770
be going through something and
thank,
you know,
she is,

463
00:27:47.771 --> 00:27:50.920
I know straight up and our younger daughter more similar to Gabby's a ruthless

464
00:27:50.921 --> 00:27:54.590
killer.
True.
Anyway,
so Reese,

465
00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:56.780
we'd be like upset about something and I'd be like,
well let's,
you know,

466
00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.220
what's talk about it.
How are you feeling?
What's going on?
You know,
Reese,

467
00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:00.340
I mean levered,
walk in the room,

468
00:28:00.341 --> 00:28:03.040
kind of take one look at her and grab her and put her on the floor and hugger.

469
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.080
Right.
And so,
um,

470
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:09.790
I think one thing is we've learned as we try our best to be an allied front.

471
00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:15.400
We never let the kids feel like they can wedge between us ever.
Um,

472
00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.810
so that's very helpful.

473
00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:22.230
And I think believe it or not layered is more touchy feely.

474
00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:26.080
Love them.

475
00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:29.240
<v 7>You know,
there are also girls you,
I mean if we had some sons you might be,</v>

476
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:33.970
maybe there might be a different,
maybe because it's male,
female pointed,
right.

477
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:37.820
Daddy's little girls in Mommy's little boy.
It just,
the nature that the dynamic,

478
00:28:37.821 --> 00:28:41.090
I mean I had a mother that I had an incredible relationship with and you just

479
00:28:41.091 --> 00:28:46.091
have that male female reaction just don't with you Sam attacks.

480
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:46.960
Yeah.

481
00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.970
<v 4>Two.
So I think you have that.
And then,
you know,</v>

482
00:28:48.971 --> 00:28:52.660
I make sure I understand the nuances like their favorite,

483
00:28:52.661 --> 00:28:57.661
they need this certain clothing and like a lessons and then they can talk to me

484
00:28:57.701 --> 00:29:00.550
about their girl stuff.
Yeah.
And I,
you know,

485
00:29:00.551 --> 00:29:02.650
they know I'm not going to surprise them.

486
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.180
<v 7>Like I'm sending elusive too.
And we treat them like adults.</v>

487
00:29:06.181 --> 00:29:10.260
We've always spoken to them like adults.
We treat them like a,
like a,

488
00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.540
like an adult.
We,
you know that,
what did they say?

489
00:29:12.541 --> 00:29:16.130
Treat them like an honored guest and don't act like one,
you know,
but,

490
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.250
but ultimately,
you know,
we treat,
we treat them,
we take them with us when we go,

491
00:29:20.251 --> 00:29:22.980
we all go together.
When we go to eat somewhere.
I mean,

492
00:29:22.981 --> 00:29:26.160
we'd go to dinner parties where no one brings their kids,

493
00:29:26.161 --> 00:29:29.580
but we bring our kids because our just otherwise we don't go where the people

494
00:29:29.581 --> 00:29:32.160
that invite us know that,
hey,
it's the big date come.

495
00:29:32.161 --> 00:29:34.140
They're coming with the family.
Yeah.

496
00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.240
<v 4>And we're tough on them.
We're tough on them.
We're,</v>

497
00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:41.500
we're in what ways are you tough on them?
I mean,
we're just like,

498
00:29:41.501 --> 00:29:45.100
if they do something where that could be perceived as not using really good

499
00:29:45.101 --> 00:29:49.210
judgment,
there's no like,
well honey,
me,
no,
we don't do that in this house.

500
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:53.410
It's straight up.
Like,
what are you doing?
You know?
So I think there's a direct,

501
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.420
we have a very direct style of parenting,

502
00:29:55.421 --> 00:29:59.500
which thank goodness our children are a certain way because for me personally,

503
00:29:59.501 --> 00:30:02.170
my kids are very stubborn and strong willed and everything else.

504
00:30:02.171 --> 00:30:05.200
But it would be much harder for me if I had a kid that was,

505
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:09.010
that I'd have to coddle more,
uh,
because I would,

506
00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.300
I don't know that verbiage as well.
Um,
but listen,
I've had to say,

507
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.360
I'm sorry many times.
That's another thing you learn as a parent.

508
00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.510
You have to learn to say sorry because you blow it so you can,

509
00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:24.280
it's sometimes you can go,
hey,
you know what,
I'm,
I am extra tired today and I,

510
00:30:24.281 --> 00:30:27.430
my fuse is short and I am being unfair to you.
And I'm sorry,

511
00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.690
like you have to learn that you're imperfect and,

512
00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.230
and kind of opened that door up to like,
there's times that you go,
hey,
you know,

513
00:30:35.231 --> 00:30:38.710
I always say to my girls,
do you feel loved enough?
You know,

514
00:30:38.711 --> 00:30:42.400
because you want to know.
And they're like,
oh,
you'll come on mom.
You know,

515
00:30:42.401 --> 00:30:46.060
but I think he should ask.
We'll just asking says a lot.
Right.

516
00:30:46.061 --> 00:30:47.800
Even even if they like brush it off,

517
00:30:47.801 --> 00:30:52.801
like I would imagine kids respect by asking them respect and also you're showing

518
00:30:52.991 --> 00:30:56.080
them it's okay to not be perfect because we're not perfect either.
Right.

519
00:30:56.081 --> 00:30:58.540
So we're not demanding some perfection out of them,

520
00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.640
which is totally unobtainable.
How you can do that.
But having said that,

521
00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:05.800
like right now are almost 20 year old daughter.
She doesn't love us right now.

522
00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:09.880
Right.
I'm telling straight up like she doesn't,
she's not loving us right now.

523
00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:14.220
Yeah.
So,
okay.
Yeah.
So it's not like,
Ooh La,
la I and it,

524
00:31:14.221 --> 00:31:18.030
which interesting because Brian's comments talking about,
you know,
having that,

525
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:22.270
that that happiness or contentment or is a sign of success.

526
00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:25.960
And I always said as a parent to be a successful parent would be that you could

527
00:31:25.961 --> 00:31:28.360
raise a continuum and cause I don't know that many.

528
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:33.460
So if you could actually be a parent that raises a contain human good parenting.

529
00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:37.440
<v 3>Yeah.
And what I would have also noticed just with,
with you guys and then,
uh,</v>

530
00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:42.360
Brian and I,
it's,
I want to get your take on,
on a,
on a bunch of things,

531
00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:45.570
uh,
is that you have,
you mentioned like kind of wrestling to the ground.

532
00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:50.640
You have a very physical relationship with your kids and I think it's,
no,
no,
no,

533
00:31:50.641 --> 00:31:52.650
but I,
it's like he's a very,

534
00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:56.580
as someone who only recently gotten back into physical play doing stuff like

535
00:31:56.581 --> 00:31:57.414
acro yoga,

536
00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:02.010
it's been incredibly effective at anxiety reduction,

537
00:32:02.011 --> 00:32:05.610
relaxation and just feeling grounded and connected to other people.

538
00:32:05.611 --> 00:32:10.320
So I think that's also something that has struck me is just how you use

539
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:15.260
<v 4>a lot of physical interaction with your kids.
Why Hawaii too?
Like,
yeah,</v>

540
00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.680
like if you,
if my kids are hearing you go to leave,

541
00:32:17.681 --> 00:32:20.920
they're going to get up and walk you to the door and say goodbye.
In Hawaii,

542
00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.170
when you see an Auntie or an uncle,
you give him a hug.

543
00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:28.730
There's a touching component of like a tactile and all more how,

544
00:32:29.391 --> 00:32:31.900
like our main thing about even animals,
right?
Yeah.
Like,

545
00:32:31.901 --> 00:32:35.560
if my kid does something and I'm going to grab her arm,
right.
Or even like,

546
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:40.040
even if it's k t,
you know,
physical and play,
but just physical,

547
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:41.640
like we're in general.
Yeah.

548
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:45.790
<v 5>So think that the physical is a reflection of the emotional.
Okay.
No,</v>

549
00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:46.643
because if you know,

550
00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:49.680
you do yoga and it's an intense position and you're having all this stuff,

551
00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.630
but this is for spiritual enlightenment.

552
00:32:51.631 --> 00:32:55.530
This is to come to a higher level of consciousness,
but it's a physical act.

553
00:32:55.531 --> 00:32:56.370
So in a way,

554
00:32:56.371 --> 00:33:01.080
this physical relationship we have makes a mentally stronger shoots him
mentally,

555
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:03.240
you know,
all these things are just reflection,

556
00:33:03.241 --> 00:33:07.170
these physical reflections of these emotional states.
So all of a sudden,

557
00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:12.290
emotionally there are a lot more open and do new things and handle and be tough

558
00:33:12.301 --> 00:33:14.760
and all that stuff.
Well,
it's like the training and the pool earlier,

559
00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:18.510
it's the same,
same element of transfer.
Uh,
Brian,

560
00:33:18.511 --> 00:33:20.810
you looked like you had something to say.
I do have another question.

561
00:33:20.811 --> 00:33:25.810
Why I think this all adds to the,
this,
this is happiness.
This is there.

562
00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:29.070
They're having fun with your kids.
Yeah.
I don't see,

563
00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:33.420
there's only really a couple other people and the other person that really comes

564
00:33:33.421 --> 00:33:37.480
to mind when the same way that there's a family,
like this is Kelly.
Yeah.

565
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:41.070
Start out and,
and everything.
The star,
I mean I'm a part of that family.

566
00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:45.330
Like I am literally I,
I don't live there anymore.
I used to live five doors down.

567
00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:48.750
Yeah.
But I go up there,
I stayed at the house,
I'm with the girls,

568
00:33:48.751 --> 00:33:51.060
I helped the girls get ready.
I'll take him to school.

569
00:33:51.061 --> 00:33:53.670
I'll like the whole process is this whole Auntie,
uncle,

570
00:33:53.671 --> 00:33:58.671
this whole thing of being happy and are we having fun?

571
00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.660
If you're not having fun,
what are we doing?

572
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:02.920
<v 4>They seem even happier than we are sometimes.</v>

573
00:34:02.921 --> 00:34:06.130
I feel like Lauren and I are like rough around the edges a little bit.
Like,

574
00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:09.310
you know,
like there's no secrets and it's kind of our,
you know,

575
00:34:09.311 --> 00:34:12.640
like I feel like when I speak nationally it feels like lighter and nicer.

576
00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:14.920
I envy that.
And some people like,
I'm like,
yes.

577
00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.540
<v 5>Well,
but Kelly is Kelly and but youtube is,
I,</v>

578
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:22.240
there has been very rare that I've seen almost a,

579
00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:26.560
the same type of dynamic happening where you have a husband wife combination

580
00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:31.040
that is,
is that works in the dynamic that it does.
Well here,

581
00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:36.010
here's a question for you.
So the two examples that you brought up.
Yes.

582
00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:40.660
Right.
Kelly,
Juliet,
two of you,
they work out together.
Yeah.
Right.

583
00:34:40.661 --> 00:34:42.840
And so you people say sometimes you know,

584
00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:45.310
those who work out together stay together.
Do you,

585
00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.520
can you think of anybody offhand who does not exercise together?

586
00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:53.340
Spouses who are very happy in the same way?

587
00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:54.690
Can you guys,
I'm just curious.

588
00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:57.760
<v 4>Okay.
Cause I have friends,
they function better when the,</v>

589
00:34:57.761 --> 00:35:02.020
to live their worlds and then they come together because in a way,

590
00:35:02.021 --> 00:35:03.670
even though Laird and I are independent,

591
00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:07.250
I think we both need that touchstone with each other.
Um,

592
00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.930
and it isn't chicken well and isn't maybe even the training because the joke is

593
00:35:10.931 --> 00:35:13.240
the only time we trained together as in the pool because it's underwater and we

594
00:35:13.241 --> 00:35:16.090
can't talk because we don't train together on the land.

595
00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:21.570
Like Laird is my confidant and someone that I go to to get bounce ideas off or

596
00:35:22.301 --> 00:35:26.230
an a mentor in other ways,
but we don't actually train together too many,

597
00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:31.270
too bossy both.
Right.
So that's the running joke like we don't,
so the pool,

598
00:35:31.271 --> 00:35:33.970
it's cool because her class is too hard.
Oh yeah.
Right.

599
00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:36.900
Like the joke is like we can treat in the pool because we're under the water.

600
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.500
We can't smack talking to John.
I know you should do it like this.
No,

601
00:35:40.501 --> 00:35:41.610
I should do it like that.
You know what I'm saying?

602
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:45.030
<v 6>Play volleyball.
I used to be that.
I used to be the practice dummy.
Yeah,
I would.</v>

603
00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.380
I would ride home in the back of the truck and the dog because we fight.

604
00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:50.030
Like I would be in the back with the dogs

605
00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:51.981
<v 4>and I'd be driving the car.</v>

606
00:35:51.981 --> 00:35:54.960
I'm like that new new year underneath my breath and there'd be sitting there and

607
00:35:54.961 --> 00:35:57.060
whether the bed,
the dogs would be looking in his face and he'd be pissed.

608
00:35:57.061 --> 00:36:00.990
And my team like would win on some bad calls and he'd be like,
Oh,

609
00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:03.240
you girls feel good about winning like that.
You're going to like that.

610
00:36:03.241 --> 00:36:06.360
And we're like,
yeah,
like you don't get it like any way to win.

611
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:09.630
And they're just can't understand that.
So we,
to be honest,

612
00:36:09.631 --> 00:36:13.350
like let's not glorify.
Yeah,
yeah.
We do things together,
but it's,

613
00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:16.440
there's a lot of space.
Yeah.
Because when you,

614
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:19.980
when you days are long and when you're in years,
right?

615
00:36:19.981 --> 00:36:24.090
Like we're going on 20 years,
it's like you have to find that pace.

616
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:26.610
And there's some people,
if they had nine to five jobs,

617
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:30.450
maybe they should train together.
So we have a different deal.

618
00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:35.220
<v 6>But the number one thing in all successful relationships,
10,000 couples,</v>

619
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.260
there's only one thing that was,

620
00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:40.870
that everybody had in common no matter what the dynamic,

621
00:36:40.871 --> 00:36:44.670
because there's all that,
all the different dynamics.
One thing only,
what is it?

622
00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:49.980
Great sex.
Oh,
that's a good call.
Good call probably.
Right.

623
00:36:49.981 --> 00:36:51.990
That was probably the second.
Yeah.
The first thing,

624
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:56.790
did the man respected the woman?
Uh,
number one thing that demand,
I guarantee.

625
00:36:56.791 --> 00:37:01.440
Yeah.
That Kelly respects his wife [inaudible]

626
00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:08.130
take them apart limb by limb.
She has Brian,
his wife and I respect.
Exactly.

627
00:37:08.131 --> 00:37:12.300
Yeah.
So that's the bright,
narrow,
those three couples right away.

628
00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:13.710
Respect the man.

629
00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:17.390
<v 4>[inaudible] can I say one thing and I know and all those dynamics different,</v>

630
00:37:17.391 --> 00:37:20.720
like the ones that bed runner,
the,
the mass of better,
she's dominant,

631
00:37:20.721 --> 00:37:23.590
he's dominant,
whatever.
But ultimately more times than not,
if,

632
00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:28.620
if the woman can refrain from trying to change or mother her partner.

633
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.070
Yeah.

634
00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:34.200
She has a greater opportunity of putting herself in a position where the guy,

635
00:37:34.201 --> 00:37:38.090
I'll respect you.
Yeah.
It's just,
it's support.
That's it.
Yeah.
It's support.

636
00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:41.540
A man needs support.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean I love you guys and you're all strong,

637
00:37:41.541 --> 00:37:42.900
but you're very fragile.
Oh yeah.

638
00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:48.080
And you need to be like supported and help you fully realize your voice.

639
00:37:49.791 --> 00:37:50.624
What is it?

640
00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:53.960
<v 6>Cause we're expendable.
And so we have to go out and die for you at some point.</v>

641
00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.980
Yeah.
So we better be get it supported like the pram,

642
00:37:57.010 --> 00:38:00.730
you better you better support needs because I'm going to go,
you know,

643
00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:05.260
run in front of Tina,
you know,
Toronto Stars Rex for you get mowed down.

644
00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:08.950
So how do you,
how do you sub best support as a woman?

645
00:38:08.951 --> 00:38:11.820
How do you best support your,
uh,

646
00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:15.590
your part yellow counter partner without mothering?
What's the,

647
00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:20.010
<v 4>and had a great education.
First and foremost,
I'll be honest with you,</v>

648
00:38:20.011 --> 00:38:23.160
I picked a partner who there was just no chance in hell,
right?

649
00:38:23.161 --> 00:38:26.760
So Laird said to me the first couple of years we were together and unfortunately

650
00:38:26.761 --> 00:38:29.820
his,
his mom passed away.
Um,
the second year we're together.

651
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:34.350
I had a mom and she died and he made it very clear.

652
00:38:34.351 --> 00:38:38.110
So what it did is let me off the hook.
I don't need it.
No,
you don't mother me.

653
00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:42.370
And so what it did is it made me switch my brain right then where,
hey,

654
00:38:42.371 --> 00:38:46.150
that's off the table.
Cause women by nature,
we can't help it.
We're nurturers.

655
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.810
Right?
So sometimes that seeps over like,
hey honey,

656
00:38:49.811 --> 00:38:51.730
that joke was kind of inappropriate.
The dinner table,

657
00:38:51.731 --> 00:38:55.810
you're talking kind of loud.
It's all that.
Okay.
And then what happens is,

658
00:38:55.811 --> 00:38:58.870
is we somehow,
cause the man is trying to be loving and stuff,

659
00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.440
they pacify us and then they change all the ways we want them to and then we

660
00:39:02.441 --> 00:39:06.460
don't want them.
Right?
So it's a,
it's a great thing where you just say,
Hey,

661
00:39:06.461 --> 00:39:11.461
I'm going to pick a partner that I feel like our value system is similar.

662
00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:13.120
We may get there very differently,

663
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:16.600
but are kind of how we line up on some of the big items are the same.

664
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:21.910
And also what you learn is the,
for example,
layered is when you're with layered,

665
00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:26.920
you feel really loved.
Like when he directs that at you,
it's for real.
Right?
So,

666
00:39:26.921 --> 00:39:31.840
but it's connected to I'm restless.
Um,
I needed venture,

667
00:39:31.841 --> 00:39:34.990
all these other things.
So you sort of say,
you start to understand,
hey,

668
00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.930
these things over here that make this person who they are,

669
00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:41.180
I'm going to love all of it.
Right.
Um,
and

670
00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:43.830
<v 6>nor the fact that he talks over me and you know,</v>

671
00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:48.140
<v 4>yeah.
These are small things because you have to start looking at the big things.</v>

672
00:39:48.141 --> 00:39:51.380
Yeah.
You know,
like they're doing the best they can.
They're honest.
They're,

673
00:39:51.381 --> 00:39:56.060
you know,
it's like all these important things.
Right.
And you let it ride.
Oh yeah,

674
00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:59.160
they're here.
That's another story.
When I was like,
am I think I was 27 right.

675
00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:01.640
And Lord said to me,
I said something about,
you know,

676
00:40:01.641 --> 00:40:04.760
I took things way more personal.
Of course you do.
Yeah.
And then you go,
oh yeah,

677
00:40:04.761 --> 00:40:08.660
that's not my thing.
He said,
I said something in there.
It goes,
yeah,

678
00:40:08.661 --> 00:40:12.660
but I'm here every night.
And in my mind I thought,
well,
Duh,

679
00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:13.880
I'm here every night too.

680
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:18.560
But I didn't really know what that meant for a man to say,
Hey,

681
00:40:18.561 --> 00:40:21.980
I'm going to really try to be with one woman.
Yeah.
They're giving you all,

682
00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:25.760
most of what they got.
Yeah.
They give you like 80% yup.
And for a woman,

683
00:40:25.761 --> 00:40:29.150
maybe she's giving you a 35.
Right.
So it's like to understand,

684
00:40:29.151 --> 00:40:32.380
to like understand people's language on how they give.
Yeah.

685
00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:37.310
Let's say I was very shy and I came out and I was having a very nice,
you know,

686
00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.480
sort of conversation with you.

687
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:43.160
Maybe I'm giving you 200% because of my nature.
Exactly.

688
00:40:43.161 --> 00:40:46.250
So I think it's also starting to understand who they are.

689
00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:49.730
They're giving how they can give and receiving it that way.

690
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:52.040
But don't try to change them because I always tell my friends,

691
00:40:52.041 --> 00:40:54.440
if you want to be with a king,
you have to treat them like a king.

692
00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:58.250
And if you're always like done and do that,
there are a pile in the corner.

693
00:40:58.310 --> 00:40:59.143
Exactly.

694
00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:03.810
<v 6>Brian,
I'm going to shift gears for a second here.
What is the,</v>

695
00:41:03.811 --> 00:41:05.340
this is going to be a jarring transition,

696
00:41:05.341 --> 00:41:09.030
but that's my specialty as an interviewer.
Uh,

697
00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:13.770
awkward segues your most gifted book.
What book?

698
00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.500
And I'm going to ask you guys the same question.
What gift,

699
00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:18.390
what book or books have you gifted the most other people?

700
00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:22.713
<v 0>Okay.</v>

701
00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:27.240
<v 6>That it's probably between two.
All right.
A doubt.</v>

702
00:41:27.241 --> 00:41:31.920
A chain or um,
the,
ah,

703
00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:33.890
it's Dan Millman.
Uh,

704
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.920
<v 5>way,
way of the peaceful warrior's way of the peaceful warrior.
Cool.</v>

705
00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:41.210
That's like a starter for anybody.
Like I mentor our work with like,

706
00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:44.200
who's looking why?
Why is that a start or what?
Uh,
uh,

707
00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:49.070
because it takes you from a basic like,
hey,
here's what's going on too.
Like,

708
00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:54.080
here's like potential here.
Got It.
Ultimate potential.
Like you can't fathom that,

709
00:41:54.081 --> 00:41:56.180
but if you continue to put one foot in front of the other,

710
00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:01.580
you can achieve these things.
You can do what you set your mind out to,

711
00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.640
right.
If you're willing to take those steps,
it may not happen tomorrow,

712
00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:08.540
but it can happen.
Um,
and I,

713
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:13.190
I think that aging is just,
once you get to a certain level,
it's like,

714
00:42:13.191 --> 00:42:17.990
wow.
Like every little piece is like,
whoa.

715
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:22.700
Layers upon layers upon layers that can make sense at any point and of the day

716
00:42:22.701 --> 00:42:26.180
for me at this point,
you know?
And that's,
I think the beauty in it.
Cool.

717
00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:27.680
Thank you,
Gabby.

718
00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:33.780
<v 4>Oh my goodness.
I think
I,
you know,
I,
I then,</v>

719
00:42:33.781 --> 00:42:35.110
this sounds ridiculous,

720
00:42:35.111 --> 00:42:39.640
but I read atlas shrugged when I was 15 and I gave that book to a lot of people

721
00:42:39.850 --> 00:42:43.810
because it shifted just sort of how I looked at certain things.

722
00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:46.120
And obviously on the simple read,

723
00:42:46.121 --> 00:42:49.210
I think I've given the alchemist to quite a lot of young people because it's

724
00:42:49.211 --> 00:42:50.140
that reminder

725
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:55.600
as you go out in the world and you're looking for all these things,
um,

726
00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:59.710
that sometimes it is within us or right.
You know,
again,

727
00:42:59.711 --> 00:43:03.170
we laugh like we're back on quietly.
I grew up on coy,
you know,

728
00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:06.580
it's like you go around the whole world and sometimes what you're looking for is

729
00:43:06.581 --> 00:43:11.320
right in front of you.
Yeah.
And I think it's more true to the idea of even,

730
00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:15.190
um,
something about yourself or marriage or whatever.
It's like,

731
00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.740
it's just right there.
You just have to work at it.

732
00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:22.650
<v 5>With atlas shrugged,
it's very popular in Silicon Valley.
Of course.
It's very,</v>

733
00:43:22.651 --> 00:43:26.310
very popular.
Uh,
I was 15 when I read that book.
That's a big book.

734
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:30.930
That's it.
That's a big book to tackle person when I was younger.

735
00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:34.820
What did,
uh,
I mean,
is,
um,

736
00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:37.980
is that still a book that you would give to people or is that just for a period

737
00:43:37.981 --> 00:43:38.720
of time?

738
00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.240
<v 4>I think it was,
I was in my,
the world is not as,</v>

739
00:43:41.241 --> 00:43:44.810
it seems a phase in my life,
you know,

740
00:43:44.811 --> 00:43:47.180
probably till I was about 23 or four.

741
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:50.270
But I think it's just sort of a good reminder about,

742
00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:53.480
it's not about not taking things at face value,

743
00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:56.810
but it's about maybe creating your own truth because we don't,

744
00:43:56.811 --> 00:43:58.770
we can't really figure it out any other truth.
Right.

745
00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:01.250
And the objective truth that applies to everyone.

746
00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:05.360
So I think I certainly would give it now,
but maybe I would give other books now.

747
00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:06.383
Got It.

748
00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:10.110
<v 7>Blared well,
I'm going to go big here.</v>

749
00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:15.330
At one point I felt there was only one book in,
in,
in my opinion,
in the world,

750
00:44:15.331 --> 00:44:19.740
which was the Bible.
Okay.
And,
uh,
and I,
and I've been through quite a few times.

751
00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:24.690
And you were,
you raised religious?
No.
You were nuts.
No.
All right.
And,

752
00:44:24.691 --> 00:44:28.920
uh,
but that's where I found the truth.
Did I found that,
that,

753
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:31.020
and I found that and now you didn't gift it as,

754
00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:35.970
as that I gifted the teachings in it.
And I think the parables are such a,

755
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:38.790
I love parable teaching because it's so tangible.

756
00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:43.350
But when you look at just the basis of what you know,
and,
and I,

757
00:44:43.351 --> 00:44:46.500
and what I find is that when you find the truth,

758
00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:50.460
it doesn't matter what the religion is because the truth is a golden thread that

759
00:44:50.461 --> 00:44:54.130
winds its way through all kinds of stuff.
And so,
uh,

760
00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:59.210
that's just was the first book that I found a lot of truth in it and that,

761
00:44:59.641 --> 00:45:02.290
and then I was able to share that with people,
parables and,

762
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:04.590
and then you run into so many situations in your life,

763
00:45:04.591 --> 00:45:08.190
and if you just look at basically the 10 commandments and you live that way,

764
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:12.390
it would increase the quality of your life.
Now,
you know,
as a young kid,

765
00:45:12.391 --> 00:45:16.980
books that had the most influence on me,
you know,
I mean,
uh,
you know,

766
00:45:16.981 --> 00:45:20.250
the Lord of the rings was like a huge thing when I was young.

767
00:45:20.251 --> 00:45:24.510
My mom read those books to me and,
and uh,
where like before I could even read.

768
00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:27.680
And so I went through the trilogy of those as a young man and,
you know,

769
00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:31.530
Jonathan Livingston,
seagull and the Dune and all these other fantasy books.
But,

770
00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:35.820
but the Bible really,
I mean,
that thing just had,
you know,

771
00:45:35.821 --> 00:45:37.830
and then now if you came,
if you asked me today like,

772
00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:41.310
what book am I gifting everybody today?
Well,
I'm,
I'm,

773
00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:44.760
I'm gifting a natural born heroes,
you know,
like,
that's my,

774
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:49.550
that's my book of the year.
We have a book club in our clan,

775
00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:54.210
book comedy
or in the gym.

776
00:45:54.211 --> 00:45:57.450
We trained together and then made the book of the week or the book of the month.

777
00:45:57.451 --> 00:45:59.720
And we ever,
you know,
whoever gets one,
we go and,
you know,

778
00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:04.730
of course Rick is always a big contributor to the hunches hooked barkers and I'm

779
00:46:05.251 --> 00:46:09.530
just,
everybody's contributing,
you know?
Uh,
and they'll all get it survivals,

780
00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:14.220
another great deep survival,
Lawrence Gonzalez.
That's an incredible book.

781
00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:14.860
Um,

782
00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:19.770
and speaking about just fear and dealing with dealing with fear.

783
00:46:19.771 --> 00:46:21.690
But this natural born heroes is my,

784
00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:26.010
that's my latest kind of crazy just because of,
you know,
again,

785
00:46:26.011 --> 00:46:30.510
but all of these all fic,
I mean,
all,
all,
uh,
you know,

786
00:46:30.511 --> 00:46:33.600
not know fiction and nonfiction,
nonfiction truth.

787
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:38.040
It's all because I don't it the way my mind works.
I don't want,
I don't want,

788
00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:39.800
I mean if someone,

789
00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:43.110
like I had the fiction when I was young to create imagination and fantasy,

790
00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:47.310
but really what I,
I,
hunger is truth.
Like what is the truth?

791
00:46:47.311 --> 00:46:50.610
What are facts give me information that I can apply.

792
00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:53.480
I want to be able to apply this stuff to life.
So here's,

793
00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:57.780
here's a question about some truths and testing truth that I'm really curious to

794
00:46:57.781 --> 00:47:01.980
ask you.
And that is a,
you're just testing stuff.
You know,

795
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:05.120
I every once in a while,
every once in a while know that,
you know,

796
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:08.730
walking around with a drip bag attached to me occasionally.

797
00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:11.143
Uh,

798
00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:15.450
you're known as an innovator in the sort of water sports world,

799
00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:19.620
whether it's towing,
surfing,
a foil board,
uh,

800
00:47:19.621 --> 00:47:23.940
or any number of other things.
Golf,
no exact land now.
Exactly.
So,
but he's,

801
00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:27.720
he's evolved,
it's grown legs,
moved under land.
Uh,

802
00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:32.960
what is enabled to contribute in that way because people have been playing in

803
00:47:34.691 --> 00:47:39.310
the water for a very long time.
Uh,
w w w what is the,

804
00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:44.290
what are the characteristics or the moments that led to you being able to have

805
00:47:44.291 --> 00:47:46.540
these breakthroughs of the,
or contribute to these innovations?

806
00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.690
I think a combination of a couple things.
It's,
I think there's a,

807
00:47:49.691 --> 00:47:53.800
for a little bit of a formula that I've been fortunate enough to be subjected to

808
00:47:53.801 --> 00:47:58.150
through how I was raised in,
and then,
uh,
you know,
like again,

809
00:47:58.300 --> 00:47:59.950
being exposed to,
you know,

810
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:05.100
the Lord of the rings in Dune in some of these really incredible imagination.

811
00:48:05.141 --> 00:48:09.580
So development of imagination.
But you know,
Thomas Edison is quoted as saying,

812
00:48:09.581 --> 00:48:13.060
you know,
all you need to be an inventor is an imagination and a pile of junk.

813
00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:16.000
Right?
And so,
you know,
when I lived at the end of a road that you know,

814
00:48:16.001 --> 00:48:19.680
where you didn't call people to fix stuff,
you fixed it and you know,

815
00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:22.180
you didn't have anything that was,
you couldn't go buy stuff.

816
00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:25.420
You had to make stuff.
And so you,
you know,
and then I grew up in a,

817
00:48:25.421 --> 00:48:28.360
in a way where I was,
you know,
there was racial thing we could.

818
00:48:28.361 --> 00:48:31.630
So I was not like for how I was born.
Right?
So then I would be like,

819
00:48:31.631 --> 00:48:34.570
well why would I be worried about what people think when I do something that

820
00:48:34.571 --> 00:48:37.510
makes him upset?
Right?
They're already upset.

821
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:40.360
They were upset for how I would want.
So some of those things,
you know,

822
00:48:40.361 --> 00:48:42.470
where you have an imagination and you're not working,

823
00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.830
you know you're willing to subject yourself to failure.
Right?

824
00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:45.760
That's a big part of it.

825
00:48:45.761 --> 00:48:49.900
Of any innovation you've got to willing to crash and burn and at the cost of

826
00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:52.600
looking like a fool,
people laughing at you and you just,

827
00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:56.500
and not letting that dictate what you do.
I think peer pressure,
you know,
if,
if,

828
00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:59.470
if it was up to other people,
they wouldn't let you do anything.
No,

829
00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:02.800
we didn't create anything because that we all watch that watch a stupid,

830
00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:05.530
whether it's your dad or,
you know what I mean?
I used to have,

831
00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:09.090
I had a teacher tell me once in school,
you can't eat your surfboard,
you know,

832
00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:11.690
or you're not,
you can't eat.
You're a boy.
You can have your cert though.

833
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:13.900
Meaning you're not like,
that's not going to pay the bills.
No,

834
00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:15.190
you're not ever going to make a life out of,

835
00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:19.250
out of using that or I'm just saying.
But those are all the,
you know,
when you say

836
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:22.450
worst advice ever,

837
00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:28.000
or maybe you take that as fuel wrong guy to say that all I'll show you are,
but,

838
00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:32.140
but so I think it's,
I'll,
I'll,
I think a lot of those are a lot of the factors,

839
00:49:32.141 --> 00:49:35.800
right?
It's those,
those are the key elements.
I think if you look at any,

840
00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:40.300
anybody who's willing to subject themselves to failure and,
and,
and,

841
00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.850
<v 4>and,
and relentless pursuit,</v>

842
00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:46.140
understanding that list that don sits in the wheel house,

843
00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:50.010
it is like it's not going away.

844
00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:53.880
It's not going away and talk about it and write a book,
write it down.

845
00:49:53.881 --> 00:49:57.200
So give me an example of,
of noxious,

846
00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:03.560
I mean the obsessiveness or the persistent because it isn't,

847
00:50:03.601 --> 00:50:06.030
it's weird.
It's not so destructively obsessive,

848
00:50:06.031 --> 00:50:08.610
but it's just this tone that you'd kind of noticed.
You and God,

849
00:50:08.611 --> 00:50:12.870
that's still there.
Huh?
Is um,
standup paddling.
Okay.

850
00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:17.510
So 1998 or seven or so,
Laird decided I'm going to,

851
00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.930
you know,
try that.
It's another way to train.

852
00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:25.900
He was on long board using Kayak paddles and then taping handles and then be

853
00:50:25.901 --> 00:50:26.111
free.

854
00:50:26.111 --> 00:50:30.020
You know what we're driving to some house who is asked to Malama is that it was

855
00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:33.470
and on Maui,
like extended what in paddle.

856
00:50:33.471 --> 00:50:37.310
So he did for the canoe paddle is in Hawaii.
So Larry went to him and said,
oh,

857
00:50:37.311 --> 00:50:42.170
can you make it longer?
And then breaking that one and breaking another one.

858
00:50:42.171 --> 00:50:46.490
And then,
you know,
just trying new boards and oh that guy doesn't have boards,

859
00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:49.460
blanks big enough for standup paddleboard.
So I've got to find a guy,

860
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:52.010
oh there's a guy in San Diego,
just like going nonstop,

861
00:50:52.011 --> 00:50:54.890
nonstop break things go out and just,

862
00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:59.480
and then on top of it do it every day.
Like down winter,
you know,

863
00:50:59.481 --> 00:51:04.340
another down wonder like,
so in Maui when it's went to windy,
if this,
you know,

864
00:51:04.341 --> 00:51:08.420
to serve,
maybe that means a winds probably up and in Mali it's very windy.

865
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:09.530
So he you,

866
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:12.800
he gets dropped off at one point and then goes with the wind down and stand up

867
00:51:12.801 --> 00:51:15.890
paddling.
And that was really one of the best first things that he used it for.

868
00:51:15.891 --> 00:51:18.200
And then,
you know,
you incorporated surfing later.

869
00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:23.840
But I mean just persistent and constant everyday.
Even foiling,

870
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:25.370
I really,
if I look at foiling,

871
00:51:25.371 --> 00:51:29.420
it's like layered ultimately has been practicing rigorously for the last seven

872
00:51:29.421 --> 00:51:31.100
years,
quietly,

873
00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:35.180
patiently to get a ride and maybe another ride coming.

874
00:51:35.181 --> 00:51:38.240
But a ride that he had this winter on a wave that he's been secretly thinking

875
00:51:38.241 --> 00:51:40.730
about probably for 40 years of his life.

876
00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:45.560
So there's a patients but a relentlessness that I'm like,
wow,

877
00:51:45.561 --> 00:51:48.820
that is Kudos to you,
that you can hang in there and do it.

878
00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:53.410
<v 3>So
are you that simple that you just can't,</v>

879
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:56.060
I mean it's pretty impressive though.

880
00:51:56.110 --> 00:52:00.290
I mean youth of course they'll have exhibited.
No,
no,
it's very different.

881
00:52:00.291 --> 00:52:03.500
I would never different because you've achieved a lot in many different areas.

882
00:52:03.501 --> 00:52:04.670
So how was it different?

883
00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:06.090
<v 4>It says like,
I'm s,
you know,</v>

884
00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:11.420
Sterno I'm a low steady flame layer goes at it at a different degree.

885
00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:16.040
He gets there much quicker for very long period of time.
Yeah.
And it,

886
00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:21.060
and also just physically that he can express himself for that kind of endurance

887
00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:26.230
is different.
A lot of mine is mental.
It's a different,
it's just different.
Um,

888
00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:28.920
but I really respect that.
And Laird,

889
00:52:28.921 --> 00:52:32.040
because also he does it when no one's watching.
He doesn't tell any,

890
00:52:32.041 --> 00:52:35.070
he does not talking about it unless it's to have a conversation about how to

891
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:39.540
approach it,
attack and improve it.
And so it is a very personal,

892
00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:43.710
um,
quest that he's on for his reasons of his own.

893
00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:49.040
Um,
like one day we were driving up a PCH and there was like literally all these

894
00:52:49.041 --> 00:52:51.960
standup paddle is out there and I can remember clearly when it was layered,

895
00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:56.250
dragging his one friend lock out there for seven or eight years before anyone

896
00:52:56.251 --> 00:52:59.010
was stand up paddling.
And I said,
how does that make you feel?
And he goes,

897
00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:03.630
I knew I was having so much fun.
So it was never the idea of like,
oh,

898
00:53:03.631 --> 00:53:07.110
I'm going to somehow bring this into modern day.
It was,

899
00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:11.280
I'm doing this for myself because I have an idea that I want to express.

900
00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:15.720
And so it's one of the things I appreciate or will it bring me fun and joy and

901
00:53:15.721 --> 00:53:17.040
enjoyment straight up.

902
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:20.050
<v 3>So part of the reason you guys are happy,</v>

903
00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:24.550
it's that Semyon high on the list are you're laughing Laird.

904
00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:25.860
So what's what's happening over there?

905
00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:31.560
<v 7>Could you explain to people also because the,
the foil boarding,
now this is,</v>

906
00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:35.310
takes my like,
fear factor,
do a whole new level because you're basically,

907
00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.050
well why don't you explain it for folks,

908
00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:40.020
but it's not like you just jumped off the board if things are going sideways.

909
00:53:40.021 --> 00:53:44.190
Right?
I mean you're,
you're a cat.
So what was Samurai Sword?
What does it,

910
00:53:44.191 --> 00:53:46.580
what does it foil board,
which a,
it's a,
it's a,

911
00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:49.210
a surfboard or just a board,

912
00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:54.480
like a wakeboard with a big strike,
like a foil,
which is,

913
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:57.960
you know,
you see the America's Cup guys are using them and it's a big,

914
00:53:57.961 --> 00:54:02.730
it's a big shaggy feet,
three feet long by 48 inches beneath the board.

915
00:54:02.731 --> 00:54:05.050
But eat the board.
It's like a big fin.
It's a hybrid.

916
00:54:05.051 --> 00:54:07.950
It's a big thing that makes the board fly off the water,
but you're attached to,

917
00:54:07.951 --> 00:54:10.980
it was snowboard boots and bindings.
Um,
which,
you know,

918
00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:14.250
you don't swim well with boots and,
uh,
but it's,

919
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:17.580
it's something that we've kind of came upon as,

920
00:54:17.581 --> 00:54:19.500
as you know,

921
00:54:19.501 --> 00:54:22.980
all of it's about an evolution to try to ride the biggest surf in the world.

922
00:54:22.981 --> 00:54:25.710
And so we first we started and,
uh,
you know,

923
00:54:25.711 --> 00:54:29.250
with prone guns conventionally and then what I'm prone gun,

924
00:54:29.251 --> 00:54:32.920
like when you lay down on these big guns and then we knew that the,

925
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:36.810
the size of the border,
when is a gun?
It's designed for giant waves too long.

926
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.870
It's what,
it's what all the,
you know,

927
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:44.580
the modern manual way to catch waves.
Got It.
And it's an ancient way of doing it,

928
00:54:44.581 --> 00:54:47.410
but it's the,
you know,
we found a cap and we should,

929
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:50.220
and we realized there was a ceiling and then that,
and then we,

930
00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:53.910
and that's because of the bigger waves move faster or bigger waves move faster.

931
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:58.500
We're not able to physically keep up,
keep up.
And,
and that's where the con,

932
00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:00.480
the concept of towing came from.

933
00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:05.760
The idea of being towed onto one and using the power to match the speed of the

934
00:55:05.761 --> 00:55:08.970
wave in order to ride bigger surf.
And when we did that,
it made us,

935
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.950
allowed us to ride smaller equipment that was actually faster and then we could

936
00:55:13.951 --> 00:55:16.680
perform on these giant ways.
And when you say giant,

937
00:55:16.681 --> 00:55:19.740
just for people who may not be familiar with big wave surfing,
what is what,

938
00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:24.630
what are we talking?
Well,
I mean,
you know,
you start giant,
giant starts at,

939
00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:29.250
you know,
at,
at,
at 50 foot faces and then we go,
then it goes above,

940
00:55:29.251 --> 00:55:33.920
so 60 70 80 foot faces.
I mean,
that's giant,
big surface.
You know,

941
00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:35.970
when we say it's big,
it's 50 and below.

942
00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:38.250
And then when he goes to giant and then it,

943
00:55:38.330 --> 00:55:42.870
and then it goes to like read ridiculous,
enormous,
you know,
whatever.

944
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:45.930
There's giant,
there's big,
there's giant,
there's enormous,
you know,

945
00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:50.690
and then everybody can get into,
it's 82.5 feet and all that stuff.
But,
but we,

946
00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:54.210
we found a cap,
you know,
at manual.
Then we found a cap.

947
00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:57.930
Ultimately we found a cap with Tony.
Tony,
what's the,

948
00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:02.280
where's the cap at about?
Probably about,
uh,
and,
and the range of 100 feet.

949
00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:05.760
So that's,
that's,
that's,
and we know there's a cap there.

950
00:56:05.761 --> 00:56:08.520
We know that there's an ability,
he knows because he's been there.

951
00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:14.670
So we know there's a cap.
And so at that point in the continual pursuit,

952
00:56:14.671 --> 00:56:17.490
it was how do we get,
we're,
what are we going to need to do?

953
00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:21.120
And we know that the only way we can do that is to not be on the surface.

954
00:56:21.121 --> 00:56:24.670
Because surface tension is the thing that creates the most drag,

955
00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:29.680
which is what is stopping us when once the waves are moving at a certain speed.

956
00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.510
How did you do the,

957
00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:37.810
what was the moment or the conversation or the event where it's like,
Holy Shit,

958
00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:41.280
like we could do this.
Like,
because the idea of putting the strut and the,

959
00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:44.380
you know,
having that foil like fact on a board,

960
00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:49.270
it hadn't occurred previously.
So what,
well no,
it actually,
there was,
it was,

961
00:56:49.271 --> 00:56:52.630
you know,
it's none of the steps.
I always say every,
there's no new idea,

962
00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:57.310
just a new application of an old idea.
So this,
uh,
there is,
uh,
a seated,

963
00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:01.930
a seated foil called an air chair in the garage on Maui.

964
00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:04.960
And one summer we were playing around in,
some of my friend goes,
oh,

965
00:57:04.961 --> 00:57:08.220
this guy's got this weird contraption.
So we went over the house,

966
00:57:08.221 --> 00:57:11.940
it was in the corner,
had dust on it,
cobwebs,
and be like,
Hey,
what's that?
Oh,

967
00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:14.050
some stupid thing called an air chair.
I mean,

968
00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:17.290
it wasn't bad enough that he would let us keep it,

969
00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:19.570
but we got it and we wrote it and we were,

970
00:57:19.571 --> 00:57:22.580
and what were you being towed behind something and you're strapped to it by

971
00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:26.090
Murphy created it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you're strapped to it with a seat.

972
00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:29.770
And I thought it was for handicapped initially because the position was very,

973
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.960
your strap
and that's a big institute.
People behind boats with them.

974
00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:37.950
Yeah.
And now they have a new one.
Now they have,

975
00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:42.130
while the sky ski where they do flips and people ride these things and do

976
00:57:42.131 --> 00:57:46.750
amazing things on them.
And you towed behind a boat,
like a Waterski boat.
And uh,

977
00:57:46.751 --> 00:57:49.430
and so we got one.
And the first thing that we,

978
00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:54.220
we wanted to do was stand on it because we go,
listen,
seeding is again,

979
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:57.420
part of our mottoes,
you know,
stand up,
stand up on the golf boards,

980
00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:00.940
standup on standup paddling,
stand up,
like standing up is better position to be.

981
00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:04.660
And we're humans,
you know,
city,
it's not great.
Crawling is not wonderful.

982
00:58:04.661 --> 00:58:07.720
Laying down is even worse.
So we,
uh,
you know,

983
00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:12.250
so we started to stand on it and as soon as we stood on and we go,
oh,

984
00:58:12.251 --> 00:58:15.520
we can stand on.
I mean,
it wasn't,
it was hard because we were,
you know,

985
00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:19.240
using the seat and kind of,
and we didn't have bindings.
And so,
uh,

986
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:22.690
I asked him is extremely precarious,
very bad,
and it's got,

987
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:25.360
and it has a big sharp blade on the bottom of it.

988
00:58:25.361 --> 00:58:27.270
So it's not something you don't want to be attached to it,

989
00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:31.810
because if the thing comes around,
it's,
you know,
it could be a bad,
the reaper,

990
00:58:31.850 --> 00:58:35.950
there's a problem.
And,
uh,
but so then we just took,
we took that and uh,

991
00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:40.000
and we asked the guy if it was okay if we,
if we,
uh,

992
00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:43.570
played with it as long as we didn't damage any of it.
And he said sure.

993
00:58:43.571 --> 00:58:47.740
So I took the foil out of the board and I took a wakeboard and we made kind of a

994
00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:52.420
make shift,
uh,
housing so that the foil could fit on there.
And I,
and I,

995
00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:55.840
and I put snowboard boots on it cause we had been doing a lot of snowboarding

996
00:58:56.620 --> 00:59:01.000
and we booted ourselves to it and w and within the first air to all of a sudden

997
00:59:01.001 --> 00:59:02.500
we're standing on this thing of flying.

998
00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:06.640
And as soon as we student flew and we knew we could control it,
we were like,

999
00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:09.880
oh no,
we have to go on.
The waves were like,
this is going to be,

1000
00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:12.180
this is going to be for waiver.
But did you talk,

1001
00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:16.360
you tow behind a ski or a boat for like almost three years,
maybe more.

1002
00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:19.450
And flatwater they'll learn lots of practice.

1003
00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:22.250
Not to mention where are you messing around with the hippity hop?

1004
00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:25.670
<v 3>Wasn't that the hippity hop or is that for tow surfing?
No,</v>

1005
00:59:25.671 --> 00:59:29.260
the hippity hop was for that was flotation device.
What is the idea?

1006
00:59:29.490 --> 00:59:33.230
There used to go out in front of our house in Maui and let the hippity hop and

1007
00:59:33.231 --> 00:59:36.320
he would try to do it with spare air.
I'm so lost.

1008
00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:41.060
What does the hippity hop knows?
I have no idea what anybody

1009
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:44.270
knows the light but no,

1010
00:59:44.271 --> 00:59:49.271
that's a giant ball when you're [inaudible] it's a,

1011
00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:56.180
it's a physio ball with a kettlebell horns and like the face of a horse on it or

1012
00:59:56.181 --> 00:59:59.780
so 30 is to take those,
fold them up really small and attach you to spare air,

1013
00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:03.110
which is like basically one shot of air if you're for diver or somebody under.

1014
01:00:03.111 --> 01:00:03.620
Yeah,

1015
01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:08.620
and in case he was trying to figure out ways to have water proof location and

1016
01:00:09.681 --> 01:00:10.640
we're in the giant surf.

1017
01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.180
We were still kind of searching for flotation because we were worried about

1018
01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:17.420
brief flotation.
You mean like the pre,

1019
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:20.630
pre a LifeVest I guess.
Yeah.

1020
01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:23.600
But this was pre us using life vests in giant surf.

1021
01:00:23.601 --> 01:00:25.900
Now it's now it's everybody.

1022
01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:29.280
Flotation devices in the giants here.

1023
01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:34.370
Let's just say there's a lot of stages between like now layered is riding with

1024
01:00:34.371 --> 01:00:36.650
Terry and they're doing it in Kohai two,

1025
01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:41.240
three or four years behind boats and you know,
skis,
skis,

1026
01:00:41.241 --> 01:00:44.750
one broken one broken ties.
Because we were in the beginning of the,

1027
01:00:44.751 --> 01:00:48.960
of the conception of guiding as well.
Yeah.
So we we kind of warning yeah,

1028
01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:50.083
that we start,

1029
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:54.590
I mean more or less the modern toe board is what made kiteboarding possible

1030
01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:56.930
initially.
And then the wake came in after,

1031
01:00:56.931 --> 01:00:59.000
but we were the first ones that get the French,

1032
01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.170
the notch restartable the non-recyclable here,

1033
01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:05.720
let's talk about it where you just release the guy and he'd just fly as far as

1034
01:01:05.721 --> 01:01:06.650
he could until he cracked it.

1035
01:01:06.651 --> 01:01:10.130
Then it was over over and sometimes you'd be like two miles out to sea with a

1036
01:01:10.131 --> 01:01:13.040
giant quilt you've ever tried to swim with a quilt.

1037
01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:15.020
It's very hard like a giant quilt.

1038
01:01:17.350 --> 01:01:19.190
The quilt and the lunch tray.

1039
01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:22.790
So literally the board wants like a lunch tray and a quilt and it's like you're

1040
01:01:22.791 --> 01:01:24.920
two miles out and you're looking at the shore and you're like,

1041
01:01:25.790 --> 01:01:28.520
this is not a good day.
I mean he was good until you crashed.
And then

1042
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:34.820
how does the hip with the rabbit phase fit into all this?
Because it's all,

1043
01:01:34.821 --> 01:01:38.480
I'm just saying it was all part of like simultaneously trying to figure out the

1044
01:01:38.481 --> 01:01:42.730
equipment and how to ride it and use it,
how to be safer and make it possible.

1045
01:01:42.731 --> 01:01:45.030
Would she be like on the foil board with the Hippie town?

1046
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:46.970
It's where this lady's are smart for that.

1047
01:01:46.971 --> 01:01:50.730
He'd be with it folded up and then he'd go out where there was some,

1048
01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:54.740
we know Whitewater messing around and then he didn't implode,

1049
01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:58.430
dropped off and then pull it and then it would pop up and now it started just

1050
01:01:58.431 --> 01:02:01.760
seeing if it was okay.
So We'd have a pre inflated you to the off type dog waste.

1051
01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:05.870
So then we weed,
we get dropped off in front of a giant wave and then,

1052
01:02:05.871 --> 01:02:08.720
but we realized that the hippity hop and just bang you in the head and so,

1053
01:02:08.721 --> 01:02:11.940
and you come up and you'd be face down in the hippie hop would be out of the

1054
01:02:11.941 --> 01:02:16.580
water but you would still be under.
So we stopped the hippity hop.

1055
01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.040
This goes back to like what she was

1056
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.130
<v 5>talking about with his,</v>

1057
01:02:21.131 --> 01:02:23.910
and you know the whole incessant like I'm just going to do this.

1058
01:02:23.911 --> 01:02:27.270
But here's the thing is I actually know guys who have taken,

1059
01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:31.920
who have attempted to do the foil boarding and they just gave up because they're

1060
01:02:31.921 --> 01:02:33.300
like,
it's too hard.
It's too difficult.

1061
01:02:33.301 --> 01:02:38.040
They did not have the patience or the time to want to invest themselves into

1062
01:02:38.041 --> 01:02:41.790
something which is like,
which is also why a lot of this stuff just works.

1063
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:45.570
Like with the relationships that they have and even the relationship I have with

1064
01:02:45.571 --> 01:02:49.020
them.
Is it,
it is a,
it's a commitment.
It's a full commitment.

1065
01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:50.040
Now why do you think,

1066
01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:55.160
why do you think w Laird has the sticktuitiveness when these other people don't?

1067
01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:56.970
Do you think it's a,
and I'm not,

1068
01:02:56.971 --> 01:02:58.840
I won't make it totally multiple choice questions.

1069
01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:01.140
These are the options kind of running through my head,
right?

1070
01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:05.520
Just having observed how you guys live.
Like is it something innate possible,

1071
01:03:05.521 --> 01:03:08.310
right?
Is it influences that he's had?

1072
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:13.430
Is it the peer group that he surrounds himself with or some other factor?

1073
01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:20.060
We're all see all of the above because like I grew up in a very similar fashion,

1074
01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:24.780
um,
where I was very rebellious where I was told I wasn't going to be able to do

1075
01:03:24.781 --> 01:03:27.570
things.
I didn't,
I,
I screwed around.
I did.

1076
01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:31.230
And now it's like you come around full circle to that where you learn how to get

1077
01:03:31.231 --> 01:03:32.940
good at what something you were good at.

1078
01:03:33.330 --> 01:03:37.710
And where he learned early on is what it seems is that,
wow,
this worked,

1079
01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:42.200
this happened.
I'm making a living off of surfing or whatever.
That was that like,

1080
01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:46.160
and he's not doing it in a contest.
He's doing it on his own.
Like,
Eh,

1081
01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:50.910
she's grown up in an environment where it wasn't the greatest family environment

1082
01:03:50.911 --> 01:03:55.110
to where she's thriving and they've,
they've created this whole thing where,

1083
01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:58.050
you know,
I was able to do things that I shouldn't.

1084
01:03:58.110 --> 01:04:03.000
Like I was told I wasn't going to do and I did and it was because of the,

1085
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:07.410
I was so passionate about what I was doing and I was willing to commit to that

1086
01:04:07.411 --> 01:04:11.700
and continue to see the results of what that brought,
that that became,
oh,

1087
01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.010
this is what makes sense.
You know what I mean?

1088
01:04:14.011 --> 01:04:17.880
I just wrote something on an Instagram post yesterday kind of about this where

1089
01:04:17.881 --> 01:04:22.440
it's like if you don't have the ability to pay attention enough to your training

1090
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:25.110
that to understand what rest is,

1091
01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:29.640
you're now in an OCD like behavior to where it's like you don't even understand

1092
01:04:29.641 --> 01:04:32.850
how you're going to get better at something where it's just paying attention and

1093
01:04:32.851 --> 01:04:35.970
it's like,
hey,
if I'm assuming if you see it as hey,
you said a key thing,

1094
01:04:35.971 --> 01:04:39.930
they're paying attention but but also paying attention but also part of paying

1095
01:04:39.931 --> 01:04:44.931
attention is being aware of what's happening and seeing it before it's done.

1096
01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:49.770
And so I mean at the end it's about envisioning it too.
Right?

1097
01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:53.910
You can see what you have to be able to see it to continue to pursue it.
Okay.

1098
01:04:53.911 --> 01:04:56.970
This is a really is a super important point.
So for yourself,

1099
01:04:56.971 --> 01:05:01.530
what would be an example of that?
Of seeing it and being able to,
well,

1100
01:05:01.531 --> 01:05:04.890
just any,
any one of the things I've been involved with.
So knowing,

1101
01:05:04.891 --> 01:05:09.630
knowing like for example,
we were able to foil some giant surf this this season.

1102
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:12.420
Now we,
up until then,
we haven't really ever been,

1103
01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:14.490
I was in doubt of being able to,

1104
01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:18.760
even though [inaudible] in instinctually knew that this,

1105
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.620
this is definitely the way to do this,
this is the DA,
but I didn't,

1106
01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:27.970
I haven't seen it,
you know,
and,
and again,
uh,
it's,
it's that,

1107
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.550
it's that ability to,
to see,
see it before it's

1108
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:35.440
to note to know it,

1109
01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:39.310
and then you have all those other things that you need to pursue,
but you got to,

1110
01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:43.960
you have to actually be able to see it welling up.
Oswaldo view motivated.

1111
01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:47.290
Yeah.
And,
uh,
so Brian,

1112
01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:49.720
I have a question for you because you've,

1113
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:51.910
you've worked with so many athletes and uh,
you know,

1114
01:05:51.911 --> 01:05:56.800
I might want to ask you guys the same question and that is,
uh,
and,
uh,
you know,

1115
01:05:56.801 --> 01:05:59.170
Kelly is an expert at this as well,
but,
uh,

1116
01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:04.240
what would your advice be to a,
say a,
it doesn't really matter.
The age,

1117
01:06:04.241 --> 01:06:08.740
30,
35,
40 doesn't matter.
But as a former athlete who's beating themselves up,

1118
01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:11.350
may or may not be me.
Uh,
no,
it's not me,

1119
01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.460
but somebody who's really just beaten the shit out of themselves,

1120
01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:20.080
who wants to either continue training or get back to the point where they're

1121
01:06:20.081 --> 01:06:23.110
competing and God knows what.
Right.
You've,

1122
01:06:23.111 --> 01:06:26.770
you've observed so many athletes,
um,

1123
01:06:26.830 --> 01:06:31.600
what should they do more of?
What should they do?
Less of?
More humility.

1124
01:06:32.110 --> 01:06:34.070
More humility.
Yeah.
What's everything?

1125
01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:38.140
That's why I thought it was so important that you come up here.
Yeah.
Was,

1126
01:06:38.141 --> 01:06:42.670
it wasn't,
oh,
tiny.
Did I need a dose,
Tim?
With humility?
It's no,
it's like,
hey,

1127
01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:48.150
come see what it's like to apply something that you can do for the rest of your

1128
01:06:48.161 --> 01:06:53.110
life.
Yup.
Yup.
If you can't see what you're doing,

1129
01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:58.620
if you think at 20 that I can just bang away and go as heavy as I want,

1130
01:06:58.961 --> 01:07:03.550
as hard as I want,
as long as I want.
And it's not going to have repercussions.

1131
01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:09.130
You're not looking at it correctly.
And I've been there,
I've done it.
I,

1132
01:07:09.131 --> 01:07:14.050
and I,
and,
and I think this,
this goes to like,
this also comes around to,

1133
01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:17.200
I've learned a lot in the fact that I know,
like for one,

1134
01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:19.000
I don't have the only program.

1135
01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:22.660
I don't like what I'm putting out isn't the only way.

1136
01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:27.760
There are a thousand ways it's,
Eh,
I,

1137
01:07:27.761 --> 01:07:30.880
it's no longer about me being right.
It's no,
and that,

1138
01:07:30.881 --> 01:07:34.480
that's a lot with what they're doing.
It's not about being right.
It's,

1139
01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:38.440
I see the potential of this and yeah,

1140
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:40.330
the world now knows standup paddle.

1141
01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:44.740
Like they now know it and it's not about I'm right.
This was me.

1142
01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:49.030
Like it's not that it's not,
you know,
I think it's,
we're,
as an athlete,

1143
01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:52.040
if you've beaten yourself up to the point to where it's like,
oh,

1144
01:07:52.270 --> 01:07:54.850
I've got to deal with this injury,
I've got to deal with this stuff.

1145
01:07:54.851 --> 01:07:59.710
I'm not what I used to be.
It's,
well,
you have a lifetime right now.

1146
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:04.330
What do you want to do?
Yeah.
Is it about winning?

1147
01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:07.810
Is it about being the best at something or is it about how,

1148
01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:12.400
how much better can I be tomorrow at what I'm doing today and can I just chip

1149
01:08:12.401 --> 01:08:16.130
away at a little of that?
And that is what they have,
not only I have learned

1150
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:18.650
<v 7>to surround myself with is people who are doing that,</v>

1151
01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:22.760
but that's what these two are doing.
That's what Kelly's doing.

1152
01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:27.110
That's what you've done with your career is you've literally immersed yourself

1153
01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:29.840
into an environment where you have bread.

1154
01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:35.140
I'm going to meet people who want to be in the long game and that's what it's

1155
01:08:35.961 --> 01:08:40.250
about.
And,
and it really ultimately comes down at,
and that is for life,

1156
01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:42.050
we call that train out is right kind of training,

1157
01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:45.650
getting training for life that yeah,
that's what the truth is.

1158
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:49.740
There's nothing further from that is this is what the truth is.
Can't be friends,

1159
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.440
professional athlete.
And you know,

1160
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:54.140
I mean I've a bunch of friends that are professionals,
but one particular one,

1161
01:08:54.141 --> 01:08:56.840
and we were talking about his training and everything and I said,
I go,

1162
01:08:57.470 --> 01:09:01.940
let me just say what my perspective is.
When I,
when you asked me about training

1163
01:09:03.450 --> 01:09:08.450
<v 8>train in a way so that when you're done playing you can go do all the things you</v>

1164
01:09:11.161 --> 01:09:11.994
want to do.

1165
01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:16.000
<v 7>And I don't mean sit around and drink whiskey and smoke cigars.</v>

1166
01:09:16.001 --> 01:09:18.400
I mean the things you want to do physically,

1167
01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.830
like all of the things you want to do.
So have a,

1168
01:09:20.831 --> 01:09:25.831
have a training routine and go about your playing so that when you're done doing

1169
01:09:25.901 --> 01:09:29.890
that
you can walk.
Maybe that'd be great.
How about you can run,

1170
01:09:30.010 --> 01:09:33.700
how about you can sweat how bay you can bike,
how about you can go water,
Ski,

1171
01:09:33.701 --> 01:09:35.110
Snow,
Ski,
who are,

1172
01:09:35.111 --> 01:09:38.380
whatever things you want to do because there's obviously some things you're

1173
01:09:38.381 --> 01:09:41.960
still going to want to do.
Right.
And,
and,
and so I think that's the,

1174
01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:44.620
the focus is right.
Like it's like training for life,

1175
01:09:44.621 --> 01:09:48.610
like training in a way that sustainable that you can handle.
Like you said,

1176
01:09:48.611 --> 01:09:51.940
you can't just take the hammering for the next 60 years and then wonder,

1177
01:09:51.941 --> 01:09:55.810
well man,
I can't even walk.
And even when you do it that way,
it's still,

1178
01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:59.770
you have to do all the pieces to,
you got to remember that,
you know,

1179
01:09:59.771 --> 01:10:04.240
as an athlete,
if you got to have,
it's the whole picture.

1180
01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:07.030
It's not just the physical,
it's the eating,
it's the sleeping,

1181
01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:09.880
it's the relationships,
it's all of those things.

1182
01:10:09.881 --> 01:10:12.280
What you're putting in your brain,
what you're putting in your mouth.

1183
01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:14.620
I mean these are all who you're hanging out with.

1184
01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:18.350
All of that stuff is going to feed into the performance.
Right.

1185
01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:22.000
So I noticed for instance,
one thing I had never seen before,

1186
01:10:22.001 --> 01:10:24.250
I've seen people roll out on foam rollers.

1187
01:10:24.251 --> 01:10:29.020
I've seen people roll out on weird looking,
uh,
devices that,
you know,

1188
01:10:29.021 --> 01:10:32.710
Kelly makes it look like sexual,
you know,
toys.
Uh,

1189
01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:36.610
I've never seen someone roll out on a weight plate before.

1190
01:10:36.850 --> 01:10:41.320
Well actually that Kelly Kelly brought that into it had the 45 pounds and I was

1191
01:10:41.321 --> 01:10:43.000
like,
that's funny cause I was just,

1192
01:10:43.210 --> 01:10:45.170
somebody else had just given me the kettle bell.

1193
01:10:45.171 --> 01:10:48.270
So the kettle bell was a wicked one until I got the plateau of Ucla.

1194
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:52.080
Did you say gave you the,
the handle of the kettle bell.
Yeah.

1195
01:10:52.090 --> 01:10:56.110
You handled it in the gut and then,
and then,

1196
01:10:56.260 --> 01:11:00.340
and then he won a Kelly one up me with the 45 pound platter,

1197
01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:02.640
but I didn't have that one by the pool.
So I use a 10 pound planner.

1198
01:11:02.670 --> 01:11:06.020
But just to get in just the plate.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He didn't play plan.

1199
01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:10.540
Another important thing and that Brian was saying is that hopefully you hope all

1200
01:11:10.541 --> 01:11:13.980
of us and you do this all the time.
Yeah.
You're the ultimate

1201
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:17.280
<v 5>student because you have to adjust.</v>

1202
01:11:17.281 --> 01:11:21.060
You always have to adjust and be open like this was working,
but I,

1203
01:11:21.061 --> 01:11:23.930
maybe I should change it or you know,
cause it's,

1204
01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:27.970
it's a moving target and be open to other people's,
um,

1205
01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:32.310
information and,
and,
and not be threatened by it and,

1206
01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:34.710
and give it a try if you're not good at it or whatever.

1207
01:11:34.711 --> 01:11:37.950
I think that that's a really important thing because then,
um,

1208
01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:40.800
you can keep growing and evolving.
So for those athletes,

1209
01:11:40.890 --> 01:11:43.620
I think it's just be open and be a student,

1210
01:11:43.621 --> 01:11:47.790
but then you have to be disciplined when you also have to be willing to accept

1211
01:11:47.791 --> 01:11:51.010
your,
your weaknesses and cultivate those.
You know,
it's like,

1212
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:54.000
it's funny because everybody,
the strong people all go lift weights.

1213
01:11:54.930 --> 01:11:58.110
People all go do yoga and you're like,
wait,

1214
01:11:58.130 --> 01:12:01.650
all you flexible people should go bank some iron and all you big weightlifter

1215
01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:03.810
should go do some yoga and all,
you know it's like,

1216
01:12:03.811 --> 01:12:06.900
but we always gravitate towards our strengths because we want to be in our
glory.

1217
01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:10.940
So we're like,
I avoid stretching like,
but I'm,
I'm,

1218
01:12:10.941 --> 01:12:15.810
I'm now just sore enough and heard enough that I'm like,
okay,

1219
01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:19.740
it's time I get,
I get a phone call.
Being the student,
being the student,

1220
01:12:19.741 --> 01:12:23.370
being the teacher,
being the student,
all that.
And,
and also,
and again,

1221
01:12:23.371 --> 01:12:27.090
the willingness to fail being one of the key elements to all of those things is

1222
01:12:27.091 --> 01:12:31.860
ever present because that means you're willing to subject yourself to,
okay,

1223
01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:34.260
I'm,
somebody knows something.
I don't know.
That's failure.

1224
01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:38.190
Some new thing you haven't done before that you're not going to be good at.

1225
01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:40.050
Like people want to come in and be good at stuff.

1226
01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:43.350
That's why the foil board drives half the guys away because they can't just get

1227
01:12:43.351 --> 01:12:46.260
on it and rip it the first time.
Just the full board.
But like Brian,

1228
01:12:46.261 --> 01:12:47.280
you're saying that,
uh,

1229
01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:50.010
I mean obviously a lot of very good athletes come in and do the,

1230
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:54.150
the pool workout and it's like that's a big humility sandwich right there.
Yeah.

1231
01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:59.160
I mean,
and not good at it.
Well that's also what needs out people.
Yeah.

1232
01:12:59.510 --> 01:13:03.970
Taylor,
we brought a girl,
uh,
a rower up here.
Um,

1233
01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:05.650
like crew rower.

1234
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:11.040
She rode with my wife and in 2005 Olympics at all.
Yeah.

1235
01:13:11.130 --> 01:13:14.670
And we brought her up here and we put her in the pool and everybody was just

1236
01:13:14.671 --> 01:13:18.480
like,
it was astounding.
Like I said,
the elements though,

1237
01:13:18.481 --> 01:13:22.950
cause she was already a phenomenal swimmer superstrong long,
hard,
again,

1238
01:13:22.951 --> 01:13:25.800
having those key and she was very humble,

1239
01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:28.530
but it was odd because she has all the physical attributes,

1240
01:13:28.531 --> 01:13:30.480
but she was very humble.
She wanted to learn.

1241
01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:33.870
But that's the combination like disposition,

1242
01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:39.120
disposition cause you put might and aggression over there.
The water goes,

1243
01:13:39.121 --> 01:13:41.640
oh mighty aggressive.
Perfect.
I'll just drown you.

1244
01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:47.750
So normally as males we just implement aggression and bustling and that he's not

1245
01:13:49.171 --> 01:13:51.290
going to muscle the,
sorry.
So you,

1246
01:13:51.291 --> 01:13:54.240
you mentioned weaknesses and strengths and I wanted to touch on something that

1247
01:13:54.241 --> 01:13:55.650
you mentioned to me earlier today,

1248
01:13:56.310 --> 01:14:00.900
which I found very interesting when we were doing the ammo box ammo box exercise

1249
01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:05.190
and a,
you talked about isolating limbs and isolating weaknesses.

1250
01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:08.910
Can you elaborate on that a little bit?
We'll,
because we'll just,
I mean,
you know,

1251
01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:12.070
and,
and,
and listen,
we know that if you work on being

1252
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:15.400
<v 7>more ambidextrous that you get better.
It's like,
you know,
you know,</v>

1253
01:14:15.401 --> 01:14:18.130
you throw knives with your right hand and you're really good at it,

1254
01:14:18.131 --> 01:14:19.470
we'll start throwing them with your left hand.

1255
01:14:19.471 --> 01:14:22.330
It actually makes you better with your right.
But again,

1256
01:14:22.331 --> 01:14:24.390
about isolation of the weaknesses is,

1257
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:28.670
is about being realistic about what your flaws are and,
and,

1258
01:14:28.671 --> 01:14:32.200
and working on those.
And that's why anything to do with instability,

1259
01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:34.930
when you talk about balance or in the pool,

1260
01:14:34.931 --> 01:14:38.830
it really is going to exaggerate those places that normally you can compensate.

1261
01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:39.260
There's,

1262
01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:43.090
it's hard to compensate in the pool when you have to swim with your left hand if

1263
01:14:43.091 --> 01:14:45.930
you have a big dumbbell in your right hand because there's no other lefthand,

1264
01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:48.370
there's only the one you have.
And if it doesn't work,

1265
01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:51.280
you got to figure out how to make it work.
Right.
And you can really,

1266
01:14:51.281 --> 01:14:54.490
and it really shows you,
you can really see,
you know,

1267
01:14:54.491 --> 01:14:57.790
you throw a ball with your left hand if you're right handed and you feel like,

1268
01:14:57.820 --> 01:14:59.320
oh my gosh,
who's arm is this?

1269
01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:03.100
I can't even use this arm or Kik or kick with your left leg.
Or,

1270
01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:06.190
or even when you go into stretching and you look at stretching.

1271
01:15:06.191 --> 01:15:09.580
Why is my right hamstring so much looser than my left hamstring?

1272
01:15:09.581 --> 01:15:12.550
Why is my quad my left quad so much tighter than my right?

1273
01:15:12.551 --> 01:15:16.830
Quite all those things.
Those are all weaknesses at the end.
And,
uh,

1274
01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:21.520
what do you feel like your current weaknesses are that you're working on?
Oh,

1275
01:15:21.521 --> 01:15:24.080
it's ongoing.
I got a lot of destruction,
you know,

1276
01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:25.750
I've been beating myself up for a long time,

1277
01:15:25.751 --> 01:15:29.890
so my weakness has had more to do with,
with damage,
but,
um,

1278
01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:32.260
like I got some hit some hip flexor,

1279
01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:35.890
something going on with my right leg because of the load that I put on it.

1280
01:15:36.090 --> 01:15:40.070
It why your right leg?
Well,
it's my back leg in service,

1281
01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:43.750
but it's also because my left leg has been broken seven times.
So,
um,

1282
01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:47.440
that's an surfing or other things,
uh,
other surfing in and other things.

1283
01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.620
But I broke my ankle a bunch of times.
An arch and a bunch of men.

1284
01:15:50.650 --> 01:15:52.570
All the metatarsal,
his and stuff on the left,

1285
01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:56.410
the left ankle and the left foot has taken a lot of the,
of the impact.

1286
01:15:56.620 --> 01:16:00.870
And so my rights been calm,
caring.
It,
uh,
you know,
for all these extra year.

1287
01:16:00.871 --> 01:16:03.760
So it's got,
you know,
my,
my right leg has a couple of,

1288
01:16:03.761 --> 01:16:07.900
maybe five or 10 more years of use than my left leg.
So I'm dealing with that,

1289
01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:12.310
with that.
Uh,
and,
and,
and the fact is that we're all asymmetrical.

1290
01:16:12.730 --> 01:16:17.020
Definitely.
We're all,
I mean,
even,
I mean,
I told the girls the other day,

1291
01:16:17.021 --> 01:16:18.430
I go look at the tennis players.

1292
01:16:18.610 --> 01:16:22.780
I go look at their throwing hand and they're like,
they're like,
oh my goodness,

1293
01:16:22.781 --> 01:16:24.790
the guy's one arm is so much bigger than the other one.

1294
01:16:24.791 --> 01:16:28.900
But you don't even see it unless you look for it.
Focus on it.
Exactly.
So,
I mean,

1295
01:16:28.901 --> 01:16:32.260
but you know,
I think that that's,
uh,
you know,
again,
those are the,
you know,

1296
01:16:32.261 --> 01:16:35.590
right now,
like I said,
it's a hip thing.
It's a,
you know,
it's,
it's,
it's,
I mean,

1297
01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:37.960
there's always,
and it's elusive thing.
It's moving in,

1298
01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:40.930
<v 4>but even with that,
your brain disciplines,
like I have to say,</v>

1299
01:16:40.931 --> 01:16:44.890
Laird is a good patient.
Like if he has homework,
he does his homework.

1300
01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:49.660
If he's told to do stretches,
he does a stretches.
Uh,
so you're always,

1301
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:53.460
<v 7>but that's come out of necessity.
That's because I've been hurt so many times.</v>

1302
01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:53.881
I mean,

1303
01:16:53.881 --> 01:16:57.690
you really don't learn anything about yourself ultimately until you've been

1304
01:16:57.691 --> 01:17:00.570
injured.
Again,
back to the failure back to failure,

1305
01:17:00.571 --> 01:17:03.780
whether it's something failed or you did something that made you crash and get

1306
01:17:03.781 --> 01:17:04.440
hurt.

1307
01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:07.480
<v 4>But you also,
the thing is that like even Brian mentioned earlier,</v>

1308
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:11.930
there's something that you have that you've discovered is he has the faith that,

1309
01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:16.820
oh,
lay both go,
well if I do this then I'll probably be a little better tomorrow.

1310
01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:21.380
So they have that faith and that to layered knows,
okay,
if I'm not feeling well,

1311
01:17:21.381 --> 01:17:25.790
if I'm,
if I keep trying different things and I stay open and I do my homework,

1312
01:17:26.210 --> 01:17:29.090
I can probably be proactive and helping myself get better.

1313
01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:33.330
And I think those elements are important because sometimes what happens is,

1314
01:17:33.331 --> 01:17:36.410
is sometimes if people aren't feeling well,
they're this age athlete or whatever,

1315
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:40.130
they're so far under it,
they don't have that faith anymore.

1316
01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:45.410
Or they don't understand how to unravel that.
Not,
um,
and so I think,
you know,

1317
01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:48.440
it's like priming the pump.
Sometimes the water doesn't come out right away.

1318
01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:52.430
But then if you just keep going and it'll start to flow.
And I think,
you know,

1319
01:17:52.431 --> 01:17:55.430
certainly in this situation,
these guys have seen it enough times.

1320
01:17:55.431 --> 01:17:57.640
And I think that that's a really important thing for people.
Well,

1321
01:17:57.710 --> 01:18:01.650
<v 3>the [inaudible] actually have been through it and had success.</v>

1322
01:18:01.651 --> 01:18:03.630
Then you give you hope.
Definitely you don't want,

1323
01:18:03.631 --> 01:18:06.660
he says your one time when you've been perfectly ironman forever and all of a

1324
01:18:06.661 --> 01:18:08.460
sudden something happens and you're like the whole,

1325
01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:11.880
the whole house breaks in shock and you can't wear,

1326
01:18:11.881 --> 01:18:14.640
if you've been through it and you've recovered once and then you did it and had

1327
01:18:14.641 --> 01:18:18.650
another thing and you've had enough stuff,
but you made it back through it.

1328
01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:22.880
You know,
you,
it builds the belief that you can do it.
I think another piece of,

1329
01:18:23.070 --> 01:18:25.670
of this,
and I'd look to,
to ask you about this,
Brian,
uh,

1330
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:30.750
is that a lot of athletes surround themselves with people who love to

1331
01:18:32.071 --> 01:18:35.370
commiserate.
So an athlete will be like,
Oh,
well,
you know,

1332
01:18:35.371 --> 01:18:38.190
I just turned 30 and you know,
once you turned 30,
like,
oh my God,

1333
01:18:38.191 --> 01:18:41.430
my aching joints.
Now I know you guys are both covering your faces.

1334
01:18:41.431 --> 01:18:43.860
And the reason is,
you know,
I've,
uh,

1335
01:18:43.890 --> 01:18:47.160
but this is so common and then everyone sits around and bitches and moans and

1336
01:18:47.161 --> 01:18:51.250
they use that as an excuse in society too.
But what I love about,
you know,

1337
01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:53.460
hanging out with you guys are like Titus,
right?

1338
01:18:53.461 --> 01:18:55.350
I guess it was like there's a huge,
there's a photograph.

1339
01:18:55.351 --> 01:18:58.590
So Titus was in the surfing episode of the Tim Ferriss Experiment,

1340
01:18:58.591 --> 01:19:02.190
the TV show and walked into his garage and there's this photo of him surfing a

1341
01:19:02.191 --> 01:19:05.700
50 plus foot way of,
and I'm like,
what is that?
And he goes,
Oh yeah,

1342
01:19:05.701 --> 01:19:09.690
it was my 50th birthday.
And I was just like,
I have no excuses.

1343
01:19:09.691 --> 01:19:14.210
Like shame on me forever.
Even thinking I have an excuse.
And uh,

1344
01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:17.550
hanging out with Rick for instance.
And then I guess,
um,
the name is Don Wildman.

1345
01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:22.740
Is that,
um,
uh,
dawn picture of him back then?
Could you explain for two people?

1346
01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:27.210
Uh,
and,
and then Brian,
I'd love to ask you outside of the examples I just gave,

1347
01:19:27.211 --> 01:19:31.710
sort of,
who inspires you in that same way?
Like my,
one of my,

1348
01:19:31.770 --> 01:19:35.940
my only coach really I'm working with right now is a 60,
just turned 62,

1349
01:19:36.170 --> 01:19:39.930
a former four time world record holder and Olympic weightlifting.

1350
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:43.950
And he can still do what he used to do.
I mean,
not necessarily the same way,

1351
01:19:44.010 --> 01:19:47.820
but cold.
You can just go out and jump into like asked to,

1352
01:19:47.821 --> 01:19:50.040
he'll snatch and tennis shoes.
Uh,

1353
01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:54.120
and it's so inspiring to me because whenever I'm like,
Oh,
woe is me,
like,

1354
01:19:54.121 --> 01:19:58.290
moo a poor lift ankle.
I'm like,
suck it up.
Fair.
It's like,
give me a break.

1355
01:19:58.470 --> 01:20:03.440
So Wildman,
um,
can you explain Don Wildman 82,
uh,

1356
01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:07.980
you know,
80 days is heli,
uh,
80 days of snowboarding last year.

1357
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:11.730
<v 7>I just went heli snowboarding with him like a month ago or two months ago in</v>

1358
01:20:11.731 --> 01:20:15.320
Alaska.
Uh,
just,
you know,
I mean,
hell,

1359
01:20:15.321 --> 01:20:20.310
he boarding is a rigorous activity a week straight,
you know,
15,
16 runs a day,

1360
01:20:20.311 --> 01:20:23.310
you know,
third,
fourth day you're,
you're wobbly,
not a word out of the,

1361
01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:27.720
out of the gunslinger.
And,
uh,
you know,
he just is like,
you know,

1362
01:20:28.410 --> 01:20:33.300
but,
but when you meet him,
you know,
you,
you his,
his,

1363
01:20:33.301 --> 01:20:36.750
his hunger for information,
his,
his,

1364
01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:39.210
his youthful enthusiasm,
you know,
it's like,

1365
01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:42.600
I think that is such a key element when you look at any of these guys,

1366
01:20:42.850 --> 01:20:44.910
you see an enthusiasm in him.

1367
01:20:45.090 --> 01:20:47.160
And I think that's what happens to a lot of athletes.

1368
01:20:47.161 --> 01:20:49.710
I think they just lose their enthusiasm,
their burnout.

1369
01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:53.040
They've been doing their sports since they were five or 10 and they'd been in

1370
01:20:53.041 --> 01:20:54.120
the pressure around it.

1371
01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:59.190
And so I believe ultimately that it's a conscious decision that with a physical

1372
01:20:59.191 --> 01:21:03.960
manifestation.
And so dawn was never accepting it as being,
you know,
he,
Oh,

1373
01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:06.240
you know,
the guy that holds the,
you know,

1374
01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:10.020
he always gives you stuff like the guy that held the Olympic record for lifting

1375
01:21:10.021 --> 01:21:14.430
was 52 or 54 before steroids and blah,
blah,
blah,
and all this stuff.
You know,

1376
01:21:14.431 --> 01:21:19.050
when you see that and,
and,
and,
but what's great about somebody like dawn,

1377
01:21:19.051 --> 01:21:24.030
who's my,
my guy that I look to,
is that just,
there it is.
Yeah.

1378
01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:28.470
You don't have to imagine what it looks like there it is.
It's alive.
It's,
well,

1379
01:21:28.471 --> 01:21:33.240
I mean [inaudible] I put don on a bicycle and I can take pretty much almost

1380
01:21:33.241 --> 01:21:38.070
anybody on a bicycle unless you are like a professional bicycle list and he will

1381
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:39.510
hammer you,

1382
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:43.890
you will be hammered and you will be asking me how old is the guy up in the

1383
01:21:43.891 --> 01:21:48.660
front with the gray hair?
Like 82 he's going to hand and he can still do what?

1384
01:21:48.661 --> 01:21:52.530
Like 1517 pull up some in.
Oh yeah,
he's a poet machine.

1385
01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:56.800
Amongst other things amongst that system,
that's just a small,

1386
01:21:56.990 --> 01:22:01.500
that's a small tip of the iceberg.
What would you attribute that to?

1387
01:22:01.501 --> 01:22:06.120
Like why has he not lost his enthusiasm and maybe a different way of putting it?

1388
01:22:06.121 --> 01:22:08.280
As for people who are like,
God,

1389
01:22:08.281 --> 01:22:10.230
I would love to have that enthusiasm but I just don't,

1390
01:22:10.231 --> 01:22:13.590
like how do I develop that?
What do I do?
Like I,
I,
I'm willing to work.

1391
01:22:13.591 --> 01:22:18.270
Like what do I do to have that youthful?
Well,
I mean,
I think in his,

1392
01:22:18.330 --> 01:22:21.940
his case he's got a couple driving forces.
I mean,
he,

1393
01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:26.220
he has guilt and,
and he loves to eat.
So that's one at,

1394
01:22:26.221 --> 01:22:29.100
like dawn has a unique thing about that that he can implement.

1395
01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:33.480
Like he wants to eat whatever he wants and he,
me and he loves to eat like,

1396
01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:37.440
you know,
cakes and pies and ice cream and like,
he'll just devour that stuff,

1397
01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:42.180
but he,
at the same time,
at the same time,
he wants to be,
he wants to be,

1398
01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:46.480
he does it.
He's not going to be fat.
He doesn't want any fat on his body and,

1399
01:22:46.481 --> 01:22:50.340
and so,
so for him he's earning it like he's for it.
In this particular case,

1400
01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:53.670
he's earning it right.
And also to the,
Oh,

1401
01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:56.700
he always says it takes the piss and vinegar Outta here.
You know what I mean?

1402
01:22:56.701 --> 01:23:00.710
Like he knows how it affects his mood and how it makes them feel.
And so it,

1403
01:23:00.770 --> 01:23:04.410
once you subject yourself to it for long enough and you're consistent enough,

1404
01:23:04.730 --> 01:23:08.770
you know,
it's,
you start to get addicted to that.
You're light food tastes great.

1405
01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:11.710
My sleeping's rate,
my sex is unbelievable.
I'm just,
you know,

1406
01:23:11.711 --> 01:23:15.850
it's like all this stuff where he just,
and then you don't want to lose that,

1407
01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:18.640
then then you use,
it becomes the new normal,
right.
That's the norm.

1408
01:23:18.641 --> 01:23:19.241
And then you don't,

1409
01:23:19.241 --> 01:23:22.720
and then that becomes the driving force and then it's easier and you,

1410
01:23:22.721 --> 01:23:27.250
and it's never an option.
Yeah.
You never make it.
It's like Gabby says,

1411
01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:27.870
you know,

1412
01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:31.090
it's not like if you don't choose whether you want to brush your teeth or not,

1413
01:23:31.091 --> 01:23:33.490
you don't go,
I'm not going to brush my teeth this week.
You know,

1414
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:37.210
I don't need to do that.
It's just something you do.
It's like,
well,
exactly.

1415
01:23:37.211 --> 01:23:38.710
But no,
but yeah.

1416
01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:42.380
<v 4>Well the other thing don does,
that's very genius.
It's goes back to a Brian side,</v>

1417
01:23:42.381 --> 01:23:42.801
which is,

1418
01:23:42.801 --> 01:23:47.801
he solicits people to be in his group because no man can really do it alone.

1419
01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:51.860
So he always has these guys around him,
most of them quite a bit younger.

1420
01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:53.960
So the energy goes into the pot and

1421
01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:58.770
<v 7>roles or girls.
Yeah,
yeah.
Well,
yeah,
one girl.
Yeah,</v>

1422
01:23:58.850 --> 01:24:00.590
but I'm just saying,
but he's got,
but he's got to grow,

1423
01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:05.180
but he loves to be a host and bring people with him and do things.
You,

1424
01:24:05.230 --> 01:24:08.150
the bike camp at your music set up for you and you do everything for you.

1425
01:24:08.151 --> 01:24:10.880
Well it seems like you're doing,
he does that,

1426
01:24:10.881 --> 01:24:14.960
that they do that star that does that,
that I,
the host and I do that.
Like,

1427
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:18.620
it's like we invite like I'm picking up a girl this afternoon at lax who's going

1428
01:24:18.621 --> 01:24:21.820
to be staying with us for a week to train and participate in,
you know,

1429
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:25.400
it's like this is thank you for your 80 units of energy contribution to the pot

1430
01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:31.190
just gone up.
Now we're going to absorb that.
And also to it also,

1431
01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:35.990
it also confirms what you're,
that you're,
it's like a reminder.
Yeah.
You know,

1432
01:24:35.991 --> 01:24:37.080
because again,
it's like,

1433
01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:40.520
like Gabby said with the stand up paddlers that at the end when you go through

1434
01:24:40.521 --> 01:24:43.940
what you went through today and then you and I see your face and I know what it

1435
01:24:43.941 --> 01:24:47.270
did to you and I know later you'll be like sitting somewhere and you'll want to

1436
01:24:47.271 --> 01:24:50.540
go to sleep.
I'll be like,
I'll be like,
hey just give me the call.

1437
01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:51.770
Like call me cause I want,

1438
01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:55.820
cause it's confirmation of that you're not alone because when you're alone in

1439
01:24:55.821 --> 01:24:59.960
something,
a lonely place is up as a,
as an unmotivated place.

1440
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.410
Oh that's a great way.
It's an unmotivated.
When you're lonely,

1441
01:25:03.411 --> 01:25:08.270
it's very unique to find a complete loner that's as full maximum motivation,

1442
01:25:08.450 --> 01:25:11.350
really motive.
We are communal,
we are communal.

1443
01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:15.000
But that's why we're subjected to all of this peer pressure too.

1444
01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:19.310
We're subjected to social pressure of,
hey now your 30 year over hill,

1445
01:25:19.311 --> 01:25:21.530
what are you going to do now?
So you don't even,

1446
01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:25.850
but that's social stuff that we implement.
So,
but we,
the reverses that is,
hey,

1447
01:25:25.851 --> 01:25:30.620
we're all together and you're 60 or 70.
I'm 50,
I'm 30.

1448
01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:35.020
We're all going,
let's go.
Yeah.
So definitely I was talking to,
um,

1449
01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:36.643
my,
uh,
my,

1450
01:25:36.710 --> 01:25:41.090
my trainer's wife who's awesome and she also has a couple of world's records,

1451
01:25:41.450 --> 01:25:44.990
uh,
and super sweet sweetheart and she's,

1452
01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:49.520
I guess 55 around there.
And she was saying,
she said to me,
she's like,
you know,

1453
01:25:49.521 --> 01:25:51.560
when people start to get old,
she's,
and she said,

1454
01:25:51.561 --> 01:25:55.560
it's when they stop jumping when this stop jumping and uh,
you know,

1455
01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:57.620
we can fuck talking about whether that's right or wrong,
but the,

1456
01:25:57.621 --> 01:26:00.620
the followup was even more interesting to me because she has a daughter,

1457
01:26:00.621 --> 01:26:03.950
a young daughter,
and there was something stuck in the tree

1458
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:07.190
<v 3>and she got up into the tree and her daughter was like,
mom,
be careful.</v>

1459
01:26:07.191 --> 01:26:10.400
It's really high.
And she climbed up 20,
25 feet,
got the thing out,

1460
01:26:10.401 --> 01:26:11.450
climb back down.
She was like,

1461
01:26:11.451 --> 01:26:16.451
do you know what it says to a daughter to see her mom who's 55 effortlessly go

1462
01:26:16.701 --> 01:26:19.400
up into a tree,
get it and come down.
Like,

1463
01:26:19.401 --> 01:26:24.260
it just shows her possibilities that,
or it'll make her,
it's like,

1464
01:26:24.290 --> 01:26:27.560
you know,
sometimes they take your kid,
see you train like you,
like we trained.

1465
01:26:27.570 --> 01:26:31.830
They may be like,
hmm,
maybe I don't want to train you.
Me.

1466
01:26:31.890 --> 01:26:35.240
I don't want to climb tree.
Mom's crazy though.

1467
01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:41.360
Brian,
who other,
I speak,
speaking of crazy,
speaking of crazy evil,
uh,

1468
01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:46.700
Brian,
who else sort of inspires you?
People you look up to,

1469
01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:51.530
uh,
as,
uh,
say that,
uh,
Don Wildman type.

1470
01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:53.720
It doesn't have to be someone older than you,
but like,

1471
01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:57.860
who are the people you look to as inspiration when maybe you're feeling

1472
01:26:57.861 --> 01:26:59.960
overwhelmed or burned out or,
or fill in the blank?

1473
01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:04.980
<v 5>Um,
I do a decent amount of reading.
Um,</v>

1474
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:10.260
and a decent amount of watching of documentaries and a decent amount of being a

1475
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:15.310
voyeur is stick with people who are creative regardless of that creativity.

1476
01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:23.140
Um,
a lot of it has to do with food sometimes because,
yeah.
Well,
it's just,
you,

1477
01:27:23.141 --> 01:27:27.710
you look at what they're doing like 20 years ago,
maybe a little longer,

1478
01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:32.810
a chef's were not looked at as anything,
right.
They were just here,

1479
01:27:32.811 --> 01:27:37.040
you're in the back cooking right now.
If you've paid enough attention.

1480
01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:42.110
They are these masterful creators of things.
You know,

1481
01:27:42.111 --> 01:27:44.530
one of the great,
one of the best documentaries I've ever seen is called,

1482
01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:47.930
it has a movie called spinning plates,
Spinning plates,
spinning plates.

1483
01:27:47.931 --> 01:27:51.710
It's a must see if you're really looking to progress yourself because there's a,

1484
01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:55.150
there's a guy by the name of,
uh,
his name's grant,
any,

1485
01:27:55.160 --> 01:28:00.160
and he runs one of the top seven restaurants in the world and he has this way of

1486
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:05.150
dealing with food much like you see a lot of great chefs at this point,

1487
01:28:05.151 --> 01:28:09.350
whether to Nomo Tracia he,
he's a United States citizen named grant Achatz.
Yes.

1488
01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:14.330
Yes.
Grant Achatz and Alinea.
Yes.
Alinea yeah.

1489
01:28:14.331 --> 01:28:16.790
So he's got to linea,
but,
so they're following a linea,

1490
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:20.990
but they're also following a homestead in like Iowa.

1491
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:25.490
That's just this family run place that the entire community goes to.

1492
01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:29.000
And then they're following this Mexican place in Tucson,

1493
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:31.160
which is barely making it,

1494
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:35.380
and they play the entire show.
And you're watching this movie,

1495
01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.220
this documentary on all of these places.

1496
01:28:37.221 --> 01:28:40.400
And as they're progressing in their trials or tribulations and all this stuff,

1497
01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:45.700
and at the end they grant has seen the entire thing and you think he's this like

1498
01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:52.020
Demi God of,
of food.
And he explains what he does.
And he goes,

1499
01:28:52.021 --> 01:28:53.300
and you know,
and what I'm doing is,

1500
01:28:53.301 --> 01:28:57.290
is if somebody can come into my restaurant and they feel that they taste the

1501
01:28:57.291 --> 01:29:01.100
food and they feel it,
and I get in and they come to ask in the back,

1502
01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:04.800
they can talk to the chef and they say,
hey,
I feel like I know you.
And he goes,

1503
01:29:04.801 --> 01:29:08.310
that's exactly what I'm going.
That's exactly what I want to do.
And,
and,

1504
01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.380
and in essence,
that's what I do is it's like,

1505
01:29:10.410 --> 01:29:14.550
I want people to see how I see the world.
Don't take everything I do,
but,

1506
01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:16.500
but it inspire you to some degree.

1507
01:29:16.501 --> 01:29:19.620
But he literally goes at the end of this thing,

1508
01:29:20.250 --> 01:29:24.690
the Mexican restaurant is doing the exact same thing and it failed it at that

1509
01:29:24.691 --> 01:29:26.460
point in the movie.
It literally,
they had had,

1510
01:29:26.490 --> 01:29:29.490
they went bankrupt and they didn't make it,
and you know,
it didn't last.

1511
01:29:29.491 --> 01:29:32.150
And he's like,
but nobody understood that.
No,

1512
01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:35.760
because they think because it's not flashy and it's this thing that they're not

1513
01:29:35.761 --> 01:29:38.640
getting that experience yet.
It was that experience,
not homestead.

1514
01:29:38.641 --> 01:29:40.020
That's the exact same thing I'm doing.

1515
01:29:40.230 --> 01:29:43.380
They're just expressing themselves in another way through this and we're not

1516
01:29:43.381 --> 01:29:44.970
taking the time to understand that.

1517
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:48.390
And I think that's where one of the missing links is with a lot of people is we

1518
01:29:48.391 --> 01:29:52.150
want this great,
huge,
massive inspiration.
But the fact is,

1519
01:29:52.151 --> 01:29:56.340
is every bit of an inspiration you need or want is in front of you in anything

1520
01:29:56.341 --> 01:29:56.910
you want.

1521
01:29:56.910 --> 01:30:01.530
If you're willing to go the length to be obsessive enough about it.

1522
01:30:01.630 --> 01:30:05.940
Yeah.
And,
and I think that it like,
it's not just food with me,

1523
01:30:05.941 --> 01:30:09.480
it's like I just watched some coach do something the other day who,

1524
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:14.370
I remember this kid like seven years ago at my buddy's gym and he was just this

1525
01:30:14.371 --> 01:30:17.370
little kid who was just learning and wanting to understand.

1526
01:30:17.550 --> 01:30:22.350
He's doing things right now from a gymnastics perspective that he's showing

1527
01:30:22.351 --> 01:30:27.351
people through social media of him doing things and how he sees the world that

1528
01:30:27.691 --> 01:30:32.670
is just amazing.
And I'm like,
fuck,
I get so much out of that and I'm like,

1529
01:30:32.730 --> 01:30:36.540
I'm going to go and do some stuff that's like inspiring me to do that.

1530
01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:39.270
And it's whether it's what you choose to get out of things.
I think,

1531
01:30:39.330 --> 01:30:44.100
what's his name?
His name's Colen parody.
Colon parody.
Yeah.
Cool.
Check it out.

1532
01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:47.670
No,
I think it's,
it's so true.
I mean the,
like you were saying,
um,

1533
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.130
layered that there are no new ideas,

1534
01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:53.820
just sort of old concepts that he has applied to new areas.

1535
01:30:54.150 --> 01:30:58.560
It's like you don't have to look in fitness to find inspiration to be better in

1536
01:30:58.561 --> 01:31:02.670
fitness.
You can,
you can look at someone like grant Kratz amazing.
Of course.
Yeah.

1537
01:31:02.671 --> 01:31:03.720
I mean he cooked for,

1538
01:31:03.721 --> 01:31:07.280
I think it was period of one or two years with no taste because he had yet a

1539
01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:11.220
cancer tongue cancer,
like a,
who was it?
Beethoven,
I think,

1540
01:31:11.221 --> 01:31:16.040
who composed without being able to hear just insane.
So I,
I want to be very,

1541
01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:19.500
uh,
this is,
this is so much fun,
but I want to be respectful of your time.

1542
01:31:19.501 --> 01:31:21.930
So I'll just ask one or two more questions.
Um,

1543
01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:24.840
so why don't we start with 'em and I'll ask the same,

1544
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:28.210
same question of all three of you,
but,
uh,
Gabby,
uh,

1545
01:31:30.570 --> 01:31:31.890
ladies first.
Uh,

1546
01:31:32.010 --> 01:31:35.970
what advice would you give to your 30 year old self?

1547
01:31:37.130 --> 01:31:37.963
<v 9>Oh,</v>

1548
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:45.260
<v 4>well,
I always say I would have,
and I mentioned this earlier,</v>

1549
01:31:45.261 --> 01:31:48.050
but certainly not to take anything personal,

1550
01:31:48.051 --> 01:31:52.250
but also maybe don't hold yourself back.
I think sometimes,

1551
01:31:52.251 --> 01:31:56.210
and I think this is a trade of a female more than of a male.
Um,

1552
01:31:56.300 --> 01:32:01.090
we have a tendency sometimes to sit on our talents and potentials because we

1553
01:32:01.091 --> 01:32:05.110
don't want to offend anyone or we don't want to be singled out.
You know,

1554
01:32:05.111 --> 01:32:05.950
I heard a great story.

1555
01:32:05.951 --> 01:32:09.220
I had a coach once that said he was an assistant coach to the men's,

1556
01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:12.970
a USA volleyball team.
And in this game it was one point.
And the coach said,

1557
01:32:12.971 --> 01:32:14.310
look straight at Karcher cry,

1558
01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:17.380
said I need you to put this ball away and you'd win this game.

1559
01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:19.900
And it was like boom,
okay.
And he said it was amazing.

1560
01:32:19.901 --> 01:32:21.680
And then he did it and then he had his opportunity.

1561
01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:25.450
He was coaching a bunch of women at a very high level and he did the same thing

1562
01:32:25.451 --> 01:32:28.540
to the athlete.
That was the one.
And everyone,

1563
01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:31.180
it didn't work because all the other,

1564
01:32:31.210 --> 01:32:35.080
it was like a singling out that women we have a hard time with instead of

1565
01:32:35.081 --> 01:32:37.330
honoring understanding that you can be singled out,

1566
01:32:37.331 --> 01:32:41.170
but still for the greater good.
Right.
So I think I,
if I would have maybe,

1567
01:32:41.710 --> 01:32:46.510
um,
not tried to,
I think I sat on some of my talents a little bit.

1568
01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:51.970
And um,
and also I think I,
I certainly,
like I said,
tried to,

1569
01:32:52.030 --> 01:32:54.670
I took things personally,
so I would tell that person,
like,

1570
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:59.260
don't take it personal.
You know,
I tell my kids,
learn how to say,
I'm sorry,

1571
01:32:59.261 --> 01:33:02.230
that doesn't work for me.
It's,
it's,
again,

1572
01:33:02.231 --> 01:33:06.610
I've learned a lot from being around men.
I respect a lot of traits.
You can,

1573
01:33:06.670 --> 01:33:08.680
you can deliver a message without emotion.

1574
01:33:08.681 --> 01:33:10.990
Usually women in order to finally stand up for themselves,

1575
01:33:10.991 --> 01:33:14.770
they have to be kind of ramped up and then it just comes out ballistic instead

1576
01:33:14.771 --> 01:33:16.900
of like,
no,
that doesn't work for me.
And then we don't.

1577
01:33:16.901 --> 01:33:21.550
And also not to then second guessed that you've laid that line down.
Um,

1578
01:33:21.551 --> 01:33:25.930
I think that that's really important and I think,
um,
you know,

1579
01:33:25.931 --> 01:33:29.830
it's important to like if you have gifts and talents,
whatever they are,

1580
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:34.420
don't feel guilty and bad or weird about it and,
and,
but you know,

1581
01:33:34.421 --> 01:33:36.610
you don't have to be a schmuck.
I mean,
you don't have to,
you know,

1582
01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:38.740
I always tell kids,
if you're on the team,

1583
01:33:38.741 --> 01:33:41.740
you're lucky and if you're the best one,
you're the luckiest.
So it's,

1584
01:33:41.790 --> 01:33:44.970
it's calibrating all of that.
I think I would have done that.
But you know,

1585
01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:49.510
we always say we're grateful for it because it gets you where you are grateful

1586
01:33:49.511 --> 01:33:53.860
for,
for whatever things you had to go through that you did or didn't do.

1587
01:33:53.861 --> 01:33:57.280
The notion of regret is it's not that it's pointless,

1588
01:33:57.281 --> 01:34:01.870
but you know,
it's sort of like that gets you to where you where you are.

1589
01:34:01.930 --> 01:34:02.720
Yeah.

1590
01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:06.420
<v 6>Good advice.
Good advice for anybody.
Uh,
Laird,</v>

1591
01:34:06.421 --> 01:34:10.670
what advice would you give your 30 year old self?
Stop drinking now.

1592
01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:14.293
Oh my God.

1593
01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:20.420
Stop drinking ranking now.

1594
01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:24.050
Stop drinking right now and patent all your ideas.

1595
01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:34.100
Good advice.
They go together well too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right now.

1596
01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:41.510
Father,
your pants and your drug also got a messy.
Yeah,
good.
That is good advice.

1597
01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:43.670
Uh,
Brian,
when Faye,
what do I hear?

1598
01:34:45.410 --> 01:34:50.210
30 I think patient.
Be patient.
Be patient,
be more patient.

1599
01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:53.210
And what if,
what if your 30 old self was like,
fuck that.

1600
01:34:53.211 --> 01:34:58.130
Why should it be a patient?
Well that's why.
Yeah,
you don't

1601
01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:01.760
<v 5>understand.
Just be patient.
And you know,
I,
I think I was in a,
in a,</v>

1602
01:35:01.761 --> 01:35:03.380
in a big rush at 30,
you know,

1603
01:35:03.381 --> 01:35:07.740
I'm 40 now and so it's like decades gone by and it's like,
if,
you know,

1604
01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:11.810
I am so,
I mean,
I'm like,
wow,

1605
01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:16.010
like being like I'm so much more patient now and there's much more work to be

1606
01:35:16.011 --> 01:35:20.260
done,
but it's like,
it's just when it's piecemeal and it's,

1607
01:35:20.261 --> 01:35:23.780
it's this just,
okay.
It makes so much more sense.

1608
01:35:23.810 --> 01:35:25.490
When you're putting stuff together,

1609
01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:29.570
what has helped you most to become more patient?
Um,

1610
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:35.600
honestly,
the experience and the relationships that I have,

1611
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:39.590
the relationships that I used to have versus what I have now.
Wow.

1612
01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:43.730
Like it's just better inputs.
It's not even better written puts,
they're just,

1613
01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:48.440
they're real people.
This is real life.
This is really real.
Like,
you know,

1614
01:35:48.441 --> 01:35:51.170
I mean I have a wife that is just amazing,

1615
01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:55.910
that understands me and on a level that it's like,
hey,

1616
01:35:55.970 --> 01:36:00.440
you need to do your thing.
You need to do it.
But you know,
I support it.
Like go,

1617
01:36:00.710 --> 01:36:03.770
like,
again,
like I have crazy behavior,
like,
you know,

1618
01:36:03.771 --> 01:36:07.910
like get fixated on things that I'm doing and it's like she,
she's like,

1619
01:36:07.911 --> 01:36:11.360
she may not get it,
but she gets it,
you know?
And,
and,

1620
01:36:11.361 --> 01:36:14.150
and why that's so hard to come by when you're 30,

1621
01:36:14.210 --> 01:36:18.230
like I didn't know I didn't date girls well and that,
that was my problem.
Yeah.

1622
01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:22.670
Maybe that it was like I wasn't patient enough to date girls when I was 30 or to

1623
01:36:22.671 --> 01:36:26.820
be involved with women that I was at 30 that understood.
Stuff like that.
Yeah.

1624
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:31.100
You know,
um,
you know,
and,
and to be involved with people and women like that is,

1625
01:36:31.101 --> 01:36:35.510
is truly a blessing.
So eight patients is definitely the big one.
At 30.

1626
01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:37.380
What about me?

1627
01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:42.120
<v 3>Yeah,
I would,
uh,</v>

1628
01:36:42.210 --> 01:36:44.280
I would have told myself

1629
01:36:45.490 --> 01:36:45.980
<v 5>start</v>

1630
01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:50.270
<v 3>meditating.
It's not just for hippies to play the didgeridoo start sitting down.</v>

1631
01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:53.810
Rick is actually Rick Ruben.
It's one of the,
the he and another friend.

1632
01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:57.350
I was just going through a very Yang,
anxious,
rushed,

1633
01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:01.040
like aggressive period where I had a short fuse and was just in a rush to get

1634
01:37:01.041 --> 01:37:05.150
everything done.
And,
uh,
spoke with two close friends.

1635
01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:09.590
One is chase Jarvis,
worldclass photographer,
amazing guy.
And uh,
he was like,

1636
01:37:09.591 --> 01:37:12.030
you know,
maybe you should try TM transcendental meditation.

1637
01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:14.270
There are many types of meditation.
And then I was like,
ah,

1638
01:37:15.050 --> 01:37:18.350
1500 bucks to get a mantra.
No thanks.
That sounds like a cult.
And then,
uh,

1639
01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:21.860
then I had coffee with rec and he's like,
have you ever thought about TM?

1640
01:37:21.861 --> 01:37:26.360
And I'm like,
God damn this Tmr I fun.
Uh,
but just,
uh,

1641
01:37:26.361 --> 01:37:27.920
I would've said there,
there are many,

1642
01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:30.800
I worry with these hypotheticals of screwing up,

1643
01:37:31.250 --> 01:37:34.200
like causing an unintended butterfly effect in the past I'm like,
no,
no,

1644
01:37:34.201 --> 01:37:36.530
I wouldn't have changed anything.
I'm not sure I want to change anything,
but the,

1645
01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:41.270
I,
I,
it's hard for me to see how taking 20 minutes first thing in the morning to

1646
01:37:41.271 --> 01:37:45.650
meditate would have produced any bad results for me.
That aspect of it do your

1647
01:37:45.650 --> 01:37:48.530
<v 5>patients.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah,
exactly.</v>

1648
01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:53.300
In that book that Laird talks about,
if you're the natural born heroes,

1649
01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:56.100
natural born heroes,
if you're,
if you're hunched forward,
well first

1650
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:59.640
<v 4>of all,
if you're hunched forward,
you go into fight or flight,
right?</v>

1651
01:37:59.641 --> 01:38:03.090
You have a physiological response.
And now that we're all on our gadgets,

1652
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:08.400
we're all perpetually in a,
in a,
in this position.
So it creates anxiety

1653
01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:13.200
and we're not in our predatorial,
we're not looking at,
we're not looking around.

1654
01:38:13.201 --> 01:38:15.410
So we were in this position and then we're,

1655
01:38:15.630 --> 01:38:18.840
we have an instinctual thing to know what's going on around us and we don't

1656
01:38:18.841 --> 01:38:21.000
while we're doing it.
And that just grinds on her.

1657
01:38:21.250 --> 01:38:23.250
We're actually putting ourselves,
um,

1658
01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:28.080
unknowingly in positions physically that are also creating an emotional response

1659
01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:33.320
that one of them being anxiety and angst because we're not living fully or

1660
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:36.960
closer to our natural state really should be in.

1661
01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:40.690
<v 5>Totally agree.
I've been trying to take time every day at the very least,</v>

1662
01:38:40.691 --> 01:38:43.710
even if I'm doing a lot of writing,
because I also think that,
uh,

1663
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:47.620
we're gonna find a lot of visual problems,
uh,
with,

1664
01:38:47.621 --> 01:38:51.220
with people who were only focusing between eight and 12 inches all day long.

1665
01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:56.020
So I try to get on glasses and just focus on things in the distance and really

1666
01:38:56.021 --> 01:38:59.290
take in those solar gazing nettle be you could work on that.

1667
01:38:59.291 --> 01:39:01.950
That would really help your vision.
We can distill that down.

1668
01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:06.610
But you know what you're talking about meditation and when,
when you know,

1669
01:39:06.611 --> 01:39:10.450
you come home,
you do that program because his whole thing is about meditation.

1670
01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:13.670
Oh yeah.
I mean,
at the end it's all these drills and be the ice man,

1671
01:39:13.690 --> 01:39:17.380
but it's ultimately about meditation.
Yeah.
I want to get,

1672
01:39:17.410 --> 01:39:21.310
I want to get read on the show at,
and it's so much trickle,

1673
01:39:21.311 --> 01:39:24.250
it's a mechanical meditation.
It's not,
it's not this,

1674
01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:28.840
it's not a swami kind of ethereal thing where you're like trying to grab

1675
01:39:28.841 --> 01:39:32.600
something in space.
This is mathematical.
Yeah.
And He,
uh,

1676
01:39:32.610 --> 01:39:35.530
he's first one to say,
I don't have the answer.
And you know what?

1677
01:39:35.531 --> 01:39:38.080
This guy's going to be better at it than me.
And it's okay.
It's great.

1678
01:39:38.110 --> 01:39:41.300
You'll love it.
Yeah.
He feel amazing.
All right,
let's go.
And that's,

1679
01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:44.200
that seems like wow.
And competitive out here again,
day.

1680
01:39:44.410 --> 01:39:48.840
We're going to do the best we can.
I'm like,
oh,
okay.
That's great.

1681
01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:51.430
I have to check them out.
So if you guys could make,

1682
01:39:51.690 --> 01:39:54.520
this will be last question before we,

1683
01:39:54.580 --> 01:39:58.940
I just ask where people can find everything in you're all up to,
but Brian,

1684
01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:04.000
if you could make one ask of the people listening more one record or one ask or

1685
01:40:04.001 --> 01:40:07.810
recommendation,
what would it be?
Um,

1686
01:40:08.050 --> 01:40:12.840
I honestly,
it's like,
what were you asked in the,
um,
you know,

1687
01:40:12.850 --> 01:40:16.160
sauna is like,
what,
what do you,
what,
what's tickling your fancy and it,

1688
01:40:16.161 --> 01:40:18.010
and it's the Bree,
you know,
the breathing,

1689
01:40:18.230 --> 01:40:20.800
it being more aware of your breathing because the all,
quite honestly,

1690
01:40:20.801 --> 01:40:23.800
it's exactly what Gabby just brought up and we were just talking about is when

1691
01:40:23.801 --> 01:40:27.220
you're in,
you can't breathe correctly.
When you're here,
when you're collapsed,

1692
01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:29.020
when you're clicking as a position.

1693
01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:34.000
That's basically more or less with Kelly and I have really worked our careers at

1694
01:40:34.030 --> 01:40:36.310
is,
you know,
it's about position and what your,

1695
01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:39.370
the way you move is w I understand what you're saying.

1696
01:40:39.730 --> 01:40:42.160
Like I see what's going on inside.
Don't,
you know,

1697
01:40:42.161 --> 01:40:45.910
you can't lie to me at this point.
You know?
And so I think for me,

1698
01:40:45.911 --> 01:40:47.920
ultimately it's about breathing.
And,
and honestly that's,

1699
01:40:47.921 --> 01:40:51.130
I would never have arrived at the meditation thing had it not been for the

1700
01:40:51.131 --> 01:40:54.700
breathing and it,
and it being like,
this is fun.

1701
01:40:54.850 --> 01:40:59.850
Like I'm having a blast seeing what I get out of this and how I feel after doing

1702
01:41:00.641 --> 01:41:02.320
this and going through this stuff.

1703
01:41:02.321 --> 01:41:07.210
And I think if people really were willing to figure,
see that stuff,

1704
01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:09.970
you know,
I it to take the time to do that,

1705
01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:13.480
it takes a couple of weeks and then you're like,
wow,

1706
01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:17.740
this is really something like I have not thought about regardless of what the

1707
01:41:17.741 --> 01:41:21.520
breathing is.
Right.
Where would you suggest someone start with that?

1708
01:41:21.521 --> 01:41:26.230
I honestly think people should start with Wim Hof.
Yeah,
Wim Hoff method.
Uh,

1709
01:41:26.290 --> 01:41:30.430
Google it,
you go take it.
It's a cheap course for 10 weeks.
Um,

1710
01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:34.300
of course,
you know,
we're tweaking and playing with other things and you know,

1711
01:41:34.301 --> 01:41:36.550
that's what we do.
But I honestly think the guy,

1712
01:41:36.551 --> 01:41:40.510
and we'll probably get them out here at some point.
It's doable.
It's very doable.

1713
01:41:40.630 --> 01:41:44.590
Very doable.
You know,
I,
I spam.
Yeah,
look him up guys.
He's amazing.
Yeah.

1714
01:41:44.591 --> 01:41:47.950
I have to sit in the ice.
Right.
You know,
I think it starts there.

1715
01:41:47.951 --> 01:41:50.800
And even through that with cold showers,
the fact is is it's like,

1716
01:41:50.801 --> 01:41:52.390
I don't care if you're a crossfitter,

1717
01:41:52.391 --> 01:41:54.400
if you're a professional athlete and some other sport,

1718
01:41:54.430 --> 01:41:58.150
if you don't breathe right,
your,
you've got a fault going on,

1719
01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:01.360
you've got something going on and you can expand upon it and you can understand

1720
01:42:01.361 --> 01:42:04.570
much more.
And it was,
you know,
like I said with the Eckhart Tolle a thing,

1721
01:42:04.571 --> 01:42:08.500
it's like Eckert's thing is the breath,
the breath,
because the breath is now,

1722
01:42:08.810 --> 01:42:12.190
there's nothing after that.
You're not thinking about the past.

1723
01:42:12.191 --> 01:42:13.450
You're not thinking about the future.

1724
01:42:13.451 --> 01:42:15.730
You're focused on what's happening right now.
Well,

1725
01:42:15.731 --> 01:42:18.910
the butt and the breadth and the spirit are as one because that's when the

1726
01:42:18.911 --> 01:42:22.380
baby's slapped on the button.
So 40 breaths with consciousness.

1727
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:27.400
My mom said that exact same thing to me.
But when the breath leaves,

1728
01:42:27.401 --> 01:42:31.480
the spirit leaves.
Yes.
I mean that's the breath is the spirit,
the breath of life.

1729
01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:36.570
Yeah.
So Gabby,
what would,
uh,
what would your ask or recommendation be?
Well,

1730
01:42:36.570 --> 01:42:38.640
<v 4>I,
I asked that everyone,
you know,</v>

1731
01:42:38.641 --> 01:42:42.030
I always say that we only appreciate our health when we don't have it.

1732
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:46.880
And I think,
you know,
through injuries and things,
I've learned to,
uh,

1733
01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:49.950
appreciate my health.
But I think if,
you know,

1734
01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:53.550
sort of besides your friends and family that the most important thing to cover

1735
01:42:53.551 --> 01:42:57.660
it and take care of is your self even it's just to the best of their ability.

1736
01:42:57.661 --> 01:43:00.270
Like if you're not walking today,
go walk.
You know,
if you're,

1737
01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:03.150
if you're still smoking,
you know,
smoke less.

1738
01:43:03.151 --> 01:43:05.670
Like it's not about get it all done all at once,

1739
01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:09.870
but just finding a way to make that a real priority.
Um,

1740
01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:14.850
and then my ask would be,
I always say that I'll go first.

1741
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:19.440
And so that means if I'm,
uh,
checking out at the store,

1742
01:43:19.441 --> 01:43:23.640
I'll say hello first.
If I'm coming across somebody,
make eye contact,

1743
01:43:23.641 --> 01:43:24.570
I'll smile first.

1744
01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:29.130
That I people would experiment with that and their life a little bit.
Um,

1745
01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:33.450
being first be first,
because not all times,

1746
01:43:33.451 --> 01:43:35.730
but most times it comes in your favor.

1747
01:43:35.731 --> 01:43:40.170
But then the response is pretty amazing.
Like you'll see somebody,

1748
01:43:40.171 --> 01:43:44.150
I was at the park the other day with the kids.
Oh my God,
her hurricane harbor.

1749
01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:48.390
It's like hell.
And there was these two women a little bit older than me.

1750
01:43:48.391 --> 01:43:49.860
We couldn't be more different.
Right?

1751
01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:52.520
And I walked by him and I just looked at him and smiled.

1752
01:43:53.090 --> 01:43:55.970
This smile came to their face.
So instantly they're ready.

1753
01:43:56.420 --> 01:44:00.350
But you have to go first because now we're being trained in this world.

1754
01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:03.500
Nobody's going first anymore.
So for me,

1755
01:44:03.501 --> 01:44:06.650
it's like take care of yourself because that also helps you go first sooner if

1756
01:44:06.651 --> 01:44:08.990
you feel pretty good and go first.

1757
01:44:11.010 --> 01:44:15.870
<v 7>Laird,
while they,
that's not fair.
They went first.
They did,
they did.</v>

1758
01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:19.080
They did steal some good kick their breath and they went,
you know,

1759
01:44:19.081 --> 01:44:23.190
and I think part of,
you know,
I think,
I mean,
I of course the breath is,
you know,

1760
01:44:23.210 --> 01:44:27.150
that that's,
that's,
so that's,
that's our food.

1761
01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:28.470
That's what we get when we don't eat.

1762
01:44:28.471 --> 01:44:30.780
And that's are the breadth of life and you know,

1763
01:44:30.781 --> 01:44:35.760
and going first and cherishing the temple.
Uh,
you know,
I mean,
and I,
and I,

1764
01:44:35.761 --> 01:44:39.180
and I think what Gabby said about going first leads to where what I think too,

1765
01:44:39.181 --> 01:44:42.690
and I think in the,
and again,
quoting the,

1766
01:44:42.750 --> 01:44:45.210
my latest favorite book,
natural born heroes,

1767
01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:49.140
but the compassion that I think compassion is,

1768
01:44:49.141 --> 01:44:51.600
is exercise compassion every day.

1769
01:44:51.601 --> 01:44:55.910
If you could actually go out and just exercise some form of compassion,
uh,

1770
01:44:56.190 --> 01:44:58.920
no matter what it be,
I think that's some powerful stuff.

1771
01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:02.280
I think it would be a different world if people win.
And,
and,
and,

1772
01:45:02.281 --> 01:45:05.890
and we're compassionate.
And I have to remind myself,
and that's a,
that's an ass.

1773
01:45:05.891 --> 01:45:10.560
But that's also a do for me.
I'm asking myself to do it.
Um,
and I,
and again,

1774
01:45:10.561 --> 01:45:13.650
I use that as,
you know,
what's good for the goose is good for the Gander,

1775
01:45:13.651 --> 01:45:16.530
which is,
you know,
ask of your,
what you want of yourself.

1776
01:45:16.740 --> 01:45:19.350
And then I think it's probably what,
you know,
it's like,
I like standup.

1777
01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:22.650
I like foiling.
I like this,
you know,
I like the breathing.

1778
01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:26.380
Other people will like it too,
you know?
So the mines the,

1779
01:45:26.381 --> 01:45:30.240
I think I'm the one with the compassion.
It seems like going first as a,
as a good

1780
01:45:30.690 --> 01:45:33.090
<v 4>small step in that direction.</v>

1781
01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:37.110
I think the most important thing from all of us would be don't do it.

1782
01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:41.820
It's about each person doing it their way,
that discovery,
not oh,
Laird's way.

1783
01:45:41.821 --> 01:45:45.600
Or Brian's where Gabby's where Tim's way it's about,

1784
01:45:45.870 --> 01:45:50.870
does any of the conversations spark you to motivate you to find your way because

1785
01:45:51.001 --> 01:45:53.320
that is the right way for you?
Definitely.
Um,

1786
01:45:53.370 --> 01:45:57.120
I don't believe that any of us believe in saying this is the way.

1787
01:45:57.360 --> 01:45:59.760
I mean certainly breathing,
it's hard to get around it,

1788
01:46:00.030 --> 01:46:03.630
but ultimately when do you do it?
How do you want to do it?
Whatever that is.

1789
01:46:03.631 --> 01:46:06.780
How do you want to eat whatever outside inside exercise.

1790
01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:10.770
But it's really more about you've got to put energy into finding your way.

1791
01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:15.510
<v 7>Do you want it?
Cause we're talking about emotional things,
but his,
his physical,</v>

1792
01:46:15.511 --> 01:46:20.310
hers emotional compassion,
but,
and then just drink more liquids,
hydration,

1793
01:46:20.610 --> 01:46:22.630
drink more water.
You know,
Aaron Wald,

1794
01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:23.653
<v 5>it's the,</v>

1795
01:46:24.570 --> 01:46:28.060
this all goes to you can you just said it's like be an experiment.

1796
01:46:28.810 --> 01:46:31.960
We've gotten so far away from that and I think this is where science has really

1797
01:46:31.961 --> 01:46:32.351
let us,

1798
01:46:32.351 --> 01:46:35.680
because science has really gotten far off in the fact that everybody in science

1799
01:46:35.681 --> 01:46:38.740
is trying to prove themselves right.
And that's not what science is.

1800
01:46:38.741 --> 01:46:40.600
Science is not about proving yourself,
right?

1801
01:46:40.601 --> 01:46:42.400
Science is about learning something new.

1802
01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:46.870
And that is if you aren't willing to experiment and learn it your way,

1803
01:46:47.050 --> 01:46:49.110
that's how it's going to make sense.
Like,

1804
01:46:49.130 --> 01:46:51.900
and it's like you don't just try whims way.

1805
01:46:51.901 --> 01:46:56.901
Like I have like seven different yoga breathing techniques in at this point,

1806
01:46:57.121 --> 01:47:00.270
which isn't just,
you know,
radical,
but it's like that's where it's led to.

1807
01:47:00.271 --> 01:47:02.970
And you know,
he's Laird's done it as well.
And it's,
you know,

1808
01:47:02.971 --> 01:47:07.110
that's the thing is being experiment so that you understand what works and what

1809
01:47:07.111 --> 01:47:10.680
doesn't,
not what some paper is telling me.
And also,
I mean,
what's,

1810
01:47:10.681 --> 01:47:14.270
what's really inspired me hanging out with,
with all of you guys,
uh,

1811
01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:19.700
is that another way of looking at experimentation is playing.

1812
01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:25.480
Like you guys have an element of play that I think many people lose as soon as

1813
01:47:26.821 --> 01:47:28.830
they graduate from high school or college.

1814
01:47:29.300 --> 01:47:33.890
<v 4>They tried it that one room playing.
Yeah.
And I appreciate that.
Yeah.</v>

1815
01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:37.220
<v 5>Well and also late play not be so destructive because sometimes we have a</v>

1816
01:47:37.221 --> 01:47:41.120
tendency as we get older too,
to make our play become more of a distress.

1817
01:47:41.210 --> 01:47:42.540
Vegas baby.
What I'm saying,

1818
01:47:42.541 --> 01:47:46.520
more job but our play because stop drinking and you now have a destructive

1819
01:47:46.521 --> 01:47:50.330
process and it's like what I said about Wildman and I said about every single

1820
01:47:50.331 --> 01:47:55.310
guy and I guarantee you your trainer Yup.
Has retained his youthful enthusiasm.

1821
01:47:55.311 --> 01:47:57.410
Definitely.
They both play all the time.
Exactly.

1822
01:47:57.411 --> 01:47:59.200
If you had the mom's time and trees,
yeah.

1823
01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:02.240
Then I guarantee you did they review date and it's about red tension of your

1824
01:48:02.241 --> 01:48:05.810
youthful enthusiasm that that's really about what it's about,
right?

1825
01:48:05.811 --> 01:48:10.811
It's having fun and that spirit of that child is what will lead you to be an

1826
01:48:12.230 --> 01:48:16.910
older child.
Yeah.
You'll be,
you'll be older,
young,
but you'll be young,

1827
01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:19.700
be young.
Uh,
this is great.

1828
01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:24.560
I want to close with just asking each view where we can learn more about what

1829
01:48:24.561 --> 01:48:28.990
you're up to,
your work and so on.
So Brian,
uh,
there's about seven on the,

1830
01:48:29.170 --> 01:48:33.990
on the internet or self addressed stamped envelope to no,

1831
01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:37.950
I,
I think the easiest way to get a hold of me is through,
uh,
or,

1832
01:48:37.951 --> 01:48:41.030
or find out more about what we're doing is through athletes self,

1833
01:48:41.031 --> 01:48:44.870
which athletes l.com which is going to probably try to spell that athlete cell.

1834
01:48:44.930 --> 01:48:49.930
So athlete and then c e l l like a year and a cell block got um,

1835
01:48:50.630 --> 01:48:55.150
that it,
you can get ahold of me there or you can find out with our training and

1836
01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:56.790
information,
stuff like that.
Um,

1837
01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:01.210
I'm most active on either Twitter or Instagram.
Like I will act of it.

1838
01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:05.190
Get active with people on Twitter who behave and what are your,
uh,

1839
01:49:05.210 --> 01:49:08.750
what's your handle?
Uh,
at I am on scared.

1840
01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:10.670
She's also tattooed on his knuckles,

1841
01:49:11.180 --> 01:49:13.270
tattooed on the knock and see it in the four hour body trailer.

1842
01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:16.730
It's just another way of me saying I'm going to deal with humility today.

1843
01:49:17.310 --> 01:49:21.400
Can I deal with fear?
Uh,
and,
and so it's just a constant reminder.
So,
uh,

1844
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:25.460
that those are both my handles for that.
Um,
and I'm,
I'm pretty active on there,

1845
01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:30.110
so.
Cool.
Huh?
Okay.
Yeah,
I am on scared on both Twitter and Instagram.
Yes,
Gabby?

1846
01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:30.960
<v 4>Uh,</v>

1847
01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:34.350
well I have a site [inaudible] dot com but most of my energy right now is that

1848
01:49:34.351 --> 01:49:37.200
just for people who aren't good at spelling.
B,
B,
y,

1849
01:49:37.230 --> 01:49:42.230
r e c e I know who's re spelled with a c a.com.

1850
01:49:42.361 --> 01:49:45.320
But most of my,
my energy right now is in,
um,

1851
01:49:45.390 --> 01:49:49.840
I developed a curriculum called high JAKKS and it's Hig h x.

1852
01:49:49.870 --> 01:49:53.710
And so there's a high x training.com and uh,

1853
01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:58.400
which is no joke.
Yeah,
check,
check it out,
guys.
Leaves do well.

1854
01:49:58.570 --> 01:50:03.080
But there's a community fun aspect kind of to it.
But um,
I mean anyway,

1855
01:50:03.081 --> 01:50:05.560
so I'm putting a lot of my energy into that at the moment.

1856
01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:09.250
So that's my been my main focus.
And how can people,

1857
01:50:10.370 --> 01:50:13.030
I'm like,
I am active on Instagram and Twitter,

1858
01:50:13.031 --> 01:50:17.890
which it'll be funny when you get to Laird,
it looks less,

1859
01:50:17.891 --> 01:50:22.030
less,
less frequent.
He's smart about that.
You're the smartest of us all.
Honey.

1860
01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:28.140
I,
Gabby Reese,
G A B,
B y r e e c e on,

1861
01:50:28.190 --> 01:50:31.150
on Twitter and Instagram and,
and um,

1862
01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:33.760
and if you want to know anything about Laird on his Facebook,

1863
01:50:33.761 --> 01:50:37.300
I'll tell you what we,
we posted for him in the last few days.
He's a,

1864
01:50:37.301 --> 01:50:39.910
he's so funny.
He's like,
I don't,
I don't understand.

1865
01:50:39.911 --> 01:50:42.940
Like you're telling me this is more valuable than like the actual doing.

1866
01:50:42.941 --> 01:50:45.820
And I'm like,
oh,
secretly it's becoming that way in the world

1867
01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:48.660
<v 3>we live in.
You know,
I just,
I will,
I will say,</v>

1868
01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:50.340
and maybe this is me being delusional,

1869
01:50:50.341 --> 01:50:54.430
I think that I think that the doing stolen most important.
Yeah.

1870
01:50:54.510 --> 01:50:57.240
And if you least having fun,
but the social media,

1871
01:50:57.241 --> 01:50:58.680
the showed them social media can,

1872
01:50:59.250 --> 01:51:02.850
can add velocity if you to something that is already going in the right

1873
01:51:02.851 --> 01:51:07.530
direction.
But the doing the doing is still,
I take heart like you look at,

1874
01:51:07.531 --> 01:51:10.980
say Rick,
you want to see inactive social media.
Look at Rick Rubin's stuff.

1875
01:51:11.310 --> 01:51:15.770
I don't even think it was one tweet.
He doesn't even talk to his friends.

1876
01:51:16.650 --> 01:51:20.190
That's true.
So the doing can still,

1877
01:51:20.191 --> 01:51:21.900
you can still sort of stand on the merit,

1878
01:51:21.901 --> 01:51:25.880
but the social media stuff can definitely add a add velocity,
uh,

1879
01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:31.200
at speed.
So Laird,
where can people find,
you can find your stuff.

1880
01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:31.820
Pacific

He's like,</v>

<v 6>yeah.
Amazing art in coffee.
I just let him go.</v>

1891
01:52:07.401 --> 01:52:10.390
I had a guy call me Larry for about three years.
I didn't even see,

1892
01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:14.980
I didn't even tell them why would I ruin his pop his buzzer bubble.
No.

1893
01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:16.810
And then uh,
but you could see some of this.

1894
01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:19.710
<v 3>The other stuff like uh,

<v 1>This episode is brought to you by 99 designs.</v>

1919
01:53:51.341 --> 01:53:54.640
Your one stop shop for all things graphic design related.

1920
01:53:54.670 --> 01:53:59.670
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers including

1921
01:54:00.490 --> 01:54:03.370
sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

1922
01:54:03.371 --> 01:54:07.330
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

1923
01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:10.570
the brainstorming and a lot of it took place with designers from around the

1924
01:54:10.571 --> 01:54:14.800
world and here's how it works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,

1925
01:54:14.830 --> 01:54:18.280
a website,
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

1926
01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:22.030
you submit that project and designers from around the world,

1927
01:54:22.210 --> 01:54:24.670
we'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

1928
01:54:24.910 --> 01:54:28.360
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

1929
01:54:28.361 --> 01:54:29.020
money back.

1930
01:54:29.020 --> 01:54:32.800
It's that straightforward and many of you who are listening have already used it

1931
01:54:32.801 --> 01:54:35.260
and created some amazing things that I'll be sharing in the future.

1932
01:54:35.530 --> 01:54:37.930
But in the meantime,

this episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.
I get asked all the time,

1937
01:54:56.681 --> 01:54:58.840
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

1938
01:54:59.220 --> 01:55:01.780
My answer is inevitably athletic Greens.

1939
01:55:01.781 --> 01:55:04.270
It is your all in one nutritional insurance.

1940
01:55:04.271 --> 01:55:06.010
I recommended it in the four hour body,

1941
01:55:06.070 --> 01:55:10.030
did not get paid for that and I travel with it to avoid getting sick.

1942
01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:13.060
I take it in the mornings to ensure optimal performance.

1943
01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:14.530
It just covers all my basis.

1944
01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:18.520
If I can't get what I need through whole food meals throughout the rest of the

1945
01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:23.380
day,
and you can get 50 oh my God,
50% off.
Yes,
50% off.

1949
01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:37.480
It will help you not screw up when you're doing your nutritional plannings.

1950
01:55:37.481 --> 01:55:40.960
For me,

takes a load off my mind,

1951
