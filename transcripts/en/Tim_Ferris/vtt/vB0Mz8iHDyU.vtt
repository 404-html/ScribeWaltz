00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.160
We just do a quick sound check.
Uh,

2
00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:03.780
Casey would you have for breakfast this morning?

3
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.320

Hello boys and girls.

27
00:01:43.731 --> 00:01:46.640
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

28
00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:50.600
it is my job to deconstruct world class performers,

29
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.000
whether they are just prodigies,
hedge fund managers,

30
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.210
celebrities like the Governor Arnold Schwartzenegger or say legendary music

31
00:01:59.061 --> 00:02:03.560
producers like Rick Ruben,
anyone in between military,
artistic,

32
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.663
you name it.

33
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.410
There are patterns that you can tease out and it is my job to try to find the

34
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:13.760
routines,
the habits,
the favorite books,
the meals and the timing.

35
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.010
Everything that you can apply from their life to your own to develop your own

36
00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:21.650
skills,
to develop your own version of success,

37
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:24.590
both in your personal and professional lives.

38
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.960
And this episode is no exception.

39
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.320
I had the chance to chat with Casey Neistat.

40
00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:32.420
We've been trying to get together for a very long time.

41
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.660
Casey is a fascinating film maker.

42
00:02:35.661 --> 00:02:39.890
He would also call himself a youtuber and if you look for his name on the

43
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:43.940
Interwebs,
Casey Neistat,N ,
e.
I.
S.
T.
A.
T.

44
00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:45.740
He's also at Casey Neistat on Twitter.

45
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.660
You find headlines like the following from adweek health filmmaker Casey Neistat

46
00:02:50.661 --> 00:02:51.920
gets away with murder.

47
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.180
That was the headline and talks about how he effectively took a budget than Nike

48
00:02:56.181 --> 00:02:59.380
gave him and used it to travel around the world with his friend and then had

49
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:02.860
Nike thank him for it.
Another headline from Teen Welfare,

50
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:07.390
dad to youtube icon,
both accurate.
Next headline.

51
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:11.290
Casey Neistat can pretty much do anything that he wants to see.

52
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.020
You see the pattern here and uh,
it's,

53
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:19.021
it's a very fascinating story because Casey has done the opposite of what a lot

54
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.630
of people feel you should do.
In other words,

55
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.270
he was a very popular indie director,

56
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.340
had won all sorts of awards at Sundance Popular and HBO has a wall full of

57
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:34.270
awards and move to self publishing on the Internet instead.
Right now mo,

58
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.300
most people look at say going on youtube as a starting point to stair step to

59
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.390
more traditional media and distribution.
He did the opposite.

60
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.400
He's a high school dropout and uh,

61
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:49.150
we met through a very good friend of mine named [inaudible] at the Mit media lab

62
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.130
and we cover a lot.
We cover his history,
we cover overcoming adversity.

63
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.310
We talk about his decision to Vlog that has put out one video per day and how

64
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:04.150
that decision made his popularity explode.
He's a,
he's a quirky guy,

65
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.610
he's a,
he's very well known for running.

66
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:08.530
So we talking about the physical aspect of his life,

67
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.420
he still makes a lot of his own props and there are lots of questions I wanted

68
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:17.680
to ask.
For instance,
you know,
if you are able to charge five,
six figures,

69
00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:19.900
maybe more for product placement and youtube videos,

70
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.460
why on earth would you start yet another company,
a startup,
a tech startup.

71
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.810
It's a fascinating guy.

72
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.840
I love his work and I hope you enjoy this conversation as much as I enjoyed it.

73
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.680
Say hello to Casey at Casey Neistat,
C a.
S e y.
N e.

74
00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:39.610
I.

T.
A.
T.
And without further ado,

75
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.730
please enjoy my conversation with Casey Neistat.

76
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.350
Casey,
welcome to the show.
Great to be here.

77
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.450
I have had so many requests from my fans to connect with you.

78
00:04:53.451 --> 00:04:57.500
And of course we have many mutual friends,
Ryan holiday,
a CEP Cam Var,

79
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.180
very old buddy of mine among others.
And I'm a fan of your work,

80
00:05:02.181 --> 00:05:03.230
so thanks for making the time.

81
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.990
<v 2>Yeah,
it's great to,
it's great to finally speak.</v>

82
00:05:05.991 --> 00:05:10.220
I feel like you and I've tried to actually connect physically on the phone.
Uh,

83
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.160
I think when there was a text back and forth at one point in time,

84
00:05:13.161 --> 00:05:16.220
so it's nice to finally,
uh,
it's nice to finally hear your voice.

85
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.810
<v 0>I think it's,
it's faded to happen,
you know,</v>

86
00:05:18.811 --> 00:05:22.140
things connect when they're intended to connect on some level.

87
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.180
And that having been said,

88
00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:27.810
you are in New York City and just had,

89
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.400
it would seem like the,
uh,

90
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.460
the entire squad squadron of police cars from Nyp pull up outside your house.

91
00:05:35.281 --> 00:05:37.920
This isn't like the professional or anything.
Is there any,
any,

92
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.870
any catastrophe pending outside of your

93
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.391
<v 2>no.
And,</v>

94
00:05:42.391 --> 00:05:46.090
and I warned you of that before we started recording just to let you know that

95
00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:49.000
when you hear sirens in the background or whatever it might be,

96
00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:53.890
not to be alarmed,
but I think one of,
one of the biggest battles for me,

97
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:54.110
uh,

98
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.110
of being a filmmaker making movies in New York City for 15 years now has been

99
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:04.421
figuring out how to navigate the incessant noise pollution that is downtown

100
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:08.870
Manhattan.
And to paint a little picture for your audience,
my,

101
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.380
my office is on the second floor facing Broadway.

102
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:15.650
So that means is that the exact height of all the exhaust pipes that he's really

103
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:20.200
loud buses that drive by.
And I have single pane windows.
So,
um,

104
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.310
I will try my best.
But if you,

105
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:26.600
if you hear what sounds like some sort of battle taking place in the background,

106
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:29.030
know that everything's fine.
That's just New York City.

107
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.740
<v 0>I remember very distinctly this one night when I was working on my TV show and</v>

108
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.610
we had to do voiceovers,
we had to do pickup lines and we were filming,

109
00:06:39.611 --> 00:06:41.770
I'm not going to name the hotel,
but,
uh,

110
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.580
in a hotel room in New York City that was on the third or fourth floor in a very

111
00:06:45.581 --> 00:06:46.570
busy intersection.

112
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.660
And literally every time I got three quarters of the way through any line,

113
00:06:51.851 --> 00:06:53.590
we tried this at two different times during the day.

114
00:06:53.591 --> 00:06:55.960
We had to start over and over and over.

115
00:06:55.961 --> 00:07:00.790
It was just the most maddening experience imaginable.
But,
um,
the,

116
00:07:00.791 --> 00:07:03.340
uh,
the,
how do you contend with that?
Actually,
we'll,

117
00:07:03.341 --> 00:07:08.020
we'll start there because I remember this joke that someone told me about audio

118
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.550
and they said,
you know,
why does thunder come after lightening and it,

119
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.650
because even God has to wait for audio.

120
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.830
And is that a,

121
00:07:17.831 --> 00:07:21.610
is that one of the biggest challenges of working in New York City?

122
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.430
Are there other challenges that people might not be aware of?

123
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.790
<v 2>Um,
I mean I think that's probably the most like tactal that's,</v>

124
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.930
that's probably easiest to point to,
but I'd say like,

125
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.420
to digress here,
it's,

126
00:07:33.421 --> 00:07:38.421
it's more than just the battle that is recording audio for films that this is

127
00:07:38.671 --> 00:07:42.570
noise pollution in New York City.
But my wife and I moved to,

128
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:48.650
to try back that we actually live on Broadway in New York City and the grumbling

129
00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:53.430
of a garbage truck or a cement mixer or a bus,

130
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.550
I have become so sensitive to that.

131
00:07:56.551 --> 00:08:00.000
I freak out when it goes by and my wife has to tell me to calm down.

132
00:08:00.001 --> 00:08:03.750
And it's one of the biggest reasons why I want to leave the city knock or 15

133
00:08:03.751 --> 00:08:06.030
years is it's just,

134
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:11.090
it's a noise that it's not just a noise like lightening or thunder or loud

135
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.030
music.
It's a noise that just kills all other noises.

136
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:19.470
So it's like this black cloud of sound that prevents any communication or

137
00:08:19.471 --> 00:08:23.670
conversation or human interaction.
It just destroys everything.

138
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.090
Um,
and it wrecks my world and I take it so personally.
Uh,

139
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.740
<v 0>and you've been in the city then for 15 years,</v>

140
00:08:32.741 --> 00:08:35.800
but you grew up in Connecticut,
is that right?

141
00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.950
<v 2>Yeah,
so I lived in,</v>

142
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.410
I was born and raised in southeastern Connecticut and I always,

143
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:44.580
I always sort of preface that by saying I'm from the poor part of Connecticut.

144
00:08:44.581 --> 00:08:47.760
I'm from the shitty part of Connecticut,
not Connecticut as always.

145
00:08:47.761 --> 00:08:48.840
When people think Connecticut,

146
00:08:48.841 --> 00:08:52.320
they think Greenwich and the fancy parts in Connecticut has kind of a,

147
00:08:52.321 --> 00:08:54.390
another side to those tracks.
And that's where I'm,

148
00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:00.260
<v 0>and is it true that you were on welfare at one point?
Because I was,</v>

149
00:09:00.261 --> 00:09:03.800
I was going to bring that up later in the conversation,
but I've read that.

150
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.460
And is,
is that,
is that true?
When you dry it,
it,
uh,

151
00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.030
Ryan and I have to have talked about your background and how fascinating it is,

152
00:09:11.031 --> 00:09:12.410
but,
uh,
he,

153
00:09:12.411 --> 00:09:15.830
he told me that you had dropped out of high school and then I had read that you

154
00:09:15.831 --> 00:09:16.461
were on welfare,

155
00:09:16.461 --> 00:09:20.000
but I was just hoping if you could provide some context around those kind of

156
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:20.863
early years.

157
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:26.180
<v 2>Yeah.
You know,
I,
I,
you know,
I had a,
I had a troublesome,</v>

158
00:09:26.181 --> 00:09:30.860
like adolescence,
one of four kids and my parents got a divorce when I was in,

159
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.950
I think a freshman in high school.
And I think it's always a real challenge for,

160
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.720
for any family.
But at that age,
I think it's probably the most,
you know,

161
00:09:38.721 --> 00:09:40.100
I have a grown son now who's,

162
00:09:40.101 --> 00:09:43.730
who's a senior in high school and the freshman in high school at 13 years old is

163
00:09:43.731 --> 00:09:46.410
such a vulnerable age for young people.
Um,

164
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.420
and I didn't cope very well with the issues that were happening at home.

165
00:09:50.421 --> 00:09:54.470
And I ran away from home and moved in with this girl and got her pregnant

166
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.940
because that's what teenagers do.
Um,
and you know,
I had a kid,

167
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.710
my son was born two weeks after my 17th birthday.
Um,
and you know,

168
00:10:03.711 --> 00:10:07.940
I never,
I never went back home after running away from home at age 15.

169
00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.110
I never went to my parents for money.
Um,
I just kind of,

170
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:17.130
when I say I left home,
I,
I proper laptop,
I never went back.
Um,
and yeah,
when,

171
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:21.740
when my kid was born,
we were on welfare,
we got free,
let me think,
what was it?

172
00:10:21.741 --> 00:10:25.550
We got free mill and then there was something else.
It's like welfare is,

173
00:10:25.551 --> 00:10:30.350
you get this,
you get this credit card that you can spend money on,
on anything.

174
00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.410
Um,
and then you get free milk and maybe free diapers.

175
00:10:33.411 --> 00:10:35.340
I don't really remember how it worked as long time ago,

176
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:39.080
but certainly it was very helpful at that time of my life.

177
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.180
<v 0>And the,</v>

178
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:46.570
how did the bridge from that point to film come about because,

179
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.920
and we'll talk about some,
some of your specific work,

180
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:57.610
but how did that develop the sort of interest in foray into filmmaking?

181
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.370
<v 2>Uh,
you know,
I think that it's funny cause it,
Tim,</v>

182
00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:06.990
that question itself is something that I've only really been started to examine

183
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.020
in the last couple of years of my career.
Um,

184
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.380
as people ask me more and more and especially with the launch of my tech company

185
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.910
and looking back at it,
I think it's a pretty specific thing,

186
00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:20.280
which is that you was one of four kids.

187
00:11:20.281 --> 00:11:23.190
It was like the middle of sort of forgotten child,
not the youngest,

188
00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:26.520
not the oldest,
not the girl,
but the other one that was me.
Um,

189
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.270
so I always was sort of the loudest to get the most attention because nobody

190
00:11:30.271 --> 00:11:34.530
paid attention to me.
Um,
so with my psychiatrist says anyways and,

191
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:39.930
and I,
I think like when my older brother Van who I credit with getting me into

192
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.200
filmmaking when he showed me in,

193
00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:46.980
in 2000 or 1999 and how the first Imac,

194
00:11:46.981 --> 00:11:50.850
that big blue bubbly looking imac thing,
how you could edit video on that.

195
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:55.540
I just saw something that really captured my imagination.
And when,

196
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.320
uh,
he and I edited the very first thing I ever edited,
which is taking my,

197
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:01.000
at the time baby son to the zoo.

198
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:06.390
All of a sudden I saw this opportunity to take what was an idea or set of ideas

199
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:09.640
that really existed in my head and turn it into something tangible,

200
00:12:09.641 --> 00:12:13.780
turning into something that I could then share with people and for someone who

201
00:12:13.781 --> 00:12:15.490
had spent my whole life,

202
00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:20.050
then I'll 18 years of at 19 years of it feel like I never had a voice all of a

203
00:12:20.051 --> 00:12:22.510
sudden via filmmaking.
Um,

204
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.090
I sort of felt like I had a voice at a loudspeaker.

205
00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:31.280
<v 0>That makes perfect sense.
And from that,
from that feeling,</v>

206
00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:32.810
um,
let's,

207
00:12:32.811 --> 00:12:36.500
let's flash forward for a second because I really want to introduce people to

208
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.770
some of your work if they haven't seen it before.

209
00:12:39.771 --> 00:12:44.660
But could you talk about bike lanes or make it count?
Whichever came first.

210
00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:49.110
<v 2>Yeah,
bike lanes came first,
but,
um,
bike lanes is a really good example of that.</v>

211
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:53.880
Bike lanes is probably,
there's only been a,
how do I preface this?

212
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.990
People ask,
like,
where do you come up with the ideas for your movie?
And I said,

213
00:12:56.991 --> 00:13:00.210
I always say like,
whatever affects me,
whatever impacts and you,

214
00:13:00.211 --> 00:13:02.610
whatever I care about is what I make your movie about.

215
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.400
And bike lanes is a movie I made in 2010.

216
00:13:05.401 --> 00:13:09.330
I think maybe it's 2011 where in I was given a,
uh,

217
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.900
a summons from a police officer for riding my bike outside of the bike lanes,

218
00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:18.150
which for starters it turns out is not an actual infraction.
Um,
but beyond that,

219
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:22.110
it really frustrated me because I wasn't breaking any laws and I felt that I was

220
00:13:22.111 --> 00:13:24.720
doing something that was completely just,
um,

221
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.540
and I think what most people would have done is maybe gone to court and fought

222
00:13:27.541 --> 00:13:30.750
that $50 summons and probably would have won and wasted a half of their day in

223
00:13:30.751 --> 00:13:31.584
the process.

224
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.700
But I redirected my anger and I made a movie that really expressed my

225
00:13:35.701 --> 00:13:39.460
frustration but did it in a somewhat sardonic way.
Um,

226
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.340
and that movie went tremendously viral online.

227
00:13:42.341 --> 00:13:44.670
It was seen like 5 million times and it's the first day.

228
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:49.170
And this was before I had an audience on Youtube.
Um,
and at one point in time,

229
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.340
Mayor Bloomberg actually I actually had to respond to a question about the video

230
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:57.520
in a press conference.
Um,
so yeah,

231
00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.251
that's a very,

232
00:13:59.251 --> 00:14:04.251
that's a really literal example of me being a frustrated kid and wishing I had a

233
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.490
way for everyone to hear in a way to share my frustrations.

234
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.210
And that movie is very much so a,

235
00:14:11.211 --> 00:14:15.210
a compartmentalization at that exact emotion.
And then outcome

236
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:16.890
<v 0>knowing in concrete terms.</v>

237
00:14:16.891 --> 00:14:19.680
Can you give people sort of a visual though for what you,

238
00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:21.330
you ended up doing in that film?

239
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.810
<v 2>Yes.
It's very buster,
very buster Keaton in Hawaii.</v>

240
00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:30.540
I think cops argument was predicated on this idea that the bike lanes are there

241
00:14:30.721 --> 00:14:33.270
to keep you safe.
The bike lanes are for cyclists.

242
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:35.670
I was writing outside of the bike lanes,

243
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.320
therefore I was unsafe and should be summoned,
uh,
are given a sentence.

244
00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.011
Um,

245
00:14:41.011 --> 00:14:44.070
so I made a movie where it just sort of start from the beginning where I say the

246
00:14:44.071 --> 00:14:47.290
cops and had to stay in the bike lane no matter what.
And no matter what is,

247
00:14:47.291 --> 00:14:51.830
is underscored and I proceed to ride my bike around New York City into

248
00:14:51.831 --> 00:14:54.710
everything that is in the bike lanes,

249
00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:59.100
preventing people from actually cycling safely within the lanes themselves.
Um,

250
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.590
and that sort of crescendo is when I,

251
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:04.310
when I crashed into a police car that was parked in the middle of a bite.

252
00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:08.440
<v 0>Right.
So with something like that,</v>

253
00:15:08.441 --> 00:15:13.441
now the bike lanes taking this frustration or dissatisfaction and scratching

254
00:15:14.651 --> 00:15:19.480
your own itch,
which segues nicely into tech and we'll,
we'll get to that also.

255
00:15:19.481 --> 00:15:19.851
I mean all,

256
00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:23.350
almost all of the best founders I know are scratching their own itch when they

257
00:15:23.351 --> 00:15:27.220
create a product or a service.
Uh,
I mean,
for instance,

258
00:15:27.221 --> 00:15:31.870
with the,
looking at the,
the iPod batteries and whatnot.

259
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.930
Have you had,

260
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:37.870
have you had a case where you vented frustration in a public way that you

261
00:15:37.871 --> 00:15:40.660
regretted after the fact or wished you'd handled differently?

262
00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:47.310
<v 2>Regrets,
a strong word,
but one that I look back on and sort of shake my head was,</v>

263
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:52.170
um,
as very young,
when was this?
I'm trying to come up with a year for you,
Tim.

264
00:15:52.171 --> 00:15:55.000
And I don't know,
but I was probably 22 or something like that and I was,

265
00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:55.771
it was a real,

266
00:15:55.771 --> 00:15:59.550
I was a nobody then nobody knew who I was and I just made a movie with my

267
00:15:59.551 --> 00:16:04.410
brother about bicycle captain New York City and they invited us on morning,

268
00:16:04.411 --> 00:16:09.411
local morning news to talk about bike that then they wanted us to recreate a

269
00:16:09.571 --> 00:16:11.780
bike being stolen.
Um,

270
00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:16.530
and we showed up there and this woman who was the,
uh,

271
00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:17.670
the host of the morning,

272
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:23.130
the morning news was so rude to us cause we were just kids or two kids show up

273
00:16:23.131 --> 00:16:25.860
early in the morning.
She was so rude and so mean to us.

274
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:31.430
And then she swore at her intern in front of us and we're just like,

275
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.420
my God,
this is a woman.
Who does she think she is.
So we,

276
00:16:34.421 --> 00:16:37.610
we kind of pranked her on air.
And my brother pretended to cut,

277
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:41.430
cut me when he was releasing the bike.
And I,
this was,

278
00:16:41.431 --> 00:16:45.210
I want to say like maybe when youtube had just come out,
this is like,

279
00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.830
so it hadn't been 2005,

280
00:16:46.831 --> 00:16:51.480
2006 and that scene when crazy,

281
00:16:51.481 --> 00:16:53.520
crazy,
crazy viral.
Um,

282
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:58.050
and it's basically this woman talking to camera about what's taking place and

283
00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.750
here they are demonstrating a bike lock and then all of a sudden I start

284
00:17:00.751 --> 00:17:03.480
screaming and dropped to the ground and squeeze Kevin.
It's all over myself.

285
00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.540
And at no point in time did anyone,

286
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:11.460
especially the woman think that it was real.
I'm not a very good actor.
Um,

287
00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:16.120
I had ketchup packets all over me and my brother was like shaking his head.
Um,

288
00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.080
but her response is what got people so excited?

289
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:24.080
Cause she freaked out a few very quickly turned into that Werewolf that was

290
00:17:24.721 --> 00:17:28.350
wearing it in turns earlier in the day.
And in any event,
um,

291
00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:32.700
it became this huge story.
It was all over the New York Post and it was like,
uh,

292
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:37.590
you know,
they,
they vilified her and it was whatever it was,
what it was.

293
00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.950
But looking back at it like I'm not a huge fan of pranks.

294
00:17:40.951 --> 00:17:44.010
I'm not a huge fan at a laugh that's at someone else's expense.

295
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:48.180
And I think so much of the response to that was,
was out of context.

296
00:17:48.181 --> 00:17:50.040
Like the world didn't that this,
that were,

297
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.290
that I was doing this because this one was mean to me.

298
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.460
The world disarmed me being kind of like a,

299
00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.590
a prankster and that's an image that I don't like to project.
So the,

300
00:17:58.591 --> 00:18:03.540
the facts that is ms contextualized I think is sort of a silly,

301
00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:07.650
uh,
was a silly thing.
That was the the bike thief.
Yeah.
Not,

302
00:18:07.651 --> 00:18:10.560
and not the video itself cause this,
this little prank that we pulled on there,

303
00:18:10.561 --> 00:18:12.930
I think that it was,
it sort of lacked the,

304
00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:19.380
it lacked the societal or cultural relevance of maybe some of my other a yippee

305
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:24.250
movies that that definitely had a purpose.
This was much more of just a,

306
00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.890
just being a jerk prankster trying to go,

307
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.600
which is definitely not how I described anything else that I've ever done in the

308
00:18:30.601 --> 00:18:31.530
tenure of my career.

309
00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:36.200
<v 0>When when someone asks you,
what do you do these days,
how do you answer that?</v>

310
00:18:36.201 --> 00:18:38.900
I'm sure it depends on the context,
but in general,

311
00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.640
how do you respond to that question?

312
00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:45.600
<v 2>Oh,
I'm a youtuber.
Got It.
You know,
it used to say,
uh,</v>

313
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:50.150
in my Twitter bio that Casey Neistat,
creator of the HBO series,

314
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:54.530
at one point in time I said that I like a award winning film maker.

315
00:18:54.531 --> 00:18:55.880
I don't think I gave myself that title,

316
00:18:55.881 --> 00:18:59.100
but others that's not an inaccurate title.
Um,

317
00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:02.910
and now and I just take a big step back and I say,
what am I,

318
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:06.020
how do I want to be identified?
Um,

319
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.700
I think being a youtuber or being sort of being like every other kid on youtube

320
00:19:10.701 --> 00:19:12.290
is,
is maybe the most flattering,

321
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.550
a flattering context for me to live in.
Um,

322
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.290
I like tech entrepreneur,

323
00:19:18.291 --> 00:19:23.291
but it's a such a pretentious kind of stupid title that if there were,

324
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.880
if there were an easier way to say that,

325
00:19:25.881 --> 00:19:28.640
if there were a lesson knowing where to say Tech Entrepreneur,

326
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.840
I would say that that's it because 90% of my time is my technology company and

327
00:19:32.841 --> 00:19:34.460
10% is creating youtube videos,

328
00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:39.910
but 90% of my efforts and the tech company are internal facing and not external

329
00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:44.540
facing and 100% of what I do on Youtube,
um,
go straight out to the world.

330
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:48.470
So for all those reasons I identify most as a youtuber.

331
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.340
<v 0>And uh,
let's,
let's talk about one of your most,</v>

332
00:19:53.341 --> 00:19:57.900
if not the most,
correct me if I'm wrong,
popular video on your Youtube Channel,

333
00:19:57.901 --> 00:20:00.030
which is make it count.
Is that still the most popular

334
00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:03.960
<v 2>think?
So,
I don't know.
The one I released,
uh,</v>

335
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:08.280
when I released 38 minutes ago,
I hope gets more,
more views than that.

336
00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.540
Um,
yeah.
And make it count is a really,

337
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.240
is a really interesting case study.

338
00:20:15.241 --> 00:20:18.860
10 because that was such an inflection point in my career as a filmmaker

339
00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:25.660
who historically I had directed advertisements as a main primary means of

340
00:20:26.191 --> 00:20:30.570
income,
um,
which is a really convoluted,
unnecessarily complicated,

341
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:34.950
somewhat ridiculous process.
We're just a tremendous amount of money is wasted.

342
00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:35.971
And at the end of the day,

343
00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:39.840
you turn out something that is sort of creativity by committee,
which is mushy,

344
00:20:39.841 --> 00:20:41.700
invisible and just no one cares about.

345
00:20:41.701 --> 00:20:45.740
And that's how I described 99% of all advertising that's done.
Um,

346
00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.100
and after Mayfield show,
when I was trying to figure out what to do

347
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.460
<v 3>with my career,
I went to the production company that represented me,</v>

348
00:20:51.461 --> 00:20:54.670
the company that brought me my advertising gigs.
And I said,

349
00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:56.860
all I want to do is make awesome videos,

350
00:20:56.861 --> 00:21:00.280
put them on the Internet and then find companies that'll give me money to make

351
00:21:00.281 --> 00:21:03.460
awesome videos like my other videos,
but I'll do it for them.

352
00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.370
And my production company shook their head at me and they said,
good luck.

353
00:21:06.371 --> 00:21:07.660
It will never work like that.

354
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.020
So I immediately stopped working with them and I went on my own.

355
00:21:11.021 --> 00:21:13.960
I kind of went rogue and somewhere in there,

356
00:21:13.961 --> 00:21:17.410
Nike came to me in and I did this tiny project with them,

357
00:21:17.411 --> 00:21:19.600
which led to a larger project,
which was a three,

358
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:23.870
a three movie at three Internet movie deal.
Um,

359
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.120
and the first two movies were right down the line.
They were,

360
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:30.640
there were what you'd expect.
I had big,
big,
huge,
you know,

361
00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:34.270
a hundred million dollar athletes.
And then there were very well received.

362
00:21:34.271 --> 00:21:37.570
I loved making them,
but when it came time to make the third movie,

363
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:41.410
I was really burnt out from,
from the process.

364
00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:44.650
And at the Ninth Hour I called my editor up and I said,
hey,

365
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.100
let's not make this advertisement.
Let's not make this movie.
And said,

366
00:21:48.101 --> 00:21:49.840
let's do something I've always wanted to do,

367
00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:54.650
which is let's just say the entire production budget and travel the world,
um,

368
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:58.450
until we run out of money and we'll record that and we'll make some sort of

369
00:21:58.451 --> 00:22:03.190
movie about that.
And he said,
you're crazy.
But sure.
It wasn't his ass.

370
00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:06.910
It was mine.
And that's,
that's exactly what we did and make it count,

371
00:22:06.911 --> 00:22:11.830
became this video about running around the world and sort of chasing after what

372
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:14.260
matters to you.
And that was the point.

373
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.690
That was the message of the campaign was to make it count,

374
00:22:16.691 --> 00:22:18.700
was to make every moment in life counts.

375
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:24.300
So there was something sort of poetic about the fact that by us going rogue and

376
00:22:24.401 --> 00:22:26.890
taking this budget and doing something we weren't supposed to do,

377
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:30.790
but that's something that narrative was so perfectly in line with their

378
00:22:30.791 --> 00:22:35.791
messaging that in the end we had something that they were tremendously excited

379
00:22:36.041 --> 00:22:37.950
about.
And that was an,

380
00:22:37.951 --> 00:22:41.250
I'm not sure any Morton because I haven't checked on Youtube.
Um,

381
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.250
but that was Nike's most watched video on,

382
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:48.310
on the Internet for a number of years.

383
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.730
And everyone's really excited about the way that it turned out.

384
00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:53.980
What did the phrasing,

385
00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:59.220
what was your phrasing and the first phone call or email when you gave Nike the

386
00:23:01.361 --> 00:23:04.510
heads up on what you'd actually done?
Sure.

387
00:23:04.511 --> 00:23:08.740
So a little context for your,
for your listeners out there.
The,

388
00:23:08.741 --> 00:23:11.740
the video literally opens with scrolling text that says,

389
00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:15.280
Nike gave me a budget to make them a commercial.

390
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:18.500
Instead I blew the budget travelling the world.
Um,

391
00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:21.110
and that's literally what happened.
So,

392
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:26.290
so some details around that to color in what happens specifically?
It was like,

393
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:30.490
firstly,
this was the smallest budget of all three budgets for all three videos.

394
00:23:30.491 --> 00:23:35.020
So this is the kind of budget that I would say would be equivalent to what Nike

395
00:23:35.021 --> 00:23:36.970
typically spends on craft services,

396
00:23:36.971 --> 00:23:41.410
what they typically spend on snacks for one of their huge music for one of their

397
00:23:41.411 --> 00:23:46.220
huge advertisements.
So there wasn't that much accountability on of that.
They

398
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.330
<v 2>knew me,
they trusted me,</v>

399
00:23:47.331 --> 00:23:50.150
and they weren't working with me because they thought I could make them a

400
00:23:50.151 --> 00:23:51.350
perfect TV commercial.

401
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:54.260
They were working with me because they wanted something different.

402
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:58.610
So I called them before,
before I did this,
before it took off and I said,
look,

403
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:02.360
I'm not going to do the treatment,
um,
treatments,
like a script.

404
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.030
I'm not going to follow this.
I'm gonna do something different.
And they said,

405
00:24:05.031 --> 00:24:07.640
okay,
what are you going to do?
And I said,
I don't know,

406
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:11.390
but I'm going to travel and it's going to be great.
And they just said like,

407
00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.570
it was one executive in particular as got into Alex Lopez.

408
00:24:14.571 --> 00:24:19.100
He's still at Nike and he's an incredible creative genius.
And he was like,
Casey,

409
00:24:19.101 --> 00:24:24.080
just don't screw me over here.
I said,
I was like,
Alex,
no promises,

410
00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.200
but we're going to go.
Um,

411
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.220
and then we were sort of like radio blackout for the next,
for the next 10 days.

412
00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:34.790
You know,
we,
how we did that movie and you know,

413
00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:37.940
we hit like whatever 15 countries and in nine days.

414
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:42.230
But we had a girl here in New York City and she was working pretty much around

415
00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:42.681
the clock.

416
00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:46.490
And if you get an email from me from whatever Internet cafe I was in saying we

417
00:24:46.491 --> 00:24:48.030
want to go here next,
um,

418
00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:52.250
and then she would figure out how to make it happen until the money dried up.

419
00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:56.420
<v 0>And when you were doing that,
I mean,
you've,</v>

420
00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:58.830
you've done a fair amount of traveling.
I mean did,
did you,

421
00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:03.980
do you have any particular routines or tricks for maintaining sanity or at least

422
00:25:06.901 --> 00:25:11.901
minimizing a completely burning yourself out when following that type of

423
00:25:12.391 --> 00:25:13.224
schedule?

424
00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:17.620
<v 2>Um,
well firstly,
that type of schedule is a unique type of schedule that is,</v>

425
00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:23.080
that is like defcon one total chaos schedule that's completely unsustainable,

426
00:25:23.081 --> 00:25:23.801
unrealistic.

427
00:25:23.801 --> 00:25:28.390
And that I would advise no human being on earth to ever attempt that.

428
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:33.220
I like that one detail to that.
I did it with my best friend Max and we went,

429
00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:38.250
it wasn't till our sixth night of travel that we slept horizontally and that's

430
00:25:39.191 --> 00:25:42.280
not like you were keeping track.
So we were sleeping upright.

431
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:46.270
Coach seats either on airplanes are on buses,
like going from,

432
00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:50.440
from Zambia to to Kenya.
Like we just,

433
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.240
we never ever laid down.
And I remember our,

434
00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:57.220
our feet were so swelled were so swollen that we couldn't get them into our

435
00:25:57.221 --> 00:26:00.960
shoes.
We just had these big fat,
swollen feet.
Um,

436
00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:05.440
so I recommend it for no one.
Uh,
that said,
I still travel quite a bit.

437
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:09.970
Um,
and I consider myself like a real expert when it comes to traveling.

438
00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:10.610
10 you're,

439
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:14.800
you're someone who has probably define what it means to hack life better than

440
00:26:14.801 --> 00:26:18.760
anyone else.
When it comes to traveling though,
I think that,
uh,

441
00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:22.960
I've got a really good grip on where all the loopholes and shortcuts are to

442
00:26:22.961 --> 00:26:27.961
really like remove the hate that is a commercial aviation.

443
00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.920
<v 0>Could you give a,
could you give people a taste?
Well sure.
And it,</v>

444
00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:35.730
it's funny cause you tweeted earlier and I know you have a video I saw,

445
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.530
I saw some fans link back to it.

446
00:26:37.531 --> 00:26:39.780
So I'd love for you to give a little bit of color on that.

447
00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.010
<v 2>You tweeted earlier today,
what did I ask Casey and our,
our interview</v>

448
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.470
<v 3>today and somebody tweeted back,
uh,
some,</v>

449
00:26:46.471 --> 00:26:50.310
something negative about the movie I made about how to get free upgrades or do

450
00:26:50.311 --> 00:26:53.070
my investors get angry because I only fly first class.

451
00:26:53.071 --> 00:26:57.300
And the truth is if you fly enough,
you can really,

452
00:26:57.301 --> 00:27:01.020
really crack the whole system.
That is,
that is flying commercial.

453
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.950
That said,
it's very important to say this loud and clear.

454
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:08.280
If you don't fly a ton,
if you don't,

455
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.880
if you don't spend at least 200,000 miles in the air a year,

456
00:27:11.881 --> 00:27:15.840
which is that which is about six times around the earth,
if you don't do that,

457
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:19.560
none of these tricks work.
These only work if you fly a lot,

458
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.060
but if you fly a lot and you fly with one airline and you really climbed the top

459
00:27:24.061 --> 00:27:27.510
of the heap,
which is airline status and you build a relationship,

460
00:27:27.511 --> 00:27:32.511
you can almost always ensure that you will get special treatment and after

461
00:27:33.361 --> 00:27:35.820
flying a lot of kind of makes sense.
Like if you're the airline,

462
00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:40.260
why should you cater to a mass audience that just goes on Kayak in search of the

463
00:27:40.261 --> 00:27:43.410
cheapest flights and then jumps on a plane?
There's no loyalty there.

464
00:27:43.411 --> 00:27:45.900
There's nothing there that incentivizes someone to fly with you.

465
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:50.880
But someone like me who spends ungodly amounts of money flying and traveling

466
00:27:50.881 --> 00:27:51.714
every year,
of course,

467
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.100
of course I want to court my influence and my loyalty and that courtship is

468
00:27:56.101 --> 00:27:59.010
something that you can exploit to your own benefit.

469
00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:02.510
And I guess that's how I describe what it means to hack hack commercial.

470
00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:05.440
<v 0>Do you,
uh,
if,</v>

471
00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:08.620
if you traveling and trying to travel light,

472
00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:12.730
but you're going to be recording video,
what is your Goto g,

473
00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.390
what is your Goto kit look like?
What type of gear?

474
00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.260
<v 3>Well,
I always,
I always travel light.</v>

475
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:21.960
It doesn't matter whether I'm going somewhere for an overnight,

476
00:28:21.961 --> 00:28:25.050
you're going somewhere for a month and a half.
I always have the same setup,

477
00:28:25.051 --> 00:28:29.550
which is one small as big as it can possibly be while still be a carry on,

478
00:28:29.551 --> 00:28:30.420
rolling suitcase.

479
00:28:30.421 --> 00:28:35.260
And then my backpack and all of my camera years in my backpack and my laptop and

480
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:38.010
all my,
everything else is in the rolling suitcase.

481
00:28:38.011 --> 00:28:41.850
But literally I can't fit a pair of socks into my backpack,

482
00:28:41.851 --> 00:28:46.851
so I always have to have the second bag with the miscellaneous is in clothing in

483
00:28:47.431 --> 00:28:50.610
it.
Um,
but camera gear's pretty cut and dry eye.

484
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.240
I always have a point and shoot and then I always have an SLR.

485
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:58.430
<v 0>What type of point and shoot and Slr do you do you've currently favor?</v>

486
00:28:59.030 --> 00:28:59.960
<v 3>Well,
I,
I,
I,</v>

487
00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.800
this is not by any means an endorsement because I can talk ad nauseum about why

488
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:09.260
this hardware is absolutely terrible and everything's wrong.

489
00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:14.150
Everything that's wrong with it.
Um,
but it's my current favorite.
So again,

490
00:29:14.151 --> 00:29:16.610
this is not an endorsement of any capacity,

491
00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.930
but I currently use the Canon 70 d as my main shooter,

492
00:29:20.931 --> 00:29:24.950
including all my blogs.
And I do that because it's the only one that has,

493
00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:30.580
it has the best auto focus technology of any SLR in the market.
Uh,

494
00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:33.620
and when you're shooting with one hand,
you can't be pulling focus.

495
00:29:33.621 --> 00:29:35.650
So that's why I use that.
And then my,

496
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:39.770
my latest point and shoot is the Sony rx 100,
which has been great.

497
00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.280
Uh,
but there are some reliability

498
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:46.780
<v 4>issues there,
which is exactly what I expect from Sony is reliability issues.</v>

499
00:29:46.781 --> 00:29:50.040
So what is still far more affection?

500
00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.970
<v 0>What is your,
what is your postproduction look like?
What are you using to,</v>

501
00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.290
what are the tools that you use for editing and post?

502
00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:01.530
<v 4>So I just use final cut 10,
which is really terrible software.</v>

503
00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.560
It's just not great.
It's there.

504
00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:08.520
They're very real reliability concerns around it and it almost feels like it's

505
00:30:08.521 --> 00:30:13.320
been handicapped by apple to appeal more to them the consumer and prose humor

506
00:30:13.321 --> 00:30:14.670
than the professional market,

507
00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:19.200
which is a antithetical to final cut seven and every previous iteration,

508
00:30:19.201 --> 00:30:22.150
which was absolutely professional editing software.
Um,

509
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.060
I think they make this for,

510
00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:28.050
for people that don't consider themselves pro one a lot of options.

511
00:30:28.051 --> 00:30:32.070
So there's some benefits to that and some distractions to that.
Uh,

512
00:30:32.071 --> 00:30:35.760
and I feel like I've sort of maxed out what the,
what the software is capable of.

513
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:39.560
Um,
and now I'm really starting to feel the fact that it's not,
uh,

514
00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:43.590
it's not as capable as,
as other professional grade editing software.

515
00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:48.140
<v 0>Is there a,
is there any other software that you use in addition to,
uh,</v>

516
00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.110
in addition to that?

517
00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:54.540
<v 4>Not really.
Um,
you know,
I,
I'm all about speed and efficiency.</v>

518
00:30:54.541 --> 00:30:58.600
I upload every single day.
Um,
so with that,
you,

519
00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.740
you lack the opportunity to spend a tremendous amount of time,

520
00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:06.150
color grading or bringing into aftereffects to clean up or do the kinds of

521
00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:11.010
things that technologies and software enabled us to do.
Um,

522
00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:15.480
I have much less of an appreciation for what technology can bring my work and

523
00:31:15.481 --> 00:31:20.481
much more of an appreciation for the craft of storytelling and in communicating

524
00:31:20.911 --> 00:31:23.640
ideas and sharing messages,
which does not necessitate

525
00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.380
the kinds of things that technology enables you to do today.

526
00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:34.090
<v 0>So looking at,
say other people taking a stab at Youtube,
what,</v>

527
00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:38.920
what are the biggest wastes of time generally speaking in your mind?
Or how,

528
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:41.130
how do novices waste the most time,

529
00:31:41.131 --> 00:31:45.510
whether it's in the filming stage or an in post or otherwise?

530
00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.480
<v 4>I mean,
I,
I think it's much,
it's less technical than anything else.</v>

531
00:31:49.481 --> 00:31:53.710
I think that the biggest waste of energy and resources on,

532
00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.091
uh,

533
00:31:55.091 --> 00:32:00.091
on youtube as you see youtube creators trying to copy and be exactly like

534
00:32:00.401 --> 00:32:02.050
someone else.
Um,

535
00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:05.410
and the only thing that succeeds on youtube are people that are thinking outside

536
00:32:05.411 --> 00:32:09.860
the box doing new things.
Uh,
and I can talk about that.
Uh,
you know,

537
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:10.840
until,
uh,

538
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:15.070
until the cows come home because it's something I believe in so profoundly.
But,

539
00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:16.240
you know,

540
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:21.240
youtube is built on originality and built on unfounded genres and styles of

541
00:32:22.391 --> 00:32:26.350
content creation.
Um,
you know,
I think it's 2011.

542
00:32:26.351 --> 00:32:30.800
Youtube spent $200 million,
uh,
sorry for that.

543
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:36.280
But they said they spent $200 million on,
um,

544
00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.100
giving these huge budgets and known production

545
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:44.360
<v 3>entities that is like the MTVs of the world.
And like Lacma for example,</v>

546
00:32:44.361 --> 00:32:47.540
and all these big entities,
200 million bucks,
they'd start youtube channels.

547
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:51.950
So original high quality content would be made just for youtube and every one of

548
00:32:51.951 --> 00:32:55.580
them failed.
And at the same time that they were failing as $200 million,

549
00:32:55.581 --> 00:32:58.190
we're evaporating all of these individuals,

550
00:32:58.191 --> 00:33:00.950
all these young people creating content that fit into,
you know,

551
00:33:00.951 --> 00:33:05.930
categories came up on youtube and a huge way.
And now it's those creators,

552
00:33:05.931 --> 00:33:09.710
those original creators that are defining what youtube is,

553
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:13.490
and they're defining it in a way that does not exist inside any of the norms of

554
00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:15.980
filmmaking.
In fact,
almost without exception,

555
00:33:15.981 --> 00:33:19.760
most of the successful content creators on youtube don't come from a filmmaking

556
00:33:19.761 --> 00:33:23.090
background,
but instead they've sort of,
uh,
they've,

557
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.230
they've like metastasize what is,
uh,
uh,

558
00:33:27.231 --> 00:33:30.080
capability elsewhere,
like a,
an understanding elsewhere.

559
00:33:30.081 --> 00:33:34.190
And they've turned that into success on Youtube.
Tyler Oakley was big on Tumbler,

560
00:33:34.191 --> 00:33:38.390
use a big blogger and he turned that into being a vlogger.
And now he has,

561
00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:43.220
he's is tremendously influential,
essentially talk show hosts,
which is,

562
00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.290
which is what he does via youtube.

563
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:48.900
<v 0>And what I'll,</v>

564
00:33:48.901 --> 00:33:52.490
I'll tell you how I first came in contact with your work,
which was,

565
00:33:52.491 --> 00:33:56.570
I was having a conversation with a friend of mine named Jason Harris,

566
00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.220
who works at a company called mechanism.

567
00:33:58.221 --> 00:34:02.750
They do a lot of work with youtube offers and uh,
he's a very,
very smart guy.

568
00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:08.230
And I was lamenting the fact that I felt like,
uh,

569
00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.730
the ship had sailed on Youtube for me and that it was,

570
00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:14.510
it was not the best fit because I couldn't find,

571
00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:19.460
it was hard for me to find popular youtube who were not appealing primarily to

572
00:34:19.461 --> 00:34:23.570
say like the 12 to 15 year old demographic with like super fast cuts,

573
00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:28.010
um,
and with a very,
very particular style.

574
00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.610
And I was pointed to your work because a number of folks,

575
00:34:31.611 --> 00:34:36.530
including Jason said it was very smart and probably hit a similar demographic,

576
00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:38.320
not so that I could copy it,
but the,

577
00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:42.590
so I could look at it as a potential role model.
So for,
for,
for someone,

578
00:34:42.591 --> 00:34:46.790
let's say in my shoes where I'm comfortable with text,

579
00:34:46.791 --> 00:34:49.710
I'm comfortable with audio,
haven't done as much video,
all that.

580
00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.030
Although I've dabbled in television,
I,

581
00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:59.120
I am fascinated by the allure and promise and direct connection that youtube

582
00:34:59.121 --> 00:35:03.320
offers.
How would you suggest someone like me gets started,
um,

583
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:07.190
on Youtube?
Would it be with a daily Vlog?
Would it be with something else?

584
00:35:07.191 --> 00:35:11.300
How should I kind of get my feet wet and start getting enthusiastic about it?

585
00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:12.230
<v 3>You know,</v>

586
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:16.760
I often get asked about what is the best way to achieve success on Youtube.

587
00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:19.730
And the truth is if there were any one defined path,

588
00:35:19.731 --> 00:35:24.620
if there were anything that was sort of a quantifiable or anything that could be

589
00:35:24.621 --> 00:35:27.590
written out,
I think a lot of people would,
would follow that trajectory.

590
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:30.470
The reality is pretty far from that though.
There are,

591
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:32.060
I don't know what the exact number is,

592
00:35:32.061 --> 00:35:37.061
but I think it's 1.1 billion different channels on youtube and there are 400

593
00:35:37.471 --> 00:35:41.250
hours of content uploaded every minute of every day to youtube.

594
00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:46.790
So like the vastness,
the depth that is the ocean of Youtube is,

595
00:35:46.791 --> 00:35:51.020
is this huge abyss.
It's very hard to stand out.
Um,

596
00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:54.380
and the only thing that I can say,
the only advice I ever give is,

597
00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.080
is don't think,
um,

598
00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:59.940
consideration will not yield success on Youtube.

599
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:04.560
I think it's purely based around action.
Um,
some other things that I,

600
00:36:04.561 --> 00:36:09.270
I put is like quantity matters.
It's not just the quality of the work.

601
00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:11.850
Um,
but it's also the quantity of the work.

602
00:36:11.851 --> 00:36:15.300
People look to youtube not to find great wellmade films.

603
00:36:15.301 --> 00:36:19.200
They look there for relationships.
Um,
I think that's why.
Yeah,

604
00:36:19.201 --> 00:36:22.530
I think that's why when you look at like,
I don't know,
who can I pick on?

605
00:36:22.531 --> 00:36:23.730
Look at Vanity Fair.

606
00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:28.170
Vanity Fair's turning out this incredibly high production star studded content.

607
00:36:28.171 --> 00:36:29.790
Nobody's watching and nobody gives a shit.

608
00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:33.210
And that's not why people watch youtube.
There's no relationship there.

609
00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:38.810
The reason why I'm psyched to be considered and identified as a youtube or

610
00:36:39.331 --> 00:36:43.920
versus a filmmakers is youtube.
Unlike film making is not a one way street.

611
00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:47.870
It's this reciprocal symbiotic relationship that,

612
00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:50.380
that your content has with,

613
00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:54.840
with a very specific audience and then that that audience has with your content.

614
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.590
So to succeed within there as is very challenging.

615
00:36:58.591 --> 00:37:01.500
And I think the only way to do it is to find your own path.

616
00:37:01.501 --> 00:37:05.420
The only way to find that path is to act is to start going.

617
00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:09.310
<v 0>And what,
what,
uh,
let me dig into that because I,</v>

618
00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:14.020
I like this thread,
uh,
and I'll just draw a parallel in writing.

619
00:37:14.021 --> 00:37:18.460
So I remember at one point,
uh,
I was talking to Po Bronson,

620
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:23.110
a writer I admire and I asked him what he does when he feels blocked and he

621
00:37:23.111 --> 00:37:26.650
said,
write about what you're right about,
what angers you,

622
00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.140
like write about what makes you upset.

623
00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:31.930
And thought that was very interesting advice.

624
00:37:31.931 --> 00:37:36.430
But that was a very proved to be very helpful and has been helpful for me when I

625
00:37:36.431 --> 00:37:39.190
feel like I'm having trouble getting started.
Um,

626
00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:42.160
do you have any suggestions?

627
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:45.970
I'm happy to act and I think a lot of people listening would be as well,

628
00:37:45.971 --> 00:37:47.560
but how do they,

629
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:53.080
what might be some angles or questions or ways they can get started,

630
00:37:53.081 --> 00:37:56.380
forget about success just to start getting content out there.

631
00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:59.340
<v 3>Um,
sure.
Well,</v>

632
00:37:59.341 --> 00:38:03.450
I think that what you team uniquely possesses and its audience over any other,

633
00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:08.540
any other distribution outlet is that the audience is so fine tuned to bullshit.

634
00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:14.490
They're both fit detectors are so highly refined that even the slightest amount

635
00:38:14.491 --> 00:38:18.240
of bullshit will set off their alarm and then you will be rejected.
The audience,

636
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:20.130
the community will reject you immediately.

637
00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:25.080
So a great place to start is one of honesty,
um,
one of frankness.
Um,

638
00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:29.640
and that sounds,
uh,
like hyperbolic or wish you off you,

639
00:38:29.641 --> 00:38:34.380
but the truth is being yourself on camera as an incredibly difficult thing to

640
00:38:34.381 --> 00:38:35.650
do.
Uh,

641
00:38:35.651 --> 00:38:39.490
it's why the David Letterman's in the Jimmy Fallon's of the world are so

642
00:38:39.491 --> 00:38:42.520
brilliant is because when you're watching Jimmy Kimmel on TV,

643
00:38:42.521 --> 00:38:44.500
you really believe that that's who this guy is.

644
00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:47.800
And when you see someone who's uncomfortable in front of the camera,

645
00:38:47.801 --> 00:38:50.950
which is the vast majority of us,
it reeks of something else,

646
00:38:50.951 --> 00:38:53.740
which maybe it's something that's contrived or something that's forced or

647
00:38:53.741 --> 00:38:54.574
something that's fake.

648
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:59.350
So I always say start from a place of honesty and that's where the quantity

649
00:38:59.351 --> 00:39:01.560
comes into play is because the more you're doing something,

650
00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:04.240
the more comfortable you become with it.
Um,

651
00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:09.160
so I think the combination of those two,
if you throw in a little bit of passion,

652
00:39:09.161 --> 00:39:12.220
what truly motivates you,
what are you truly interested in?

653
00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:16.940
I think you can find it really,
uh,
uh,
an actionable recipe for,

654
00:39:16.941 --> 00:39:20.320
for starting or building a foundation on Youtube.
So

655
00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:23.200
<v 0>it's,
um,
it seems like,</v>

656
00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.660
and correct me if I'm wrong,
but that you putting out one video per day,

657
00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:33.800
that decision is made,
your popularity really explode.
Um,
so I'd be,

658
00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:38.410
I'd be curious to know why you think that has worked or why that has happened.

659
00:39:38.411 --> 00:39:43.411
And then a question from a fan that came up was you said no to logging before

660
00:39:44.261 --> 00:39:46.720
because he felt like it could make things feel contrived.

661
00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.400
How do you feel about this now?

662
00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:54.610
<v 3>Um,
well those are,
those are two questions.
So let me tackle the first one,</v>

663
00:39:54.611 --> 00:39:57.180
which is about popularity and youtube.
You know,

664
00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:02.200
the reason why I started daily blogging was because I have to unpack this a

665
00:40:02.591 --> 00:40:06.370
little bit,
but when I started my technology company,
which is the social product,

666
00:40:06.371 --> 00:40:07.780
which is,
it's a social network,

667
00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:11.470
I always knew that I would need to lean on my own social reach and my own

668
00:40:11.471 --> 00:40:16.000
influence to build a core use of core base of users for my product.

669
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:21.250
Um,
and then as I began and as my tech company in the construction of it,

670
00:40:21.251 --> 00:40:22.990
really began by social reach,

671
00:40:22.991 --> 00:40:27.040
started to atrophy because I wasn't creating content because I had run a
company.

672
00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:31.270
Um,
so I'm really trying to examine how can I address both of these issues,

673
00:40:31.271 --> 00:40:35.940
which is promote my own social influence.
So like we'll help my company.
Um,

674
00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:38.830
I just made a decision and I'm on my birthday this year,

675
00:40:38.831 --> 00:40:42.320
my 34th birthday that I'm going to start daily blogging.

676
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.080
And coincidentally,
I was like on this beautiful,

677
00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:52.440
lovely trip with my family and an exciting location and the Caribbean and um,

678
00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.950
and I had a lot of material those first four days and a lot of beautiful

679
00:40:56.951 --> 00:41:01.930
material to show off a.
And that's what I did.
And when I got home,

680
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:04.350
uh,
the fourth lot of the fifth long ever made,

681
00:41:04.351 --> 00:41:06.580
it's like me returning to work and I say to the camera like,

682
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:11.910
I don't know how sustainable this is because I live a fairly ordinary life where

683
00:41:12.281 --> 00:41:14.440
I show up at work yet at eight or nine in the morning,

684
00:41:14.441 --> 00:41:17.890
I leave work at seven at night,
I go home to my family and I go to bed.

685
00:41:17.891 --> 00:41:22.180
There's not much in there that warrants blogging every single day.

686
00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:26.350
Um,
and the reason why I bring that specific up,
Tim,

687
00:41:26.351 --> 00:41:28.510
is because that dovetails with your next question,

688
00:41:28.511 --> 00:41:32.410
which is I used to reject blogging because it was a little bit of,

689
00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:36.890
is the wagging the tail or is the tail wagging the dog in that I don't want to

690
00:41:36.891 --> 00:41:37.820
be living my life.

691
00:41:37.821 --> 00:41:42.821
So it's interesting for my blog and the reason why those two points dovetails so

692
00:41:44.061 --> 00:41:46.790
nicely.
It's because when I said that on the blog when I said,

693
00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:50.600
I don't know how to make this interesting,
now that I'm back at my daily life,

694
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:56.170
I understood blogging as a visual public diary of one's life and I think that's

695
00:41:59.361 --> 00:42:00.930
where I was wrong.
Um,

696
00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:05.720
and what this thing that I call a blog and I embrace that title and it's a blog.

697
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:09.680
What it's become is instead of a daily show for me,

698
00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.440
and that feels sometimes like,

699
00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.710
like the blog I posted yesterday for example,

700
00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:20.240
is very much so a diary because my wife and I and my daughter going on this

701
00:42:20.241 --> 00:42:24.170
crazy trip out to queens to try to buy some funny clothes for a wedding that

702
00:42:24.171 --> 00:42:26.630
we're going to in a few months.
It was very much so a diary.

703
00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:28.730
But then you look at some of my other blogs,

704
00:42:28.731 --> 00:42:31.580
which are just me sitting in front of a camera talking to,

705
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:35.900
talking to my audience about why I'm so passionate about filmmaking or,
or,

706
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:39.380
or something much more personal.
And it feels instead of a Vlog,

707
00:42:39.381 --> 00:42:41.660
it feels much more like a confessional.

708
00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:46.070
And some of my vlogs are examining technical things like my car,

709
00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:47.180
my electric skateboard.

710
00:42:47.181 --> 00:42:50.060
I've got an entire blogs dedicated to how this thing works.

711
00:42:50.061 --> 00:42:52.670
And some of them were up building things and some of them are about how I

712
00:42:52.671 --> 00:42:54.020
structure my daily life.

713
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:59.470
So really I just post every 24 hours and I call it a blog because that's the

714
00:43:00.051 --> 00:43:02.690
easiest thing for me to call it,
that the people understand.

715
00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:07.460
But the truth is it's not a diary of my life.
Instead it's this,

716
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:10.430
it's this outlet for whatever it is that interests me.

717
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:14.240
So I hope that answers the question from the fan.

718
00:43:14.241 --> 00:43:17.210
It's that I understood when I said that comment about blogging,

719
00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:20.600
I understood blogging to be one thing.
And then in practice,

720
00:43:20.601 --> 00:43:21.950
and this is where this is,

721
00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:25.700
this really reinforces that idea that I said about action is so important in

722
00:43:25.701 --> 00:43:26.211
practice.

723
00:43:26.211 --> 00:43:29.690
It really manifested as something wildly different from what I originally

724
00:43:29.691 --> 00:43:30.650
understood it to be.

725
00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:36.770
<v 0>And in your,
in your daily practice,
your daily routine.
Um,</v>

726
00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:40.530
I've read that you might take,

727
00:43:40.531 --> 00:43:44.030
say up to eight hours to edit one of your videos.
I don't know if that's true.

728
00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:45.270
We can get a comment on that.

729
00:43:45.271 --> 00:43:50.271
But how much time do you spend interacting with fans or viewers on Youtube,

730
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:56.040
Twitter,
all these different social platforms on a,
on a,

731
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:57.570
on an average daily basis?

732
00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:02.760
<v 3>I mean,
in aggregate I would say it's less than,
less than an hour.
Um,</v>

733
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:06.750
I try my best,
but it's very hard.
Usually I check into my,

734
00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:10.930
my daily upload about an hour after it's been posted.
I see who,

735
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:12.580
who's commenting on what they're saying,

736
00:44:12.581 --> 00:44:17.110
and I jump in and try to reply to as many as I possibly can.
Um,
on Twitter,

737
00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:19.620
you know,
you're,
you're pretty great on Twitter,
Tim.

738
00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:21.530
I've been following you forever,
but you know,

739
00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:25.840
you respond when you can have got a minute of downtime.
No one's looking,

740
00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:27.250
you're sitting in a car,

741
00:44:27.251 --> 00:44:30.580
you're waiting for something and you just jump on Twitter and you reply to a few

742
00:44:30.581 --> 00:44:32.130
tweets.
Um,

743
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:37.160
but I would say there's nothing more defined than that for me.

744
00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:39.630
Um,
and I,
I'd love to change that.

745
00:44:39.631 --> 00:44:43.290
I'd love to figure out a way to have it be much more inclusive of my audience.

746
00:44:43.291 --> 00:44:44.910
But regrettably,

747
00:44:44.911 --> 00:44:48.840
time is fungible and to dedicate more time than I do currently to my audience

748
00:44:48.841 --> 00:44:51.800
would need to take it away from somewhere else and I'm just not in a position to

749
00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:55.310
<v 0>do that.
What a,
and I do the same thing by the way.
I mean,</v>

750
00:44:55.311 --> 00:44:56.930
when I post a blog post,

751
00:44:56.931 --> 00:45:01.931
typically I'll post at night so I can catch any errors that fans will point out

752
00:45:03.441 --> 00:45:04.760
immediately.
So I'll try to hit,

753
00:45:04.761 --> 00:45:09.761
say the UK or New Zealand and then answer questions the following morning,

754
00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:14.710
uh,
or along those lines.
And it's something that you just have to batch,
but,
uh,

755
00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:19.190
what was your first paid Gig,
uh,

756
00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.240
related to film?

757
00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:24.520
Or when did you realize that you could actually give this anonymous the

758
00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:25.363
profession?

759
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:30.230
<v 3>Awesome question.
Um,
the first day Gig I ever had was,
uh,</v>

760
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:32.220
to make,
uh,

761
00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:37.310
happy birthday video for this guy named Tom Tom's husband,

762
00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:40.680
um,
was getting,

763
00:45:40.681 --> 00:45:45.540
was he's turning 50 years old in Tom contacted my brother and I,
and he said,
Hey,

764
00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:48.480
I've seen some of your little art movies,
um,

765
00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:53.310
in the art world floating around the art world.
This is like 2001,
2002 rather.

766
00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:57.660
And he was like,
I'd love to hire you to make a movie for my husband,
uh,

767
00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:00.840
and for my husband's birthday.
And we're like,
okay,
great.
And he's like,

768
00:46:00.841 --> 00:46:02.280
just let me know what it costs.

769
00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:05.250
And all I knew at the time was that he was like a rich guy.

770
00:46:05.251 --> 00:46:08.820
So like we debated for days,
like,
what do we charge this guy?

771
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:14.150
And we came back with what we saw was the most like ambitious number we could

772
00:46:15.181 --> 00:46:17.700
possibly go to him with,
which is like,

773
00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:22.650
we asked for $5,000.
And the truth is we were,

774
00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:25.320
were willing and ready to do it for $100.

775
00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:30.550
We knew he was a rich guy and we knew that he liked us and we knew that he'd

776
00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:34.380
bought really fancy art.
So maybe just maybe we get away with it.

777
00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:39.060
He didn't bat an eye at it.
He said,
no problem.
And then he said,

778
00:46:39.061 --> 00:46:43.890
here are a list of people I'd love for you to interview about my husband.

779
00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:48.600
And it was like President Clinton,
Senator Hillary Clinton,

780
00:46:48.601 --> 00:46:50.430
like all the members of their cabinet,

781
00:46:50.431 --> 00:46:54.840
like all of these triple a rockstar politicians.
And we were just like,

782
00:46:54.841 --> 00:46:58.350
holy smokes,
who is this guy?
Um,
and it was,

783
00:46:58.351 --> 00:47:02.610
it was Fred Hochberg who is currently the chairman of the import export bank and

784
00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:07.910
his husband is a guy named Tom [inaudible] and Tom is currently the chairman of

785
00:47:07.951 --> 00:47:12.720
the Fulbright Commission.
Um,
so there are two,
probably the biggest power couple,

786
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:15.420
one of the biggest power couples out there.
Um,

787
00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:17.760
and there are two lovely guys who to this day I'm very,

788
00:47:17.761 --> 00:47:21.840
very close friends with and we got our 5,000 bucks for that Gig.
And it was,

789
00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:23.070
it was a huge deal.

790
00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:24.350
<v 0>That's amazing.</v>

791
00:47:24.351 --> 00:47:28.820
Did they just email you through the contact email and your website or how did

792
00:47:28.821 --> 00:47:29.770
that connection happen?

793
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.970
<v 3>Wow,
there's no website back then.
Back then,</v>

794
00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:38.020
back then I was working for $10 an hour as like an artist's assistant.

795
00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:40.120
And in the interim I was making,

796
00:47:40.121 --> 00:47:43.600
my brother Van and I were making these little movies in my apartment that we

797
00:47:43.601 --> 00:47:47.770
would post on literally like apple I disc and we email around the link so people

798
00:47:47.771 --> 00:47:52.630
could download the.mov files and watch them in somehow.

799
00:47:52.631 --> 00:47:54.850
One of the artists we knew or something like that was like,
oh,

800
00:47:54.851 --> 00:47:59.110
you gotta check out these two young maniacs that I've met who make these crazy

801
00:47:59.111 --> 00:48:00.850
little videos.
And he saw it and he was like,

802
00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:04.180
I don't want a boring video for Freddy's birthday.
I want something that like,

803
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:08.980
it's going to keep people laughing.
And he gave us this crazy,
this,

804
00:48:08.981 --> 00:48:10.000
he gave us this assignment.

805
00:48:10.001 --> 00:48:14.860
We came back with something absolutely crazy that involve like,
um,

806
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:19.660
that involved,
you know,
when we met with Hillary,
or sorry,
Bill Clinton,

807
00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:24.670
they had a prepared statement on his teleprompter and when the secret service

808
00:48:24.671 --> 00:48:26.260
left the room to go get the president,

809
00:48:26.261 --> 00:48:28.810
I deleted all the information off the teleprompter.

810
00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:34.390
And while the president is sitting there and his seat waiting for the

811
00:48:34.391 --> 00:48:38.320
teleprompter,
I just remember him being like,
Nancy,
what's going on here?

812
00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:42.640
I rushed over to him with my hands down so I didn't get tackled by security and

813
00:48:42.641 --> 00:48:44.620
I was like,
hello,
Mr President,
my name's Casey.

814
00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:49.000
I'm here to do this interview for you,
for Fred Hochberg.
Here's an idea I had.

815
00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:51.400
And he started laughing.
He was like,
boys,
I love it.

816
00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:54.970
And we hit record and we had the nugget recorded before they got the

817
00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:56.800
teleprompter.
He was out of the room.

818
00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:01.450
And when he said the joke that we had him say in front of the 500 people at Le

819
00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:04.210
Cirque where we showed the movie for Fred's birthday,
it brought down the house.

820
00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:07.690
That's a ballsy move.
But I mean,
I shouldn't be surprised.

821
00:49:07.691 --> 00:49:11.170
You're pretty ballsy bald guy to start with.
I mean,

822
00:49:11.171 --> 00:49:14.650
back then it was like definitely a nothing to lose kind of situation.

823
00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:18.670
We were absolutely,
nobody's is getting paid $10 an hour for,

824
00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:22.660
I couldn't afford food back then.
That's not,
that's not,
that's not hyperbole.

825
00:49:22.661 --> 00:49:26.980
That is fact.
Now what,
when you,
um,
well let me,

826
00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:30.190
let me take a step back with,
when you think of the word successful,

827
00:49:30.191 --> 00:49:34.960
who's the first person who comes to mind and why?
That's a tough question.

828
00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:37.250
Um,
my grandmother,
uh,

829
00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:42.130
my grandmother is probably the most successful.
She passed away two years,

830
00:49:42.131 --> 00:49:44.380
three years,
four years.
We've got stopped keeping track.

831
00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:49.330
She passed away at age 92 and she is like,
she's my hero.
She's my muse.

832
00:49:49.331 --> 00:49:50.350
She's my everything.

833
00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:54.880
And the reason why is she started tap dancing when she was six years old.

834
00:49:54.881 --> 00:49:57.940
She's a little fat girl and her parents made her do something to lose,

835
00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:58.893
lose the weight.

836
00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:03.850
So she started tap dancing and she loved it and she fell in love with something

837
00:50:03.851 --> 00:50:07.600
at age six and she didn't stop tap in St until the day before.

838
00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.100
She died at age 92.

839
00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:14.380
She died on a Monday morning at age 92 and the first thing we had to do after

840
00:50:14.381 --> 00:50:18.820
she died was call her 100 students to say she wasn't going to make class that

841
00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:23.530
day.
Wow.
Um,
and for me it's just like,
I mean she's never rich.

842
00:50:23.610 --> 00:50:27.160
Uh,
she actually never had a whole lot of money.
She's a tap dance instructor,

843
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:32.060
but she dedicated all the proceeds from her tap recitals to the American cancer

844
00:50:32.061 --> 00:50:36.740
society to raise money to,
to beat cancer because cancer took her father.
Um,

845
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:40.970
so she's,
she's a total hero and a philanthropist despite not having the means.

846
00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:43.930
And then on top of that is just like what,

847
00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:47.660
what is the ultimate quantification of success?
For me,

848
00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.900
it's not how much time you spend doing what you love,

849
00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:54.830
it's how much time you spend or how little time you spend doing what you hate.

850
00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.500
And this woman spent all day,

851
00:50:57.501 --> 00:51:00.660
everyday doing what she loved all day.

852
00:51:00.661 --> 00:51:04.640
If he spent almost no time doing the things she didn't want to do.
Um,

853
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:08.060
she just did,
which was she loved the most in life,
which is dancing.

854
00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:11.090
And she did that with dancing was her life.
You'd wake up in the morning,

855
00:51:11.091 --> 00:51:14.850
she was dancing and go to bed at night.
She's watching Fred Astaire and TV.
Um,

856
00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:19.370
and that was her,
you know,
that was 86 years of her 92 years of existence.

857
00:51:19.371 --> 00:51:22.640
She spent doing nothing but exactly what she loved.

858
00:51:22.641 --> 00:51:25.520
And I just can't think of a higher benchmark of success than that.

859
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:26.920
<v 0>So how,</v>

860
00:51:26.921 --> 00:51:31.921
how has that impacted you on a daily basis?

861
00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:34.540
And I'll just,
I'll rephrase that.

862
00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:40.080
When you wake up in the morning and you don't feel like putting out the video,

863
00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:44.530
right,
do you have those days?
And if so,
what do you do in those circumstances?

864
00:51:44.531 --> 00:51:45.580
What do you say to yourself?

865
00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:50.740
<v 3>Well,
I always want to put out the video.
I don't always want to make the video,</v>

866
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:57.380
so like give a little structure to that.
My Day looks like is,

867
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:59.023
um,

868
00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:03.500
I wake up at four 30 in the morning is when my alarm goes off.

869
00:52:03.501 --> 00:52:05.750
This is seven days a week and I edit,

870
00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:09.020
I finished my edit from the night before the edit gets done and usually between

871
00:52:09.021 --> 00:52:13.820
six 30 and seven from seven to seven 45,
it's processing,
uploading,

872
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:17.480
um,
designing in,
in color,
correcting everything,

873
00:52:17.481 --> 00:52:21.110
the thumbnail that goes on youtube,
preparing the posts.
So it's up,
it's live,

874
00:52:21.111 --> 00:52:21.710
it's rendered,

875
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:26.570
it's fully processed and it goes live at exactly 8:00 AM that's seven days a

876
00:52:26.571 --> 00:52:31.400
week.
Immediately after 8:00 AM I,
I work out,
which usually involves running,

877
00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:32.481
um,
you know,

878
00:52:32.481 --> 00:52:36.770
whenever I run eight to 12 miles or going to the gym and then I'm in my office

879
00:52:36.771 --> 00:52:41.210
like nine 30 ish.
Um,
I live across the street from my,

880
00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:43.400
from my office,
so it's a pretty narrow commute.

881
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:45.590
And then I work in my office all day long.

882
00:52:45.591 --> 00:52:49.400
Are you usually try to get out of here by six 30 race home,
give the baby a bath,

883
00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:51.950
um,
and then hanging out in their wife for an hour and a half.

884
00:52:51.951 --> 00:52:55.880
She goes to bed at like nine and then I sit down to edit until I pass out in my

885
00:52:55.881 --> 00:53:00.530
computer till one in the morning.
I sleep usually on the couch until four 30,

886
00:53:00.531 --> 00:53:04.520
which is like,
you know,
three,
four hours later I wake up and I start over.

887
00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:08.030
And that is seven days a week for me.
Um,

888
00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:11.480
sometimes on the weekend I spend less time in the office,
but that's every day.

889
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:14.900
That's a brutal tough.
It's tough.

890
00:53:14.901 --> 00:53:18.950
So have you always needed very little sleep?
Yeah,
I've always,

891
00:53:18.951 --> 00:53:22.950
I've never ever been a fan of sleep.
I hate sleep.
Sleeping,

892
00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:26.870
eating are like my two least favorite things to do and I'm frustrated everyday

893
00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:28.920
when I get tired and I'm frustrated when I get hungry.

894
00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:33.790
<v 0>I can help you with the ladder.
Maybe not the tire,
but the uh,</v>

895
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:35.890
been doing all sorts of fascinating experiments.

896
00:53:35.891 --> 00:53:38.680
What time do you eat breakfast and what do you eat for breakfast?

897
00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:43.650
<v 3>I mean,
I usually don't,
uh,
I only,
like I said,</v>

898
00:53:43.651 --> 00:53:45.970
honey nut cheerios is when you asked me earlier during our audio,

899
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:49.740
during the sound check,
right?
Because,
whichever,
I have no idea who,
but some,

900
00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:52.710
one of our team members have a tech company is a big fan of them.

901
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.910
So there's always hunting that chairs in milk in my,
in my,
my office.

902
00:53:57.210 --> 00:54:00.300
So when I hear somebody else spooned clanking the porcelain,
I'm like,
Ooh,

903
00:54:00.301 --> 00:54:04.290
cheerio's and I get up,
but just cause that's sugar and that's delicious.
Um,

904
00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:09.090
but no,
I don't,
I don't know that I am a big breakfast eater.

905
00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:12.510
I usually just wait until I get really hungry and then I eat until the hunger

906
00:54:12.511 --> 00:54:15.330
stops.
And,
and then I repeat that

907
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:20.430
<v 0>seems seems like the most natural way to go as opposed to eating by the clock.</v>

908
00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:22.670
You know,
I just have to mention honey nut cheerios.

909
00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:27.860
I had breakfast with Larry King for the first time,
uh,

910
00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:28.820
not long ago.

911
00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:33.800
And we met at a sort of a Jewish bagel shop and he goes there every morning and

912
00:54:33.801 --> 00:54:38.300
then eats honey nut cheerios so they have to keep it stocked at this place for

913
00:54:38.301 --> 00:54:41.330
him.
I just thought that was one of the most unusual things I'd ever seen.

914
00:54:41.331 --> 00:54:46.130
But it seems like a number of top performers eat honey nut cheerios for

915
00:54:46.131 --> 00:54:50.600
breakfast.
So maybe there's something there.
Uh,
when that,
speaking of Larry King,

916
00:54:50.601 --> 00:54:55.601
I've always kind of idolized him for his ability to get people to open up.

917
00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:59.570
Uh,
do you,
you've met so many people,

918
00:54:59.571 --> 00:55:03.810
so many successful people over the years in different professions,
uh,

919
00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:05.660
who has made you feel starstruck

920
00:55:06.070 --> 00:55:10.780
<v 3>and y
Ou starstruck?</v>

921
00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:16.570
God,
that is a tricky one.
Uh,
it's funny cause you know,

922
00:55:16.571 --> 00:55:21.571
I'd go to like a lot of big celebrity of events and it never really hits me with

923
00:55:21.941 --> 00:55:26.740
the kinds of people that you would think that it would hit me with.

924
00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:29.050
Um,
I'm trying to think.

925
00:55:29.051 --> 00:55:32.620
Like I met Jack Welsh once in the street,
right.

926
00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:37.840
And for whatever reason I was starstruck by him.
I was so excited to meet him.

927
00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:43.730
Um,
but honestly,
I don't know.
I,
I really just starstruck is something that,

928
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:46.720
that that's an experience.
I don't know.
Super well.

929
00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:51.850
And I guess the reason why it's just like I have about as much appreciation and

930
00:55:51.851 --> 00:55:54.820
understanding of that as I do when people get excited to meet me.

931
00:55:54.821 --> 00:55:57.010
And I say that right now,
looking out the,

932
00:55:57.190 --> 00:56:01.870
I have a monitor in my office that camera films just outside the sidewalk and I

933
00:56:01.871 --> 00:56:06.580
can count one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven,
eight,
nine,
10,
11,
12,

934
00:56:06.610 --> 00:56:11.140
13,
14 kids standing outside of my office right now,
rating,
waiting to see me.

935
00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:14.110
That's every day.
Uh,

936
00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:18.730
it's never stopped and I haven't got as much understanding or ability to

937
00:56:18.731 --> 00:56:21.640
understand,
empathize with those kids.
I said,
my office is,

938
00:56:21.641 --> 00:56:25.650
I do get the idea of getting starstruck.
Um,

939
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:28.060
so why Jack?
Why Jack Welch?

940
00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:33.100
I had no idea and they say just finished one of his books,
but,
um,

941
00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:36.400
and I had all these ideas in my head that he had planted there and that's

942
00:56:36.401 --> 00:56:39.250
something flattering.
But no,
I,
I don't,

943
00:56:39.251 --> 00:56:43.030
I definitely see people as people at face value.

944
00:56:43.031 --> 00:56:46.510
And I think that,
you know,

945
00:56:46.511 --> 00:56:50.500
what you contribute and what you do is incredibly meaningful and important.
But,

946
00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:51.940
uh,
at the end of the day,

947
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:56.950
we are all people and I think that it's tough for me to try to elevate someone

948
00:56:57.221 --> 00:56:58.390
else.
And in the same regard,

949
00:56:58.391 --> 00:57:03.391
when I see videos that autoplay on Facebook of Syrian refugees getting beaten on

950
00:57:04.361 --> 00:57:08.590
the Macedonian border by officers with clubs,
um,

951
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:10.750
I would say that I have what,
whatever,

952
00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:14.920
whatever that feeling of empathy would be for a movie star.

953
00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:18.000
I shared that with them where I look at these people and I'm like,
no,

954
00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:21.160
I see Kanye West.
And I'm like,
okay,
he's a person just like me.

955
00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:24.070
And I see someone holding a baby getting beaten with a club.
Well,

956
00:57:24.071 --> 00:57:26.530
it's pouring rain out and I say,
that person's just like me.

957
00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:31.220
And it's very hard for me to,
to think of a human being as someone,

958
00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:34.750
as someone other than,
than an equal.
Right.

959
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:40.330
And I realize I kind of walked over my own question or probably walked over your

960
00:57:40.331 --> 00:57:44.770
answer to the,
when you feel demotivated or that you don't want to make a video,

961
00:57:44.771 --> 00:57:46.960
what do you do?
It?
Is it that the,

962
00:57:46.961 --> 00:57:50.500
is it that you're regimented seven day week schedule just doesn't allow the

963
00:57:50.501 --> 00:57:54.580
space for that self doubt or,
oh,
no.
You know,
I didn't answer the question either.

964
00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:59.170
I Digress and dumping.
But uh,
no.
So it's very real.

965
00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:01.210
And Waking Up to edit.
I never want to do it.

966
00:58:01.211 --> 00:58:03.250
And like yesterday I just said it was Sunday morning,
I was like,

967
00:58:03.251 --> 00:58:05.010
I'm not going to do it.
And I didn't,

968
00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:07.430
I didn't get my post up until one in the afternoon.
Um,

969
00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:12.130
and there's a total mutiny on,
on,
on uh,
Twitter by my,

970
00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:15.760
my viewers.
But uh,
I don't want to do it,

971
00:58:15.761 --> 00:58:19.780
but the truth is like I can only equate it to climbing a mountain.

972
00:58:19.810 --> 00:58:23.200
I've climbed some really big mountains before and when you're,

973
00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:26.920
the closest to the peak is when you want to give up the most.

974
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:31.480
But the return that is standing at the summit is such a victory that the minute

975
00:58:31.481 --> 00:58:31.931
you're up there,

976
00:58:31.931 --> 00:58:34.390
you just want to do it again and you've forgotten about the pain.

977
00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:40.050
So the hate that is the battle of the edit and the upload and the bullshit and

978
00:58:41.561 --> 00:58:44.770
the getting it done and the technical problems that are outside of your control

979
00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:46.750
and the camera not recording audio.

980
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:51.190
And like every other hurdle that comes between you and uploading,

981
00:58:51.550 --> 00:58:52.930
all of that is absorbed.

982
00:58:52.931 --> 00:58:57.610
All that is erase the moment you click upload and it's replaced with this like

983
00:58:58.090 --> 00:59:03.090
sensation of adrenaline and wonderment and achievement and accomplishment that

984
00:59:03.881 --> 00:59:07.160
is having made something that I now get to share.
Um,

985
00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:10.510
and that was true when I was making a birthday video that help a hundred people

986
00:59:10.511 --> 00:59:14.410
in a room got to see that was true when I was making videos of my son when he

987
00:59:14.411 --> 00:59:16.330
was a baby and I'd share them with my family.

988
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:19.930
And that's certainly true at my daily uploads on youtube that go out to,

989
00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:22.680
you know,
a million people day.
And

990
00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:27.260
<v 0>you,
you,
you seem to be very contrarian.</v>

991
00:59:27.261 --> 00:59:30.920
I don't know if you've always been that way.
Uh,
but you're also very well spoken.

992
00:59:30.921 --> 00:59:33.770
So you dropped out of high school.
How do you explain that?

993
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:37.130
How did you sort of develop that ability?

994
00:59:38.650 --> 00:59:41.500
Um,
and it's not to say that somebody drops out of high school,

995
00:59:41.501 --> 00:59:45.130
it can't be well spoken,
but it's,
it's,
it's,
uh,

996
00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:48.910
I,
I'm very impressed with how well spoken you are.

997
00:59:48.911 --> 00:59:51.970
So I'd just be curious to know why you think or how you develop that.

998
00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:53.760
<v 3>No,
I dunno,</v>

999
00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:56.720
maybe reading a lot or I was trying to surround myself with people that are

1000
00:59:56.721 --> 01:00:01.250
smarter than than I am.
Um,
I mean,
I can remember when I,

1001
01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:04.250
when I got my first real job,
when I,

1002
01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:08.360
at the time girlfriend was pregnant with my first kid and I was 16 years old and

1003
01:00:08.361 --> 01:00:12.530
I was in the back of a kitten and everybody just sort of thought that I was an

1004
01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:16.370
idiot probably because of my age and the fact that I was kind of a dope and I

1005
01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:19.760
probably talk like an idiot then as a 10th grade high school dropout who's only

1006
01:00:19.761 --> 01:00:22.640
previous work he experienced as selling dime bags in the parking lot of high

1007
01:00:22.641 --> 01:00:26.840
school.
Um,
the lack of respect and what that felt like.

1008
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:31.670
And then I really remember,
you know,
again,
16 years old in the kitchen of a,

1009
01:00:31.671 --> 01:00:34.520
of a really dumpy seafood restaurant getting paid $8 an hour.

1010
01:00:34.790 --> 01:00:38.990
I really remember what would happen when I acted differently around these,

1011
01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:40.130
these guys that I worked in,

1012
01:00:40.131 --> 01:00:44.160
the hits it with how they would treat me differently and every day became this

1013
01:00:44.161 --> 01:00:47.420
sort of social study for me,
this social experiment we're in,

1014
01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:50.690
how would they respond to me acting a certain way?

1015
01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:55.520
And I remember like when they would pick on me instead of me trying to come up

1016
01:00:55.521 --> 01:00:57.320
with quippy come back to them,

1017
01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.020
I would just look them in the eye and not say anything.

1018
01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:03.520
And then the picking on me stopped immediately.
Um,

1019
01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:08.750
and I guess like that little experiment right there was something that had a

1020
01:01:08.751 --> 01:01:13.190
huge impact on me because you know,
the more considered I am,

1021
01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:16.220
when I say things more,
I think before I speak and things like that,

1022
01:01:16.221 --> 01:01:20.090
I think the more people respond in the way that I would hope people respond.

1023
01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:24.770
And the more I feel like I'm doing a good job of communicating whatever it is

1024
01:01:24.771 --> 01:01:27.240
that I'm trying to,
to say whatever information that isn't,

1025
01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:31.130
I'm trying to disseminate.
Um,
the more satisfying it is for me.

1026
01:01:31.131 --> 01:01:33.980
It feels great to be understood.
Um,
so I just,

1027
01:01:33.981 --> 01:01:37.580
I do whatever I can that best services that,
um,

1028
01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:41.750
as far as the educational part or being out,
uh,
an autodidact.
Yeah.
I,

1029
01:01:42.290 --> 01:01:46.970
the big fan of reading and a big fan of,
of World War Two and we say like,

1030
01:01:46.971 --> 01:01:47.870
I got all my business,

1031
01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:51.380
my understanding of business and how business and life works from studying the

1032
01:01:51.381 --> 01:01:52.214
Second World War.

1033
01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:57.530
<v 0>Any particular books or documentaries or resources on World War II that you,</v>

1034
01:01:57.590 --> 01:01:58.460
that you're a big fan of?

1035
01:01:58.810 --> 01:02:01.030
<v 3>Oh yeah.
And I probably,
my favorite,</v>

1036
01:02:01.031 --> 01:02:03.300
or at least my second favorite book in the world,

1037
01:02:03.550 --> 01:02:08.370
it's a textbook and it's called the Second World War by John Keegan.
Um,

1038
01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:13.630
and it's literally just like 1200 pages at size six fought about the second

1039
01:02:13.631 --> 01:02:16.720
world war.
And I remember like getting in trouble,

1040
01:02:16.721 --> 01:02:21.360
filling up to work tired because I'd be up all night long reading this textbook

1041
01:02:21.361 --> 01:02:24.160
about World War II.
So riveting to me.
Um,

1042
01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:28.590
I read it cover to cover probably three times and I remember reading in The New

1043
01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:32.670
York Times that John Keegan passed away and he goes,
you know,
late 2000,

1044
01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:37.410
maybe 2008,
2009 from the Gut and being deeply sad that this military lecturer,

1045
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:42.120
this professor from England had died because I felt so close to him because I

1046
01:02:42.121 --> 01:02:42.954
read this book.

1047
01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:47.970
There was nothing more than an academic's perspective on the Second World War.

1048
01:02:47.971 --> 01:02:50.730
It was not a firsthand experience.
There's no emotion in this book.

1049
01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:52.680
It's pure military strategy.

1050
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:56.190
And I remember deeply being emotionally affected by the fact that this guy had

1051
01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:59.790
had died,
but that's one book in particular that,
that really affected me.

1052
01:02:59.791 --> 01:03:03.450
How were you introduced to that book or how did you find it?

1053
01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:07.200
I have no idea.
Uh,
I mean,
I can tell you actually,

1054
01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:11.370
I was at a dinner party with a girl.

1055
01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:16.371
I had a crush on whose mother was a columnist in the New York Times and uh,

1056
01:03:16.770 --> 01:03:19.950
they were talking about World War II and one of them said,

1057
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:24.030
what year did World War II started or something like that.

1058
01:03:24.031 --> 01:03:27.120
And I remember thinking in my head,
what year did World War II start?

1059
01:03:27.121 --> 01:03:30.390
And I literally couldn't tell you,
forget about the decade,

1060
01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:33.090
I couldn't tell you what part of the century it took place in.

1061
01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.450
And I remember in that moment feeling like an idiot.

1062
01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:38.130
The same way I felt like an idiot in the kitchen when I got picked on.

1063
01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:42.930
And the next day I just went to Barnes and noble cause there no Amazon then and

1064
01:03:42.931 --> 01:03:46.860
like found whatever looked like the most down the line,

1065
01:03:46.861 --> 01:03:48.960
like straight forward book on the Second World War.

1066
01:03:48.961 --> 01:03:52.080
So I could make sure that the next time I was in a conversation when World War

1067
01:03:52.081 --> 01:03:56.200
Two came up,
I'd be much more versed in it.
Amazing.
And you,

1068
01:03:56.201 --> 01:03:58.680
you said second favorite book.
What is,

1069
01:03:58.681 --> 01:04:01.680
what is the other book that was in your mind?
Um,

1070
01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.170
the autobiography of Malcolm X.
Um,

1071
01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:08.160
I have read that book more times than I can count.
Uh,

1072
01:04:08.161 --> 01:04:10.800
I cried at the end of that book.
I don't know why.

1073
01:04:10.801 --> 01:04:14.580
I guess I was surprised that Malcolm x was killed even though he'd been dead for

1074
01:04:14.581 --> 01:04:17.250
40 years,
and I knew that he had been shot.
Um,

1075
01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:21.870
that book resonates me in such a way.

1076
01:04:22.410 --> 01:04:26.010
He just like,
he was a bad kid.
He was a troublemaker.
He's arrested,

1077
01:04:26.011 --> 01:04:28.500
he's thrown in jail as a dropout in a thug.

1078
01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:33.960
And I say this like with some hesitation because that means an absolute hero

1079
01:04:33.961 --> 01:04:38.910
who,
who really changed the world for the better and for so many people.
Um,

1080
01:04:38.970 --> 01:04:41.190
so I don't compare myself to him in any capacity,

1081
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:43.470
but certainly when I read that book for the first time,

1082
01:04:43.471 --> 01:04:47.970
I saw so many parallels between his struggles,
uh,
again,

1083
01:04:47.971 --> 01:04:50.280
in a universal way,
in the struggles that I had.

1084
01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.700
And he know he was a troublemaker.
He wasn't selling dime bags.

1085
01:04:53.701 --> 01:04:58.430
He was doing real crime with guns and robbing people.
Um,
and he went to jail.
Uh,

1086
01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.050
and you know,
he taught himself,

1087
01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:05.190
educated himself while in prison to the degree that he developed an astigmatism

1088
01:05:05.191 --> 01:05:10.191
and his eye from reading in like the super dim prison light and he went into

1089
01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:15.060
prison,
the,
you know,
the degenerate thug that he was,

1090
01:05:15.061 --> 01:05:16.320
and he came out of prison.

1091
01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:19.750
I think one of the greatest communicators of the 20th century.

1092
01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:21.580
I'm in someone who's,

1093
01:05:21.581 --> 01:05:26.080
whose ideas and the profundity behind the way he was able to share those ideas,

1094
01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.830
affected the world and affected the civil rights movement in such a way that we

1095
01:05:29.831 --> 01:05:32.500
still feel the impact of it today.
Um,

1096
01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:37.420
he's just such a hero in that book is written so in such a brilliant way that's

1097
01:05:37.421 --> 01:05:41.800
so relatable even today that I,
I can't think of another piece of,
of,

1098
01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:46.850
uh,
of writing that's impacted me the way that movie that book has.
When was,

1099
01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:49.120
he sucked,
not the movie,
the book.

1100
01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:53.490
What book have you gifted most to other people?

1101
01:05:53.491 --> 01:05:57.380
Is it one of these two or is or doesn't know the book that gifted the most to

1102
01:05:57.390 --> 01:05:59.790
people that there's a real trouble with gifting books,

1103
01:05:59.791 --> 01:06:03.000
which is that if you're gifting someone a book,

1104
01:06:03.001 --> 01:06:06.300
it means you think that they're going to actually read it.
Um,

1105
01:06:06.450 --> 01:06:08.070
and I would say more often than not,

1106
01:06:08.071 --> 01:06:13.071
most books that are gifted say more are more gesture by the person who gifted

1107
01:06:13.291 --> 01:06:15.510
them to you,
then they are you receiving them.

1108
01:06:15.511 --> 01:06:18.600
Like most people who gift the kind of books that I received,

1109
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:22.210
they just want to feel special and be able to say,
I gave you that book.
Um,

1110
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:25.530
that's a little cynicism for you.
But no,

1111
01:06:25.531 --> 01:06:29.790
the book I've gifted the most is a book called,
it's not how good you are.

1112
01:06:29.791 --> 01:06:32.880
It's how good you want to be.
I think that's the name of the Doc.

1113
01:06:32.881 --> 01:06:37.080
I'm going to look it up right now.
But what it is,
it's written by an ad man,

1114
01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:41.480
and it's about sort of the art of advertising.
That's great title.
I mean,
uh,

1115
01:06:41.610 --> 01:06:43.680
even if that's not the right title,
I liked the sound of it.

1116
01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:48.120
The reason why I get that book is because you can read it in like 40 minutes

1117
01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:49.440
each page.

1118
01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:53.030
It's like 20 words on it and each one of them captures like these really big

1119
01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.890
lofty ideas.
Here it is.

1120
01:06:55.891 --> 01:06:58.410
It's not how good it's how good you want to be by Paul Arden.

1121
01:06:58.970 --> 01:07:03.840
And each book has like huge hundred and 50 font text where it says one sentence,

1122
01:07:03.841 --> 01:07:08.340
but each one like really punches you in the stomach and a really big way.
Um,

1123
01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:12.970
and I think this book has the ability,
and it was written by an Admin,

1124
01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:15.310
but I think it's really,
it's just about creativity in general.

1125
01:07:15.311 --> 01:07:19.650
It had a breakthrough,
um,
in a way that really affects you.

1126
01:07:19.890 --> 01:07:24.540
I think that there is a passage in there where he talks about how when hiring

1127
01:07:24.570 --> 01:07:25.680
and when being,

1128
01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:30.900
when hiring always see someone who's been fired or who has quit their previous

1129
01:07:30.901 --> 01:07:35.550
job as a virtue.
And like,
it's a bunch of little items like that.

1130
01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:36.660
And I don't know,

1131
01:07:36.661 --> 01:07:39.690
I just think it's a magnificent book that you can sit down and we'll shake

1132
01:07:39.691 --> 01:07:41.880
anybody up who reads it?
I'll check it out.

1133
01:07:41.881 --> 01:07:45.120
I'm in the shakeup phase at the moment.
Uh,
he,

1134
01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:48.420
I'm going to ask just a couple of rapid fire questions.

1135
01:07:48.421 --> 01:07:51.870
They don't need to be rapid fire answers,
but I'll throw just a,
uh,

1136
01:07:52.290 --> 01:07:54.030
a bunch of questions at you.
Uh,

1137
01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:59.120
what $100 or less purchase has most positively impacted your life in the last

1138
01:07:59.190 --> 01:08:02.960
six to 12 months or whatever comes to mind?
Oh,

1139
01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:07.400
$100 or less purchase.
That's a really,

1140
01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:11.270
really challenging answer.
Our question to answer.

1141
01:08:11.890 --> 01:08:12.723
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1142
01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:19.300
<v 4>Not extremely expensive.
No,
I understand.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

1143
01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:21.680
so it's not that recent,

1144
01:08:21.681 --> 01:08:24.560
but it is something that I say to young people want to get into film making.

1145
01:08:24.561 --> 01:08:28.940
But the movie that I shot,
the film,
the camera that I shot,

1146
01:08:28.941 --> 01:08:32.790
the bike lanes movie on costs $150,
uh,

1147
01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:35.040
and you started this interview out by,
uh,

1148
01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:39.380
by asking about that movie and I think that speaks to just how impactful that

1149
01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:40.250
movie was.

1150
01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.330
And that movie was shot and $150 camera from Walmart and that movie was edited

1151
01:08:44.331 --> 01:08:46.340
in Imovie,
which is free software.

1152
01:08:46.730 --> 01:08:50.750
So I think that when I look back at like where it's really big impacts been when

1153
01:08:50.751 --> 01:08:55.751
it comes to making a little investment that that movie and that that $150

1154
01:08:55.881 --> 01:09:00.050
investment and the impact that it had on my life and my career is something that

1155
01:09:00.051 --> 01:09:03.260
I often point to as like,
don't blame it on the gear.

1156
01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:06.560
Don't believe it on a lack of resources because it's never the resources that

1157
01:09:06.561 --> 01:09:09.710
determine your success.
It's,
it's how you use what you have.

1158
01:09:10.190 --> 01:09:15.190
And is there any entry level camera that you might suggest to people now who are

1159
01:09:15.681 --> 01:09:19.520
looking for an equivalent and just getting started?
Or is the phone good enough?

1160
01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:23.930
I mean,
I think the phones now are great.
They're way better than good enough.

1161
01:09:23.931 --> 01:09:27.440
But if you look at a lot of the big bloggers like logging was,
was,
uh,

1162
01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:32.100
was invented by people just using the webcams on their computers.
Um,

1163
01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:34.280
so I really just don't think the quality matters.

1164
01:09:34.281 --> 01:09:35.960
I think cell phones now are incredible.

1165
01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:37.880
If you want to get something bigger than that,

1166
01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:42.230
you go to the store and you buy whatever the whatever the cheapest canon point

1167
01:09:42.231 --> 01:09:45.440
and shoot cameras at all as a high def video record button.

1168
01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:47.870
They get stereo sound,
they've got zoom.

1169
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:51.890
It's more than what you need to tell a great story.
It's never the hardware,

1170
01:09:51.891 --> 01:09:55.610
it's only how you use it.
And speaking of loggers,

1171
01:09:55.611 --> 01:10:00.260
so I'm not familiar with the world of loggers outside of your own who are a few

1172
01:10:00.261 --> 01:10:00.891
bloggers,

1173
01:10:00.891 --> 01:10:04.640
maybe they have different styles that people could check out just to get a feel

1174
01:10:04.641 --> 01:10:08.800
for how people are going about doing this.
Uh,
sure.
I mean,

1175
01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:12.020
so there's one guy who's a good friend of mine,
his name is Ben Brown,

1176
01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:17.450
spelled as you'd imagine.
And Ben is,
uh,
Ben's a guy who,

1177
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:21.320
he's a really honest,
Frank Guy and I think what Ben does in blogging,

1178
01:10:21.321 --> 01:10:23.060
he's a daily Vlogger.
That's,

1179
01:10:23.061 --> 01:10:27.770
so his vlogs are very much so by definition,
just the diarrhea his life.

1180
01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:28.790
Um,

1181
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:33.790
but I think what Ben does better than anyone is he really is himself on camera.

1182
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:35.300
So what you're seeing on cameras,

1183
01:10:35.301 --> 01:10:40.010
who he is in real life and what the impact of that is in aggregate is that after

1184
01:10:40.011 --> 01:10:42.440
you spend day in and day out watching his 10 minute blogs,

1185
01:10:42.441 --> 01:10:44.690
if your day is he becomes a friend,

1186
01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:48.530
he becomes a friend by proxy and he lives in somewhat adventurous life.

1187
01:10:48.531 --> 01:10:50.150
He's got a beautiful girlfriend in Cape Town,

1188
01:10:50.151 --> 01:10:52.250
South Africa where he spends the majority of his time,

1189
01:10:52.251 --> 01:10:56.210
even though he's from England and he travels a lot for work.
His work is logging.

1190
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:57.740
Um,
so you sort of,

1191
01:10:58.010 --> 01:11:02.150
you span this guy's life along with him and the idea that you,
you,

1192
01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:05.270
you feel like you become friends with him.
Um,

1193
01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:07.190
so I think he really captures what is the,

1194
01:11:07.230 --> 01:11:10.910
the romanticism behind blogging behind sharing your life in a,

1195
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:13.680
in a daily capacity.
A video.

1196
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.690
<v 0>Got It.
Any,
uh,</v>

1197
01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:18.990
anyone else come to mind just so people can look at a few different options?

1198
01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:22.350
<v 4>Sure.
There's a guy named fun for Louie,
um,
fun,</v>

1199
01:11:22.351 --> 01:11:24.570
fun for fund four,

1200
01:11:24.571 --> 01:11:28.130
l o U I s Louie Louie is,

1201
01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:31.190
is very similar to Ben and Louis is like a godfather of logging.

1202
01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:34.800
And doing it for like four years.
He's someone who is like six foot,

1203
01:11:34.801 --> 01:11:39.801
four long dreadlocks and just rejected the grind and he wanted to live a life of

1204
01:11:40.051 --> 01:11:43.410
adventure.
And he literally is traveling 365 days a year.

1205
01:11:43.740 --> 01:11:47.090
And he bankrolls it all by sharing those experiences that he,

1206
01:11:47.091 --> 01:11:51.930
he does via his camera and be a youtube.
He doesn't drink,
he doesn't do drugs,

1207
01:11:51.931 --> 01:11:56.730
he doesn't have a girlfriend.
He's just an honest guy on sort of a,
a journey to,

1208
01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:59.050
to define himself.
Um,

1209
01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:04.160
and I find his blogs to be very humble and honest and um,

1210
01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:07.980
they capture who he is and he shares that in a way that I think he's extremely

1211
01:12:07.981 --> 01:12:08.814
relatable.

1212
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:10.050
<v 0>What,</v>

1213
01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:14.250
what are the most common misconceptions about you or your work would you say?

1214
01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.320
<v 4>God,
that's tough and it's tough.</v>

1215
01:12:19.321 --> 01:12:24.321
Only because I paid such little attention to the negative people and the people

1216
01:12:25.741 --> 01:12:29.580
that are,
are wasting their time criticizing.
Um,
what,

1217
01:12:29.970 --> 01:12:32.180
what did they call that about Steve Jobs is

1218
01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:37.550
the reality.
Um,

1219
01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.060
so what are the biggest misconceptions?
Um,
you know,

1220
01:12:42.061 --> 01:12:45.210
people think I'm really rich and I think that's a kind of a frustrating

1221
01:12:45.211 --> 01:12:46.044
misconception.

1222
01:12:46.290 --> 01:12:49.020
And the reason why it's frustrating isn't because I don't have a wonderful,

1223
01:12:49.050 --> 01:12:51.820
absolutely privileged life,
which I do.
Um,

1224
01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:57.590
it's frustrating because of how many times in life I've said no huge paychecks

1225
01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:02.960
because they didn't align with who I am as a person.
Um,
you know,

1226
01:13:02.970 --> 01:13:07.200
I said no to a hundred thousand dollar job today on Youtube because of what they

1227
01:13:07.201 --> 01:13:09.780
wanted me to do and what they wanted me to say.
I just passed on it.

1228
01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.900
And that's been the case from when I was really,
really broke.
Uh,

1229
01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:17.160
if it wasn't something that I thought I could get behind that I believed in,

1230
01:13:17.190 --> 01:13:21.720
I just said no.
Um,
and I think that if,
if money were my focus,

1231
01:13:21.721 --> 01:13:25.860
I would have found a home in advertising done very well there and never looked

1232
01:13:25.861 --> 01:13:29.890
back.
But instead of I've always stayed true to what really matters to me.
Um,

1233
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:33.420
this sharing ideas and sharing perspectives and I've done that with tremendous

1234
01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:36.750
financial risk,
um,
that that has cost me,

1235
01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:40.170
probably prevented me from being this rich guy that,
that people think that I am.

1236
01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:45.090
<v 0>How,
how do you decide what to say no to?
So for instance,
if,</v>

1237
01:13:45.091 --> 01:13:49.270
if you're comfortable talking about it and I ask because I'm constantly trying

1238
01:13:49.271 --> 01:13:53.050
to get better at saying no.
And you mentioned Steve Jobs and he was a,

1239
01:13:53.051 --> 01:13:56.530
he's famously quoted for a lot of things,
but one of them was,
you know,

1240
01:13:56.531 --> 01:13:59.740
innovation is saying no to a thousand things,
uh,

1241
01:13:59.741 --> 01:14:03.310
or being successful saying no to a thousand things and sort of always striving

1242
01:14:03.311 --> 01:14:07.330
for that simplicity.
What did the company,

1243
01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:10.590
what made you uncomfortable that led to the know?
Um,

1244
01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:12.850
or you could speak more generally if you want to,

1245
01:14:12.851 --> 01:14:16.060
but I'm trying to get better at this myself and I'm always looking for playbooks

1246
01:14:16.061 --> 01:14:17.560
or rules that other people use.

1247
01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.580
<v 4>Uh,
or I was terrified,</v>

1248
01:14:20.610 --> 01:14:23.640
absolutely terrified to say no for so long.

1249
01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:27.210
And it's because it was such a novel idea,
this,

1250
01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:30.440
this idea that someone was willing to pay me to pick up a camera,

1251
01:14:30.460 --> 01:14:32.310
something that I had not just done for free,

1252
01:14:32.311 --> 01:14:34.800
but something that I had like spent every,

1253
01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:39.300
every last cent of my life to be able to do and now people are willing to pay me

1254
01:14:39.570 --> 01:14:42.960
and then willing to pay me a shit load of money.
And then I had to say no.

1255
01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:47.190
So it's something that was really scary for me to do.
Um,

1256
01:14:47.370 --> 01:14:51.120
but I would say that transition happened a couple of years ago.
Uh,

1257
01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:55.700
and the more I said no,
the more it made me feel better.
And,
uh,
I,

1258
01:14:55.701 --> 01:15:00.330
I don't know what the science to it is,
but I can tell you that when I launched,

1259
01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:01.171
I launched,

1260
01:15:01.171 --> 01:15:04.470
but when I got the first little bit of financing for my technology company and

1261
01:15:04.471 --> 01:15:07.940
went from being an idea to something more tangible,
um,

1262
01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:09.780
I just immediately said no to everything.

1263
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:14.850
And that's pretty much where I lie right now is everything is given one filter

1264
01:15:14.851 --> 01:15:16.650
and that one filter is,

1265
01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:22.350
is this good for me and my tech company?
And if the answer is no,

1266
01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:27.030
it's a,
it's a pass at at the answer is that yes it gets in an examination.

1267
01:15:27.410 --> 01:15:28.243
<v 0>And uh,</v>

1268
01:15:28.670 --> 01:15:32.220
and I definitely want to talk about beam for people who also want to sort of

1269
01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:33.770
develop this ability to say no.

1270
01:15:33.771 --> 01:15:38.030
There's a commencement speech by Neil Gaiman called make good art,

1271
01:15:38.031 --> 01:15:40.070
which I just find fantastic,

1272
01:15:40.071 --> 01:15:43.160
but he has some really good metaphors for this as well.
Um,

1273
01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:46.370
and I'm going to come back to beam in just a second,
but what,
uh,

1274
01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:49.190
what do you believe that other people think is insane

1275
01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:54.020
or what is a belief that you have that other people think many people think is

1276
01:15:54.021 --> 01:15:54.854
crazy?

1277
01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:56.423
<v 5>Uh,</v>

1278
01:15:58.710 --> 01:16:02.340
<v 4>it's funny cause to the listeners out there,
I'm talking to you right now,</v>

1279
01:16:02.341 --> 01:16:04.710
not Tim,
but Tim sent me all these questions saying,

1280
01:16:04.711 --> 01:16:06.930
if you want to rehearse for this so you have the answers.

1281
01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:08.940
And I came back with an emphatic,

1282
01:16:09.090 --> 01:16:12.210
I don't like to know the questions ahead of time because then they're rehearsed.

1283
01:16:12.450 --> 01:16:17.380
And now I'm finding myself with these really challenging lessons,
grasping,

1284
01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:22.170
grasping to come up with an answer.
That's true.
Um,
okay.

1285
01:16:22.171 --> 01:16:24.670
What do I believe that that's crazy.
Um,

1286
01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.990
<v 0>or that other people think is crazy,
but you might not.
And this is it.</v>

1287
01:16:27.991 --> 01:16:31.470
This is a common interview question and this is a paraphrase that Peter Teal

1288
01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:36.720
cofounder or former CEO of paypal and a first money into Facebook that he uses a

1289
01:16:37.681 --> 01:16:40.700
lot.
Um,
this is,
um,

1290
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:44.010
something you believe that's controversial or that other people think.

1291
01:16:45.330 --> 01:16:48.580
<v 4>I think they talk about this in the first chapter of zero to one.</v>

1292
01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:53.940
I'm sure it comes up.
I'm sure it comes up.
Uh,
I,
you know,

1293
01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:58.690
I believe in the religion of work and working hard.
And I think that,

1294
01:16:59.470 --> 01:17:00.100
uh,

1295
01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:03.820
I think that that's something that people resist and people resist the notion of

1296
01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:07.780
in the more I find myself sort of preaching the values and the virtues of that,

1297
01:17:07.781 --> 01:17:09.650
the more resistant are,

1298
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:14.900
<v 3>um,
but I just believe that anything can be achieved through hard work.</v>

1299
01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:17.360
Uh,
and it's hard.
It's hard to say.
As I,

1300
01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:21.230
as I'm hearing myself say that it sounds like something that,
you know,
some,

1301
01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:23.900
some dipshit guy who's found successful say,

1302
01:17:23.901 --> 01:17:27.140
but I really like the truth is,

1303
01:17:27.141 --> 01:17:31.100
the harder I work is the harder I work,

1304
01:17:31.101 --> 01:17:35.070
the more successful I am.
And,
and moreover,
you realize that like,

1305
01:17:36.050 --> 01:17:39.170
you will never,
you'll never be the best looking person in the room.

1306
01:17:39.171 --> 01:17:41.300
You'll never be the smartest person in the room.

1307
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:45.500
You'll never be the most educated,
the best well verse you'll,
you'll never be,

1308
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:49.040
you can never compete on those levels.
You'll never be the most edgy.

1309
01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:51.260
You'll never be able to compete on those levels.

1310
01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:52.940
But what you can always compete on.

1311
01:17:52.941 --> 01:17:57.050
The true like egalitarian aspect of success is hard work.

1312
01:17:57.350 --> 01:18:01.100
You can always work harder than the next guy and if you're willing to work

1313
01:18:01.101 --> 01:18:05.030
harder than the next guy,
you will succeed because most people,

1314
01:18:05.031 --> 01:18:08.630
like I always say when when someone's like,
yeah,
but I'm not going to dedicate,

1315
01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:11.450
I'm not going to commit to working like that.
I'm not waking up.
I'm not,

1316
01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:13.730
how did he sleep?
A couple of,
I'm not going to do,
I'm not.

1317
01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:16.820
The second I hear someone say that,
I think to myself,
great,

1318
01:18:17.210 --> 01:18:22.210
that is one less person I have to climb over on my way to the top because I know

1319
01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:27.800
what hard work can yield and I know just how,
just how meaningful,

1320
01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:28.970
hard working day.

1321
01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:35.100
<v 0>There's a one of my,
I,
it's,
I don't know why I'm so embarrassed to admit this,</v>

1322
01:18:35.101 --> 01:18:39.000
but one of my favorite semi sort of a documentary,

1323
01:18:39.001 --> 01:18:44.001
but it's more of a historical reenactment film that I've seen is called miracle

1324
01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:50.930
and it's a Disney movie with Kurt Russell about this just incredible story of

1325
01:18:51.241 --> 01:18:54.420
the US hockey team and the Olympics at Lake placid.
Going against the,

1326
01:18:54.810 --> 01:18:58.410
the Soviets are considered unbeatable.
But in one of the training sessions,

1327
01:18:58.411 --> 01:19:03.210
he says,
you know,
they're just bickering amongst themselves and,
and uh,

1328
01:19:03.570 --> 01:19:06.630
and looking at hot chicks in the stands instead of taking the game seriously.

1329
01:19:06.631 --> 01:19:10.530
And he's like,
oh,
well,
I know you guys think you have a lot of talent,
but talent,

1330
01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:13.290
you don't have enough talent to make it in this particular game,

1331
01:19:13.291 --> 01:19:16.380
but I can promise you that we'll outwork every other team that,
that,

1332
01:19:16.381 --> 01:19:21.000
that's going to play us in the Olympics.
Um,
so yeah,
I,
I do think there's a lot,

1333
01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:25.740
a lot to pull from that.
The
tech companies.

1334
01:19:25.741 --> 01:19:30.540
So tell me a little,
tell me and the listeners about beam,

1335
01:19:30.570 --> 01:19:33.660
but related to that,
I mean,
you have a,
you have an amazing life.
You've,

1336
01:19:33.690 --> 01:19:37.830
you've created an amazing life for yourself through experimentation and hard

1337
01:19:37.831 --> 01:19:42.510
work.
Um,
have been a popular director.
You have Sundance,
Hbo,

1338
01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:47.100
et Cetera.
You can make a lot of money.
Some youtubers,
I'm not going to say you,

1339
01:19:47.101 --> 01:19:49.320
but you tubers can make a,
you know,
five,

1340
01:19:49.321 --> 01:19:51.960
six figures for product placement on Youtube.

1341
01:19:51.961 --> 01:19:55.500
So why on earth start a tech company and a,
and then what,

1342
01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:56.640
what is the tech company?

1343
01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:01.020
<v 3>Uh,
you know,
it's,
it's,
it was at the height.</v>

1344
01:20:01.021 --> 01:20:06.021
It was at the peak of my career that I actually pivoted to starting this tech

1345
01:20:06.541 --> 01:20:08.200
company.
The peak of that career

1346
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:12.660
<v 4>is one of doing branded content deals on my youtube channel.
And Yeah,</v>

1347
01:20:12.661 --> 01:20:17.430
those deals were six figures in seven figure deals.
Huge,
huge,

1348
01:20:17.431 --> 01:20:19.950
huge deals.
And in starting my company,

1349
01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:24.690
my technology coming actually shut down my production company that was doing

1350
01:20:24.691 --> 01:20:25.650
those tremendous deals.

1351
01:20:25.651 --> 01:20:30.651
So a part of that rejection around me being rich is because of that is because

1352
01:20:31.111 --> 01:20:35.700
I,
I shut down,
I killed the,
uh,
I killed the golden goose.

1353
01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:36.773
Yeah.
I killed,

1354
01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:40.650
I killed the cow that I had been milking for years to do this because that's how

1355
01:20:40.651 --> 01:20:42.870
much I believe in this.
Um,

1356
01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:46.140
but what started the tech company was this,
I was,

1357
01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:50.790
I was doing advertising work for youtube from a youtube channel and it was

1358
01:20:50.791 --> 01:20:54.590
fantastically successful as a tremendously proud of it,
all of that.
Um,

1359
01:20:54.690 --> 01:20:57.060
but I really felt like I had exhausted it.
Um,

1360
01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:59.540
I had reached a plateau where people,
uh,

1361
01:20:59.541 --> 01:21:02.580
I was doing similar work and even though it was good and people love that,

1362
01:21:02.581 --> 01:21:05.790
I didn't feel like it was moving me forward in any way.

1363
01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:10.860
And it was around that time that I was invited to,
uh,
to MIT,

1364
01:21:11.610 --> 01:21:16.050
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and I was invited there via the Sundance

1365
01:21:16.050 --> 01:21:20.910
Institute and a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation and they invited me to

1366
01:21:20.911 --> 01:21:24.210
live on campus and work out of the media lab for six months.

1367
01:21:24.810 --> 01:21:27.630
And I remember thinking about that.
My initial gut response was like,

1368
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:31.590
leave my company for six months.
How much is that going to possibly cost me?

1369
01:21:31.650 --> 01:21:34.320
Like I can't afford to do?
That's crazy.
Say No to all this money.

1370
01:21:34.321 --> 01:21:36.990
I've never said no to anything in my life.
Um,

1371
01:21:37.050 --> 01:21:39.030
and the more I thought about the more I was like,
you know what?

1372
01:21:39.031 --> 01:21:41.670
I can probably afford to do this.

1373
01:21:41.671 --> 01:21:46.260
I can probably afford to live off my savings for six months.

1374
01:21:46.261 --> 01:21:47.550
I'll be dead broke at the end of it.

1375
01:21:47.551 --> 01:21:51.090
But this is an opportunity unlike anything else.
And I just in the end said,

1376
01:21:51.091 --> 01:21:51.780
fuck it.

1377
01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:56.690
And I went for it and I lived on campus and I never went to college number,

1378
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:58.350
went to high school,
never went to college.

1379
01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:02.010
And I just went there with a wide open mind and I had wanted Janda.

1380
01:22:02.011 --> 01:22:04.560
And that agenda was when I leave here,

1381
01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:07.620
I want to make sure I have an understanding.

1382
01:22:07.621 --> 01:22:11.820
I'm doing something that I've,
I've,
I've never done before.

1383
01:22:11.821 --> 01:22:16.380
I'm doing something that is not currently on the books because I don't get it.

1384
01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:20.970
And while at Mit I learned one thing,
one very meaningful,

1385
01:22:20.971 --> 01:22:25.530
one very powerful thing.
That one thing was that with technology,

1386
01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:29.610
almost anything is achievable.
Um,
and therefore I,

1387
01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:32.510
I took that understanding when I came back to New York after my,

1388
01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:36.060
my tenure there was over to my semester,
there was over,

1389
01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:37.650
my fellowship was complete.

1390
01:22:37.651 --> 01:22:41.160
I came back to New York and I came back to New York and I wanted to solve a

1391
01:22:41.161 --> 01:22:44.640
problem.
Um,
I wanted to solve a problem that I identified years ago,

1392
01:22:44.641 --> 01:22:46.020
but I didn't think was solvable.

1393
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:49.530
And I wanted to take this new understanding that I could solve big problems with

1394
01:22:49.531 --> 01:22:51.570
technology.
And I wanted to realize that.

1395
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:56.560
And that was the prelude to me starting a technology company.
And,

1396
01:22:56.561 --> 01:22:59.580
and can you explain the premise of a,

1397
01:22:59.581 --> 01:23:03.930
of beam tell people where they can check it out.
But,
uh,
also the,
uh,

1398
01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:06.280
how it works.
I mean the basic,
the basic

1399
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:07.263
<v 0>conceit,
bind it.</v>

1400
01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:09.900
<v 4>Yeah,
sure.
So that problem,</v>

1401
01:23:10.710 --> 01:23:15.120
that problem that I really wanted to solve was one that my life has been so

1402
01:23:15.121 --> 01:23:19.620
impacted in such a meaningful way by my ability to share my ideas and my

1403
01:23:19.621 --> 01:23:22.740
perspective.
Um,
but I have a unique,

1404
01:23:23.090 --> 01:23:26.430
unfair competitive advantage when it comes to sharing ideas and perspectives,

1405
01:23:26.431 --> 01:23:28.830
which is that I know how to make movies.

1406
01:23:28.831 --> 01:23:33.390
I have this creative expression so I can fear my perspective because of that.

1407
01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:38.490
Um,
Larry King,
I had a CNN talk show,
he shares perspective because of that.

1408
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:41.490
And is there a way to,

1409
01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:45.090
with technology make it so you can actually share perspectives and share ideas

1410
01:23:45.091 --> 01:23:46.710
without having to create something?

1411
01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:51.540
Can you bifurcate this idea of creation from this idea of sharing?
Um,

1412
01:23:51.630 --> 01:23:53.550
and that was a problem that I wanted to solve.

1413
01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:57.370
And that to unpack that a little bit,
even something like a,

1414
01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:02.280
a a youtube at first requires you to make a video and then you have to upload a

1415
01:24:02.281 --> 01:24:04.410
video.
There's an act of creation in there.

1416
01:24:04.411 --> 01:24:06.360
When you think of something like Instagram,
like delivery,

1417
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:09.290
you have to come up with that clever tweet.
Um,
snapchat,

1418
01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:11.700
you have to shoot something,
you review it,
you edit it,

1419
01:24:11.701 --> 01:24:13.950
you see what it looks like,
you add some filters to it,

1420
01:24:13.951 --> 01:24:17.130
you draw on the screen and then you get to share what would it look like if you

1421
01:24:17.131 --> 01:24:20.580
were to remove the entire process?
All of the mechanics of creation.

1422
01:24:21.210 --> 01:24:25.050
And that's what beam is.
That's how beam work.
So literally how being works.

1423
01:24:25.051 --> 01:24:26.970
And it's B e m e beam.

1424
01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:31.500
How it works is you covered the proximity sensor on your,
on your cell phone.

1425
01:24:31.770 --> 01:24:34.020
In the proximity sensors is tiny black dot.

1426
01:24:34.021 --> 01:24:37.470
That's right above the speaker hole at the top of your phone.
Um,

1427
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:42.270
and when you covered that sensor automatically starts recording a video clip and

1428
01:24:42.271 --> 01:24:44.610
the minute that clip is done,
which is four seconds later,

1429
01:24:44.611 --> 01:24:47.550
it's immediately posted to your feet.
Um,

1430
01:24:47.610 --> 01:24:50.730
so what that looks like in practice is when you see something of interest,

1431
01:24:50.731 --> 01:24:53.700
when there's something you want to share,
an idea perspective,
I don't know,

1432
01:24:53.701 --> 01:24:55.950
it's not a cute puppy.
Anything you want to share,

1433
01:24:56.190 --> 01:24:59.220
you just hold your phone to your chest or you put your son over the proximity

1434
01:24:59.221 --> 01:25:03.420
sensor,
the screen goes black,
it captures,
it vibrates when it's done,

1435
01:25:03.421 --> 01:25:05.880
and then you put the phone back in your pocket and you just shared something

1436
01:25:06.210 --> 01:25:09.240
using the most media rich content that's ever existed,
which is,

1437
01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:13.920
which is video would sound and you've done it without ever having to create that

1438
01:25:13.921 --> 01:25:17.130
ever having to take in front that burden.
That is a creative expression.

1439
01:25:17.970 --> 01:25:18.803
Very cool.

1440
01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.200
<v 0>Yeah.
I've uh,
I've been watching it with,</v>

1441
01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:23.630
with great interest and playing around with it,

1442
01:25:23.631 --> 01:25:24.770
so I encourage people to check it out.

1443
01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:26.930
I know we're coming up on time for both of us.

1444
01:25:26.931 --> 01:25:31.140
So I want to just ask a couple more questions and then,
uh,
uh,

1445
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:35.210
absolutely gonna ask you to share where people can come check out a number of

1446
01:25:35.211 --> 01:25:39.360
things related to your work.
What are,
uh,

1447
01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:41.390
some underrated,

1448
01:25:41.690 --> 01:25:45.710
the most underrated documentaries or movies in your mind?
Just a fee.

1449
01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:50.600
They could just be a few films that people might check out that perhaps they

1450
01:25:50.601 --> 01:25:53.420
haven't come across because they haven't been fully appreciated.

1451
01:25:54.230 --> 01:25:56.580
<v 4>Um,
okay.</v>

1452
01:25:56.581 --> 01:26:00.840
So my favorite movie is probably the life and death of Colonel Blimp,

1453
01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:04.520
which is a movie.
It's a British movie was made,
uh,

1454
01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:10.220
there was made during World War Two and it's my favorite movie period.

1455
01:26:10.221 --> 01:26:13.190
It's a movie that Wes Anderson really studied and you can see a lot of his style

1456
01:26:13.191 --> 01:26:16.580
in that movie.
Um,
for example,
like the opening title sequence,

1457
01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:21.170
all of the credits are employed into gigantic blanket and the shots are just

1458
01:26:21.171 --> 01:26:25.460
have that blank.
And this a movie that was made in 1940,
I think 1941.

1459
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:29.880
Um,
and that movie to me is like,
that's my favorite movie.

1460
01:26:29.881 --> 01:26:34.290
See captures everything I love about filmmaking.
Um,

1461
01:26:34.530 --> 01:26:39.380
but it also had to be made at a time when the country is priority,

1462
01:26:39.381 --> 01:26:44.381
was saving themselves from destruction and death and instead,

1463
01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:48.830
you know,
like that's the priority.
And instead,
like at that same time,

1464
01:26:48.831 --> 01:26:53.831
they decided to make a movie and like that is such a novel,

1465
01:26:54.201 --> 01:26:56.300
such a wild idea.
Um,

1466
01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:59.750
and they had no resources and when they needed big wide establishing shots,

1467
01:26:59.751 --> 01:27:03.320
I just filmed a painting because they couldn't fly a balloon or a airplane to

1468
01:27:03.321 --> 01:27:06.320
take the shot because it was,
it was during the war.
Um,

1469
01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:08.540
so that's my favorite movie.
Other movies,

1470
01:27:08.541 --> 01:27:12.740
like my favorite doc is probably if they were documentary is probably little

1471
01:27:12.741 --> 01:27:17.450
dieter needs to fly,
which is a movie from,
from Verner Herzog from 1997.

1472
01:27:17.710 --> 01:27:21.830
How do you spell d?
I.
E.
D.
R,
I guess D.
I t.

1473
01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:26.900
E r and little little dieter needs to fly is about,
uh,
uh,

1474
01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:31.160
it's about,
uh,
Vietnam,
uh,
u s Vietnam fighter pilot.

1475
01:27:31.161 --> 01:27:35.840
He gets shot down his very first mission and he's trapped as a pow for a number

1476
01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:38.390
of years.
And the movie was actually made as a fictional narrative.
Uh,

1477
01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:43.340
or nonsexual narrative are called rescue dawn with Christian Bale a couple of

1478
01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:46.850
years ago.
But skip the Christian Bale and just watched the documentary.

1479
01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:51.170
That movie will bring you to your knees and it shows you like that's one of

1480
01:27:51.171 --> 01:27:54.260
those movies at anytime you're having a bad day or you think you've got it hard,

1481
01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:59.060
you watch that movie and you understand what it means to like to survive.

1482
01:27:59.510 --> 01:28:01.320
Um,
you know,
it's a story of a Guy Oh eight,

1483
01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:06.380
eight maggots for four years and finally escaped and that best friend killed and

1484
01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:07.011
you know,

1485
01:28:07.011 --> 01:28:09.520
much of the interviews that were done were with him when he was living in,

1486
01:28:09.521 --> 01:28:11.300
I think in Portland,
Oregon or something like that.

1487
01:28:11.301 --> 01:28:14.390
And then theater takes you into his basement and underground.

1488
01:28:14.391 --> 01:28:19.391
He has like hundreds of pounds of sugar and flour and oats in the u s in the 90s

1489
01:28:20.361 --> 01:28:24.710
because he's so scared of being hungry again that he wanted to make sure no

1490
01:28:24.711 --> 01:28:27.920
matter what,
he'll never be hungry again for the rest of his life.

1491
01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:32.000
And it's just like,
it captures humanity in such a visceral,
such a real way.

1492
01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:36.890
And it's a work of nonfiction.
So it's really,
that's a movie that,
that that's,

1493
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:41.150
that's,
that's moved me.
Sounds like a great perspective adjuster.

1494
01:28:41.570 --> 01:28:46.160
Uh,
if you could have one billboard anywhere,

1495
01:28:46.970 --> 01:28:49.610
what would you put on it and where would you put it?

1496
01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:56.690
Uh,
can,
I don't,
I don't know.
I mean,
I'd probably,
I'd want to,

1497
01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:01.150
I'd love to have a billboard,
someone that just reminds people to be nice.
Um,

1498
01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:02.320
uh,

1499
01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:05.430
<v 3>where I've put it is wherever the most people would possibly see it.</v>

1500
01:29:05.431 --> 01:29:10.140
But I think that we in,
I don't know that communication,

1501
01:29:10.230 --> 01:29:13.360
uh,
essay do I think the communication,
social networks,

1502
01:29:13.361 --> 01:29:16.380
he internet has made this better.
It's,
it's going in the right direction.

1503
01:29:16.650 --> 01:29:19.740
And I think people are so quick to be judgmental and be negative.

1504
01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:24.590
And the truth is like,
you give other people the benefit of the doubt and you,

1505
01:29:24.591 --> 01:29:29.040
you have a positive approach to everything in life that you end up being happier

1506
01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:31.110
and it's better for them.
It's like that,

1507
01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:36.030
that absolutely quantifiable mathematical equation,
which is that it,

1508
01:29:36.210 --> 01:29:41.210
what's best for you and me is better for me than just what's better for me.

1509
01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:44.180
Does that make sense?
I'll say it again.
Sorry.

1510
01:29:44.190 --> 01:29:47.460
That benefits Tim and KC is better than for Casey than just something that

1511
01:29:47.461 --> 01:29:52.110
benefits Casey and I think positivity and being nice as a big part of that.

1512
01:29:52.530 --> 01:29:54.420
It's something that's often overlooked.

1513
01:29:55.580 --> 01:30:00.170
<v 0>Agreed.
What,
uh,
what advice would you give your 20 year old self?</v>

1514
01:30:01.610 --> 01:30:06.480
20 year old?
Yeah.
Or,
or 25,
whichever you okay.

1515
01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:11.170
<v 4>I mean I would say about 15 year olds down south,
but um,
yeah,</v>

1516
01:30:11.171 --> 01:30:15.790
you can answer that one.
Uh,
it would be don't listen to anyone.
Um,

1517
01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:18.130
don't listen to anyone.
I,

1518
01:30:18.850 --> 01:30:22.360
I have a rule which is always listened to everyone and then reject everything

1519
01:30:22.361 --> 01:30:24.010
you don't like.
Um,

1520
01:30:24.370 --> 01:30:28.570
but the truth is like so many people love Cheley knowledge and it has such an

1521
01:30:28.571 --> 01:30:30.610
impact on people and affects them in such a way.

1522
01:30:30.611 --> 01:30:32.110
And the truth is no one knows anything.

1523
01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:37.690
And life is this malleable mushy piece of clay that's only up to you to shape.

1524
01:30:38.050 --> 01:30:41.110
And when you look too much to other people to help you shape that piece of clay,

1525
01:30:41.111 --> 01:30:44.930
that is your life.
You end up with a,
with a compromised life.

1526
01:30:44.931 --> 01:30:46.390
Stocks is something that's not your own.

1527
01:30:47.170 --> 01:30:52.170
<v 0>How do you end up feeling overwhelmed by the paradox of choice in a situation</v>

1528
01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:58.220
like that?
Um,
if you adopt that philosophy,
and I'm not,

1529
01:30:58.370 --> 01:31:00.650
I mean I tend to agree a lot of the time,

1530
01:31:00.651 --> 01:31:05.480
but I also at points feel like I have too much optionality.
Um,

1531
01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:09.190
and it makes it very difficult to navigate and there's a lot of self doubt and

1532
01:31:09.191 --> 01:31:13.490
maybe that's just my own neuroses that need a addressing.
But

1533
01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:16.430
how do you,

1534
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:21.140
how do you find direction in all of those options and all that freedom?

1535
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:25.450
<v 4>No,
that's a really,
that's a,
that's $1 billion question.</v>

1536
01:31:25.451 --> 01:31:27.930
And I think if you could answer that,
I don't have an answer for that.

1537
01:31:27.931 --> 01:31:32.700
I can tell you that.
Um,
I can tell you that my wife is someone who,

1538
01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:34.920
I actually agree with me if you're going to say this,

1539
01:31:34.921 --> 01:31:37.410
but she's just someone who's crippled by indecision.

1540
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:42.510
She's told me twice in front of her and her lack of ability just to zero and

1541
01:31:42.511 --> 01:31:46.230
one,
it's,
it's,
it affects her in a tremendously negative way.

1542
01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:51.270
And I tend to be very George Bush,
the second George Bush about this.
Um,

1543
01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:53.810
I'm not a tremendous fan of George Bush at all.
Right.

1544
01:31:53.880 --> 01:31:56.340
But that man made mostly bad decisions,

1545
01:31:56.341 --> 01:32:00.040
but he made decisions and um,
I really

1546
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:01.840
<v 3>believe I need to come up with a better person.</v>

1547
01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:08.550
But I really believe like you make a decision and you move on that decision and

1548
01:32:08.801 --> 01:32:12.250
it's better to later in life figured out that that was the wrong decision than

1549
01:32:12.251 --> 01:32:15.550
it is to sit around and have never had made a decision in the first place.

1550
01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:18.610
And that's a really scary thing to do.
But the truth is like,

1551
01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:23.440
I'm only 35 years old,
but I'm also 35 years old and I would,
whatever it is,

1552
01:32:23.441 --> 01:32:25.420
20 years in it as an adult now,

1553
01:32:25.421 --> 01:32:28.330
which is just about enough time to look back and start to examine,

1554
01:32:28.810 --> 01:32:29.950
examine things.
And I,

1555
01:32:30.010 --> 01:32:35.010
I think that having always opted to trust my instinct because my instincts were

1556
01:32:35.531 --> 01:32:36.400
there to keep me alive,

1557
01:32:36.401 --> 01:32:40.900
to trust me and sinks in to move on them has only benefited me despite myriad

1558
01:32:40.901 --> 01:32:42.010
failures along the way.

1559
01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:47.590
<v 0>Yeah,
I can,
I can see how the World War II reading probably influenced,</v>

1560
01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:51.540
uh,
without what I agree with is the ability to make decisions with incomplete

1561
01:32:51.541 --> 01:32:56.340
information.
Uh,
very good.
A very good advice.

1562
01:32:56.430 --> 01:32:58.380
Last question before we wrap up.

1563
01:32:58.770 --> 01:33:02.730
Do you have any ask or request for my audience,

1564
01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:05.580
anything that you would ask them to do or suggest that they do?

1565
01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:09.410
<v 3>Uh,
no.
I mean it's,
it's,</v>

1566
01:33:09.490 --> 01:33:12.970
it's wonderful having an audience to speak to.
Um,

1567
01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:16.270
and something that I always tried to tell anyone that will listen even though I

1568
01:33:16.271 --> 01:33:18.580
had just started her dating myself by saying never listened to anyone.

1569
01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:22.780
But it's just that idea of being nice.
Um,
when you share positivity out there,

1570
01:33:22.781 --> 01:33:26.500
like he comes back and such a big way and that's sets a lame like TV evangelists

1571
01:33:26.501 --> 01:33:31.120
thing to say.
But the truth is like that is so meaningful.
It is so cheap.

1572
01:33:31.150 --> 01:33:35.620
It is so inexpensive.
It is so easy to be cynical,
to be negative,

1573
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.720
to be someone who brings other people down and brings yourself down is really

1574
01:33:40.721 --> 01:33:44.950
easy to do.
Being Nice,
being positive is really hard work,

1575
01:33:45.310 --> 01:33:49.000
but you feel so much better.
At the end of the day.
It's just like exercise.

1576
01:33:49.001 --> 01:33:51.220
You don't want to get out there and do your run.
You don't want to go to the gym.

1577
01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:53.150
But when you do it,
you feel so much better.
Switch.

1578
01:33:53.190 --> 01:33:56.980
Glad you switched better off that you did it.
And at the end of the day,

1579
01:33:56.981 --> 01:34:00.220
at the end of life,
at the end of the year,
the aggregate of having done that,

1580
01:34:00.250 --> 01:34:03.970
having put in the work to be a more positive person,
um,

1581
01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:07.570
that's really tremendous.
And I know there are two kids now,

1582
01:34:07.571 --> 01:34:11.590
so I say all this in their shadows and um,
the older I get,

1583
01:34:11.591 --> 01:34:15.820
the more I really believe in that and I work hard to achieve that every minute

1584
01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:16.653
of every day.

1585
01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:21.980
<v 0>What do you,
people have asked me this,
so I'm going to ask you what,
what do you,</v>

1586
01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:25.460
what have you been listening to most when you run recently?

1587
01:34:28.350 --> 01:34:32.610
<v 3>The problem with me as a mom,
I'm not much of a loyalist and it comes to music.</v>

1588
01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:35.880
I hate that answer.
I love everything.
But I love everything.

1589
01:34:36.210 --> 01:34:40.800
I'm an old friend of mine.
His name's Johnny.
Uh,
Johnny famous as his name on,

1590
01:34:40.890 --> 01:34:45.210
on Spotify.
And that's no age.
J.
O.

1591
01:34:45.210 --> 01:34:48.630
N n y famous Johnny famous.
I just listened to his playlist.

1592
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:52.860
He was like this incredible deejay who's deejayed parties with me.

1593
01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:54.840
All kinds of fun stuff.

1594
01:34:55.080 --> 01:34:58.520
But I just go to him and I'll let Johnny what you listening to and Spotify

1595
01:34:58.521 --> 01:35:00.400
enables that and I just listened to his playlist.

1596
01:35:00.410 --> 01:35:03.210
So it's not a super sexy answer,
but it's true.

1597
01:35:03.460 --> 01:35:07.850
<v 0>No,
it's specific.
It's perfect.
All right.
I,
this has been so much fun.
Uh,</v>

1598
01:35:07.870 --> 01:35:12.440
I know we've,
we've tried to connect over the past weeks and months and it's,

1599
01:35:12.441 --> 01:35:15.250
it's,
it's finally here in front of us.

1600
01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:18.310
Where can people find you on the Internet?

1601
01:35:18.370 --> 01:35:22.060
Where can they check out you and your work and maybe maybe give them a video or

1602
01:35:22.061 --> 01:35:25.150
two to start with a also.

1603
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:30.200
<v 3>Yeah,
I mean,
everything I've ever done is on youtube.</v>

1604
01:35:30.690 --> 01:35:33.530
If you just type my name into Google,
you'll find it.
Uh,

1605
01:35:33.690 --> 01:35:36.830
if I had to say start somewhere,
watch that movie,
make it count.

1606
01:35:36.831 --> 01:35:39.450
Cause we just spend some time talking about it.
Um,

1607
01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:41.830
and then another movie that I like to point to is I'm moving,

1608
01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:45.780
I work really hard on that is kind of under,
under watched on Youtube,
but it's,

1609
01:35:45.781 --> 01:35:48.350
it's called draw my life and basically it's,

1610
01:35:48.351 --> 01:35:53.351
it is like my autobiography that I made via little drawings that a friend of

1611
01:35:53.661 --> 01:35:56.870
mine did.
And it's something I worked super hard on it.

1612
01:35:56.871 --> 01:36:01.871
It's like a 12 minute summation of everything I've done from birth until age 30

1613
01:36:02.541 --> 01:36:06.830
or so.
And it's something I'm really,
really proud of.
That little movie.
Uh,

1614
01:36:06.831 --> 01:36:11.510
and then your audience to download beam be Emmy.
It's on the APP store now.

1615
01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:15.590
We'll have it on android probably November or working really hard to get it

1616
01:36:15.591 --> 01:36:18.290
there.
But beam is a really,
really exciting,

1617
01:36:18.291 --> 01:36:23.130
really it's a burgeoning community that's growing every day.
And um,

1618
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:25.920
I don't know the more people that are a part of being more exciting.

1619
01:36:26.170 --> 01:36:28.810
<v 0>I'm so awesome.
Well,

1632
01:37:17.961 --> 01:37:22.520
a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

1633
01:37:22.521 --> 01:37:23.840
pondering over the week.

1634
01:37:24.050 --> 01:37:26.810
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1635
01:37:26.811 --> 01:37:30.260
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1636
01:37:30.261 --> 01:37:34.610
somehow dug up in the,
uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1637
01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:39.880
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

1638
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:43.250
close friends,
for instance.
And it's very short.

1639
01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:48.320
