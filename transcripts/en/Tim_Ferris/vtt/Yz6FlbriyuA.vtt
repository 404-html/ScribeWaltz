Do you need social media for Your Business?
How much of a focus should it be?

2
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.280
That is contingent upon many,
many questions only of which I'll cover right now.

3
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.600
Social media can be very helpful and there are many successful businesses,

4
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.250
many successful personalities for instance built on Youtube,
Instagram and so on.

5
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.140
I like to control as many variables as possible and I spend a lot of time

6
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.960
looking at the potential worst case scenarios.

7
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.470
What if fill in the worst case scenario I hedge meaning I do whatever I can

8
00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:43.610
possible to limit the downside and then I proceed.
I like asymmetrical risks,

9
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.570
I he very minimal downside or some way that I can cut bait if things don't work

10
00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:51.350
out and very,
very high upside.
For that reason.

11
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.680
I have spent time on social media,

12
00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:57.500
but there are many businesses and you can look through the annals of history for

13
00:00:57.501 --> 00:00:58.334
hundreds of years,

14
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.440
including right now in this precise moment that have been built without any

15
00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:08.441
emphasis whatsoever on social media and my belief is that the focus should be

16
00:01:09.951 --> 00:01:11.420
first and foremost,

17
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.410
if your product is not content which changes the game of bent,

18
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.870
if your product is not content and it's something else,

19
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.560
your focus should be on making your product or service so good that no one can

20
00:01:23.631 --> 00:01:27.620
ignore it.
At least those people in your ideal demographic,

21
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.480
your target 1000 true fans,

22
00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:32.750
they cannot ignore it and they will want to tell all their friends about it.

23
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.820
In that case,
you do not think at all or don't have to.

24
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.000
How about your personal or business social media accounts that you can let your

25
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:45.020
own diehard fans do all of the recruiting and sharing for you?

26
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.700
That is my preference.
I think more often than not,

27
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.410
people engage in social media and obsess over social media for several reasons.

28
00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:55.244
Number One,

29
00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.460
many people are doing exactly that and there's a certain degree of Fomo,

30
00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:02.460
fear of missing out,
uh,

31
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.340
and to guilt or obligation are not in my experience,
very,

32
00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:10.490
very good drivers for good business decisions.

33
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.030
Second is that you are on platforms run by multibillion dollar companies with

34
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.100
near infinite resources and research and development designed to make it as

35
00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:27.101
sticky as possible for your monkey brand to get lost in the noise and links and

36
00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:32.510
photographs on these various platforms.
You are completely outgunned.

37
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.190
Uh,

38
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.190
so it is very easy and I think the default that people use social media citing

39
00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:41.180
business reasons,

40
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.510
but in fact they are really simply obsessed with the buisiness of using social

41
00:02:47.391 --> 00:02:50.510
media and which should not be confused with productivity,

42
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.080
which entails longterm planning,
measurable objectives,

43
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.880
set milestones,

44
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.240
how will you know when you are successful type of markers along the way and so

45
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:05.980
on.
So my default is to ask the question,

46
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.370
how could you let or encourage all of your fans customers to do all of the

47
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:12.701
marketing for you?

48
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:17.701
If you could only focus on the product or service and had to deliver an 11 star,

49
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.270
say out of four or five star Max experience,
what would it look like?
Uh,

50
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.950
I would encourage people as a thought exercise to do at least then,

51
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.970
because social media can be gasoline on the fire,

52
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.400
but not every fire is beneficial.

53
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.580
So have a longterm strategy and play the long game.
