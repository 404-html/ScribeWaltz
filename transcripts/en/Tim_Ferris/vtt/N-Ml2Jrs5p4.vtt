00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.910
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:07.040
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking it.
Nobody else.

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:07.960
You posted a question.

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.440
I'm a cybernetic organism living.

5
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.610
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by fresh books,
man.
Oh Man.</v>

6
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:31.110
Do a lot of listeners of this podcast and readers of mine love fresh books to

7
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:34.740
the extent that I ended up meeting with the CEO not very long ago.

8
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.870
Why are they so popular?
Well,

9
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.070
they are the number one cloud accounting software designed exclusively for self

10
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.480
employed professionals.

11
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.240
That's many of you and used by more than 10 million people.

12
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:49.230
You can send invoices,
track your time,
and get paid very,
very quickly,

13
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.820
which suits the needs of a lot of freelancers,
a lot of [inaudible] and beyond.

14
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.100
You can't take pictures of receipts.

15
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:57.570
You can link your credit card and debit cards.

16
00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:02.550
So all the things you buy automatically appear in your fresh books in the right

17
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:06.150
category,
so on and so forth.
Makes taxes easy,
makes invoices easy.

18
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:10.830
It makes your life easier.
And also,
in fact,
I'd recommend a pdf.

19
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.750
Uh,
they didn't ask me to read this part by the way.

20
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.610
They'd put the other pdf awhile back called breaking the time barrier subtitle,

21
00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:20.640
how to unlock your true earning potential so you can search for breaking the

22
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:22.860
time barrier.
A lot of people ask me,

23
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.480
how can I get a four hour work week with a service business and the story in

24
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:31.080
that Ebook,
it's pdf is the short answer is really,
really good,

25
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.870
so I think you should also check that out.
So breaking the time error,

26
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.500
checking out,
but also why not test out freshbooks.

29

33
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.680
This episode is brought to you by Shopify.

34
00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:11.080
I have known and loved Shopify just about forever.

35
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.980
Back in 2009 when they had something like eight or 10 employees,

36
00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:19.120
now they have more than 2000 I helped them as an advisor to create the build a

37
00:02:19.121 --> 00:02:20.260
business competition,

38
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.740
which is now the world's largest entrepreneurship competition and many readers

39
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.400
of my blog,

40
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.320
first time business owners have ended up making millions and millions of dollars

41
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:34.560
each,
many of them as side gigs to their full time jobs.

42
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.460
So the goal of the build a business competition is to get,

43
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.000
would be entrepreneurs to get off the couch and make things happen.

44
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:47.001

47
00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:59.050
top sellers in a given category and the prize,

50
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:12.370
Tony Robbins and Daymond John and Seth Goden and so on,

51
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.600
or a Necker island,
which is Sir Richard Branson's private island.

52
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.020

Why?
Hello there.
This is Tim Ferriss team of [inaudible].
Hey,

62
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:02.230
you tongue breaker of chains,
mother of dragons.

63
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:04.240
Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

64
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.100
Where does my job always to deconstruct world class performers of many,

65
00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:13.000
many different varieties,
pulling out the lesson strategies,
habits,
et Cetera,

66
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:15.280
that you can apply and test in your own life.

67
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.580
My guest today is none other than the comedian's comedian bill burr at bill burr

68
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:25.240
on Twitter,
B.
I.
L.
L.
B.
U.
R.
R.
Please say hello.

69
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.810
Many of you know him as a standup comedian.
Of course,

70
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.410
his youtube clips have followed me around the planet as has his podcast.

71
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.050
He is one of the funniest humans alive.

72
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.080
I mean he loses his audience sometimes on purpose because making them laugh is

73
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:47.470
not enough of a challenge and then he'll wheel them back in and get them back on

74
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:51.670
his side.
And he has been requested for this podcast for many years.

75
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.470
Rolling Stone has called him quote the undisputed heavyweight champ of rage

76
00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:58.100
fueled humor and quote.

77
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.780
And when we finally got on the same stage to have a conversation and do this,

78
00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:05.080
he did not disappoint.

79
00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:08.650
So in this very wide ranging conversation and bill and I go all over the place,

80
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:11.740
we talked about how he found his way into standup comedy,
uh,

81
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:14.620
why he enjoys going for an encore after he's been booed,

82
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.910
how he started as a squeaky clean comedian and then ended up where he is now.

83
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.810
Just quite,
quite different.
Hell learning,
conserve as therapy,

84
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.750
the importance of enjoying success and much more.

85
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.610
This interview comes from my TV show,
fearless with fear,

86
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.650
the less,
less in parentheses because the objective is to learn to fear less,

87
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.330
not to be fearless,
not possible in which I interview world class performers.

88
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.390
That's probably my favorite Combo word onstage about how they've overcome doubt,

89
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:47.230
conquered fear,
and made their toughest decisions.

90
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.700
You can watch the entire first episode with illusionists David Blaine for

91
00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:56.050
free@att.net forward slash fearless,
no parentheses,

92
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.840
so all one word,

93
00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.230
att.net forward slash fearless the way you would usually spell it.

94
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.800
Highly recommend you check that out and to see all episodes.

95
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.890
You can get an undirect TV or you can go to direct TV now,

96
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.040
uh,

97
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.040
and I believe that's just direct TV now.com but direct TV Dot Comso d I r e c t

98
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:18.110
v.com and then click on direct.

99
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:23.111
Now we recorded about three hours of material on stage and only one hour was

100
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:23.931
used for TV.

101
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:28.520
That means this episode is almost entirely new content that did not appear on
TV.

102
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:30.710
So even if you saw that episode already,

103
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.460
you're going to get a lot more patented.
Bill Burns.

104
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:39.410
So please enjoy this wide ranging conversation with Mr. Bill.

105
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:40.603
Burn.

106
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.950
<v 0>Welcome,</v>

107
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.900
<v 1>fearless.
I'm your host Tim Ferris.</v>

108
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.710
And on this stage will be deconstructing world class performers to uncover the

109
00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:54.730
specific tactics that they've used,
overcome doubt,
tackle hard decisions,

110
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.200
and ultimately succeed.

111
00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.670
So imagine yourself all alone on stage in front of 14,000 people staring

112
00:07:00.671 --> 00:07:03.700
directly at you.
For many of us,
probably most of us,

113
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.340
that'd be a complete nightmare.
But for my guest tonight,

114
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.840
it's just another day at the office.

115
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.260
The man you're about to meet is one of the most prolific and respected comedians

116
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.110
in the world.
He's done five hour long comedy specials,

117
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.290
host one of the most popular podcasts of all time and it's the cocreator and

118
00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:19.570
star of the animated series.
F is for family.

119
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.090
Please welcome to the stage bill burr.

120
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.413
<v 0>How are you?</v>

121
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.810
How are you doing buddy?
I'm good,
I'm good.

122
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.480
<v 2>Do you ever get booed?
You got to come back.
If there's an encore,</v>

123
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.030
you got to go back.
I think you got to go back.

124
00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:48.410
So I wave and I remember there was this kid came running up cause I trashed all

125
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:52.040
of the teams cause the Phillies had won a world series yet they look like two

126
00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:56.060
years away from it at that point.
And I just remember this kid was like,
was,

127
00:07:56.061 --> 00:07:59.060
was yelling at me,
he's just going to just go down.
He's going,
fuck you.

128
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.480
Fuck you for giving me the finger yelling.
Fuck you.
When I was standing there,

129
00:08:02.481 --> 00:08:05.270
he was like a 30 yards away.
I just kept going.
I kept going.
What,
what?

130
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:09.800
They started going,
I literally just be like giving me the finger.

131
00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:11.610
Like I don't know where it is.
I just kept going.
One,

132
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:15.530
I literally got the keys like hopping mad by the end.
He was,
he was jumping up.

133
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.800
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
I can't,
I can't.

134
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.740
I remember I was standing next to opion we were just laughing going like,

135
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:28.940
how dumb is this kid?
So,
um,
but then I was,

136
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:33.590
I was mortified afterwards because I thought,
um,
you know,

137
00:08:33.591 --> 00:08:36.470
cause I knew like a lot,
a lot of stuff was coming up on,
you know,

138
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.110
people who are having phones,
they had cameras and I was just going,
you know,

139
00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:41.570
everyone's going to see me get booed.
This is going to be embarrassing.

140
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.230
I didn't know how it was going to play.
I just thought,
um,

141
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.820
that people weren't going to understand it.

142
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.720
<v 1>We first connected and started texting because we know Dave [inaudible] who was</v>

143
00:08:51.721 --> 00:08:53.460
an amazing professional drummer.
Yeah.

144
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.980
And teacher and the teacher is just incredible.
He is a

145
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.720
<v 2>great t shirt for you guys who are looking for teachers to buy and it says,</v>

146
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:05.310
uh,
let's say more slowly.
Once again,
something like that.
It's slow down,

147
00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:09.780
slow down and I think it says Pete or do it gate or do it again on the back.

148
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:11.520
And so he'll just get sick of sat in the same thanks.

149
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:15.010
We just point to one side of his shirt.
How did you get into drum it?

150
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.300
Y and why drumming?
Ah,
how did I get a drum?

151
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:21.570
I guess everyone was in the music,
you know,
where I grew up and everything.

152
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:26.140
And um,
I loved music,
but I didn't stop playing drum set.

153
00:09:26.141 --> 00:09:29.760
It was almost like 20 years old.
I started really late but,

154
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.050
and the reason for that was I was working in a warehouse and I came from a jock

155
00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:36.900
towns.
Everybody played sports,
you know,
pond hockey and all that.

156
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.310
So I did a lot of that stuff.

157
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.760
And like I liked music but there's only a couple of kids that play guitar and I

158
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:44.010
wasn't around it like I didn't think was possible.

159
00:09:44.011 --> 00:09:46.080
I thought what I was watching people doing on TV,

160
00:09:46.081 --> 00:09:47.760
I just didn't think he could do it.

161
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:51.090
And then I started working in this warehouse and there was kids my age and they

162
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:55.200
were from a different town that was more like kids put together bands and stuff

163
00:09:55.201 --> 00:09:57.450
and they were coming in and like the songs I liked,
they could play it.

164
00:09:57.451 --> 00:09:58.590
And I was like,
wow,
that's amazing.

165
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.240
So I started playing guitar and I just didn't have the patience for it.

166
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:07.980
And I think the thing about drumming was the steep sport background where it was

167
00:10:07.981 --> 00:10:09.510
like a real physical thing that,

168
00:10:09.511 --> 00:10:13.620
that it kind of came into play and I just started,
I just started playing and um,

169
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.150
I played for like six,
seven years,
um,
in,
during somewhere.

170
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.410
During that time I started playing,

171
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.470
I started doing standup and I moved to New York.

172
00:10:22.471 --> 00:10:25.650
And your neighbors don't mind if you're strumming a guitar.

173
00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:29.250
You can't like play drums in a one bedroom apartment without pissing everybody

174
00:10:29.251 --> 00:10:32.580
off.
So I kind of stopped for like five years before I got back into it.
Yeah.

175
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.540
I grew up on long island.
I feel like we have the,
we don't have a tough accent.

176
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.480
It's just a bad accent.
Yeah,
I think it was a,

177
00:10:39.481 --> 00:10:43.320
it's a lot like the show we do efforts of family with where it was just like the

178
00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:46.860
parents just sent you outside and some days you had good days,

179
00:10:46.861 --> 00:10:48.270
some days she had bad days,

180
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:51.450
sometimes you just ran into bigger kids and they would just beat the shit out of

181
00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:54.590
you for no reason.
I just was thinking,

182
00:10:54.591 --> 00:10:57.870
I remember them putting in a pool one time and they would just,
they were like,

183
00:10:57.871 --> 00:11:00.990
you know,
whatever the hell it is when they're smoothing out the concrete.

184
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.950
And this older kid dared me to throw right into it.
So I,

185
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.890
I wanted his approval and I just took this big rock and this guy would just

186
00:11:07.891 --> 00:11:09.510
smoothing it out and just throw it down.

187
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.940
This guy almost killed me,
killed me.

188
00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:18.060
So that's back when you could almost kill a kid.
And it was,
it wasn't a problem.

189
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.800
It was no cell phone.
Video was all your word against theirs.
So

190
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.310
I think a lot of the reasons why I started doing standup was I just thought,

191
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.810
okay,
I'm going to get onstage,

192
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.050
show people that I'm a funny guy and people will stop fucking with me.

193
00:11:34.051 --> 00:11:38.040
Like that was basically,
and then they,
and then that was,
that was,

194
00:11:38.041 --> 00:11:39.990
I remember thinking then everything's going to fall into place.

195
00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:41.760
I meet the girl of my dreams,
I make my money,

196
00:11:41.761 --> 00:11:43.470
I'll get my whatever the hell I want a house.

197
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.620
And so I only worked on getting better as a comedian.

198
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.230
And then by the time I got to my mid thirties,

199
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:54.080
like being a comedian was like 600 miles down the road and everything else was

200
00:11:54.081 --> 00:11:57.700
that the starting blocks and like literally like social interactions.

201
00:11:57.701 --> 00:12:01.450
I kept messing up relationships.
I mean I was 36 I was still sleeping,

202
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:06.220
sleeping on a Futon,
um,
in what they call was a one bedroom apartment,

203
00:12:06.221 --> 00:12:08.530
which was bullshit because I met the woman who lived upstairs.

204
00:12:08.531 --> 00:12:10.690
We have the exact same apartment and hers was a studio.

205
00:12:10.691 --> 00:12:15.140
They just slammed a wall and a mine.
And um,
yeah,

206
00:12:15.141 --> 00:12:18.910
so I remembered like those,
there was like a three year period of like,

207
00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:22.480
I was in a full on depression and I was so detached.
I didn't,
I wasn't even,

208
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:27.220
I wasn't even aware of it.
When,
what,
what was the age roughly on that?

209
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.970
Oh,
I dunno.
It was like the early two thousands,
whatever that may,
late nineties,

210
00:12:30.971 --> 00:12:33.580
early two thousands.
It might've been a five,
six year.
I can't remember.

211
00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.360
I didn't worry about making it.

212
00:12:37.361 --> 00:12:39.760
I didn't worry about how am I going to make money.
I didn't work.
I just like,

213
00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:44.050
I'm doing this.
And when Billy got off stage,
I mean it was the end of the night,

214
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.890
I was like going like,
who do I call for open mics?
Like how do I do this?

215
00:12:47.891 --> 00:12:51.270
And I remember he wrote down,
Rita and I read a choice who was a,

216
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.580
she used to book it and uh,
she was like back then,

217
00:12:54.581 --> 00:12:57.550
like one of the big characters,
like used to always run into a comedy club.

218
00:12:57.551 --> 00:13:01.460
So I used to call in to do open mikes and uh,

219
00:13:01.461 --> 00:13:04.930
I remember she used once she got to know me and she thought I was kind of funny.

220
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.090
I call up and be like,
hey,
hey Rita,

221
00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:10.180
it's a bill Burra I'd like to Joe doing it and it should go.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no bill,

222
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:15.110
you call me and you say,
Rita,
this is open.
Miker Bill Burr.
I was,

223
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.950
she was always breaking balls.
So I would always laugh and I would do it.

224
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.240
And she was kind of like a test,

225
00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.880
like if you had like a sense of humor about yourself.

226
00:13:21.881 --> 00:13:26.200
And I gradually like work my way in
to doing stand up.

227
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:30.790
You know,
I remember one time I did a show,
I've told this before,

228
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.100
but I did this show.
I was,
I was uh,

229
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.640
seeing this woman when I was in New York and,
and I'm here.

230
00:13:36.641 --> 00:13:38.230
She came over and I was making a dinner,
whatever.

231
00:13:38.231 --> 00:13:39.670
And then I had a spot at the comic strip,

232
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.250
which where I was living was right around the corner.
So I said,

233
00:13:42.251 --> 00:13:44.500
I got to go run to a spot.
And during the week,
I mean,
you know,

234
00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:45.051
she asked me what the,

235
00:13:45.051 --> 00:13:47.480
what are those spots pay and they would like the comic strip was hilarious.

236
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.760
It was like $5,

237
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:53.110
$8 seven and it's basically just going up there trying out material.

238
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.570
And I went up there and,
um,

239
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.510
I tried out new material and it worked and I was psyched.

240
00:13:58.511 --> 00:14:01.600
And I came home and I've finished like cooking the dinner or whatever and they

241
00:14:01.601 --> 00:14:04.320
was making,
I can't remember what was making an a,

242
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:08.470
I did this stupid dance in the kitchen and she was laughing and I was dancing

243
00:14:08.471 --> 00:14:12.040
cause I had this new material,
I was excited.
And then she got like this,
uh,

244
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:16.660
she got to sad look on her face.
God,
I dance that bad.
Like what,

245
00:14:16.661 --> 00:14:19.090
what's the matter,
right.
And she goes,
no,
she goes,

246
00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:22.270
I just wish I had a job where I got paid $8.

247
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.910
I came home and danced in a kitchen

248
00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.040
and I never forgot that.
I was like,
Oh yeah,
I didn't even,

249
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.240
I didn't even think that cause I got this weird thing about money where I,

250
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:36.820
I want to have it so I'm not broke,
but I don't give a shit about it.

251
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.920
But I also don't want to have debt,
so I don't overextend myself,
but I don't,
uh,

252
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.410
I don't give a shit about it.
Like I will,

253
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.930
I will pay extra to not go through the process.

254
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:51.620
Like I can't even act like I don't use like,
you know,
frequent flyer miles.

255
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:53.090
Like my wife signed me up for him,

256
00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:56.390
but I don't use them ever because I didn't want to go through the fucking,

257
00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.231
you know,

258
00:14:57.231 --> 00:15:00.350
logging in and all of a sudden I'm working for American Airlines and I got to

259
00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:02.870
work for these fucking people.
Like I'll buy my own ticket.

260
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:07.280
I don't want to do this.
Yeah,
I won't cancel shit.

261
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.660
Like I got like gym memberships,
I've never canceled cause I'm not,

262
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.100
cause I'm not going through going on that stupid thing.

263
00:15:16.101 --> 00:15:19.130
And if you want to do this,
press one,
if you want to do that press too.

264
00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:23.390
Like I got,
I dunno,
like my free time.
I,
I,

265
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:27.340
I cherish it and I'm not like going to fucking,
I'm not,

266
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.570
I'm not going to be laying on my death bed one time,

267
00:15:29.571 --> 00:15:34.550
just thinking about how many hours I spent on the phone going,

268
00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:38.570
person,
person,
operator,
Parson,
fuck you.
Like,

269
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:42.680
I know I don't want to do that.
So,
um,
I would rather pay the,

270
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.920
I'd rather pay the extra charts yet.

271
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:49.790
So a little bit later I want to pull up the,

272
00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:54.490
not caring about money examples that I have found most personally am using,

273
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:59.480
which are actually from your podcast.
So we'll get to those.
Okay.
But,
uh,

274
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.500
at the time said,
if you can just place us,

275
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.850
when were you working in your dad's office and maybe you could describe what

276
00:16:07.851 --> 00:16:12.510
your dad did?
Early nineties to mid nineties,
I was working in a,
um,

277
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:18.030
my work in a dental office and I had been laid off from the warehouse with the

278
00:16:18.261 --> 00:16:21.080
guy all coked up.
Right.
But my car was paid off,
thank God.

279
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:22.040
And I was living at home,

280
00:16:22.041 --> 00:16:25.340
so I was kind of living like this little existence to like three months.

281
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:28.400
And my dad started,
uh,
working with this other guy,

282
00:16:28.401 --> 00:16:30.680
went into practice with them and I need,
he needed some,
you know,

283
00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:32.870
I think it was just sick of watching me being around the house.

284
00:16:32.871 --> 00:16:35.600
So nepotism kicked in and next thing you know,

285
00:16:35.601 --> 00:16:37.790
I've got a lab coat and I'm standing next to him,

286
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:41.420
handed him all the shit as he's taking teeth out and stuff.

287
00:16:41.421 --> 00:16:46.290
And I had to get past the gross factor of that.
And uh,

288
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.820
then I learned how it pulled up models and stuff and takes x rays.

289
00:16:49.821 --> 00:16:52.910
And I was actually,
I was halfway decent at it,
but I knew that,
you know,

290
00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.150
for half a second I thought maybe,
you know,
I would do this.

291
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.990
But what was funny was I had to call my father,
Dr. Berger.

292
00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:03.230
I couldn't call him dad in front of a patient because that would be weird.
Like,

293
00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:07.550
Hey dad.
So I had to keep it professional.

294
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.260
And uh,

295
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.360
when I worked there was around the time when I started doing standup and what

296
00:17:12.361 --> 00:17:12.681
sucked.

297
00:17:12.681 --> 00:17:16.710
I was still living at home so he knew because at the end of the night to be away

298
00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:20.070
working tonight and I would have like a,
I'd have like a Gig in Maine live in,

299
00:17:20.071 --> 00:17:23.150
in Massachusetts and I went for free and I would drive up there and maybe like

300
00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:23.721
five,

301
00:17:23.721 --> 00:17:26.810
10 bucks gas money and I would drive all the way up and my dad would have like

302
00:17:26.811 --> 00:17:30.170
seven o'clock patients and shit.
Like he worked like a lunatic.

303
00:17:30.171 --> 00:17:34.540
Like from seven to seven.
He would side book root canals like on Molders,

304
00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:37.640
which is three,
you know,
nerve involvements.
We'd be,

305
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.360
we'd like numb up a guy and then we go in the other room and like,

306
00:17:41.361 --> 00:17:44.100
and he didn't give a shit too.
Like I don't,
one time some homeless guy came in,

307
00:17:44.101 --> 00:17:46.910
he was like,
I finally got a lunch because you'd never get a lunch with them.

308
00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:51.090
This guy came in,
you know,
he was,
you know,
substance abuse and he was all,

309
00:17:51.091 --> 00:17:54.750
you know,
and all these other guys I noticed with just give a medicine.

310
00:17:54.751 --> 00:17:57.250
They would leave,
my dad would be like,
and just get them in there and blah blah.

311
00:17:57.251 --> 00:18:00.360
And I was like pissed and have we had doctor by what the fuck?

312
00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:03.570
Like can we just get this guy,
you know?
And he just goes,
look,
he goes,

313
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.800
I can't go home tonight.
No one,

314
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:07.170
there's some guy in pain and I didn't do anything.

315
00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:14.310
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

316
00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:19.760
<v 2>did you get material for,
for your comedy from that experience?
So yeah,
big test.</v>

317
00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.680
I read that you had dental comedy early and I don't know dental comedy is,

318
00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.920
Oh yeah,
no,
no.
I had all of it.
I owe that.
My Dad used to like,

319
00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:31.750
he used to set me up because he knew that I swear to God if I had like a,

320
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.020
like a late show,
then he would go extra fast.

321
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:38.040
He'd just go x gimme that gimme that deal.
Christ,
but you're out to lunch.

322
00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.970
He would start giving me shit in front of the patient.
I used to tell him like,

323
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.230
like dad,
you can't do that type of stuff.
And like he,
he wasn't like that,

324
00:18:44.231 --> 00:18:49.230
but I got a lot of it out of like patients.
Like I remember this guy came in,
uh,

325
00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:53.290
I used to work totally squeaky clean,
totally clean.

326
00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.870
Cause I didn't want to offend anybody because I didn't want to get heckled cause

327
00:18:55.871 --> 00:18:57.430
I was still this really shy person.
Right.

328
00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:02.590
So I remember this guy came in one time and like his teeth were all rotting out

329
00:19:02.591 --> 00:19:04.570
and I just remember he said something like,
I like doc,
you know,

330
00:19:04.571 --> 00:19:06.220
I don't want to stay with the problem is,
you know,
I,

331
00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:11.080
I brushed my teeth almost every day.
Right?
That's what he said.
So

332
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:14.940
my punchline to that was like,
oh yeah,

333
00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.670
well do you wipe your ass almost every time you take a shit.

334
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.720
So for a while I started closing on that joke and I would work totally squeaky

335
00:19:24.151 --> 00:19:26.610
clean going up there looking like Ron Howard never.
He's like,

336
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.090
Oh look at this wholesome guy.
And then out of nowhere I would just end with,

337
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:33.600
yeah,
you wipe your ass so much every time you take a shit.
And they'd be like,

338
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:37.410
dude,
I'm
like dude,
what's going on?

339
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.790
I had no idea what I was doing.

340
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:42.120
I actually was a prop back for a second where I had one problem.

341
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:45.780
For whatever reason.
You're not allowed to have props in comedy and acting.

342
00:19:45.781 --> 00:19:49.710
It's fine.
I have no idea.
Right.
So we had this dental mass,

343
00:19:49.711 --> 00:19:52.050
like when you really had some gnarly shit going on,

344
00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.420
they had these plastic things.

345
00:19:53.421 --> 00:19:56.250
It looked like a welder's shield but it's all plastic and we just,

346
00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.040
I'll spare you the details and stuff is flying at you.

347
00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:03.990
So I used to bring that and I would take it out after I would do all the dental

348
00:20:03.991 --> 00:20:07.500
material and be like,
yeah,
my job so bad.
Like I have to wear this at work.

349
00:20:07.501 --> 00:20:11.940
And I would just put it on and I had no joke and I would put it on and they'd

350
00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:15.770
sort of chuckle and be like waiting for the joke.
And then behind the mass,

351
00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.250
like almost like muffled.
I'd be like

352
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:24.440
taken away and I put it back in my little duffle bag and I'd walk away.

353
00:20:24.871 --> 00:20:27.030
It was just,
it was horrible.

354
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:32.820
How do you know when something is close and when something is done?
Like A,

355
00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:36.160
when you're working on a joke or a piece of writing,

356
00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.910
how do you know when something's done?
Well,

357
00:20:39.911 --> 00:20:43.630
I think when I'm on a tour and none of the jokes are done until I start getting

358
00:20:43.631 --> 00:20:45.400
sick of them,
then I'm like,
all right,

359
00:20:45.401 --> 00:20:49.420
I need to record these and document these because they're going to start

360
00:20:49.421 --> 00:20:53.770
becoming not funny because they're starting to feel like a job to tell them I'm

361
00:20:53.771 --> 00:20:55.180
sick of this joke and all that.
God,

362
00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:59.350
I want to do this joke and this is one so long and I might not think that

363
00:20:59.351 --> 00:21:00.280
anymore.
And those things,

364
00:21:00.281 --> 00:21:03.370
sometimes those things just drop away and you never record them or anything.

365
00:21:03.371 --> 00:21:08.020
So I'd say it's like that when you bond that first time,

366
00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:10.150
was that a Kelly's the third,

367
00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:15.310
third gig chases you did your research is try to help him find that one.

368
00:21:15.311 --> 00:21:19.210
I must have told that on another podcast.
So the good team helping me,

369
00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.890
magic elves in the back as well.

370
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:25.060
The way you got to cover that camera up on your flat screen and on your laptop.

371
00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.350
That's actually really,
that's true.
You,

372
00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.580
they tried to see what you're watching and shit.
If you bang your wife.

373
00:21:33.581 --> 00:21:35.290
So I want to talk about last Tuesday night

374
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:43.090
when you,
uh,
I imagine the drive back after that Gig was very different from uh,

375
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:47.390
from the Motley Crue.
They're mortified,
mortified.
How did you,

376
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:51.550
what did you do to get yourself back on the horse for the V for the next Gig?

377
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.180
I mean,
would you say to yourself before you got on stage to the next time?

378
00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.920
Because a lot of people will like fall off.
They don't get back.

379
00:21:56.921 --> 00:22:00.010
Oh well I fell off a lot of things that need to get back on.

380
00:22:00.011 --> 00:22:03.760
But like I also always knew I knew if I was good at something or if I wasn't

381
00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.730
like,
you know what I mean?
Like,
as much as I love playing drums and everything,

382
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.870
I went to the music store enough times and saw an eight year old get on a drum

383
00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:13.560
kit and I'd be like,
dude,
like I would pay you to take the,

384
00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.240
it's like I just didn't have it.
Like it's a hobby.

385
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.890
It's something I enjoyed doing,

386
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:22.750
but I would never subject anybody to it on a professional level.
So,
um,

387
00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.170
this happens to me a lot with my add is I went down that road and I forgot the

388
00:22:26.171 --> 00:22:31.090
question.
Question was,
which is fine by the way.
Uh,

389
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.810
the question was how did you get back on the horse?

390
00:22:34.811 --> 00:22:37.180
Would you say to yourself before getting back on stage?

391
00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.050
It never dawned on me not to do it again.
Right.

392
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:43.690
And you are committed to the next gig.

393
00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.350
All the other social shit that mortified me.
I just stayed away from it.

394
00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.820
But that thing was like,
I don't think I had another might be.
I just was like,

395
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:54.880
you knew,
you know what's going to happen.
It's like you're riding a motorcycle,

396
00:22:54.881 --> 00:22:58.030
you know,
one of these days you're going to go down.

397
00:22:58.031 --> 00:22:59.380
You just hope you're going to live.

398
00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:05.920
You talked about some dark periods earlier,
I'm forgetting the exact timeline,

399
00:23:05.921 --> 00:23:07.870
but what precipitated that?
Yes.

400
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:11.530
He said it was a couple of years and for people who don't know and I almost off

401
00:23:11.531 --> 00:23:15.670
myself,
uh,
during a year off from college.
So it's like I've had some,

402
00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:20.740
some battles.
What motive we what,
what,
how are we going to do it?
You know what?

403
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:23.590
So this is a good question and I'll tell you why.

404
00:23:23.591 --> 00:23:25.960
I'm not going to give an answer because it was a really good plan.

405
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:30.880
It was a plan that would minimize guilt or self blaming on the part of my
family.

406
00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.380
It was really well thought through.

407
00:23:32.381 --> 00:23:37.381
I had everything specked out and so for the right hip line in the woods and it

408
00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:43.840
was so mostly,
yeah.
Involve some porcupines a little bit of cure.

409
00:23:43.841 --> 00:23:45.980
All right.
Yeah,
it was very complex.

410
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.910
<v 3>Hard to replicate.
But uh,
yeah,
I wouldn't want people to copycat it if I,</v>

411
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:54.710
if I put it out there.
But what,
what precipitated that period for you?

412
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:57.990
<v 4>Um,
uh,</v>

413
00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:00.210
<v 2>what does that mean?
What came before that</v>

414
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:01.860
<v 3>triggered it?
Like what led</v>

415
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.220
usually weatherman language.
My bad.
I don't know why.

416
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.300
It just comes out of me sometimes.
Uh,
yeah.
What led,
what led to it?

417
00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.420
Like what triggered is going into that fight?

418
00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:22.950
Have you laughing?
Didn't know what it meant either.
Thank you.

419
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:32.830
<v 2>I was,
it was,
I was just going full speed towards a wall that I,
you know,</v>

420
00:24:32.831 --> 00:24:34.030
cause I thought I was normal,

421
00:24:34.031 --> 00:24:37.720
well adjusted and even though I knew I had like a crazy temper,

422
00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.400
I had this period where I just was really just like,
you know,

423
00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:44.820
I would be what you needed me to be.
Yeah.
And like I really had like,

424
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:48.890
I was friends with everybody.
Right.
Which is not a real thing.
Yeah.

425
00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.070
If you're being who you are,
I would just,

426
00:24:51.071 --> 00:24:55.510
I would adjust my shit so I wouldn't cause any friction.
So that wouldn't be,

427
00:24:55.511 --> 00:24:58.960
you know,
any like,
you know,
the Shit I dealt with coming up,

428
00:24:58.961 --> 00:25:00.700
I had enough of people screaming and yelling.

429
00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:04.970
I had enough of fighting and all that stuff that I would just adjust my behavior

430
00:25:04.971 --> 00:25:07.780
so then we,
we would just be smooth.
And,
um,

431
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.090
I just think using that as a game plan eventually you just going to use,

432
00:25:13.091 --> 00:25:17.590
so going to spin away from who the hell you are.
Um,
that I think that,

433
00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:21.430
you know,
and also just focusing on staying up and not other areas of my life.

434
00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:26.700
I think then that's when the anger and all of that stuff started to come up and

435
00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:30.880
then I kind of went like this completely different person and I really started

436
00:25:30.881 --> 00:25:35.560
snapping about nothing for a good 12 years.
And uh,

437
00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.500
I think just somewhere in there,
somewhere in there,

438
00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.940
I mean maybe I was always like depressed,
but I didn't realize it.

439
00:25:42.941 --> 00:25:45.190
I think I just didn't realize it.
And somewhere along the line,
you know,

440
00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:49.900
one of the umpteen thousand poor women that ever came across me,

441
00:25:49.901 --> 00:25:54.760
like one of them finally told me to go to therapy and I went there thinking
like,

442
00:25:54.761 --> 00:25:56.510
yeah,
I'm fine if blah,
blah,
blah.

443
00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:00.100
Then you start telling story and it was all this shit that I knew that happened

444
00:26:00.101 --> 00:26:02.240
but was just hovering.
Yep.
It just saw it.

445
00:26:02.241 --> 00:26:04.990
It's just over here and you're just going around in life.

446
00:26:04.991 --> 00:26:06.970
And then all of a sudden when you start talking about it,

447
00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.330
it's you say it out loud,
it's like,
oh,
that's a real thing.
Oh,

448
00:26:10.331 --> 00:26:12.790
that really did happen to me.
It's like,
and then you started thinking like,
wow,

449
00:26:12.791 --> 00:26:13.780
I'm pretty fucked up.

450
00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:17.103
<v 3>Hey and I'm not here.</v>

451
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.900
<v 2>Yeah,
I'm really not happy.</v>

452
00:26:18.901 --> 00:26:23.250
Like I think I really started getting conscious of what my brain was telling me

453
00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:27.690
and what my,
if my brain was like a friend,
I would like be like,
yeah,
dude,

454
00:26:27.691 --> 00:26:28.524
we can't do this.

455
00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:30.720
<v 3>You're just,
well,
I'm in</v>

456
00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.010
<v 2>me out,
man.
I mean,
Jesus Christ.
Do you ever see the light,
the fuck?
You know?</v>

457
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:39.210
So then fortunately I wasn't like clinically,

458
00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.950
so I didn't need any,
any medicine.
All I needed was a,
I just needed to,

459
00:26:43.951 --> 00:26:48.150
I just became aware of it
and I'd be like,
all right,
well there's that thought.

460
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.040
Do you want to have that thought or you want to go to the gym?

461
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.850
I got back into playing drums,
which was a great thing.
And,
um,

462
00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.280
then I also said I just stopped giving a shit about making it in a way where

463
00:26:58.281 --> 00:27:01.050
it's just like,
you know what?
Forget this.
I'm just going to do what I do.

464
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.230
Cause I went through that whole period like you know,
I know.

465
00:27:03.231 --> 00:27:04.620
I mean when are you guys trying to make it out here?

466
00:27:04.621 --> 00:27:07.030
You just go through that period where you're just like,
oh they,
they,

467
00:27:07.031 --> 00:27:08.870
they like guys with the,
you know,

468
00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:13.500
whatever blue button down shirts and you wearing the blue button down shirts and

469
00:27:13.501 --> 00:27:16.020
people who talk about this,
they like it my time.

470
00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:21.040
It's gone from the tail end of the sport coat guy into the grunge guy into the

471
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:26.820
AllSeen into the whole like whatever that period was where guys in their

472
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.880
thirties acted like they were 14 and they were awkward and just,
you know,

473
00:27:29.881 --> 00:27:34.560
the Hoodie like that.
My wife called up my,
uh,
which you call them Ma,

474
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.820
not baby men or something.
Man.
Boys,
man and boys,
the streets,

475
00:27:37.821 --> 00:27:40.590
she called them and I don't know,
I'm just like awkward.

476
00:27:40.591 --> 00:27:43.140
Like that was just this default thing.
Yeah.
It's like,
oh great.

477
00:27:43.141 --> 00:27:46.710
Now I have to hold up both ends of the conversation.
So I really just,

478
00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:50.100
those people I really just,
I kinda got hostile with,
I was just like,

479
00:27:50.101 --> 00:27:54.110
well when you get over with that,
you know and you can fucking talk to me.
Yeah,

480
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.530
you are awkward.
This is weird.
And I also thought a lot of people know,

481
00:27:58.531 --> 00:27:59.970
but a lot of people that do that,

482
00:27:59.971 --> 00:28:03.660
it's also what's a passive aggressive thing to come in and fucking steal focus

483
00:28:03.661 --> 00:28:06.660
and we all have to deal with how awkward you are and make sure you're okay.

484
00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.090
It's like fuck you dude,
you're in your thirties figure this out.

485
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:14.370
I never forget one time I was in a green room in New York,

486
00:28:14.371 --> 00:28:18.090
I was living in La and I met an old friend and we were talking about the old

487
00:28:18.091 --> 00:28:21.000
days about when we,
I remember this guy,
I remember that night when this happened,

488
00:28:21.001 --> 00:28:23.490
we having a great time and then was younger comics and they will listen.

489
00:28:23.491 --> 00:28:26.490
And then some people who actually were in the tail end of the stories we have in

490
00:28:26.491 --> 00:28:27.420
this great time.

491
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:32.870
And then this woman comes in comedian and she was like socially awkward and she

492
00:28:33.601 --> 00:28:36.500
didn't know how to like get into it.
So we're all,
yeah,
you haven't,

493
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:37.440
we're all laughing,
everything.

494
00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.900
And she walked right into the middle of the circle.
I swear to God,

495
00:28:39.901 --> 00:28:41.580
she just walked in.
I'm like,
hello,

496
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:43.940
<v 5>hello,
hello,
hello.</v>

497
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:48.170
<v 2>And she was like mocking saying hello.
Yeah.</v>

498
00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:52.980
But then totally stole all the focus and everyone's just like,
oh Whoa,
wait,

499
00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.740
y'all riding and all the fun one out of the room.

500
00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:01.060
And then everyone was dealing with her and then she left and I said to my free

501
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:05.570
to go do what the fuck.
What the fuck was that?
That was like,

502
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.940
that was some rude shit.
We were having a great time.

503
00:29:08.941 --> 00:29:11.490
And like if you don't have to say fucking alone,
learn how to do it,

504
00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:16.320
they'll come in and take the whole thing away.
Just ruin this thing.

505
00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:19.020
And that was the last time.
That was the last time I was like,

506
00:29:19.021 --> 00:29:20.110
fuck these awkward people.

507
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.050
<v 5>Well,
like if you're really,
if you really are,</v>

508
00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:27.630
I don't want to like bully people.
I don't want to

509
00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.710
<v 2>please stop me if they really are socially awkward and stuff like that,</v>

510
00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:34.670
I'll work with you.
But if you've just didn't braced right,
I'm awkward now.

511
00:29:34.671 --> 00:29:39.120
The world has to deal with it.
If that's your shit.
Yeah,
go.
Yeah,

512
00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.560
go fuck yourself.
So we're all,

513
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.371
<v 3>we're all,</v>

514
00:29:42.371 --> 00:29:45.940
we also have a clip that will pull up in a minute from F is for family.

515
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:47.320
That might,
I don't know.

516
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:51.160
Also now that I've seen all the episodes and now that you're telling me a lot of

517
00:29:51.161 --> 00:29:53.930
these stories,
I can see where I think a lot of them came from there.

518
00:29:53.931 --> 00:29:55.810
There's one clip that will pull up in a little bit.

519
00:29:55.811 --> 00:30:00.370
I'm not going to her just right now,
but,
uh,
what have you found to help

520
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.270
get you out of a depressive period?

521
00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.460
You mentioned exercise a for instance.
I mean,
I've,

522
00:30:07.461 --> 00:30:09.700
I've found drummers in general be very happy people,

523
00:30:09.701 --> 00:30:11.890
I don't know if they're happy and then they end up jumping or if it's because of

524
00:30:11.891 --> 00:30:15.760
the physical aspect of just going animal on a drum kit.
It's awesome.

525
00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:19.820
It's a great feeling.
I also had,
uh,

526
00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:24.940
played the drums in college,
but not very good at all.
But that was my experience.

527
00:30:24.941 --> 00:30:28.890
It was,
it was like a,
it alleviated a lot of these darker spots.

528
00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:31.720
Is there anything else that you've found particularly helpful?

529
00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:33.800
<v 2>Yeah,
I just do shit.</v>

530
00:30:33.801 --> 00:30:36.650
I just get up and do something that day and it's literally like,
I'll,

531
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:39.890
I will like,
you know,
I'll go on you like to cook and stuff.

532
00:30:39.891 --> 00:30:42.640
So I'll go on youtube and I'll see somebody,
uh,

533
00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:48.280
you know what I did recently?
Um,
who's the guy from Hell's kitchen?
I was,
uh,

534
00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.960
uh,
Gordon Ramsay.
Yeah.
Gordon Ramsay.
Dude.
He's got this video,

535
00:30:50.961 --> 00:30:53.570
like the sickest scrambled egg you're ever going to make it and your life.

536
00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:58.160
It's insane.
And,
um,
I just remember watching it and I was just like,

537
00:30:58.161 --> 00:31:02.690
I'm going to fucking make that thing and uh,
cause I have the free time,

538
00:31:02.691 --> 00:31:04.790
like as a comedian,
like I can do it.

539
00:31:04.791 --> 00:31:08.120
And I went out and I bought all the ingredients and all that type of stuff.
And,

540
00:31:08.121 --> 00:31:12.440
uh,
that's,
that's what I do and I've,
I,
or I'll learn something.

541
00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:15.800
Um,
um,
you know,

542
00:31:15.801 --> 00:31:19.550
but I do have my hobbies like cooking and playing drums and a few other things

543
00:31:19.551 --> 00:31:24.110
that I do.
And it's just like,
I try to have like that moment in the day,

544
00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:29.330
um,
like learn something or go somewhere like in what,
but working out is a,
is a,

545
00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:31.130
is a big thing because that's a big thing.

546
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:37.730
<v 3>How did your goals change if they did from when you're trying to force fit</v>

547
00:31:37.731 --> 00:31:38.121
yourself?

548
00:31:38.121 --> 00:31:42.680
Like what was the kind of pinnacle that you had in mind for making it to after

549
00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:43.970
golf?

550
00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:47.960
<v 2>Me Coming up,
it was all about having an Hbo Special Cause Hbo specials,
those,</v>

551
00:31:47.961 --> 00:31:49.310
those were the best comics.

552
00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:53.840
That's all the great guys that I saw coming up you've got on HBO is totally

553
00:31:53.841 --> 00:31:58.400
uncensored.
And they were the home for that.
And unfortunately when I got into it,

554
00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:02.600
um,
you know,
write them like early nineties.
By the mid nineties,

555
00:32:02.601 --> 00:32:06.380
they just stopped doing it for like 10 years.
And um,

556
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:08.600
so I don't,
I,
that was,

557
00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.900
that's when I kind of felt rudderless because when HBO stopped doing their

558
00:32:11.901 --> 00:32:15.040
specials,
I didn't know what to do.
And then what,

559
00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:20.240
what comedy central started doing the half hours they,
you,
you are,
um,

560
00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.420
the fact that they had commercials,
they basically,

561
00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:24.770
I think it's eight minutes each hour.

562
00:32:24.771 --> 00:32:28.340
So they're automatically going to take 16 minutes out or eight minutes out of a

563
00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.980
half hour.
And then they also,
they would stay,

564
00:32:30.981 --> 00:32:34.790
would beep out the curses with like the worst,
most archaic,

565
00:32:34.791 --> 00:32:38.720
like big pape so it really,
and they wouldn't just fade it down and come back up.

566
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:39.920
So um,

567
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:42.680
I remember watching specials and just thinking that was really distracting.

568
00:32:42.681 --> 00:32:46.460
So once again,
I work clean.
So if you watch my first half hour of comedy central,

569
00:32:46.461 --> 00:32:50.870
I worked totally clean.
Um,
and I gave them,

570
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:56.330
I gave them the least amount of material that I could because I just looked at

571
00:32:56.331 --> 00:32:58.330
it cause those guys doing like,
all right,
here's a half,
you know,

572
00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.550
it's a half hour then we're only gonna use 22 minutes.
They would,

573
00:33:01.551 --> 00:33:06.260
they they would do is they do 40.
So then you had this guy who you didn't know,

574
00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:09.680
you didn't approve of,
is now going to hack 40 minutes down to 22.

575
00:33:09.681 --> 00:33:13.210
What is he going to do?
Exactly.
So I was like,
immediately I was like,
wow,

576
00:33:13.211 --> 00:33:17.300
fuck that.
What kind,
what's the least you can do?

577
00:33:17.301 --> 00:33:20.660
And they see at least you can mount of time you can do is like 25 or 26.

578
00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:25.130
And I did exactly that.
So the worst you could do was butcher for of it out,

579
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:28.820
but the rest of it was going to look good.
So I was happy with it.
And um,

580
00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.220
you know,
it was just kind of doing stuff like that,

581
00:33:31.221 --> 00:33:36.221
but it still wasn't what I wanted because it wasn't me that that half hour that

582
00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:37.910
I did that was me,

583
00:33:37.911 --> 00:33:40.910
like just kind of doing an extended Letterman spot where I was working totally

584
00:33:40.911 --> 00:33:42.110
clean.
And,

585
00:33:42.111 --> 00:33:46.880
but it wasn't until HBO came back and did the half hours and I did those,

586
00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:50.930
that uh,
I actually got to do,
it was the first time people got to see me,

587
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:52.580
you know,
not in a club.

588
00:33:52.581 --> 00:33:57.010
They were at home and they got to see that this is what I do and it,
you know,

589
00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:59.660
and that was the same time I got on the opiate Anthony show and they all kind of

590
00:33:59.661 --> 00:34:00.620
came out at the same time.

591
00:34:00.621 --> 00:34:04.640
It was the first time I went to a club and it was sold out and people were there

592
00:34:04.641 --> 00:34:08.810
to see me,
which was a whole other level of pressure and use.

593
00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.010
It used to be yes.

594
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.900
<v 0>[inaudible].
Up</v>

595
00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.930
<v 2>until then it was people coming to the club because that's what they did.</v>

596
00:34:17.931 --> 00:34:20.390
They had nothing else to do like,
oh,
it's good on the comedy club.

597
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.700
And you had to prove to them that you were funny.

598
00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.250
And I just remember thinking like,
imagine if they came to see me,

599
00:34:25.251 --> 00:34:28.520
how much easier this would be.
I didn't realize the other pressure was like,
no,

600
00:34:28.521 --> 00:34:32.660
we saw that.
So we're expecting at least that if not better.
And then it's like,

601
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:33.790
oh man.
Um,

602
00:34:33.890 --> 00:34:38.890
so that took me like a good three months of that there was a new kind of

603
00:34:38.931 --> 00:34:43.340
nervousness experienced to get over of,
of people expecting like,
yeah,

604
00:34:43.341 --> 00:34:46.550
we're here to see you.
We like what you do.
Don't ruin this.

605
00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:51.320
What was the first special,
um,

606
00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:54.410
the first half hour or not the comedy central,

607
00:34:54.411 --> 00:34:58.760
but the first time you can be yourself.
Oh,
that was the HBO half hour that I did.

608
00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:03.370
And um,
that was in two thousand five thousand five stone.

609
00:35:03.371 --> 00:35:06.530
Remember April,
2005 came out in September.
Has,

610
00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:10.370
is there anything since then,
and then,
and this is an assumption on my part,

611
00:35:10.371 --> 00:35:10.941
which is dangerous,

612
00:35:10.941 --> 00:35:14.360
but did you feel like you had summited the mountain at that point?

613
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:18.770
Did you feel like you'd arrived?
No,
I felt that somewhere in like 2009,

614
00:35:18.771 --> 00:35:21.410
2010 by then and I'd done a couple of hours.

615
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:24.050
I've done my second hour for Netflix,

616
00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:28.130
which became the new HBO as far as just totally uncensored.
And,
um,

617
00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:33.260
I remember,
I think I bought a house at that point.
I bought a house.
Right.

618
00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:33.950
And still,
you know,

619
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:38.190
people didn't really niche following in that and I said to my wife,

620
00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.170
I was just like,
I know you're not supposed to say this,

621
00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:44.100
but I made it cause this is sickness in this business of like,
no man,

622
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.750
if you think you made it and then then you're going to relax.
Yeah.

623
00:35:46.751 --> 00:35:49.980
And it's all going to go away.
So like,
oh so I'm never going to be happy.

624
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.910
I tell Dick Jokes and I just bought a house.
I made it.

625
00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:00.060
<v 0>Yeah.
So
I didn't want to,
um,</v>

626
00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:04.640
<v 2>I didn't want to be that guy that is doing well.
It's like,</v>

627
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:08.290
oh well what about the next thing?
Like the,
those,
those debt,
that sickness.

628
00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:13.280
Just the Greyhound chasing the rabbit.
The rabbit.
Yeah.
Performance or driven.

629
00:36:13.281 --> 00:36:15.680
People can have this sickness of like,
it's just,
you know,

630
00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:18.680
it's just like you can't even enjoy it.
It's like what's the next thing?

631
00:36:18.681 --> 00:36:22.890
I mean I know guys that like they have like they accomplish something and as

632
00:36:22.891 --> 00:36:25.340
their,
right as they're getting right to the peak,

633
00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:29.060
this depression hits them cause they were like,
then what?

634
00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.850
And then what am I going to do?
And then this is over.
And then,

635
00:36:31.851 --> 00:36:33.800
then I got nothing and blah,
blah,
blah.
It's like,
Hey,

636
00:36:33.801 --> 00:36:37.770
can you just fucking have a beer up here with like,
we did this,
you know,

637
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:40.520
can we enjoy this for a second?
Did you keep,

638
00:36:40.521 --> 00:36:44.360
did you continue doing therapy after those initial sessions that you mentioned?

639
00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:47.530
I did it for a few years and then one day it just dawned on me that I just kind

640
00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:50.210
of just talking in circles in here and it's just like,

641
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:53.960
bad shit's going to always happen to me and what am I going to keep coming in

642
00:36:53.961 --> 00:36:55.250
here?
And I'm moaning about it.
Like,

643
00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:59.330
what point am I going to grow up and kind of not need,
not need this?

644
00:36:59.331 --> 00:37:01.040
And I'm not trying to say that you're weak if you go there,

645
00:37:01.041 --> 00:37:05.450
but I just hit this point where,
uh,
I was,

646
00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:10.070
I was like,
hi.
You know,
all of that shit happened.

647
00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:15.350
You know,
it happened,
right?
And it definitely affected who I am.

648
00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:20.060
But now I'm not going to be like lashing out of people.
I'll be like,
oh,

649
00:37:20.061 --> 00:37:24.080
I do this because of that.
A little,
a little bit of that.
But I what I did,

650
00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:24.561
you know,

651
00:37:24.561 --> 00:37:26.780
at some point it'd be like if somebody is teaching you how to fix a car,

652
00:37:26.781 --> 00:37:29.330
at some point you got to try to fix it yourself.
Right.
You know what I mean?

653
00:37:29.331 --> 00:37:32.180
You can't keep going into the annoyed turn right here.
What,
how I do this.
Right.

654
00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.860
So I just became like that.
So now I kind of,
um,
you know,

655
00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.280
I kind of self therapy myself.
It's cheaper.

656
00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.030
So you mentioned the,
uh,

657
00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:49.040
I guess delusion maybe if always chasing the next thing and never being

658
00:37:49.041 --> 00:37:50.180
satisfied with where you are.

659
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:54.440
The other worry that I've heard a lot from friends of mine who are comedians is

660
00:37:54.441 --> 00:37:59.441
that if they do therapy or meditation or fill in the blank to tone down some of

661
00:38:01.581 --> 00:38:03.920
their tendencies,
that it will make them less funny.
Yeah.

662
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:06.890
Is that something he thought that was true?
Now,
it's not true,

663
00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:10.670
but what it does is it gives you an insight into you as a human and then you

664
00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:15.700
start,
you see people differently.
And it actually allowed me to,
um,

665
00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:16.620
right,
like,

666
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:21.670
or think about characters and just notice shit with people that I never did

667
00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:26.240
before.
Like I gotta I gotta thing with somebody who,
somebody,

668
00:38:26.241 --> 00:38:29.930
anybody who does this,
when they're talking like I wasn't blah,
blah,
blah,

669
00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:30.773
they're full of shit.

670
00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:36.220
<v 0>Not only,
not only</v>

671
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.160
<v 2>are they full of shit,</v>

672
00:38:37.161 --> 00:38:41.620
they have a complete inability to accept responsibility for anything they've

673
00:38:41.621 --> 00:38:45.500
ever done.
I just recently told this to Jim Norton.
Um,

674
00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:51.240
it was that publicist who backed over like those 12 people in like long island.

675
00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:52.790
And then I remember she just,

676
00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:56.290
she drove away and then she went to her house when she got to our house,

677
00:38:56.291 --> 00:39:01.291
like the cops showed up and the lawyer met them in the driveway and was like,

678
00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:06.040
um,
yeah,
she'll come down tomorrow and blah,
blah,
blah.
And they left.

679
00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:08.320
And I remember thinking like,
you can fucking do that.

680
00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:09.700
I didn't know he could do that.

681
00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.660
So she was of course vilified and in the next day in the paper,

682
00:39:13.661 --> 00:39:15.940
they had this picture of her and she was like talking to the meeting.

683
00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.100
She was like,
Eh,
she had her hand like that.

684
00:39:18.101 --> 00:39:21.940
It's like you fucking backed over 11 people.
I'll go with you that,

685
00:39:21.941 --> 00:39:26.710
that can happen,
that you can't see that but you left.
You fucking left.

686
00:39:26.711 --> 00:39:31.030
Yeah,
get the fuck Outta here.
So I've noticed that and I remember,

687
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:34.050
so you start picking up on that.

688
00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:37.600
I remember what time this comic did some passive aggressive shit to him.

689
00:39:37.601 --> 00:39:40.780
I called him out on and he immediately went with the two hands,
the chest.

690
00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:44.140
I'm like,
that's the kind of guy that went back over 11 people and drive away.

691
00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:47.890
So I wouldn't have noticed that if I didn't go to therapy.

692
00:39:47.891 --> 00:39:51.760
And I've also noticed like,
um,
you know,
like,
I like,
yeah,

693
00:39:51.761 --> 00:39:55.690
I talked to myself a lot about like going,
you know,

694
00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:58.810
like getting into it with people and screaming and yelling and then I'll drive

695
00:39:58.811 --> 00:40:00.910
away and be like,
Hi Bill,
how did that go?
You know,

696
00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:04.570
and then try to see how they are.
How you know,
if I was wrong in it,

697
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:09.970
like they will write,
you know,
that's somebody's mom.
You just yelled at her like,

698
00:40:09.971 --> 00:40:12.280
what's wrong with you?
You're like,
I really had like a,

699
00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:16.360
like really a hair trigger kind of thing.
So it's something that um,
you know,

700
00:40:16.361 --> 00:40:20.520
working on my temper,
I really try to,
I really like,

701
00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:22.080
especially lately because you know,

702
00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:27.040
I was making my wife like on pins and needles because it wasn't like I was

703
00:40:27.041 --> 00:40:30.640
flipping out over anything.
Like I fucking hate these things,
whatever.
This,

704
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:33.550
the second it came out and I saw this,
whatever,
this is,
this pad,

705
00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:38.050
I bet I hate these.
I hate these six.
I can't stand them.

706
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:41.020
They don't make my life easier.
If they're a nightmare,
they're intrusive,

707
00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:46.570
you know,
and my,
I can't stand.
So I flip out about them and like,

708
00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:48.880
um,
I saw,

709
00:40:48.881 --> 00:40:52.210
I think recently this politically active comedian was sitting there talking.

710
00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:56.290
It was trying to get people to vote and like this oddly like bullying way going

711
00:40:56.291 --> 00:40:59.260
like,
you know this is going to be an app out there that's going to say,

712
00:40:59.261 --> 00:41:03.070
you know whether you voted or not and they're not going to know whether you

713
00:41:03.071 --> 00:41:04.450
voted and who you voted for,

714
00:41:04.451 --> 00:41:08.200
but they're going to know that you voted so you can't basically bullshit people

715
00:41:08.201 --> 00:41:08.830
anymore.

716
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:12.190
I just was watching it the whole time going and like that's a good thing that

717
00:41:12.191 --> 00:41:15.400
that level of private information because of this fucking APP.
I didn't say that.

718
00:41:15.401 --> 00:41:17.410
You could say what I bought it or not.
That's what I,

719
00:41:17.411 --> 00:41:22.220
that's what I hate about all of this shit.
Like I have a theory like,

720
00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:27.130
like somewhere around 94 95 we should,
we should have stopped making new shit.

721
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:31.660
All they could,
they cured enough diseases.

722
00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:34.830
Cards were fast enough you could gain,

723
00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:38.150
no planes aren't any really faster than they were back then.
It was good.

724
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:42.980
But all of this shit now that like,
you know,
tape your cameras.
Yeah,

725
00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:46.070
tape your cabin and stuff.
Look at Billy Bush.

726
00:41:46.071 --> 00:41:50.130
Billy Bush got fired for some shit that happened in 2005 yeah,

727
00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:53.630
this is fucking unbelievable.
And all he was doing as what an interview or does,

728
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:58.430
he was keeping the interviewee happy.
Right.
The Guy,
I go,
I just grab the pussy.

729
00:41:58.431 --> 00:41:59.750
He's like,
Hey,
I grabbed some pussy.

730
00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:03.190
<v 5>What are we doing this for all you know,</v>

731
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:06.820
<v 2>the end of the interview when Trump left,
he could have been like,
what was it?</v>

732
00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.640
What's that guy like?
I think I was out of his mind.

733
00:42:08.641 --> 00:42:09.690
He's talking about grabbing pussy.

734
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:12.980
<v 5>She's fucking crazy.
Anyways,
who do we got next?</v>

735
00:42:12.981 --> 00:42:15.800
Matthew mcconaughey are at arrive.
What's going on?
You know,

736
00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:18.570
it's just doing that for all you know.
That's

737
00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:20.850
<v 2>all he was doing and it was literally like,</v>

738
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.760
that's what I hate about this shit is like you'd literally take two seconds and

739
00:42:23.761 --> 00:42:26.930
somebody fucking life and you're like,
that's who you are.
That's you.

740
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.480
That that tweak is who you are.
That's what's in your heart and all of this shit.

741
00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:34.470
I could,
friends of mine,
they've gotten like big shows,
SNL and stuff like that.

742
00:42:34.471 --> 00:42:35.610
I think the one person,
they,

743
00:42:35.611 --> 00:42:40.190
they go back to 2010 they went through six years of tweets to try and four,

744
00:42:40.191 --> 00:42:43.140
we'll,
we'll,
we'll,
what was about this one?
Yeah.
It's like,

745
00:42:43.141 --> 00:42:44.570
get the fuck Outta here.
Right?

746
00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:51.120
Why didn't you start doing the podcast,
I guess?
Uh,
Bobby Kelly,
once again,

747
00:42:51.121 --> 00:42:52.480
I was hanging in his apartment when we,

748
00:42:52.481 --> 00:42:55.650
we used to live near each other in New York and he was just like,
dude,

749
00:42:55.651 --> 00:42:58.440
you got to do this.
This is called the podcast.
I had no idea what it was.

750
00:42:58.441 --> 00:43:00.570
You can say,
you know,
it's another way to connect with your fans.

751
00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.440
And both me and M and all of my friends,
we,

752
00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:07.110
we weren't the guys they were picking.
Yeah.
We just weren't the guys,

753
00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:11.430
we weren't whatever they were going forward that we just never were the guys and

754
00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:13.680
you know,
and yet we,
they all,
I be showcased,

755
00:43:13.681 --> 00:43:17.180
they'd always put us on last because we would,
you know,
we,

756
00:43:17.181 --> 00:43:21.060
we were really good at what we did,
but there was always like the,
you know,

757
00:43:21.061 --> 00:43:22.950
whatever the hell it was they were looking for.
We were just,

758
00:43:22.951 --> 00:43:27.090
we were the outcasts.
So,
um,
so any way to connect with your fans,

759
00:43:27.091 --> 00:43:30.990
we had to do it and that was this new thing.
And I just liked doing it.

760
00:43:30.991 --> 00:43:31.824
And at first I just,

761
00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:35.370
I used to call it used to before I had like all the mixer and all that used to

762
00:43:35.371 --> 00:43:36.630
call in this,
this service.

763
00:43:36.631 --> 00:43:41.050
So I would just call up this phone number on my flip phone and I would just have

764
00:43:41.051 --> 00:43:44.670
me be an airports and I would just be trashed and people and telling stories and

765
00:43:44.671 --> 00:43:47.430
singing songs.
And at first I just did it for like seven minutes,

766
00:43:47.431 --> 00:43:50.460
then it was 10 minutes,
then it became 20 than a half hour.

767
00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:53.350
And then I started going like,
well,
you know,
yeah,
you know,

768
00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:56.040
ask me some questions or I had this thing underrated,

769
00:43:56.041 --> 00:43:59.100
overrated for a while and youtube video of the week.

770
00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:01.980
And I just sort of built like a show around it.
And um,

771
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.110
and it just kind of became what it became.

772
00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:07.380
Was it for shits and giggles or was there something,
no,
I want,

773
00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:10.350
I want it to connect with fans.
You know,
it was a way to just,

774
00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:14.670
just another thing to do.
And um,
but it was also,
uh,

775
00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:19.710
I enjoyed it because there's other ways to connect with fans that I don't enjoy.

776
00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:24.250
Like all those,
um,
those things you guys when you upload your pictures,
yeah,

777
00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:26.850
I don't like those cause it says can we have access to,

778
00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.830
to all your photos and it's like,
no,

779
00:44:28.831 --> 00:44:32.760
you can have access to this photo so I don't do it,

780
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.450
you know,
so I just
don't do any of those.

781
00:44:35.451 --> 00:44:37.580
But then there's other stuff that like this is the same thing.

782
00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:38.990
It's like the mall thing again,

783
00:44:38.991 --> 00:44:42.680
like does this fit into the wheelhouse of what I feel like I want to do and was

784
00:44:42.681 --> 00:44:46.310
just something I liked doing.
So I just started doing it.
So between,

785
00:44:46.311 --> 00:44:50.180
or I should say during the period of your specials and then getting all the way

786
00:44:50.181 --> 00:44:53.720
to f is for family,
what were the,

787
00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:57.860
what were the high points for you in that?
That entire thing?
The other question,

788
00:44:57.861 --> 00:45:01.650
I didn't hurt that person.
Grown and out there like,
ah,
sorry,
sorry,

789
00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:05.360
we're getting down to the question.
Let's just see minus question.
Bear with me.

790
00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:05.601
No,

791
00:45:05.601 --> 00:45:09.260
I think I'm working on my material I think is acid as hardened from sitting down

792
00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:17.600
so
we can,
we can go around.
Okay.
Here we go.

793
00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:19.791
So from the,

794
00:45:19.791 --> 00:45:22.970
from the point that you started doing your specialist up to f is for family,

795
00:45:22.971 --> 00:45:27.971
were there any particular inflection points or experiences that set you on the

796
00:45:29.451 --> 00:45:33.140
path that led you to where you are?
Formative experiences.

797
00:45:33.141 --> 00:45:35.310
You don't think of Chappelle's show like breaking bad.
I mean you,

798
00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:37.340
you have so much that you've done.

799
00:45:37.341 --> 00:45:40.700
I'm just wondering if any stand out influenced my comedy or it just got me to

800
00:45:40.701 --> 00:45:45.200
where I'm at both either.
All right.
Well getting me to where I'm at is like,

801
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:49.820
you know how long it took me to make.
It is like,
it's a bunch of people.

802
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:52.850
It's comics that I saw when I was in Boston.

803
00:45:52.851 --> 00:45:57.680
People who gave me shots I'm getting in at the comic strip was a woman,

804
00:45:57.681 --> 00:46:02.000
Amanda Schatz at MTV.
She saw me and Boston and then she was like,
I want you to,

805
00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:05.270
I want to see you in New York.
And I couldn't get in at the comic strip.

806
00:46:05.271 --> 00:46:08.250
I remember Ellucian going and I already have enough white guys,
blah,
blah,
blah,

807
00:46:08.251 --> 00:46:09.280
blah,
blah,
blah.
And I remember,

808
00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:11.820
I remember all these white guys used to get mad about this,

809
00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:14.500
like reverse racism and they want to say all this type of shit.

810
00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.080
And it's just like,
dude,
you know what he's saying?
There's like,

811
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:20.740
it's not even a dime a dozen.
There's like,
we're a dime per 60 of us,

812
00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:23.410
but if you're going to be another asshole coming in here talking about you

813
00:46:23.411 --> 00:46:27.680
called the sac life,
he already has that.
So,
you know,

814
00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:30.040
stop being a baby about it,
right?

815
00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:33.600
Everything else is gravy for you as a white dude.
So,
um,

816
00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:38.630
so I basically was like,
I remember thinking like,
all right,
this guy's,
oh,

817
00:46:38.631 --> 00:46:41.110
I'm going to get in here.
I'm,
I don't know how,
but I'm going to get in here.

818
00:46:41.111 --> 00:46:45.400
And she saw me.
And so she hooked me up with the showcase there.
Somehow I did.

819
00:46:45.401 --> 00:46:49.800
Well,
I got passed there,
which led me to get into New York and then,
um,

820
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:51.580
through New York.
Just be in there.

821
00:46:51.581 --> 00:46:54.040
I remember Dave Chappelle said some nice things to me one night.

822
00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:57.220
I'm saying that basically a,

823
00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:00.130
you're going to get there but the road that you're going is going to take
longer,

824
00:47:00.131 --> 00:47:03.370
but when you,
when you get there,
you're going to have that stay in thing.

825
00:47:03.371 --> 00:47:07.340
And I held onto that for years and when I would be playing some shit hole,

826
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:11.920
I was just like,
but Dave Chappelle said,
you know,
um,
but then it would just,

827
00:47:11.921 --> 00:47:15.620
you know,
a lot of radio guys,
um,
uh,
Jim Norton get me in with opiate.

828
00:47:15.621 --> 00:47:18.790
Anthea was huge.
Randy Bauman and Pittsburgh.

829
00:47:18.791 --> 00:47:23.791
Cause like I would go to these markets and the guys that I really vibe with,

830
00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:26.300
like they would give me the option to be like,
hey,

831
00:47:26.301 --> 00:47:29.800
and rather than flying in Thursday morning for your through Sunday,

832
00:47:29.801 --> 00:47:34.660
if you want to fly in Wednesday or Tuesday and just do radio the whole week,

833
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:37.600
um,
you know,
I'll help you pack the place.

834
00:47:37.601 --> 00:47:40.660
And guys like Randy bombing in Pittsburgh and I would do that.

835
00:47:40.661 --> 00:47:44.170
I would just come in,
have no shows Tuesday,
Wednesday,

836
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:47.470
and I would just do four hours of radio in the morning and do the whole morning

837
00:47:47.471 --> 00:47:50.470
show and that do morning on Thursday and Friday,

838
00:47:50.471 --> 00:47:54.370
just killing as hard as I could to,
you know,
get it like half full.

839
00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:55.660
Maybe they don't have to pull the curtain.

840
00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:59.800
And it was just all those types of things.
And um,

841
00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.930
I guess,
uh,
I don't know.
I've been doing this shit for a long time,

842
00:48:04.931 --> 00:48:08.350
so I'm trying to be a breaking bad.
Breaking bad was huge because

843
00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:14.550
<v 0>forever I wanted to play a guy like</v>

844
00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:19.270
<v 2>that.
All right.
But back when I had my hair and stuff,
I look like Ron Howard.</v>

845
00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:23.590
So it was like day.
I was always the friend.
I was the nerd.

846
00:48:23.591 --> 00:48:25.240
I just wasn't going to be that guy.

847
00:48:25.241 --> 00:48:30.070
And I just always wanted to play a guy like Colby and they gave me a shot.

848
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:35.500
And,
um,
and then through that,
all of a sudden I got these other roles,
like,

849
00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:38.590
you know,
once you get it on tape and they can see that you can do it,
then like,

850
00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:41.410
oh,
we can do this and then people will take a shot on you.
So that,

851
00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:43.470
that was a huge thing.
And,
um,

852
00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:47.660
I'd say Mike binder with when I did black or white,
uh,

853
00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:51.550
which became black and white,
black.
Oh yeah,
that was,
what was it?

854
00:48:51.551 --> 00:48:53.680
It was it black and white was the original name of it,

855
00:48:53.681 --> 00:48:57.470
but somebody already owned the copyright of that and they wouldn't sell it.

856
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:59.680
So then we had to switch it to black or white.

857
00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:03.520
And it was like this trial about who should have the,
uh,

858
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.510
the rights to watch this kid that was,
was a racially mixed,

859
00:49:07.511 --> 00:49:10.930
was half white and half black.
So black and white made it seem inclusive,

860
00:49:10.931 --> 00:49:12.610
but we had to switch it to black or white.

861
00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:16.900
So it kind of became like this make a decision kind of five to it.
But he let me,

862
00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:19.070
I got to play a lawyer in that.
And,
um,

863
00:49:19.071 --> 00:49:20.830
he had all these great dramatic scenes and all that.

864
00:49:20.831 --> 00:49:24.580
So now I Kinda got a nice like acting thing going on where I get to do some

865
00:49:24.581 --> 00:49:27.430
drama stuff.
I get to do some comedy stuff.
So it's been cool.
Yeah.

866
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.823
<v 0>Okay.</v>

867
00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:35.870
<v 2>Speaking of Cosmo magazine,
uh,
this,
uh,
next question is from Marcus Harbough.</v>

868
00:49:35.871 --> 00:49:37.480
I think as I said also from Facebook,

869
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:43.010
my wife thinks he's hilarious and she's generally not a fan of pro male types of

870
00:49:43.011 --> 00:49:43.844
comedy.

871
00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:47.600
How did he learn to so expertly delivered that kind of humor without alienating

872
00:49:47.601 --> 00:49:50.450
his female audience?
I alienated a lot of females.

873
00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:56.360
I do,
I ate,
I alienated issue people.

874
00:49:56.390 --> 00:50:00.290
I alienated politically correct people.
Like they got like that thing where like,

875
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:01.550
you know,
this is the issue.

876
00:50:01.551 --> 00:50:04.430
You're only allowed to have this thought on this issue.

877
00:50:04.431 --> 00:50:08.570
I have zero sense of humor about this issue.
These are all the proper words.

878
00:50:08.571 --> 00:50:12.140
These are all the,
if you use these bad,
if use these words,
this,
you're this.

879
00:50:12.141 --> 00:50:13.670
If you use that,
they're very like,

880
00:50:13.671 --> 00:50:18.410
it's hilarious cause they're progressive left using the exact same like Fox News

881
00:50:18.411 --> 00:50:22.430
extreme right.
Did the exact same fucking lunatics.
I hate him.

882
00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:23.750
I hate progressive left people.

883
00:50:23.751 --> 00:50:27.020
And I generally speaking and the Fox News to the right that taken our,

884
00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:32.750
those people,
those,
I can't even listen to them.
They're idiots.

885
00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.160
Yeah.
They're like

886
00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:39.180
<v 5>both of them and they both have
both of them.</v>

887
00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:42.040
<v 2>Heart is in the right place.
They just,</v>

888
00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:46.000
they're not doing it and they're doing it in this very stolen esque kind of way

889
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:49.140
of zero tolerance.
Oh yeah.
Um,

890
00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:53.650
and what's funny to me is the right always gets that the left just cannot see

891
00:50:53.651 --> 00:50:54.401
when they're doing it.

892
00:50:54.401 --> 00:50:57.760
It's like you've become what the fuck you're fighting and you're annoying.

893
00:50:58.450 --> 00:51:01.900
You're annoying.
So I mean,
I think that explains,
you know,

894
00:51:01.901 --> 00:51:06.730
a little bit of the Trump shit,
like how that guy kind of came up with,

895
00:51:06.731 --> 00:51:10.060
it's like you guys were ramming this shit down.
Like what's this is,

896
00:51:10.170 --> 00:51:10.991
this is so fucked up.

897
00:51:10.991 --> 00:51:15.130
If you just look at politics like Obama was a response to eight years of the

898
00:51:15.131 --> 00:51:17.140
Bush people ramming it down your throat.

899
00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:21.040
And he was response to eight years of Clinton people ramming it down their

900
00:51:21.041 --> 00:51:24.010
throats.
And then 12 years before that,
yet Reagan and Bush,

901
00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:29.070
both sides just can't present their shit.
They gotta be like fucking,
Ooh,
eh.

902
00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:33.280
<v 5>You know,
and it's all it does,
is it?
It causes</v>

903
00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:34.940
<v 2>resentment and the,
if you look,</v>

904
00:51:34.941 --> 00:51:39.941
the pendulum just keeps swinging like further and further and people sound

905
00:51:39.951 --> 00:51:42.800
fucking right now.
People sound crazy to me.

906
00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:46.030
<v 5>The side that I can't watch it.</v>

907
00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:50.820
It's like if anybody,
if anything,

908
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:54.500
<v 2>but are you in the left gets in.
It's like,
it's going to be socialism.</v>

909
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:58.370
This is going to be like communist Russia.
And if anybody right gets in,

910
00:51:58.371 --> 00:52:03.110
it's like,
this is like Germany in 1935 every fucking time.
Just,

911
00:52:03.111 --> 00:52:06.350
just go and just go and like this.
So I don't know,

912
00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:09.770
like I just tried to just be like,
all right,
let's settle down.

913
00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:13.010
Everybody fucking relaxed.
Get yourself sandwich.

914
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.330
Some of these things could be true,
some of them might not be true,

915
00:52:19.331 --> 00:52:21.150
but like getting into this,
Eh,
Eh,

916
00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:26.530
you're not going to be able to think clearly and be able to make the right move

917
00:52:26.531 --> 00:52:28.930
when you have to.
I,
I guess.
So what was it?

918
00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:32.950
Do you deliberately at times tried to lose the audience?

919
00:52:32.951 --> 00:52:37.570
Like push them to the breaking point and like there was something that I I and

920
00:52:37.571 --> 00:52:38.590
then reel them back.
I mean,

921
00:52:38.591 --> 00:52:43.120
is that what I used to do that was from playing hell rooms and no one would

922
00:52:43.121 --> 00:52:43.481
listen.

923
00:52:43.481 --> 00:52:48.070
So what I would do is I would make a statement that would make people be like,

924
00:52:48.071 --> 00:52:48.970
dude,
what the fuck?

925
00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:53.650
And thinking that I'm heading towards this thing.
Right?

926
00:52:53.651 --> 00:52:56.590
Like I would make a statement that would make anything make you feel like I'm

927
00:52:56.591 --> 00:53:01.591
heading towards like a supporting the clan or beating women or anything like

928
00:53:01.901 --> 00:53:05.380
that.
You just say that and that gets everybody to drop their fork to listen.

929
00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:07.300
They're like,
dude,
what the fuck is this?

930
00:53:07.301 --> 00:53:10.140
And then you just wind it back to the point that you wanted to make anything.

931
00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:15.070
<v 5>Oh,
all right.
Okay.
That's kind of funny.
And then you just keep doing that.</v>

932
00:53:15.850 --> 00:53:19.680
And then eventually once I,
once I had that,

933
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:22.010
<v 2>yeah,
once I had the room,</v>

934
00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:26.460
then I could just do my show and I think a little bit of that and started to

935
00:53:26.461 --> 00:53:30.190
bleed into my style.
I don't know,
mean I don't do that anymore on purpose.

936
00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:33.420
When I was coming up,
I used to do that on purpose.

937
00:53:33.421 --> 00:53:34.320
There was all these techniques.

938
00:53:34.321 --> 00:53:36.750
You could also start talking quieter if people talking louder.

939
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:38.790
People used to say that,
that never fucking worked for me,

940
00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:41.760
that not just nobody heard me.
I'm just like,
okay,
nobody's listening to my job.

941
00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:48.440
But you know,
yeah.
A lot of that came from,
um,
you know,
all the,

942
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:51.720
those crazy rooms I did and I'm very proud that I did all those and I didn't

943
00:53:51.721 --> 00:53:55.890
sidestep any of those.
Like I pretty much did all of my,
did the,
uh,

944
00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:59.910
the good Romans,
the bad room is the white rooms,
black rooms,
gay clubs.

945
00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:04.620
I did everything because I really felt that I,
I know why.

946
00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:08.960
I know why.
Just I remember this.
I,
when I was a kid,
not a kid,
um,

947
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:14.030
I was like probably 18 years old and it was the summer of 86 and Rodney

948
00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:17.040
Dangerfield lake,
great.
Rodney Dangerfield was on,
um,

949
00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:20.220
he was on tour and he came to this place,
great woods.

950
00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:23.330
Now it's called the tweeter center.
And I met him,
he came and he,

951
00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:25.990
he killed and he was hilarious and all that.
And I saw all these people there,

952
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:26.880
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

953
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:29.430
And I didn't notice that they were all white because that was white.

954
00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:32.010
So it was just like,
Oh wow,
we're all watching this guy,
whatever.
And then like,

955
00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:35.880
like a month later I saw Eddie Murphy on the raw tour.

956
00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:40.260
He had the blue leather suit,
I lawn seats.
That's how famous this dude was.

957
00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:44.280
I was sitting on the grass watching guy doing standup comedy.

958
00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:46.380
He had like the weather girls opened up for him and everything.

959
00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:48.750
And I remember that night looking around going,
wait,

960
00:54:48.751 --> 00:54:53.490
this guy's making everybody laugh.
This is the difference.
So I remembered one,
um,

961
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:56.880
getting into comedy that I,
I didn't want to be that guy,

962
00:54:57.150 --> 00:55:01.140
like being like a radio station.
Like he makes white males 18 to 35,
you know,

963
00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:04.470
like I want him to be like,
no,
this guy is funny.
But,

964
00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:09.360
but the only way to do that was to do all of those,
uh,
those different rooms.

965
00:55:09.361 --> 00:55:12.660
And I didn't,
it didn't always go well.
Um,

966
00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:15.120
like black rooms are hilarious.
Like they,

967
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:18.290
it's like the more I learned about them is they're either,

968
00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:21.390
they're having fun no matter what.
You're going to have fun with you

969
00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:25.590
<v 5>without you,
but either way they're going to have a good time.
So</v>

970
00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:29.870
that was definitely,
um,

971
00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:33.260
<v 2>those were some of my favorite shows that I ever did.</v>

972
00:55:33.261 --> 00:55:38.261
That was that there was a legendary show at this now gone comedy club that sound

973
00:55:38.551 --> 00:55:42.470
like a fucking wine bar,
which just kills me because I mean it was just the raw,

974
00:55:42.471 --> 00:55:47.260
just sick.
It's like in the village,
it was right as Giuliani was taken over,

975
00:55:47.261 --> 00:55:50.720
some people was still selling drugs out in front of him.
It was crazy.

976
00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:55.490
And I used to see like,
you know,
all these guys like young Dave Chappelle,

977
00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:59.000
Jay Mohr,
Ali's bread,
Johnny in the Round Guy,
all these guys just stick,

978
00:55:59.001 --> 00:56:02.450
just murdering in there.
But Sunday night was,
was the uptown show,

979
00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:05.660
cause they wouldn't say,
you know,
the black only show,
I guess.

980
00:56:05.661 --> 00:56:10.520
So they would say the uptown show and this guy,
uh,
um,
talent and,

981
00:56:10.521 --> 00:56:12.830
and we'll still,
Vince used to host that show.

982
00:56:12.831 --> 00:56:16.610
And that for me that was the show.
Like to this day,

983
00:56:16.611 --> 00:56:20.720
like that was the most fun show I ever did was when,

984
00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:24.250
when you killed on that show dude,
it was like you walked out of that,

985
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:25.420
why am I not famous shift?

986
00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:28.840
Like that's how hard it was just everyone was on top of you.

987
00:56:28.841 --> 00:56:33.280
It was the greatest ever.
But when you bombed it was just like,

988
00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:36.940
why did I ever think I was funny?
I should have opened the hardware store.

989
00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:41.180
You would just leave like the j those are some rough nights.

990
00:56:41.181 --> 00:56:42.500
So going back to the,
uh,

991
00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:47.320
technically one bedroom that was really a studio and getting under the Futon

992
00:56:47.321 --> 00:56:51.460
just laying there.
Yeah.
A lot of grunt and Groan in the next day in the shower.

993
00:56:51.461 --> 00:56:53.860
Like Ah,
God I hate myself.
You know.

994
00:56:56.980 --> 00:57:01.030
What piece of advice would you give your 25 year old self?
Oh,

995
00:57:01.031 --> 00:57:03.700
I hate that question.
Why are we saying,

996
00:57:03.701 --> 00:57:06.130
if you could go back and tell yourself what you know now,

997
00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:11.740
what did you dislike about your 25 year old self?
If you prefer that question.

998
00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:17.560
Um,
what did I dislike?
No,

999
00:57:17.561 --> 00:57:21.610
I definitely felt like a freak back then.
I definitely did not feel,

1000
00:57:21.611 --> 00:57:25.690
I never felt like I fit in anywhere until I went to a comedy club and just

1001
00:57:25.691 --> 00:57:28.000
seeing all the comics and I was just like,
these,

1002
00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:31.330
these people are the same kind of crazy than I am.
You know what I mean?

1003
00:57:31.331 --> 00:57:33.430
Like everybody's out of their mind.
But like they,

1004
00:57:33.431 --> 00:57:38.250
there was a specific way that they were nuts that like,
I just felt like,
yeah,

1005
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:40.690
we just meet him.
Like I like,
I,
it's like I know this person,

1006
00:57:40.691 --> 00:57:45.280
but I don't know them.
Like they,
it just felt like I'm in a weird way.

1007
00:57:45.281 --> 00:57:46.930
Like you were going home.
It was crazy.

1008
00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:50.030
But as far as like what I would tell myself,
um,

1009
00:57:51.850 --> 00:57:56.560
I would be afraid to fuck it up cause it ended up so well,
you know,

1010
00:57:56.561 --> 00:57:59.380
it's like that,
uh,
back to the school.
But back to the future,

1011
00:57:59.381 --> 00:58:01.090
whatever the hell it's called,
um,

1012
00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:04.210
I always mess up the name of movies back to the future where it,

1013
00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:07.720
you change one thing and you know,
seeing all your mom wants to fuck Yo.

1014
00:58:07.721 --> 00:58:08.554
However that happened.

1015
00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:12.910
Wasn't that one of the storylines?

1016
00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:17.620
Calvin [inaudible] kill good family movie.

1017
00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:22.450
The mom wants to bang her son from the future.
Oh,
it's great for their kids.

1018
00:58:22.451 --> 00:58:23.530
It was wonderful.

1019
00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:27.573
How old are you now?

1020
00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:33.030
48 what do you think your 60 year old self would tell your current self?

1021
00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:36.940
Twice.
Some apartment buildings by some apartment though.
Yes,

1022
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:38.910
because you're going to be,
I,
you know,

1023
00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:42.430
I know I want to do stuff like that because I want to,
when I'm 70,

1024
00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:47.470
I want to leave if I want to,
I probably won't because I love doing it so much,

1025
00:58:47.471 --> 00:58:52.360
but I don't want to be that guy in that mustard stain Tuxedo suit.
Just still,

1026
00:58:52.410 --> 00:58:55.990
he knows the numbers start going down the back nine.
And I'm like,
Oh,

1027
00:58:55.991 --> 00:58:59.440
you have things to say.
You know,
it's just people going like,
oh,

1028
00:58:59.441 --> 00:59:02.290
I saw him in front of like three people.
It was sad.

1029
00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:06.070
There was a donut making sheikh machine in the back.

1030
00:59:06.071 --> 00:59:09.400
I gotta go back to those gigs.
So I would like to,
uh,

1031
00:59:10.090 --> 00:59:13.360
not go out and,
you know,
I'm doing real well.
I'm making great money.

1032
00:59:13.361 --> 00:59:16.300
I would like to not go out and buy a bunch of dumb shiny shit.

1033
00:59:16.301 --> 00:59:20.860
I would like to buy shit like assets.
So I have money.
So my,
my next goal,

1034
00:59:20.861 --> 00:59:24.200
the same way I did the thing where I never got sucked so far into this business

1035
00:59:24.201 --> 00:59:28.750
where I do apologize if I was,
even if I wasn't sorry,
I,
um,

1036
00:59:29.330 --> 00:59:33.050
I now want to get the money that making this business to make money outside of

1037
00:59:33.051 --> 00:59:36.930
the business.
So because eventually this business is done with you.
Yeah.

1038
00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:41.060
It just is.
And you have to realize he got to deal with that shit.
So like,

1039
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:44.480
I would just love to be,
to be honest with you,
man,
if I could just,
you know,

1040
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:49.030
making a decent amount of money off of shit like that.
Yeah.

1041
00:59:49.050 --> 00:59:52.640
Just always picture myself just sitting on the back porch,
you know,
with a dog,

1042
00:59:52.641 --> 00:59:56.100
not giving a shit,
smoking a cigar.
Like that's how I want to,
what kind of stuff?

1043
00:59:56.101 --> 00:59:58.630
We still do stuff.
Uh,
oh,

1044
00:59:59.090 --> 01:00:01.460
they don't mess them up with global warming.

1045
01:00:01.461 --> 01:00:04.850
If he can still make a great one to definitely be a Cuban.
Um,

1046
01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:09.260
probably a reboot.
Stow the Cohibas I like,

1047
01:00:09.261 --> 01:00:11.360
I like the part of this.
I just smoke when recently,

1048
01:00:11.361 --> 01:00:14.050
I don't even know the name of it was one of the sickest cigars I uh,

1049
01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:17.520
I've ever smoked,
but it was like,
it was like a two hour smoke in a,

1050
01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:21.980
I absolutely love cigars,
but like,
you know,

1051
01:00:21.981 --> 01:00:25.940
there is a thing amongst cigar smokers where like if someone comes nosing
around,

1052
01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:29.180
you know,
if you break up,
you bust out like a box of cigars at a party,

1053
01:00:29.181 --> 01:00:32.840
all these fucking phoneys will come up.
Oh you want to go?
You smoke goes,
oh yeah,

1054
01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:36.740
I smoke cigars and you'll learn this one time you'll give out your cigars to

1055
01:00:36.741 --> 01:00:39.620
them and then what kills you is you'll look over like a half hour later and the

1056
01:00:39.621 --> 01:00:42.240
things like halfway smoked and they already asked the thing out of this now

1057
01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:46.580
snubbed the thing out.
And I learned that.
So I got a Bobby Kelly,

1058
01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.890
I shouldn't out him here.
I shouldn't have said his name.
He had surgery,

1059
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:54.920
he has to fix it in post.
He has two humidors.
He's got the real shit.

1060
01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:58.430
And then he's got his bullshit.
So somebody comes over and be like,

1061
01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:00.560
so he just gave you like cigars?
Oh yeah.
What kind of,

1062
01:01:00.561 --> 01:01:03.590
what kind do you like it if they're just saying bullshit,
I got one for Ya.

1063
01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:08.890
I got one,
I wanted a carnival,
here you go.
So,

1064
01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:13.130
but I really like,
um,
smoking a cigar is a sacred thing to me.

1065
01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:16.910
Like if I have a great cigar,
like sometimes if there's no place to smoke,

1066
01:01:16.911 --> 01:01:20.140
I will not smoke it.
Like I'm not going to be this asshole,
these fucking,

1067
01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.610
a couple of my friends,
their animals,
they'll stand next to a dumpster.

1068
01:01:22.611 --> 01:01:27.530
Like it's not as cigarette smokers are animals.
They're like,
they're on the shit.

1069
01:01:27.531 --> 01:01:27.771
Right?

1070
01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:31.530
So there'll be in an alley they don't care fucking rat running by and they're

1071
01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:34.680
out there smoking,
catching pneumonia.
They're analysts.

1072
01:01:36.490 --> 01:01:39.280
Cigar smoking is a gentleman thing.
It's like,
it's some,

1073
01:01:39.370 --> 01:01:43.070
it's some brilliance in adult thing.
And so it's just like,

1074
01:01:43.071 --> 01:01:45.890
I want to be with people that I love telling stories,

1075
01:01:45.891 --> 01:01:49.700
hanging out and like the right,
the right everything.
And then,

1076
01:01:49.701 --> 01:01:52.850
and then even if you're doing it by yourself,
it's like you have to have,

1077
01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:57.110
I'm never doing this.
Like,
well can I,
can I smoke it before?
Blah Blah Blah.

1078
01:01:57.140 --> 01:02:00.500
It's like I would just want to have nothing and I just sit there in that great

1079
01:02:00.501 --> 01:02:04.700
guy thing that my wife could not understand is just being able to be a guy and

1080
01:02:04.701 --> 01:02:06.350
just be not thinking about shit.

1081
01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:09.650
I'll just be sitting there just enjoying yourself.

1082
01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.450
Next question's from sharpie sharp.
Uh,

1083
01:02:14.451 --> 01:02:17.430
I would like to see that birth certificate.
This is from Facebook.
Uh,

1084
01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:22.560
what's the best heckle that's been thrown your way or most memorable?

1085
01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:27.790
There's too many men.
Um,
all right,

1086
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:31.590
well we'll go around.
We'll go around the,
uh,

1087
01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:36.060
all right.
When I was black room,
best one I ever got,

1088
01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:39.540
I was bombing at this place,
used to be called mixed nuts.

1089
01:02:39.541 --> 01:02:43.830
It's now called the comedy union mix.
And I was up there and do,

1090
01:02:43.831 --> 01:02:47.580
when I tell you five minutes to straight silence,
dry mouth,
nothing.

1091
01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:51.720
And it was the summertime when sound carries,
right?
And I am just

1092
01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:55.350
going and going and it's nothing and nothing.

1093
01:02:55.410 --> 01:02:57.360
And then just in the middle of one of my jokes,

1094
01:02:57.390 --> 01:03:02.190
a meandering in this long set up for something else that's going to bomb big

1095
01:03:02.191 --> 01:03:03.150
black lady in the back,

1096
01:03:03.151 --> 01:03:07.320
just out loud to nobody just sort of looked around this way.
I laughed yet

1097
01:03:09.050 --> 01:03:14.050
<v 5>and the whole place exploded laughing and I didn't know how to deal with it.</v>

1098
01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:18.530
I didn't know I had to address it.

1099
01:03:18.531 --> 01:03:23.120
I kept trying to do my material and then they were just laughing at me trying to

1100
01:03:23.121 --> 01:03:25.280
do,
man,
it was fucking humiliating.

1101
01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:34.770
<v 2>I Dunno,
there's one,
uh,
I'll tell you the weirdest one.</v>

1102
01:03:34.771 --> 01:03:38.610
I got,
um,
I've told this one before,
one of the weirdest ones I got,

1103
01:03:38.611 --> 01:03:43.380
I was a danger fields and doing the midnight show and it was just one of those

1104
01:03:43.381 --> 01:03:47.640
nights everybody was bombing in place was packed and nobody was laughing.

1105
01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:49.680
I remember the guy in front of me,

1106
01:03:49.681 --> 01:03:54.681
like he was just bombing so bad and he was in on some show where he played a

1107
01:03:55.471 --> 01:03:58.540
bartender and he had gotten beaten up.
It's like,
Oh yeah,

1108
01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:00.900
you guys see that movie he's trying to get,
you got to see this movie,
Blah Blah,

1109
01:04:00.901 --> 01:04:04.170
blah,
blah.
He goes,
yeah,
I played the bartender,
the,
you know,
the,
the,

1110
01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.960
the star of the movie,
beat the s,
you know,
beat the shit out of me.

1111
01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:09.180
You guys see that?
And then some kitting it back just goes,

1112
01:04:09.450 --> 01:04:10.290
he should have killed you.

1113
01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:13.373
<v 5>So</v>

1114
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:16.360
<v 2>it's like,
oh for that guy walked past me,
never even looked at me.
He just,</v>

1115
01:04:16.361 --> 01:04:18.940
when he got off stage you can set this flop sweat and just walk by me,

1116
01:04:18.941 --> 01:04:23.020
just gone file.
Wow.
And then I went on stage,

1117
01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:27.550
immediately bombing and there was this group of kids in the corner,

1118
01:04:27.551 --> 01:04:30.280
these white dudes and they would just like just ready for a fight.

1119
01:04:30.281 --> 01:04:32.260
They were just super fucking hot set that whole,

1120
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:36.430
my dad used to beat the shit out of me vibe and everything I had learned up to

1121
01:04:36.431 --> 01:04:39.310
that point was like,
Bill,
don't get into it with them.

1122
01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:42.400
I heard them talking and I was like,
don't say anything.
Don't say anything.

1123
01:04:42.401 --> 01:04:45.700
And then finally I just,
that's fucking thing when you're on stage as a comic,

1124
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:47.080
you think like this,

1125
01:04:47.081 --> 01:04:50.200
and this is like some sort of like a fucking gun and bullets,
but it isn't.

1126
01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:53.980
It's just plastic shit.
And I just like,
I finally said,
I'll go,
hey,
you know what?

1127
01:04:53.981 --> 01:04:57.040
What's going on over there?
What do you,
what are you guys talking about?
Blah,

1128
01:04:57.041 --> 01:04:58.020
blah,
blah.
I can't remember what to say.

1129
01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:02.590
And this guy just finally it was just yelled out,
you know,
I had the beat goes,

1130
01:05:02.591 --> 01:05:06.730
anything that gives yells out,
he goes,
anything red in onstage is a faggot.

1131
01:05:07.660 --> 01:05:08.493
Right?

1132
01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:12.790
And it was the most childish Haeckel I ever got this back when like people

1133
01:05:12.791 --> 01:05:15.010
didn't freak out about that word.
You guys are like,
oh my God,

1134
01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:18.250
what does that say about gay people?
Vik this was straight people used it.

1135
01:05:18.251 --> 01:05:22.300
It just meant you were an asshole.
And so he said that,

1136
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:24.910
I just remember like I didn't know what to do.
It's just like,

1137
01:05:24.911 --> 01:05:26.320
it was so fucking childish,

1138
01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:29.260
but I also know he was going to like beat the shit out of me.

1139
01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:32.050
So I just went like right back into my state.
Mike.

1140
01:05:32.051 --> 01:05:35.770
My act like this,
almost like a Codis joke.

1141
01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:40.480
You know this right here at the reaction to that is why you can never leave the

1142
01:05:40.481 --> 01:05:43.780
comedy clubs by the way.
Like,
cause that used to be a funny story,

1143
01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:48.900
but now because of like gay people said what that word makes us feel like now

1144
01:05:49.781 --> 01:05:53.260
everybody,
even if you say it and you say that somebody else said it to you,

1145
01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:57.680
it becomes this weird thing of like,
well does he advocate when he said,

1146
01:05:57.710 --> 01:06:01.450
but it just becomes all of that and it comes like context and all of that shit

1147
01:06:01.451 --> 01:06:03.190
to some,
well that's what he said.

1148
01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:10.330
<v 3>Spend a few,
a handful more questions.
You mentioned helicopter parents,</v>

1149
01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.730
helicopters,
helicopters.
Yes.
Let's talk about helicopters.
All right.
How did you,

1150
01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:18.010
how and why did you get into helicopters?
You just run

1151
01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:21.700
<v 2>gamut of everything here.
Ah,
oh yeah.
Helicopters.</v>

1152
01:06:21.701 --> 01:06:24.790
How did I get into that paranoia of living in California?
Okay.

1153
01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:26.530
Living in the La Basin,

1154
01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:30.790
enough conspiracy theory about nothing being behind the dollar,

1155
01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:35.290
uh,
robots coming and all that type of shit.

1156
01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:38.230
And this is place became really claustrophobic.
Well,
it's just like,

1157
01:06:38.231 --> 01:06:41.530
how the hell would I ever get out of here when the shit hits the fan?

1158
01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:45.220
How do you get Outta here?
Like even when it's working well,

1159
01:06:45.221 --> 01:06:47.380
it's still takes three hours just to get out of here.

1160
01:06:47.381 --> 01:06:51.610
Forget about some army getting shit and I was just thought,
you know,
up and out.

1161
01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:56.330
That's the way to go.
Learn how to fly a helicopter.
It when the zombies come,

1162
01:06:56.370 --> 01:07:00.190
you just started up and got,
got,
got,
got,
got,
got,
got.
Gunky just fly out.

1163
01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:04.030
Assuming you're finding a way that does not work.

1164
01:07:04.031 --> 01:07:06.790
If you ever see that in the movies where you just start the thing up and you're

1165
01:07:06.791 --> 01:07:09.010
hang,
you fly out like that.
I mean you can do that,

1166
01:07:09.011 --> 01:07:11.540
but you're going to fuck it up.
Like you got to let the,
the band,

1167
01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:14.350
they got like belts and stuff.
They've got to let those things stretch.

1168
01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:16.390
You got to lift the engine heat up and all that.

1169
01:07:16.391 --> 01:07:20.260
So anytime you see Rambo and those guys just jumping into blank holdings to

1170
01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:23.470
Camaro and he just,
I mean if zombies were coming,

1171
01:07:23.471 --> 01:07:24.610
I would definitely do that shit.

1172
01:07:24.611 --> 01:07:29.611
But I'd be going by the way like please don't let the belt snapped

1173
01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:35.980
and he just knows it down into one of those fucks sake one with you.

1174
01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.950
<v 3>Just imagining the visual.
Uh,
it's just like a lawnmower.</v>

1175
01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.800
Aj taken out zombies and the,
uh,

1176
01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:47.440
do you have other preparations?

1177
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:51.040
Now this is spoken to someone so people think this is crazy.
Uh,

1178
01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:56.220
so in San Francisco and then in New York and got really into at one point went

1179
01:07:56.261 --> 01:07:58.810
off the deep end with prepping stuff like got really into it.

1180
01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:02.110
Like going to canneries for LDS.
You guys can look it up,

1181
01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.960
you can really go down the rabbit hole and some of you will spin out and get

1182
01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:08.230
tied up in the straight jacket.
Uh,
but I,

1183
01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:12.160
and I was being kind of lectured at how unreasonable it was and how silly it was

1184
01:08:12.161 --> 01:08:16.120
that I was getting water and gathering food and all this stuff just in,
we had

1185
01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:18.710
<v 2>disaster.
It took us off the grid for seven days or more SF,</v>

1186
01:08:18.711 --> 01:08:21.510
which happens fairly regularly and uh,

1187
01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:24.050
some editors were kind of making fun of me because I was writing at the time.

1188
01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:28.370
And then hurricane sandy hit New York and Lo and behold,
nobody was prepared.

1189
01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:33.050
Right.
So do you have,
besides the helicopter,
do you have other preparations?

1190
01:08:33.290 --> 01:08:36.980
Nope.
No,
and I,
and I,
and I don't own a helicopter either,

1191
01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:42.080
so it's pretty fucking useless.
No,
what it once was,

1192
01:08:42.081 --> 01:08:45.980
I went down that rabbit hole and you got to get gold coins and you've got to get

1193
01:08:45.981 --> 01:08:47.870
this powdered food and all that type of stuff.

1194
01:08:47.871 --> 01:08:50.630
And then somewhere along the line I was just like,

1195
01:08:50.631 --> 01:08:52.310
do I really want to survive this?

1196
01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:56.210
Do I really want to see what's next or do I want to be one of the people that

1197
01:08:56.211 --> 01:08:59.480
die?
And I realized now I want to be one of the people that die.

1198
01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:05.960
JFK Senate,
the living will envy the dead.
And it's true.

1199
01:09:05.961 --> 01:09:10.340
I don't want to start over again.
Some whole new society.

1200
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:13.340
I remember doing a face to a bid on that so we just pick it up a rake.

1201
01:09:13.341 --> 01:09:17.510
Like these are the new rules and you just solve gathering around with you burlap

1202
01:09:17.511 --> 01:09:22.420
shirt with a string tied around it.
I know like I remember when the uh,

1203
01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.460
that,
that fat dude who's running North Korea,
right?

1204
01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:29.780
The boss's son who's trying way too hard to show that he's a bad ass was saying

1205
01:09:29.781 --> 01:09:32.990
he was going,
he had missiles aimed at La and everyone was panicking.
I was like,

1206
01:09:32.991 --> 01:09:35.870
perfect man.
I hope it's right at my house,
right in my house.

1207
01:09:36.370 --> 01:09:41.130
I hope I'm watching the UFC or football Sunday to sit in here,
Dan.

1208
01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:46.160
And it just vaporized who you don't want to be is the people up in Bakersfield

1209
01:09:47.931 --> 01:09:49.130
just outside of it.

1210
01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:52.860
You still get the radiation with the boils and shit and you're trying to get

1211
01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:54.770
teeth are falling out.
Fuck that.

1212
01:09:56.350 --> 01:09:58.400
I'm trying to figure out how to catch squirrels.

1213
01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:00.140
They have no desire to do any of that.

1214
01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:06.740
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

1215
01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:20.760
<v 6>hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

1216
01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:23.730
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1217
01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:26.970
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1218
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.140
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

1219
01:10:31.141 --> 01:10:34.680
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

1220
01:10:34.681 --> 01:10:39.030
short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

1221
01:10:39.031 --> 01:10:40.320
pondering over the week.

1222
01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:43.320
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1223
01:10:43.321 --> 01:10:46.800
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1224
01:10:46.801 --> 01:10:51.090
somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1225
01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:56.360
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

1226
01:10:57.031 --> 01:10:59.760
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

1227
01:10:59.850 --> 01:11:04.830
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

1228

1232
01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:22.150
This episode is brought to you by Shopify.
I have known and loved to Shopify.

1233
01:11:22.151 --> 01:11:23.460
It just about forever.

1234
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:27.360
Back in 2009 when they had something like eight or 10 employees,

1235
01:11:27.361 --> 01:11:31.050
now they have more than 2000 I helped them as an advisor to create,

1236
01:11:31.090 --> 01:11:32.640
build a business competition,

1237
01:11:33.150 --> 01:11:38.150
which is now the world's largest entrepreneurship competition and many readers

1238
01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:39.803
of my blog,

1239
01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:43.710
first time business owners have ended up making millions and millions of dollars

1240
01:11:43.711 --> 01:11:46.890
each,
many of them as side gigs to their full time jobs.

1241
01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:50.760
So the goal of the build a business competition is to get,

1242
01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:54.390
would be entrepreneurs to get off the couch and make things happen.

1243
01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:58.470
All you have to do is open a store on shop,
find,
starts selling,

1244
01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:04.190
and you can join in July or after July to be eligible to win.

1245
01:12:04.351 --> 01:12:07.020
What does winning mean?
You have to be one of the top performers,

1246
01:12:07.021 --> 01:12:10.650
top sellers in a given category and the prize.

1247
01:12:10.651 --> 01:12:15.651
The reward is an exclusive opportunity to learn from mentors and experts.

1248
01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:21.000
And in the past that has happened at places like the Gatsby castle where we had

1249
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:24.720
Tony Robbins and Daymond John and Seth Goden and so on,

1250
01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:28.920
or on Necker island,
which is so Richard Branson's private island.

1251
01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:32.370

1262
01:13:11.101 --> 01:13:14.730
the extent that I ended up meeting with the CEO not very long ago.

1263
01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:16.890
Why are they so popular?
Well,

1264
01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:21.090
they are the number one cloud accounting software designed exclusively for self

1265
01:13:21.091 --> 01:13:22.470
employed professionals.

1266

That's many of you and used by more than 10 million people and can send
invoices,

1267
01:13:26.131 --> 01:13:29.220
track your time and get paid very,
very quickly,

1268
01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.140
which suits the needs of a lot of freelancers.

1269
01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:36.090
I left to [inaudible] condos and beyond.
You can't take pictures of receipts,

1270
01:13:36.091 --> 01:13:37.560
you can link your credit card and debit card.

1271
01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:42.540
So all the things you buy automatically appear in your fresh books in the right

1272
01:13:42.541 --> 01:13:46.150
category,
so on and so forth.
Makes taxes easy,
makes invoices easy,

1273
01:13:46.151 --> 01:13:50.850
it makes your life easier.
And also in fact,
I'd recommend a pdf.

1274
01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:52.770
Uh,
they didn't ask me to read this part by the way.

1275
01:13:53.010 --> 01:13:57.600
They'd put the other pdf awhile back called breaking the time barrier.
Subtitle,

1276
01:13:57.601 --> 01:14:00.630
how to unlock your true earning potential so you can search for breaking the

1277
01:14:00.631 --> 01:14:02.850
time barrier.
A lot of people ask me,

1278
01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:06.390
how can I get a four hour work week with a service business?

1279
01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:11.070
And the story in that Ebook,
it's pdf is the short answer's really,
really good.

1280
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:14.470
So I think should also check that out.
So breaking the time error,

1281
01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:17.500
