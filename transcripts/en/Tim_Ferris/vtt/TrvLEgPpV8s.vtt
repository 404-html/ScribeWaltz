00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.720
Books,
Tim Ferriss here,
author of the four hour workweek,
tools of titans,

2
00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:07.620
et cetera.
You might imagine that all my days are good days.

3
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:10.710
I wake up and I conquer anxiety and doubt,

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.690
lack of clarity with a mental karate chop and I just annihilate the day hitting

5
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:18.180
home runs,
every single pitch that's thrown my way.

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.690
That's not really how it works.
Usually I wake up,
I'm a little groggy,

7
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.850
maybe I got bad sleep,
had too much wine,
who knows and stumbled through my day.

8
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.950
Uh,
occasionally I have a good day and that is quite frankly enough for me.

9
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.550
And let me explain some of the questions I ask.

10
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.930
Some of the coping mechanisms I use when the day gets off on the wrong foot for

11
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:40.764
whatever reason.

12
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.360
Maybe I find myself at lunch or after lunch feeling like I haven't accomplished

13
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.880
anything.
What do I do in such cases?

14
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.910
Well the first is really a question that I use many,

15
00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:57.300
many,
many,
many times throughout a given say week or month.

16
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.020
And that is which of these from looking at my to do list,

17
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.960
much of which is probably undone in a case like this.

18
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.150
Which one of these if accomplished,

19
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:09.420
would make everything else easier or irrelevant?
I'll say it again.

20
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.400
Which one of these if checked off would make everything else easier or

21
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.760
irrelevant meaning less important or completely unimportant.
All right.

22
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.540
The other question that you can use which is more or less the same is which of

23
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:28.170
these if checked off would leave me satisfied with my day?
Right?

24
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.570
Which one of these third question and eventually you will fall,

25
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.620
come up with an answer that is actionable is which of these if done creates more

26
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:43.050
time for me next week and it could be next month,
it could be tomorrow,

27
00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:48.051
but next week I find to be useful as a timeline and this will generally point to

28
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:52.860
some type of process or system that you can improve.
So okay,

29
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.030
maybe you're not going to hit a certain milestone or ship a certain article or

30
00:01:57.031 --> 00:02:00.330
something as a finished work product,

31
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.550
but you can improve a system or a process.

32
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.750
We'll actually probably have it higher ROI over time and effect many,

33
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.490
many other individual projects.
Okay,
so a which one of these,

34
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:16.050
if if accomplished,
would make everything else easier or element number two,

35
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.870
which one of these would leave me satisfied with my entire day?

36
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:22.110
If it was the only thing I accomplished on this list today and then the last,

37
00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:26.340
which one of these will create more time for me next week or more time for other

38
00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:28.860
people for that matter.
And then,
uh,

39
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.570
I would also say that you don't have to be super,

40
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:38.571
super productive every day and maybe if you're in some type of zero sum game,

41
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.350
you've chosen to be a venture backed startup where everyone arsons everyone,

42
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:46.500
but you have three or four nearly identical companies,

43
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.560
all Kline for market share and it's some type of network effect based business.

44
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.530
Who knows in such a case,
okay,
maybe you've signed up for the full contact sport.

45
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.200
That is the venture back startup world.

46
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.560
Too bad you have ADR or weeks from here until it either succeeds or it blows to

47
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:06.700
pieces in a Supernova of capital destruction.
Aside from that,

48
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.730
if you are,
say a writer,
uh,
a an entrepreneur,

49
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.100
even CEO,
I know plenty of CEOS are certainly fall in this category,

50
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.360
you're not going to be super productive and on point every day and that's okay.

51
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.630
So it's not as though you have to have a minimum number of hours each day within

52
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:26.650
which you are hyper productive.
In fact,

53
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:29.050
I know a lot of people who will go through periods of being very,

54
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:33.340
very unproductive for say a handful of days,

55
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:37.570
maybe handful of weeks if they're on a deadline and just stuck in a Rut as it

56
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:40.060
relates to say,
music writing or anything else.

57
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.930
You don't have to get a lot of things right if you pick the right thing.

58
00:03:44.931 --> 00:03:46.930
So this comes back,
and I'm not going to Belabor the point,

59
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:48.970
but read the effective executive by Peter Drucker.

60
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.210
What you do matters a lot more than how much you do or how well you do things.

61
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.130
If you pick the right targets,
you can get a very,

62
00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:00.550
very high ROI because you have an Archimedes lever.
What does that mean?

63
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:04.420
Archimedes lever means in particular context that you're choosing?

64
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.310
Say projects and goals that have beneficial side effects even if they don't turn

65
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:11.590
out as planned.
So you're choosing say,

66
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:14.530
and this is very much borrowed from Scott Adams who created Dilbert,

67
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.750
which projects and so on,

68
00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:21.751
can I commit myself to through which I will develop some skills and

69
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:26.680
relationships that persist even if they fail from the outside world.

70
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.830
And so if I do a podcast and I commit to six episodes,

71
00:04:29.831 --> 00:04:32.530
even if that podcast goes nowhere,
which is how I thought about it,

72
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.250
which skills and relationships can I develop in the process of doing six

73
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:38.680
episodes that will make the exercise worth it?
All right,

74
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:39.940
and that will transcend to that.

75
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.970
That's also one of the tricks and if you find yourself saying by mid afternoon

76
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.830
feeling really unproductive,
you done nothing productive for the day,

77
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:49.960
you can't quite figure out how to work your way out of it.

78
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.690
What I've found myself doing a as perhaps just a self imposed therapy is saying,

79
00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.370
okay,
maybe today isn't achievement day today is just going to be gratitude and

80
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:03.820
appreciation day.
So let me go for a walk.
Let me notice the small things.

81
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.270
Let me do a nice thing for someone in line and buy coffee for the person behind

82
00:05:07.271 --> 00:05:08.860
me at Starbucks,
whatever it might be,

83
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.000
and focus on the other side of the coin,

84
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.080
which I think is equally important for contentment in any forum of wellbeing or

85
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:20.230
happiness.
And that is appreciating what you have.

86
00:05:20.231 --> 00:05:22.630
So if you can't get what you want,

87
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.010
you can practice wanting what you have and as fortune cookie is,

88
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:31.240
that may sound,
I think that if you can't be happy with what you have,

89
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.150
you will never get anything that will make you happy.

90
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.470
So you have to practice both achievement and if you're flubbing that for the day

91
00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:43.210
or just like with with okay air ball and you're just not making it happen,

92
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.493
okay,

93
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.000
maybe that is a sign from the universe or whatever power you want to choose that

94
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.950
you can take the day and focus on gratitude because that has a much less of a

95
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.800
stress associated with it in terms of pass fail,

96
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.150
that is something you can always make the most of,

97
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.430
even if you only have a few hours left in the day.

98
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.330
So those are a few of the things that I do when the day gets off on the wrong

99
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.690
foot,

100
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.370
or I feel like I am getting absolutely fuck all done with my day.

101
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.960
So hopefully that helps.
Good luck.
Thanks for watching the video.

102
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.740
I have more tips and tactics and actionable stuff to share.

103
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.640
Every week I send out an exclusive newsletter called five bullet Friday.

104
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:24.950
It's totally free.
It takes about five minutes to read.

105
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.050
It includes what I'm reading,

106
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.200
what type of tips I've received from world class experts,

107
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.080
weird gadgets and Gizmos that I found from,

108
00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:37.100
say Japan or God knows where all sorts of really,

109
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:40.850
really esoteric but valuable stuff that you probably wouldn't find yourself.

110
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.400
So check it out.
Five bullet Friday right here.
