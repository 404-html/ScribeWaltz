00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.850
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:06.270
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking it.

3
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.970
I'm a cybernetic organism,
living tissue over metal.

4
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.460
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by [inaudible] dot com the world's largest on</v>

5
00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:32.570
demand massage service.
What?
And let me tell you,

6
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.220
I have a high bar for this stuff.

7
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.880
I have body work done at least once a week because I broke my body.

8
00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:42.700
I have 30 plus fractures and hundred plus Mris.
I need bodywork,

9
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.660
so I have a very,
very,
very high bar for that sooth which I've tested.

10
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.850
I tested my assistance,
tested my employees tested,
delivers a hint,

11
00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:53.360
selected,

12
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.830
licensed and experienced massage therapist to you in the comfort of your own

13
00:00:57.831 --> 00:01:00.950
home,
hotel or office in as little as an hour.

14
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.220
I've tested them in San Francisco,
I've tested them at Austin,

15
00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:08.630
have tested them all over the place and I have to say I was really,

16
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.690
really amazed at the quality of therapist and I do not accept mediocrity at all

17
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.740
in this area.
The process is super simple.

18
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.660
Think of it as Uber for massages,
right?
You choose the kind of massage you want,

19
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.550
say Swedish or sports massage,
deep tissue,
whatever.
Then a,
if you want,

20
00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:29.930
you can opt for a couple's massage.

21
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.880
I imagine that's an edge case as the tech people say,
but whatever you sit,

22
00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:38.960
the lengthier massage,
so let's say you want 60 minutes,
90 minutes,
two hours,

23
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.680
and let's be real.
If you want a proper massage,

24
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.400
go for 90 or 120 minutes for God's sake and you select the gender of your

25
00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:51.170
therapist and then click you're off to the races and they bring the massage

26
00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:55.840
table sheets,
oil music,
so you can unwind no matter where you are.

27
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.920
And I've used this at Airbnbs,
hotels,
et Cetera,

28
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.630
as in 50 cities,

29
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.130
including most major US cities as well as a London,
Sydney,

30
00:02:06.131 --> 00:02:10.330
Melbourne,
Toronto,
and Vancouver.
So number one,

31
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.410
download the APP,

and then use the t the code.

34
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.470
Let me try that again and use the Code Titan 20 t I t a n two zero titan 20 all

35
00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:32.830
caps to get $20 off of your first massage.
That's a lot.

36
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.720
That's a very good discount.
So you should use it.
So again,

And if you're anything like me,

40
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.550

So give it a shot.

41

Try out sooth and your muscles.

Nervous system and sleep well.
Thank you for it.

43
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.910
What the fuck gotta read was that it was pretty good.
That's what I think.
Okay,

44
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.863
enjoy.
Bye.

hello boys and girls.

68
00:04:39.171 --> 00:04:42.350
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

69
00:04:42.351 --> 00:04:42.891
it is my job.

70
00:04:42.891 --> 00:04:47.891
To deconstruct world class performers to figure out how they do what they do and

71
00:04:48.231 --> 00:04:53.120
to dig into the details that you can apply to your own life.
And this episode,

72
00:04:53.121 --> 00:04:56.900
we have a treat.
We do not have an entertainer.
We do not have an actor.

73
00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.120
We do not have a military strategist.

74
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.130
We have a performance specialist,
specifically athletic performance,

75
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.520
and Ryan flirty on Instagram at Ryan flirty one the number one was introduced to

76
00:05:10.801 --> 00:05:13.110
me by Dr Peter a Tia.

77
00:05:13.111 --> 00:05:17.490
And those of you who have heard my episodes with Peter [inaudible] know that

78
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.570
many good things come from Peter.
This is no different.
Uh,

79
00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:24.630
Ryan flarity is the senior director of performance at Nike.

80
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:25.980
Prior to holding that position,

81
00:05:25.981 --> 00:05:29.430
Ryan was the founder and president of prolific athletes,
LLC,

82
00:05:29.431 --> 00:05:31.920
a sports performance facility in San Diego,
California,

83
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.460
where he trained some of the world's best athletes.
His clients include,

84
00:05:35.461 --> 00:05:39.960
you may have recognized or heard of these names,
Serena Williams,
Russell Wilson,

85
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.620
the Arizona cardinals,
Marcus Mariota,
Jamis,
Winston,

86
00:05:43.621 --> 00:05:45.570
and hundreds of other professional athletes.

87
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.590
And while he's perhaps best known for dramatically improving his athletes,

88
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.410
athletes,
athletes,
that's the right word.
Speed.

89
00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.140
More and more athletes and coaches see crying out for his training and guidance

90
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:03.920
on injury prevention and we dig really deeply into that.
In this episode.

91
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.780
Many of his clients have made remarkable recoveries from injuries and several

92
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:13.640
NFL teams and European soccer clubs have sought out his methodology to implement

93
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:15.110
into their own training programming.

94
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.090
Ryan developed an algorithm called a forced number that is based on the trap bar

95
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:20.601
dead lift,

96
00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:24.860
also called the hex bar dead lift and body weight to predict speed such as the

97
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:29.510
40 yard dash.
This was a really fun interview.
We got into the weeds.

98
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.750
We got very,
very nerdy.
If you enjoy it.
For instance,

99
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:36.260
the Pavel Tsatsouline episodes,
the Charles Pollock went episodes,

100
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.730
Dominic D'Agostino or Peter Tia,
then you're going to love this one.

101
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:43.880
It takes us a few minutes as it almost always does to warm up.

102
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.450
That's a limbering up round.
And then we get into all sorts of stuff.

103
00:06:47.451 --> 00:06:51.230
We talk about exercises for reducing injury potential.

104
00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:53.660
We talk about the uh,

105
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.070
forced number and exactly how he uses the trap bar deadlift.

106
00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.970
What do exact workouts look like?
Sets and reps rest intervals,
lay it out,

107
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:06.530
start to finish from warmup.
What does one of these workouts look like?

108
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:08.480
We talked about glutamine exercises.

109
00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:12.350
Perhaps you saw some in tools of titans in Peter t as profile.

110
00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:15.350
That was a directly from Ryan and variations.

111
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.500
We get into all sorts of nitty gritty details.
Uh,

112
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.070
how he helped Meb Keflezighi.

113
00:07:22.071 --> 00:07:25.100
I think it is trained for his stunning Boston marathon victory.

114
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.580
How does he go from sprinting to long distance running?

115
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.130
How does he predict which athletes are going to get injured?
Uh,

116
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.750
so whether you are trying to become a better athlete,

117
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.880
you are trying to become less injured,

118
00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:40.770
are more resilient in any type of training,
uh,

119
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.700
or maybe if you're a bookie looking to bet on different teams and athletes or

120
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:46.700
bet short certain teams that are going to get injured.

121
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:48.710
There is something for everyone.

122
00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:52.370
So please enjoy my conversation with Ryan Flaherty,

123
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.840
the savant of speed.
Ryan,

124
00:07:56.841 --> 00:07:59.480
welcome to the show.
Thanks for having me.
Appreciate it.

125
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:04.630
I have been hoping to connect for quite a few months now and we've had a few

126
00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:07.190
actors behind the scene trying to connect us.

127
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.590
I know for a few months and here we are.

128
00:08:09.591 --> 00:08:14.591
So I'm super stoked to dig in and I thought we could just start with some

129
00:08:15.431 --> 00:08:19.840
basics.
So you are very well known for saying that speed is teachable,

130
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.160
coachable,
but almost everyone out there says it is not,
it is a Nate.

131
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.960
So how did you come to that conclusion?

132
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.820
<v 2>Sure.
I mean,
you know,
first and foremost,
I think when I was at,</v>

133
00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:30.140
when I was a young kid,
kind of a funny story,

134
00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:33.620
but when I was young I was a playing baseball and um,

135
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.380
both my parents were athletic and,
and um,
you know,

136
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:39.380
so they kind of knew some things about sports and I was the,
you know,
hit it.

137
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:40.091
I was at bat,

138
00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:43.800
I hit a line drive to center field and I got thrown out at first base and,
uh,

139
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.960
I can remember my dad yelling unhitch the trailer as I was running,

140
00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:48.670
I was running so slow basically,

141
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:52.220
which is not a good thing for a young kid to hear from his dad,
um,
uh,

142
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.130
in third grade.
But I was,

143
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.510
I was a US really slow kid when I was young.
I grew fast and,

144
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.440
and just couldn't develop speed.
Uh,

145
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:03.600
all the kids were faster than me and my class and my teams.

146
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.950
And so my mom actually put me into track and field when I was young and,
uh,

147
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.920
about fourth grade.
And by the time I was in fifth,
sixth grade,

148
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:13.490
I was the fastest kid in my school.
Um,
and,

149
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.550
and what a lot of that was from was just me understanding and learning how to

150
00:09:17.551 --> 00:09:21.150
run properly.
And so once I did that kind of opened my eyes to the idea that,

151
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.060
you know,
obviously it was not something I was born with in any way,

152
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.880
but it's something that was learned and it was a skill that I really put a lot

153
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:28.750
of time into understanding and learning.
And,
you know,

154
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.070
as I've gotten older and I've,
I've,

155
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:34.380
I've been in the sports performance training field for a long time.
Um,

156
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:39.330
one of the things that,
um,
I think is,
you know,

157
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.750
kind of funny to me as I point out to a lot of people and parents is that,

158
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:45.570
you know,
if you can imagine if every sport played was in the,

159
00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:46.530
in the swimming pool,

160
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.860
one of the first things most kids would do and would be learn how to swim.

161
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:54.210
And yet every single sport right on ground is,
requires running.

162
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.100
And yet we don't teach kids how to run.

163
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.250
It's just kind of like throw them into the sport and they'll figure it out.
But,

164
00:09:59.330 --> 00:09:59.820
um,

165
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.180
that's one of the big things I think I've been trying to help educate people on

166
00:10:03.181 --> 00:10:06.210
is that the one most important thing you can do for your child is just teach

167
00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:07.021
them how to run properly.

168
00:10:07.021 --> 00:10:10.020
And then every other sport we'll kind of come easily to them.
And I think,
um,

169
00:10:10.021 --> 00:10:12.960
you know,
over the years,
more and more research putting into this,
I've,
I've,

170
00:10:12.961 --> 00:10:15.170
I've come to realize quickly through,
you know,

171
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.600
just the research is that a speed is actually a skill you can learn it and some

172
00:10:18.601 --> 00:10:19.770
that you can train also.

173
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:24.180
<v 3>And it,
I mean it seems to me like you have,
just as you said,</v>

174
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.200
I didn't learn to swim.

175
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:29.730
Speaking as someone who's extremely terrified of swimming and for a host of

176
00:10:29.731 --> 00:10:34.000
reasons,
didn't learn to swim properly until early thirties.
Yes,

177
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:39.510
it is.
It is incredible that anything on land that is dependent in part,

178
00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:42.690
whether it's NFL combine and you're doing something like a shuttle run,

179
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:48.420
I mean the difference between first place and say third,

180
00:10:48.421 --> 00:10:52.990
fourth or also ran is highly dependent on,

181
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:57.690
on the technique number one,
but also certain attributes that you can develop.

182
00:10:57.691 --> 00:11:02.691
And I'd look for you to share with us perhaps some of the experiments that,

183
00:11:03.571 --> 00:11:03.960
uh,

184
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.960
you did at USA track to figure out how to better coach speed.

185
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.830
<v 2>Yeah,
absolutely.
So what I ended up taking,</v>

186
00:11:11.831 --> 00:11:16.660
I needed a sample size that are all like some skill level and talent level.

187
00:11:16.661 --> 00:11:19.410
And so,
um,
I took 30 Olympic a standards,

188
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:23.580
sprinters and random on force plate treadmills.
And so the Olympic Games,

189
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.170
there's spinners,
spinners that have hit the required marks to,

190
00:11:26.171 --> 00:11:28.690
to qualify for the Olympics.
Now in the United States is different.

191
00:11:28.691 --> 00:11:30.160
Just because we're,
we're,
we're,

192
00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.670
we're such a high level that you have to be much better than,

193
00:11:33.671 --> 00:11:35.950
than just the standard,
but in other countries and a lot of other countries,

194
00:11:35.951 --> 00:11:38.170
you'd be hit the standard you're in.
Um,
and so I took,

195
00:11:38.171 --> 00:11:40.900
I took Olympic ice standard sprinters and I test them on a force plate
treadmill.

196
00:11:40.901 --> 00:11:40.991
And,

197
00:11:40.991 --> 00:11:44.350
and what I quickly realized was it wasn't about how much force they were created

198
00:11:44.351 --> 00:11:48.160
or how great their technique was.
Um,
it wasn't really until I realized that,

199
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:49.690
I think,

200
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:52.870
I know you're familiar with the study that was done by doctor Peter Way and,
um,

201
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.770
which is mass specific force is,
is kind of king.
It's,
it's,

202
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.060
it's more than anything.

203
00:11:58.061 --> 00:12:01.880
It's how much force you can create or what's your body mass is.
So,
uh,

204
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.480
to use an as example,
it'd be like if I told you,

205
00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:05.650
go run a hundred meter dash as fast,

206
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.830
you could with a 50 pound weight vest on and I,
you know,

207
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.630
and recording your time and then we took it off and then we recorded your time.

208
00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:13.990
You'd be much faster without the 50 pound weight vest on.
Well and firstly,

209
00:12:13.991 --> 00:12:17.080
if you were just an increased somebody lower body strength by 50 pounds,

210
00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:19.090
without adding a single pound of lean muscle mass,

211
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.380
you'd also have the same results,
um,

212
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.200
with improving their times based on them improving the lower body strength and

213
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:29.770
to mass ratio.
And so quickly,
I,
you know,
through the study of all the athletes,

214
00:12:29.771 --> 00:12:31.480
I realized,
okay,
so,
so majority,

215
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:35.250
majority of what it comes down to for sprinters are for people to be fast as

216
00:12:35.251 --> 00:12:38.550
they have an insane amount of strength over what their body mass is.

217
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.650
So an incredible ratio between that strength to weight ratio.
Um,

218
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.440
and so with every FDA train now,

219
00:12:43.441 --> 00:12:45.790
whether it's Serena Williams on the tennis court or,
or you know,

220
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:49.350
a football player that's going into the NFL combine,
um,
it's a,

221
00:12:49.351 --> 00:12:51.640
it's about teaching them how to improve that strength,

222
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.800
strength to weight ratio without increasing any lean muscle mass.
So,
um,

223
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:59.700
I think that's,
that's the key.
And then,
and then secondarily to that,
you know,

224
00:12:59.701 --> 00:13:04.240
mechanics play a part and um,
part of those mechanics,
if you imagine a,

225
00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:04.861
when you run,

226
00:13:04.861 --> 00:13:08.370
when you watch an athlete run from the side of their foot in their swing phase,

227
00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:10.850
when they're running,
looks like it makes,
it's making a circle.
Well,
if,

228
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:12.420
if you have a big circle,

229
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.950
a big wheel that would cover a larger distance than a smaller wheel will.

230
00:13:16.951 --> 00:13:20.580
And so what I try to do is help them understand how to make larger wheels with

231
00:13:20.581 --> 00:13:22.500
their feet in order for them to cover more ground,

232
00:13:22.501 --> 00:13:25.290
which increases their stride length,
which in turn helps them run faster.
Times.

233
00:13:25.291 --> 00:13:28.180
Like to give you an example of Usain bolt takes four to two steps around our,

234
00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.390
your dash next best guy in the world takes 44.

235
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.960
And so ultimately what you're trying to do in improving somebody's speed is

236
00:13:33.961 --> 00:13:38.070
helping them limit the amount of steps they take to run whatever particular

237
00:13:38.071 --> 00:13:41.250
distance they're going,
whether it's a marathon or it's a hundred meter dash,

238
00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:45.670
<v 3>which is also a,
in some respects,</v>

239
00:13:45.671 --> 00:13:48.910
very comparable to Olympic swimming.
Right?

240
00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:53.911
I mean you look at the stride length and efficiency of top swimmers and there's,

241
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.110
there's a direct parallel,

242
00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:01.090
just to just a side note,
I guess,
which I've always wondered,

243
00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:05.100
you hear a lot say in certain running communities,
uh,

244
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.350
about striking with the mid foot and so on.
Uh,

245
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.900
how much attention do you pay to the,
uh,
the,

246
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.460
the impact point on the foot when you're trying to say increase the size of that

247
00:14:18.461 --> 00:14:22.210
wheel,
does that naturally lead to more,
uh,

248
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.700
impact closer to the heel or is that,

249
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:28.150
is that something that has been over emphasized?

250
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.340
<v 2>I don't think it's been over emphasized as much as it as it is,</v>

251
00:14:32.341 --> 00:14:35.070
the placement underneath the pelvis.
So I think more than anything,

252
00:14:35.071 --> 00:14:38.580
it's kind of like where the foot striking him in relation to the center of mass

253
00:14:38.581 --> 00:14:39.391
is most important.

254
00:14:39.391 --> 00:14:42.170
So when you're looking at somebody who's with a mid foot strikes,

255
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:43.980
so I do focus on mid foot strike,

256
00:14:43.981 --> 00:14:46.320
but more than anything I focused on where that midfoot striker is occurring,

257
00:14:46.321 --> 00:14:47.490
whether it's occurring,
you know,

258
00:14:47.491 --> 00:14:51.800
out middle meters in front of the pelvis of directly under the pelvis or behind,

259
00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.980
<v 4>uh,
the goal is to get it as underneath the pelvis as possible.</v>

260
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:57.410
So you want the mid foot strike to happen under the pelvis,

261
00:14:57.411 --> 00:14:59.430
which is more of what I focus on,
um,

262
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.060
in that big circle and the mechanic and the teaching of the mechanics with

263
00:15:02.061 --> 00:15:03.380
making that he'll,
you know,

264
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:08.030
if you can imagine the heels stepping over your opposite knee when you sprint is

265
00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:11.990
the goal.
And so,
and then upon ground contact and the landing phase,

266
00:15:11.991 --> 00:15:15.050
you want the foot to be as directly under the pelvis as possible.

267
00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.650
<v 3>And for sprinters,
do you,</v>

268
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.030
how much do you think about stride rate people have read born to run?

269
00:15:22.031 --> 00:15:23.050
There are many books and they talking about,

270
00:15:23.051 --> 00:15:27.910
well you should go from say 90 and aim for 180 and you should use some type of

271
00:15:27.911 --> 00:15:32.410
metronome or,
or auditory feedback so that you're increasing your,

272
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:37.450
um,
your steps,
foot falls per minute effectively.

273
00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:42.040
How do you think about that in the context of what you do if,
if you do it all?

274
00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.090
<v 4>Yeah,
totally.
No,
I absolutely do.
And I think,
I think the biggest thing is,</v>

275
00:15:45.091 --> 00:15:48.390
it's again,
everything I'm going to talk about today,
it's all about specificity.

276
00:15:48.391 --> 00:15:48.841
As you know,

277
00:15:48.841 --> 00:15:52.200
like once if you're training for performance and for particular sport

278
00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:52.741
performance,

279
00:15:52.741 --> 00:15:55.630
then you're going to train a very particular way that we're focused on,
on,

280
00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.660
you know,
the minutia of,

281
00:15:56.661 --> 00:15:59.870
of those things that that will best help that person perform better.
However,

282
00:15:59.871 --> 00:16:01.870
when you're,
when you're transitioning into more of like a,
you know,

283
00:16:01.871 --> 00:16:04.070
a static runner or just in terms of training for health,

284
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.460
a lot of what I'm going to say may not always apply it,
but it could,

285
00:16:07.461 --> 00:16:11.180
can't apply it in certain ways.
And so I think,
uh,
with that being said,
I think,

286
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:11.870
you know,

287
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:16.130
the way I look at his stride length and stride frequency for the majority of the

288
00:16:16.131 --> 00:16:19.790
time,
our products of how much force you create with the ground of what your body

289
00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:23.510
weight is.
So your mass specific force,
your stride rate,
stride rate and,

290
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:26.930
and length is actually a product of that.
So more than anything,

291
00:16:26.931 --> 00:16:29.240
instead of focusing on that,
I'm focusing on,
on,

292
00:16:29.241 --> 00:16:30.980
on on one hand the mechanics of sprinting.

293
00:16:30.981 --> 00:16:35.340
But I'm also focused on if I know if I can improve strength to weight ratio in

294
00:16:35.341 --> 00:16:35.691
the weight room,

295
00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:39.050
which I think we can get into a little bit more depth later is I know for a fact

296
00:16:39.051 --> 00:16:41.180
that stride length and stride frequency we'll also improved.

297
00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:45.320
Those are byproducts.
Exactly.
And so instead of focusing on one or the other,

298
00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:47.120
I just focused on the one that affects the other.

299
00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:53.030
<v 3>I'm sorry,
I'm so excited to jump into,
I'll get a little overzealous.
Go ahead.</v>

300
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:55.090
<v 4>No,
no,
no worries.
And I think that's the biggest thing of all my,</v>

301
00:16:55.091 --> 00:16:56.170
all the research I've done,

302
00:16:56.171 --> 00:16:59.740
even in the weight room is I'm looking at the exercises that can have the

303
00:16:59.741 --> 00:17:03.700
greatest effect and in a multitude of ways,
not just in one specific area.

304
00:17:03.701 --> 00:17:06.690
So I think because athletes just like human beings have,

305
00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:10.300
have a limited amount of time they have in a day,
they don't want it,
they can't.

306
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:13.220
And,
and trainers can't spend that amount of time in the weight room that,

307
00:17:13.221 --> 00:17:16.680
that most people think they can because they have all these other things going

308
00:17:16.681 --> 00:17:17.161
on,
you know?

309
00:17:17.161 --> 00:17:20.490
And so it's what can I get the most bang for my buck to improve the most amount

310
00:17:20.491 --> 00:17:23.670
of things in the shortest period of time is what I do with elite level athletes,

311
00:17:23.671 --> 00:17:27.170
just like I would with CEOs or recommended for,
you know,

312
00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.190
other people in terms of that don't have the time to spend two hours in a gym.

313
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.290
Um,
you want to get the most bang for your buck.

314
00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:36.830
And so I've really focused on researching exercises that give you that in order

315
00:17:36.831 --> 00:17:39.230
for them to get the greatest improvement.

316
00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:40.081
<v 3>Could you,</v>

317
00:17:40.081 --> 00:17:45.081
and this might be a good place you tell me to segue or it's not really a segue

318
00:17:45.601 --> 00:17:48.450
cause it's all very related,
uh,
force number.

319
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.270
Can you about what that is?

320
00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:52.690
<v 4>Yeah,
absolutely.
And so,</v>

321
00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:57.220
so when I was studying feed and sprinters with USA Track and field,
what I,

322
00:17:57.221 --> 00:18:01.780
what I found quickly was that once the,
once the sprinters hit a certain,

323
00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.550
um,
distance,
right around 30 to 40 meters,

324
00:18:04.551 --> 00:18:08.540
they actually maintained and held the exact same split for the rest of the race.

325
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.870
Uh,
it was actually the athletes who ran the fast times like Usain bolts of the

326
00:18:11.871 --> 00:18:14.800
world.
We're actually the ones who we're slowing down the lease.

327
00:18:14.801 --> 00:18:16.360
But really when you looked at their 10 meters splits,

328
00:18:16.361 --> 00:18:19.960
it was almost identical all the way through to the finish.
Um,
and so what I,

329
00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.000
what I,
um,

330
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.260
when it came to realized quickly was that there was a correlation there between

331
00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.410
who could hold a top end speed the longest and who was winning the race.
And so,

332
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.513
um,

333
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.670
when I was looking at that and then then inversely was looking at the athletes

334
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.370
and measuring their mass specific force.
And the force plate treadmill.

335
00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.110
What I realized quickly was,
okay,

336
00:18:37.111 --> 00:18:41.550
there's relation to the athletes who have a high strength to weight ratio or the

337
00:18:41.551 --> 00:18:44.040
or the force to mass specific force,
uh,

338
00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.910
forced to mass ratio and the treadmill that also are covering the same,
you know,

339
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.780
lowest splits and their 10 meters,
the 10,

340
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:53.040
they're flying tens in the hundred meter dash that all of the athletes came to

341
00:18:53.041 --> 00:18:56.040
me after that and were like,
this is awesome.
This is great,
you know,
but like,
hey,

342
00:18:56.041 --> 00:18:58.260
how do we have,
how do we improve this?
And it was,

343
00:18:58.261 --> 00:19:00.960
it was kind of a light bulb that went on for me really quickly was that I think

344
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:06.260
what most researchers scientists spend time looking into is diagnostics and

345
00:19:06.261 --> 00:19:09.800
assessments.
But what most people really need is,
is ways to improve it.

346
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:14.010
So unless you come with a diagnostic that you can actually show them improvement

347
00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.300
and show them how to improve it,
they're almost meaningless.
Um,
and so I,
I,
what I,

348
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.340
what I spent the next five years doing was spending time in the weight room and,

349
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.990
and,
and,
and correlating the data between every exercise.
I,

350
00:19:24.991 --> 00:19:27.660
so I tested the same athletes in the weight room on with squat power,

351
00:19:27.661 --> 00:19:32.130
clean hang in front squats,
leg press,
leg extension,
um,
Rdo,

352
00:19:32.131 --> 00:19:35.090
everything you can think of under the sun and the,

353
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:38.920
and measured there one rep Max and those exercises and their body and their body

354
00:19:38.921 --> 00:19:40.930
mass and compared that to the force plate treadmill study.

355
00:19:40.931 --> 00:19:43.570
And it didn't correlate until actually got to the hex bar dead lift,

356
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:48.060
<v 3>which is also called the trap bar dead lift for so yup.
Exactly</v>

357
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.540
<v 4>their bar that you stepped into with the handles on the side of the body instead</v>

358
00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:54.360
of the bar being in front.
Right.
And then when I,

359
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.120
when I started testing the same athletes with the hex bar dead lift for the trap

360
00:19:57.121 --> 00:19:58.620
bar,
dead lift Max in their body weight,

361
00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:02.790
it actually directly correlated to the force plate treadmill study,
um,

362
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:06.330
at their max velocity and top speed.
And so I realized quickly,
okay,

363
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:09.300
if this is the order in which they ran the hundred meter dash time in by their

364
00:20:09.301 --> 00:20:09.661
hex bar,

365
00:20:09.661 --> 00:20:13.200
dead lift Max and body weight and I improve their hex bar dead lift Max without

366
00:20:13.201 --> 00:20:15.690
increasing bodyweight,
what I see the same improvement their speed.

367
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.660
And over the past seven years of testing that I have,

368
00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.260
<v 3>if you have a</v>

369
00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:26.760
not totally sit entry but former competitive athlete who would like to use a

370
00:20:28.241 --> 00:20:33.241
protocol to improve this relative strength that we've been talking about,

371
00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:38.490
sort of pound per pound strength output using the trap bar deadlift or hex bar w

372
00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:44.170
w what might the protocol look like?

373
00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.760
<v 4>You know,
for most people I would,</v>

374
00:20:45.761 --> 00:20:48.910
I would generally start them with somewhat of a hypertrophy or strength phase

375
00:20:48.911 --> 00:20:51.510
for a while just to get them used to the lift and you to get,
you know,

376
00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:54.540
get their lower back strong enough to be able to get to the power phases.

377
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:58.380
<v 3>What would that first hypertrophy fees look like?</v>

378
00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:59.620
<v 4>Yeah.
So I would go,</v>

379
00:20:59.621 --> 00:21:04.000
I mean I would do probably three to four sets of eight of your 65% of your Max

380
00:21:04.001 --> 00:21:08.590
for um,
one to two weeks.
And then I would,
I would,
I would shift up 5%,

381
00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:12.360
uh,
every week leading up to about 85,
90%,

382
00:21:12.361 --> 00:21:14.520
where I would go for reps of five or three.

383
00:21:14.521 --> 00:21:18.810
So based on the percentage of your that you're lifting,
um,
so let's say it's 65%,

384
00:21:18.811 --> 00:21:23.040
you're going to be between six to eight range there.
When you start to get 75,

385
00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.260
<v 3>80%,</v>

386
00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:27.030
<v 4>you want to be in the five to eight rep range.</v>

387
00:21:27.031 --> 00:21:29.850
And then when you get above 85% to 95%,

388
00:21:29.851 --> 00:21:33.340
you want to be between two reps in five reps.
So more than anything.

389
00:21:33.341 --> 00:21:36.330
And what you're trying to do ultimately is with the amount of cross sectional

390
00:21:36.331 --> 00:21:37.680
muscle fiber that your body currently has,

391
00:21:37.681 --> 00:21:39.210
you're trying to stress your nervous system,

392
00:21:39.211 --> 00:21:41.940
recruit the largest motor units possible.
Um,

393
00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.650
and to do that you have to lift heavy.

394
00:21:43.651 --> 00:21:46.320
You have to lift heavy weights in order to recruit the larger motor units.

395
00:21:46.321 --> 00:21:50.550
Because ultimately what most people do when they exercise and they lift weights

396
00:21:50.551 --> 00:21:53.240
is that they're,
they're,
they're stressing their body,
essentially.

397
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:56.770
ISOMETRIC concentrically and they're adding lean muscle mass.

398
00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.570
They're also recruiting motor units,
but they're also,

399
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.550
but they're also adding the muscle mass at the same rate.

400
00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.250
What we're trying to do,
and the cool part about the hex bar,

401
00:22:03.251 --> 00:22:04.840
dead lift is at the very top.
When you,

402
00:22:04.841 --> 00:22:07.750
when you push away from the ground and you're in a standing position away from

403
00:22:07.751 --> 00:22:08.410
the ground,

404
00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:11.110
I actually am going to coach you guys to let go of the bar to drop it.

405
00:22:11.111 --> 00:22:14.440
So there's no east centric movement in the,
in the,
and the exercise.

406
00:22:14.441 --> 00:22:18.900
So that way you don't tear sarcoma and lean muscle mass.
Um,
and,
and that,

407
00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.690
so your stress,
the nervous system to get stronger,
recruit large motor units,

408
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.330
but you're not actually tearing muscle fiber down and adding more muscle mass.

409
00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:30.370
Um,
and so I would go every two weeks.
I would just adjust 5% um,

410
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:30.981
and,

411
00:22:30.981 --> 00:22:35.460
and go up 5% and for about four to eight reps for 65% I would say four to six

412
00:22:35.461 --> 00:22:40.461
reps for like 70 75% four to five reps for 85% and then two to three reps for a

413
00:22:41.911 --> 00:22:45.510
95 to 90% and just progressed that way.
And everyone,
it's all relative.

414
00:22:45.511 --> 00:22:47.600
So it doesn't mean everyone's going to live to 500 pounds,
but,

415
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:51.420
but ultimately what you're trying to get to is an elite level football player,

416
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:56.630
like a four or five 40 yard dash four four 40 yard dash would be a 3.2 times

417
00:22:56.671 --> 00:22:59.400
their body weight in their export dead lift to run that time.

418
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:04.530
3.2 times body weight.
Yeah.
And,
and what I find is in,
in,
in,
in,
in most like,

419
00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.330
you know,
a healthy adults,
they can,

420
00:23:06.331 --> 00:23:10.950
they can generally pull about anywhere from 2.2 to 2.6 times their body weight

421
00:23:10.951 --> 00:23:12.840
in,
in,
in the annex bar dead lift Max.

422
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:15.300
<v 3>And what,
what would be a,</v>

423
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:20.260
a good objective if perhaps 3.2,

424
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.860
uh,
w what would you,
from the outset,
if you said in a,
in a year's time,

425
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:29.070
I would like to get you to x times body weight.

426
00:23:29.071 --> 00:23:31.500
And does it differ for men or women or is it the same?

427
00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.660
<v 4>No,
actually you don't,
it's kind of funny if it's the same.
I,</v>

428
00:23:34.661 --> 00:23:36.030
the funny part is is when I have like,

429
00:23:36.031 --> 00:23:40.410
so right now I'm training a lot of the top NFL draft hopefuls guys that just

430
00:23:40.411 --> 00:23:43.170
finished their college career.
Um,
and then they come in the weight room,

431
00:23:43.171 --> 00:23:46.010
they'll see,
you know,
some of the female Olympic that I have

432
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:50.780
<v 2>training and the females are who are 135 pounds or dead lifting 440 pounds,</v>

433
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.890
and they'll walk in the first day and they'll hit three 85 and it immediately

434
00:23:54.891 --> 00:23:58.400
humbles them to realize what have I been doing for the past four years of my

435
00:23:58.401 --> 00:23:59.330
life.
Uh,

436
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:03.100
because those women over there are dead lifting 100 pounds more than I am.
Um,

437
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:07.820
but it's pretty funny.
But when they weigh 80 pounds less.
Exactly.
Yeah.

438
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.580
So no,
no,
I think,
um,
you know,

439
00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:15.680
I mean I think reasonably over the course of two years a question like what

440
00:24:15.681 --> 00:24:17.360
could people get to over the course of a year

441
00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.320
<v 3>goal for someone who's reasonably fit,</v>

442
00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:26.100
but by no means a NCAA or Olympic sprinter

443
00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.740
<v 2>over two is a,
is a great goal for somebody like that.</v>

444
00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:31.163
<v 3>Got It.</v>

445
00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.340
And that is for one rep maximum or four four given wreck

446
00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:37.050
<v 2>rep range.
Yeah.
So I think,</v>

447
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:40.530
oh over two times their body weight for a one rep maximum.
So,

448
00:24:40.531 --> 00:24:42.790
so to give you an example,
let's say you're a hundred pounds,

449
00:24:42.791 --> 00:24:46.920
your goal's 200 pounds.
Um,
you know,
for sets of five,

450
00:24:46.921 --> 00:24:51.900
you going to want to do,
um,
170 pounds for five.
That would be,

451
00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:56.800
you know,
to get you up to 200 as your Max got would be 85% of your Max.

452
00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:01.450
<v 3>Got It.
Got It.
So 85% times five,</v>

453
00:25:01.451 --> 00:25:06.010
five reps.
Got it.
And,
uh,
when,

454
00:25:06.011 --> 00:25:07.390
when someone goes through the,

455
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:11.230
the muscle building general sort of hypertrophy,

456
00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:15.550
a base building,
once they've done that in,

457
00:25:15.551 --> 00:25:20.551
they're working on the relative strength and the neural drive and the recruiting

458
00:25:20.571 --> 00:25:23.960
of these motor units,
uh,
and focusing on that,

459
00:25:23.961 --> 00:25:28.070
how many times a week are they doing a trap bar,

460
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:31.670
dead lift workout and what would such a workout look like?

461
00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.390
<v 2>Sure.
Yeah.
So I mean for the elite level athletes,</v>

462
00:25:35.391 --> 00:25:38.250
generally I'll have them do it anywhere between one to two times a week.
Uh,

463
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.820
just depends on the amount of time I have with them.
Uh,

464
00:25:40.821 --> 00:25:44.030
for certain athletes like Serena Williams and I work with her in the off season,

465
00:25:44.031 --> 00:25:46.430
I would generally have,
or like in November or December.

466
00:25:46.431 --> 00:25:48.050
So I only have two months with her.

467
00:25:48.051 --> 00:25:51.500
So it's all kind of east or into it and build up to two times a week towards the

468
00:25:51.501 --> 00:25:53.330
end.
But if you have a long period of time,

469
00:25:53.331 --> 00:25:56.660
I would go one day a week and then alternate with another complex exercise.

470
00:25:56.661 --> 00:26:00.980
The second lower body day you do that week.
Um,
but I think two times a week.

471
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:04.460
And you know,
if it starting a hypertrophy phase,
I would say four times at eight,

472
00:26:04.461 --> 00:26:08.150
at 65%.
Um,
I like to pair it,
you know,
uh,
with,

473
00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.140
with some sort of plyometric to continue to recruit those fast twitch,

474
00:26:12.141 --> 00:26:14.600
those larger motor units.
Um,
and then,

475
00:26:14.601 --> 00:26:18.490
and then from there I go into all like auxiliary single leg unilateral exercises

476
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:23.010
to you fix imbalances are trained the the body in a way that,
um,

477
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:26.000
we're,
we're not working bilaterally besides that one x bar dead lift.

478
00:26:26.001 --> 00:26:28.760
So I would do an export data for the Plyo and then some,

479
00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:30.260
a couple of single leg exercises.

480
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:34.120
<v 3>I love to dig into some details.
So let's just say,</v>

481
00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:38.170
let's pretend since I need the,
the pat on the head,

482
00:26:38.171 --> 00:26:40.120
let's pretend like I'm an elite athlete,
which I'm not,

483
00:26:40.121 --> 00:26:42.450
but let's just say I'm ready.
Sure.

484
00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:46.920
I'm coming in to do this workout and my body's prepped for it.
So I walk in,

485
00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.030
what does the warmup look like?
And then when you get into the dead lifts,

486
00:26:51.031 --> 00:26:54.500
what are the sets and reps and rest intervals like Wah.

487
00:26:54.501 --> 00:26:57.180
Walk me through the details of what that end of course,

488
00:26:57.181 --> 00:27:00.630
it's highly individualized.
You can just make up some,
uh,

489
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:04.000
we don't even need to get into the numbers.
You could use percentages,
but,
um,

490
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:07.260
what would the warmup and the whole thing look like?

491
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:11.050
<v 2>Yeah,
so generally I like to do some sort of a dynamic warm,
so some,</v>

492
00:27:11.051 --> 00:27:13.750
some sort of movement,
warm up dot.
Just getting on a treadmill or on a bike and,

493
00:27:13.751 --> 00:27:17.730
and,
and running or biking.
I like to,
you know,
do some walking lunges,

494
00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:22.210
walking lunges with a twist,
a some walking toe touches,
some quad stretches,

495
00:27:22.211 --> 00:27:24.160
walking,
a skipped straight leg skips,

496
00:27:24.161 --> 00:27:26.670
that type of thing to kind of get some blood flow.
Um,

497
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.940
and to help increase range of motion.
You know,

498
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:33.530
I have athletes start with a fun of foam roll,
um,
just to get,
again,

499
00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:37.660
blood flow,
just to warm the muscles up a little bit.
Um,
uh,
or a power play,

500
00:27:37.661 --> 00:27:39.980
some sort of vibration plate if you have that access to that.

501
00:27:39.981 --> 00:27:43.430
And then a dynamic warm up.
And then I would,
I would then get into some,
uh,

502
00:27:43.431 --> 00:27:44.031
activation.

503
00:27:44.031 --> 00:27:47.360
So I do some like light glute activation where you do some hip bridges or

504
00:27:47.361 --> 00:27:51.190
something like that just to fire up the glutes.
Um,
and I do some quad activation,

505
00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.170
which would be like some no weighted step ups.

506
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.660
You do like two sets of eight of that by by itself.

507
00:27:56.661 --> 00:27:59.060
And then you get into the export dead,
the form up,

508
00:27:59.061 --> 00:28:01.610
which would be probably two to three sets that you know,

509
00:28:01.611 --> 00:28:05.970
50% then 55 to 60% and in,
and then we'd work

510
00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.120
<v 3>or how many,
how many repetitions?</v>

511
00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:10.870
<v 2>Five and six.</v>

512
00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:17.000
<v 3>Okay.
Got It.
Five,
five to six reps of 50% of your working weight.</v>

513
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:22.200
<v 2>Correct?
Yup.
Yup.
And,
and then once you get to 65%,
you'd start your,
your,
your,
uh,</v>

514
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.570
your,
your round.
And so

515
00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:26.400
<v 3>how many minutes of rest between the warmup sets?</v>

516
00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:29.730
<v 2>I would say a minute.
Okay.
Pretty short.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

517
00:28:29.731 --> 00:28:30.900
You're going under under a certain,

518
00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:35.800
<v 3>and those are full east centric.
A concentric,
eccentric or you dropped.</v>

519
00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.050
Okay.
Got It.
So you're not dropping the bar on these?

520
00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:42.950
<v 2>I am not.
No.
Got It.
All right.
Um,
and,
and so,
and then once you get into the,</v>

521
00:28:42.951 --> 00:28:46.550
into the,
into the working set,
then it would go concentrical only and I would go,

522
00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.550
um,
and obviously you'd get right back into position.
So it's,
it stand up,

523
00:28:49.551 --> 00:28:51.920
drop standup drops then have dropped eight times in a row.

524
00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.080
<v 3>Eight repetitions.
Yep.
With what percentage of your one Rep Max?</v>

525
00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.920
<v 2>65%.
Okay.
Got It.
Okay.
Yep.
For the first two weeks.</v>

526
00:28:57.921 --> 00:29:02.840
So it would be like in a hypertrophy phase and then I would,
um,
rest 30 seconds.

527
00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.030
And then I would pair that with like a level one plyometric,

528
00:29:05.031 --> 00:29:07.850
which would be like a basic squat jump.
And I would do that five times.

529
00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:09.800
And more than anything.
And plyometrics,

530
00:29:09.801 --> 00:29:12.660
what I think I really wanna kind of get across today is that the goal of him

531
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:16.190
doing plyometrics and training and if for an,
whether an athlete or just,
um,

532
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:19.580
looking to improve,
uh,
you know,
you're human performance.

533
00:29:19.581 --> 00:29:21.610
I think the biggest thing you're trying to improve and plyometrics,

534
00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.640
amortization phase,

535
00:29:22.641 --> 00:29:26.120
which is the transition between you centric and your concentric.

536
00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:29.600
And so to do that you gotta be close to or near 100%.

537
00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:33.920
So I'm big on in between your plows resting to do it as hot as hard and as fast

538
00:29:33.921 --> 00:29:35.240
as you possibly can to improve it.

539
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:37.570
A lot of times I think you watch a training program and you,

540
00:29:37.571 --> 00:29:42.010
you see where plyometric start to become more of a like a kind of conditioning

541
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:44.080
trade.
You do it to a point where you're tired,

542
00:29:44.081 --> 00:29:46.570
which is not going to help you improve what you're trying to improve,

543
00:29:46.571 --> 00:29:50.080
which is amortization.
So,
um,
so I take rest in between,

544
00:29:50.081 --> 00:29:51.490
so I would do like five squat jumps.

545
00:29:51.491 --> 00:29:54.130
We were trying to explode as high and as fast off the ground as possible.

546
00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:58.100
<v 3>And you're doing that,
you're doing that in between these deadlift work sets.</v>

547
00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:01.690
<v 2>Yeah.
So the superset would be a hex bar,
dead lift at eight,
uh,</v>

548
00:30:01.691 --> 00:30:05.350
with drop and then 32nd rest.
Then you do your five plyometrics.
Got It.

549
00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:09.170
<v 3>And you're trying to minimize ground contact in those pliers or how are you,</v>

550
00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.780
what makes for a good rep in the plyometrics

551
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.190
<v 2>more than anything you're trying to,
you're trying to get to a depth that you,</v>

552
00:30:15.191 --> 00:30:17.830
that you'd feel like is natural for you to jump as high as you can.

553
00:30:17.831 --> 00:30:20.830
So I'm just looking for somebody to,
you know,
in fight or flight,

554
00:30:20.831 --> 00:30:22.450
they're trying to jump as high as they possibly can.

555
00:30:22.451 --> 00:30:25.500
I don't really care what that looks like.
You would not,

556
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.430
you would not look like mine.
I think caught up,

557
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:31.930
people get too caught up in jumping.

558
00:30:31.931 --> 00:30:35.020
That stretch shortening cycle that occurs in our lower body when we jump happens

559
00:30:35.021 --> 00:30:38.650
in a window of 250 milliseconds.
And when we try to perfect our,

560
00:30:38.651 --> 00:30:41.580
our technique and our squat jumps,
we missed that window,
right?

561
00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:44.350
Which doesn't allow us to explode off the ground as fast as we possibly could.

562
00:30:44.351 --> 00:30:45.161
So it's more than anything,

563
00:30:45.161 --> 00:30:48.670
it's just good down and up as quick as you possibly can.
Um,
kind of as if you,

564
00:30:48.671 --> 00:30:49.180
you know,

565
00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.940
if it was firefly near the jump besides you can to save somebody or something.

566
00:30:51.941 --> 00:30:55.390
So that's what I'm looking for.
And then after that with at 65%,

567
00:30:55.391 --> 00:30:58.750
I would go with somewhere around a two to three minute recovery in between each

568
00:30:58.751 --> 00:31:02.770
set.
Right.
Um,
once you get to 85 to 95%,

569
00:31:02.771 --> 00:31:06.550
I think like as you wrote in your book,
Pryor,
uh,

570
00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:08.560
is when you get to the heavy percentages,
you will,

571
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:11.950
you want to go to more of like a four to five minute recovery between a lot of

572
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.640
the ATP you foster and to regenerate to as close to a hundred percent as

573
00:31:15.641 --> 00:31:17.330
possible.
So,
um,
wow.

574
00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:22.350
<v 3>Sorry,
I'm a dog is allergic might my dog hates phosphocreatine.
No worries.</v>

575
00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:26.500
Now she loves it.
She loves freaking out.
She uses a lot of foster creative.

576
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:27.850
Sorry about that.
So yeah,

577
00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:31.570
as you get heavier than you'd be taking longer Resner rules and,

578
00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:36.540
and for those heavier weights,
85,
95%,
are you still going to be,

579
00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:40.990
say doing a work set then taking,
was it a 62nd rest?

580
00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:42.300
You said before the pliers,

581
00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.860
<v 2>anywhere between 30 to 60 is dot.
Got It.
Yeah.
So born anything,</v>

582
00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:47.800
you're just looking to recover to the point where you can jump it up as close to

583
00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:49.780
a full effort as possible.

584
00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:53.170
<v 3>Got It.
Then do five,
say,
uh,</v>

585
00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:58.010
five jumps and then rest four to five minutes or so,
somewhere in that range,

586
00:31:58.011 --> 00:31:59.960
and then do the next set.

587
00:31:59.961 --> 00:32:04.690
And you do that for in the case of the hypertrophy.
Now we moved,

588
00:32:04.691 --> 00:32:07.490
we were talking about four sets of say eight repetitions.

589
00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:12.200
When you get down into the lower rep ranges where you're doing two to five reps

590
00:32:12.201 --> 00:32:16.640
at 85 to 95% of one rep Max.
How many sets are you still doing?

591
00:32:16.641 --> 00:32:19.750
Three to four sets.
Are you doing a higher number of sets?
No,

592
00:32:19.751 --> 00:32:23.230
I'm still doing three to four.
Okay.
Yup.
So we finished the dead lifts.

593
00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:25.630
What happens after that

594
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:29.450
<v 2>then?
Then I would go,
so,
so all the athletes that I,
that I,
that I bring in,</v>

595
00:32:29.451 --> 00:32:33.560
I do force plate testing with them.
So I'll do a combination of jumps,
um,

596
00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.540
on the force plate to give me an idea of kind of there,
you know,

597
00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:39.560
what their rate of force development looks like.
You know,

598
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.800
essentially isometric concentrically,
um,
their peak force,

599
00:32:42.801 --> 00:32:43.611
a lot of different factors.

600
00:32:43.611 --> 00:32:46.450
And I'll take that into consideration when I'm building their programming,
uh,

601
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.740
for the rest of the exercise.
But to just give you an example,

602
00:32:48.741 --> 00:32:52.160
the rest of the workout will go somewhat,
um,
unilateral.

603
00:32:52.161 --> 00:32:56.630
So I'll do it all single leg exercises.
So the next a group of exercises could,

604
00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.990
could look like a Bulgarians Dumbbell,
Bulgarian split squat.

605
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:01.730
But for this particular athlete,
for you,

606
00:33:01.731 --> 00:33:03.740
let's say I wanted to focus on the east centric tempo.

607
00:33:03.741 --> 00:33:08.270
So what I would do with you is I would have you go lower down for five seconds

608
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.640
and then stand up as fast as you can for one second.

609
00:33:10.641 --> 00:33:14.260
And you would do three sets of six of that.
Um,

610
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.360
I would then have you rest again 30 seconds to 60 seconds and that would put you

611
00:33:17.361 --> 00:33:20.060
in into a position where you're seated on a bench.

612
00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:23.190
I'm sitting down with one foot,
an inch off the ground,

613
00:33:23.191 --> 00:33:25.200
the other foot's on the ground and do a single legs,

614
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:29.450
a concentric plyometric where you would stand up and jump as fast as you can

615
00:33:29.451 --> 00:33:31.040
from a seated single leg position.

616
00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.990
So imagine sitting in a chair both feet on the ground,

617
00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:35.790
lift the left leg off the ground by one inch,

618
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:38.490
the right foot's on the ground and you jump off the right and land on the right

619
00:33:38.491 --> 00:33:39.750
only.
Um,
and,

620
00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.650
and I actually have Olympic athletes that I do this with where they'll actually

621
00:33:42.651 --> 00:33:46.130
go from a seated 90 degrees seated position with one foot and they'll jump onto

622
00:33:46.131 --> 00:33:47.210
a 56 inch box.

623
00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:53.400
<v 3>It's pretty remarkable.
Remarkable.
Yeah.
And so,
and so I think,</v>

624
00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:56.710
I don't know if I can get off the toilet with one leg,
an inch off the ground

625
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:58.100
<v 2>trustee meeting too.
I,</v>

626
00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:00.470
I don't demonstrate because I'm so embarrassed in front of some of them.

627
00:34:00.471 --> 00:34:04.340
I'm like,
oh no,
you demonstrated I'll bring her another athlete.
Um,
but,
uh,
yeah,

628
00:34:04.341 --> 00:34:08.900
so,
so working on,
on creating power from it,
from a static seated position.
Right.

629
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:12.350
Very similar to how you would,
if you were sprinting.
Um,
and so,

630
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.740
so that's a good example of the second,
um,
uh,

631
00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.940
grouping of exercises that I would do,
uh,
for this,
for this lower body day.

632
00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:20.890
<v 3>Got It.</v>

633
00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:25.890
And then after the isolator role exercises,

634
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:28.670
<v 2>then I would go into some sort of stability exercise,</v>

635
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.660
proprioception exercise where I would go like,
um,
I call them step downs,

636
00:34:32.661 --> 00:34:33.560
but imagine standing on,

637
00:34:33.561 --> 00:34:36.560
on top of a bench with one foot leg hanging off of the side,

638
00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:40.400
the other foot's on top of the bench and just lowering yourself slowly down for

639
00:34:40.401 --> 00:34:42.440
three seconds and back to standing for three seconds.

640
00:34:42.441 --> 00:34:46.520
And I would do some somewhere around one to two sets of 20 of those.
Um,

641
00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:49.280
more than anything I'm focused on.
Um,

642
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:52.950
now that we burned through some larger muscle groups,
uh,
and the lower body,

643
00:34:52.951 --> 00:34:57.870
I'm looking at it now that some of the stabilization muscles,
so Vmo,
glute need,

644
00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:01.590
um,
and getting those fired up,
uh,
with a step down.

645
00:35:01.591 --> 00:35:03.850
So it's a single except down to three seconds down,
three second step.

646
00:35:03.851 --> 00:35:06.540
And you're just lowering yourself out over the side of the bench and backup.

647
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:09.580
I'm standing on the edge of the bench maji standing on the edge of a building

648
00:35:09.581 --> 00:35:11.580
and lowering one foot down three inches and backup.

649
00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:14.850
<v 3>Got It.
And so Vmo,
that's what is it?</v>

650
00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:19.710
A vastus medialis obliques.
Yup.
And uh,

651
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.920
I guess one of the muscles,

652
00:35:22.921 --> 00:35:27.740
when we thought responsible for a fair number of injuries,
it would,

653
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:29.720
it would seem,
or at least sort correct.

654
00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:32.720
<v 2>I think the biggest thing with get with the Vmo that I look at though is more</v>

655
00:35:32.721 --> 00:35:35.130
than anything imbalanced.
So I'm looking at,
uh,

656
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:39.390
a asymmetry between the [inaudible] and the rest of the quad.
If you look at,

657
00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:42.450
I have a great example of this with a lot of the NFL guys I'm turning right now,

658
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:46.500
but when they come in from college is that they do so many core complex

659
00:35:46.501 --> 00:35:47.660
exercises that they,
the,

660
00:35:47.661 --> 00:35:50.820
the larger muscle groups kind of dominate and some of the smaller muscles

661
00:35:50.821 --> 00:35:53.610
stabilizers don't,
don't get recruited as much as you'd like.

662
00:35:53.611 --> 00:35:58.611
And so you'll see like a guy with a huge quad and a 12 year old girl scout size,

663
00:35:59.341 --> 00:36:02.010
BMO pretty,
it's pretty unbelievable.

664
00:36:02.011 --> 00:36:06.900
And that for me is a big sign that uh,
a joint stability instability.

665
00:36:06.901 --> 00:36:10.080
But number two is they're at high risk and high profitability for lower

666
00:36:10.081 --> 00:36:14.550
extremity injury.
And so that's something we'll,
we'll,
we'll,
we'll focus on a lot.

667
00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:17.510
<v 3>Got It.
Where could someone,</v>

668
00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:23.000
do you have any descriptions or any video or can you point someone to any

669
00:36:23.001 --> 00:36:26.360
resources if they wanted to learn how to do because I want to learn this single

670
00:36:26.361 --> 00:36:28.550
leg step down in the way you're describing.

671
00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.970
<v 2>Yeah.
If I,
if I don't already have a video up on Youtube,</v>

672
00:36:31.971 --> 00:36:35.750
I will put one up there for you.
And then also to,
um,
you know,

673
00:36:35.751 --> 00:36:39.440
I work with Nike on,
on their APP that they have,
which is the Nike Training Club.

674
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:43.340
Not to plug or anything,
but you got that,
that has a ton of the exercises in it.

675
00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:43.620
Um,

676
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:47.240
it's actually a great kind of resource for different exercises and things that I

677
00:36:47.241 --> 00:36:51.510
do that that's in there,
which you can pull from and it's free.
So,
so it's,
it's,

678
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:54.350
you know,
it doesn't cost anything.
What is your youtube account?

679
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.840
A prolific athletes.

680
00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:00.720
<v 3>Got It.
All right.
So we'll get on that by the time this comes out guys,
we'll,</v>

681
00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.350
we'll make sure something is up for you.
Yeah,
absolutely.

682
00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:06.640
<v 2>And then I'll finish with seven way hips,
which I think you know all about.</v>

683
00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:09.460
You'll finish with what?
Seven way hips,
which I think,

684
00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:13.300
<v 3>can you describe it?
But yes,
I do know all about it.</v>

685
00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:18.640
I gave,
I gave the treacherous P to Tia credit.

686
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:24.080
It's a doctor Peter Tia mutual friend of course who,
uh,

687
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:27.540
I described wealth,

688
00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:32.570
I shared a lot from Peter in tools of titans on pages 61 62 63 and these are

689
00:37:35.191 --> 00:37:36.910
gluten,
mead,
uh,

690
00:37:36.911 --> 00:37:41.911
at least glute mead primary exercises that you taught Peter.

691
00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:43.870
So that's the seven way hip.

692
00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.360
<v 2>Yup,
that's it.
Yeah.
But I'd finished with that.</v>

693
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:50.130
<v 3>And you'd do that.
How many times a week?</v>

694
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:54.390
We're only talking about the trap bar workouts,

695
00:37:54.391 --> 00:37:56.280
but let's say you're doing this once or twice a week.

696
00:37:56.281 --> 00:37:59.250
Is once a week enough for the seven way hip or would you do it more?

697
00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.630
<v 2>No,
absolutely not.
I mean,
I think gluten needs are one of the,
uh,</v>

698
00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:07.250
I one of the muscles I think for most people causing a lot of issue they don't

699
00:38:07.251 --> 00:38:10.840
even know about,
especially when it comes to lower,
lower back issues.
Um,

700
00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:13.900
and under developed,
uh,
glute glute meets.

701
00:38:13.901 --> 00:38:16.610
So I think one of the big things I would do is I would do at least two days a

702
00:38:16.611 --> 00:38:19.410
week of it,
but I have two different variations of it that,
uh,

703
00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.730
more and more research is coming to find that you actually want to train the

704
00:38:22.731 --> 00:38:27.440
glutamine,
um,
as much as you can and close chain.
So I have some exercises to,

705
00:38:27.441 --> 00:38:30.740
I'll also post to that youtube account to show you better close chain,

706
00:38:30.741 --> 00:38:34.340
which means feed on contact with the ground,
uh,
to,
to,
to folks on that glutamine.

707
00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:37.960
And it will do so maybe like,
you know,
seven we hips one,
one or two days a week.

708
00:38:37.961 --> 00:38:38.201
And then,

709
00:38:38.201 --> 00:38:41.860
and then a closed chain glutamine exercise the other day of the week I think

710
00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:42.694
would be perfect.

711
00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:47.900
<v 3>Great.
Yeah,
I know that Amelia Boone,
who also appears in tools of titans,</v>

712
00:38:47.901 --> 00:38:52.901
so three time world's toughest mudder champion does quite a bit of the closed

713
00:38:53.171 --> 00:38:56.160
chain glute made work awesome.

714
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.970
And I think videos would be super helpful there,
so we'll make sure that's up,
uh,

715
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:00.770
as well.

716
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:05.770
Now you did say that glute need one of those muscles that when week leads can

717
00:39:09.281 --> 00:39:12.850
commonly lead to injury.
What would you say for,

718
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:17.620
not necessarily professional athletes,
but just athletes per se,
right.

719
00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:22.270
Whether they're doing crossfit or Jujitsu or doesn't matter,
tennis,

720
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:25.180
fill in the blank,
right.
Someone who is a recreational athlete,

721
00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:30.810
what are some of the most common culprits in terms of whether it's imbalances or

722
00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:37.420
weaknesses that,
uh,
if,
if you were to put down a short list,

723
00:39:37.421 --> 00:39:41.860
like the four or five that when neglected are most responsible for the injuries

724
00:39:41.861 --> 00:39:44.800
that you see would blew me.
It'd be in that top four or five lists.

725
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:46.820
<v 2>Oh,
absolutely.
I think it would be to be in top two.</v>

726
00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:50.790
<v 3>Okay.
What's the other one in the top two ankle flection.
Ankle flection.</v>

727
00:39:50.791 --> 00:39:53.310
That is my nemesis right there.
Yeah.

728
00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:58.020
So no by ankle flection you basically mean that sort of Dorsiflex and rain brain

729
00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.400
and plan reflection.

730
00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:02.460
<v 2>Yeah.
And he and he version and version as well.
So I think,</v>

731
00:40:02.461 --> 00:40:06.070
I think the biggest thing is everything happens from the ground up.
So,
um,

732
00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.720
unless you're a swimmer,
obviously there's that,

733
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:10.460
that's the one kind of caveat here is that is that,
you know,

734
00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:13.310
with your feet in contact with the ground as an athlete or whether you're

735
00:40:13.311 --> 00:40:15.670
crossfitting or you're running or um,

736
00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:18.090
anything really at the end of the day where your feet are in contact with the

737
00:40:18.091 --> 00:40:22.480
ground,
number one place your look is his,
is his feet and ankle flection.

738
00:40:22.481 --> 00:40:25.270
So I think that's a big one,
especially with majority of athletes,
IC coming out,

739
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:28.970
uh,
angle fluctuates is really poor.
Um,

740
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.930
and something we focus a ton on because ultimately,

741
00:40:30.931 --> 00:40:32.930
ultimately everything's connected.
The fascial bodies connected.

742
00:40:32.931 --> 00:40:36.110
And so when there's an issue in the chain at some point,
other,

743
00:40:36.111 --> 00:40:39.340
other pieces up the chain or going to overcompensate.
So whether it be you know,

744
00:40:39.341 --> 00:40:43.960
more,
more attention and um,
uh,
on the knee joint or it moves up into the pelvis,

745
00:40:43.961 --> 00:40:45.790
it's going to always start at the feet.
So that's where I'll,

746
00:40:45.791 --> 00:40:50.480
I think number one is,
um,
and then gluten need a number two.

747
00:40:50.481 --> 00:40:54.050
I would say VMO being another one.
Um,
which is really hard to target.

748
00:40:54.051 --> 00:40:56.370
I think one of the big things about Vmo glute,

749
00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.910
pretty easy to isolate the most difficult.

750
00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:01.980
And one of the ways that I do that is in some of your training,

751
00:41:01.981 --> 00:41:03.320
which when you're,
when you're doing it,

752
00:41:03.321 --> 00:41:07.190
I think after you kind of burn through the quads,
the glutes and the hamstrings,

753
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:12.050
once your lower body begins to really fatigue is when you can then go in and

754
00:41:12.051 --> 00:41:15.740
target the [inaudible] and you have to be able to target them through,
uh,

755
00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:18.880
high high reps because you're going with,
you know,

756
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:23.210
you're only using your body weight,
doing some isolation exercises for the Vmo,

757
00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:25.160
like,
like the step downs that I talked about,

758
00:41:25.161 --> 00:41:27.500
which I'll share a video and I'll show one more other VMO exercise,

759
00:41:27.501 --> 00:41:29.150
which is really,
really good.
Um,

760
00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:32.510
you have to go higher rep high volume to be able to target it after you've

761
00:41:32.511 --> 00:41:33.980
already fatigued larger muscle groups

762
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.230
<v 4>because otherwise they'll overcompensate and take over the load.</v>

763
00:41:36.231 --> 00:41:39.740
So that's a big part of that.
Um,
to improve.

764
00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:41.860
<v 3>And is the,
is the step down,</v>

765
00:41:41.861 --> 00:41:46.420
is that also called the Peterson stepped down or is it technically different the

766
00:41:46.421 --> 00:41:47.254
way that

767
00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:51.820
<v 4>it very well,
could I,
I'd have to look that up,
but got 'em yeah,
imagine like,</v>

768
00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:53.500
like kind of a pistol squat on the,

769
00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:55.390
with one foot hanging over the side of a bench,

770
00:41:55.391 --> 00:41:57.790
but you're only going down to like a 45 degree angle,

771
00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:02.090
<v 3>right?
Yup.
Yeah.
Very cool.
All right,
we'll,
we'll make sure that is up.</v>

772
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:06.710
So you have ankle flection,
glute mead,
Vmo,
any other,
uh,

773
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:09.170
usual suspects that you find in that list?

774
00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.080
<v 4>Uh,
you know,
this one's not so much of a,</v>

775
00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:16.280
a muscle as much as it's just internal rotation of the femur.

776
00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:20.170
I think the big one of the,
the biggest,
uh,
imbalance,
the,

777
00:42:20.171 --> 00:42:23.260
one of the biggest things I find with the athletes I work with,

778
00:42:23.261 --> 00:42:27.010
number one is that they have minimal internal rotation of the Femur,

779
00:42:27.011 --> 00:42:31.940
which is very easily,
you know,
stretch it and you can,
you can find ways to,
to,
to,

780
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:34.600
to kind of create equal external,

781
00:42:34.601 --> 00:42:36.610
internal rotation of your femur within your pelvis.
But I,

782
00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.090
but most athletes come in to me,
you know,

783
00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:43.530
really turned out really lacking internal rotation when you watch a lot of slow

784
00:42:43.531 --> 00:42:46.260
motion video,
which I do a time with the athletes that train when you,

785
00:42:46.261 --> 00:42:49.630
when you're watching an ACL injury happened on the field of play.
Um,

786
00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:52.500
what you see is massive internal rotation of the femur and that's where the

787
00:42:52.501 --> 00:42:56.010
rupture occurs.
Internal rotation,
internal rotation of the Femur.

788
00:42:56.011 --> 00:42:57.300
So you see kind of the,
the,
the,
the,

789
00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:00.300
the knee cave in go into valgus and then that's where the,
the,
you know,
your,

790
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:04.870
your femur tries internally rotate.
If you have,
um,
range of motion there,

791
00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:08.460
you can internally rotate.
You're going to actually avoid an ACL.

792
00:43:08.461 --> 00:43:10.890
I have a couple of athletes that had took some big hits,
like a Russell Wilson,

793
00:43:10.891 --> 00:43:14.340
the quarterback for the Seahawks this year that played through an MCL injury

794
00:43:14.341 --> 00:43:17.910
that he took nine times out of 10 would have been an ACL tear.

795
00:43:17.911 --> 00:43:21.840
But based on his ability to internally rotate,
um,
he was able to avoid that.

796
00:43:21.841 --> 00:43:25.490
It was an MCL sprain.
He only,
he didn't even miss a practice actually with it.
Um,

797
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:28.770
I was a pretty brutal head,
but that was because of all of the work we do.

798
00:43:28.771 --> 00:43:29.510
So like,

799
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:33.090
like I always tell people is that I can't eliminate injuries with the athletes I

800
00:43:33.091 --> 00:43:37.800
train.
But what I can do is bring that probability as low as possible.
Um,

801
00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:40.020
which a lot,
hopefully it keeps them on the field,
you know,

802
00:43:40.021 --> 00:43:43.110
for long periods of time.
And for any given athlete,
you know,

803
00:43:43.111 --> 00:43:46.380
I mean the worst thing that could possibly happen is,
you know,
get injured.

804
00:43:46.381 --> 00:43:50.160
And so if you can lower that probability,
I mean that,
that that's the goal.

805
00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:55.610
<v 3>What is a good way to improve internal rotation of the femur?</v>

806
00:43:55.741 --> 00:43:59.670
And this,
this is probably also best shown by video,
but what would,
if you have,

807
00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:05.160
if it's possible to describe the sort of best bang for the buck that you have

808
00:44:05.521 --> 00:44:08.520
found,
what is a good way to improve internal rotation of the femur?

809
00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:09.581
<v 4>Sure.
There's,
there's a,</v>

810
00:44:09.581 --> 00:44:13.440
there's a fantastic stretch you can do up against a wall that I will show a

811
00:44:13.441 --> 00:44:16.530
video of.
It's really difficult to explain over over audio,
but I will,

812
00:44:16.531 --> 00:44:20.070
I promise you I'll post all these videos up so you guys have them,
um,
to see,

813
00:44:20.071 --> 00:44:23.340
but there's one you just basically back leaning against a wall,
um,

814
00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:25.950
that you can do that.
That is really helpful.

815
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:28.310
<v 3>Okay,
cool.
So we'll get that in there.</v>

816
00:44:28.311 --> 00:44:33.311
And then ankle flection possible to also share any best bang for the buck there.

817
00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:36.900
In terms of improving ankle flection,
this is one I really need personally.

818
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:40.410
<v 4>Yes,
there is a fantastic tool out there called a pro flex.</v>

819
00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:43.110
I have no association with them and they're going to be stoked.

820
00:44:43.111 --> 00:44:45.270
And I'm saying this,
but there's a basically

821
00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:47.620
<v 3>bro flex just like it sounds.</v>

822
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:51.440
<v 4>Yup.
It's a DCT pro flex and basically it's a board.
They created,</v>

823
00:44:51.441 --> 00:44:53.420
a physical therapist created it.
It's a board to be,

824
00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:56.750
to allow you to gain leverage with your,
with your calf.

825
00:44:56.910 --> 00:45:00.390
And so you put your foot into it,
looks like somewhat of a little boot,
um,

826
00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:02.250
and you put your,
your,

827
00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:06.810
your foot into it and then it allows you to stretch your calves and in multiple

828
00:45:06.811 --> 00:45:10.660
ways,
whether it's your tab or,
or gastric,
but it,

829
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:15.190
but it really focuses and helps you kind of get stretch and strengthen through

830
00:45:15.191 --> 00:45:17.470
the,
through the full range of motion planner in Dorsey flection,

831
00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:22.330
unlike anything I've tried out there.
Um,
and it's kind of phenomenal product,

832
00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:26.960
honestly,
and really easy to kind of,
um,
to,
to help you with the,
with the,

833
00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.153
that fluxion.

834
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.440
<v 3>All right.
Pro Flex.
First one's free.
That's on me.</v>

835
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:33.590
Then you sponsor the next podcast.
All right,

836
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:40.870
so,
uh,
this is related to mutual friend of ours.
Uh,

837
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:45.660
told me a story about how you told him Robert Griffin,
the third RG three,

838
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:49.020
which I thought was c three Po or a robot because I don't follow the team.

839
00:45:49.021 --> 00:45:51.840
Sports was not going to last very long.
The NFL,

840
00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:56.010
and you said it very early on in his rookie season.
How did,

841
00:45:56.011 --> 00:45:57.510
and it seems like that's going to be the case.

842
00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:01.950
So how did you know that he wouldn't last?
Or how did you suspect that?

843
00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:04.830
<v 4>So,
I mean,
you know,
when you,
when you look at,</v>

844
00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:08.250
it's very similar to how a doctor w w w would look at a patient if they were

845
00:46:08.251 --> 00:46:11.460
really going deep into and to kind of understanding what's going on with them.

846
00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:13.020
They look into past history.

847
00:46:13.021 --> 00:46:16.470
So you look into family history to look kind of into you past 10 years of,

848
00:46:16.471 --> 00:46:20.520
of daily habits,
nutrition,
uh,
exercise,
all of those things.

849
00:46:20.521 --> 00:46:22.110
And when you look at athletes and you,

850
00:46:22.111 --> 00:46:24.980
and you get an understanding of in the past and what they've been exposed to and

851
00:46:24.981 --> 00:46:27.770
what they do,
you kind of get it,
get it clear idea as to what a,

852
00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:31.440
they don't need to work on or what they're going to be,
you know,
at risk of,
um,

853
00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:34.080
moving,
moving forward.
And so,
uh,

854
00:46:34.081 --> 00:46:37.110
one of the big things was with RG three coming out was that he was known as a

855
00:46:37.111 --> 00:46:37.890
really fast athlete.

856
00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:41.820
He was actually an elite level world class track and field hurdler at Baylor.
Um,

857
00:46:41.821 --> 00:46:46.140
oh American actually.
And so,
um,
when he came out,

858
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:49.520
one of the things that I noticed quickly was that just based on looking at them

859
00:46:49.521 --> 00:46:52.550
just from an eye test,
you could see the imbalances between no power.

860
00:46:52.551 --> 00:46:55.100
You could create how fast he was.
And again,

861
00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:58.630
we go back to the amount of need and the type of training he was doing when

862
00:46:58.631 --> 00:47:01.180
you're a linear athlete looked like a track and field athlete running straight

863
00:47:01.181 --> 00:47:03.970
ahead for long periods of time.
And that's all you do and train.

864
00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:07.680
And then you transition to a sport like football where you're very,

865
00:47:07.681 --> 00:47:09.140
very fast because your track and field background,

866
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:11.430
but they can transition to football where everything's happening in different

867
00:47:11.431 --> 00:47:15.210
planes.
Um,
you know,
uh,
you're moving sagittal,

868
00:47:15.211 --> 00:47:19.680
frontal and transverse and it's a lot of multiplanar forces that are put onto

869
00:47:19.681 --> 00:47:23.070
the body that you have to train a very specific way to improve those.
And,

870
00:47:23.071 --> 00:47:27.390
and a big part with what he missed out on was just training in order to absorb

871
00:47:27.391 --> 00:47:31.840
those forces and in multiple planes that I knew would cause an ACL injury.

872
00:47:31.841 --> 00:47:33.100
And so,
um,

873
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:36.380
and then watching his training is you kind of post a lot about his training with

874
00:47:36.381 --> 00:47:40.190
like the heavy,
heavy,
deep squats that he was doing.
Um,
a lot of that,
I mean,

875
00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.570
ultimately he was fast enough,

876
00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:44.890
you didn't really need to train to continue to improve his explosiveness.

877
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:48.910
The dude already row was a worldclass hurdler.
He didn't need to improve that.

878
00:47:48.911 --> 00:47:50.080
What he needed to improve was,

879
00:47:50.081 --> 00:47:54.070
is ability to prevent and possibly avoid injury and,

880
00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:58.860
and so instantly by just understanding what type of imbalance as track and field

881
00:47:58.861 --> 00:48:01.790
athletes have and then transitioning that to what football,
what,
what,

882
00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:03.180
what stresses you're under in football.

883
00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:06.600
I could tell pretty quickly that he was at extremely high risk more than any

884
00:48:06.601 --> 00:48:09.810
other athlete I've assessed of,
of an injury.
And,
and unfortunately,

885
00:48:09.811 --> 00:48:13.450
ultimately it kind of panned out that way.
Um,
but,
but yeah,
you can,

886
00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:16.960
you can kind of get an idea of someone's kind of history and past of what,

887
00:48:16.961 --> 00:48:20.920
what they do and kind of some of their imbalances as to what injuries they're at

888
00:48:20.921 --> 00:48:21.754
high risk for.

889
00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:26.460
<v 3>I have a unrelated question than a very related question,
but before I forget,</v>

890
00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:29.010
I wanted to ask you because I was recently,

891
00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:34.290
I've had exposure to hex bars for a long time starting in college,
but I,

892
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:38.790
I was recently gifted my first personal hex bar and I have,

893
00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:43.620
I have it in my garage and my gym.
And there are two height settings.

894
00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:44.700
I'm sure you've seen this

895
00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:45.903
<v 4>where</v>

896
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:50.500
<v 3>one set of grips,
if one side is up is roughly the,</v>

897
00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:56.650
I would say the same height as the,
the rest of the bar so to speak,

898
00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:59.740
including where you're loading the plates and then there one that is slightly

899
00:48:59.741 --> 00:49:04.230
higher.
So my question for you is when you're doing hex bar dead lifts,
how,

900
00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:09.440
how many inches off the floor or how high are the grips that you would use for

901
00:49:10.871 --> 00:49:11.704
your athletes?

902
00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.120
<v 4>So I generally you've had handle high hand.
Okay.
I handle.</v>

903
00:49:15.121 --> 00:49:17.080
So there's a high handle,
low annual,
you generally use how he handled.

904
00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:18.750
The reason is because of the predominant,

905
00:49:18.751 --> 00:49:22.990
most of the athletes I'm working with her generally over five,
10 to five 11.
Um,

906
00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:25.650
and there are anywhere up to six,
seven.
So I,
I'm,

907
00:49:25.651 --> 00:49:29.680
I'm usually using high handle just because I don't need two.

908
00:49:30.250 --> 00:49:32.980
I don't need to put them in that type of flex.
I don't need them to be that deep.

909
00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:35.970
Um,
and,
and they're not that strong at that depth.
And the,

910
00:49:35.971 --> 00:49:39.100
one of the main reasons why is when you look at the athletes on a football
field,

911
00:49:39.101 --> 00:49:40.750
you rarely ever see them in those positions.

912
00:49:40.751 --> 00:49:43.510
So I'm not looking to just strengthen that range of motion.

913
00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:46.960
We will work to improve flexibility and strength in different ways,

914
00:49:46.961 --> 00:49:50.080
whether it be manually to get them in those full ranges of motion.

915
00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.240
But when I'm training the neurally it's more,

916
00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:55.000
I'm trying to increase the load as high as possible.

917
00:49:55.001 --> 00:49:58.650
When you think about the central nervous system,
it adapts to stress.
So if your,

918
00:49:58.651 --> 00:50:01.320
if your lower body's capable of pulling from a high handle x Bar,

919
00:50:01.321 --> 00:50:04.530
dead lift 500 pounds.
But in every other exercise that you do,

920
00:50:04.531 --> 00:50:07.770
you're only able to get to about three 80 or you actually stresses your nervous

921
00:50:07.771 --> 00:50:09.240
system to recruit larger Modi.
And it's,

922
00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:12.390
if you're only doing three 80 when you're capable of doing over 500.

923
00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.810
And what I found is the answer was no.
And so with the,
with the high handle,

924
00:50:15.811 --> 00:50:20.170
what you're able to do is increasing,
increasing,
um,
uh,

925
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:24.040
the degree of your femur and the position your pelvis and your spine and spine

926
00:50:24.041 --> 00:50:26.230
angle and all of that is that you're able to go heavier,

927
00:50:26.231 --> 00:50:29.610
which allows higher neural adaptation,
which you're going to treat,
look,

928
00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:31.490
recruit larger motor units.
And so that's what I'm,

929
00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:36.150
I'm using the hex bar dead lift,
not so much too,
you know,
increased,
you know,

930
00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:38.240
hip range of motion or anything like that.

931
00:50:38.241 --> 00:50:41.740
What I'm looking to do is stress the nervous system in such a way that it is,

932
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:44.600
has to recruit larger motor units in order to increase strength,

933
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:46.490
increased strength.
So that's the goal.

934
00:50:46.491 --> 00:50:49.000
And so with a high handle you can generally go have you and that's why I use it.

935
00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:53.940
<v 3>Got It.
So even for a,
uh,
a hobbit like me,
I'm like five,
eight,</v>

936
00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:55.770
five,
nine on a good day.

937
00:50:55.771 --> 00:50:58.950
If I'm like trying to put something on Tinder or something,
but

938
00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:05.040
he would you suggest in that case,
I do have kind of source arms though.

939
00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:07.470
So maybe that means I should also use the high handle.

940
00:51:07.471 --> 00:51:11.130
Would you still use that with the uh,
shorter athletes,

941
00:51:11.131 --> 00:51:13.350
people who are under five 10 or would you take them

942
00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:15.900
<v 4>and the lower handle?
I may take you to the lower handle,
but what,</v>

943
00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:18.910
but what I also may do is take you to lower handle then maybe add like one of

944
00:51:18.911 --> 00:51:22.270
those,
you know,
10 pound plates underneath it,
just to give you an extra edge.

945
00:51:22.271 --> 00:51:25.930
I don't want you too deep into it.
Like you would see like in a deep squat,

946
00:51:25.931 --> 00:51:27.760
I want you to be in somewhat of an athletic,

947
00:51:27.761 --> 00:51:31.030
like jumped position to where if you imagine like looking in the mirror from the

948
00:51:31.031 --> 00:51:32.500
side,
if you imagine jumping and you,

949
00:51:32.501 --> 00:51:35.200
you go to the depth of your jump and that's where you'd feel comfortable.

950
00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:35.900
Look in the mirror,

951
00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:39.220
see where that is and then align the handles to that because that's the athletic

952
00:51:39.221 --> 00:51:40.750
position and that's where I want you to be.
That's where,

953
00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:43.690
that's where you recruit.
You're going to recruit most or units.

954
00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:48.000
<v 3>And I've,
I've done more straight bar deadlift work than I have trap bar.</v>

955
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:52.290
Where should my hands be relative to my feet?

956
00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:55.770
In other words,
slightly ahead of my feet,

957
00:51:56.340 --> 00:51:59.540
a slow directly in line with the side of my ankles.

958
00:51:59.541 --> 00:52:04.310
Where do you suggest the,
uh,
the hands be?

959
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:07.850
<v 4>Yeah,
so I mean,
the one reason interesting thing about the head,</v>

960
00:52:07.851 --> 00:52:11.180
the straight bar is that what I found when in testing it is that it had a lot

961
00:52:11.181 --> 00:52:14.110
more to do with your posterior chain.
Um,
and,

962
00:52:14.111 --> 00:52:17.110
and what I love about the hex bar dead lift is that because of the position,

963
00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:18.910
the handles on the side of your body,
it kind of,
it's,

964
00:52:18.911 --> 00:52:21.800
it's more of an anatomically correct position and it allows your body to kind of

965
00:52:21.801 --> 00:52:26.120
recruit more of its,
it's skeletal muscle too to help you lift it.
And so,
uh,

966
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:28.940
basically basically you want the grip,
the middle of the handles,

967
00:52:28.941 --> 00:52:30.230
you see the handles has some knurling on it.

968
00:52:30.231 --> 00:52:31.400
You want to kind of grip in the middle but,

969
00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:35.210
but align your hands right next to the outsides of your leg so they should be

970
00:52:35.211 --> 00:52:37.510
pulling you straight up through into your hips.

971
00:52:37.511 --> 00:52:42.511
So you imagine drawing a straight line from your kind of a in your inner knee

972
00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:46.900
bent knee position from your,
your ankles,
shins to,
to up to your hips.

973
00:52:46.901 --> 00:52:50.600
That's where you want to be.
So it's kind of think more bar path than you do.
Um,

974
00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:55.330
kind of,
you know,
start position or anything like that,
like without weight,

975
00:52:55.331 --> 00:52:57.790
kind of go up and down a few times and kind of see the bar path.

976
00:52:57.791 --> 00:52:59.890
And that's where you're at.
Your,
your,
your alignment should be on the ground.

977
00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:02.160
<v 3>Got It.
Right.
So if you were to extend,</v>

978
00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:07.190
if you were to extend your hands in the proper position and do sort of a high

979
00:53:07.621 --> 00:53:12.450
bar back squat type of straight down a squat,

980
00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:12.840
you're,

981
00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:16.490
you're kind of middle fingers would be right at the bony process on the side,

982
00:53:16.491 --> 00:53:16.610
right?

983
00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:20.480
<v 4>Your ankles.
Got It.
That's the kind of alignment of the hands.</v>

984
00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:23.100
<v 3>Cool.
And last,
last on the trap bar,</v>

985
00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:28.680
how important is it to drop the weights of versus lower than very quickly.

986
00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:35.100
And,
and I'm not looking for a particular answer here.
The reason I ask is that I,

987
00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:40.120
I've seen people drop in quotation marks and I've done this to bar quickly

988
00:53:42.521 --> 00:53:46.480
versus drop because it takes them less time to reset and do another repetition.

989
00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:47.740
Uh,

990
00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:52.740
but that may just be increasing likelihood of injury with,

991
00:53:53.370 --> 00:53:57.720
with doing really rapid he centrix versus just dropping the weight.

992
00:53:58.110 --> 00:53:58.591
Uh,

993
00:53:58.591 --> 00:54:03.030
assuming that we can do either where we're training just pretty easy these days

994
00:54:03.031 --> 00:54:05.100
with the proliferation of crossfit boxes,

995
00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:10.590
it love dropping shit and crossfit boxes.
Uh,
what would your,

996
00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:11.880
what would your thoughts on that be?

997
00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:14.240
<v 4>Yeah.
You know,
so it all depends.</v>

998
00:54:14.241 --> 00:54:16.670
I think if the heavier I go with some of the athletes,
you know,

999
00:54:16.671 --> 00:54:18.530
the biggest limitation is their grip strength.

1000
00:54:18.531 --> 00:54:22.370
And so a lot of times I'll use raps,
um,
with them to be allow them to go heavier,

1001
00:54:22.371 --> 00:54:24.900
especially with the female athletes I train,
uh,

1002
00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:27.780
when they can get up to in the 400 range or high 300 is a lot of times their

1003
00:54:27.781 --> 00:54:30.900
grip strength there's isn't capable of,
of,
of holding out to the bar.

1004
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:34.140
And I don't want them to like increase their grip strength because I'm not

1005
00:54:34.141 --> 00:54:36.900
trying to add the mass.
So I add straps.

1006
00:54:36.901 --> 00:54:39.230
So with straps I'll generally have them like,
you know,

1007
00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.340
drop pretty quickly keeping their hands on the handle.

1008
00:54:41.341 --> 00:54:45.720
But for the most part it's more about efficiency and energy expenditure.
Sure.

1009
00:54:45.721 --> 00:54:49.260
So I'm looking at it if it's going to require a lot of energy for you to like,

1010
00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:52.500
so to go down with the bar and drop with it and tried to get back into position

1011
00:54:52.501 --> 00:54:53.130
quickly.

1012
00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:56.700
I'm more looking for effort on every single rep concentrically than I am kind
of,

1013
00:54:57.020 --> 00:55:00.930
um,
uh,
faster up.
So really ultimately comes down to you.
If you,
if you're a,

1014
00:55:00.931 --> 00:55:04.050
if you're good and you really quick and can get back into position fast,
uh,

1015
00:55:04.051 --> 00:55:06.180
by keeping your hands on the handle and just dropping with the bar,

1016
00:55:06.181 --> 00:55:08.730
then I'm fine with that.
I've athletes that do that all the time.

1017
00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:09.780
I think it's just more than anything,

1018
00:55:09.781 --> 00:55:13.290
it comes down to kind of comfort level with it.
And,
um,
more than anything,

1019
00:55:13.291 --> 00:55:15.360
not expending too much energy in the lowering of the bar.

1020
00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:19.390
<v 3>Got It.
And do you have any preferred straps?
The users?</v>

1021
00:55:19.391 --> 00:55:20.800
Just the old school.

1022
00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:24.500
<v 4>Cool cloth straps.
Those are my favorite.</v>

1023
00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:27.330
<v 3>Got It.
All right.
So I promise I would,</v>

1024
00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:31.590
I would reel us back to what we're talking about.

1025
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:34.140
And,
uh,
we talked about ACL,

1026
00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:38.400
so I recently had my first ACL injury.

1027
00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:41.850
There may be more to it.
I did get Mris.
This was about three months ago.

1028
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:46.470
I was hiking in Colorado with a number of guys,

1029
00:55:46.471 --> 00:55:50.340
very aggressive terrain,
45 degrees up,

1030
00:55:50.341 --> 00:55:52.810
45 degrees down,
lots of,
uh,
sh,
uh,

1031
00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:57.330
shale and so on and loaded backpacks.

1032
00:55:57.331 --> 00:56:01.650
And I stepped up onto a log that was about a fallen tree that was,

1033
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:05.370
I'll say three feet in diameter,
something like that.

1034
00:56:05.371 --> 00:56:08.790
I stepped up and as I went to step off with my left leg,

1035
00:56:08.791 --> 00:56:13.500
my right leg went through the tree and basically caught right below the knee and

1036
00:56:13.501 --> 00:56:16.920
I hyper extended the knee.
It wasn't catastrophic.

1037
00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:21.120
I was able to continue to hike,
but uh,

1038
00:56:21.121 --> 00:56:26.121
had incredible pain for weeks afterwards and had trouble even walking down

1039
00:56:26.561 --> 00:56:27.730
stairs or walking around.

1040
00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:32.020
I kind of had to peg leg around and we're three months out.
Uh,

1041
00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:33.160
I can,

1042
00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:37.450
I can do controlled dead lifts even up to,

1043
00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:42.160
I haven't gone crazy,
but I can get over 300 without any,
uh,

1044
00:56:42.161 --> 00:56:43.720
exhibiting any symptoms of pain.

1045
00:56:43.721 --> 00:56:48.721
But I do have sub patellar soreness and this lingering concern about ACL,

1046
00:56:49.930 --> 00:56:50.201
uh,

1047
00:56:50.201 --> 00:56:55.201
I have some plans to ski coming up in a few weeks and I am concerned about it.

1048
00:56:57.361 --> 00:57:00.510
This is the first time I've had knee issues per se.

1049
00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:03.210
I've had a lot of quad issues where I've torn my legs apart,

1050
00:57:03.211 --> 00:57:06.990
but neat like structural knee issues.
This is relatively new for me.

1051
00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:10.400
So I guess there's,
there's a short term question and a long term questions.

1052
00:57:10.401 --> 00:57:14.940
Short term is I don't feel like I have a ton of lateral instability,

1053
00:57:14.941 --> 00:57:17.640
but I also don't really know what the hell I'm talking about because I've never

1054
00:57:17.641 --> 00:57:19.530
thought about it.
I've never worried about it before.

1055
00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:25.070
So how would you assess whether or not I should ski or not?

1056
00:57:26.051 --> 00:57:30.550
Ski would be short term and then longer term is what are some,

1057
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:34.180
some good ways to minimize,
uh,

1058
00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:36.880
well actually to rehab an ACL injury?

1059
00:57:37.410 --> 00:57:40.650
<v 4>Yeah.
So again,
I still don't know if they'd go therapist.
So,
so number one,</v>

1060
00:57:40.651 --> 00:57:43.020
I don't want to prescribed anything to you to,
you know,

1061
00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:45.970
without kind of a food physical therapist in their hands on you,
I'm sure.

1062
00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:49.870
But I do think,
I mean,
look,
I think physical therapy is,
is an amazing field.

1063
00:57:49.871 --> 00:57:52.920
I think there's a lot a lot happening there that I think will become one of the

1064
00:57:52.921 --> 00:57:57.120
larger kind of more and more performance will be going towards physical therapy

1065
00:57:57.121 --> 00:58:00.470
then then it will be going the old school kind of powerlifting route.

1066
00:58:00.471 --> 00:58:03.680
And so I think,
you know,
if you can get into a local physical therapist,

1067
00:58:03.681 --> 00:58:04.700
I think that would be ideal.

1068
00:58:04.701 --> 00:58:09.470
I think one of the big things is I find is if it's not a rupture of the ACL,

1069
00:58:09.471 --> 00:58:13.430
it could be,
you know,
some sort of a,
the no grade too,

1070
00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:17.100
one or two sprain sprain of the MCL,
which you know,
is,

1071
00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:21.530
is all kind of worked through by movement and Rehab.
So I think any type of,

1072
00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:21.891
you know,

1073
00:58:21.891 --> 00:58:25.910
non weighted stability strength you can do with the VMO and the quad would be

1074
00:58:25.911 --> 00:58:29.450
ideal and also of the glute need.
Um,
but I would kind of,

1075
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:31.900
if best you can't get under some professional guidance for that,

1076
00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:34.730
like at a local physical therapist,
if you have one nearby or buddy of yours,

1077
00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:39.470
that's one.
Um,
but,
but I think a good test would just kind of be,
um,

1078
00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:43.030
lightly,
you know,
testing.
It was just some like light hopping or,

1079
00:58:43.031 --> 00:58:45.490
or some light like jumping and landing on your,

1080
00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:49.230
your single leg forward and back and under it's feeling if so how much pain you

1081
00:58:49.231 --> 00:58:53.550
have there for the most part.
But,
but I definitely just get,
get it checked out.

1082
00:58:53.551 --> 00:58:57.390
I think that sounds,
I mean hyper extension is difficult because it's again,

1083
00:58:57.391 --> 00:58:59.940
what one of the biggest things is I'm trying to help the athletes avoid is,

1084
00:59:00.030 --> 00:59:02.900
is noncontact knee injuries.
But when you have something that's like,
you know,

1085
00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:06.510
that shearing force jarring that,
that,
that femur forward and in the joint,

1086
00:59:06.511 --> 00:59:10.130
which is probably what happened when you're hyper extended it.
Um,
that's,

1087
00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.810
those are,
those are tough.
Those are tough to understand.
Kind of all the,

1088
00:59:12.811 --> 00:59:15.720
all the different forces that went onto kind of caused that.
So I don't know,

1089
00:59:15.721 --> 00:59:19.230
I mean,
but if you're not in,
in a,
in a,
if you're feeling pretty decent,

1090
00:59:19.231 --> 00:59:20.370
you're still able to deadlift you said.

1091
00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:24.130
<v 3>Yeah,
I'm still a little deadlift.
I deadlifted yesterday with like mid,</v>

1092
00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:25.840
mid 300 without any pain,

1093
00:59:25.841 --> 00:59:30.841
but I was doing partial range of movement pulling basically to just above the

1094
00:59:31.061 --> 00:59:33.900
knee from the floor.
This is a straight bar,
uh,

1095
00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:37.910
and dropping because I didn't want to risk,
uh,

1096
00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:41.550
any type of hamstring injury.
And if I lift to the top,

1097
00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:43.680
I'm probably going to be lowering it quickly.

1098
00:59:43.681 --> 00:59:47.520
I just want to avoid the potential of east centric Lee loading my hamstrings and

1099
00:59:47.521 --> 00:59:50.790
some stupid way.
Uh,
so I was,
yeah,

1100
00:59:50.850 --> 00:59:53.850
mid three hundreds pulling to just above the knee and then dropping.

1101
00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:56.370
And these were relatively,
uh,

1102
00:59:58.060 --> 00:59:59.760
they're low rep range,
so two,

1103
00:59:59.770 --> 01:00:04.460
three reps and then longer rest periods.
But yeah,
no

1104
01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:10.250
for all intensive purposes.
Asymptomatic after that.
Like I feel fine today.
Yeah.

1105
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:13.550
<v 4>Yeah.
So I mean,
God's going to tell me if you just have a sprain,</v>

1106
01:00:13.551 --> 01:00:14.660
but I would go to get checked out.

1107
01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.130
<v 3>Yep.
Okay,
cool.
Uh,
question.</v>

1108
01:00:17.131 --> 01:00:20.880
So we've talked about exercises that are,

1109
01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:25.970
hi Roy exercises that can help prevent injury.

1110
01:00:25.971 --> 01:00:28.100
We talked about the ankle flection of the pro flex.

1111
01:00:28.101 --> 01:00:32.270
We talked about glutamine and the seven way hip,
the Vmo and the uh,

1112
01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:36.200
step downs,
internal rotation of the femur and the weird,
it's not weird,

1113
01:00:36.201 --> 01:00:39.140
it's just hard to describe an audio.
We'll the wall stretch,

1114
01:00:39.141 --> 01:00:41.260
which we'll get video for if

1115
01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:46.850
there are people who would argue I'm not one of them really,

1116
01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.420
but that any exercise done properly can be done safely.

1117
01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.700
That having been said,

1118
01:00:52.701 --> 01:00:57.160
there are exercises that seem to produce more injuries than others.
Right.
So if,

1119
01:00:57.190 --> 01:01:00.800
if you were talking not about elite athletes,

1120
01:01:00.801 --> 01:01:05.480
but just a aspiring athletes or weekend warriors in general,
right?

1121
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:10.160
You have a thousand people and you want to decrease injuries as much as
possible.

1122
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:15.400
What exercises would you re or machines or anything would you remove from gyms?

1123
01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:22.520
<v 4>100% would be the knee extension machine,
knee extension,</v>

1124
01:01:22.890 --> 01:01:27.090
100% that that machine is the worst for you can possibly imagine.

1125
01:01:28.410 --> 01:01:29.400
Okay,
good to know.

1126
01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.450
They're there in every gym and I think it's kind of like they have to be,

1127
01:01:33.451 --> 01:01:37.350
but I would never do a knee extension machine ever again.

1128
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.530
<v 3>Got It.
Okay.
So knee extension out the knee extension is what any,</v>

1129
01:01:42.531 --> 01:01:45.890
any runner,
runner runners up,
um,

1130
01:01:45.891 --> 01:01:48.320
in terms of machines or it doesn't have to do a machine.

1131
01:01:48.321 --> 01:01:51.080
It could be an exercise you some,
any,

1132
01:01:51.081 --> 01:01:56.081
any exercise that is just not worth the hazard or potential risk of injury.

1133
01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:58.921
<v 4>Yeah.
You know,
I,
I've,</v>

1134
01:01:58.921 --> 01:02:01.800
I've actually worked with a lot of Olympic committees all over the world and one

1135
01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:05.040
of the one things I always do when I'm with them as I go and seek out the

1136
01:02:05.041 --> 01:02:08.130
Olympic lifting coach and kind of just pick his brain and talk him to them.

1137
01:02:08.131 --> 01:02:10.470
And you know,
kind of across the board,

1138
01:02:10.471 --> 01:02:13.890
Olympic lifting coaches would tell you to not Olympic lift unless you're an

1139
01:02:13.891 --> 01:02:14.491
Olympic lifter.

1140
01:02:14.491 --> 01:02:17.190
And the one reason they would say that is because they take elite level Olympic

1141
01:02:17.191 --> 01:02:21.810
lifters and take around two years to teach them the technique and a certain

1142
01:02:22.290 --> 01:02:24.940
lift,
whether it be the clean and jerk or to clean,
you know,

1143
01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:26.580
whatever overhead squat,
whatever it might be.

1144
01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:31.210
I think the biggest thing I would say in terms of,
uh,
that I,

1145
01:02:31.211 --> 01:02:33.930
and I trained a couple of crossfitters and I've actually just started doing

1146
01:02:33.931 --> 01:02:37.800
crossfit recently just because the crossroads I started training.
Uh,

1147
01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:40.260
we're given me so much crap that I've never done it,
that I was like,
fine,

1148
01:02:40.261 --> 01:02:42.840
I'll give it a shot and I'll,
you know,
whatever,
because I can't,

1149
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:46.440
I can't talk trash about them unless I do it.
Uh,
so I'm,
I'm currently doing that,

1150
01:02:46.441 --> 01:02:48.240
so I actually am enjoying it.

1151
01:02:48.241 --> 01:02:51.870
But I would say with my background in and actually science and training for so

1152
01:02:51.871 --> 01:02:55.710
long,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm competent in those,
in those lifts that I feel safe.
I can,

1153
01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:58.710
I can do them,
but I'm Wa when I'm watching people doing overhead squatting,

1154
01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:03.090
it just,
it kills me.
Like I sleep,
I can't do it.

1155
01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:08.270
And I see so many people who are just waiting for some sort of injury that,

1156
01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.320
uh,
that it just kills me.

1157
01:03:10.321 --> 01:03:12.720
So I would just say if you're going to get into cross where you're going to get

1158
01:03:12.721 --> 01:03:14.250
into any type of Olympic lifting,

1159
01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:18.990
really seek out somebody who's Olympic lifting certified that can help you,

1160
01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:21.650
you know,
you saw certified to help you,
um,

1161
01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:25.120
learn how to do it properly and take your time learning it before you jump into

1162
01:03:25.121 --> 01:03:27.110
it.
There's a lot of variations you can do.
Um,

1163
01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:29.280
that's what I always tell the athletes I work with too.
They're like,
well wait,

1164
01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:32.820
we don't power clean.
And I'm like,
no,
if I can get,
if I can do other exercises,

1165
01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:36.740
get the same result,
but,
but pull back all of the risk of injury.
Why,

1166
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.000
why wouldn't I do that?
Like,
I'm not trying to get you,

1167
01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:40.480
I'm not training you to be a good lift.

1168
01:03:40.481 --> 01:03:42.550
I'm turning you to be a good football player or basketball player,
tennis player.

1169
01:03:42.551 --> 01:03:46.830
I'm not training you to be a great,
you know,
lift or so,
so more than anything,

1170
01:03:46.831 --> 01:03:49.590
it's trying to try to eliminate the risk of injury as much as possible.

1171
01:03:49.591 --> 01:03:51.870
So I would say if you're going to go and Olympic lifting crossfit,

1172
01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:55.530
really learn how to do that lift and take your time to do it before you jumped

1173
01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:59.700
into the classes and just go for,
you know,
five rounds of,
you know,

1174
01:03:59.701 --> 01:04:03.120
20 overhead squats.
Um,
and then the second would be the knee,

1175
01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:06.990
knee extension machines in the gym is the worst possible.
She,
you can,

1176
01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:07.853
you can ever do

1177
01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:12.190
<v 3>besides the trap bar dead lift.
And I know we've already mentioned a few of the,</v>

1178
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:14.430
besides the,
the,
the hex bar dead lift.

1179
01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:19.730
If you had to pick one exercise two or stretch to have everyone do,

1180
01:04:21.091 --> 01:04:24.280
if you want it to one shot,
one kill,
treaded,

1181
01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:28.230
decrease injuries across the board and it,

1182
01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:32.880
or as many injuries as possible for say a group of a thousand people,

1183
01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:36.450
what would a,
what would you have them do?

1184
01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:41.610
<v 4>Oh,
that's a good question.
I mean,
uh,
I mean seven way hips,</v>

1185
01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:44.250
the one you put in until the signs.
I think it would be a really,
really good one.

1186
01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:47.020
Uh,
for most people did to jump in and do it.
But if we're looking at like nuts,

1187
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:50.880
some exercise I came up with in my room trying to torture people,

1188
01:04:50.881 --> 01:04:54.210
I think something that's common,
I would say a Bulgarian split squat.

1189
01:04:54.211 --> 01:04:57.770
I really like.
Um,
I,
I also really like box squatting.

1190
01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:01.640
I think box squat is a great way to kind of teach somebody that proper

1191
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:06.470
sequencing and movement,
um,
without,
you know,
putting them at risk of,

1192
01:05:06.550 --> 01:05:08.240
of injury.
So,
um,

1193
01:05:08.330 --> 01:05:11.660
I think those two would be good exercises for people to go start with.

1194
01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.910
And let's see,
massive improvement in

1195
01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:18.010
<v 3>what height box would you have someone start with a generally just you</v>

1196
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:19.180
<v 4>want to look in the side of the mirror,</v>

1197
01:05:19.181 --> 01:05:22.120
sit down on a box and you're looking for a 90 degree angle.

1198
01:05:22.540 --> 01:05:25.000
<v 3>I got it.
All right,
so you're looking for nine degree angle,</v>

1199
01:05:25.001 --> 01:05:28.800
meaning quads parallel to the ground.
Okay,
got it.
Yeah.

1200
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:32.250
All right.
Now the,
so this,

1201
01:05:32.251 --> 01:05:37.251
this is something I'd love to dig into and this relates to a story of how you

1202
01:05:37.541 --> 01:05:41.170
helped meb and you're going to have to pronounce this guy's last name for me.

1203
01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:44.050
I could fluffy Husky.
All right.

1204
01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.950
Train for his incredible Boston marathon victory.

1205
01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.650
So can you explain for us,

1206
01:05:50.651 --> 01:05:54.760
maybe tell the story of what inspired you to apply your sprinting insights to

1207
01:05:54.761 --> 01:05:56.500
marathoner and how you trained him?

1208
01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:58.220
<v 4>Yeah,
I mean just really,</v>

1209
01:05:58.221 --> 01:06:01.720
really simply stride length and frequency is product of mass specific forest.

1210
01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:03.540
If you can help somebody increase their mass specific force,

1211
01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:07.210
naturally those two things are going to occur when you're a marathon runner on

1212
01:06:07.211 --> 01:06:10.180
average will take around 20,000 strides to run a marathon.
Well,

1213
01:06:10.181 --> 01:06:13.150
if I can increase your stride length because of increasing your math specific

1214
01:06:13.151 --> 01:06:16.390
force and your normal running gait by two by three inches,
let's say,
right?

1215
01:06:16.391 --> 01:06:18.230
So big increase,
three inches on every,

1216
01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:20.130
in your normal running great in your stride length,

1217
01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:23.790
three inches times 20,000 and 6,000 inches,
which is around 5,000 feet,

1218
01:06:23.791 --> 01:06:24.930
which is close to a mile.

1219
01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:28.380
So you're a mile ahead of where you were last time you ran that marathon,

1220
01:06:28.381 --> 01:06:30.990
just purely by increasing your mass specific force.
It's that simple.

1221
01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:32.760
<v 3>Got It.
And what,</v>

1222
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:37.320
how did your training differ if at all,

1223
01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:42.550
for Med versus your sprinter?
Mean,

1224
01:06:42.770 --> 01:06:46.860
sprinters,
meaning track and field or football players fill in the blank.

1225
01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.580
<v 4>Yeah.
So,
so,
so,
um,</v>

1226
01:06:50.550 --> 01:06:53.490
majority of marathoners don't have,

1227
01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:57.420
don't have a kind of desire to get in the weight room and strength train.

1228
01:06:57.421 --> 01:06:58.680
I think a lot of eh,
you know,

1229
01:06:58.770 --> 01:07:02.460
kind of for a long time thought has been that it can only go to,

1230
01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.350
to hurt you and injure you or add size,

1231
01:07:04.351 --> 01:07:06.000
which is what most marathoners don't want.

1232
01:07:06.001 --> 01:07:10.930
And so the biggest thing was just teaching him that bye.
Hex Bar,
dead lift,

1233
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:13.790
you know,
training and just the concentric zone only.

1234
01:07:13.791 --> 01:07:17.970
So not doing no he eccentric loading that he can eat again.
Stresses,

1235
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:21.970
nervous system,
recruit motor units without larger mornings,
without adding any,

1236
01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:26.270
any weight.
So you started at 127 pounds,
ended on 127 pounds and,

1237
01:07:26.271 --> 01:07:30.880
and um,
by just that one exercise I didn't touch is running.

1238
01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:32.770
I didn't touch anything else that he did in the weight room.

1239
01:07:32.771 --> 01:07:37.480
It was just simply that one exercise once a week.
Um,
it improved his,
his,

1240
01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:41.230
his started like this running game in turn helped him run faster.

1241
01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:45.370
<v 3>Love it.
I love the simplicity of it.
I mean,
super efficient.</v>

1242
01:07:45.371 --> 01:07:47.650
Simple doesn't mean easy,
but,
no,

1243
01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:50.910
<v 4>I think,
I mean,
I,
I think,
you know,
one of the things I've,</v>

1244
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.930
I've always kind of really loved about what you,

1245
01:07:52.931 --> 01:07:55.720
what you're doing and it's the same kind of approach I take and you look a lot

1246
01:07:55.721 --> 01:07:58.270
of people that they're successful in what they do.

1247
01:07:58.271 --> 01:08:00.730
I think they take that team approach as you look at patterns or you just look at

1248
01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:03.220
when you're trying to do is you're just trying to look at the most important

1249
01:08:03.221 --> 01:08:06.130
things you can actually have control over to improve,
um,
that,

1250
01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.890
that has the greatest effect the most amount of ways.

1251
01:08:08.891 --> 01:08:11.440
But with the simplest approach is just keep it as simple as possible.

1252
01:08:11.441 --> 01:08:13.210
And I think that really not only helps the,

1253
01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:15.230
I mean elite level athletes but helps everyday people.

1254
01:08:15.231 --> 01:08:17.960
I think that's the biggest misconception.
I always have people ask me,
you know,

1255
01:08:17.961 --> 01:08:20.660
well what's,
well they're elite athletes and um,
you know,

1256
01:08:20.661 --> 01:08:23.480
when I started working with Nike,
you know,
well yeah,
but you know,

1257
01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:26.060
take apart what you do with elite level athletes and apply that to,

1258
01:08:26.210 --> 01:08:27.440
to everyday people.
And um,

1259
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:30.320
and what I always try to say is that there's nothing different.
I mean,

1260
01:08:30.321 --> 01:08:34.730
with the exception of they may be genetically predisposed to have greater talent

1261
01:08:34.731 --> 01:08:37.490
and catching a ball or throwing a ball fast or running faster or whatever it

1262
01:08:37.491 --> 01:08:41.660
might be.
Ultimately their time in their day is the same as yours there.

1263
01:08:41.690 --> 01:08:46.620
Their ability to,
and the how hard certain workouts are the same as yours.
Um,

1264
01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:48.740
it's just that,
you know,
they're,
they're true.

1265
01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.950
Maybe training for just a little bit of a different purpose so they're still

1266
01:08:51.951 --> 01:08:54.710
looking for the most bang for their buck and trying to,
you know,

1267
01:08:54.770 --> 01:08:57.980
keep it as simple as possible even though there are elite just like the everyday

1268
01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:58.843
are

1269
01:08:59.470 --> 01:09:01.840
<v 3>definitely.
What do you,
uh,
you mentioned Nike.</v>

1270
01:09:01.841 --> 01:09:04.800
What are you working on at Nike that you can talk about?

1271
01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:07.450
I know there's some stuff that's probably off the table,
but what else?

1272
01:09:07.451 --> 01:09:10.390
Absolutely general,
what have you been recruited to do?

1273
01:09:11.590 --> 01:09:14.210
<v 4>I think the biggest thing is just is that the,</v>

1274
01:09:14.230 --> 01:09:17.210
the performance training and fitness fueled is,
it's,

1275
01:09:17.850 --> 01:09:21.700
it's growing really quickly.
I think,
um,
people are,
are,

1276
01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:24.500
are really starting to understand how important fitness is for their overall

1277
01:09:24.501 --> 01:09:26.680
health.
And,
and so I think what,
um,

1278
01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:29.090
my role at Nike as a senior director of performances is to,

1279
01:09:29.091 --> 01:09:30.860
is to really help kind of bring,

1280
01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:35.290
bring in and using like the Nike trainer network or the performance council of

1281
01:09:35.291 --> 01:09:39.620
some of the top minds in the field to help kind of funnel information and in

1282
01:09:39.621 --> 01:09:44.390
training,
um,
modalities and ideas and workouts into an app,

1283
01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:49.550
uh,
experience for everyone to be able to,
to use and,
and kind of,
um,

1284
01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:52.260
as a way.
So it's a free app called Nike Training Club,

1285
01:09:52.261 --> 01:09:56.220
which I'm working on it basically a personal trainer,
your pocket.
So,
uh,

1286
01:09:56.221 --> 01:09:59.250
our goal is there's different technology or will be coming out with soon that

1287
01:09:59.251 --> 01:10:03.360
we'll be able to give you really in depth assessment of um,
you,
you know,

1288
01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:06.090
where you're starting from,
your imbalances,
weaknesses,
those types of things,

1289
01:10:06.091 --> 01:10:09.490
and then kind of prescribe a training program using algorithms that will be

1290
01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:12.460
unique to you and helping you improve whatever you're trying to prove.

1291
01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:16.110
Whether it's weight loss or strength gain or getting ripped or running a faster,

1292
01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:17.740
you know,
half marathon or,

1293
01:10:17.770 --> 01:10:20.050
or if you're a game day athletes at the high school level trying to make your

1294
01:10:20.051 --> 01:10:23.310
football team,
um,
it's going to be a,
you know,

1295
01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:26.760
geared and you unique for you based on your assessment.
So,
um,

1296
01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.660
just kind of bringing together the best minds in the field that I,

1297
01:10:29.661 --> 01:10:32.150
that I can bring together and then Nike can bring together to kind of deliver

1298
01:10:32.151 --> 01:10:34.760
that through a digital experiences is,
is the goal.

1299
01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:38.100
<v 3>Cool.
Can't wait to check it out.
Yeah.
We were talking,</v>

1300
01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:42.660
you mentioned earlier your eye's bleeding when you watch people doing horrific

1301
01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:44.310
overhead squat attempts,

1302
01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.000
especially if they're trying to do as many reps as possible.

1303
01:10:48.001 --> 01:10:51.870
In a minute or after they're already about to pick their brains out or something

1304
01:10:51.871 --> 01:10:54.360
like that.
Uh,
which by the way,

1305
01:10:54.361 --> 01:10:58.440
people wandering a lot harder to do a proper overhead squat than you would think

1306
01:10:58.441 --> 01:11:02.490
you need.
Uh,
well most people would need very good ankle flection,

1307
01:11:02.491 --> 01:11:04.680
really good thoracic mobility so that they,

1308
01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:09.420
they're not completely destroying their shoulders.
Uh,
besides that,

1309
01:11:09.450 --> 01:11:12.990
what other things,
and it could be anything.
It doesn't have to be exercises.

1310
01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:16.620
What other stuff drives you crazy when you see it at a gym?

1311
01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:17.743
<v 2>Good question.</v>

1312
01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:20.900
<v 3>Besides,
besides guys and like affliction,
tee shirts,</v>

1313
01:11:20.901 --> 01:11:25.400
doing preacher curls while they stare into their eyes in the mirror besides
that.

1314
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:27.463
Oh Man,

1315
01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:32.990
<v 2>I have a funny story on that.
And uh,
you know,
I think,</v>

1316
01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:37.240
I think the biggest,
what I hate,
I hate people running on treadmills.

1317
01:11:37.241 --> 01:11:41.520
That's number one.
Uh,
why do you hate people running on treadmills?
Uh,
just,
I,

1318
01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:45.150
I just think it promotes,
uh,
bad running mechanics.
I think it's,

1319
01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:48.260
it's just people kind of tend to like roll that way when they,

1320
01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:50.370
there's a street right outside,
they can just go run on.

1321
01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.870
And there's a lot of technology out there that helps them track and I get an

1322
01:11:53.871 --> 01:11:57.010
idea of exactly what they're doing.
I've tried to just on the road,
but,
um,

1323
01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:59.340
I think,
you know,
I don't know.
That's tough.

1324
01:11:59.341 --> 01:12:03.790
I think I've already told you about leg extension machine.
That one kills me.
Um,

1325
01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:07.490
what else?
Ah,
okay.
Well the good,

1326
01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:12.540
I can't go to a high school or younger bath game to watch people run it.

1327
01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:17.740
It drives me absolutely crazy.
Like I can't watch people run,
um,

1328
01:12:18.230 --> 01:12:21.410
that haven't been taught how to run properly and they're just,
you know,

1329
01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:24.590
doing bud kicks behind them all backside mechanic that like,

1330
01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:28.820
just watching people,
not how to run no outer run properly is my pet peeve.

1331
01:12:28.821 --> 01:12:30.980
I think that that one,

1332
01:12:30.981 --> 01:12:33.770
I have a hard really hard time or like you when to watch somebody going on a run

1333
01:12:33.771 --> 01:12:35.810
on the side of the road and like I really just want to pull over,

1334
01:12:35.811 --> 01:12:38.630
stop and get out the car and just work on their mechanics with them just for

1335
01:12:38.631 --> 01:12:43.100
like five minutes and then will save them so much pain and an injury that,
um,

1336
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:45.950
and most of it's just by overstriding I think biggest,

1337
01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:47.470
<v 3>could you explain what you mean by that?</v>

1338
01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.630
<v 2>Oh,
so when you thinking about,
I talked about earlier,</v>

1339
01:12:50.631 --> 01:12:52.860
when you think about foot strike,
when the,

1340
01:12:52.861 --> 01:12:56.260
when the foot strikes way out front in front of your pelvis and when your foot

1341
01:12:56.261 --> 01:12:59.390
law one pond ground ground contact is out in front of your pelvis from when

1342
01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:02.380
you're looking at somebody from the side.
Um,
that's,

1343
01:13:02.410 --> 01:13:05.380
that's overstriding and I think that's the number one cause of injury and static

1344
01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:08.110
running when you,
if you talked to a lot of physical therapists,
um,

1345
01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:11.490
and so just that alone,
if you could help fix overstriding,

1346
01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:15.360
that would help eliminate a ton of injury in static runner.
So that's right.

1347
01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:16.430
<v 3>Kind of a mission of mine.</v>

1348
01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:19.820
What are some of the tips that you would give in those five minutes to fix

1349
01:13:19.821 --> 01:13:23.840
overstriding?
Is it more forward lean?
Is it,

1350
01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:27.110
I have no idea.
I'm not a runner,
but what would your,

1351
01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:28.880
I know a lot of people who are certainly,

1352
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:32.360
what would some of the recommendations be that you would give that person in

1353
01:13:32.361 --> 01:13:35.750
your five minutes once you've convinced them you weren't going to Mug them or

1354
01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:38.390
that you weren't completely insane?

1355
01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:41.650
<v 2>Well,
that's the hard part I think is that it's difficult to do it.
I mean,</v>

1356
01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:44.920
a lot of times I was just telling him my NFL combine is the other day they were,

1357
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:46.840
they were asking me like,
what?
You know what you're teaching me?

1358
01:13:46.841 --> 01:13:50.050
It feels so uncomfortable and awkward and I was like,
exactly your slow.

1359
01:13:50.051 --> 01:13:52.810
So therefore being fast should feel uncomfortable and awkward.

1360
01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.390
We're placing facet full,
uncomfortable,
awkward.

1361
01:13:55.391 --> 01:13:57.430
We'd have our problem because you're not,
you're good.

1362
01:13:57.431 --> 01:13:58.840
I think that's the hard part is that it should,

1363
01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:02.470
it should feel a little bit awkward and uncomfortable when you first start doing

1364
01:14:02.471 --> 01:14:02.801
it.
Right.

1365
01:14:02.801 --> 01:14:05.530
So it's difficult to do it on your own without somebody watching you from the

1366
01:14:05.531 --> 01:14:09.430
side.
But generally it's just the feeling of your foot landing almost,

1367
01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:12.070
almost behind you,
like directly you or behind you.
And

1368
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:14.380
<v 4>you'll know most likely it's,
it's landing someone underneath you.</v>

1369
01:14:14.381 --> 01:14:18.280
So kind of get that feeling of,
of foot placement underneath you or behind you.

1370
01:14:18.281 --> 01:14:19.690
And I think that'll,
that'll help a lot.

1371
01:14:19.691 --> 01:14:21.490
Just don't reach out in front of you to run.

1372
01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:26.210
<v 3>Got It.
What,
what do well here,</v>

1373
01:14:26.211 --> 01:14:28.490
I'll give you two questions.
You can answer either one.

1374
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:31.220
So one is what is something you believe in?

1375
01:14:31.221 --> 01:14:33.590
It doesn't have to be limited to what we've been talking about,

1376
01:14:33.591 --> 01:14:38.460
but what is something you believe that other people think is insane?
Or what do,

1377
01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.160
if you had to pick one thing,

1378
01:14:40.161 --> 01:14:43.220
you believe that a lot of trainers disagree with you on,

1379
01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:45.290
what would that thing be?
It could be either.

1380
01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:51.460
<v 4>No,
I think.
MMM.
Oh,
there's all,
there's probably a lot.
I mean,</v>

1381
01:14:51.490 --> 01:14:52.400
I think it's probably a lot less

1382
01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:54.990
<v 3>get into it.
Whatever you want it to,
whatever you can mention.</v>

1383
01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:58.030
<v 4>Yeah.
You know,
I think the number one thing is,
is that,</v>

1384
01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:01.330
but my biggest frustration in the field of,
of,

1385
01:15:01.331 --> 01:15:06.331
of training human performance is that I think everyone's constantly trying to be

1386
01:15:07.061 --> 01:15:11.680
the expert and making things so complicated that you have to see,
see,

1387
01:15:11.681 --> 01:15:13.450
a trained professional to understand.

1388
01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:18.220
I think my biggest thing is that it's not that difficult.
It's very simple.

1389
01:15:18.221 --> 01:15:20.380
And I think the more this is more,
the simpler we can make it,

1390
01:15:20.381 --> 01:15:24.010
the better it is for everybody,
including the one those teaching it.
Um,

1391
01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:28.570
I think we try to get so complicated,
uh,
and,
and,
and,
you know,

1392
01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:32.160
kind of put our own spin and making it,
we're the expert in certain things that,

1393
01:15:32.161 --> 01:15:36.800
that it just becomes kind of,
I'm on digestible for,
for,
for most people.

1394
01:15:36.801 --> 01:15:39.950
So I think my biggest thing is just make it as simple as you possibly can.

1395
01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:42.410
Whether you're working with the Levi level athletes or you're working with,

1396
01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:46.580
you know,
um,
you know,
sedentary adults.
I,
it doesn't matter,
it just,

1397
01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:49.940
just make it as simple as possible because ultimately you can only improve so

1398
01:15:49.941 --> 01:15:52.430
many things at once.
Just focus on,
on whatever,

1399
01:15:52.431 --> 01:15:54.110
you'll get the most bang for your buck out of it.

1400
01:15:54.111 --> 01:15:58.080
And I think start there and you can start to add things on.
Um,
and,

1401
01:15:58.230 --> 01:16:01.670
and I think that's the biggest thing.
I think,
uh,
you know,
for me,

1402
01:16:01.730 --> 01:16:04.010
I think it's just keeping it as simple as possible.

1403
01:16:04.011 --> 01:16:07.880
And I think we tried to make it a lot more difficult.
I think people always say,

1404
01:16:07.881 --> 01:16:10.490
well,
you know,
how,
how,
how do you,
how can you just predict,
you know,

1405
01:16:10.491 --> 01:16:13.040
someone's speed based on just an expert at looking body weight will,
you know,

1406
01:16:13.041 --> 01:16:15.350
there's an algorithm that goes into it and there's been eight years of data

1407
01:16:15.351 --> 01:16:17.930
collected on,
you know,
thousands of athletes that,

1408
01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:21.700
that helped me drive to that it's not just,
Oh,
just do this and that,
and it's,

1409
01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.700
you know,
there's a lot that goes to it,
but,

1410
01:16:23.701 --> 01:16:25.860
but by me just keeping it really simple by just saying,

1411
01:16:25.861 --> 01:16:28.100
just increase your strength without increasing your lean muscle mass,
you,

1412
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:31.260
you'll improve your speed.
It,
it's,
I think it's more helping more people than it,

1413
01:16:31.261 --> 01:16:33.900
than it is to kind of,
um,
I can't sell that.

1414
01:16:33.901 --> 01:16:35.700
So it's not that I'm trying to sell anything,
it's more than anything.

1415
01:16:35.701 --> 01:16:37.050
It's just trying to keep it as simple as possible.

1416
01:16:37.051 --> 01:16:41.160
So people's kind of remove the riff Raff from,
uh,
you know,
their daily thing.

1417
01:16:41.161 --> 01:16:44.700
I don't know if you saw the story,
there's a story today,
uh,
in,
um,

1418
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:47.940
on ESPN about the University of Oregon and there's three players from the

1419
01:16:47.941 --> 01:16:51.660
university,
Oregon's football team that were hospitalized due to Rhabdo,
which

1420
01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:55.330
<v 3>she's so revved my license.
You want to describe what,</v>

1421
01:16:55.450 --> 01:16:57.100
what Rhabdo is for people who don't know?

1422
01:16:57.450 --> 01:17:00.390
<v 4>Yeah,
sure.
It's basically caused by super intense workouts,</v>

1423
01:17:00.391 --> 01:17:04.030
overtraining to the point where your muscle tissue breaks down and gets into the

1424
01:17:04.031 --> 01:17:07.330
bloodstream and releases toxins and can actually lead to kidney failure.

1425
01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.040
It's something that we haven't seen and I'm not kidding.

1426
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:14.060
<v 3>I think like 80 years,
uh,
crossfit,
yes.</v>

1427
01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:18.060
When they do gyms that that occurs here and there.
Yeah.
So there was,

1428
01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.560
<v 4>but as there were hospitalized and,
and,</v>

1429
01:17:19.561 --> 01:17:22.410
and basically the coach that was training them was trying to break them down

1430
01:17:22.411 --> 01:17:24.830
basically.
And,
um,
you know,

1431
01:17:24.831 --> 01:17:28.680
doing certain exercises that just really at the end of the day he was just

1432
01:17:28.681 --> 01:17:32.040
trying to break them mentally and that was really for no reason.

1433
01:17:32.041 --> 01:17:36.720
Other than that there's no sports performance aspect behind it.
Um,
but a lot of,

1434
01:17:36.721 --> 01:17:39.020
a lot of coaches out there,
when I talked a lot of high school,
you know,

1435
01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:40.780
strength coaches are a lot of college drinkers.

1436
01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.690
When I go around speaking in different places,

1437
01:17:42.691 --> 01:17:47.130
it's just that I think we get so caught up in kind of what we used to do.

1438
01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:52.350
We miss out on ultimately what's best for the people we're working with and how

1439
01:17:52.351 --> 01:17:55.320
can we be on the front edges of that,
of improving it.
I just,

1440
01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:00.240
I'm not comfortable sitting here today saying I accept where we are as far as

1441
01:18:00.241 --> 01:18:02.090
we've come in training that I'm willing to sit on my laurels,

1442
01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:04.800
just use what we have currently.
Like I want to push the limits.

1443
01:18:04.801 --> 01:18:08.250
I think we're on the W we've barely even scratched the surface on human,

1444
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:09.121
on human potential.

1445
01:18:09.121 --> 01:18:13.720
And I think a lot of that has to do with just regurgitated information and,
and,

1446
01:18:13.721 --> 01:18:17.340
and not people looking and seeking out better ways to do something.

1447
01:18:17.341 --> 01:18:20.880
And I think that's my biggest thing is it's not so much that I never speak in

1448
01:18:20.881 --> 01:18:23.520
absolutes.
I don't think we're ever,
we've ever reached the finish line,

1449
01:18:23.521 --> 01:18:25.350
especially in this field.
I think it's always,

1450
01:18:25.351 --> 01:18:29.100
you've got to always kind of focused on this is what I'm currently doing today.

1451
01:18:29.101 --> 01:18:33.000
I hope in two years I have a better way to train athletes than just the x bar

1452
01:18:33.010 --> 01:18:34.170
down.
If I really truly do,

1453
01:18:34.171 --> 01:18:37.350
I hope the force number is obsolete in two years because I hope we've moved on

1454
01:18:37.351 --> 01:18:42.351
to something that is better and more and safer and more people can do it to help

1455
01:18:42.391 --> 01:18:44.460
them improve their performance.
And then at the end of the day,

1456
01:18:44.461 --> 01:18:45.870
my goal would be is if you can,

1457
01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:49.290
if you can even the playing field of genetics and talent and you can actually

1458
01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:51.690
teach people how to be faster than it's going to come down to who works the

1459
01:18:51.691 --> 01:18:54.890
hardest is going to win.
And I think that's what my goal is ultimately is not to,

1460
01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:59.670
it's to remove the veil of kind of mystery of what makes somebody elite and
show,

1461
01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:01.620
okay,
here's,
here's,
here's what you need to do.

1462
01:19:01.621 --> 01:19:04.110
If you could do these three things,
do this over a long period of time.

1463
01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:06.600
And it's just who's going to put in the most work is going to reach that goal.

1464
01:19:06.601 --> 01:19:10.200
And I think more and more,
you know,
in other fields we're seeing that.
Um,

1465
01:19:10.410 --> 01:19:13.740
but I think my goal with training is just to kind of continue to push the

1466
01:19:13.741 --> 01:19:17.310
envelope and not accept kind of what is and kind of keep pushing forward.

1467
01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:18.773
<v 3>Which,</v>

1468
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:24.270
which trainers or books have most influenced or impressed you?

1469
01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:30.520
And the reason I ask,
I have,
uh,
Charlie Francis,

1470
01:19:30.521 --> 01:19:33.640
his book on speed.
Charlie,
he was amazing.

1471
01:19:33.641 --> 01:19:37.630
And some of you may recognize that name because he was the trader of Ben
Johnson.

1472
01:19:37.631 --> 01:19:40.660
Now at that level,
you don't have to comment,
but

1473
01:19:42.250 --> 01:19:45.940
I will say with a fair degree of certainty,
not the only guy doping in that race.

1474
01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:48.160
I mean,
I think we've already got back.

1475
01:19:48.161 --> 01:19:51.850
I haven't ever gone back and seen that like eight of the seven of the eight

1476
01:19:51.851 --> 01:19:55.360
people in that race were doping.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
It's,
it's

1477
01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:56.350
<v 4>Charlie,</v>

1478
01:19:56.350 --> 01:20:00.500
Charlie that people miss out on the genius purely based on kind of the story

1479
01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:02.290
with Ben and,
and people thinking he's,

1480
01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:05.980
he's bad guy because he did well when it was just the name of the game.
I mean,

1481
01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:07.053
I tell people all the time,

1482
01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:10.480
you're sitting in a major league baseball locker room in late eighties early

1483
01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:13.510
nineties and you're looking around and you hit 20 home runs a year before and

1484
01:20:13.511 --> 01:20:16.840
the guy next to you hit 12 and the following year he gets 40 and you're still

1485
01:20:16.841 --> 01:20:19.800
hitting 20 at some point you're going to go,
you know what?

1486
01:20:19.801 --> 01:20:21.210
I got to get on what everybody else is getting on.

1487
01:20:21.211 --> 01:20:23.520
Otherwise I'm not going to be able to play very much longer.
And I think,

1488
01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:26.050
you know,
it's,
it's kind of almost,
it's,
it's,
it's,

1489
01:20:26.170 --> 01:20:27.420
they're the product of the culture.

1490
01:20:27.421 --> 01:20:31.140
It's not so much an isolated incident as much as people think it is.
Yeah.
So,

1491
01:20:31.290 --> 01:20:33.870
yeah,
outside of that,
no,
Charlie Francis,
absolutely.
It was a huge,

1492
01:20:33.871 --> 01:20:38.400
massive influence on me.
Um,
another,
a three time Olympian,

1493
01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:39.500
a hurdler,

1494
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:42.990
a guy by the name of Tony Campbell who became a two who's still a track and

1495
01:20:42.991 --> 01:20:47.610
field coach show was a huge influence on me.
Damn Path is,
is,
is one of the,

1496
01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:52.410
I think,
brilliant minds of,
of not just track and field the training period.

1497
01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:53.880
He runs all of this down to Phoenix,

1498
01:20:53.881 --> 01:20:57.930
which is one of the largest kind of attended a track and field centers in the

1499
01:20:57.931 --> 01:21:02.370
world.
Altice a l t u S.
Yeah,
alt u s um,
and Dan path.

1500
01:21:02.371 --> 01:21:03.760
It's p f a f F.

1501
01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:10.490
Brilliant guy in mind.
Um,
but you know,
I study everybody.
Tim,
honestly,

1502
01:21:10.491 --> 01:21:13.190
I,
I mean I've,
I've got from,
you know,

1503
01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:17.570
Louie Simmons to child porn and to all of them.
I mean for me it's,

1504
01:21:17.610 --> 01:21:20.270
it's kind of like says success leaves clues and I think you've got to kind of

1505
01:21:20.271 --> 01:21:23.090
study the best that that had done it prior to you and see what,

1506
01:21:23.091 --> 01:21:26.420
see where we're at and then see what we can kind of add onto.
You know,

1507
01:21:26.421 --> 01:21:28.820
Buddy Morris,
he was a strength coach with the Arizona cardinals.

1508
01:21:28.821 --> 01:21:32.780
A really good friend of mine,
you know,
phenomenal coach.
He,
he's,
you know,

1509
01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:34.520
been in the game for a very long time,

1510
01:21:34.521 --> 01:21:37.690
is in his sixties was kind of a Louis Westside barbell guy.
But,
uh,

1511
01:21:37.710 --> 01:21:41.150
it has kind of adjusted to really evolve and he's doing some phenomenal things

1512
01:21:41.151 --> 01:21:45.370
with them.
Um,
but yeah,
I mean there's a ton of coaches that I,
I,
you know,

1513
01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:49.780
you know,
respect incredibly,
I think,
I think it's been awesome.

1514
01:21:49.781 --> 01:21:50.950
I think more than anything we,

1515
01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.380
we as a field of performance coaches have to kind of,

1516
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:57.210
and what my goal is with Nike is trying to bring us together to kind of get,

1517
01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:57.680
you know,

1518
01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:00.370
bringing all that information together and try to kind of come with some
breaths,

1519
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:02.990
best practices and try to help move this field forward.

1520
01:22:04.570 --> 01:22:07.990
<v 3>What,
is there anything in particular from uh,
Louis Simmons for you?</v>

1521
01:22:07.991 --> 01:22:11.140
People who don't know who Louie Simmons says you got to look,

1522
01:22:11.141 --> 01:22:14.370
this guy is awesome and I'm not going to say too much more.

1523
01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:19.120
He's very well spoken,
very smart,
a checkout,
his tattoos,

1524
01:22:19.150 --> 01:22:21.710
a reward.
He has to say about anabolic.
It's,

1525
01:22:22.330 --> 01:22:27.130
and then look at the athletes who have come out of his gym in the last 20 years

1526
01:22:27.190 --> 01:22:29.380
and just prepare to have your mind blown.
Do Yeah.
If you've,

1527
01:22:29.410 --> 01:22:33.400
if you've ever seen people using chains or bands,
uh,

1528
01:22:33.430 --> 01:22:37.020
chances are they,
they borrowed it from Louie Simmons or if they,
uh,

1529
01:22:37.570 --> 01:22:41.340
but is there anything in particular that you have,
uh,

1530
01:22:41.410 --> 01:22:43.900
borrowed or adapted from Louie that comes to mind?

1531
01:22:44.650 --> 01:22:47.670
<v 4>Yeah,
absolutely.
When I went to meet with them,
you know,</v>

1532
01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:50.470
one of the big things he was talking to me about is that with all in this was

1533
01:22:50.471 --> 01:22:54.200
just recently,
but he will all of his world record and,
and and you know,

1534
01:22:54.210 --> 01:22:56.960
worldclass squatters that he has,
he,

1535
01:22:56.961 --> 01:23:01.810
he box squats all of them to improve their squat.
So as basic of a lift this box,

1536
01:23:01.811 --> 01:23:04.600
what is,
he uses that to help them improve their deep squat,
uh,

1537
01:23:04.601 --> 01:23:06.550
in their power lifting a competition.

1538
01:23:06.551 --> 01:23:09.900
So that was one thing I started implementing more and more with a lot of my

1539
01:23:09.901 --> 01:23:13.790
jumpers.
A lot of my football players is using more box squat and then um,

1540
01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.900
then than deep squatter or any type of variation of squad.
I,

1541
01:23:16.901 --> 01:23:19.140
I use the box squat a ton and I as a teaching tool,

1542
01:23:19.141 --> 01:23:22.710
but just to help them improve their other exercises of minimizing the risk of

1543
01:23:22.711 --> 01:23:23.544
injury and training.

1544
01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:26.770
<v 3>Question on box squat.
Just a technical nuance said,</v>

1545
01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:30.040
are you with your athletes when they box squat,

1546
01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.330
how much of your weight,
how much of their weight,

1547
01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:39.420
do you have them transfer from their feet to their ass on the box?

1548
01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:44.720
Uh,
if at all?
Or is it just making contact and then reversing the movement?

1549
01:23:45.450 --> 01:23:47.370
<v 4>It just depends on the weight I'm using.
Um,</v>

1550
01:23:47.371 --> 01:23:50.020
and also kind of what I'm going for if I'm using,
if I'm using it like to,

1551
01:23:50.050 --> 01:23:53.280
to do tempo.
So if I'm doing like four seconds down controlled tempo,

1552
01:23:53.281 --> 01:23:56.310
I may have them,
um,
just touch and go.
I may have them.

1553
01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:57.210
It just depends on what I'm,

1554
01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:00.450
where I'm at in the phase of training or what I'm trying to do to teach.

1555
01:24:00.451 --> 01:24:03.740
Sometimes I'll a lot of times a week newer athletes to box squatting,

1556
01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:06.770
I'll actually have them sit completely down on the bench or on the,
on the,

1557
01:24:06.771 --> 01:24:10.750
I'm sorry,
on the box.
Um,
kind of sit up rights to their spine angle is,

1558
01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:14.230
is perpendicular to the ground and,
and then lean back forward and stand back up.

1559
01:24:14.231 --> 01:24:16.690
Just to kind of get the understanding of the sequencing of the movement that I

1560
01:24:16.691 --> 01:24:18.960
want.
Um,
that from what I was saying,

1561
01:24:18.961 --> 01:24:21.330
that's what Louis does as well as he actually has them sit completely down in

1562
01:24:21.331 --> 01:24:24.000
the box.
Um,
and so,
um,

1563
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:26.880
I kind of do a combination of the two which just kind of bends on the,
for the,

1564
01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:29.620
the,
the um,
kind of phase of the training I'm in.

1565
01:24:29.621 --> 01:24:31.060
But for the most part of the listeners,

1566
01:24:31.061 --> 01:24:34.030
I would say I'd probably sit all the way down in the box and then tilt your

1567
01:24:34.050 --> 01:24:35.530
spine angle back forward and stand back up

1568
01:24:36.010 --> 01:24:36.670
<v 3>when you're,</v>

1569
01:24:36.670 --> 01:24:41.670
when you're working with elite football players or sprinter.

1570
01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:45.200
Certainly I would imagine they're already,

1571
01:24:45.230 --> 01:24:49.920
they already tend to be very low body fat there.

1572
01:24:49.921 --> 01:24:53.230
There are probably exceptions depending on the,
yeah,

1573
01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:55.470
there are probably exceptions depending on the position,
but with,

1574
01:24:55.471 --> 01:24:58.410
for talking about the

1575
01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:02.340
not ground reactive force exactly,
but the,

1576
01:25:02.341 --> 01:25:07.170
the amount of weight they can lift relative to their body weight.

1577
01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:13.240
Are there cases where you focus simultaneously or not on dropping as much body

1578
01:25:14.571 --> 01:25:19.571
fat as possible since that would extensively contribute to their ability to run

1579
01:25:20.351 --> 01:25:22.960
faster?
Right.
I mean you're just tweaking a different variable.

1580
01:25:23.130 --> 01:25:25.050
<v 4>Oh,
a hundred percent yeah.
I have a good example of that.</v>

1581
01:25:25.051 --> 01:25:29.910
Actually a couple of years ago I had two quarterbacks going coming into the NFL

1582
01:25:29.911 --> 01:25:30.450
draft,

1583
01:25:30.450 --> 01:25:35.400
Marcus Mariota and Jamis Winston and one came in at 207 pounds and needed to be

1584
01:25:35.401 --> 01:25:40.401
two 25 the other one came in at two 60 I needed to be two 30 so I actually had

1585
01:25:40.501 --> 01:25:44.100
one needing to gain 20 and the other one needing to lose 30 and and had them at

1586
01:25:44.101 --> 01:25:46.440
the exact same time.
And so,
um,
yeah,
this,

1587
01:25:46.441 --> 01:25:49.170
this ultimately can work for either.

1588
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:51.680
<v 3>What did you do in both of those cases?</v>

1589
01:25:51.681 --> 01:25:53.660
I know you could probably talk for hours about it,

1590
01:25:53.661 --> 01:25:58.490
but if you had to do your best to summarize what worked best for those two guys.

1591
01:25:58.491 --> 01:26:02.630
One trying to cut fair amount of body fat and then the other trying to gain

1592
01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:06.380
mass.
What,
what were the keys in those two cases?

1593
01:26:07.330 --> 01:26:10.240
<v 4>No,
I mean,
yeah,
ultimately it comes down to,
I mean,
as you know,</v>

1594
01:26:10.241 --> 01:26:13.210
nutrition plays a massive role in it.
And so blood testing,
I mean I,

1595
01:26:13.211 --> 01:26:15.730
I do a lot of blood tests work with,
with the guys and so as you know,

1596
01:26:15.731 --> 01:26:20.080
with high levels of insulin,
glucose is really difficult to lose body fat.

1597
01:26:20.081 --> 01:26:23.470
So understanding their diet and that perspective of trying to lower that,

1598
01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:24.890
those markers as much as possible,

1599
01:26:24.891 --> 01:26:28.300
eliminate sugar and those types of things that have them lose body fat is,

1600
01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:30.980
is crucial.
Um,
but at the end of the day,
that's,

1601
01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:34.100
that's the really cool part about a lot of this training is that a lot of it is

1602
01:26:34.101 --> 01:26:37.100
going to get you to some sort of level of homeostasis.

1603
01:26:37.101 --> 01:26:41.100
Your body is going to try to get to its natural state,
uh,

1604
01:26:41.130 --> 01:26:43.530
somewhat of a zero based on all of this training.

1605
01:26:43.531 --> 01:26:45.300
So whether you need to lose weight or you need to put on muscle,

1606
01:26:45.301 --> 01:26:49.740
your body's going to adapt and do what it needs to do in order to increase its

1607
01:26:49.741 --> 01:26:50.181
strengths,

1608
01:26:50.181 --> 01:26:52.320
especially when it's being stressed at certain levels with the hex bar dead

1609
01:26:52.321 --> 01:26:55.080
lifts.
So with a guy like Marcus who needed it to gain 20 pounds,

1610
01:26:55.081 --> 01:26:59.050
I added a lot more youth centric loading into his training programming.

1611
01:26:59.051 --> 01:27:00.880
So He'd do a lot more tempo,
time,

1612
01:27:00.910 --> 01:27:04.500
attention and focus on the eccentric phase of some of the exercises as well as

1613
01:27:04.501 --> 01:27:08.020
well as uh,
the concentric.
So an export data,
for example,

1614
01:27:08.021 --> 01:27:10.060
I'd have him go up and down,
um,

1615
01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:12.640
because we were looking for more like cross sectional muscle fiber.
And then,

1616
01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:15.910
and then with Jamis it was,
it was a lot of concentric,

1617
01:27:15.911 --> 01:27:20.090
only eliminate limited east centric focus from his,
his training,
um,

1618
01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:23.350
and then just upping the intensity and also his cardio.
So just giving him some,

1619
01:27:23.650 --> 01:27:28.540
some more,
uh,
cardio throughout the day.
And for him,
a big part was just diet.

1620
01:27:28.541 --> 01:27:30.400
I mean,
a lot of these kids coming out of college,

1621
01:27:30.401 --> 01:27:33.550
a lot of a lot of people don't realize is that they have no idea how to eat

1622
01:27:33.551 --> 01:27:36.100
right or what is,
what is eating right.

1623
01:27:36.130 --> 01:27:39.550
They've gotten away so much on talent up to that point that all of a sudden it

1624
01:27:39.551 --> 01:27:40.690
comes to the point where,
oh wait,

1625
01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:43.330
I got to really focus on what I have to eat now.
You know?
So it's like,
yeah,
no,

1626
01:27:43.331 --> 01:27:46.620
mcdonalds and KFC is not not good for you.
Uh,
which people,

1627
01:27:47.970 --> 01:27:50.620
you'd be amazed at how much they don't understand that,
but I,
you know,

1628
01:27:50.621 --> 01:27:52.090
just helping him with his dad was a big part.

1629
01:27:52.091 --> 01:27:55.420
So ultimately the training doesn't need to change as much as it's like,

1630
01:27:55.421 --> 01:27:57.520
when you look at crossfit for exams is a great example.

1631
01:27:57.521 --> 01:28:00.790
You'll see some people in the gym over 60 days that will put on tons of muscle

1632
01:28:00.791 --> 01:28:03.100
mass and,
and you know,

1633
01:28:03.130 --> 01:28:05.560
and get stronger and bigger and you'll look at the other side of the room and

1634
01:28:05.561 --> 01:28:08.880
said,
we'll lose 105 pounds.
And it's like,
whoa.

1635
01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:10.810
How did them in the same workout,

1636
01:28:10.811 --> 01:28:15.280
same programming over this past six C's get totally different opposite results

1637
01:28:15.281 --> 01:28:19.060
and ultimately just because the body's trying to find that,
that,
that,
that zero,

1638
01:28:19.061 --> 01:28:21.960
that homeostasis.
So it's whether it's burning fat cells or,
or,

1639
01:28:21.961 --> 01:28:26.050
or increasingly muscle mass,
it's going to do whatever you know is,

1640
01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:27.970
is asking you to do.
Right.

1641
01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:29.640
<v 3>What's a,
just a,</v>

1642
01:28:29.641 --> 01:28:33.180
just a couple more questions and I'll let you back to your night.
But the

1643
01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:39.740
first question that I always ask is what books have you gifted the most to other

1644
01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:44.020
people?
And these don't have to be sports related,
but they could be,
uh,
are there,

1645
01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:46.800
are there any particular books that you've gifted

1646
01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:51.080
<v 4>to mammal?
Good question.
I've heard you asked this before.
I didn't dig.</v>

1647
01:28:51.081 --> 01:28:53.690
You're asking me and it should have been prepared for this,
but I,
I'm a huge,

1648
01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:56.930
huge avid reader.
Um,
I mean I truly believe,

1649
01:28:56.931 --> 01:29:00.170
I tell every person I trained is that I think the big one of the biggest reasons

1650
01:29:00.430 --> 01:29:02.290
you are where are there,
if it's been where you are,

1651
01:29:02.291 --> 01:29:05.710
where you are and where you want to go is kind of knowledge I big and reading as

1652
01:29:05.711 --> 01:29:07.690
much as you can.
And so that's a tough question.

1653
01:29:07.691 --> 01:29:11.130
I think the alchemist is a big one.
I've,
I've loved that book for a very,

1654
01:29:11.131 --> 01:29:15.370
very long time.
Um,
the Bible is a big one,

1655
01:29:15.930 --> 01:29:18.930
but I'll give you a kind of an off,
off,
off the wall kind of one,

1656
01:29:18.931 --> 01:29:20.670
which is called the slight edge.
If you ever heard of that book,

1657
01:29:20.970 --> 01:29:24.270
<v 3>the slight edge.
The slight edge.
Oh,
slight edge.
Yeah.</v>

1658
01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:27.020
<v 4>So basically the premise of the book is,
is,</v>

1659
01:29:27.021 --> 01:29:31.190
and I give it to as many athletes as I possibly can.
Um,
the,
it's basic,

1660
01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:34.530
the premises,
what you,
the small,
little tiny things you do,

1661
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:38.290
the daily habits you do every single day can lead to exponential kind of life

1662
01:29:38.291 --> 01:29:41.140
improvement down the road.
So it's basically talks about,
okay,

1663
01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:43.610
for me habits before they form you.
And,

1664
01:29:43.611 --> 01:29:45.230
and what types of habits you want to form.

1665
01:29:45.231 --> 01:29:47.870
So whether it's things like you talked about all the time,
which is journaling,

1666
01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:52.890
uh,
nutrition,
um,
you know,
relationally,
like all those things that you,
that,
that,

1667
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.490
that will help you lead a greater,
fuller,
happier life.

1668
01:29:55.491 --> 01:29:56.990
Kind of making sure that you do those,

1669
01:29:56.991 --> 01:29:59.720
those things and Redo them religiously every single day.

1670
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:01.850
And over the course of time,
like compounding interest,

1671
01:30:01.851 --> 01:30:05.290
it will add up to something great at,
you know,
down the road.
And,
um,

1672
01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.420
it's all about just kind of forming those habits.
I,
and I,

1673
01:30:07.421 --> 01:30:11.540
that's something I work with my athletes on all the time because ultimately

1674
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:15.020
they've all gotten to where they are.
But what,
what separates the great ones,

1675
01:30:15.021 --> 01:30:19.040
the all time athletes and people from,
from kind of the,
you know,

1676
01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:22.240
the good is I think those kind of dis,
you know,

1677
01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:25.070
discipline daily habits that they do every single day.
That,
that kind of,

1678
01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.500
you know,
make them who they are.
They are.

1679
01:30:27.530 --> 01:30:30.810
And that's what separates them from everybody else.
They know who they are.
Um,

1680
01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:32.450
they know that they can only do a few things really,

1681
01:30:32.451 --> 01:30:35.810
really well and they focus on those things and without fail they do them every

1682
01:30:35.810 --> 01:30:36.643
single day.

1683
01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:40.060
<v 3>You know this,
I'm so embarrassed,
I can't remember the name but a,</v>

1684
01:30:40.061 --> 01:30:41.320
I love the title be.

1685
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:46.350
It reminds me of this anecdote or a story I heard about one of the most famous

1686
01:30:47.831 --> 01:30:52.600
basketball coaches of the last century certainly,

1687
01:30:52.601 --> 01:30:56.260
and I'm blanking on the John Wooden.
Yes,
John Wooden.

1688
01:30:56.770 --> 01:30:58.870
And this may or may not be true.

1689
01:30:58.871 --> 01:31:02.860
I think it is that he would sit his players down at the beginning of a season,

1690
01:31:03.070 --> 01:31:08.070
have them take off their shoes and then have them lace their shoes back on

1691
01:31:09.490 --> 01:31:14.490
according to his instructions and the point of the exercise because people are

1692
01:31:15.131 --> 01:31:17.260
like,
why the hell are we doing this?
This is ridiculous.

1693
01:31:17.261 --> 01:31:19.030
Why do I need to change how at least my shoes?

1694
01:31:19.031 --> 01:31:24.031
And he said improperly a fitted shoes cause blisters,

1695
01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:28.370
blisters,
cost points and points,
cost games.

1696
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:32.600
And the moral of the story being that it's the little things done consistently

1697
01:31:32.601 --> 01:31:35.930
that make a huge difference now that you have to pay attention to.
The details.

1698
01:31:35.931 --> 01:31:36.764
So I love that.

1699
01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:39.770
<v 4>Yeah.
Hundred percent.
Yeah,
the slight edge in it.
It's a redundant book.</v>

1700
01:31:39.771 --> 01:31:42.200
It just goes and you know,
cover it covers the same things over and over again.

1701
01:31:42.650 --> 01:31:44.540
Um,
but it's just,
it's,
it's kind of,
you know,

1702
01:31:44.541 --> 01:31:46.780
there's all these self help books out there that kind of give you like

1703
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:48.050
breakthroughs and certain things.
This,

1704
01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:50.290
this one is awesome because that kind of gives you the,

1705
01:31:50.450 --> 01:31:54.020
before all of that happens you've got to be able to do these things really well.

1706
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:57.530
Um,
and it talks about like four or five things that you do daily that that just

1707
01:31:57.531 --> 01:32:00.790
will add up at some point there.
They're good habits that will,
that will pay off,

1708
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:03.160
you know,
you know,
exponentially.
And in the end,

1709
01:32:03.670 --> 01:32:04.503
<v 3>I love it.</v>

1710
01:32:04.590 --> 01:32:09.590
What advice would you give your 30 year old self and if you could just place us,

1711
01:32:11.661 --> 01:32:15.840
where are you?
How old are you right now?
I'm 34 okay.
Forget about that question.

1712
01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:19.560
Well yeah,
let's say you're 20 or 25 year old self,

1713
01:32:19.561 --> 01:32:22.600
whichever one needs the advice the most.
And if you could just cut,

1714
01:32:22.650 --> 01:32:26.730
try to place us where you are and what you're doing.
20 or 25

1715
01:32:27.150 --> 01:32:31.620
<v 4>man,
I think.
I think the biggest thing would be to,
I'll tell you a funny story.</v>

1716
01:32:31.621 --> 01:32:36.130
My so well,
I first started doing this,
my,
my dad would always tell people that,

1717
01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:38.430
that I was,
well,
I mean I still,
when I first started this,

1718
01:32:38.431 --> 01:32:39.900
I started to figure out what I want to do and training.

1719
01:32:39.970 --> 01:32:43.260
I even started out where I was like at a 24 hour fitness because I just wanted

1720
01:32:43.261 --> 01:32:44.790
to get an idea of like what I wanted to do.

1721
01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:47.940
And to this day my dad still tells everybody I'm a personal trainer.

1722
01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:52.760
But I think it's pretty funny.
Um,
well for multiple reasons,
but I think it's,

1723
01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:57.630
it's,
it's,
but I think more than anything it's,
it's,
it's that whatever,

1724
01:32:58.100 --> 01:33:01.860
whatever you're going to do be,
be the absolute best at it.

1725
01:33:01.861 --> 01:33:04.660
And I think ultimately it always works out in the end.
And,

1726
01:33:04.661 --> 01:33:07.530
and I would have never thought in a million years when I was younger that like,

1727
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.430
you know,
I thought I was kind of not being an athlete and not being kind of,

1728
01:33:11.790 --> 01:33:13.740
you know,
I didn't know how I want to be an orthopedic surgeon,
but not,

1729
01:33:13.741 --> 01:33:16.410
but not having none of those things really work out for me.

1730
01:33:16.411 --> 01:33:19.050
I would've never guessed that would reach level access to success that I have

1731
01:33:19.051 --> 01:33:24.000
today based on what I was doing.
But I took so much pride and,
and,
and,

1732
01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:24.330
um,

1733
01:33:24.330 --> 01:33:27.750
put so much effort into like helping every single person that it came across to

1734
01:33:27.751 --> 01:33:29.550
improve that.
Ultimately,

1735
01:33:29.551 --> 01:33:32.550
it kind of started to add up and I think I just wanted to be the best,

1736
01:33:32.610 --> 01:33:36.000
absolute best that I could be.
Um,
are you from or the author Cs Lewis?

1737
01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:40.400
<v 3>Yeah,
absolutely.
Yes.
Yes.
About Screwtape letters.
Yes.</v>

1738
01:33:40.510 --> 01:33:43.320
<v 4>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Some great.
But once a big things,
he talks about it.</v>

1739
01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:44.740
It's what's called the inner circle.

1740
01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:47.770
I think w w w when I was talking to the athletes I work with,

1741
01:33:47.771 --> 01:33:48.730
I'm always talking about,
you know,

1742
01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:51.820
they're always striving to be within that inner circle.

1743
01:33:51.821 --> 01:33:55.210
Whether they see people like Jay z or Beyonce or you know,

1744
01:33:55.211 --> 01:33:57.550
big time athletes that they like,
you know,

1745
01:33:57.850 --> 01:34:01.660
Tom Brady or whoever they want to be in that circle with those athletes because

1746
01:34:01.661 --> 01:34:03.730
they see them,
they're all hanging out,
running around.

1747
01:34:03.731 --> 01:34:05.950
But ultimately those people in the,
in that inner circle,

1748
01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:07.870
they don't even know they're in that inner circle.

1749
01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:10.870
The reason they're in that inner circle is because other people that were

1750
01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:14.590
amazingly great at what they did recognize their greatness and what they did.

1751
01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:17.500
And that's why it's the inner circles a lot of times made up of photographers or

1752
01:34:17.501 --> 01:34:21.550
actors or musicians or athletes or all these different types of people,

1753
01:34:21.551 --> 01:34:23.410
because ultimately they're the best of what they do.

1754
01:34:23.411 --> 01:34:25.360
And other greatness recognizes greatness.

1755
01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:27.910
So instead of focusing on getting into the inner circle,

1756
01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:30.130
focused on being great at whatever you're doing,

1757
01:34:30.131 --> 01:34:32.050
and I promise you at the end of they are going to look up and you'll be in the

1758
01:34:32.051 --> 01:34:33.030
inner circle.
And I think that's,

1759
01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:35.800
that's for me telling my younger self that is that just,

1760
01:34:36.010 --> 01:34:39.820
just be great at what you're doing and ultimately you'll be recognized for that.

1761
01:34:39.850 --> 01:34:43.570
Not,
not trying to,
you know,
get into the inner circle in any other way,
I guess,

1762
01:34:43.571 --> 01:34:44.404
if that makes sense.

1763
01:34:44.490 --> 01:34:48.180
<v 3>Makes perfect sense.
Well,
Ryan,</v>

1764
01:34:48.570 --> 01:34:49.920
this has been awesome.
This is,

1765
01:34:49.921 --> 01:34:52.620
I'm really glad we connected and had a chance to chat.

1766
01:34:52.621 --> 01:34:56.700
I'm sure we will have a million followup questions from,

1767
01:34:58.270 --> 01:35:00.520
and,
uh,
plenty of room for round two.

1768
01:35:00.521 --> 01:35:05.090
So whether it's in Oregon or in San Diego or somewhere else,
would be fun to,

1769
01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:07.390
to grab a bite to eat and do some dead lifts.
Uh,

1770
01:35:08.030 --> 01:35:13.030
but where can people find you if there's preferred place on social media?

1771
01:35:15.011 --> 01:35:19.240
You'd like people to say hello or anything else you'd like to mention where,

1772
01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:22.780
where can people find you and more about your work?

1773
01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:26.310
<v 2>Yeah,
sure.
So,
I mean,
yeah,</v>

1774
01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:28.480
I'm I working at Nike now so it's a little bit different,

1775
01:35:28.481 --> 01:35:31.980
but I mean I'm on Instagram,
a Ryan flirty,

1776
01:35:31.981 --> 01:35:36.330
won outright and flirty and the number one,
um,
and then uh,

1777
01:35:36.331 --> 01:35:39.720
by email justRyan@prolificathletes.com is my personally most over you and

1778
01:35:39.721 --> 01:35:42.360
sending you know,
questions there if you guys would want.
Um,

1779
01:35:42.361 --> 01:35:44.680
and I'd be happy to get back to you as soon as I can.
Um,

1780
01:35:45.090 --> 01:35:48.400
I think those are probably the two probably best places to find a prolific

1781
01:35:48.401 --> 01:35:50.280
athletes.com is still up.
But,
but uh,

1782
01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:53.660
because I'm at Nike now that no longer really kind of operating that website

1783
01:35:53.661 --> 01:35:57.590
anymore.
So I would just focused on sending an email or,
or the ends or Instagram.

1784
01:35:57.930 --> 01:36:01.690
<v 3>Got It.
All right.
Well you may be getting a lot of emails,
sir.</v>

1785
01:36:01.950 --> 01:36:06.890
So hopefully you have in the autoresponder that helps you to ignore anything you

1786
01:36:06.891 --> 01:36:10.930
really don't want to answer.
But once again,

1787
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.410
thanks for taking the time.

1788
01:36:12.411 --> 01:36:17.411
This has given me a bunch of homework and things to look into and uh,

1789
01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:21.320
two people listening.
As always,

1790
01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:22.790
we will have show notes,

1791
01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:27.110
links to resources including the exercises that we discussed,

1792
01:36:27.111 --> 01:36:31.400
whether it's a glued mead,
Vmo,
step downs,

1793
01:36:31.401 --> 01:36:32.630
internal rotation of the Femur,

1794
01:36:32.650 --> 01:36:37.650
etc. We will have these available and we will figure out the best links for

1795
01:36:37.941 --> 01:36:40.040
those and put them in the show notes and you can find those show

1796
01:36:40.041 --> 01:36:45.041
notes@fourhourworkweek.com forward slash podcast or if that's too hard to spell,

1797
01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:50.380
you can just go to tim.blog/podcast and I'll have the show notes for this

1798
01:36:50.391 --> 01:36:55.010

Uh,
Ryan,
thanks again man.
I really appreciate it.

1799
01:36:55.340 --> 01:36:56.620
<v 2>Oh my pleasure,
Tim.
Thanks so much</v>

1800
01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:01.110
<v 3>and a to everybody listening,

1801
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:06.530
<v 5>thank you for tuning in and more episodes come and say,

1802

Just a few more things before you take off.
Number one,

1803
01:37:10.700 --> 01:37:15.650
this is five bullet Friday.
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1804

Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday?

1805
01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:22.820
That provides a little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet

1806
01:37:22.821 --> 01:37:27.440
Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that

1807
01:37:27.441 --> 01:37:29.030
I've been pondering over the week.

1808
01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:32.030
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1809
01:37:32.031 --> 01:37:35.480
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1810
01:37:35.481 --> 01:37:39.800
somehow dug up in the,
uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1811
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:45.070
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

1812
01:37:45.741 --> 01:37:48.440
close friends,
for instance.
And it's very short.

1813
01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:53.530
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

What?

1841
01:39:37.650 --> 01:39:40.110
And let me tell you,
I have a high bar for this stuff.

1842
01:39:40.170 --> 01:39:43.800
I have body work done at least once week cause I broke my body.

1843
01:39:43.801 --> 01:39:48.600
I have 30 plus fractures and hunted plus Mris.
I need bodywork.

1844
01:39:48.601 --> 01:39:53.550
So I have a very,
very,
very high bar for that sooth which I've tested.

1845
01:39:53.970 --> 01:39:58.740
I tested my assistant's tested,
my employees tested,
delivers a hint,

1846
01:39:58.741 --> 01:39:59.280
selected,

1847
01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:03.750
licensed and experienced massage therapist to you in the comfort of your own

1848
01:40:03.751 --> 01:40:06.840
home,
hotel or office in as little as an hour.

1849
01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:10.130
I've tested them in San Francisco,
I've tested them at Austin,

1850
01:40:10.131 --> 01:40:14.550
I've tested them all over the place and I have to say I was really,

1851
01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:19.580
really amazed at the quality of therapist and I do not accept mediocrity at all

1852
01:40:21.810 --> 01:40:24.630
in this area.
The process is super simple.

1853
01:40:25.090 --> 01:40:29.610
Think of it as Uber for massages,
right?
You choose the kind of massage you want,

1854
01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:34.470
say Swedish or sports massage,
deep tissue,
whatever.
Then a,
if you want,

1855
01:40:34.471 --> 01:40:38.910
you can opt for a couple's massage and I imagine that's an edge case as the tech

1856
01:40:38.911 --> 01:40:41.760
people say,
but whatever you sit,
the lengthier massage,

1857
01:40:41.761 --> 01:40:44.910
so let's see what 60 minutes,
90 minutes,
two hours,

1858
01:40:45.930 --> 01:40:48.630
and let's be real.
If you want a proper massage,

1859
01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:52.320
go for 90 or 120 minutes for God's sake and you select the gender of your

1860
01:40:52.321 --> 01:40:57.070
therapist and then click you're off to the races and they bring the massage

1861
01:40:57.071 --> 01:41:01.720
table sheets,
oil music so you can unwind no matter where you are.

1862
01:41:02.230 --> 01:41:05.800
And I have used this at Airbnbs,
hotels,
et Cetera,

1863
01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:10.810
et Susan's in 50 cities including most major us cities as well as the London,

1864
01:41:11.561 --> 01:41:16.180
Sydney,
