00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.790
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:05.970
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.530
I'm a cybernetic organism.

4
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.290
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by a new sponsor and there is a fun story behind</v>

5
00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:27.920
it.

6
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.920
Legal zoom.com I've used them for a number of businesses and Matt Mullenweg,

7
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.420
you might recall a guest on this podcast,

8
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.450
CEO of Automattic now valued at more than a billion dollars and he is one of the

9
00:00:41.031 --> 00:00:44.690
developers behind wordpress which powers roughly 23% of the Internet.

10
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.900
He first incorporated automatic on legal zoom.com and now legal zoom can help

11
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:54.830
you do a number of things that I might recommend,
like setting up a will,

12
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.510
doing a trademark search,

13
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.930
a proper trademark search so you don't put a ton of time and effort into a

14
00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:01.760
business and then get shut down for instance.

15
00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:05.180
Or I have to change your name more than a million people have already trusted

16
00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:10.130
legal zoom over the last decade to help start and build their businesses.

17
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.450
So if you need to say form an LLC or a nonprofit,
anything like that,

18
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.650
if you're doing business solely in your own name,
as a friend told me recently,

19
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.480
you're kind of flying naked.

20
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.480
You're opening yourself up to a lot of liabilities and issues.

21
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.690
So check out legal zoom.com you got to protect yourself.

22
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.050
They have been helping people not only with the docs because you don't want to

23
00:01:32.181 --> 00:01:36.170
pay necessarily someone thousands of dollars to just copy and paste something

24
00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:39.650
from one word doc to the next so you can not only find things like cease and

25
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:40.580
desist letters and so on,

26
00:01:40.581 --> 00:01:43.970
but they have helpful support so they have people on hand to answer your

27
00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:48.950
questions all based in the u s end.
Obviously you're looking for legal advice.

28
00:01:48.951 --> 00:01:50.390
Well,
they're not a law firm,

29
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.680
but legal zoom has built a network of independent attorneys available in most

30
00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:57.890
states so they can give you advice on the best way to get started.

31
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.670

34
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.330
So take a look legal zoom.com chances are you will find something that brings up

35
00:02:14.331 --> 00:02:16.970
the thought,
Oh God,
I didn't even think of that.

36
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.380
I really need to take care of that.

37
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.880

this episode is brought to you by 99 designs your one stop shop for all things

41
00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:40.190
graphic design related.

42
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.200
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers,

43
00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:48.920
including sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

44
00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:52.910
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

45
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.751
the brainstorming.

46
00:02:53.751 --> 00:02:57.080
A lot of it took place with designers from around the world and here's how it

47
00:02:57.081 --> 00:03:01.300
works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,
a website,

48
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.850
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be.

49
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.600
You submit that project and designers from around the world.

50
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.240
We'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

51
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.900
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

52
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:15.610
money back.
It's that straight forward,

53
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.330
and many of you who are listening have already used it and created some amazing

54
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:21.700
things that I'll be sharing in the future,
but in the meantime,

55
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.470

Tim.

59
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.110
Hello you sexy mixes is,

60
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:41.920
this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

61
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:46.060
my job is to attempt to deconstruct world class performers.

62
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.170
I interviewed the best of the best,
whether they be chess prodigies,

63
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.700
hedge fund managers,
billionaire startup investors,
actors,
politicians,

64
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:58.480
special ops operatives and generals and everything in between.

65
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.130
What I try to do is tease out the routines,
the habits,

66
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.910
the first 60 minutes of their day,
favorite books,

67
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.750
all the tools and tricks that you can apply to your own life to emulate and

68
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:13.270
hopefully replicate a lot of their success.

69
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.910
And this episode is by popular demand.

70
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.880
Many of you have asked for more scientists,

71
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.060
especially more unorthodox scientists,

72
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.830
and you've enjoyed past episodes with doctor Peter Attia,
Doctor Rhonda,

73
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:29.770
Patrick among others.
Those were very,
very popular.

74
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.000
And today I bring you Adam Gazzaley.

75
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.330
Adam Gazzaley has been requested by name and now you have them.

76
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.430
So Gozali the gas monster,
the gas man,
no one calls him any of those things,

77
00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:44.860
but he's a buddy of mine,
doctor Adam Gazzaley,

78
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.330
got his MD and phd in neuroscience at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New

79
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.140
York.
Then did his postdoc training and cognitive neuroscience at UC Berkeley.

80
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.830
Now he's the director of the Gozali lab at Uc San Francisco,

81
00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:59.140
which is a cognitive neuroscience lab.

82
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.330
And I've spent time in the lab with things stuck to my scalp getting zapped both

83
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:09.190
as a subject but also as an experimenter,
a very novice data gatherer.

84
00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:11.710
And I thank Adam for letting me bumble my way through that.

85
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.580
Adam has a very unique research approach in his lab,

86
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:19.450
they use a powerful combination of tools that are very often used in isolation,

87
00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:23.500
but in his lab they're combined.
So that includes FM Ri,

88
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.360
EEG end,
transcranial magnetic and electrical stimulation.
Now,

89
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:29.560
the last category,

90
00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:33.700
this stimulation has become a hot subject because you have people playing say

91
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.480
first person shooter games where they're taking a nine volt battery equivalent

92
00:05:37.481 --> 00:05:40.990
in charge and applying it to their scalps to improve accuracy.

93
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.110
It's trippy stuff and to start with his research using these tools and others

94
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:50.710
has expanded our understanding of the alterations in the brain that lead to age

95
00:05:50.711 --> 00:05:54.670
related cognitive decline.
But that's not enough obviously for me,

96
00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:56.890
most important or most interesting to me,

97
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.870
his recent work goes far beyond description.

98
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.980
He and his lab or exploring neuroplasticity and how we can optimize our

99
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:05.030
cognitive abilities,

100
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.960
even if we're healthy via engagement with custom designed video games.

101
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.150
And of course then that leads to the question,

102
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:14.330
what happens when you combine these games with neurofeedback,

103
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.750
electrical stimulation or even performance enhancing drugs.

104
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.730
What about using all of them at once?

105
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.580
Well that's just one of the things that we cover in this conversation,

106
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:26.780
which is very wide ranging and it gets dense in a few areas.

107
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.660
Bare with it.
Listen,
you will pick up a lot,

108
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.690
but we also talk about how he came to be as good at what he does as he has that

109
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:39.140
was a hell of a sentence.
And uh,
his routines,

110
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.700
all of the things that he does to bolster a worldclass operation and world class

111
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:47.450
performance.
So without further ado,
please enjoy Adam Gazzaley.

112
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.930
Adam,
sir,
welcome to the show.
Thank you very much.

113
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.920
So I am stoked to be in this beautiful office.
I've been in the cave all day.

114
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.590
You have more sunlight in your office and lab.

115
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.620
We're here at UCF and the name of the lab is cause I love of course,

116
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.510
very well named and uh,
I've had my brain shocked here.
Uh,

117
00:07:10.511 --> 00:07:14.370
I have I suppose,
participated in a shocking other brains,
uh,

118
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:15.850
to use a scientific term.

119
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.230
And you have parallettes under your desk.

120
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.230
Yes,
I do.
Yeah.
For,
for working out.

121
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.010
And I just found your entire career.
So fascinating.

122
00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:29.770
We've spent a lot of time together and I wanted to have you on the show to just

123
00:07:29.771 --> 00:07:33.340
explore all the nooks and crannies of this multifaceted life you've designed for

124
00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:36.770
yourself.
Uh,
and I thought we could start with,
um,

125
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.890
of course you're very good at hosting parties.

126
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.190
So when you're at such a part of your own,
your own party or otherwise,

127
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.990
if somebody asks you,
what do you do,
how do you answer that?
Ooh,
it's a,

128
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.150
it's not an easy question at a party,
but I definitely get asked that one.
Um,

129
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.700
you know,

130
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:56.700
I usually start by saying I'm a neurologist and a neuroscientist cause it sort

131
00:07:56.951 --> 00:07:59.530
of lays the framework from my perspective.

132
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.320
But if I have to get into a very short answer,

133
00:08:02.321 --> 00:08:07.321
then I dive right into the fact that my lab is interested in pursuing how we can

134
00:08:07.631 --> 00:08:10.540
enhance cognition,
uh,
to improve quality of life.

135
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:16.380
And you have a magazine cover outside of this lab on the wall and a that is

136
00:08:20.981 --> 00:08:25.390
nature and a,
you have work that is the cover story.

137
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:30.400
What,
uh,
what does that work?
What does the tagline on the,
on the cover.
Yeah.

138
00:08:30.401 --> 00:08:34.510
So nature was kind enough to put the title game changer on the,

139
00:08:34.511 --> 00:08:35.410
on the cover of the journal,

140
00:08:35.411 --> 00:08:38.950
which is quite a favorable pun for our lab I would say.

141
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.720
And uh,
the in the game itself.

142
00:08:43.721 --> 00:08:48.280
So that is a reference to,
I guess it was neuroracer this case.
Yeah.

143
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:53.110
And uh,
the,
the why was that such a game changer in their mind?

144
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.190
Well,
it's a good,
um,
I,
I

145
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:01.190
<v 2>think that what that paper was able to show that had not really been documented</v>

146
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:07.980
well before was that a team of scientists could work with video game

147
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:12.981
professionals to build something customized that targets a process in the brain

148
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:15.150
that's deficient in a certain population.

149
00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:18.660
In this case was older adults and their cognitive control abilities.

150
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.760
And then after you build that game,

151
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:25.650
you can go through a careful placebo controlled study with neural measures to

152
00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:30.651
document the mechanisms of the effect and show that you can create sustainable

153
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:35.190
and meaningful changes in the brain using a video game.
So the,

154
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.220
the aspect that I found most fascinating is the sustained part.

155
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:46.050
Uh,
so if we're looking at using very,
very,

156
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:51.040
a simple video games,
what video games that can be made quite sexy to say,
uh,

157
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:55.980
reverse or mitigate the cognitive decline associated with the progression of

158
00:09:55.981 --> 00:09:59.940
age.
Uh,
what did you see in terms of the persistence of effect?

159
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.900
Did they have to do it every day or that just fell off a cliff?
Well,

160
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:08.090
that was actually one of the most surprising findings of this study.
So,
uh,

161
00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:09.960
it took us a year to build a video game.

162
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:14.961
We work with friends of mine that were a professional video game designers and

163
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:19.140
engineers and artists at LucasArts back in 2008.

164
00:10:19.141 --> 00:10:23.820
So after a year of development,
it took us five years to do this study,
um,

165
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:28.170
which involved looking at lifespan changes from 20 to 80 years old and using the

166
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:31.240
game as a therapeutic to improve cognition.
Um,

167
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:36.180
our study involved one month of game play by the,
by older delts,
healthy to 60,

168
00:10:36.181 --> 00:10:39.660
60 to 80 year olds around the bay area and they'd played for one hour a day,

169
00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:43.740
three days a week for four weeks.
And then we look before and after it.

170
00:10:43.741 --> 00:10:46.560
What changed in terms of their cognitive abilities and what changed in their

171
00:10:46.561 --> 00:10:51.270
brain.
Um,
around six months or so,
pretty much around six months,

172
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:51.961
I realized,
wow,

173
00:10:51.961 --> 00:10:56.490
we should at least bring these folks back and see what's going on.
As a followup,

174
00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.570
as a followup.
It wasn't really planned or funded in the study,
but uh,

175
00:11:00.571 --> 00:11:04.740
we saw such profound changes in this group a month later that we just wanted to

176
00:11:04.741 --> 00:11:07.390
take a peek.
So we took these laptops back from them.
Uh,

177
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.400
many of them were upset to have lost access to the game,
uh,

178
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:16.430
which is pretty funny because they were pretty much all technically non savvy to

179
00:11:16.651 --> 00:11:20.490
say the least before they started playing and they get really good at the game

180
00:11:20.491 --> 00:11:24.540
and,
and they feel a connection with it so they haven't played the game in six

181
00:11:24.541 --> 00:11:27.770
months.
We bring them back and we just had them play the game again.

182
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.250
What we found shockingly enough was that their ability to multitask on this
game,

183
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:36.840
which is a notoriously challenging activity for older adults as we've documented

184
00:11:36.841 --> 00:11:40.630
and dozens of papers over the years.
Not to interrupt when we see our older,

185
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:41.910
when does that start to,

186
00:11:41.911 --> 00:11:45.630
is it like a 30 plus you just start to lose incrementally this ability?
Well,

187
00:11:45.631 --> 00:11:47.700
you know,
traditionally we tend to,

188
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:51.750
we tend to think of older is 65 and then it was 60 and then it was 50.

189
00:11:51.751 --> 00:11:55.220
And now from my perspective,
older as being more,
you know,

190
00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.470
older than 23 years old.
Um,
cause when we look at cognitive.
