00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.830
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.831 --> 00:00:07.831
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking a question.

3
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.570
I'm a cybernetic organism.

4
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.270
<v 1>This absurd is brought to you by four sigmatic,</v>

5
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.390
founded by the Genius Fin's who lit the Internet on fire and you may have heard

6
00:00:32.061 --> 00:00:35.690
of their mushroom coffee,
which features Chaga and lion's mane,

7
00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:37.880
which has taken Silicon Valley by storm.

8
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.820
I use it pretty much every day,

9
00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:45.740
either that or the Chaga,
which is decaf as a separate version,

10
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.280
and I use both of these primarily for focus and productivity.

11
00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:53.660
They just get you going let you up like a Christmas tree,

12
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.400
so definitely check it out.

13
00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.050
People are always asking me what I use for cognitive enhancement and for right

14
00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:04.640
now this is the answer.
I try to force this on all of my house guests.

15
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.110
It is a hell of a thing if I have employees or people come over who are working

16
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:09.861
on projects with me,

17
00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:13.700
I always try to feed it to them because I'm going to get the limitless effect

18
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.350
and get a lot more out of them.

19
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.390
The first time I mentioned this product and four sigmatic on the podcast,

20
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.580
their product sold out in less than a week,

21
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.830
so you may want to check them out soon.

22
00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:28.100
If you're listening to this and the coffee tastes like coffee,

23
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.820
it takes just seconds to prepare with hot water.

24
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.990
And oddly enough,
only includes 40 milligrams of caffeine.

25
00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:38.840
So it has less than half of what you would get in a regular cup of coffee.

26
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.220
I don't get any jitters,
acid reflux or any stomach burn,
any of that.

27
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.590
It's very unusual and very,
very cool.

28
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.360
So if you don't like caffeine,
they also offer very strong,

29
00:01:50.361 --> 00:01:54.020
but caffeine free mushroom elixirs,
which I will sometimes have in the evening.

30
00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:57.410
I find Chaga specifically to be very,
very grounding and earthy.

31
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.980
So that is another option.
And I have a cupboard full of their products,
uh,

32
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.770
at the moment,
which is right around the corner of my kitchen.

33
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.190
You can try something,
you can try a sample pack,
which is great.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.320

This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.
I get asked all the time,

41
00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:37.340
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

42
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.250
And my answer is inevitably Athletic Greens,

43
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:42.770
it is your all in one nutritional insurance.

44
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:44.510
I recommended it in the four hour body,

45
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.500
did not get paid for that and I travel with it to avoid getting sick.

46
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.530
I take it in the mornings to ensure optimal performance.

47
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.000
It just covers all my basis.

48
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.020
If I can't get what I need through whole food meals throughout the rest of the

49
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.120
day.

This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

59
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:35.650
it is always my job to deconstruct world class performers,

60
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.310
to share the thinking,
the habits,

61
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.340
the tips and tricks that you can apply in your own life,

62
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.350
whether those people come from the worlds of sports,
from chess,

63
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.520
from entertainment,
and in this case from investing.
I'm very,

64
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:56.470
very excited about this conversation that you are about to hear.
I had a blast.

65
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.770
It is with Ray Daleo who has been called the Steve jobs of investing and we'll

66
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:03.760
get to why that is the case.

67
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.840
This is Ray's first longform podcast ever,

68
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.080
which I'm extremely happy to debut here on Twitter at Ray Daleo.

69
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.340
You can say hello.
Grew up a middle class kid from long island.

70
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:19.990
He started his investment company,

71
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.020
Bridgewater associates out of a two bedroom apartment at age 26 now has roughly

72
00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:28.720
$160 billion in assets under management.

73
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.180
Over 42 years he built Bridgewater into what fortune considers the fifth most

74
00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:37.720
important private company in the United States.
Now along the way,

75
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.730
he also became one of the 100 most influential people in the world according to

76
00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:47.731
time and one of the 100 wealthiest people in the world according to Forbes and

77
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:52.030
because his unique investment principles have changed industries.

78
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:56.410
Cio magazine is the one who had dubbed him the Steve Jobs of investing.

79
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.060
Very important.

80
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.000
Ray believes that his success is the result of principles he's learned codafide

81
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.390
and applied it to his life in business and certainly at Bridgewater,

82
00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:11.230
and those principles are detailed in his new book principles,
subtitle,

83
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.730
life and business.
I highly,
highly recommend this book.

84
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.790
It has already changed how I think about making decisions in my life and in my

85
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:21.641
business.

86
00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:25.210
How I think about managing how I think about communications between teams.

87
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.760
I could go on and on and on and it features.

88
00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:30.940
Just check out the blurb from Bill Gates on the cover.

89
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.960
I'll give you an idea of the type of people who listen to ray very,

90
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:37.360
very closely in this interview.

91
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.070
We cover all sorts of ground including how ray thinks about investment
decisions,

92
00:05:42.071 --> 00:05:44.200
how he thinks about correlation for instance,
and so on.

93
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.460
The books he would give to every graduating high school or college senior,

94
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.050
how he might assess something like cryptocurrencies walking through the thought

95
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:55.090
process and much,

96
00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.120
much more we do get into backstory and how he became an investor and so on.

97
00:06:00.991 --> 00:06:05.570
If you want to just jump right into a bunch of nitty gritty investing detail

98
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:09.950
which does get into the weeds,
then you can jump about 90 minutes in.

99
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:15.010
But we do cover a lot of really good stuff and many principles that apply in the

100
00:06:15.971 --> 00:06:18.820
first 90 so I suggest that you listen to the whole thing,

101
00:06:18.821 --> 00:06:20.920
but if you're super impatient and you want to jump around,

102
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.850
you can jump about 90 minutes ahead and check that out.

103
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.850
So I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.
And without further ado,

104
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:30.680
here is Ray Dalio.

105
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.860
Ray.
Thanks for coming on the show.
I'm looking forward to it.

106
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:37.694
Thank you for having me.

107
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.150
I have been such a follower and fan of your work and your writing and my

108
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.550
audience has been asking when I would reach out to you to have you on the show.

109
00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:49.670
So this is,

110
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.670
this is a very exciting moment for me and I would love to start at the beginning

111
00:06:56.211 --> 00:07:00.850
because it seems like we have some,
at least shared geographic beginnings.

112
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.440
Where did you grow up and how would you describe your childhood?

113
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.310
<v 2>I grew up in new Hyde Park,</v>

114
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.260
a long island and um,

115
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.520
I would describe my childhood as being middle class or maybe a little bit lower

116
00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:21.730
middle class family.
My Dad was a jazz musician.

117
00:07:21.731 --> 00:07:25.810
My mother was a stay at home mom.
I was an only child.

118
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:31.330
<v 1>Were there any formative experiences you had say up until the end of college</v>

119
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:37.030
that ended up informing your decision to become involved with investing?

120
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.240
<v 2>Yeah,
when I was a kid I used to caddy and uh,</v>

121
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:45.060
at the time the stock market was hot when I was 12.

122
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.920
I got hooked on the markets.
I bought a company that,
you know,

123
00:07:49.921 --> 00:07:52.740
everybody was talking about the markets and um,

124
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:57.760
I decided I would take my caddying money and put it in the stock market.
And uh,

125
00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:59.490
so I picked a stock,

126
00:07:59.491 --> 00:08:03.930
the only stock I knew that was selling for less than $5 a share.

127
00:08:03.931 --> 00:08:05.490
And it was kind of a stupid idea,

128
00:08:05.491 --> 00:08:08.700
but I thought if I bought more shares in a way it up went up,

129
00:08:08.701 --> 00:08:12.940
I'd make more money.
The company was about to go bankrupt and I'm,

130
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.810
somebody came along and acquired it and I tripled my money.

131
00:08:15.811 --> 00:08:20.100
I was lucky and I was hooked on the stock market.
So that had a big effect that,

132
00:08:20.101 --> 00:08:20.550
you know.

133
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:25.550
So from then on it drove my old addiction to the game and everything I've been

134
00:08:27.301 --> 00:08:29.250
doing since related to my career.

135
00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.770
<v 1>I think that many people who are listening to this who,
no,</v>

136
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.370
your name and your bio,
uh,

137
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:41.410
have the impression perhaps that every time you've stepped up at bat you've hit

138
00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:44.030
home runs and it's just been an unending streak of home runs.

139
00:08:44.031 --> 00:08:49.031
And I'd like to maybe humanize the experiences you've had a little bit by

140
00:08:49.411 --> 00:08:54.300
talking about 1982 and I'll,
I'll,

141
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.170
I'll back it by reading just a,

142
00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.490
a short excerpt from your book,

143
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.530
which I think paints a good picture.
It begins with,

144
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.040
so there I was after eight years in business with nothing to show for it,

145
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.380
though I had been right much more than I'd been wrong.

146
00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.220
I was all the way back to square one.
At one point I'd lost so much money,

147
00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:18.460
I couldn't afford to pay the people who worked with me one by one.

148
00:09:18.461 --> 00:09:21.760
I had to let them go.
We went down to two employees,
Coleman and me.

149
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:26.140
Then Coleman had to go with tears from all his family packed up and returned to

150
00:09:26.141 --> 00:09:30.830
Oklahoma.
And at that point you were down to one employee.
That's you.

151
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.110
And to make ends meet,

152
00:09:33.111 --> 00:09:36.470
you had to borrow $4,000 from your dad until you could sell your second car.

153
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:37.680
How did that happen?

154
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.600
Could you describe what happened to that brought you to that point?

155
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:46.590
<v 2>Let me first say that by the way,
I'm a professional mistake maker.
Uh,
it,</v>

156
00:09:46.591 --> 00:09:47.424
you know,

157
00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:52.740
being in the markets or being an entrepreneur requires one to a bet against the

158
00:09:53.321 --> 00:09:56.380
consensus and when one does that a fair amount of times,

159
00:09:56.381 --> 00:09:58.090
you're going to be wrong.
A fair amount of times.

160
00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.700
I've learned a lot more from my mistakes.

161
00:10:00.701 --> 00:10:02.740
So I just want to let you know that anybody,

162
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:06.400
any perception that being right as part of it,
no,

163
00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.210
the main thing is knowing what you don't know and how to deal with it.

164
00:10:10.211 --> 00:10:11.044
But anyway,

165
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.710
what happened at the time as I analyzed the payments,

166
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.240
uh,
that countries,

167
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.670
oh banks and I calculated that those countries,

168
00:10:22.671 --> 00:10:25.430
we're not going to be able to pay the U s back.

169
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:30.500
And it was a very controversial view at the time.
And as a result of that,

170
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:35.560
I took positions in the markets and I got a lot of attention because Mexico

171
00:10:38.101 --> 00:10:43.080
defaulted on its debt and not many people had expected that.
And I did.

172
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.730
And um,
I had these positions on and I thought the stock,
my,

173
00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:50.370
I thought we were going to go into a depression.

174
00:10:50.371 --> 00:10:53.220
I thought the stock market was going to go through the floor.

175
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.620
I just didn't understand really.

176
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.940
And the stock market,
uh,
rose,

177
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:04.970
and this was after I had testified to Congress and I was on Wall Street Week and

178
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.650
then I lost the money that you referred to and you know that that's how it

179
00:11:10.651 --> 00:11:12.960
happened.
Then in retrospect,

180
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:18.020
it really was the best thing that ever happened to me because it gave me the

181
00:11:18.241 --> 00:11:22.590
humility that I needed to become more successful.
And that was because,

182
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:23.551
you know,

183
00:11:23.551 --> 00:11:28.500
I shifted my attitude from thinking I'm right to asking myself,

184
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.940
how do I know I'm right?
And that opened my mind a lot.

185
00:11:32.941 --> 00:11:37.941
It made me look for people who disagreed with the smartest and it also made me

186
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.890
manage my risks better and so on.
So that's the story

187
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.250
<v 1>I'd look,
Dude,
dig into mistakes.</v>

188
00:11:45.251 --> 00:11:49.270
I think this will be a common thread throughout the conversation.

189
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:53.530
I have read,
and correct me if I'm wrong,
but that you're a fan of instance,

190
00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:57.520
the book Einstein's mistakes,
subtitled the human failings of genius.

191
00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.880
He was one of the greatest minds of the 20th century,
made a lot of mistakes.

192
00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:06.210
You have a,
an expression is pain plus reflection equals progress.

193
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.770
In.
My understanding is that at Bridgewater you have,

194
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.633
for instance,

195
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:16.700
a lengthy assessment sessions in which employees discuss their mistakes.

196
00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:22.180
What type of post mortem did you do after all that happened in 1982 or did that

197
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.040
come later?

198
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:30.330
The type of post game analysis that you would do on what led to that mistake?

199
00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.910
<v 2>I think for everyone,
and for me at the time when you encountered the mistake,</v>

200
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:40.590
you experience in that pain and there's an emotional pain and that was true for

201
00:12:41.541 --> 00:12:42.290
me at the time,

202
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:47.290
and then pain passes and it requires thought and making the connection of what

203
00:12:50.211 --> 00:12:54.260
did I do wrong and being analytical about it,

204
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:59.410
and that was that experience and that led me to do that as a habit.

205
00:13:01.371 --> 00:13:04.070
It became an increased habit.
I would literally,

206
00:13:04.071 --> 00:13:08.000
every time I would make a mistake,
I would develop an instinct.

207
00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.180
So it changed my attitude about mistakes.

208
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:16.560
I think basically they became like puzzles and if I solve the puzzle,

209
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.790
the puzzle being what would I do differently in the future,

210
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:27.180
I would get a gem and that Jim would be a principal that would let me do a

211
00:13:29.471 --> 00:13:31.030
better job the next time.

212
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:36.090
That sort of thing came about and I wrote those principles down and refined them

213
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:40.060
over a period of time,
which is what makes up my book.

214
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:45.450
But it was that process of making enough mistakes and having painful mistakes

215
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:51.630
that led to an instinctual reaction to have reflections on what I could have

216
00:13:52.451 --> 00:13:57.451
done differently that led to the progress that I'm referring to.

217
00:13:57.851 --> 00:14:02.320
When I say pain plus reflection equals progress.
And I think we all learn.

218
00:14:02.321 --> 00:14:04.840
I don't,
I don't think it's particularly just true of me.

219
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:09.490
I mean I think anybody who is open minded and smart knows you're going to learn

220
00:14:09.491 --> 00:14:10.480
more from mistakes.

221
00:14:10.481 --> 00:14:15.481
There's so much more that you can learn from mistakes because I mean mistakes

222
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:16.720
look,
I mean,

223
00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.720
first of all they are giving you a loud signal and rewards keep you doing the

224
00:14:22.091 --> 00:14:25.700
same things.
And so you don't grow from,
uh,
successes.

225
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:30.080
Successes keep you doing the same thing.
So you don't grow from successes,

226
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.840
mistakes,
if you can deal with them.

227
00:14:32.841 --> 00:14:37.340
The right way is where the growth w plus the reflection is where the growth

228
00:14:37.341 --> 00:14:39.320
comes from.
So anyway,
that's what happened.

229
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:44.660
<v 1>Could you give an example from your life of a particular mistake in how you did</v>

230
00:14:48.341 --> 00:14:52.970
that analysis or reflection after the fact and what you learned from it?

231
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:57.450
<v 2>Well,
I mean there are just so many mistakes.
When I was,</v>

232
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.130
oh,
just,
uh,
getting out of college,

233
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:06.400
I clerked on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and this is when the

234
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:09.970
dollar was attached to gold.
And uh,

235
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:15.070
there was a financial crisis and Richard Nixon gets on the television and says

236
00:15:16.141 --> 00:15:17.910
there's no more attachment to gold.

237
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And back then money was like checks in a checkbook that didn't have much value.

238
00:15:25.051 --> 00:15:29.190
What really mattered was the fact that you could get something tangible in the

239
00:15:29.191 --> 00:15:31.110
form of gold,
that you can make the conversion.

240
00:15:31.111 --> 00:15:35.700
So it was a crisis who are money wouldn't be taken and other countries and so
on.

241
00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:40.860
And I walked on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange Express expecting a

242
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:44.070
collapse and the stock market went through the roof.

243
00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:47.670
It never happened to me before.
So that was the case.

244
00:15:47.671 --> 00:15:50.940
And I went and researched currency declines in the past.

245
00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.840
And I learned that had happened before,
but just not in my lifetime.

246
00:15:54.841 --> 00:15:59.841
And one of the things that I've learned over the years is that many surprises

247
00:15:59.951 --> 00:16:04.951
come because they know things that happen as surprises never happened in one's

248
00:16:04.991 --> 00:16:05.980
lifetime before.

249
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:11.580
So that it's advantageous to look at beyond one's lifetime or beyond one's own

250
00:16:13.811 --> 00:16:18.811
experiences to understand how the world works so that one can anticipate all of

251
00:16:21.911 --> 00:16:25.330
those things and learn all the rules of how the world works.

252
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:30.150
And that's the beauty of it,
right?
And that's the excitement to learn.
You know,

253
00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.850
how does reality work?
What are the cause effect relationships?

254
00:16:33.851 --> 00:16:38.380
And then how do I deal with my realities?
So that's a case,

255
00:16:38.381 --> 00:16:41.290
but I mean there are,
you know,
there are so many mistakes.

256
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:47.300
<v 1>I would like to dig into the research of,
of history,</v>

257
00:16:47.301 --> 00:16:49.700
things that have happened outside of your lifetime.

258
00:16:49.701 --> 00:16:51.500
Because I read that for instance,

259
00:16:51.501 --> 00:16:56.501
while on one hand you have say Soros who might credit the influence of Karl

260
00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:56.950
Popper,

261
00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:01.950
who is one of his teachers at one point you've talked about diving very deeply

262
00:17:03.751 --> 00:17:06.510
into past periods of economic upheaval,
right?

263
00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.750
The great depression or reading daily newspapers from those eras.

264
00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:15.680
Are there other practices or approaches that you've taken to examine history?

265
00:17:17.771 --> 00:17:22.771
Are there any particular types of books or resources that you go into like that

266
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:25.360
to try to get a better picture of reality?

267
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:29.070
<v 2>Before I deal with the particular economic history,
I'll,</v>

268
00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:34.290
I'll start off by saying I believe that basically everything is another one of

269
00:17:34.291 --> 00:17:35.550
those.
In other words,

270
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.500
almost everything happens over and over and over again through history.

271
00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:46.370
And that the key to success is to identify what one of those it is and to look

272
00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.030
how it's worked in the many,
many,
many times.

273
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.820
And then to understand the cause,

274
00:17:53.821 --> 00:17:57.960
effect relationships to develop one's principles for dealing with it so it can

275
00:17:57.961 --> 00:17:59.300
be applied to anything.
Um,

276
00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.940
we were talking about economics to talk about politics.

277
00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:08.170
Nowadays we're hearing the term populist and populism is something that is a

278
00:18:09.981 --> 00:18:12.630
bigger phenomenon that,
uh,

279
00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.990
that we're used to in our lifetimes.

280
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:20.110
The time that populism was flourished the most was in the 1930s pretty much

281
00:18:21.471 --> 00:18:26.180
leading up to World War II.
And so,
um,
I use that as an example,
I think,

282
00:18:26.181 --> 00:18:30.800
okay,
where were the populists in history?
Where were those cases?

283
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.690
How does this thing happen?
What are the,
how does it grow?

284
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:40.430
How does it develop?
What are the usual linkages and why?
And so,

285
00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.530
um,
that's been,
I think,

286
00:18:42.531 --> 00:18:46.900
very helpful more recently and my understanding,
um,

287
00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.060
quite a bit about what's going on,
it's affected my perspective.

288
00:18:50.061 --> 00:18:53.960
So it doesn't have to be just reading history books that,
you know,

289
00:18:53.961 --> 00:18:58.961
it's in anything that people have a new child and they treat it as though that's

290
00:18:59.871 --> 00:19:04.820
the first time anybody's had a child.
But you gain perspective,
you can apply it,

291
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
you know,
gain that perspective of what's happened over and over.
Uh,

292
00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:12.890
and it can be applied to anything if you start thinking that way.

293
00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:14.210
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

294
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.610
<v 2>it's radically beneficial.</v>

295
00:19:16.611 --> 00:19:19.670
So that way when I'm referring to that is in other words,

296
00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.060
what is this?
What,

297
00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:27.100
what one of these is it and how do those things work and what are my principles

298
00:19:29.031 --> 00:19:30.050
for dealing with it?

299
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:35.720
Then life is a whole lot easier if you're not dealing with it that way.

300
00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:41.440
Everything is a one off and you'll be in the middle of a blizzard of things and

301
00:19:41.751 --> 00:19:46.751
you won't step above those and and deal with those instinctual principles.

302
00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.770
For example,
you have your principles,

303
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.270
I really admire your stoicism.

304
00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:53.780
<v 3>Okay.</v>

305
00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:57.740
<v 2>And I think you could rattle those principles off and you make the connection</v>

306
00:19:57.741 --> 00:20:02.120
and it's connected to your realities.
So we each have our own,

307
00:20:02.121 --> 00:20:05.480
I don't want to keep it in the realm of just economics because it applies to

308
00:20:05.481 --> 00:20:06.050
everything.

309
00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:07.360
<v 1>Definitely.
Well,</v>

310
00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:11.700
I would love to talk about problem solving,

311
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:16.410
and I'm sure principals will tie in here,
but let's just say hypothetically,

312
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:21.210
and I'm sure this is maybe a real case at,
at Bridgewater over many,
many years,

313
00:20:21.211 --> 00:20:24.910
but if you have someone who's working at Bridgewater,
very,
very smart,

314
00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:29.140
very ambitious,
and they've made a mistake and they are the,

315
00:20:29.141 --> 00:20:30.550
they enter an assessment session,

316
00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:36.210
what is the format look like and how do you help them separate symptoms of

317
00:20:38.231 --> 00:20:41.950
problems from the root causes and the actual problems?

318
00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.070
<v 2>I think the first thing that I have to convey is that,
uh,</v>

319
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.130
we have an idea of meritocracy.
So it's not like

320
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.400
<v 4>somebody who's called into a room and the people like me are the bosses think</v>

321
00:20:54.191 --> 00:20:58.780
that they know the answer and that they're making an assessment of how that

322
00:20:58.781 --> 00:21:01.900
person is.
And then they write down those notes.
No,
no,
no.

323
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:06.730
It's everybody's equal and having an opinion.
And by and large,

324
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:11.350
um,
if the person that's receiving,

325
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.930
they receive great and bad feedback,
um,
and,

326
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:20.920
and I roughy receive great and bad feedback in a night.
Nonhierarchical way.

327
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.150
Uh,

328
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:26.920
we approach it with the idea of how do we find out if it's true.

329
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.960
So it's got to be evidence based.

330
00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:33.340
And then we will set up a tests.
Let's say if your,

331
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:37.450
if you get bad feedback,
we're down talking about bad feedback.

332
00:21:37.451 --> 00:21:39.970
It could be for good feedback but if you,
um,

333
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:44.070
if somebody is thinking somebody's not very good at something,
um,

334
00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:45.640
they're speaking honestly.

335
00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:51.570
Most importantly it's that people can be radically honest with each other and

336
00:21:51.791 --> 00:21:55.780
they'll say,
um,
I don't think you're very good at that.
And they said,

337
00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:57.100
I am very good at that.

338
00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:01.600
And then you go through a series of tests to think it's evidenced based to try

339
00:22:01.601 --> 00:22:03.430
to find out if somebody is good and bad at that.

340
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.960
And then you move beyond that to think,
okay,
well what can I do to get better?

341
00:22:07.961 --> 00:22:12.961
Or how can I guard rail myself so that if I'm weak at something and somebody

342
00:22:13.481 --> 00:22:15.880
else's strong at that thing,
we can work together.

343
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:21.370
The main thing here is to get at what people are like,
you know,

344
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.560
this is,
to me,
it's a weird world

345
00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:27.323
<v 0>that</v>

346
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:32.900
<v 4>there's a phobia about making mistakes and there's a phobia about knowing one's</v>

347
00:22:35.251 --> 00:22:36.090
weaknesses.

348
00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:41.580
Mistakes are part of the process and everybody has weaknesses.

349
00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.440
The greatest people I know have weaknesses and have become successful because

350
00:22:46.441 --> 00:22:49.140
they know how to compensate for the weaknesses.
They're aware,

351
00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:53.790
the stupidest people I know at least successful people I know are people who

352
00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.100
don't own up to those weaknesses and grow.

353
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
So the exercises that we're going through or by people who choose to want to be

354
00:23:03.691 --> 00:23:05.850
an a radically truthful,

355
00:23:05.851 --> 00:23:09.810
a radically transparent environment and be evidence based,

356
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:15.660
but it's difficult.
It's difficult because,
um,
we're not brought up that way.

357
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:20.430
Um,
the,
it takes about 18 months to get used to it because there's the subliminal

358
00:23:20.431 --> 00:23:21.264
reactions.

359
00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:25.500
Now maybe this is related to the pain button APP.

360
00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.700
I maybe not,

361
00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:31.760
but could you describe the function of the pain button APP and,

362
00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.030
and why that was created?
Yeah,
it's,
it's like I said,

363
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:40.980
pain plus reflection equals progress.
Whatever your form of pain,

364
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:44.960
the best thing to do is to record it.
So this,

365
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:49.010
the way it works is as you experience psychological pain,

366
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:54.350
you just quickly log it.
You don't analyze it at the time,
but you capture it.

367
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:58.100
What was it about or who was it with?
What happened exactly?

368
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:04.360
The nature of psychological pain is that it passes fairly quickly.

369
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:06.500
Um,
the Amygdala,

370
00:24:06.501 --> 00:24:10.550
this part of the brain is the part that's the fight or flight Barb that gets

371
00:24:10.551 --> 00:24:13.700
adrenaline and it reacts quickly.
And then over a period of time,

372
00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:17.330
whatever the form of psychological pain it diminishes,

373
00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:22.010
and that's an opportunity to reflect.
And because it's been captured in the APP,

374
00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.490
it,
uh,

375
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:29.230
then can allow somebody to go back and reflect on that and reflect on what you

376
00:24:29.691 --> 00:24:32.520
should do about it when the next one comes along.
And,
um,

377
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.130
is it speak to the person who caused you the pain is whatever it might be.

378
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.370
And you write that down and you record it.

379
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.970
And because it keeps in a graphic way,

380
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:49.310
a presentation,
um,
graphs,
your pains,

381
00:24:49.311 --> 00:24:51.560
the different types of pains and the causes.

382
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:57.130
It gives you sort of a bio feedback that allows you to see if your actions are

383
00:24:59.601 --> 00:25:04.460
reducing that pain and worthy and that might prompt you to change your actions.

384
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:08.510
Or it also shows whether you're following through on your actions.

385
00:25:08.511 --> 00:25:11.810
Let's say you're having a problem with the same person doing the same thing,

386
00:25:11.811 --> 00:25:14.060
causing your pain,
but you're just bottling it up.

387
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:19.130
That then if you choose to keep bottling it up,
you're not going to resolve it.

388
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:22.280
It's just going to happen over and over again.
That'll show up in the graph.

389
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
But if you do something about it and you ride it down and you can analyze it.

390
00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:34.100
And so it sort of provides that kind of biofeedback that allows people to make

391
00:25:34.101 --> 00:25:37.110
that progress.
And a lot of people have told me,
you know,

392
00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.250
that it's better than a psychologist because it's there,
you know,

393
00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:45.430
every day of the week.
And,
and you can see yourself,
um,
how you're,
what,

394
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.620
what's causing your pain,
what sorts of pains you have.

395
00:25:48.621 --> 00:25:53.621
And it makes it an intellectual exercise to come up with strategies to um,

396
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:59.240
do those things that stop causing you those pains and get you what you want

397
00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.440
<v 1>for developing.</v>

398
00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:05.700
In addition to using this type of logging tool,

399
00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:09.780
whether it's the APP or if someone's carrying around a small journal with them

400
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:15.460
so that they don't have misremember the details of,

401
00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:16.930
of when they're triggered.
For instance.

402
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:22.500
Are there any tools that you have found helpful for people in general employees

403
00:26:23.771 --> 00:26:28.730
yourself?
And one that comes to mind?
Maybe you could,
you could chat about,

404
00:26:28.731 --> 00:26:31.640
and I'd love to hear about any others,
but his transcendental meditation.

405
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:33.370
And I've,

406
00:26:33.371 --> 00:26:37.500
I've read for instance that you've said creativity comes from open mindedness

407
00:26:37.501 --> 00:26:40.830
and centerdness seeing things in a non emotionally charged way.

408
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.960
Could you talk about

409
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:48.530
<v 4>TM and any other tools that you have found to compliment the pain button?</v>

410
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.510
So let,
let me,
let me say the tools in general,

411
00:26:51.511 --> 00:26:56.511
we have developed a whole bunch of tools that it'd be fun to explain to you in

412
00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:00.390
all different ways that are constantly being used.

413
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.720
And they were just invaluable there.
They're great.
And I,

414
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:08.430
but I want it turned my attention to transcendental meditation,

415
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:12.990
which unlike let's say,
a ADAP type tool or,
um,

416
00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:17.640
some other kind of tool is a practice that I'd been doing for,

417
00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:23.100
I don't know,
since 1969,
whatever that is.
Um,
anyway,

418
00:27:23.101 --> 00:27:26.880
a long time.
And,
um,
uh,

419
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:32.300
I think it's worth noting that everything in our brain,

420
00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:35.220
um,

421
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:39.930
every emotion we feel is physiological.

422
00:27:39.931 --> 00:27:41.880
There are chemicals that go through our brains,

423
00:27:41.881 --> 00:27:46.770
electronics that go through our brain and they produce these impacts.

424
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:51.830
And transcendental meditation is a practice that takes one from one's conscious

425
00:27:55.081 --> 00:28:00.081
mind to go into almost a subconscious state and allows one to relax.

426
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.430
And,
and it's almost a blissful experience.

427
00:28:05.431 --> 00:28:10.380
It relieves all stress and it brings one into the subconscious mind.

428
00:28:10.381 --> 00:28:14.910
And through brain scans,
they see that the Amygdala,

429
00:28:14.911 --> 00:28:19.170
which is that fight or flight part of the brain calms down.

430
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:24.270
Actually in some cases,
they conjecture that it physically changes.

431
00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.350
And the prefrontal cortex part of the brain,

432
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.660
which is kind of that more thoughtful part,
uh,

433
00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.900
lights up in is enhanced.

434
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:39.110
And so that practice not only creates,
uh,

435
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.320
an equanimity,

436
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:44.730
but by bringing one into the subconscious part of the brain,

437
00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.300
it significantly enhances the creativity.

438
00:28:48.301 --> 00:28:53.301
It essentially opens a passage from the subconscious to the conscious.

439
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.900
So that can be a reconciliation of those and F and it's really from the

440
00:28:57.901 --> 00:29:02.310
subconscious where creativity comes from.
I mean,
if you think about it,
um,

441
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:07.590
one doesn't go muscle creativity like are doing a mathematical calculation or

442
00:29:07.591 --> 00:29:10.350
something.
It's really like if you're ultra relaxed,

443
00:29:10.351 --> 00:29:14.670
maybe you take a hot shower and these great ideas come to you or you're sleeping

444
00:29:14.671 --> 00:29:15.810
and these things pop up.

445
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:20.680
They come from your subconscious part of your brain that where the intuition

446
00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:22.080
that comes from.

447
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:27.390
And so by opening that passage essentially between the subconscious part of the

448
00:29:27.391 --> 00:29:32.220
brain and the conscious part of the brain,
it's um,
it's wonderful.
It,

449
00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:36.390
it makes one more creative.
It makes one a calmer.

450
00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:41.420
It makes one almost a little bit like a Ninja in a sense that everything

451
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:48.150
with that equanimity seems to be coming at you in a more controlled centered way

452
00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.770
so that you can react to it.
Well,

453
00:29:50.771 --> 00:29:54.070
and so I've found transcendental meditation to be invaluable.

454
00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:59.520
<v 1>The specifics here of great interest to me for a number of reasons.
Uh,</v>

455
00:29:59.521 --> 00:30:04.521
the f the first is that I practice if a few different types of meditation,

456
00:30:04.931 --> 00:30:07.240
but I did a TM session this morning for instance,

457
00:30:07.241 --> 00:30:11.230
for 21 minutes because I find it takes about a minute for me just to stop

458
00:30:11.231 --> 00:30:14.830
fidgeting and get settled.
But when do you typically,

459
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.320
do you do two sessions a day?
When do you typically do your TM?

460
00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:24.110
Uh,
do you have particular location?
Any specifics,
uh,

461
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.800
of that practice would be very great to hear.
Uh,

462
00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:32.560
because the team has come up a number of times,
uh,
and I find it very secular,

463
00:30:32.561 --> 00:30:36.670
which appeals to me from people like Rick Rubin,
legendary music producer,

464
00:30:36.671 --> 00:30:41.260
Chase Jarvis,
uh,
extremely accomplished photographer and CEO.

465
00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.560
Um,
what is,
what,
what are some of the details of your practice?

466
00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:45.891
<v 4>Well,</v>

467
00:30:45.891 --> 00:30:50.891
I think one of the things is don't over worry about the details too much.

468
00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:52.760
Just,
uh,
do it.

469
00:30:52.761 --> 00:30:57.740
But the best way to do it is you do it before breakfast and you do it,

470
00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:01.820
uh,
before dinner.
Having not eaten much in or not eating.

471
00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:03.560
And um,

472
00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:08.120
and you do it for the 20 minutes as you point out and that you do it twice a
day.

473
00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.060
That's the,
you know,
established practice.

474
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:13.550
I basically do it,

475
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:17.810
let's say sort of two thirds of the days and I would say I probably,

476
00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:21.200
maybe some days we'll do it once and not twice.

477
00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:24.810
But I also always do it in addition,

478
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:29.400
whenever I have that feeling of doing it as,
as a meditator,

479
00:31:29.401 --> 00:31:32.580
you probably know that you,
you can feel the difference.

480
00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.290
So as you're going through the day,

481
00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:39.650
you carry through almost an ability to shift yourself from a state of mind where

482
00:31:42.661 --> 00:31:46.770
there might be a twinge of anxiety and then you can bring yourself into that

483
00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:52.290
equanimity type of state.
But you also,
I also find that,

484
00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:53.160
um,

485
00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:58.160
there's a time where I say I need to go meditate and then I'll just meditate and

486
00:31:58.711 --> 00:32:03.510
I'll meditate where I can when I can.
I mean,
I prefer,

487
00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:08.490
you know,
a quiet place,
comfortable spot.
I'm not rigid about the location,

488
00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:13.920
but if it was standing in my way,
my circumstances were standing in my way.

489
00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:17.880
Um,
I would meditate on a plane.
Uh,
I would meditate,

490
00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.240
you know,
we're wherever I could.
If it was a,

491
00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:24.360
if it was noisy and then I was on a train,

492
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:29.250
I would still meditate.
The meditation may not be as deep,

493
00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:32.310
it won't be as deep,
but it is so good.

494
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
It could be a noisy outside and I can still go from one state to another,

495
00:32:38.311 --> 00:32:41.420
not the deep subconscious state,

496
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.280
but the state of,
let's say,

497
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:50.150
tension to relaxation.
And so that's how I'd do it.

498
00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:52.480
<v 1>For those people who are familiar with transcendental meditation,</v>

499
00:32:52.481 --> 00:32:54.520
it's thought of as mantra based meditation.

500
00:32:54.521 --> 00:32:59.130
Since the repetition typically characterized by the repetition of a mantra or

501
00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:03.460
say a one or two syllable sound that you do not say out loud,

502
00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:08.120
do you sit down and immediately go into the repetition of the mantra?

503
00:33:08.121 --> 00:33:12.340
Or do you take time to focus on your breath or your bodily sensations of,

504
00:33:12.341 --> 00:33:16.310
before you go into the mantra,
repetition.

505
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:21.540
<v 4>I take a few minutes to settle myself.
John,
just as you're describing.
Got It.</v>

506
00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:23.050
You know,
just,
yeah,

507
00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:27.370
just as you're describing and it feels good at that moment and then you go into

508
00:33:27.371 --> 00:33:28.160
it.

509
00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:28.993
<v 1>Got It.</v>

510
00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:34.220
And you mentioned before we delved into the TM,
uh,

511
00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:37.990
other tools that you and the people at Bridgewater have developed.

512
00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:41.110
I'd love to hear you describe any of those.

513
00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:43.770
<v 4>Those tools are,
I'm like,</v>

514
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.800
people carry around an iPad with them.

515
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:51.120
And whenever we go into meetings,
uh,

516
00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:56.150
there's a tool we call a doc collector and it's a very easy tool to allow people

517
00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:04.500
to express what they think is going on and how people are doing.

518
00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:08.100
And so in all meetings,

519
00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:14.420
there's this data that's collected that shows what everybody's thinking while

520
00:34:16.591 --> 00:34:17.760
the meeting is going on.

521
00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:23.120
Now it's invaluable in many cases because you're seeing what everybody's

522
00:34:23.851 --> 00:34:27.750
thinking.
So it's so different and unordinary meeting,

523
00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:30.060
it's silent largely.
I mean,

524
00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:34.680
there's one person speaking at a time and you don't know what the other people

525
00:34:34.681 --> 00:34:39.030
are thinking.
In this particular case,
what you do was all the time,

526
00:34:39.031 --> 00:34:43.120
you see how people are seeing things differently.
And so we,

527
00:34:43.121 --> 00:34:48.121
we do is we take that data as it's happening and the computer does.

528
00:34:49.261 --> 00:34:52.610
We have a programmed with algorithms that,
uh,

529
00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:57.620
we'll look at that data and we'll then communicate back to them,

530
00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:01.440
uh,
advice cause they,
this,
this computer behind.

531
00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:06.120
We'll then use that to know how they think differently.
And by the way,

532
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:07.890
it's enlightening.

533
00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:13.010
You would have no idea how differently people's brains are working in a meeting

534
00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.570
or work in general.
The things they pay attention to,

535
00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:22.830
the ways of the interpreted are startlingly different.

536
00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.430
And they have the same kind of patterns to them.

537
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000
And so that discovery allows people to know how they see things different and

538
00:35:33.121 --> 00:35:36.000
appreciate how other people things see things different.

539
00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.190
And then they take that,

540
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.180
then that allows them to know how to interact better.

541
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:46.620
So the computer through the side pad,
uh,
um,

542
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:51.180
is doing processing in the background and it will then also coach them.

543
00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:55.740
In other words,
when they're dealing with somebody else or the,
um,

544
00:35:55.890 --> 00:36:00.090
it will provide guidance.
It will provide feedback that's continuous.

545
00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:04.410
So it's a tremendous tool,
but because you know what everybody's thinking,

546
00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:09.440
it's analyzing how everybody's thinking provides that feedback and um,

547
00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:15.530
gathers information across all of those people and processes it by being able to

548
00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:19.890
see relationships that no one person sees.

549
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:25.350
So it's invaluable in an idea meritocracy.
We also use it for making decisions.

550
00:36:25.351 --> 00:36:29.400
We do something that we call believability weighted decision making.

551
00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:33.730
If you can elaborate on that,
I'd love to deaf to hear more about it.
Well,

552
00:36:33.731 --> 00:36:36.160
you want to have an idea meritocracy.
If,

553
00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:41.010
if you and I were partners and we had a group of people and we were partners,

554
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:46.150
how are we going to decide on the best things to do?
We're,

555
00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:51.720
I think we're going to want to idea meritocracy is when the best ideas went out.

556
00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:55.290
You have to have rules for doing that.
You have that procedures.

557
00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:59.430
So there are three things you need to do.

558
00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:04.320
The first is that you have to put your honest thoughts on the table.

559
00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:08.820
A lot of people are hesitant to do that.
They keep their honest thoughts back.

560
00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:13.830
But if you have a culture in which you can put your honest thoughts on the table

561
00:37:13.831 --> 00:37:16.050
and everybody does,
and that's the way it operates,

562
00:37:16.051 --> 00:37:20.040
now you see what people are really thinking.
Great.
That's a good first step.

563
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:25.470
Second step is you have to have thoughtful disagreement.

564
00:37:25.471 --> 00:37:27.870
You have to know the art of thoughtful disagreement.

565
00:37:27.871 --> 00:37:31.840
So there are processes that we go through in which,
um,

566
00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.020
people are really hearing each other.

567
00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:39.180
And as you go through that process to make better decisions than they could

568
00:37:39.181 --> 00:37:40.050
individually.

569
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.400
And then the third thing is if disagreements remain,

570
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:49.790
you have to have idea meritocratic ways of getting past that disagreement.

571
00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.080
You're going to do that.

572
00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:57.080
If most places it's either autocratic or democratic.

573
00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:00.560
Autocratic means the one with the power and makes the decision.

574
00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:06.380
The boss makes the decision.
Democratic is one man,

575
00:38:06.381 --> 00:38:10.250
one vote,
and it treats everybody as though they're equally valuable.

576
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:14.690
So we do what we call believability weighted decision making.

577
00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:17.120
We have ways,
well,

578
00:38:17.121 --> 00:38:21.110
let's just imagine what it is before we get to how we get to it.

579
00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:23.050
Um,

580
00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:27.980
imagine you knew each person's believability.

581
00:38:27.981 --> 00:38:31.750
Who's a better decision maker at watch?
So I'll use an example.

582
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:36.940
If you had a medical condition and you went to doctors and you had a friend,

583
00:38:36.941 --> 00:38:40.540
well you would know your doctors better than your friend and some doctors are

584
00:38:40.541 --> 00:38:44.960
better than other doctors.
And so consciously,
um,

585
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:49.490
you're probably weighing those decisions with consideration given to their

586
00:38:49.491 --> 00:38:53.150
believability.
In our place.

587
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:58.210
We have ways of determining people's believability in many different dimensions.

588
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:03.530
Maybe if it's,
uh,
a,

589
00:39:03.531 --> 00:39:07.730
an accountant today would have greater believability and accounting or maybe if

590
00:39:07.731 --> 00:39:10.580
it's somebody who is more creative,
we're give them,

591
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:14.540
there are more points that they actually get and they know that that person's

592
00:39:14.541 --> 00:39:19.541
more creative and somebody else might be more reliable and would work well with

593
00:39:19.551 --> 00:39:21.590
the person who is creative.
And so what we,

594
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:25.400
because if we didn't have this believability's according to all of those

595
00:39:25.401 --> 00:39:27.770
dimensions,
when we make a decision,

596
00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:33.050
we make a believability weighted decision.
We literally on the IPAD say,

597
00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:34.340
would you do this?

598
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:39.910
And then everybody votes and it calculates what the vote is on a believability

599
00:39:41.121 --> 00:39:45.860
weighted basis as well as um,
on an absolute basis.

600
00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:46.790
And,
um,

601
00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:52.180
that idea meritocracy not only produces better decision making,

602
00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:58.060
but it also produces a fairness that everybody believes that the system is fair.

603
00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:03.860
And that is invaluable because when you have disagreements or you even have

604
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:06.030
assessments,
um,

605
00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:11.050
which people are sensitive to and you do that in a way that everybody agrees is

606
00:40:11.391 --> 00:40:13.370
fair,
um,

607
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:17.330
that means that they will go along with it more that they,

608
00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:21.770
the game is fair and,
um,
and,
and it's,
uh,

609
00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:25.370
it works much better in getting past disagreements.
So as I said,

610
00:40:25.371 --> 00:40:29.330
the third step is how do you get past the disagreements if they remain?

611
00:40:29.331 --> 00:40:32.900
And we tried to do that in an idea meritocratic way through believability

612
00:40:32.901 --> 00:40:33.950
weighted decision making.

613
00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:40.230
<v 1>What are some of the rules or guidelines that you have for preventing</v>

614
00:40:41.131 --> 00:40:46.131
disagreement from devolving into highly emotionally charged fighting in the,

615
00:40:48.411 --> 00:40:52.280
in other words,
uh,
is it similar to say nonviolent communication?

616
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:57.370
Are there specific rules that you think perhaps listeners could also borrow that

617
00:40:59.431 --> 00:41:02.810
you've found to be very helpful?
Uh,
for thoughtful disagreement?

618
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:07.020
<v 4>You know,
there's a whole series of protocols.
For example,
there's a,</v>

619
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.770
there's what we call the two minute rule.

620
00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:12.900
Two minute rule means that if I say the two minute rule,

621
00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:16.380
I'm allowed to speak for two minutes without an interruption,

622
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:17.250
<v 1>right?</v>

623
00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:18.450
<v 4>And you said the two minute rule,</v>

624
00:41:18.451 --> 00:41:20.790
you're allowed to speak for two minutes without an interruption.

625
00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:26.420
There were protocols like you repeat what the person is saying,

626
00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.970
you must repeat what the person is saying and the points they're

627
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:39.710
so that it demonstrates that you've taken in and understand what they're,

628
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:43.310
what they're saying.
And then you repeat it.

629
00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:49.070
We,
uh,
allow disagreement to take place in different formats.

630
00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:53.660
Um,
it might rather than being in person,

631
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:58.670
if somebody maybe is too emotional in the moment or maybe they're not good at

632
00:42:00.531 --> 00:42:02.730
thinking on their feet,
uh,

633
00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:06.650
we allow that disagreement to take place.
Um,

634
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:12.260
and a,
uh,
an a format that's essentially the equivalent of email exchanges.

635
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:15.860
In other words,
it written format.
Anyway,

636
00:42:15.861 --> 00:42:20.180
there were a bunch of those kinds of procedures.
Uh,
we have,
we agree,

637
00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:23.900
they mutually agree on who an arbiter is.
In other words,

638
00:42:23.901 --> 00:42:27.050
whenever there's a disagreement,
um,

639
00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:31.250
that just can't seem to get by as a standard practice.
Uh,

640
00:42:31.251 --> 00:42:33.570
the protocol is to say,
uh,

641
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:39.490
let's find the person we can agree who will be a moderator and help us through

642
00:42:40.161 --> 00:42:40.520
that.

643
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:44.930
And because they mutually agree on that person that then the rules of fair and

644
00:42:44.931 --> 00:42:46.130
it's an easy thing to do.

645
00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:51.710
So there are many of those tubs types of protocols that we use.
Um,

646
00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:53.720
it's also,
um,

647
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:58.710
culturally like a big full power,
a big thing to lose your cool.

648
00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:02.700
I mean,
in that way,
you know what I mean?
Culturally.
Okay.
You know,

649
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:07.350
maybe you need a,
uh,
you know,
a out.

650
00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.290
So all of those things enter into it.

651
00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:14.930
<v 1>No,
those are,
those are very helpful and actionable.
And I,</v>

652
00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:19.980
I'd like to look at the dynamics of making decisions as a,

653
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:24.100
as a solo operator or close to solo operator,

654
00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:26.890
just as a compliment or a contrast.

655
00:43:26.891 --> 00:43:31.891
So if we flash back to when you first began,

656
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:38.480
uh,
Bridgewater associates.
So out of your two bedroom apartment at 26 years old,

657
00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:44.860
do you recall any of your first big wins or things that you considered big wins

658
00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:47.683
at the time?

659
00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:52.840
And I'd love to just hear you describe what went into what made those big win.

660
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:55.940
In other words,
the thinking behind it.

661
00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:00.680
<v 4>You know,
the,
the funny thing is,
um,</v>

662
00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:03.920
I can hardly ever remember my big wins.

663
00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:06.890
I do remember my big losses.

664
00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:10.130
<v 1>We can talk,
we can talk about those too.
Yeah.</v>

665
00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:14.440
<v 4>It's so,
it's so funny because,
you know,</v>

666
00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:16.270
I look at it and I said,
well,
I,

667
00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:21.430
I guess I must have had a bunch of wins or successes because of,

668
00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:24.700
you know,
uh,
how things have went,
you know,

669
00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:29.560
the business is good and done well and all of that.

670
00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:32.550
But like I think of my history

671
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:37.550
<v 5>and I really think of those mistakes and I think that's so great because it</v>

672
00:44:40.111 --> 00:44:44.950
shows that that's a much better learning tool.
But,
uh,

673
00:44:44.951 --> 00:44:49.720
okay,
so my big wins.
You don't know I think about that.
Uh,
that time I think,

674
00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:54.520
no,
the things I remember where the,
where the fun things,
but a guy,
you know,

675
00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:58.390
guys I played rugby with and parties and,
um,

676
00:44:58.510 --> 00:44:59.770
and those kinds of things.

677
00:44:59.771 --> 00:45:03.730
I don't remember a particularly big winning well.

678
00:45:03.731 --> 00:45:07.960
I do remember some things,
you know,
I remember one time,
um,

679
00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:13.200
when we got the Kodak Account
Again,

680
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.550
I was,
uh,
in a position,
it's okay,

681
00:45:17.551 --> 00:45:21.870
here's a guy and he's analyzing the markets and then he has this small team of

682
00:45:21.871 --> 00:45:23.730
people that he's analyzing the markets.

683
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:29.250
And so I didn't have a long track record and I didn't have a institution.

684
00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:33.420
And,
uh,
you know,
sort of competing with the big institutions of the world,

685
00:45:33.421 --> 00:45:37.890
the JP Morgans and everybody.
And,
uh,
and by the way,

686
00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:41.020
we'd beat them well anyway,
um,

687
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:45.720
which shows that the individuals,
the powers within the individual.
But anyway,

688
00:45:45.721 --> 00:45:50.640
I remember when we got the Kodak Account,
um,
because at the time Kodak was,

689
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:51.371
uh,
you know,

690
00:45:51.371 --> 00:45:56.320
a big important client and them giving us that account,
uh,

691
00:45:56.490 --> 00:46:01.490
was a big deal for us because it was kind of a stamp of institutional,

692
00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:05.820
um,
approval.
And it was all I remember,
you know,

693
00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:10.800
the money mattered too because we would know that we were a bit more financially

694
00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:11.634
secure.

695
00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:16.940
So I remember that as a big win and I remember it so terrifically because we

696
00:46:17.581 --> 00:46:20.670
were asked to submit,
um,

697
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:26.150
research inflammation and we were just a small team of people and you know,

698
00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:29.630
we stayed up all night and with,
you know,

699
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:34.170
pizza and beer and all of that and um,

700
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:39.500
I remember it so sweetly because it was the dream of making our miracle happen

701
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:46.590
and we,
and the pulling together,
that's the meaningful relationships part.

702
00:46:46.591 --> 00:46:51.591
I believe that I want meaningful work and meaningful relationships.

703
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:54.930
And so that was what that was about.

704
00:46:54.931 --> 00:46:58.980
And we got the account and we won and that was,
yeah,
that was a big deal.

705
00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:02.310
Why did you guys win?
I think it's a combination of,

706
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.720
of being totally

707
00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:11.300
unconventional and having better processes and then there's a hell of a lot of

708
00:47:11.311 --> 00:47:12.240
determination.

709
00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:16.560
I think three things make up the successful life by and large.

710
00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:20.910
First you have to have audacious goals,
big dreams.

711
00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:26.260
Then when you are headed toward those goals,

712
00:47:27.310 --> 00:47:30.640
you're going to have problems going to deal with reality.

713
00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:35.590
You have to deal with those problems in that reality.

714
00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.610
Realistic League,
learning from mistakes,

715
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:43.990
writing down those principles and the likes.
So that's the second part.

716
00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:48.760
Dealing with reality in a practical way where you learn about mistakes.

717
00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:52.530
And then the third is determination.

718
00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:58.120
Because if you're going for your goals and you're encountering your mistakes and

719
00:47:58.121 --> 00:48:01.660
you're learning and you do that with determination,

720
00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:04.560
you're going to get better all the time.
You're going,

721
00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:09.070
you can't help but get better and you do that a long enough amount of time and

722
00:48:09.071 --> 00:48:11.410
you're going to far exceed your dreams.

723
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:16.090
Nice success as far succeeded,

724
00:48:16.091 --> 00:48:19.780
what I ever imagined in a one bit at a time.

725
00:48:19.781 --> 00:48:21.220
And it's just that process.

726
00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:27.540
<v 1>If you were to conversely look at intelligent people who are unhappy,</v>

727
00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:33.330
what do you think the primary causes of that unhappiness are?

728
00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:36.960
<v 5>I think it goes back to this notion of meaningful work and meaningful</v>

729
00:48:36.961 --> 00:48:38.010
relationships.
Uh,

730
00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:43.410
intelligence and happiness probably have no correlation with each other in

731
00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:45.154
studies,

732
00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:50.330
the repeatedly been shown and money is very little correlated with happiness.

733
00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:56.680
The highest correlation with happiness is community.

734
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:59.590
Am I part of a community?

735
00:48:59.591 --> 00:49:03.850
Do I feel connections with other people that's been,
you know,

736
00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:09.240
literally genetically programmed into us from it's estimated between 1,000,002

737
00:49:10.391 --> 00:49:13.420
million years ago before it was we were even mankind.

738
00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:19.220
So that sense of meaningful relationships I think is very,

739
00:49:20.251 --> 00:49:22.620
very important.
And if you have meaningful work,

740
00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:28.160
like you're on a mission and you have meaningful relationships and I think it's

741
00:49:28.851 --> 00:49:32.000
almost impossible not to be happy.
I mean,

742
00:49:32.001 --> 00:49:36.110
there'll be unhappy moments in your life that you encounter this thing or that,

743
00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:37.050
but,
uh,

744
00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:41.570
the people who are unhappy seem to be missing those things.

745
00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:42.731
<v 1>I think this,
you know,</v>

746
00:49:42.731 --> 00:49:47.731
this might be a good place to give listeners a little bit of background that

747
00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:50.800
they probably don't have,
which is a,

748
00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:55.650
a conversation you and I had that I really appreciated when I was very nervous

749
00:49:55.710 --> 00:50:00.710
at head not too long ago doing a rehearsal of my talk,

750
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:05.950
a which explored some of my experiences with manic depression and even a close

751
00:50:06.971 --> 00:50:10.650
call with [inaudible] near suicide in college.

752
00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.210
And you're very kind,

753
00:50:12.211 --> 00:50:17.211
you came up and spoke to me after I came offstage and I was,

754
00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:22.380
I was hoping perhaps you could talk about some of what you shared with me and,

755
00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:24.280
uh,
perhaps,
uh,

756
00:50:24.281 --> 00:50:28.100
your son's experience in what he's found helpful

757
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:33.160
<v 5>in mitigating some of these darker or harder moments that he's also had.</v>

758
00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:36.140
Sure.
I'd be happy to.

759
00:50:36.141 --> 00:50:41.141
I should stay say that when I described unhappiness and answer to your prior

760
00:50:41.151 --> 00:50:46.151
question before I was not dealing with what also was clinical depression,

761
00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:51.440
um,
which is also a different thing.
That's,
that's,
uh,

762
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:52.640
it is a,

763
00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:59.100
it is a chemical reaction I'm having to do with Serotonin,

764
00:50:59.241 --> 00:51:02.060
dopamine coming in,
sports and sputters and so on.

765
00:51:02.061 --> 00:51:06.890
There's a physiological element that,
um,
is driving it.
And it's,
uh,

766
00:51:06.891 --> 00:51:11.500
so that's,
that's a big thing.
So my son,
when he was,
uh,

767
00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:16.130
I think about 27 filmmaker,
very creative,
was,

768
00:51:16.210 --> 00:51:20.880
um,
in his new job in Los Angeles.
Um,

769
00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:24.050
very excited,
stayed up all night,

770
00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:28.730
smoke marijuana,
partied all night,
very energetic and,

771
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:33.560
and,
and basically,
um,
when crazy,
um,

772
00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:36.350
he,
uh,
at the hotel,

773
00:51:36.351 --> 00:51:41.351
he took the computer that was at the reception and smashed it.

774
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:46.790
He was,
he went into the,
uh,
the police came.

775
00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:50.660
Um,
he was rebellious.
They'd beat him up and so on and so forth.

776
00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:55.610
And we then began our journey,
um,

777
00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:57.080
through,
uh,

778
00:51:57.110 --> 00:52:02.110
three years of his bipolar episodes.

779
00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:06.800
And that was,
um,
you know,

780
00:52:06.801 --> 00:52:11.801
an incredibly difficult and eye opening and in retrospect,

781
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:17.330
wonderful experience.

782
00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:22.190
Some of the most painful experiences in retrospect give you the appreciations

783
00:52:22.191 --> 00:52:26.150
that you wouldn't otherwise have.
Um,
and that was,

784
00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:30.050
that was that experience.
And so,
ask your questions pertaining to it.

785
00:52:30.051 --> 00:52:34.280
I'd be happy to tell you.
He made the,
the quick answer to this by the way,

786
00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:35.480
is he did all the,

787
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:39.980
he did things right eventually that Julie did a lot of wrong things in between,

788
00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:45.220
but they came out of that three year period and then he became a successful film

789
00:52:47.151 --> 00:52:51.680
maker.
His movie,
the first movie made was called touch with fire,

790
00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:56.800
which was love story with Katie Holmes on bipolar and he has through that movie

791
00:52:58.551 --> 00:52:59.780
in his speeches and so on,

792
00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:05.770
we know saved a number of lives and also help to really destigmatize that

793
00:53:06.171 --> 00:53:10.970
because those with bipolar are often very creative people.

794
00:53:10.971 --> 00:53:15.740
I learned that,
you know,
a genius,

795
00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:20.840
creative genius is at the edge of insanity.
Anyway.

796
00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:25.800
Um,
what,
what questions do you have about that experience?
I'd love hear

797
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:27.200
<v 1>what I,</v>

798
00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:32.010
what your son has found to be helpful in terms of tools or resources,
approaches,

799
00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:36.010
routines,
anything that has,
that has,
that he has found too,

800
00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:37.773
uh,

801
00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:42.810
help them better navigate and manage everything that is part of his makeup.

802
00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:47.740
I suppose.
Much like it is part of my makeup.

803
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.990
<v 5>Sure.</v>

804
00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:53.630
There's these really for protocols and um,

805
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:59.250
I gave him a Saint Christopher medal and on the back I put the initials of those

806
00:53:59.251 --> 00:54:03.510
four protocols so that he would keep it close to him.

807
00:54:03.511 --> 00:54:07.530
And um,
so I know them well.
First of all,

808
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:11.200
the first one is w we have t,
t,
m,

809
00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:15.540
those are the initials and we and that represented take medicine.

810
00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:20.420
And by the way,
the amount of medicine that he's taken has,
uh,

811
00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:24.380
because of his improvements and so on has diminished,
uh,

812
00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:28.700
quite a lot but take medicine and it also represented TM,

813
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:30.980
transcendental meditation.

814
00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:35.390
So do the trend transcendental meditation and take the medicine,

815
00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:41.070
no drugs or substance abuse non be clean,

816
00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:46.890
go to bed,
never too late.
It's not a matter of just have eight hours sleep.

817
00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:47.753
It's,

818
00:54:47.890 --> 00:54:52.890
we have our rhythms and that basically go to bed by 11 and maybe once a week you

819
00:54:55.651 --> 00:55:00.340
could be up till one o'clock in the morning and then what we call monitoring.

820
00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:03.820
Now monitoring is much less important to him now,

821
00:55:03.821 --> 00:55:08.821
but at the time is being open about his bipolar and having people around them

822
00:55:10.091 --> 00:55:15.091
know and actually sort of monitoring his behavior so that they could raise a red

823
00:55:17.411 --> 00:55:18.760
flag,
um,

824
00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:23.530
and help them deal with that if he was going in one way or another.

825
00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:27.880
Uh,
that,
that those were the things that were very helpful in addition,

826
00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:31.150
have to be very careful about changing time zones.

827
00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:34.750
So if you're flying to Europe or far away,

828
00:55:34.751 --> 00:55:39.751
you have to do that in a way that you pace it so that it doesn't get triggered.

829
00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:44.650
And as I said,
he went through this,
you would never,
he's one now,

830
00:55:44.651 --> 00:55:46.720
one of the most centered people I know,

831
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:51.190
happily married given us two grand kids,

832
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:52.060
you know,

833
00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:56.940
it's just been a miracle and I really do believe it's that combination and,

834
00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:02.040
and he's learned and shown other people that that combination can work for

835
00:56:02.381 --> 00:56:03.160
anybody.

836
00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:08.160
<v 1>That's extremely helpful and I think valuable for a lot of people listening.</v>

837
00:56:08.921 --> 00:56:13.870
And I want to reiterate something that you mentioned because I only realized it

838
00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:18.700
in the last maybe two years and that is the going to bed earlier,

839
00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:20.170
I've always been very,

840
00:56:20.171 --> 00:56:25.171
very nocturnal and a a night owl and particularly say on book deadlines and so

841
00:56:26.061 --> 00:56:30.140
on going to bed at four or five,
six in the morning,
waking up very late.

842
00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.510
And that is,

843
00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:37.540
that has historically absolutely been correlated with a much,

844
00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:43.090
a much more severe and extended downtimes.
Uh,

845
00:56:43.091 --> 00:56:46.590
so I do just want to uh,

846
00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:50.600
reiterate what you said,
which is that going to bed by say 11 o'clock,
uh,

847
00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:53.810
it has for me at least been extremely helpful in,

848
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:57.140
in mitigating a lot of what we're talking about.

849
00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:58.533
<v 7>By the way,</v>

850
00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:03.720
it is so great that he is open and you are open and you can communicate it

851
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:09.660
because I found out,
uh,
do you know that um,

852
00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:15.120
24% of the population in one form or another has been diagnosed with some form

853
00:57:17.381 --> 00:57:22.060
of mental illness of some form of challenge that,
because you know,

854
00:57:22.061 --> 00:57:26.020
the brain is like a,
an Oregon,
it is an organ and it has those things.

855
00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:30.490
And some of the most creative people,
uh,

856
00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:33.460
you would know,
you know,
that,
um,

857
00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:38.850
Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill and Tchaikovsky and I'm on that,

858
00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:45.190
the list goes on and on of unbelievably great,

859
00:57:45.191 --> 00:57:47.760
brilliant creative people,
uh,

860
00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:52.830
simultaneously on the challenge by this and by making people aware,

861
00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:57.220
um,
and um,
in one dimension or another,

862
00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:02.280
either whether they're dealing with somebody who has such a challenge or to de

863
00:58:02.501 --> 00:58:05.110
stigmatize it and realize like,

864
00:58:05.111 --> 00:58:08.020
I look at you what a role model you are.

865
00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:11.650
And by being open about that particular challenge,

866
00:58:11.651 --> 00:58:16.651
people can really appreciate that we have a number of bipolar people who work

867
00:58:18.731 --> 00:58:22.560
here and we,
and when you know how to deal with it and there were,
you know,

868
00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:26.290
tremendous advantages to it too because it's a,

869
00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.950
it's a way of thinking.
I mean there was these mood ships,

870
00:58:30.310 --> 00:58:32.000
but there is also,
um,

871
00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:37.650
an unbelievably high percentage of those people are creative.

872
00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:40.760
So in certain professions and so on.
But anyway,

873
00:58:40.761 --> 00:58:45.260
I just want to compliment you or express my appreciation for you.

874
00:58:45.690 --> 00:58:49.910
I'm having this conversation and,
and being so open with it and it's,

875
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.190
I'm sure you would say as my son would,

876
00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:56.690
it's very helpful because when everybody around you understands it,

877
00:58:57.050 --> 00:58:58.430
it's helpful to you too.

878
00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:03.740
<v 1>It is helpful and I really appreciate the kind words ray and I should also</v>

879
00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:09.440
mention that for decades I kept this secret and close to the chest and I was

880
00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:15.460
very ashamed of,
uh,
just the,

881
00:59:15.461 --> 00:59:20.461
the nature of how my physiology worked ultimately and I so fearful about talking

882
00:59:22.731 --> 00:59:26.910
about a lot of this publicly in even the Ted talk was a,

883
00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:29.120
I had a very separate,

884
00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:32.990
very different tedtalk that I scrapped a few weeks beforehand because I felt

885
00:59:32.991 --> 00:59:36.260
morally obligated to talk about this more publicly.

886
00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:41.290
And in doing so felt quite the opposite of what I feared.

887
00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:46.380
It was actually an enormous burden and weight lifted off of my shoulders.

888
00:59:46.810 --> 00:59:51.370
And it's,
it's really been liberating to talk more freely about it.

889
00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:55.440
<v 7>I understand that completely because that's what,
that's what my son does.
I mean,</v>

890
00:59:55.441 --> 00:59:59.500
that's my son's reaction.
If you want to talk about it in a,
you know,

891
00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:04.240
in a more serious way.
I'm quite an expert on the whole thing,
the best doctors.

892
01:00:04.241 --> 01:00:05.160
And you know,
I,

893
01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:10.380
I really believed that I could probably be of some help if you feel that it's

894
01:00:11.051 --> 01:00:13.180
not entirely under control.

895
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:15.650
<v 1>Thank you.
No,
I,
I appreciate it.
And it,</v>

896
01:00:15.651 --> 01:00:18.750
it's a to segue a bit here,

897
01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:23.770
so absolutely appreciate the offer and that's,
that's something I'll remember.

898
01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:29.670
You seem like a very astute cultivator of talent and what I'd,

899
01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:35.130
I'd love to know is if there were any particular mentors of your own who uh,

900
01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:38.600
okay.

901
01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:43.430
You could describe or share with us that could be very early on,

902
01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:45.470
it could be in your investing career,
but any,

903
01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:47.660
any mentors who come to mind and what,

904
01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:51.720
what they taught you or helped to cultivate in you?

905
01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:56.100
<v 7>I remembered nice kind people,
not a mentor.
I,</v>

906
01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:00.130
I couldn't go to a mentor,
but I remember,
um,

907
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:01.690
somebody who a,

908
01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:05.410
when I was caddying and he was clerking on the floor of the New York Stock

909
01:01:05.411 --> 01:01:10.060
Exchange,
um,
a very successful Wall Street guy.

910
01:01:10.061 --> 01:01:15.061
And I used to caddy for him and we would talk about markets and he gave me,

911
01:01:16.450 --> 01:01:18.220
um,
not only advice,

912
01:01:18.221 --> 01:01:23.221
but there was the kindness and the caring and the direction that was helpful.

913
01:01:25.961 --> 01:01:28.540
I'd,
I don't know that he was an ongoing mentor,

914
01:01:28.541 --> 01:01:33.280
but he was a role model in many ways and did provide guidance.

915
01:01:33.281 --> 01:01:38.080
So maybe I think maybe he was,
but not an ongoing mentor.

916
01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:43.630
Um,
I remember teachers,
you know,
that,
uh,
you know,
serve that role.

917
01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:48.550
But not much.
Most of my learning has been from mistakes.

918
01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:51.550
I have a terrible rote memory,
by the way.

919
01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:57.370
I mean a terrible anything that doesn't have a reason for being what it is.

920
01:01:57.371 --> 01:02:02.040
I practically can't remember.
I can't remember phone numbers,
names,

921
01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:05.260
anything along those lines.
So I tend to learn.

922
01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:10.390
I'm not by being taught or going to my memory,

923
01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:15.010
I learn through my experiences and,
uh,

924
01:02:15.850 --> 01:02:18.760
and my kind of more subliminal learning.

925
01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:23.220
<v 1>Let's see.
It seems also that you're well read,
uh,
and I,</v>

926
01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:27.110
I'd love to actually just go back for a second to Einstein's mistakes when you

927
01:02:27.111 --> 01:02:30.600
pick up a book like that.
Two questions.
Number one,

928
01:02:30.970 --> 01:02:35.110
how did you choose that book or find it?
And number two is how do you read,

929
01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:37.960
what is your reading process?

930
01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:41.750
<v 7>The book was given to me because people know that I,</v>

931
01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:46.800
I liked that stuff.
And,
uh,
the way I read,
um,

932
01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:49.880
it depends on what I'm reading,

933
01:02:49.881 --> 01:02:54.881
but I will kind of skim and it depends on how much time and know and a lot of

934
01:02:56.401 --> 01:02:57.650
things.
But generally speaking on,

935
01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:02.960
I'll try to go through a book pretty quickly by being able to sort out what the

936
01:03:03.451 --> 01:03:05.800
main ideas are from the degression.

937
01:03:05.801 --> 01:03:08.490
So is this kind of a little bit of a strategy,
you know,

938
01:03:08.491 --> 01:03:12.180
how like they'll tell you the story and the story and the story might go on for

939
01:03:12.210 --> 01:03:16.640
awhile and then it then gets to the point they're trying to make.
So I'm my,

940
01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:20.190
when I'm going through the stories on Michael Quicker,
um,

941
01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:23.580
I might be scanning for the,
you know,

942
01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:26.730
top of the paragraph to get an idea of what they're doing,

943
01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:30.930
doing and then go into the section that I'm,

944
01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:32.370
I'm most interested.
I mean,

945
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:37.430
I would say I would be typically a reading that way unless it is something in

946
01:03:37.891 --> 01:03:40.230
which,
you know,
there's uh,

947
01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:44.780
not that sort of a book that there's either something where on enjoying the,

948
01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.620
the flavor of the wording and the,
you know,

949
01:03:48.621 --> 01:03:52.820
the sentence structure and the beauty or the,
the,

950
01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:56.730
the thoughtfulness and that I really want to take that in and I don't want to

951
01:03:56.731 --> 01:03:58.100
scan,
it'll vary.

952
01:03:58.101 --> 01:04:03.101
I like to get the most out of each book as quickly as I can because the number

953
01:04:03.801 --> 01:04:07.630
that I'm trying to go through,
um,
you know,

954
01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:09.620
is comparatively large.

955
01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:14.250
So I've got a pile of books or you're sitting in front of me and you know,

956
01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:18.290
they torment me because they tapped.
I'm very curious.

957
01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:20.720
I would say curiosity

958
01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:25.730
is a big motivator from mine.
So you know,

959
01:04:25.731 --> 01:04:30.470
the world has got much too much to offer relative to my capacity to digest it.

960
01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:36.240
<v 1>What are the books that you currently have in front of you or that are sitting,</v>

961
01:04:36.641 --> 01:04:39.830
sitting there like undone homework assignments?
What do you,
what did,

962
01:04:39.850 --> 01:04:43.270
what do you currently have on the,
on the roster or potential roster?

963
01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:48.020
<v 7>I have sapiens,
I have the Greek hero,</v>

964
01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:51.500
Michael Lewis is the undoing project,

965
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:56.860
the upside of inequality,
the Serengeti rules,
uh,

966
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:59.690
from bacteria to Bach and back,

967
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:04.170
which is about the evolution of the mind,
a magic web,

968
01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:07.930
a whole pile over there.

969
01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:09.110
<v 1>This is fantastic.</v>

970
01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:13.410
<v 7>I do mostly original research.
So in,</v>

971
01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:18.370
in addition to,
I mean,
looking through books and,
and through it,
um,

972
01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:23.800
like I really liked to get into,
you know,
the data.

973
01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:26.050
I mean I'm,
I'm a researcher basically.

974
01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:31.010
<v 1>Is there anything that you're researching right now or that you've researched</v>

975
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:31.963
recently?

976
01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:36.660
<v 7>The bottom 60% of the population and what the world and life and the economy is</v>

977
01:05:36.661 --> 01:05:38.880
like for them because they're,

978
01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:43.200
there are two different economies in the world.
The average is a very,

979
01:05:43.201 --> 01:05:48.180
very misleading.
The top two tenths of 1% of the population as a net worth,

980
01:05:48.181 --> 01:05:52.740
which is about equal to the bottom,
90% combined.

981
01:05:52.741 --> 01:05:55.840
And um,
so,
um,
uh,
um,
um,

982
01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:59.400
researching more about what that's like and it's,

983
01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:04.520
it's quite a,
it's quite a bleak,
difficult picture.

984
01:06:04.521 --> 01:06:07.140
So that's the thing I'm researching right now.

985
01:06:07.310 --> 01:06:11.330
<v 1>What drove you to,
to research that?
Is it just to understand the,</v>

986
01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:16.340
the implications and secondary and tertiary implications of that?

987
01:06:16.341 --> 01:06:17.990
Or is,
was there something driving that?

988
01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:19.340
<v 7>I think,</v>

989
01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:24.260
I think right now we're in the midst of an era that's very much like the 30s

990
01:06:24.290 --> 01:06:26.960
that is,
um,
uh,

991
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:32.230
in which this wealth and opportunity gap and the populism that is being,

992
01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:37.700
um,
that's coming from it.

993
01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:42.530
And the divisions which are great,

994
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:47.510
I mean large,
um,
is a,
um,

995
01:06:47.610 --> 01:06:52.060
is a defining moment of our time and this exists around the world.

996
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:54.740
If economies where to go down now,

997
01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:59.690
I do believe that there would be a great deal of conflict and I think that we're

998
01:06:59.691 --> 01:07:04.070
seeing the conflict play out politically.
Uh,

999
01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:06.590
uh,
not only in the United States,

1000
01:07:06.591 --> 01:07:10.760
but you're seeing it in different places or interactions.
I think it's the,
um,

1001
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:15.410
it's the defining issue of maybe that's overreaching,

1002
01:07:15.411 --> 01:07:19.040
but it is certainly one of the most important issues of our time.

1003
01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:22.910
And I mean this year,
next year,
the year following,

1004
01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.850
because that's the basis at which,
um,

1005
01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:31.030
are we going to have conflict or where one side is fighting the other side.

1006
01:07:33.291 --> 01:07:36.740
This is a matter of principles we're talking about principles again are the

1007
01:07:36.741 --> 01:07:41.741
principles that hold us together as Americans greater than those that divide us.

1008
01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:49.160
How are we going to,
how we want to be with each other.

1009
01:07:49.161 --> 01:07:53.570
So this is this,
this understanding and,
and,

1010
01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:58.290
uh,
all of these perspectives I think is,
is,
is,

1011
01:07:58.410 --> 01:08:00.050
is very important at the time.

1012
01:08:00.370 --> 01:08:04.900
<v 1>So I've been definitely going to come back to a related thread on that.</v>

1013
01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:06.640
But before I get there,

1014
01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:11.880
I wanted to ask you of of the books that you mentioned that you were not gifted,

1015
01:08:13.210 --> 01:08:17.830
how did you,
or why did you choose any of them?
Like the Greek hero,

1016
01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:21.940
the undoing project sapiens from bacteria to Bach and back,

1017
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:25.220
any of those,
why did you choose them?

1018
01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:28.240
<v 7>I would suppose that the,
each one has to,
is,</v>

1019
01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:30.880
is different because of the themes of interest.

1020
01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:35.650
I'm fascinated by evolution.

1021
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.880
I think evolution is the greatest force in the universe and everything.

1022
01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:40.860
And the purpose of everything is to evolve.

1023
01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:45.840
We as individuals are just vessels for our DNA is evolving.
So I'm,
uh,
I'm,

1024
01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:50.700
I'm fascinated in evolution.
I'm fascinated in how the brain works.

1025
01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:56.770
The Greek heroes,
very,
very,
very interested in,
in terms of,
um,
uh,

1026
01:08:57.260 --> 01:08:59.660
one of the greatest books,
uh,

1027
01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:04.460
is Joseph Campbell's hero over a thousand faces,
which,

1028
01:09:04.461 --> 01:09:08.150
um,
takes the character of,
you know,

1029
01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:12.360
going through life and what are the attributes that different people have.

1030
01:09:12.361 --> 01:09:15.440
So difference in values.
Um,

1031
01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:18.990
so there it's an eclectic group of interests.

1032
01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:23.930
I'm interested in nature a lot.
Um,
so I tend to,

1033
01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:27.020
I'm also particularly interested in the ocean,

1034
01:09:27.021 --> 01:09:31.230
so I will read about nature and the ocean.
Uh,

1035
01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:35.480
and these are just curiosities,
but then they become themes.

1036
01:09:35.481 --> 01:09:38.090
I guess I'm not interested in cooking.

1037
01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:42.080
I'm not interested in like a whole bunch of things,
but so they are,

1038
01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:43.790
they do come in these categories.

1039
01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:47.970
<v 1>Are there any particular books that you could mention?
And don't worry,</v>

1040
01:09:47.971 --> 01:09:50.040
I won't Belabor the book stuff forever,
but,
uh,

1041
01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:53.340
any books you mentioned Joseph Campbell,
uh,

1042
01:09:53.370 --> 01:09:58.370
that have had a strong impact on your life or your thinking and maybe a way to

1043
01:10:00.551 --> 01:10:05.250
frame that would be if you were a,
and certainly,

1044
01:10:05.970 --> 01:10:06.320
uh,

1045
01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:11.270
one of the books in answer to the question that I'm about to pose could be your

1046
01:10:11.271 --> 01:10:13.790
own certainly.
Um,
but if you were to give,

1047
01:10:13.791 --> 01:10:17.900
say every graduating senior in college or high school,

1048
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:22.240
a handful of books,
what might you give them?

1049
01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:26.770
<v 7>Ah,
the books I'd give them would be lessons from history.</v>

1050
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:30.370
This is the Durant's.
They were the,
um,
the great,

1051
01:10:30.371 --> 01:10:33.540
maybe the greatest historians of all time.
Anyway,

1052
01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:36.640
we're over 5,000 years of history,

1053
01:10:36.641 --> 01:10:41.200
probably road 5,000 pages on it.
And they took this book,

1054
01:10:41.201 --> 01:10:43.150
I think it's 104 pages,

1055
01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:46.450
and they took the themes of history.

1056
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:51.380
It could be from religion,
natural resources,
who knows,
uh,

1057
01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:52.510
each one of these things.

1058
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:55.990
And they looked at it for themes of history through history.

1059
01:10:55.991 --> 01:10:57.370
I think that that would be great.

1060
01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:01.570
A river from Eden by Dawkins,

1061
01:11:02.290 --> 01:11:07.290
Richard Dawkins on another very short book on evolution.

1062
01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:13.530
It just really puts things in perspective.
Um,
again,

1063
01:11:13.531 --> 01:11:17.460
I would say Joseph Campbell's hero's a thousand faces.

1064
01:11:18.350 --> 01:11:18.690
Uh,

1065
01:11:18.690 --> 01:11:23.690
those would be the three books that I would say that would be the combination.

1066
01:11:24.361 --> 01:11:26.300
And the beauty of,
you know,

1067
01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:30.330
particularly two of those books is it's not going to take loan to,
to read them.

1068
01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:34.690
Hero of a thousand faces a little bit dense,
but it's so rich.

1069
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:39.100
So it's,
uh,
it's,
it's,
it's a good one.

1070
01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.850
<v 1>Why is it those are,</v>

1071
01:11:42.210 --> 01:11:47.210
I need to get on a combine this as soon as we get off the,

1072
01:11:47.451 --> 01:11:51.040
uh,
the phone,
but I,
why is it,

1073
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:53.100
and maybe this isn't true across the board,

1074
01:11:53.101 --> 01:11:58.101
but whether it's in early stage startups or in the realm of,

1075
01:12:00.171 --> 01:12:01.670
say,
broadly speaking,

1076
01:12:01.671 --> 01:12:05.260
hedge funds or eight structures or asset management,

1077
01:12:05.261 --> 01:12:10.261
the best investors that I've met almost all have a fascination with evolution.

1078
01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.153
Why is that?

1079
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:13.940
<v 7>Don't have a clue.</v>

1080
01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:18.990
<v 1>Okay.
All right.</v>

1081
01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:23.900
Then we don't have to,
we don't have to dwell on it.
Uh,
for whatever reason.
Yeah.

1082
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:27.570
It seems to be a pattern.
Uh,
there their few maxims I'd like to ask you about.

1083
01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:31.150
And uh,
if these are misquotes please correct me.

1084
01:12:32.410 --> 01:12:36.700
The first is ask yourself whether you have earned the right to have an opinion.

1085
01:12:38.050 --> 01:12:39.130
Can you elaborate on that?

1086
01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:41.650
<v 7>I mean,
yeah.
I mean</v>

1087
01:12:43.930 --> 01:12:45.910
all you want is the right answer,
right?

1088
01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:51.390
And there's such a bias to think that just because you have an opinion that it's

1089
01:12:51.731 --> 01:12:56.590
valuable or the 30s,
so stuck with it.
I mean,
that's really stupid,

1090
01:12:58.150 --> 01:13:00.640
right?
I mean,
it's like in everything.

1091
01:13:00.670 --> 01:13:03.820
You just want the right opinion wherever it's going to come from.

1092
01:13:04.930 --> 01:13:06.460
So if you gain humility,

1093
01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:12.240
I believe that one of the greatest tragedies of mankind,

1094
01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:18.960
individuals is to hold wrong opinions in their head that so easily could be

1095
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:27.280
stress tested to find out if they're right or wrong.
If you,

1096
01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:31.030
if you can sort of give that up and think,

1097
01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:32.920
how do I know I'm right,

1098
01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:37.150
you're going to significantly raise the best,

1099
01:13:37.570 --> 01:13:41.880
raise your probabilities and making better decisions.
I mean,
that's the,

1100
01:13:41.890 --> 01:13:42.760
that's the big thing.

1101
01:13:42.761 --> 01:13:45.760
They're only two things you need to do in life in order to be successful.

1102
01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:50.890
You first,
you need to know what the best decisions are.
And second,

1103
01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:55.330
you have to have the courage to make them to do what's necessary.

1104
01:13:56.110 --> 01:13:57.340
And on the first,

1105
01:13:58.030 --> 01:14:03.030
the greatest problem is that people just look inside their heads with,

1106
01:14:05.621 --> 01:14:10.621
for their opinions where they can really get rid of the bad ones,

1107
01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:15.400
take the best that they can get elsewhere.
And by doing that,

1108
01:14:15.401 --> 01:14:19.300
by exploring different people's views,

1109
01:14:19.450 --> 01:14:22.870
not just their conclusions,
but the reasoning behind their conclusions,

1110
01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:27.430
they can learn such a tremendous amount.
We talk about books.
Well,

1111
01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:30.190
the conversations are much better than books.

1112
01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:34.990
So you can have those conversations and learn when people have differences and

1113
01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:38.260
just pick the best opinions.
Right.
Isn't that sensible?

1114
01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:42.300
<v 1>Yeah,
no,
it's definitely sensible.
How do you,
uh,</v>

1115
01:14:42.301 --> 01:14:47.301
what are some good questions that someone can ask to explore someone's reasoning

1116
01:14:48.371 --> 01:14:51.770
behind their conclusions?
Except I think that I'm doing,

1117
01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:55.510
it's so easy for people to become charged.
Uh,

1118
01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:00.040
are there any good questions for those people who,
uh,

1119
01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:04.870
the vast majority are not going to operate within Saint Bridgewater associates?

1120
01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:05.680
Uh,
what are,

1121
01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:10.680
what are some good ways to explorer normally investigate someone else's

1122
01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.080
reasoning behind their conclusions?

1123
01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:15.941
<v 7>Well,</v>

1124
01:15:15.941 --> 01:15:20.941
I think the real driver of it is when there's a difference of opinions to,

1125
01:15:23.050 --> 01:15:26.530
do you have a real curiosity to understand why.

1126
01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:28.050
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1127
01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:32.370
<v 7>I mean it's,
it's really through the,
um,
you know,</v>

1128
01:15:33.450 --> 01:15:33.850
<v 6>okay.</v>

1129
01:15:33.850 --> 01:15:35.410
<v 7>The fear of being wrong,</v>

1130
01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:41.860
combined with the curiosity of wondering why somebody would have another opinion

1131
01:15:42.141 --> 01:15:45.590
and,
and that becomes the motivator.
And so,
you know,

1132
01:15:45.591 --> 01:15:50.060
you kind of ask why and you think,

1133
01:15:50.061 --> 01:15:54.470
does that make sense?
And then come back with other questions.
Uh,

1134
01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:59.000
so it's,
I would say,
I think most people,

1135
01:16:01.210 --> 01:16:04.240
um,
are,
you know,

1136
01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:08.200
too often they start with opinion.

1137
01:16:08.201 --> 01:16:13.201
There's psychological tests that show that people start with an opinion and

1138
01:16:13.751 --> 01:16:18.010
filter information that comes to them to be consistent with their opinion.

1139
01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:19.233
Right?

1140
01:16:19.290 --> 01:16:23.080
<v 1>Yeah.
Well then you're not living in reality.</v>

1141
01:16:23.081 --> 01:16:26.280
You're living in a sort of illusion of confirmation bias.
Right?

1142
01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:30.310
<v 7>Right.
And it's,
it's so,
besides being so damaging,</v>

1143
01:16:30.311 --> 01:16:32.530
it's so much less enriching.

1144
01:16:32.650 --> 01:16:37.340
<v 1>So this I think is a related in a sense to,
uh,</v>

1145
01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:41.690
maybe another maxim that,
uh,
I'd love for you to elaborate on,

1146
01:16:41.691 --> 01:16:44.890
which is don't pick your battles,
fight them all.
What does that mean?

1147
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:47.030
<v 7>That's one of the most misunderstood.</v>

1148
01:16:47.031 --> 01:16:50.990
So I'm glad you asked him about it because it's clear that many things are

1149
01:16:50.991 --> 01:16:52.100
symptomatic.

1150
01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:56.870
A little things are symptomatic of a bigger things.

1151
01:16:57.530 --> 01:17:01.960
So under that principle it explains like,
um,

1152
01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:06.200
if somebody is behaving in a certain way and you think,
well,

1153
01:17:06.201 --> 01:17:08.930
that's not a big thing,
but you don't

1154
01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:12.860
why somebody would do that,

1155
01:17:12.861 --> 01:17:16.220
it may be symptomatic of a bigger thing.

1156
01:17:16.221 --> 01:17:19.970
So when you start to almost,
I might say,
pull every thread,

1157
01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.070
as you start to pull the threads,

1158
01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:27.140
you start to see the connections because you're chilling to get at what's

1159
01:17:27.141 --> 01:17:31.410
everything symptomatic of.
So that's what you're really trying to get a,

1160
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:34.490
is it,
is that,
what is the person,
like,

1161
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:39.290
what does that situation like?
Why would it manifest itself that way?

1162
01:17:39.650 --> 01:17:43.670
So,
um,
uh,
it's a,
it's a,

1163
01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:46.910
it's a probably a principal that I,
you know,

1164
01:17:46.911 --> 01:17:49.850
throws people off and I probably have an articulated very well.

1165
01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:54.970
What are some of the biggest challenges that you've had within Bridgewater at,

1166
01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:01.490
at different phases of its development?
I mean,
are there,
are there any,

1167
01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:06.080
were there any particular sort of forks in the road that are memorable to you,

1168
01:18:06.170 --> 01:18:08.970
where you had to improve or fix something?
I,

1169
01:18:09.150 --> 01:18:14.090
I'd like to start with the overarching challenge that is a constant challenge

1170
01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:18.530
and then we can go back to some of the actual,
you know,

1171
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:19.670
various forks in the road.

1172
01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:25.240
The overarching challenge is people's two thems.

1173
01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:31.160
In other words,
think about it in this,
this way,
there are two use inside you.

1174
01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:37.720
There is the thoughtful you prefrontal cortex type of,

1175
01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:40.370
you know,
thoughtful you.

1176
01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:45.880
And then there's the subliminal emotional you and you're not aware actually of

1177
01:18:48.531 --> 01:18:52.420
the subliminal emotional you.
That's why it was Freud's great this,

1178
01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:56.450
the governor in that there's the subliminal that's really controlling you but

1179
01:18:56.451 --> 01:18:58.190
you're not in your consciousness.

1180
01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:02.750
And there were those to use and they're often at odds.
The example,

1181
01:19:02.751 --> 01:19:06.980
the classic example would be of course something where you did something that

1182
01:19:06.981 --> 01:19:09.470
you didn't want to do.
He ate the cake that you didn't want to eat,

1183
01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:12.830
but in any way where you punched somebody or something.

1184
01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:18.050
And so there are these two use that are in a battle for each other.

1185
01:19:18.051 --> 01:19:23.051
And so what we've observed on a constant basis is that in addition to having,

1186
01:19:26.190 --> 01:19:28.460
uh,
disagreements between people,

1187
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.730
we see that that emotional,

1188
01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:37.600
subliminal them often can be in control of their more thoughtful them.

1189
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:44.120
And that those are ongoing battles.

1190
01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:48.050
And that's basically the battle.

1191
01:19:48.051 --> 01:19:51.330
That's the battle that almost everybody all the time is doing well.

1192
01:19:51.340 --> 01:19:53.960
So imagine how confusing it is.
You know,

1193
01:19:53.961 --> 01:19:58.961
you have to use within you that are battling with each other and then somebody

1194
01:20:00.381 --> 01:20:05.130
else you're dealing with as to within them.
And so it can get,
uh,

1195
01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:07.010
you know,
you get kids difficult,

1196
01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:11.790
<v 1>you know,
every,
every,
yeah,
every conversation has at least four people in.
Yeah.</v>

1197
01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:17.770
<v 7>So that's it.
And if you can,</v>

1198
01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:21.670
if you could know how to deal with that,
that's a constant struggle.

1199
01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:26.070
So the thing that we find is that a very,
very,

1200
01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:31.071
very few people have a problem intellectually liking what's going on here.

1201
01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:37.330
Um,
it's fair.
It's honest.
There's no politics.

1202
01:20:37.331 --> 01:20:40.590
It's anybody can,
um,

1203
01:20:40.690 --> 01:20:45.480
in an idea meritocratic way.
You can argue their case.
There isn't,

1204
01:20:45.630 --> 01:20:49.000
it's not hierarchical.
It's fantastic.
And all of those ways,

1205
01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:53.650
the challenges that they have or then with their emotional,

1206
01:20:53.651 --> 01:20:56.290
you reconciling with their intellectual you.

1207
01:20:56.291 --> 01:21:00.900
And that's an ongoing challenge.
Um,
uh,

1208
01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:05.050
you know,
that's uh,
all the,
all the time.
So that's a,

1209
01:21:05.051 --> 01:21:09.460
that's a theme I would say is a constant thing.
Okay,
well then,
you know,

1210
01:21:09.461 --> 01:21:14.200
twists and turns at every phase in life you have,
you have different,

1211
01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:18.310
uh,
uh,
uh,
challenges.
I mean,
you know,

1212
01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:22.900
not having any money,
any resources,

1213
01:21:23.410 --> 01:21:27.880
and then having to do things from,
from myself.
You know,
you're an entrepreneur,

1214
01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:31.750
no,
no money,
no resources.
And then having to do,

1215
01:21:31.751 --> 01:21:34.480
sit by the computer,
rent the place,

1216
01:21:34.930 --> 01:21:39.410
do all of that was a one kind of challenge.
And you know,

1217
01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:43.810
then you have the small team and you have those dreams and you work with them

1218
01:21:43.811 --> 01:21:44.770
and it's fantastic.

1219
01:21:44.771 --> 01:21:48.610
But you didn't have enough resources and then you grow and you have the exact

1220
01:21:48.611 --> 01:21:52.900
opposite things happening to you and they produce their own challenges.

1221
01:21:52.901 --> 01:21:53.950
And you know,

1222
01:21:53.951 --> 01:21:58.951
you have too many people and you don't get to know each other as well as you did

1223
01:21:59.201 --> 01:22:01.960
before,
but you have plenty of resources.

1224
01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:06.100
But you might have the,
um,
you know,

1225
01:22:06.101 --> 01:22:10.900
the challenge of how do you maintain that quality relationship with that larger

1226
01:22:10.901 --> 01:22:14.920
group of people.
Then one has to figure out how you main connect.

1227
01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:19.390
We have 1500 people that work at Bridgewater.
Um,
how does that connectivity,

1228
01:22:19.391 --> 01:22:22.810
that same kind of excitement,

1229
01:22:22.811 --> 01:22:27.811
admission and togetherness that happened when we had five or 50,

1230
01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:34.150
how is,
how is that maintained?
And that's a new strategy.
So you always,

1231
01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:39.360
one always has these different problems and the various inflection points that

1232
01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:45.750
lead one of the forks in the road that are the points that you're referring to.

1233
01:22:46.410 --> 01:22:51.190
Um,
and they're the junctures your referring to,
you're referring to.
So,

1234
01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:54.550
I mean,
they're just so,
so many of them.

1235
01:22:55.120 --> 01:23:00.120
<v 1>But I'd love to maybe dig into is a word that gets,</v>

1236
01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:02.140
gets used a lot.

1237
01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:07.260
And I'd love to hear how you define and think about risk,

1238
01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:15.040
uh,
specifically.
And I have a quote here,

1239
01:23:16.090 --> 01:23:18.970
uh,
that,
that maybe we could use as a jumping off point.

1240
01:23:19.210 --> 01:23:20.770
And I'm not sure exactly where it's from,

1241
01:23:20.771 --> 01:23:24.280
but risky things are not in themselves risky if you understand them and control

1242
01:23:24.281 --> 01:23:27.130
them.
If you do it randomly and you're sloppy about it,
it can be very risky.

1243
01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:31.300
And then it goes on their words,
not yours.
The key to success,

1244
01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:32.770
their words is quote,

1245
01:23:33.010 --> 01:23:37.150
a figuring out where is the edge and how do I stay the right distance from the

1246
01:23:37.151 --> 01:23:39.790
edge.
How do you think about risk?

1247
01:23:39.791 --> 01:23:44.030
Because that's a word that a lot of people throw around.
A,
I have a feeling that,

1248
01:23:44.190 --> 01:23:49.090
that you think about it maybe in more specific terms or more clearly than a lot

1249
01:23:49.091 --> 01:23:52.830
of folks had.
How do you think about or define risk?

1250
01:23:53.370 --> 01:23:55.710
<v 7>Well,
I think the most important thing is there's,</v>

1251
01:23:56.190 --> 01:23:59.370
there's the risk of the ruined risk of being knocked out of the game,

1252
01:23:59.371 --> 01:24:03.930
risk of the unacceptable.
And then there's a risk of,

1253
01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:08.880
um,
the painful mistake and they're a world of difference.
Um,

1254
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:13.510
like I have to know how not to die,

1255
01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:18.250
how not,
how to get knocked out of the game.
That's an important risk.

1256
01:24:18.610 --> 01:24:23.610
So thinking about all the different ways that that can happen and making sure

1257
01:24:23.981 --> 01:24:28.360
all of those ways are covered is,
is number one.

1258
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:33.750
And then there's the other kind of risk which is take it,

1259
01:24:34.181 --> 01:24:36.920
have the experiences.
Um,

1260
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I guess maybe the example would be if I was saying skiing comes to mind know,

1261
01:24:42.370 --> 01:24:44.270
you know,
don't kill yourself,

1262
01:24:44.271 --> 01:24:47.900
but if you're not falling a lot and hurting yourself a lot,

1263
01:24:47.901 --> 01:24:52.800
you're probably not learning.
So to distinguish between,
um,

1264
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:55.150
when you say risk averse,
uh,

1265
01:24:55.190 --> 01:25:00.190
be very risk prone in terms of being able to have the experiences that are the

1266
01:25:02.511 --> 01:25:07.220
learning risky experiences that even produce some of the pains that allow the

1267
01:25:07.221 --> 01:25:11.630
learning but you know,
don't get knocked out of the game.

1268
01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:15.680
And then I think of risk as,
you know,
how do you do that?

1269
01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:18.320
How do I improve my return to risk ratio?

1270
01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:23.120
And I know that the most important way that you can do that,

1271
01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:27.760
there's a few ways,
but one of the most important ways is,
uh,

1272
01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:33.460
knowing how to diversify one's bets without reducing one's returns.

1273
01:25:34.071 --> 01:25:38.930
There are a bunch of things that are equally good and you know how to,

1274
01:25:39.020 --> 01:25:43.280
um,
take all those equally good things but they're not correlated,

1275
01:25:43.670 --> 01:25:47.690
would mean that I could do a much better job.
Just to give you an idea,

1276
01:25:48.450 --> 01:25:53.280
think,
think of something as being correlated.
Like something like some,
uh,

1277
01:25:53.281 --> 01:25:57.060
bet something.
There's a way we think of that as correlation,

1278
01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:00.840
but you can almost think of it as,
you know,
a different kind of bed.

1279
01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:06.580
If it is 60% correlated and,

1280
01:26:07.130 --> 01:26:12.130
and you start with a particular level of risk and you add in the second and

1281
01:26:17.721 --> 01:26:22.721
third and fourth and fifth and a thousand different items to diverse,

1282
01:26:23.901 --> 01:26:24.830
you're by yourself.

1283
01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:30.340
You will only reduce your risk by about 15%,

1284
01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:33.860
maybe a little bit more than 15%.
If they're correlated.

1285
01:26:35.210 --> 01:26:40.210
If you do that with uncorrelated things,

1286
01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:45.290
uncorrelated bets,
um,

1287
01:26:47.150 --> 01:26:50.300
you at 15 on correlated batch,

1288
01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:56.050
you will reduce your risk by over 80% so now the holy grail of investing,

1289
01:27:00.741 --> 01:27:04.340
the thing that I learned,
and that's the most important,

1290
01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:08.650
is that if I can have 10 or 15,

1291
01:27:08.651 --> 01:27:13.651
ideally 15 but even if it's five good uncorrelated bets,

1292
01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:16.040
<v 3>okay,</v>

1293
01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:17.390
<v 7>that's,
that's the holy grail.</v>

1294
01:27:17.391 --> 01:27:22.391
So the holy grail is 15 good uncorrelated bets because it will,

1295
01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:28.250
if they're all equally good and expected return,
in other words,

1296
01:27:28.251 --> 01:27:31.760
let's say they were all going to have an expected return of 10% by way of

1297
01:27:31.761 --> 01:27:34.780
example,
then on average you would do,

1298
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:39.910
you won't lower your expected return because they're all on average about 10%

1299
01:27:40.530 --> 01:27:45.340
but in terms of the risk,
you will eliminate 80% of the risk.

1300
01:27:45.341 --> 01:27:50.341
So you improve your return to risk ratio by a factor of five.

1301
01:27:52.290 --> 01:27:57.290
So what I'm saying is that knowing the value of uncorrelated bets,

1302
01:28:01.210 --> 01:28:05.760
um,
is incredibly important.
So when you're thinking about it as a business,

1303
01:28:05.761 --> 01:28:08.360
I think about it as a mason,

1304
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:11.520
basically a betting strategy and every one of the bets that I make,

1305
01:28:11.850 --> 01:28:14.310
but if you're thinking about,
let's say your business is,

1306
01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:19.790
if you can create a good but uncorrelated things,

1307
01:28:20.101 --> 01:28:25.101
that power of diversification is so much more valuable than trying to make any

1308
01:28:27.451 --> 01:28:29.100
one bet much greater.

1309
01:28:29.970 --> 01:28:34.910
So I think about diversification and I also think that in terms of,

1310
01:28:35.250 --> 01:28:39.050
uh,
let's say batch or raising my probability of being right,

1311
01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:43.850
one of the most important ways of raising my probability of being right is not

1312
01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:47.090
being confident that I'm writing and being able to go out there and,

1313
01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:48.920
and gather the triangulation.

1314
01:28:48.921 --> 01:28:53.921
So something for me is it technique is a quality,

1315
01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:57.760
uh,
triangulation.
Basically,
you know,

1316
01:28:57.890 --> 01:29:02.730
if I can find three people don't know,
let's say it's a medical condition,

1317
01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:07.760
but it could be any decision if I could find three people who are excellent

1318
01:29:09.330 --> 01:29:14.330
experts who will disagree with each other because they're committed to the right

1319
01:29:15.601 --> 01:29:20.601
answer and I can get triangulation and also listen to their disagreements.

1320
01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:29.250
Um,
I'm significantly raising my probabilities of,
uh,
of being right.

1321
01:29:29.251 --> 01:29:32.730
So there,
you know,
techniques like that,
uh,
uh,

1322
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:36.440
humility and triangulation of,

1323
01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:39.060
of great people,
um,

1324
01:29:39.090 --> 01:29:43.680
is an excellent way of raising one's probability of making a good decision.

1325
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:45.343
I'd lifted

1326
01:29:46.050 --> 01:29:49.980
<v 1>to unpeel the layers a little bit on uncorrelated bets.</v>

1327
01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:54.650
So what I'm wondering is it's,
I think about this just say in my own life,
uh,

1328
01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:58.770
with various types of investing and I'm by no means,

1329
01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:03.780
uh,
anyone with a track record like yours.
But,
uh,
uh,

1330
01:30:03.970 --> 01:30:06.550
how the,
the question that comes to mind for me is,

1331
01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:10.250
or observation rather,

1332
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:13.190
and I'd love for you to smash it to pieces if it's not accurate,
but that

1333
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:19.310
with a limited Dataset,
you can,
if you're able to crunch some numbers,

1334
01:30:19.311 --> 01:30:22.700
identify,
say things that go up at the same time or down at the same time.

1335
01:30:22.701 --> 01:30:26.960
So the correlation or that are inversely correlated.
So when [inaudible] goes up,

1336
01:30:26.961 --> 01:30:28.520
B tends to go down.

1337
01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:33.580
At what point do you consider yourself confident something is uncorrelated

1338
01:30:33.581 --> 01:30:38.581
because it seems like you'd need a much larger dataset to conclude confidently

1339
01:30:38.871 --> 01:30:40.100
that something is uncorrelated?

1340
01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:45.170
<v 7>Well,
the,
I think there are two ways of determining the correlation,
uh,
uh,</v>

1341
01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:48.900
that they're uncorrelated and that is,
are they in

1342
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:53.730
you referred to the first,
but I think it's the worst,

1343
01:30:54.570 --> 01:30:58.680
but still has value,
which is how did they move together in the past?

1344
01:30:59.550 --> 01:31:04.550
I think the more important is to understand like,

1345
01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:07.830
are they intrinsically different things?
So

1346
01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:13.800
if you were going to say,
I'm going to involve,
um,

1347
01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:19.400
invest in this silicon valley startup and timber in Colorado or something,

1348
01:31:23.250 --> 01:31:27.430
right?
You know,
that those are intrinsically different things.
So,
and,

1349
01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:32.190
and I think you can,
um,
get a good sense of that,
uh,
uh,
by,

1350
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:34.620
you know,
just even knowing what they are.

1351
01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:39.950
So you'll know that that particular startup will have a particular thing that

1352
01:31:41.341 --> 01:31:45.390
will make it successful.
I don't know what we can imagine.
It might be,

1353
01:31:45.810 --> 01:31:49.920
but it might be having nothing to do with something else.

1354
01:31:49.950 --> 01:31:54.950
So now I think of what are the fundamental determinants of the price movement?

1355
01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:58.530
And you don't have to get so precise about it.

1356
01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:03.550
I to think it through probably,
uh,
maybe,
uh,

1357
01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:06.720
an overly analytical way,
but,
um,

1358
01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:10.950
knowing that they're intrinsically different as good enough.
And then,

1359
01:32:11.010 --> 01:32:15.730
and then now back to your question of,
um,
um,
the data set,

1360
01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:18.620
it then becomes a,
um,

1361
01:32:18.970 --> 01:32:22.690
I'm going to give you more complex answer than you probably want,
but

1362
01:32:24.210 --> 01:32:28.170
let's do it.
Okay.
So,
um,
it has to,
it,

1363
01:32:28.210 --> 01:32:30.250
it has to do with,
um,

1364
01:32:30.370 --> 01:32:35.370
a combination of a sample size and environmentally by it dip biases,

1365
01:32:36.101 --> 01:32:40.120
differences,
in other words.
Um,
first

1366
01:32:41.530 --> 01:32:41.850
how,

1367
01:32:41.850 --> 01:32:46.850
how much sample sized you have and is that over many years or did they have

1368
01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:54.290
something in common that would affect them?

1369
01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:59.860
So if I have many years and a large number of samples in that number of years,

1370
01:33:03.570 --> 01:33:07.020
I can have a higher level of reliability.

1371
01:33:07.530 --> 01:33:12.530
If I'm just looking at the numbers then if I had a short term period because

1372
01:33:12.901 --> 01:33:15.500
correlations will change.
Right?

1373
01:33:16.050 --> 01:33:18.120
So because it,

1374
01:33:18.210 --> 01:33:22.860
so is it a number of years and is it in a different environment?

1375
01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:27.900
I have a rule and in terms of most of my decision making is it,

1376
01:33:28.110 --> 01:33:30.600
it has to be timeless and universal.

1377
01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:36.110
So timeless means if I take a period of time where the correlations or that,

1378
01:33:37.951 --> 01:33:42.450
which I'm discovering true in all of those periods of time.

1379
01:33:42.930 --> 01:33:44.910
So I like to go back a long time,

1380
01:33:44.911 --> 01:33:48.420
but let's say you have a limited amount of data that's a handicap.

1381
01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:53.850
The more data you have,
the better.
But still,
if I change the periods,
um,

1382
01:33:54.450 --> 01:33:57.360
in this year,
did that correlation,

1383
01:33:57.690 --> 01:34:02.690
was it the same as the correlation in the prior year and was the correlation the

1384
01:34:03.001 --> 01:34:06.960
same in the year before that the correlation,
let's say,

1385
01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:11.250
of daily returns or you have correlation,

1386
01:34:11.251 --> 01:34:15.660
a minute returns.
So,
Eh,
so timeless and as far back as you go.

1387
01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:20.700
And I like to deal with universal.
What I mean by universal,

1388
01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:22.270
<v 6>okay.</v>

1389
01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:24.890
<v 7>Um,
is that if,</v>

1390
01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:30.280
if I have a decision rule or equities or bonds or an asset class or something

1391
01:34:31.190 --> 01:34:33.650
and I see its behavior,

1392
01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:38.840
did it behave the same in uh,

1393
01:34:39.100 --> 01:34:44.100
with the same drivers in another country and another country?

1394
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:46.670
So we're the correlations for example,

1395
01:34:46.671 --> 01:34:50.660
between stocks and bonds in Spain,

1396
01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:54.830
similar to the correlations between stocks and bonds in Brazil,

1397
01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:59.930
similar to this correlation stocks and bonds in the United States.

1398
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:01.130
Okay.

1399
01:35:01.130 --> 01:35:06.130
That'll give you more of a sense that the correlation between stocks and bonds

1400
01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:11.660
is x.
Then if you have,

1401
01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:14.240
um,
just it happening in one place.

1402
01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:19.720
So timeless and universal or just for most decisions are,

1403
01:35:21.250 --> 01:35:23.420
uh,
rules that I,
I look at,

1404
01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:28.840
but at the end of the day I get really more comfort by being able to understand

1405
01:35:30.441 --> 01:35:34.760
the intrinsic determinants.
So if I'm talking about investments,

1406
01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:39.710
um,
cause that's the subject we can talk about a lot of other things.
But anyway,

1407
01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:42.110
if I'm talking about correlations of investments,

1408
01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:48.680
every investment is a lump sum cash payment.

1409
01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:52.850
Now for an income stream in the future,

1410
01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:55.100
uh,
if I buy a bond,

1411
01:35:56.100 --> 01:36:00.440
I give a lump sum payment and they're going to give me so much per month all the

1412
01:36:00.441 --> 01:36:03.680
way for whatever the length of the bond is,

1413
01:36:03.681 --> 01:36:07.970
the majority of the 20 years or whatever that is.
If I'm having a stock,

1414
01:36:07.971 --> 01:36:09.290
it's a lump sum payment.

1415
01:36:09.710 --> 01:36:14.120
And then we estimate what are the future cash flows.

1416
01:36:14.690 --> 01:36:18.110
So this is uncertainty about those cash flows but that,

1417
01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:20.060
but you will look at those cashflows,

1418
01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:24.380
they will all be affected by the discount rate,

1419
01:36:24.381 --> 01:36:27.500
the interest rate we use to calculate the present value.

1420
01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:33.700
So there will be an intrinsic reason that they will be correlated and there will

1421
01:36:33.921 --> 01:36:38.780
be intrinsic reasons that they that drive their correlation.

1422
01:36:38.781 --> 01:36:42.470
Let's say if I'm getting too technical,
please excuse me,

1423
01:36:42.471 --> 01:36:47.471
but all of those investments are going to have the interest rate that we're

1424
01:36:49.071 --> 01:36:54.071
using to calculate the present value in common and therefore that will drive a

1425
01:36:55.251 --> 01:37:00.251
correlation between that while the items that affect their cash flows could be

1426
01:37:01.581 --> 01:37:06.581
different and that will drive then something that one can analyze and see that

1427
01:37:07.761 --> 01:37:10.490
there are correlations would be different from that attribute.

1428
01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:15.440
If you break investments down and you look at what the causality is,

1429
01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:20.120
it's you know it's better than if you're just looking at past numbers.

1430
01:37:20.121 --> 01:37:23.720
But you could look at it either of those two ways.
Ideally both

1431
01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:27.930
<v 1>for those people who,
who would like to get a better understanding of the,</v>

1432
01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:32.960
some of the underlying factors that affect the,

1433
01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:36.700
the economic engine,
so to speak,
interest rate,
et Cetera,

1434
01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:39.820
what would your recommendation be if they wanted to educate themselves?

1435
01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:45.720
<v 7>I did a 30 minute video called how the economic machine works in which</v>

1436
01:37:45.941 --> 01:37:50.941
everything that I know that most value describes it,

1437
01:37:51.671 --> 01:37:53.830
30 minutes,
it's on youtube.

1438
01:37:53.831 --> 01:37:57.030
I'd recommend that they go there in 30 minutes.

1439
01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:01.170
They'll have most of what I think is valuable and how,
and,

1440
01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:05.990
and understanding how it works.
Perfect.
It's a pretty simple machine.

1441
01:38:06.570 --> 01:38:09.000
It's like almost anything if you,
if you think about it,

1442
01:38:09.001 --> 01:38:14.001
most of the important things that are driving almost anything can be described

1443
01:38:15.121 --> 01:38:19.020
pretty simply.
So that's what I attempted to do in that video on youtube.

1444
01:38:20.090 --> 01:38:24.960
It's,
um,
it's been downloaded 5 million times and I mean,

1445
01:38:24.961 --> 01:38:29.820
people,
it's rated highly.
So I think it,
I think it's helpful

1446
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:32.250
<v 1>and I will tell everybody listening.</v>

1447
01:38:32.251 --> 01:38:37.251
I'll link to that in the show notes as well so people can easily access that.

1448
01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:42.900
Uh,
just to pose a hypothetical because I'd love to hear how you approach it.

1449
01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:46.690
Not necessarily if it's a long or short decision,
although it could be,

1450
01:38:46.990 --> 01:38:51.990
but just to hear how you would even go about assessing a potential opportunity

1451
01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:57.330
because for instance,
I'm very primitive compared to,

1452
01:38:58.220 --> 01:39:01.410
uh,
how your operation and how you would approach investing.

1453
01:39:01.411 --> 01:39:06.110
But living in Silicon Valley for instance,
uh,
as long as I have,
uh,

1454
01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:07.220
17 years now,

1455
01:39:07.221 --> 01:39:12.221
I have informational advantage when it comes to choosing and assessing different

1456
01:39:14.841 --> 01:39:19.560
startup opportunities and,
uh,
elsewhere people might have a say,

1457
01:39:19.561 --> 01:39:23.240
an analytical or behavioral advantage or fill in the blank.
If,

1458
01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:27.890
if you were to look at,
for instance,
cryptocurrency,

1459
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:29.690
bitcoin,
all this other stuff,

1460
01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:34.840
how would you even begin to assess that and whether it poses a good or bad

1461
01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:39.890
opportunity for investment?

1462
01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:41.061
<v 7>Well,</v>

1463
01:39:41.061 --> 01:39:46.061
everything I look at is I tried to look at who are the buyers and sellers and

1464
01:39:46.911 --> 01:39:50.210
what are they,
what motivates them and what are they going to do?

1465
01:39:50.950 --> 01:39:51.783
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

1466
01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:56.640
<v 7>so I break it down.
I,
I analyze,
uh,
now I would know,</v>

1467
01:39:57.650 --> 01:39:58.660
I don't know,
uh,

1468
01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:02.670
how are we do that a bit coin and I don't know that it would apply to
everything,

1469
01:40:02.970 --> 01:40:04.380
but as a general theme,

1470
01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:09.710
if you know who the buyers and sellers are and what their motivations are,
um,

1471
01:40:10.290 --> 01:40:14.370
how big they are and so on,
you can,
you know,

1472
01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:16.290
you can pretty much calculate,

1473
01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:21.830
you can go a long way to understanding what the price is likely to do in the

1474
01:40:23.671 --> 01:40:28.350
future.
That's very different from something like value investing,

1475
01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:31.500
which is something that's is,
you know,

1476
01:40:31.970 --> 01:40:36.970
my lump sum payment today is this and the future cash flows over the next number

1477
01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:41.700
of years will be this.
So I'm,
I'm very much a much more driven to the,

1478
01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:43.880
um,
the buying and selling.
Um,

1479
01:40:44.370 --> 01:40:49.150
in terms of something like a cryptocurrency,
uh,

1480
01:40:49.210 --> 01:40:51.920
first of all,
I'm not an expert on,
on the cryptocurrencies.

1481
01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:57.260
I would think what I'm describing is super important to get at because there

1482
01:40:59.741 --> 01:41:01.980
were two purposes of occurrancy.

1483
01:41:02.450 --> 01:41:07.450
Any currency is a medium of exchange or a store hold of wealth.

1484
01:41:08.790 --> 01:41:13.790
When we think of dollars and you will use it as a medium of exchange or if we're

1485
01:41:14.191 --> 01:41:15.870
holding it as a bond,

1486
01:41:16.590 --> 01:41:21.420
it's a payment over a period of time and that's it's a store hold of wealth.

1487
01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:27.320
In the case of cryptocurrencies right now it's not a very practical medium of

1488
01:41:28.591 --> 01:41:32.160
exchange yet.
Uh,
I mean it,
you know,
I have,

1489
01:41:32.161 --> 01:41:36.720
I been coins and I tried to go spend them in.
It's not easy to go spend them.
Uh,

1490
01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:42.540
and then when we think of it as,
um,
a store hold of wealth,
no,

1491
01:41:42.541 --> 01:41:45.750
today it's primarily a speculative market.

1492
01:41:46.710 --> 01:41:49.800
So it's somebody knowing that it's not,

1493
01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:53.040
it's intrinsic value that you're going to be looking at.

1494
01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:56.700
It's really thinking about who are the buyers,

1495
01:41:56.820 --> 01:42:01.170
who are the sellers and what they are likely to do and projecting that that's

1496
01:42:01.171 --> 01:42:05.220
going to be the driver of investing in a cryptocurrency.

1497
01:42:05.410 --> 01:42:08.830
<v 1>Could you talk a little bit more about assessing the motivations of buyers and</v>

1498
01:42:08.831 --> 01:42:12.580
sellers and you could do with any asset class or any kind of hypothetical but

1499
01:42:12.581 --> 01:42:15.850
specific example.
Because I guess in my mind,
as,

1500
01:42:15.851 --> 01:42:19.630
as someone who's very much a junior varsity with all of this,

1501
01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:23.930
that the motivations would seem to be at least if people are speculating to get

1502
01:42:23.931 --> 01:42:26.960
rich,
both on the selling side and on the buying side.
So how,

1503
01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:30.940
how do you dig deeper than that?
And,
uh,

1504
01:42:31.130 --> 01:42:32.810
any examples would be super helpful.

1505
01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:38.050
<v 7>Every buyer has behavioral characteristics for certain reasons.</v>

1506
01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:41.020
Um,
so if you,
if you say,
let's say stocks,

1507
01:42:41.470 --> 01:42:45.500
to use a very simple example,
a typical individual,

1508
01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:46.550
um,

1509
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:51.550
maybe mutual fund buyer will buy after something's gone up because they think

1510
01:42:52.791 --> 01:42:55.700
it's a better investment and they'll sell,

1511
01:42:55.701 --> 01:43:00.701
they'll get scared when it goes down because they'll get scared and the think

1512
01:43:01.090 --> 01:43:02.150
it's a worse investment.

1513
01:43:02.810 --> 01:43:07.180
Whereas a typical institutional investors,

1514
01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:12.220
there were a pension fund we'll buy when it goes down because they have to

1515
01:43:12.441 --> 01:43:17.441
rebalance their portfolio to keep an asset allocation mix at a certain level.

1516
01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:22.640
And so if they're losing money in something and making something and other,

1517
01:43:22.641 --> 01:43:25.430
they will balance,
rebalance in a mechanical way.

1518
01:43:26.150 --> 01:43:30.740
And so there are many different ways of knowing,
uh,

1519
01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:33.830
of,
of saying,
okay,
who are the biggest ones?

1520
01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:37.370
Who are the littlest ones,
you know,
but most importantly,

1521
01:43:37.371 --> 01:43:41.900
the biggest ones and what are they motivated to do?
And,

1522
01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:46.820
uh,
by,
by understanding it in that way,
um,
you know,
it's important.

1523
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.640
So you,
you have a lot of,

1524
01:43:50.050 --> 01:43:54.530
a lot of different buyers and sellers in different markets for different reasons

1525
01:43:54.890 --> 01:43:58.920
that when you examine it,
you know,
kind of makes sense.
It somebody might end you,

1526
01:43:58.921 --> 01:43:59.181
you,

1527
01:43:59.181 --> 01:44:04.181
you'd be acquiring some stock may go public and then,

1528
01:44:04.350 --> 01:44:07.760
uh,
the owners have a window that they are,

1529
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:12.790
it's closed for them to sell it and then the window opens up and then they're

1530
01:44:13.011 --> 01:44:14.540
going to sell.
At that time.

1531
01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:18.620
I'm just giving you a whole bunch of examples that,
um,

1532
01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:24.170
one can know or attempt to know,
um,

1533
01:44:24.230 --> 01:44:28.310
that are more than just people wanting to make money.

1534
01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:32.090
Somebody squeezed,
you have,
um,
you know,

1535
01:44:32.091 --> 01:44:36.500
you have a financial squeeze and they need cash so that they're motivated to

1536
01:44:36.501 --> 01:44:40.220
sell it because they need cash.
There are lots of different reasons,

1537
01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:44.430
<v 1>right?
Meaning a distressed seller in the last case,</v>

1538
01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:45.653
<v 7>right.</v>

1539
01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:50.660
And to know on an ongoing basis that the market is made up of that mixture

1540
01:44:52.590 --> 01:44:53.350
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

1541
01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:55.750
<v 7>and so,
Eh,
you know,
as much as,</v>

1542
01:44:55.840 --> 01:45:00.180
as much as one can is a good way of,
uh,
of getting a sense of that

1543
01:45:00.250 --> 01:45:04.180
<v 1>very common where I'm sitting right now,
I'm in San Francisco and,
uh,
so I've,</v>

1544
01:45:04.210 --> 01:45:07.770
I've read and I please correct me if I'm wrong,
but uh,

1545
01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:11.910
from Tony Robbins book,
which included you,
um,

1546
01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:17.040
that I suppose over a long enough period of time,

1547
01:45:17.041 --> 01:45:20.500
anyone's favorite asset class,
I'm paraphrasing this,
uh,

1548
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:25.170
w will decrease by 50 to 70% or something like that.
Yeah,
that's what I said.

1549
01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:28.760
You okay.
Got It.
So what are the implications that the,
the,

1550
01:45:29.170 --> 01:45:33.860
the most important implications of that from the behavioral standpoint of

1551
01:45:33.861 --> 01:45:37.730
investors?
Like what,
how should that change their thinking or behavior?

1552
01:45:38.090 --> 01:45:38.331
<v 7>Well,</v>

1553
01:45:38.331 --> 01:45:42.750
it goes back to the point I was making before that you can come up with a bunch

1554
01:45:42.751 --> 01:45:45.930
of equally good investments.
I mean,
Gen generally speaking,

1555
01:45:46.830 --> 01:45:48.540
all investments are competing.

1556
01:45:49.770 --> 01:45:54.450
And what that means is if one was clearly better than another,

1557
01:45:54.900 --> 01:45:57.810
more money would go into it,
bid up its price,

1558
01:45:57.900 --> 01:46:02.900
and then it would be a comparably according to the marketplace.

1559
01:46:03.501 --> 01:46:05.850
And the marketplace is pretty smart.

1560
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:11.670
In order to be successful and being a tactical,

1561
01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:15.090
you have to be better than the marketplace.
And that is an easy,

1562
01:46:15.091 --> 01:46:20.091
therefore the marketplaces pretty smart that all of those assets are going to

1563
01:46:20.881 --> 01:46:22.980
have roughly speaking,

1564
01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:28.940
comparable expected returns other than the surprises that will take place in the

1565
01:46:29.671 --> 01:46:31.740
future.
And you have a choice.

1566
01:46:31.741 --> 01:46:35.280
You're either going to be smart enough that you think you're going to bet

1567
01:46:35.281 --> 01:46:36.630
against somebody else,

1568
01:46:37.260 --> 01:46:40.980
that they're going to go up or down or you're going to diversify.

1569
01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:45.980
So you can take these assets and achieve a level of balance with those assets

1570
01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:53.480
that doesn't you an expected return but provides you a much lower level of risk.

1571
01:46:56.130 --> 01:47:01.130
And if you can reduce your risk and keep your expected return the same,

1572
01:47:03.090 --> 01:47:07.590
you got to do that.
So diversification as we were talking about before,

1573
01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:12.000
um,
can allow an individual I explained in that book,
I thought by the way,

1574
01:47:12.030 --> 01:47:13.730
was a great book,
uh,

1575
01:47:13.770 --> 01:47:18.770
because what Tony did was to take concepts and make them very clearly conveyed

1576
01:47:20.970 --> 01:47:23.730
for the average reader.
Um,
I explained,

1577
01:47:23.731 --> 01:47:28.731
he interviewed me in the book how to achieve that kind of balance so that you're

1578
01:47:29.490 --> 01:47:34.490
not going to have that because if you lose 50 or 75% of your money in a,

1579
01:47:35.710 --> 01:47:38.410
in a decline,
let's say 50%,

1580
01:47:38.710 --> 01:47:41.770
that means you need 100% return to get back

1581
01:47:42.150 --> 01:47:43.200
<v 1>right where you started.</v>

1582
01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:48.940
<v 7>So you,
you can't,
uh,
you can't allow yourself to do that.</v>

1583
01:47:48.941 --> 01:47:53.440
That's the risk of ruin thing.
So diversification,

1584
01:47:53.441 --> 01:47:58.441
proper diversification can reduce your risk without reducing your return.

1585
01:48:00.020 --> 01:48:01.730
<v 1>There are many different ways to diversify.</v>

1586
01:48:01.731 --> 01:48:06.731
How would your approach differ most if it does from say a David Swenson?

1587
01:48:07.730 --> 01:48:07.941
<v 7>Bye.</v>

1588
01:48:07.941 --> 01:48:12.941
Approaches I was describing it is to balance the risks based on the two factors

1589
01:48:15.221 --> 01:48:19.180
that we were,
the two determinants that we talked about before.
How are,

1590
01:48:19.210 --> 01:48:21.460
what are the intrinsic drivers of those?

1591
01:48:21.970 --> 01:48:26.970
And then also what are the timeless and universal correlations of those assets

1592
01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:31.540
and to it to achieve a balance.

1593
01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:36.860
I'm always looking for a value added risk reducing trade.

1594
01:48:39.770 --> 01:48:44.530
The issue is to look at the intrinsic characteristics and,
and,
and uh,

1595
01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:47.150
and achieve and achieve balance.

1596
01:48:47.810 --> 01:48:52.460
<v 1>You were diversification can get very tricky in the world of say,</v>

1597
01:48:52.461 --> 01:48:53.480
startup investing.

1598
01:48:53.690 --> 01:48:58.480
You mentioned in brief this lockup period is where someone,

1599
01:48:58.570 --> 01:48:59.980
I'm a perfect example of this,

1600
01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:05.280
has made investments that are illiquid for a period of God knows how long,

1601
01:49:05.611 --> 01:49:07.200
seven to 12 years in some cases.

1602
01:49:07.650 --> 01:49:12.650
And what started off as a plan to have say 10% of one's liquid net worth

1603
01:49:13.711 --> 01:49:17.580
invested into startups suddenly becomes 80% of the pie chart.

1604
01:49:18.150 --> 01:49:18.490
<v 7>Um,</v>

1605
01:49:18.490 --> 01:49:23.490
I think are you saying if you have an 80% of your portfolio concentrated

1606
01:49:24.881 --> 01:49:27.820
portfolio and in the one particular asset that's right.

1607
01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:32.200
I would urge you to find out how you're going to hedge that thing.

1608
01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:33.460
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1609
01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:38.260
<v 7>And um,
you know,
there are different ways that you can make that hedge.
You know,</v>

1610
01:49:38.350 --> 01:49:40.080
to some extent it's by something,
but,

1611
01:49:40.081 --> 01:49:44.310
but to some extent you might go into a contract,
uh,

1612
01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:47.200
you know,
it could be done almost,

1613
01:49:47.230 --> 01:49:51.390
I don't know the nature of the particular types of investments,
but,
uh,
it's,

1614
01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:56.600
if it's a particular company with a particular profile that'll be unique to it.

1615
01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:03.580
The only way that you're going to be able to hedge that is to go into some

1616
01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:09.100
probably investment bank and actually explain to them their circumstances and

1617
01:50:09.801 --> 01:50:13.910
find out,
you know,
a structure that has,
uh,

1618
01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:16.130
that they might be able to come across.

1619
01:50:16.370 --> 01:50:20.870
It's going to be a highly impure hedge and,
uh,
you know,

1620
01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:24.640
it needs to be engineered.
So it,
you know,

1621
01:50:24.650 --> 01:50:29.180
it's a very difficult thing and because 80% of your net worth is tied up,

1622
01:50:29.181 --> 01:50:34.181
you can't go have the cash to go buy something that's going to balance it and

1623
01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:41.840
you wouldn't want to borrow and then borrow the cash too.

1624
01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:46.480
Buy something different because probably it's correlation with whatever you're

1625
01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:51.040
using as a diversifier is not going to be reliable.

1626
01:50:51.041 --> 01:50:54.640
And so you're,
you know,
you can really get screwed.

1627
01:50:54.910 --> 01:50:59.620
So I don't know that I have a good answer for that.

1628
01:50:59.830 --> 01:51:02.800
<v 1>Yeah,
it's,
it's a tough one because like you said looking,</v>

1629
01:51:02.801 --> 01:51:07.801
because I don't have anywhere close to the cash required to say take a sort of

1630
01:51:07.991 --> 01:51:10.630
derivative position to,
to try to hedge.

1631
01:51:10.890 --> 01:51:15.890
It's very challenging and like you also observe the impure nature of trying to

1632
01:51:16.561 --> 01:51:20.360
do any kind of secondary with a forward looking promissory note or something

1633
01:51:20.361 --> 01:51:23.210
like that.
In any case,
I don't want to bore people to tears,

1634
01:51:23.211 --> 01:51:26.720
but it's a very common problem in uh,
in silicon valley

1635
01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:30.530
<v 7>it's difficult because it's also a liquid,
you know,</v>

1636
01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:35.820
so much money is a liquid so people can be real rich on paper but pretty poor

1637
01:51:37.451 --> 01:51:38.240
cash wise.

1638
01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:40.370
<v 1>I mentioned tactical and psychological.</v>

1639
01:51:40.371 --> 01:51:44.650
So in a situation like this where you can't,
there is no magic answer.

1640
01:51:44.651 --> 01:51:49.150
There is no necessarily nonobvious solution to this.

1641
01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:53.860
It's just a tough position to be in where you stand to potentially lose a lot.

1642
01:51:54.980 --> 01:51:56.030
What do you say to yourself?

1643
01:51:56.031 --> 01:52:01.031
What's your self talk in a situation like that where you may just be stuck in a

1644
01:52:02.781 --> 01:52:05.900
position where they eat that you can't get out of,
uh,
a,
from a,

1645
01:52:05.901 --> 01:52:07.580
from an investing perspective?

1646
01:52:07.940 --> 01:52:09.800
<v 7>Well,
I think of,
um,</v>

1647
01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:14.300
like how bad am I going to get hurt kind of thing.

1648
01:52:14.301 --> 01:52:19.301
And I almost think in portfolio sometimes that it's better to take a portfolio

1649
01:52:20.011 --> 01:52:23.970
and you have a certain amount of cash and you think,
how bad am I going to get?

1650
01:52:24.250 --> 01:52:28.780
And then you could take your risk and put it in another portfolio and,

1651
01:52:28.790 --> 01:52:33.640
and separate the portfolios rather than to blend them together so that you're,

1652
01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:38.410
you know,
you're actually thinking,
okay,
how bad is it going to get?
And,

1653
01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:40.630
and also like,
okay,

1654
01:52:40.631 --> 01:52:45.631
so it's the nature of the beast and what's the big deal?

1655
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:50.960
I mean,
you're going to,
you know,
when it comes down to it,

1656
01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:53.700
you're going to have a,
you know,

1657
01:52:53.710 --> 01:52:56.480
what can they take away from you so that you're going to have,

1658
01:52:56.980 --> 01:53:00.380
you're going to have a bed to sleep and you're going to have food.

1659
01:53:00.381 --> 01:53:03.430
You're going to have,
you know,
friends.
Uh,

1660
01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:07.700
the most basic good things and you're playing the game and it's the nature of

1661
01:53:07.701 --> 01:53:11.150
the beast.
So I guess that's like for me,

1662
01:53:11.970 --> 01:53:16.100
it's like I keep thinking what are they going to take away from me and what's it

1663
01:53:16.101 --> 01:53:16.970
really going to mean?

1664
01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:22.240
<v 1>Have you ever of red,
for instance,
this book titled More Money Than God,</v>

1665
01:53:22.241 --> 01:53:23.710
which I read a few years ago.

1666
01:53:23.770 --> 01:53:28.200
And there were a number of cases in that book of very over the long term

1667
01:53:28.201 --> 01:53:33.201
successful investors who had hit a point of overwhelm or such high levels of

1668
01:53:33.991 --> 01:53:37.320
stress that they did based on my recollection,

1669
01:53:37.321 --> 01:53:39.960
which could be faulty but effectively hit the reset button.

1670
01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:42.570
They liquidated all their positions and kind of it over.

1671
01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:47.110
Is that something you've ever done?
And if so,
how did you think about that?

1672
01:53:47.890 --> 01:53:52.060
<v 7>No,
I've,
I've,
I've never done it because of stress.
I've,
um,</v>

1673
01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:57.040
I've liquidated positions to take risk off the table because certain things have

1674
01:53:57.041 --> 01:53:59.140
happened and I'd say,
listen,
I just don't know.

1675
01:53:59.141 --> 01:54:03.430
And I'd rather now take a risk off the table.

1676
01:54:03.970 --> 01:54:08.970
But I do know of 'em one terrific investor,

1677
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:14.520
uh,
who got into a very bad mindset.
I mean,

1678
01:54:14.750 --> 01:54:18.600
he just couldn't make anything work for a period of time.
Um,

1679
01:54:18.630 --> 01:54:23.630
and that started to affect his psychology that a worsened his decision making.

1680
01:54:25.110 --> 01:54:30.110
And what he did was he brought his positions down to such a small level,

1681
01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:35.160
uh,
that he was continuing to play the game.
But he,

1682
01:54:35.190 --> 01:54:40.190
but with amounts that wouldn't have that psychological effects until he could

1683
01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:45.020
get back into that mindset and get back into the groove.
Did that work for him?

1684
01:54:45.410 --> 01:54:46.243
That worked for him.

1685
01:54:46.630 --> 01:54:51.630
Psychology is a big deal in psychology is a big deal in the markets.

1686
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:53.260
Um,

1687
01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:58.260
that's why I also find that my rule based algorithmic type of trading a rural

1688
01:54:58.901 --> 01:55:03.620
meaning I take a rule and a decision rule.
So it's not a,
um,

1689
01:55:04.330 --> 01:55:07.180
it's not,
uh,
it's,
it's just,
uh,

1690
01:55:07.270 --> 01:55:12.270
the algorithm is just an expression of my criteria and then I put it into an

1691
01:55:12.761 --> 01:55:13.271
algorithm.

1692
01:55:13.271 --> 01:55:18.271
But by knowing how that algorithm works and having it operate next to me,

1693
01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:26.390
in other words,
I'm doing my decision making in my way.
And then my,

1694
01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:31.430
all my thinking is programmed into the computer so that there is a parallel

1695
01:55:32.201 --> 01:55:37.201
decision making going on by the computer as been fabulous because that computer

1696
01:55:39.641 --> 01:55:44.520
and got no emotions and it's like,
you know,
I don't know,

1697
01:55:44.521 --> 01:55:48.150
a computer chess game,
um,
and,
you know,
and it,

1698
01:55:48.210 --> 01:55:52.890
and it's great and it's been a fabulous experience to have be an ed,

1699
01:55:53.170 --> 01:55:58.020
uh,
playing the game together.
So the taking the emotions out of it,

1700
01:55:58.710 --> 01:56:01.950
um,
is a real,
real plus.

1701
01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:06.480
And I'm a meditator so I can,
you know,
I would say,
you know,

1702
01:56:06.481 --> 01:56:10.940
I don't get as emotional as some people do and,
but,

1703
01:56:10.990 --> 01:56:12.000
but when you go through it,

1704
01:56:12.001 --> 01:56:15.880
because you go through a process in which you're thinking,
um,

1705
01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:19.050
let's say something's going against you in,

1706
01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:21.600
and of course trades will always go against you.
You,

1707
01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:26.380
it's not like you buy something and from that point forward it goes up

1708
01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:32.370
then sell it.
And you know,
I mean,
there's,
it's not like that.

1709
01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:35.910
And so,
um,
if you buy something and good value,

1710
01:56:35.911 --> 01:56:38.940
it might go down before it goes up.

1711
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:43.980
And then when you're in your,
when you're wrestling with,
okay,
now do I sell it?

1712
01:56:44.010 --> 01:56:45.810
It's not like that's the moment either.

1713
01:56:46.170 --> 01:56:51.170
So all every moment you don't know whether you're,

1714
01:56:51.570 --> 01:56:54.770
are you missing something or,
uh,

1715
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:58.200
are you wrong or is it just too early?

1716
01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:03.560
All of that psychology enters into it and you start to think about multiple

1717
01:57:04.081 --> 01:57:08.490
possibilities and um,
and then,
um,
you know,
okay,

1718
01:57:08.491 --> 01:57:12.900
there's more opportunity.
That's why the strategies I'm describing,

1719
01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:15.120
the combination of diversification.

1720
01:57:15.121 --> 01:57:18.840
So no one bat bed is going to matter so much.

1721
01:57:18.841 --> 01:57:23.840
So I have the casino of bets.
So yeah,
if I'm wrong on that,

1722
01:57:23.890 --> 01:57:26.550
but on one or here it's okay.

1723
01:57:26.551 --> 01:57:31.240
But that casino means all my games on balance of going to play,
pay off and,

1724
01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:34.890
and,
and then that,
uh,
that notion of,
um,

1725
01:57:35.370 --> 01:57:39.270
systemizing the decision rules.
These things have been very helpful to me.

1726
01:57:40.460 --> 01:57:44.610
<v 1>This is a great place to,
to wrap up and I think it's,
it's a,</v>

1727
01:57:44.611 --> 01:57:47.940
I'm just going to read a small piece from your book,

1728
01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:50.640
which I highly recommend everybody check out.
I mean,

1729
01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:53.190
just to give everybody an idea,

1730
01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:57.450
one of the testimonials blurbs on the book is from Bill Gates.

1731
01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:00.540
Quote Ray Daleo has provided me with invaluable guidance and insights that are

1732
01:58:00.541 --> 01:58:02.010
now available to you in principles.

1733
01:58:02.011 --> 01:58:06.840
So I think that this is going to do a lot of good in the world and help people

1734
01:58:06.841 --> 01:58:10.480
to make better decisions.
And here's a quick quote quote.

1735
01:58:10.490 --> 01:58:13.970
Every day each of us is faced with a blizzard of situations we must respond to

1736
01:58:13.971 --> 01:58:14.950
without principles.

1737
01:58:14.951 --> 01:58:19.010
We would be forced to react to all things life throws at us individually as if

1738
01:58:19.011 --> 01:58:21.080
we were experiencing each of them for the first time.

1739
01:58:21.720 --> 01:58:23.940
If instead we classify these situations,

1740
01:58:23.941 --> 01:58:26.130
isn't it types and have good principles for dealing with them,

1741
01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:31.280
we will make better decisions more quickly and have better lives as a result.
Uh,

1742
01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:32.610
and I,

1743
01:58:32.790 --> 01:58:37.790
I'm very excited to see what this book does in the world.

1744
01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:41.070
And,
uh,
I suppose just as,

1745
01:58:41.170 --> 01:58:43.690
as one of the very last question is why did you,
why,

1746
01:58:43.691 --> 01:58:45.940
why did you decide to put this book out?
Why now

1747
01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:51.560
<v 7>I'm at a stage in my life where my objective is no longer to be more successful</v>

1748
01:58:51.931 --> 01:58:56.750
myself.
I'm in a transition 68 years old.

1749
01:58:56.780 --> 01:58:57.970
And um,

1750
01:58:58.070 --> 01:59:02.780
I felt that my number one goal is to help people be successful without me.

1751
01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:08.470
And I'm having this collection of recipes that it's been built up over that

1752
01:59:09.981 --> 01:59:12.050
period of time and passing it along.

1753
01:59:12.051 --> 01:59:15.980
So that basically everything that I know is a value in the book,

1754
01:59:16.490 --> 01:59:17.323
um,

1755
01:59:17.480 --> 01:59:22.130
frees me of that responsibility and is,

1756
01:59:22.220 --> 01:59:23.780
uh,
what I,
you know,

1757
01:59:24.290 --> 01:59:27.530
feel is his sense of responsibility and I hope everybody,

1758
01:59:28.430 --> 01:59:33.270
I wish everybody would do the same.
Like I'd love to know,

1759
01:59:33.870 --> 01:59:37.800
you know,
how many people's principles would you love to know?

1760
01:59:38.460 --> 01:59:42.690
By the way,
I've been speaking to a number of,
I won't use the names,

1761
01:59:42.691 --> 01:59:47.691
but a number of 'em very successful people and I know now that they are going to

1762
01:59:52.041 --> 01:59:57.041
be more inclined to put their recipes out and I think it will be fabulous.

1763
01:59:58.881 --> 02:00:03.680
You should write your principles.
I,
you do cheerier principles in many ways,

1764
02:00:04.010 --> 02:00:05.330
but as there as those,

1765
02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:10.390
those recipes and you give these recipe books and people then can compare one to

1766
02:00:10.431 --> 02:00:15.290
another and debate them and operating at that principal level I think is a

1767
02:00:15.291 --> 02:00:20.270
responsibility that I have to do and it kind of frees me up to go to my next

1768
02:00:20.271 --> 02:00:21.104
stage of life.

1769
02:00:21.320 --> 02:00:24.990
<v 1>Well,
I've been taking notes throughout this entire conversation.
I'm going to uh,</v>

1770
02:00:25.190 --> 02:00:28.740
simulate my own pain button and have a number of,

1771
02:00:29.300 --> 02:00:34.080
of homework assignments that I'm looking forward to tackling.
And uh,

1772
02:00:34.490 --> 02:00:38.900
for people listening they can certainly learn a lot about the book and dig

1773
02:00:38.901 --> 02:00:43.730
in@principles.com they can find you on Twitter and elsewhere at Ray Daleo.

1774
02:00:44.490 --> 02:00:45.290
Uh,

1775
02:00:45.290 --> 02:00:50.290
is there anything else you would like to suggest or ask or encourage people to

1776
02:00:54.041 --> 02:00:56.510
do before we wrap this up?

1777
02:00:56.880 --> 02:00:57.713
<v 7>No,
I'll just</v>

1778
02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:03.440
have their own principles that they believe in and be open minded,
right?

1779
02:01:03.441 --> 02:01:08.390
Their principles down,
compare them with others,
find out,
be guided by principles,

1780
02:01:08.391 --> 02:01:09.770
be a principled person.

1781
02:01:10.370 --> 02:01:15.230
I would say that those things probably will help them be not only more

1782
02:01:15.231 --> 02:01:17.660
successful but you know,
comfortable with themselves.

1783
02:01:18.150 --> 02:01:21.570
<v 1>Perfect.
Well rate,
I really appreciate all the time.</v>

1784
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:25.170
This has been a lot of fun for me and I've been looking forward to this ever

1785
02:01:25.171 --> 02:01:29.490
since we,
we met and you're so kind after

1786
02:01:31.050 --> 02:01:33.570
bolstering my confidence after my rehearsal at Ted.

1787
02:01:33.571 --> 02:01:36.270
So I really appreciate all of it in the work that you do.

1788
02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:40.040
<v 7>You nailed it.
It was great.
We</v>

1789
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.050
<v 8>were both like the same.</v>

1790
02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:46.180
<v 7>We're both nervous that we were going to do a lousy job and we both got through</v>

1791
02:01:46.181 --> 02:01:49.830
it well.
So anyway,
thank you also for your,
um,

1792
02:01:50.860 --> 02:01:54.190
very interesting questions and the wonderful exchange.
Thank you.

1793
02:01:54.940 --> 02:01:56.060
<v 8>My pleasure entirely.</v>

1794
02:01:56.061 --> 02:02:00.230
And for everyone listening links to the book to uh,

1795
02:02:00.231 --> 02:02:03.380
raise a video explaining the economy.

1796
02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:07.220
Everything that we talked about can be found in the show notes.

1797
02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:11.210
I will link to everything@tim.blog forward slash podcast or you can find the

1798
02:02:11.211 --> 02:02:14.750
show notes for this episode and every other.
And until next time,

1799
02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:19.100
thank you for listening.
Hey guys,
this is Tim again.

1800
02:02:19.101 --> 02:02:22.280
Just a few more things before you take off.
Number one,

1801
02:02:22.490 --> 02:02:27.470
this is five bullet Friday.
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1802
02:02:27.471 --> 02:02:31.610
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

1803
02:02:31.611 --> 02:02:35.180
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

1804
02:02:35.181 --> 02:02:39.530
short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

1805
02:02:39.531 --> 02:02:40.850
pondering over the week.

1806
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:43.820
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1807
02:02:43.821 --> 02:02:47.270
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1808
02:02:47.271 --> 02:02:51.620
somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1809
02:02:51.860 --> 02:02:56.860
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

1810
02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:00.230
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

1811
02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:05.300
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

1812
02:03:05.390 --> 02:03:07.550
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

1813

Just go to four hour work week.com that's four hour work,

1814
02:03:11.011 --> 02:03:15.200

1815
02:03:15.201 --> 02:03:17.750
next one.

I hope you enjoy it.

1816
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:22.400
This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.
I get asked all the time,

1817
02:03:22.401 --> 02:03:24.560
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

1818
02:03:24.930 --> 02:03:27.500
My answer is inevitably athletic Greens.

1819
02:03:27.501 --> 02:03:29.990
It is your all in one nutritional insurance.

1820
02:03:29.991 --> 02:03:31.700
I recommended it in the four hour body,

1821
02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:35.750
did not get paid for that and I travel with it to avoid getting sick.

1822
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:38.750
I take it in the mornings to ensure optimal performance.

1823
02:03:39.020 --> 02:03:43.310
It just covers all my basis if I can't get what I need through whole food meals

1824
02:03:43.311 --> 02:03:46.730
throughout the rest of the day.

1828
02:03:57.921 --> 02:04:01.700
Each day is part of my routine and it leads you to have less to worry about.

1829
02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:05.320
If for instance,
I have to skip a meal or just can't get a high quality fail,

02:04:05.700 --> 02:04:06.470
so check it out.

Go to athleticgreens.com/tim and learn all about this episode is brought to you

1832
02:04:12.351 --> 02:04:17.351
by four sigmatic founded by the genius Fin's who lit the Internet on fire and

1833
02:04:19.161 --> 02:04:20.990
the,
you may have heard of their mushroom coffee,

1834
02:04:21.050 --> 02:04:25.610
which features Chaga and lion's mane,
which has taken Silicon Valley by storm.

1835
02:04:26.090 --> 02:04:28.580
I use it pretty much every day,

1836
02:04:28.581 --> 02:04:33.500
either that or the Chaga,
which is decaf and a separate version.

1837
02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:37.040
And I use both of these primarily for focus and productivity.

1838
02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:41.400
They just get you going let you up like a Christmas tree.

1839
02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:43.110
So definitely check it out.

1840
02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:47.820
People are always asking me what I use for cognitive enhancement and for right

1841
02:04:47.821 --> 02:04:52.500
now this is the answer.
I try to force this on all of my house guests.

1842
02:04:52.800 --> 02:04:56.850
It is a hell of a thing if I have employees or people come over who are working

1843
02:04:56.851 --> 02:04:57.601
on projects with me,

1844
02:04:57.601 --> 02:05:01.470
I always try to feed it to them because I'm going to get the limitless effect.

1845
02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:03.090
We get a lot more out of them.

1846
02:05:03.570 --> 02:05:08.190
The first time I mentioned this product and four sigmatic on the podcast,

1847
02:05:08.430 --> 02:05:10.350
their products sold out in less than a week.

1848
02:05:10.380 --> 02:05:12.570
So you may want to check them out soon.

1849
02:05:12.571 --> 02:05:15.870
If you're listening to this and the coffee tastes like coffee,

1850
02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:19.590
it takes just seconds to prepare with hot water,

1851
02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:23.730
and oddly enough only includes 40 milligrams of caffeine,

1852
02:05:23.731 --> 02:05:26.610
so it has less than half of what you'd get in a regular cup of coffee.

1853
02:05:27.210 --> 02:05:30.990
I don't get any jitters,
acid reflux or any stomach burn,
any of that.

1854
02:05:31.050 --> 02:05:33.360
It's very unusual and very,
very cool.

1855
02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:38.100
So if you don't like caffeine,
they also offer very strong,

1856
02:05:38.101 --> 02:05:41.760
but caffeine free mushroom elixirs,
which I will sometimes have in the evening.

1857
02:05:41.761 --> 02:05:45.150
I find Chaga specifically to be very,
very grounding and earthy.

1858
02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:46.620
So that is another option.

1859
02:05:46.621 --> 02:05:50.250
And I have a cupboard full of their products at the moment,

1860
02:05:50.251 --> 02:05:53.370
which is right around the corner of my kitchen.
You can try something,

1861
02:05:53.371 --> 02:05:54.930
you can try a sample pack,
which is great.

1862
02:05:54.931 --> 02:05:59.340
Also right now by going to four sigmatic.com forward slash Tim,

1866
02:06:11.250 --> 02:06:15.090
If you were in the experimental mindset,
I do not think you'll be disappointed,

1867
02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:16.073
so try them out.

1868
02:06:32.010 --> 02:06:32.050
<v 6>Yeah.</v>
