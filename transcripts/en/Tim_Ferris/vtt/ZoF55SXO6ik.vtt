1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.880
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:06.090
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.030
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue over another.

4
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.970
<v 2>This episode is brought to you by a cent protein,</v>

5
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:31.971
the cleanest least process protein I've ever consumed and I have tried just

6
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:35.610
about everything since well before the four hour body.

7
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.270
I've started my day with 20 to 30 grams of protein.

8
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.310
First thing that has been part of my routine,

9
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.050
but I don't always have the time or necessarily the desire to cook an entire

10
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:47.670
meal.
So what to do.

11
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.560
Protein powders can be a fast way to get this protein needs met,

12
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.790
but most products are full of crap.
They're bleached,
they have excess sugar,

13
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.690
terrible artificial sweeteners or just straight forward low grade,

14
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.900
low quality protein ascent contains zero artificial ingredients and the parent

15
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:08.520
company is actually a cheese manufacturer,

16
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:13.070
so they produce their own native proteins.
It's,

17
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.150
it's really fascinating and I've looked at they're processing it takes or it

18
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.230
took them about five years to develop.

19
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.390
You can mix the protein in as little as four ounces without any clumps or issues

20
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:28.230
of mixed ability whatsoever.
And they nailed the taste.
They tested,
for instance,

21
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.640
for the chocolate version 282 different versions.

22
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:37.641
It put a lot of money and a lot of time into r and D for this particular

23
00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:42.240
product.
If you love coffee,
they also have a brand new cappuccino flavor,

24
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.640
which is a variation I've enjoyed.

25
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.080
If you prefer to test something outside of the traditional vanilla or chocolate

26
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.390
and they have both way in my cellar casing,

27
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:56.391
so if you want to say improve body composition and recovery overnight slow

28
00:01:56.551 --> 00:02:00.600
release so you can take the my seller casein or in my case whey protein,

29
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.470
I would take postworkout for instance or in the morning,
so check it out.

30
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.880
These guys were really fascinating.

31
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.590
Visit a scent protein.com forward slash Tim,
that's a s,

32

If you want a very quick 20th 30 gram dose to start your day or after workout,

36
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.560
this is a fantastic option.
It is arguably the best that I've found.
So again,

37
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:35.460
chicken up a scent,
protein.com forward slash Tim.

38
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.583
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

39
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.650
<v 2>this episode is brought to you by four sigmatic.</v>

40
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.470
You might remember foursigmatic for their mushroom coffee,

41
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.320
which was created by those clever finished founders.

42
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.110
And when I first mentioned that coffee on this podcast,

43
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.590
the product sold out in less than a week at lights you up like a Christmas tree,

44
00:02:53.591 --> 00:02:56.140
which can be really useful.
However,

45
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.000
recently I've been testing the opposite side of the of new product and that is

46
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:05.380
their Reishi mushroom elixir to help me end my day to get to sleep.

47
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.290
As you guys may know,
longtime listeners,

48
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:12.010
at least I struggled with insomnia for decades.
I have a largely fixed that,

49
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:15.100
but still shutting off my monkey brain has never been easy,

50
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:17.830
still isn't easy very often.
And I've found Reishi,

51
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:21.220
which I've been fascinated by for a few years now,
has been very,

52
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:25.150
very effective and calming their old formula.
However,

53
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:30.040
four sigmatic old formula included Stevia and I like to avoid sweeteners,

54
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.860
all sweeteners for a host of reasons.

55
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.880
And I then just ping them and asked,
hey guys,

56
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.580
I would love to experiment with this and maybe actually suggested,

57
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.020
but I'd like a version without sweeteners if you'd be open to it,

58
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.310
if too much of a headache,
don't worry.

59
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.450
And they are always game for experimentation.

60
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.170
So they created a special custom version without the Stevia,
without sweeteners.

61
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.750
Now it is part of my nightly routine.

62
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.840
Their ratio elixir comes in single serving packets,

63
00:03:58.841 --> 00:04:01.810
which are perfect for travel and in fact I'm about to leave the country right

64
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:03.340
now and I have a packet in front of me.

65
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:06.880
This just going to sit in the end of my carry on bag.

66
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.840
You only need hot water and it mixes very,
very easily.

67
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.610
Here's some recommended copy that they put in the read,

68
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.670
so I'm going to read it and then I'll give you my take quote,

69
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.950
a warning for those in the experimental mindset,

70
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.460
Reishi is strong and bitter in parentheses,
like any great medicine.

71
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.020
So if the bitterness is too much,

72
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:30.370
I recommend trying it with honey end or nut milk such as almond milk and quote.

73
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.530
So I'm going to say no,

74
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.030
you should suck it up and you should drink the tea because it's not that bitter

75
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.260
and maybe should take the advice of all Chinese people when they're criticizing

76
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:43.780
young ins.
When they say [inaudible] should a cool,

77
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.180
which means you're not able to eat bitterness.

78
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.210
Bitter is in many cases an indication of things that help liver detoxification

79
00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:54.100
and so on.
Not saying that's the case here,

80
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:58.900
but I've tested this ratio lecture on family members,

81
00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:02.710
on friends,
everybody has liked it.
It's a little bit earthy.
It's not that hard.

82
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:05.200
So I would just say suck it up and no,

83
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.370
don't put in honey or milk or any of that shit.
Just drink the goddamn tea.

84
00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:12.490
It's delicious I think.
Right?
If you like poo air,
that kind of stuff,

85
00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:16.030
that type of tea,
you're going to dig it.
So just try it.
Okay.

86
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.110
Back to then my read.
If you'd like to naturally improve your sleep,

87
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.060
both onset and quality,

88
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:27.061
I think naturally you might just enjoy this ratio elixir without any sweeteners.

89
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.810
It has organic,
Reishi extract,
organic fueled,
mint extract,

90
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:36.280
organic rose hips extract,
organic Tulsi extract.
And that's it.

91
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.440
No fancy stuff,
no artificial watching McCall at anything.

Well,

105
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:35.811
hello there.

106
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:39.650
Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my job to share

107
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:43.760
the habits,
tools,
and patterns of world class performers of all different types.

108
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.970
This special episode is shorter than usual and features,

109
00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:49.280
thoughts and recommendations from Debbie Millman,

110
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.570
who in her first appearance on this podcast gave a wide ranging and very

111
00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:57.380
emotionally impactful interview that is still one of the most downloaded

112
00:06:57.381 --> 00:06:59.330
episodes of all time on this podcast.

113

You can check that out@tim.blog forward slash.

114
00:07:01.341 --> 00:07:04.280
Debbie if you want a longer form conversation,

115
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.580
but this will be a shorter taste of Debbie,
Debbie,

116
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.010
Debbie Millman on Twitter has been called quote,

117
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:13.940
one of the most influential designers working today and quote by graphic design

118
00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:17.150
USA.
She's the founder and host of design matters,

119
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.390
the world's first and longest running podcast about design where she's

120
00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:24.290
interviewed nearly 300 design luminaries and cultural commentators including

121
00:07:24.291 --> 00:07:28.490
Masimo of Yeley and Milton Glaser.
Debbie has,

122
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.200
I suppose to put it one way done it all.

123
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.060
Her work has been exhibited around the world.

124
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.510
She is the President Ameritus of a IGA,

125
00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:39.020
one of only five women to hold the position and the organization's 100 year

126
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:39.710
history,

127
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:43.190
the editorial and creative director of print magazine and the author of six

128
00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:47.480
books in 2009 Debbie cofounded alongside Steven Heller,

129
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.170
the world's first masters program in branding at the school of visual arts in

130
00:07:51.171 --> 00:07:53.720
New York City,
which has received international acclaim.

131
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:59.060
So she has been on many different adventures in many different fields and has

132
00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:00.560
learned a lot of very,

133
00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:03.800
very impactful lessons that you can apply hopefully to your own life.

134
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.620
In this episode,
Debbie outlines more than a few things,

135
00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:11.000
but among them she talks about how to bounce back from rejection and criticism

136
00:08:11.001 --> 00:08:14.000
and share some of her personal stories,
the importance of mental health,

137
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:18.260
whether courage or confidence is more important.
If you had to pick one,

138
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:22.870
five questions to help you clarify your own purpose and much,
much more so.

139
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.710
Without further ado,
please enjoy this shorter episode with Debbie Millman.

140
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.193
<v 1>Okay.</v>

141
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:31.791
<v 3>Debbie,</v>

142
00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:36.791
what is the book or books that you've given most as a gift and why or what?

143
00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:42.230
Or one say two,
three books that have greatly influenced your life?
Well,

144
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:47.120
a book that has influenced my life and when that I keep going back to over and

145
00:08:47.121 --> 00:08:50.990
over is the anthology,
the voice that is great within us.

146
00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:53.810
American poetry of the 20th century,

147
00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.710
gorgeously thoughtfully and carefully edited by Hayden Carruth.

148
00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:03.180
It was required reading in a summary College class I attended back in the early

149
00:09:03.181 --> 00:09:08.181
1980s this funny looking book introduced me to my most treasured,

150
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:13.050
deeply felt comb maximus to himself by Charles Olson,

151
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:18.260
which has since become the blueprint of my life as well as the poetry of Denise

152
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.650
Levertov,
Adrienne Rich,
Ezra pound,
Wallace Stevens,

153
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:23.970
and so many more.

154
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.910
I still have my original copy from the 1980s and the,

155
00:09:27.911 --> 00:09:31.890
the cover has come off and the spine is cracked in numerous places.

156
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.770
I will never replace it.
And Tim,

157
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:39.771
I thought I'd read a version of Charles Olson's maximus to himself since it is

158
00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:45.270
my favorite poem and I get such great joy reading this

159
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.590
maximus to himself by Charles Olson.

160
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.670
I have had to learn this simplest things last,

161
00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:58.330
which made for difficulties even at sea.

162
00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:03.390
I was slow to get the handout or to cross a wet deck to see was not finally my

163
00:10:04.781 --> 00:10:07.780
trade,
but even my trade at it.

164
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.260
I stayed a strange from that which was most familiar,

165
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:16.710
was delayed and not content with the man's argument that such postponement is

166
00:10:17.471 --> 00:10:22.270
now the nature of obedience,
that we are all late in a slow time,

167
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.690
that we grew up many and the single is not easily known.

168
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.260
It could be though the sharpness,

169
00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:34.320
the ACI oat I note in others makes more sense than my own distances.

170
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:39.900
The agility's they show daily who do the world's businesses and who do natures

171
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:45.340
as I have no sense.
I have done either.
I've made dialogs,

172
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:49.930
have discussed ancient texts have thrown what light I could offered,

173
00:10:49.931 --> 00:10:52.150
what pleasures do seat allows,

174
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.960
but the known this I have had to be given a life love and from one man the world

175
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.863
tokens,

176
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.940
but sitting here I look out as a wind and water man testing and missing some

177
00:11:06.941 --> 00:11:11.380
proof.
I know the quarters of the weather where it comes from,
where it goes,

178
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:12.910
but the stem of me,

179
00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:18.180
this I took from their welcome or their rejection of me and my arrogance was

180
00:11:18.641 --> 00:11:22.270
neither diminished nor increased by the communication.

181
00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.030
It is undone business.

182
00:11:25.031 --> 00:11:30.031
I speak of this morning with the sea stretching out from my feet.

183
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:36.270
What purchase of $100 or less has most positively impacted your life in the last

184
00:11:36.271 --> 00:11:38.340
six months or in recent memory?

185
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.450
One of the purchase that has influenced me over the last six months is the apple

186
00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:43.284
pencil.

187
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:48.750
I do so much of my artwork by hand and now there is a device that draws and

188
00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:52.440
feels like a real pencil that I can use electronically.

189
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.310
It's changed the way I work.

190
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.890
<v 2>How has a failure or apparent failure set you up for later success?</v>

191
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.420
Do you have a favorite failure and quote of yours?

192
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.950
<v 3>Oh,
Tim,
I have so many failures.</v>

193
00:12:07.951 --> 00:12:11.460
I think the first decade of my career were experiments and failure,

194
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.560
rejection and humiliation,

195
00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:16.800
but I do have a favorite so I will share that.

196
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:22.250
In early 2003 a good friend sent me an email with a subject line that red begin

197
00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:29.211
drinking heavily before opening the email contained a link to a blog titled

198
00:12:30.241 --> 00:12:31.074
Speak Up.

199
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:36.120
The first ever online forum about graphic design and branding in the world

200
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.600
suddenly sprawled before my eyes.

201
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:44.610
I found myself reading an article that disparaged my entire career.

202
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:50.250
This particular incident in tandem with a number of historical rejections and

203
00:12:50.251 --> 00:12:55.251
setbacks and humiliations sent me into a really deep depression and I seriously

204
00:12:56.731 --> 00:13:01.200
considered leaving the design profession altogether.
However,

205
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.890
however,
in the 14 years since this occurred,

206
00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:10.200
this utter takedown of everything I'd done to date and everything I thought was

207
00:13:10.201 --> 00:13:12.780
a complete and total failure for a long,

208
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:18.020
long time ultimately transformed into the foundation of everything I've done

209
00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:23.931
since everything I am doing now contains the seeds of origin from that time.

210
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.640
So it turns out for me the worst professional experience I've faced ultimately

211
00:13:33.151 --> 00:13:38.151
became the most important defining experience of my life.

212
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:42.560
<v 2>Debbie,
if you could have a giant billboard anywhere with anything on it,</v>

213
00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.330
what would it say and why?

214
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.100
<v 3>This is easy.</v>

215
00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.780
My billboard would save this busy is a decision.

216
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:55.880
I say this all the time ad nauseum and here's why.
Of the many,

217
00:13:55.910 --> 00:14:00.080
many excuses people use to rationalize why they can't do something.

218
00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:05.060
The excuse I am too busy is not only the most inauthentic.

219
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.800
It is also the laziest.
I don't believe in too busy.

220
00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:14.930
Busy is a decision we do the things we want to do period.

221
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.120
If we say we're too busy,

222
00:14:17.121 --> 00:14:20.570
I believe it is shorthand for not important enough.

223
00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.500
It means you would rather be doing something else that you consider more

224
00:14:24.501 --> 00:14:27.380
important.
That thing could be sleep.
It could be sex,

225
00:14:27.381 --> 00:14:28.910
it could be watching game of Thrones.

226
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.830
If we use busy as an excuse for not doing something,
what we are really,

227
00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:38.570
really saying is that it's not a priority.
It's not as important to us,

228
00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.410
so simply put,
you don't find the time to do something.

229
00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.990
You make the time to do things.

230
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:49.790
I think we're now living in a society that sees busy as a badge.

231
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.630
It has become cachet to use the excuse.

232
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:58.010
I am too busy as a reason for not doing anything.
We don't feel like doing.

233
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:59.480
The problem is this.

234
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:03.710
If you let yourself off the hook for not doing something for any reason,

235
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.220
you won't ever do it.
If you want to do something,

236
00:15:07.221 --> 00:15:10.520
you can't let being busy stand in the way.
Even if you are busy,

237
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:15.620
make the time to do the things you want to do and then follow through and do

238
00:15:15.621 --> 00:15:16.454
them.

239
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.140
What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you've ever made?

240
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.260
This answer might surprise you or maybe not,

241
00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:28.670
but the best investment I've ever made was in psychotherapy.

242
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:30.260
When I first started,

243
00:15:30.261 --> 00:15:35.261
I was in my early thirties and the bills practically killed me,

244
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:39.890
but I knew I needed to deeply understand all the destructive things that had

245
00:15:39.891 --> 00:15:44.891
happened to me in order to try to live a remarkable life despite these things,

246
00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:49.580
and I wanted this more than anything over the years.

247
00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.870
I still sometimes smart at the mum at the monthly invoices,

248
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:58.100
but I've never doubted that this investment has profoundly,

249
00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:00.530
profoundly shaped who I've become.

250
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.740
And although I still think I have a lot of work to do,

251
00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:08.090
it's changed and then saved my life in every imaginable way.

252
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:13.010
And I'm in what is called psychoanalytic psychotherapy.
Put another way,

253
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:17.720
psycho analysis with an emphasis on self psychology.
And so for me,

254
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.710
talk therapy is the only thing that I've ever really felt drawn to.

255
00:16:21.711 --> 00:16:25.730
Things like EMDR and behavior modification might be really,

256
00:16:25.731 --> 00:16:29.240
really helpful for other people,
but they seem a little bit to Voodoo for me.

257
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:33.200
So some things that I think are important to consider strictly from my

258
00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:33.771
perspective,

259
00:16:33.771 --> 00:16:38.771
I'm not an expert at assessing or analyzing the value or worth of psycho

260
00:16:39.931 --> 00:16:44.660
analysis only.
I am able to convey what this has done for me.

261
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.490
Um,
but for,
for me,

262
00:16:46.491 --> 00:16:51.491
once a week therapy did not work well twice or more gives you a continuity and

263
00:16:51.681 --> 00:16:55.580
an opportunity to germinate in a way that once a week doesn't.
Also,

264
00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:57.530
once a week almost feels like a catch up.

265
00:16:57.531 --> 00:17:00.920
You sort of bring the therapist up to speed on what happened in the last week

266
00:17:00.921 --> 00:17:03.620
and then you have 20 minutes to sort of talk about what's happening right now.

267
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.620
Therapy takes time.

268
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.370
I often say that anything worthwhile takes a long time and therapy is one of

269
00:17:10.371 --> 00:17:14.720
those things.
I've been in therapy for a really long time for decades,

270
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:20.170
but I can now after those decades actually point to empirical evidence of how my

271
00:17:21.171 --> 00:17:26.171
behavior in the world by my sense of who I am has fundamentally fundamentally

272
00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:29.420
changed.

273
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.760
And so being in therapy and being in therapy for any length of time,

274
00:17:34.761 --> 00:17:38.990
it takes dedication.
It takes stamina,
it takes resilience,
persistence,

275
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:44.470
and a lot of courage to face things that you might be really afraid to look at.

276
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:49.560
So it's not a quick fix,
but,
but like I said,
it's really saved my life.

277
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.340
Try and tell your therapist everything.

278
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:58.140
If you edit who you are or if you pretend to be something that you're not in

279
00:17:58.141 --> 00:18:00.150
order to impress the therapist.

280
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.600
If you want to project who were how you want to be seen,

281
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:07.260
it will take that much longer.
So just be yourself.

282
00:18:07.261 --> 00:18:09.630
They've likely in their practice,

283
00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:14.280
heard everything they understand humanity.
So just be yourself.

284
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.800
If you're afraid your therapist will judge you.

285
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.210
Tell them that also because that whole projection is really critical to

286
00:18:21.211 --> 00:18:24.990
understanding the dynamic that you have with people in general.

287
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.170
So all of these things are really important to talk about.

288
00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.180
There is no shame in feeling shame.

289
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.660
And I'm saying this from a place of deep empathy.

290
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.180
Almost everyone feels shame.

291
00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:43.670
I think Renee Brown says that anybody that doesn't feel shame is likely,
um,

292
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.140
a pathological person.

293
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:50.430
So almost everyone does in therapy will help you understand it.

294
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.900
There was nothing like understanding your motivations and insecurities to help

295
00:18:54.901 --> 00:18:59.790
you integrate all of those feelings in your psyche in the most healthy and

296
00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:03.990
authentic way.
So for me,

297
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.380
I would not recommend going to a therapist that one of your friends goes to

298
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.860
asking your friends for,
for all.

299
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:14.010
And then going to somebody that they see might seem like a good idea because

300
00:19:14.011 --> 00:19:15.090
that person trusts them.

301
00:19:15.091 --> 00:19:17.970
And therefore by extension you might feel like you can too.

302
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:23.540
But it ends up blurring things.
Um,

303
00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:24.270
quite a bit.

304
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:28.770
And I think most therapists abide by this rule now of not seeing friends of or

305
00:19:28.771 --> 00:19:30.800
clients of,
of friends.
Um,

306
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:35.580
things really do get very blurry and boundaries can get weird and I just don't

307
00:19:35.581 --> 00:19:39.900
recommend that.
Okay,
big elephant in the room here.

308
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.880
It is going to be expensive.

309
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.690
But what is more valuable than better understanding who you are,

310
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:48.090
breaking intrinsic bad habits,

311
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:52.110
getting over much of your shit or at least understanding why you do the shit in

312
00:19:52.111 --> 00:19:56.100
the first place and generally living a happier,
more contented,

313
00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:00.210
more peaceful life.
One thing that I've come to understand recently,

314
00:20:00.211 --> 00:20:04.110
and this was actually not only through the help of my therapist and guidance

315
00:20:04.111 --> 00:20:06.240
from my therapist,
but also through my dear,

316
00:20:06.241 --> 00:20:10.020
dear friend Seth Goden is understanding the difference between happiness and

317
00:20:10.021 --> 00:20:10.854
pleasure.

318
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:16.130
And I think people are often trying to reach for and strive for pleasure and,

319
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:23.420
and the response to trying to seek pleasure is actually wanting more pleasure

320
00:20:24.331 --> 00:20:27.300
after that.
You know,
we live on this hedonistic treadmill,

321
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.720
we metabolize our purchases and our experiences very quickly.

322
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:35.340
And so when we have that pleasure or experience that pleasure,
then we want more.

323
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.600
Happiness is very different.
Happiness essentially means you're okay as is,

324
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.140
you don't need more,
you don't want more,
you feel good with what you have.

325
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:48.430
And I think that therapy really helps you understand the difference between what

326
00:20:48.431 --> 00:20:50.350
you see,
what your motivations are,

327
00:20:50.351 --> 00:20:53.980
and ultimately what you want and how you can manifest that in your life.

328
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:59.770
So breaking these intrinsic bad habits,

329
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:04.510
getting over much of your shit and generally living this happier,
more contented,

330
00:21:04.511 --> 00:21:09.511
more peaceful life is something that I think is the ultimate gift of therapy or

331
00:21:11.411 --> 00:21:14.240
the payoff.
And,
and lastly,

332
00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:17.230
my advice to anyone looking for a therapist is to make sure they're really

333
00:21:17.231 --> 00:21:20.050
trained eye.
I highly recommend training here,

334
00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.890
a phd and MD plus postdoctoral training.

335
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.170
You really do get what you pay for here.

336
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:31.170
And I highly recommend somebody that is truly fully educated in what they do.

337
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.910
What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love?

338
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:42.430
I've been told that because I like to make up silly songs and then sing them in

339
00:21:42.431 --> 00:21:47.431
all sorts of absurd situations and occurrences that I am trying to turn my life

340
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.230
into a Hollywood musical.
And,

341
00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:55.060
and since I was first told that I've come to completely agree with that and I

342
00:21:55.061 --> 00:21:58.390
think that is awesome.
But I have songs for everything.
I have songs,

343
00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.600
I used to have songs for feeding my cats,
but they've,
since both passed away,

344
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.530
I have songs for my dogs.
I have songs while I'm cooking.

345
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:10.710
I usually take some well known tune and then rewrite the lyrics for whatever it

346
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:15.670
is I'm experiencing.
So for example,
when I was feeding my cats,

347
00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.000
when I would open up the cans of cat food,
I would sing,

348
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.630
who wants said fancy?
Who wants,
if Iste,

349
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:27.550
who wants it fancy?
Who wants it?
Sti.
Feastly fancy,

350
00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:31.510
fancy.
Festy let's open up the cans now.

351
00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:35.890
They loved it.
Everybody else around me hated it,
but they loved it.

352
00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.630
In the last five years,
what new belief,
behavior,

353
00:22:40.631 --> 00:22:45.220
or habit has most improved your life after a design matters interview with the

354
00:22:45.221 --> 00:22:46.630
great writer Danny Shapiro,

355
00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:50.320
we started to talk about the role of confidence in success.
Apparently,

356
00:22:50.321 --> 00:22:55.060
I think at that time about four new books on confidence had come out and she

357
00:22:55.061 --> 00:23:00.061
went on to state that she felt that confidence was highly overrated and I was

358
00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:03.760
instantly intrigued and asked her why,

359
00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:08.560
and she explained that she felt that most people that she felt that most overly

360
00:23:08.561 --> 00:23:13.561
confident people were really annoying and that most confident people,

361
00:23:14.261 --> 00:23:16.810
we're usually a little bit on the arrogant side.

362
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:21.490
She felt that over exuding that amount of confidence was a sure sign that a

363
00:23:21.491 --> 00:23:26.491
person was compensating for some type of internal psychological deficit.

364
00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:28.421
Instead,

365
00:23:28.421 --> 00:23:33.070
Danny declared that courage was more important than confidence.

366
00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:38.790
Taking that first step in doing anything was the real key to begin to manifest

367
00:23:39.821 --> 00:23:44.680
the possibility of that thing happening.
So when you're operating out of courage,

368
00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:48.260
you're saying that no matter how you feel about yourself or your opportunities

369
00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:53.000
or the outcome,
you're going to take a risk and take a step toward what you want.

370
00:23:53.001 --> 00:23:57.170
You're not waiting for the confidence to mysteriously arrive.

371
00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.450
And since then I've been thinking a lot about,

372
00:23:59.451 --> 00:24:01.400
well how do you develop confidence?
How do you,

373
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.790
how do you bring that confidence to whatever it is you do?

374
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:09.140
And I've come to the conclusion that,
and this is my definition of,

375
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:10.490
of confidence now,

376
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:15.200
is that confidence is the successful repetition of any endeavor.

377
00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:18.980
So if you think back to something that you had to learn for the first time

378
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:23.870
walking,
for example,
you didn't start walking and just start walking perfectly.

379
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:25.700
You were crawling,
you are holding onto things.

380
00:24:25.701 --> 00:24:30.701
And then ultimately you get that ability to step up and take that first step and

381
00:24:31.041 --> 00:24:34.430
then you learn how to walk.
But even a better example I think is,

382
00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:38.750
I think he's driving when most of us start driving,

383
00:24:38.751 --> 00:24:42.620
we have to take driving lessons were really nervous about being in the car.

384
00:24:42.621 --> 00:24:45.800
Behind the wheel.
We have this big instrument that we have to control.

385
00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.270
Most of us were really,

386
00:24:47.271 --> 00:24:51.560
really nervous at a driver tea at her driving test and are hoping and praying

387
00:24:51.561 --> 00:24:55.250
that we'll be able to pass.
But over time when she do pass,

388
00:24:55.251 --> 00:24:59.150
once you have your license,
you start driving more regularly.

389
00:24:59.151 --> 00:25:01.910
You turn on the ignition and you drive around,
you do your errands,

390
00:25:01.911 --> 00:25:04.790
you take road trips,
cross country trips,
whatever.

391
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:08.810
And after a certain amount of time when you get into the car and turn on the

392
00:25:08.811 --> 00:25:09.644
ignition,

393
00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:14.420
you don't worry about the possibility that this might be the day that you kill

394
00:25:14.421 --> 00:25:18.590
someone behind the wheel.
You have what I call car confidence.

395
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:20.001
You get in the car,

396
00:25:20.001 --> 00:25:22.430
you know how to drive and you figure that you're going to be able to get from

397
00:25:22.431 --> 00:25:25.640
point a to point B.
Um,
rather unremarkably.

398
00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:29.570
And I think that that is the case for anything that we do.

399
00:25:29.571 --> 00:25:31.010
Anything new that we start,

400
00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:35.750
it's highly unlikely that we will feel enormously confident doing something

401
00:25:35.751 --> 00:25:37.220
we've never done before.

402
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:42.050
It takes time to be able to manifest confidence through the successful

403
00:25:42.051 --> 00:25:43.970
repetition of any endeavor.

404
00:25:43.971 --> 00:25:48.920
We ended up having a certain internal pattern recognition by the fact that we've

405
00:25:48.921 --> 00:25:51.470
done this thing before fairly well,

406
00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:55.610
maybe excellently and we anticipate that the results will be the same the next

407
00:25:55.611 --> 00:25:58.880
time we do it.
So the more you practice doing something,

408
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.200
the better you will inevitably get at it and your confidence will then grow over

409
00:26:03.201 --> 00:26:04.034
time.

410
00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:09.350
What advice would you give to a smart driven college student about to enter the

411
00:26:09.351 --> 00:26:13.280
real world?
Or what advice do you think they should ignore?
Well,
since I teach,

412
00:26:13.281 --> 00:26:16.490
I have a lot of opinions on what advice to give college students.

413
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.760
I think one of the most important is about job hunting.

414
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.010
Like everything else meaningful in life.

415
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.980
It takes training to get good at job hunting.

416
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:28.550
You don't just find and get a great job,
you know,

417
00:26:28.551 --> 00:26:31.880
just go to the supermarket and pick a great job off of a shelf.

418
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:36.320
You have to find and win a great job against a pool,

419
00:26:36.321 --> 00:26:41.321
a very competitive candidates who may want that job as much if not more than you

420
00:26:43.441 --> 00:26:47.430
do.
So finding and winning a great job.

421
00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:52.110
It's a competitive sport that requires as much career athleticism and

422
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:54.990
perseverance as making it to the Olympics.

423
00:26:55.140 --> 00:27:00.140
You must be in the finest career shape possible in order to win.

424
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:04.650
There is very little luck involved and I've done hundreds of design matters

425
00:27:04.651 --> 00:27:09.460
interviews where I'm sitting across people,
really successful people that say,
oh,

426
00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:13.770
it was just luck.
I just got lucky.
And I look at them and I always say really?

427
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:17.970
Because it's very little to do with luck.
There might be some timing involved,

428
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:23.240
but it's the timing that is resulting in showing up every day,

429
00:27:23.461 --> 00:27:24.390
doing the work,

430
00:27:24.391 --> 00:27:27.990
getting better and better and better at the work and then being the person most

431
00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:30.930
qualified when that opportunity shows up.

432
00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:36.390
Winning your great job is about hard work.
It's about stamina,
it's about grit,

433
00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.340
ingenuity and timing.

434
00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:43.580
And what might look like look to you is simply hard work paying off.

435
00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.990
So here's some questions I tell my students to ask themselves as they sat out on

436
00:27:48.991 --> 00:27:51.930
their path in the real world to win a job.

437
00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:56.940
Am I spending enough time on looking for finding and working toward winning a

438
00:27:56.941 --> 00:28:01.200
great job?
And my constantly refining and improving my skills.

439
00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:06.060
What can I continue to get better and more competitive at two I believe that I

440
00:28:06.061 --> 00:28:09.900
am working harder than everyone else.
If not,

441
00:28:09.901 --> 00:28:14.901
what can and should I be doing in order to be able to accomplish that?

442
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:20.130
What are the people who are competing with me doing that I am not doing?

443
00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:26.480
Am I doing everything I can every single day to stay in career shape?

444
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.470
If not,
what else should I be doing?

445
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:37.310
One piece of advice I think that people should ignore is the value of being a

446
00:28:37.621 --> 00:28:42.600
people person because as lovely as it might be to be a people person,

447
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.460
no one cares if you're a people person,

448
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.330
have a point of view and share it meaningfully,
thoughtfully,

449
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:50.940
respectfully,
and with conviction.

450
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:57.240
What are bad recommendations you hear in your profession or area of expertise?

451
00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.550
I don't believe in work life balance.

452
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.010
I believe if you view your work as a calling,

453
00:29:02.011 --> 00:29:06.810
it is a labor of love rather than laborious.
When your work is a calling,

454
00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:10.590
you're not approaching the amount of hours you were working with with a sense of

455
00:29:10.591 --> 00:29:11.970
dread or counting.

456
00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:16.530
The minutes until the weekend you're calling can become a life affirming

457
00:29:16.531 --> 00:29:21.531
engagement that can provide its own balance and spiritual nourishment and

458
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:24.300
ironically,
it takes hard work to achieve this.

459
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:27.210
So when you're in your twenties and your thirties and you want to have a

460
00:29:27.211 --> 00:29:30.780
remarkable fulfilling career,
you must work hard.

461
00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:35.610
If you don't work harder than everyone else,
you will not get ahead.
Also,

462
00:29:35.611 --> 00:29:39.690
if you're looking for work life balance in your 20s or 30s you're likely in the

463
00:29:39.691 --> 00:29:42.520
wrong career.
If you're doing something that you love,

464
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:44.680
you don't want work life balance.

465
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:48.280
You want to be able to do this thing that you love as often as possible.

466
00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:54.060
When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused,
what do you do?
Well,

467
00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.000
as a loud mouth native New Yorker,

468
00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:02.370
I have often regretted acting impulsively when I'm feeling angry or frustrated

469
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.470
and now when I feel that familiar,

470
00:30:04.471 --> 00:30:09.420
urge to respond defensively or see things that I don't really mean or bang out a

471
00:30:09.421 --> 00:30:14.220
wounded response via email or text to some,
suppose it hurt.

472
00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:17.640
I wait,
I forced myself to breathe.

473
00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:22.790
Take a step back and wait to respond just an hour or two or an overnight retreat

474
00:30:23.581 --> 00:30:28.140
makes a world of difference and if all else fails,

475
00:30:28.141 --> 00:30:32.730
I tried to obey this message I got in a fortune cookie,

476
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:35.550
which I've since taped to my laptop.

477
00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:39.420
Avoid compulsively making things worse.

478
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.590
<v 0>Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

479
00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.560
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

480
00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:52.800
Do you want to get a short email from me?

481
00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:57.000
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

482
00:30:57.001 --> 00:31:00.570
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

483
00:31:00.571 --> 00:31:04.890
short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

484
00:31:04.891 --> 00:31:06.180
pondering over the week.

485
00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.180
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

486
00:31:09.181 --> 00:31:12.660
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

487
00:31:12.661 --> 00:31:16.950
somehow dug up in the other world of the esoteric as I do.

488
00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:22.250
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

489
00:31:22.921 --> 00:31:25.620
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

490
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:30.690
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

491
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:32.940
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

492
00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:37.860
Just go to a four hour work week.com that's four hour workweek.com all spelled

493
00:31:37.861 --> 00:31:41.010
out and just drop in your email and you'll get the very next one.

494
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.110
And if you sign up,
I hope you enjoy it.

495
00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:47.100
This episode is brought to you by four sigmatic.

496
00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:49.920
You might remember four sigmatic for their mushroom coffee,

497
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.710
which was created by those clever finished founders.

498
00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.560
And when I first mentioned that coffee on this podcast,

499
00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:59.040
the product sold out in less than a week.
It lights you up like a Christmas tree,

500
00:31:59.041 --> 00:32:01.560
which can be really useful.
However,

501
00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:06.000
recently I've been testing the opposite side of the spectrum of new product and

502
00:32:06.001 --> 00:32:10.800
that is their Reishi mushroom elixir to help me end my day to get to sleep.

503
00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.740
As you guys may know,
longtime listeners,

504
00:32:13.741 --> 00:32:17.400
at least I struggled with insomnia for decades.
I have a largely fixed that,

505
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:20.520
but still shutting off my monkey brain has never been easy.

506
00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.280
It still isn't easy very often.
And I found Reishi,

507
00:32:23.281 --> 00:32:26.670
which I've been fascinated by for a few years now,
has been very,

508
00:32:26.671 --> 00:32:30.540
very effective and calming their old formula.
However,

509
00:32:30.541 --> 00:32:35.460
four sigmatic old formula included Stevia and I like to avoid sweeteners,

510
00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:40.520
all sweeteners for a host of reasons and I then just ping them and asked,

511
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:46.010
hey guys,
I would love to experiment with this and maybe actually suggested,

512
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:49.460
but I'd like a version without sweeteners if you'd be open to it.

513
00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:50.750
Too much of a headache,
don't worry.

514
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:54.890
And they are always game for experimentation.

515
00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:57.830
And so they created a special custom version without the Stevia,

516
00:32:57.831 --> 00:33:01.160
without sweeteners.
Now it is part of my nightly routine.

517
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.310
Their ratio looks or comes in single serving packets,

518
00:33:04.311 --> 00:33:05.930
which are perfect for travel.
And in fact,

519
00:33:05.931 --> 00:33:08.780
I'm about to leave the country right now and I have a packet in front of me

520
00:33:08.781 --> 00:33:12.260
that's just going to sit in the end of my carry on bag.

521
00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:16.250
You only need hot water and it mixes very,
very easily.

522
00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:21.020
Here's some recommended copies that they put in the read.

523
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:25.190
So I'm going to read it and I'll give you my take quote,
a warning for those.

524
00:33:25.191 --> 00:33:28.840
And the experimental mindset.
Reishi is strong and bitter in parentheses,

525
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:31.460
like any great medicine.
So if the bitterness is too much,

526
00:33:31.461 --> 00:33:35.790
I recommend trying it with honey end or nut milk such as almond milk and quote.

527
00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:37.910
So I'm going to say no,

528
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.440
you should suck it up and you should drink the tea because it's not that bitter.

529
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:46.700
And maybe should take the advice of all Chinese people when they're criticizing

530
00:33:46.701 --> 00:33:49.190
young ins.
When they say food,
I'm sure.
Cool.

531
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:51.620
Which means you're not able to eat bitterness.

532
00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:56.660
Bitterness is in many cases and indication of things that help liver

533
00:33:56.661 --> 00:33:59.540
detoxification and so on.
Not saying that's the case here,

534
00:33:59.541 --> 00:34:04.340
but I've tested this ratio lecture on family members,

535
00:34:04.341 --> 00:34:06.820
on friends.
Everybody has liked it.
It's a little bit,
or if the,

536
00:34:06.821 --> 00:34:10.640
it's not that hard.
So I would just say suck it up and no,

537
00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:14.840
don't put it in honey or milk or any of that ship.
Just drink the goddamn tea.

538
00:34:14.841 --> 00:34:17.870
It's delicious.
I think.
I feel like who air and that kind of stuff,

539
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:21.470
that type of teeth,
you're going to dig it.
So just try it.
Okay.

540
00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:25.490
Back to then my read.
If you'd like to naturally improve your sleep,

541
00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:27.470
both onset and quality,

542
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:32.500
I think naturally you might just enjoy this ratio lecture without any

543
00:34:32.751 --> 00:34:37.250
sweeteners.
It has organic,
Reishi extract,
organic field,
mint extract,

544
00:34:37.251 --> 00:34:41.660
organic rose hips extract,
organic Tulsi extract.
And that's it.

545
00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:46.880
No fancy stuff,
no artificial watching McCall at anything.

558
00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:40.740
This episode is brought to you by a cent routine,

559
00:35:40.741 --> 00:35:45.741
the cleanest least process protein I've ever consumed and I have tried just

560
00:35:46.111 --> 00:35:49.320
about everything since well before the four hour body.

561
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.980
I've started my day with 20 to 30 grams of protein.

562
00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.050
First thing that has been part of my routine,

563
00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:59.820
but I don't always have the time or necessarily the desire to cook an entire

564
00:35:59.821 --> 00:36:01.320
meal,
so what to do.

565
00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:06.270
Protein powders can be a fast way to get this protein needs met,

566
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:10.500
but most products are full of crap.
They're bleached,
they've excess sugar,

567
00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:14.400
terrible artificial sweeteners for just straightforward low grade,

568
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:15.600
low quality protein.

569
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:21.200
Ascent contains zero artificial ingredients and the parent company is actually a

570
00:36:21.321 --> 00:36:25.800
cheese manufacturer so that they produced their own native proteins.

571
00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:26.640
It's,

572
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:30.900
it's really fascinating and I've looked at they're processing it takes or it

573
00:36:30.901 --> 00:36:32.970
took them about five years to develop.

574
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:38.160
You can mix the protein in as little as four ounces without any clumps or issues

575
00:36:38.161 --> 00:36:41.280
of mixed ability whatsoever,
and they nailed the taste of the tested.

576
00:36:41.281 --> 00:36:42.114
For instance,

577
00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:46.590
the chocolate version 282 different versions of it,

578
00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:51.610
a lot of money and a lot of time into r and d for this particular product.

579
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:55.950
If you love coffee,
they also have a brand new cappuccino flavor,

580
00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:58.380
which is a variation I've enjoyed.

581
00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:02.790
If you prefer to test something outside of the traditional vanilla or chocolate

582
00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.130
and they have both way and my seller casing,

583
00:37:05.131 --> 00:37:10.131
so if you want to say improve body composition and recovery overnight slow

584
00:37:10.491 --> 00:37:14.310
release,
you can take to my seller Casein for,
in my case with whey protein,

585
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:18.210
I would take postworkout for instance,
four in the morning,
so check it out.

586
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:19.560
