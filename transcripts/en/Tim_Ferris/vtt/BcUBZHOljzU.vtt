00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.041
Hey,
what's up everybody?

2
00:00:01.041 --> 00:00:03.680
This is Pat Flynn from smart passive income.com and the smart passive income

3
00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:04.514
podcast.

4
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.940
I wanted to create this video for Tim and for all of you out there who are going

5
00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:11.600
to be starting your podcast very soon specifically to teach you how to record

6
00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:13.310
and edit using garageband.

7
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.880
Now if you aren't going to be using garage band because maybe you're a PC user

8
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.870
or you might prefer something else like audacity or Adobe audition,
that's okay.

9
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.710
Most of those pieces of software all work the same way and this video will still

10
00:00:24.711 --> 00:00:27.920
be extremely helpful for you because I'm going to show you how to be incredibly

11
00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:31.820
efficient when piecing your show together because hopefully you'll just be doing

12
00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:34.100
more than one episode.
Now before we get started,

13
00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:36.620
I got some housekeeping things to take care of that's going to make your life so

14
00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:37.700
much easier down the road.

15
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.610
So let's dive right into my computer and I'll show you what's going on.

16
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.080
<v 1>All right,
so here you're on the white board,
which is where I'll do.</v>

17
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.000
I'll be doing some instruction here for Ya.

18
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.390
Let me just say what's up to all of Tim's Fam,
what's up Tim's fans.

19
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.220
Now when creating an episode,

20
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.280
there are some people out there who have the ability to complete an entire show

21
00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:55.840
in one full session,

22
00:00:55.841 --> 00:00:59.410
meaning their intro and outro music and even their interviewers sort of recorded

23
00:00:59.411 --> 00:01:03.210
live.
And I'll pleat piece together in one moment and by the end of that their

24
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:04.180
episodes is ready to ship.

25
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.660
I am not one of those people and most of you probably aren't either.

26
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.200
And I found it very convenient to think of a podcast episode,
sort of like a,

27
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.220
like a movie that's made up of different parts that when put together just

28
00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:17.920
create sort of a seamless show.
And that's how I want you to think about it.

29
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.700
So I'm going to talk about the different kinds of files are the different pieces

30
00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:22.534
of your show,

31
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.960
parts of your show that you can potentially have all recorded separately and

32
00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:27.010
pieced together.

33
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.670
So the first thing you want to think about having is something like a pre roll.

34
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.170
A Pre roll is a unique identifier for each particular episode.
So,
for example,

35
00:01:35.171 --> 00:01:36.460
it might sound like,
Hey,
what's up?

36
00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:40.420
This is Pat Flynn and welcome to episode 108 of the smart passive income
podcast.

37
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.060
And that is very useful for people because a,

38
00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:45.940
if they've listened to that episode before,
they'd probably know,
you know,

39
00:01:45.941 --> 00:01:49.840
it's good to have order to all of your episodes.
But secondly,
you know,

40
00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:53.620
it gives good identifier for people if they want to share it or reference it

41
00:01:53.621 --> 00:01:57.580
later.
Now that is typically followed by the intro music,

42
00:01:57.581 --> 00:02:00.610
which is always good to have.
Not Everybody has ensured music,
but that's okay.

43
00:02:00.611 --> 00:02:03.470
You could choose and that's [inaudible].
These are really bad notes,
but,
um,

44
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.740
you could choose to have music if you'd like.
That's up to you.

45
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.360
And the music is typically followed by your intro,
your sort of,
uh,
what,
you know,

46
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.691
again,

47
00:02:10.691 --> 00:02:15.010
a unique sort of introduction or welcoming for each particular episode after the

48
00:02:15.011 --> 00:02:19.330
music.
And this is actually really important because this,
this within,

49
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.060
typically the first minute will be the deciding factor,

50
00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:23.380
whether people stick around or not.

51
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.660
And in that intro you want to give all the juicy sort of teasers that you can to

52
00:02:28.661 --> 00:02:30.880
make sure people continue to listen on.

53
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.190
Cause if you don't give them something to look forward to there,

54
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.400
they're just gonna,
they're just going to leave.
Now if you do have interviews,

55
00:02:36.401 --> 00:02:40.900
this is typically were a,
you'd put the interviews and a five,

56
00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:44.590
then you might do sort of a unique,
uh,
post roll,
you know,

57
00:02:44.591 --> 00:02:45.790
something to end the show.

58
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.540
Typically you want to put a call to action in there as well.
And then six,

59
00:02:49.541 --> 00:02:51.130
I didn't give myself enough room,
uh,

60
00:02:51.131 --> 00:02:55.510
the outro music and now each of these different things can be different files

61
00:02:55.511 --> 00:02:58.000
that you could sort of plop together in a timeline.
And Michelle,

62
00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:00.970
you had to do that in the next segment.
But before we do that,

63
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:04.990
I want to talk about some specific types of files that you should have handy so

64
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:07.810
that when you do open garageband or whatever editor you use,

65
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.470
it'll just make it incredibly easy for you to find him.
All right.

66
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:14.800
So right now you're looking at a sample podcast folder and I think it goes

67
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:18.250
without saying that you should obviously have your own dedicated folder for your

68
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:19.084
particular show.

69
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.020
But the way you organize those folders within that podcast folder is really

70
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:26.080
important.
So let me go over how I organize the folders.

71
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:29.320
And this is again for maximum efficiency in organization.

72
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.590
So first you can see here obviously a folder for all the episodes.

73
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:35.140
So every time you create a new name,
a new episode,
they get saved in there.

74
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.820
There's one for all of the graphics that you have from your cover art to you

75
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:40.421
know,
anything that,

76
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:43.930
anything promotional for your podcast as well that goes in there.

77
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.210
You also want to have a folder for all of your recorded interview.

78
00:03:47.211 --> 00:03:50.590
So whatever recording software you use,
plop them in there.

79
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.450
And then also I like to have a folder for screenshots because you're going to

80
00:03:54.451 --> 00:03:56.950
want to take record of,
of uh,
you know,
the high rankings,

81
00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:58.360
you get an iTunes and elsewhere.

82
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.760
Now let's look at these master files really quick.

83
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:02.620
This is what's going to save your life.

84
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.430
Having master files incredibly an easily accessible for you each time you create

85
00:04:07.431 --> 00:04:08.021
a new episodes.

86
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:13.021
So you can see here I have three master audio files here which will be easy to

87
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:17.740
drag and drop into your timeline.
So I can I,
I have one for your intro.
Uh,

88
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.660
you can have one for your outro as well.

89
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:23.440
And then if you have any audio transitions in between different segments of your

90
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:25.990
show,
you can have them in there as well.
And to keep it easy,

91
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:29.260
I just have them with a little dash in front and all caps so that they're easy

92
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:29.950
to find.

93
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.010
The dash just puts them at the top when they're putting in alphabetical order.

94
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.810
Now you'll also see a master episode template here.

95
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.630
This is my garage band master episode template.

96
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.050
And this is important because it's a file that you create that you'll open up

97
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.400
each time you record a new episode that will already be set up with all the

98
00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:50.590
proper track names and settings for your show.

99
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.760
This way you don't have to start from scratch with each new episode and mess

100
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:55.720
with the settings each time.

101
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.620
So let's get into garage band right now and I'll show you how to set up your

102
00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:03.160
master template.
And then after that I'll go over a sample episode with the USO.

103
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:06.130
You can see just how easy it is to piece your entire show together.

104
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.250
Okay?
So as soon as you open garageband,

105
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.850
you're going to be asked to create a new project.

106
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.780
Now this is the OSTP mavericks version is going to be new versions in the future

107
00:05:17.781 --> 00:05:20.660
and you might be using an older version of garage band.
Either way,

108
00:05:20.661 --> 00:05:23.780
you're going to be creating your master template file the same exact way.

109
00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:28.250
So open up an empty project and hit choose and then you'll be asked sort of what

110
00:05:28.251 --> 00:05:30.320
are you going to do with your particular file.
Now again,

111
00:05:30.321 --> 00:05:32.210
remember garageband was mean for musicians.

112
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.900
So there's a lot of instrumental things going on here.
We don't need that.

113
00:05:35.901 --> 00:05:39.290
You just want to record using a microphone and just make sure the input is on

114
00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:42.100
input one.
Typically,
unless you're doing something different,
uh,

115
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.190
it's going to be on input one.

116
00:05:43.191 --> 00:05:46.460
If you're using the line in on your Imac or your Mac book pro.

117
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.940
So I'm just going to hit create to start our master template file.

118
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.380
Now here's the interface that you're going to be familiar with down the road.

119
00:05:54.381 --> 00:05:56.960
I'm not going to go over every single bit and piece of,

120
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.790
but I am going to give you some specific things to do right and immediately

121
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:03.740
after you start this file again,

122
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:07.970
this is to make it podcast friendly because typically a musicians are using this

123
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:08.804
software.

124
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.830
So the very first thing you want to do is turn off the metronome and that can be

125
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:17.000
found here on the right hand side.
It looks like a cowbell.

126
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.150
You know we need more cowbell but not when you're recording a podcast episode.

127
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.160
What this is is a,

128
00:06:21.161 --> 00:06:24.990
it keeps time for those musicians that are out there using this software,
but we,

129
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.660
we don't need that.
So we're going to turn that off.

130
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.920
We're going to also turn off this count in which is sort of a pre sort of four

131
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:33.020
counts before you start recording.
We don't need that.

132
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.010
The last thing you want to do is also change the sort of uh,

133
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:40.370
led area here from beets to time.

134
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.270
So you want to show the time because you want to know sort of how long your

135
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:48.260
recording and sort of what time you're at in different parts of the show.

136
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.810
We don't need to know what bar or measure we're in.

137
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.510
So those are the first two things.
If you're not using this version,

138
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.810
you can look around in the settings to change.
Again,
turn off the metronome,

139
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.890
turn off the counting and change from beets to show time.

140
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.760
So those small little setting changes is actually a really helpful for you.

141
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.360
So you could actually save this master template file right now if you'd like.

142
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:09.020
However,

143
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.900
there's a few more things we're going to do with the tracks to make our life

144
00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:16.670
easier so that we'll know when we drop in or audio files exactly what's going

145
00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:19.010
on.
So let's organize our tracks here.

146
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.240
You'll see one track here called audio one.
We're going to add more tracks,

147
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.460
specify them for different parts of our show,

148
00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:27.890
which will make it easy to drag and drop them in later.

149
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.790
So let's do that right now.
So we're actually going to rename audio one,

150
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.690
two our pre roll.
So if you just double click this,
you can change the name.

151
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:39.140
So we'll make that pre roll and then we're going to add a new one by clicking

152
00:07:39.141 --> 00:07:40.070
this plus button.

153
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.330
And we're just going to make it the same sort of microphone line input audio

154
00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:45.164
file.

155
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:50.330
And then I'm gonna rename that one to be intro music.

156
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:52.851
And uh,

157
00:07:52.851 --> 00:07:55.490
I'll just fast forward through all this so that you'll see them all when they're

158
00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:56.750
done.
All right,

159
00:07:56.751 --> 00:07:59.600
so here you are with our tracks already laid out and I'm going to go down the

160
00:07:59.601 --> 00:08:00.530
list for you really quick.

161
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.280
But before that I want to reiterate why this is important to organize your file

162
00:08:04.281 --> 00:08:06.160
this way.
It's important because you know,

163
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.650
for one it just makes it easy to organize and to know where things go and you're

164
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.500
dragging other files into the,
into its place here.

165
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.530
But it's also important because in the future if you ever want it to change

166
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:18.260
anything out,
it would be incredibly easy for you.

167
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:22.640
Or if you go Tim Ferriss style of Va to come in and do it for you.
For example,

168
00:08:22.641 --> 00:08:25.730
if you want to change the intro music or you've changed it later and you want it

169
00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:28.010
to make it cohesive from episode one,

170
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.540
you can come into your older episodes and just interchange the music here or

171
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:37.160
maybe you're adding or taking out or changing advertisers down the road.

172
00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:40.070
If you had a track for advertisers,
you could do that.

173
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.180
Now we get these lists of tracks here,
this list here,
it's,

174
00:08:43.181 --> 00:08:44.330
it's just a recommendation.

175
00:08:44.331 --> 00:08:47.840
You can add your own tracks if you have other things you could subtract tracks.

176
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.380
It's up to you.
Now,
let me go down the list really quick.
You have your pre roll,

177
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.720
your intro music,
your introduction,

178
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.460
and then you'll see two different interview tracks.

179
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.300
The purpose of that is one track for your voice and one track for the person

180
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:02.910
you're interviewing.
And the reason you want to separate those tracks,

181
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:04.320
and I'll show you how to do that in a second,

182
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.800
but the reason you want to have them separated here is because sometimes the

183
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:08.730
people you interview,

184
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:12.330
they don't have the best audio quality or their levels might be too high or too

185
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:16.560
low.
You can adjust them here to match yours so that it's just a seamless sort of

186
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.420
audio experience going through your show.

187
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.230
Then you also have your post role and your outro music as well.

188
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.050
Another thing you could do to make your life easier is if you know that your

189
00:09:25.051 --> 00:09:28.350
intro music is going to be the same in every single episode that you have,

190
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.550
you might as well include it in your master template file to drag and drop any

191
00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:35.010
audio file into your timeline in any track here.

192
00:09:35.011 --> 00:09:36.240
I'm gonna show you how to do that right now,

193
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.480
so open up your find your finding audio file doesn't have to be an MP three you

194
00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:41.340
could be like a wave or an aiff.

195
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.640
You can drag it and drop it right into that particular track.

196
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:46.350
So this is the intro song.

197
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:50.220
So I'm gonna put it into this track here and you know for your template file I

198
00:09:50.221 --> 00:09:53.370
wouldn't worry about where it is cause you can move it around later if you'd

199
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:56.520
like.
But I'm just going to a habit there and you know,

200
00:09:56.521 --> 00:09:58.260
I'll play it for you just really quick so you can hear it.

201
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.680
Welcome to the smart passive income podcast and that's it.

202
00:10:04.681 --> 00:10:07.020
So you could see it going across this timeline.

203
00:10:07.021 --> 00:10:10.950
It's made up of different wave forms and you can even move and shift this into

204
00:10:10.951 --> 00:10:13.200
different tracks if you'd like.
It's really easy and intuitive.

205
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.070
But for now I've done all I can to prepare my master template file.

206
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:21.870
So what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to click file and save as,

207
00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:27.480
and I'm going to name this,
uh,
the Dash a master episode templates.

208
00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:31.510
So it will always be at the top and hit save.
And congratulations,

209
00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.340
you have your master template file,

210
00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:36.280
the file that you're going to open every time you record a new episode.

211
00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:41.440
The most important thing to remember is when you open this file to save as the

212
00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:44.410
new episode that you're recording or else you're going to forget and you're

213
00:10:44.411 --> 00:10:47.440
going to overwrite your master template.
So that's it.

214
00:10:47.441 --> 00:10:51.550
Now let's a reopen this file and do just that and then record our first session

215
00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:54.910
together and actually really quick,
let's fix just a couple more things.

216
00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.620
Let's highlight the pre-roll.

217
00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:01.480
Let's move back to zero and a we could turn off the library by clicking on this

218
00:11:01.481 --> 00:11:04.900
button here to give us more room and then let's save it again.

219
00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.920
That way when we reopen it,
it'll look just like this.
Okay,

220
00:11:08.921 --> 00:11:12.370
so when you reopen Garageband,
you'll see the same screen as before.

221
00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:16.480
You can actually go to your recent files and open the file from there or you can

222
00:11:16.481 --> 00:11:19.240
just go to your finder window and opening here as well.

223
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.870
All right,
and here we are back at the timeline.

224
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:27.050
Now what's the first thing we do when we open this template file?

225
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.600
We save as for this particular episode.

226
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.560
So I'm going to go into the episodes folder and create a folder that is named at

227
00:11:33.561 --> 00:11:35.540
zero zero one since this is episode one,

228
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.660
it's good to have a specific folder for each episode as well in case you want it

229
00:11:38.661 --> 00:11:42.320
to record different versions or you wanted to archive versions or whatever other

230
00:11:42.321 --> 00:11:44.660
things to go along with the episode.
It's just nice and clean.

231
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.670
And then I'm going to name this zero zero one.band band is just the garage band,

232
00:11:49.671 --> 00:11:53.620
a file extension.
And here we go.
Now we're all ready to record pre roll.

233
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:57.670
So I'm going to do that for you right now.
This intro song is here already,

234
00:11:57.671 --> 00:11:59.680
which is good but I'm going to move it out of the way cause we don't need it.

235
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:02.830
Now you can also mute it if you'd like it by clicking this mute button

236
00:12:02.831 --> 00:12:04.060
underneath,
which uh,

237
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:08.290
we turned to blue and I'm just going to make sure that the pre roll track is

238
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:11.320
highlighted.
And then when I press this red button,
it's going to record.

239
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.650
And then I'll,
whatever I say will be recorded into the episodes.
So here we go.

240
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:16.200
<v 2>Okay.</v>

241
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:16.831
<v 1>Hey everybody,
what's up?</v>

242
00:12:16.831 --> 00:12:21.831
This is Pat Flynn and welcome to episode one of the sample Tim Ferris podcast.

243
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.660
There we go.
We're done.
Now let's listen to it.

244
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.050
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

245
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:28.681
<v 1>Hey everybody.
What's up?</v>

246
00:12:28.681 --> 00:12:33.681
This is Pat Flynn and welcome to episode one of the sample Tim Ferris podcast.

247
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:39.720
Now did you know this,
that click sound for my mouse at the end?

248
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.640
We obviously don't want that in there,

249
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.820
so I'm going to move the sort of timeline cursor here a little before the end

250
00:12:47.491 --> 00:12:50.670
and you'll sort of see where you're speaking based on where these wave forms
are.

251
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:55.910
And I'm going to hit command t that splits that track at that point in time,

252
00:12:56.281 --> 00:12:59.490
and you'll see it's highlighted and I can just hit delete and it goes away.

253
00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:00.660
So now let's listen to it again.

254
00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:01.710
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

255
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:02.341
<v 1>Hey everybody.
What's up?</v>

256
00:13:02.341 --> 00:13:07.341
This is Pat Flynn and welcome to episode one of the sample Tim Ferris podcast.

257
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:10.790
Boom.
I'll get to go now.

258
00:13:10.791 --> 00:13:15.230
Let's unmute the master intro and I'm going to scoot it over back here and you

259
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.840
again,
you'll be able to see where everything lines up.
Again.

260
00:13:17.841 --> 00:13:21.140
Remember that graph I made sort of pretending it's sort of like a movie that,

261
00:13:21.141 --> 00:13:22.730
well,
this is where all the magic happens.

262
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:25.010
So now we're just going to test it a little bit.

263
00:13:25.011 --> 00:13:28.010
You can just click around and see how it sounds,
and again,
I can make it,

264
00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.380
you know,
I can shift it around if it doesn't sound good,
but let's,

265
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.540
let's play it Ferris podcast.

266
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.350
Welcome to the smart.
Sounds good.

267
00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:40.610
Now if I want to get a bigger overview of what the show looks like as far as a

268
00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:42.530
timeline,
I can use the horizontal zoom here,

269
00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.240
sort of a zoom out just to get more of an idea of what room I have.

270
00:13:46.241 --> 00:13:48.950
And of course it only goes up to a minute now because we haven't recorded

271
00:13:48.951 --> 00:13:49.401
anything else,

272
00:13:49.401 --> 00:13:53.360
but I'm gonna do more right now and you'll see it just go up over time.

273
00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.880
But next I'm going to record the introduction now,

274
00:13:55.881 --> 00:13:59.960
making sure the introduction track is highlighted.
I'm going to your recording,

275
00:13:59.961 --> 00:14:04.961
you'll hear the episodes intro before I record and that's there to help me.

276
00:14:05.391 --> 00:14:05.631
Again,

277
00:14:05.631 --> 00:14:08.840
I don't want to meet that because I want to know exactly when it's time to come

278
00:14:08.841 --> 00:14:09.950
in.
So I'll again,

279
00:14:09.951 --> 00:14:14.300
I'll do a very short truncated intro for you because this is just a tutorial a,

280
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.990
but you're just check it out.
I'm gonna hit record right now.

281
00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:24.290
What's up everybody?
Pat Flynn here.
Thank you for coming on to today's episode.

And at the end make sure to catch this,
this and that.
Boom.

284
00:14:32.901 --> 00:14:35.360
Here we go.
Here's the interview with Tim Ferriss.

285
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:37.000
<v 2>Okay.</v>

286
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.680
<v 1>And stopped it.
And uh,
there we go.

287
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:43.520
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

288

<v 1>Hey everybody.
What's up?</v>

289
00:14:44.121 --> 00:14:49.121
This is Pat Flynn and welcome to episode one of the sample Tim Ferris podcast.

290
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:51.980
Welcome

291
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.980
<v 3>to the smart passive income podcast where it's all about working hard now so you</v>

292
00:14:57.201 --> 00:14:59.810
can sit back and reap the benefits later.

293
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.510
Now your host who cannot wait for football season and start again,

294
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:08.420
Pat Flynn.

295
00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:14.040
<v 1>What's up everybody.
Pat Flynn here.
Thank you for coming on to today's episode.</v>

296
00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:18.870
I appreciate you guys,
Blah Blah Blah,
and today's episode,
so on and so forth.

297
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:22.680
Don't miss it.
And at the end make sure to catch this,
this and that.
Boom,

298
00:15:22.681 --> 00:15:25.140
here we go.
Here's the interview with Tim Ferriss.

299
00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:26.310
<v 2>Okay.</v>

300
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:27.143
<v 1>And we're done.</v>

301
00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:32.190
Now I'm going to a zoom in here a little bit so I could see the end and just so

302
00:15:32.191 --> 00:15:35.370
I can make sure to get rid of any clicks that might be there.
So again,

303
00:15:35.371 --> 00:15:39.960
command t delete.
And again,
that's kind of how the show is put together.

304
00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.690
Now let me give you some tips as far as the interview is concerned.

305
00:15:42.691 --> 00:15:44.640
I'll drop the interview track.
Uh,

306
00:15:44.641 --> 00:15:47.170
I did an interview with Tim Ferriss a while back.
Um,

307
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:49.440
and I'll just sort of put that in here.

308
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:52.660
I'll add the post's role and outre music and then we'll be done.
Uh,

309
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.380
and then I'll show you some tricks for exporting and making sure everything is

310
00:15:55.381 --> 00:15:56.220
leveled off as well.

311
00:15:56.221 --> 00:16:00.720
But let me go into the interview folder really quick just to give you some tips.

312
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.580
As far as the interviews that you're capturing.

313
00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.970
If you're using call recorder for Skype,

314
00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.300
this is a tool by he cam.

315
00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.330
You'll see that the episodes that you recorded,

316
00:16:12.331 --> 00:16:15.330
the interviews that you recorded actually movie files and the reason it's a

317
00:16:15.331 --> 00:16:20.220
movie file is because you know you could record a movie.
You know the,

318
00:16:20.221 --> 00:16:23.460
the the what's on the screen if you're actually seeing video,

319
00:16:23.461 --> 00:16:24.910
but since it's audio it's,

320
00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:28.680
it's a movie file but it's just audio and you could actually change this to an

321
00:16:28.681 --> 00:16:33.150
MP three directly from the tools that he cam and call recorder provides you

322
00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.110
right here in your finder by right clicking and go to open width.

323
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:41.820
Now you could just convert this directly to an MP three it turns it into an MP

324
00:16:41.821 --> 00:16:44.520
three file and then you could drop it in a timeline in one track.

325
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.820
But I like to split movie tracks.

326
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:50.550
They're split size the conversation or split move we tracks.

327
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:55.320
I just found that split movie tracks is just a better as far as the Vr is the

328
00:16:55.321 --> 00:16:56.310
quality that comes out.

329
00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:00.840
So I'm just going to click split movie tracks and it'll take a little bit of

330
00:17:00.841 --> 00:17:01.261
time,

331
00:17:01.261 --> 00:17:05.460
but you'll see in just a moment that you'll see track one and track two show up.

332
00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:08.181
Okay.

333
00:17:08.181 --> 00:17:11.960
Now one of these tracks is actually my voice and the other track is Tim's voice.

334
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:15.470
Now here I'm going to do the same thing except turn it into an MP three.

335
00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:19.550
So now I'm turning each side into its own MP three which I'll then drag and drop

336
00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:20.540
into the timeline.

337
00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:25.010
So I'm going to open with convert to MP three the latest version.

338
00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:26.210
This is track one.

339
00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:26.980
<v 2>Okay.</v>

340
00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:28.330
<v 1>Takes a little bit of time,
but you know,</v>

341
00:17:28.331 --> 00:17:30.790
I'll fast forward for the purposes of this tutorial.

342
00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:39.771
All right.

343
00:17:39.771 --> 00:17:43.670
And so now we have the Tim Ferriss interview track one in Tim Ferriss' interview

344
00:17:43.671 --> 00:17:44.630
track too.

345
00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.230
And I'm just going to shrink this down so I could show you how to drag and drop

346
00:17:48.231 --> 00:17:51.600
them in here.
And so we have track one.
Ah,
where'd it go?

347
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:52.750
<v 2>Okay,</v>

348
00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:56.140
<v 1>track one.
I'm just going to drag it right here</v>

349
00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.810
and it takes a while to convert,

350
00:18:01.811 --> 00:18:04.870
especially cause he's interviews sometimes go for several minutes,

351
00:18:04.871 --> 00:18:08.940
but just be patient.
Now I'm going to do track too.

352
00:18:08.941 --> 00:18:12.540
I'm going to make sure that the beginning is at the same point in time as the

353
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.710
other one that because again,
you want the conversation to be very natural.

354
00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:17.970
I mean if it's off a little bit,

355
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:21.180
somebody who's going to answer before somebody else finishes a question,

356
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.790
it's going to be weird.
It's happened before.
It's okay.

357
00:18:23.791 --> 00:18:27.060
You can always move these things around.
If you don't get it right now,

358
00:18:27.061 --> 00:18:30.240
just let me zoom in just to make sure.
Yep.
There at the same time.

359
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.820
And now I'm going to play the beginning of this.
Um,
however,

360
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:36.120
note that typically when I start recording these interviews,

361
00:18:36.121 --> 00:18:40.050
and this might be the case for you,
um,
I'm not recording at the very moment.

362
00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:44.490
We actually start the part that we want in the podcast and just might be small

363
00:18:44.491 --> 00:18:46.560
talk,
but I'm not going to play the whole thing for you.

364
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.810
I'm just going to play the beginning.
So let's hear what it sounds like.

365
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.860
All right,
I'm all yours.
Here we go.
Three,
two,
one.
What's up everybody?

366
00:18:52.861 --> 00:18:56.790
I'm so happy to welcome back Mr Tim Ferriss to the smart passive income podcast.

367
00:18:56.791 --> 00:18:59.100
What's up Tim?
How are you?
I am great.

368
00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:04.040
I'm enjoying wine and weather in San Francisco while it lasts.
All right,

369
00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:05.640
and that's it.
Now I'm just going to cut this short.

370
00:19:05.641 --> 00:19:09.300
So I'm going to highlight both of these click command t just to delete all of

371
00:19:09.301 --> 00:19:13.350
that because I want the tutorial if to be very short for you obviously,

372
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:15.180
but that's track one and track two.

373
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.970
And as I play these I could notice the different levels here.

374
00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:19.650
You'll notice that as I was speaking,

375
00:19:19.651 --> 00:19:23.010
you've probably seen this already or have noticed it cause it's the only thing

376
00:19:23.011 --> 00:19:24.390
moving on the screen.
Uh,

377
00:19:24.391 --> 00:19:29.391
but these levels sort of go up as the voice becomes louder and if they are in

378
00:19:29.881 --> 00:19:32.190
the red like for a very long time,

379
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:35.460
that's going to mean that the people listening it's going to crackle in their

380
00:19:35.461 --> 00:19:38.490
earphones or on their computer.
You don't want that to happen.
The,

381
00:19:38.491 --> 00:19:42.960
if the audio is in the yellow or maybe just a tad bit at the bottom part of the

382
00:19:42.961 --> 00:19:46.410
red.
That's good.
And you want both tracks to be there.

383
00:19:46.411 --> 00:19:48.600
Luckily Tim was on some good equipment,

384
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:52.940
which he's told you in this particular tutorial for the podcast as well.
Um,

385
00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.080
so there's no worries there.
But like I said before,

386
00:19:55.081 --> 00:19:59.000
sometimes people aren't on good equipment or their levels come out different.
Um,

387
00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:02.300
but I'm gonna show you a little trick,
even if you can't,
you know,

388
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.800
mess with the levels enough where it does.
Sounds good.

389
00:20:04.801 --> 00:20:07.410
There's a tool out there you can use to make the levels of,

390
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.420
of everything in your episode all the same.

391
00:20:09.421 --> 00:20:10.890
And I'll show you how to do that in just a sec,

392
00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.420
but let me just finish up here with the post roll and then I'll draft a drop in

393
00:20:15.421 --> 00:20:17.280
the outro music and then we'll export.

394
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:22.520
So I'm going to highlight post's role and I'm going to just come back a little

395
00:20:22.561 --> 00:20:27.150
bit so I can prepare myself Francisco while it lasts.
All right.

396
00:20:27.151 --> 00:20:30.390
I hope you enjoyed that interview with Tim Ferriss.
You can find him at,
um,

397
00:20:30.391 --> 00:20:32.280
all the places you all know where to find them.

398
00:20:32.281 --> 00:20:35.010
And you could find me at all the places you all know where to find me.
Thanks.

399
00:20:35.011 --> 00:20:38.310
And I'll see you in the next episode.
That was a terrible out-tro.

400
00:20:38.311 --> 00:20:41.220
Obviously you want to call to action,
you know,
subscribe to my email list,

401
00:20:41.221 --> 00:20:45.360
download my ebook here,
that sort of thing.
But again,
just for this tutorial.

402
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:49.170
And then the last thing I'm gonna do is plop in the outro music.
Uh,

403
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.230
so let's get the out true music here as well.
And again,

404
00:20:53.231 --> 00:20:56.680
I can move it around and I'm not even going to play it for you,

405
00:20:56.681 --> 00:20:57.880
but you kind of get the idea.

406
00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:02.380
So let me kind of zoom out here so you'll see exactly how this episode's laid

407
00:21:02.381 --> 00:21:05.980
out.
Pre-Roll,
the intro music,
the introduction,

408
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.400
the interview on two different tracks,
the post's role that I just recorded it,

409
00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:12.970
and then the outro music.
And there you go.
So that's the episode.

410
00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:17.560
So now what you want to do is click share an export song to disk.

411
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:20.330
And this is where you'll get a few different options.
Um,

412
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:24.370
I like to name this the same exact as it was before.

413
00:21:24.371 --> 00:21:26.140
Zero zero one and I want to do,

414
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:30.430
do it as an MP three just comes out a lot better as far as file size because

415
00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:34.040
again,
you're going to be doing a lot of these,
but you know,
you know,

416
00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:37.870
let's look at these qualities really quick.
You know,
medium or high is,
is okay.

417
00:21:37.871 --> 00:21:41.020
I mean typically if you're doing music,
highest quality is what you want,

418
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:45.280
but you know,
you have some music in your show typically.
So I mean,

419
00:21:45.281 --> 00:21:48.910
I usually do it at high quality and click export

420
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:54.740
and it's not going to take much time because this is a short episode and boom,

421
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.020
we're done.
So we'll see the file here.

422
00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:02.060
Let me go into episodes and then episode one you'll see the MP three file.

423
00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.740
And uh,
you know,
if I wanted to,

424
00:22:03.741 --> 00:22:05.540
I could play this and we could hear what it sounds like.

425
00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:07.890
<v 2>Okay.</v>

426
00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:08.521
<v 1>Hey everybody.
What's up?</v>

427
00:22:08.521 --> 00:22:13.521
This is Pat Flynn and welcome to episode one of the sample Tim Ferris podcast.

428
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:19.830
Welcome to the smart passive income podcast where it's all about,

429
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:20.530
<v 2>okay.</v>

430
00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:23.230
<v 1>And I'm not going to play the whole thing for you.
But that's,
that's the idea.</v>

431
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.710
Now the last thing I wanna give you is a tip for leveling.

432
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:27.850
Leveling out your show,

433
00:22:27.851 --> 00:22:31.990
meaning keeping the volume as loud as it can without crackling for all parts of

434
00:22:31.991 --> 00:22:32.824
your episode.

435
00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:36.850
Whether you don't come in with the best quality or your settings might be off,

436
00:22:36.851 --> 00:22:39.700
or maybe the person you're,
you've interviewed,
their settings are off.

437
00:22:39.701 --> 00:22:44.160
So I'm going to take you to a site called auphonic.
That's Auph oh nic.

438
00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:49.200
And I'll show you how that works.
Okay,
so here we are at a phonic Dotcom,

439
00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.530
a cool tool that I use after every episode just to make sure things are good.

440
00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.600
You know,
it reduces a lot of noise and hum,

441
00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:57.920
it makes all the loudness all normalized in the same,
you know,

442
00:22:57.921 --> 00:23:00.450
sort of balances the levels for everybody that listens to the show.

443
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.130
So let me show you how to use it really quick.

444
00:23:02.131 --> 00:23:05.930
I'm going to login and I'm use one password here.
Okay.

445
00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.860
And you'll see that I've done a number of episodes in the past already for a

446
00:23:10.861 --> 00:23:12.150
number of different shows that I've done.

447
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:13.920
Now I'm going to click on new production.

448
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.650
Now note that they give you at this point in time,

449
00:23:16.651 --> 00:23:19.950
at least two hours for free to do that.

450
00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.670
For some of you might only be two episodes,
but you know,
you could try it out,

451
00:23:23.671 --> 00:23:28.140
see if you like it.
Pricing is based on,
you know,
bulk purchases and you know,

452
00:23:28.141 --> 00:23:30.540
all that stuff.
I won't go over that right now.
But again,

453
00:23:30.541 --> 00:23:32.460
it's a really cool and handy tool that I use.

454
00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.170
It comes with a lot of features as well.

455
00:23:34.171 --> 00:23:38.820
You can even export your file after it goes through all that normalization stuff

456
00:23:38.821 --> 00:23:43.410
and,
and balancing with all the basic metadata that you want for your show.

457
00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.030
You can use this if you want for,

458
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.330
but I'm sure Tim or somebody else will teach you how to do that.
Um,

459
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.300
you don't need to do that.

460
00:23:50.301 --> 00:23:53.870
I just do it through iTunes specifically so I can drop my artwork in there and

461
00:23:53.871 --> 00:23:54.351
all that stuff.

462
00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:57.290
So I'm just going to use this just to normalize these particular episodes and

463
00:23:57.291 --> 00:24:00.530
I'll show you how to do the one we just did.
Somebody Click on choose file.

464
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.460
I'm going to go into our podcast folder,
click on episodes,

465
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.980
get that MP three file that we just got.

466
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.300
Click open and I'm just going to go down to the bottom and you know the default

467
00:24:11.301 --> 00:24:12.590
settings are already there.

468
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:16.940
And a hit start production and then hit start production again.

469
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:18.530
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

470
00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:20.900
<v 1>And you'll see it's not going to take that long because the files are really</v>

471
00:24:20.901 --> 00:24:24.500
short,
uh,
but it'll show you sort of a way for him and in,
in a,

472
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.900
in a place to download that particular episode.

473
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:35.440
And all right,
that episode is done.
Um,

474
00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:38.800
I'm going to click download just to download it to my computer and that's the

475
00:24:38.801 --> 00:24:42.910
main file you want to use as far as putting committed data in your cover art,

476
00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:46.510
upload to your server,
whatever server you end up using.
And then,
uh,
you know,

477
00:24:46.511 --> 00:24:49.420
having your RSS feed from your blog,
um,

478
00:24:49.421 --> 00:24:52.450
and then have it sent out to iTunes and everywhere else you have it.

479
00:24:52.451 --> 00:24:55.930
So before I let you go,
there's one final thing I want to say.

480
00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:58.980
<v 0>Thank you so much for watching this tutorial.</v>

481
00:24:58.981 --> 00:25:00.600
I really hope it was helpful for you.

482
00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.590
Now my final piece of advice for you is this.
Please,
please,

483
00:25:04.591 --> 00:25:09.000
with the information I just served with you,
please create a test episode first.

484
00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:10.570
Don't wait until your first interview.

485
00:25:10.571 --> 00:25:13.560
You don't wait until you record your first episode.
Do it now.

486
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.750
Record a 32nd conversation with a friend.

487
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:18.150
Put it through this process and see what it sounds like.

488
00:25:18.151 --> 00:25:21.900
Actually listen to that episode on your desktop,
on your laptop,

489
00:25:21.901 --> 00:25:24.910
and especially in your mobile device because most people are listening to

490
00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:26.190
podcast episodes on the go.

491
00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.850
Do that and you're gonna know exactly what to fix if it's not right and you're

492
00:25:29.851 --> 00:25:32.250
gonna make your life so much easier.
Thank you.

493
00:25:32.251 --> 00:25:33.690
And I'll see you at the top of iTunes.
