9
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.840
I used them to create book cover prototypes for the four hour body,

10

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.650
so it is brought to you by headspace.

20
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.860
More than 80% of the people I've interviewed,

21
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.060
world class performers across the military,
entertainment,

22
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.890
sports,
and beyond all have some type of meditative practice.

23
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.100
I tried for years and years and failed miserably.

24
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.120
The key is making it simple and you can dramatically improve your life in just

25
00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:36.980
10 minutes a day and technology can help you.

26
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.420
This change comes through guided meditation and headspace is by far the most

27
00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:45.800
popular app for this purpose.
More than 4 million users.

28
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.420
It's meditation made simple,

29
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.900
so what I recommend is that you take this practice meditation,

30
00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:52.760
which is rooted in thousands of years of tradition,

31
00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:57.761
supported by thousands of scientific studies and try it for 10 minutes a day for

32
00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:01.040
10 days.
That's all you need to do.

33

This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

43
00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:39.690
each episode,
it is my job to deconstruct a world class performer,

to tease out the habits,
routines,
tips,

operations commander and everybody in between this episode we have Alex Honnold.

48
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.700
I've wanted to interview Alex for a very,
very long time.

He is a professional adventure rock climber who's Free Solo.
That means no ropes,

52
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.931
no partner,

53
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:11.620
a sense of America's biggest cliffs have made him one of the most recognized and

54
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:13.450
followed climbers in the world.

55
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.750
If you want to sweat profusely from your poems,

56
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.540
you can watch videos of Alex and I'll put them in the show

Uh,

58
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.360
handled is distinguished for his uncanny ability to control fear while scaling

59
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:31.810
cliffs of Dizzying Heights without a rope to protect him.

60
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.910
And we really dig into that,

61
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.120
how he looks at risk fear addresses both in training and with these first ascent

62
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:40.924
attempts.
And so on.

63
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.100
His most celebrated achievements include the first and only free solos of the

64
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:49.810
moonlight buttress.
That's a five 12 d,
which means super fucking hard.
Ah,

65
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.710
that's 1200 feet in Zion National Park in Utah and the northwest face,

66
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:58.711
that's a five 12 a of halftone 2,200 feet and that is in Yosemite in California,

67
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.540
right in my backyard.
Beautiful spot.

68
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.410
In 2012 he achieved Yosemite's first triple solo climbing.

69
00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:09.910
That means in succession,
the national parks,
three largest faces,
Mount Watkins,

70
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:14.320
half dome and El Capitan alone and all in under 24 hours.

71
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.590
He is the founder of the Huddled Foundation and environmental nonprofit.

72
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:18.970
And to this day,

73
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.770
and perhaps one of the most fascinating aspects of Alex is he maintains a very,

74
00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:28.450
very minimalist dirt bag climber existence.
And that's not meant as a slight,

75
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.510
that is meant as a compliment living out of his van.

76
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.610
And I think he's done that for the last 10 years or so,

77
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.960
despite the fact that he has big sponsors and traveling the world in search of

78
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:41.470
the next great vertical,
adventurous.
We dig into all sorts of things.

79
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.990
And without further ado,

80
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.050
I will let you hear the wider Indian conversation that I had with Alex Honnold.

81
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.790
Alex,
welcome to the show.
Yeah,
thanks.
Thanks for having me.

82
00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.120
I have wanted to interview you ever since I first saw footage of you climbing

83
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.390
because I trained long ago at mission cliffs here in San Francisco and did top

84
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:11.350
roping,
never have climbed outside except for castle rock.

85
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:13.330
I don't know if you know yeah,
by Santa Cruz.
Exactly.

86
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:15.990
That's where I started as a kid,
kind of really where my local area.

87
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.000
So you grew up in Sacramento or am I making that up?
Yeah,

88
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:22.480
I grew up in Sacramento.
And what was your upbringing like?
I mean,

89
00:05:22.481 --> 00:05:26.620
if you had to describe your childhood,
how would you take a stab at it?
Uh,
just,

90
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.770
just normal suburban life.
You know,
Sacramento,
good times,
good times.
Sac Town.

91
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:31.960
I haven't spent a lot of time.

92
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.190
I mean Mark Bell who's a buddy has a gym called Super Training Gym up there.

93
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:39.430
He's,
I think one of the top 10 in his weight class of all time.

94
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.150
That is the extent of my exposure to Sacramento is just hanging out with him and

95
00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:43.984
feeling really weak,

96
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.560
which probably would have been the experience if I'd gone climbing with you even

97
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:50.090
in the early days.
What did your parents do?
Um,

98
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.470
my parents were both teachers or professors.
What did they teach?

99
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.570
They taught language,
like English as a second language in French.
Where

100
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.520
<v 3>were your parents born?
In the US or are they elsewhere?
Um,
yeah,</v>

101
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:05.670
they were both born in the u s though mom was born,
took Polish immigrants.

102
00:06:05.671 --> 00:06:05.840
So that,

103
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.450
I mean she's born in the u s and she's American and her parents were actually

104
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:11.270
born here too,
but they were like 100% Polish,
like fresh off the boat.
So

105
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.420
how did you start climbing?

106
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.670
I know it's probably a story that you've told a million times,

107
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:18.530
but how did that begin?
Um,

108
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:21.770
my parents just read about a gym opening in Sacramento and I thought I'd like
it.

109
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:23.750
And so they took me to a climbing gym.
I mean,

110
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:24.980
just like you were saying to the mission cliffs,

111
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:27.620
like there was a comparable jasmine and uh,
Sacramento.

112
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:31.760
And so I went in there when I was maybe 11 and then just kept going all the
time.

113
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.300
What was,
what was the first day like?
Can you describe like,

114
00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:36.890
I honestly have no recollection.

115
00:06:36.891 --> 00:06:39.440
I was like an 11 year old and then I probably went to the gym,
you know,

116
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.140
three to five times a week from 11 to 18.
So it's like,

117
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:44.630
it all kind of blurs into one epic gym session.

118
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.910
Did you know in the early days of going to that gym that you had a

119
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:54.340
predisposition to it?
Um,
no,
not particularly.
I mean,
I loved climbing and I,

120
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.860
I loved going in there and just playing all the time and climate as much as I

121
00:06:57.861 --> 00:06:58.071
could.

122
00:06:58.071 --> 00:07:00.980
But I was never like gifted in the way that a lot of people are gifted rock

123
00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:04.280
climbers.
And you know,
I wasn't like winning the competitions or anything.

124
00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:09.020
I did some comps on and off throughout my teenagers.
And um,
I never won.
You know,

125
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.330
I was never,
I was never super strong,

126
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.420
but I just like loved climbing all the time.
Why do you think you didn't want,

127
00:07:15.421 --> 00:07:18.580
and I mean what will cause very strong,
strong,

128
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.850
strong meaning in what capacity?
Like I,

129
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.810
I like to dig into the details with the soap for example.

130
00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:25.430
I mean this is kind of getting into the nitty gritty,
but,

131
00:07:25.431 --> 00:07:27.590
so that's what this is about.
Okay,
here we go.

132
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.590
So Chris Sharma is like basically then the best climber in the world for the

133
00:07:30.591 --> 00:07:33.250
last 20 years.
And he was like my hero and I was a kid or you know,

134
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.870
he was one of the people I watched videos of and I was like,
that guy's the man.

135
00:07:35.871 --> 00:07:36.800
So he's from Santa Cruz.

136
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.760
He started climbing when he was 14 and when he was 15 he put up a route called

137
00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:43.250
necessary evil and outside of Las Vegas.

138
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.780
And it was like the first 14 c in the country.
So it's,

139
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.060
it was the hardest route in America.

140
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.000
And he did it after one year of climbing as a 15 year old.
I mean,

141
00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:52.970
that's like a prodigy.
I mean he was like freakishly strong from the get go.

142
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.960
He could just always pull on really smart because he had freakishly strong

143
00:07:56.961 --> 00:08:00.140
fingers.
He could do one arm pull ups off like anything.
And you're like,

144
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.230
that guy's gifted.
Um,
I was not that guy,
you know,

145
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.300
actually this season I tried to do that route necessarily equal this winter and

146
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.520
I totally fell about it.
She's like,
I still couldn't do it.
And I was like,

147
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:13.490
God damn.
I been climbed for 20 years and I like try pretty hard,
you know,

148
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:15.860
and I still just can't climb as well as he did after one year.

149
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.590
While I still can't climb as hard.

150
00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:20.960
Like I'm just not as strong as he was after one year.
I mean,

151
00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:23.420
there are plenty of things that I'm probably better at than he is,
you know,

152
00:08:23.421 --> 00:08:26.420
it's all relative technique and everything.
What would I,

153
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:30.260
what would some of those things be that you're better at?
Well,
I've actually,

154
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.140
I mean not to necessarily compare you to him.
You're very good at.

155
00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:36.060
He's never done in the Alpine climbing.
He's never really done any big wall on.

156
00:08:36.061 --> 00:08:39.560
And he's probably not super efficient logistically and um,
you know,

157
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:43.310
but he's very,
very strong and I'm just not strong like that,
but,
you know,

158
00:08:43.311 --> 00:08:44.420
but I do other types of climbing.

159
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.650
For those people who are not familiar with the world of climate,

160
00:08:47.651 --> 00:08:49.870
could you describe some of the different types?

161
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.670
So the Alpine big wall climbing is,

162
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.980
it's pretty complicated because it ranges from say indoor bouldering,

163
00:08:55.981 --> 00:09:00.540
which is probably the simplest thing you can possibly do.
Um,
to Alpine climbing,

164
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:03.570
you know,
a climbing in the Himalaya or climbing huge walls around the world.

165
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.680
And so that involves like ice and mixed climbing where you using ice tools and

166
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:11.670
crampons and that kind of gear.
And then,
you know,
there's big wall climbing,

167
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:14.340
which is basically climbing huge vertical rock where you're on the wall for

168
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:17.630
multiple days.
Um,
then there's,
I mean,

169
00:09:17.631 --> 00:09:20.520
there's just a ton of categories and the bouldering.

170
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:24.000
So for people who don't know what that is,
that's typically,
it's no ropes.
Yeah,

171
00:09:24.001 --> 00:09:27.930
it's unroped.
I mean an easy way to think of it as practice climate,
right?

172
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.820
You know,
basically practicing movement.

173
00:09:29.821 --> 00:09:34.190
So you're climbing maybe three or four meters,
maybe five Max,
you know,

174
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.230
but you're climbing small small heights that you're comfortable falling off and

175
00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:40.290
landing on a pad and you're basically just doing really hard physical moves.

176
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.420
It's actually an easy way to compare it as um,

177
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:46.530
to the running world between sprinting and ultra running or something like the

178
00:09:46.531 --> 00:09:50.220
spectrum of climbing ranges from short and superintendents to super,

179
00:09:50.221 --> 00:09:53.390
super long but obviously low intensity.
And I've,

180
00:09:53.391 --> 00:09:57.660
I've always been more of the low intensity long distance type of guy,
you know,

181
00:09:57.661 --> 00:10:01.080
where some people are just freakishly strong and you were attracted to that

182
00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:03.960
because of the,
the relative lack of strength there.

183
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.090
Was there something else that appealed to you about that?
Um,
I dunno,

184
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.800
I mean I think it might just be one of the things that I've sort of naturally

185
00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:13.070
gravitated towards the thing that suits me.
But I dunno,
I mean,

186
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.760
I think part of it is just that I've always loved climbing.

187
00:10:14.761 --> 00:10:18.690
I like doing a lot of rock climbing and so I've always been attracted to high

188
00:10:18.691 --> 00:10:21.780
volume.
I mean,
I liked it,
like take the roots in my guide book,
you know,

189
00:10:21.781 --> 00:10:23.250
it'd be like,
oh,
I climbed this and I climbed that.

190
00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:27.750
And so I like to climb a lot of roots.
So it's just,
yeah,
I mean I just,

191
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.860
I like climbing a lot.
It's certainly clear.
I,
uh,

192
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.630
I wonder what,

193
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.170
what do you think you were going to be or what did you fantasize about becoming

194
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.110
when you grew up?
When you're a kid?
I mean,

195
00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:43.590
as a kid I thought I was going to become an engineer or something,
you know,

196
00:10:43.591 --> 00:10:48.030
I just thought I'd have some normal job.
And um,
I mean when I was growing up,

197
00:10:48.031 --> 00:10:49.860
there really wasn't a professional climbing scene.

198
00:10:49.861 --> 00:10:52.320
Like you couldn't really be a professional climber cause the whole climbing

199
00:10:52.321 --> 00:10:55.320
industry hadn't really taken off and there weren't so many gyms and it was like

200
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:58.080
a different world.
So I never thought that I was going to be a climber.

201
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:02.240
I just thought that I'd have some random job.
You,
uh,

202
00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.940
now I'm going off the Internet here.
So that's,
that's a risky business.

203
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:10.610
But you ended up at one point at was a UC Berkeley.
Yeah.

204
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.840
Planning to be an engineer.
Yup.
What type of engineering?
Um,

205
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.950
I had applied for civil engineering.
I was,
yeah.
Why Civil?
Uh,

206
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.550
I mean basically one of my uncles was civil engineer.
I was just like,

207
00:11:20.551 --> 00:11:22.890
that's cool.
And I love,
I liked building things.

208
00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:26.700
And the idea of like building bridges or like big,
big projects like that.
I mean,

209
00:11:26.701 --> 00:11:30.720
it's appealing,
you know,
the idea of like constructing something.
Cool.
Do you,

210
00:11:30.721 --> 00:11:34.720
did you collect anything as a kid or do you I was way into Legos.
Legos.
Okay.

211
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:39.540
So this is like the old,
right.
So the kind of large structures,

212
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.940
large walls,
uh,

213
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.600
how long did you collect the Lego's for?
I mean,
do you have any idea?

214
00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:47.640
I'm not looking for timelines here,
but why?

215
00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:49.080
Don't know when I first started getting lagers,

216
00:11:49.081 --> 00:11:51.720
but probably when I was really small and then up until being a teenager,

217
00:11:51.721 --> 00:11:56.320
basically I had a ton of Legos.
Did you have any,
any like uh,

218
00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:00.400
I'm not coup de Gras is not the right expression here.

219
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:04.180
I'm looking for like your landmark pieces or anything that you remembered.

220
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.300
I like I had friends who built like the death star at a Lego's and that was like

221
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.360
the pinnacle of their Lego career.
No,

222
00:12:10.361 --> 00:12:15.361
I mean I think I had a few just epic Fords and like really cool pirate ships and

223
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:17.650
things.
Um,
no,

224
00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:22.390
but I never constructed anything that was like the culmination of my Lego Lego

225
00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:23.224
career.
I don't know.

226
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:28.060
Mean the thing is I think I took it almost as much pleasure and destroying the

227
00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:29.170
things afterwards,
you know,

228
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.080
cause you treat it like this elaborate city and then my sister and I would take

229
00:12:32.081 --> 00:12:34.870
like a golf ball or something and just like destroy it and be like,

230
00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:37.420
oh it's starting over.
It's more of the process of building.
And that was so fun.

231
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:41.670
And you have one sibling or do you have more than one older sister and older.

232
00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:46.720
How much older?
Two years older.
Do you talk to her much?
Yeah,
we're,
yeah,

233
00:12:46.721 --> 00:12:49.210
we're good friends.
Very shy.
Fairmount?
Yeah.
What does,

234
00:12:49.211 --> 00:12:53.980
what does she do professionally?
Um,
I dunno.
It's complicated.

235
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.210
It's basically just like makes the world a better place.
Um,
she's,
she,
uh,

236
00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.760
she's lived in Portland since you went to college there and she's like,

237
00:13:00.761 --> 00:13:04.450
Vegan has never owned a car.
She's like ultra are thirsty and um,

238
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.330
she basically does outdoor participation stuff with kids and uh,

239
00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.600
it's kind of like,
I don't even know.
She's basically getting like at risk.

240
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.990
It's like a work program for at risk youth or sort of,
I dunno.

241
00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.480
It's like a whole thing.
Yeah.
But over the years she,

242
00:13:17.481 --> 00:13:20.350
she's also been like a middle school teacher and she's done like,
you know,

243
00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:24.790
bike programs with kids and all kinds of,
you know,
wholesome things that make,

244
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.010
make the community better.
If you had to pick a fixed location and we'll,

245
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:34.000
we're definitely going to get to the van and everything surrounding that story.

246
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.590
But if you had to pick a place to park up in the u s for say five years,

247
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.680
yeah.
Let's just make it a five year timeline.
Where would,

248
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:46.510
where would you pick this point?
I don't know.
That's a tough,
that's tough.
But,
um,

249
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.590
I mean the obvious choices as a climber would be somewhere like boulder,

250
00:13:50.591 --> 00:13:54.040
Colorado or say Salt Lake or Flagstaff or any of the cities that are sort of

251
00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:57.070
know or Las Vegas actually places that are known as climbing hubs where you have

252
00:13:57.071 --> 00:13:58.480
great outdoor climbing all around them.

253
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.400
And I could see living in any of those places if I had to.
Um,
or like say,

254
00:14:03.401 --> 00:14:03.641
you know,

255
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:06.340
I got married to somebody that lived there or something crazy and I'm like,
well,

256
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.360
I could see,
I could see being happy in any of those cities.
Um,
the honesty,

257
00:14:10.361 --> 00:14:11.680
I love Portland too though.

258
00:14:11.681 --> 00:14:13.720
There's no real climb in there and it's not a great place to,

259
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:16.570
to live as a climber.
And the climate is terrible with too much rain.

260
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.670
But as far as progressive cities that go,

261
00:14:18.671 --> 00:14:22.060
it's like probably my favorite city in the country.
The voodoo doughnuts too.

262
00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.270
Unless your family know I've been there.
And I was like,
yeah,
you know,

263
00:14:25.271 --> 00:14:27.490
I didn't think it was that great though.
Not the best.
Yeah.
I was like,

264
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:29.740
I was a little underwhelmed.
Yeah.

265
00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.400
Could have been my blood alcohol content at the time.
But,
uh,

266
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.290
do you think,
so I want to talk about,
uh,

267
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:42.290
climbing and the ability to climb full time because you,

268
00:14:42.291 --> 00:14:43.750
you touched on I think a really important point,

269
00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:49.410
which is when you began climbing the prospect of becoming a professional climber

270
00:14:49.721 --> 00:14:52.340
just didn't really exist.
Right.
As a notion.
I mean,

271
00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:54.560
there were a handful of professional climbers when I started,

272
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:57.050
but it was like such a small,
there wasn't like a climbing industry.

273
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.430
It was really small.
Exactly.
Yeah.
And uh,

274
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.120
you have a reputation for,

275
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.460
or you're well known for living as,

276
00:15:07.461 --> 00:15:12.380
and this is a term I hadn't heard until I watched a documentary that Yvon

277
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.970
Chouinard was in a dirt bag.
So living as dirt bag climber,

278
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:20.420
can you describe that?
What does that mean first of all,

279
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:24.050
and what is your version of that?
Um,
well,
so I mean,

280
00:15:24.051 --> 00:15:27.470
I guess that just means somebody who is like a lifestyle climate,

281
00:15:27.471 --> 00:15:31.580
like someone who just lives to climb.
So it's like the full time on the road,

282
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:34.310
you know,
doing whatever it takes to be a climber,
I guess.
I mean,

283
00:15:34.311 --> 00:15:37.130
being a dirt bag isn't,
isn't a negative thing.
And the climbing community,

284
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.470
which is like,
oh,
that guy is committed to the cause.

285
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.680
And I'm sure there's the same kind of term for like the surf community or

286
00:15:42.681 --> 00:15:43.401
whatever else,
you know,

287
00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:46.490
people who just like live to go mountain biking or surfing or whatever,
you know,

288
00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:48.980
taking odd jobs and just like doing their thing just to,

289
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.770
to be able to do their sport as much as they can.
And it seems,

290
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:56.830
I remember years ago I chatted with Steph Davis when I was wearing on the four

291
00:15:56.961 --> 00:16:01.550
hour body.
It seems like a very semi monastic lifestyle.
I mean,
you're,

292
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:06.310
you're really dedicated.
Makes me think of like the marathon monks in Japan.
Uh,

293
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.760
but instead of,
you know,

294
00:16:07.761 --> 00:16:12.290
running every day you're climbing sort of this itinerant lifestyle.
Uh,

295
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.980
now you live,
do you currently you still live in a van?
Yeah,

296
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.620
I mostly live in my car,
but then I'm overseas a lot more now.

297
00:16:18.621 --> 00:16:20.120
And then when I'm traveling for work stuff,

298
00:16:20.121 --> 00:16:22.340
I got to put up in hotels or whatever.
But,
um,
but yeah,

299
00:16:22.341 --> 00:16:25.730
I mean I'm still focused in the van.
What kind of Van?
Well,

300
00:16:25.731 --> 00:16:26.870
I just sold my old man,

301
00:16:26.871 --> 00:16:29.420
so I lived in a van for nine years and then I just hold the two,

302
00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:31.220
one of my cousins cause I was just kind of over.

303
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.990
I felt like I sort of outgrew it.
Um,
and so now I have a,
uh,
dodge pro master,

304
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.690
which I can stand in,
which is a big,
big upgrade.

305
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.810
How telling my wife I'm like five 11.
What,

306
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.740
so how have you have you kitted out this van to be suited to your needs?

307
00:16:45.741 --> 00:16:48.440
So I actually just left it with a friend of mine who built it out while I was on

308
00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:52.100
an expedition to Patagonia this winter.
And so he just made it nice.
I mean,

309
00:16:52.101 --> 00:16:56.720
you know,
super nice bed and like a kitchen and good cabinetry and um,
you know,

310
00:16:56.721 --> 00:17:00.200
a refrigerator and um,
yeah,
I mean it's basically a really small apartment.

311
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.550
It's super nice and uh,

312
00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:08.320
the coming back to the industry.
So,
uh,

313
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.200
are there people who criticize the industry of climbing is sponsor influx.

314
00:17:14.751 --> 00:17:16.730
And the reason I bring that up is not because I'm critical,

315
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.980
it's because I've seen,
for instance,

316
00:17:18.981 --> 00:17:23.660
in the UFC and MMA when in the very early days it was,

317
00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:27.710
it was really unfeasible for people to be professional MMA athletes.

318
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:33.130
And as soon as sponsors came in and you had that sustainability,

319
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:38.920
the level of athleticism and training and competency just went completely

320
00:17:39.051 --> 00:17:43.760
through the roof.
Is,
is there something similar in climbing?
I mean,
do you feel,

321
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.770
how do you feel about the so called climbing industry?
I mean,
I think it's,

322
00:17:48.771 --> 00:17:51.800
I think great.
Um,
I mean there is obviously criticism.
I mean,

323
00:17:51.801 --> 00:17:54.560
you can find stuff online from it.
You can always find traditionalist and stuff.

324
00:17:54.561 --> 00:17:56.370
We were like,
this isn't the way it was when I grew up.

325
00:17:56.371 --> 00:17:58.440
So I don't think it should be this way or like,
oh,

326
00:17:58.441 --> 00:18:02.220
I feel like it's corrupting the art of climbing or whatever else.
You know,
the,

327
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:06.180
the having corporate money coming into the climbing world is,
is tainting the,

328
00:18:06.181 --> 00:18:08.160
the artistic experience.
I mean,
whatever.
I mean,
you know,

329
00:18:08.161 --> 00:18:11.760
you can find criticism for it.
Um,
I think it's great.
I mean,

330
00:18:11.761 --> 00:18:14.370
obviously since I'm making a living from it and I'm able to go climbing all the

331
00:18:14.371 --> 00:18:17.190
time,
you know,
I'm very content with the whole situation,

332
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.750
but mostly I just feel like it's sort of a natural outgrowth.
I mean,

333
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:25.050
climbing gyms are becoming much more popular because people enjoy climbing,

334
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.140
you know?
And so if people are into it and the industry is making money than,

335
00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:28.974
than power to it.

336
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:33.200
<v 2>Well it's,
it also strikes me as sort of a lot of self fulfilling prophecy,</v>

337
00:18:33.201 --> 00:18:38.150
but a virtuous cycle in so much as the more people see your exploits,

338
00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:42.560
Sharma people of that caliber,
the more they're inspired to try climbing,

339
00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.910
the better the gyms do,
the more classy.
I don't,
I do not think that's,

340
00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.390
<v 3>that,
that might be true a little bit.
But,
um,</v>

341
00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.210
I honestly think that part of it is just having the facilities,

342
00:18:52.211 --> 00:18:55.000
like the more good gyms there are in,
in urban centers,

343
00:18:55.001 --> 00:18:58.180
the more people just wind up trying it with their friends or whatever.
You know,

344
00:18:58.181 --> 00:19:00.490
when you have like a nice bouldering gym next to a college campus,

345
00:19:00.491 --> 00:19:02.680
like everybody tries it because it's fun,
it's sociable.

346
00:19:02.681 --> 00:19:05.890
Everybody has a good time and I feel like that sort of like grows the sport.

347
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:09.910
So the supply,
it helps create the demand to some extent.

348
00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:14.950
But I really doubt that any particular climbing film can be responsible for like

349
00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.450
growing the whole industry.
You know,

350
00:19:16.451 --> 00:19:19.120
it has more to do with tons of people like going to gyms and trying it and

351
00:19:19.121 --> 00:19:20.500
enjoying it and going more often.

352
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:21.901
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

353
00:19:21.901 --> 00:19:26.850
I guess it depends a lot on a multitude of factors.

354
00:19:26.851 --> 00:19:27.750
I mean with,

355
00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:32.751
not to Belabor the point or the comparison to the MMA world,

356
00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:37.920
but like the ultimate fighter was kind of the breakthrough for them and then led

357
00:19:37.921 --> 00:19:40.320
to a lot of gyms opening.
Yeah.

358
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:42.820
<v 3>I've never had anything quite that.
No,
totally.</v>

359
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.150
Like I don't follow a fighting and all by,

360
00:19:44.151 --> 00:19:46.390
I've even heard of ultimate fighter and that kind of stuff.

361
00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.270
And so I don't think climbing is really had that,
you know,

362
00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:53.160
there's no like big hit reality TV climbing show.
Yeah.
You know,

363
00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:54.980
the actually that there were,

364
00:19:54.981 --> 00:19:57.160
there have been a pitches with that kind of stuff though,

365
00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:58.293
which are pretty common.

366
00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:02.340
<v 2>Cool.
Well,
I'd love to see the actual,</v>

367
00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.500
it's aliens meets bouldering or like,
yeah,

368
00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.620
<v 3>there was an ultimate solo thing.
They got like pitch to me once and I was like,</v>

369
00:20:09.621 --> 00:20:09.831
dude,

370
00:20:09.831 --> 00:20:12.710
you can't just take random people off the street and like train them how to solo

371
00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:16.310
for six weeks and then just like set them off of a big wall.
It's like,
you know,

372
00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.820
I was like,
you may as well just have gladiators fighting vines in the pit.

373
00:20:19.821 --> 00:20:22.460
You know,
it's like people will literally die on your television show.

374
00:20:22.461 --> 00:20:26.200
Like you don't want people to,
I got TB like no,
no,
no,

375
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:29.240
that's exactly what we want.
I'm just like,
are you guys kidding?
You know,

376
00:20:29.241 --> 00:20:30.860
cause you have to ensure the show and everything.

377
00:20:30.861 --> 00:20:33.470
Like no one's going to make those because like half year contestants are going

378
00:20:33.471 --> 00:20:35.150
to die.
Like straight up.

379
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.730
<v 2>I messed up.
Yeah.
We'll have,</v>

380
00:20:38.731 --> 00:20:42.780
we'll have some beers sometime and talk about exploits and televisions.
But uh,

381
00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:43.260
when,

382
00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:48.130
when you are getting ready to climb something that

383
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.090
<v 3>is going to be challenging.</v>

384
00:20:49.091 --> 00:20:52.390
I'm not saying like a first descent or something like that,
but it really,

385
00:20:52.391 --> 00:20:55.630
anything that you're expecting to be reasonably challenging.

386
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.930
What is your self talk sound like?
What is your,

387
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.420
do you have any sort of prep,
anything you,

388
00:21:01.421 --> 00:21:05.760
ritual ritualistically said to yourself before you get going?
No,

389
00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:10.540
I don't really,
I don't self talk like that,
but I'm normally,

390
00:21:10.541 --> 00:21:12.570
if I'm planning on doing something challenging,

391
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:16.480
I spend the time sort of visualizing what the experience will feel like and what

392
00:21:16.481 --> 00:21:19.260
the individual section that is.
So I mean with climbing there's a,

393
00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.030
there's a component too of just memorizing the actual moves.

394
00:21:22.031 --> 00:21:25.060
So I think through the sequences and make sure that I remember like which foot

395
00:21:25.061 --> 00:21:28.680
to move in which order and like how to do everything.
And then,
um,

396
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:30.460
particularly if it's a free solo or something,

397
00:21:30.461 --> 00:21:33.670
if I'm climbing rope lists then I'll think through what it will feel like to be

398
00:21:33.671 --> 00:21:37.660
in certain positions because some kinds of movements or are insecure.

399
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.150
And so they're just like kind of scarier than other types of moves.

400
00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:44.800
And so it's important to me to sort of think through how that all feel when I'm

401
00:21:44.801 --> 00:21:47.440
up there so that when I'm doing it,
I don't suddenly be like,
oh my God,

402
00:21:47.441 --> 00:21:50.140
this is really scary.
You know,
like I know that it's supposed to be scary.

403
00:21:50.141 --> 00:21:51.220
I know that's going to be the move.

404
00:21:51.221 --> 00:21:52.930
I know what it's gonna feel like and I just do it.

405
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.350
So you rehearsed that fear in a sense or reverse the sensation,

406
00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.500
one type of which could be fear.
Yeah.
And I think through,
you know,

407
00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:03.130
how airy certain positions will feel because sometimes you can be all spread out

408
00:22:03.131 --> 00:22:05.080
with like the void below you and you're just like,
wow,

409
00:22:05.081 --> 00:22:07.270
this is like quite the quite the air around me.

410
00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.330
And so it's good to have like thought about that basically to think through all

411
00:22:10.331 --> 00:22:12.280
potential things beforehand so that when you're up there,

412
00:22:12.281 --> 00:22:15.190
there's no like unexpected thing that happens.
You know,

413
00:22:15.191 --> 00:22:18.940
we were talking earlier about this,
this,

414
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:24.010
this odd looking fellow.
The white bussed over on like counter,
who is,

415
00:22:24.011 --> 00:22:27.820
for those of you who don't have a visual is,
is Seneca the younger,
uh,

416
00:22:27.821 --> 00:22:30.460
which was a gift.
And of course those of you listeners,
podcasts,

417
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:33.790
lot know that I'm somewhat obsessed,
uh,

418
00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:37.690
compelled to read a lot of stoic philosophy and Marcus Aurelius and so on.

419
00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.230
Uh,
how would you describe your,

420
00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:43.123
<v 4>okay,</v>

421
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.490
<v 3>if you had to take a stab at it.
I know this is a hard question,</v>

422
00:22:45.491 --> 00:22:49.930
but you're just a general,
how does your philosophy or philosophies of,

423
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:53.790
of life and living differ from most people?
Uh,

424
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:58.540
I dunno.
I mean,
I've never really thought of any comprehensive lights,

425
00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:00.040
life philosophy or anything.
You know,

426
00:23:00.041 --> 00:23:03.220
I don't feel like I have a particular set of principles that I live by though.

427
00:23:03.221 --> 00:23:07.160
Um,
you know,
I suppose I'm pretty minimalistic and,
and,
uh,
you know,

428
00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.600
meeting a fairly simple life.
And I mean,

429
00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:13.040
I guess that's basically how I live.
I don't know.

430
00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:15.600
<v 4>Okay.</v>

431
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.380
<v 3>What are the benefits of living simply to you,
aside from the ease of travel?</v>

432
00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:22.320
But I would imagine at this point you could probably travel reasonably easily.

433
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.710
Well No,
I mean that's kind of it is that,
um,
yeah,
just the ease of living,

434
00:23:25.711 --> 00:23:29.040
you know,
basically it just cuts away everything except for what I wanted to be.

435
00:23:29.041 --> 00:23:31.860
I mean,
cause my,
my goal is basically to climb as much as I can.

436
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.410
And that's what I enjoy most in life is climbing.

437
00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:37.860
And so everything else to some extent is a distraction from that.
And so,

438
00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:40.240
you know,
I basically just cut away what I don't need.

439
00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:46.320
So I heard a story and this was a friend of a friend of a friend relaying

440
00:23:48.201 --> 00:23:52.520
something they hit heard.
We'll see where this is like telephone.
Yeah,
exactly.

441
00:23:52.521 --> 00:23:54.410
So who knows?
But they,

442
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:59.680
they told this story about you free climbing and this is free so long probably.

443
00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:01.190
I'm sorry.
Yeah,
that's right.

444
00:24:01.191 --> 00:24:06.191
Free solving a big wall where at some point there was some people resting.

445
00:24:06.591 --> 00:24:09.560
I don't know if they're in a,
how'd he say it?
Bivouac a portaledge movie.

446
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:12.200
Portaledge the camp thing.
Right.
And uh,

447
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.200
and you kind of ducked your head around the corner.
We're like,
Hey,

448
00:24:15.201 --> 00:24:18.350
can I borrow some chalk?
And they're like,
ah,
sure.

449
00:24:18.351 --> 00:24:20.810
And giving some shock and then you're like,
thanks.
Great.

450
00:24:20.811 --> 00:24:23.330
And just kind of like continued on your merry way.

451
00:24:23.331 --> 00:24:25.580
Did has anything like that happened or is that just a no,

452
00:24:25.581 --> 00:24:28.610
so that is a real story sort of with some details.
Okay.
Can you,

453
00:24:28.611 --> 00:24:31.130
can you tell the story?
Yeah.
So I was um,

454
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:33.470
I was so long the triple link up and you somebody,

455
00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:36.620
so I wasn't free soloing but I was coming by myself so I had a little bit of,

456
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:39.260
I had a small rope and I had to got here because this is an important

457
00:24:39.261 --> 00:24:43.350
distinction,
so,
okay,
got it.
So solo climbing is just climbing by yourself.
Yeah,

458
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:46.370
the free soloing means that you're free climbing and free climbing means using

459
00:24:46.371 --> 00:24:49.820
your hands and your feet and not using gear.
And so if you're free soloing,

460
00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:52.280
it means that you're climbing with just your hands and your feet by herself.

461
00:24:52.281 --> 00:24:55.370
Like no gear,
no anything.
Got It.
But so in this case I was soloing,

462
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:59.510
so I had gear and I was,
so the three largest faces and you somebody in a day.

463
00:24:59.511 --> 00:25:02.210
So Mount Watkins,
which is like way up at one end of the valley.

464
00:25:02.211 --> 00:25:03.140
And I'd done that first.

465
00:25:03.141 --> 00:25:05.750
And then I came down and I was climbing the nose of Oak Habitat through the

466
00:25:05.751 --> 00:25:09.950
night and uh,
in the logistical shuffle and the darkness,
whatever,

467
00:25:09.951 --> 00:25:10.880
I forgot my chalk bag.

468
00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:14.030
So I basically climbing the first thousand feet of the nose without a chalk bag.

469
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.010
And it was like,
we just kind of a bummer.

470
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:20.690
I mean that's definitely not ideal and it actually rained a bunch of the day

471
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:22.700
before.
So like the bottom pitches,
which are lower angle,

472
00:25:22.701 --> 00:25:25.430
where like fairly wet and I was like constantly trying to dry my hands on my

473
00:25:25.431 --> 00:25:27.080
shirt and it was just all kind of scary.

474
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.490
And so I got up to this ledge called Bolt Tower,
which is,
you know,

475
00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:34.070
about a quarter of the way up the wall.
And,
uh,
there were two groups,

476
00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.830
if you don't,
the ledge.
And two of the people were just like passed out.

477
00:25:36.831 --> 00:25:38.180
And the other two guys were like cooking dinner.

478
00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.330
And so I popped over the one side of the ledger.
I'm like,
ah,
hey.

479
00:25:41.331 --> 00:25:46.020
So can I borrow a chalk bag?
And they were like,
I guess like,

480
00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:46.970
no problem.
You know,

481
00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.960
it's so what are the guys gave you this chalk bag that was like completely full

482
00:25:50.961 --> 00:25:52.940
of like fresh jock.
I was so stoked.

483
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:56.710
And then I took his chalk bag and then I climbed to the top of the root and a,

484
00:25:56.711 --> 00:25:59.000
and then I left it like tied to the tree on top and think I got it back.

485
00:25:59.001 --> 00:26:01.370
I met him again later.
And uh,
and yeah,

486
00:26:01.371 --> 00:26:03.320
so they got their chalk bag back like four days later.

487
00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:10.740
Do you have a particular type of chocolate you like?
No,
but I mean,
any chalk,

488
00:26:10.741 --> 00:26:13.580
it feels amazing when you've just climbed a thousand feet of wall,
you're wet,

489
00:26:13.581 --> 00:26:18.320
wet.
Uh,
what is,

490
00:26:18.321 --> 00:26:22.580
uh,
what's a story?
And I realize a lot of these questions are kind of out there,

491
00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:27.050
but what is a story that your,
your family or parents like to tell about you?

492
00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:33.480
Oh,
I dunno.
I'll buy us some time and let you think about it so well.

493
00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:38.270
So one that my parents like tell about me is I was completely infatuated with

494
00:26:38.271 --> 00:26:41.750
the incredible hulk when Lou Ferrigno was doing the TV show.
So I'd run into the,

495
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:44.220
into the living room when my parents said

496
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.610
<v 2>company and rip the cushions off of the couch and throw them on the floor and</v>

497
00:26:47.611 --> 00:26:48.690
yell like the Hulk and run out.

498
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:53.490
So my mom feels like that's in some way represents like me and my totality,

499
00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:59.020
which I don't know how to take,
but that's the story she likes to tell.
Uh,

500
00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:00.540
anything come to mind?

501
00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:02.390
<v 3>Um,
I dunno.
I mean,</v>

502
00:27:02.391 --> 00:27:05.690
mom likes to talk about how I always climbing on everything as a kid and how it

503
00:27:05.691 --> 00:27:09.890
was such a wild child.
But,
um,
though I honestly feel like she's kind of like,

504
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:14.620
she talks about that more now that I am an actual professional climber.
You know,

505
00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:15.890
I feel like had I become an engineer,

506
00:27:15.891 --> 00:27:19.160
she would instead focus on stories of like how I always love to play with blocks

507
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.800
or do whatever.
But,
um,

508
00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:25.220
in my whole family would always tell stories about how I was such a picky eater

509
00:27:25.221 --> 00:27:29.510
and how I'd only eat cheerios and bread and like whatever,
just things.
I Dunno.

510
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:30.990
But

511
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:35.550
<v 2>what do you,
we were talking just during the sound check about eating,
uh,</v>

512
00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:39.330
and I'd like to talk about that for a second.
Uh,

513
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:44.730
what is your typical breakfast look like
generally?

514
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.180
<v 3>Well,
so I've kind of gone through two main phases,
I guess.</v>

515
00:27:47.181 --> 00:27:51.140
I used to always do like an egg scramble for breakfast and now I pretty much

516
00:27:51.141 --> 00:27:54.290
always do some kind of Muesli concoction with like fruit and some kind of

517
00:27:54.291 --> 00:27:57.560
alternative milk stuff and like flax seed,
hemp hearts,
like random things,

518
00:27:57.561 --> 00:27:58.940
sort of like a wholesome Muesli mix.

519
00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:04.260
And then I asked you about lunch and do you have to say about lunch?
Yeah.

520
00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:06.740
So I,
I rarely eat a lunch per say.

521
00:28:06.741 --> 00:28:09.680
I've pretty much always just snack for the several hours in the middle of the

522
00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:14.330
day.
Um,
normally like a couple pieces of fruit and maybe some nut butter,
um,

523
00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.420
you know,
a bar or two or something.
And then I eat like a big dinner.

524
00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:20.000
I normally do a pretty big breakfast and pretty big dinner and then just snack

525
00:28:20.001 --> 00:28:23.480
throughout the rest.
Why?
Why no lunch?
Well,
the new lunch thing,

526
00:28:23.481 --> 00:28:26.510
it makes sense when you're up on a wall for the day or if you're like out at the

527
00:28:26.511 --> 00:28:30.350
cliff or it's just like a bunch of work to take a real meal.

528
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:35.550
<v 2>So I wasn't going to get to this immediately.
Uh,
this,
this early.</v>

529
00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:39.000
This is early for me.
I'm always in pasture.
So what was that?

530
00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:44.010
I that I'm always premature.
It's fun.
It's like my friend when he drives,

531
00:28:44.011 --> 00:28:47.400
we call him a premature accelerator.
But that's,
that's,
that's all separate story.

532
00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.670
Uh,
so this is from a friend of mine who's an elite athlete.

533
00:28:50.671 --> 00:28:55.650
Very high level female athlete.
I'll,
I'll ask her main question first.

534
00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.420
Actually,
no,
I'll ask the related question first.
So the food real hassle.

535
00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:04.140
So the core question was what happens if you have to take a shit on the side of

536
00:29:04.141 --> 00:29:08.160
a mountain?
Meaning like on so many good pooping stories.
Okay,

537
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.320
we can do a whole podcast on stories.
Well,
let's give them previews.

538
00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:15.060
That could be the round two.
But yeah,
let's,
I,
I mean,

539
00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.660
I was wondering why she brought it up.
I was like,
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

540
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:23.510
<v 3>It goes straight to my most epic dumps story.
Yes,
please.
Okay.
So like,
uh,</v>

541
00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:25.260
uh,
two years ago,

542
00:29:25.261 --> 00:29:27.960
I guess I was free soloing this root called romantic warrior and the needles,

543
00:29:27.961 --> 00:29:30.540
which is actually a super mantech warrior.
Yeah.
It's like,

544
00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:33.870
it's actually one of the most striking granite walls like in the world.

545
00:29:33.871 --> 00:29:36.990
This is totally beautiful route on this crazy spire.
It's,
it's an amazing,

546
00:29:36.991 --> 00:29:37.824
amazing route.

547
00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.230
It's something I've thought about for a long time and it's actually quite

548
00:29:40.231 --> 00:29:42.580
difficult.
And so I was going up there to free solo.

549
00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:45.790
It was like kind of a big thing for me and I was wasted out.

550
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.660
And typically when you get to the base of it free solo like that,

551
00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.840
if you have to poop at all,
like you have to go like,

552
00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:53.800
then you know when you're the base.
But I just like,
I dunno,

553
00:29:53.801 --> 00:29:57.790
it just didn't quite happen.
And uh,
and so I started climbing and that route,

554
00:29:57.791 --> 00:30:00.580
the first 400 feet or so,
or like pretty moderate train.

555
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:04.420
And then it goes into like some pretty extreme terrain for the second 400 feet.

556
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:08.740
And uh,
so basically right before I got into the real stuff,
I was like,
oh,

557
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.490
now we're really need to shit.
I was like,
Oh man,
you know,
basically I was like,

558
00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:17.580
oh,
it's about to get real up here.
And like I now I need to poop.
And so,
um,

559
00:30:17.581 --> 00:30:19.990
I basically hand traversed on this little feature.

560
00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.410
So the traverse off the root cause is really poor form to like shit on a root

561
00:30:23.411 --> 00:30:26.320
cause obviously people have to climb that introverts meaning you just travelling

562
00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:27.101
horizontally.
Yeah.

563
00:30:27.101 --> 00:30:31.030
So I sort of just like meandered to the left 20 feet and this flake that I was

564
00:30:31.031 --> 00:30:31.481
hanging off,

565
00:30:31.481 --> 00:30:34.660
it was like fairly big and I had a backpack on me with like my shoes and some

566
00:30:34.661 --> 00:30:37.030
water and some food,
random things that you kind of need for,
you know,

567
00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:39.760
going up along route like that.
And it had some tp in it.

568
00:30:39.761 --> 00:30:43.300
So I like shoved my backpack into the flake and I just like hung there off of it

569
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:45.220
and basically just took a poop like straight off the wall,

570
00:30:45.221 --> 00:30:48.850
just like wall hanging and then,
you know,
like wipe tidy it up.
It was all good.

571
00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.900
And then I put my pack back controversy I gave them and finish the root.

572
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:55.630
It's like,
so I just want to really dig into this just like it's so,

573
00:30:55.940 --> 00:31:00.360
so I'm just like envisioning,
I had bats,
uh,
I grew up on long island.

574
00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:03.220
We'd have these bats,
so would like crap off of the shingles and we'd be like,

575
00:31:03.221 --> 00:31:05.860
where the hell is that front?
And then we'd see the bat kind of perched there.

576
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.650
So what's the technique here?

577
00:31:08.651 --> 00:31:12.670
So you're hanging off this flake if your backpack shoved into it,

578
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:17.790
like legs straight and straddled like you don't like a mic.

579
00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.720
Did crouch,
you know,
pushing away from the wall,
but,

580
00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:23.500
and are you going like out of the bottom of your shorts?
He pulled them down,

581
00:31:23.501 --> 00:31:26.760
pulled my shorts down.
Just like anything.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah,

582
00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:30.430
I mean it's actually totally easy.
I mean,
I'd call it a space dumb spaced out.

583
00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:32.680
Yeah,
a client,
we would call it like a perfect space down.

584
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:35.710
It's just like taking a dump in a free space and it just disappears.

585
00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:42.220
So what are other challenges of climbing on big walls?

586
00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:46.750
I said I don't let that give the wrong idea because normally you try to like poo

587
00:31:46.751 --> 00:31:48.430
and better places,
you know,

588
00:31:48.431 --> 00:31:52.180
preferably a toilet or at least I barely get properly at the base or you know

589
00:31:52.181 --> 00:31:55.150
like being,
being responsible about it.
But like from time to time that happens,

590
00:31:55.151 --> 00:31:57.430
you know,
things happen.
What are other,

591
00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.650
what are other issues that crop up that people might not think of when you're

592
00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:04.030
doing these clubs?
Well,
people frequently ask like,

593
00:32:04.031 --> 00:32:07.150
what do you do if you have to pee or whatever.
Because they think,
I mean,

594
00:32:07.151 --> 00:32:09.630
I think that people have the wrong impression that free soloing a big wall.

595
00:32:09.631 --> 00:32:11.800
It's just like holding on for dear life the whole time.

596
00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.310
But they're actually all kinds of little ledges like even alleged the size of

597
00:32:15.311 --> 00:32:18.100
say a pizza tray is big enough for you to stand there comfortably.
No hands.

598
00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.950
Right.
And so,
I mean that's an easy place that you could take a leak.
You could,

599
00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:24.450
um,
you know,
take a sip of water,
you can eat a little bar.
And I,

600
00:32:24.451 --> 00:32:27.970
in anytime I'm on a ledge,
say the size of Sofa cushion or something,

601
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.030
I'll basically pop my shoes off and relax my toes for a minute because climbing

602
00:32:31.031 --> 00:32:33.760
shoes are quite tight.
So like your feet start to cramp after awhile.

603
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.570
I mean there's a lot more self care going on up there and then people might

604
00:32:37.571 --> 00:32:41.150
think,
do you carry for that self care?

605
00:32:41.151 --> 00:32:44.930
Do you carry any other tools and you're like,
I don't know,
nail clippers,

606
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:49.070
any particular type of like,
I'm just making this up,
like lotion or anything?

607
00:32:49.071 --> 00:32:51.560
Not that you don't have that on your hands,
but,
no,
no.
I mean,

608
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:54.860
I normally just take food,
water and then a pair of say approach shoes.

609
00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:59.190
I can walk down afterward.
What type of food do you bring with you?
Um,

610
00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:02.810
typically I just bring,
you know,
a sports bar type.
What kind of like,
what's bar?

611
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:07.240
I'm all,
I'm obsessing again tells griddy.
Um,
I don't know.
I mean,
um,
I mean,

612
00:33:07.241 --> 00:33:09.630
so I used to be sponsored by Clif bars,
so I do like,
you know,

613
00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.480
shop blocks and z bars.
I love the z bars,

614
00:33:11.481 --> 00:33:14.690
a little kid's cliff bars mostly because they're kind of half size.

615
00:33:14.691 --> 00:33:16.730
They're like a hundred calories and then basically tastes like a cookie.

616
00:33:16.731 --> 00:33:20.450
So I can like always eat them because they're just kind of delicious.
Um,

617
00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:23.570
but now I can kind of get more into like nut butters and things.
The,

618
00:33:23.571 --> 00:33:27.170
the typical free solos are short enough that you don't really need like a full

619
00:33:27.171 --> 00:33:27.711
hearty meal.

620
00:33:27.711 --> 00:33:31.610
You can kind of get by with like a pack of shot blocks are like one little one

621
00:33:31.611 --> 00:33:35.030
sugary thing to just kind of keep you going.
Um,

622
00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:38.120
it's on like bigger climbs like albinism or something where you have to take

623
00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:42.810
like a lot of,
you know,
fatty,
like higher calorie food.
So this,

624
00:33:42.811 --> 00:33:43.670
this is actually,

625
00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:48.200
I will be the first person to admit that I actually do not know what albinism

626
00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.770
is.
Uh,
and,

627
00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:53.640
but one of the questions that came up this from Kelly O'shea,

628
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:58.490
my listeners is ask Alex about his recent achievements and albinism.

629
00:33:59.150 --> 00:33:59.690
Uh,

630
00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:04.550
what was it like as someone who's so accomplished in one discipline to be a

631
00:34:04.551 --> 00:34:06.440
beginner again in another type of climate?

632
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:10.910
Can you explain what albinism is and then how you would answer that?

633
00:34:11.390 --> 00:34:16.390
So albinism I guess is basically just climbing big mountains or big snowy or icy

634
00:34:16.971 --> 00:34:20.180
faces or you know,
grant and walls that are also covered with eyes.
I don't know.

635
00:34:20.181 --> 00:34:23.630
I mean albinism is just climbing the things that you see in posters where you're

636
00:34:23.631 --> 00:34:26.210
like,
Whoa,
that looks like a big scary mountain.
You know,

637
00:34:26.211 --> 00:34:29.000
cause I've always been more of a rock climber,
which is climbing like vertical,

638
00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:31.790
dry granite walls.
Um,

639
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:35.150
albinism is like when you do that and more remote places and like you hike

640
00:34:35.151 --> 00:34:35.931
across a glacier,

641
00:34:35.931 --> 00:34:39.200
you get to the bottom of some huge icy face and then you do all kinds of

642
00:34:39.201 --> 00:34:43.130
shenanigans to get at the top.
So what,
uh,

643
00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:48.850
what mistakes did you make if anyone first starting that type of climbing a

644
00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:54.110
well,
so basically,
I mean,
I haven't done a lot of albinism and I still,

645
00:34:54.111 --> 00:34:56.870
I can't ice climb at all.
I've never led a pitch advice,

646
00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:00.310
but I've actually done a handful of things that are considered like no worthy

647
00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.400
alpine a sense now,

648
00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.610
but it has more to do with choosing the right partners because I go with

649
00:35:04.611 --> 00:35:07.640
somebody who's like way more experienced than me or just someone who has much

650
00:35:07.641 --> 00:35:11.300
more of a plan.
And then it's sort of about the division of labor,
you know,

651
00:35:11.301 --> 00:35:13.400
like someone who's good at one thing.
And then I'm,

652
00:35:13.401 --> 00:35:15.740
I'm obviously good at the rock climbing component of it.

653
00:35:15.741 --> 00:35:18.130
So even though I'm a total beginner with the ice climbing,

654
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:21.080
with all the logistics and the camping and like dealing with living on a
glacier,

655
00:35:21.081 --> 00:35:22.460
all that kind of stuff is totally new to me.

656
00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:26.120
But at least I know how to do the climbing pretty well.
So then you know,

657
00:35:26.121 --> 00:35:28.790
you just find the teammate who complements that skillset.
Well,

658
00:35:28.791 --> 00:35:30.800
and then you can go out and climb all kinds of crazy things.

659
00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:36.980
So no,
I probably mentioned this,
the intro,
but just in case I,

660
00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:40.140
for people listening,
I'm sitting in my living room,

661
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:44.790
we're sitting in my living room and we have a whole like Phalynx of people

662
00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:47.310
surrounding us because we're filming this now.
One of the,

663
00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:51.180
one of the people here has actually been on the podcast before,
said Jimmy Chen.

664
00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:54.180
How does your climbing differ most from his?

665
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:58.140
Which UV Chan is predominantly a photographer.
So his climbing,

666
00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:01.770
it's not really climbing.
It's mostly just going up behind people take pictures.

667
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.090
I'm talking to you,
Jimmy.

668
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:12.120
Jimmy's been,
Jimmy's been classically more of a big wall climber.
Um,
I mean,

669
00:36:12.121 --> 00:36:15.230
Jimmy's never been like the best free Clinton.
Like,
you know,

670
00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:18.480
I mean he's not doing one arm pull ups and small edges and he's not like

671
00:36:18.481 --> 00:36:19.440
climbing the hardest sport routes,

672
00:36:19.441 --> 00:36:22.320
but he's always been able to like get to the top of big walls and then had been

673
00:36:22.321 --> 00:36:26.160
able to do that in the mountains,
you know,
with ice and snow and bad conditions.

674
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:27.630
And so he sort of,

675
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:31.500
the climate that he's been good at has been like farther along the spectrum of,

676
00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.380
you know,
big and Badass.
Then the type of climate,
you know,

677
00:36:34.381 --> 00:36:36.480
cause I grew up in a climbing gym,
um,

678
00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:40.410
and then sort of gradually extended to like big rock walls,
you know,

679
00:36:40.411 --> 00:36:43.320
and he sort of started on big rock walls and then extended into the bigger

680
00:36:43.321 --> 00:36:46.740
mountains.
Who were,
when you were getting started,

681
00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:50.310
just thinking back to say the first 10 years of climbing,
how old,
you know,

682
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:54.300
I'm 30,
30 getting old and I got that.
I heard your joints creaking.

683
00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:59.820
I feel like.
Who were some of your early mentors in climate?

684
00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:03.210
Um,
I didn't have a lot of mentors when,

685
00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.820
I mean I kind of just grew up in the gym just climbing a lot.

686
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.740
So I didn't really have mentors.

687
00:37:07.741 --> 00:37:10.530
I mean I definitely had people that I looked up to and people in the climbing

688
00:37:10.531 --> 00:37:13.800
community,
but that's just sort of the typical hero where should be style.

689
00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:14.041
You know,

690
00:37:14.041 --> 00:37:17.760
like Peter Croft was a really prominent solos from the generation before me and

691
00:37:17.761 --> 00:37:21.950
I was like,
oh,
Peter's the man.
And um,
you know,
Chris Sharma,
obviously it was,

692
00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:25.810
was like setting all kinds of world record type things when I was a kid and I

693
00:37:25.811 --> 00:37:29.410
was just like,
oh,
he's so amazing.
And Tommy Caldwell was also a big hero.
Um,

694
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.830
which has been cool because now I get to climb with Tommy as an adult and I'm

695
00:37:31.831 --> 00:37:34.660
just like,
oh,
that's pretty cool.
Or I'm still always excited to come with me.

696
00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:37.830
But what if you were,

697
00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:42.890
so I'm going to take like 20 different questions and hopefully rapid into one

698
00:37:43.021 --> 00:37:47.640
question and we can,
we can take some time on this,
but if you were taking a,

699
00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:51.210
let's just say an athletic wrote beginner,

700
00:37:51.211 --> 00:37:54.960
so someone who's never done any climbing but it has a decent athletic
background,

701
00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.150
right?
20,

702
00:37:57.151 --> 00:38:01.770
25 years old and they want to get really good at say bouldering,

703
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:04.860
uh,
and you are going to kind of lay out,

704
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:08.760
give them advice or train them for like eight weeks,
what would you,

705
00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:11.850
what would have them to do?
What would,
what would the,
what would that look like?

706
00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:15.090
I don't know.
I'd have to think about it a lot because I mean,

707
00:38:15.091 --> 00:38:17.610
particularly with bowling,
it's sort of,
it's interesting.

708
00:38:17.611 --> 00:38:22.410
So the adults are more prone to injury then,
then kids to some extent.

709
00:38:22.411 --> 00:38:24.980
And especially with,
with something like bouldering where,
um,

710
00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:27.270
it's really heavy on finger.

711
00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.000
Like basically it's really easy to injure your fingers and hands because all the

712
00:38:30.001 --> 00:38:32.220
connective tissue and tendons and ligaments take it very,

713
00:38:32.221 --> 00:38:35.590
very long time to strengthen.
So,
I mean,
there's no real shortcut to,

714
00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:37.450
to avoiding tendon injury,

715
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:41.950
whereas an adult like a 25 year old male would gain muscle mass super fast.

716
00:38:41.951 --> 00:38:43.420
So really quickly,

717
00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:46.150
they could exceed the capacity of their tenants then basically just rip their

718
00:38:46.151 --> 00:38:49.240
tenants out of their arms,
you know?
And so it's like one of those things where,

719
00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:52.180
I mean if I was trying to train somebody to be a good rock climber,

720
00:38:52.181 --> 00:38:53.220
I would focus on,

721
00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:56.110
on movement and technique and footwork and all those kinds of things.

722
00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:58.450
But if somebody was like,
in eight weeks,
I have to be able to boulder,

723
00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.910
like a certain difficulty level,
I'd be like,
well,
I mean,

724
00:39:00.911 --> 00:39:03.340
just start like training your fingers and hope that you don't get injured.

725
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:05.560
But like,
obviously that's not a sustainable,

726
00:39:05.561 --> 00:39:07.720
like if you're trying to be a good climber,
that's not the way to do it.

727
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:11.590
It's better to start with like the foundation.
So if let's talk about the,

728
00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:14.770
the footwork and technique then,
because I've,
I mean,

729
00:39:14.771 --> 00:39:17.020
you've been to a ton of climbing gyms.
I've been to mission clutch.

730
00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:20.110
I'm not a good climber.
I would not say,
uh,

731
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:25.230
but I can also recognize but not dissect when I see good climate versus bad

732
00:39:27.671 --> 00:39:28.990
climate.
Right.
Where people are just,

733
00:39:28.991 --> 00:39:33.330
I'm shaking like a leaf and using a hall arm strength.
Uh,

734
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:34.060
what,

735
00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:36.850
what types of advice would you give someone who wanted to do it the right way,

736
00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:39.760
but they're like,
all right,
I just,
I want to focus on the right things.

737
00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.020
What should I really focus on?

738
00:39:41.021 --> 00:39:44.140
And I would say the right things are our movement and technique.

739
00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:47.260
And so like how you move over the rock has nothing to do with how well you can

740
00:39:47.261 --> 00:39:51.190
hold on or like how hard you pull as to do with,
you know,

741
00:39:51.191 --> 00:39:55.330
knowing where your center of mass is and like being able to move your body

742
00:39:55.331 --> 00:39:58.060
around in the right ways that you can stay balanced over your feet and you can

743
00:39:58.061 --> 00:39:59.560
move yourself upward with your feet.

744
00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:04.900
How do you conserve energy when you're climbing it?

745
00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:10.630
Leaving out the pizza sized pizza box?
Um,
no,

746
00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.840
I mean the main ways to save energy or to keep,
keep your weight on your feet,

747
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:14.800
which is kind of the same thing,

748
00:40:14.801 --> 00:40:17.950
to stay balanced over your feet so that all as much weight as possible as on

749
00:40:17.951 --> 00:40:19.300
your feet.
So you're just standing.

750
00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.570
And then to keep your arms straight or to keep all your limbs straight so that

751
00:40:22.571 --> 00:40:24.580
you're hanging off your skeleton more than your muscles.

752
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:27.240
Because if you have your arms bent at 90 degrees,
like a t rex or something,

753
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:30.520
then you're like totally engage your bicep and your lats and you're getting

754
00:40:30.521 --> 00:40:33.370
tired.
If you have your arms totally straight,

755
00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.820
then you're only engaging just as much muscle as you need to keep your fingers

756
00:40:36.821 --> 00:40:39.670
holding on.
But everything else is relaxed because you're hanging off your bones.

757
00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:43.120
So I want to underscore something you said a little earlier because uh,

758
00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:48.690
a lot of sort of aggressive dudes listened to this podcast is aggressive dude,

759
00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:51.403
aggressive,

760
00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:57.760
like slap on a ton of muscle in my arms and like biceps and lats and go crush

761
00:40:57.761 --> 00:41:00.880
this bouldering wall.
But you made a really important point,
uh,
several,

762
00:41:00.881 --> 00:41:02.850
one of which was that if you,

763
00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:06.940
if you pack on a lot of muscular strength you can outstrip your sort of tendon

764
00:41:06.941 --> 00:41:10.270
and just really quickly what particularly as an adult,

765
00:41:10.271 --> 00:41:13.420
I mean if you start climbing as a kid then then you gain muscle at the sort of

766
00:41:13.421 --> 00:41:14.254
the same.

767
00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:19.370
That's why you're in like hormonal nirvana as an adolescent and this is

768
00:41:19.811 --> 00:41:23.860
something that also a guy named Chris summer coach,

769
00:41:23.861 --> 00:41:26.530
summer underscored for me.

770
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:31.810
He's the former national a gymnastics team coach for men's and he was saying

771
00:41:31.811 --> 00:41:34.010
that unlike many other

772
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:38.390
<v 2>sports like its contra indicated to say use anabolics in gymnastics because all</v>

773
00:41:38.391 --> 00:41:41.420
you're going to do is end up rob rupturing a tendon or ligament for the same

774
00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:44.480
reasons.
Yeah,
totally.
Sounds calming.
Uh,

775
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:48.980
what do you worry about when you go to sleep at night,
if anything?

776
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:51.050
Like when you worry before you go to bed,

777
00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:55.670
what kind of stuff do you worry about it I was like that's a quick 80.
Yeah,

778
00:41:55.671 --> 00:41:58.710
this is going to be full of all sorts of weird 90 degree turn to keep listeners

779
00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:02.330
on their toes so that people scrubbing through the podcasts get confused.

780
00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:05.330
I don't want any storyline that they try to skip ahead.
Yeah.

781
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:10.080
<v 3>With,
um,
uh,
no,
I don't really worry that much when I,
when I was sleep.</v>

782
00:42:10.081 --> 00:42:13.310
I mean the stuff that I get stressed about is all like real life stuff with,
uh,

783
00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:16.920
you know,
dealing with email and responding to calls and like,
you know,

784
00:42:16.921 --> 00:42:19.020
hustling and I don't know,
like doing my taxes,
you know,

785
00:42:19.021 --> 00:42:20.670
like all this stuff that I'm just like not good at.

786
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:24.210
<v 2>So let,
let me ask,</v>

787
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:27.770
this is like partially me turning this into a therapy session for myself here,

788
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:31.460
but should I just lay down,
lay on the sofa here?
Uh,

789
00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:36.850
that's usually my second day podcast.
The pressure at the just relaxed,
but the,

790
00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:41.310
uh,
the,
the question I'd like to ask is why do this,

791
00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:47.650
when is enough enough to fuel the climbing?
Meaning,

792
00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:53.580
what do you hope to do with the additional money you make above and beyond what

793
00:42:54.041 --> 00:42:57.570
you need to sustain climbing often?

794
00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.550
Because it's not that at a certain point you surpass that pretty easily,

795
00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:04.450
but you're certainly keeping busy.
Uh,
your,
your,

796
00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:08.650
you have a number of sponsors,
uh,
you're tremendously good at what you do.

797
00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:10.850
So what do you mean?

798
00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:13.230
<v 3>I mean,
that is interesting because a,
and I've,
you know,</v>

799
00:43:13.231 --> 00:43:17.420
I've thought about this a lot over the years because for say the first five or

800
00:43:17.421 --> 00:43:19.280
seven years that I was living in the van,

801
00:43:19.281 --> 00:43:21.620
my overhead is probably 10 to 15 k year.

802
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:25.370
And I now obviously make a lot more than that through sponsorship and just doing

803
00:43:25.371 --> 00:43:27.230
like one commercial or something,
you know,

804
00:43:27.231 --> 00:43:30.650
I can make many times what I need to live in the road for a long time.

805
00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:32.793
<v 2>And so,</v>

806
00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:35.770
<v 3>you know,
part of that,
I mean,
I'm,
I'm obviously saving for retirement,</v>

807
00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:38.440
things like that,
trying to be responsible with money.
But,
um,

808
00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:40.940
and then I've also started a foundation where I've been given probably a third

809
00:43:40.941 --> 00:43:45.420
of my income now to,
to a environmental nonprofit things.
Um,

810
00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.220
but yeah,
basically,
I mean honestly the foundation was kind of my,

811
00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:51.050
my response to that kind of stuff cause I was like,

812
00:43:51.051 --> 00:43:52.070
I just don't need to make more.

813
00:43:52.071 --> 00:43:54.560
But the thing is it is actually kind of fun to make more,
you know,

814
00:43:54.561 --> 00:43:57.800
it's like fun to do the random opportunities like to do a commercial project or

815
00:43:57.801 --> 00:44:01.640
to like give some talk to some interesting company or you know,
whatever.

816
00:44:01.641 --> 00:44:03.800
I mean it's kind of fun to be able to hustle up money like that,

817
00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:08.180
but then it's like equally fun to be able to use that money for something

818
00:44:08.181 --> 00:44:10.850
positive,
which is through the foundation basically.

819
00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:13.790
What is the name of the foundation?
It,
it's just the Arnold Foundation.

820
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:17.750
Easy to remember.
Yeah.
It's like kind of Douchey,
but like it kind of made sense.

821
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:21.550
<v 2>No,
I don't think it's Douchey.
I think it's easy to remember it.
Just sensible.</v>

822
00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:27.080
Uh,
so the reason I was asking about the,

823
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:30.980
what do you worry about before you go to bed is because there are people,

824
00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:36.650
I have never seen so many questions about brass balls in my life when I pulled

825
00:44:37.051 --> 00:44:38.730
my readers for questions for you.

826
00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:43.120
And we've never had an in depth conversation.
Uh,

827
00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:47.520
but I know a lot of people say here in Silicon Valley or other folks who give

828
00:44:47.521 --> 00:44:52.190
the appearance of being invincible,
they've,
they never worry about anything.
Uh,

829
00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:56.790
and it can be kind of demoralizing for people who feel like they need to be

830
00:44:56.791 --> 00:44:58.860
superhuman to achieve good things.

831
00:44:58.861 --> 00:45:02.010
And so what I always like to ask people who are spectacular,

832
00:45:02.011 --> 00:45:06.540
good at what they do or dig into is like what challenges they've had or what

833
00:45:06.541 --> 00:45:09.210
they struggle with.
So for those people who say like,

834
00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.250
that guy's got everything together,
he doesn't worry about anything.

835
00:45:11.251 --> 00:45:14.040
I'm not like that.
What are some that,
like what,

836
00:45:14.041 --> 00:45:18.090
what are some of the challenges or,
um,
dark periods that you've had,

837
00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.890
if any come to mind?
And if the answer is none,
and that's,
that's it.

838
00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:24.340
<v 3>Financial term.
Vincible no,
I mean,
um,
well it's funny you ask me,</v>

839
00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:27.380
just in the last two months I've had to sort of random injuries that are like

840
00:45:27.381 --> 00:45:28.970
super annoying,
um,

841
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.900
which I hadn't really had any kind of injuries climbing and in years or like

842
00:45:32.901 --> 00:45:36.650
ever really.
Um,
but like last month in April,
I got a,

843
00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:38.210
I got dropped on a partner,

844
00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:41.300
so I got a load off the end of her rope and like compression fracture,

845
00:45:41.301 --> 00:45:43.220
two vertebrae in my back and I was an ultra bruised.

846
00:45:43.221 --> 00:45:46.340
And so my hips and and stuff,
you know,
my back's been really tight.

847
00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:50.660
I've been kind of Achy.
Um,
that worked out kind of.
Okay.

848
00:45:50.661 --> 00:45:53.750
It was two days before I was supposed to fly to China for a climbing expedition.

849
00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:56.030
And,
um,
and so I was like,
well,

850
00:45:56.031 --> 00:45:59.240
all the travel time will sort of be like good rest I guess.
And then,
you know,

851
00:45:59.241 --> 00:46:01.490
I got there and I was like,
creaky old man.

852
00:46:01.491 --> 00:46:04.100
But I actually did manage to climb the thing that we were hoping to do and it

853
00:46:04.101 --> 00:46:07.130
all kind of worked out okay in the end.
But you know,
there was definitely,

854
00:46:07.131 --> 00:46:08.870
it was a little touch and go because I was like,
at first,

855
00:46:08.871 --> 00:46:11.120
I mean when I was going to the airport to fly to China,

856
00:46:11.121 --> 00:46:13.920
I couldn't even lift my duffle bags cause like my back was to soar and

857
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:18.290
everything was too to creaky.
Um,
and then actually just like two days ago,

858
00:46:18.291 --> 00:46:20.510
I took a weird fall.
Well actually I took a totally normal fall,

859
00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:23.090
but I sound how tweaked my hand in a weird way.
And I'm actually,

860
00:46:23.091 --> 00:46:25.640
I mean you can probably see the back of my right.
Yeah,
I was looking at that.

861
00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:29.840
Yeah.
My right hand,
it's like all messed up right now.
And um,
and you know,

862
00:46:29.841 --> 00:46:32.090
I mean there's definitely a lot of uncertainty there cause I mean,

863
00:46:32.250 --> 00:46:35.360
I can't even like click the power button on my phone without like pretty serious

864
00:46:35.361 --> 00:46:38.840
pain with my right hand right now.
But you know,

865
00:46:38.841 --> 00:46:41.850
it's been two days and it's kind of improving and you know,
we'll see like,

866
00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:44.540
and the things,
the forecast is rain for the next three days.
I'm like,
well,

867
00:46:44.541 --> 00:46:48.590
I'll have three days to rest and then you know,
maybe it will be okay or,

868
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:52.310
or maybe it will be good enough that I can at least work towards some of my

869
00:46:52.311 --> 00:46:53.390
other goals for the season.

870
00:46:53.391 --> 00:46:57.380
And then by the time it's recovered and say another two weeks I'll be like ready

871
00:46:57.381 --> 00:46:59.930
to,
you know,
do some of the things I'm going to do.
I mean,
we'll see.

872
00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.860
We just kind of how China when I was like,
well,
you know,

873
00:47:03.861 --> 00:47:07.400
I can at least do all the work towards what I'm trying to climb while I'm

874
00:47:07.401 --> 00:47:11.090
crippled.
And then by the time it was ready,
by the time I was ready to,

875
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:13.680
to actually try to climb the route and it was like,
Oh,

876
00:47:13.681 --> 00:47:15.770
well I'm actually feeling good enough by now and I was able to do that.

877
00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:21.760
<v 2>Do you ever get depressed or have you ever been depressed?</v>

878
00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:24.010
<v 3>Yeah,
no,
I think,</v>

879
00:47:24.011 --> 00:47:27.820
I mean I think I kind of gravitate towards being a somewhat depressed person.

880
00:47:27.821 --> 00:47:30.190
I don't know.
Or,
I dunno actually,

881
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:34.990
<v 2>or I'm just sort of like flat what will stick into that first part and we'll see</v>

882
00:47:34.991 --> 00:47:39.690
what we come up with.
So why do you say that you think?
I definitely,
um,

883
00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:45.160
oscillate to fairly high highs and reasonably low lows and I've been trying to

884
00:47:45.161 --> 00:47:45.971
take the edge,

885
00:47:45.971 --> 00:47:50.110
like take the 20 top like the top and bottom 20% off of those to make it a

886
00:47:50.111 --> 00:47:52.900
little more manageable.
But uh,

887
00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:56.290
why do you say that you might tend towards easy?

888
00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:59.210
I feel like I don't have any of the highs and I kind of go from,

889
00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:03.640
from level to like slightly below level tobacco,
you know,
it's all like,

890
00:48:03.641 --> 00:48:08.470
it's all pretty flat I feel like.
And does that,
when you,
when you dip,

891
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.101
does that,

892
00:48:09.101 --> 00:48:14.101
is that triggered by certain types of things or is it just a cycle that comes

893
00:48:14.501 --> 00:48:15.334
with time?

894
00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:19.330
<v 3>Um,
I don't know.
Yeah,
maybe it's just a cycle time.</v>

895
00:48:19.331 --> 00:48:21.220
It's like sometimes you just feel useless,
you know?

896
00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:22.630
But I mean in some ways though,

897
00:48:22.631 --> 00:48:25.330
I embrace that as part of the process because you kind of have to feel like a

898
00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:28.570
worthless piece of poop in order to get motivated enough to go do something that

899
00:48:28.571 --> 00:48:31.960
makes you feel less useless.
But then,

900
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:35.320
but then ultimately that still doesn't make you feel any less useless and you

901
00:48:35.321 --> 00:48:36.400
just have to keep doing more.

902
00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:41.690
<v 2>So that's perfect segue to the,
uh,
the,
the,</v>

903
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:43.250
the main question from the,

904
00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:46.040
from the person who asked what you do when you have to take a shit on the side

905
00:48:46.041 --> 00:48:48.320
of a wall.
Is there,

906
00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:53.360
or do you ever see a point where you'll feel that you've accomplished all that

907
00:48:53.361 --> 00:48:57.480
you can in climbing?
Where's,
is there always a,
what's next?
Um,

908
00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:01.460
I think there's definitely,
you know,
I can definitely see a point

909
00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:05.600
<v 3>where I wouldn't continue pushing.
I mean there is always a,</v>

910
00:49:05.601 --> 00:49:08.150
what's next in climbing and um,
you know,

911
00:49:08.151 --> 00:49:12.170
I mean you can always try to improve in some way or like go to new places or do

912
00:49:12.171 --> 00:49:13.400
first ascents or,
I mean,
you know,

913
00:49:13.401 --> 00:49:16.850
there is always something new to be done in climbing though I can definitely see

914
00:49:16.851 --> 00:49:20.270
personally a point at which,
you know,
I'm like,
okay,
I'm satisfied.

915
00:49:20.271 --> 00:49:24.290
Like I've done more I need to do.
And um,
you know,
yeah,

916
00:49:24.291 --> 00:49:28.610
we'll see you kinda though I will say climbing more than most other professional

917
00:49:28.611 --> 00:49:31.760
sports has like quite a long career span kind of because of that because there's

918
00:49:31.761 --> 00:49:34.880
always more you can do with like trips and expeditions and first versus Sansom

919
00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.280
and there's a really creative process to it.

920
00:49:37.281 --> 00:49:39.500
You can always like come up with interesting challenges and it's just sort of

921
00:49:39.501 --> 00:49:44.420
like do things that nobody's thought of before.
And so,
you know,
I mean,
you know,

922
00:49:44.421 --> 00:49:47.240
they're professional climbers in their 50s that are still like getting after it

923
00:49:47.241 --> 00:49:48.074
like that.

924
00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:49.573
<v 2>When,
uh,</v>

925
00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:54.780
when you are about to do a big climb or just a very strenuous,
uh,

926
00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:57.610
climbing workout,
I'm not even sure if you do that anymore.

927
00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:01.320
Maybe you could talk about it,
but how do you warm up if you do?
Yeah,

928
00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:05.130
<v 3>I always warm up pretty,
pretty gently and when I can just,
so just,
um,</v>

929
00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:08.310
I mean it depends on where I am.
If I'm in a climbing gym,
um,

930
00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:11.160
then I just warm up on a handful of easy routes and then,

931
00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:16.050
and then start the harder ones later.
Uh,
I mean for the last month and a half,

932
00:50:16.051 --> 00:50:18.870
I've been stretching like every morning and every night because of the back

933
00:50:18.871 --> 00:50:22.560
thing because how tight my hips and everything feel right now.
Um,

934
00:50:22.561 --> 00:50:25.650
so doing some stretching and some like light exercise to sort of warm up and

935
00:50:25.651 --> 00:50:30.590
then,
you know,
when you can't climb,
uh,
let's just say you're,

936
00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:35.340
you're on the road.
What type of exercise do you do?
I mean,
I,

937
00:50:35.341 --> 00:50:37.170
I try to still climb when I'm on the road.
Um,

938
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:39.980
I mean there's just so many gyms and different places that you can always do

939
00:50:39.981 --> 00:50:41.870
that.
But,
um,
if there's absolutely nothing,

940
00:50:41.871 --> 00:50:45.500
then maybe I'll run or I'll go hiking or it kind of depends on what

941
00:50:45.501 --> 00:50:46.370
opportunities are.
I mean,

942
00:50:46.371 --> 00:50:49.830
I'd rather go mountain biking then than other things or I'd rather go skiing if

943
00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:53.350
that's available.
Um,
but I mean,
as long as I'm getting some kind of actors,

944
00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.370
I mean even like stand up paddle boarding or something,
I'm like,

945
00:50:55.371 --> 00:50:57.500
well at least I did something today.
You know,

946
00:50:57.890 --> 00:51:02.060
a lot of recreational climbers deal with,
as we've touched on earlier,

947
00:51:02.061 --> 00:51:06.460
sort of a hand issues,
wrist issues,
elbow issues.
Uh,
I'm,

948
00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:09.470
I mean he saw me when,
when,
when you guys arrived today.

949
00:51:09.471 --> 00:51:12.580
I had myself wrapped up in this stuff called Voodoo floss cause I had,

950
00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:14.340
my elbows are killing me.
Uh,

951
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:18.680
and how have you seen climbers,
uh,

952
00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:22.070
keep their elbows and joints in good health?

953
00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:26.620
Is there any particular approaches that you think have had a very,
I don't,

954
00:51:26.621 --> 00:51:28.610
I don't think there's like an easy answer to that kind of stuff.

955
00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:32.960
I mean I had some elbow issues for a while now it's like eight or nine years ago

956
00:51:32.961 --> 00:51:33.441
or something,

957
00:51:33.441 --> 00:51:36.380
but I had to sorta like chronic elbow pain on and off for almost a year.

958
00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:40.580
But then eventually it just sort of resolved and I mean I think the best way

959
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:42.260
with that kind of stuff,
it's sort of prevention,

960
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:45.740
you know like may maintain antagonist muscles and just sort of like stay well

961
00:51:45.741 --> 00:51:47.000
balanced and everything and just,

962
00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:51.350
and if you start to feel achiness or pain coming on then to you know,

963
00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:52.670
take the appropriate rest or,

964
00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.120
or maybe change your training to some extent or basically just not to let it

965
00:51:56.121 --> 00:51:58.640
become a big problem because I feel like all those overuse injuries,

966
00:51:58.641 --> 00:51:59.570
like once their problem,

967
00:51:59.571 --> 00:52:03.080
then it's like really hard to deal with the antagonistic muscles.

968
00:52:03.081 --> 00:52:07.220
Meaning if you're doing a lot of say like Fletcher work kind of gripping that

969
00:52:07.221 --> 00:52:11.270
you're going to use like finger extension and wrist extension and so on.
Yeah.

970
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:14.930
Though,
I've actually never done the whole extension stuff with,
with hands,

971
00:52:14.931 --> 00:52:15.764
I don't know.

972
00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:20.030
But to me I'm antagonist muscles are more like doing pushups or random or tricep

973
00:52:20.031 --> 00:52:23.420
poles or things to balance out your arms a bit.
Since you do so much polling,

974
00:52:23.421 --> 00:52:25.430
like to be able to do some kind of pushing.
Sometimes

975
00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:32.750
what's in your mind separates a great climber from a good climber and you can

976
00:52:32.751 --> 00:52:35.930
answer that however you want.
Um,
I dunno,

977
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:41.750
I mean,
yeah,
I don't let it slow.
Okay.
I'll ask it.
I'll ask it differently.

978
00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:46.280
Who impresses you right now as a club?
Um,
just one of,
I'm sure many,

979
00:52:46.281 --> 00:52:49.860
but a kid,
Mark Andre Le Clercq Marcus,

980
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:52.790
the student of this Canadian guy.
Um,

981
00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:56.510
he's been doing like all kinds of crazy alpine,
so on.
You're just like,
Whoa,

982
00:52:57.310 --> 00:53:01.400
what makes it so crazy?
I Dunno.
It just,
it just like kind of blows my mind a bit.

983
00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:04.790
And it's funny because I actually don't ice climber or Alpine climb at a high

984
00:53:04.791 --> 00:53:07.370
enough level to quite understand what he's doing.
Even like,

985
00:53:07.371 --> 00:53:09.440
cause it's hard for me to probably appreciate just how hard it is.

986
00:53:09.441 --> 00:53:12.440
But then a lot of my friends who do climate a very high level are like,
Whoa,

987
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:15.140
that's messed up.
And I'm just like,
yeah,
respect.

988
00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:20.090
And for those people who want to see visuals on this stuff,
we'll,

989
00:53:20.091 --> 00:53:24.260
we'll grab some video and uh,
links to the,

990
00:53:24.261 --> 00:53:25.920
one of the interesting things Mark Andre is that,

991
00:53:25.921 --> 00:53:28.550
I don't know if there is video of most of the stuff that we're doing.
Yeah.

992
00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:31.590
I mean it's just going out and doing all this crazy stuff.
Okay.
You're just like,

993
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:36.780
it's um,
it's pretty full on will I will,
I will attempt a Jimmy,

994
00:53:36.781 --> 00:53:38.620
you know this guy,
you know of them.

995
00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:43.530
What in your mind makes an impressive as a Alpine Alpine to Alpine climber?

996
00:53:43.850 --> 00:53:46.740
I bet Jimmy hasn't even heard any of this stuff he's like recently been doing in

997
00:53:46.741 --> 00:53:48.330
the Rockies.
It's like pretty crazy.

998
00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:56.960
Yeah.
It's like so crazy.
I'll repeat for you guys listening

999
00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:12.893
<v 5>generation</v>

1000
00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:19.970
is that people are considering,

1001
00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:23.110
<v 3>so he's his ears.
So just to try to paraphrase here.</v>

1002
00:54:23.111 --> 00:54:27.790
So his commitment level is just next level and he sort of pushing everyone else

1003
00:54:27.791 --> 00:54:29.380
to consider things that haven't been done.

1004
00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:32.613
<v 5>Hello?</v>

1005
00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:40.400
<v 3>He's very calm though.
He does have a ton of experience really.
I mean,
you know,</v>

1006
00:54:40.401 --> 00:54:44.660
cause he's just done so much of it.
He's been doing like uh,
any for like,

1007
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:45.690
you know.
Yeah.

1008
00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:50.060
So the commitment level meaning pushing the envelope is usually predicated on

1009
00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:54.670
experience level.
Therefore you see the,
some of the older guys doing it but know

1010
00:54:57.450 --> 00:55:00.520
cause they're all like that's messed up on the,

1011
00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:04.610
on the uh,
on the danger side,

1012
00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:07.790
this is a question from Paul Jones.

1013
00:55:07.850 --> 00:55:10.670
So being the first sponsored superstar free soloing,

1014
00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:14.180
do you ever have concerns about the influencer you can have on young climbers

1015
00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:16.030
who um,

1016
00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:21.220
may not put in the mileage and the training to get to a point where they can do

1017
00:55:22.701 --> 00:55:24.920
it as safely?
Yeah.
Well so there are two things.
One,

1018
00:55:24.921 --> 00:55:27.080
I'm definitely not the first superstar,

1019
00:55:27.081 --> 00:55:31.430
whatever cause there are a bunch of European climbers who are well known for so

1020
00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:33.170
line who've come before me.

1021
00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:36.980
And even in the u s somebody like John Backer was like super well known in the

1022
00:55:36.981 --> 00:55:39.320
1970s and he was on all kinds of TV programs.

1023
00:55:39.321 --> 00:55:41.870
It might not have been sponsorship in the same way that we have today because

1024
00:55:41.871 --> 00:55:42.890
the industry wasn't the same,

1025
00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:47.210
but he was definitely on the evening news and all kinds of crazy things for you

1026
00:55:47.211 --> 00:55:50.480
so long.
So I'm,
I mean I'm definitely not the first by any means.

1027
00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:53.360
And it's interesting because,
you know,

1028
00:55:53.361 --> 00:55:56.150
I was obviously a kid who was influenced by that kind of stuff,

1029
00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:00.650
but then I've gone through,
you know,
years and years of practice or whatever.

1030
00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:04.910
Um,
I kind of feel like soling is a bit,
uh,

1031
00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:08.450
and almost like self regulating in a way.
Because the thing is,

1032
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:11.030
is that anybody can watch a video and be like,
I want to do that.

1033
00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:13.250
But then as soon as they climb 15 or 20 feet off the ground,

1034
00:56:13.251 --> 00:56:15.490
they start to have a very frank discussion with themselves.
Like,

1035
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:18.260
do I really want to do this?
You know,
like it's something that feels very scary.

1036
00:56:18.261 --> 00:56:21.920
Cause I mean people have like an overwhelming fear response to the prospect of

1037
00:56:21.921 --> 00:56:23.560
falling to their death,
you know?

1038
00:56:23.561 --> 00:56:26.860
And so I had an overwhelming fear response just watching videos.
Well,
yeah,

1039
00:56:26.861 --> 00:56:29.950
exactly.
I mean that's kind of the thing is that hardly anybody sees that film.

1040
00:56:29.951 --> 00:56:32.710
It's like,
oh,
I'm going to go do that.
And then even even if they do,

1041
00:56:32.711 --> 00:56:33.850
once they start trying to do it,

1042
00:56:33.851 --> 00:56:36.370
I mean it is actually quite difficult to climb these walls so it's not as if

1043
00:56:36.371 --> 00:56:38.970
some kid can just like wander up and do that and then,

1044
00:56:38.971 --> 00:56:41.560
and even if they are strong enough or like,
you know,

1045
00:56:41.561 --> 00:56:44.680
well versed and ethnic climbing to climb a little bit,
then they're also like,

1046
00:56:44.681 --> 00:56:45.970
wow,
this is really,
really scary.

1047
00:56:45.971 --> 00:56:49.120
I didn't expect it to be this scary and then they just climbed back down.
Um,

1048
00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:52.590
so I mean,
you know,
you know,

1049
00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:54.880
I've thought a little bit about influencing kids and like,
you know,

1050
00:56:54.881 --> 00:56:55.930
wondering if that's a bad thing.

1051
00:56:55.931 --> 00:56:58.690
But in general like you just don't really see copycat things.

1052
00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:02.440
Like you see it a lot more in,
in gravity assist at sports or like action sports.

1053
00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:05.680
So like kayaking or skiing or something where like anyone can just line up at

1054
00:57:05.681 --> 00:57:06.820
the top of a cliff and be like,

1055
00:57:06.821 --> 00:57:09.520
I'm going to hook this cliff and I'm going to stick it and it's going to be
sick.

1056
00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:10.061
You know?

1057
00:57:10.061 --> 00:57:12.880
And then once they sort of commit and start going and it's like they're going

1058
00:57:12.881 --> 00:57:15.880
off the cliff one way or another,
you can start the music,
they can't turn it off.

1059
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:17.230
Yeah,
exactly.
But with climbing,

1060
00:57:17.231 --> 00:57:20.970
it's like each move that you make upward is like a decision that you're going to

1061
00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:23.440
continue going upward.
You have to decide over and over.
Like,

1062
00:57:23.441 --> 00:57:25.510
I want to keep going,
I want to keep going.
I want to keep,

1063
00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.790
at a certain point you're like,
I don't really want to keep going.

1064
00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:31.590
Like I think I would go down and then you're just like mobby you know?

1065
00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:32.960
And then like,
yeah,
I mean,

1066
00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:37.390
have you ever hit that point when it was,

1067
00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:42.020
let's just say,
Oh,
we've started screaming for Mommy,
mommy,

1068
00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:44.260
a whore,
like hundreds of feet up and you're like,

1069
00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:46.030
I don't want to keep doing this.
Yeah,
no,

1070
00:57:46.031 --> 00:57:48.910
I've definitely had a bunch of times so long where I'm like,
I'm not into this.

1071
00:57:48.911 --> 00:57:52.920
I'm going down.
And what happens then,
because I've,

1072
00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:55.660
I've never seen footage of you climbing down,

1073
00:57:57.310 --> 00:57:59.680
but that's kind of a practical thing is that if you have people that are filming

1074
00:57:59.681 --> 00:58:02.230
with you,
it's like obviously you're doing something that you've rehearsed or,

1075
00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:04.900
or a,
you know,
a lot about,
or it's like,
you know,

1076
00:58:04.901 --> 00:58:07.030
it's a classic enough root that it's worthy to film on.

1077
00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:11.230
Like you have all those epic misadventures on things that like aren't that well

1078
00:58:11.231 --> 00:58:13.940
known that,
you know,
people are in climbing all the time.
But no.

1079
00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:17.200
So I've had tons of experiences where,
um,
especially when I was younger,

1080
00:58:17.201 --> 00:58:18.730
I didn't really know how to read Topo.
Is that,
well,

1081
00:58:18.731 --> 00:58:20.830
the little maps that show you like where a climbing route goes.

1082
00:58:21.010 --> 00:58:23.590
So I'd look at it and be like,
okay,
I think I'm climbing that big corner.

1083
00:58:23.591 --> 00:58:25.960
And then I'd go up there and be like,
this isn't even the right route.
Like,

1084
00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:26.830
what the heck am I doing?

1085
00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:30.370
And then I'd start like questing way to their left or right being like,
well,

1086
00:58:30.371 --> 00:58:33.220
maybe if I traverse 200 feet that way then I'll get to the real root.

1087
00:58:33.221 --> 00:58:35.920
And then you're like,
Oh God,
what am I doing?
And then it all starts to go south,

1088
00:58:35.921 --> 00:58:40.310
you know?
Uh,
and,
and then you'd climb down in an instant slow,

1089
00:58:40.311 --> 00:58:44.060
or I would like quest over to some other route and escape off west donors is

1090
00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:47.330
just a traverse.
Yeah.
Or,
or whatever.
You know,
there are many,

1091
00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:50.110
a couple routes where I've been like,
especially when I was younger,

1092
00:58:50.111 --> 00:58:52.960
when I was holding a route and I get up and all of a sudden I'm like,
Oh,

1093
00:58:52.961 --> 00:58:55.480
I'm on a bolted face,
but this route isn't supposed to have bolts.

1094
00:58:55.481 --> 00:58:57.940
And then I'm like,
oh no,
I'm on the wrong route.

1095
00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:00.640
And then you like look over and you see that the real route you're supposed to

1096
00:59:00.641 --> 00:59:02.950
be on,
it's like a hundred meters to the right.
And then you're like,

1097
00:59:02.951 --> 00:59:05.590
I wonder what route I'm on.
And then you're like,
oh,
I hope it's not hard.

1098
00:59:05.591 --> 00:59:08.830
And then you're suddenly like,
Shit.
And then you start like pulling on the bolts,

1099
00:59:08.831 --> 00:59:10.750
which is cheating.
Um,
and you're just like,

1100
00:59:10.751 --> 00:59:12.610
whatever it takes to like get off this wall,
you know?

1101
00:59:12.611 --> 00:59:15.340
And so you're like pulling on bolts and stepping on bolts and like doing

1102
00:59:15.341 --> 00:59:18.790
whatever just to like get to the top and then later you're like,
oh,

1103
00:59:18.791 --> 00:59:23.260
I wish I knew how to read the guide book.
Uh,
no.

1104
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:27.920
So this is,
this is a related question from drew Cordova.

1105
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:32.270
So there's a video that shows Alix climbing El cap free solo where he said he

1106
00:59:32.271 --> 00:59:36.750
was freaking out incorrect.
Well,
there are all kinds of income.
Sure.

1107
00:59:36.751 --> 00:59:37.860
There's lots of yeah,
yeah.

1108
00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:42.170
Just go on and on where he's freaking out on the cliff face at one point.

1109
00:59:42.171 --> 00:59:46.010
I'd like to know from his perspective what it takes to overcome that fear.
Uh,

1110
00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:49.100
okay.
So the video clip that he's referring to,

1111
00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:52.010
I'm actually free soloing in the face of half dome,
which is a different wall.

1112
00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:52.993
Yep.

1113
00:59:53.570 --> 00:59:57.680
And that's actually complicated because it shows me standing on this ledge on

1114
00:59:57.681 --> 00:59:59.720
half dome,
like having a moment,
being really scared.

1115
01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:03.320
But we shot that film like a year after my actual free Solo.

1116
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:06.440
So I had gone up there and saw it about myself,
nobody around,

1117
01:00:06.441 --> 01:00:08.270
which is kind of the point of free soloing normally.

1118
01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:12.350
And then we'd gone back and filmed on it and when we filmed on it I walked out

1119
01:00:12.351 --> 01:00:14.750
on that ledge and like had a moment where I was a little bit afraid and then

1120
01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:17.600
like sorted myself out,
turn around and climb back.

1121
01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:21.740
But then they use the voiceover of me talking about the original experience when

1122
01:00:21.741 --> 01:00:24.980
I've actually been free song at the year before where I had like a much more

1123
01:00:24.981 --> 01:00:27.980
significant moment on a section a hundred feet higher,

1124
01:00:27.981 --> 01:00:29.030
which is actually quite difficult.

1125
01:00:29.031 --> 01:00:31.580
Climbing cause like walking across a ledge is never that scary.

1126
01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:33.290
You know what I mean?
Like in the grand scheme of rock climbing,

1127
01:00:33.291 --> 01:00:35.770
like when you're standing on the ledge,
like you're not scared.
Um,

1128
01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.880
it just happened in that case cause I was standing face out,

1129
01:00:37.881 --> 01:00:40.520
which is like a little off balance and a little scary.
And I was like,
Whoa,

1130
01:00:40.521 --> 01:00:43.070
this isn't what I expected.
But it's not that big a thing,

1131
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:44.780
but the actual experience of higher,

1132
01:00:44.781 --> 01:00:46.910
it was like one of those things where they caught this moment on film and it

1133
01:00:46.911 --> 01:00:49.940
kind of went well with the voiceover and they're like all perfect.
Yeah,
exactly.

1134
01:00:49.941 --> 01:00:52.710
And so it made for a great film and it definitely like shares the free solo

1135
01:00:52.711 --> 01:00:55.250
experience pretty well.
It was one of the things at first I was like,

1136
01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:57.920
I was sort of annoyed that it's not the literal like this isn't what happened,

1137
01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:00.380
but the thing is like nobody's there when it actually happens.

1138
01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:02.600
So then it does share the experience pretty well.

1139
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:05.930
So in the actual halftone experience when it was scary,

1140
01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:08.750
even though,
like you mentioned earlier,

1141
01:01:08.751 --> 01:01:12.620
you've kind of rehearsed what it's gonna feel like as you're going up this,

1142
01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:17.350
this route.
What do you,
what do you,
and not to Belabor this point,
but it's,

1143
01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:19.370
it's a,
it's something I'm fascinated by.

1144
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:21.470
What's going through your head and how do you,

1145
01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:23.930
was that particular halftone Free Solo?

1146
01:01:23.931 --> 01:01:26.120
I actually hadn't rehearsed it that much really.
Um,

1147
01:01:26.121 --> 01:01:29.720
I'd sort of intentionally chosen not to rehearse the root very much cause I was

1148
01:01:29.721 --> 01:01:31.310
like,
oh,
that's going to take the adventure out of it.

1149
01:01:31.311 --> 01:01:32.600
I want to just go up there and do it.

1150
01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:37.780
Which in retrospect like wasn't the best idea.
But so,
uh,

1151
01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:41.300
yeah,
on halftime I didn't,
I hadn't memorized the sequences.

1152
01:01:41.301 --> 01:01:43.280
I didn't really know like exactly what I should do.

1153
01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:46.340
I just knew that I could do it.
I knew that I'd gone up there and I'd done it.

1154
01:01:46.341 --> 01:01:49.730
It was fine.
And that I was able to,
um,
you know,

1155
01:01:49.731 --> 01:01:51.800
in retrospect I probably should've spent a little bit more time.

1156
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:56.330
And so why I got so scared was I got up to a certain sequence and I basically

1157
01:01:56.331 --> 01:01:58.880
like didn't want to trust a specific foothold.
And I was like,
oh,

1158
01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:01.310
this feels like my foot's gonna slip and I don't want to fall.

1159
01:02:01.790 --> 01:02:04.700
And then I tried to use some other feet,
but I was like,
oh,
this doesn't,

1160
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.120
these are worse.
And you know,
so you're standing there hesitating being like,

1161
01:02:08.121 --> 01:02:11.000
what should I do?
What should I do?
And then you start to get all gripped like,

1162
01:02:11.001 --> 01:02:12.680
Oh God,
what if I can't figure it out?

1163
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:15.050
And like you're obviously getting more and more tired as you stand there.

1164
01:02:15.051 --> 01:02:19.320
Your calves are getting pumped and you know,
yeah,
it's just,
it's traumatizing.

1165
01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:20.483
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1166
01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:25.020
<v 2>Back in action.
So doing a little break,</v>

1167
01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.170
we were just talking about some past lives and uh,

1168
01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:31.500
as mentioned that I wanted to be a comic book.

1169
01:02:31.501 --> 01:02:34.260
Penciler was an illustrator for a period of time paying expenses in college and

1170
01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.150
had this other weird side Gago bouncing,

1171
01:02:36.151 --> 01:02:39.990
which was terrible because I was always the smallest guy,
uh,
as a bouncer.

1172
01:02:39.991 --> 01:02:42.420
But what are the,

1173
01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:46.530
what are the best and worst jobs that you've,
that you had prior to climbing?

1174
01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.910
<v 3>I haven't really had that many jobs.
I mean,</v>

1175
01:02:48.911 --> 01:02:51.790
I worked at the climbing gym as a kid,
um,
just,
you know,

1176
01:02:51.791 --> 01:02:54.430
cleaning the bathrooms and doing summer camp stove with kids.

1177
01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:58.870
And then I worked doing night security at Berkeley for first semester that I was

1178
01:02:58.871 --> 01:02:59.261
there.
I mean,

1179
01:02:59.261 --> 01:03:02.590
I was only at Berkeley for a year and so for my second semester there I was

1180
01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:05.230
doing night security.
I was basically,
it's like walking around campus at night,

1181
01:03:05.231 --> 01:03:07.920
you're getting paid to like look at buildings.
But

1182
01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.640
<v 2>uh,
when you at Berkeley,</v>

1183
01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:16.480
how did you decide to leave and what was that calculus like?

1184
01:03:16.641 --> 01:03:17.474
I mean,
how long

1185
01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:19.790
<v 3>decide to just drop out of Berkeley?</v>

1186
01:03:19.791 --> 01:03:22.850
It was more that I wasn't really happy there.
And then,
um,

1187
01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:28.300
my first year at Berkeley I happened to get second at the national at nationals.

1188
01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:31.130
And so I got invited to the Youth World Cup,

1189
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:35.360
which was during what would have been my second fall semester.

1190
01:03:35.810 --> 01:03:38.990
And so I decided to take the semester off and then go do you know,

1191
01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:42.830
youth worlds and then travel a bit and climb and do whatever.
Um,

1192
01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:47.390
and also my father happened to die the summer after freshman year and he was

1193
01:03:47.391 --> 01:03:49.790
part of the pressure for like going to school and not really pressure,

1194
01:03:49.791 --> 01:03:52.580
but he just sort of like expected the kids to go to college type thing.

1195
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.480
And then when he died it also left life insurance money for my sister and I had

1196
01:03:56.481 --> 01:03:59.760
finished school.
And so,
you know,
that sort of allowed me to not,

1197
01:03:59.761 --> 01:04:03.230
she did not go back to school and so,
uh,
yeah.

1198
01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:06.920
And so just kind of a combination of events just led me to take the semester off

1199
01:04:06.921 --> 01:04:10.850
and then it just like,
you know,
I'm just taking the next 10 or 20 semesters off.

1200
01:04:10.851 --> 01:04:11.660
Since then,

1201
01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:15.710
<v 2>were you close to your dad?
Um,</v>

1202
01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:18.080
I was fairly close to my dad.
I mean,

1203
01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:22.160
or we weren't super close and like talking about things and like having,

1204
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:25.660
having deep chats,
but he definitely infested

1205
01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.430
<v 3>a ton of time in me.
You know,
he took me to the climbing gym all the time.</v>

1206
01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:31.230
He would drive me all over the state to competitions,
you know,

1207
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:33.920
he would taking camping,
take me outside.
Like,
you know,
we,

1208
01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:37.790
we would do be doing family camping trips in the mountains and stuff.
Um,

1209
01:04:38.090 --> 01:04:40.010
so I mean,
he definitely put a ton of energy into me

1210
01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:44.240
<v 2>to you.
And I apologize.
I don't know your status.
Do you want to get married?</v>

1211
01:04:44.241 --> 01:04:47.810
Have Kids?
Um,
yeah,
I think I'd like to have a family someday.

1212
01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:49.430
So that,

1213
01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:54.110
that brings up something that I wanted to talk about and the hesitated to ask in

1214
01:04:54.111 --> 01:04:55.850
part because I'm sure you've been asked a million times,

1215
01:04:55.851 --> 01:04:57.950
but as it relates to mortality,

1216
01:04:58.010 --> 01:05:02.760
let's just say that somebody came to you because this is kind of two in one,
uh,

1217
01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:04.970
they said I have

1218
01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:10.850
$10 million and I'm going to dedicate to you,

1219
01:05:10.851 --> 01:05:11.940
but with the following conditions,

1220
01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.120
you have to predict how you're going to die accurately.

1221
01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:17.890
And in that case it goes to the cause of your choosing.

1222
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:22.300
<v 3>So what would you predict and what caused me to go to,</v>

1223
01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:27.220
um,
that's interesting.
And if I predict wrong,

1224
01:05:27.221 --> 01:05:31.390
it just like doesn't go into disappears.
Oof.
Um,
okay.
Um,

1225
01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:36.700
I dunno.
I mean I think I would predict,
I don't know,

1226
01:05:36.701 --> 01:05:38.710
I'm sort of 50,
50 between natural causes,

1227
01:05:38.711 --> 01:05:40.270
just like dying of old age at some point.

1228
01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:44.950
Or like climbing accident in the grander scheme of like,
not necessarily,

1229
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:46.990
um,
you know,
like falling to my death,

1230
01:05:46.991 --> 01:05:50.380
which is what people think with a free soloing.
But just the random stuff like,

1231
01:05:50.381 --> 01:05:50.561
you know,

1232
01:05:50.561 --> 01:05:53.680
repelling in the mountains are like being swept by an avalanche or like being

1233
01:05:53.681 --> 01:05:56.860
hit by a random rock because there's a lot of just like random chance or not a

1234
01:05:56.861 --> 01:05:57.161
lot,

1235
01:05:57.161 --> 01:06:00.460
but there is random chance chance involved with climbing and just the fact that

1236
01:06:00.461 --> 01:06:02.110
I am out climbing all the time.

1237
01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:05.140
Like it wouldn't be shocking of some random thing just happened to me like that.

1238
01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:10.030
Um,
though,
I mean that's kind of the,
the,
you know,
price price to play,
you know,

1239
01:06:10.031 --> 01:06:11.620
like if you're going to be in those places,

1240
01:06:11.621 --> 01:06:15.720
like there is just a random random risk associated with it.
Um,

1241
01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:20.030
so yeah,
I mean I think and then the cause I would devote it to,
um,
I dunno,

1242
01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.640
some probably environment.

1243
01:06:21.641 --> 01:06:24.450
I mean basically the stuff that I'm supporting through my foundation,
which is a,

1244
01:06:24.451 --> 01:06:27.310
you know,
any kind of environmental project that like improve standard of living,

1245
01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:31.210
which has mostly been like off grid solar projects are like energy access and

1246
01:06:31.211 --> 01:06:35.370
stuff for off grid solar energy excess for,
for whom or wherever,

1247
01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:36.131
like rural communities.

1248
01:06:36.131 --> 01:06:39.460
I mean I've been supporting a group that does that kind of work in Africa,
which,

1249
01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:41.590
you know,
makes sense cause folks have no access to energy.

1250
01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:44.620
And we've also been supporting grid alternatives here in the states,

1251
01:06:44.621 --> 01:06:49.060
which does a like home PV systems for like low income families.
Um,

1252
01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:51.460
basically it's just a way to like help,
you know,

1253
01:06:51.461 --> 01:06:54.920
folks that need some help and it helps the environment obviously.
And

1254
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:59.680
just we took a break.
You were talking about,
we were talking,

1255
01:06:59.681 --> 01:07:04.060
talking about books and the fact that you read mostly nonfiction,
uh,

1256
01:07:04.930 --> 01:07:07.150
what nonfiction books have had a,

1257
01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:11.380
had an impact on you or do you particularly like?
Um,

1258
01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:13.510
I mean in the last several years,
I mean,

1259
01:07:13.511 --> 01:07:15.760
some of the most noteworthy books I've read,

1260
01:07:15.761 --> 01:07:19.600
I guess I'm like a People's history of the u s the Howard Zinn book totally

1261
01:07:19.601 --> 01:07:23.690
changed the way I look at politics.
Um,
and then in the same way,
uh,

1262
01:07:23.691 --> 01:07:26.890
I read a book recently called sacred economics that totally changed the way I

1263
01:07:26.891 --> 01:07:30.790
looked at economics.
Sacred Economics.
Yeah.
It was actually totally understand.

1264
01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:34.470
I forget who the author was now though.
I didn't know.
I will,

1265
01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:35.740
we will look it up and you should,

1266
01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:39.700
you should have shown a sacred economics was like kind of awesome.
It like,
yeah,

1267
01:07:39.701 --> 01:07:43.330
it changed my world event.
But uh,
what's,
what are the,

1268
01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:46.780
what's this kind of basic thesis of sacred economics or is it,
um,

1269
01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:49.510
I don't know what the author would say pieces,
but um,

1270
01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:52.690
but the things that I took away from it,
we're,
well,

1271
01:07:52.691 --> 01:07:56.890
I mean basically he sort of envisioning different systems for like a more just

1272
01:07:57.070 --> 01:07:59.290
kind of economics,
you know?
Cause I mean current,

1273
01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:04.120
our current style of capitalism basically just concentrates wealth in the hands

1274
01:08:04.121 --> 01:08:07.570
of the already wealthy,
you know,
I'm in,
that's kind of like by definition,

1275
01:08:07.571 --> 01:08:09.670
the way interest rates work and stuff.
Like if you have a lot,

1276
01:08:09.671 --> 01:08:10.960
you'll just continue to make a lot.

1277
01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:14.470
And that's not a fundamentally fair system because if you don't have anything,

1278
01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:17.210
you continue nothing.
But if you already have more than you need,

1279
01:08:17.211 --> 01:08:18.500
you just get more and more and more.

1280
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:21.320
And that's just not the way the world should work,
I don't think.

1281
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:23.240
Or at least I don't,
I don't know.

1282
01:08:23.241 --> 01:08:25.280
So one of the ideas that he throws out in the book,

1283
01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:30.160
which I found totally understand was like negative interest rates.
So like,
um,

1284
01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:31.130
if you have a lot,

1285
01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:34.220
it basically just like slowly dwindles away unless you're actively using it for

1286
01:08:34.221 --> 01:08:37.150
things like investing it into things.
So,
you know,

1287
01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:40.260
just by having a lot of money is not going to guarantee that you continue to

1288
01:08:40.261 --> 01:08:43.670
have a lot of money unless you're allocating it in.
Exactly.

1289
01:08:43.671 --> 01:08:46.130
Unless you're using it wisely to like create value.

1290
01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:51.760
But how do you assess risk,

1291
01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:55.880
whether that's with a,
and you can,
you can focus on one of these,

1292
01:08:55.910 --> 01:09:00.200
but whether that's on a particular climb on like a business venture,

1293
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:05.230
a decision to do a versus B,
how do you,
how do you think about risk?
Uh,

1294
01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:07.220
Eh,
I don't know.

1295
01:09:07.230 --> 01:09:09.500
That's an interesting question because obviously I spent a ton of time thinking

1296
01:09:09.501 --> 01:09:13.040
about risk,
but I just don't have like a clear cut,
you know,

1297
01:09:13.041 --> 01:09:15.340
like I don't have clear metrics for like,
Oh,
you know,

1298
01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:17.600
this is because with the climbing,

1299
01:09:17.601 --> 01:09:21.020
so much of it comes down to a feeling of like I feel a lot of fear when I think

1300
01:09:21.021 --> 01:09:25.630
about that.
Obviously it's not for me.
Um,
but yeah,
I don't,

1301
01:09:25.631 --> 01:09:28.640
I don't know exactly and I've never really had to evaluate business ventures and

1302
01:09:28.641 --> 01:09:31.850
things.
So when I,
so let's touch on something you just said,

1303
01:09:31.851 --> 01:09:34.520
which is if you're very afraid of something,

1304
01:09:35.210 --> 01:09:38.870
then that's something you shouldn't do.
So do you then climb,

1305
01:09:40.730 --> 01:09:45.380
say hard routes in an absence of fear or is it present and then you overcome it?

1306
01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:50.390
That's a good question.
Um,
I genuinely climb hard roots in the absence of fear.

1307
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:55.340
I generally don't go up on them unless I feel comfortable and I don't have that

1308
01:09:55.341 --> 01:09:59.900
fear.
Yes,
though.
Yeah.
Though,
I mean,

1309
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:03.260
it's important to sort of differentiate fear and risk and like all the terms I

1310
01:10:03.261 --> 01:10:06.850
guess.
Definitely because,
um,
you know,

1311
01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:09.950
I mean if there is a high level of risk,
I mean you should be feeling fear.

1312
01:10:09.951 --> 01:10:12.230
I mean fear is sort of that warning that you know,

1313
01:10:12.231 --> 01:10:16.270
like that there is real danger.
And so like if there is danger president,

1314
01:10:16.271 --> 01:10:20.180
like I mean you should be feeling fear and so,
you know,

1315
01:10:20.181 --> 01:10:23.210
and there are times and maybe you should just suppress that fear and go for it

1316
01:10:23.211 --> 01:10:25.700
anyway.
Maybe not,
I don't know.
But so with the free soloing,

1317
01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:29.730
typically if I'm feeling a lot of fear then um,
I just,
you know,

1318
01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:31.400
wait and prepare more or I don't know,

1319
01:10:31.401 --> 01:10:35.060
some do whatever it takes to mitigate that,
to like to feel comfortable and then,

1320
01:10:35.061 --> 01:10:39.140
and then do the cloud.
When I feel comfortable in,
do you have a,
my,

1321
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:43.190
my suspicion says no,
but do you have eight a checklist?
Like,

1322
01:10:43.191 --> 01:10:47.900
I have to do this with gear x number of times and then do this y number of times

1323
01:10:47.901 --> 01:10:52.430
before I'm willing to free solo this or is it just don't have a checklist.

1324
01:10:52.431 --> 01:10:57.431
But I definitely have a degree of comfort that I need to feel on the route

1325
01:10:57.711 --> 01:11:00.530
before I'm willing to solid.
What does that feel like?

1326
01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:04.550
It just feels like a certain,
I guess I need to have a certain amount of reserve,

1327
01:11:04.551 --> 01:11:05.331
I guess.
You know,
I,

1328
01:11:05.331 --> 01:11:10.200
I need to feel like I can climb the route in a variety of conditions,
um,
and,

1329
01:11:10.210 --> 01:11:12.950
and have some extra in the tank just in case,
you know,

1330
01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:16.860
like if I can climb the route only by the narrowest of like razor thin margins.

1331
01:11:16.861 --> 01:11:18.750
Like,
I mean that's probably not good enough for free soloing.

1332
01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:20.620
<v 2>And,
uh,</v>

1333
01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:25.590
the definitions point is important.
So for instance,

1334
01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:29.040
I'm involved with a lot of speculative startups or startups,

1335
01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:31.000
whether spec specter all speculative,

1336
01:11:31.610 --> 01:11:34.890
but most of them would be considered very highly speculative.
And people say,
wow,

1337
01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:39.630
that's a really high risk investment.
You have a very high risk tolerance,
right?

1338
01:11:39.631 --> 01:11:43.140
Doing things in entrepreneurship and so on.
And I've never felt that way.

1339
01:11:43.141 --> 01:11:47.970
I actually feel like I'm focused on risk mitigation at all times.

1340
01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:52.440
Uh,
and uh,
so for me I thought about it at one point cause they're like,
oh,

1341
01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:54.710
you have really high risk tolerance,
risk,
risk risk.
And I was like,

1342
01:11:54.711 --> 01:11:55.351
well wait a second.

1343
01:11:55.351 --> 01:11:58.740
Like we should try to figure out the definition of this term that we're using

1344
01:11:58.741 --> 01:12:01.220
before we have a discussion then it isn't,
the thing that started

1345
01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:03.950
<v 3>this is that you're sort of willing to lose money on a certain number as long as</v>

1346
01:12:03.951 --> 01:12:05.870
the,
exactly.
So I'm come out.
Right,
exactly.

1347
01:12:05.871 --> 01:12:08.240
So I assume you're sort of just doing the math on the overall picture.

1348
01:12:08.241 --> 01:12:09.680
It's like it doesn't matter if some of them fail.

1349
01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:11.170
<v 2>That's exactly right.</v>

1350
01:12:11.171 --> 01:12:15.790
And what what's important at least in that game right is or that sport,

1351
01:12:15.791 --> 01:12:18.460
and you can look at it that way,
is following your own rules.

1352
01:12:18.490 --> 01:12:23.490
Like if you set rules and you understand say portfolio theory and the math if I

1353
01:12:24.461 --> 01:12:28.630
follow these rules,
is going to,
is going to turn out likely this way,

1354
01:12:28.631 --> 01:12:30.850
therefore I need to make x number investments.

1355
01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:34.050
<v 3>Yeah.
Or at least having like a plan that you're willing to stick to and not,</v>

1356
01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:37.290
and then not start to just go hog wild where you're like,
well,
this guy said that

1357
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:39.690
<v 2>and you're like,
DVM.
Yeah,
exactly.
So,</v>

1358
01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:44.600
so what I realized for myself that risk in my mind is the likelihood of an

1359
01:12:44.601 --> 01:12:47.540
irreversible negative outcome.
And if I look at it that way,

1360
01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:51.830
if I do something that fails,
if I can get back to where I was very easily,

1361
01:12:51.831 --> 01:12:55.750
then that's not a risk.
It's not a high risk.
For instance.
Do you,
uh,

1362
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:59.960
<v 3>do you think you relate to risk or think about it differently than other people?</v>

1363
01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:03.680
Um,
no,
I mean all of that.
It's pretty much in line with the way I look at risk.

1364
01:13:03.681 --> 01:13:05.750
I mean,
yeah,
I mean with the startup stuff,

1365
01:13:05.751 --> 01:13:07.840
I wouldn't consider it up particularly risky because like,

1366
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:09.800
obviously people make a lot of money off startups.

1367
01:13:09.801 --> 01:13:12.380
It's just a matter of like doing it well and like,
you know,

1368
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:13.940
playing the stock market and things like that.

1369
01:13:13.941 --> 01:13:15.080
People obviously make a lot of money,

1370
01:13:15.081 --> 01:13:17.030
so it's not like a fundamentally risky activity.

1371
01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.550
It's just a matter of like how you do it,
how well you do it.

1372
01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:22.100
And obviously I'm not in either of those worlds.
That also,

1373
01:13:22.101 --> 01:13:25.280
I mean for me it probably would be dangerous because you know,
I'd be like,

1374
01:13:25.281 --> 01:13:28.520
well no I have no money,
but it's because that's not my thing.
Like I don't,

1375
01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:29.600
I don't know anything about it.

1376
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:32.690
<v 2>What is the best decision you've ever made?</v>

1377
01:13:32.691 --> 01:13:36.740
Not to do something or a good decision that you've made not to do something?

1378
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.801
<v 3>Well,</v>

1379
01:13:37.801 --> 01:13:40.860
I think pretty much any of the free solos that are backed off of and climbed

1380
01:13:40.861 --> 01:13:43.770
down,
we're probably all pretty good decisions.
I mean,
who's to say,

1381
01:13:43.771 --> 01:13:46.350
I mean maybe they all would have been fine and I would've just like climb to the

1382
01:13:46.351 --> 01:13:48.630
top and have a nice day.
But you know,

1383
01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:51.300
there's no point in second guys and that stuff.
I mean,
if you're not psyched you,

1384
01:13:51.301 --> 01:13:53.080
and I was like,
uh,

1385
01:13:53.850 --> 01:13:57.180
but I haven't had any like clear or like near misses where I decided not to

1386
01:13:57.181 --> 01:13:58.890
climb something.
And then there's like a huge avalanche.

1387
01:13:58.891 --> 01:14:02.630
The sweeps the whole mountain and you're like,
thank God I wasn't up there.
Uh,

1388
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.010
you have very minimalist lifestyle.
Uh,

1389
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:08.070
what is,

1390
01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:12.010
<v 2>what is something that you spent too much but don't regret</v>

1391
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:17.140
<v 3>or something that you spend too much on but don't regret or a lot on too much is</v>

1392
01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:21.860
too judgemental.
Um,
I,
I dunno,
I don't think it's too much,
but um,

1393
01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:24.790
when I bought noise canceling headphones,
I was like,
this seems really indulgent,

1394
01:14:24.791 --> 01:14:26.440
but it made my life so much better.

1395
01:14:26.710 --> 01:14:28.810
Like I love traveling with noise canceling headphones.

1396
01:14:29.050 --> 01:14:32.520
It's like my favorite possession of thing.
How do you use them?
I just saw me,

1397
01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:33.580
I cancel noise with them.

1398
01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:40.140
Do you use them all the time when you're traveling or are they sending the

1399
01:14:40.150 --> 01:14:41.440
airport and on the plane?

1400
01:14:41.441 --> 01:14:44.140
I pretty much have noise canceling headphones on the whole time.
I love it.

1401
01:14:44.141 --> 01:14:47.920
I'll just like listen to soft music and like read my book or working on my

1402
01:14:47.921 --> 01:14:49.810
computer,
do whatever,
you know,
just hang out.

1403
01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:53.410
But I just like love not having all the crazy bustly noise around me the whole

1404
01:14:53.411 --> 01:14:57.640
time.
What type of music do you listen to?
Most often when you're flying?

1405
01:14:58.230 --> 01:15:00.010
I'm flying,
I do a lot of soundtracks,

1406
01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:02.910
like so it's sorta like classically type music but you know,

1407
01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:06.020
set to Indiana job but say or whatever.
And brave heart.

1408
01:15:06.610 --> 01:15:09.790
Actually I've never done the papers out drag but like last Mohicans as a

1409
01:15:09.791 --> 01:15:13.020
favorite.
That's a great contract.
Yeah.
Uh,

1410
01:15:13.810 --> 01:15:16.970
do you ever climb to music?
Um,

1411
01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:20.110
I'll do easy climbing to music for sure.
Um,

1412
01:15:20.111 --> 01:15:22.690
I normally just have my phone in my pocket and we'll just blast it like,

1413
01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.650
you know,
stereo style.
Um,

1414
01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:27.370
but that's only if I'm climbing something where there's nobody around.

1415
01:15:27.371 --> 01:15:30.310
And cause I think it's super annoying when you hike up to people on a trail,

1416
01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:31.420
like a boombox going,

1417
01:15:31.470 --> 01:15:34.750
cause obviously it's like dementia in their outdoor experience.
What do you,

1418
01:15:34.751 --> 01:15:37.430
in this cases,
what type of music do you listen to?
Um,

1419
01:15:37.431 --> 01:15:40.720
I pretty much only listened to like modern rock,
like hate rock and stuff.

1420
01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:45.100
Like what I said,
but like what can,
what can events,
oh,
I dunno.

1421
01:15:45.130 --> 01:15:47.950
Like I was listening to like bad religion.

1422
01:15:48.130 --> 01:15:50.480
We listened botanical as not in the drive and like,
you know,

1423
01:15:50.530 --> 01:15:53.800
I'm not sure bell or tool or random whatever.

1424
01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:57.670
What is something that people,

1425
01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:03.100
and this is in in quotes know about you that is wrong?
I don't know.

1426
01:16:03.101 --> 01:16:06.100
I mean I think a lot of people,
I mean certainly online commentary,

1427
01:16:06.101 --> 01:16:09.310
a lot of people think I have a death wish or like have never experienced fear.

1428
01:16:09.311 --> 01:16:12.100
Like just don't,
don't care about my safety.

1429
01:16:12.101 --> 01:16:14.170
I mean the thing is that if you just watched youtube videos,

1430
01:16:14.171 --> 01:16:17.800
you get the impression that I just like walk up to a wall and climate and like

1431
01:16:17.801 --> 01:16:21.520
you sort of miss the 20 years of climbing culture that's behind it.
You know,

1432
01:16:21.521 --> 01:16:22.354
the fact that I've,

1433
01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:25.090
that there's a huge history behind all these routes and I know a lot about,

1434
01:16:25.091 --> 01:16:27.190
I'm going,
I have tons of friends that have climbed them and I can,

1435
01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:30.370
I could like recite half the moves on them from memory.
You know what I mean?

1436
01:16:30.370 --> 01:16:33.250
Like there's a ton that goes into other people like don't see you in a three

1437
01:16:33.251 --> 01:16:35.860
minute youtube short and yeah,

1438
01:16:36.150 --> 01:16:39.670
well it's to like head Laird Hamilton on the podcast,
right?

1439
01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:42.490
The sort of undisputed King of Big Wave Surfing people would,

1440
01:16:43.150 --> 01:16:47.170
it's funny how people look at that and they have a different judgment than when

1441
01:16:47.171 --> 01:16:51.650
they look at you on a wall.
Even though in practical terms you think having,

1442
01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:54.370
don't people look at his big wave surfing and be like,
that guy's crazy.

1443
01:16:54.371 --> 01:16:57.570
He has a death wish.
Well,
cause I kind of do.
I'm like that.
So it looks like,

1444
01:16:58.030 --> 01:17:01.200
so I think that it's slightly the degree,

1445
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:05.080
the frequency with which p I hear people say that it's different because they

1446
01:17:05.081 --> 01:17:07.450
look at a wall and they're like,
oh,
I could climb up things,

1447
01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:10.160
but they look at eight the hundred foot wave and

1448
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.530
<v 2>somebody's getting towed in on a jet ski and they're like,</v>

1449
01:17:12.531 --> 01:17:15.470
I wouldn't even be able to stand up on the board while getting pulled on Jetski

1450
01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:19.490
therefore assumption,
assumption,
assumption.
Uh,

1451
01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:25.190
what do you think of say a free divers who tried to break records in free

1452
01:17:25.191 --> 01:17:25.730
diving?

1453
01:17:25.730 --> 01:17:27.200
<v 3>I mean,
I,
I don't know much about it,</v>

1454
01:17:27.201 --> 01:17:30.140
but it does seem like it's one of the riskiest sports in the world.
I mean,

1455
01:17:30.141 --> 01:17:33.340
more people die doing that then virtually anything else?
Yeah,

1456
01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:36.710
I mean it kind of goes with the wing suiting or something where like,
you know,

1457
01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:40.040
it's fair to say that it actually is quite risky because people do actually die

1458
01:17:40.041 --> 01:17:44.780
all the time doing it.
Have you ever done any wingsuit stuff?
Um,
no.
I did my iff,

1459
01:17:44.781 --> 01:17:47.900
so I learned how to,
to parachute out of a plane,
um,

1460
01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:50.750
on the thought that I would maybe eventually learn how to base jump or
something.

1461
01:17:50.751 --> 01:17:52.760
And then I was basically just like,
I'm not into this.
I'm like,

1462
01:17:52.761 --> 01:17:55.850
I don't think this is cool.
I don't like it.
Just the,
just because the risk,

1463
01:17:55.880 --> 01:18:00.740
the downside risk.
No,
I mean,
outside of,
um,
no,
a skydiving,
it was not dangerous,

1464
01:18:00.741 --> 01:18:02.330
you know?
So I mean,
when you're learning out of the plane,

1465
01:18:02.331 --> 01:18:05.210
like it's not sketchy at all.
But mostly I was like,
I just don't like this,

1466
01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:05.781
you know?
And like,

1467
01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:08.120
I don't want to devote the energy to like learning how to do this.

1468
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:10.630
And I sort of realized how much it would take for me to,

1469
01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:14.300
to feel comfortable doing that.
And I was like,
this is just dom,
I'm not into it.

1470
01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.700
Yeah.
And then as it turns out,
um,
you know,

1471
01:18:16.701 --> 01:18:19.160
like one of my good friends and climbing partners died wing suiting and then

1472
01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:23.210
last year a notably dean potter died wing suiting.
And so I mean,
you know,

1473
01:18:23.211 --> 01:18:26.750
climbing has lost a lot of high end climbers to wing suiting accidents.

1474
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:29.210
It's like,
yeah,
I mean it is a very dangerous activity.

1475
01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:34.910
<v 2>Uh,
image and dean potter.
Do you slow the,
I mean I think when I hear his name,
uh,</v>

1476
01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:37.850
I also associated with sidelining.
Exactly.
Slap biting.

1477
01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:42.320
You seem to have the perfect slacklining feet.
I'd,

1478
01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:44.750
I mean maybe we take a photograph there new most of,
yeah,

1479
01:18:44.751 --> 01:18:49.460
you got some amazing like functional feet.
Do you slack lines?

1480
01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:54.840
That's a very kind way,
but it deformed highly functional.
Yes.
Do you slack?

1481
01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:56.080
Do you slack line or what's your opinion?

1482
01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:57.920
<v 3>Mine like a low level,
you know,</v>

1483
01:18:57.921 --> 01:19:00.790
I can like walk the lines back and forth just because there's so many slack

1484
01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.020
lines in campgrounds and climbing areas and things.
You know,

1485
01:19:03.021 --> 01:19:06.070
I definitely have done a fair amount of slacklining and I can do some like

1486
01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:08.060
really easy tricks and things.
But,
but no,

1487
01:19:08.061 --> 01:19:11.060
I'm definitely not a sock liner and I've never done any high lines and I'm not

1488
01:19:11.061 --> 01:19:12.440
like,
I'm not in the slacklining.

1489
01:19:12.690 --> 01:19:14.190
<v 2>When you think of the word successful,</v>

1490
01:19:14.191 --> 01:19:18.330
who's the first person who comes to mind for you?
When I hear successful?
Yeah,

1491
01:19:18.331 --> 01:19:19.500
just the word successful.

1492
01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:23.580
<v 3>I mean when you just set it up Elon Musk,
but that like,
I have no idea,
you know,</v>

1493
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:25.830
like,
cause I don't know,
but I don't know that much about business,

1494
01:19:25.850 --> 01:19:27.000
but I'm just like,
that's Rad.

1495
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:29.690
<v 2>But is there a,</v>

1496
01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:35.860
is there anyone that you would want to model your life after in any way?

1497
01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:38.800
<v 3>Um,
probably not,</v>

1498
01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:43.860
but do I do like reading a biography or something and then sort of like,

1499
01:19:44.861 --> 01:19:47.620
I have some notes on my phone of like lists from random things I've read,

1500
01:19:47.650 --> 01:19:48.760
you know,
where you sort of choose it,

1501
01:19:48.761 --> 01:19:50.890
a lessons out of like a book about somebody and you're like,
oh,

1502
01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.900
like that person did these things well,

1503
01:19:52.901 --> 01:19:55.570
and those are all things that I could apply to my life.
But,
you know,

1504
01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:58.660
I wouldn't want to model my whole life.
I'm somebody.
It's more like,
you know,

1505
01:19:58.661 --> 01:19:59.800
Cherry picker and a good lesson

1506
01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:00.753
<v 2>here and there,</v>

1507
01:20:02.350 --> 01:20:06.280
which biographies have produced a lot of notes for you.

1508
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:08.220
We'll just do this a few times.

1509
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:08.341
<v 3>But,</v>

1510
01:20:08.341 --> 01:20:13.341
so I read the biography of a Brad Washburn who was like a big deal if you know

1511
01:20:13.651 --> 01:20:17.130
him.
He was like,
I don't wanna ask explorer photographer.
He also ran the,

1512
01:20:17.710 --> 01:20:21.540
like a natural history museum and in Boston I think.
Um,

1513
01:20:22.130 --> 01:20:25.170
but so he just had like a wide and varied career and he was like a national

1514
01:20:25.171 --> 01:20:28.050
geographic explorer type.
You know,
he just did a lot with his life.

1515
01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.810
And so after I finished reading the book,
I was like,
Whoa,

1516
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:34.980
this kind of like got shit done,
you know?
And I don't know,
you know,

1517
01:20:34.981 --> 01:20:37.440
I respect that.
And so I just like Kinda thought about it.

1518
01:20:38.670 --> 01:20:41.370
What is something that you believe that other people think is crazy?

1519
01:20:43.410 --> 01:20:46.830
That I believe that other people think is crazy.
Why don't,
I mean,

1520
01:20:46.831 --> 01:20:49.410
I think that my evaluation of risk and all of the things we were just talking

1521
01:20:49.411 --> 01:20:54.150
about a lot of people think is totally crazy.
Um,
but that speaking,
I mean,

1522
01:20:54.151 --> 01:20:57.150
I think it's because they don't have a full set of facts on it.
You know,

1523
01:20:57.151 --> 01:21:00.360
that they don't quite appreciate it in the same way that I do.
But

1524
01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:05.360
I don't know if I have any other like totally outlandish beliefs like that.

1525
01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:08.610
I know you,
uh,

1526
01:21:10.510 --> 01:21:11.850
I'm sure you've had this question before,

1527
01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:16.170
but would you consider yourself a religious person give a particular belief

1528
01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:17.310
system?
No,

1529
01:21:17.311 --> 01:21:22.311
I'm like strongly atheist and just like not into religion at all.

1530
01:21:23.010 --> 01:21:25.160
Were your parents religious at all?
Um,
yeah.

1531
01:21:25.170 --> 01:21:29.910
Mom has at least used to identify as Catholic as she'd probably still say that

1532
01:21:29.911 --> 01:21:32.130
she believes in God though there's no evidence of it at all.
You know,

1533
01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:35.940
like she doesn't go to church anymore or do anything.
But um,
yeah.

1534
01:21:35.941 --> 01:21:37.920
So as kids we were taking a church,

1535
01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:42.420
but at no point did I ever believe anything.
Okay.

1536
01:21:42.421 --> 01:21:46.380
So there was no sort of transitionary period?
It was,
no,
I know,
it's funny,

1537
01:21:46.381 --> 01:21:47.820
like even though we were being taken to church,

1538
01:21:47.821 --> 01:21:50.430
I just always thought it was all a bunch of weird stories.
You're just like,

1539
01:21:50.431 --> 01:21:51.750
it made no sense to me.
I'm like,

1540
01:21:51.751 --> 01:21:54.750
why would you believe in some invisible thing that,
you know,
I'm like,

1541
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:58.050
why would you ever believe any of that?
Like it doesn't make any sense.

1542
01:21:58.620 --> 01:21:59.453
It's weird.

1543
01:21:59.550 --> 01:22:02.070
It's weird that so many adults believe all that stuff cause it still doesn't

1544
01:22:02.071 --> 01:22:02.904
make any sense.

1545
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.780
There's a lot of stuff that doesn't make a lot of sense that people believe to

1546
01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:09.880
the theater of politics and all sorts,
you know.
Well,
you know,
but,
uh,

1547
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:13.680
this is going to be a gear shift.
I mean,
I mean,
where she had a lot of years.

1548
01:22:13.681 --> 01:22:18.660
I'm grinding out the transmission of gears,
but,
uh,
food I want to talk about.

1549
01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:23.990
Do you have any particular thoughts on food or how do you think about eating

1550
01:22:24.670 --> 01:22:28.860
yourself of not literally eating yourself yet?

1551
01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:30.451
Uh,
I mean,

1552
01:22:30.451 --> 01:22:34.680
I'm not much of a cook and I don't like love food or food prep or anything,

1553
01:22:35.010 --> 01:22:35.880
you know,
I mean,
if I could,

1554
01:22:35.881 --> 01:22:39.120
I would just like take a pill and be like fully fully fed all day,

1555
01:22:39.121 --> 01:22:42.270
every day and just be like,
sweet.
I don't have to do worry about it.
But,
um,

1556
01:22:43.230 --> 01:22:47.550
I dunno.
I mean in the last couple years have gone vegetarian,
um,

1557
01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:48.540
which has more to do with all,

1558
01:22:48.541 --> 01:22:50.520
like the environmental nonfiction I've been reading.

1559
01:22:50.521 --> 01:22:53.730
It's more just as like one of the few things that I can do as an individual to

1560
01:22:53.731 --> 01:22:58.410
like really have an impact on the world.
Um,
but yeah,
I don't know.
I mean,

1561
01:22:58.470 --> 01:23:02.100
do you have any,
uh,
give any goto dinners?

1562
01:23:02.101 --> 01:23:05.770
Like what are your most common dinners?
What do they look like?
Um,

1563
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:08.350
I mean for all the years that I've lived in the van,

1564
01:23:08.351 --> 01:23:12.050
one of my go to dinners was like Mac and cheese with,
with stuff in it,
you know,

1565
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:14.060
like adding a vegetable,
you stat tuna to it a lot.

1566
01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:16.840
Then I've switched to just like vegetables or you know,

1567
01:23:16.841 --> 01:23:18.280
maybe some beans or whatever.

1568
01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:21.880
You're like Mac and cheese and chili though.

1569
01:23:21.881 --> 01:23:24.130
Now I'm sort of easing life from the Mac and cheese too cause I've kind of

1570
01:23:24.131 --> 01:23:26.790
stopped eating dairy but so like,
you know,

1571
01:23:26.910 --> 01:23:31.540
rice and vegetable stuff or like lentils or whatever.
Keeping it simple.

1572
01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:35.860
Yeah.
So many questions.
So many questions I want to ask.

1573
01:23:35.861 --> 01:23:39.670
Do you have any morning rituals?
Like what are the first 60 days,
60 days,

1574
01:23:39.671 --> 01:23:42.380
the first 60 minutes of your day?
Um,

1575
01:23:42.490 --> 01:23:46.030
like pretty much always just get up and have like a big breakfast and then go

1576
01:23:46.031 --> 01:23:47.620
climbing.
That's kind of the standard.

1577
01:23:47.621 --> 01:23:50.650
When is Zoe will wake up for the last two months I've been waking up and doing

1578
01:23:50.651 --> 01:23:53.290
some 15 minutes of stretching,
then eating my breakfast,

1579
01:23:53.291 --> 01:23:57.130
then going climbing just because of the back stuff.
But,
um,

1580
01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:02.170
what time do you generally wake up and go to bed?
Um,
I generally,

1581
01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:05.680
I'm pretty unstructured,
so I basically just go to sleep whenever I'm,

1582
01:24:06.130 --> 01:24:08.110
whenever I need to or whenever it makes sense.

1583
01:24:08.111 --> 01:24:11.740
Then I just wake up whenever I tried to sleep as much as I want to.

1584
01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:16.360
What does that mean?
People think they're like,
oh,
that four hour work week guy.

1585
01:24:16.361 --> 01:24:19.620
Like I'm asleep three hours a night.
I tried to sleep eight to 10 maybe.
Yeah.
No,

1586
01:24:19.630 --> 01:24:21.640
I'm all about the eight to 10 for sure.
I think last night,

1587
01:24:21.641 --> 01:24:23.170
I mean I was sleeping in front of her house last night.

1588
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:25.670
<v 7>I think I slept nine last night.</v>

1589
01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:29.980
Well because the second that the van,
yeah,

1590
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:32.810
that's my walking my dog and I was like,

1591
01:24:33.290 --> 01:24:37.540
who's camped out in front of my house?
Yeah.
No,
that is fucking hilarious.
Okay.

1592
01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:39.900
Yeah,
we'd like the reflectors in the way.
I was like,
dude,

1593
01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:43.820
who is trying to kid that?
Me?
Who is my rape wagon porch in front of your house?

1594
01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:46.730
What was,
it's one of the things like,
you know,
we drove to San Francisco

1595
01:24:47.410 --> 01:24:48.071
<v 3>and then I'm like,</v>

1596
01:24:48.071 --> 01:24:50.350
well I don't want to park somewhere else and then have to drive here in the

1597
01:24:50.351 --> 01:24:51.280
morning.
So I was like,

1598
01:24:51.281 --> 01:24:53.890
I'm just going to go park there and went to sleep as late as possible.

1599
01:24:53.891 --> 01:24:56.470
I'm going to wake up and I'm going to come in and do a podcast and be like,

1600
01:24:56.471 --> 01:24:58.960
totally chill it from,
from what?

1601
01:24:58.990 --> 01:25:01.780
That's the thing about living in a car is you're all about minimizing the waste

1602
01:25:01.781 --> 01:25:03.820
of time.
You know?
There's no point in like driving around in circles.

1603
01:25:03.821 --> 01:25:07.960
You just park where you need to be,
sleep and then do your thing.
That's amazing.

1604
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:10.990
All right,
so the thing is after,
and I've lived in a van for like 10 years now,

1605
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:12.910
you know,
it starts to become routine.

1606
01:25:12.911 --> 01:25:14.890
It's like hard to imagine like going to a hotel,

1607
01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:16.300
moving all your shit into a room,

1608
01:25:16.301 --> 01:25:18.610
moving it back into your car later moving the car.
You're just like,

1609
01:25:18.611 --> 01:25:20.620
what a waste of time.
I just want to like park where I need to be.

1610
01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:24.640
A lot of people have asked this and I'm kind of curious myself,

1611
01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:27.730
like the logistics of Alex Honnold.

1612
01:25:27.731 --> 01:25:32.500
So if you have a date date goes well,
what?
Then they come back to the band.

1613
01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:36.970
I mean he's a nice man.
It's like a,
you call it a little mini home or whatever,

1614
01:25:36.971 --> 01:25:39.730
you know,
want a micro home stuff or what's it called?
The tails.
Yeah.

1615
01:25:39.731 --> 01:25:42.670
Tiny town with a bunch of tiny home books rather than go see I have one off

1616
01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:45.630
front.
Sit down before you go out on the day.

1617
01:25:45.631 --> 01:25:48.580
Do you like just in case this goes well,
do you put out like,
like,

1618
01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:51.530
like some rose petals in a bowl of water or like no preference profit.

1619
01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:56.310
We'd go back to their place,
middle class here.
Uh,

1620
01:25:58.750 --> 01:26:02.760
do you have any favorite documentaries or movies?
Um,

1621
01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:06.620
I dunno.
Not Particularly,
I guess.
Um,
I mean,

1622
01:26:06.621 --> 01:26:10.340
my movie tastes runs who are just straight like a Hollywood action movie,

1623
01:26:10.341 --> 01:26:13.160
like total fluff,
you know,
like gladiator or something.

1624
01:26:13.670 --> 01:26:17.570
Just like fun times.
Like,
yeah.

1625
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:21.200
Roger.
All right,
well we'll keep,
we'll keep that.
It's all pretty.
Yeah,

1626
01:26:21.201 --> 01:26:26.180
it's all just pretty like unimpressive.
But it's a kind of,
because like movies,

1627
01:26:26.210 --> 01:26:28.400
cause I do a lot of like reading nonfiction and stuff.

1628
01:26:28.401 --> 01:26:30.660
I feel like movies fill the fluff category,
you know,

1629
01:26:30.661 --> 01:26:34.070
like I hate heavy nonfiction or like heavy documentary type films.

1630
01:26:34.071 --> 01:26:34.990
I'd just like fall asleep to,

1631
01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.760
there's too much thinking after all the intersection,

1632
01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:41.720
what movies have you seen the greatest number of times?

1633
01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:46.040
Is there anything you've watched like over and over again?
I have that habit.
Um,

1634
01:26:46.041 --> 01:26:48.470
I've probably seen the star wars movies a lot,
a lot of times,

1635
01:26:48.471 --> 01:26:50.630
but that's partially just because I started running as a kid and then I'm like

1636
01:26:50.631 --> 01:26:55.070
rewash them over the years.
Um,
I dunno if I've seen anything else.

1637
01:26:55.071 --> 01:26:56.450
Like more than that probably.

1638
01:26:56.460 --> 01:27:01.130
I think I have maybe weird numbers because for each of my books I get very,

1639
01:27:01.131 --> 01:27:04.880
I feel very isolated if I'm writing at night in a dark house by myself.

1640
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:09.110
So I always put it on certain movies,
movies for each book.

1641
01:27:09.111 --> 01:27:12.560
They're usually one or two movies that I'll just put on repeat and I'll put them

1642
01:27:12.561 --> 01:27:17.561
on me that and then listen to music like the same tracks over and over and over

1643
01:27:17.631 --> 01:27:21.050
and over again.
Just brain might be like hardwired in some weird ways here.

1644
01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:23.300
That's definitely true.

1645
01:27:24.270 --> 01:27:28.500
Tweaking the same recommendation from this.
Uh,

1646
01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:31.200
very,
very,
very uh,

1647
01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:35.540
brilliant and capable entrepreneur named Matt Mullenweg who's of great coder and

1648
01:27:35.541 --> 01:27:39.410
he always,
he listens to the same single track over and over again,

1649
01:27:39.411 --> 01:27:42.860
almost like a noise machine when he's coding.
And I thought,
okay,

1650
01:27:42.861 --> 01:27:45.980
well I'll try that with writing.
And it worked really,
really well.

1651
01:27:45.981 --> 01:27:49.550
But the Moody's end up being really weird because yes it will movies we were

1652
01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:53.300
taught so well for the four hour work week.
It was the,
this isn't that weird.

1653
01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:54.530
I think these are fine movies,

1654
01:27:54.531 --> 01:27:59.531
but the Bourne identity was the first and then for the four body it was casino

1655
01:28:01.311 --> 01:28:04.760
rail,
which I think is fantastic.
And you're going to say like rocky or something,

1656
01:28:04.761 --> 01:28:07.390
like it'd be a nonstop training montage was while we were there,

1657
01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:10.410
a lot of fight scenes and the park core sequence in the beginning,
uh,

1658
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:15.180
with Sebastien.
Incredible.
That's,
yeah,
that's,

1659
01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:18.740
that's a whole separate,
I didn't know.
Oh,
oh yeah.
So that's cool.

1660
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:23.420
And then for the four hour chef,
this is super,

1661
01:28:23.630 --> 01:28:25.670
this is off theme completely,

1662
01:28:25.671 --> 01:28:30.200
but I was just looking for a movie when I was just getting started and on Amazon

1663
01:28:30.201 --> 01:28:32.150
Prime,
the first movie that popped up was babe,

1664
01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:37.840
a little pig farmer hogget pigment like a thousand times because I just put it

1665
01:28:37.971 --> 01:28:41.270
on repeat and watch it like four or five times a night.
Whoa.
Go figure.
Yeah,

1666
01:28:41.271 --> 01:28:45.500
we could psychoanalyze that.
Uh,
hardcore hardcore.

1667
01:28:45.501 --> 01:28:48.380
Aside from the noise canceling headphones,

1668
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:53.060
what purchase has most positively impacted your life in the last,

1669
01:28:53.630 --> 01:28:58.050
say,
six months?
Definitely my van.
Definitely your man.
I mean,
no question.
Yeah,

1670
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:59.660
I mean,
the last fan that,
uh,
you know,

1671
01:28:59.661 --> 01:29:03.840
I bought a $10,000 and lived in it for 10 years and then,
uh,

1672
01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:06.750
this new van that I bought,
it's the new van.
So it's obviously a bit pricier,

1673
01:29:06.751 --> 01:29:10.080
but it's like pretty awesome.
I'll probably live in there for another 10 years.

1674
01:29:10.650 --> 01:29:14.070
Well,
maybe not actually live in it,
but you know,
it'd be based out of it.

1675
01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:18.590
<v 2>Uh,
again,
returning to the,
uh,
this is,</v>

1676
01:29:18.591 --> 01:29:21.620
this is not directly related to the dating and the van,
but this is,

1677
01:29:21.621 --> 01:29:25.150
this is a question from Michael Supriano.
Uh,

1678
01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:29.510
I've always found climbing to have a large positive effect on my libido.
Do you,

1679
01:29:29.550 --> 01:29:31.340
does Alex find this to be the case?

1680
01:29:31.610 --> 01:29:33.650
<v 3>Well,
I've climbed for my entire life.
So I mean,</v>

1681
01:29:33.651 --> 01:29:36.390
maybe it explains to the permanent and this

1682
01:29:40.370 --> 01:29:43.370
is that for real?
That's a real like question I guess.
I don't know.

1683
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.880
But I mean that's probably true of anybody who's like staying active and staying

1684
01:29:46.881 --> 01:29:48.290
fit and you know,
you know,
you're just like,

1685
01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:52.670
it's the way your body's supposed to work.
Yeah.
Are there

1686
01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:58.180
<v 2>ways that you've seen lessons learned or skills developed and climbing translate</v>

1687
01:29:58.701 --> 01:30:01.130
to other parts of your life?
And if so,

1688
01:30:01.131 --> 01:30:03.620
does any edge or any particular examples come to mind?

1689
01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:06.360
<v 3>Um,
I don't know exactly.
I mean,</v>

1690
01:30:06.361 --> 01:30:08.640
so I've gained a lot from being a professional climber,

1691
01:30:08.641 --> 01:30:11.760
like having to go and give talks and like do the whole work site of climbing.

1692
01:30:11.761 --> 01:30:14.700
I mean that's really like helped me grow as a person and feel comfortable doing

1693
01:30:14.701 --> 01:30:16.110
public speaking and all that kind of stuff.

1694
01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:19.500
Though I think from the actual climbing itself,

1695
01:30:19.501 --> 01:30:22.440
maybe the most useful thing I've gotten has been sort of being able to

1696
01:30:22.441 --> 01:30:24.150
differentiate,
you know,

1697
01:30:24.151 --> 01:30:27.360
risk and consequence and fear and like all these different things and sort of

1698
01:30:27.361 --> 01:30:30.720
being able to separate my feelings from what's actually happening.
You know,

1699
01:30:30.721 --> 01:30:32.040
like oh I feel fear.

1700
01:30:32.041 --> 01:30:35.100
But is that fear justified because I'm actually in danger or is that like

1701
01:30:35.101 --> 01:30:38.760
totally irrational fear that I should just squish and like move forward with

1702
01:30:38.761 --> 01:30:40.590
something and I don't,
I don't know.
I mean,

1703
01:30:40.591 --> 01:30:43.830
I feel like climbing has sort of helped me understand like the different things

1704
01:30:43.831 --> 01:30:45.030
that are going on there,
you know?

1705
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:47.790
Whereas I feel like a lot of people are just like,
oh,
I'm afraid.

1706
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:51.000
And then they're just like,
Oh God,
I'm afraid.
You know?
But sometimes like,
I mean,

1707
01:30:51.001 --> 01:30:55.090
fear shouldn't necessarily control you any more than anything else,
you know,

1708
01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:59.340
desire or fill in the blank.
You know,
when you're really hungry,
you're not like,

1709
01:30:59.370 --> 01:31:01.620
Oh God,
I'm hungry,
I'm hungry,
I'm hungry.
You're just like,
oh,

1710
01:31:01.621 --> 01:31:03.090
I'll eat lunch in two hours.
You know?

1711
01:31:03.091 --> 01:31:06.120
And I feel like fear to some extent it should be the same way where you can just

1712
01:31:06.121 --> 01:31:08.040
register it like,
oh,
I'm feeling fear right now.

1713
01:31:08.490 --> 01:31:10.860
But sometimes that doesn't matter.
I mean,

1714
01:31:10.861 --> 01:31:13.770
sometimes it does and you need to be like,
oh,
you know,
I'm about to die.

1715
01:31:13.771 --> 01:31:16.830
Like I should watch out for that.
But,
but a lot of times,
I mean,

1716
01:31:16.831 --> 01:31:19.380
you should be able to just set that fear aside and just do exactly what you're

1717
01:31:19.381 --> 01:31:24.090
supposed to be doing.
Yeah.
So I mean,
in a way,
when you're a connoisseur of fear,

1718
01:31:24.091 --> 01:31:28.880
I mean you can,
you can distinguish sort of the varietals.
Yeah,
totally.

1719
01:31:29.530 --> 01:31:31.910
Yeah.
When you experienced enough fear in your life,
you're like,
no.

1720
01:31:31.911 --> 01:31:35.070
And now I can sort of differentiate between all the different types.

1721
01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:39.270
Do you drink coffee or caffeine?

1722
01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:42.740
No though I don't have,
I just don't like coffee.
Um,

1723
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:45.630
and I don't really like tea and,
but I don't have any problem with caffeine.

1724
01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:47.510
I don't really even notice caffeine.

1725
01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:51.270
I don't think that much cause you get it in like shot blocks and gels and goos

1726
01:31:51.271 --> 01:31:52.710
and whatever.
All the little energy products,

1727
01:31:52.711 --> 01:31:54.230
like some of them have caffeine and some don't.

1728
01:31:54.231 --> 01:31:56.580
And I don't feel like I notice an effect either way.

1729
01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:59.980
Well the reason I asked is that I personally,

1730
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:02.530
<v 2>I remember I did a three day meditation retreat,</v>

1731
01:32:02.531 --> 01:32:05.650
my first meditation retreat and they disallowed caffeine.

1732
01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:08.950
I said no caffeine and no alarm clocks.
You wake up when you wake up.

1733
01:32:09.370 --> 01:32:13.210
And when I came in my life was 20 year meditation.

1734
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:16.510
Yeah I need to do more of that.

1735
01:32:16.511 --> 01:32:21.511
And I came back from that experience and went back into my normal routine,

1736
01:32:21.551 --> 01:32:24.640
which was drinking,
not coffee at that point,
but a lot of ice tea.

1737
01:32:24.641 --> 01:32:27.460
Like I'd go to a restaurant and they would just endlessly refill my state.

1738
01:32:27.461 --> 01:32:30.880
And I felt like a complete crack head,
like a miserable crack.
And I was like,

1739
01:32:31.570 --> 01:32:34.540
is this what my normal was?
Holy Shit.

1740
01:32:34.541 --> 01:32:39.541
And the reason that I brought it up is that it strikes me that at least in that

1741
01:32:40.631 --> 01:32:41.260
state,

1742
01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:45.670
I would have a lot of trouble distinguishing the fine nuances of different

1743
01:32:45.710 --> 01:32:48.110
<v 3>types of things.
Cause you're just overwhelming.</v>

1744
01:32:48.111 --> 01:32:51.530
You're all jacked up on sugar from IC stuff and then you're like caffeine and

1745
01:32:51.531 --> 01:32:52.700
who knows.
Yeah,
totally.

1746
01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:55.850
There's like a lot going on physiologically and it's hard to differentiate like

1747
01:32:55.851 --> 01:32:59.330
what the,
what the finer points are.
Yeah.
The signal from the noise

1748
01:33:01.390 --> 01:33:04.570
<v 2>at what climbing grades have you plateaued the most?</v>

1749
01:33:04.571 --> 01:33:07.060
This is from Liz Wolfe and she's,

1750
01:33:07.061 --> 01:33:09.820
she just said five 11 plateau has been really bad for me,

1751
01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:13.780
<v 3>which probably means she hasn't got past the five.
Let me blessed.</v>

1752
01:33:14.140 --> 01:33:17.630
She's just like mired in five 11,
nine.
Um,
no.
So I've basically,

1753
01:33:17.810 --> 01:33:21.710
I pretty much progressed steadily to about mid five,
14.

1754
01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:25.430
It's like 14 BRC and I've basically been plateaued there for like seven or 10

1755
01:33:25.431 --> 01:33:27.350
years or something.
Um,

1756
01:33:28.610 --> 01:33:32.910
though I feel like I've sort of Plateau there because I'm at the point.
Um,

1757
01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:36.020
I mean cause mid five 14 is definitely a fairly high level of climbing though.

1758
01:33:36.021 --> 01:33:39.230
It's by no means elite by the world standard anymore.
Like that's not,

1759
01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:41.600
that's not like super hard.
Just to put it in perspective what it,

1760
01:33:41.601 --> 01:33:45.110
what would be the hardest thing in the world is 15 c but only two people have

1761
01:33:45.111 --> 01:33:45.830
climbed that.

1762
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:49.340
But there are a lot of people climbing like 15 [inaudible] and 15 [inaudible]

1763
01:33:49.370 --> 01:33:54.350
now.
And so climbing like 14 B or c is like,
you know,
respectable.

1764
01:33:54.410 --> 01:33:57.560
But a lot of people can do that.
Like first try,
no PR,
not a lot,

1765
01:33:57.561 --> 01:33:59.960
but a handful of people can climb that first try.
No problem.

1766
01:33:59.961 --> 01:34:02.480
It's like trivial for them.
So you know what I mean?
It's not,

1767
01:34:03.170 --> 01:34:05.990
it's by no means world standard,
but you know,
it's,
it's solid.

1768
01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:08.900
But so I think that for me that's sort of my natural plateau.

1769
01:34:08.901 --> 01:34:13.901
Like that's kind of what I can climb without having to train much to climb

1770
01:34:14.181 --> 01:34:14.661
harder.
You know,

1771
01:34:14.661 --> 01:34:17.570
because the thing is I spend a lot of my year doing like adventure trips and

1772
01:34:17.571 --> 01:34:19.280
expeditions and you know,

1773
01:34:19.670 --> 01:34:22.010
doing stuff through my foundation and going to ankle last year.

1774
01:34:22.011 --> 01:34:24.170
I mean trips like that that do not help your fitness at all.

1775
01:34:24.171 --> 01:34:25.520
Like they won't help you climb harder,

1776
01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:28.370
but they definitely make you a more well rounded climber and probably a better

1777
01:34:28.371 --> 01:34:31.910
person and more understanding you had to do fun stuff.
And so you know,

1778
01:34:31.911 --> 01:34:35.270
I've heard have been content being plateaued at that mid five 14 for a long time

1779
01:34:36.050 --> 01:34:38.840
though I could see at some point in my life I might devote a year or two to like

1780
01:34:38.841 --> 01:34:41.150
actually trying to climb hard cause I'd love to climb the,

1781
01:34:41.151 --> 01:34:44.480
the French grade nine a which has 14 d and u s grades.
Um,

1782
01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:47.780
it's just sort of like a meaningful benchmark grade that if I ever climbed nine,

1783
01:34:47.781 --> 01:34:50.990
eight I'd be like respect.
Like I'm good.
Like that's,
that's hard enough

1784
01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:53.840
<v 2>for me.
So if you wanted to do that hard climbing,</v>

1785
01:34:54.230 --> 01:34:57.050
what would the most important components of that training look like?

1786
01:34:58.530 --> 01:35:00.770
<v 3>Um,
I'm not totally sure.
I mean,</v>

1787
01:35:00.771 --> 01:35:03.230
I think for me it would require more finger boarding or hang boarding,

1788
01:35:03.231 --> 01:35:05.870
like basically just focusing more on finger strength because I think as a

1789
01:35:05.871 --> 01:35:08.930
climber that's probably what I'm worst at is just like the pure strength holding

1790
01:35:08.931 --> 01:35:10.450
onto things.
Um,

1791
01:35:10.490 --> 01:35:14.900
but also I think for me it would just require more dedicated focused,

1792
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:16.700
the hard climbing for the year.
You know,

1793
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.960
like right now I'm climbing in Yosemite and a in my whole season of climbing you

1794
01:35:20.961 --> 01:35:24.550
70,
I won't do a single hard move basically at the,
you know,

1795
01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:27.290
at the physical limit of like what I can actually pull on because I'm climbing

1796
01:35:27.291 --> 01:35:29.960
these,
that great big walls and I'm trying to climb the quickly and sometimes I'm

1797
01:35:29.961 --> 01:35:31.670
climbing them rope lists.
But anyway,
I'm doing,

1798
01:35:31.671 --> 01:35:34.670
I'm an all these styles that like just doesn't help you pull harder.

1799
01:35:35.150 --> 01:35:37.790
And so like if I wanted to climb harder grades,
I would have to just pull harder.

1800
01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:45.260
<v 2>If you could no longer climb but had to pick a physical activity,</v>

1801
01:35:46.261 --> 01:35:47.130
what would you pick?

1802
01:35:48.690 --> 01:35:50.130
<v 3>If I couldn't climb?
I don't know.</v>

1803
01:35:50.131 --> 01:35:53.010
I have a lot of respect for ultra runners I think.
Um,

1804
01:35:53.070 --> 01:35:55.740
because they sort of interact with the landscape in the same way that I kind of

1805
01:35:55.741 --> 01:35:56.311
liked to,
you know,

1806
01:35:56.311 --> 01:35:59.580
like the something like the ultra two or mobile when you like run all the way

1807
01:35:59.581 --> 01:36:02.580
around the MONTBLANC messy.
I mean that's pretty cool.

1808
01:36:02.581 --> 01:36:04.620
And like I would love to be able to do things like that,

1809
01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:08.760
but I just like don't really,
I can't run that well,
but um,

1810
01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:12.510
but the thing is is that I really love running like mountain ridge lines and

1811
01:36:12.511 --> 01:36:16.260
things and then that quickly becomes actual rock climbing.
And so I'm like,
well,

1812
01:36:16.261 --> 01:36:20.380
it's like,
I dunno.
But yeah,
ultra running is pretty awesome.
Um,

1813
01:36:20.910 --> 01:36:25.110
I dunno,
I can be ended like big mountain skiing too.
Like same,

1814
01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:28.080
but see it all sorta gravitates back towards mountains and I'm like,

1815
01:36:28.081 --> 01:36:29.460
well that's basically climbing.

1816
01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:33.210
<v 2>When did you get exposed to nasty things like avalanches for those of you who</v>

1817
01:36:33.211 --> 01:36:37.080
haven't seen marrow?
Jesus.
Jimmy,
both of you guys make me sweat.

1818
01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:41.300
Not that I needed any help.
I have tend to run hot drink a tea anyway,
but uh,

1819
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:47.790
yeah,
I digress.
As usual.
Uh,
what are you world class at,

1820
01:36:47.791 --> 01:36:52.140
aside from climbing or within climbing that people might not realize?

1821
01:36:53.230 --> 01:36:58.170
Um,
or how would your best friends answer that question?
I don't know.
I mean,

1822
01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:01.750
I guess one that within climbing I'd say that,
um,

1823
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:04.080
<v 3>cause I'm known as a free soul,</v>

1824
01:37:04.081 --> 01:37:06.910
just I'm known for the rope was climbing and that's like what you'll see online

1825
01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:08.390
and you know,
all the videos and all that.

1826
01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:11.990
But I'd probably still be a professional climber even if I didn't free solo at

1827
01:37:11.991 --> 01:37:16.130
all.
Um,
like right now I hold the speed record on like pretty much every major

1828
01:37:16.131 --> 01:37:19.760
formation.
And you,
somebody,
um,
you know,
all the different faces,

1829
01:37:19.761 --> 01:37:24.750
like all the classic routes.
Um,
I,

1830
01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:29.060
I mean I think that's basically true.
And so,
yeah,
I don't know.

1831
01:37:29.061 --> 01:37:32.750
I mean I'd probably still be like one of the more well rounded climbers in

1832
01:37:32.751 --> 01:37:36.080
America,
even without the free soloing.
But,
um,

1833
01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:39.040
but it's all sort of overshadowed by the like,
oh my God,
he's Rueplus.

1834
01:37:39.770 --> 01:37:43.250
And it's funny because I only do,
you know,
a handful of solos a year if that.

1835
01:37:43.730 --> 01:37:46.820
And then I spend the whole rest of the year climbing with partners and ropes and

1836
01:37:46.821 --> 01:37:48.320
like normal climate with my friends.

1837
01:37:48.810 --> 01:37:51.770
Just like doing all kinds of interesting things and expeditions and whatever.

1838
01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:55.730
And yet it still just comes down to like,
Whoa,
free soloing.
But you know,

1839
01:37:55.810 --> 01:37:58.380
I'm fine with that because at least I could do a climb all the time.

1840
01:37:59.730 --> 01:38:02.790
What advice would you give to your 25 year old self?

1841
01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:05.640
25 or 20 depending on who needed it the most.

1842
01:38:06.150 --> 01:38:09.090
And if you could just place like what you were doing and where you were at the

1843
01:38:09.091 --> 01:38:13.980
time.
Well 20 is still slightly too old,
but like my 18 year old self,

1844
01:38:13.981 --> 01:38:17.700
I should just tell them.
I would say it does not bother going to college at all.

1845
01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:20.790
Cause like the year that I spent at Berkeley,
it was a total waste of my time.

1846
01:38:20.791 --> 01:38:23.340
Basically.
Not,
not because there's anything wrong with Berkeley,

1847
01:38:23.341 --> 01:38:26.430
but because I just wasn't passionate about what I was studying.
And there's no,

1848
01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:26.930
there,

1849
01:38:26.930 --> 01:38:29.790
there was no point in me like grinding out a year of studies that I didn't care

1850
01:38:29.791 --> 01:38:33.120
about that,
you know,
I should have just like gone call me.

1851
01:38:33.890 --> 01:38:35.400
Cause I mean that's what I really cared about.

1852
01:38:35.670 --> 01:38:38.670
And that's what's been so funny over the years is that like with climbing,

1853
01:38:38.970 --> 01:38:41.940
you know,
I have no problem putting in,
you know,

1854
01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:46.620
20 to 40 hours a week,
every week,
all year and declining like,

1855
01:38:46.621 --> 01:38:49.770
and I mean that's a fair amount.
I,
I've been keeping a trading journal.
Um,

1856
01:38:49.771 --> 01:38:53.390
so I have like sort of hours of exercise and last year,
um,

1857
01:38:53.730 --> 01:38:56.140
I counted up at the end of the,
at the new year and a,

1858
01:38:56.150 --> 01:38:59.850
I basically averaged like 27 hours a week of exercise every week last year,

1859
01:38:59.910 --> 01:39:03.090
which is,
you know,
like,
I think that's kind of comparable to others.
I mean,

1860
01:39:03.091 --> 01:39:06.450
you would know more than me,
but other sports like for training volume.

1861
01:39:06.690 --> 01:39:07.450
But I mean,

1862
01:39:07.450 --> 01:39:09.740
and then when you think that I've probably been doing that for the last 10
years.

1863
01:39:09.770 --> 01:39:10.770
I've been on the road and actually,

1864
01:39:10.771 --> 01:39:14.070
and last year was a particularly low volume year for me because I had a book

1865
01:39:14.071 --> 01:39:16.620
come out and so I did a month of book touring and I also did like a month of

1866
01:39:16.621 --> 01:39:17.640
touring and South America.

1867
01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:19.980
And so like I was climbing much less than I normally would.

1868
01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:24.120
So presumably a few years ago living in the van I was probably doing like 30,

1869
01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:26.520
probably 30 or 32 hours a week of exercise,

1870
01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:29.520
which is like a lot of times spent climbing and has a lot of time.

1871
01:39:29.521 --> 01:39:33.540
But what else do you put in your trading journal?

1872
01:39:34.260 --> 01:39:37.590
What other details are in there?
Um,
it's one lot.

1873
01:39:37.591 --> 01:39:40.650
I do one line hours of exercise,
one line,
um,

1874
01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:43.890
any additional like strength training type stuff or like the stretching on the

1875
01:39:43.891 --> 01:39:47.250
new recently and then one line diet,
which is like eight,

1876
01:39:47.251 --> 01:39:51.240
well eight poorly eight toso or like,
you know,
too many cookies,
like whatever,

1877
01:39:51.241 --> 01:39:53.790
things like that.
Do you go back to you,
you don't have cookies?

1878
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:58.290
Sometimes of an unfortunate.
What's what's,
what's your go to cookie?

1879
01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:00.090
Should I just talk to him?
Could you just like straight?

1880
01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:04.260
I can eat a lot of cookies.
Yeah.

1881
01:40:04.290 --> 01:40:07.740
Well that's probably the only thing that athletically it will not that we share

1882
01:40:07.741 --> 01:40:11.440
in common.
Oh yeah.
Do you go big on the cookie too?
Yeah.
There's,

1883
01:40:11.470 --> 01:40:13.660
you're looking towards your car.
While I was looking at it,

1884
01:40:13.690 --> 01:40:17.480
it's like secret stash.
I have to keep it at a site.
Yeah.

1885
01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:20.530
There are these chocolate chip cookies,
uh,

1886
01:40:20.670 --> 01:40:23.400
that are actually from long island Tate's.
I think they are.

1887
01:40:23.890 --> 01:40:27.220
There's going to be like nodding over there with important chocolate chip cookie

1888
01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:31.050
originally from Long Island and they have theirs.
They're chocolate chip cookies.

1889
01:40:31.051 --> 01:40:31.884
Then there are these,

1890
01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:36.920
I think they're gluten free ginger cookies and I can't have those in my house or

1891
01:40:37.290 --> 01:40:38.160
demolish the,

1892
01:40:38.161 --> 01:40:41.310
that's my thing with desserts too is I don't really buy it as much because if I

1893
01:40:41.311 --> 01:40:44.160
buy it,
I just eat it all immediately.
Like I'm terrible with moderation.

1894
01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:47.040
So I generally don't have any dessert in the van.
And then when I do,

1895
01:40:47.041 --> 01:40:47.874
I just eat it all.

1896
01:40:51.870 --> 01:40:54.070
If you were to,
I know this

1897
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:56.950
<v 2>is,
this is a bit of a reach,
but you're 30 now,</v>

1898
01:40:57.820 --> 01:41:01.900
let's say your idealized 40 year old self,
right?

1899
01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:06.010
Uh,
what advice do you think that 40 year old would give you now?

1900
01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:09.820
<v 3>I Dunno.
I mean I feel like I'm doing pretty well right now.</v>

1901
01:41:10.090 --> 01:41:14.830
I'm not saying you're not just,
yeah,
no I don't.
I Dunno.
I mean just,
you know,

1902
01:41:14.831 --> 01:41:17.860
just enjoy the ride,
enjoy the process.

1903
01:41:18.450 --> 01:41:21.850
<v 2>Uh,
what would you like to your life to look like in 10 years?</v>

1904
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:24.450
<v 3>Um,
I don't know.</v>

1905
01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:28.010
I mean maybe have a family or something or at least like a solid partner,

1906
01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:30.680
solid something going on.
Um,

1907
01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:33.920
I think I'd like to maybe own a home or like have,

1908
01:41:34.250 --> 01:41:39.050
have a place that I'm kind of living like more of a solid home base just because

1909
01:41:39.051 --> 01:41:42.500
like living in a van is great,
but you know,
at a certain point you're like,
man,

1910
01:41:42.501 --> 01:41:47.310
it's nice to have like a bathroom,
but I'm having like a shower things.

1911
01:41:47.690 --> 01:41:50.320
How do you deal with that?
And actually now that,

1912
01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:55.170
that's why when I came into your house,
I use your bathroom.
That's getting less.

1913
01:41:55.450 --> 01:41:58.130
So like last night you're like,
Oh man,
I had too much water.
I have no,

1914
01:41:58.131 --> 01:41:58.761
I have a pee bottle.

1915
01:41:58.761 --> 01:42:01.070
I mean you know I've used a bottle forever and actually the thing is when you

1916
01:42:01.071 --> 01:42:02.510
get used to using a pee bottle all the time,

1917
01:42:02.511 --> 01:42:04.670
like when I pull into a grocery store or something,

1918
01:42:04.671 --> 01:42:06.770
I always just like p and my bottle before I go into that,
you know,

1919
01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:10.460
cause you're like why would I ever go and find some like Dank public bathroom

1920
01:42:10.461 --> 01:42:14.140
when like I can just use my bottle.
It's like,
do you have,
do you have a,

1921
01:42:14.210 --> 01:42:17.740
is it a disposable pee bottle?
Like a tsunami I use,

1922
01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:19.880
I use like a two liter bottle,

1923
01:42:19.881 --> 01:42:22.970
just like some random plastic bottle and I basically use it over and over until

1924
01:42:22.971 --> 01:42:26.390
it's like this is repulsive.
And then I recycle it and then I move on to another.

1925
01:42:26.690 --> 01:42:28.190
But it's actually kind of that this is natural.

1926
01:42:28.191 --> 01:42:32.690
It's the natural life cycle because I'll use the same water bottle for climbing.

1927
01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:35.840
It'll just be like some random two liter bottle that's in my bag for like
months.

1928
01:42:36.030 --> 01:42:39.010
And then eventually it starts to get disgusting or just kind of,
you know,

1929
01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:40.190
a little gross.
And so then I'm like,
well,

1930
01:42:40.191 --> 01:42:42.260
that becomes the pee bottle and then I get another bottle.

1931
01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:46.210
It's like the four month cycle on my bottles,
you know.

1932
01:42:46.710 --> 01:42:51.630
Do you label them or do you know?
Yeah,
with a pee bottle.
You just know,
like,

1933
01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:55.010
you know,
when you open a bottle you're like,
oh,
I can drink this.

1934
01:42:56.150 --> 01:42:58.520
But also I've systems with like where things go and you know,

1935
01:42:58.521 --> 01:43:03.030
I'm never going to accidentally like drink my people on them.
Uh,

1936
01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:06.080
do you have,
do people visit you in your van?

1937
01:43:06.081 --> 01:43:09.350
Like hang out in your van aside from the dates?
Um,
yeah,
no,
I mean,

1938
01:43:09.351 --> 01:43:10.700
friends hanging out in my van for sure.
I mean,

1939
01:43:10.701 --> 01:43:13.310
a lot of my climbing friends would be staying in a tent,

1940
01:43:13.311 --> 01:43:14.540
normally are staying wherever.

1941
01:43:14.541 --> 01:43:16.700
So I mean for them it's a big step up to hang out in the van.

1942
01:43:16.701 --> 01:43:19.430
It's like climate controlled,
you know,
you can,
it's like sheltered.

1943
01:43:19.431 --> 01:43:21.350
You can cook on a nice stove.
It's lit.
I mean,

1944
01:43:21.351 --> 01:43:22.640
it's a nice place to hang out in the evenings.

1945
01:43:23.210 --> 01:43:27.860
<v 2>Uh,
if you could have one billboard with anything on it,</v>

1946
01:43:28.670 --> 01:43:31.000
what would it say or what would you put on it?

1947
01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:33.920
Just can get a message to the world.

1948
01:43:35.190 --> 01:43:39.220
<v 3>Oh,
I dunno.
I mean,
it's like,
it just like,
I dunno,</v>

1949
01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:42.520
environmental propaganda or something or like,
uh,
the Meta,

1950
01:43:42.530 --> 01:43:45.570
I'm like pretty stuck and all the vegetarian type of stuff now just because it's

1951
01:43:45.571 --> 01:43:50.040
such an easy way to minimize your impact on the planet and it's just,

1952
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:55.630
I mean,
it just solves so many different environmental issues,
but,
um,

1953
01:43:56.300 --> 01:43:57.133
I don't know.

1954
01:43:57.860 --> 01:44:00.950
But the thing is a billboard is not the best way to just say don't eat meat

1955
01:44:00.980 --> 01:44:01.641
because it's like,

1956
01:44:01.641 --> 01:44:04.100
it's obviously a lot more complicated than that and nobody's going to read that

1957
01:44:04.101 --> 01:44:06.080
and be like,
oh,
okay,
I'll stop.
Right.
You know,

1958
01:44:06.530 --> 01:44:09.950
it's like requires more of a conversation.
Yeah.
I mean,

1959
01:44:09.951 --> 01:44:12.680
it requires like a hole in,
and even then it's like,

1960
01:44:12.681 --> 01:44:16.460
it's not in to say that like meat is fundamentally bad.
It's like how you get it,

1961
01:44:16.461 --> 01:44:18.530
where it's from,
what you're supporting.
I mean,
you know,

1962
01:44:18.531 --> 01:44:22.030
it's like a whole feed lot versus this versus,
yeah.

1963
01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:25.130
I mean even that it's like really complicated because there are places in the

1964
01:44:25.131 --> 01:44:26.360
world where it makes sense to,

1965
01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:29.600
to raise animals cause like you can't raise anything else,
you can't grow crops,

1966
01:44:29.601 --> 01:44:32.430
you know,
whatever.
And so,
uh,

1967
01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:37.100
what have you changed your mind about in the last few years,
if anything?

1968
01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:39.313
Um,

1969
01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:44.770
I mean the first thing that comes to mind is like in high school I was reading a

1970
01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:46.970
bunch of iron rand or and rand,
whatever,
you know,
like objectivist,

1971
01:44:46.971 --> 01:44:50.300
all super black and white basically like f the poor people should work harder,

1972
01:44:50.301 --> 01:44:51.140
they should try harder.

1973
01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:55.610
And now as a 30 year old on basically like all about trying to help the poor and

1974
01:44:55.620 --> 01:44:57.440
trying to help the planet in different ways,

1975
01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:01.160
trying to make the world a better place.
It's like a full 180 from,
you know,

1976
01:45:01.161 --> 01:45:04.550
the black and white that I was into it in high school.
And then,
yeah,

1977
01:45:04.551 --> 01:45:06.980
I mean I've had massive changes on all those kinds of things.

1978
01:45:07.220 --> 01:45:10.100
I mean I used to be way more harsh,
you know,

1979
01:45:10.101 --> 01:45:13.820
and like my political views are like way further left now.
I'm just way more,

1980
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:15.800
I mean I'm a lot more compassionate now.

1981
01:45:15.801 --> 01:45:19.100
I feel like those 20 not so much on a personal level cause I don't that you're

1982
01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:21.570
put on like a societal level.
I'm a lot more compassionate.

1983
01:45:22.230 --> 01:45:27.230
It's saying I can't let that one go right away cause I was like,

1984
01:45:27.261 --> 01:45:30.380
I can't self describe as compassionate because none of my friends would agree.

1985
01:45:30.381 --> 01:45:30.621
You know?

1986
01:45:30.621 --> 01:45:34.370
Cause the thing is I've not like nice to like my friends are on like a one on

1987
01:45:34.371 --> 01:45:37.790
one level.
I'm not like a super kind person I don't think.
But um,

1988
01:45:37.970 --> 01:45:41.180
but definitely in the grander sense.
I mean I'm trying to make,
I'm,

1989
01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:45.560
I aspire to make the world a better place and like a more,
more just world,

1990
01:45:45.561 --> 01:45:48.890
you know,
on the macro level.
Yeah,
exactly.
It's still high level.

1991
01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:53.990
So if I took say a couple of your closest friends and gave them a bottle or two

1992
01:45:53.991 --> 01:45:57.960
of wine or just hanging out,
how would they describe you?
Oh,
I dunno,
I

1993
01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:02.720
shutter to think.
Well,
I mean the thing,
I'm pretty frank I think.

1994
01:46:02.721 --> 01:46:07.040
And so people can,
you know,
think I can kind of be a dick sometimes.
And um,

1995
01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:11.220
though I just consider that being very honest.
You know,
we keep it real.
Yeah.

1996
01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:13.250
I'm just keeping it real,
keeping it real.
I mean,

1997
01:46:13.251 --> 01:46:16.550
I'd like to think that my friends would still call me a good person,
you know,

1998
01:46:16.551 --> 01:46:20.370
that I'm still like still trying to,
I'm doing my best to uh,

1999
01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:24.920
give any,
we're going to wrap up here.

2000
01:46:24.921 --> 01:46:29.210
Any ask or request for my audience and that could be something you want them to

2001
01:46:29.211 --> 01:46:31.790
think about.
Somebody you would like them to try something like that to do.

2002
01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:35.950
I feel like they're all MMA fighters.
I'd ask them to ask them not to beat me up,

2003
01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:41.390
but
I should,
I don't know,
do something positive in the world,

2004
01:46:41.460 --> 01:46:44.750
you know,
not a bad place to wrap up.

2005
01:46:44.751 --> 01:46:49.751
Where can people find more of you online place to say hello,

2006
01:46:50.790 --> 01:46:53.000
see what you're up to?
Um,

2007
01:46:53.370 --> 01:46:56.590
I mean my most personal outlet is probably my Facebook fan page and my

2008
01:46:56.591 --> 01:47:00.000
constantly posting stuff that I care about and it's all managed by me.

2009
01:47:00.001 --> 01:47:02.370
And so it was just like me posting articles that I think are interesting.

2010
01:47:02.371 --> 01:47:05.910
It's kind of like a combination of,
of uh,
the climate stuff that I'm into.

2011
01:47:05.911 --> 01:47:07.560
And then like the environmental stuff that I'm into,

2012
01:47:07.890 --> 01:47:10.720
basically I post the environmental stuff is all the stuff I care about.

2013
01:47:10.721 --> 01:47:12.780
And then I post just enough climates that everyone doesn't leave.

2014
01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:16.540
And a is that what,

2015
01:47:16.570 --> 01:47:20.580
what is the URL for that and an approach to the facebook.com/alex Honnold I

2016
01:47:20.581 --> 01:47:23.730
think.
Okay.
But if you just search search word is,
you know,
like a fan page.

2017
01:47:23.731 --> 01:47:27.480
It's like several hundred thousand people or whatever each o.
N.
N.
O.
L.
D.
Yeah.

2018
01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:30.900
Well,
Alex,
I really appreciate you taking the time.

2019
01:47:30.901 --> 01:47:32.490
I've been hoping to meet you for a long time,

2020
01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:37.110
given that we're not that far apart,
oftentimes with a Yosemite.

2021
01:47:37.150 --> 01:47:41.520
So present.
This is,
uh,
this has been fun.
And once I,
once I fixed my elbows,

2022
01:47:41.521 --> 01:47:44.850
maybe I'll see if I can tack.
Yeah,
you should be zero

2023
01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:50.910
and maybe actually getting out of the doors,
which I would enjoy it.
So,
uh,
I will,

2024
01:47:50.911 --> 01:47:51.744
uh,

2025
01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:56.130
hopefully do more than a three day meditation retreat given that you've been

2026
01:47:56.131 --> 01:48:00.570
doing it for 20 years,
but extend my ambition a little bit,
but thanks very much.

2027
01:48:00.571 --> 01:48:01.980
I really appreciate it.
Thanks for having me.

2028
01:48:02.010 --> 01:48:05.160
Pleasure and everybody listening for show notes,

2029

thank you for listening.

2032
01:48:20.330 --> 01:48:23.720
<v 1>Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

2033
01:48:24.050 --> 01:48:26.690
Number one.
This is five bullet Friday.

2034
01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:29.960
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2035
01:48:29.961 --> 01:48:34.100
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

2036
01:48:34.101 --> 01:48:37.670
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

2037
01:48:37.671 --> 01:48:41.990
short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

2038
01:48:41.991 --> 01:48:43.340
pondering over the week.

2039
01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:46.310
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

2040
01:48:46.311 --> 01:48:49.760
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2041
01:48:49.761 --> 01:48:54.080
somehow dug up in the,
uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

2042
01:48:54.350 --> 01:48:59.350
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

2043
01:49:00.050 --> 01:49:02.750
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

2044
01:49:02.810 --> 01:49:07.790
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

2045
01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:10.010
So if you want to receive that,

2049
01:49:24.190 --> 01:49:26.350
This episode is brought to you by headspace.

2050
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:29.800
More than 80% of the people I have interviewed,

2051
01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:34.810
world class performers across the military,
entertainment,
sports,

2052
01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:38.830
and beyond all have some type of meditative practice.

2053
01:49:39.250 --> 01:49:42.010
I tried for years and years and failed miserably.

2054
01:49:42.130 --> 01:49:46.060
The key is making it simple and you can dramatically improve your life in just

2055
01:49:46.061 --> 01:49:47.920
10 minutes a day and can help you.

2056
01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:52.390
This change comes through guided meditation and headspace is by far the most

2057
01:49:52.391 --> 01:49:56.710
popular app for this purpose.
More than 4 million users.

2058
01:49:56.980 --> 01:49:58.360
It's meditation made simple.

2059
01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:01.840
So what I recommend is that you take this practice meditation,

2060
01:50:01.841 --> 01:50:03.700
which is rooted in thousands of years of tradition,

2061
01:50:03.701 --> 01:50:08.701
supported by thousands of scientific studies and try it for 10 minutes a day for

2062
01:50:09.761 --> 01:50:12.010
10 days.
That's all you need to do.

2063
01:50:12.011 --> 01:50:15.790
