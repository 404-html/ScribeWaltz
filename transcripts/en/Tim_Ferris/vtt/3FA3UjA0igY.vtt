1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.850
Optimal at this altitude.

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:06.280
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking it.

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.950
No one else will be posting a question.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.010
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue over another.

5
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.650
<v 2>This episode is brought to you by fresh books,
man.
Oh Man.</v>

6
00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:31.150
Do a lot of listeners of this podcast and readers in mind love fresh books to

7
00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:34.780
the extent that I ended up meeting with the CEO not very long ago.

8
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.880
Why are they so popular?
Well,

9
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.110
they are the number one cloud accounting software designed exclusively for self

10
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.490
employed professionals.

11
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.280
That's many of you and used by more than 10 million people.

12
00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:49.240
You can send invoices,
track your time and get paid very,
very quickly,

13
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.190
which suits the needs of a lot of freelancers,

14
00:00:51.191 --> 00:00:56.110
a lot of Ottawa plunderers and beyond.
You can't take pictures of receipts.

15
00:00:56.111 --> 00:00:57.590
You can link your credit card and debit card,

16
00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:02.410
so all of the things you buy automatically appear in your fresh books in the

17
00:01:02.411 --> 00:01:06.160
right category,
so on and so forth.
Makes taxes easy,
makes invoices easy.

18
00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:10.870
It makes your life easier.
And also in fact,
I would recommend a pdf.

19
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.790
They didn't ask me to read this part by the way.

20
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.650
They'd put the other pdf a while back called breaking the time barrier subtitle,

21
00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:20.650
how to unlock your true earning potential so you can search for breaking the

22
00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:22.900
time barrier.
A lot of people ask me,

23
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.520
how can I get a four hour work week with a service business and the story in

24
00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:31.120
that Ebook,
it's pdf is the short answer is really,
really good.

25
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.910
So I think you should also check that out.
So breaking the time error,

26
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.510
check it out,
but also why not test out freshbooks.

two r's and two s's in the how did you hear about us section?

29
00:01:48.311 --> 00:01:52.840

33
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.610
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

34
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.570
<v 2>This episode is brought to you by audible,
which I've used for many,
many years.</v>

35
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.200
I absolutely love audio books in there.

36
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.330
One of my favorite ways to pass the time when I travel,

37
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.620
I'm on the road all the time in audible allows me to consume many more books

38
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:23.940
than I possibly could otherwise I have to audio books to recommend right off the

39
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:27.930
bat.
The first is perhaps my favorite audio book of all time and it's the only

40
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:30.540
audiobook I've wanted to listen to twice in a row.

41
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.010
The graveyard book by Neil Gaiman.
It's amazing and you will thank me.

42
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.900
There are a few different versions.

43
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.990
I like the version that Neil narrates himself,

44
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.510
one of the most soothing voices of all time.

45
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.250
The second book is vagabonding by Rolf Potts,
p,
o t t,

46
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.940
s which had a huge impact on my life and formed the basis for a lot of what

47
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:53.100
would later become the four hour workweek,

48
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.030
so go to audible.com forward slash Tim and you can choose one of these two books

49

Hello boys and girls.

58
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:32.110
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

59
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:36.940
it is always my job to tease out the habits,
routines,
philosophies,

60
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:38.140
favorite books,
et Cetera,

61
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:42.880
from world class performers so you can test each of those in your own life.

62
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.680
And guests range from say those in business,
sports,

63
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.570
military,
all the way to the esoteric and sometimes a very unexpected.

64
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.250
And this guest checks a lot of boxes.
His name is Nick Savo,

65
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.930
that's s.
Z.
A.
B.
O.
Many of you may not recognize his name,

66
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.940
but hopefully by the end you'll want to know everything that he puts out and

67
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:11.170
read.
Every essay that he puts on the Internet.
He is a polymath.

68
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.490
The breadth and depth of his interests and knowledge are truly astounding and I

69
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:17.320
mean jaw dropping.
It's,

70
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.210
it's just beyond belief what this guy can cover.
He's a computer scientist,

71
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.110
legal scholar and cryptographer best known for his pioneering research in

72
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:31.111
digital contracts and crypto currency and I've long been fascinated by crypto

73
00:04:31.641 --> 00:04:36.641
currency but secretly not really understood anything about it or certainly the

74
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:41.620
subtleties and this episode is really a masterclass so we go from the very,

75
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:46.180
very basic all the way up to the cutting edge and what the future holds.
Nick,

76
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.043
for instance,

77
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.670
developed the phrase and concept of smart contracts with the goal of bringing

78
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:55.720
what he calls the highly evolved practices of contract long practice to the

79
00:04:55.721 --> 00:04:59.860
design of all electronic commerce protocols between strangers on the Internet.

80
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.600
Nick also designed bit gold,
which many consider the precursor to bitcoin.

81
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.800
This particular conversation is co hosted by one of my favorite people,

82
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:10.150
naval Ravikant,

83
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.140
a mutual friend and one of the most successful investors in silicon valley who

84
00:05:14.141 --> 00:05:19.141
also happens to be one of Nick's biggest admirers and a for those who enjoy it.

85
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:21.250
And of all here.

86
00:05:21.251 --> 00:05:26.251
You may also enjoy his first episode with me from 2015 which was voted on

87
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:28.090
product hunt,

88
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.010
the second best podcast episode of the year across all podcasts with the

89
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:36.970
exception of my Jamie Foxx episode,
so you can listen to that if you'd like.

90
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.620
It's called the evolutionary angel episode,
Tim.
Dot.
Blog forward slash,

91
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:42.490
Nepal,

92
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.490
but let's get back to how much we cover with nick because it's a lot and you

93
00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:51.610
need not be intimidated.
You don't need to be a computer scientist.
I am not.

94
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.760
You don't need to know anything about currency.
I know very little,

95
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.400
but we get into the history of money.
We talk about Bitcoin,
what it is,

96
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.340
what cryptocurrencies are and what problems they solve.

97
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.540
We define social scalability.
What is that and why is it important?

98
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.870
What is a theory of what makes it unique?
Strengths and weaknesses.

99
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:10.940
We talked about different types of cryptocurrencies.

100
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:14.870
We talk about things calling for instance,
altcoin.
What the hell is that?

101
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:15.763
We get into it.

102
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:21.190
What are icls initial coin offerings we talked about who might invest or not

103
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:24.770
invest in?
Certainly this is not investment advice.

104
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:26.420
It's for informational purposes only.

105
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:30.680
So talk to your financial professional before allocating resources or money

106
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.900
anywhere.
Okay,
cover my ass.
Good.

107
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.980
How will smart contracts actually get adopted to go mainstream?
Right?

108
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.890
If you think of,
say bitcoin is something that is very fringe,

109
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.900
when will it hit the tipping point?

110
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:45.680
What might the elements be that would lead to that blockchain governance?

111
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.270
Is there any existential risk?

112
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.950
Could governments or regulators shut down something like bitcoin?

113
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.430
What is what code versus dry code?
This is a super,

114
00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:58.100
super cool distinction that I really enjoyed.

115
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.550
What are Pascal's scams or quantum thought?

116
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.940
We dig into all sorts of nooks and crannies including what's nick might work on

117
00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:11.060
in the future,
what fields does he want to explore and so on.

118
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.270
So this was to me a really,

119
00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:16.790
really fun and mind expanding conversation.

120
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:20.660
You do not need to be technical or an engineer to enjoy it and get a lot out of

121
00:07:20.661 --> 00:07:25.310
it.
Because at the core we are really looking at how to people who are very,

122
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:29.810
very smart,
meaning nick and Laval process the world,

123
00:07:29.811 --> 00:07:34.811
what lenses they use to view the world and how that dictates their actions and

124
00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:38.480
how they get better results.
So if you want more from nick,

125
00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:40.580
and we'll talk about this at the very end of the conversation also,

126
00:07:40.581 --> 00:07:42.980
but you have to check out the essays on his blog,

127
00:07:42.981 --> 00:07:44.750
which is called [inaudible] numerated,

128
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:49.810
it's on a numerated.blogspot.com but that can wait for later.

129
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.660
And then you will know why many of the thought leaders in Silicon Valley and

130
00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:57.740
around the world really pay a lot of attention to neck.

131
00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:58.880
So without further ado,

132
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.610
please enjoy this wide ranging conversation with Nick Sabo.

133
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.790
<v 3>All Right,
gentlemen,
I think the hour has arrived.</v>

134
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:14.180
[inaudible] welcome back.
Thank you.
It's good to be back.
Once again.
Nick.

135
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.860
Pleasure to meet you.
Nice to me.

136
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:21.010
And I'm very excited and also intimidated by the conversation we're about to

137
00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:24.290
have as context for people listening.

138
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:28.840
We're going to delve into some subjects I have an acute interest in,
but,
uh,

139
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.350
extreme ignorance of,

140
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.490
so I will let them all do a lot of the driving and,
uh,

141
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.920
I figured to place we could start is at the beginning at least where you guys

142
00:08:39.921 --> 00:08:42.850
met.
So how did you two first connect?
Yeah,

143
00:08:42.851 --> 00:08:46.570
like most of my close relationships these days,
I formed them on Twitter

144
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.800
and a,
I think go Twitter as the place where I go to,

145
00:08:50.801 --> 00:08:53.200
to have a great conversation when I can't have one locally,

146
00:08:53.201 --> 00:08:56.070
which seems to be all the time.
And the more time

147
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.821
<v 4>that I spend on Twitter,</v>

148
00:08:56.821 --> 00:09:00.240
the more I sort of curate this incredible group of very intelligent people that

149
00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:04.220
I just get to know purely through the quality of their thoughts.
Um,

150
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.810
and so I think,
uh,

151
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:10.180
when I was getting into cryptocurrencies and blockchains,
uh,

152
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:11.450
doing my homework on it,

153
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:16.330
I stumbled across a blog called an enumerated.
Um,

154
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.240
and maybe nick can go into what the origins of that word are,
but,
uh,

155
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.150
it was obviously written by a polymath,
someone who wrote about everything.

156
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.880
I got into the blog and then I started following the author,

157
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:28.560
which was nick on Twitter,
retweet it,

158
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:32.970
or as few as tweets and got into little bite size,
160 character conversations.

159
00:09:32.971 --> 00:09:33.804
And here we are.

160
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.300
<v 3>How has that relationship developed?
In other words,
how are we here today?</v>

161
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.970
And you could take a stab at that.
Yeah,

162
00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.450
Nick's going to do plenty of targets and we certainly have him chime in,

163
00:09:43.451 --> 00:09:44.740
but if you want to,

164
00:09:44.741 --> 00:09:48.640
if you want to lead us to how we ended up here today.

165
00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:49.201
<v 4>Yeah.
I mean,</v>

166
00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:53.860
it was just more and more tweeting back and forth reading next articles.
Uh,

167
00:09:53.861 --> 00:09:57.390
there's one that he put up recently around social scalability,

168
00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.640
which I thought was literally mind blowing.

169
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.800
Like I thought I knew a lot about cryptocurrencies,

170
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.700
but it really just helped me reframe what I knew in a better mental model.
Uh,

171
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.550
you know how Charlie Munger talks about mental models?

172
00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:12.060
So I've actually picked up at least four or five mental models from neck,

173
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.180
which I think is more than I may have from any human being other than Charlie

174
00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:20.160
monger.
I was tweeting out sections of that article.
Then somebody said,

175
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:23.130
well,
nick and Novalis should do a podcast,
and I was like,
well,

176
00:10:23.131 --> 00:10:25.500
they didn't never do a podcast with me.
And then Nick said,
sure,

177
00:10:25.501 --> 00:10:27.360
I'll do a podcast.
So here we are.

178
00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:33.480
<v 3>Nick,
could you maybe help us with some definitions?
So cryptocurrency,</v>

179
00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:34.630
there are a number of other words,

180
00:10:34.631 --> 00:10:39.631
they're going to come up a lot and these are words that I feel at many dinner

181
00:10:39.911 --> 00:10:44.020
parties and say Silicon Valley people will not ask about because they're afraid.

182
00:10:44.021 --> 00:10:47.440
They're the only ones at the table who don't actually know how to define it.

183
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:51.640
But since I can't play the part of knowing what I don't know in this case,

184
00:10:51.641 --> 00:10:56.110
what is cryptocurrency and how did you become interested in it or start thinking

185
00:10:56.111 --> 00:10:56.490
about it?

186
00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:01.170
<v 5>Cryptocurrency as the name suggests,
is protected by cryptography.</v>

187
00:11:01.171 --> 00:11:05.260
And in particular the modern crypto currency like bitcoin and ethereum,

188
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.900
so forth are protected by their integrity,
is protected by cryptography.
A,

189
00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:14.760
a structure called a Merkle tree that you can think of it as a a fly getting

190
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:17.460
trapped in amber.
You,
if you say,

191
00:11:17.461 --> 00:11:21.810
I shot JFK and then put it through this process of the Merkle tree,

192
00:11:21.811 --> 00:11:24.220
putting it on the blockchain,
then it's there.
You can't,

193
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:27.670
and you've signed it with your,
with your private key,
then you can't later deny,

194
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.140
oh,
I shot,
didn't say that.

195
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.980
That allows you to like make a statement,
you know,

196
00:11:32.981 --> 00:11:37.390
I'm paying such and such amount of Bitcoin to somebody else and then put it

197
00:11:37.391 --> 00:11:40.690
there after a few cycles called block times,

198
00:11:40.691 --> 00:11:42.420
which should take about 10 minutes each.
Um,

199
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:46.540
it gets exponentially more difficult to deny or take back that,

200
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.350
that this transaction took place.

201
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.790
<v 3>How did you first begin thinking about this,
these,
these types of,</v>

202
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.740
or any of this really,
where did the interest to begin?

203
00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.610
<v 5>Well,
we had a group called the cypherpunks back in the 1990s.
Um,</v>

204
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.900
Tim May and Eric Hughes and John Gilmore and so forth.
And uh,

205
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.320
Tim may had,
so partly this is political that Tim may had a,

206
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:14.580
a vision of Gulf sculpture in cyberspace of any of your audience or ion ran

207
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.140
fans.

208
00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.890
They'll recognize the reference to galt sculptures is places you can go to get

209
00:12:18.891 --> 00:12:23.440
away from things into your business,
um,
without outside interference in,

210
00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.960
in the book.
That was like a physics fantasy.
But Tim goes,
well,

211
00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:30.040
we have strong cryptography now so we can do that.
And I thought,
well,
yes,

212
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:32.240
but you still want to do things like,
um,

213
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.660
enforce contracts and protect property and so forth.
So I,

214
00:12:35.661 --> 00:12:37.830
and I started thinking about,
um,

215
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.960
and to some extent some other people started thinking about how to apply

216
00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:45.430
computer science to,
um,
to protect Your Business in cyberspace.

217
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.750
<v 3>This bleeds into,</v>

218
00:12:46.751 --> 00:12:50.950
I did just enough reading to hopefully have questions to ask.

219
00:12:50.951 --> 00:12:55.951
I didn't want to read so much that I left out basics fundamentals for people.

220
00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.340
It's cryptography.
If it,
most people think that they hear that word,

221
00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:04.840
maybe exposure they've had is watching a movie that involves an enigma machine

222
00:13:04.841 --> 00:13:07.120
or something like that.
But what is cryptography?

223
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.430
<v 5>The original cryptography is,</v>

224
00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:14.190
is if you saw that movie is keeping secrets in this case,
in that movie,

225
00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:18.060
the Nazis failing to keep secrets from the British and Alan Turing cause there

226
00:13:18.061 --> 00:13:19.380
are cryptography wasn't strong enough,

227
00:13:19.381 --> 00:13:21.180
but these days you have really strong cryptography.

228
00:13:21.181 --> 00:13:24.300
So breaking it in that brute force men are like,
um,

229
00:13:24.301 --> 00:13:28.880
they broke the Nazi codes is pretty unlikely these days.
Um,

230
00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.430
there are some other things you can do like take people's private keys and so

231
00:13:32.431 --> 00:13:35.880
forth,
but the PR,
the brute force attack doesn't work anymore.

232
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:40.030
I mean there are some old cyphers where we're,
we're starting to work,
but um,

233
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:44.310
as long as you have the latest stuff like bitcoin does,
then,
then you're fine.

234
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.880
<v 4>Yeah,
I would say it's like basically keeping secrets through mathematics and,
uh,</v>

235
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.290
there are many,
many breakthroughs that enabled cryptocurrencies.
But,
uh,

236
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:58.040
one of the key things to understand cryptography is this concept of one way,
uh,

237
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.950
encoding one way hash functions.
Basically,

238
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:06.080
I can take some data,
run it through a mathematical transformation.

239
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:09.410
And what comes out of the other side is really hard to undo.

240
00:14:09.411 --> 00:14:12.020
It's really hard to work backwards.
So it's kind of a one way thing

241
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:16.270
<v 3>is when people send encrypted email through say PGP or something like that.</v>

242
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.260
Is that an example?

243
00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:22.150
<v 4>Yeah.
Basically what I've done,
so in the old days,
if I was encrypting something,</v>

244
00:14:22.151 --> 00:14:24.880
we would both have the same key,
right?
And so,

245
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:28.150
or I would have a key that I would take your key,
I would encrypt with your key,

246
00:14:28.151 --> 00:14:30.850
sent it to you.
You have the key you can decrypt with a key.

247
00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.070
But the problem was how do I figure out what your key is,

248
00:14:33.071 --> 00:14:36.520
how to figure out how to encrypt it and because your key can both encrypt and

249
00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:41.160
decrypt.
So if I had a hold of your key,
then I could open the message,
right?

250
00:14:41.161 --> 00:14:43.090
So it's very unsafe to transmit that key.

251
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.270
And so one of the innovations that came along with this idea of splitting the

252
00:14:46.271 --> 00:14:50.320
key into a public key and a private key.
So a private keys,

253
00:14:50.321 --> 00:14:52.940
what you hold on that can decrypt and encrypt stuff,

254
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.960
your public key on the other hand,
other people can encrypt to it for you,

255
00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:02.610
but they can't use it.
It's a right on it.
Yeah,
it's a one way kind of thing.

256
00:15:02.611 --> 00:15:05.040
So I mean this is probably beyond the scope of this discussion,

257
00:15:05.041 --> 00:15:08.640
but it's worth digging a little bit into what are called one way hash functions

258
00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:09.990
and public keys and private keys.

259
00:15:09.991 --> 00:15:13.560
Cause they underlie a lot of cryptography and they seem like complicated

260
00:15:13.561 --> 00:15:16.490
concepts,
but they're not that complicated.
Uh,
and I,

261
00:15:16.491 --> 00:15:19.020
I would argue this is one of those mental models that you kind of have to figure

262
00:15:19.021 --> 00:15:22.300
out tot start operating the modern technological world.
Um,

263
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:26.940
but cryptocurrencies essentially use these one way hash functions to make

264
00:15:26.941 --> 00:15:31.020
statements like I gave Tim $10,
right?

265
00:15:31.021 --> 00:15:33.060
So if I said I gave you $10,

266
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:37.800
normally we need a central authority to verify that the bank has to verify that.

267
00:15:37.801 --> 00:15:41.310
And the central bank has diversified.
Well this leads to the question of,

268
00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.720
and I'm not going to interrupt beyond this,
but why,
why create cryptocurrency?

269
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.120
Why is it important?
What are the benefits?
Yeah,
so I mean,

270
00:15:48.121 --> 00:15:50.490
one huge benefit is we don't need any more,

271
00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:55.320
a trusted third party to verify that transaction.

272
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:58.050
We can do it in the cloud through a distributed network,

273
00:15:58.051 --> 00:16:01.470
which is kind of what the cryptocurrency does.
Um,
but I'll,

274
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.430
I'll let nick talk more about this,
but he had a great quote,
um,

275
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.480
that I think is very irrelevant where he said,
uh,

276
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.540
this is the dawn of trustworthy computing,
right?

277
00:16:10.541 --> 00:16:12.700
Because before this computer to kind of untrusted,

278
00:16:12.701 --> 00:16:16.510
like if I send you money from my computer to your computer,

279
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.560
we're really relying on visa and the banks and a bunch of intermediaries just

280
00:16:20.561 --> 00:16:24.870
actually say,
yes,
the money got to you and the money's no longer mine.
Uh,

281
00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.660
but computers don't like to operate like that.
Computers,
you know,
Computer Code,

282
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:33.720
especially,
uh,
stuff that's running in the cloud on it's own,
uh,

283
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:38.770
shouldn't have to rely on an offline wet space meetspace institution to enforce

284
00:16:40.551 --> 00:16:41.960
that kind of thing.
Um,

285
00:16:41.961 --> 00:16:46.220
so cryptocurrencies take the concept of money and they take it native into

286
00:16:46.221 --> 00:16:50.030
computers where everything is settled with computers and doesn't require

287
00:16:50.031 --> 00:16:53.990
external institutions are trusted third parties to validate things.

288
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:58.070
Just to try to paraphrase that for my own understanding.
So in other words,

289
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.930
you don't have to say trust a stranger to do something.

290
00:17:02.931 --> 00:17:07.630
You don't have to trust a central authority to be the arbiter of whatever

291
00:17:07.631 --> 00:17:09.790
decisions end up being made are implemented.

292
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.360
It's built into the technology itself.
Yeah.

293
00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:18.400
<v 5>Why?
Why is cryptocurrency important to you?
So it's important for,</v>

294
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:22.840
I think,
the,
the partially political reason to gain more independence,
um,

295
00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:27.670
of your life from these institutions.
And it just creates a new capabilities.

296
00:17:27.671 --> 00:17:32.530
Like somebody now in Guatemala can base somebody in Canada without using an

297
00:17:32.531 --> 00:17:37.390
intermediary New York City or something that's just greatly advantageous for

298
00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:38.410
global commerce,
I think.

299
00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:43.140
<v 4>Yeah.
So if I can just dig into that a little bit more,
definitely dig in.</v>

300
00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:46.800
I also at some point,
because this word is plagued me for a few years now,

301
00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:50.070
blockchain,
I do not know what it means and I don't why it's called blockchain.

302
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:51.390
I actually thought Nick's,
uh,

303
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:56.050
earlier analogy of a fly getting trapped in amber is kind of brilliant.
Um,

304
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.500
like if you see a fly in amber and it's got,
you know,

305
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:00.960
a millimeter of amber around it,

306
00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:04.410
well that could have been done yesterday or you know,
like a year ago.

307
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:08.700
But if you see the fly is trapped in a huge block of amber,
you know,

308
00:18:08.701 --> 00:18:11.280
it's been there for a long,
long time.
It's been accumulating.

309
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.730
So a blockchain is a series of blocks.

310
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:19.140
Each block is a series of computations done by computers all over the world

311
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:22.530
using serious cryptography in a way that's very hard to undo.

312
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.620
So each block is like another thin layer of amber.
I see.

313
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.040
And the chain of blocks represents the depth of that amber,

314
00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:33.990
how long that fly has been trapped in and therefore how you can trust that

315
00:18:33.991 --> 00:18:34.830
honest signal.

316
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:40.020
Anything deep down in the blockchain is mathematically cryptographically and

317
00:18:40.021 --> 00:18:44.760
just economically impossible to undo.
Got It.
Okay.
Actually I shouldn't,

318
00:18:44.761 --> 00:18:47.810
you use words like impossible and cryptography is all that it was always him.

319
00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.550
Probable,
probable,
yeah.

320
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:56.840
What are some other core concepts that people should understand just as the

321
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.040
cryptocurrency one o one or currency one on one.
I mean,

322
00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:03.720
depending on where we want to go with that,

323
00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.230
I even want to start with like what is money?
Sure.

324
00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.270
Cause we're throwing around the word currency and money and people talk about

325
00:19:09.271 --> 00:19:13.460
gold and store of value.
And you know,
nick actually created bitgold,

326
00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:18.390
which was,
uh,
some would argue a critical foundational predecessor to bitcoin.

327
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:22.410
Bitcoin had an additional breakthrough or two that an employed that big call did

328
00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:27.120
not,
but,
but gold was the giant on whose shoulders bitcoin stands.
Uh,

329
00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:28.830
and nick also created both the,

330
00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:33.690
the phrase and the concept and the theory behind smart contracts,

331
00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:37.110
which we're now starting to hear about in the context of other cryptocurrencies

332
00:19:37.111 --> 00:19:40.140
like ethereum.
Uh,
but I,
I think we should just,
uh,

333
00:19:40.141 --> 00:19:42.810
this is a complicated topic that it's worth just starting with like,

334
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.110
what is money?
If you ask 10 people in the street what money is,

335
00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:48.210
you'd probably get 10 different answers.
Sure.
Um,

336
00:19:48.211 --> 00:19:50.400
so I think it's important just to be rigorous about that.

337
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:51.500
And if you ask a lawyer,

338
00:19:51.501 --> 00:19:55.050
we'll get an answer that's radically different than if you ask an economist as

339
00:19:55.051 --> 00:19:56.190
well.
If you ask a lawyer,

340
00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.610
they'll say something like an official government currency.

341
00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:04.390
So of course bitcoin and goal,
you can't write checks for those because,
uh,

342
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:08.010
those are not legal official government currencies.
So that's the,

343
00:20:08.011 --> 00:20:10.200
that's the kind of narrow,
modern legal definition.

344
00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:14.040
Economists use the definition of medium of exchange,

345
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.700
which is a much broader definition,
but that also assumes that,
you know,

346
00:20:17.701 --> 00:20:20.850
the only important transactions are people exchanging things,
which in our,

347
00:20:20.851 --> 00:20:22.410
in our modern economy is a good assumption.

348
00:20:22.411 --> 00:20:25.200
But if you actually go back to the origins of money,
which I've liked to study,

349
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:26.161
um,

350
00:20:26.161 --> 00:20:31.140
you find things like inheritance and compensation for injuries as equivalent to

351
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.690
a modern lawsuit,

352
00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:36.120
but not necessarily with governments and courts and more like wars to enforce

353
00:20:36.121 --> 00:20:40.860
the fourth and the verdict and a bridewell.
There's certain fitness,
critical,

354
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:45.000
critical,
the Darwinian fitness at other animals can't do that.
Humans can.

355
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.400
And that form of,
I like to call it collectibles

356
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.090
<v 5>because now I've extended the definition of money far broader than probably any</v>

357
00:20:52.091 --> 00:20:55.990
economist would want to.
But uh,
so I call us collectible,
so it's very similar.

358
00:20:55.991 --> 00:20:59.920
So the Yurok Indians for example,
you shells too,

359
00:20:59.921 --> 00:21:01.720
and they would have tattoo marks on their arm.

360
00:21:01.721 --> 00:21:03.250
There were serious about their shells.

361
00:21:03.251 --> 00:21:06.430
They would have tattoo marks in their arm to measure the lengths of shells and

362
00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:10.570
that told you the denomination,
the value of,
of how valuable that show was,

363
00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.790
which corresponds to how scarce it was in nature.

364
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.960
And they would use these for inheritance,
for injury compensation,

365
00:21:16.961 --> 00:21:18.430
for bride wealth and so forth.

366
00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:20.530
<v 4>Yes.
It sounds like,
you know,</v>

367
00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:25.000
as I think that the common theory is that humans have only been using money for

368
00:21:25.001 --> 00:21:26.260
a few thousand years,

369
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:30.130
but I think some of the work you've done in origins of money shows that actually

370
00:21:30.131 --> 00:21:31.780
it's a hundred thousand years.

371
00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:32.061
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

372
00:21:32.061 --> 00:21:36.260
You can go back in the archaeological record and it's a puzzle for a hundred

373
00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:40.190
thousand years and our Darwinian world that people lived in,
um,

374
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.220
quiet people do something.
So frivolous as you know,

375
00:21:43.221 --> 00:21:44.900
adorn themselves with Shell necklaces.

376
00:21:44.901 --> 00:21:49.130
Yet those are among the most common artifacts right up there with axes,

377
00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.130
practical axes that you use to cut things in the archaeological record.

378
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.500
<v 4>Yeah.
So I mean on,
on the money thing,</v>

379
00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:58.820
I've also tried to wrap my head around this and as Nick said,
yeah,

380
00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.490
economists would say it's a medium of exchange,
uh,

381
00:22:01.491 --> 00:22:04.040
as the historical record shows,
it's a store of value.

382
00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.050
So even if you're not exchanging it,
you just want to go store valley.

383
00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:10.400
You may not want to store bread or rocks or how's this?

384
00:22:10.401 --> 00:22:13.910
So you store the image type of goal.
The transport.
Exactly.

385
00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.060
And then it's also a unit of account.
So in other words,

386
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.150
like you have to denominate prices and something,

387
00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.120
I'm not going to tell you how many loaves of bread a car costs.

388
00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.690
So I need to be able to just pick a unit of account to don't judge.

389
00:22:25.691 --> 00:22:28.480
I only have that occasionally.
So it is all of those things.

390
00:22:28.481 --> 00:22:31.530
And I think one of the places where people fall down on cryptocurrencies

391
00:22:31.531 --> 00:22:34.330
currencies,
they say,
well no one's using bitcoin to buy anything right now.

392
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:38.530
So it may not be fulfilling the medium of exchange function.
Uh,
but it is,

393
00:22:38.531 --> 00:22:40.900
it may be fulfilling a different function,
that store of value.

394
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.380
It might be a Swiss bank account in everyone's pocket or in their mind or it

395
00:22:44.381 --> 00:22:47.170
might be the defense against the Cypress style bank haircut

396
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:51.610
<v 3>or it could be the the future that is here but not evenly distributed.
And,</v>

397
00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:56.040
and you can go to Palo Alto to Copa Cafe and buy coffee with bitcoin right now.

398
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:58.860
<v 4>Yeah.
And within,
within my social circle,
uh,</v>

399
00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.220
there was a large group of people who will take bitcoin as legal tender.

400
00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:05.250
Like you can go to them and settled debts in Bitcoin and they will happily take

401
00:23:05.251 --> 00:23:05.970
it.

402
00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:07.240
<v 3>Yeah.
Or if you want to buy,</v>

403
00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:12.250
say a scientific abstracts or articles from a Russian website,

404
00:23:12.251 --> 00:23:14.640
they may only take bitcoin as well.
Yes,

405
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.160
<v 4>it does seem a little bubbly,
which is,
you know,
you kind of say,
well,</v>

406
00:23:18.161 --> 00:23:21.020
it's only money because everyone believed this money.
But,
uh,

407
00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.930
one definition I really liked of,
uh,
money is money.

408
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:28.550
The bubble that never pops.
Okay.
So if we,
if,

409
00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:32.170
if the tulip bubble had never popped,
we'd probably be dealing in tulips today.

410
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.830
Now it popped for fairly good reasons,
which is tulips make for a lousy money.

411
00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:39.880
They're hard to store,
they're hard to transport their heart to sub divide.
Um,

412
00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:44.680
but the crypto currencies,
uh,
actually are the exact opposite end of that scale.

413
00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:49.070
They are easier to store,
easier to transport,
easier to subdivide,
um,

414
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.050
cheaper in many ways,
uh,

415
00:23:51.051 --> 00:23:56.051
and more defensible than almost any other form of money or gold or commodity.

416
00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:59.840
<v 6>Now,
what makes,
since we're talking about money or currency,</v>

417
00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:02.420
what makes money valuable?

418
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:07.210
I think this might be interesting to dig into for a second because you have say

419
00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:11.660
at certain points in time,
paper pegged to gold,
right?
And then the reading today,

420
00:24:11.661 --> 00:24:16.100
because it's another word that I've seen a lot,
but aside from the car company,

421
00:24:16.101 --> 00:24:20.140
I was not sure what Fiat really meant.
So if we're talking of valid,

422
00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:24.520
don't even know what they're seeing even around anymore.
What distinguishes,
say,

423
00:24:24.521 --> 00:24:28.360
cryptocurrency or makes cryptocurrency valuable?
Is it the rarity?

424
00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.090
What are the factors that determine that?

425
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:35.090
<v 5>Well,
I mean the scarcity is an essential essential part of it.
Um,
you,</v>

426
00:24:35.091 --> 00:24:38.060
if it starts in flooding on you,
then you're sure if it goes down.

427
00:24:38.061 --> 00:24:41.470
So the scared cities quite essential to it.
Um,

428
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:46.320
other things are you want it to be easy and secure to store and transport.
And,

429
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:51.270
and Bitcoin has the advantage that you can send to people all over the world and

430
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.450
stored on a hardware wallet,
which is a fairly secure way to store it.

431
00:24:56.451 --> 00:25:00.550
And the most important part of it,
what is a hardware wallet?
So hardware wallet,

432
00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.850
so your normal computers are pretty insecure and that that's one of the stories

433
00:25:03.851 --> 00:25:05.860
of blockchains is that,
um,

434
00:25:05.861 --> 00:25:10.660
this distributed system is a lot more secure than an individual computer.
Um,

435
00:25:10.661 --> 00:25:14.260
so you're going computer could have malware,
viruses and so forth.
So hardware,

436
00:25:14.261 --> 00:25:15.430
while it's a separate piece,

437
00:25:15.431 --> 00:25:19.510
like on Usb stick you plug in has its own chip on it and the bit coin your

438
00:25:19.511 --> 00:25:23.770
private key gets stored on that chip rather than on the computer.

439
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.730
<v 4>Got It.
Got It.
Yeah.
There's a zillion ways to a bitcoin.</v>

440
00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:28.290
You could do it on your computer,

441
00:25:28.291 --> 00:25:31.290
but the new computers connected to the Internet security hole.

442
00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.810
You could put it in an online exchange,

443
00:25:33.811 --> 00:25:36.680
but then you're just trusting an unregulated bank.
Um,

444
00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:40.880
you can put it in a hardware wallet,
which says Nix had a dedicated device.
Um,

445
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.920
you can put it on a piece of paper and stick it in your bank account.

446
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:47.010
Is that in cold storage or if it's cold storage?
Yeah,
that's cold storage.

447
00:25:47.011 --> 00:25:49.300
What he says where I know the words but not what they mean.
This is,

448
00:25:49.301 --> 00:25:50.480
this is one of them.
Yeah.

449
00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.880
This is one of the craziest things about this concept because money in money and

450
00:25:53.881 --> 00:25:56.880
speech turned out to be the same thing.
Money,
information,
math.

451
00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.340
They are the same thing.
So in a big coin world,

452
00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:04.150
I can literally write down my bitcoin address and keys on a piece of paper and

453
00:26:04.151 --> 00:26:07.210
put in a safety deposit box.
And it's basically in cold storage.

454
00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.400
I could even put it in my head,

455
00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:14.020
I can memorize the key phrases and I could cross borders with $1 billion in my

456
00:26:14.021 --> 00:26:15.310
brain.
Um,

457
00:26:15.311 --> 00:26:19.840
so in that it's a very powerful but mind bending literally concept in that
sense.

458
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:24.360
<v 6>Is this a point where it makes sense to talk about smart contracts or is that a</v>

459
00:26:24.361 --> 00:26:27.060
non sequitur?
No,
where's there,
is there a good bridge?

460
00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.610
<v 4>Yeah,
no,
I think,
I think we should get into it first.
I,</v>

461
00:26:29.611 --> 00:26:33.220
I want to make sure that we understand what blockchains in bitcoin are,
right.

462
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:34.540
Might be worth going into.

463
00:26:34.541 --> 00:26:37.770
Like what are the key innovations that enabled bitcoin?

464
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:41.410
<v 6>And I'll leave you to dictate when this makes sense or either of you guys,</v>

465
00:26:41.411 --> 00:26:44.520
but the article that you sent about

466
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:49.430
<v 4>the,
I guess,
fat protocol layer.
Right.
And get it to that later.
Okay.</v>

467
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:53.910
We'll get there.
That's a little teaser for folks.
Uh,
I'll let you lead with them.

468
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:58.440
So I think it's worth getting into like what is the bitcoin computer,
right?

469
00:26:58.441 --> 00:27:02.310
Cause there is basically you can abstract and think of Bitcoin is running on a

470
00:27:02.311 --> 00:27:06.360
blockchain computer.
Uh,
and maybe nick can take a stab at defining what it is.

471
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:06.751
By the way,

472
00:27:06.751 --> 00:27:09.390
this is one of those things where I think if you asked 10 different people in

473
00:27:09.391 --> 00:27:13.110
cryptocurrencies what bitcoin is and what a blockchain is and what watching

474
00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:14.820
computer is,
you'll get 10 different answers.
You know,

475
00:27:14.821 --> 00:27:18.000
some people are more qualified than others.
Oh it's,
it's also just,
it's new.

476
00:27:18.001 --> 00:27:20.700
It's hard to figure it out.
These are very abstract concepts,

477
00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:24.120
ideas being turned into code and um,
they are all,

478
00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:27.070
bitcoin is almost to computers.
What,

479
00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.400
what like quantum mechanics is to physics.

480
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:31.890
It throws a lot of people in the field off.

481
00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:35.710
Well it's also like quantum physics because you have a lot of uh,

482
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:41.240
well intentioned like hippies and new agey people who will misappropriate it and

483
00:27:41.391 --> 00:27:43.470
use it completely incorrectly.
Absolutely.

484
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.040
Not to say there are a lot of new agey hippie people getting into
cryptocurrency.

485
00:27:47.041 --> 00:27:50.690
There might be,
but,
uh,
I think you also have that challenge,

486
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:52.770
the layers of understanding,
like,

487
00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:55.080
I don't know how to write code for a Merkle tree.

488
00:27:55.081 --> 00:27:58.900
I don't know how to take a part of bitcoin block and analyze it.
Um,

489
00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:02.850
so in some level I'm still,
you know,
a new agey hippie trying to figure it out.

490
00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:05.460
Um,
but I think it's worth getting into like,

491
00:28:05.461 --> 00:28:08.760
what is the blockchain computer and how does it enable Bitcoin,

492
00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:11.790
I guess first of all,
before dropping to that.

493
00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:15.750
And another important concept to the architecture that hasn't been mentioned yet

494
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.010
is replication.

495
00:28:17.011 --> 00:28:20.160
So there's thousands of copies of these things running on what are called full

496
00:28:20.161 --> 00:28:23.490
nodes all over the world.
And those are servers,
right?
Right.
So there,

497
00:28:23.491 --> 00:28:28.110
there are servers that can be laptops or larger machines,
but,
uh,

498
00:28:28.111 --> 00:28:30.000
there are thousands of them running all over the world.

499
00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:33.750
So anybody who has a copy of this can their machine and do a full validation for

500
00:28:33.751 --> 00:28:37.560
itself.
And it's kind of the most secure way to run,
run a cryptocurrency.
Yeah.

501
00:28:37.561 --> 00:28:38.460
Sorry,
sorry to interrupt you.

502
00:28:38.461 --> 00:28:42.960
But basically what's going on is if I give Tim $10 and then Tim gives nick those

503
00:28:42.961 --> 00:28:44.650
$10 the way we,

504
00:28:44.651 --> 00:28:48.210
you track of it as to a piece of paper or in the old days where the Yurok

505
00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.070
Indians,
it would be a shell of a certain measurement.

506
00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:52.350
But now with Bitcoin there's a ledger.

507
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:57.500
We basically just keep track in a ledger entry that neval moved this $10 to Tim.

508
00:28:57.541 --> 00:28:59.220
Tim moved the $10 to nick.

509
00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:03.150
Now the problem is who maintains the sanctity of that ledger?

510
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.620
Can You just forge that ledger?

511
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:09.270
So historically the central bank would maintain the sanctity of the ledger or

512
00:29:09.271 --> 00:29:11.880
the fact that you have a certain dollar bill with a serial number and it

513
00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:13.440
maintains the sanctity of the ledger.

514
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.820
But now bitcoin has the craziest answer you can imagine,

515
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.360
but it turns out to work,
which is everybody has a copy of the ledger.

516
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:25.830
So every one of the bitcoin network who's running a node keeps a copy of the

517
00:29:25.831 --> 00:29:28.500
ledgers from the dawn of Bitcoin till now.

518
00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:32.520
And that is a testament to the computing power and memory that we have available

519
00:29:32.521 --> 00:29:35.010
in,
in modern computers that people can do this at home.

520
00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:36.810
You can run a full bitcoin node.

521
00:29:36.811 --> 00:29:41.470
Where do you keep a copy of every single bitcoin transaction from the dawn time

522
00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:42.304
til now?

523
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.240
<v 5>And all these computers running together essentially validate with each other</v>

524
00:29:46.241 --> 00:29:46.721
like our,

525
00:29:46.721 --> 00:29:51.070
our ledgers or same are we using the same ledger who's ledger is correct in case

526
00:29:51.071 --> 00:29:52.490
as a disagreement.
Uh,

527
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.140
and that's where kind of all the blockchain comes in doing all this
cryptography.

528
00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:00.950
And then another thing that's replicated besides the data and the uh,
um,

529
00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:04.240
integrity,
cryptography we talked about,
um,

530
00:30:04.241 --> 00:30:08.620
his code computer programs and kind of the second definition of smart contracts,

531
00:30:08.621 --> 00:30:10.510
we'll get into the first definition later.

532
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:14.320
But the second definition is simply describing this code,

533
00:30:14.321 --> 00:30:18.320
this replicated that's running on all these nodes and a,

534
00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:23.420
that code can do things like enforce on bitcoin and can do some fairly simple

535
00:30:23.861 --> 00:30:27.580
things that add some sophistication or like require multiple signatures to do a

536
00:30:27.581 --> 00:30:28.780
spend for example.

537
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:32.950
So like you can think of signature authority and office where multiple people

538
00:30:32.951 --> 00:30:36.100
have to sign off on something.
You can set up your bitcoin to do that.

539
00:30:36.101 --> 00:30:39.940
Using one of these smart contracts on these pieces of code replicated.

540
00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:44.510
<v 6>I might be taking us back or taking us ahead or neither.
Ah,</v>

541
00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.390
a wandering through the blockchain.
It's complicated.
Yeah.
It's a smart contract.

542
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.260
In essence.

543
00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:54.290
Are you taking what would rely on human beings and embedding it into the

544
00:30:56.641 --> 00:30:58.350
technology so that there's,

545
00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.490
you don't have to rely on standard set of ethics,

546
00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:05.730
reliable set of behavior.
Is that a smart contract?

547
00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:09.440
<v 5>Yeah,
so to some extent there,
there are some areas of,
of contracts,</v>

548
00:31:09.441 --> 00:31:11.880
I'm kinds of contractual clauses usually,

549
00:31:11.881 --> 00:31:16.881
but not always associated with the financial aspects of the contract that you

550
00:31:17.231 --> 00:31:21.730
can,
they're really logically structured and you can code that into the computer,

551
00:31:21.731 --> 00:31:24.970
put it on the blockchain and then it runs over the really high integrity.

552
00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:30.300
And that means that somebody in Albania can do a smart contract with somebody in

553
00:31:30.331 --> 00:31:34.680
Zimbabwe.
And to the extent that they can formalize there,

554
00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:38.640
deal mathematically with through this logic,
um,
code.

555
00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:42.600
They don't have to rely on the Albanian authorities or the Zimbabwe authorities.

556
00:31:42.601 --> 00:31:44.730
They can just do business directly.

557
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:47.590
<v 6>And uh,
you had a great term for this.</v>

558
00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:51.200
This is getting into the driver's is wet code,
right?

559
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:54.490
So dry being computer based,

560
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:58.770
well being potentially the legal ease and the head of a lawyer in Albania and

561
00:31:58.771 --> 00:32:00.940
the legal ease in the head of a lawyer in Zimbabwe,

562
00:32:00.941 --> 00:32:05.020
which is going to be a whole whole just slew of mess potentially.

563
00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:09.260
<v 5>Right.
So I like to think all that legal easy.
See in a contract as,
as a,</v>

564
00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.690
as a program that runs on the brains of a lawyer.

565
00:32:11.691 --> 00:32:13.850
It doesn't usually run on north brains of normal people.

566
00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:16.460
<v 6>This is going to,
yeah,</v>

567
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:19.300
I'm trying to take us to too far field what we're talking about.

568
00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.090
How did you become interested in contracts?

569
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.990
<v 5>So it's part of I guess libertarian ideology,
but it's also part,</v>

570
00:32:25.991 --> 00:32:30.220
I went to law school and it's also part of law school one o one that property in

571
00:32:30.221 --> 00:32:31.000
contract law,

572
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.740
that kind of the two fundamental building blocks of our commercial society.

573
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:40.010
Yeah.
So I was interested in in how do you enforce those cyberspace?

574
00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:41.850
<v 3>I don't meet many people.</v>

575
00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:46.880
I meet people who have say JD Mba or j d Ph d I don't meet many people who have

576
00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:53.310
j d and computer science degree and Lo and libertarian.
On top of that,

577
00:32:53.311 --> 00:32:54.720
I ended up Rotarian on top of that,

578
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:57.930
although I have heard there are some libertarians running around the bay area,

579
00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:00.150
a Jd.
Currently I'm a libertarian.

580
00:33:00.151 --> 00:33:02.840
I've been told relatively to the average person in silicon valley.

581
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:05.090
I live in San Francisco and own guns and they're like,
you're a libertarian.

582
00:33:05.091 --> 00:33:07.970
I'm like,
is that it really?
Is that easy?
I got my Mike,
my card.
Okay.

583
00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:13.230
How did you end up doing both of those degrees?
I haven't run into that before.

584
00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:17.020
<v 5>The law degree is in large part based on smart contracts and wanting to do a</v>

585
00:33:17.021 --> 00:33:21.530
reality check of the stuff I'd thought of as a computer scientist.
I see,

586
00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:25.120
so the computer science came first?
Yeah,
and then the J D was right.

587
00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.740
Went to study the wet code then?

588
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.950
<v 3>Yeah.
Now that I know how a computer works,</v>

589
00:33:31.951 --> 00:33:36.440
let me go look at an advocates and see what that's like.
Okay.
Very cool.
Yeah,
so,

590
00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:40.890
so I think some of this is smart contracts,
which by the way,
as I said earlier,

591
00:33:40.891 --> 00:33:43.890
nick created not just the concept of the theory behind it.
Uh,

592
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:47.280
smart contracts are essentially taking that wet code,

593
00:33:47.281 --> 00:33:50.850
converting into dry code and then putting it inside blockchain.

594
00:33:50.851 --> 00:33:54.780
So it's immutable after awhile that it's,
it becomes a fly trapped in amber.

595
00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:57.870
If we made an agreement and the simplest smart contract,
by the way,

596
00:33:57.871 --> 00:34:01.060
it's just I gave you money and you got the money,
that's a very,

597
00:34:01.061 --> 00:34:05.280
very simple contract that got fulfilled.
So,
but you can put much more complex.

598
00:34:05.281 --> 00:34:09.950
So a contract is a promise and fulfillment of promise or is there an easier way

599
00:34:09.951 --> 00:34:11.930
to think about it?
Because what I think contract,

600
00:34:11.931 --> 00:34:16.670
I think of all these clauses are right,
termination,
arbitration term,
et Cetera.

601
00:34:16.671 --> 00:34:18.950
I think of all these because they look at Winchester and contracts

602
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:20.190
<v 5>now.
So,
um,</v>

603
00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:23.880
you can think of the primordial granddaddy of all smart contracts is the vending

604
00:34:23.881 --> 00:34:28.530
machine.
So vending machine,
um,
in contract law terms,

605
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:32.700
it verifies a performance you put in your quarter and it verifies,

606
00:34:32.701 --> 00:34:35.130
you put in the quarter through its mechanical.

607
00:34:35.131 --> 00:34:39.810
I'm talking about old fashioned machines here.
It has logic in that says,

608
00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:44.360
okay,
you put in a quarter the soda cost a dime.
So I'm going to give you a,

609
00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:47.540
a diamond in Nickelback and the soda you selected.

610
00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:52.900
So you can think of writing this in a contract.
Tediously um,
that,
uh,

611
00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:57.100
you know,
if,
if the party of the first puts in a quarter,
you know,

612
00:34:57.101 --> 00:34:58.690
the cardio the second we'll give them back.

613
00:34:58.691 --> 00:35:00.320
But of course you want to do this and machine,
right?

614
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:01.930
<v 3>I'll get the lawyers.
Any idea,</v>

615
00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:07.350
<v 5>it's verifying our performance.
On the one hand,
somebody,</v>

616
00:35:07.351 --> 00:35:11.700
it's observing that somebody did their payment are their other performance of a

617
00:35:11.701 --> 00:35:15.420
contractual deal and on their hands automating and performance,
it's dispensing,

618
00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:16.410
dispensing the guts.

619
00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:19.320
So the colors are kind of the two basic things smart contracts can do.

620
00:35:19.321 --> 00:35:24.120
They verify somebody's performance,
um,
and they automate performance.
Now,

621
00:35:24.121 --> 00:35:26.010
the third thing is if you have another,

622
00:35:26.011 --> 00:35:28.770
there's a bunch of stuff that's inherently what most of this stuff that you can

623
00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.510
code and the smart contracts as those two kinds of things are like payments and

624
00:35:33.511 --> 00:35:38.220
various financial conditions.
You can do a lot of financial stuff like um,
options

625
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:42.960
<v 4>and collateralize loans and so forth,
uh,
futures.
But uh,</v>

626
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.880
for things that are inherently wet though,

627
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:48.900
nobody's figured out how to have the computer verify or automate to performance

628
00:35:48.901 --> 00:35:52.470
yet.
Um,
you can,
you know,
invoke an arbitrator,

629
00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:56.820
a signature structured like multisig dab humans approve certain steps.

630
00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:02.620
In what case would be an example of where you or someone else might want

631
00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.140
multi-six in that universe.

632
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.120
If you're doing something with an escrow,
for example,

633
00:36:09.121 --> 00:36:14.121
that you have the person or persons responsible for the collateral verifying

634
00:36:15.241 --> 00:36:19.410
that the contract was performed,
then they can free up the collateral.
Got It.

635
00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:23.440
So if you wanted to buy a house that had to do inspections,
Wendy's,
bitcoin,

636
00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:25.230
right?
Yeah.
It'd be good to situation.

637
00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:28.050
And there are things you can do now with smart contracts,

638
00:36:28.051 --> 00:36:29.460
which you call on chain,

639
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:33.090
where you can have all the money and the collateral and the escrow and the data

640
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:35.100
as close to computerize as possible.

641
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.480
So the stuff that people are starting to do with smart contracts and now it's

642
00:36:38.481 --> 00:36:41.520
pretty mind blowing.
Can we talk about the article you sent me?

643
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:44.760
I know it seems like it might not be the right [inaudible] was very helpful to

644
00:36:44.761 --> 00:36:47.490
me.
Sure.
So do you want to dig into that?
So there's this,

645
00:36:47.491 --> 00:36:49.160
there's this concept of uh,

646
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:53.760
what bitcoin and etherium and these other cryptocurrencies are doing.
Um,

647
00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:57.510
is there,
they're the new protocols and what does a protocol,

648
00:36:57.511 --> 00:37:01.020
a protocol is kind of like a God,
now I'm going to get trapped in definitions,

649
00:37:01.021 --> 00:37:03.150
but a protocol is sort of how computers,

650
00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:07.410
it's a standard for how computers exchange information.
Um,
so for example,

651
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:10.770
you and I speaking the English language is a form of protocol,

652
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.050
but then also like each day,
DTP.
Yeah,

653
00:37:13.051 --> 00:37:15.630
I'm supposed to pause every five seconds and then you're supposed to get a

654
00:37:15.631 --> 00:37:17.490
chance to speak.
That's part of the protocol.

655
00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.980
We say hello to each other as a greeting.
That's part of the protocol.

656
00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:23.520
So we have verbal packets like TCI and also another protocol.

657
00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:28.180
And on the Internet these protocols are TCP Ip,
http,
SMTP.

658
00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:30.970
Every time your email gets sent from one server to another,

659
00:37:30.971 --> 00:37:33.700
it's using the SMTP simple mail transfer protocol.

660
00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:36.920
And these protocols power the Internet.
Um,

661
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:40.540
and the assumption that was made in the early days of the Internet was that,

662
00:37:40.541 --> 00:37:43.930
well Ben,
with this cheap servers are cheap,
hardware is cheap,

663
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:47.680
so it's free.
If I want to send you a packet,
it's free.

664
00:37:47.681 --> 00:37:50.350
If you want to receive the packet,
it's free.
It doesn't cost anything,

665
00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:54.760
but those assumptions are breaking down.
Um,
we have denial of service attacks,

666
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:58.890
which is basically your computer demands resource from my computer that I'm

667
00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:02.890
saying no,
but you're asking so many times for free that it just overwhelms me.

668
00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.630
Spam is another example.
I can send you a zillion email that hardly any costs,

669
00:38:07.631 --> 00:38:11.360
but it costs you a lot of attention.
So these free protocols are,

670
00:38:11.361 --> 00:38:13.090
are becoming poor assumptions.

671
00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:17.530
The worst place for a poor assumption on a protocol is a protocol for exchanging

672
00:38:17.531 --> 00:38:21.760
money.
If I say,
Tim,
I want to give you $10,
that has to be scarce in some way.

673
00:38:21.761 --> 00:38:24.700
It can't just be,
it can't be a free transaction,
right?

674
00:38:24.701 --> 00:38:26.590
Cause it's money's exchanging hands.

675
00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.890
So we need a concept of protocols that underlies scarce resources,
that,

676
00:38:30.891 --> 00:38:32.470
that allocate scarce resources.

677
00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:37.330
And what's going on is cryptocurrencies and blockchains are creating these,

678
00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:42.040
uh,
what are now being called fact protocols.
Uh,
and we'll put an article in the,

679
00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:46.340
in the show notes about this,
but fat protocols are protocols,
uh,

680
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.880
that actually exchange scarce value.

681
00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:52.080
And they keep data in the protocol.
They maintain

682
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:54.670
<v 6>data.
That's the key piece,
right?
Or in a way,</v>

683
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:58.920
<v 4>yeah,
there's two key pieces.
One is scarcity,
which is a regulated by a token.</v>

684
00:38:58.921 --> 00:39:00.270
So in the bitcoin protocol,

685
00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:04.110
the scarce pieces of the bitcoin itself and the protocol is about the exchange

686
00:39:04.111 --> 00:39:06.120
of money and the token is bitcoin.

687
00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.570
And then there's data that you can put on the blockchain.
Like,
I could,

688
00:39:09.571 --> 00:39:12.420
for example,
take a,
uh,
an article that I wrote,

689
00:39:12.421 --> 00:39:16.020
I could hash it the one way crypto Hash,
put it in the blockchain,

690
00:39:16.021 --> 00:39:20.040
prove that it came from me,
and then it gets trapped in the amber again,

691
00:39:20.041 --> 00:39:22.380
like the fly and no one can undo it later.

692
00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:27.360
And as it's secured by the value of the blockchain,
so the,
these,

693
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:30.810
these new protocols,
these fat protocols are very different.

694
00:39:30.811 --> 00:39:31.620
They're gonna exchange.

695
00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:36.060
They're going to enable a new kind of internet that we did not have before.
Um,

696
00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:38.550
that's a thesis of kind of the fat protocol argument

697
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:43.670
<v 6>just for people listening who like me were trying to find their way their way</v>

698
00:39:43.671 --> 00:39:45.980
through the darkness with a lot of this stuff.
When I read that piece,

699
00:39:45.981 --> 00:39:49.850
which is on the union square ventures website.
Yep.
Hi Fred and guys,
uh,

700
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:53.750
I'm blanking on the name of the author.
Very good,
Jill Montenegro.
There we go.

701
00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:55.940
Yeah.
And the,
the,

702
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:59.540
the before and after example that was given,

703
00:39:59.541 --> 00:40:04.460
or one of them was you have these thin protocols,

704
00:40:04.461 --> 00:40:06.290
http,
et Cetera.

705
00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:10.190
And then you have these services built on top of them that becomes silos of

706
00:40:10.191 --> 00:40:14.000
information,
whether that's Facebook,
Google,
whatever it might be.

707
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:16.940
And then they developed their own means of authentication and so on.

708
00:40:16.941 --> 00:40:19.730
So you have these captive stores of information,

709
00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:24.230
you have security risks on top of that.

710
00:40:24.231 --> 00:40:28.010
So now perhaps you are doing your banking through a web server.

711
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:33.290
And conversely,
when you then have the,
and I hate to use this word,

712
00:40:33.291 --> 00:40:38.291
but sort of the democratized data that is built into the protocol itself,

713
00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:41.750
saying the case of Bitcoin,
where now you have all of these nodes that have,

714
00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:46.550
for the purposes of illustration,
every transaction start to finish.
Uh,

715
00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:49.160
it's more secure,
you're less captive.

716
00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:54.470
And it conforms to the libertarian slash ion rand ideals that we were talking

717
00:40:54.471 --> 00:40:55.304
about earlier.

718
00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:59.180
And the illustration that was given that I thought was fascinating and may or

719
00:40:59.181 --> 00:41:02.090
may not hold true for for decades,

720
00:41:02.091 --> 00:41:07.091
but it was that you have protocols that they're necessary but not valuable right

721
00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:11.060
there.
They're available and they're like utility to the public and then you have

722
00:41:11.061 --> 00:41:15.050
these,
these billion dollar multibillion dollar companies built on top of it,

723
00:41:15.051 --> 00:41:18.770
Facebook,
Google,
et cetera.
Then you have conversely bitcoin,

724
00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.960
which has a market cap of X.
I don't know what it is,
current 5 billion today,

725
00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:27.070
and then the company is built on top of it are intentionally small but in the

726
00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:30.170
tens or hundreds of millions at most.
Right.
So it's a complete flip in terms of

727
00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.040
<v 4>yeah,
the value is getting captured by the fat protocol.
Yeah.</v>

728
00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:36.200
I do recommend this article.
It's actually John,
sorry Joel Manet grow.

729
00:41:36.201 --> 00:41:39.500
I got his last name wrong,
but uh,
he wrote a brilliant piece on this,

730
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:41.940
but the thesis is that uh,

731
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:46.400
because these protocols are storing your identity and data on the,

732
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:48.260
on the protocol and the protocol itself,

733
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:50.570
the applications don't capture you as much.

734
00:41:50.571 --> 00:41:55.310
You're not stuck in the applications and the value is captured by the tokens in

735
00:41:55.311 --> 00:41:56.144
the protocol.

736
00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:01.140
<v 6>Does that mean this is,
this is just putting on the investor hat for a second,</v>

737
00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:06.440
that people are going to be incentivized to just create more and more different

738
00:42:06.771 --> 00:42:09.450
types of cryptocurrency and then reserve to try to capture that.

739
00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.620
<v 4>That's exactly what's happening.</v>

740
00:42:10.621 --> 00:42:14.640
So I wrote a post on this called the bitcoin model for crowdfunding and this is

741
00:42:14.641 --> 00:42:17.670
a couple of years back and I thought these things called APP coins would show
up,

742
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:21.360
but for every application rather than going and raising VC money,

743
00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:22.640
you just attach a token to it.

744
00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:26.340
You crowdfunded and that's kind of what's happening now with what they call icls

745
00:42:26.341 --> 00:42:27.510
initial coin offerings.

746
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:31.110
And there's been hundreds and hundreds of these and you know it's a little

747
00:42:31.111 --> 00:42:34.290
bubbly.
In fact,
it's very bubbly.
A lot of them are getting bid up out of control.

748
00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:38.760
Some of it comes from the fact that a few of these protocols do need their own

749
00:42:38.761 --> 00:42:40.380
token.
They can't use bitcoin,

750
00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:44.400
but most of the times it's really just the developers have an incentive to

751
00:42:44.401 --> 00:42:48.170
create a token bolted on and try and capture the value.
But it's,
but it's a,

752
00:42:48.171 --> 00:42:49.530
it's an interesting model for funding,

753
00:42:49.531 --> 00:42:52.770
open source software and protocols that didn't really exist before

754
00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.800
<v 6>our bubbles.
A bad thing.
And this is,</v>

755
00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:58.020
this is something I've also been reading about that I'm really,

756
00:42:58.021 --> 00:43:02.150
I don't know if you have any,
any thoughts on this,
but in many people's minds,

757
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:06.260
bubbles are a bad thing.
But I read a counterargument for the first time today,

758
00:43:06.261 --> 00:43:09.230
which was,
you know,
after a bubble bursts,

759
00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:13.250
then you have out of the money investors who are incentivized in Rick in

760
00:43:13.251 --> 00:43:18.251
regaining the value of what has declined by creating services and applications

761
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.980
that are now these sort of thin applications,

762
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:27.550
which then preserves the sort of long term viability of x,

763
00:43:27.741 --> 00:43:29.990
whatever that might be.
Which I hadn't really considered before.

764
00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:30.251
<v 4>Well,</v>

765
00:43:30.251 --> 00:43:33.850
there is a sense in which many bubbles are unavoidable because the future is a

766
00:43:33.851 --> 00:43:36.410
genuinely uncertain place.
Yeah.
Especially this is,

767
00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:39.240
these are reflexive industries where,
uh,
you know,

768
00:43:39.241 --> 00:43:41.180
the notion of reflexivity is like,

769
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:46.040
my prediction alone changes the potential outcome.
Um,
and uh,

770
00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.650
you know,
the extreme example is like a prediction market.

771
00:43:49.651 --> 00:43:52.380
Predicting the death of somebody.
If there's enough money on that,

772
00:43:52.381 --> 00:43:56.130
it turns into an assassination market.
Um,
so,
uh,

773
00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.320
bubbles are inherently,

774
00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:01.800
I think just apart of any system that involves in network effects.

775
00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:05.280
If I think and money is the ultimate network effect,

776
00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:08.130
I accept US dollars is money because you accept,

777
00:44:08.131 --> 00:44:10.080
you thought was his money and so on.
If we all believe that,

778
00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.210
if we all believe tomorrow the tulips were valuable,
again,

779
00:44:12.211 --> 00:44:13.230
we'd be trading in Tulips.

780
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:17.490
So if I believe that you're going to accept this as money,

781
00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:20.860
then I want to put more money in and you want to put more money in.

782
00:44:20.861 --> 00:44:24.220
The network effects sort of creates a bubble.
And as Nick said,

783
00:44:24.221 --> 00:44:25.700
the future is in an uncertain place.

784
00:44:25.701 --> 00:44:27.790
So sometimes we'll be wrong or we have to step back.

785
00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:31.060
There'll be a little bit of a releasing of energy.
Um,

786
00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:35.310
I read something a couple of years back that said that showed that as the stock

787
00:44:35.311 --> 00:44:39.300
market is becoming more efficient,
it's actually becoming more volatile.

788
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.660
It's not becoming less fall.

789
00:44:40.661 --> 00:44:44.640
It has becoming more volatile because it's reacting faster and faster to

790
00:44:44.641 --> 00:44:45.750
information changes.

791
00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.910
<v 3>That's like the story of why you can look at long term capital management where</v>

792
00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:52.730
there are all sorts of high frequency trading you.
So you have not only humans,

793
00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:56.390
right,
who are in increasingly interconnected,
but you also have computers

794
00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:57.480
<v 4>right now.
There's a,</v>

795
00:44:57.481 --> 00:45:02.100
there's a big train irrelevant in China that causes a political change that

796
00:45:02.101 --> 00:45:03.010
causes a,

797
00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:06.930
the futures market in China to shift that causes the U s stock market to go
down.

798
00:45:06.931 --> 00:45:10.310
Right?
Computers are getting better and better at absorbing that information,

799
00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:12.840
extrapolating it out the consequences.
And uh,

800
00:45:12.841 --> 00:45:15.240
and so the markets have become more and more volatile.

801
00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:19.640
So over time we should see bubbles form faster,

802
00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:24.650
pop more quickly.
Uh,
and I think they'll fall into a power law distribution.

803
00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.600
Like there,
there'll be ones that'll be really large,

804
00:45:26.601 --> 00:45:28.100
there'll be ones that'll be really small and,

805
00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:32.240
but this idea that the future is going to be very smooth and linear and

806
00:45:32.241 --> 00:45:33.890
predictable is a human illusion.

807
00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:39.440
<v 3>Yeah.
Uh,
I think that's fair assumption.</v>

808
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:40.703
Nick,

809
00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:45.980
what are the biggest misconceptions or common misunderstandings related to

810
00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:51.930
cryptocurrency or bitcoin or,
or like what is smart people get wrong?

811
00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:56.580
Uh,
if,
if there's anything where you're like,
God,
this like x drives me nuts.

812
00:45:56.581 --> 00:45:58.680
If I hear one more person who should know better.

813
00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:03.300
<v 5>Well,
we can get into the whole block side just because there's this parameter.</v>

814
00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:07.480
Um,
we shouldn't,
but probably we'll talk about it a little bit there.

815
00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.200
There's this,
there's this,
it's a technical security parameter.

816
00:46:10.201 --> 00:46:13.440
It's called the block size.
How the general public glommed onto this.

817
00:46:13.441 --> 00:46:15.240
I do not know,
but there's,

818
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:20.270
there's an obsessive group of people who think of this as some kind of

819
00:46:20.311 --> 00:46:23.880
artificial barrier to more transactions per second on bitcoin.

820
00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:27.020
Really it's its job as it's,

821
00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:32.140
it's a fence preventing people from over homing flooding to network with lots of

822
00:46:33.321 --> 00:46:36.110
transactions at the full nodes I talked about can handle that.

823
00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:38.900
That transaction history keeps building and building.

824
00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:40.640
<v 4>He had a very simple level.
If,</v>

825
00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:44.480
if every computer storing a copy of every transaction,

826
00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:48.320
then you can't have an infinite number of transactions because the computer will

827
00:46:48.321 --> 00:46:50.480
explode.
And so what you'd do is if you,

828
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:54.590
if you keep increasing the number of transactions to too quickly,

829
00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:59.300
then you only allow a smaller and smaller shrinking set of computers to run the

830
00:46:59.301 --> 00:47:04.280
code,
um,
which reduces who,
who's actually in charge of the security.

831
00:47:04.281 --> 00:47:06.200
Before you might've had a million computers,

832
00:47:06.201 --> 00:47:08.060
then you're down to 100,000 big computers,

833
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:10.700
then there's only a few thousand large players.

834
00:47:10.701 --> 00:47:14.150
Then eventually down to five people who can store the entire history and then

835
00:47:14.151 --> 00:47:15.620
you're basically back to central banks.

836
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:21.130
So the debate is should we keep allowing more and more transactions because what

837
00:47:21.841 --> 00:47:22.141
if people,

838
00:47:22.141 --> 00:47:26.280
everyone wants to buy a Starbucks using it a bitcoin or it should be only

839
00:47:26.281 --> 00:47:30.580
limited to very high value transactions and instead the diversity of people

840
00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:35.460
<v 5>who can,
who can run the code.
Yeah,
I mean this shouldn't even be a public debate.</v>

841
00:47:35.461 --> 00:47:39.120
It's like the public debating and voting on the graphite reactor setting or

842
00:47:39.121 --> 00:47:41.640
graphite
things,

843
00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:45.160
settings that prevent a nuclear actor from over heating and melting down.

844
00:47:45.161 --> 00:47:48.930
And I let them debate the bike shed and there there are certain things you

845
00:47:48.931 --> 00:47:53.370
should let the engineers decide.
And this is one of them.
And uh,

846
00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:58.350
for some reason there's just a whole group of people who want to want to pull

847
00:47:58.351 --> 00:48:02.190
out those graphite moderator rods and have it going full steam.

848
00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.850
Yeah.
One of the problems with the bitcoin is that

849
00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:08.250
<v 4>because a lot of people hold a little bit of Bitcoin,</v>

850
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:10.470
everyone has a financial incentive,

851
00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.290
and they're all talking their own book and they get really emotional about it.

852
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:15.470
<v 5>Nick had this great tweet that I liked,
said,</v>

853
00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:19.540
best way to destroy your investment in Bitcoin is to gather an internet mob to

854
00:48:19.541 --> 00:48:21.200
go and redesign bitcoin.
Right.

855
00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.140
And that's a little bit of what's happening right now.

856
00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:26.540
<v 3>Well,
you were saying,
you know,
before we started recording that a lot of you've,</v>

857
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:30.680
you've never seen so many scientists to be uncivil towards one another.

858
00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:33.430
<v 4>Yeah.
I think,
I think the,
the worst Twitter is Trump Twitter,</v>

859
00:48:33.431 --> 00:48:35.640
where everyone's getting outraged over politics all the time.

860
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:37.920
But the second worst Twitter right now is blockchain Twitter,

861
00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:43.550
where you will have PhDs from Cornell and university of Maryland and all kinds

862
00:48:43.561 --> 00:48:47.940
of credential places,
literally calling each other horrific names online,

863
00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:51.720
a casting aspersions,
other people's moral cat,
moral character,

864
00:48:51.721 --> 00:48:53.670
calling them trolls,
uh,

865
00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:58.260
dragging them through the mud and they each have their little local tribal mob

866
00:48:58.261 --> 00:49:01.740
behind them over things like the block size debate,
which has an exist,
you know,

867
00:49:01.741 --> 00:49:04.470
it's actually in the parameter settings in a nuclear reactor.
Well,

868
00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:06.860
<v 3>it's a,
I mean it makes me think of,</v>

869
00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:09.260
they're a bunch of sort of expressions that jumped to mind.

870
00:49:09.261 --> 00:49:10.880
You're saying you're talking their own book.

871
00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:15.140
So the uninformed as to be very careful about asking a Barbara if they need a

872
00:49:15.141 --> 00:49:17.470
haircut.
Right.
You need to know what the incentives are.
Exactly.

873
00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:21.050
And I'm sure people have heard the expression,
it's not very flattering,

874
00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:25.020
but men is as loyal as his options might be.
You know,

875
00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:28.820
a scientist or someone who is otherwise civil is as civil as their incentives,

876
00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:32.000
right?
Yes.
Once you have enough to gain or lose.

877
00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:34.580
<v 4>Yeah.
Incentives are everything.
Charlie Munger says,</v>

878
00:49:34.581 --> 00:49:38.050
if you can be working on incentives,
don't work on anything else.
Uh,
and,

879
00:49:38.051 --> 00:49:40.160
and it's that,
you know,
going back to Bitcoin,

880
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:43.580
the bitcoin designed for a second big bitcoin is brilliantly designed because

881
00:49:43.581 --> 00:49:45.410
the underlying game theory and incentives.

882
00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:48.480
<v 3>Yeah.
Could we talk just for a second about what is bitcoin?</v>

883
00:49:48.481 --> 00:49:51.270
So we talked about cryptocurrency.
What makes,

884
00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:54.490
what made bitcoin and what makes bitcoin unique,

885
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:57.010
<v 5>if,
if that's,
if we could maybe talk about that.</v>

886
00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.540
You can think about it in a couple laters.

887
00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:03.280
The most important and fundamental layer is a computer science later layer where

888
00:50:03.281 --> 00:50:08.281
we prove that it would take 51% of the computational power of the hash rate to

889
00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:12.310
attack this thing and do things like double spend

890
00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:15.570
<v 4>basically changing that ledger,
right?
So it's like you can't change the ledger.</v>

891
00:50:15.571 --> 00:50:19.380
The beauty is the fly in amber analogy is a great one because once we,

892
00:50:19.381 --> 00:50:20.670
you and I done a transaction,

893
00:50:20.671 --> 00:50:23.500
then network has agreed on the transaction going back and then doing it is

894
00:50:23.501 --> 00:50:27.350
nearly impossible.
But while that amber is being laid down,

895
00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:29.060
I can still be some mischief.
Right?

896
00:50:29.061 --> 00:50:31.700
So one of the big misconceptions of Bitcoin is that,
well,

897
00:50:31.701 --> 00:50:36.050
if 51% of the computers in the network,
which are run by people called miners,

898
00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:38.870
the coal miners,
this the old,
and now you're digging for gold,

899
00:50:38.871 --> 00:50:40.010
so they're digging for bitcoin.

900
00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:42.440
But really what they're doing is they're laying down that amber,

901
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:44.780
if 51% of these people collude,

902
00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:48.650
then does that mean they can go back and change the ledger?
No,

903
00:50:48.651 --> 00:50:50.570
they can't change the existing leisure,

904
00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:54.260
but they end cause mischief with the current transaction or the current layer

905
00:50:54.261 --> 00:50:56.570
that's being laid down.
It's one of the big misconceptions.

906
00:50:57.070 --> 00:50:58.370
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

907
00:50:58.450 --> 00:51:02.770
<v 5>Yeah.
So that's the one of the computer science limitations of it and,</v>

908
00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:05.760
and the other one is doing software upgrades.

909
00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:09.420
Software upgrades kind of changed the rules even more.
So.
Yeah.

910
00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:12.430
And so those two things end up getting,

911
00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:16.180
especially it's a software upgrades end up getting very politicized.

912
00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:20.040
<v 4>Yeah.
Bitcoin fundamentally what,
what's going on?
It's uh,
uh,</v>

913
00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.680
nick first create a bit gold.
Right.

914
00:51:22.681 --> 00:51:25.380
Do you wanna talk about what the innovation bit cold was or how the big goal

915
00:51:25.381 --> 00:51:27.260
system work and then we can layer on bitcoin on sure.

916
00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:31.300
<v 5>But called was inspired by a kind of this origins of money research and how do
I,</v>

917
00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:36.100
and also there was an area called private banking or you could take your bank

918
00:51:36.101 --> 00:51:38.680
note and go up to bank windowing.
It gold and the bank,

919
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:43.320
the paper money we have today looks very much like these bank notes did,
um,

920
00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:47.000
a thing I call authority resemblance or sort of faking and pretending to that

921
00:51:47.001 --> 00:51:49.050
this is still really valuable stuff.
Um,

922
00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:51.880
and the illusion works apparently for the most part,
but uh,

923
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:53.440
but they used to work very differently.

924
00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:56.320
Used to be able to go up to window and get actual gold for your paper.

925
00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:59.550
<v 4>Yeah.
It's between green flat until they've seen it.</v>

926
00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.650
<v 5>Yeah,
it was debt.
Now it's just the paper itself.</v>

927
00:52:01.651 --> 00:52:05.010
You've got to just trust the paper itself from the Federal Reserve.
But um,

928
00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:07.060
in any case,
I was inspired by what

929
00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:08.640
<v 4>peaches,
a Fiat currency.
I never actually,</v>

930
00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:13.090
Fiat currency is just a paper that's backed by nothing.
So before it was shells,

931
00:52:13.091 --> 00:52:14.170
then we went to gold,

932
00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:17.770
then we went to gold back paper and now we're down to just paper.
Okay.

933
00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.520
<v 5>Creating that bank note itself is easy enough to do.</v>

934
00:52:20.521 --> 00:52:24.780
That's basically what paypal and a company I was working for called digicash

935
00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:25.770
David Shalman stuff.

936
00:52:25.771 --> 00:52:29.920
We're doing that trust based paper note that was issued by some central

937
00:52:29.921 --> 00:52:30.750
authority,

938
00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:33.030
but I became dissatisfied with that because then at the end of the day,

939
00:52:33.031 --> 00:52:34.890
you want to go to that window and get something else.

940
00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:38.160
That's more what I call trust minimized.

941
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:40.500
So gold is valuable all over the world.

942
00:52:40.501 --> 00:52:42.900
If you go back to these more primitive tribes,

943
00:52:42.901 --> 00:52:46.950
the gold and the shells and so forth,
you know,
you can pay them to next time,

944
00:52:46.951 --> 00:52:49.740
next time I'm over all your neighbors would accept them as well.

945
00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:50.970
They wouldn't accept your,

946
00:52:50.971 --> 00:52:54.060
your IOU because you know you're not going to trust people.

947
00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:57.280
You could go word war with tomorrow,
but they would accept,
um,

948
00:52:57.450 --> 00:52:59.820
the shells or the copper beads of the gold beads,

949
00:52:59.821 --> 00:53:02.820
the first gold artifact by the ways of being the first copper artifact.

950
00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:07.410
Those apparently the most important,
earliest uses of,
of,
of metal,

951
00:53:07.411 --> 00:53:12.320
not knives or weapons or tools or so forth in any case.
So,
um,

952
00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:17.310
so I was looking for this trust minimizing like how to do this in cyberspace.
Um,

953
00:53:17.311 --> 00:53:19.140
since I had read stuff,

954
00:53:19.141 --> 00:53:23.460
I know it's not just some magical property of gold that makes it valuable and

955
00:53:23.461 --> 00:53:28.200
other things aren't or something.
Um,
or some intrinsic,
you know,
it started off,

956
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:31.650
you can use it in elect,
you know,
electrical circuits or so forth.

957
00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:33.840
Now there's something about,
um,

958
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:37.830
when I call the unfordable costliness of at the scarcity of it,

959
00:53:37.831 --> 00:53:39.990
then naturally trust,
minimize scarcity of it.

960
00:53:39.991 --> 00:53:41.850
You don't have to trust somebody to keep it scarce.

961
00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:45.200
I tried to recreate this in cyberspace using proof of work,
um,

962
00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:49.300
Adam back hash cash.
And so basically the bit gold design did that.

963
00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:51.760
And then it used a replication technique,

964
00:53:52.090 --> 00:53:55.540
which had originally been developed that,
I apologize,
can backtrack,

965
00:53:55.541 --> 00:53:57.730
but the proof of work,
what do you,
what do you mean by that?
Okay,

966
00:53:57.731 --> 00:53:59.920
so proof of work is a mathematical puzzle,

967
00:53:59.921 --> 00:54:04.480
a computation that the computer does that says,
okay,
you have to solve this.

968
00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:09.070
And we know from computer science it'll take so long to solve.
Um,

969
00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:11.570
but we also know from computer science that it's,

970
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.990
it's a kind of a problem that you can improve the hardware,

971
00:54:15.991 --> 00:54:19.380
which is why everybody uses design specialized hardware for it.
Got It.
Now,

972
00:54:19.381 --> 00:54:23.920
because,
um,
unlike normal cryptography,
it's,
well,

973
00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:27.450
it's not even unlike normal cryptography in that way,
but um,

974
00:54:27.451 --> 00:54:30.180
it's something that you can do a lot faster if you have hardware

975
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:33.070
<v 4>proof.
Proof of work is basically,
you have to,</v>

976
00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:37.140
you have people here who are basically laying down a layer of amber on the fly,

977
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:40.890
right?
And so they have to basically commit resources to do it.

978
00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:44.490
It has to be costly to do that.
You need scarcity in this system,
right?

979
00:54:44.491 --> 00:54:48.120
So that's that scarcity is created by the costliness of the computing power that

980
00:54:48.121 --> 00:54:48.954
you throw at it.

981
00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:52.680
So basically the more computer power you want to throw at the bitcoin network,

982
00:54:52.681 --> 00:54:54.930
the more seriously the bitcoin network takes your vote.

983
00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:59.220
And we have to know your computing power is dedicated to the bitcoin network.

984
00:54:59.221 --> 00:55:01.830
It's not,
you know,
off surfing the internet or doing something else.

985
00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:06.180
So you have to commit it to doing work just for the bitcoin network.

986
00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:08.580
And the proof is through mathematical functions.

987
00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:11.730
So you basically have puzzles to solve the bitcoin network,

988
00:55:11.731 --> 00:55:14.730
the algorithms give the computer's puzzles to solve.

989
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.050
If the computer solve the puzzles,
they can prove that yes,
I put economic value,

990
00:55:19.051 --> 00:55:22.800
time,
heat,
power,
computation into solving this problem.

991
00:55:22.801 --> 00:55:26.790
So now I get a vote on what the ledger looks like and I get a chance to be paid

992
00:55:26.791 --> 00:55:28.800
in coin.
So this is what the miner to do.

993
00:55:28.801 --> 00:55:32.850
The miners do the work to secure the network using computers.

994
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:35.140
They provide that proof to the network.

995
00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:38.890
The network pays them in new coins that it's my,
that is minting.
Got It.

996
00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:40.520
<v 5>Anyway,
so,
um,
no,</v>

997
00:55:40.521 --> 00:55:43.700
Satoshi had an innovation where he uses this proof of work as part of the

998
00:55:43.701 --> 00:55:47.620
security and for people who don't know,
who is Sitoshi who that name,

999
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:52.410
well it's some unknown character out there that has disappeared.
Yeah.
Our group.

1000
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:55.020
<v 4>Yeah.
Whoever,
whoever created bit coin,
you know,</v>

1001
00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:59.090
obviously built on Nick's work,
built on a health fund,

1002
00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:00.480
his work a way.

1003
00:56:00.481 --> 00:56:04.590
There were a couple of great computer scientists who did this work.
Um,

1004
00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:08.460
but whoever actually built the working implementation because I think nick you

1005
00:56:08.461 --> 00:56:12.120
had,
you had the theory of big goal but you're not as serious and a programmer to

1006
00:56:12.121 --> 00:56:12.440
create

1007
00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:15.290
<v 5>bit cold.
Well I'm a serious programmer but I was too,
uh,</v>

1008
00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:19.460
didn't get around to programming bit cold.
So yeah,
it was a design

1009
00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:23.410
<v 4>and so whoever created Bitcoin,
it probably group,</v>

1010
00:56:23.411 --> 00:56:25.420
cause it looks like a very sophisticated effort.

1011
00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:29.350
Did it pseudonymously or anonymously and the,
the,
the,

1012
00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:32.200
the name that they used was Satoshi Nakamoto,

1013
00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:36.120
<v 5>Vic olders.
It's designed on the 32 uses proof of work as a,</v>

1014
00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:40.170
what I call unforgivable costliness or diction strain.
The supply curves,

1015
00:56:40.171 --> 00:56:44.520
you know,
it's scarce and is big innovation was to,

1016
00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:48.700
well let me backtrack and describe a little more big old.
So,
um,
there's a,

1017
00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:53.280
a protocol design for to keep airplanes from crashing because you don't want

1018
00:56:53.281 --> 00:56:56.510
your computer to go crash on an airplane and cause the airplane to crash,
right?

1019
00:56:56.511 --> 00:57:00.860
Right.
You want to your computer to be able to crash an airplane that the airline

1020
00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:04.890
itself going on.
So,
um,
what you need is to distribute the surrounds.

1021
00:57:04.891 --> 00:57:08.880
You have several chips all around the airplane and then they talk to each other.

1022
00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:11.070
And then if they get contradictory information,

1023
00:57:11.071 --> 00:57:14.790
they do what you might call voting.
They'll pick the majority,
um,

1024
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.120
and considered that to be the correct one.
And that turns out to be,

1025
00:57:18.121 --> 00:57:20.670
they mathematically proved that this was the optimal model,

1026
00:57:20.671 --> 00:57:25.290
given those assumptions that you know,
how many chips there are and so forth.

1027
00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:28.050
Um,
and this is called Byzantine consensus.

1028
00:57:28.350 --> 00:57:33.000
So I took that and used it for this replication business to replicate the data

1029
00:57:33.001 --> 00:57:34.940
around the ledger round,
um,

1030
00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:38.970
with a Merkle tree for the transaction history and so forth.
Um,

1031
00:57:38.971 --> 00:57:41.820
what's the Toshi did was a really big innovation besides of course actually

1032
00:57:41.821 --> 00:57:44.370
making software people could use,
which I never did.

1033
00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:47.610
He is the proof of work in security subs on the Internet.

1034
00:57:47.611 --> 00:57:50.040
You can't count your chips securely.
You don't know.

1035
00:57:50.041 --> 00:57:52.680
I have a chip in the tail and a chip and the wing and so forth.

1036
00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.890
The sock puppet problem people,

1037
00:57:54.891 --> 00:57:58.520
one person can be pretend to be a hundred and we're one computer can pretend to

1038
00:57:58.521 --> 00:58:02.760
be a hundred Satoshi based it on proof of work basis security,
that voting.

1039
00:58:02.761 --> 00:58:07.000
Like if the preponderance of the Hash rate tells me that the transaction is

1040
00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:11.490
history's been updated in such,
in such a way,
then that's,
that's it.
And again,

1041
00:58:11.491 --> 00:58:13.080
that's good.
Up to 51%

1042
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:16.390
<v 4>and swearing the 51% attack comes from basically one computation.</v>

1043
00:58:16.391 --> 00:58:20.560
One vote is the way to think about it.
Got It.
Um,
and,

1044
00:58:20.570 --> 00:58:22.320
and actually one of the,

1045
00:58:22.830 --> 00:58:25.740
one of the problems that people have with the bitcoin network is designed,

1046
00:58:25.741 --> 00:58:26.574
so basically a Bitcoin,

1047
00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:29.940
you have all these computers around the world that are joining together to

1048
00:58:29.941 --> 00:58:31.980
create this shared blockchain computer.

1049
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:36.090
They get votes in proportion to how much CPU power they're allocating.

1050
00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:40.350
They vote on what the valid transactions or that then go into this ledger and

1051
00:58:40.351 --> 00:58:44.940
get sealed in the ember of the blockchain.
And the whole system kind of works.

1052
00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:47.400
But a naive person looking from the outside,
as you said,

1053
00:58:47.401 --> 00:58:48.870
like the hippies coming into blockchains,

1054
00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:53.220
one of their first objections is you're wasting all this computer power.

1055
00:58:53.221 --> 00:58:55.640
You're wasting all this energy.
Um,

1056
00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:59.610
you're wasting all this network resources because they're constantly chatting

1057
00:58:59.611 --> 00:59:02.010
with each other and network.
These computers are broadcasting packets,

1058
00:59:02.011 --> 00:59:06.610
these are all the time.
And they just say it's wasteful.
Um,
but,
uh,

1059
00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:09.370
and,
and I think that was an argument that a lot of people make.

1060
00:59:09.371 --> 00:59:12.250
And even I kind of fell for that one where I was like,
okay,
you know,

1061
00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:15.520
eventually someone will come up with a better solution than proof of work and go

1062
00:59:15.521 --> 00:59:18.880
to proof of stake or a few other kinds of ideas that have been thrown around.

1063
00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:23.840
And then nick just recently wrote this brilliant piece,
uh,
on social scalability.

1064
00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:27.650
Um,
and by the,
you got a doctorate recently,
an honorary doctorate.

1065
00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:32.390
<v 5>Oh yeah.
At the university Universidad Francisco mark wine.</v>

1066
00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:35.110
<v 4>Yeah.
And a Guatemalan,
what is your doctorate in?</v>

1067
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:39.490
It's and social sciences and also an honorary professorship as well.
So yeah,

1068
00:59:39.491 --> 00:59:41.170
that's great.
That's a very long,

1069
00:59:41.230 --> 00:59:45.370
the only a social scientist I'm gonna talk at this level,

1070
00:59:45.610 --> 00:59:47.940
but I mean that's the kind of honorary doctorate they give.
Yeah.

1071
00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:51.910
<v 5>Yeah.
But yeah,
it's lots of luminary.
So yeah,
I'm very honored to have that.</v>

1072
00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:56.020
<v 4>Yeah.
They cited your social scalability article and so,
uh,</v>

1073
00:59:56.250 --> 00:59:59.460
the social scalability argument,
I thought it was a really powerful one.

1074
00:59:59.461 --> 01:00:01.950
I don't know if you want to try and summarize that for the listeners.

1075
01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.920
<v 5>I'm sure.
So the idea,</v>

1076
01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:07.890
the basic idea is that if you look at a graph of human capabilities,

1077
01:00:07.891 --> 01:00:11.320
it's basically flat where the same Iq is.
We had,
you know,
um,

1078
01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:15.210
so there's a small thing called the Flynn effect,
but an Internet,
um,
you know,

1079
01:00:15.211 --> 01:00:16.200
a hundred thousand years ago,

1080
01:00:16.201 --> 01:00:18.690
our brains were roughly the same size as they are today.

1081
01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:23.520
And a computers on the other hand have been,
you know,
doubling every few years,

1082
01:00:23.521 --> 01:00:27.600
their capabilities,
um,
in various ways,
their memory,
their CPU power,

1083
01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:30.660
a network bandwidth and so forth.
And so,

1084
01:00:30.661 --> 01:00:33.960
and you can think of this in the future and get into all sorts of speculation

1085
01:00:33.961 --> 01:00:36.000
about the future.
But what I like to think of it as,

1086
01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:37.590
as we have this whole surplus,

1087
01:00:37.591 --> 01:00:42.591
we've built up of resources and yet we're still doing things institutionally

1088
01:00:42.661 --> 01:00:46.770
with armies of bureaucrats and stuff.
Very similar to what we're doing.
You know,

1089
01:00:46.771 --> 01:00:48.500
when computers were,
you know,

1090
01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:51.990
a thousands of the power they are now or millions of the power they are now or

1091
01:00:51.991 --> 01:00:55.260
what they were doing in the Mongol Empire.
So in any case,

1092
01:00:55.261 --> 01:00:56.760
so can we do some substitutions?

1093
01:00:56.761 --> 01:00:59.220
Can we substitute take advantage of this great surplus?

1094
01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:03.000
So computer scientists are normally an engineer's,
are normally trained to think,

1095
01:01:03.001 --> 01:01:05.730
optimize the machine,
make the machine itself really efficient.

1096
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:09.800
What I'm saying is that you can think the other way.

1097
01:01:09.801 --> 01:01:14.801
Are there ways to make the machine a lot less efficient and give you some

1098
01:01:15.321 --> 01:01:18.920
greater capability so that such as,
for example,

1099
01:01:18.921 --> 01:01:23.200
the ability of somebody in Albania to pay somebody in Zimbabwe,
um,

1100
01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:27.080
without going through a trusted intermediary or human bureaucracy,

1101
01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:29.650
ways to do that.
You know,

1102
01:01:30.130 --> 01:01:33.310
even if they cost a lot more and look really bad to an engineer likes to think

1103
01:01:33.311 --> 01:01:37.390
about efficiency.
So,
and pick coins,
a great example of that.
It's a proof of work,

1104
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:41.830
um,
as part of its security.
And,
and in my mind to create that,

1105
01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:42.880
that scarcity,

1106
01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:44.640
<v 4>stepping back for a second,</v>

1107
01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:49.020
what separates humans from other animals is that we are social across genetic

1108
01:01:49.021 --> 01:01:51.810
boundaries.
So you know,
even the end of the falls,

1109
01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.130
you can have 150 neanderthals on a battlefield because they're all genetically

1110
01:01:56.131 --> 01:01:56.964
related.

1111
01:01:56.970 --> 01:02:00.270
But you can have 5,000 homo sapiens in the battlefield because they believe in

1112
01:02:00.271 --> 01:02:04.380
the abstract idea of Christianity and they can communicate that story to each

1113
01:02:04.381 --> 01:02:05.160
other,
right?

1114
01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:10.160
And so bitcoin enables a form of social scalability where it allows now humans

1115
01:02:11.521 --> 01:02:14.640
who don't know each other,
who don't trust each other,

1116
01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:18.150
who may never see each other again and don't even reveal their identities or

1117
01:02:18.151 --> 01:02:22.730
locations to each does still transact securely,
not just with money,

1118
01:02:22.731 --> 01:02:23.930
but also with contracts.

1119
01:02:23.931 --> 01:02:26.720
Any complex logic they can dream up that they can code up,

1120
01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:30.950
they can do it through this very slow and very inefficient computer,

1121
01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:33.770
but it removes all these layers of humans,

1122
01:02:33.771 --> 01:02:36.170
bureaucrats and toll takers from the operation.

1123
01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:39.860
<v 6>Well,
right?
So you're able to exceed the Dunbar number,
right?</v>

1124
01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:42.350
<v 4>Yeah,
the 150 people Dunbar number.</v>

1125
01:02:42.351 --> 01:02:45.100
So you're basically trading computational scalability

1126
01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:50.510
<v 6>for social scalability.
And just to maybe put it another way,</v>

1127
01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:53.990
and I'd love to be corrective,
this isn't right,
but uh,
there's a,

1128
01:02:54.050 --> 01:02:56.690
there's another quote of yours,
nick,
that I really liked.

1129
01:02:57.150 --> 01:03:01.500
Trusted third parties are security holes I think relates to this very nicely.

1130
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:06.120
And there is a bit on blockchain computers that I think is relevant.
So why,

1131
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:10.440
why make the tradeoff?
Why allow all of this inefficiency,
right?

1132
01:03:10.441 --> 01:03:13.400
And I'm not going to read this entire thing,
but it,

1133
01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:15.600
it's the blockchain computer.

1134
01:03:15.601 --> 01:03:18.270
This distributed blockchain computers much slower and more costly than a web

1135
01:03:18.271 --> 01:03:22.830
server,
but one very rough estimate about 10,000 times slower and more costly.

1136
01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:25.400
But since on the blockchain,
you're,

1137
01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:28.220
you're running the portion of an application that needs to be the most reliable

1138
01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:33.221
and secure what you call a fiduciary called a code because the downside risk is

1139
01:03:34.851 --> 01:03:39.230
so high,
you can afford to have tons of inefficiency,

1140
01:03:39.231 --> 01:03:44.231
particularly with hardware that is dropping in cost and increasing in capability

1141
01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.220
year on year,

1142
01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:50.180
<v 5>right?
Yeah.
We,
we've accumulated this great,
great hardware capacity surplus that,</v>

1143
01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:54.460
that we're only starting to take advantage of and so you can use that to do like

1144
01:03:54.461 --> 01:03:55.510
the proof of work,
the very,

1145
01:03:55.511 --> 01:04:00.490
the strong security protocols that take some computational effort and the also

1146
01:04:00.491 --> 01:04:03.520
the making the copies.
We have lots of memory,
lots of disk space,

1147
01:04:03.521 --> 01:04:07.260
lots of bandwidth,
not vast amounts but enough to you can,

1148
01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:10.660
you can take a small transaction and replicated around the world,

1149
01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:13.910
make thousands of copies that helps create stuff fly in amber.

1150
01:04:13.911 --> 01:04:17.570
In fact where you can't deny it later cause everybody's got copies of it.

1151
01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.680
<v 4>Yeah.
In a way like,
uh,</v>

1152
01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:23.680
I think you had a definition of social skill that in your article it's not

1153
01:04:23.681 --> 01:04:27.520
precise but close enough where you basically said one way to estimate how

1154
01:04:27.521 --> 01:04:32.290
socially scalable technology is is by how many people can use it.
Right.

1155
01:04:32.590 --> 01:04:37.300
And uh,
when it comes to cash today,
like,
like the u s dollar,

1156
01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.540
it's accepted probably the most widely accepted currency in the world,

1157
01:04:40.541 --> 01:04:44.560
but we're still talking hundreds of millions to maybe a billion people can

1158
01:04:44.561 --> 01:04:48.040
really use it in their everyday life.
Whereas bitcoin in theory,
when it's,
uh,

1159
01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:52.180
when it's adopted,
can be used by anyone to pay anyone.

1160
01:04:52.181 --> 01:04:55.630
As long as you connected to the internet and everyone's connecting to the

1161
01:04:55.631 --> 01:04:57.200
internet,
it scales better.

1162
01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:00.860
<v 6>I'm going to ask a question that came up a lot and it's one that I don't have</v>

1163
01:05:00.861 --> 01:05:04.150
any,
any ability to answer.
Is it possible to,

1164
01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:09.180
for any government entity to regulate bitcoin or crypto currencies out of

1165
01:05:10.541 --> 01:05:12.130
existence?
If so,

1166
01:05:12.131 --> 01:05:16.720
where would you put the likelihood of of such a thing happening or being able to

1167
01:05:16.721 --> 01:05:18.120
be,
why are you,
because

1168
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:19.690
<v 4>he's copies are all over the world.</v>

1169
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.150
They're never going to get rid of these copies.

1170
01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:25.420
So he's always going to have the transaction history and can start it up again.

1171
01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:29.800
Yup.
So at that,
and it's sense makes it very difficult to regulate.

1172
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:35.190
There are easier parts of it to regulate such as the exchanging of Fiat currency

1173
01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:39.910
or local currency to bitcoin and back and forth.

1174
01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:42.490
Those still happen through centralized exchanges,

1175
01:05:42.850 --> 01:05:47.470
which both makes them fairly easy to regulate and also it makes them insecure,

1176
01:05:47.471 --> 01:05:49.120
trusted.
Third parties are security holes,

1177
01:05:49.121 --> 01:05:51.850
so if you want to get in and out of Bitcoin,

1178
01:05:51.851 --> 01:05:55.780
you're usually doing it through these centralized exchanges and that's where the

1179
01:05:55.781 --> 01:06:00.240
vast majority of of thefts and hacks of of Bitcoin have occurred.

1180
01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:03.570
These extended,
the exchanges essentially ended up like banks.
They're honeypots,

1181
01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:07.170
so regulators and honeypots for thieves.
How do you buy or sell,

1182
01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:11.280
say bitcoin without going through you today?
You do that through a central,

1183
01:06:11.290 --> 01:06:15.040
through an exchange.
There's also sort of local meetups.
There's like a,

1184
01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:18.370
there's these sites like local bitcoins and there's a few others.

1185
01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:21.460
There's a big one coming up in China and now we can just sort of coordinate a

1186
01:06:21.461 --> 01:06:25.310
meetup with somebody in a dark alley and you exchange cash for bitcoin.
Um,

1187
01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:27.670
so that people can fall back to that.
And,

1188
01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:31.720
and the volume on those kinds of distributed exchanges has gone up a lot.

1189
01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:35.080
Um,
if you look at bit torrent,

1190
01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:37.870
which is the file sharing technologies are accounts where like a ridiculous

1191
01:06:37.871 --> 01:06:41.590
amount of internet traffic,
Bram Cohen and invented it.
Um,
you know,

1192
01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:45.520
that thing on given day can account for being a quarter to half of Internet

1193
01:06:45.521 --> 01:06:48.970
traffic and you can bet the governments and it had been trying to shut that down

1194
01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:52.570
because right now the governments are overzealous and nothing in so much as

1195
01:06:52.571 --> 01:06:55.370
enforcing copyright law.
I mean,
you want to drive,
you know,

1196
01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:58.530
you want to drop the full weight of the federal government on you.
Um,

1197
01:06:58.870 --> 01:07:02.110
you either engage in terrorist activity or we violet cooperate.

1198
01:07:03.090 --> 01:07:05.290
They'll like roughly equivalent,
right?

1199
01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.690
They'll drop helicopters and your house in New Zealand,

1200
01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:10.570
you ask him.com for violating copyright law,

1201
01:07:10.571 --> 01:07:13.870
even if you've never set foot in the u s such an understated lifestyle,

1202
01:07:14.610 --> 01:07:18.520
he was so subtle,
even know how to call it on to him.
Um,
but yeah,
so,

1203
01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:23.320
uh,
I don't,
I don't think governments can really shut it down.
Uh,
not only that,

1204
01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:27.880
but any government that really embraces bitcoin or any of these cryptocurrency

1205
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:28.840
doesn't have to be big coin.

1206
01:07:28.841 --> 01:07:31.310
They can even kind of start up a new one if they want it to,

1207
01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:36.520
is just going to benefit so much from really owning the money that's native to

1208
01:07:36.521 --> 01:07:41.350
the Internet.
You know,
I called Bitcoin the Internet of money because it's,
uh,

1209
01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:44.590
it's really native to how code works.

1210
01:07:44.590 --> 01:07:47.290
So if you really want to future proof yourself,
it's like,
it's like,

1211
01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:50.360
imagine if the u s crack down on it and said no more cryptocurrencies.

1212
01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:53.800
That would be saying like saying no more http.
Right.

1213
01:07:53.830 --> 01:07:58.000
And the country that did adopt HTP.
And by the way,
this is the HTP of money.

1214
01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:01.270
What ended up so much better off that used to be shooting yourself in the head.

1215
01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:03.370
Um,
so I think smart people,

1216
01:08:03.371 --> 01:08:08.050
smart money in the u s already recognizes that and so it's seeping up into the

1217
01:08:08.051 --> 01:08:10.360
government where they're figuring out that yeah,
we could,

1218
01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:14.680
we could be draconian about this.
We'll just drive it out of the country.

1219
01:08:14.681 --> 01:08:16.040
It's already to some extent,

1220
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:18.590
although the ICO that are happening are happening out of Switzerland or

1221
01:08:18.591 --> 01:08:20.060
Gibraltar,
um,

1222
01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:24.050
those teams are leaving the u s actually cause especially a place like New York

1223
01:08:24.051 --> 01:08:26.730
has been a very heavy handed in their regulations.
Um,

1224
01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.520
so you're just driving out innovation.

1225
01:08:29.090 --> 01:08:30.830
<v 6>What is the incentive for,</v>

1226
01:08:30.831 --> 01:08:35.831
Say New York to be supportive or at least maybe cast a blind eye to development

1227
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:41.090
of this type of tech?

1228
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:46.100
<v 4>Well,
it's just like the Internet took out Hollywood with Netflix and uh,</v>

1229
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:47.480
you know,
um,
uh,

1230
01:08:47.481 --> 01:08:52.481
Spotify and it took out newspapers with publishing and Twitter and Facebook.

1231
01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:57.880
Um,
and it's taken out,
uh,
you know,
all kinds of industries.
Um,

1232
01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:01.940
the Internet is going to fundamentally change and possibly take out the finance

1233
01:09:01.941 --> 01:09:03.080
industry as we know it.

1234
01:09:03.530 --> 01:09:07.970
And the new finance industry is going to settle wherever the home of innovation

1235
01:09:07.971 --> 01:09:10.730
is for smart contracts and crypto currency.
This is my belief,

1236
01:09:10.731 --> 01:09:12.770
obviously not investment advice,
but um,

1237
01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:16.970
I think this is Silicon Valley's replacement of a lot of the infrastructure of

1238
01:09:16.971 --> 01:09:20.030
finance.
And so if New York chooses to drive that out,

1239
01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:22.250
then New York will no longer be the center of finance.

1240
01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:23.920
<v 6>Got It.</v>

1241
01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:25.390
<v 4>I,
every time I go to New York,</v>

1242
01:09:25.391 --> 01:09:28.120
I'm actually highly entertained because I see all these huge powers.

1243
01:09:28.121 --> 01:09:32.800
I see all these people in suits and I know that 90% of them will be obsolete

1244
01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:33.634
within 20 years.

1245
01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:36.490
<v 6>Nice horse and buggy pal.</v>

1246
01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:37.693
<v 4>Yeah,
I would,</v>

1247
01:09:37.730 --> 01:09:41.270
I would not be thinking about going into investment banking right now because a

1248
01:09:41.271 --> 01:09:44.780
lot of that job is going to be automated.
Commercial Banking,
automated,
you know,

1249
01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:47.540
the bankers were the miners of the last generation.

1250
01:09:48.230 --> 01:09:51.770
They got paid in the currency to secure the currency.
So when the Fed wants to,

1251
01:09:51.930 --> 01:09:53.600
they weren't even the minors.
So the traders,
yeah.

1252
01:09:53.601 --> 01:09:56.390
Well the Fed wants to distribute currency to give it to the banks and guess
what?

1253
01:09:56.391 --> 01:09:57.020
The banks,

1254
01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:00.560
the banks have sticky fingers and then the allocated out to the rest of us very

1255
01:10:00.561 --> 01:10:04.700
sparingly.
Um,
and the new bankers are the miners.

1256
01:10:04.730 --> 01:10:06.980
The new fed is the cryptographers,

1257
01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:10.940
but really the new owners of the infrastructure or the holders of the coin,

1258
01:10:10.941 --> 01:10:13.030
which is everybody,
or could be everybody

1259
01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:18.560
<v 6>is cryptocurrency or let's say bitcoin inversely correlated to any particular</v>

1260
01:10:19.471 --> 01:10:22.920
other asset classes.
For instance,
when people are fearful of say,

1261
01:10:23.730 --> 01:10:27.210
currency devaluation,
they've,
they might run to gold,
right?

1262
01:10:27.211 --> 01:10:30.870
It's seen this in places like Argentina is seen in the u s seed all over it.

1263
01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:34.980
Do you see that also with Bitcoin in a particular pattern?

1264
01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:39.220
<v 4>Yeah,
they,
they,
they definitely are a store of value because bitcoin,</v>

1265
01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:42.450
there's only gonna be 21 million ever.
The whole way the protocol is designed.

1266
01:10:42.451 --> 01:10:46.120
You can't create a single one more and a bunch of been lost.
So,
you know,

1267
01:10:46.121 --> 01:10:50.350
cause they're hard to secure.
Uh,
hold on.
They get lost.
Well,

1268
01:10:50.351 --> 01:10:52.890
you could lose your keys.
So you call ice saying,
come up with something.

1269
01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:56.410
Really keep forgetting your Goddamn,
or you're trying to defend it.

1270
01:10:56.411 --> 01:10:57.530
You're trying to hide it from hackers.

1271
01:10:57.650 --> 01:11:00.790
So you come up with some really elaborate scheme and how to secure it and then

1272
01:11:00.791 --> 01:11:03.730
you lose it.
Or people that have lost the computer that it was on.
You know?

1273
01:11:03.731 --> 01:11:06.160
So there's,
have you heard any catastrophic story?

1274
01:11:06.161 --> 01:11:07.980
I'm sure there's stories of people with like,
you know,

1275
01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:11.650
digging through a garbage dumps with bulldozers,

1276
01:11:11.651 --> 01:11:14.550
trying to find that old computer which they threw out,
which had,
you know,

1277
01:11:14.551 --> 01:11:16.090
10,000 bitcoin on it.
Yeah.
Hmm.

1278
01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:17.710
<v 5>You need,
you need to get a hardware wallets.</v>

1279
01:11:17.711 --> 01:11:22.711
It makes encrypted backups so that you're neither were stolen from nor lose lose

1280
01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:23.570
your game.

1281
01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:27.500
<v 4>Yeah.
So I mean there's a finite number of bitcoins.
So I a Bitcoin,</v>

1282
01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:28.670
it's electronic gold.

1283
01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:32.660
There is a generation of kids who will grow up that as long as they have been

1284
01:11:32.661 --> 01:11:36.020
alive like my son,
when he's older,
as long as he's been alive,

1285
01:11:36.021 --> 01:11:38.060
there will have been gold and they will have been bitcoins.

1286
01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:43.210
<v 5>You think the likelihood of Bitcoin in any way falling out of reach for people</v>

1287
01:11:44.601 --> 01:11:47.330
like your son is close to zero?

1288
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:51.630
<v 4>I don't,
I think bitcoin itself may suffer because it has governance issues.
Uh,</v>

1289
01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:53.980
and another currency like we should talk about a theory of,

1290
01:11:53.981 --> 01:11:57.240
and some of the others that are coming up might take its place,

1291
01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:01.770
but the idea that blockchain computers are going to go away is ridiculous.

1292
01:12:01.771 --> 01:12:03.630
That's like saying the Internet's going to go away.
Uh,

1293
01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:05.940
it's just too fundamental of a technology,

1294
01:12:06.370 --> 01:12:10.590
a barring a total mathematical breakthrough that obsoletes all encryption,

1295
01:12:10.591 --> 01:12:13.950
which would also be the end of the commercial internet as we know it.
Uh,

1296
01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:18.720
I think that's some kind of blockchain computer will dominate currency,

1297
01:12:18.721 --> 01:12:21.980
store of value,
contract law,
uh,

1298
01:12:21.981 --> 01:12:26.520
and any kind of financial instrument prediction markets,
all kinds of things,
uh,

1299
01:12:26.610 --> 01:12:29.330
in the future.
So to Mike,
to my kids,

1300
01:12:30.450 --> 01:12:32.100
they will choose electronic gold.

1301
01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:35.640
They will choose a bit cold and its successors over real gold.

1302
01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:37.630
<v 5>Nick,
what is,</v>

1303
01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:40.700
this is another one of these words that comes up at dinner parties and various

1304
01:12:40.701 --> 01:12:42.350
conversations and I kind of nod along,

1305
01:12:42.351 --> 01:12:47.351
some embarrassed to ask questions fearing I'm the only one at the party,

1306
01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:51.370
kind of like everybody goes to summer camp and they all missed their mom but no

1307
01:12:51.371 --> 01:12:56.100
one wants to talk about it and admit,
uh,
ethereum,
what is a theorem?

1308
01:12:56.610 --> 01:12:59.800
So,
so we talked about the blockchain computer.
So bitcoin,

1309
01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:04.510
I don't know if your audience can Harken back to the beginning of Apple Apple

1310
01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:07.990
Computer where Steve Wasniak was working at Hewlett Packard on a scientific

1311
01:13:07.991 --> 01:13:11.710
calculator and it had a certain limited scripting language that you know,

1312
01:13:11.711 --> 01:13:13.120
specialized for a,

1313
01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:17.710
that it wasn't a full fledged general purpose language that you can do lots
with.

1314
01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:21.580
But what he did was he got excited that his circuitry,
you know,

1315
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.940
chips were getting cheap enough that you could do the full fledged what they

1316
01:13:24.941 --> 01:13:28.150
call turning machine after Alan Turing.
Cause he's one of the inventors of it.

1317
01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:31.260
I'm a full fledge general purpose,
um,

1318
01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:35.110
machine that can do any mathematically feasible computation.

1319
01:13:35.650 --> 01:13:38.380
And so bitcoin is like a restricted computer.

1320
01:13:38.381 --> 01:13:42.100
It does certain things specialized like the multisig I talked about and certain

1321
01:13:42.101 --> 01:13:46.270
other other things that can do,
but if they're IOM is,

1322
01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:51.360
is a much more general purpose computer and it also stores longterm state

1323
01:13:51.831 --> 01:13:55.460
better,
which is a,
it's a technical thing,
but it's an an important difference.

1324
01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:58.870
So basically,
um,
a theory has great potential for this reason.

1325
01:13:58.871 --> 01:14:03.490
It has potential to do smart contracts.
I'm much better than bitcoin does.

1326
01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:08.050
The drawback going to this is it also increases the attack surface.

1327
01:14:08.051 --> 01:14:12.040
It if witness ethereum is doing is riskier,
the attack attack surface.

1328
01:14:12.041 --> 01:14:17.041
So you can think of of your house is having a tax surfacers windows and doors

1329
01:14:17.111 --> 01:14:18.820
and places where people can get in,
right?

1330
01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:24.240
Well the ethereum thing has more surfaces that people could potentially get in

1331
01:14:24.551 --> 01:14:25.480
because people are doing

1332
01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.100
<v 4>more things.
Got It.</v>

1333
01:14:27.101 --> 01:14:30.760
Just more vulnerabilities that correlate to more functionality.
Right.

1334
01:14:30.761 --> 01:14:34.990
So I'm much more flexible computer so you can talk to it in many,
many more ways.

1335
01:14:34.991 --> 01:14:38.240
So you can inject bad code in,
you can hack it and many,
many models.

1336
01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:41.320
And another thing that it makes it risky is that a,

1337
01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:43.940
<v 5>it's newer,
it's,
it's,
um,</v>

1338
01:14:44.450 --> 01:14:49.160
not much more advanced than where in terms of its maturity and getting out all

1339
01:14:49.161 --> 01:14:54.161
the bugs and stuff as a bitcoin was when people were paying 10,000 bitcoin for a

1340
01:14:54.261 --> 01:14:56.970
pizza.
And yet what's the three market

1341
01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.770
<v 4>cap now?
I think it just cross like eight or 9 billion today.</v>

1342
01:15:00.490 --> 01:15:02.890
Marty caps are fuzzy because if you calculate a properly,

1343
01:15:02.891 --> 01:15:04.570
based on the future issues of the coin,

1344
01:15:04.571 --> 01:15:06.520
it might actually be approaching bitcoin's market cap.

1345
01:15:06.521 --> 01:15:09.670
It might be in the 20 billion range once you take inflation into account.

1346
01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:11.860
<v 5>Anyway,
even with just the 10 million south,</v>

1347
01:15:11.861 --> 01:15:13.690
there are eight billions out there now.
That's,

1348
01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:17.950
that's a lot more money than bitcoin had at the same stage of maturity.

1349
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:21.790
So I definitely say it's at a riskier state.
It's also a much greater potential.

1350
01:15:21.970 --> 01:15:23.830
<v 4>Yeah,
I mean,
this is so not what we can,</v>

1351
01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:26.340
I think we've done a lot of backgrounding uh,

1352
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:30.230
and I think what people really want to hear from nick about his,

1353
01:15:30.231 --> 01:15:31.850
a little bit more of the advanced stuff,
right?

1354
01:15:31.851 --> 01:15:33.830
Because you didn't bid Colita smart contracts.

1355
01:15:34.190 --> 01:15:36.740
So they kind of want to know where you think the future is headed.

1356
01:15:36.741 --> 01:15:39.530
And I know the feature is impossible to predict and against not investment

1357
01:15:39.531 --> 01:15:43.430
advice,
but ray generically,
what platforms are you most excited about?

1358
01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:47.060
Where would you spend your time if you were like a young fresh person walking

1359
01:15:47.061 --> 01:15:47.894
into this space?

1360
01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:52.190
<v 5>So I am excited about um,
a theory m and a theorem classic and there's a,</v>

1361
01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:57.070
what's called a side chain for bitcoin called rootstock that they hope to a

1362
01:15:57.110 --> 01:16:00.800
combined together,
um,
the best of a theory them with,

1363
01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:02.300
with bitcoin on the chain.

1364
01:16:02.301 --> 01:16:05.850
So you can trade the bitcoin currency but do the touring complete full fledge,

1365
01:16:05.851 --> 01:16:06.684
smart contracts.

1366
01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:11.350
The potential there is that and there very well could be other attorney.

1367
01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:14.560
I mean there's a few other touring complete ones out there and probably quite a

1368
01:16:14.561 --> 01:16:17.650
bit more in the works,
um,
as well.
Anyway,

1369
01:16:17.651 --> 01:16:22.651
the potential for this stuff is that doing cross border things and other things

1370
01:16:23.330 --> 01:16:28.030
were you're crossing a trust boundary and you don't necessarily have access to,

1371
01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:30.110
I'm good legal,
legal counsel,

1372
01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:34.060
affordable legal counsel for financial contracts.

1373
01:16:34.061 --> 01:16:37.630
Especially as the low hanging fruit because those are usually very well defined

1374
01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:42.670
and a bureaucrats like to make complications in that all sorts of epicycles to

1375
01:16:42.671 --> 01:16:45.990
them.
But really an option in the future and stuff.
They're,

1376
01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:50.110
they're logically and temporarily pretty simple things to do.

1377
01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:54.220
And once you get more than the underlying assets,

1378
01:16:54.221 --> 01:16:57.640
you can do options and futures.
You know,
as for example,

1379
01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:02.380
exchanging bitcoin for a threesome and we were getting all these other tokens

1380
01:17:02.381 --> 01:17:04.750
that are going to be on these blockchains,
you'll be able to include in that.

1381
01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:09.070
Now if you go off block chain,
you've got to kind of take a different tack.

1382
01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:11.660
The words,
if you're connecting your smart contract to the real world,

1383
01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:12.450
you need to,

1384
01:17:12.450 --> 01:17:15.230
you need to know what happened in the real world and decide whether or not

1385
01:17:15.231 --> 01:17:19.020
texted cute.
You're smart,
right?
So if you're doing an apple stock for example,
um,

1386
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:19.491
cause that's,

1387
01:17:19.491 --> 01:17:24.170
that's a traditionally defined thing that depends on traditional systems to make

1388
01:17:24.171 --> 01:17:28.460
it work.
Incentivize apple to pay the dividends and,
and do what they do.

1389
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.410
In any case,
if you want to do that,

1390
01:17:30.411 --> 01:17:34.280
then all of a sudden you're back in the traditional financial world and the

1391
01:17:34.281 --> 01:17:36.950
traditional financial people know that right now there's like a,
a,

1392
01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:42.700
a cultural disconnect that bitcoin people have a really cool technology and,

1393
01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:45.770
but they hate the people in the financial community and don't want to talk to

1394
01:17:45.771 --> 01:17:46.820
him,
don't want to learn from them.

1395
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:49.760
And the same to some extent with these Syrian people as well.

1396
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:52.460
And on the other hand,
the financial community,

1397
01:17:52.461 --> 01:17:56.330
people hate and don't understand blockchain and currency.
In fact,

1398
01:17:56.331 --> 01:18:00.980
there was this whole bunch of very dubious startups that raised a bunch of money

1399
01:18:00.981 --> 01:18:03.740
to do things they call blockchains that were,
they didn't have blocks,

1400
01:18:03.741 --> 01:18:04.760
they didn't have changed.
They weren't,

1401
01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.860
didn't have the security that I was talking about,

1402
01:18:07.130 --> 01:18:09.320
but the marketing people wanted to call them blockchains.

1403
01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:12.640
They could pretend to be like bitcoin and you know,
the price is going way up.

1404
01:18:12.650 --> 01:18:15.620
$15 million in financing later.
Yeah.
At the end,
these,

1405
01:18:15.630 --> 01:18:18.230
like most of the private blockchain company,
I'm not going to name names,

1406
01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:20.060
but yeah.
Yeah.
So the,

1407
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:23.090
the financial people don't understand that and they've gotten burned by some of

1408
01:18:23.091 --> 01:18:26.180
these companies.
So they hate,
they hate it.

1409
01:18:26.181 --> 01:18:30.350
But what really I think for the entrepreneurial opportunity and some of your

1410
01:18:30.351 --> 01:18:34.340
listeners want,
are looking for non for an opportunity is to marry these two.

1411
01:18:34.341 --> 01:18:39.320
So pick the best of traditional finance,
take the best of the blockchains.

1412
01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:41.240
Um,
ethereum,
if you're doing sophisticated,

1413
01:18:41.241 --> 01:18:44.540
smart contracts and willing to take some risks and bitcoin if you're main thing

1414
01:18:44.541 --> 01:18:46.700
is,
is um,
cross border payments,

1415
01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:49.850
take these in and marry them together.

1416
01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:54.920
Figuring out ways to securely reflect assets on the blockchain using both

1417
01:18:54.921 --> 01:18:59.780
traditional financial controls and bureaucracy and taking advantage of

1418
01:18:59.781 --> 01:19:01.010
technology.
I think that's the,

1419
01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:05.000
that's the opportunity people haven't done yet because of this cultural

1420
01:19:05.001 --> 01:19:05.750
disconnect.

1421
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:10.430
What would you say are some of the most important or valuable components of the

1422
01:19:10.431 --> 01:19:12.860
traditional finance world?
Like where would you start?

1423
01:19:13.190 --> 01:19:15.410
The traditional paperworld was really good.

1424
01:19:15.411 --> 01:19:18.830
It had a thing called separation of duties where,
um,

1425
01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:21.890
as we've talked about multiple people signing off on things and looking things

1426
01:19:21.891 --> 01:19:25.300
and you have to go through multiple stages.
Like,
if you get an order,

1427
01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:29.060
the salesperson has to give the order to the accounting department and they have

1428
01:19:29.061 --> 01:19:33.170
to give the order to the manufacturing people and everybody records it.

1429
01:19:33.171 --> 01:19:35.780
So it's like a little mini,
mini paper blockchain that,

1430
01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:39.200
that people used to have with computers that's Kinda gotten messed up.

1431
01:19:39.201 --> 01:19:41.480
And hackers can,
who know what they're doing,

1432
01:19:41.481 --> 01:19:45.860
can take advantage that these systems don't work as well now.
But,

1433
01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:51.110
um,
if you,
to a great extent,
you can make them work and people do make them work,

1434
01:19:51.111 --> 01:19:55.400
you know,
with a stock clearing and settlement and issuance and so forth.

1435
01:19:55.670 --> 01:19:56.570
So anyway,
yeah,
there,

1436
01:19:56.571 --> 01:19:59.240
there are experts in the financial community not to do that.
And if you can,

1437
01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:03.620
if you can make them love instead of hate blockchains,
then you'll have a great,

1438
01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.170
great skillset combination.

1439
01:20:06.171 --> 01:20:08.130
If you can get the blockchain and those guys together.

1440
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.811
<v 4>Yeah.
You're,</v>

1441
01:20:08.811 --> 01:20:12.390
you're an interesting one because you combine law and computer science to do

1442
01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:13.890
unusual things.

1443
01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:17.130
And you're basically saying is you can combine traditional finance and now

1444
01:20:17.131 --> 01:20:17.791
computer science,

1445
01:20:17.791 --> 01:20:20.880
you do unusual things and write somewhere in that intersection is set.

1446
01:20:20.881 --> 01:20:22.010
You can take a,
uh,

1447
01:20:22.450 --> 01:20:26.680
a process that's entirely paper and move the part of it that belongs in the

1448
01:20:26.681 --> 01:20:29.390
blockchain on the blockchain.
Well,
plugging in the paper part

1449
01:20:29.530 --> 01:20:30.041
<v 5>or,
or,</v>

1450
01:20:30.041 --> 01:20:34.780
or it used to be paper and somebody just naive Lee ported it in some naive and

1451
01:20:34.781 --> 01:20:38.650
secure fashion to computers and now you can use blockchains to make it much more

1452
01:20:38.651 --> 01:20:39.910
secure and trust minimized.
Yeah.

1453
01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:44.500
<v 6>On the side of educating oneself,
so let's say there are people,</v>

1454
01:20:44.501 --> 01:20:46.380
and I'm sure there are listening,
are part of the,

1455
01:20:47.170 --> 01:20:50.620
the traditional finance world who say,
that sounds like a great idea.

1456
01:20:50.710 --> 01:20:53.230
I want to learn how to love bitcoin and cryptocurrency.

1457
01:20:53.610 --> 01:20:54.820
I want to learn about this.

1458
01:20:55.880 --> 01:21:00.380
How would you suggest they choose reliable sources of information?

1459
01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:04.530
Because as we've noted before,
it's a bit of the wild,

1460
01:21:04.531 --> 01:21:07.110
wild west in some respects.
I mean,
you don't have,

1461
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:10.620
not everyone is making disclosures about what they're,

1462
01:21:10.650 --> 01:21:13.790
their own portfolio might look like.
So there are,

1463
01:21:13.791 --> 01:21:17.880
there are a lot of to Barbara's telling you,
should you,
you should get a haircut.

1464
01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:21.090
And how would you suggest people think about that?

1465
01:21:21.730 --> 01:21:22.301
<v 5>I mean if,</v>

1466
01:21:22.301 --> 01:21:25.720
if you're technical and want to dive into the engineering and the technology of

1467
01:21:25.721 --> 01:21:28.860
it,
um,
the bitcoin white paper is,

1468
01:21:28.890 --> 01:21:30.940
is still by far the best place to start.

1469
01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:34.840
And Vitalik Buterin is a theory whitepaper also.
What was that name again?

1470
01:21:35.710 --> 01:21:40.150
<v 4>Vitalik Buterin.
He's the guy who created it.
He's a lead developer on ethereum.</v>

1471
01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:45.290
Uh,
he's actually an interesting guy,
young prodigy,
probably like 20 or 21 now.

1472
01:21:45.291 --> 01:21:48.140
Started it when he was 18.
Um,
absolutely brilliant.

1473
01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:51.350
<v 5>There's a guy named Aviv Zohara was written some great papers.</v>

1474
01:21:51.351 --> 01:21:55.480
One of them is on ghost,
which is what a third of them is based on.
Um,

1475
01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:58.070
and he's got a follow up to that whose name escapes me.

1476
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.990
And he's also written a cough and a great paper on a tax against bitcoin from

1477
01:22:02.991 --> 01:22:07.370
the underlying network.
So he's one of the experts on the security of Bitcoin,

1478
01:22:07.371 --> 01:22:09.470
which is a skill and knowledge

1479
01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:12.070
<v 4>and scare supplies.
Yeah.
One of the,</v>

1480
01:22:12.130 --> 01:22:16.140
one of the problems and opportunities here is that,
uh,
you know,

1481
01:22:16.150 --> 01:22:17.230
going back to that earlier thing,

1482
01:22:17.231 --> 01:22:19.950
it's about money being the bubble that never pops.
Uh,

1483
01:22:20.230 --> 01:22:24.210
bitcoin is kind of a Ponzi seen scheme that starts with smart people.

1484
01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:27.210
So the smartest people understand it first,

1485
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:30.930
then they sell it to like the people who need the cryptography explained to them

1486
01:22:30.931 --> 01:22:31.740
like me,

1487
01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:35.190
and then we sell it to the people who need the next level down and the whole

1488
01:22:35.191 --> 01:22:38.340
thing could pop in and badly.
So I'm not saying go put all your money in bitcoin.

1489
01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:41.270
Uh,
but I think to understand blockchain computer use,

1490
01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:45.750
you sort of have to get into the math and the code and the heart stuff.

1491
01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:47.910
But if you wait to figure it out,

1492
01:22:47.911 --> 01:22:50.490
by the time everyone can figure it out with the same tools,

1493
01:22:50.491 --> 01:22:54.510
it'll kind of be too late from an investment or earning perspective

1494
01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:59.240
<v 6>from an investment perspective,
but not from a,
from the utilization standpoint.</v>

1495
01:22:59.241 --> 01:23:01.640
No,
of course you'll be able to use money just as we use dollars,

1496
01:23:01.641 --> 01:23:05.890
but you're not going to be investing in something that is going to hockey stick.

1497
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:07.780
<v 4>Yeah.
The challenge for the industry is like today,</v>

1498
01:23:07.781 --> 01:23:11.510
bitcoin has all these advantages that were gold.
You know,
it's,
it's more,
uh,

1499
01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:15.460
easily transmissible.
It's more sub divisible.
It's more easily stored.

1500
01:23:15.461 --> 01:23:19.630
It can be community by computers.
But to the average person,
that means nothing.

1501
01:23:19.690 --> 01:23:20.560
All they need to,

1502
01:23:20.561 --> 01:23:23.590
what they need to experience that they need to receive some bitcoin in a

1503
01:23:23.591 --> 01:23:26.560
transaction and then send some bitcoin transaction,

1504
01:23:26.561 --> 01:23:29.860
had the experience be so much better than every other experience they've had

1505
01:23:29.861 --> 01:23:33.940
with money or with gold.
And the tools just aren't there yet.
Like right now,

1506
01:23:33.941 --> 01:23:36.460
securing your bitcoin for yourself is still difficult.

1507
01:23:36.461 --> 01:23:38.860
The hardware wallets are getting better,
but it's still kind of a nightmare.

1508
01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:44.050
So I think the industry still has a decade of work to do to make

1509
01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:47.410
cryptocurrencies live up to their potential.
Uh,

1510
01:23:47.411 --> 01:23:50.470
and the idea space is so large and then all these companies working on it,

1511
01:23:50.770 --> 01:23:55.000
but every year it gets a little easier to use.
It has a few more use cases.

1512
01:23:55.001 --> 01:23:57.660
It gets a little easier to store.
Um,
and,

1513
01:23:57.670 --> 01:24:00.730
and the smart contracts that are built on it become a little more interesting.

1514
01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:05.500
Um,
so that is a process and eventually you'll be able to use bitcoin without

1515
01:24:05.501 --> 01:24:06.390
knowing anything about it.

1516
01:24:06.391 --> 01:24:09.820
Just like you can use US dollars without knowing how the federal open reserve,

1517
01:24:09.821 --> 01:24:13.420
open market committee works and you know,
does lending and issues,

1518
01:24:13.421 --> 01:24:14.920
treasury bills and all that stuff.

1519
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:18.520
There's only a few geeks we need to know that in the world of finance,
uh,

1520
01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:20.500
and you can just use money like it's money.

1521
01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:23.930
<v 3>Just to clarify one thing he said,
he said money is the bubble that never pops.</v>

1522
01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:26.270
You're talking about the concept of money.
Yeah.

1523
01:24:26.271 --> 01:24:29.560
The concept of mine because individual currencies certainly.
Sure.

1524
01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:32.610
If tomorrow lived in Argentina between two thousand two thousand.

1525
01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:32.891
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1526
01:24:32.891 --> 01:24:35.980
If tomorrow we all believe that the u s dollars is a green piece of paper and I

1527
01:24:35.981 --> 01:24:37.660
can't eat it,
I can't do anything with it.

1528
01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:41.140
Or if like aliens came and took over the world and you know,

1529
01:24:41.170 --> 01:24:42.910
we offered them a little green pieces of paper,

1530
01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:46.360
but just using it to start a bonfire or something.
Right?
So it's the money,

1531
01:24:46.361 --> 01:24:50.050
it's just a concept and we have to agree on what that scarce element is.

1532
01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:54.970
And today that scarcity is enforced by governments with guns and central banks

1533
01:24:54.971 --> 01:24:58.840
and it just breaks down and national borders and the people who secure that

1534
01:24:58.841 --> 01:25:02.470
money for you take a huge tax,
roughly a third of the economy in exchange for it.

1535
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:07.180
Uh,
and eventually it will be a distributed network of computers,
um,

1536
01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:10.880
acting in self interest,
who are going to secure that,

1537
01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:14.480
the scarcity of that money and hopefully their tax is going to be a lot lower.

1538
01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:18.930
<v 3>What else would a,
you're obviously much more on the pulse of this,</v>

1539
01:25:18.931 --> 01:25:22.710
but what other topics?
It could be beyond my pay grade.
It probably is,

1540
01:25:22.711 --> 01:25:23.670
but should we

1541
01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:28.670
<v 4>explore with,
with nick?
Yeah,
I think,
I think,
uh,
you know,</v>

1542
01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:31.880
just talking about blockchains in general.
So we started with Bitcoin,

1543
01:25:31.881 --> 01:25:34.760
the blockchain,
which is around transferring money.

1544
01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:39.110
There's a etherium blockchain,
uh,
and others like it,
uh,

1545
01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:43.760
which are about computation and running like a very slow but very,
uh,

1546
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:46.890
trust,
minimize reliable contracts.
Um,

1547
01:25:47.010 --> 01:25:50.670
what other uses can you see for blockchains coming up that you think maybe a

1548
01:25:50.671 --> 01:25:52.800
little farfetched,
maybe 10 years out,
but what's,
you know,

1549
01:25:53.010 --> 01:25:54.510
what's the possibility space?

1550
01:25:54.670 --> 01:25:55.001
<v 3>Well,
I mean,</v>

1551
01:25:55.001 --> 01:25:59.170
one of the possibilities is that I'm really excited about the cross border thing

1552
01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:04.040
to have,
say grandmother is in India and uh,
teenagers

1553
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:09.070
<v 5>in somebody's basement in Indiana doing what people north formerly thought were</v>

1554
01:26:09.651 --> 01:26:13.670
sophisticated financial contracts such as options,
futures and Cetera,
you know,

1555
01:26:13.671 --> 01:26:18.530
through this online vending machine in the cloud.
That's the blockchain.
So that,

1556
01:26:18.531 --> 01:26:23.070
that's an exciting and probably to many people disturbing possibility,
um,

1557
01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:25.960
that I think is going to be coming up in the next 10 to 20 years.

1558
01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:26.571
<v 4>Yeah.
I mean,</v>

1559
01:26:26.571 --> 01:26:30.080
so you could have like people loading each other money or creating credit

1560
01:26:30.081 --> 01:26:33.470
instruments or engaging in prediction markets and things like that.
Yeah.

1561
01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:37.400
<v 5>What do you mean by prediction markets?
Well,
I'll,
I'll talk about one that I,</v>

1562
01:26:37.401 --> 01:26:41.150
that the insurance people are working on,
which is related,
which is,
um,

1563
01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:44.940
parametric contracts.
So normally an insurance will pay out,
you know,

1564
01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:47.870
if you get damages from a flood and they have to come estimate your damages,

1565
01:26:47.871 --> 01:26:48.860
which is basically a,

1566
01:26:49.190 --> 01:26:53.990
a wet human exercise and eyeballing how moldier wall is and how much you got

1567
01:26:53.991 --> 01:26:56.160
flooded and stuff.
But a,
an a,

1568
01:26:56.170 --> 01:26:59.540
a dryer way to do this is called parametric contracts,

1569
01:26:59.541 --> 01:27:03.050
where like if you're a hotel and in an area got hit by hurricane,

1570
01:27:03.290 --> 01:27:07.400
you can measure how much business he lost on your accounting books and,
um,

1571
01:27:07.670 --> 01:27:12.670
you can parameterize that and basically have your smart contract pay off if your

1572
01:27:13.121 --> 01:27:17.260
books go below a certain time or pay you more is the fog your books go down.

1573
01:27:17.590 --> 01:27:21.150
So that ensures kind of what you really want to ensure they hotel really wanted

1574
01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:24.430
ensure which is their business.
And uh,
it's also dryer.

1575
01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:27.760
It can be done by software verifying,
you know,
what the books are.

1576
01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:29.800
So you can make a smart contract out of that.

1577
01:27:30.250 --> 01:27:35.050
And there are other parameterized contracts as well based on other things that

1578
01:27:35.170 --> 01:27:36.640
computers consents and measure.

1579
01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:38.690
<v 4>Yeah.
In prediction markets are,
you know,</v>

1580
01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:41.910
people can actually make predictions and get paid if their predictions are

1581
01:27:41.911 --> 01:27:44.070
correct or lose money if their predictions are wrong.

1582
01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:49.550
And then these prediction markets can also serve as a arbitrators of truth and

1583
01:27:50.631 --> 01:27:55.070
pricing,
um,
into the smart contracts.
Um,
so for example,

1584
01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:59.440
uh,
you know,
[inaudible] Nick's case,
Nick's example,

1585
01:27:59.690 --> 01:28:03.280
the Ho you tie in directly to the hotels,
books,
the hotels,
the lost revenue.

1586
01:28:03.281 --> 01:28:06.640
And so you know,
whether or not to pay the hotel,
but if there's a flood,

1587
01:28:06.670 --> 01:28:11.520
I want to say,
was the hotel in the effected area,
was the hotel itself effected?

1588
01:28:11.521 --> 01:28:13.110
You need now what's called an oracle.

1589
01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:15.720
You need someone who's basically going to go in there and say like,
yes,

1590
01:28:15.721 --> 01:28:17.190
this happened.
No,
they didn't.

1591
01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:20.430
And prediction markets through very sophisticated engineering,

1592
01:28:20.431 --> 01:28:22.740
which I think is beyond the scope of this conversation.

1593
01:28:23.130 --> 01:28:27.870
Basically try and pay that person for telling the truth in a reliable way.
Uh,

1594
01:28:27.871 --> 01:28:29.330
and so you can use that to,

1595
01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:34.420
to cross the divide between the wet space and dry space or from the real world

1596
01:28:34.471 --> 01:28:37.380
into computers to have them do these things.
You can see,

1597
01:28:37.381 --> 01:28:40.500
you can see the insurance markets being completely overhauled by blockchain

1598
01:28:40.501 --> 01:28:43.980
computers and insurance.
A huge industry.
It's gigantic.

1599
01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:45.950
A lot of it just belongs in the blockchain.

1600
01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:49.600
I don't think you're going to have like a,
you know,
bankers in Bermuda,
uh,

1601
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:53.250
doing this 20 years from now.
You do not think,
I don't think.
Yeah.

1602
01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:58.680
<v 5>Because of the technical barriers to understanding,
uh,
or challenges,</v>

1603
01:28:58.681 --> 01:29:02.070
let's say lead.
I think the,
to

1604
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:06.270
<v 6>be susceptible to say charlatans for very smart who can fool people who don't</v>

1605
01:29:06.271 --> 01:29:10.380
understand technical aspects is a lot of scams in the space.
How do you,

1606
01:29:10.410 --> 01:29:15.410
what are the characteristics of charlatans or scams in the space?

1607
01:29:16.190 --> 01:29:16.460
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

1608
01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:20.520
it used to be easier to spot the louder they talked the scammy or they were,

1609
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:25.050
now I think it's the scammers have gotten really sophisticated.

1610
01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.510
Some of these scammers are like version five of their scam.

1611
01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:31.380
So there'll be selling some coin and there'll be talking about how it enables

1612
01:29:31.381 --> 01:29:33.660
some functionality when reality,
the code doesn't,

1613
01:29:33.690 --> 01:29:36.810
or they have some back door where they're selling you a scarce coin,

1614
01:29:36.811 --> 01:29:40.410
but they can print a lot of them.
So in that sense,
you know,
there's,

1615
01:29:40.890 --> 01:29:44.010
there's a couple of coins that are sort of in the top set that are regarded as

1616
01:29:44.011 --> 01:29:48.460
top flight,
then it'll legit.
But what are those?
A big coin,
a theory.

1617
01:29:48.461 --> 01:29:49.810
I'm a kind of the best known ones.

1618
01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:54.520
Then there's sort of a second tier contender list of uh,
uh,
you know,
z cash,

1619
01:29:54.521 --> 01:29:58.180
Minero,
uh,
light coin,
etc. You know,

1620
01:29:58.181 --> 01:30:02.240
there's some new ones coming up like tasers,
these seem more legit,
but you,

1621
01:30:02.241 --> 01:30:04.090
you have to know your stuff and do your homework.

1622
01:30:04.090 --> 01:30:07.390
It's not something where I would recommend you just run out and buy.
Um,

1623
01:30:07.630 --> 01:30:11.050
and then there's a long tail of coins where there's a diamond in the rough here

1624
01:30:11.051 --> 01:30:13.210
or there.
Uh,
but there's a lot of junk too.

1625
01:30:13.610 --> 01:30:16.590
What's attracting people is just how much money you can make in this space.

1626
01:30:16.591 --> 01:30:20.400
You know,
bitcoin has basically doubled in value every year since its founding.

1627
01:30:20.430 --> 01:30:22.710
It's a,
it's,
and you know,
you do that for eight,

1628
01:30:22.711 --> 01:30:26.620
10 years and you end up with a very,
very steep curve.
Um,
something like etherium,

1629
01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:29.970
if you bought it when it was sold in the original presale today,

1630
01:30:30.150 --> 01:30:31.470
and just a few years later,

1631
01:30:31.471 --> 01:30:34.410
you'd be sitting on hundreds and hundreds of times your money and you'd be fully

1632
01:30:34.411 --> 01:30:37.870
liquid.
Um,
but this is not unrecognized.

1633
01:30:37.871 --> 01:30:40.240
The space has increased in value so much.

1634
01:30:40.570 --> 01:30:44.380
The market cap of all the cryptocurrencies is more than double just in the last

1635
01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:47.500
quarter.
So there's a lot of hot money flowing in.
Um,

1636
01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:50.410
well the flow back out possibly.
Are we in a bubble?
The environment,

1637
01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:52.900
probably a will this bubble pop,

1638
01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:56.410
nobody knows what pop across the board or will it pops selectively?
Yep.

1639
01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:58.520
<v 6>Or will it pop later than a different pop?</v>

1640
01:30:58.521 --> 01:31:01.400
So it won't matter because they'll be a flight of money from one asset class
too.

1641
01:31:01.630 --> 01:31:04.810
<v 4>Exactly.
Or will the value switched from bitcoin to ethereum?</v>

1642
01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:09.070
Will bitcoin fork into two competing coins because people are arguing over

1643
01:31:09.071 --> 01:31:11.110
whether the block size should be increased or not.

1644
01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:15.850
<v 6>There's so much craziness just to,
just to pause on that word,
because this,</v>

1645
01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:19.480
when I was attempting to educate myself and doing a pretty mediocre job of it,

1646
01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:23.450
this word fork came up over and over again.
And so in my mind,

1647
01:31:23.451 --> 01:31:25.370
I'm envisioning someone reading a lot about the,
uh,

1648
01:31:27.330 --> 01:31:30.590
so the making of the modern world and Genghis Khan and all this stuff.

1649
01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:35.830
[inaudible] and anyway,
thanks Dan.
Carlin for the hardcore history,
uh,

1650
01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:36.950
you would always,

1651
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:40.430
you would have these internal factions that would then split off as two or more

1652
01:31:40.431 --> 01:31:44.210
separate groups in this context of what is for coming and how should,

1653
01:31:44.330 --> 01:31:48.010
how should I think about it in a coherent way?

1654
01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:51.640
<v 4>This,
this is open source code.
So I can take your bitcoin,</v>

1655
01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:55.540
I can create a copy tomorrow and it can change this at all the benefits go to

1656
01:31:55.541 --> 01:31:59.920
Nepal and,
right.
And that's a fork of Bitcoin that I'll call Navarro coin.
Now,

1657
01:31:59.921 --> 01:32:02.680
in reality,
people hopefully do more interesting forks.

1658
01:32:02.710 --> 01:32:04.960
So there's a fork of bitcoin called light coin,

1659
01:32:05.230 --> 01:32:08.560
which used the different mining algorithm in a different way to authenticate the

1660
01:32:08.561 --> 01:32:11.950
minors.
There's another four for call z cash,
uh,

1661
01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:16.000
which uses different privacy routines to basically allow for private

1662
01:32:16.001 --> 01:32:19.240
transactions.
So other people can't look in the ledger and know who,

1663
01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:23.500
who spoke to who.
Got It.
So not every node has full ledger.
Correct?
Well,

1664
01:32:23.501 --> 01:32:27.340
and every note of the full ledger,
but it's cryptographically,
uh,
hidden.

1665
01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:29.890
So you can't tell who sent who,
how much money?

1666
01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:34.060
<v 5>No,
no.
In the forks.
So you just talked about,
um,
a z cash and light coin.</v>

1667
01:32:34.061 --> 01:32:35.680
They started over from scratch.
They,

1668
01:32:35.770 --> 01:32:38.470
they started their own transaction history from scratch.

1669
01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:42.370
There's another more troublesome kind of fork where you don't start from
scratch,

1670
01:32:42.371 --> 01:32:46.330
you're just upgrading the current software with the same transact,

1671
01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:50.800
with the ongoing transaction history and you're trying to convince people to

1672
01:32:50.801 --> 01:32:52.450
follow.
And it's become a very political,

1673
01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:57.460
political process to be fighting over the people to,
uh,
to,
uh,
and,

1674
01:32:57.490 --> 01:33:00.340
and since,
you know,
bitcoin has,
you know,
the,
the,
uh,

1675
01:33:00.370 --> 01:33:03.760
20 plus billion billion dollar value,
um,
you know,

1676
01:33:03.761 --> 01:33:07.790
people would much rather put their favorite idea into bitcoin,

1677
01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:10.780
then go off and start their own cryptocurrency from scratch.

1678
01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:14.050
It's like bitcoin only better.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And so there's,

1679
01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:17.590
there's tremendous political fights over,
over upgrades,
um,

1680
01:33:17.591 --> 01:33:20.170
in this space and just those were,
the bad blood comes in.

1681
01:33:20.230 --> 01:33:22.970
<v 4>There's a huge debate right now in the bitcoin world,
uh,</v>

1682
01:33:23.050 --> 01:33:27.240
where they're fighting over.
Um,
and,
and the basic,
the question is,

1683
01:33:27.241 --> 01:33:32.040
do you increase the size of the ledger?
Um,
it's,
it's the block size debate.

1684
01:33:32.041 --> 01:33:36.390
Do you increase the size of the blocks to hold more transactions so then you can

1685
01:33:36.391 --> 01:33:39.600
bring down the cost of each transaction so that I can go and buy coffee in

1686
01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:44.620
Bitcoin or do you leave bitcoin alone and treat it more as like a Swiss bank

1687
01:33:45.051 --> 01:33:46.490
where you only move around money,

1688
01:33:46.491 --> 01:33:51.140
rarely in large quantities and the smaller transactions are done on another

1689
01:33:51.141 --> 01:33:54.830
layer on top where you create another software layer on top,

1690
01:33:54.831 --> 01:33:57.920
they call it like lightening network as an example of that layer that which can

1691
01:33:57.980 --> 01:33:59.210
be used for very small,

1692
01:33:59.211 --> 01:34:02.480
very fast transactions and micropayments or not even micro,

1693
01:34:02.481 --> 01:34:04.100
but even like paying $5 for,
you know,

1694
01:34:04.110 --> 01:34:07.760
at Starbucks because bitcoin literally every time you do a transaction,

1695
01:34:07.761 --> 01:34:10.760
there are thousands and tens of thousands of computers all over the world that

1696
01:34:10.761 --> 01:34:13.190
are recording that,
replicating that and store it in there for all the time.

1697
01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:14.510
Right.
That's a lot of work.

1698
01:34:15.310 --> 01:34:18.920
Whereas you could probably run all of visas co computational power on a single

1699
01:34:18.921 --> 01:34:23.600
iPad today.
Um,
but as much as central as systems are much more efficient,

1700
01:34:23.630 --> 01:34:27.680
but they're much less secure,
that's kind of the trade off.
Yeah.
And so,
um,

1701
01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:29.510
<v 5>this,
um,
yeah,</v>

1702
01:34:29.511 --> 01:34:33.500
I mean the first choice isn't for the blockchain itself really a viable choice

1703
01:34:33.530 --> 01:34:36.170
in terms of scaling is it scales from,
you know,

1704
01:34:36.171 --> 01:34:41.171
10 times the value of transactions value per second of transactions is today.

1705
01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:45.270
Um,
because the,
the,
um,
capacity's limited,

1706
01:34:45.271 --> 01:34:47.900
it does these full nodes that are running that requires certain bandwidth.

1707
01:34:47.901 --> 01:34:48.980
They have to talk to a lot of people,

1708
01:34:48.981 --> 01:34:51.080
make a lot of copies to replicate the stuff around.

1709
01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:55.850
And so there's a second layer and all was talking about that really the people

1710
01:34:55.851 --> 01:34:58.040
buying the coffee are going have to transition to,

1711
01:34:58.041 --> 01:35:00.340
and this has caused a lot of friction because,
um,

1712
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:05.000
people are going to have to transition for the small everyday purchases from

1713
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:10.030
bitcoin that blockchain itself to this second layer and there's competing

1714
01:35:11.121 --> 01:35:15.020
designs for the second layer and so forth.
And so there's,
there's plenty of,

1715
01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:17.270
of things to cause political friction.

1716
01:35:17.530 --> 01:35:20.440
<v 4>Yeah.
Going back to the money,
that definition,
that debate is,</v>

1717
01:35:20.441 --> 01:35:25.220
is bitcoin really a store of value or is it a medium of exchange?
Uh,
and,

1718
01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:28.210
and so,
nick,
I know you don't want to get into the middle of the politics of it,

1719
01:35:28.211 --> 01:35:32.140
but just from pure computer science perspective,
like if you were designing,

1720
01:35:32.170 --> 01:35:32.441
you know,

1721
01:35:32.441 --> 01:35:35.980
if you're redesigning a bit gold today and you wanted to incorporate some of

1722
01:35:35.981 --> 01:35:39.490
these learnings,
where would you fall in on,
what'd you go for a larger blocks?

1723
01:35:39.491 --> 01:35:40.720
Would you go for a second layer?

1724
01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:42.780
<v 5>Oh No,
I'd definitely go for a second layer.
I mean,</v>

1725
01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:45.120
I designed bitcoin gold with two layers because,

1726
01:35:45.390 --> 01:35:48.990
<v 6>and can you explain just,
I must have lost something.</v>

1727
01:35:48.991 --> 01:35:50.850
Just what that second layer is one more time.

1728
01:35:51.050 --> 01:35:55.190
<v 5>The first layer is the block chain itself.
The bitcoin we call the capital,</v>

1729
01:35:55.191 --> 01:36:00.191
be blockchain doing the secure transactions and the ones you can do from

1730
01:36:00.650 --> 01:36:01.280
Albania,

1731
01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:05.480
Zimbabwe without a trusted third party going through the blockchain and the

1732
01:36:05.481 --> 01:36:10.481
second layer and the ability to grow the transactions per second on that is very

1733
01:36:11.091 --> 01:36:16.010
limited.
Um,
you can grow the value per transaction quite substantially,

1734
01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:19.700
but the ability to grow a transaction for a second is limited because those have

1735
01:36:19.701 --> 01:36:22.940
a certain size and you have to make copies of them around

1736
01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:26.460
<v 6>and so forth.
I see.
So the second layer would be for the coffee.
The pizza.</v>

1737
01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:30.530
<v 5>Yeah.
And so as this grows,
there's more and more people start using this.</v>

1738
01:36:30.531 --> 01:36:34.730
They're competing for that,
that limited block space and the fees are going up.

1739
01:36:35.570 --> 01:36:39.770
And so if you want to have a cup of coffee without having to pay as much fees,

1740
01:36:39.771 --> 01:36:43.720
you paid for the coffee,
you know,
in two or three or four years from now,
um,

1741
01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:47.060
you're going to have to use one of these side chain,

1742
01:36:47.061 --> 01:36:48.830
what I call peripheral financial network,

1743
01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:53.570
that it's collateralized on the blockchain.
It's almost trust as trust,

1744
01:36:53.571 --> 01:36:58.010
minimized as the blockchain itself,
but it's for lower value transactions.
It only

1745
01:36:58.700 --> 01:37:03.260
<v 6>periodically settle on the blockchain.
We talked a little bit about the,</v>

1746
01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:07.570
I suppose,
third party tools,
so the application layer,
uh,

1747
01:37:07.571 --> 01:37:11.170
exchanges and so on,
the user experience being suboptimal currently.

1748
01:37:11.470 --> 01:37:15.810
But what if you could wave a magic wand and make certain things happen?

1749
01:37:15.811 --> 01:37:19.050
Make certain people invest in,
say,
Bitcoin,
what is,

1750
01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:24.140
what would be required to help bitcoin cross the chasm to be become much more

1751
01:37:24.181 --> 01:37:26.610
mainstream?
Maybe it's just inevitable and it's a matter of time.

1752
01:37:26.611 --> 01:37:29.910
That could be it.
But if you want it to accelerate the process,
and it was like,

1753
01:37:29.911 --> 01:37:30.490
okay,
we,

1754
01:37:30.490 --> 01:37:35.130
you can make wave a magic wand and you can choose any group of people to invest,

1755
01:37:35.131 --> 01:37:40.131
say $10 billion into bitcoin or whatever the number is and then fix x,

1756
01:37:40.141 --> 01:37:44.970
y,
and z that would help mass adoption.
And the crossing the chasm.

1757
01:37:44.971 --> 01:37:46.200
What are the things that come to mind?

1758
01:37:46.330 --> 01:37:46.871
<v 5>Well,
I mean,</v>

1759
01:37:46.871 --> 01:37:49.780
currencies have traditionally been associated with governments because

1760
01:37:49.781 --> 01:37:50.920
especially in the modern times,

1761
01:37:50.921 --> 01:37:52.840
they're the largest creditor and the largest debtor.

1762
01:37:52.841 --> 01:37:57.700
And so there they have the plurality of the,
and what is the,
you know,
the,
uh,

1763
01:37:58.210 --> 01:38:01.150
the money other people are going to use.
Um,

1764
01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:06.420
so right now bitcoin is being used for a snitch purposes where the Fiat system,

1765
01:38:07.390 --> 01:38:11.740
which,
um,
is a very weird,
like all permission system.
So blacklists people,

1766
01:38:11.741 --> 01:38:15.520
I've met people at bitcoin conferences,
um,
they've got plenty of money and stuff,

1767
01:38:15.521 --> 01:38:19.600
but they've been blacklisted.
They can't open bank accounts,
um,
and so forth.

1768
01:38:19.601 --> 01:38:23.720
So there's actually the heart,
the hardest thing.
So no,
not necessarily.

1769
01:38:23.721 --> 01:38:26.570
It could be just there,
you know,

1770
01:38:26.571 --> 01:38:31.190
they're suspected of something or um,
the money laundering laws are such that,

1771
01:38:31.191 --> 01:38:34.610
you know,
if somebody does something that looks suspicious,
you have to block it.

1772
01:38:34.970 --> 01:38:39.140
And so there's a lot of series of that kind of very erroneous error prone

1773
01:38:39.770 --> 01:38:42.290
permissioning that goes on with,
uh,

1774
01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:44.840
the bank system that doesn't go on with bitcoin.

1775
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.270
<v 4>Yeah.
Or pay file.
I was just thinking of friend from New Zealand for a host of,</v>

1776
01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:53.630
so coincidentally,
factors just had a huge,
huge nightmare in his hand.

1777
01:38:53.631 --> 01:38:55.500
It took them months to resolve.
Yeah.

1778
01:38:55.501 --> 01:38:59.250
The way I participate in a cryptocurrency investing these days,

1779
01:38:59.251 --> 01:39:02.080
cause I don't want to have to worry about how do you procure it,

1780
01:39:02.081 --> 01:39:03.760
how do you secure it?
Uh,
oh,

1781
01:39:03.761 --> 01:39:07.440
even what to buy is I invest in hedge funds in this space.
Uh,

1782
01:39:07.441 --> 01:39:10.640
and I've actually joined when loosely as a venture partner.
Um,

1783
01:39:10.930 --> 01:39:15.280
and the biggest problem they have is getting bank accounts because the

1784
01:39:15.281 --> 01:39:16.810
regulators just digging too much.

1785
01:39:16.811 --> 01:39:21.240
If you're sending money in and out of Bitcoin or a theory makes changes,
um,

1786
01:39:21.310 --> 01:39:23.980
it's just something they haven't seen and they don't want to deal with it

1787
01:39:24.010 --> 01:39:25.120
because banks don't,

1788
01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:28.850
they don't have a system to charge you more for new weird stuff.
Um,

1789
01:39:28.851 --> 01:39:32.320
so just plugging into the existing banking infrastructure is hard and that's

1790
01:39:32.321 --> 01:39:36.150
probably where if their comp,
if countries do crackdowns,
um,

1791
01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:39.920
it will probably happen in that area.
So how do you fix it?
Or if,

1792
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:45.790
if you had close to infinite resources and could just make certain things happen

1793
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:50.960
too.
Yeah.
Facilitate good things or prevent bad things.
Yeah,

1794
01:39:50.961 --> 01:39:51.890
I mean,
first,
uh,

1795
01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:56.880
I would plug them into the existing banking system in a much better way.
They,

1796
01:39:56.881 --> 01:39:58.250
the existing banks,
you know,

1797
01:39:58.420 --> 01:40:00.970
should accept that if there's a legitimate player here,

1798
01:40:00.971 --> 01:40:04.570
they're only working with currencies that aren't scams.
Maybe they have some,

1799
01:40:04.630 --> 01:40:08.810
you know,
bonded collateral or something like that and they're legit actors.
Um,

1800
01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:11.410
they should be part of the banking system because this is the future of the

1801
01:40:11.411 --> 01:40:15.310
banking sector.
Must be banks because banks,
there are all shapes and sizes exist.

1802
01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:19.630
They do exist.
It's just they're much harder to find that you would think.
Um,
so,

1803
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:23.170
and they're more Romania down the street from 20 western unions and they're

1804
01:40:23.171 --> 01:40:25.540
warming up to it.
The forward looking ones are warming up to it,

1805
01:40:25.541 --> 01:40:29.080
but we're talking about going from like one bank in the country to like 10 banks

1806
01:40:29.081 --> 01:40:31.960
in the country,
you know,
or five.
So it's still not a large set.

1807
01:40:31.961 --> 01:40:33.460
And these are small banks generally.

1808
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:35.920
I feel like Singapore should get on that test case.

1809
01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:38.470
This is why some of these companies are going to Singapore actually.

1810
01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:40.630
And actually the,
the,

1811
01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:44.020
the worrying trend that I'm seeing is a lot of the more interesting development

1812
01:40:44.021 --> 01:40:46.120
teams and companies are all locating overseas.

1813
01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:48.280
<v 5>Yeah.
Fleeing or receives.</v>

1814
01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:51.660
One thing is that bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies,

1815
01:40:51.670 --> 01:40:56.670
they operate under such different in the banking system that people in the

1816
01:40:57.001 --> 01:40:58.380
banking system and they look at,
you know,

1817
01:40:58.381 --> 01:41:01.620
these debates about block size and the people calling each other names and the

1818
01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:06.720
basically low level of trust that exists because it can't exist in the bitcoin

1819
01:41:06.721 --> 01:41:09.660
community.
Um,
and there were horrified because he couldn't run a bank that way.

1820
01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:11.073
You have to,

1821
01:41:11.610 --> 01:41:15.140
you have to be much more polite and careful and because they're wet word,
right,

1822
01:41:15.180 --> 01:41:15.510
right.

1823
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:20.040
Because it's a wet social system rather than based primarily on dry computer

1824
01:41:20.041 --> 01:41:20.550
science.

1825
01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:21.070
<v 4>Yeah,
you have it.</v>

1826
01:41:21.070 --> 01:41:24.870
So you have a system here that allows anonymous trolls to engage in complex

1827
01:41:24.871 --> 01:41:26.340
financial transactions so they can,

1828
01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:29.250
they can scream at each other in college to the names while still doing
business.

1829
01:41:29.650 --> 01:41:34.080
Exactly.
That's the power of this system.
But it looks,
it looks horrific.

1830
01:41:34.081 --> 01:41:34.750
They don't know what else

1831
01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:35.500
<v 5>the outside,</v>

1832
01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:37.780
and that's why you have this cultural gap is because people in the banking

1833
01:41:37.781 --> 01:41:42.250
system looking at this and go,
oh,
this is,
this is terrible.
Can't possibly work

1834
01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:43.820
<v 4>to,</v>

1835
01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:46.880
to actually answer your question as to like what infrastructure needs to exist

1836
01:41:46.881 --> 01:41:49.790
to make this space happen.
Security is a big issue.

1837
01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:52.430
I think your average person today,
if they buy coin,

1838
01:41:52.730 --> 01:41:54.320
they don't know how to deal with what's called custody,

1839
01:41:54.321 --> 01:41:57.300
which is just how do you hold onto it in a way that if you,

1840
01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:00.480
if you don't go overboard in security,
you get hacked.

1841
01:42:00.510 --> 01:42:02.070
And if you go overboard and security,

1842
01:42:02.071 --> 01:42:03.880
you're going to forget your password or lose the private,

1843
01:42:04.050 --> 01:42:09.050
the all those go through a garbage dump or your or your kids playing with the

1844
01:42:09.901 --> 01:42:13.590
computer and website your,
your wallet file and there's no way to get it back.

1845
01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:18.720
So I think the secure the custody has to be solved and as nick mentioned earlier

1846
01:42:18.730 --> 01:42:20.610
there their hardware wallets that are out there,

1847
01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:23.380
they're starting to get pretty good.
Um,

1848
01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:25.800
they're getting good at enough now that you know,

1849
01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:28.230
the sophisticated people can use them,

1850
01:42:28.530 --> 01:42:31.770
but eventually they'll have to get so good that the average person can just use

1851
01:42:31.771 --> 01:42:33.360
them without having to think too much.
Yeah.

1852
01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:37.950
One of the interesting things here is that Nick's blog is called an enumerated.

1853
01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:41.260
And I'm going to let him explain what that means.

1854
01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:45.440
<v 5>Well,
yeah,
so the tagline is an endless variety of topics might,</v>

1855
01:42:45.930 --> 01:42:48.620
it's going to come to an end someday,
but,
uh,
um,

1856
01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:52.470
I don't limit myself basically is what it means on the topic.
If I,

1857
01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:55.890
if I think of something,
it will probably be relevant somehow,

1858
01:42:55.920 --> 01:43:00.220
but it doesn't necessarily have to be.
So,
um,
I,
I don't want to

1859
01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:04.840
<v 4>like peg myself as a certain into a certain subject matter basically is what it</v>

1860
01:43:04.841 --> 01:43:05.690
means.
And so the things,

1861
01:43:05.720 --> 01:43:08.980
a larger point where nick doesn't pigeonhole himself in his interests or his

1862
01:43:08.981 --> 01:43:10.140
identity,
uh,

1863
01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:13.330
and so that allows them to be more free and explore a wide arrange of

1864
01:43:13.331 --> 01:43:17.110
intellectual topics.
And so that's why I really enjoyed reading the blog.

1865
01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:19.960
And so that gives me sort of the next set of questions,

1866
01:43:19.961 --> 01:43:23.610
which are all around just random things in your blogs that I've read are things

1867
01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:25.630
that I've heard you talk about,
um,

1868
01:43:25.690 --> 01:43:29.260
which may not necessarily relate to public bitcoin or blockchains.
Um,

1869
01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:34.040
now you were the first to really convincingly argue.
Um,

1870
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:38.690
and this goes way back about why microtransactions and the Internet were much

1871
01:43:38.691 --> 01:43:41.180
less likely than people thought because when I was growing up on the Internet

1872
01:43:41.181 --> 01:43:42.140
and then late nineties,

1873
01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:45.020
everyone thought micro transactions were just around the corner.

1874
01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:46.970
What would be an example of a micro transaction?

1875
01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:50.430
It's like every time I hit a webpage with a,
with an article,

1876
01:43:50.490 --> 01:43:52.370
I pay 10 to read that webpage.

1877
01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:56.150
<v 3>Or uh,
every time we'll listen to a song,
I pay a penny that listen to that song.</v>

1878
01:43:56.410 --> 01:43:59.470
<v 5>Hmm.
Well it goes to a distinction I made earlier.</v>

1879
01:43:59.471 --> 01:44:03.850
The computational costs versus our mental costs and the computational cost.

1880
01:44:03.851 --> 01:44:07.510
We've gotten a lot cheaper and our brains still same size.

1881
01:44:07.810 --> 01:44:12.280
So when you're doing a transaction,
you're doing a,
a,

1882
01:44:12.281 --> 01:44:14.650
a thought in your brain about is it worth it?

1883
01:44:15.130 --> 01:44:20.050
And that thought itself is costly and it's this costly.
Now as it's ever been.
Um,

1884
01:44:20.590 --> 01:44:24.460
modular,
you know,
you get a few extra market prices and some more information,

1885
01:44:24.461 --> 01:44:29.150
but the,
the,
our brain is still the same size.
So,
um,

1886
01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:32.540
just because computer scientists,
we're thinking,
well,

1887
01:44:32.541 --> 01:44:35.210
because we've reduced the cost so much,
now we can do these really tiny,

1888
01:44:35.211 --> 01:44:38.630
tiny things.
Um,
because we can do things much tinier and a penny.

1889
01:44:38.631 --> 01:44:41.090
But the trouble is of our brains can't handle that.
Computers could,

1890
01:44:41.091 --> 01:44:44.540
but our brains can't.
So that's what the idea of mental transaction costs,

1891
01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:46.530
<v 3>the mental burden.
Right?</v>

1892
01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:51.580
And so there's a quote that I really enjoyed and I'm going to try to not take us

1893
01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:56.330
too off track,
but there is no track that's the good distraction.

1894
01:44:57.660 --> 01:45:01.040
This is Alfred North Whitehead.
So quote,

1895
01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:05.090
it is a profoundly erroneous truism repeated by all copy books and by eminent

1896
01:45:05.091 --> 01:45:09.200
people when they're making speeches that we should cultivate the habit of

1897
01:45:09.201 --> 01:45:10.880
thinking about what we're doing.

1898
01:45:10.881 --> 01:45:14.570
The precise opposite is the case civilization advances by extending the number

1899
01:45:14.571 --> 01:45:17.930
of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.

1900
01:45:18.170 --> 01:45:22.040
And quote,
is this applied elsewhere in your life

1901
01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:26.340
outside of blockchain?

1902
01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:30.140
Thinking about code and so on.
I mean,
do you,

1903
01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:33.470
are there ways that you minimize cognitive burden and other ways in your life

1904
01:45:33.790 --> 01:45:35.220
<v 5>minimize cognitive burden</v>

1905
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:38.900
<v 3>making these small decisions sort of cognitive microtransactions</v>

1906
01:45:39.390 --> 01:45:41.190
<v 5>yeah,
I would have to think about that for other things.</v>

1907
01:45:41.191 --> 01:45:43.290
I know what I was thinking there also.
That's a,

1908
01:45:43.810 --> 01:45:46.910
he was being quoted by Fredrick Hayak who was talking about um,

1909
01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:49.270
how knowledge is distributed and markets.

1910
01:45:49.271 --> 01:45:53.500
And so markets have traditionally been a tool where we can communicate what we

1911
01:45:53.501 --> 01:45:57.430
want and how much we have for it and stuff.

1912
01:45:57.850 --> 01:46:01.080
And that really economized were only accumulating,
you know,

1913
01:46:01.081 --> 01:46:03.880
are only using a few numbers instead of,
you know,

1914
01:46:03.881 --> 01:46:06.980
going on and on about what we want and how much we need and how much we did
more,

1915
01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.910
deserve it more than the other guy and so forth.
So that right there,

1916
01:46:09.911 --> 01:46:13.390
it's a tool of social scalability because it reduces what could be a long and

1917
01:46:13.391 --> 01:46:17.200
drawn out argument over,
you know,
to a,
to a few numbers.

1918
01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:19.030
<v 3>That was as asking.</v>

1919
01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:22.730
We obviously don't have to get into it because there may not be a ready answer.

1920
01:46:22.731 --> 01:46:27.320
But because I was,
I was with a friend,
very,
very successful investor,

1921
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:28.310
close buddy of mine.

1922
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:31.370
We were walking through the airport just having a conversation and he said,
no,

1923
01:46:31.371 --> 01:46:34.700
I've realized that I optimize now.
I used to optimize everything he said.

1924
01:46:34.701 --> 01:46:36.200
Now I happen to miss one or two things.

1925
01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:39.380
And for everything else it's just good enough.

1926
01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:43.220
I basically d optimize everything else and it's made me,

1927
01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:48.580
he in his mind incredibly more effective by actively d optimizing,

1928
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:50.190
which,
uh,
which I find

1929
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:53.460
<v 4>interesting concept.
Yeah.
I mean,
you just can't focus on everything.</v>

1930
01:46:53.461 --> 01:46:57.330
Like Charlie monger is a famously bad driver,
right?

1931
01:46:57.331 --> 01:47:00.780
He's a probably a menace on the road and it's a good,
he probably takes Uber now,

1932
01:47:00.781 --> 01:47:04.890
hopefully.
Um,
but what's the point of being a good driver today,
right?

1933
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:08.310
Especially if you have some other scope in your life where you can add unique

1934
01:47:08.311 --> 01:47:11.100
value.
Yeah.
In fact,

1935
01:47:11.130 --> 01:47:15.980
so reading your blog,
there are all these other little gems that I've found,
uh,

1936
01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:16.380
that,

1937
01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:19.920
<v 5>can we go back to word or a or a name origin for one second?
Sure.</v>

1938
01:47:19.950 --> 01:47:24.510
Does an enumerated have anything to do with the ninth amendment of the United

1939
01:47:24.510 --> 01:47:28.860
States constitution.
It does relate to that too,
because under numerated rights,

1940
01:47:28.861 --> 01:47:29.910
meaning you know,

1941
01:47:29.911 --> 01:47:33.450
there's new things going to happen with technology and other unexpected things

1942
01:47:33.451 --> 01:47:37.560
in the future and you need to define rights about around those.

1943
01:47:37.890 --> 01:47:41.460
And so you don't want to limit yourself to just that old list of,
you know,

1944
01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:44.810
we have a right to a free printing press,
but we don't have a right to,

1945
01:47:44.830 --> 01:47:49.110
to speak freely,
you know,
on Facebook or Twitter or so forth.
And uh,

1946
01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:53.870
so you,
you,
uh,
have to adapt,
um,

1947
01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:55.590
old ideas for the future.

1948
01:47:56.730 --> 01:48:00.990
<v 4>Yeah.
So basically just because the right is not explicitly listed there,</v>

1949
01:48:00.991 --> 01:48:02.370
it doesn't mean you don't have it.
In fact,

1950
01:48:02.371 --> 01:48:05.040
all of the unincorporated rights you have by default,

1951
01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:08.010
and it's only the ones that are actually restricted are the ones that are

1952
01:48:08.011 --> 01:48:09.020
restricted.
And that's,
that's,
uh,

1953
01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:12.630
something that I think our government and constitution scholars of the day just

1954
01:48:12.631 --> 01:48:16.470
completely forget,
as shown by the whole surveillance debate.
I mean,

1955
01:48:16.471 --> 01:48:19.080
it shouldn't even be a debate.
There's no,
I mean,

1956
01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:23.610
the right to privacy is very clear and even if it's not explicitly spelled out

1957
01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:25.440
our phones or private,
uh,

1958
01:48:25.441 --> 01:48:30.180
and our computers are private and our conversations are private ways of

1959
01:48:30.181 --> 01:48:31.520
thinking,
you know,
the,
the,
the,

1960
01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:33.990
the process of thought itself is kind of interesting,
right?

1961
01:48:34.260 --> 01:48:36.180
After a while you get introspective enough and you're like,

1962
01:48:36.181 --> 01:48:37.890
how am I doing on my thinking itself?

1963
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:41.490
And one of the things that we run into online a lot

1964
01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:46.380
is people jump on any little contradiction,
right?
If I say something on Twitter,

1965
01:48:46.730 --> 01:48:50.670
uh,
and if I said something different a year ago or maybe out of context and a

1966
01:48:50.671 --> 01:48:53.700
different conversation,
people will jump on me and say,
well,

1967
01:48:53.701 --> 01:48:56.190
that's not what you said.
And so,
and so it's like a big Gotcha.
Right?

1968
01:48:56.191 --> 01:48:58.530
So I think we have this false,

1969
01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:02.070
a consistency that we all try and throw up when the reality is we're always

1970
01:49:02.071 --> 01:49:05.580
changing our minds.
And you know,
I forget who said it was,
somebody said,

1971
01:49:05.790 --> 01:49:10.410
when the facts change,
I change my mind.
What do you do?
Right?
Um,

1972
01:49:10.710 --> 01:49:12.330
so I,
I've gotten,

1973
01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:16.590
I've gotten okay with this concept of contradicting myself.
Right?
What,

1974
01:49:16.591 --> 01:49:20.520
what Michelle said,
like I contradict myself very well then I contradict myself.

1975
01:49:20.610 --> 01:49:24.800
I invest,
I contain multitudes,
right?
So I've gotten used to that.
Uh,

1976
01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:28.310
but then I encountered a concept in your writing neck that I liked,
which is it,

1977
01:49:28.311 --> 01:49:32.290
which just called quantum thought.
I don't know if you even remember this.
Um,

1978
01:49:32.700 --> 01:49:37.170
do you,
do you remember what I'm talking you that comes from law school.
So lost

1979
01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:38.461
<v 5>law school,</v>

1980
01:49:38.461 --> 01:49:42.450
they teach a very different way of thinking and that you need to take,
um,

1981
01:49:42.690 --> 01:49:45.210
you know,
both the defendants and the plaintiff side of the issue,

1982
01:49:45.211 --> 01:49:50.211
both sides of the issue and run down the arguments as if each one of them is

1983
01:49:50.921 --> 01:49:54.410
true.
They contradict each other,
of course,
or at least the conclusions and,

1984
01:49:54.411 --> 01:49:56.770
and some of the sub arguments contradict each other.

1985
01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:02.350
And so I compare this to Schrodinger's cat.

1986
01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:05.560
Maybe it's alive,
maybe it's that,
maybe that defendant's guilty,
maybe,

1987
01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:07.810
maybe they're not.
And uh,

1988
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:11.380
you have to keep both of these in your mind at once.

1989
01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:13.460
<v 4>Yeah.
So,
I mean,</v>

1990
01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:18.560
this is not how we are socially taught to think socially.
We are taught,

1991
01:50:18.561 --> 01:50:20.750
you have to have a point of view.
You have to have an answer,

1992
01:50:20.751 --> 01:50:22.820
you have to pick a side,
pick your tribe,
fit in,

1993
01:50:22.821 --> 01:50:26.630
and then defend it and be consistent.
But,
uh,

1994
01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:28.730
the reality is really complicated.

1995
01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:33.540
And so if you're really smart and you're operating on the edge of any field or

1996
01:50:33.541 --> 01:50:37.400
trying to figure out anything new,
you probably need to have quantum thought.

1997
01:50:37.401 --> 01:50:40.280
You'd probably have to hold both states in your head and constantly weighing

1998
01:50:40.281 --> 01:50:43.280
probabilities.
And if you're not shifting back and forth,

1999
01:50:43.281 --> 01:50:45.410
then either you're not doing something cutting edge and you're not being

2000
01:50:45.411 --> 01:50:46.780
intellectually honest with yourself about.

2001
01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:47.901
<v 6>So I've,</v>

2002
01:50:47.901 --> 01:50:51.100
I've a question for you about this and I'll just start with just an anecdote,

2003
01:50:51.101 --> 01:50:52.390
which was,
uh,

2004
01:50:52.510 --> 01:50:57.010
I was at a friend's house recently and it was a gathering of 20 people or so.

2005
01:50:57.850 --> 01:51:02.530
And there was some structure to the weekend and people were broken out into

2006
01:51:02.531 --> 01:51:07.030
groups to have various discussions.
Everyone,
they're very intelligent,

2007
01:51:07.690 --> 01:51:11.990
normally highly rational and politics was the,

2008
01:51:12.190 --> 01:51:13.390
the topic of the day.

2009
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:18.990
And it just devolved into acid spitting and craziness almost immediately with

2010
01:51:19.481 --> 01:51:24.481
the exception of one session in the reason that session was different is that

2011
01:51:25.111 --> 01:51:27.210
the moderator said before we get started,

2012
01:51:27.810 --> 01:51:32.810
I want to go around the room and everyone needs to pick one piece.

2013
01:51:33.901 --> 01:51:38.250
It could be a tiny piece of the opposite side,

2014
01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:43.290
the person they disagree with and just argue for its validity for even 60

2015
01:51:43.291 --> 01:51:47.580
seconds and go around the room and did that and it took 10 minutes and then

2016
01:51:47.610 --> 01:51:52.610
everyone was much more open minded and patient and productive in the

2017
01:51:53.341 --> 01:51:53.911
conversation.

2018
01:51:53.911 --> 01:51:58.911
So my question for you leading off of that is how have you trained yourself to

2019
01:52:00.350 --> 01:52:05.350
practice quantum thought or how would you recommend someone develop that because

2020
01:52:06.081 --> 01:52:08.960
it's not something that most folks think about.

2021
01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:12.030
Certainly something historically I didn't dedicate a lot of time thinking about.

2022
01:52:12.170 --> 01:52:15.220
I was always more concerned with defending whatever position I feel like

2023
01:52:15.230 --> 01:52:18.870
everyone else should be engaging in.
It would actually stick.

2024
01:52:22.110 --> 01:52:24.290
<v 5>No.
Well I mean it's good.
It took,
you know,</v>

2025
01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:28.460
quite a few loss takes a few law school tests to get used to us.

2026
01:52:28.461 --> 01:52:31.470
The one thing you can do is take the first year of law school and learn how to

2027
01:52:31.471 --> 01:52:32.304
do this,

2028
01:52:32.450 --> 01:52:35.960
but imagining that you're the other person certainly in going through their

2029
01:52:35.961 --> 01:52:39.080
arguments and you might even imagine it as a,

2030
01:52:39.081 --> 01:52:42.800
as a courtroom and you trade places,
you argue for one side and then the other,

2031
01:52:42.801 --> 01:52:45.980
so you even can think of it as a court room in your,
I think it might

2032
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:46.813
<v 3>help some people.</v>

2033
01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:51.320
It seems like people who have either self selected by gravitating towards debate

2034
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:56.350
or taken debate where they're forced to take opposite positions and Ken

2035
01:52:57.271 --> 01:52:59.150
arguments helpful as well.

2036
01:52:59.620 --> 01:53:01.510
<v 4>Blasting Socrates.
Right.
And he would always,</v>

2037
01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:06.070
he would always just keep digging and arguing the point a and you can never pin

2038
01:53:06.071 --> 01:53:09.580
him down on his beliefs because he was always exploring the thought space.

2039
01:53:09.890 --> 01:53:13.160
<v 3>Well,
it's also,
I mean this practice just re people who were like,</v>

2040
01:53:13.161 --> 01:53:14.480
I don't want to be open minded,
but okay,

2041
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:16.190
they're not going to explicitly say that,

2042
01:53:16.191 --> 01:53:19.100
but if you want to be maximally persuasive,
you know,

2043
01:53:19.101 --> 01:53:21.110
Charles Darwin actually did this very,

2044
01:53:21.111 --> 01:53:26.111
very well and when I'm about to say in the origin of species is instead of Straw

2045
01:53:26.210 --> 01:53:29.840
Manning,
and I think Sam Harris is used this expression,
uh,
steel manning.

2046
01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:31.340
So in other words,
he would,

2047
01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:37.580
he would try to anticipate the objections that people would have and then he

2048
01:53:38.701 --> 01:53:42.630
would not take the sort of weak and flimsy version of their argument.

2049
01:53:42.631 --> 01:53:46.080
He would build it up and make it as compelling as possible before he would

2050
01:53:46.081 --> 01:53:49.360
counter it and his own,
you know,
writing.
That's the intellectual,

2051
01:53:49.390 --> 01:53:53.110
the honest way to do it,
which is this way.
It's also very,
very effective way.

2052
01:53:53.500 --> 01:53:55.570
Right?
Yeah.
Cause then you're actually,

2053
01:53:56.020 --> 01:53:59.330
<v 4>uh,
then you're actually arguing on the real merits,
not on what you,</v>

2054
01:53:59.450 --> 01:54:02.810
not on the anecdote.
You picked up a piece of it that you picked to attack.

2055
01:54:02.910 --> 01:54:05.910
<v 3>So Neil Strauss' and eight time New York Times bestselling author,</v>

2056
01:54:05.911 --> 01:54:06.721
he's been on the podcast,

2057
01:54:06.721 --> 01:54:10.020
but he said every time he edits his own work first yet it's for himself.

2058
01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:13.120
So he keeps the wants to keep it interesting and fun for himself.
Second,
again,

2059
01:54:13.121 --> 01:54:16.950
it's first fans,
make sure everything is clear and then he edits for his haters.

2060
01:54:17.290 --> 01:54:20.620
Hmm.
So that he can steal men and bulletproof things to the extent possible.

2061
01:54:21.090 --> 01:54:24.030
<v 4>Twitter's taught me that.
I mean you have got 160 characters.</v>

2062
01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:27.660
Everything you say at 140 most of the time everything you say will be taken out

2063
01:54:27.661 --> 01:54:32.580
of context and used to attack you.
Um,
so you really just have to boil it down.

2064
01:54:32.581 --> 01:54:35.820
You,
you have to,
you have to hone it.
Um,
and uh,

2065
01:54:35.850 --> 01:54:39.360
I tweet mainly because it helps me clarify my own thinking.

2066
01:54:41.090 --> 01:54:43.930
Yeah.
It's quite the exercise actually.
Yeah.
I think they,

2067
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:48.440
the accidental limit from text messaging days turned out to be a huge bonus for,

2068
01:54:48.441 --> 01:54:52.830
for Twitter.
Um,
yeah.
I mean,
so just kind of moving,

2069
01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:54.930
moving on a little bit there.

2070
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:57.280
There are these other little phrases your coined that,
um,

2071
01:54:57.570 --> 01:55:01.020
helped me crystallize my own thoughts.
So there's a,

2072
01:55:01.021 --> 01:55:05.560
there's a class of things that people seem to worry a lot about these days,

2073
01:55:05.561 --> 01:55:09.730
whether it's an asteroid hitting the earth or um,
you know,
uh,

2074
01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:13.630
papa apocalyptic scenarios,
floods,
skynet,
skynet,

2075
01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:18.100
Ai,
you know,
let's just say even like near term climate change predictions.

2076
01:55:18.101 --> 01:55:21.700
Like I think we're all supposed to be underwater by 2020 or something.
Right?
Um,

2077
01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:22.510
but there,

2078
01:55:22.510 --> 01:55:26.440
there is definitely a class of people who will take anything on the Internet and

2079
01:55:26.441 --> 01:55:29.170
blow it out of proportion.
And sometimes it can be a warning,

2080
01:55:29.171 --> 01:55:30.940
sometimes it can be good,
sometimes can be bad.

2081
01:55:30.941 --> 01:55:32.830
Like the general AI thing is another one of these.

2082
01:55:33.130 --> 01:55:36.490
And you summarize this whole class of,
um,

2083
01:55:37.390 --> 01:55:42.040
statements under what I thought was a brilliant,
uh,
little moniker,

2084
01:55:42.041 --> 01:55:44.760
Pascal scams and where does that come from?

2085
01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:47.930
<v 5>So that comes from Pascal's wager.
Um,</v>

2086
01:55:48.550 --> 01:55:51.710
and it can be applied to any,
any,
um,

2087
01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:56.380
claim that there's an infinite or very large reward or punishment,

2088
01:55:56.920 --> 01:56:00.880
um,
or outcome of positive or negative nature.

2089
01:56:01.330 --> 01:56:05.350
And the argument goes that even if it's a very improbable because this,

2090
01:56:05.770 --> 01:56:08.860
this reward or outcome is so large,
you should pay attention to it.

2091
01:56:08.910 --> 01:56:11.010
<v 4>Right?
And Pascal originally basically said,</v>

2092
01:56:11.011 --> 01:56:15.990
you have to believe in God because just in case,
because if
God doesn't exist,

2093
01:56:15.991 --> 01:56:18.750
who cares?
I've got does exist.
And you don't believe.
Exactly.

2094
01:56:18.751 --> 01:56:20.930
So you should believe that was the argument.

2095
01:56:21.420 --> 01:56:25.080
<v 5>The basic flaw in this kind of thing is there is an infinite number of,</v>

2096
01:56:25.250 --> 01:56:29.460
of of infinite outcomes.
If you expand your space infinity,
there's,

2097
01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:32.970
there's an infinite number of things that can happen.
So you can't,

2098
01:56:33.060 --> 01:56:36.270
the odds of any one of them happening are infinitesimal,
right?

2099
01:56:36.271 --> 01:56:41.271
So you don't get a large expected value when you multiply infinite by

2100
01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:42.450
infinitesimal.

2101
01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:47.670
It's some undefined thing you can't really reason about.
But um,

2102
01:56:48.210 --> 01:56:52.790
but people do anyway.
But people try anyway.
So they say,
well,
even,
you know,
we,

2103
01:56:53.100 --> 01:56:58.100
so this precautionary principle kind of stuff and you can only take it so far.

2104
01:56:59.590 --> 01:57:01.810
And the other problem with improbable things he is,

2105
01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:04.930
there are error bars on the probability.
You don't know if it's,
you know,

2106
01:57:05.050 --> 01:57:08.680
one in a billion or one in quadrillions or something.

2107
01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:11.500
So right there that changes your expected value.

2108
01:57:11.501 --> 01:57:13.690
Many orders of magnitude and usually you know,

2109
01:57:13.691 --> 01:57:16.810
people are trying to get attention and so forth or you know,

2110
01:57:16.811 --> 01:57:21.400
they have a job that depends on I'm scaring you and they're trying to,
uh,

2111
01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:24.220
they're trying to make you believe the probability is higher.

2112
01:57:25.020 --> 01:57:27.420
<v 4>Yeah.
It to use and the seem to labs language.
Uh,</v>

2113
01:57:27.450 --> 01:57:29.970
and you should definitely get him on the podcast some point by the way,

2114
01:57:31.410 --> 01:57:35.160
that I can do that should happen.
I've had dinner with him a few times.

2115
01:57:35.190 --> 01:57:37.490
I think that would be highly entertaining.
I would,
oh yes.

2116
01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:39.650
I want a front row seat on that.
I guess it would be under it,

2117
01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:44.130
but it's used Tellabs language.
You know,
some Black Swan is likely to happen,

2118
01:57:44.131 --> 01:57:46.620
but any particular black swan is very unlikely to happen.

2119
01:57:47.010 --> 01:57:50.430
And so people are just trying to scare you with a particular black swan and

2120
01:57:50.580 --> 01:57:52.110
because it can end your world,

2121
01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:55.950
even in fantastical probability has to be taken seriously and you can waste your

2122
01:57:55.951 --> 01:58:00.060
entire life worrying about these things,
whether it's suitcase nukes or,
um,

2123
01:58:00.170 --> 01:58:00.660
you know,

2124
01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:05.660
another financial crisis or the world exploding or imploding or cooling off or

2125
01:58:05.671 --> 01:58:06.320
whatever.

2126
01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:10.250
<v 6>Now just to,
just to touch back on the black swan though,</v>

2127
01:58:11.050 --> 01:58:12.580
Naseem and I first met,

2128
01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:17.880
if you can imagine the circumstances the day that Lehman brothers officially

2129
01:58:18.490 --> 01:58:22.840
sort of imploded,
right?
Highly improbable.
At least if you're looking back,
sir,

2130
01:58:22.841 --> 01:58:26.440
a few years prior and he has done very,

2131
01:58:26.441 --> 01:58:29.890
very well financially by not betting on all black swans,

2132
01:58:29.891 --> 01:58:34.891
but betting on a few select black swans and bleeding in small chips for long

2133
01:58:35.331 --> 01:58:38.600
periods of time before occasionally having some type of windfall like that.

2134
01:58:38.601 --> 01:58:42.370
Right.
So in when you're considering

2135
01:58:42.430 --> 01:58:45.160
<v 3>some of these improbable events,</v>

2136
01:58:45.580 --> 01:58:50.320
how do you decide which to hedge by certain behaviors or not?

2137
01:58:50.321 --> 01:58:54.050
For instance,
in San Francisco,
the,

2138
01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:58.570
I've really went deep into training with the police department and Fire

2139
01:58:58.570 --> 01:59:01.060
Department for,
uh,
the disaster response.
Right.

2140
01:59:01.090 --> 01:59:03.640
Looking at the potential consequences of say,

2141
01:59:04.150 --> 01:59:07.840
a high magnitude earthquake and it's like,
okay,

2142
01:59:08.050 --> 01:59:12.310
it probably makes sense for me to spend 100 bucks on instacart and just get away

2143
01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:16.600
when reality trip on your stairwell and well no,
no that's more likely.

2144
01:59:16.620 --> 01:59:19.770
But the point I'm making is like most people have a fire extinguisher in the

2145
01:59:19.771 --> 01:59:22.020
kitchen that they will never use.
Right.
You wear your seat belt.

2146
01:59:22.030 --> 01:59:23.670
We've probably never been in a high impact collision.

2147
01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:26.520
So there are certain classes that are low cost,

2148
01:59:26.521 --> 01:59:31.060
very easy in terms of preventative.
So how do you think about,
how do you,

2149
01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:32.250
how do you personally think about it?

2150
01:59:32.710 --> 01:59:34.250
<v 5>I mean,
but uh,
not erects not,</v>

2151
01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:38.060
<v 3>no,
that's not me.
I'm problem.
Something happens.</v>

2152
01:59:38.061 --> 01:59:40.970
A lot of people not an asteroid and destroying the planet.

2153
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:44.480
It's a probability thing.
Yeah.
Where,
where does it have the probability spectrum?

2154
01:59:44.481 --> 01:59:45.050
Is it,

2155
01:59:45.050 --> 01:59:47.840
<v 4>uh,
if it's one out of 10,000,
you know,</v>

2156
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:50.570
you should probably worry about it or at least take basic precautions.

2157
01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:51.890
If it cool.

2158
01:59:51.950 --> 01:59:56.150
If it has never happened yet but could happen and would wipe out all of
humanity,

2159
01:59:56.180 --> 01:59:57.410
or like once a generation,

2160
01:59:57.411 --> 02:00:00.780
then it's sort of in the sphere where you just can't think about it or you'll

2161
02:00:00.781 --> 02:00:01.614
just go insane.

2162
02:00:01.620 --> 02:00:04.270
<v 5>Well,
I take a first lot of people do go,
you know,
they do.</v>

2163
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:07.710
Some were crashing on a magnitude 10 quake in San Francisco.
It could happen,

2164
02:00:07.711 --> 02:00:10.050
the odds are low,
but it could happen.
Um,

2165
02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:12.540
you could keep that fire extinguisher round.
You could add somebody,

2166
02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:14.790
you could add some things,
but you know,
you're the building you're in,

2167
02:00:14.791 --> 02:00:16.110
it'll just collapse on you anyway.

2168
02:00:16.930 --> 02:00:18.650
<v 3>Um,
well,
yeah,
I mean there's,</v>

2169
02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:23.040
<v 4>oh,
the,
the extreme example of this,
the,
the one that,
uh,
you know,</v>

2170
02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:27.180
a lot of people in our social circle are constantly pedaling is a singularity

2171
02:00:27.181 --> 02:00:29.250
example.
It's very seductive.
One,
you know,

2172
02:00:29.251 --> 02:00:33.300
even Elon Musk was otherwise absolutely brilliant.
It seems to be taken in by it.

2173
02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:36.250
And,
uh,
and you know,
I give him credit for,

2174
02:00:36.300 --> 02:00:39.300
for worrying about it and thinking it through and so on,

2175
02:00:39.301 --> 02:00:42.420
but it's just another one of these pascal scammed it seems like.

2176
02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:45.180
<v 3>Can I come back to that just because I know we're going to,</v>

2177
02:00:45.210 --> 02:00:49.050
that's a big worry about really [inaudible] with this.

2178
02:00:49.640 --> 02:00:53.430
A Hornet's nest.
Yeah,
exactly.
It's not full of candy.
I don't know.

2179
02:00:53.431 --> 02:00:57.420
It depends I guess and how you go about it.
But before we get there,
nick,

2180
02:00:57.421 --> 02:01:01.940
is there anything that you worry about that many other people don't worry about?

2181
02:01:02.980 --> 02:01:05.650
<v 5>Things I worry about that many other people don't.
I don't know.</v>

2182
02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:10.330
People worry about so many things,
but I mean,
people worry about privacy,

2183
02:01:10.331 --> 02:01:13.090
but that seems to be going the wrong direction anyway.
Um,

2184
02:01:13.150 --> 02:01:16.480
you talked about the singularity,
I heard somebody coined the phrase,

2185
02:01:16.481 --> 02:01:19.930
I forgot who it was.
Creepy polarity that we're slowly,

2186
02:01:19.931 --> 02:01:23.960
life is getting creepier and creepier is more strangers are appearing in on more

2187
02:01:23.961 --> 02:01:28.180
and more personal parts of our lives.
So I worry about that.
Got It.

2188
02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:32.350
<v 3>I did do a podcast won't help.
Do you take,</v>

2189
02:01:32.410 --> 02:01:33.730
do you take preventative,

2190
02:01:33.790 --> 02:01:37.000
any particular preventative measures that other people might find helpful?

2191
02:01:37.510 --> 02:01:40.580
<v 5>I do,
but a lot of them are sub security through obscurity,
so I can't,
yeah.</v>

2192
02:01:40.650 --> 02:01:45.280
<v 3>A guy that understood.
Uh,</v>

2193
02:01:45.430 --> 02:01:49.070
alright.
So singularity,
uh,
lead the way in of all right.

2194
02:01:49.210 --> 02:01:50.440
<v 4>Well actually before we get into that,</v>

2195
02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:52.600
I think the privacy issue is really interesting.

2196
02:01:52.601 --> 02:01:56.530
One because physical privacy is being utterly destroyed and I don't think people

2197
02:01:56.531 --> 02:01:59.980
realize the extent to which is going away because cameras are essentially

2198
02:01:59.981 --> 02:02:02.310
ubiquitous and face rec and um,

2199
02:02:02.470 --> 02:02:07.470
everyone can track everything except privacy is possible in one realm,

2200
02:02:07.481 --> 02:02:10.750
but it wasn't possible before it was digital privacy and that's encryption.

2201
02:02:10.751 --> 02:02:15.220
That's a story of blockchains and blockchain computers,
I'm blushing.

2202
02:02:15.221 --> 02:02:19.030
Computers can enable digital privacy to a level that you just couldn't get

2203
02:02:19.031 --> 02:02:20.230
otherwise.
Um,

2204
02:02:20.260 --> 02:02:24.280
so one of those sets of things we didn't talk about is things like z cash and

2205
02:02:24.281 --> 02:02:28.450
Monero and other blockchains that are all about privacy.

2206
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:30.160
And if you want to touch on that at all,

2207
02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:33.120
<v 5>yeah,
there are a couple.
Um,
so you can achieve,</v>

2208
02:02:33.150 --> 02:02:35.100
because bitcoin doesn't require identity.

2209
02:02:35.101 --> 02:02:39.870
You can achieve some minimal amount of privacy.
But um,

2210
02:02:40.380 --> 02:02:45.030
once they track,
you know,
go to go to the,
again,
the Bitcoin Pheonix change,

2211
02:02:45.031 --> 02:02:47.460
they can tie the address to an identity.

2212
02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:51.260
I'm that way and a trace it back.
And there are some,
a minimal,

2213
02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:55.830
<v 4>basically if you buy on an exchange,
they'll know what account that it,</v>

2214
02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:58.170
the money was sent to or the coins were sent to.

2215
02:02:58.410 --> 02:02:59.970
And then every time the coins move,

2216
02:02:59.971 --> 02:03:02.400
someone can analyze the blockchain cause they have a copy too.

2217
02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:06.000
And they can say it went from account Exito count,
why account Y to z?

2218
02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:08.820
And they might lose track use somewhere along the way.
But,
uh,

2219
02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:12.420
I haven't heard someone say that law enforcement is starting to refer to

2220
02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:14.620
<v 3>a big coin is prosecution futures.</v>

2221
02:03:15.850 --> 02:03:20.270
Sometime in the future they will be able to unwind that who was doing be like a

2222
02:03:20.290 --> 02:03:24.640
analyzing Lance Armstrong's blood 10 years later.
Oh,
we do have that.

2223
02:03:24.641 --> 02:03:27.280
But we still have a copy and now the technology has gotten better.
Right?

2224
02:03:27.850 --> 02:03:28.683
Execution.

2225
02:03:29.140 --> 02:03:34.140
<v 5>A guy named David [inaudible] invented mixes and applying and mixing and</v>

2226
02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:38.550
blinding and applying this technique to money.
Um,
tour is a version,

2227
02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:43.560
applying it to communications,
but uh,
applying this to money.
So,
um,

2228
02:03:43.570 --> 02:03:47.300
you can do a little bit of,
I'm mixing or tumbling in Bitcoin,

2229
02:03:47.570 --> 02:03:49.550
but Minero you can do it quite a bit better.

2230
02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:53.210
And then z cash hasn't even more advanced.
Um,
privacy features.

2231
02:03:53.970 --> 02:03:58.620
<v 4>Yeah.
Essentially the,
when they're,
uh,
uh,
and I don't want to,</v>

2232
02:03:59.060 --> 02:04:03.200
the mineral community is very acidic,
then they fight the z cash communities.

2233
02:04:03.201 --> 02:04:07.320
So they get into battles with each other,
but they are different approaches.

2234
02:04:07.470 --> 02:04:11.050
One approach is I'm doing a transaction and there are five other people do a

2235
02:04:11.051 --> 02:04:13.670
transaction.
We all pull our transactions together.

2236
02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:16.850
And then so it's someone who's trying to analyze the blockchain.

2237
02:04:16.851 --> 02:04:19.340
We'll just see that five transactions were done and these are the five

2238
02:04:19.341 --> 02:04:22.880
participants.
But you've law,
they can't tell what,
when to whom.

2239
02:04:23.390 --> 02:04:27.860
And something like z cash takes it a step further and just the entire ledger is

2240
02:04:27.861 --> 02:04:30.410
opaque.
Like it's all cryptographically protected.

2241
02:04:30.411 --> 02:04:32.150
You can't tell who exchanged what.

2242
02:04:32.540 --> 02:04:36.620
And there are these crazy complicated proofs that go into proving who still has

2243
02:04:36.621 --> 02:04:41.460
what money.
Um,
and in theory,
z cash is much,

2244
02:04:41.550 --> 02:04:44.550
is very private.
It's sort of the extreme edge of privacy,

2245
02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:48.210
but it's computationally extremely expensive and it's brand new cryptography,

2246
02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:50.610
which hasn't yet withstood the test of time.

2247
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:55.790
<v 6>What makes a particular currency appreciate and value?</v>

2248
02:04:57.271 --> 02:04:59.930
I know this is probably a stupid sounding question,
but I guess there's,

2249
02:04:59.970 --> 02:05:04.970
because on one hand you have [inaudible] these nuanced sort of technological

2250
02:05:06.180 --> 02:05:10.970
features,
right?
So if someone might focus or say as a particular currency,

2251
02:05:10.990 --> 02:05:15.240
my focus more on privacy and then another might focus more on x,
y,
and Z,

2252
02:05:15.930 --> 02:05:20.450
then you have supply and demand,
right?
If Kim Carr,

2253
02:05:20.540 --> 02:05:23.760
if Kim Kardashian gets up tomorrow morning and decides that she's read a lot

2254
02:05:23.761 --> 02:05:27.060
about bitcoin and wants to Instagram about it for the next 10 days straight,

2255
02:05:27.300 --> 02:05:29.160
I would imagine that would have an impact on prices.

2256
02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:31.760
<v 4>I think you can look at a framework of,
you can say,
first of all,</v>

2257
02:05:31.790 --> 02:05:36.340
is this doing something novel and useful?
Like is this useful?

2258
02:05:36.590 --> 02:05:41.380
Um,
is privacy useful?
Is Computation you useful?
Is exchanging money useful?

2259
02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:44.950
Then you can say,
is this the right technology solution?

2260
02:05:44.980 --> 02:05:47.290
Cause there's probably 20 other blockchains competing for it.

2261
02:05:47.710 --> 02:05:49.330
Then is it being adopted?

2262
02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:51.490
Is there a network effect to people have in their wallets?

2263
02:05:51.491 --> 02:05:55.840
Is the infrastructure exist?
Are they using it?
Uh,
and then supply and demand.

2264
02:05:56.050 --> 02:05:57.670
And that gets gamed a lot.

2265
02:05:57.710 --> 02:06:01.480
Sometimes the developers of these coins are pumping out more coins in the

2266
02:06:01.481 --> 02:06:01.961
background.

2267
02:06:01.961 --> 02:06:04.660
You don't know are they reserve the right and it read the source code to figure

2268
02:06:04.661 --> 02:06:08.110
it out.
So that's why investing in some of these extreme,
uh,

2269
02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:11.890
so called altcoins or app coins is very scary.
Um,

2270
02:06:11.920 --> 02:06:14.560
but there are other applications coming up that are really interesting.

2271
02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:18.490
So there's like a one coming out called file coin,
uh,
where I'm a small investor,

2272
02:06:18.491 --> 02:06:22.480
so disclaimer,
but there are others,
this storage storage and others,

2273
02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:26.440
I like that also that are basically trying to create a network of distributed

2274
02:06:26.441 --> 02:06:28.090
computers that will do storage for you.

2275
02:06:28.091 --> 02:06:31.210
So instead of uploading your files to Dropbox or Amazon,

2276
02:06:31.850 --> 02:06:36.190
you can upload massive files into these distributed storage and networks that

2277
02:06:36.191 --> 02:06:39.730
will take your data encrypted split across thousands of machines.

2278
02:06:40.060 --> 02:06:42.400
And then they'll test to make sure your file is still available,

2279
02:06:42.401 --> 02:06:47.060
the network if you ever need it back.
And then you'll pay people in the coin.
Um,

2280
02:06:47.130 --> 02:06:49.130
and so people who you don't know,

2281
02:06:49.160 --> 02:06:53.000
grandmothers in India might be holding a piece of your file and waiting to serve

2282
02:06:53.001 --> 02:06:57.410
it back to you when you need it,
uh,
as a backup or just for storage or serving.

2283
02:06:57.730 --> 02:07:01.820
Um,
and you'll be paying them fully anonymously and from far away and the whole

2284
02:07:01.821 --> 02:07:05.540
transaction is handled to the network.
Um,
there's another one called block stack,

2285
02:07:05.541 --> 02:07:09.050
which is building an infrastructure for the decentralized internet,

2286
02:07:09.051 --> 02:07:12.920
including domain names,
names,
serving,
uh,

2287
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:14.540
done in a distributed fashion today.

2288
02:07:14.541 --> 02:07:18.110
All the name servers are controlled by ICANN and verisign and so on.

2289
02:07:18.410 --> 02:07:21.020
But what if you could split that out amongst the distributed network of

2290
02:07:21.021 --> 02:07:25.550
computers?
You could pay people in coin,
uh,
on the network for doing that.

2291
02:07:25.551 --> 02:07:29.060
So these kinds of applications are coming up and for each one of these you look

2292
02:07:29.061 --> 02:07:33.590
at like,
is it novel,
is it useful?
What's the competition?
Is a code secure?

2293
02:07:33.591 --> 02:07:36.940
Other developers,
scammers or their back doors was supply and demand.

2294
02:07:37.180 --> 02:07:39.310
So it's still completely wild west,

2295
02:07:39.340 --> 02:07:42.540
which is both the opportunity and the terror of it.
I mean the,

2296
02:07:42.541 --> 02:07:45.410
I think the average person who's investing in coins,
uh,

2297
02:07:45.420 --> 02:07:48.390
on most of them is probably going to lose their shirts over a long enough period

2298
02:07:48.391 --> 02:07:51.900
of time because the scammers are really sophisticated.
Uh,

2299
02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:55.580
but I think the really smart people who know what they're doing and maybe get a

2300
02:07:55.581 --> 02:07:59.340
little bit lucky,
you're going to make generational fortunes.
Nick,

2301
02:07:59.341 --> 02:08:03.810
what are your thoughts on singularity?
So,
well,
well,
getting back to Pascal,

2302
02:08:03.811 --> 02:08:06.120
I was going,
I was going to try to do something clever with generations,

2303
02:08:06.121 --> 02:08:08.460
but I was like,
you know what,
I can do this.
A lot of the,
I,

2304
02:08:08.620 --> 02:08:13.620
I those are scams and Pascal scams are these big scams where like you can't

2305
02:08:13.621 --> 02:08:16.440
calculate the probabilities because you're dealing with affinities.

2306
02:08:16.740 --> 02:08:20.250
And the most recent of the Pascal scams is making the rounds is a singularity.

2307
02:08:21.290 --> 02:08:23.580
<v 5>Yeah.
So the,
I mean,
the idea of the singularity,</v>

2308
02:08:23.610 --> 02:08:27.430
they've seen this exponential growth in computer resources and the fact that

2309
02:08:27.431 --> 02:08:32.170
computers are outstripping humans.
And then they sort of impute from that,

2310
02:08:32.171 --> 02:08:36.610
that,
and you can also see computers take over,
um,
you know,

2311
02:08:36.611 --> 02:08:39.520
things that used to be considered a sign of intelligence to be able to add and

2312
02:08:39.521 --> 02:08:43.570
subtract quickly and now computers can do that and billions of times faster than

2313
02:08:43.571 --> 02:08:46.570
humans.
So,
and the gap keeps growing and growing.

2314
02:08:46.580 --> 02:08:48.580
Once you computer can do something,

2315
02:08:48.581 --> 02:08:50.170
the gaps just going to keep growing and growing.

2316
02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:54.490
But the idea of the singularity tends to be the,
you get a general intelligence,

2317
02:08:54.491 --> 02:08:55.570
like it at some point,

2318
02:08:55.571 --> 02:08:59.110
computers can do everything humans can do and all of a sudden,
you know,

2319
02:08:59.111 --> 02:09:01.330
very quickly they can do it faster and faster and faster.

2320
02:09:01.660 --> 02:09:06.250
They start designing improved versions of themselves and it's a runaway effect

2321
02:09:06.251 --> 02:09:11.200
and human soon become obsolete or pray for terminators and whatever we can't

2322
02:09:11.201 --> 02:09:14.730
predict.
And so one of the,
one of the,
uh,
conceits is the idea that,

2323
02:09:14.731 --> 02:09:18.670
oh well no longer be able to predict the future.
Um,
the thing is that's,

2324
02:09:18.930 --> 02:09:21.890
that's basically true today for a lot of things.
You can't,
you know,
you know,

2325
02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:24.330
the stock markets and ongoing running singularity,

2326
02:09:24.331 --> 02:09:27.700
you can't predict day to day if you could,
you could make a fortune.
So,

2327
02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.690
<v 4>yeah,
you laid out a lot of arguments against it.</v>

2328
02:09:29.691 --> 02:09:32.890
And another one is just what does this general intelligence thing like humans

2329
02:09:32.891 --> 02:09:36.700
are highly adaptive specialized machines and every other animal that's around

2330
02:09:36.701 --> 02:09:39.700
today,
including the cockroaches,
just as evolved as we are,

2331
02:09:39.701 --> 02:09:41.110
it's just different fitness functions.

2332
02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:44.620
And so it has a different concept of intelligence that it needs to survive.

2333
02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:48.790
And machine intelligence that we've developed so far to extremely specialized.

2334
02:09:49.090 --> 02:09:52.690
So there probably is no such thing as general intelligence a.
Instead,

2335
02:09:52.691 --> 02:09:56.680
what we have is machines that are brilliant at calculation but terrible at other

2336
02:09:56.681 --> 02:09:59.440
things and now they're getting brilliant or face recognition.

2337
02:09:59.441 --> 02:10:02.800
But that doesn't mean they're going to be really great at me solving my next

2338
02:10:02.830 --> 02:10:04.370
debate with my wife.
Right.

2339
02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:07.920
<v 6>It's something else you touched on that,
uh,</v>

2340
02:10:08.570 --> 02:10:12.800
I appreciated.
And as a non scientist,

2341
02:10:12.801 --> 02:10:16.850
none engineer who sometimes pretends to do such and physical performance and

2342
02:10:16.851 --> 02:10:21.110
whatnot,
uh,
quote there is as Fineman sets,
it's Richard Fiman.

2343
02:10:21.500 --> 02:10:25.070
Everybody should read a surely you're joking.
Mr. Simon.
But I digress.

2344
02:10:25.100 --> 02:10:27.770
There is this Fineman said quote plenty of room at the bottom end quote,

2345
02:10:27.771 --> 02:10:30.830
but it is by no means infinite given actual demonstrated physics.

2346
02:10:30.831 --> 02:10:33.080
That means all growth curves that look exponential,

2347
02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:36.890
more in the short run turn over and become s curves are similar in the long run

2348
02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:41.000
unless we discover physics that we do not now know as information and data

2349
02:10:41.001 --> 02:10:44.090
processing under physics as we know it are limited by the number of particles we

2350
02:10:44.091 --> 02:10:44.924
have access to.

2351
02:10:45.140 --> 02:10:49.190
And that in turn can only increase in the long run by at most a cubic
polynomial.

2352
02:10:49.780 --> 02:10:52.520
Uh,
and probably much less than that since spaces mostly empty.

2353
02:10:53.090 --> 02:10:57.710
It seems underlying this singularity is the assumption that exponential

2354
02:10:58.220 --> 02:10:58.940
continues

2355
02:10:58.940 --> 02:11:01.200
<v 5>to be exponential indefinitely.
Right?</v>

2356
02:11:01.201 --> 02:11:05.720
I mean we've had exponential growth for computers for most of the last century.

2357
02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:06.350
Yeah.

2358
02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:11.270
And so we have this vast resources that I've already talked about to take

2359
02:11:11.271 --> 02:11:15.950
advantage of,
but the future,
you're going to face these physics limits,
you know,

2360
02:11:15.951 --> 02:11:19.880
limits on the heat that you're circuits give out.
They turn into toasters,
um,

2361
02:11:20.690 --> 02:11:23.480
and,
and so forth.
So,
um,
yeah,

2362
02:11:23.481 --> 02:11:25.940
and it's the limit set by quantum mechanics and we're,

2363
02:11:26.030 --> 02:11:27.380
we've reached that in some,

2364
02:11:27.381 --> 02:11:31.400
I don't think Moore's law really applies to transistors necessarily anymore.

2365
02:11:31.940 --> 02:11:34.610
The original Moore's law is not the number of transistors.

2366
02:11:34.611 --> 02:11:37.910
I think that's already,
yeah,
there's a physical limits of how

2367
02:11:38.060 --> 02:11:40.840
<v 4>far transistors and go.
Then there's a question about transistors,</v>

2368
02:11:40.860 --> 02:11:44.330
even the right medium,
like maybe to exhibit our kind,

2369
02:11:44.331 --> 02:11:46.280
our variation of specialized intelligence.

2370
02:11:46.370 --> 02:11:50.390
It needs to be on wet where like it needs to be on tissue and we have not yet

2371
02:11:50.391 --> 02:11:53.540
gotten to growing brain tissue and then programming it.
That's a long ways off.

2372
02:11:54.230 --> 02:11:58.980
Um,
and then you have to deal with the fact that our brains evolve and our

2373
02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:01.480
intelligence evolves in reaction to our environment.

2374
02:12:01.900 --> 02:12:04.990
And even genetic algorithms evolve in reaction to fitness functions.

2375
02:12:05.410 --> 02:12:10.120
So you not only would you have to create a computer that could run on our tissue

2376
02:12:10.121 --> 02:12:12.340
to inhibit,
to exhibit our kind of intelligence,

2377
02:12:12.670 --> 02:12:15.580
but then you would also have to put it in our kind of environment and it's rid

2378
02:12:15.581 --> 02:12:19.220
of learning would be limited by what inputs are environment can provide,
right,

2379
02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:20.740
and if you're going to go do all that work,

2380
02:12:20.741 --> 02:12:23.650
then just have a baby takes nine months and we already know how to do anything

2381
02:12:23.740 --> 02:12:24.573
right time.

2382
02:12:24.990 --> 02:12:27.510
<v 6>Well on that point related to environment,
this is a,</v>

2383
02:12:27.700 --> 02:12:31.860
and you've written quite a bit on this,
but I underlined one portion quote,

2384
02:12:32.050 --> 02:12:35.680
so these evolutionary techniques and other machine learning techniques or are

2385
02:12:35.681 --> 02:12:37.480
often interesting and useful,
but the sun,

2386
02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:42.130
this severely limited ability of computers to simulate most real world phenomena

2387
02:12:42.131 --> 02:12:44.020
means that no runways in store,

2388
02:12:44.380 --> 02:12:46.720
just potentially much more incremental improvements,

2389
02:12:46.721 --> 02:12:51.040
which which will be much greater in Simi lable arenas and much smaller and

2390
02:12:51.041 --> 02:12:53.700
others and will slowly improve as the accuracy and completeness of our

2391
02:12:53.701 --> 02:12:57.030
simulations slowly improves.
Just to underscore what you just said,

2392
02:12:57.900 --> 02:13:00.780
you need access to the environment or the ability to create,
right.

2393
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:03.920
<v 4>There's also a probabilistic argument against general intelligence,</v>

2394
02:13:03.980 --> 02:13:08.960
which is the universe is so vast and so large that if generally it's like it's

2395
02:13:08.961 --> 02:13:09.560
the same,

2396
02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:12.590
it's the same people who make the gentleman today's argument also make the we're

2397
02:13:12.591 --> 02:13:14.060
living in a simulation argument.

2398
02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:18.590
Well they kind of both can't be true because if we're living in a simulation,

2399
02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:19.940
uh,

2400
02:13:19.940 --> 02:13:24.060
then that means that at some point we already invented a general intelligence.

2401
02:13:24.061 --> 02:13:26.880
Like when you get the technological capability to invent a simulation of this

2402
02:13:26.881 --> 02:13:28.340
complexity,
um,

2403
02:13:28.410 --> 02:13:32.070
probabilistically and you believe general intelligence that possible it through

2404
02:13:32.071 --> 02:13:34.020
the mechanism described in the singularity,

2405
02:13:34.021 --> 02:13:36.030
then we probably already hit that along the way.

2406
02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:39.570
So that means that whatever that gentlemen AI is already exists and we're just

2407
02:13:39.571 --> 02:13:40.740
living inside it sim.

2408
02:13:41.310 --> 02:13:44.580
So why do we have to worry about it suddenly emerging here and then killing us

2409
02:13:44.581 --> 02:13:45.540
all?
Yeah.

2410
02:13:46.930 --> 02:13:51.090
So the people who are both holding the simulation hypothesis in their head and

2411
02:13:51.091 --> 02:13:54.330
the singularity being around the corner and their head are sort of at a deep

2412
02:13:54.331 --> 02:13:55.710
level contradicting themselves.

2413
02:13:55.870 --> 02:14:00.550
<v 6>Particularly if,
I don't know,
I guess the,
so the simulation,</v>

2414
02:14:00.551 --> 02:14:02.520
I wish we had Sam Harris here to talk about.
I don't know.

2415
02:14:02.530 --> 02:14:05.020
I've mentioned that somebody I was just talking about freewill.
He isn't it.
He's,

2416
02:14:05.021 --> 02:14:07.570
he's interesting to talk to you about that,
but the,

2417
02:14:07.670 --> 02:14:12.580
the idea that something would come to be that is a thousand,
a million times,

2418
02:14:12.581 --> 02:14:15.350
a billion times more generalizable.

2419
02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:18.130
He intelligent than we are and their priority would be killing us.

2420
02:14:18.430 --> 02:14:22.660
It's just like my,
my,
my directive in life,
being running around,

2421
02:14:22.661 --> 02:14:24.940
killing cockroaches,
no cockroaches.

2422
02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:28.780
I don't really care so much about them but it seems odd.

2423
02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:32.940
<v 4>Yeah.
I think that movie her actually did it pretty well,
which is,
you know,</v>

2424
02:14:32.970 --> 02:14:36.990
when the general AI evolves in that movie,
it just left.
Yeah.

2425
02:14:37.510 --> 02:14:39.510
He didn't care about this world at all.

2426
02:14:40.730 --> 02:14:42.410
<v 6>Uh,
sooner vault,
you've,</v>

2427
02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:44.280
you've mentioned a bunch of things you're not worried about.

2428
02:14:44.610 --> 02:14:46.680
I'm curious to ask you the same question as nick,

2429
02:14:46.681 --> 02:14:51.681
which is what are the things that occupy your mind more than perhaps other folks

2430
02:14:52.411 --> 02:14:53.340
are?
Many other people,

2431
02:14:53.890 --> 02:14:58.890
<v 4>I try to keep it very low level of mental surface activity for anything other</v>

2432
02:15:01.261 --> 02:15:03.210
than whatever I'm directly dealing with in the moment.

2433
02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:06.720
And one of the ways I'm trying to do that is by stripping away layers of

2434
02:15:06.721 --> 02:15:07.554
identity.

2435
02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:12.780
So I don't want to or they identify as Indian or American or libertarian or are

2436
02:15:12.810 --> 02:15:17.810
Democrat or any of those kinds of things because one that sort of keeps me from

2437
02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:21.630
actually engaging in thinking as I need to.
It's all preconceived beliefs.

2438
02:15:21.631 --> 02:15:24.130
It makes me more defensive because once you,

2439
02:15:24.250 --> 02:15:26.190
the reason you can't talk about politics that anybody's,

2440
02:15:26.191 --> 02:15:30.240
because it attacks our identity at the core level.
Every tweet I put out,

2441
02:15:30.270 --> 02:15:35.010
I now know that even if I attack a general class of activity,

2442
02:15:35.250 --> 02:15:38.430
all the people who are engaged in that activity will respond.

2443
02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:40.990
So like I put out a tweet about how you want to,
you know,

2444
02:15:41.090 --> 02:15:43.020
value investing in venture investing or both.

2445
02:15:43.370 --> 02:15:47.420
Longterm investing and trading is this get rich quick scheme,
which doesn't work.

2446
02:15:47.660 --> 02:15:50.450
And so of course,
all the people who've got really angry about that,

2447
02:15:50.451 --> 02:15:52.880
I guess clicked through to the bio.
And sure enough,
they're traders like that.

2448
02:15:52.881 --> 02:15:55.100
That's what they do.
They trade all the time and for Wall Street,

2449
02:15:55.190 --> 02:15:58.820
and that's how they make a living.
So if you attack someone's identity,

2450
02:15:58.821 --> 02:16:01.550
you're shut down all conversation with them.
That's why politics,

2451
02:16:01.580 --> 02:16:04.270
political conversations don't work.
So conversely,

2452
02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:09.140
if you want to be rational and open minded,
you should not have an identity.

2453
02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:12.530
And the less of an identity you can absorb can adopt the better.

2454
02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:17.600
<v 6>How do you train yourself to identify less as Indian as excess?</v>

2455
02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:18.290
Why?

2456
02:16:18.290 --> 02:16:21.960
<v 4>Human consistency bias,
a powerful thing.
So just when someone asks you,</v>

2457
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:24.920
are you a libertarian?
Just say I'm not anything.
You know,

2458
02:16:25.450 --> 02:16:26.940
if they say like a religious,

2459
02:16:26.941 --> 02:16:30.010
you know that they don't say anything like look like Marty is one of my favorite

2460
02:16:30.011 --> 02:16:34.690
philosophers.
When he met the pope,
uh,
you know,
the,
the pope said to him like,

2461
02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:38.920
you know,
I'm,
I'm pope blah,
blah,
blah,
you know,
from this lineage and so on.

2462
02:16:38.921 --> 02:16:41.830
Who are you and Christian word?
He's just said,
I'm nobody.
Right?

2463
02:16:41.831 --> 02:16:44.530
But he was being serious.
Like I don't even know what I am.

2464
02:16:44.531 --> 02:16:47.140
I'm just this thing that's here right now in this environment,

2465
02:16:47.141 --> 02:16:51.010
reacting to the inputs from the environment according to my conditioning.

2466
02:16:51.340 --> 02:16:55.330
And I'm trying to be as unconditioned as possible,
but that's why my,
uh,

2467
02:16:55.360 --> 02:16:58.420
my Twitter,
um,
uh,

2468
02:16:58.450 --> 02:17:02.830
my Twitter Avatar is like a sketch of a human face because it's turning to

2469
02:17:02.831 --> 02:17:04.360
remind me to be unconditioned.

2470
02:17:04.450 --> 02:17:07.300
You don't want to be over conditioned and you don't want to be overly strong

2471
02:17:07.301 --> 02:17:08.134
with your identity.

2472
02:17:08.170 --> 02:17:09.850
<v 6>You guys mentioned Twitter earlier,</v>

2473
02:17:09.851 --> 02:17:12.430
so one of the things that you may have noticed,
I do this,

2474
02:17:12.431 --> 02:17:17.431
but I routinely put out things on Twitter and Facebook that I used to call my

2475
02:17:18.551 --> 02:17:23.551
audience of hypersensitive people or that I know will just kick the Hornet's

2476
02:17:25.961 --> 02:17:30.310
nest enough to force people to self select one way or the other.
Yeah.

2477
02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:35.520
And I have to be careful not to then accidentally create a group where they all

2478
02:17:35.831 --> 02:17:39.400
have sort of group health.
Yeah,
exactly.
Thank you.

2479
02:17:39.401 --> 02:17:41.710
Want to prune the trees in the forest for the trees?
A little bit.

2480
02:17:41.711 --> 02:17:45.470
But also what that does is,
uh,

2481
02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:49.060
it gives me more,
I fee,

2482
02:17:49.061 --> 02:17:53.320
I perceive having more freedom of speech or willingness to speak my mind because

2483
02:17:53.321 --> 02:17:54.770
I'm progressively,
uh,

2484
02:17:56.390 --> 02:17:58.640
creating less and less of a reputation to protect.

2485
02:17:59.130 --> 02:18:02.220
<v 4>Yes.
And so that's right.
Yeah.
I do the exact same thing,</v>

2486
02:18:02.250 --> 02:18:04.670
which is I would say every,
every couple of months,

2487
02:18:04.671 --> 02:18:07.250
my tweet stream gets a little edgier,
right.

2488
02:18:07.630 --> 02:18:11.180
As I've sort of pushed out the people who can't deal with what I'm saying,
uh,

2489
02:18:11.181 --> 02:18:14.420
and I've muted them or block them or just stay one followed me or what have you.

2490
02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:18.110
Um,
and I didn't used to block,
but now I've had to like,

2491
02:18:18.111 --> 02:18:20.570
it's just because there's always somebody who's Straw man,

2492
02:18:20.571 --> 02:18:21.410
whatever you're saying,

2493
02:18:21.411 --> 02:18:25.400
get outraged and to start a fire and assemble a mob around it to like burn you

2494
02:18:25.401 --> 02:18:26.870
at the state.
Uh,

2495
02:18:26.900 --> 02:18:30.110
and unfortunately it's a lot of the best people on Twitter have left because of

2496
02:18:30.111 --> 02:18:34.130
that issue.
Right?
Like p market probably being the most famous,
but uh,
you know,

2497
02:18:34.131 --> 02:18:37.550
you can put out a hundred tweets a day and you say one thing wrong and one of

2498
02:18:37.551 --> 02:18:38.960
them and they're trying to burn you at the stake.

2499
02:18:39.140 --> 02:18:42.500
It's always the most controversial ones of mine that get put on reddit and

2500
02:18:42.501 --> 02:18:46.880
spread beyond.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
P Marker for those interested.

2501
02:18:46.910 --> 02:18:47.810
That's Marc Andreesen.

2502
02:18:48.110 --> 02:18:52.160
I think this is a general phenomenon where society has not yet figured out how

2503
02:18:52.161 --> 02:18:54.800
to deal with social media.
I think like in my kids' generation,

2504
02:18:54.801 --> 02:18:57.590
there'll be saying all kinds of crazy things and Twitter and nobody will care.

2505
02:18:57.950 --> 02:19:00.400
Nobody will lose a job over it and nobody will get worked up over it.

2506
02:19:00.410 --> 02:19:03.650
Cause everyone was saying everything crazy all the time.
But right now,

2507
02:19:03.651 --> 02:19:06.710
and we were transitioning from a world of our thoughts being private to our

2508
02:19:06.711 --> 02:19:09.350
thoughts,
being public.
People are still getting outraged.

2509
02:19:09.351 --> 02:19:14.351
But to me like the people who get outraged or sort of the most anachronistic,

2510
02:19:14.900 --> 02:19:18.290
least intelligent members of society and I'm happy to leave them behind.

2511
02:19:18.700 --> 02:19:22.600
The more easily outrage you are,
the less I want to have to do with you.
Be Gone.

2512
02:19:22.630 --> 02:19:24.250
So if you think words can hurt you,

2513
02:19:24.580 --> 02:19:27.980
you're going to live in a world of misery and pain your entire life.

2514
02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:32.030
<v 3>So on that note,
I'd like to wrap up.
Just kidding.
Uh,
so,</v>

2515
02:19:32.510 --> 02:19:36.850
so I want to gear shift for a second and ask a few questions,
uh,

2516
02:19:36.851 --> 02:19:39.710
of units that are not directly related to they might be,

2517
02:19:39.770 --> 02:19:44.510
they might edge into it but not directly related to a cryptocurrency.
Uh,

2518
02:19:44.511 --> 02:19:49.511
the first is if people want to explore your blog and you have some very

2519
02:19:50.541 --> 02:19:54.580
extensive writing and where might you suggest they start?

2520
02:19:55.220 --> 02:20:00.190
Is there a particular piece or a few pieces that might be a good diving in point

2521
02:20:00.191 --> 02:20:01.024
for people?

2522
02:20:01.090 --> 02:20:04.510
<v 5>Yeah,
so for our blockchains and cryptocurrencies and smart contracts,</v>

2523
02:20:04.540 --> 02:20:07.310
probably the two best ones.
Um,

2524
02:20:07.311 --> 02:20:12.311
money blockchains and social scalability is a recent blog post of mine.

2525
02:20:13.580 --> 02:20:18.580
And then in a somewhat older blog cope post called dawn of trustworthy

2526
02:20:18.681 --> 02:20:19.514
computing.

2527
02:20:20.030 --> 02:20:23.480
<v 3>What are some of the subjects that you enjoy exploring outside of the ones that</v>

2528
02:20:23.660 --> 02:20:26.900
we've already heard about in terms of the,

2529
02:20:27.470 --> 02:20:31.640
we understand the fascination with money,
currency law,

2530
02:20:32.330 --> 02:20:36.530
what are other interests that might not be immediately evident to people if

2531
02:20:36.531 --> 02:20:37.490
they're reading your blog?

2532
02:20:38.070 --> 02:20:41.340
<v 5>Yeah,
and we also mentioned the origins of money origins that in big interest in</v>

2533
02:20:41.350 --> 02:20:44.970
related interest of mine.
Um,
and history in general.
I read a lot of history.

2534
02:20:45.120 --> 02:20:49.290
Any particular I economic and legal history mostly.

2535
02:20:49.860 --> 02:20:50.940
Um,
so

2536
02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:56.640
<v 3>are there any particular resources or books that you've enjoyed in that area?</v>

2537
02:20:57.240 --> 02:21:00.640
<v 5>Um,
so Alford Crosby's the Colombian exchange,</v>

2538
02:21:00.660 --> 02:21:04.100
which is basically what Jared diamond ripped off when he

2539
02:21:04.220 --> 02:21:09.170
<v 3>wrote his
Alfred Crosby wrote the original better version.</v>

2540
02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:13.160
I know he just really,
Jared diamond for me,
it turns out he was this a popular,

2541
02:21:14.110 --> 02:21:14.300
yeah,

2542
02:21:14.300 --> 02:21:18.140
Jared diamond's a hypothesis on what happened on Easter island also turns out

2543
02:21:18.590 --> 02:21:23.530
that's right.
I'm probably not huge lapse.
Not that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We all do.

2544
02:21:23.540 --> 02:21:25.280
We all make our mistakes.
The,
uh,

2545
02:21:26.190 --> 02:21:30.810
one of the questions I ask guests on the podcast oftentimes is what books have

2546
02:21:30.811 --> 02:21:32.340
you gifted the most other people?

2547
02:21:33.030 --> 02:21:35.820
And I don't know if you have any of that come to mind.

2548
02:21:36.070 --> 02:21:40.060
<v 5>Um,
so Richard Dawkins,
the selfish gene is,
is sort of on my essential,</v>

2549
02:21:40.570 --> 02:21:43.870
everybody should read this list.
Yeah,
definitely.
One of the classics.

2550
02:21:44.490 --> 02:21:48.330
<v 3>All the doctrines is getting outraged on the Internet a lot these days.
He's,</v>

2551
02:21:48.450 --> 02:21:50.520
he's good at the same kind of outrage.

2552
02:21:53.010 --> 02:21:54.760
Oh my God.
I saw a,
uh,

2553
02:21:55.210 --> 02:21:59.460
public speak public talk of his in the Los Angeles.
Not too long.

2554
02:21:59.461 --> 02:22:02.430
It was food's fantastic,
but I was just like every given second,
I'm like,

2555
02:22:02.431 --> 02:22:07.280
I wonder if this room is going to explode.
Not with outrage or applause,

2556
02:22:07.290 --> 02:22:10.800
like literally a,
any other books,
that kind of mind.

2557
02:22:10.950 --> 02:22:15.330
<v 5>And I mean,
Matt release written several good books on,
on evolution,</v>

2558
02:22:15.331 --> 02:22:18.420
social evolution,
and a couple of genetic evolution as well.

2559
02:22:18.421 --> 02:22:23.190
Do you spell his last name?
Matt.
R.
I.
D.
L.
E.
Y.
Oh,
Ridley.
Okay,
got it.

2560
02:22:23.220 --> 02:22:23.610
Yeah,

2561
02:22:23.610 --> 02:22:28.290
I think three or four of my top 20 books of all time are all read these rational

2562
02:22:28.291 --> 02:22:33.090
optimist genome red queen origins of virtue,
which is your favorite.

2563
02:22:33.840 --> 02:22:34.860
If you had to recommend one,

2564
02:22:34.890 --> 02:22:39.090
if you had to recommend one rational optimist and he has evolution of
everything,

2565
02:22:39.091 --> 02:22:40.440
which I haven't read yet.

2566
02:22:41.250 --> 02:22:45.960
If you were teaching a this fee you neck,
if you were teaching a,

2567
02:22:45.961 --> 02:22:50.961
let's call it a high school freshmen class or seminar,

2568
02:22:52.290 --> 02:22:55.400
could be on any topic,
what would you teach?
Well,

2569
02:22:55.430 --> 02:23:00.430
I just gave some lectures at my a honorary doctorate university.

2570
02:23:01.070 --> 02:23:05.220
I'm on related lectures on the origins of money and blockchains and

2571
02:23:05.221 --> 02:23:06.054
cryptocurrencies.

2572
02:23:06.390 --> 02:23:11.390
So to me those are three closely related topics that I like to and how they're

2573
02:23:12.430 --> 02:23:16.680
really for what period of time did he teach that class or was it an hour long

2574
02:23:17.310 --> 02:23:19.390
lecture?
So I tried to cram way too much into it.

2575
02:23:20.640 --> 02:23:24.270
What would you hope people would take from those lectures that they only

2576
02:23:24.271 --> 02:23:26.180
remembered two or three things?
Is there,

2577
02:23:26.181 --> 02:23:29.760
are there any core critical takeaways you would help them?

2578
02:23:29.761 --> 02:23:33.360
So money's not arbitrary.
If you look at the history,
origin of the money,

2579
02:23:33.361 --> 02:23:34.500
you see all sorts of different things,

2580
02:23:34.501 --> 02:23:36.840
textiles and Yap stones and this and that and so forth.

2581
02:23:37.200 --> 02:23:42.090
But indeed is not arbitrary.
Um,
they're very consistent.
Um,

2582
02:23:42.120 --> 02:23:46.500
things like unfortunately costliness the demand for scarce supply and the

2583
02:23:46.501 --> 02:23:50.820
durability,
people choosing durable objects.
Um,
so that,

2584
02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:56.000
that sort of realizing that by reading that is partly of what helped me figure

2585
02:23:56.791 --> 02:24:00.060
it out.
Yeah.
You could do this in cyberspace as well.
Um,

2586
02:24:00.120 --> 02:24:04.080
so what does in your,
in your life,
what does money buy you?

2587
02:24:04.620 --> 02:24:07.450
I know it may sound like an odd question in my life and yeah,

2588
02:24:08.390 --> 02:24:13.010
I'm not as much as one would have thought cause I,

2589
02:24:13.011 --> 02:24:15.630
I find myself,

2590
02:24:16.110 --> 02:24:19.410
I'm consuming time to do things that I,
I would,

2591
02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:21.180
I would like to substitute money for,

2592
02:24:21.181 --> 02:24:25.780
but can't I have to take the time to do them anyway.
So what,

2593
02:24:25.910 --> 02:24:28.260
what drives you to write as much as you do?
Well,

2594
02:24:28.261 --> 02:24:32.050
partly that's what I want to do it in life.
So you enjoy the process of,

2595
02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:34.560
I like the freedom of thought and stuff.

2596
02:24:34.590 --> 02:24:39.000
And so I'd much rather sit at home thinking of my own stuff and then,
you know,

2597
02:24:39.001 --> 02:24:41.470
thinking what my boss wants me to think.
Right.

2598
02:24:42.930 --> 02:24:45.300
What are things you'd like to write about that you haven't had a chance to

2599
02:24:45.301 --> 02:24:49.100
explore yet or that you have on deck?
Um,

2600
02:24:49.110 --> 02:24:51.970
so I've written some things about,
um,

2601
02:24:52.110 --> 02:24:55.320
the industrial revolution that I have some meetings,
thoughts on,

2602
02:24:55.321 --> 02:24:58.830
but I'm so busy with other things I'll probably never get to.
Um,

2603
02:24:58.831 --> 02:25:01.710
and on what I call the exploration explosion,
how,

2604
02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:04.890
how Europeans were able to go around the globe and,

2605
02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:08.850
and a takeover in the world's trade routes and so forth,
you know,
after Columbus.

2606
02:25:09.720 --> 02:25:13.440
So there's all sorts of those,
those are two of my favorites,
but there's,

2607
02:25:13.500 --> 02:25:16.890
there's plenty of others as well.
Never have time to do.
Can you,

2608
02:25:16.920 --> 02:25:21.920
can you give any teaser snippets or concepts from the industrial revolution?

2609
02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.130
Well,
I don't,
I don't know if this made it on the recording,

2610
02:25:26.131 --> 02:25:28.980
but the hourglass as mentioned earlier,
is an underrated intervention.

2611
02:25:28.981 --> 02:25:31.470
This humble glass thing with sand in it.

2612
02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:36.180
So Europe invented like the mechanical clock and which I think most of you will

2613
02:25:36.181 --> 02:25:39.240
recognize it as an important invention,
but they also at the same time,

2614
02:25:39.241 --> 02:25:42.230
and not coincidentally that had happened at the same time,
um,

2615
02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:45.780
they invented the hourglass and the hourglass keeps,
you know,

2616
02:25:45.781 --> 02:25:49.290
time between one hour and another and then the,
the clock,

2617
02:25:49.291 --> 02:25:52.080
which at the beginning it was only in the bell tower,
you know,

2618
02:25:52.140 --> 02:25:54.300
chimes the hour for the,
the whole city.

2619
02:25:55.020 --> 02:25:58.620
And so it's the hourglass that people would time their,
you know,

2620
02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:03.690
their activities with and so forth and professors would time their lectures and

2621
02:26:04.140 --> 02:26:06.990
people would,
um,
you know,
agree to meet at certain times.

2622
02:26:06.991 --> 02:26:10.590
And just that temporal coordination was happening quite a bit more in Europe

2623
02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:12.030
than,
than anywhere else.

2624
02:26:12.420 --> 02:26:16.080
And they also turn it into a navigational technique called the dead reckoning,

2625
02:26:16.081 --> 02:26:19.770
where you would,
you would look at,
you're not slipping through the water,

2626
02:26:19.771 --> 02:26:21.960
and then you'd use the hourglass to measure the time.

2627
02:26:22.770 --> 02:26:27.770
And then you would also use that hourglass to record the time record when you

2628
02:26:28.341 --> 02:26:29.180
made the measurement.

2629
02:26:29.630 --> 02:26:33.200
And so you'd keep track just dead reckoning of how far you're going.

2630
02:26:33.201 --> 02:26:36.290
And that's a technique Columbus used and Magellan used and so forth.

2631
02:26:36.770 --> 02:26:41.770
So that hourglass we've used and all that stuff and underappreciated under

2632
02:26:41.931 --> 02:26:42.400
appreciate it.

2633
02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:45.140
<v 4>Yeah.
And there's some poor guy's job.
It was to flip it every hour.</v>

2634
02:26:45.141 --> 02:26:46.220
Exactly on the hour.

2635
02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:49.370
<v 5>If you had,</v>

2636
02:26:49.690 --> 02:26:53.390
<v 6>uh,
a gigantic billboard could put anything on it,
just a,</v>

2637
02:26:53.391 --> 02:26:55.220
a message to get out too.

2638
02:26:55.370 --> 02:26:58.340
<v 5>Millions of people are more,
what would you potentially put on that?</v>

2639
02:26:58.730 --> 02:27:01.610
Does anything come to mind?
Gigantic billboard.
Well,
um,

2640
02:27:01.730 --> 02:27:05.960
the phrasing of all quoted me earlier,
trusted third parties are security holes.

2641
02:27:06.590 --> 02:27:09.800
Anybody in the blockchain space?
I would,
I would like to get that in their head.

2642
02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:12.980
That that's basically the key to the whole design,

2643
02:27:12.981 --> 02:27:14.990
why the whole design is like it is and so forth.

2644
02:27:15.410 --> 02:27:18.120
<v 6>Nivalis do you have any other questions before I wrap up with a few?</v>

2645
02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:22.700
<v 4>No.
I mean I,
I would just really encourage people to go read Nick's blog.</v>

2646
02:27:22.701 --> 02:27:26.860
He is a true polymath.
He's written about stuff.
Um,

2647
02:27:26.990 --> 02:27:30.820
as he mentioned,
ranging from the hourglasses and clocks,

2648
02:27:30.821 --> 02:27:35.821
the industrial revolution to blockchains to law and policy and privacy and

2649
02:27:36.891 --> 02:27:40.310
rights and singularity and freedoms.
And,
um,
it,
I,

2650
02:27:40.410 --> 02:27:42.980
I just learned something every time I go to his blog is I've probably not

2651
02:27:42.981 --> 02:27:45.280
finished about half the pieces on there.
Um,

2652
02:27:45.340 --> 02:27:48.440
and they're always a highly inspirational educational.

2653
02:27:49.070 --> 02:27:52.830
<v 6>Yeah.
People often ask me,
listeners,
ask,
uh,</v>

2654
02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:57.300
be a question related to the maxim that you hear in Silicon Valley a lot,

2655
02:27:57.301 --> 02:27:59.730
which is you're the average of the five people that you associate with most.

2656
02:28:00.210 --> 02:28:04.170
What do I do if I don't have access to five people?
I want to be the average of,

2657
02:28:04.171 --> 02:28:06.240
and the answer or one of the answers is read,

2658
02:28:06.570 --> 02:28:09.330
choose your reading sources very wisely.
And I would agree.

2659
02:28:09.331 --> 02:28:12.120
The depth and breadth of what you cover is really,
really stunning.

2660
02:28:13.630 --> 02:28:16.410
<v 4>My smartest,
uh,
teachers,
mentors,</v>

2661
02:28:16.500 --> 02:28:21.190
peers these days are all on Twitter and logs and they're,
is,

2662
02:28:21.250 --> 02:28:25.250
they're mostly autodidacts.
Like they might have a,
they're self taught,
right?

2663
02:28:25.251 --> 02:28:30.140
Fancy word,
but they might have a,
um,
degrees and whatever,

2664
02:28:30.170 --> 02:28:33.020
but reality.
But the reality is they're curious people.

2665
02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:37.220
And the Internet is the myth of the library of Alexandria writ large.

2666
02:28:37.250 --> 02:28:40.070
Like you can find anything and everything.
You can become an expert in anything.

2667
02:28:40.071 --> 02:28:42.170
You can talk to anybody.
Um,

2668
02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:45.140
so I used to feel guilty about spending so much time on the Internet,

2669
02:28:45.141 --> 02:28:45.890
but now I don't,

2670
02:28:45.890 --> 02:28:49.280
as long as I'm reading interesting things from the people that I think are

2671
02:28:49.281 --> 02:28:50.630
really smart.
What's the downside?

2672
02:28:52.590 --> 02:28:56.610
<v 6>Agreed on Twitter.
Where can people say hello?
What is your Twitter?</v>

2673
02:28:56.820 --> 02:29:01.090
My Twitter handle is at Nick Savo for okay.

2674
02:29:01.091 --> 02:29:03.210
And that's nic k.
Hmm.

2675
02:29:03.630 --> 02:29:04.530
<v 7>S Z.</v>

2676
02:29:04.770 --> 02:29:04.980
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2677
02:29:04.980 --> 02:29:09.210
<v 6>Yes.
Abo the number four.
Number four.
Yeah.
Very cool.</v>

2678
02:29:09.300 --> 02:29:14.130
Well that I think about covers it for a first gathering,

2679
02:29:15.450 --> 02:29:17.600
that cousin of all.
And uh,

2680
02:29:17.610 --> 02:29:22.310
you can get a 25% discount on novel coin if you go to tim.blog for us to no,

2681
02:29:22.311 --> 02:29:26.550
I'm kidding.
Uh,
that is,
that is,
hence sizes are going up.
Prices are going up.

2682
02:29:26.610 --> 02:29:30.520
Oh wait,
that's not all.
We'll have hopefully more for you guys soon.

2683
02:29:30.540 --> 02:29:33.740
This was a real blast.
Thanks so much for the time,
nick.
Thank you.

2684
02:29:33.810 --> 02:29:37.300
This is really fun.
And the vol.
Always a pleasure.

2685

we will have show notes,

2687
02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:48.430

Nick's blog books,

2688
02:29:48.730 --> 02:29:51.850
as many resources as we can think of.
Probably cryptocurrency,

2689
02:29:51.851 --> 02:29:56.020
one o one a handful of articles we'll recommend in sequence as well in the show

2690
02:29:56.021 --> 02:29:56.381

2693
02:30:06.750 --> 02:30:10.590
<v 7>As always,
thank you for listening.
Hey guys,
this is Tim again.</v>

2694
02:30:10.591 --> 02:30:13.770
Just a few more things before you take off.
Number one,

2695
02:30:14.010 --> 02:30:18.960
this is five bullet Friday.
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2696
02:30:18.990 --> 02:30:21.600
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday?

2697
02:30:21.900 --> 02:30:26.130
That provides a little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet

2698
02:30:26.131 --> 02:30:30.750
Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that

2699
02:30:30.751 --> 02:30:32.340
I've been pondering over the week.

2700
02:30:32.550 --> 02:30:35.310
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

2701
02:30:35.311 --> 02:30:38.790
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2702
02:30:38.791 --> 02:30:43.080
somehow dug up in the,
uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

2703
02:30:43.380 --> 02:30:48.380
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

2704
02:30:49.051 --> 02:30:51.780
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

2705
02:30:51.870 --> 02:30:56.850
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

2706
02:30:56.880 --> 02:30:59.040
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

2707

Just go to four hour work week.com that's four hour work week.com all spelled

2708

2709

I hope you enjoy it.

2710
02:31:09.750 --> 02:31:13.680
This episode is brought to you by audible,
which I've used for many,
many years.

2711
02:31:13.740 --> 02:31:18.390
I absolutely love audio books and they are one of my favorite ways to pass the

2712
02:31:18.391 --> 02:31:20.580
time when I,
I'm on the road all the time.

2713
02:31:20.920 --> 02:31:25.560
And audible allows me to consume many more books than I possibly could otherwise

2714
02:31:25.740 --> 02:31:28.290
I have to audio books to recommend right off the bat.

2715
02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:31.290
The first is perhaps my favorite audio book of all time.

2716
02:31:31.291 --> 02:31:34.530
It's the only audiobook I've wanted to listen to twice in a row.

2717
02:31:35.010 --> 02:31:39.120
The graveyard book by Neil Gaiman.
It's amazing and you will thank me.

2718
02:31:39.600 --> 02:31:41.040
There are a few different versions.

2719
02:31:41.310 --> 02:31:44.130
I like the version that Neil narrates himself,

2720
02:31:44.550 --> 02:31:46.590
one of the most soothing voices of all time.

2721
02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:51.300
The second book is vagabonding by Rolf Hots,
p,
O,
t t,

2722
02:31:51.360 --> 02:31:55.020
s which had a huge impact on my life and formed the basis for a lot of what

2723
02:31:55.021 --> 02:31:57.240
would later become the four hour workweek,

2724
02:31:57.600 --> 02:32:02.130

This episode is brought to you by fresh books,
man.
Oh Man.

2734
02:32:32.701 --> 02:32:37.200
Do a lot of listeners of this podcast and readers in mind love fresh books to

2735
02:32:37.201 --> 02:32:40.860
the extent that I ended up meeting with the CEO not very long ago.

2736
02:32:41.370 --> 02:32:43.020
Why are they so popular?
Well,

2737
02:32:43.140 --> 02:32:47.210
they are the number one cloud accounting software designed exclusively for self

2738
02:32:47.211 --> 02:32:48.570
employed professionals.

2739
02:32:48.600 --> 02:32:51.330
That's many of you and used by more than 10 million people.

2740
02:32:51.331 --> 02:32:55.350
You can send invoices,
track your time and get paid very,
very quickly,

2741
02:32:55.500 --> 02:32:59.940
which suits the needs of a lot of freelancers.
I left the [inaudible] and beyond.

2742
02:33:00.480 --> 02:33:02.190
You can't take pictures of receipts.

2743
02:33:02.191 --> 02:33:03.660
You can link your credit card and debit card.

2744
02:33:03.661 --> 02:33:08.640
So all the things you buy automatically appear in your fresh books in the right

2745
02:33:08.641 --> 02:33:12.240
category,
so on and so forth.
Makes taxes easy,
makes invoices easy,

2746
02:33:12.241 --> 02:33:16.980
it makes your life easier.
And also in fact,
I recommend a pdf.

2747
02:33:17.090 --> 02:33:18.870
Uh,
they didn't ask me to read this part by the way.

2748
02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:23.700
They put together a pdf a while back called breaking the time barrier.
Subtitle,

2749
02:33:23.701 --> 02:33:26.730
how to unlock your true earning potential so you can search for breaking the

2750
02:33:26.731 --> 02:33:28.980
time barrier.
A lot of people ask me,

2751
02:33:29.670 --> 02:33:32.490
how can I get a four hour work week with a service business?

2752
02:33:32.670 --> 02:33:37.200
And the story in that Ebook,
it's pdf is the short answer is really,
really good.

2753
02:33:37.230 --> 02:33:39.960
So I think you should also check that out.
