00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.850
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:06.170
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.560
I'm a cybernetic organism.

4
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.420
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by 99 designs.com which is the largest online</v>

5
00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:34.421
marketplace for graphic design with more than 850,000 registered designers from

6
00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:36.980
all over the world who compete for your business.

7
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.420
I've used them for years and I've used them for some very big projects like the

8
00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:43.520
book cover for the four hour body,

9
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:46.100
which went on to becoming number one New York Times Bestseller,

10
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.280
translated into at least I would say 10 1520 languages and I used 99 designs

11
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.010
because I needed results and I needed them very quickly.
So here's how it works.

12
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.240
You need a logo,
a website,
book cover,
tee shirt,
car APP,
whatever.

13
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.480
You put a description on 99 designs.com then people submit designs and in a week

14
00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:13.250
or less you have an original design that you love or you get 100% of your money

15
00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:17.830
back.
So check out 99 designs.com forward slash.
Tim,

16
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.320
you can see some of the projects that I've done personally and you can also get

17
00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:24.830

18
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.520
listing it with a prominent background,
bumping it to the top of the page.

19
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.110
And on average this will attract close to 200% more designs.

20
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.550
So check out 99 designs.com forward slash Tim and I think you'll like what you

21
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:41.150
see.
This episode has two amazing guests,

22
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.430
Tony Robbins and Peter Diamandis,

23
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.570
and we're going to talk principally about how to think big,

24
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.790
what is involved in thinking big,

25
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.820
really 10 x 20 x saying what you're trying to do and siphoning down the bio's of

26
00:01:56.691 --> 00:01:59.900
these two gents was very,
very challenging.
Uh,

27
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.400
both of them make me look like a real lazy bastard who hasn't done anything with

28
00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:08.630
his life,
which is inspiring to me.
So there are different ways to take it,

29
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.720
but let's get started.
Tony Robbins,
for those of you who don't know,

30
00:02:11.721 --> 00:02:15.320
he's often called a motivational speaker and I think that's a total misnomer

31
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.840
because he is really a peak performance strategist and his clientele is really

32
00:02:21.321 --> 00:02:25.490
astonishing.
He has consulted or advised people,
including Nelson Mandela,

33
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.230
Mikhail Gorbachev,
Margaret Thatcher,
Princess Di Mother Teresa.

34
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.090
He's consulted members of two royal families,
members of us,
Congress,
the US army,

35
00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:36.020
US marines,

36
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.680
three US presidents including Bill Clinton and some of his other celebrity

37
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:43.790
clients include Serena Williams,
Andre Agassi,
golf legend,
Greg Norman,

38
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.750
Leonardo Dicaprio.
The list goes on and on and on.
Uh,

39
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.520
he's been named by Accenture,

40
00:02:49.521 --> 00:02:53.390
one of the top 50 business intellectuals in the world by Harvard business press

41
00:02:53.391 --> 00:02:56.720
is one of the top 100 business gurus by American Express,

42
00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:59.950
one of the top six business leaders in the world.
And,

43
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.700
and I should say certainly last but not least,

44
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:08.170
he is the creator of a product that many of you may have seen around,

45
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.310
which is the number one personal and professional development system of all time

46
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:13.540
called personal power.

47
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.010
I have quite a background with this program and in a future episode,
Tony,

48
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:19.150
and I'll be talking a lot about it,

49
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:24.151
but personal power has sold more than 40 million audiotapes and CD copies

50
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.410
worldwide.
Uh,

51
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.420
he himself has also developed and produced five award winning television

52
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:35.170
infomercials.
And here's the stat that might blow your mind.

53
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.400
They have been continuously aired on average every 30 minutes,

54
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:41.020
24 hours a day,

55
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.880
somewhere in North America since April,
1989.
Okay.

56
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:50.080
So for more than 20 years,
I guess,
25 years,

57
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.840
every 30 minutes,
24 hours a day.

58
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.050
A Tony Robbins infomercial has been on television in North America.

59
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.140
It's amazing and that is just a small fraction of his bio.

60
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.380
But I don't want to cut Peter Short.

61
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.610
Peter Diamandis or I should say doctor Peter Diamandis has been named one of the

62
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:11.611
top the world's 50 greatest leaders by Fortune magazine in the world of

63
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:15.640
innovation.
Uh,
Diamandis is chairman and CEO of the x Prize Foundation,

64
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:20.050
best known for its $10 million Ansari x prize for private space flight.

65
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.460
The x prize is really intended to lead the world in designing and operating

66
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.370
large scale global competitions to solve what,
uh,

67
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.920
Peter might call market failures.

68
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.360
He's also the co founder and Vice Chairman of Human Longevity Inc uh,

69
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.380
genomics and cell therapy based diagnostic and therapeutic company focused on

70
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:42.970
extending the healthy human lifespan.
Uh,
it goes on.

71
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.660
He is the Co founder and EXEC chairman of Singularity University.

72
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.470
I've actually spent time there as adjunct faculty basically in the

73
00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:54.190
entrepreneurship track.
This is based at Nasa Ames Center.

74
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.240
It's a graduate level Silicon Valley institution studies exponentially growing

75
00:04:58.241 --> 00:04:59.080
technologies,

76
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.890
their ability to transform industries and solve humanity's grand challenges.

77
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.971
Ray Kurzweil,

78
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:08.590
some of you may know also very involved with that and in the field of commercial

79
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:13.330
space,
Diamandis is the co founder and Co Chairman of Planetary Planetary.

80
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.150
I need more caffeine,
planetary resources,

81
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.000
a company designing spacecraft.

82
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.080
Check this out to enable the detection and mining of asteroids for precious

83
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.350
materials.
These two guys are amazing.

84
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.900
I think you'll really enjoy this conversation.

85
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.710
And often what holds us back is not lack of resources.

86
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.340
It's not lack of tools necessarily,

87
00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:39.820
it's lack of ambition.
We don't have dreams,

88
00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:44.821
aspirations that are big enough to really catapult us to the next level of

89
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.350
thinking,
strategy,
operation,
and so on.
Execution for that matter.

90
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.410
So I wanted to bring these two guys on and talk about how on earth they got to

91
00:05:56.141 --> 00:06:00.630
be where they today in terms of just magnitude of impact and,
and,

92
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.120
and sheer sort of force of will.
So I hope you enjoy it.
Without further ado,

93
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.910
please meet Tony and Peter.
Little Ladies and gentlemen,

94
00:06:08.911 --> 00:06:12.450
this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

95
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.810
I'm very excited to have two of my friends on the line,

96
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.170
Peter Diamandis and Tony Robbins.
Gentlemen,
how are you?
Great.
Are you,

97
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.440
I'm very well I know that you're both very busy and uh,

98
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.950
I will want to dive into quite a few different subjects.

99
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.970
So right off the Bat I think that uh,
the,
the topic,

100
00:06:32.971 --> 00:06:36.210
the general topics and I think there are two intertwined that I'd love to

101
00:06:36.211 --> 00:06:40.470
explore in this conversation are number one,
I think,
uh,

102
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.590
an aspect of your psychology is the both of you very well known for.

103
00:06:43.591 --> 00:06:46.410
And that is thinking big.
So I'm going to dive into that.

104
00:06:46.411 --> 00:06:51.411
But how you started thinking big and really big in many cases.

105
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.980
And then secondly,
how you learn and how you have learned.

106
00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.960
And so I thought a very perhaps tactical way to start off and just jump into it

107
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.240
would be asking you each and maybe,
uh,
Peter,
we could start with you.

108
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:06.871
Uh,

109
00:07:06.871 --> 00:07:11.790
what book or books you've gifted to other people the most outside of your own?

110
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.340
<v 2>Uh,
sure.
Uh,</v>

111
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.570
there's actually a few books that have changed my world that I've gifted a,

112
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.960
the first is reading the spirit of Saint Louis,
buy Lindbergh.
And you know,

113
00:07:22.961 --> 00:07:27.961
the setting is his story of this epic adventure in 1927 of crossing the Atlantic

114
00:07:29.111 --> 00:07:33.110
and doing it for $25,000 prize.
And I was amazed at this man,

115
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:37.450
his determination and the way he thought about this and took the risk out and

116
00:07:37.451 --> 00:07:40.270
then made this epic journey.
So that's one.

117
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.140
I love atlas shrugged by ign rand.
It's uh,

118
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:47.860
something I've read multiple times to sort of get me in the mindset of not

119
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.840
letting anything stand in my way and really driven by passion,

120
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.040
which I know is nothing.
Something that Tony knows nothing about it.

121
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.120
<v 1>Yeah,
no,
definitely kits.
Sorry to interrupt.
Please continue.</v>

122
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.870
<v 2>No,
no.
There are two others that have been sort of man who sold the moon,</v>

123
00:08:04.871 --> 00:08:06.880
which is a science fiction book by Robert Heinlein.

124
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:11.620
It talks about how this guy dd Herrmann commercializes the moon and it's just a

125
00:08:11.621 --> 00:08:15.580
brilliant 50 year old vision that's as relevant today.

126
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.580
And then,
uh,
uh,

127
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.390
a book by my good friend Ray Kurzwell called the singularity is near,

128
00:08:22.391 --> 00:08:23.850
which was the,

129
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.730
the basis for the foundation of singularity university.

130
00:08:27.731 --> 00:08:32.080
And it's funny cause all of these books,
each of them and in turn,
uh,

131
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.770
we're so purposeful to me.
They,

132
00:08:34.771 --> 00:08:38.430
they were the drivers for me starting many of my companies.

133
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.650
<v 1>Awesome.
That's it.
That's a,
I'm going to go pick up all of this.</v>

134
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:45.410
This is a side note for folks Heinlein,
uh,

135
00:08:45.411 --> 00:08:47.150
for those of you who use the word Grok,

136
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.320
Grok this grok that that is from stranger in a strange land.

137
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.680
Also by Heinlein.
A lot of techies don't realize the origins of that word.
Uh,

138
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.730
<v 3>Tony,
I'd love to love to hear your,
your selection.</v>

139
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.920
I was,
it tends what people really want over the years.

140
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:08.820
Probably the most common books I've recommended to us as a man thinketh by James

141
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.540
Allen because,
uh,
when you think about the quality of people's lives,

142
00:09:12.541 --> 00:09:14.010
it starts with the what?

143
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:18.060
Meaning we give things to people could have the same exact experience and one

144
00:09:18.061 --> 00:09:21.060
person thinks it's over and one person thinks the game has begun.

145
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.360
And that is the difference that makes the difference in the quality of people's

146
00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:27.630
lives.
It's not what happens to them as we all know.
Uh,
and the other one,

147
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.840
which is along the same theme that I've probably given out as well,

148
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:32.550
I give that as them,
I think it's good to a small book.

149
00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:36.930
It's a book that people can read over and over again and get great value out of

150
00:09:36.931 --> 00:09:37.651
it.
But man,

151
00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:41.220
search for meaning by Viktor Frankl to me is just one of the greatest books ever

152
00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:44.370
written.
Um,
because we all in our lives.

153
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:46.500
The one thing that's in common for all human beings,

154
00:09:46.501 --> 00:09:50.490
regardless of your background or your economic position,
good,
bad,
or indifferent.

155
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.640
We're all gonna experience extreme stress in our life.
At some point,

156
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.490
everyone's going to have to face the loss of a loved one.

157
00:09:56.491 --> 00:10:00.060
Everyone's got the face of the loss of a job or an opportunity or a government

158
00:10:00.061 --> 00:10:04.560
change in policy that affects your business or some health issue yourself,

159
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:09.630
uh,
or robbery or the loss of your home burglary burning down.
I mean,

160
00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:11.370
all these horrible things in your lifetime,

161
00:10:11.371 --> 00:10:16.170
you're going to experience and to be able to learn from someone who experienced

162
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.530
the Holocaust directly who normally experienced the holocaust,

163
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:20.580
but walked through.

164
00:10:20.581 --> 00:10:23.310
What was the difference between those who made it and those who didn't?

165
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:27.600
And as most of us who've read the book,
No,
it wasn't the strongest that survives.

166
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.900
It was those that had a higher meaning for their pain.

167
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:35.040
Those that found a way to even take suffering and transform it into a meaningful

168
00:10:35.041 --> 00:10:36.660
experience.
Know,
most people today,

169
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:39.630
we live in a society where people think happiness is what life's about.

170
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:43.110
But you can get bored being happy.
Some people,
you know,
they're so damn happy,

171
00:10:43.111 --> 00:10:46.050
they create a problem just to have variety in their life because we have lots of

172
00:10:46.051 --> 00:10:49.330
needs as human beings and they make a problems.
They don't even have.
I did well,

173
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.450
extremely wealthy clients and you should,
you know,

174
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.670
some people hear their problem to go,
yeah,
I'd love to have those problems.

175
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.440
So meaning is what really matters and to,

176
00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:01.520
to witness to go through the experience and an associated way and see how this

177
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:05.220
man not only transformed his own life but then came back to help.

178
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.440
So many others I think is one of the more invaluable components.

179
00:11:07.441 --> 00:11:11.400
But another book would be the fourth turning because I also believe you have to

180
00:11:11.401 --> 00:11:12.930
understand that life has seasons.

181
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:16.110
And the fourth turning is written by two brilliant men who actually to an

182
00:11:16.111 --> 00:11:16.944
original book that,

183
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.310
and Clinton gave me when I worked with them 20 years ago called generations,

184
00:11:20.311 --> 00:11:23.030
which goes through,
you know,
a hundred years of jabs,

185
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:28.460
generations and walks through how basically we adapt to the way we've been

186
00:11:28.471 --> 00:11:32.010
brought up and bring up our children differently and how that crepes gross

187
00:11:32.011 --> 00:11:33.510
patterns that affect history.

188
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.170
How about the fourth turning is just an incredibly in depth experience that

189
00:11:37.171 --> 00:11:41.970
shows you that human beings go for periods of time,
10,
15,
20 years,

190
00:11:41.971 --> 00:11:43.890
usually from 10 to 15 year range of the stage.

191
00:11:43.891 --> 00:11:47.100
We are now where we have a primary set of emotions.

192
00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:50.790
There are winters where people will tend to find what's wrong.

193
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:54.160
There's the springtime of possibility,
there's the hot summer,

194
00:11:54.161 --> 00:11:56.440
and of course there's the fall where the rewards are very,

195
00:11:56.441 --> 00:12:00.070
very simple and you can tie these economics,
you can tie them to emotions.
Um,

196
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.760
and it's just an extraordinary book to put your life in perspective.

197
00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:07.600
And so you learn,
you know,
some people freak out in the winter,
you know,

198
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:09.470
other people,
you know,
some people freeze that out,

199
00:12:09.471 --> 00:12:13.330
some people ski and snowboard part and how to take advantage of whatever season

200
00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:16.090
of life you're in and how to utilize that 10 anticipate in your business and

201
00:12:16.091 --> 00:12:16.780
your life.

202
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.510
I find that the unvaluable but it depends on what somebody's looking for.

203
00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:24.050
I just recommended slow sex to somebody yesterday who desperately needed it and

204
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.750
you're cold,
you know,
and,
and another person,

205
00:12:25.751 --> 00:12:27.310
I was watching them deal with their kid and I said,

206
00:12:27.311 --> 00:12:30.340
you've got to go pick up mindset by the Stanford University cause you're keep

207
00:12:30.341 --> 00:12:34.000
telling your kid how perfect they are and you're going to ruin them because

208
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.010
telling a kid that they're perfect crates,

209
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:41.011
a frame of reference where they have to be a certain way as opposed to giving

210
00:12:41.651 --> 00:12:43.750
them the feedback because they put out the effort,

211
00:12:43.751 --> 00:12:47.230
effort they can control who you are is a whole different component.

212
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:51.190
So I'm always honestly seeing what's needed for that individual now.

213
00:12:51.191 --> 00:12:54.670
But if I'm going universal,
I think it's understanding the seasons of life.

214
00:12:54.671 --> 00:12:55.331
It's understanding,

215
00:12:55.331 --> 00:12:58.720
creating meaning and it's understanding how your thoughts have the ultimate

216
00:12:58.721 --> 00:12:59.620
control of your life.

217
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:04.720
<v 1>No,
I agree.
And uh,
the,
I think for,
for those people,</v>

218
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:09.160
curious to dig into also the,
the parenting aspect event you mentioned,

219
00:13:09.161 --> 00:13:12.800
I think that brain a brain rules,
uh,
and the author,

220
00:13:12.801 --> 00:13:17.250
I think his name is a professor Medina out of Washington also underscores that

221
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.110
as does Josh Waitzkin actually who I interviewed on this podcast,

222
00:13:20.111 --> 00:13:22.120
who was the basis for searching for Bobby Fischer.

223
00:13:22.121 --> 00:13:23.260
And you talked about the same thing.

224
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.390
How emphasizing sort of effort over attributes is,

225
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:32.080
is and continues to be increasingly important in raising children.
The,

226
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.003
the,

227
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:38.670
the s was sort of macro level aspect of both of you that that jumps out most

228
00:13:39.341 --> 00:13:42.940
immediately to a lot of people.
It's just the sheer scale of what you do.

229
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:48.040
And uh,
so Tony for instance,
I mean,
how many,

230
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:52.360
how many people are you going to be feeding a or are you aiming to feed?

231
00:13:52.361 --> 00:13:53.800
And in 2015,

232
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.350
<v 3>three years,
it started out with,
when I was 11,
somebody fed my family.</v>

233
00:13:59.351 --> 00:14:00.220
I don't even know it was.

234
00:14:00.221 --> 00:14:04.290
I just met the man at the door who delivered the food and it radically changed

235
00:14:04.291 --> 00:14:08.040
my life,
cause it,
the meaning I took out of it was at strangers care.

236
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.690
If strangers cared about my family,

237
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.590
then regardless of my father told me I was going to care at a different level.

238
00:14:13.591 --> 00:14:16.950
It changed my entire life.
So I said,
you know,
when this happened,

239
00:14:16.951 --> 00:14:21.030
I was 11 when I'm 17 was the first time I fed two families and then for the next

240
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.070
year,
then the eight,
and then it was getting a little tough.

241
00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:25.590
So I got some friends involved and then my companies grew.

242
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:29.700
So now from the last 37 years,
I've fed 42 million people,

243
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.050
but I'd feed about 4 million,
2 million people each year through my foundation.

244
00:14:34.051 --> 00:14:37.650
And I do 2 million myself.
I do matching funds for the last five years.
So,

245
00:14:37.651 --> 00:14:40.410
but this year or last year,
I don't know if you saw,

246
00:14:40.411 --> 00:14:44.490
but a lot of people didn't even notice a congress cut food stamps by eight point

247
00:14:44.491 --> 00:14:48.330
$2 billion,
which is the equivalency you understand of the family's there.

248
00:14:48.331 --> 00:14:50.760
Supporting going without food one week out of the month,

249
00:14:50.761 --> 00:14:53.570
just arbitrarily without figuring out how to make up for it.

250
00:14:53.571 --> 00:14:57.320
And I obviously work pretty passionately with all these nonprofits cause I help

251
00:14:57.321 --> 00:15:01.940
support them all and they're being maxed out.
And so I thought,
you know what,

252
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:06.220
I'm writing this book right now and Finances and I'm fortunate to do quite well.

253
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:09.130
What if I took all the money of that and I donated it,
you know,

254
00:15:09.131 --> 00:15:12.060
how many meals can I donate?
And that wasn't enough.
So I said,
well,

255
00:15:12.061 --> 00:15:13.080
I'll write a check above that.

256
00:15:13.081 --> 00:15:16.680
And I thought if I could do as many meals that I've none in my lifetime in a

257
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.960
year,
that'd be a good start.
So I said,
you know,
okay,

258
00:15:18.961 --> 00:15:21.840
I've got to find 42 million meals.
Holy Shit,
that's a large drink of water.

259
00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.840
How bout how bout I do need everything in the book.

260
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:28.290
And I put up a big check and I feed 20 million people this year and I get

261
00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.960
matching donations.
But as I've gone along,

262
00:15:30.961 --> 00:15:34.680
I've gotten more inspired and I've partnered with fat,
um,
feeding America,

263
00:15:34.681 --> 00:15:38.520
which is the largest domestic feeding organization,
that best organization,

264
00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:42.150
and I've negotiated with them to cut out all of the costs and I'm now,

265
00:15:42.151 --> 00:15:42.990
I've raised my game,

266
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.630
I'm like Todd total number and I'm writing a check for and a few weeks,

267
00:15:45.631 --> 00:15:48.360
November 18th is 55 million meals.

268
00:15:48.361 --> 00:15:51.240
I'm personally going to deliver 55 million people and then they're going to

269
00:15:51.241 --> 00:15:54.090
partner with me to get that to 100 million with matching funds.

270
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.430
So I know for sure I'm going to feed 55 million this year.

271
00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.550
That's not counting my foundation or the other work that I do.

272
00:15:59.551 --> 00:16:00.390
So I guess it will be slightly.

273
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:05.400
<v 1>And these numbers to most people are just almost unimaginable.</v>

274
00:16:05.471 --> 00:16:07.690
And so that just does.
Peter,

275
00:16:07.691 --> 00:16:11.260
just due to perhaps catch people up on a couple of examples of the work you've

276
00:16:11.261 --> 00:16:12.780
done with the x prize,

277
00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:17.320
of course you'd done many different things in addition to the x prize.
Uh,

278
00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:17.821
but what are,

279
00:16:17.821 --> 00:16:22.120
what are some of the problems that you're attempting or are tackling or have

280
00:16:22.121 --> 00:16:25.390
tackled with,
with the x prize to date?
And I know we're going to,
certainly,

281
00:16:25.391 --> 00:16:28.540
we all have sort of a secret agenda to talk about one that we're particularly

282
00:16:28.541 --> 00:16:32.020
passionate about right now,
but what are some of the others that you can mention?

283
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.550
<v 2>Sure.
So,
um,</v>

284
00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:38.580
people might know the work we do here for the original Ansari x prize per space

285
00:16:38.911 --> 00:16:43.911
flight modeled after Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic to win a $25,000

286
00:16:44.261 --> 00:16:48.590
prize.
We put up $10 million back in 1996 for the first unit,

287
00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.280
build a spaceship and carry three adults up into space and back.

288
00:16:51.281 --> 00:16:56.281
And the relevance here is that individuals today can do extraordinary things and

289
00:16:57.041 --> 00:16:59.110
you need to give them guidance.
You know,
without a target,

290
00:16:59.111 --> 00:17:02.080
you'll miss it every time.
And if you incentivize them,

291
00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:06.310
you can get entrepreneurs from any place,
any walk of life independent,

292
00:17:06.311 --> 00:17:09.250
what they've done before to do extraordinary things when I fundamentally believe

293
00:17:09.251 --> 00:17:10.300
that.
So the question is,

294
00:17:10.301 --> 00:17:12.340
can you point entrepreneurs at the world's biggest problems?

295
00:17:12.341 --> 00:17:15.550
The grand challenges and that's where we're doing.
And um,

296
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:19.030
and oceans and health and learning and energy.

297
00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.720
One of the prizes I think that's relevant that we're in the midst of right now

298
00:17:22.721 --> 00:17:25.660
is called the Qualcomm tricorder x prize.

299
00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:30.160
So anybody who's a fellow Trekkie,
I knows a star trek,

300
00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.780
know Dr. McCoy bones would have this device called the tri quarter.

301
00:17:33.781 --> 00:17:36.570
He'd pointed it at somebody and be able to tell if they're bright Gillian fever

302
00:17:36.571 --> 00:17:40.110
or if they're an alien or whatever the case might be.
And is sort of the,

303
00:17:40.111 --> 00:17:44.330
the vision of where we're going.
So we partnered with Qualcomm,
Paul Jacobs,

304
00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:47.500
who the chairman there,
or they put up $20 million,
uh,

305
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.120
and we have teams around the world to build a handheld mobile device,

306
00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.560
a nonproductive for nurse.

307
00:17:54.561 --> 00:17:57.070
It's for a mom or dad at two in the morning when their kid is sick.

308
00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.090
And this is a device you can talk to.
It's got AI,

309
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.420
artificial intelligence on the cloud.
You can cough on it.

310
00:18:03.421 --> 00:18:07.530
It can do the RNA and DNA analysis of the bacteria in your,
in your sputum.

311
00:18:07.531 --> 00:18:10.740
You do a blood prick and do your blood chemistries,

312
00:18:10.741 --> 00:18:13.920
it's meant to be able to diagnose you independent of the medical system,

313
00:18:13.921 --> 00:18:17.220
which is so broken right now.
And you know,
the,

314
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:21.840
we had 300 teams entered the competition.
We're down to the top 10.

315
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.600
We'll have a winner in 15 months.
But you know,

316
00:18:24.601 --> 00:18:26.670
people are starting to put doctors and nurses out of business.

317
00:18:26.671 --> 00:18:29.930
And the answer is no,
we've got a problem right now.
There's going to be,

318
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.580
we're going to be short,
um,
uh,

319
00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:36.880
something on the order of 100,000 doctors in the u s alone by 2020.

320
00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.400
And that's great compared to the rest of the world.

321
00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:44.670
Africa has got 25% of the disease burden and 1.3% of the healthcare workers.

322
00:18:44.951 --> 00:18:49.810
We could not scale building hospitals or were physicians fast enough.

323
00:18:49.811 --> 00:18:54.160
So can we use technology to touch the lives of a billion people?

324
00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.280
And um,
so that's,
that's one of them.

325
00:18:57.281 --> 00:19:01.980
The Qualcomm tricorder xprize and way I think about it is imagine technology

326
00:19:01.981 --> 00:19:06.981
that a mass cy warrior in the middle of Kenya today has access to a smartphone

327
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.890
with Google.
They have access to more knowledge and information.

328
00:19:10.891 --> 00:19:14.580
And President Clinton had 20 years ago,
uh,
and they're paying a dollar a day,

329
00:19:14.581 --> 00:19:19.380
this democratization.
Uh,
and this demonetization is where we're heading.

330
00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:24.070
<v 1>And I think what I'd love to ask both of you and,
uh,</v>

331
00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.730
Peter perhaps we could start with you,

332
00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:30.800
is when did you sort of leave this very incremental,

333
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:34.670
linear sinking?
Because for a lot of people,
they hear millions of dollars,

334
00:19:34.671 --> 00:19:36.080
tens of millions of dollars,
and they,

335
00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.920
they immediately respond in their own head with,
I could never do that.

336
00:19:39.921 --> 00:19:44.240
I could never raise that type of money,
make that type of money,

337
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:48.890
have that type of impact.
And when I interviewed Peter Teal on the podcast,

338
00:19:48.891 --> 00:19:50.030
some people may have heard it,

339
00:19:50.031 --> 00:19:53.720
but he's obviously known as a billionaire investor,
first money into Facebook,

340
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.540
cofounder of Palentier.
But back in the day,

341
00:19:56.541 --> 00:19:59.870
he was on a very traditional track to becoming a lawyer.

342
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:05.120
And he ended up not getting a clerk,
a clerkship,
a clerking position.
Uh,

343
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:07.340
and that was sort of the,

344
00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.240
the redirection that sent him into what would later become paypal.

345
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.810
And now of course he poses questions like,

346
00:20:14.811 --> 00:20:17.240
why don't you take your 10 year plan and ask yourself,

347
00:20:17.241 --> 00:20:19.760
why can't I do this in six months?
And it just,

348
00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:24.560
it turns out that sometimes you can actually formulate a plan that works based

349
00:20:24.561 --> 00:20:27.320
on asking better questions,
but you,
for,
for him,

350
00:20:27.321 --> 00:20:31.880
there were a few moments that really shook him or showed him that the

351
00:20:31.881 --> 00:20:35.300
incremental approach was not the only approach.
So,
so Peter,
I'm curious,

352
00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:40.450
at what point did you develop this thinking or who impacted you?

353
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.540
What were the triggers that sort of led you to think this big?

354
00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:50.260
<v 2>Great,
great question.
And uh,
um,
you know,
it was probably,</v>

355
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:54.190
so I grew up passionate about space,
you know,
watching the tail end of Apollo,

356
00:20:54.191 --> 00:20:56.920
drinking all the Tang and got my hands on watching star trek.

357
00:20:56.921 --> 00:20:59.740
And it was driven by this inner purpose and mission and passion.

358
00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:04.860
And I sort of attached that to becoming an astronaut and joining NASA.

359
00:21:05.411 --> 00:21:07.150
And that was my vision of my future.

360
00:21:07.151 --> 00:21:12.151
And as I got closer and closer to meeting astronauts and meeting and seeing what

361
00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:14.130
was really going on behind NASA,

362
00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.280
I realized that it was never going to happen to the government.
And honestly,
uh,

363
00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:21.760
NASA had become so risk adverse of that.

364
00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:26.560
It was massively disappointing and there was this disconnect between my vision

365
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:30.640
of where the world should be and the way it was and the way it was going.

366
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.020
And I had this moment in time where I literally,

367
00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.110
when I was at Grad school at Mit,

368
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:42.010
I did not submit my astral an application and I said,
screw it,

369
00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.250
forget I'm going to take,
I'm going to do this myself.

370
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:48.220
And I made a commitment to myself to work,

371
00:21:48.221 --> 00:21:51.580
to open up the private space frontier on my own,

372
00:21:51.581 --> 00:21:54.970
which is an insane concept to think about.
Well,
when did you,

373
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.720
were you sitting having a cup of coffee and just like looking across the cafe,

374
00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.560
did some,
I mean,
what,
what was,
what was the moment when you were like,
screw it?

375
00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:06.190
I was in,
I was in the man vehicle lab at Mit.

376
00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:10.630
I was doing research on human physiology and I had a bunch of shuttle astronauts

377
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:12.520
in the lab and I was talking to them,

378
00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:16.270
it would Byron Lichtenberg and Oh and Garrett and a number of folks.

379
00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:18.520
And I was listening to their stories of how,

380
00:22:18.521 --> 00:22:22.420
what they had to do to get into NASA and how they had to be a good boy and do

381
00:22:22.421 --> 00:22:26.470
what they were told,
which is not me by any stretch of imagination.
No.
And,
and,

382
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:30.490
and,
and then I was told,
you know,
your chance of being like a one of a thousand,

383
00:22:30.491 --> 00:22:33.220
if you get selected,
maybe you'll fly in if you fly,

384
00:22:33.221 --> 00:22:37.060
you might fly once or twice in your career.
I'm like,
Holy Shit,
that's ridiculous.

385
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.370
I mean it's a not this,
this is bullshit.

386
00:22:39.371 --> 00:22:42.310
This is not my vision of way opening up spaces is going to be.

387
00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:47.290
And it was so antithetical and I had so much energy and emotion tied to this

388
00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:52.450
desire that I literally poured that all into a brand new approach.

389
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:57.210
Um,
which became zero gravity corporation,
x prize space,
adventures,

390
00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.700
planetary resources,
a whole bunch of things.
And we're just beginning.
And,
and I,

391
00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:06.310
I,
I think it is now possible for an entrepreneur to do anything to take on any

392
00:23:06.311 --> 00:23:09.400
grand challenge.
And,
and I think it's,
it's an important message.

393
00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:13.240
You can stop complaining about problems and start solving them.

394
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:17.140
That's what we're living in today.
And is there just to look at,

395
00:23:17.141 --> 00:23:20.520
say the Ansari x prize.
So it's $10 million,
uh,

396
00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:25.000
going from MIT to say the first x prize.
Obviously there,

397
00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:29.530
there were a lot of different steps in between,
but someone,
I just,

398
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.640
I know this may seem like I'm beating a dead horse on this site,
$10 million,

399
00:23:33.641 --> 00:23:36.250
but it's such an unfathomable number for a lot of people.

400
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.060
So I didn't have $10 million right now.
Hope you're going to stare at this.

401
00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:45.040
Walked out with 10 million.
Come on.
Peter told the story.

402
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:50.040
He told me this story is like,
all right,
you're my brother.
All right,
cool.
Yeah,

403
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:54.050
no,
let's,
let's go.
The fact of the matter is,

404
00:23:54.051 --> 00:23:57.390
I read the book,
the spirit of Saint Louis and my good friend Greg Man,

405
00:23:57.391 --> 00:24:00.530
it gives me an,
I hear about it and I go,
hey,
if I can create a prize,

406
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:03.920
maybe that's them.
That's the means.
I get my ass into space.
Right?

407
00:24:03.921 --> 00:24:06.980
And so I start noodling this as I'm reading the book,

408
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:09.440
10 million bucks is enough money,
you know,

409
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:13.640
I'm going to call the x prize because I had no idea who's going to put up a 10

410
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:14.001
million bucks.

411
00:24:14.001 --> 00:24:16.790
He x was going to represent the name of the person who would eventually put up

412
00:24:16.791 --> 00:24:18.920
the money I had to variable to be replaced.

413
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:24.140
So long story short on like scrambling for back then,
you know,
100 bucks here,

414
00:24:24.141 --> 00:24:26.510
1000 bucks,
they're getting the seed money to get this going.

415
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.730
And I ended up in Saint Louis where an amazing man,

416
00:24:31.731 --> 00:24:34.790
Al Kurth said,
I will help you re raise some seed money.

417
00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:38.480
And then he was driven and connected by my passion,
my commitment to this.

418
00:24:38.481 --> 00:24:43.481
And he helped me raise about a half a million dollars in 10 and 20 k checks from

419
00:24:43.911 --> 00:24:46.670
the people and people connect with your passion,

420
00:24:46.671 --> 00:24:51.671
with your heartfelt desire to do something bigger than yourself and they're

421
00:24:52.101 --> 00:24:55.040
willing to back that to some extent.
Long story short,

422
00:24:55.041 --> 00:24:58.400
over the course of a year and a lot of,
you know,
worn out knee pads,

423
00:24:58.401 --> 00:25:03.401
I raised end up raising half a million dollars and then our fundraising stalls

424
00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:09.650
and we make the very bold decision that we're going to announce this $10 million

425
00:25:09.651 --> 00:25:14.620
prize anyway,
but with no money in place.
And uh,
we ended up,
uh,

426
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.210
going out under the arch in St Louis.

427
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.960
And one of the things I teach entrepreneurs,
in fact,

428
00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.310
I write about this in my next book called bold,

429
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:27.920
which is how you announced a big bold idea to the world really matters if you

430
00:25:27.921 --> 00:25:31.220
announce it below a line of credibility.

431
00:25:31.221 --> 00:25:34.520
We all have a line of credibility around ideas.
We judged them constantly.

432
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:38.420
If you announce the below the line of credibility,
people dismiss it out of hand.

433
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.630
And then we had this line of super credibility that if you announce it above the

434
00:25:41.631 --> 00:25:45.080
line of super credibility,
people say,
wow,
when is it going to happen?

435
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.980
How can I be involved?
So for me,
even though I didn't have $10 million,

436
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:53.990
I didn't have any teams.
Uh,
I got on stage to stand by my side,

437
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.820
you know,
20 astronauts from Buzz Aldrin and others,
uh,
the head of NASA,

438
00:25:58.821 --> 00:26:01.400
the head of the Faa,
who had seen me over many years.

439
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.430
And it took a lot of convincing.
I mean,

440
00:26:04.431 --> 00:26:08.510
this is where the even getting to that point was a pinnacle of years of work,

441
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.460
but driven by this commitment.

442
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:15.320
So we announced this prize front page around the world and because I'm

443
00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.990
absolutely,
positively sure I'm going to raise the $10 million,

444
00:26:17.991 --> 00:26:21.380
who wouldn't want to pay 10 million after a pro after a person did it,
right?

445
00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:26.480
You paid only on success challenges 150 CEOs later over the next five years,

446
00:26:29.301 --> 00:26:33.810
between 96 and 2001,
everyone's turning me down.
Um,

447
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:39.050
I finally meet the Ansari family.
There's a lot more detail here,
but listen,

448
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:42.950
the fact of matter is if I,
there were many times at 3:00 AM in the

449
00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.210
<v 1>when,
uh,
okay.</v>

450
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:50.100
I was tempted to give up and it was only because I was being driven by my

451
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.020
internally,
my,
you know,

452
00:26:52.021 --> 00:26:56.440
my own massively transformative purpose that kept me going in.

453
00:26:56.441 --> 00:26:59.340
And we're here today having this conversation because I did not give up.

454
00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:04.070
So I'll leave it up.
Dot.
No,
I love that story.
And I think what's,
what's,

455
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:08.490
what I'd love to underscore it as much for myself as anyone else is that you

456
00:27:08.491 --> 00:27:12.930
also had the public accountability because you'd made that I burn my ships,
dude.

457
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.640
Yeah.
You,
you burn your ships.
So,
uh,
that's a wonderful story.

458
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.823
It's Tony.

459
00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:23.420
I know a lot about your story and of course we're going to have a followup

460
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:26.030
conversation to talk about many other things.
Uh,

461
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:30.870
but I've read all your books,
listen to a lot of your material,

462
00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:35.220
and I know that you weren't always the Tony Robbins said,

463
00:27:35.221 --> 00:27:39.230
people know of today.
I mean,
there was a point where you were sort of,
uh,

464
00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:42.000
well there's a lots of the story of course,
but what were,

465
00:27:42.001 --> 00:27:44.130
what were the triggers for you?
The influences,

466
00:27:44.131 --> 00:27:49.080
the moments where you sort of decided,
okay,
instead of helping an additional,

467
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:49.351
you know,

468
00:27:49.351 --> 00:27:54.030
feeding an additional two people per year or making an additional 10 k per year

469
00:27:54.031 --> 00:27:58.500
or whatever it might be in those sort of increments where you went to really

470
00:27:58.501 --> 00:28:01.620
getting bold as,
uh,
as Peter might say.

471
00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:06.210
<v 3>I think it's driven.
I think it unfolds with time.</v>

472
00:28:06.211 --> 00:28:07.530
There are moments along the way,

473
00:28:07.531 --> 00:28:09.810
but there are inevitable moments that come with growth.

474
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:13.710
And growth only comes if there's something,
as Peter said,

475
00:28:13.711 --> 00:28:15.960
that you're passionate about,
that's larger than yourself.

476
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.530
Cause it's very easy to become satisfied with a certain amount of money,

477
00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:22.410
a certain amount of food at certain amount of sex,
a certain amount of comfort,

478
00:28:22.411 --> 00:28:25.050
a certain amount of anything.
But if you said to me,

479
00:28:25.051 --> 00:28:27.560
what is the difference in people's lives and what's the difference between

480
00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:32.030
heater as I love dearly and the average person,
it's hunger.
It,

481
00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.110
he's an incredibly intelligent man.
You know,

482
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.080
he understates who he is and it's just pure level of intelligence.

483
00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.650
But you truthfully,

484
00:28:38.651 --> 00:28:41.770
I've seen people that have one Tempe intelligence accomplish more because that

485
00:28:41.771 --> 00:28:45.610
hunger is my hunger from the earliest day was the light p up people up.

486
00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:48.220
And I think it's because I was surrounded by so much suffering.

487
00:28:48.221 --> 00:28:52.120
I mean I hate to see people suffer.
I love to light people up.

488
00:28:52.121 --> 00:28:55.470
And I found early that would like people up was answers,

489
00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.240
answers that could change the quality of life immediately where they get

490
00:28:58.241 --> 00:29:01.300
suddenly shift their body and their energy would change,
their body would change.

491
00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:02.950
They could lose 20 or 30 pounds,

492
00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.040
that they could change the relationship and suddenly something was dead,

493
00:29:06.041 --> 00:29:07.690
was fully alive and there was passion.

494
00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:11.470
Cause I don't care who you are and where they can make $10 billion.
And I know,

495
00:29:11.471 --> 00:29:14.710
cause I get the calls from these people that it's not the game.

496
00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.470
The game is your body.
It's your emotions that your relationships,

497
00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:19.390
if everything else in your life was going great,

498
00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.570
and there's an area that isn't in inevitably will bite you because we're

499
00:29:22.571 --> 00:29:25.990
designed as human beings to grow or die.
That's just how it works spiritually,

500
00:29:25.991 --> 00:29:30.700
mentally,
emotionally.
So along the way,
I wanted answers for myself to start with.

501
00:29:30.701 --> 00:29:34.450
I was short,
I was fat,
we were,
I grew up in a very tough environment.

502
00:29:34.451 --> 00:29:37.180
I had four different fathers,
we had no food,
no money.

503
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.740
Those things kind of trigger you.
And,
and as a result,
I didn't,

504
00:29:40.741 --> 00:29:43.420
couldn't answers in my environment.
I didn't have access to anybody.

505
00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:47.650
So for me it was book.
So I'm very passionate about the power of what,

506
00:29:47.651 --> 00:29:50.200
how self learning can transform anybody,

507
00:29:50.201 --> 00:29:52.870
especially in the world we have today where you have access to everything,

508
00:29:52.871 --> 00:29:55.210
literally at your fingertips,
on your phone,
anywhere you go.

509
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:58.750
But I had 700 books in a period.
I thought I was gonna be a book a day.

510
00:29:58.751 --> 00:30:01.630
That was my goal.
I took a speed reading class,
but I didn't do that.

511
00:30:01.631 --> 00:30:05.290
I read 700 bucks over seven years,
but I read anything I could on physiology,

512
00:30:05.291 --> 00:30:06.640
psychology,
emotion,

513
00:30:06.641 --> 00:30:08.950
anything I can make the difference in the quality of people's lives.

514
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:11.940
And then gradually what happened was I started,
you know,

515
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:14.320
going from books to being able to use net time,
no extra time,

516
00:30:14.321 --> 00:30:17.680
I want to listen to things.
I started listening those days to cassette tapes.

517
00:30:17.681 --> 00:30:20.470
That's how old I am.
And as I went through the process,

518
00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:24.010
I then found myself at events and I went to an event that changed my life was

519
00:30:24.011 --> 00:30:26.680
the first real teacher was this man named Jim Roan,

520
00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:29.470
who is a personal development teacher,
was a three hour event.

521
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:34.210
I sat in this room and I watched this man who's just so lel in three hours share

522
00:30:34.211 --> 00:30:37.760
with people principles that I knew would change the quality of my life are
there.

523
00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:39.700
It's,
and I decided to go to work for him because I thought,

524
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:43.240
this is what I want my life to be about,
this guys the best at what he does.

525
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.880
I want to live this stuff.
And so I went to work for him.

526
00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:49.750
And the core essence that I got from being around him was the quality of your

527
00:30:49.751 --> 00:30:54.190
life is really comes down to your capacity to add value that in life,

528
00:30:54.191 --> 00:30:56.980
the only thing that makes you feel fully alive as growing and giving.

529
00:30:57.370 --> 00:31:01.780
And that evolves my language of it.
I,
that's what I pulled by being around him.

530
00:31:01.781 --> 00:31:03.070
Not so much by what he said,

531
00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.890
but when he said that grabbed me in those early days that started opening my

532
00:31:05.891 --> 00:31:08.920
world was,
you know,
my mother wanted me to become a truck driver.

533
00:31:08.921 --> 00:31:10.930
There was this truck,
masters driving school,

534
00:31:10.931 --> 00:31:15.931
these to advertise on television and she was obsessed that I could make $24,000

535
00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:18.520
a year,
which was twice as much as my father.

536
00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:22.690
If I just go to truck driving school and then I'd have this open road and I

537
00:31:22.691 --> 00:31:25.420
bought,
you know,
Adam could drive that truck far enough,
fast enough,

538
00:31:25.421 --> 00:31:28.060
long enough to change the world.
That's not going to change the world.

539
00:31:28.061 --> 00:31:31.990
That's not what my passion is.
And so I went to this event and I saw this man,

540
00:31:31.991 --> 00:31:34.630
I walked out of there and I said it's about adding value.

541
00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:37.600
He showed me that at all levels,
including economics,

542
00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:40.630
that if you found a way to do more for others than anybody else,

543
00:31:40.631 --> 00:31:44.680
you would have the opportunity to grow,
expand heavy impact,
be economically free,

544
00:31:44.681 --> 00:31:45.700
have the choices you want.

545
00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:49.150
The next big chunk was when I got exposed because I was always looking for new

546
00:31:49.151 --> 00:31:52.990
teachers to a man named John [inaudible] who taught neurolinguistic programming

547
00:31:52.991 --> 00:31:53.824
or NLP.

548
00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:58.090
And I watched this man take people in minutes and create changes they've been

549
00:31:58.091 --> 00:32:00.520
working on in decades.
And so I became obsessed.

550
00:32:00.521 --> 00:32:03.700
There was nobody in that community other than therapist and those early days.

551
00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.410
And I convinced him that,
you know,

552
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:09.640
1819 I guess you are told the time to let me come sit in his class cause I was

553
00:32:09.641 --> 00:32:11.590
going to put my ear to the door anyway,
no matter what.

554
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.830
And I w I took notes like crazy at the end of the class.

555
00:32:14.831 --> 00:32:17.050
And then there was a day there where this person,

556
00:32:17.051 --> 00:32:19.600
he was out of the room and this person started going through this,

557
00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:22.900
this phobic exposure and started freaking out and screaming.

558
00:32:22.901 --> 00:32:27.010
And I'm in a room with 70 people and they're all therapists and nobody's doing

559
00:32:27.011 --> 00:32:31.590
anything.
And so I just stood up and I just grabbed this person and I just,
I,

560
00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:33.100
I wasn't gonna let him stop her.

561
00:32:33.101 --> 00:32:36.970
And then everything that I'd learned consciously and unconsciously came out and

562
00:32:36.971 --> 00:32:38.380
was like magic.
And you know,

563
00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:41.180
15 minutes later it was gone and John Walked in the room,
everyone's like,

564
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:44.300
you just see what this guy did.
You know,
he's a phenol,
I know clean.
I'm,

565
00:32:44.301 --> 00:32:46.340
all I did was,
I cared so much,

566
00:32:46.341 --> 00:32:49.760
I had so much intensity for the issue and it's like I,
you know,

567
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.660
I don't know how to give,

568
00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.030
I didn't know how to give somebody a mouth to mouth resuscitation.

569
00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:57.260
I was in a place of my father in law where he dropped and I mean dropped.

570
00:32:57.261 --> 00:32:58.910
And nothing that I had learned made a difference.

571
00:32:58.911 --> 00:33:02.570
And somewhere in my head and milliseconds while he was dying and turning gray,

572
00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:06.530
my brain remembered having seen some hundred goop to talk about.

573
00:33:06.531 --> 00:33:09.800
It's not mouth to mouth,
it's press compressions to get blood into the brain.

574
00:33:09.801 --> 00:33:11.000
Where does your brain come up with that?

575
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:13.670
It comes up because it's attuned to answers.

576
00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.720
When you become an an altered state of state of passion,
a state of commitment,

577
00:33:17.721 --> 00:33:20.450
a state of Musk.
When,
when you listened to Peter,

578
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.360
when you put himself on the line,
when he,
you know,
the way you take,
as you said,

579
00:33:23.361 --> 00:33:26.960
you take the island,
you burn the boats in those moments,
the answer's there.

580
00:33:26.961 --> 00:33:30.570
So then I started making that my modus operandi.
I want on,
you know,

581
00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:32.300
national radio in Canada.

582
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.420
And I challenged psychologists and psychiatrists after I had four days of

583
00:33:35.421 --> 00:33:39.280
training.
And I said,
I don't care what your problem is.
I don't care if you,
uh,

584
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:41.690
if you have uncontrollable phobias,
see me,

585
00:33:41.691 --> 00:33:45.980
I'll handle it literally in one hour or less.
And you know,
then I got challenged.

586
00:33:45.981 --> 00:33:48.380
Psychiatry is called me on the phone and made my whole career by saying,

587
00:33:48.381 --> 00:33:49.730
you're a liar.
You're a charlatan.

588
00:33:49.731 --> 00:33:52.820
People like you should not be allowed on the radio.
And I said,
sir,
I said,

589
00:33:52.821 --> 00:33:56.540
have you ever met me?
Said of course not.
I see if you ever met my clients.

590
00:33:56.541 --> 00:34:00.770
He said,
of course not.
I said,
so are you a scientist?
He's well,
I'm a physician.

591
00:34:00.771 --> 00:34:02.240
I said,
are you a scientist?
I said,
good,

592
00:34:02.241 --> 00:34:04.490
cause the scientist would never make an assumption.

593
00:34:04.491 --> 00:34:08.310
What you're telling me is what you're proposing is your hypothesis.

594
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:12.230
The stripe hypothesis is that I'm a charlatan wire,
so let's prove it.

595
00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.540
I'm at the Holiday Inn tomorrow night.
Anyone listening,

596
00:34:14.541 --> 00:34:16.040
come bring me your worst patient.

597
00:34:16.041 --> 00:34:18.110
Bring me somebody you've never been able to cure.
I said,

598
00:34:18.111 --> 00:34:21.710
I'm sure you've got plenty of those and I and typhus,
dido point.

599
00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:24.140
We had nowhere to go,
and so he brought me this woman,

600
00:34:24.141 --> 00:34:26.960
he treated for seven years a snake phobia,

601
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:29.330
which she dream about a snake in the middle of the night,

602
00:34:29.331 --> 00:34:31.770
wake up four or five times a night,
treat it for seven years,

603
00:34:31.771 --> 00:34:33.770
and then 15 minutes later I grabbed a snake around her.

604
00:34:33.771 --> 00:34:36.830
So that became my modus operandi results and that's where I came up with the

605
00:34:36.831 --> 00:34:40.190
idea of coaching.
I said,
I'm not a motivator.
No one was using the term.

606
00:34:40.191 --> 00:34:43.520
It's built kind of the beginning of an industry that my idea of coaching was not

607
00:34:43.521 --> 00:34:47.420
going to get a certificate is you're paid for results.
So I would go and say,

608
00:34:47.421 --> 00:34:49.610
you pay me nothing.
I'll do one session.

609
00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:53.030
Give me the most impossible task on a turnaround.
You're addicted to a drug,

610
00:34:53.031 --> 00:34:55.730
you're smoking the cigarette,
you're in this place.
And I built it.

611
00:34:55.731 --> 00:34:58.490
I went to the United States army and they said,
give me a program,

612
00:34:58.491 --> 00:35:00.050
we'll take any training program you have.

613
00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.840
I'll cut the training time in half and increase the competency.

614
00:35:02.841 --> 00:35:05.660
You pay me nothing.
He said,
you're crazy.
I said,
no,
I'm expensive.

615
00:35:05.661 --> 00:35:09.530
And negotiated and I took a four day pistol shooting program and turn it a one

616
00:35:09.531 --> 00:35:13.760
day program quantified a 100% of the people when before they'd only done 70% the

617
00:35:13.761 --> 00:35:14.211
colonel wrote,

618
00:35:14.211 --> 00:35:17.000
the general says the first breakthrough since World War One and pistol shooting,

619
00:35:17.001 --> 00:35:20.000
I never shot a gun before it was this driving force.

620
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:21.410
Then I started with athletes.

621
00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:23.840
Then all of a sudden I'm working with Princess Diana,
then President Clinton,

622
00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.120
who by the way,
you're absolutely right cause he didn't,

623
00:35:26.121 --> 00:35:27.710
it didn't have an AOL account back there.

624
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:29.060
I remember when I first started working there,
I said,

625
00:35:29.061 --> 00:35:31.930
there's this new stuff called email.
I got this thing called all,

626
00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.160
they will talk electronically.
He goes,
I've heard about that.

627
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:36.260
He didn't have an account in those days.

628
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.970
So and just brewed to businesses and individuals.

629
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.720
So every time you do something and you think you've done your best,

630
00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:45.720
if you're a growing him and being,
you find out it's not your best.

631
00:35:45.721 --> 00:35:48.510
There's a new level and you'll get there.
There's the new horizon.

632
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.480
If there is a passion to serve something bigger than yourself.

633
00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:53.630
And if you're not limited,
just your thinking.

634
00:35:53.631 --> 00:35:58.190
I believe the steep people get in signifies what capacity of their brain they're

635
00:35:58.191 --> 00:36:01.400
going to be able to utilize and become an expert in changing your state.

636
00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.530
Changing the story that limits that state.

637
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:05.650
And then finding the real strategy is the word.

638
00:36:05.651 --> 00:36:06.830
Because I don't give a shit what state you're in.

639
00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:09.110
If you're running east looking for a sunset,
you're screwed.

640
00:36:09.111 --> 00:36:12.020
You've got to have the right strategy as well.
Those three things are,

641
00:36:12.021 --> 00:36:15.230
I think we're going to do it for anybody.
Change Your strategy,
change your story,

642
00:36:15.231 --> 00:36:17.220
change your state,
and you can pretty much change.
And it's,

643
00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:22.700
<v 1>and Tony d,
what was the last name of the NLP teacher that you mentioned?</v>

644
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.750
<v 3>Render John Grender,
one of the cofounders.</v>

645
00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:29.150
<v 1>Got It.
And uh,
I think the commonality at least,</v>

646
00:36:29.151 --> 00:36:33.540
or one of the commonalities if I'm trying to piece together the patterns,
uh,

647
00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.800
speaking to the two of you is that you put your reputation's where your mouth

648
00:36:37.801 --> 00:36:42.690
was,
right?
In both cases,
uh,
in slightly different approaches.
But,
uh,

649
00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:45.840
I just gets me so amped up.
My hands are getting sweaty.

650
00:36:45.841 --> 00:36:49.290
Just thinking about big stuff.
Just listening to you guys.
Speaking of big things,

651
00:36:49.291 --> 00:36:53.790
I want to make sure that we have ample time to cover something that we're,

652
00:36:53.791 --> 00:36:58.440
we're all very excited about.
And that is the,
the global learning x prize.

653
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:02.070
And perhaps Peter,
you could chat about this before we jump into it though.

654
00:37:02.071 --> 00:37:06.240
I want to mention a couple things to people.
Number One,
first and foremost,

655
00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:08.990
very similar to Tony in this,
in this respect.
I've,

656
00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:13.940
I've been a lifelong reader and autodidact.
I've,

657
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:17.580
I've had many incredible teachers,
but,
uh,
I've,
I've,

658
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:21.090
my most important teachers in many cases have come from books.

659
00:37:21.091 --> 00:37:24.120
They've come a indirectly through words on a page.

660
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.800
And I was actually going to be held back my,
uh,

661
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:31.590
for kindergarten because I didn't learn to read.

662
00:37:31.591 --> 00:37:35.850
And my teacher was convinced I couldn't read,
which was not the case.
What,
what,

663
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:36.030
uh,

664
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:39.480
what ended up being the problem is that she never explained why I should learn

665
00:37:39.481 --> 00:37:41.870
the alphabet.
And then I got into first grade,
and this is Vince Gill.

666
00:37:41.871 --> 00:37:44.910
I still remember her sit,
Tim,
I know you don't want to learn the alphabet,

667
00:37:44.911 --> 00:37:49.200
but if you learn the alphabet you will be able to read books.
I was like,
well,

668
00:37:49.201 --> 00:37:52.050
why didn't somebody tell me this and learn to read?

669
00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:57.450
And that is the,
and so Mrs Minsky to this day,
uh,
you know,

670
00:37:57.451 --> 00:37:59.520
I ended up being the Valedictorian of my,
uh,

671
00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:03.720
my grade school because of her and she had competition.

672
00:38:03.721 --> 00:38:05.580
So to just to bring it kind of full circle,

673
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:09.030
she had these little paper race cars that we would make and put them on a wall.

674
00:38:09.031 --> 00:38:12.660
And there was a track with the number of books read and there was a competition

675
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:16.270
to get to the end.
And,
uh,
and I,

676
00:38:16.271 --> 00:38:20.970
I got to the end like maybe a third of the way through the year and then we had

677
00:38:20.971 --> 00:38:23.040
to sort of extend the,
the race track.

678
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:27.420
But it was all due to that passion she had for,

679
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:30.780
for reading and her ability to explain the benefits of it.

680
00:38:30.781 --> 00:38:34.740
So as a Segue,
Peter,
maybe you could tell us a bit about the,

681
00:38:34.741 --> 00:38:35.980
the global learning x prize,
which I'm

682
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.850
<v 2>so excited about.
And thank you.
Thank you Tim.</v>

683
00:38:39.851 --> 00:38:42.850
So when I think about what are the world's biggest problems,

684
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:46.570
the problems that if we as society could fix,

685
00:38:46.571 --> 00:38:48.160
would really transform this planet.

686
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:52.420
I mean that every mother and father and every person watching should really care

687
00:38:52.421 --> 00:38:56.050
about,
there's one that when you pull that thread,

688
00:38:56.590 --> 00:39:00.070
topples others.
And that's creating a world of literacy.

689
00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:02.800
There's a billion illiterate people on the planet.

690
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:06.730
Two thirds of them are women and 250 million of them are kids.

691
00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:10.750
And they live in the parts of the world that will never build enough schools or

692
00:39:10.751 --> 00:39:12.970
teaching of teachers.
And I'll tell you one thing,

693
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:17.110
a population of people who are literate are more peaceful,

694
00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.840
more prosperous and less populous.
In fact,

695
00:39:19.841 --> 00:39:22.900
it was Bill Gates has a great ted talk and when she talks about the fact that

696
00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.310
the,
you know,

697
00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:27.790
there's something you can do to stop population growth rates and it's makeup

698
00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:31.660
population healthier and more literate and you do that,
they,
you know,

699
00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:34.150
growth stops.
In fact,
growth goes negative.

700
00:39:34.151 --> 00:39:36.130
And it really is a key part of our world.

701
00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:41.100
So a at x prize we every year have pulled together the smartest people in

702
00:39:41.101 --> 00:39:43.570
applying and say,
where should we be focusing our next x prize?

703
00:39:43.571 --> 00:39:46.810
We call this thing visioneering.
Tony's been a part of it.
Tim,

704
00:39:46.811 --> 00:39:50.050
I would welcome your participation in the future.

705
00:39:50.051 --> 00:39:54.520
And we add this debate and discussion with those smartest and wealthiest people

706
00:39:54.521 --> 00:39:58.690
on the planet.
And literacy learning became the focal point.

707
00:39:58.691 --> 00:40:03.550
So we set out to create something we call the global learning x prize.

708
00:40:03.551 --> 00:40:05.620
And here's the question,
can we,

709
00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:10.920
can we get entrepreneurs around the planet to build a piece of software that can

710
00:40:12.071 --> 00:40:15.250
operate on any,
any fablet,
any tablet,

711
00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:20.050
and take a child where there is nothing,
no literate adults,
no schools,
nothing.

712
00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:25.060
And on their own,
take them to basic reading,
writing,
and numeracy.

713
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.620
And that's our,
and we fundamentally believe it is possible.

714
00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:34.890
Got Amazing support from Nicholas Negroponte create one laptop per child who he

715
00:40:35.591 --> 00:40:40.270
and Matt Keller who's running this prize for us actually did an experiment.

716
00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:43.690
They took tablets,
uh,
uh,
into Ethiopia,

717
00:40:43.691 --> 00:40:48.370
into villages that were a hundred miles from any schools,
uh,
any anything.

718
00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:53.730
And they dropped the tablets off in a box and the kids opened the box,

719
00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.490
learned on their own how to turn on the tablet,

720
00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:01.960
how to use the apps and how to start learning to sound out words.

721
00:41:01.961 --> 00:41:06.010
The problem they had was that the software was so poor,

722
00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:11.050
it limited them.
And so our question is,
can we create what Neil Stevenson,

723
00:41:11.051 --> 00:41:14.260
a great author and science fiction would call the young ladies illustrator

724
00:41:14.261 --> 00:41:16.810
primer from,
from diamond age.

725
00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:20.230
Can we create software that allows kids to teach themselves?

726
00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:24.450
That's our challenge.
That's what the global learning x prize and about.
And,
uh,

727
00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:25.261
I think there,

728
00:41:25.261 --> 00:41:28.660
there are a couple of really important aspects to this that I'd love to

729
00:41:28.661 --> 00:41:32.850
underscore for people.
Uh,
well first I'll just,
I'll second the,

730
00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:34.370
the Neal Stephenson recommendation

731
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:35.690
<v 1>and if you're going to start with one eye,</v>

732
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:39.080
I'm a huge fan of snow crash cryptonomic on.

733
00:41:39.081 --> 00:41:43.190
But coming back to the,
uh,
your boldest mission yet,

734
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:47.610
I think is what you called in an email that I received.
And,
uh,
there,

735
00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:50.900
there are two things I think that the,
the,

736
00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:54.560
I think it's worth talking about the old way,
uh,

737
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:58.370
and the challenges of trying to meet the demands of say,

738
00:41:58.371 --> 00:42:01.070
250 million illiterate children.
How many,

739
00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.680
at least based on what I've read,

740
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:08.540
it looks like that would take 1.6 million new teachers by 2015.
Needless to say,

741
00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:12.980
doesn't seem like there's any way that the,
the old way with scale.
Right.

742
00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:18.140
And,
uh,
another thing I want to sort of point out to folks is that if,

743
00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.650
if you create a literate,

744
00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:27.410
numerate mother,
uh,
or,
uh,
particularly younger women children,

745
00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:32.180
uh,
you,
you tend to,
in many countries,
create educated families.
So there's,

746
00:42:32.181 --> 00:42:36.380
there's sort of a false multiplier effect,
uh,
by,
by attacking this.

747
00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:40.850
And the other thing I'd love you to talk about is,
uh,
maybe,
maybe you could just,

748
00:42:40.851 --> 00:42:45.390
uh,
obviously comment on how people can get involved,
but the,
the,

749
00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:49.070
the fact that it's not just using software to make people literate,

750
00:42:49.071 --> 00:42:52.790
but there's a time constraint.
Yeah.
So I think it's 18 months,
is that right?

751
00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:55.280
<v 2>Yeah,
it was a friend,</v>

752
00:42:55.281 --> 00:42:58.850
a Elon Musk that challenged us to do it faster.
Um,

753
00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.580
and then we originally planned it's 18 months.
So literally,

754
00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.930
so the way this prize is going to work,

755
00:43:02.931 --> 00:43:07.060
we announced it at the United Nations General Assembly.
Uh,

756
00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.790
if I can say Tony,
uh,

757
00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:12.100
Tony is one of our major benefactors underwriting the purse.
Uh,

758
00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:17.180
we raised a $15 million of prize money for this and we announced it the UN a Ga,

759
00:43:19.711 --> 00:43:23.430
we at the social good summit and at the Clinton Global Initiative by the honor

760
00:43:23.431 --> 00:43:26.580
of closing out Cgi with President Clinton talking about this.

761
00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:32.420
And we expect there will be hundreds if not thousands of teams competing for

762
00:43:33.041 --> 00:43:35.170
this team can come from anywhere.
It can be a high school team,

763
00:43:35.171 --> 00:43:39.170
it can be a team out of Microsoft.
The team out of Mumbai,
it doesn't matter.

764
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:41.120
And you've got to build a piece of software.

765
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:46.250
We're going to narrow it down from a thousand plus teams down to a top five and

766
00:43:46.251 --> 00:43:49.420
those five we're going to deliver their software to us,
uh,

767
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:53.030
and they're each going to win $1 million of capital right there.

768
00:43:53.031 --> 00:43:55.790
And that software has got to engage the student because if they,

769
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:58.510
if it's not exciting for them to use the software,

770
00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:01.700
they're going to give up and put the tablet down and it's done game over.

771
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.800
It's got to actually be,
you know,

772
00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:08.480
compelling enough and exciting enough and understand that child's favorite
movie,

773
00:44:08.481 --> 00:44:10.640
Star Sports,
dark colored.
So it engages them in,

774
00:44:10.641 --> 00:44:15.620
personalizes it in a way that makes them want to learn and we're going to

775
00:44:15.621 --> 00:44:16.700
deliver that software.

776
00:44:16.701 --> 00:44:21.170
Those five finalists are going to be delivered to 5,000 kids in sub Saharan

777
00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:26.170
Africa and on 5,000 tablets and in a measure over 18 months where they go from

778
00:44:27.031 --> 00:44:30.990
zero to how far they can go in terms of reading,
writing,
and numeracy.

779
00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:35.010
And we're going to crown a winner.
It has to meet a certain level.

780
00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.050
I won't go into detail now,

781
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.900
but the cool thing about this prize and like any other x prize,

782
00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:45.130
the winning technology wins or the winning software winds 10 million bucks,

783
00:44:45.131 --> 00:44:49.830
that's great.
But we also get the right to open source that software.

784
00:44:49.831 --> 00:44:54.360
So imagine if the best software in the planet for teaching a child reading,

785
00:44:54.361 --> 00:44:55.194
writing,
and numeracy.

786
00:44:55.410 --> 00:45:00.410
Now it became available for free on every tablet and every smartphone put out

787
00:45:00.611 --> 00:45:05.410
there,
there'll be a billion handsets in Africa by 2016.

788
00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:06.570
I mean,

789
00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:11.570
imagine if every one of them became the type of of compelling teaching

790
00:45:12.761 --> 00:45:16.460
capability that a billionaire used or teenager.

791
00:45:16.461 --> 00:45:20.150
Mumbai used the same,
the same way that Google is the same for Eric Schmidt,

792
00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:25.340
for the poorest kid on the planet.
It's extremely exciting.
And,
uh,

793
00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:28.700
obviously I want to direct people to a few places where they can learn more.

794
00:45:28.701 --> 00:45:31.050
But I'd be curious,
Tony,
to hear from you.
You,

795
00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:35.630
there's so many places you could invest your time and resources.

796
00:45:35.631 --> 00:45:40.130
I'm sure you get asked to contribute to many,
many,
many,
many different things.

797
00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:43.010
Why is this,
why is this important to you?

798
00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:47.990
Why have you decided to take such a sort of a large position in supporting it?

799
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:50.063
<v 3>Well,
you know,</v>

800
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:54.070
I look at the how do you create the greatest impact on the quality of people's

801
00:45:54.071 --> 00:45:58.570
lives?
And if you listened to the three of us in this conversation as a sampling,

802
00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:02.590
uh,
I believe that the thing that affects that most as learning,
I mean,

803
00:46:02.591 --> 00:46:06.400
we are growing learning machines.
A person's ability to learn,
to grow,

804
00:46:06.401 --> 00:46:07.540
to solve problems,

805
00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:11.710
to be able to expand is what develops the quality of life for any human being.

806
00:46:11.711 --> 00:46:12.700
That's what we're made for.

807
00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:16.750
And it all starts in the world we live today in order to access the resources

808
00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:20.590
and reading,
writing and arithmetic,
right,
numeracy,
those three components,

809
00:46:20.591 --> 00:46:23.230
as basic as the art,
as boring of the sound to us,

810
00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.960
they opened the door for all three of us.
I mean,
your story,
Tim,
about,
you know,

811
00:46:26.961 --> 00:46:28.930
not wanting to run the alphabet,
but okay,

812
00:46:28.931 --> 00:46:32.350
but then I could read because you understood it at some level even than that

813
00:46:32.351 --> 00:46:34.360
reading would open another universe as it did to me.

814
00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.790
I transported myself into other people's lives.

815
00:46:36.791 --> 00:46:40.810
I transported myself and to new opportunities and new concepts,
new solutions.

816
00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.240
All three of us had done this all through hasn't got this benefit.

817
00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:46.330
Elon Musk has done that and I believe that self learning,

818
00:46:46.331 --> 00:46:49.780
self directed learning is the most important of all because what's going to

819
00:46:49.781 --> 00:46:52.430
happen in that environment is people's individual passions.

820
00:46:52.431 --> 00:46:53.950
They're going to let them hack their own lives.

821
00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:57.700
They're going to let them re vamp,
especially in the world we have today where,

822
00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:01.570
let me think about it.
10 years ago we had what,
500 million people on the web?

823
00:47:01.571 --> 00:47:02.560
It's hard to even imagine.

824
00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:07.330
We've got 2 billion today and in six years we're going to have by billion 3

825
00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:08.920
billion people are going to be joining that system,

826
00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:11.710
but be able to take advantage of that system fully.

827
00:47:11.711 --> 00:47:14.290
You've got to be able to have these fundamental skills.

828
00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:16.720
So my whole thing has become a learning machine.

829
00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:20.620
We sure as hell can't do that when you have such a large population of our

830
00:47:20.621 --> 00:47:24.520
society and of our world,
that doesn't even have the opportunity to start with.

831
00:47:24.521 --> 00:47:29.290
So we all know that children's inventiveness is extraordinary.

832
00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:33.370
What we're really doing here is using tools and technology to literally open up

833
00:47:33.371 --> 00:47:36.500
the worlds no matter where you live.
You know we're all lucky.
I mean,

834
00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:38.710
but you look at how our lives have changed.

835
00:47:38.711 --> 00:47:41.530
I'll give you another thing that I believe a principal and that's proximity.

836
00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:45.910
We change proximity.
When Peter came up with this dream of his,

837
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:50.560
he put himself in proximity without different type of person over and over and

838
00:47:50.561 --> 00:47:54.070
over again and shared his passion and story and that proximity opened up

839
00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:55.420
opportunities.
You know,

840
00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:58.750
books are a way of getting proximity when I didn't have physical proximity to

841
00:47:58.751 --> 00:48:03.460
some of those solutions,
but that proximity for someone and South Africa,

842
00:48:03.461 --> 00:48:05.020
somebody in certain parts of India,

843
00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:10.150
some parts and parts of the third world to have there be no separation from your

844
00:48:10.151 --> 00:48:10.820
capacity.

845
00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:14.470
You have the same education that somebody has it mid that somebody has at

846
00:48:14.471 --> 00:48:16.600
Stanford.
That stuff was coming online,

847
00:48:16.601 --> 00:48:19.000
but it's worthless if you don't have the basic code.

848
00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:23.260
That alphabet you talked about in the very beginning.
So I put my time,
my energy,

849
00:48:23.261 --> 00:48:26.080
and my money on the line in this area because I don't think there's more

850
00:48:26.081 --> 00:48:28.600
important we can give back to society helping other reason.

851
00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.570
When you look at society and you see the problems that we have,

852
00:48:31.571 --> 00:48:34.120
a lot of people think of these problems as somebody else's problems.

853
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:37.510
These are our problems.
Cause if you look at the biggest challenges in the world,

854
00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:40.300
they come from the people in society that are forgotten.

855
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:43.330
They come from people that becomes so frustrated.

856
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:45.520
They don't have a way to come up with an empowering meaning.

857
00:48:45.521 --> 00:48:47.320
They don't have a way to transport themselves,

858
00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:49.300
they don't have a way to change the quality of their life.

859
00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:52.210
And those are the individuals that turned to violence.
You know,

860
00:48:52.211 --> 00:48:54.160
you think about it,
somebody asked me a few years ago,

861
00:48:54.161 --> 00:48:57.770
I was in India and I literally left the hotel there in India,

862
00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:00.530
I think about two days before the big bombing.

863
00:49:00.531 --> 00:49:04.400
And I literally saw the bombing and two days after I'd been there and I was

864
00:49:04.401 --> 00:49:06.620
talking with a friend and they were with a group of people.

865
00:49:06.621 --> 00:49:08.480
One of the person's just saying,
how is this possible?

866
00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:11.810
How does this type of violence possible?
How could somebody killed men,

867
00:49:11.811 --> 00:49:14.180
women and children in this way?
And I said,
you know,

868
00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:17.240
it's really possible because I'll tell you what's not possible for it wasn't a

869
00:49:17.241 --> 00:49:20.780
happy person,
it wasn't a growing person,
it wasn't a fulfilled human being.

870
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:23.480
Happy person is not trying to destroy somebody else's life.

871
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:26.900
And if you want to know what makes human beings happy,
isn't money,
money,

872
00:49:26.901 --> 00:49:29.510
we'll give you a certain level of happiness.
Depends on which study you read.

873
00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:34.910
It is one thing,
one thing only progress.
Progress equals happiness.

874
00:49:34.911 --> 00:49:36.680
If you feel like you're growing,
expanding,

875
00:49:36.681 --> 00:49:40.390
and your psychology and your humanity and your emotion and your capacity and

876
00:49:40.391 --> 00:49:43.550
your economics,
you feel alive.
We grow or we die.

877
00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:48.300
And you put a giant limitation on that based on where you live in a world where

878
00:49:48.301 --> 00:49:48.950
you're born,

879
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:52.610
unless you have access to certain resources and the most fundamental resources

880
00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:55.590
learning.
But with technology now it doesn't matter where you live.

881
00:49:55.591 --> 00:49:59.740
If you know how to learn the world is yours.
And so on a zero to 10,

882
00:49:59.741 --> 00:50:03.430
to me this is a 1 million of importance and that's why I've committed the time,

883
00:50:03.431 --> 00:50:05.350
energy and capital to help make it work.

884
00:50:05.351 --> 00:50:08.200
And it's why all the other people are doing the same that are part of this team.

885
00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:12.820
<v 1>Absolutely.
Well said.
And I want to point out something else.</v>

886
00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:14.990
I'll send it to those techies listening cause I know a lot of,

887
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:17.420
lot of techies out there listening to this.
Uh,

888
00:50:17.421 --> 00:50:21.730
and even those who are not necessarily technically trained,
I am not uh,

889
00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:23.990
would find the fact that open source,

890
00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:27.980
there's an aspect of open source that we didn't really touch on and is not only

891
00:50:27.981 --> 00:50:32.810
is it freely available to people to use in some way and some,
uh,

892
00:50:32.811 --> 00:50:36.240
interpretation in some like user interface but people can,

893
00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.660
it is then available to be improved upon.

894
00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:41.930
So I think it's very fascinating that,

895
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.230
let's just say hypothetically we have these teams,

896
00:50:45.231 --> 00:50:49.190
five teams are given a million each.
They,
they,
they bust their asses.
Think big,

897
00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:54.110
create really innovative software to try to solve this problem.
Finally you find,

898
00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:57.780
you find the winner.
The code is made available,
uh,

899
00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:59.420
people are becoming literate,

900
00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:03.080
who can then improve upon the software itself.

901
00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:05.690
It's just a very sort of a virtuous,

902
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:09.260
recursive aspect of the whole thing that is really,

903
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:13.610
really cool.
And a,
so guys,
everyone listening,

904
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:19.340
those of you who followed me for a while know that I don't get this excited

905
00:51:19.341 --> 00:51:23.780
about a lot of things,
but I've been waiting to pick this shot for a long time.

906
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:28.640
Uh,
and I've talked about my passion for education,
uh,

907
00:51:28.641 --> 00:51:31.610
and,
and reforming education,
improving education,

908
00:51:31.611 --> 00:51:36.410
which is really improving learning since my,
my ted talk in 2008.
And,

909
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:36.800
uh,

910
00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:41.800
there've been very few opportunities to really use an Archimedes lever to,

911
00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:44.660
to sort of move the world.
And I think this is,

912
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:49.050
this is very legitimately one of them.
So,
uh,
Peter,
maybe you could,
um,

913
00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:52.850
well there,
there are two things.
The first is,
uh,
as we know,

914
00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.150
based on the results of the spectacular results of the x prize,

915
00:51:56.151 --> 00:52:00.560
that people respond to incentives and,
um,
that's not,
uh,

916
00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:03.260
being good or bad as being human.
People respond to incentives.

917
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:07.340
So we have obviously for those people who are interested in trying to develop

918
00:52:07.341 --> 00:52:11.270
this software and compete for the prize,
uh,
where should they,

919
00:52:11.271 --> 00:52:13.160
where should they go?
Where can they learn more?

920
00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:17.370
<v 2>Yeah.
If you go to [inaudible] dot org our website,</v>

921
00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:21.600
you can click on the learning x prize there and there's information about how to

922
00:52:21.601 --> 00:52:25.590
register as a team,
how to preregister right now.
And it's pretty easy.

923
00:52:25.591 --> 00:52:29.520
Just tell us you're interested in forming a team and get involved.
Um,

924
00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:34.140
we'll take it through the process.
You know,
if you're a commercial company,
great.

925
00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:37.180
If you're a,
a nonprofit or a startup,
whatever.

926
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:41.440
I know that when we give people a very clear target,
uh,

927
00:52:41.830 --> 00:52:44.590
it drives them,
it focuses them and uh,

928
00:52:44.591 --> 00:52:47.980
it's a great thing whether you enter the competition in the final result or not.

929
00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:50.290
So [inaudible] dot org is how you can register.

930
00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.870
<v 1>Excellent.
And,
um,
I just just mentioned to people,
you know,</v>

931
00:52:52.871 --> 00:52:56.870
I had a conversation with a good friend of mine recently who's made hundreds of

932
00:52:56.870 --> 00:53:00.530
millions of dollars and he's a very grounded,
deep,
soulful guy.

933
00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.820
And we went for a hike because I've,

934
00:53:01.821 --> 00:53:05.990
I've been trying to decide on sort of my next chapters,
so to speak,

935
00:53:05.991 --> 00:53:10.000
the next projects that I pick.
And the way he encouraged me to think about it,
he,

936
00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:13.610
he gave me a couple of questions to ask myself and one of them was,
you know,

937
00:53:13.611 --> 00:53:18.050
if your goal were to be remembered in the history books,
you know,

938
00:53:18.051 --> 00:53:22.130
metaphorically two,
300 years from now,
what could you do?

939
00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:26.160
And he sort of engineer it in reverse that question.
You know,

940
00:53:26.161 --> 00:53:28.650
if your goal is to have a big impact,
let's get very specific.

941
00:53:28.651 --> 00:53:32.310
If you're going to be remembered two,
300 years from now or more,

942
00:53:32.311 --> 00:53:33.330
what could you do?

943
00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:37.470
And I would actually pose that to people listening to this.

944
00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:41.250
And I would say one of the answers is winning this competition.
Uh,

945
00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:46.230
I really feel like it could,
uh,
have that great an impact.
Uh,

946
00:53:46.231 --> 00:53:48.360
I mean,
you could really go down in history for this one.

947
00:53:48.361 --> 00:53:50.340
So that's point number one.
Point number two,

948
00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:54.600
for those people who just want to perhaps look at some very,

949
00:53:54.601 --> 00:53:56.670
very fascinating prizes.

950
00:53:56.671 --> 00:53:59.700
If you'd like to support the global learning x prize,

951
00:54:00.030 --> 00:54:04.680
there's an Indiegogo page so you can go to indiegogo.com and just search x

952
00:54:04.681 --> 00:54:07.770
prize,
no hyphen needed.
And the first thing that will pop up,

953
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:11.370
and I'll also include this link in the show notes for people in the global

954
00:54:11.371 --> 00:54:14.430
learning x prize.
But,
uh,
there were a couple of prizes there,

955
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:19.450
there prizes for every price point all the way from $25 or $10 even up.

956
00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:23.360
But,
uh,
Peter,
maybe you could comment on,
I thought you could,

957
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:28.020
maybe you could elaborate on one of them,
which is the,
uh,

958
00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:31.020
the 10th anniversary and sorry,
x xpress ticket.

959
00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:33.360
<v 2>Well,
actually,
if I,
if I could,</v>

960
00:54:33.361 --> 00:54:37.140
let me get a context of why this is important because it's really critical for

961
00:54:37.141 --> 00:54:42.090
people to realize.
We do have amazing people like Tony Robbins,
who I love dearly,

962
00:54:42.091 --> 00:54:45.990
who was put up $1 million here.
We raised the capital and you can say,

963
00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:51.240
why would my $10 or $25 even make a difference here and why should I support

964
00:54:51.241 --> 00:54:54.390
this?
And let me tell you why.
As an organization,

965
00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:58.050
we have been dependent on a lot of extraordinary philanthropists.

966
00:54:58.660 --> 00:54:59.650
I want to change that.

967
00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:04.800
I really want the x prize to become an organization where the public decides

968
00:55:05.401 --> 00:55:08.430
what the biggest problems in the world that need to be solved are,

969
00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:13.950
and then vote on those and capitalize those prizes and literally create the

970
00:55:13.951 --> 00:55:17.040
future.
It's like,
we want to solve this problem.
Great.

971
00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:21.000
We'll crowdsource the rules.
We will ways the capitol,

972
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:23.670
and we'll solve that promise.
Literally creating the future.
It's,

973
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:28.140
it's throwing yourself a touchdown pass.
And this Indiegogo campaign is a,

974
00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:33.440
is a means for me to prove to the x prize board into the world that the crowd

975
00:55:34.051 --> 00:55:39.051
wants to be involved in helping to capitalize these prizes and cares about this

976
00:55:39.091 --> 00:55:41.190
model for solving grand challenges.

977
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:44.370
So it's not about to half a million dollars in the million dollars will make,

978
00:55:44.371 --> 00:55:46.410
you know,
donate 10 bucks.
I'm happy with that,

979
00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:51.620
but get involved because we want to open this up so that it's really the world

980
00:55:51.841 --> 00:55:54.600
solving its own problems,
stopping complaining about problems with starting,

981
00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:59.280
solving problems.
That mindset is so critically important for society today.

982
00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:03.930
Um,
the,
the second thing is where are we going to use this money that we raise?

983
00:56:03.931 --> 00:56:08.700
So we today are basically taking these,
uh,
the software,

984
00:56:08.701 --> 00:56:11.610
these tablets out to 5,000 kids in sub Saharan Africa.

985
00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:16.260
Our goal is to double that number and in success we'll go to 10,000 kids,

986
00:56:16.261 --> 00:56:17.400
not in a hundred villages,

987
00:56:17.401 --> 00:56:22.290
but 200 villages to really statistically get the numbers working best and to

988
00:56:22.291 --> 00:56:26.790
really see the major impact of this global learning x prize can have.
Um,

989
00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:31.300
and so how can you be involved?
Uh,
lots of ways.
Uh,
you know,
like you said,
Tim,

990
00:56:31.301 --> 00:56:35.560
it's from 10 bucks up to 10,000 bucks.
Two of my favorite,
uh,

991
00:56:35.561 --> 00:56:36.394
if I could is,

992
00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:41.610
is one of them is for Ford for 25 bucks.

993
00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:47.660
You can get actually access to the winning software for your kid or your niece

994
00:56:48.401 --> 00:56:51.040
or your friend 18 months before it goes open source.

995
00:56:51.041 --> 00:56:54.700
So we're going to be a actually taking the five finalists and making that,

996
00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:58.000
those finalists available to,
uh,
backers of this.

997
00:56:58.001 --> 00:57:00.400
So if you want to play with the software yourself,

998
00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:06.090
25 bucks means you care about this prize and we'll give you a download code when

999
00:57:06.701 --> 00:57:09.080
the software as going out to kids in Africa,

1000
00:57:09.081 --> 00:57:10.520
you'll get a chance to download it too.

1001
00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:13.550
And they don't have to be technical in order to use it.
No,
it can be.

1002
00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:18.490
It's going to be an android app you download and use pretty instantly.

1003
00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:21.470
You'll,
in fact,
you have to be as technical as the,

1004
00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:25.520
as the eight year olds in Africa that we're,
uh,
that we're,
uh,

1005
00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:29.270
that we're working with.
And then another very cool one,
if I could,
uh,

1006
00:57:29.271 --> 00:57:31.720
is at at 50 bucks,

1007
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:36.990
you get to be involved in visioneering.
Visioneering is this thing that we do.

1008
00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:40.470
140 people,
Ceos,
top philanthropists.

1009
00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:42.570
You can become a digital vision year.

1010
00:57:42.571 --> 00:57:46.930
You get to vote on which x prize we should focus on next year.

1011
00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:49.510
So you get to help direct where the x prize,

1012
00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:52.570
what grand challenge on the planet we're working towards.
Next.

1013
00:57:52.571 --> 00:57:56.610
You care about climate,
do you care about water health?
What is it?
Uh,

1014
00:57:56.660 --> 00:58:00.920
you get involved.
So this is about really inclusion.
Uh,

1015
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:06.100
and that's really why I want people involved here.
Show you care,
get involved,

1016
00:58:06.101 --> 00:58:09.070
help us really change the world on a massive scale.

1017
00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:12.600
<v 1>Definitely.
And,
uh,
you know,
for the,
for those of you who will,</v>

1018
00:58:12.601 --> 00:58:17.070
who are interested in,
uh,
in really doubling down in other ways,
uh,
you can also,

1019
00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:21.450
uh,
you have a chance to spend some time with,
with,
with Peter Himself,

1020
00:58:21.451 --> 00:58:25.650
Sir Richard Branson and others,
the 10th anniversary Ansari x prize,

1021
00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:28.580
a event.
And then also,
uh,

1022
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:33.120
maybe Tony could talk a little bit a bout a date with destiny.
So this is a,

1023
00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:37.530
an opportunity to spend some time with Tony himself.
Uh,

1024
00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:42.110
and uh,
that is also an option on the,
on the Indiegogo page.
But,
uh,
perhaps Tony,

1025
00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:43.500
you could mention just a little bit about that.

1026
00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:45.520
<v 3>I didn't even know was there</v>

1027
00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:53.740
any way I can say,
well,
you know,
there,
there we go

1028
00:58:57.070 --> 00:59:01.690
once a year.
That's six day process.
It's my most intensive program and uh,

1029
00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:05.050
you know,
people from sports,
entertainment,
business,
average people.

1030
00:59:05.051 --> 00:59:08.650
We have people usually from usually about 40 to 50 countries.

1031
00:59:08.651 --> 00:59:10.630
We translate six or seven languages.

1032
00:59:10.631 --> 00:59:15.631
And the outcome of those six days is most of us don't understand that there is,

1033
00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:17.920
uh,
you know,
a software program,
if you will,

1034
00:59:17.921 --> 00:59:22.921
an operating system that really controls how you think and experience every part

1035
00:59:23.091 --> 00:59:23.571
of your life.

1036
00:59:23.571 --> 00:59:26.540
We know that generally we know what we value and what we believe generally,

1037
00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:30.500
but we take that down to a level that's my mind boggling where you will

1038
00:59:30.501 --> 00:59:33.590
understand why you think the thought you think,
feel the feelings you have.

1039
00:59:33.591 --> 00:59:34.640
And more importantly,

1040
00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:38.240
once you understand what's really the controlling force in your entire life,

1041
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:41.720
you rewire it because you can't change something you're unaware of.

1042
00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:44.330
And then you just have a random life.
And I don't care.

1043
00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:47.270
Some people have had randomness that's brought a lot of greatness to their life.

1044
00:59:47.271 --> 00:59:50.840
So you find what's great in your life and if I met what's not and you find out

1045
00:59:50.841 --> 00:59:54.470
the real source and cause of it,
and it's an experience that is,

1046
00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:56.810
I mean you laugh more,
you cry more,

1047
00:59:56.811 --> 01:00:00.680
your entertainment level because it's raw and real and you see changes that are

1048
01:00:00.681 --> 01:00:03.620
unbelievable.
You'll see a,
you know,
a guy that's just come back.

1049
01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:07.280
You know the last thing we did from Afghanistan who shell shock,

1050
01:00:07.281 --> 01:00:09.980
who you know as PTSD can't sleep at night.

1051
01:00:09.981 --> 01:00:13.280
He's got the shivers when he tries to hold the microphone as your hand is

1052
01:00:13.281 --> 01:00:14.980
shaking out of control and he just stands up.

1053
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:17.140
You never know who's going to stand up and you know,

1054
01:00:17.170 --> 01:00:20.870
you see him 45 minutes later and he's not shaking,
you know,

1055
01:00:20.871 --> 01:00:22.400
longer literally take his glasses off.

1056
01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.610
There's a physiological change in him where he can have light sensitivity.

1057
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:29.170
I brought him on CNN.
To give you an example,
just show people what's possible.

1058
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:31.100
You'll see a,
a young woman who's faced,

1059
01:00:31.101 --> 01:00:34.730
has been disfigured and thinks her life is horrific and literally there is a

1060
01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:35.630
transformation her,

1061
01:00:35.631 --> 01:00:39.400
she saw her about six months ago and she's got a relationship for the first time

1062
01:00:39.401 --> 01:00:42.710
I life.
You see a person that has made more money than God,

1063
01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:44.430
who's achieved more than they ever have it in there,

1064
01:00:44.431 --> 01:00:46.880
bored out of their mind and frustrated with their life.

1065
01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:50.610
And you find out that guess what,
you know that solution is not the solution.

1066
01:00:50.611 --> 01:00:54.050
And then you see what they're transformed like afterwards and you participate in

1067
01:00:54.051 --> 01:00:57.980
these processes.
So was just the most intensive individual program that I do.

1068
01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:00.830
And instead of doing it with five or 10,000 people,

1069
01:01:00.831 --> 01:01:04.460
it's the most intimate thing I do when you'd do it with about 1800 2000 people

1070
01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:08.300
and you get to develop family of people in France and all over the world.

1071
01:01:08.301 --> 01:01:10.370
So it's the ultimate,
if you want to transform,

1072
01:01:10.371 --> 01:01:12.170
you want to learn what controls and shapes your life,

1073
01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:15.450
the ultimate of that experience.
And if you make some donation,

1074
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:16.370
I don't know what it is you're in.

1075
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:18.230
<v 2>Let me just tell you,</v>

1076
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:23.230
you donated 10 seats at the 10 k level and actually being matched with another

1077
01:01:23.691 --> 01:01:28.460
10 case.
If you donate a 10,000,
you get to come to day with destiny.

1078
01:01:28.461 --> 01:01:29.900
And Tony,
you've said you'll,

1079
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:33.260
you'll take a photo and spend a few moments with those individuals,

1080
01:01:33.261 --> 01:01:35.130
which are your time is the most precious thing.

1081
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:39.660
And I can say that having done date with destiny myself,
with you,

1082
01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:43.420
I learned more in six days and I learned in four years in Mit.

1083
01:01:43.421 --> 01:01:45.490
It's the most extraordinary experience in my life.

1084
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:51.390
I love you too,
pal.
So,
uh,

1085
01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:56.570
<v 1>guys,
I know you,
uh,
you have,
uh,
worlds to conquer out there and uh,</v>

1086
01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:58.870
the global learning x prize is,

1087
01:01:58.871 --> 01:02:03.871
is really something that has reinvigorated me and in a way that has kind of been

1088
01:02:05.171 --> 01:02:07.630
a longtime coming for me,
I feel.
And I,

1089
01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:11.860
I really feel like for those of you listening who are in any way passionate

1090
01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:14.950
about education and you've been wondering how to pick your shot,

1091
01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:17.470
how to throw that,
that one touchdown pass,

1092
01:02:17.471 --> 01:02:22.140
I really feel like this is an excellent place and it's very time sensitive to

1093
01:02:22.141 --> 01:02:24.480
focus your energy and uh,

1094
01:02:24.481 --> 01:02:29.350
I'm going to be obviously getting behind it as I am and,
uh,
doing some things to,

1095
01:02:29.351 --> 01:02:32.340
to help move the needle.
And uh,

1096
01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:37.200
you can go to [inaudible] dot org if you want to compete plenty of money on the

1097
01:02:37.201 --> 01:02:41.760
line and a glory lasts forever,
right?
So,
so that's one.

1098
01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:45.930
And then if you want to check out the Indiegogo campaign,

1099
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:49.020
I will put the link in the show notes so you can just go to the blog for our

1100
01:02:49.021 --> 01:02:51.960
blog.com and click on podcast and can find the show notes.

1101
01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:56.310
Or you can just go to indiegogo.com and search for x price without a hyphen.

1102
01:02:56.730 --> 01:03:01.680
Before we take off.
Do you gentlemen have any,
any parting comments,

1103
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:06.080
advice,
recommendations,
uh,
restaurant,

1104
01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:07.350
restaurant tips,

1105
01:03:07.351 --> 01:03:10.200
anything at all that you don't have to leave with us before we go?

1106
01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:13.780
<v 3>Something?
Could you see the combination of all three of us and I see it,</v>

1107
01:03:13.781 --> 01:03:17.140
I think you'll see it in anybody that's enjoying their life.
You know,
it's,

1108
01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:20.380
the game never ends for the game of mastery.

1109
01:03:20.381 --> 01:03:24.280
It's about finding a way to do something and do it so well that goes beyond

1110
01:03:24.281 --> 01:03:26.370
yourself.
That if you can find your passion,

1111
01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:28.960
you can find anything you're passionate about and you don't know what it is.

1112
01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:31.150
I think gets getting around people that are really passionate.

1113
01:03:31.151 --> 01:03:33.310
It's getting around where it's better and letting something hit you.

1114
01:03:33.490 --> 01:03:37.340
You can't get around a person like yourself or like Peter and not be touched or

1115
01:03:37.341 --> 01:03:39.370
something inside of you.
It's going to get ignited.

1116
01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:42.040
So if you don't have that passion yet,
they're listening,
you know,

1117
01:03:42.041 --> 01:03:44.890
listening to these podcasts as a way to get some of that proximity.

1118
01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.760
But I'd go pursue putting myself in an environment where you're going to be

1119
01:03:48.761 --> 01:03:51.750
stimulated and if you know what your passion is,
and the question is,

1120
01:03:51.751 --> 01:03:54.150
how can you surround yourself with the best of the best that you can be

1121
01:03:54.151 --> 01:03:56.880
challenged?
Because the idea of on the x prize really is,

1122
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.400
it's not just the incentives,
it's also the challenge.

1123
01:03:59.401 --> 01:04:01.020
It's that competition to say,

1124
01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:05.580
how can I do more in less time for more people than I've ever done in my life?

1125
01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:07.570
And when that becomes your focus,

1126
01:04:07.571 --> 01:04:11.920
something happens to the vibratory rate of the human brain and insights come,

1127
01:04:11.921 --> 01:04:15.280
you start seeing things and the reticular activating system of the brain starts

1128
01:04:15.281 --> 01:04:18.550
finding answers because you have that focus on something larger.

1129
01:04:18.790 --> 01:04:21.700
So if you don't have it,
find it.
And if you don't know how to find it,

1130
01:04:21.701 --> 01:04:25.150
get yourself in environments consistently where people are living it and

1131
01:04:25.151 --> 01:04:27.550
something will hit you.
Wow.

1132
01:04:27.810 --> 01:04:29.310
<v 1>Absolutely.
And that's,
that's,</v>

1133
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:32.490
that's part of the reason that people ask me why I live in Silicon Valley.

1134
01:04:32.491 --> 01:04:35.520
If I could live anywhere.
And that's,
it's,
it's not the tech,

1135
01:04:35.521 --> 01:04:38.280
it's that it's being around the people who believe that they're going to first

1136
01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:41.010
in the world.
Absolutely.
Uh,
Peter,

1137
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:44.960
<v 2>uh,
yeah.
I mean,
uh,
it all begins with passion.</v>

1138
01:04:44.961 --> 01:04:48.950
There is no better teacher mentor on the planet than Tony Robbins when it comes

1139
01:04:48.951 --> 01:04:52.060
down to that for me.
I'll just add on top of that,

1140
01:04:52.110 --> 01:04:56.670
that there is no problem we cannot take on,
you know,

1141
01:04:56.690 --> 01:05:00.080
the world's biggest problems are the world's biggest business opportunities.

1142
01:05:00.081 --> 01:05:02.080
I mean,
which is amazing to think about.
You know,

1143
01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.160
you want to become a billionaire,
help a billion people.

1144
01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:08.270
That convergence and the notion that a single individual to the,

1145
01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:11.420
I don't care who you are in the world where you are in the world,

1146
01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:16.390
you have access to extraordinary capabilities.
You have access to,
you know,

1147
01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:19.690
the world's knowledge and information on Google.
You have access to Ai,

1148
01:05:19.691 --> 01:05:20.530
to cloud printing,

1149
01:05:20.531 --> 01:05:24.910
all these exponential technologies and at the same time you've got access to all

1150
01:05:24.911 --> 01:05:27.040
the expertise you want through crowdsourcing.

1151
01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:30.970
You have capital through crowdfunding.
So my goal here is to say,

1152
01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.720
first and foremost,
connect with your passion that drive that with you,

1153
01:05:34.721 --> 01:05:36.730
and then take your moonshot.

1154
01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:40.590
Where are you going to take and do something significant that gives meaning.

1155
01:05:40.591 --> 01:05:44.640
I love that example you,
you give Tim about how you'll be remembered,
you know,

1156
01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:49.200
two,
300 years from today.
Uh,
so it's an amazing time to be alive.

1157
01:05:49.201 --> 01:05:51.060
It's an amazing time to be an entrepreneur.

1158
01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:55.200
I am thankful to him for who you are in the world and Tony and uh,

1159
01:05:55.290 --> 01:05:56.910
and blessed to be honest conversation with you guys.

1160
01:05:57.980 --> 01:06:01.020
<v 1>Gentlemen,
thank you so much for taking the time.
Uh,
I would,</v>

1161
01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:04.850
wouldn't be really fun to get together in person at some point.

1162
01:06:04.851 --> 01:06:08.690
I know we're on different coasts and constantly flying,
but,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,

1163
01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:12.230
this virtual proximity will do for now and uh,

1164
01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:15.260
everybody check out the x prize.
It is a,

1165
01:06:15.261 --> 01:06:19.310
it is very worthwhile and there are plenty of incentives for every player in the

1166
01:06:19.311 --> 01:06:23.930
game.
And,
uh,
if you're looking for that passion that,
that Peter mentioned,

1167
01:06:23.931 --> 01:06:28.040
and you don't know what that passion is.
As Tony mentioned,

1168
01:06:28.041 --> 01:06:32.450
one of the best ways to get passionate is to be surrounded by people who are

1169
01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:37.480
very passionate and thinking magnitudes of order above the average Joe or Jane

1170
01:06:38.241 --> 01:06:42.200
you may be surrounded by.
And a great way to do that honestly is just a checkout,

1171
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:47.230
even the page that describes this x prize on x prize.org or on Indiegogo.

1172
01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:53.020
And uh,
you might just find that as is the case with me.
Uh,
it's,

1173
01:06:53.021 --> 01:06:55.990
it's just,
uh,
it's PR,
it's provided some,

1174
01:06:55.991 --> 01:07:00.350
some intellectual gasoline and some passion,
uh,
that,
uh,

1175
01:07:00.351 --> 01:07:02.120
that you might not have seen in awhile.

1176
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:06.230
So I think that it's worth checking out and I'll be doing a lot more related to

1177
01:07:06.231 --> 01:07:09.890
it.
So guys,
for the time being,
thanks so much for being on.

1178
01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:13.460
