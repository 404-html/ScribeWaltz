00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.530
The guys.
Tim Ferriss here,

2
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.570
I talk a lot about morning routines on the Tim Ferriss show with 200 plus world

3
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:07.231
class experts.

4
00:00:07.231 --> 00:00:12.231
Now you tend to spot certain patterns and I'm also a fan of experimenting with

5
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:16.020
some of the weirder stuff.
So what do I do at night?

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.000
What is my evening wind down protocol and what do I do if I'm on the road and I

7
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:26.001
don't have something like a sauna or an ice bath or these very space and

8
00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:31.140
resource consuming contraptions that I might want to have,
right?

9
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:34.590
Like the chilly pad not going to travel with the chilly pad even though Rick

10
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.790
Rubin and Laird Hamilton,
all these people,
Kelly Starr at swear by it,
right?

11
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.230
It's a big ass contraption.
So what can you do?

12
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.360
I will show you a few of the tools of the trade as far as I'm concerned that I'm

13
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:50.361
using right now prebid to help me sleep because as someone who's had or had I

14
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:53.910
should say,
and Somnia for decades,

15
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.560
sleep has always been compromised and as a result it is now one of my highest

16
00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:03.390
priorities.
Show you some biochemical goodies.

17
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.160
This is certainly a cheaper version of it,
but this is phosphatidyl serin,

18
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.930
right.
What is this fossil fuel?

19
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.950
Sarian sometimes called P s fossil Sirion was recommended to me by an MD who

20
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.460
noticed that he,
since he was wearing a continuous glucose monitor,

21
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.660
meaning he's not a diabetic,

22
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:26.520
but he was wearing a Dexcom device that's inserted into the skin so that he'd

23
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.030
get a read out on his iPhone at all times.

24
00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:34.050
I'm a graph of his blood glucose and he's having trouble sleeping and what he

25
00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:37.410
realized was because he had so many projects running,

26
00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:40.410
he does a lot more than just handle high end medical clients.

27
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.180
He was having bursts of cortisol at night,

28
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.950
so just when he was trying to go to bed,

29
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:50.490
he'd get a burst of cortisol that would cause the release of glucose,

30
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.230
I suppose by breaking down glycogen in the liver or muscle and

31
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.000
phosphatidylserine specifically.

32
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.990
It's not like an ambient or anything along those lines or a Melatonin,

33
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.610
let's say that's a circadian trigger.

34
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.790
What this is doing is blunting cortisol release.

35
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.330
So by blunting the cortisol release,
taking this before bed,

36
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.920
you then blood the glucose release which causes you to wake up,

37
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.950
like you're having a sugar high in the middle of the night and Lo and behold,

38
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.710
his sleep quality improved.
So I don't use this all the time.

39
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.950
Cortisol is a very important hormone.

40
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:27.080
You don't want to inhibit it completely or you would die.
So,
uh,

41
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.950
occasional use maybe when I'm first getting settled in a new airbnb or hotel

42
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.240
foster [inaudible] very,
very useful.
That is number one.

43
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.600
Number two,
now I won't actually carry this in my bag,

44
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:44.601
but as soon as I land somewhere I will buy one of these or use instacart to get

45
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.180
a bottle.
It depends on how long it would be there,

46
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.080
whether it's large or small of Brag,
raw,

47
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:53.640
unfiltered apple cider vinegar.

48
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.620
And I will have at least one or two tablespoons of this in water when I wake up.

49
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.070
And also when I go to bed,

50
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.900
I cannot explain exactly why this has the affected does.

51
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.080
Just mechanistically,

52
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.920
I don't know how to exactly explain a plausible mechanism,

53
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:14.980
but there are two things that I use is for it.
The first is immune support,

54
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.840
so having apple cider vinegar and also whey protein in the mornings.

55
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.700
Just through some incredibly harrowing book launches and other incredible

56
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:27.490
deadlines.
I've noticed supplements,

57
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.640
anything I might be doing to support my immune system and I just,

58
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:34.390
I get less sick.
Uh,
if I do become sick,

59
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:38.920
it's of less duration and severity.
So apple cider vinegar,
helpful for that.

60
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.790
It would appear.
Also very helpful as a tip from Seth Roberts.

61
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.500
Phd Sadly has passed professor emeritus at uh,

62
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.560
believe it was UC Berkeley who suggested for insomnia,

63
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.830
one tablespoon or two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar,

64
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.880
one tablespoon of raw honey mixed in hot water.
And for,

65
00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:03.400
I'd say eight out of 10 people that just knocks you out.

66
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:08.350
So if I'm really having trouble sleeping,
I'll also use that.
Now,
oddly enough,

67
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.700
you'd think,
well,
wait a second,

68
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.910
if I'm using this to blunt glucose release and then I'm drinking this,

69
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.360
not at the same time,
I don't use these together with honey.

70
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.990
Wouldn't honey also triggered the same type of sugar high for whatever reason,

71
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.910
done 20 or 30 minutes before bed.
It has the opposite effect,
so go figure.

72
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.960
All right,
these are,
these are two now beyond that.
Oh,

73
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:36.460
very frequently do a slant board workout,

74
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.030
which isn't really a workout because I'm really holding it.

75
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.300
It was step on this in different ways.
This is designed by Eric Orton,

76
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:45.640
who became famous from born to run.

77
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.940
This is the Frio Frio year.com Slint born slash wobble board.

78
00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:55.420
I have no connection to this company.
Easy to travel with.
I mean,

79
00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.430
super simple to throw in a bag and I will spend 30 to 60 seconds,

80
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.910
uh,
in different ways,

81
00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:08.800
positioning my foot and improving my stability in the lower leg.

82
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.510
Right?
Super easy to travel with.

83
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.860
I've had a huge ROI on very little exercise doing that.

84
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.550
Then I'm going to do what?
The supple leopard himself,

85
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:19.630
Kelly Star it would recommend.

86
00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:24.631
I've few devices that I use to activate a,

87
00:05:24.901 --> 00:05:28.720
I want to say the parasympathetic.
Am I getting that right to go to bed?

88
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.060
I'm pretty sure it's pressing pathetic.
Maybe it's sympathetic.

89
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.440
I'm sure the Internet will let me know.

90
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.470
But to effectively downregulate my system and help with getting to sleep,

91
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.590
there are few types of soft tissue manipulation that I liked you.

92
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.380
So this is a device from the Rad company,
Rad.

93
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.010
This is from Rad roller.
This is for your back.

94
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.600
You can use it for the legs as well,

95
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:55.340
but you'll notice the spine fits nicely in this little groups.

96
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.070
You're not jacking up,
uh,

97
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.020
your vertebra rolling on something that's too hard and it's very small.

98
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.280
The next is something that I will use just for it band primarily and Vastus

99
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:09.320
lateralis that's on the side of the leg.

100
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.100
So you're really just going to be rolling your legs out like this.

101
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.560
And I will also roll out my hamstrings.

102
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.940
But after a long day of standing and or sitting,
uh,
this is a godsend.

103
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.930
So these knobby knobby tires are from,
uh,

104
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.980
the rumble roller company.

105
00:06:25.981 --> 00:06:27.680
I don't know if that's the name of their parent company.

106
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.350
They're also stands that you can put these in.

107
00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:32.690
They're tiny and you can stick this on the floor and say,

108
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:34.160
roll your feet out on these.

109
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:39.150
But I use this primarily on my thighs and hamstrings.
Uh,

110
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.920
there are many different devices you can find.
If you looked for rolling stick,

111
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.480
you could find other options and you don't have to do necessarily all of these,

112
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:51.380
but I will almost always do at least one of them.
Uh,
prior to bed,

113
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:55.260
my prior to bed,
I mean half hour part of that.
Then this,
what is this?

114
00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.270
This is a deflated ball that you can blow up with your mouth and then lay on so

115
00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:04.190
that it is pressing into your abdominal cavity.

116
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.560
It really just roll around if you don't know what you're.

117
00:07:06.561 --> 00:07:11.561
So as his look that up p s o a s deep deep muscle that is very painful to have

118
00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:15.230
someone work on manually.
Uh,
but you can,

119
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.300
you can really turn your body down a few gears so you can downshift in such a

120
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:23.360
way that is very helpful prior to bed by rolling around in your stomach for

121
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:26.420
literally 30 seconds to 60 seconds.

122
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.260
I find that little to be very helpful.
And then last,

123
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.670
I'm going to show you an APP that I find it very,
very helpful.

124
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.800
And the APP is called apnea trainer.
It's designed for free divers.

125
00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:40.910
I'm not a free diver.

126
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:46.070
I use it just to relax prior to going to bed and then also improves lung

127
00:07:46.071 --> 00:07:46.904
capacity.

128
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:52.090
So that's apnea trainer and you can see I've already set effectively the

129
00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:57.760
duration that I would like to use and there's crony,
I'm breathing.

130
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.060
And then there's a regular

131
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:05.240
apnea training and it's based on your maximum inhaled time.

132
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.560
So this is going to be a little boring for a second,
but you'll get the idea.

133
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.140
So we'll try to make sure he can get the audio.

134
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:17.570
<v 1>Inhale,
five,
four,
three,
two,</v>

135
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.090
one,
hold your breath.

136
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.573
Yeah.

137
00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:38.390
Ten five,

138
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:44.080
four,
three,
two,
one.
Exhale.

139
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:50.370
Ten five,

140
00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:55.950
four,
three,
two,
one.
Inhale,

141
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.720
<v 0>five,
four,
three,
two,
one.</v>

142
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:06.120
Hold your breath.
You get the idea.
And if you do that,

143
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.970
forget about luck.
Meditation's Great.

144
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.640
But for the vast majority of people who are averse to it,

145
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.960
don't think about it that way.

146
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.960
Just think about it as a five minute period of breath work and do say 10 cycles

147
00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:23.760
of that.
Where in this particular case,
uh,
the ratio is one,
four,
two.

148
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.740
So if I breathe in for five seconds,

149
00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:29.190
I'm holding for 20 and then I'm exhaling for 10 and you do that,

150
00:09:29.191 --> 00:09:34.191
especially listening to some hypnotic robotic female voice counting off for you.

151
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.080
You do that for five minutes,

152
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:42.350
your sleep will come a lot faster and a lot harder than it would otherwise.

153
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.590
And a super,
super simple,
I'm not sure how much the APP costs a few dollars.

154
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.620
It's not expensive and that folks is effect in effect,

155
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.680
my little travel yield.

156
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:59.370
So all of these things that I put right here minus this,

157
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:03.450
which I would order a or by when I land or get through instacart or something.

158
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.250
All of this just came out of my suitcase,

159
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:08.970
which is about 20 feet that direction because I just got back from an extended

160
00:10:08.971 --> 00:10:11.550
trip and this was sitting in there.

161
00:10:11.551 --> 00:10:16.551
It is my Goto toolkit for winding down in the evening or end or as a pre bed

162
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.840
ritual.
So there you have it.
Good luck.
Sleep.
