00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.870
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.871 --> 00:00:06.190
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.470
I'm a cybernetic organism,
living tissue.

4
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.403
<v 1>Hello friends.</v>

5
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.160
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

6
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.180
This is by far the most difficult podcast intro that I've ever recorded.

7
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.270
I've already tried to do it six or seven times and have failed,

8
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
so I'm just gonna run with it and the reason for the difficulty will become

9
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:51.750
super clear quickly.
The guest is Terry Laughlin,

10
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.650
who completely changed my life.
He became a friend,
a mentor.

11
00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.520
He taught me how to swim and did it remotely at first through his book,

12
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.950
total immersion when I was in my thirties and fixing that helped me do address

13
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.690
one of my lifelong,

14
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.870
largest insecurities and something that really caused a lot of humiliation for

15
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.240
which was growing up on long island,
being close to water,

16
00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:19.950
having a few traumatic experiences,

17
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.390
and never learning to swim until my thirties and Terry,

18
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.110
you can learn all about total immersion everywhere.
Just search,
total immersion,

19
00:01:28.111 --> 00:01:32.040
swimming,
total immersion.net t I swim on Twitter,
et Cetera,

20
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.860
is really a revolutionary way of learning and teaching.

21
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.780
And he was introduced to me,

22
00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:42.810
or the method total immersion was introduced to me by Chris Sacca,

23
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.300
who's another friend who's been on the podcast,

24
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.400
billionaire investor all around hilarious and,
uh,

25
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.750
intelligent guy who said to me at a barbecue,

26
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:58.860
I have the answer to your prayers as it related to not being able to swim.

27
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.580
And it turned out to be Terry Laughlin and total immersion.

28
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:07.581
The reason this is so hard is that I grew to really care for Terry and we did

29
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:11.730
this interview October 2nd.

30
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.740
Terry had at that time metastasize pancreatic cancer.

31
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.990
Uh,
that was October 2nd.
On October 10th,

32
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.000
he had a stroke and was hospitalized.

33
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.770
And then on October 20th,
10 days later,
he passed away.

34
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.730
I just found out about this yesterday afternoon,
uh,

35
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.830
after getting back from being off the grid,

36
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.910
I turned on my phone and a barrage of texts came in.

37
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.640
And the first one that I saw was from a friend who said,

38
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.260
did you see the news about Terry?

39
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.370
And that makes this what you're about to hear the last long form interview the

40
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:51.540
Terry ever did in his life.

41
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.720
And it's intended to be inspiring and to showcase a tactically in sincere

42
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.760
teacher,
he developed 24 national champions,

43
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.500
but then turned his eye to the adult population.

44
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.070
People who had given up on themselves,
who had accepted partial completeness,

45
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:19.000
who thought that learning to swim or x,
Y,
and Z,

46
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:23.320
whatever you might have in your mind was impossible and taught them to overcome

47
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:25.090
that.
And

48
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.920
I really view him as the epitome of what I tried to do myself as a teacher.

49
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.690
Whether it is looking at accelerated learning or deconstructing something,

50
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:41.830
logically sequencing it,
he cares so fucking much.

51
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.890
And that will come across in this interview even if you don't care about

52
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:52.000
swimming at all.
I encourage you to listen to this for a few different reasons.

53
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.020
Number one,
this is like I said,

54
00:03:56.021 --> 00:04:00.190
the last long form interview Terry did in his life.
And when you listen to this,

55
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.180
you will hear that he is,

56
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.010
it sounds incredibly vibrant and was,

57
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.540
uh,
what I also did a,

58
00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:15.130
and I owe a sincere thanks to his family for sending this to me.

59
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.213
Uh,

60
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.220
it was included audio at the end of the interview and these are clips that,

61
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.400
uh,
within the first few days after his stroke in the hospital.

62
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.770
So a week before he died or so his daughter's Fiona,

63
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.550
Carrie and Betsy,
uh,
recorded audio,

64
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.060
interviewed him following his stroke,
uh,

65
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.090
because he was extremely focused the entire time on the mission of finishing his

66
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.860
current book.
Uh,

67
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.880
so they were asking him questions and pulling out these philosophies of life and

68
00:04:57.431 --> 00:05:02.431
so on in this environment of hospitalized medicine where you have beepers and

69
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:07.270
you have footsteps and have staff moving around.

70
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.730
And I want you to listen to it because it's fucking heart wrenching.

71
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.970
And I want you to surrender yourself to that sadness and to let it envelop you

72
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:22.540
and to really listen to it.

73
00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:26.410
It's not intended to impart a ton of super tactical information.

74
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:31.411
It's intended to make you feel just how painful it is to have time running out.

75
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.160
And I want you to ask yourselves,

76
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.190
because I've written five books now and many people have changed their lives by

77
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.860
testing assumptions and finally doing the things that they have put off,

78
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.270
whether it's quitting something,
starting something,
taking a trip,

79
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.770
forming a company,
quitting a job,
ending a relationship,
proposing to someone,

80
00:05:57.771 --> 00:06:00.560
whatever it might be.
I've seen that,

81
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:05.561
but I've also seen thousands of people sitting on the sidelines with the a

82
00:06:06.221 --> 00:06:07.960
deferred life plan of some type,

83
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.140
something that they are deferring to someday when it's going to be more

84
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:15.110
convenient,
which it never will be.
Generally speaking,

85
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:17.930
there is never a good time to do the things that are most important.

86
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.060
And so I want you to listen not only to the interview but to the clips at the

87
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:28.061
end there were recorded in the hospital because I want you to extremely acutely

88
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.790
feel in your viscera.

89
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.830
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

90
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.220
<v 1>The reality,
which is we are not guaranteed</v>

91
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.190
a long life and I've had several friends die in the last year.

92
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:44.960
I don't know what's going around in the air,

93
00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:47.040
but several friends die in the last year,

94
00:06:47.041 --> 00:06:51.980
a young and old and people do not die of old age.
They die of disease,

95
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.790
they die of accident,
they die from violence.

96
00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.880
There are so many things that you can take you out before you think your

97
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:05.510
lifespan will end.
So hopefully this interview,

98
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.540
this conversation with the incredible Terry Laughlin can serve as a catalyst for

99
00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:16.031
you to get up off your ass physically or metaphorically speaking and do what it

100
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:24.731
is you really want to do so that you don't die with a bucket list of things that

101
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:27.020
have not been checked off.

102
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.560
And that certainly was not Terry Terry squeezed every drop out of his life up

103
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:38.600
until the very,
very last moments.
And you get to hear some of those moments.

104
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.960
So this

105
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.410
<v 0>yeah</v>

106
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.310
<v 1>is really surreal for me and</v>

107
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:49.920
<v 0>okay,</v>

108
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.890
<v 1>I miss him already.
Uh,
so Terry,</v>

109
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.970
thank you for changing my life and uh,

110
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.140
I hope you're swimming far and wide up in heaven.
Uh,

111
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.220
and you know,
he,

112
00:08:05.221 --> 00:08:08.520
he kept in good spirits until the very,

113
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.030
very closing bell and a,

114
00:08:12.031 --> 00:08:15.930
there's actually a piece in outside magazine written by Christie Aschwanden.

115
00:08:15.931 --> 00:08:17.490
I hope I'm getting the pronunciation right.

116
00:08:17.491 --> 00:08:21.690
Who's a lead or the lead science writer at five 38.

117
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:27.070
And,
uh,
she describes how at,

118
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.780
at the very end,
even at that,

119
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.760
the last time that his daughter Fiona saw him laugh,

120
00:08:32.761 --> 00:08:37.350
was him telling this joke about baseball because he loved baseball.
And He,

121
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:41.220
and the joke related to two friends who had a pact and the first of them to die

122
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:44.280
and would return to tell the other whether there was baseball and heaven.

123
00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:46.590
So the first guy dies and he appears to his friend.

124
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.830
The good news he says is that there's baseball in heaven.

125
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.660
The bad news is that you're pitching tomorrow.
Terry thought that was hilarious.

126
00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:00.650
And he was able to find the glimmers of hope and optimism even when he was

127
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.380
literally on his deathbed.

128
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:12.720
So for the things that you want to do for the things you feel compelled to do,

129
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:17.490
the things that you've dreamed of for so long,
what is your excuse

130
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.620
for not doing them?
Think about it very,

131
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:27.240
very carefully and meditate on it because we're all going to die.

132
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.440
It's just a question of when and um,
in any case,
uh,

133
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.720
my apologies for the long introduction,

134
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:38.750
this has been really difficult for me and this is the best job I can do it with

135
00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:40.260
this one guys.

136
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.260
So please enjoy this wide ranging conversation with none other than the

137
00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:50.460
incredible much beloved and much missed.
Terry Laughlin.

138
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:57.470
Terry,
welcome to the show.
Thank you for having me on,
Tim.

139
00:09:57.471 --> 00:10:00.200
I've really wanted to do this for quite a while.
Well,

140
00:10:00.201 --> 00:10:02.360
I've wanted to have you on for many,

141
00:10:02.361 --> 00:10:07.361
many years and I thought I would start before we get into,

142
00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.140
uh,
the backstory and a,

143
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.260
there's so many different things that we should cover in this conversation.

144
00:10:15.261 --> 00:10:20.261
But I think the most sensible place for a lot of my listeners is where I came in

145
00:10:22.191 --> 00:10:25.130
contact with total immersion.

146
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.160
And I should start by saying,

147
00:10:28.161 --> 00:10:31.490
I grew up on long island for those people who don't know that has to die.

148
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.420
And a,
I was a townie out,
uh,

149
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:39.500
in Easthampton of all places,
worked in the lobster rolls,
a bus points on,

150
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:45.010
and I was minutes from the beach my whole life and never learned how to swim

151
00:10:45.021 --> 00:10:48.260
properly until my thirties.

152
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.260
And the,

153
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.950
I suppose the trigger for preventing me to swim,

154
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.760
we're a handful of near drowning experiences,
one at a summer camp.

155
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.390
And,
uh,
it's,

156
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:07.420
it was always one of my largest sources of embarrassment and,

157
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.860
uh,
one of my greatest insecurities.
And then something happened.

158
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.450
And what happened was,
uh,
this was several,
of course,
several years ago now,

159
00:11:17.451 --> 00:11:21.890
I just turned 40,
but at the end of a January,

160
00:11:21.891 --> 00:11:26.030
I want to say in,
I'm not exactly sure when it was,

161
00:11:26.031 --> 00:11:28.820
2007,
2008 around there,

162
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:34.670
a friend and I decided to issue each other new year's resolutions because we

163
00:11:35.811 --> 00:11:38.300
realized that without someone to hold you accountable,

164
00:11:38.301 --> 00:11:41.810
very little tends to get done with New Year's resolutions.

165
00:11:41.811 --> 00:11:45.650
So Chris Ashenden,
who's known as the Kiwi,

166
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.070
because he's from New Zealand,
uh,

167
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:53.140
said that I had to finish an open water one kilometer and that was going to be

168
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:57.850
in 2008.
So it must have been the very beginning in 2008.

169
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.940
And I then challenged him to go a year without coffee or stimulants,

170
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:04.750
uh,

171
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:09.750
because he fed himself a different types of stimulants to stay awake and then

172
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:14.260
didn't use to boost,
to go to sleep and so on,
which is very,
very normal.
Uh,

173
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.140
but I failed is the short story.
I,
uh,

174
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.940
I at least in the first say half or three quarters of the year,
tried kickboards,

175
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.200
barely moved at all.
And it was extremely humiliating.

176
00:12:26.201 --> 00:12:29.230
And I left a number of classes,
hand paddles,
tried those.

177
00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.680
My shoulders felt like they were going to break,
uh,

178
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.870
which led me to believe that swimming could not be low impact and I'd

179
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.700
effectively conceded defeat.

180
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:44.140
And then I met someone named Chris Saka for the first time who's been on this

181
00:12:44.141 --> 00:12:48.880
podcast and uh,
he is now a very,

182
00:12:48.881 --> 00:12:50.500
very famous investor.

183
00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:54.790
At the time he was just starting his sort of ascension,

184
00:12:54.791 --> 00:12:59.140
his hockey stick,
and he was training for a triathlon.

185
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.730
And we met at a barbecue,
uh,
organized by a guy named Kevin Rose,

186
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.740
who was the first episode of this podcast.

187
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.180
And I told him about how I was failing with swimming when he asked me what I was

188
00:13:10.181 --> 00:13:13.390
up to.
I didn't start there,
but we got there and he said,

189
00:13:13.391 --> 00:13:18.310
I have the answer to your prayers.
It revolutionized how I,
how I,

190
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:22.780
how I swim.
And that's,
that was his,
this was opening sales pitch.

191
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.040
And that's what got me to Tii and total immersion.

192
00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.900
And in the span of,
I'd say around,
you know,

193
00:13:31.901 --> 00:13:36.580
between seven to 10 days with a book,

194
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.980
and this is without even the video,
uh,

195
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:44.040
went from about a one to two length maximum and swimming in a small kind of home

196
00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:50.941
pool to more than 40 lengths per workout in sets of two to four.

197
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.270
And now fast forward,

198
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.010
I swim for relaxation.

199
00:13:57.011 --> 00:14:00.800
And part of how I chose where I wanted to live a,

200
00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.130
here we're recording in Austin,

201
00:14:03.131 --> 00:14:08.080
Texas was its proximity to swimming,
which just is insane.

202
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:13.090
If you were to try to express that to my say 15 year old self,

203
00:14:13.091 --> 00:14:16.180
20 year old self,
even 30 year old self.
So thank you.

204
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:17.920
That's a very long winded intro.

205
00:14:17.921 --> 00:14:22.630
But I wanted to give people the context because as Chris,

206
00:14:22.631 --> 00:14:26.170
my friend pointed out,
it's a,
it's a life skill.

207
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:31.200
It's not just a throwaway decorative skill.

208
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.780
And every time I was on a boat,
I had low grade anxiety.

209
00:14:34.781 --> 00:14:37.420
Every time I was near water or going into water,

210
00:14:37.421 --> 00:14:39.700
I had low grade anxiety and I no longer have that.

211
00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.910
So thank you very kindly,
sir.

212
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.500
That's so certainly I'm most gratified.
Uh,

213
00:14:47.501 --> 00:14:51.770
and uh,
let me just,
I'll bet I'll bet you're familiar with deep eddy pool.

214
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:57.230
<v 2>I am familiar with deep eddy pool and just down the road from the Magnolia Cafe,</v>

215
00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:01.630
which is run by your friends and um,

216
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:06.710
and Barton springs to wonderful places.
I love to swim when I visited Austin

217
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:11.630
and enjoy themselves.
Is it,
that's,
that's the best part.

218
00:15:11.631 --> 00:15:13.310
It's not that you can swim one k,

219
00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:17.270
but that you can take advantage of these lovely swimming holes that are really

220
00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:20.690
unique places and,
uh,
in a,
in a complete way.

221
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:21.590
<v 1>And,</v>

222
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:26.570
and to do it as something that I enjoy.
I mean,

223
00:15:26.571 --> 00:15:29.530
it's something that I seek out.
And uh,

224
00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.630
I actually wanted to talk to you more about a couple of plans I have for

225
00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:35.990
swimming after this podcast perhaps.

226
00:15:35.991 --> 00:15:38.810
But the punchline also,

227
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.600
I didn't provide for people,

228
00:15:41.601 --> 00:15:46.601
so I improved my swimming and then I was not able to find an open water race

229
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.090
that was one kilometer.

230
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:54.740
So instead I swim open water in the ocean on Long Island,

231
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.320
on the beach where I grew up going.

232
00:15:57.321 --> 00:16:00.470
But really going up to kind of my waste most of the time,

233
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.840
and simply went off shore after asking a lifeguard how far away a given house

234
00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:09.800
was and swam parallel to shore in the ocean,

235
00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:14.450
which is pretty murky on that side of things.
Pretty Sharkey too.

236
00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:17.600
And Swim,
uh,
almost a mile.

237
00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:21.020
So that's a lot longer than one kilometer.

238
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:26.030
And probably the most successful I've ever felt in my entire life.

239
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.900
<v 2>And that is,
that is there put two in really rarefied company,
Tim.
I mean,</v>

240
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:36.080
there are not very many people who can swim a mile in a pool,

241
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:40.820
but to swim a mile and an ocean and it really,
really takes it up another notch.

242
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:44.480
Uh,
only only 2% is a pretty,
uh,

243
00:16:44.481 --> 00:16:49.400
pretty authoritative estimate that only 2% of American adults can swim as much

244
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.810
as a quarter mile nonstop.

245
00:16:50.811 --> 00:16:53.870
So you're in rarefied company swimming a mile in the ocean?

246
00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.370
<v 1>Well,
I've,
I've lot of room to improve,</v>

247
00:16:57.371 --> 00:17:02.371
but I think that the example of swimming is one for me of a partial completeness

248
00:17:06.581 --> 00:17:11.550
that I accepted and it was an assumption.
Iee,

249
00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:12.730
I can't swim.

250
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.170
I don't swim that I didn't test for very,

251
00:17:17.171 --> 00:17:22.120
very long time and many people accept partial complete,
whether it's being,

252
00:17:22.121 --> 00:17:25.180
say overweight.
Well that's just the way it is.
That's just the way I am.

253
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.530
I'm good at some things.
I'm just not able to lose weight,
whatever it might be.

254
00:17:29.531 --> 00:17:33.730
Or in this case,
say swimming or playing basketball,
it could be anything.

255
00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:35.290
A learning to read.

256
00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:40.320
And I wanted to ask you about just to give an example of how late you can test

257
00:17:42.551 --> 00:17:46.930
the assumptions assumptions.
Uh,
Paul Lorrie or Lorrie,

258
00:17:46.931 --> 00:17:49.970
I guess it is called Laurie.
Yeah.
You're Paul.

259
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:50.400
<v 3>Laurie.</v>

260
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.290
Can you explain for the people listening who Paul Lawrie is?

261
00:17:55.291 --> 00:17:59.190
Dr. Paul [inaudible].
Paul is a pretty amazing person.
Um,

262
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:02.200
to give you an idea,
he retired from,
uh,
he,

263
00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:07.300
he was one of the real pioneering pediatric cardiologists in,

264
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.790
in,
in the field of medicine.
[inaudible].
He was a giant in the field.

265
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:14.790
Um,
and uh,

266
00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:19.791
he retired from practice as a pediatric cardiologist at age 68 and moved to all

267
00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:25.320
knee from,
from Los Angeles,
uh,

268
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:29.340
to be close to his daughter.
Uh,
and this is an age 68,

269
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.480
and for the next 25 years,
uh,

270
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.970
he was an emeritus professor at Albany Medical College.

271
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.980
So he taught his final seminar in pediatric cardiology at the age of 93,

272
00:18:40.981 --> 00:18:44.310
which will give you an idea of how unusual he is.

273
00:18:44.311 --> 00:18:49.311
He moved to Newpaltz where I live and into a senior living center called

274
00:18:50.161 --> 00:18:54.600
woodland pond.
And it had a pool,
uh,
it not only had a pool,
it had a,

275
00:18:54.601 --> 00:18:57.690
it had a chorus.
It had,
uh,
a woodshop.

276
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:02.700
And Paul just decided he was going to take complete advantage of everything that

277
00:19:02.701 --> 00:19:07.230
they had there.
And he had never been very serious about swimming in his life.

278
00:19:07.231 --> 00:19:11.850
So,
uh,
he ordered one of our DVDs at age 93,

279
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.600
and,
and taught himself a pretty serviceable freestyle.
Uh,

280
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.460
and then,
uh,
at,
at 94,
he not happened to knock on our door.

281
00:19:20.461 --> 00:19:24.990
We have an endless pool in our basement.
Uh,
we,
we call it the swim studio,

282
00:19:24.991 --> 00:19:27.660
and we teach,
we teach people from all over the world.

283
00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.660
And a Alyse answered the door.
My wife,

284
00:19:30.661 --> 00:19:34.560
Alice answered the door and she said this,
uh,

285
00:19:34.561 --> 00:19:36.750
this very slight,
um,

286
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:42.510
man drew himself up and says,
I'm Dr. Paul Laurie,

287
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:45.900
can someone here teach me in effortless butterfly?

288
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:55.140
So Alice told me about it and our daughter Betsy was going to teach the lesson.

289
00:19:55.141 --> 00:19:59.630
So I showed up,
I had to watch this and I saw a pulse,
one free stomps,

290
00:19:59.631 --> 00:20:04.260
pretty nice.
Uh,
and then he tried a few strokes of backstroke,

291
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.720
a butterfly,
excuse me.
And,
uh,

292
00:20:06.721 --> 00:20:10.920
after watching him swim for about 10 seconds,
I,
I said,
Paul,

293
00:20:10.921 --> 00:20:15.900
I think your net,
your second stroke should be backstroke.
And,
and I,
I said,

294
00:20:15.901 --> 00:20:19.050
I'll offer,
I offered him the ultimate senior discount.

295
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.340
I'll come to the pool at woodland pond at no charge,
uh,
and teach you.

296
00:20:23.341 --> 00:20:27.300
And I ended up teaching him about three or four lessons.
And,
uh,

297
00:20:27.301 --> 00:20:30.270
when he was 95,
uh,
we shot,

298
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.480
we shot a video of Poland ice swimming together.

299
00:20:33.481 --> 00:20:38.070
We were doing what we call sync swimming,
where I synchronize my stroke to his,

300
00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:39.990
and I posed the question on the video,

301
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.950
can you tell which swimmer is 62 in which is 95?

302
00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.900
Because we looked at identical and just exactly alike.

303
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.430
Uh,
and I was so proud of him,
uh,
and to,

304
00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:58.390
to take this a little further,
uh,
November,
November 18th,

305
00:20:58.391 --> 00:21:02.290
I will be attending his hundredth birthday party and he's still swimming 20

306
00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:04.810
lengths a day.
Wow.
Yeah.

307
00:21:04.811 --> 00:21:07.390
So it's never too late to start.

308
00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:12.210
<v 1>And,
uh,
so I mean,
it's such a wonderful,</v>

309
00:21:12.211 --> 00:21:14.670
I only knew about 10% of that story.

310
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.850
I definitely didn't know about me showing up at the door.

311
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.490
I'm Dr. Paul Lori,

312
00:21:20.491 --> 00:21:24.450
can you teach me in effortless butterflies?

313
00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:29.460
<v 3>Amazing.
It was freestyle and backstroke cats.
He's happy with those two strokes.</v>

314
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:34.070
Now I'll tell you something else.
It's really remarkable about Paul.

315
00:21:34.071 --> 00:21:36.410
So he took his first lesson at 94.

316
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:39.430
He was still gaining speed at 97.

317
00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.300
I don't know if there's another example,
uh,

318
00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:46.430
in physical capability of someone improving,

319
00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:50.280
proving between 80 and 96 and 97.
The way,

320
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.180
the way he timed it was he swam at 20 length routine,

321
00:21:53.181 --> 00:21:57.850
which he continues to this day,
uh,
in,
in the 50 foot pool at,
uh,

322
00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:00.180
uh,
at woodland [inaudible].

323
00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:04.250
He does a 20 line routine where he swims to free to labs and free and one of

324
00:22:04.251 --> 00:22:08.720
back until he's done 20 lanes.
And his time for that 20 lane through teen,

325
00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:14.240
uh,
in improved incredibly,
uh,
in the first year or so,

326
00:22:14.241 --> 00:22:17.630
but it was still getting faster,
uh,
between,

327
00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:22.280
between age 96 and 97.
In fact,
the day he went,
he improved his time.

328
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:27.370
At 97,
I got a,
I got a text message from his,

329
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:32.590
his friend Marilyn Bell,
who's,
Oh,
another fantastic story,
um,
over,

330
00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.710
uh,
and,
and she said,
uh,

331
00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:38.240
Paul improved I think is his time.

332
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:42.860
I think improved it from 13 minutes and change to 1253,

333
00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:48.090
uh,
this morning.
Uh,
and,
uh,
you know,
so I,

334
00:22:48.091 --> 00:22:51.050
I immediately texted back to both of them saying how,

335
00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.970
how thrilled I was about that.

336
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:58.220
And then Paul Paul texted me back and he says,
yes,

337
00:22:58.221 --> 00:23:00.980
I went in with a plan to improve my time.

338
00:23:00.981 --> 00:23:05.981
Now how many people are going to the pool at age 97 with a plan to a plan and a

339
00:23:06.621 --> 00:23:10.100
strategy to improve his time?
And his,

340
00:23:10.101 --> 00:23:14.900
his strategy was that he was going to swim even more quietly than before and you

341
00:23:14.901 --> 00:23:18.650
go faster by swimming more quietly.
I mean,
it's just the,
uh,

342
00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:23.660
the whole unexpected nature of what he did and the unexpected nature of his

343
00:23:23.661 --> 00:23:27.620
strategy.
A very great,
cool story.

344
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.840
<v 1>You personally start swimming?</v>

345
00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:36.700
<v 3>Uh,
yes.
Uh,
well,
my dad started may when I was about eight or nine.
And,
uh,
my,</v>

346
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:41.240
my very first serious swimming experience was,

347
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:45.950
was swimming,
uh,
at bar beach on long island.
You were on the south shore?

348
00:23:45.951 --> 00:23:48.950
I was on the north shore.
So,
uh,

349
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:53.780
in Hempstead harbor on long island sound a bar beach.
And they had,

350
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:57.560
they had,
uh,
a raft anchored I would guess,

351
00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:02.420
maybe 30 feet off shore,
10 yards or so.
And,
uh,

352
00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:07.250
I used to watch with,
with great Nda,
I used to watch my dad swim out to the,

353
00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:12.470
uh,
to the,
to the raft and beyond.
And,
uh,

354
00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:13.160
he would,

355
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.970
he would come back and he would have me do dead man's float and move my arms in

356
00:24:16.971 --> 00:24:20.990
circles.
And,
uh,
and I would sort of practice in the shallows.

357
00:24:20.991 --> 00:24:24.170
And then one day I just screwed up my courage and decided I was going to make a

358
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:28.160
try for the,
for the raft.
And I,
you know,

359
00:24:28.161 --> 00:24:33.140
swam as we all do.
When we take that first swim in deep water,

360
00:24:33.141 --> 00:24:37.820
which is frantically,
and,
uh,
I got to the raft,

361
00:24:37.821 --> 00:24:42.350
gratefully pulled myself out,
and then Cole's a lifeguard to bring me back,

362
00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:47.360
escort me back safely as my mother tells me.
Um,

363
00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:51.950
so that was my start.
And then I,
uh,
uh,
a pool open.

364
00:24:51.951 --> 00:24:56.890
We didn't have a pool at that time in Williston park where I grew up.
And,
uh,

365
00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.750
they opened the pool in 1963 when I was 12,

366
00:24:59.751 --> 00:25:04.751
and I took the Red Cross swimmer course and got my Red Cross swimmer that Aj and

367
00:25:04.761 --> 00:25:07.760
joined the,
the pool,
the swim team at the pool.

368
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:11.900
And then in eighth grade,
uh,
at Saint Aidens school,

369
00:25:11.901 --> 00:25:14.030
my Catholic Grammar School,
I,
uh,

370
00:25:14.031 --> 00:25:18.650
they announced to try out for the swimming team and there is not a lower,

371
00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.700
more grass roots level of swimming than Catholic diocese and

372
00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.760
diocese and once a once a year meet.

373
00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:30.430
So they were going to have a few practices and then swim in the diocese and

374
00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:35.090
annual neat.
So I tried out,
I didn't even have to swim the length of the pool.

375
00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.870
It was the width of the Farmingdale community college,

376
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:43.940
a six lane pool.
And uh,
when I,
when I got across the pool,

377
00:25:43.941 --> 00:25:46.280
there was a coach in full clothing,
uh,

378
00:25:46.281 --> 00:25:50.870
in the water next to me who had jumped in,
jumped into a Skorton knee across,

379
00:25:50.871 --> 00:25:54.320
not sure I would make it under my own power.
So needless to say,

380
00:25:54.321 --> 00:25:59.040
I didn't make the cut,
not in what's fishes start.
Uh,

381
00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:03.020
and the guy who cut me is still still alive,
a friend of my parents and,
uh,

382
00:26:03.021 --> 00:26:07.910
and we still laugh about that
suit,
but,
uh,
but then I,

383
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:11.190
I,
uh,
they had the Red Cross,
uh,

384
00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:15.410
50 miles swim chart at the pool as all pools did in those days.

385
00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.670
And you could get a badge for,
for swimming 50 miles.

386
00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:24.830
And I had 11 weeks in the summer too,
to swim 50 miles,
who at age 13,

387
00:26:24.831 --> 00:26:26.750
I decided I was going to earn that night.

388
00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:31.730
I discovered I really love the solitude of doing laps and I,
I,

389
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:36.500
you know,
just through doing the laps to earn the 50 mile badge,
which I did,

390
00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.290
uh,
I turned myself into an okay swimmer.

391
00:26:39.291 --> 00:26:44.100
Certainly not one with any sort of the fishing technique,
but,
but one who could,

392
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.280
could swim a mile a day.
Not many people can.

393
00:26:47.281 --> 00:26:51.600
And I managed to turn myself into a mile a day swimmer at age 13.

394
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:57.210
<v 1>So let's,
let's flash forward and we can certainly pick up anything in between.</v>

395
00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:02.190
But if we look at say 1972,
uh,

396
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:03.930
so you,
at that time,

397
00:27:03.931 --> 00:27:08.370
my understanding is begin coaching at the US Merchant Marine Academy.
Correct.

398
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.140
And,
uh,

399
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:15.170
it was there that you had an epiphany or sort of observed something that would,

400
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:20.550
that would later very much influence your teaching style.
Uh,
can,

401
00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.590
can you tell us about what,

402
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.450
what you learned while You were coaching?

403
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:30.370
<v 3>Yeah,
this is,
it's,
it's such,
it's,
it's a,</v>

404
00:27:30.371 --> 00:27:34.020
a foreshadowing and an unbelievable for shadowing of,

405
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:38.160
of how I would spend the next 40 odd years.
Um,
you know,

406
00:27:38.161 --> 00:27:39.450
first of all to preface it,

407
00:27:39.451 --> 00:27:44.451
I have to take note that I had swam for eight years before I became a coach.

408
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:49.560
Uh,
and I was,
I was a very hardworking,
very frustrated swimmer.

409
00:27:49.561 --> 00:27:50.970
And during those eight years,

410
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:56.480
I can remember one occasion when a coach said anything to me about technique.

411
00:27:56.751 --> 00:28:01.590
So I got you.
If,
you know,
if,
if you take your cues from what your coaches do,

412
00:28:01.591 --> 00:28:05.430
they put workouts on the board and then said,
ready,
go.
Uh,

413
00:28:05.431 --> 00:28:10.410
and nobody said a word about technique except for this one time where the,

414
00:28:10.411 --> 00:28:13.290
where the Co,
the one of my coaches said,
Laughlin,

415
00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.590
you'll never swim fast if you don't move your arms slower.

416
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:21.750
That was the Lva input I got because I was just,

417
00:28:21.751 --> 00:28:25.830
I was such a high turnover swimmer and I,
you know,
as far as I knew,

418
00:28:25.831 --> 00:28:30.240
how else do you swim fast except by moving your arms faster.
So,

419
00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.730
um,
so I had gone through eight years with,

420
00:28:32.731 --> 00:28:34.770
not a word about technique except that one time.

421
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.750
And then I was the coach of the,
the Merchant Marine Academy.

422
00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:44.751
I think I had 12 men and a four lane pool and I gave them a garden variety

423
00:28:45.091 --> 00:28:50.091
warmup of 800 yards and freestyle takes about 10 to 12 minutes to do.

424
00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:55.260
And I watched them from the end of the pool and it's the first time I'm ever

425
00:28:55.261 --> 00:28:57.360
watching swimmers and you know,

426
00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:01.980
where I'm in in the situation or the responsibility,
uh,
of,

427
00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.160
of well being responsible for their performance.

428
00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:09.720
And I must've been watching with a keener eye than I ever had before because I

429
00:29:09.721 --> 00:29:13.230
noticed that every swimmer in the pool was asymmetrical.

430
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:18.530
Those who breathe to the left Torque and twisted in that direction and those who

431
00:29:18.721 --> 00:29:21.930
breathes to the right.
Likewise.
Um,

432
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:27.210
and it just occurred to me that,
you know,
if the object is to move to the,

433
00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:31.890
to,
to the other end by presumably by as laser line,

434
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:36.960
that it's not good in every single stroke to be diverting momentum and energy

435
00:29:36.961 --> 00:29:40.830
off to the side.
So I went home that night pondering what I'd,

436
00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:45.110
what I'd seen and what I might do about it.
And I decided that the next morning,

437
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.430
the next day for warmup,
uh,

438
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:53.230
we were gonna I was going to ask them since it was re related to their
breathing.

439
00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:57.760
I,
I gave him 800 yards of freestyle,
but I said,
I,

440
00:29:57.761 --> 00:29:59.800
I'd like you all to breathe on the wrong side.

441
00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.690
And because we all start our swimming with a right side,

442
00:30:04.691 --> 00:30:08.950
it was aside on which we are naturally more comfortable and the other side,

443
00:30:08.951 --> 00:30:13.150
we don't breathe to it because it feels more awkward.
And uncomfortable.

444
00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:18.340
So for the next 10 to 12 minutes,
I had a markedly more symmetrical team.

445
00:30:18.341 --> 00:30:20.620
And I said,
that can't be a bad thing.

446
00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:24.220
I didn't know the first thing about biomechanics at the time.

447
00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:29.670
It just seemed evident to me aesthetically that anything that moved you straight

448
00:30:30.731 --> 00:30:35.710
ahead was better than something that kept diverting you to the side.
And I,

449
00:30:35.711 --> 00:30:35.991
you know,

450
00:30:35.991 --> 00:30:40.991
I was just so gratified by the positive response to my first seat of the pants

451
00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:47.610
experiment in stroke work that I thought I'm just going to carry on.

452
00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:52.360
Uh,
and I did and it was,
it was not difficult,
you know,

453
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.700
and I had never been an assistant coach.

454
00:30:54.701 --> 00:30:59.230
I had never taken a coaching course or anything even remotely related to sports

455
00:30:59.231 --> 00:31:03.380
science or swimming or biomechanics or any of that.
Uh,

456
00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.520
but I really trusted my aesthetic judgment.

457
00:31:06.521 --> 00:31:10.690
I trusted that what looked good was good.
And I had,

458
00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.250
I had an example of that.

459
00:31:12.251 --> 00:31:15.820
I had a four lane pool and there was a hierarchy where the fast swimmers were in

460
00:31:15.821 --> 00:31:18.730
lane one and the slow swimmers are in lane four.

461
00:31:18.731 --> 00:31:22.690
And as I cast my eye across the pool,
the swimmers in lane one,

462
00:31:22.691 --> 00:31:26.680
the fast swimmers looked more taller in the water.

463
00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:30.310
They look longer as they stroked and they were markedly smoother.

464
00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:35.680
And the swimmers in lane four were shorter and more choppy and more rough.

465
00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.980
And I thought,
I'm just going to experiment with,

466
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:42.880
with them and try different things to see if I can make them look more like the

467
00:31:42.881 --> 00:31:45.530
swimmers in lane one.
And uh,

468
00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:49.120
another interesting thing happened when I started engaging with them and as I

469
00:31:49.121 --> 00:31:49.954
said,

470
00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:54.960
the coaching I got was all ready go coaching where the coach would give you a

471
00:31:55.091 --> 00:31:59.500
set that lasted 30 minutes and then just sit and watch you.
But when I was,

472
00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:01.640
when I was working with them on technique,
I,

473
00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:05.860
I was engaging with them in a much more intimate manner.

474
00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:06.820
Uh,

475
00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:11.820
and I pretty quickly noticed that there was another difference between movement

476
00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:16.900
form,
between quality of form,
uh,
and speed,

477
00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:21.400
which was that kings point was a little bit different from a lot of colleges and

478
00:32:21.401 --> 00:32:24.340
that there were no athletic scholarships.
Uh,

479
00:32:24.341 --> 00:32:28.590
and so your reason for swimming came down to you.
Got,

480
00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:34.020
you got excused from an unwelcome unpleasant duties like lake cleaning out the

481
00:32:35.591 --> 00:32:39.320
latrine and marching and reviews and stuff like that during the,

482
00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.060
during the length of the season,
uh,
or,
or you really wanted to swim.

483
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:49.040
Uh,
and I,
I,
so there was a big overlap between want to swim,

484
00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:50.031
uh,

485
00:32:50.031 --> 00:32:55.031
and good form and fast faster swimming in lane one and escapism and port form,

486
00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:02.180
uh,
and uh,
and slow times in lane four.
So,

487
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.750
uh,
you know,
then I,
it was a matter of how to engage them as well.

488
00:33:05.751 --> 00:33:08.150
And I found that these,
you know,
these tech,

489
00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:11.780
the technique challenges that I was giving them in the little puzzles to solve

490
00:33:11.781 --> 00:33:13.330
and so on,
uh,

491
00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:19.250
brought out in them a certain zest for the workouts that had not been there

492
00:33:19.251 --> 00:33:21.550
before.
So

493
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:27.080
<v 4>I'm really curious to know the first,
uh,
where,</v>

494
00:33:27.081 --> 00:33:30.740
what would later become total immersion kind of entered the picture.

495
00:33:30.741 --> 00:33:34.700
And I want to just make a couple of footnotes because it's related to a number

496
00:33:34.701 --> 00:33:39.140
of things.
You said,
for instance,
the perhaps very,

497
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:43.060
uh,
in retrospect,
uh,

498
00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:47.630
it's sensible and obvious advice to,
for instance,

499
00:33:47.631 --> 00:33:51.620
do what I do now,
which is breathe every third stroke,

500
00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:55.790
which means I'm going right,
left,
right,
left,
right,
left,
uh,

501
00:33:55.791 --> 00:34:00.600
in a very symmetrical way.
That's,
you know,
one,
one of the points that you,

502
00:34:00.601 --> 00:34:02.810
you mentioned,
and then,
uh,
the,

503
00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:06.590
the importance of a,

504
00:34:06.591 --> 00:34:11.591
and this is something that I think applies to just about everything and just

505
00:34:12.081 --> 00:34:14.180
about,
not everything but just about everything.

506
00:34:14.181 --> 00:34:17.240
And that is when you get in the pool,
then I remember this,

507
00:34:17.241 --> 00:34:22.220
this had a huge impact on me and I still have that very initial total immersion

508
00:34:22.221 --> 00:34:26.320
book somewhere.
Um,
it's,
it got wet a lot.
So,

509
00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:30.230
uh,
it's,
it's not in pristine condition,

510
00:34:30.231 --> 00:34:33.350
but the idea that you are,
say,

511
00:34:33.351 --> 00:34:37.520
getting in the pool to practice,
not to do a workout.

512
00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:40.220
And at least in the beginning,

513
00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:45.380
the idea that if it feels like a workout,

514
00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:46.910
you're not doing it correctly,

515
00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:52.130
was really difficult for me to first accept because I'm used to,

516
00:34:52.131 --> 00:34:54.470
or at least at that point in physical training,

517
00:34:54.471 --> 00:34:59.000
I thought that your results worry direct.
Uh,

518
00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:01.880
output from an input,
which was effort.
Right?

519
00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:07.540
And it was a huge mental shift for me to gauge my practice,

520
00:35:08.391 --> 00:35:13.391
the quality of the success of a practice based on how little effort I expended

521
00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:19.880
during say,
30 minutes in the pool.
Uh,
it was just,

522
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:21.200
it was a huge shift for me.

523
00:35:21.201 --> 00:35:26.201
And I think that applies to producing quality in many,

524
00:35:26.571 --> 00:35:31.460
many different areas,
at least in my experience.
Uh,

525
00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:35.940
uh,
somewhat counter intuitively.
So w when did the,
uh,
sort of the,
the,

526
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:38.040
the bones of what would later

527
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:43.040
<v 2>become a total immersion start to coalesce or start to appear?</v>

528
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:46.161
Well,

529
00:35:46.161 --> 00:35:51.161
let the powerful impact of working on technique and I'm not neglecting

530
00:35:51.751 --> 00:35:53.640
conditioning whatsoever.
I,
I,

531
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:58.140
my swimmers were very well conditioned everywhere I coached.
Um,

532
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:03.200
but the conditioning was always subordinate to the form.

533
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:07.620
In other words,
I would stop a sad if I wasn't satisfied with the form.

534
00:36:07.621 --> 00:36:11.370
They might be swimming fast,
they might be swimming their hearts out.

535
00:36:11.371 --> 00:36:15.270
But if I was not satisfied with the form,
I would stop the set,

536
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:19.320
redirect and restart the set and say,
you must maintain your form.

537
00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:20.790
Um,
the,

538
00:36:20.791 --> 00:36:25.380
the beginning of my conviction that that was,

539
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.580
that was an absolute,

540
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:31.550
that swimming success is based on superior form.
Uh,

541
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:36.180
came that first season at at kings point.
Um,
I had,

542
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.910
I had swim in that conference for four years.

543
00:36:38.911 --> 00:36:41.880
I swam for Saint John's university and we were,

544
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.310
we swam against King's point for four years.

545
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:47.880
We swam in the conference championship,
uh,
each year.

546
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:50.130
And I took,

547
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:55.160
I took my team after doing all this technique work and radically reshaping their

548
00:36:55.501 --> 00:36:59.040
strokes,
I have to say,
um,
to,

549
00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:03.180
to the conference championship,
uh,
in,
at the,

550
00:37:03.181 --> 00:37:06.900
at the end of the season.
And we just set the place on fire.

551
00:37:06.901 --> 00:37:10.890
I just could not,
you know,
even having coached them the whole season,

552
00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:14.680
I just was,
my mind was kind of boggled by,

553
00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:19.690
by the times they swam simply because nothing in my experience prepared me to

554
00:37:21.091 --> 00:37:25.860
see swimmers improve that much in swim that fast compared to the previous year.

555
00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:30.930
Um,
I'll give you one example.
Sort of the premier event in college.

556
00:37:30.931 --> 00:37:33.960
Swimming is the four by 100 freestyle relay.

557
00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:37.980
It's always the final event in the,
in a collegiate championship meet.

558
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:43.590
And as for is for swimmers,
each swimming 100 yards or 100 meters.

559
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:44.873
Um,

560
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:49.620
and in the four years that I was in the conference,

561
00:37:49.621 --> 00:37:53.640
the conference record for that event,
uh,

562
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:57.690
improved from three 25 to three 23 and as it happened,

563
00:37:57.691 --> 00:38:01.950
I was fortunate that the,
when I was a senior,
uh,

564
00:38:01.951 --> 00:38:06.210
the record of three 23.8 was set by my,
by,

565
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:07.830
by kings point relay.

566
00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:12.750
So I inherited the championship and record holding relay.
Well,

567
00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:17.310
they,
they came back my first year of coaching and went three 16

568
00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:22.470
and one in one night.
They improve seven seconds.
What had,

569
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:26.340
you know what it improves two seconds in four years.
Uh,

570
00:38:26.341 --> 00:38:31.110
and everybody's jaws were hanging around the pool and I realized,
oh my goodness,

571
00:38:31.111 --> 00:38:35.710
what have I brought?
I had never done anything that you,
you know,

572
00:38:35.711 --> 00:38:38.800
would suggest distinction of any sort in my life

573
00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:44.130
<v 1>prior to that night.
What would you do you recall the year on that?</v>

574
00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:48.150
Yeah.
That was march of 1973 and I was,

575
00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.760
I was still 21 years old for goodness sakes.

576
00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:56.820
I was the youngest coach in the Ncaa and now you ended up producing,

577
00:38:57.170 --> 00:39:00.480
uh,
and,
and I want to sort of qualify my earlier statement,

578
00:39:00.481 --> 00:39:05.280
also 24 national club and college champions,
right.

579
00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:07.560
If I'm getting my facts straight.

580
00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:13.020
So I don't want to imply that conditioning isn't a piece of,

581
00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:18.120
uh,
successfully coaching a competitive team,
certainly,

582
00:39:18.121 --> 00:39:22.350
but that it's a necessary but not sufficient.
Right?
I mean,

583
00:39:22.351 --> 00:39:27.351
to produce the improvement that you did in the relay,

584
00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:31.230
you can't just have them train harder,
uh,

585
00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:33.930
or expend more calories in the pool.
It was a,

586
00:39:33.931 --> 00:39:36.120
it was a technical improvement and I think that,
right,

587
00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.290
<v 2>right.
There's no way any change in conditioning.</v>

588
00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:42.290
Anything I could've done in workouts could have produced that improvement.

589
00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.153
No way at all.

590
00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.980
<v 1>No.
Tell me,
tell me about bill boomer.</v>

591
00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:50.610
Uh,
we're,
we're,
where did,

592
00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:54.420
where did bill into the picture and what effect did he have?

593
00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:57.500
<v 2>So I actually met bill,
Bill Ruh 1988,
and I,</v>

594
00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:01.820
I was just ready to step away from coaching.
I had gotten burned out.

595
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:05.720
Uh,
I still love coaching.
I love teaching,
but I was,

596
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:09.150
I had gotten a little burned out on dealing with parents.
Um,

597
00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:13.260
<v 1>and before,
before we,
before we just gloss over that.
So</v>

598
00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:18.810
can you give us an example?
Like what type of stuff burned you out with parents?

599
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:21.110
<v 2>Yeah.
Well,
um,</v>

600
00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:26.140
there was one time where I had these two really sensational 12 year old boys.

601
00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:30.410
Uh,
and um,

602
00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:33.980
when I had really good swimmers I would,

603
00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:36.680
I would make things a little more challenging for them.

604
00:40:36.681 --> 00:40:40.400
I didn't want it to come too easily because at,
at age 12,

605
00:40:40.401 --> 00:40:43.490
when you're a dominance,
when swimmer,
you're not used to being challenged.

606
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:48.130
So we got to our season,
uh,
our,
our net,

607
00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:52.700
our state age group championships and I said to the,
to the 12 year old boys,

608
00:40:52.701 --> 00:40:57.110
out of the eight events,
you're going to swim,
you can choose six,

609
00:40:57.111 --> 00:41:00.980
but I'm going to choose to.
And they both knew what it would be.

610
00:41:00.981 --> 00:41:03.980
It was going to be that they were both going to swim breaststroke events cause

611
00:41:03.981 --> 00:41:05.690
that was their weakest event.
And I,

612
00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:10.280
I wanted them to have at least one or two races where they really had to race,

613
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:15.860
uh,
and not just race each other.
Um,
and,
uh,
one,

614
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:18.710
one s one of the boys,

615
00:41:18.711 --> 00:41:23.711
the parents came to me and complained bitterly about my forcing their son to do

616
00:41:24.081 --> 00:41:26.630
that.
He had no problem with it.
He didn't,

617
00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:29.360
he didn't have an objection or had not raised an objection,

618
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:33.170
but because it was going to hurt his chances of winning the high point.

619
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.900
<v 3>And,
uh,
you know,
and I'm,
I'm thinking about his long term development,</v>

620
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:43.550
not whether he wins the trophy at age 12 or,
and in the end,

621
00:41:43.551 --> 00:41:47.180
the other boy who's who,
who,
who his parents were fully supportive,

622
00:41:47.181 --> 00:41:50.810
he and his parents were fully supportive and he swam the restaurant events and I

623
00:41:50.811 --> 00:41:53.980
decided it wasn't worth fighting that battle that if it was that important,

624
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:56.230
I'd let him not swim breaststroke,

625
00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:59.240
but the other boys swam the breast stroke and ended up winning the high point

626
00:41:59.241 --> 00:42:00.074
award.

627
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:06.740
You burning out because of overzealous,

628
00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:11.780
uh,
or maybe overinvolved over vocal parents.
Yeah.

629
00:42:11.781 --> 00:42:16.781
They had just lost their sense of perspective and in it and bill boomer,

630
00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:22.790
uh,
came,
came into the,
came into the picture around that time.
Yeah.
So I'm,

631
00:42:22.791 --> 00:42:26.680
I'm 37 years old and I had more money in the bank.
I,
you know,
I,
I,

632
00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:30.540
I also had a 14 year old daughter who was,
I was thinking,
Oh,

633
00:42:30.541 --> 00:42:34.370
I've got college costs coming up and you know,
coaching just didn't pay well.

634
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:37.410
I was one of the most successful,
uh,

635
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:40.100
most respected coaches in,

636
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:45.050
in the United States is in the age group ranks.
Uh,
and I,

637
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:49.580
I had never earned more than $15,000,
uh,

638
00:42:49.581 --> 00:42:52.910
in a season and a had no money in the bank.

639
00:42:52.911 --> 00:42:57.830
So I just decided I was going to cast about and see what other,
what else.

640
00:42:57.831 --> 00:43:01.880
I'm my,
my native abilities might allow me to do that,

641
00:43:01.881 --> 00:43:05.540
my pay better.
Uh,
and,
um,

642
00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:10.010
so,
but I still wanted to coach.
I still want it to be,

643
00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.350
keep my hand in it.
Uh,
I went,

644
00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:15.980
I was invited to the American swimming coaches association.

645
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:21.200
Worldclinic it's,
it's the top,
um,
coaching clinic in the world.

646
00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:24.440
And I was invited to talk on,

647
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:26.840
on a topic related to age group swimming.

648
00:43:26.841 --> 00:43:29.840
And then immediately after I finished my talk,

649
00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:31.670
I was sitting in the back of the room,

650
00:43:31.671 --> 00:43:36.671
sort of decompressing with some coaching friends and I had intended to go see

651
00:43:36.891 --> 00:43:37.760
Randi Reese,

652
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:42.790
the a head coach of the University of Florida at the time and a guy who had

653
00:43:43.851 --> 00:43:46.610
coached many Olympians and world record holders.
And by the way,

654
00:43:46.611 --> 00:43:50.960
the brother of the Eddie Reese who's coach at University of Texas at Austin and,

655
00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:54.740
and probably the most successful coach we have in the United States.

656
00:43:54.741 --> 00:43:58.850
So I was going to go see Randi Reese and learn how to coach world record holders

657
00:43:58.851 --> 00:44:03.690
and um,
and bill boomer and it completely unheralded on,

658
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:04.703
uh,

659
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.200
little known coach with a really unconventional approach to things.

660
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:13.840
He was a coach at the University of Rochester and Rochester,
New York.
And uh,

661
00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:16.550
he got up and started speaking and he just,
right,

662
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:20.930
right from his opening sentences,
uh,
it blew my mind.

663
00:44:20.931 --> 00:44:24.200
He was talking about things I had never heard and the most,

664
00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:28.450
the thing that he said that has stuck with me ever since that I'll,
I'll,

665
00:44:28.451 --> 00:44:31.770
I'll stay.
I'll quote two quotes it has,

666
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:37.040
<v 2>but the first was he says the shape of the engine is more important than this.</v>

667
00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:38.730
I'm sorry.

668
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:43.560
The shape of the vessel is more important than the size of the engine and

669
00:44:43.561 --> 00:44:47.460
swimming and every,
every coaching talk.

670
00:44:47.461 --> 00:44:52.461
I had been to over the PR of the previous 16 Years of going to coaching clinics.

671
00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:55.110
Everyone had been about engine building,

672
00:44:55.710 --> 00:45:00.690
not a single talk about vessel shaping.
What do we really mean by this?
That.
Well,

673
00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:05.930
boomer says that a human body moving through the water should be treated like

674
00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:11.760
any vessel and should be designed to move through the water with his little

675
00:45:11.761 --> 00:45:16.761
dragon is little turbulence as as possible and engine building referred to both

676
00:45:17.791 --> 00:45:22.791
building the aerobic engine through through cardiovascular conditioning and

677
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:27.950
emphasizing how powerful the Poland cake is by doing what I call arms

678
00:45:28.351 --> 00:45:31.740
department,
legs,
department training,
where you,

679
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.380
you tie your legs together,
you,
you,
you know,

680
00:45:34.381 --> 00:45:37.260
you put a boy between them and a band,
a band around them,

681
00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:42.510
take them out of the picture and then to put a pair of big paddles on your hands

682
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:43.260
and,

683
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:47.450
and muscle your way up and down the pool with your arm muscles or you immobilize

684
00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:49.380
your arms and,

685
00:45:49.381 --> 00:45:52.500
and possibly put on thins for more,

686
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:56.970
more power and muscle your way up and down the pool.
And,
uh,

687
00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:02.720
separating the arms from the legs and in training disintegrating,

688
00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:05.700
uh,
the body in other words.
So,

689
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:08.370
so the two types of engine building is,

690
00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:12.920
is really all that I had ever heard emphasized.
Uh,
and,

691
00:46:12.921 --> 00:46:16.670
and that was the first thing.
And I'll come back with another anecdote later,
uh,

692
00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:21.060
to tell you why this resonated with maybe,
but the other thing that he said,

693
00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:24.660
uh,
was that,
um,

694
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:29.130
conditioning is something that happens to you while you build,

695
00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:33.630
refine and imprint skills.
Uh,

696
00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:36.810
and just the fact that,
you know,

697
00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:40.860
you would first look at the skill component first,

698
00:46:40.861 --> 00:46:44.940
look at the skill impact of any training set or a task you get.

699
00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:46.260
Uh,

700
00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:51.000
and that the metabolic component,

701
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:55.620
the conditioning component would be a factor of the difficulty of the skill

702
00:46:55.621 --> 00:46:57.810
task.
Um,

703
00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:01.890
as opposed to just say to say to the swimmer,

704
00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:06.000
I want your heart rate above one 74,
uh,
you know,

705
00:47:06.001 --> 00:47:08.940
for the next 20 minutes,
ready,
go.

706
00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.480
<v 4>And,
uh,
you know,
before,</v>

707
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:16.230
before we keep moving ahead with the chronology,

708
00:47:16.231 --> 00:47:20.340
I'd love to talk about your experience,
uh,

709
00:47:20.341 --> 00:47:23.160
which I think was,
maybe it was just before this,

710
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:27.600
you could clarify when exactly it happened,
but the,

711
00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:30.610
the break that you took from coaching,

712
00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:36.040
can you tell us a bit about that experience when you started,

713
00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:40.810
when you were testing other avenues for,
uh,
making a living?

714
00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:43.040
<v 3>Yeah,
it ended up being writing.</v>

715
00:47:43.041 --> 00:47:47.510
I had started doing just a little bit of writing B while I was still coaching.

716
00:47:47.511 --> 00:47:52.511
I wrote one article for slimming world magazine and a few other things for

717
00:47:52.581 --> 00:47:56.740
newsletters.
I always wrote a piece for our club newsletter,
you know,

718
00:47:56.750 --> 00:48:00.260
from the coach's perspective.
Um,
and I,
I found,

719
00:48:00.261 --> 00:48:04.610
I enjoyed communicating by writing and I thought I would try.
So,

720
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:08.590
uh,
my wife Alison,
I started a marketing communications,

721
00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:13.100
very tiny little mom and pop agency called main street communications.

722
00:48:13.101 --> 00:48:17.210
We lived on Main Street and Goshen,
New York and um,

723
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:23.050
and we wrote speeches and PR stuff and things like that for small businesses in

724
00:48:24.561 --> 00:48:29.510
the area.
At the same time,
I started writing articles for,

725
00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:33.740
for small local magazines.
And then I happened to go to my 20th,

726
00:48:33.741 --> 00:48:36.320
three high school reunion.
Uh,

727
00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:41.350
and one of my classmates was the editor of a magazine,

728
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:42.800
uh,

729
00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:47.800
on corporate hedging on how multinational companies hedge,

730
00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:54.020
uh,
their currency risk,
which was much greater in those days before the,

731
00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:57.190
uh,
before the unification of the eurozone.
Uh,

732
00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:59.990
they were all those currencies in Europe.
And so they were,

733
00:48:59.991 --> 00:49:03.380
they were at great risk of,
of currency moves,
uh,

734
00:49:03.381 --> 00:49:07.400
and interest rate risk and political risk and commodity risk,

735
00:49:07.401 --> 00:49:12.020
all these forms of risks that you undertake.
And so I,
you know,
he said,

736
00:49:12.021 --> 00:49:14.600
what are you doing?
I said,
well,
I'm doing a little bit of magazine writing.

737
00:49:14.601 --> 00:49:16.220
He said,
why don't you send me a clip?

738
00:49:16.221 --> 00:49:20.330
And he ended up giving me an assignment and I,
I,
you know,

739
00:49:20.331 --> 00:49:24.980
I turned out I was pretty good at interviewing and distilling the information

740
00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:26.060
and,
and,

741
00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:31.060
and writing about it even though I knew nothing about puts and calls and,

742
00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:36.710
and all these hedging strategies.
And,
um,
so I ended up,

743
00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:41.750
I earned my living primarily through writing about international corporate

744
00:49:41.751 --> 00:49:45.710
finance,
which is kind of a crazy thing,
uh,
during,

745
00:49:45.711 --> 00:49:49.670
during the time that I wasn't coaching.
Why did you come back to coaching?

746
00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:53.810
Um,
well,
I,
you know,

747
00:49:53.811 --> 00:49:57.100
I wasn't away from coaching very long.
I,
I actually,
uh,

748
00:49:57.110 --> 00:50:02.110
was an assistant coach at west point with a responsibility to be the,

749
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:05.750
my portfolio was coaching technique for,
for everybody on the team.

750
00:50:05.751 --> 00:50:07.700
My good friend,
Ray Bossy,
uh,

751
00:50:07.701 --> 00:50:12.701
had just taken over as head coach and he asked me to help him make the

752
00:50:12.801 --> 00:50:16.520
transition during his first year.
So I did,
that was 1988,

753
00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:21.140
89 when I had started the writing and stuff.

754
00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:24.350
Um,
and um,

755
00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:28.030
I enjoy just working tech always had

756
00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:32.570
<v 2>enjoyed teaching technique.
And uh,
in 1988,</v>

757
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:35.750
uh,
in August of 1988,
I resumed swimming.

758
00:50:35.751 --> 00:50:39.980
I had knots woman 17 years since college.
And,
uh,

759
00:50:39.981 --> 00:50:44.420
I saw that masters nationals,
we're going to be in buffalo not far from my house.

760
00:50:44.421 --> 00:50:45.320
So I thought,
well,

761
00:50:45.321 --> 00:50:48.740
I'll start swimming again and I'll go to that masters nationals and see how I

762
00:50:48.741 --> 00:50:50.860
like it.
So the,
the,

763
00:50:50.861 --> 00:50:55.861
the takeaways I got was that everybody seemed to be having great fun and I was

764
00:50:57.021 --> 00:51:00.350
super impressed by the people in the 55 and over age groups,
how,

765
00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:04.310
how fit they were and how fast they were a,
and I thought,

766
00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:08.990
I want to be like them when I get to be that age.
So,
um,

767
00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:13.550
so I was,
I was introduced to master swimming and I thought,
well,

768
00:51:13.551 --> 00:51:16.010
if I,
if I coached these folks,

769
00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:20.630
I probably won't have any parent problems.
And uh,

770
00:51:20.631 --> 00:51:24.530
so the next summer I decided I was going to hold a summer camp,

771
00:51:24.531 --> 00:51:28.940
the summer camps for kids where a common thing,
you know,
would like other sports.

772
00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:33.020
There were week long and longer summer camps for different sports.

773
00:51:33.021 --> 00:51:37.730
So summer camps are swimmers were pot were were something I knew well.

774
00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:41.780
Uh,
and I thought I'd offer one for adults and a,

775
00:51:41.781 --> 00:51:46.781
so I did 19 or June of 1989 at Colgate university in Hamilton,

776
00:51:48.231 --> 00:51:52.310
New York.
I had the first ever total immersion camp.
Where did I get the name?

777
00:51:52.311 --> 00:51:55.940
Total immersion because I didn't want to call it Terry Laughlin swung camp.

778
00:51:55.941 --> 00:52:00.730
To me that was like calling it some guys swim camp.
I thought I needed a better,

779
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:03.470
a better name than just my name.
So I was,

780
00:52:03.471 --> 00:52:07.850
I was reading a magazine one day and I came across an ad for Berlitz language

781
00:52:07.851 --> 00:52:10.120
schools and they were offering what they call it,

782
00:52:10.121 --> 00:52:12.950
total immersion language courses.
And I said,

783
00:52:12.951 --> 00:52:17.490
that certainly works as well through swimming as it does for,
for language.
So I,

784
00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:21.530
I chose that name and then waited about five years for a letter from their

785
00:52:21.531 --> 00:52:25.610
lawyers telling me to cease and desist before I went to a lawyer and found it.

786
00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:29.540
Oh,
I could,
I could trademark total immersion swimming,
which I,
I did finally.

787
00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:33.270
Uh,
so I had total immersion swim camp,
uh,

788
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:37.550
in the summer of 89 and I had six swimmers the first week in nine.

789
00:52:37.551 --> 00:52:39.570
The second I had,
uh,

790
00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:44.090
I had an Olympic swimmer on 1948 Olympian from,
from Holland,

791
00:52:44.091 --> 00:52:48.810
who was now a resident of Canada,
uh,
of an Ottawa,
uh,
and,

792
00:52:48.811 --> 00:52:53.570
and came to the camp.
And,
uh,
so I,
I taught,

793
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:58.600
I taught those people what I had been teaching for 20 years or not 20 years,
but,

794
00:52:58.601 --> 00:53:02.060
uh,
18 years,
17 years.
Um,

795
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:06.440
I what I had been teaching two age group swimmers because these people were all

796
00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:10.070
very conversant with swimming.
A lot of them had swum when they were kids,

797
00:53:10.071 --> 00:53:13.290
you know,
not to mention having an Olympian.
Uh,

798
00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:16.610
and they were all very comfortable in the water and you know,
everything,

799
00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:20.390
everything that I did work well with them and uh,
you know,
a cup,

800
00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:23.330
a couple of them said I improved more in five days and I have in the last 10

801
00:53:23.331 --> 00:53:26.100
years.
So that was something that

802
00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:29.280
<v 3>I found I enjoyed.
I found,
worked well with the,</v>

803
00:53:29.281 --> 00:53:33.420
with the people and I continued doing that for the next,
uh,

804
00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:38.540
for the next several years.
But,
um,
I,
I all,

805
00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:42.180
I had masters swimmers the first year and the third year I had my first

806
00:53:42.181 --> 00:53:47.160
triathlete come,
come to one of these four stroke camps.

807
00:53:47.161 --> 00:53:51.090
And first of all,
they were mainly interested in,
in freestyle,

808
00:53:51.091 --> 00:53:55.230
not in the other three strokes.
And secondly,
when we finished a pool session,

809
00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:59.400
we had two pull sessions a day,
one morning,
one afternoon.
And I,

810
00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:01.770
I wanted them to rest up for the afternoon.

811
00:54:01.771 --> 00:54:06.060
They would go out for a bike ride or run and come back,
all sweaty.
Uh,

812
00:54:06.061 --> 00:54:09.240
so I wasn't thrilled.
Uh,
but it,
the,

813
00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:14.220
the proportion of triathletes grew so rapidly that by about the fourth or fifth

814
00:54:14.221 --> 00:54:17.520
year,
it was 70% triathletes and we were doing just freestyle.

815
00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:20.440
<v 4>Now we're,
if we're going to f let's,</v>

816
00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:26.010
if you don't mind flash forward as you see you're forming total immersion,

817
00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:30.100
you're developing and testing different methods.

818
00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:35.460
If we look back at our experience that we shared in Hawaii with,

819
00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:36.730
uh,
Sarah,

820
00:54:36.970 --> 00:54:41.230
who was very much novice swimmer,

821
00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:44.200
uncomfortable putting her face underwater,
right?

822
00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:49.260
A mother of I think too at the time and for the Tim Ferriss experiment,

823
00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:54.880
a TV show at the time,
we wanted to show,

824
00:54:54.881 --> 00:54:59.170
demonstrate that it wasn't just an anomaly,

825
00:54:59.171 --> 00:55:02.590
that I had learned to swim in this way and that in fact it could be replicated.

826
00:55:02.591 --> 00:55:06.780
So we brought Sarah to Hawaii and uh,

827
00:55:07.330 --> 00:55:09.460
I'm going to back into the technique,

828
00:55:09.461 --> 00:55:14.461
but started with kind of coughing and having a lot of trouble really just

829
00:55:14.651 --> 00:55:18.040
submerging her face to a few days later.

830
00:55:18.041 --> 00:55:23.041
And keeping in mind that for those people who watch nonfiction TV or reality TV,

831
00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:27.520
if it's actually reality TV,
which this was meaning,

832
00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:29.770
it's not highly scripted.

833
00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:34.800
We're actually capturing someone as they progress from zero to hopefully open

834
00:55:35.411 --> 00:55:40.060
water swimmer.
There's a locker on the line,

835
00:55:40.061 --> 00:55:44.380
you're putting it on,
you're really on the line.
And also you have audio issues.

836
00:55:44.381 --> 00:55:48.640
You have camera reframing.
So you might think that with say Sarah,

837
00:55:48.641 --> 00:55:51.760
we had four or five days of training,

838
00:55:51.761 --> 00:55:55.030
but in reality we had a much,

839
00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:57.580
a shortened period of time.

840
00:55:57.581 --> 00:55:59.980
It was probably half of that time that we had to work.
Sure.

841
00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:03.760
<v 3>Very complicated and challenging instructional environment with all the,</v>

842
00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:08.260
all the technical people around and all the cameras and the reshoots and all of

843
00:56:08.261 --> 00:56:08.810
that.

844
00:56:08.810 --> 00:56:12.130
<v 4>Yeah,
it really it.
But it worked.
And uh,</v>

845
00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:16.790
she ended up swimming in very deep water,
open water,

846
00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:20.810
uh,
sinks,
swimming with both of us,
uh,

847
00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:24.490
a breathing in freestyle stroke.
It was just tremendous.

848
00:56:24.491 --> 00:56:29.440
But where do you take someone like a Sarah and begin?

849
00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:30.790
We're,
where do you start?

850
00:56:30.791 --> 00:56:35.740
Because I think this is where a lot of people who try to learn to swim and you

851
00:56:35.741 --> 00:56:40.210
know,
they swallow their pride and go to the pool or find a coach where things go

852
00:56:40.211 --> 00:56:44.200
sideways.
And certainly that was true for me.
Uh,
where do you start?

853
00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:46.650
Do you start by getting into the deep end and,

854
00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:49.360
and trying to learn how to breathe while you've swim?
Freestyle?

855
00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:54.560
<v 3>No,
no.
Very,
very small bits.
A very,</v>

856
00:56:54.561 --> 00:56:56.910
what I call mini skills in micro skills.

857
00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:02.200
We always teach in a step by step fashion where each step leads naturally to the

858
00:57:03.921 --> 00:57:08.660
next and as a scaffold,
uh,
for,
for the next step.
So,

859
00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:13.510
so I meet Sarah,
uh,
at the,
at the pool,
uh,
on,

860
00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:18.260
on Monday morning.
We began to shoot on Monday morning.
And,
uh,

861
00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:22.920
we,
I said,
okay,
well,
let's see what you can do.
A,

862
00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:25.400
and the cameras are rolling and tag.

863
00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:29.420
Sarah Swims about six or eight strokes furiously,
just,

864
00:57:29.421 --> 00:57:31.580
just flailing away,
uh,

865
00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:36.450
with their head out of the water had had just whipping back and forth.
Uh,

866
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:39.560
and then she needs a breath.
Then what does she do?
She stopped.

867
00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:45.290
She can't breathe and swim.
So she,
she had to stop and she did that a few times.

868
00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:48.600
Uh,
and I,
I,
I knew,
you know,

869
00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:51.580
I had a pretty good idea what I was going to say.

870
00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:57.020
You probably recognize that from your own experience,
Tim.
Oh,
sure.

871
00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:00.440
You know,
the way she was swimming and survival,

872
00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:04.390
the drowning monkey technique,
right?
Well,
you know,
here,

873
00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:09.620
I cited this statistic earlier of of only 2% of American adults can swim 400

874
00:58:10.681 --> 00:58:15.160
meters nonstop,
only 30% consumed,
25 yards.
Just one,
you know,

875
00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:20.120
one length of,
of your local local pool.
Uh,
only 30% can,

876
00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:24.320
can swim one lap.
Don,
stop.
So that was you,
Tim.
As I recall,

877
00:58:24.321 --> 00:58:29.270
your story was in a 20 yard pool and swimming about two thirds of the way the

878
00:58:29.271 --> 00:58:33.410
way down and not being able to get past that two thirds,
two thirds points.

879
00:58:33.411 --> 00:58:37.430
So it,
what is it?
It's an inability to breathe because you can't get air,

880
00:58:37.431 --> 00:58:42.210
you can't carry on a,
but you can't just start in with breathing,
uh,

881
00:58:42.290 --> 00:58:46.520
because there's,
there's a series of skills that you have to learn first.

882
00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:49.490
So what did we have Sarah do first?

883
00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:53.060
I'm doing a glide,
a very,

884
00:58:53.061 --> 00:58:57.620
very simple glide with arms extended at shoulder with,

885
00:58:57.621 --> 00:59:01.640
we call it superman.
It's superman.
Uh,
I,

886
00:59:01.850 --> 00:59:03.110
this is instructing,

887
00:59:03.350 --> 00:59:07.880
instructing Sarah to just glide to just,
um,

888
00:59:07.970 --> 00:59:12.440
hang her head between her shoulders,
which is an,

889
00:59:13.310 --> 00:59:16.550
it's an,
um,
it's a non instinctive thing,

890
00:59:16.551 --> 00:59:20.270
but it's exceptionally important.
In fact,
it's,
it's counterintuitive.

891
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:25.010
What was and snake was to hold her head up to,
to um,
avoid choking.

892
00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:29.690
And I here,
I was telling her,
so I want you to hang your head in the water.

893
00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:32.720
I want you to let it go.
Uh,

894
00:59:32.810 --> 00:59:35.120
and she discovered when she,

895
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:40.390
she let her head hanging the water that she could glide and her body didn't sink

896
00:59:40.881 --> 00:59:43.610
and she could just glide effortlessly,

897
00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:48.170
maybe five or six yards.
And that's kind of that,

898
00:59:48.171 --> 00:59:53.030
that's a life changing experience for someone who's always felt that they,

899
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:54.103
they were sinker.

900
00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:58.020
<v 4>Right?
Well,
you're showing the,
uh,
the how,</v>

901
00:59:58.170 --> 01:00:00.840
the shape of the vessel and I had the hydrodynamics

902
01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:05.530
<v 3>exactly changes the whole game where we in fact were shaping the vessel to too,</v>

903
01:00:05.531 --> 01:00:10.090
so that she could glide five or six yards without any effort so that she could

904
01:00:10.091 --> 01:00:15.091
just look down and see the pool bottom passing under her without her doing

905
01:00:15.161 --> 01:00:19.080
anything.
And at the same time feel this,
uh,

906
01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:24.850
incredible sense of support,
almost weightlessness from the water.

907
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:27.980
<v 4>And I just want to highlight something here or a few things.</v>

908
01:00:27.981 --> 01:00:32.510
The first is that this is happening in,
let's call it four feet of water,

909
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:36.230
right?
It's just Sarah can stand up at any time if she wants to.

910
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:41.180
So it's removing that fear factor a second.
She's not kicking,

911
01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:44.870
she's not pulling with her hands.
She simply gliding,
right?

912
01:00:44.871 --> 01:00:47.690
So you're driving and shaping the vessel.

913
01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:51.290
So you're isolating that prerequisite,

914
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:56.780
a skill or component that leads to the rest.

915
01:00:56.781 --> 01:00:58.520
And one thing that really struck me,

916
01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:03.350
this is true in my experience with all really,

917
01:01:03.351 --> 01:01:05.720
really profound instruction,

918
01:01:05.721 --> 01:01:08.870
whether it's music or say recently for me,

919
01:01:08.871 --> 01:01:13.871
tennis with a coach named Lorenzo Beltrami who just blew my mind with teaching

920
01:01:14.241 --> 01:01:18.080
me how to serve properly.
Uh,

921
01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:22.010
and I just want to draw a parallel,
if you don't mind the digression because,

922
01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:26.390
or Josh Waitzkin has been on this podcast and how he teaches chess,

923
01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:28.700
which is very much what you would not expect.

924
01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:32.420
And what you find is that almost by definition,

925
01:01:32.421 --> 01:01:37.421
really profound instruction is very different from what you would expect because

926
01:01:37.701 --> 01:01:41.640
what you expect gets very mediocre results.
Uh,
and,

927
01:01:41.641 --> 01:01:46.400
and for instance,
you know,
Josh starts with,
and I think we'll come back to this,

928
01:01:46.401 --> 01:01:48.290
but first principles,
right?
He wants,

929
01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:52.190
he wants someone to understand the principles of chess in this case.

930
01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:54.680
And for those people that don't know the name,

931
01:01:54.681 --> 01:01:58.520
he was the basis for the book and the movie searching for Bobby Fischer.

932
01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:04.160
And he'll take all of the pieces off the chess board and start with a,

933
01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.113
uh,

934
01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:10.570
I think it's just king versus king and pawn to teach very,

935
01:02:10.881 --> 01:02:15.881
very flexible principles that then apply to the rest of the games.

936
01:02:16.251 --> 01:02:20.580
So he'll start with the end game in order to demonstrate those principles.
Uh,

937
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:25.590
but perhaps a more direct parallel would be Lorenzo,
when he was teaching me,

938
01:02:25.591 --> 01:02:28.530
I'd never been able to serve in tennis or really,

939
01:02:28.531 --> 01:02:30.990
I never had learned how to play tennis period.

940
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:34.560
But what he started me with is he said,
all right,

941
01:02:34.561 --> 01:02:38.940
you're going to hold the tennis ball in your left hand and you want your hand

942
01:02:38.941 --> 01:02:42.170
sideways.
All right,
so that,
uh,

943
01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.690
so that you're not whipping the ball backwards and I want you to just practice

944
01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:49.740
throwing the ball up and having it land a few inches in front of your feet.

945
01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:52.470
That's all I want you to do.
So I'm just throwing the tennis ball up,

946
01:02:52.830 --> 01:02:57.630
having it land in front of my feet so that I'm not throwing it behind me or too

947
01:02:57.631 --> 01:03:00.840
far ahead of meeting cause okay,
great.
Actually,
if I take it back,

948
01:03:00.841 --> 01:03:01.531
that was step two.

949
01:03:01.531 --> 01:03:06.531
Step one was practice lightly and loosely throwing a tennis ball over the net,

950
01:03:07.530 --> 01:03:10.080
just like a,
just like a soft baseball throw.

951
01:03:10.110 --> 01:03:15.110
Second was with my left hand throwing the ball up and having it land in front of

952
01:03:15.751 --> 01:03:17.280
me,
just a few inches in front of my foot.

953
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:22.740
Then the next step was throwing the first ball up and then trying to hit it

954
01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:25.860
within the tennis ball that I'm throwing with my rear hand.

955
01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:28.920
And then literally he just said,
okay,
here's a tennis racket,

956
01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:33.120
try to hit the tennis ball and boom right into the zone on the other side of the

957
01:03:33.121 --> 01:03:35.760
net.
And it just was one of those moments.

958
01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:38.880
And that just made my head kind of explode,

959
01:03:38.881 --> 01:03:42.210
which was also the case with total immersion.

960
01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.550
And with this logical progression,

961
01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:49.530
that's sort of what I want to underscore is that you're building on each of

962
01:03:49.531 --> 01:03:51.810
these skills.
Uh,

963
01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.810
and it just gets me so excited when people ask me,
know,

964
01:03:54.811 --> 01:03:58.120
why are you trying to learn the Gamelan from Indonesia?

965
01:03:58.140 --> 01:03:59.460
Why are you trying to learn this or that?

966
01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:03.000
It's these Aha moments where you do something for say,

967
01:04:03.001 --> 01:04:07.080
Sarah and she goes,
Holy Shit,
for lack of a better,

968
01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:11.970
more elegant way to put it,
I could actually do this.
Uh,

969
01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:16.110
and um,
see you have Sarah gliding.

970
01:04:16.111 --> 01:04:20.850
What are some of the other important initial s,

971
01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:24.300
uh,
skills or exercises that you layer on top of that?

972
01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:29.260
<v 2>Well.
Um,
one of the things that,
that you have written in your,</v>

973
01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.710
you know,
when you,
when you write about metal learning,

974
01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:37.810
one of the principles that you have cited for that is avoid error points.

975
01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:41.860
Right.
And as soon as I,
soon as I read that,
I recognized,

976
01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.800
oh yeah we did that.
You know,
Tim,
Tim's got it.

977
01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:49.030
And what are the two points and you know,
from your experience,

978
01:04:49.031 --> 01:04:51.130
what are the two hour points were swimmers.

979
01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:55.680
<v 4>Oh boy.
You know what,
I'm a funder.
I'm caught on the spot.
I would say,</v>

980
01:04:55.681 --> 01:05:00.450
well number one is,
is just fear of not being able to touch the bottom.

981
01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:01.710
Uh,
at least for me,

982
01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.310
I'll just name and for those people who are wondering what I mean.

983
01:05:05.311 --> 01:05:07.380
So if we're looking at failure points,

984
01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:10.040
<v 2>I can,
I can tell you,
is it to,
you decided when you wrote,</v>

985
01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:14.370
<v 4>when you wrote about it kicking and breathing,
kicking and breathing,
right.</v>

986
01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:15.880
<v 2>King and breathing.
Cause every,</v>

987
01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:19.600
every time somebody handed you a kickboard is you said your feet just slice

988
01:05:19.601 --> 01:05:22.500
through the water,
like razor blades and you went nowhere.
Yeah.

989
01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.910
That's everybody's experience.

990
01:05:24.911 --> 01:05:28.390
Nobody can propel on a kickboard except really people who are already really

991
01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:33.160
good swimmers.
Yeah.
So,
so that's a totally useless tool to learn to swim.

992
01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:36.340
But everybody,
what did they do?
What does everybody do?

993
01:05:36.341 --> 01:05:39.800
They hand you a kickboard to try to strengthen your legs so your legs won't
sink.

994
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:43.960
That's not the problem you're having.
Weak legs is not the problem.

995
01:05:44.830 --> 01:05:45.663
So the problem,

996
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:49.860
the first problem we solved with Sarah was fear of fear of sinking.
Um,

997
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:51.610
and we took out the breathing component.

998
01:05:51.611 --> 01:05:56.110
We said we're going to add that later when,
when you are ready,
when you have,

999
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:58.140
when you have a,
um,

1000
01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:03.880
a platform of skills so that you can control something about how you breathe.

1001
01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:06.220
And we'll introduce that.
And you know,
we're,

1002
01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:09.220
we're going to not even make kicking part of it at all,
but um,

1003
01:06:09.790 --> 01:06:14.350
teach you as you have written Tim,
to have the legs draft behind the upper body.

1004
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:18.900
Um,
so,
so we had her do exactly that with,

1005
01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.860
with the superman glide,

1006
01:06:20.861 --> 01:06:25.861
which is just let out a pearl size string of bubbles so that you're not holding

1007
01:06:26.681 --> 01:06:29.000
your breath a and don't cake.

1008
01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:33.850
Press your legs lightly together and just feel your body body gliding.
That was,

1009
01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.440
that was step one.

1010
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:40.470
The second step was to teach her to shape her body for the most hydrodynamic

1011
01:06:45.101 --> 01:06:48.940
position in the crawl stroke and the most hydrodynamic position,

1012
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:53.650
the one where you experienced the least drag,
uh,

1013
01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:58.570
is the fully extended position.
So when you've reached forward with one arm and,

1014
01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:03.550
and press back with the other arm and you're fully extended and rotated just a

1015
01:07:03.551 --> 01:07:04.960
little bit off your stomach.

1016
01:07:05.530 --> 01:07:10.030
So we call that scape position because it brings to mind,

1017
01:07:10.031 --> 01:07:15.031
or I would like to bring to mind the blade of a speed skate and a to shape your

1018
01:07:15.851 --> 01:07:20.200
body to be as long and sleek and balanced as,

1019
01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:25.150
as it as it can be.
Um,
and so what,

1020
01:07:25.151 --> 01:07:30.151
what we did there was the superman glide does not occur in freestyle.

1021
01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:33.760
So we just use that to get her comfortable in the water,

1022
01:07:33.761 --> 01:07:37.930
to give her a sense that she had control of her body position.

1023
01:07:37.931 --> 01:07:41.500
Very important to feel that you're in control.
And then,

1024
01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:45.680
and then the very next step was to put her in the most hydrodynamic position.

1025
01:07:45.681 --> 01:07:50.080
So we started with the most important moment in the stroke and,

1026
01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:51.760
and let her become very,

1027
01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:55.840
very familiar with all the fine details of that moment.

1028
01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:00.280
Where should your hand be a year extended hand be?

1029
01:08:00.281 --> 01:08:04.540
It should be in a particular place.
It should be below your body,
uh,

1030
01:08:04.541 --> 01:08:06.220
and it should be on,

1031
01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:10.900
on a track with the whole right side of your body.
If it's your right arm,

1032
01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:14.980
uh,
and your left shoulder should be barely above the surface,

1033
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:19.640
you should be looking straight down.
You should be a kicking very,

1034
01:08:19.641 --> 01:08:22.490
very minimally.
And so we taught her that position.

1035
01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:26.780
I would say we spent a good part of an entire pool session just,
uh,

1036
01:08:26.781 --> 01:08:31.781
letting salary Sarah become familiar with and in control of that,

1037
01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:33.260
that position.

1038
01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:34.600
<v 1>No,
definitely.</v>

1039
01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:39.600
And I did a couple of things that that come to mind that I also want to bring up

1040
01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:44.770
that were particularly helpful for me.
Number one was having a,

1041
01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:50.300
and I'm very quantified in sense that I like to have a number I can use for

1042
01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:58.570
tracking improvement,
but when you're just learning how to swim,

1043
01:08:59.410 --> 01:09:03.520
looking at say lapse speed is,
is is going to encourage bad behavior,
right?

1044
01:09:03.521 --> 01:09:06.100
It's going to,
again,
courage,
at least in me,

1045
01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:10.270
the thrashing and overexertion that we want to have wood.

1046
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:14.680
But the looking at the uh,

1047
01:09:14.890 --> 01:09:19.570
sort of stroke count per length ended up being really helpful for me.

1048
01:09:19.571 --> 01:09:24.430
So for instance,
you know,
I went from in about four workouts a,

1049
01:09:24.431 --> 01:09:27.100
this is again by myself,
just self coaching with the book,

1050
01:09:27.610 --> 01:09:32.410
more than 25 strokes per 20 yard length to an average of around 11 strokes.

1051
01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:37.030
Uh,
so I had,
I had doubled my sort of efficiency.
Right.

1052
01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:39.880
And I'll just run through a couple of quick notes that I have here.

1053
01:09:39.881 --> 01:09:42.000
So the first is more of a Metacomet,

1054
01:09:42.010 --> 01:09:47.010
which is people think of swimming and I thought of swimming as something you do

1055
01:09:47.231 --> 01:09:51.580
on top of the water.
Uh,
and I'll just list a few of these and then we can,

1056
01:09:51.610 --> 01:09:53.590
we can dig into dig into them,

1057
01:09:53.591 --> 01:09:58.591
but whereas in fact your body's denser that or very often denser than water,

1058
01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:01.390
you're going to be mostly submerged.

1059
01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:06.010
So if you think of freestyle is as having say 90%,

1060
01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:07.660
you could give you probably more accurate percentage,

1061
01:10:07.661 --> 01:10:10.000
but like 90% of your body underwater.

1062
01:10:10.330 --> 01:10:15.100
Then when you are swimming,
say freestyle,

1063
01:10:15.101 --> 01:10:18.880
your body is going to be mostly underwater.
Uh,

1064
01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:23.710
and just accepting that removes a huge fear factor because if you're accustomed

1065
01:10:23.711 --> 01:10:26.200
to thinking,
I have to swim in order to breathe,

1066
01:10:26.201 --> 01:10:29.710
I have to keep my body on top of the water.
You're on a suicide mission,

1067
01:10:29.711 --> 01:10:32.560
it's just not going to work.
The physics don't provide for it,

1068
01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:36.400
you will always win that battle.
Yeah,
gravity is always going to win.

1069
01:10:36.401 --> 01:10:37.234
So when you would,

1070
01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:40.540
when you're taught from the very outset or the expectations set,
all right,

1071
01:10:40.541 --> 01:10:43.480
your body is going to be 95,
90,
95% underwater.

1072
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:48.990
And your goal and let's start by kicking off a wall and four feet of water is to

1073
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:53.950
glide from say sort of fuselage,

1074
01:10:53.951 --> 01:10:57.400
right to fuselage left,
right?
So if we,
if we think of freestyle,

1075
01:10:57.410 --> 01:11:02.410
not as swimming on your stomach but from alternating from one extended position

1076
01:11:03.401 --> 01:11:04.030
to the other,

1077
01:11:04.030 --> 01:11:08.530
just like you would go from say right speed skate to left speed skate like you

1078
01:11:08.531 --> 01:11:11.880
were mentioning earlier and that extended position,
uh,

1079
01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:15.300
things change really quickly.
And uh,

1080
01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:19.170
thinking of these are just a couple of the counterintuitive things on a mention

1081
01:11:19.171 --> 01:11:20.370
for people that really helped me.

1082
01:11:20.371 --> 01:11:25.371
Another was focusing on driving your arm through the water as opposed to polling

1083
01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:31.110
in order to encourage that position.
Uh,

1084
01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:32.430
the looking straight down,

1085
01:11:32.431 --> 01:11:37.380
which you mentioned also I think very counterintuitive for folks and having your

1086
01:11:37.381 --> 01:11:41.610
arm when you are in that fully extended position,

1087
01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:45.660
a good deal underwater,
uh,
not on top of the water.

1088
01:11:45.690 --> 01:11:50.280
And what that does is helps to apply water pressure on the arm and raise the

1089
01:11:50.281 --> 01:11:52.520
legs.
Right?
So my issue

1090
01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:55.860
<v 3>or what I thought was my,
I call that the trim tab effect.</v>

1091
01:11:56.230 --> 01:11:59.480
So shit that the trim tabs on an air airplane,

1092
01:11:59.510 --> 01:12:02.090
our airplane work to raise or lower the nose.

1093
01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:07.220
If you have something in front hydrodynamics and arrogant Amex or work exactly

1094
01:12:07.221 --> 01:12:12.200
the same.
And if you have something in front of the vessel that is angled down,

1095
01:12:12.201 --> 01:12:13.580
it's going to lift the rear.

1096
01:12:13.670 --> 01:12:18.670
And that's so the arm is acting as a trim tab for your body and effortlessly

1097
01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:24.110
lifting your legs to the surface,
meaning,
uh,
two,
two really important things.

1098
01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:24.740
Uh,

1099
01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:29.150
one is you save on the energy of caking and the second is you save a huge amount

1100
01:12:29.151 --> 01:12:33.380
of turbulence and drag.
So just,
you know,
using the arm in that way,

1101
01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:38.270
who would ever think that that's more important than pushing water back.

1102
01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.300
<v 1>What are some of the,</v>

1103
01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:45.840
the drills or exercises that you found most helpful for translating or

1104
01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:55.560
translating to most of the components you want to emphasize to one exercise?

1105
01:12:56.501 --> 01:12:59.440
So one that I've found just really,

1106
01:12:59.441 --> 01:13:04.330
really tremendously helpful was hand swapping.
Uh,

1107
01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:08.650
so if you could talk to perhaps you a front quadrant swimming a little bit,

1108
01:13:08.651 --> 01:13:13.050
but the idea that,
you know,
what,
what,
when in doubt,
if I feel like I'm,

1109
01:13:13.150 --> 01:13:16.390
I'm getting a little panicky or getting tired or whatever it might be,

1110
01:13:16.391 --> 01:13:19.270
I think of,
of hand swapping.
Uh,
could you,

1111
01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:23.110
could you describe what that means for people?

1112
01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:27.790
<v 3>Sure.
So our innate,
um,</v>

1113
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:31.680
primal instinct when we start swimming as to windmill,

1114
01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:35.810
the arms heedlessly just,
just turn away with the arms,

1115
01:13:35.811 --> 01:13:40.810
meaning generally the arms are going to be a 180 degrees apart,
um,

1116
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:42.260
or,
or close to it.

1117
01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:48.220
And not only are you not creating much propulsion by windmilling your arms,

1118
01:13:50.061 --> 01:13:53.780
you're also creating a whole lot of drag.
Um,

1119
01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:57.290
that's a sort of a fatal prescription for getting anywhere.

1120
01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:03.100
And so we always have prioritize what we call vessel shaping or shaping,

1121
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:10.040
shaping your humans swimming body to minimize drag during all moments in the

1122
01:14:10.041 --> 01:14:10.874
stroke.

1123
01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:15.100
And so the first thing you can do to minimize drag is use your arm to lengthen

1124
01:14:15.101 --> 01:14:18.940
your body.
The longer the body is,
the less the less drag there is.

1125
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:23.480
And then you need to think a little bit about stroke timing in,

1126
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:24.490
in terms of that,

1127
01:14:24.491 --> 01:14:29.491
because you want to keep the body long for a bit more of the recovery.

1128
01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:33.370
The recovery is when you bring in your arm forward.
Um,

1129
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:38.430
so essentially we are teaching people to leave the extended arm forward until

1130
01:14:39.581 --> 01:14:43.930
the other arm is just about to re enter the water after completing and three

1131
01:14:43.931 --> 01:14:48.070
covering and uh,
and not simply to leave it there,

1132
01:14:48.071 --> 01:14:51.880
but to hold your place to,
uh,

1133
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:54.800
to actively use your hand,
uh,

1134
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:59.500
to hold your place because you're going to spear the other hand.
Once you,

1135
01:14:59.501 --> 01:15:04.120
once you enter the water,
you're going to spirit past your grip and use,
uh,

1136
01:15:04.121 --> 01:15:07.750
use power from the high side of the body to move passenger Grep.

1137
01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:11.200
So instead of propelling with just your arm and shoulder muscles,

1138
01:15:11.201 --> 01:15:12.910
you're propelling with your whole body.

1139
01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:15.970
<v 1>So this is,
I mean,</v>

1140
01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:21.010
we're really deconstructing in a way is progressive mastery of a given skill.

1141
01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.470
It would seem to me,

1142
01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:31.590
and you I know are a big fan of a book titled Mastery by George Leonard.

1143
01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:36.340
Right.
Can you tell us about how you,

1144
01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:41.230
how you found that book and your experience in,
in reading it?

1145
01:15:41.231 --> 01:15:45.610
I'd like to dig into it just a little bit because I think it's widely

1146
01:15:45.611 --> 01:15:46.444
applicable.

1147
01:15:46.730 --> 01:15:50.810
<v 3>Yeah.
Sometime in the 1990s,
uh,</v>

1148
01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:55.820
somebody,
someone brought to my attention,
a magazine article he had,

1149
01:15:55.910 --> 01:16:00.080
he had written for I believe,
Esquire,
uh,

1150
01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:03.110
the in,
in the late eighties,

1151
01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:08.140
and it was more reprints where request of that article then any other article

1152
01:16:08.481 --> 01:16:11.900
they would,
they had ever printed in it.
And,
uh,
it was about mastery.

1153
01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:17.260
And the story George was telling was that of taking up I kido at age 47 very

1154
01:16:18.771 --> 01:16:23.771
advanced age and then becoming the latest starter ever to reach the,

1155
01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:30.800
to reach the master teacher level.
And I Kido,
uh,
and,

1156
01:16:30.801 --> 01:16:34.940
and how did he manage,
uh,
manage to accomplish that?

1157
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.480
And it was,
it was just a set of,
um,

1158
01:16:38.930 --> 01:16:42.890
a set of prescriptions or principals,
uh,
for,

1159
01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:45.770
for attaining mastery.
And,
and,
you know,
the,

1160
01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:49.790
the essential idea of,
of this,
this,

1161
01:16:49.791 --> 01:16:53.120
that life is not designed to make things easy for us,

1162
01:16:53.121 --> 01:16:57.860
but to present us with challenges that help us grow.
Uh,

1163
01:16:57.861 --> 01:17:02.390
and that we should embrace these challenges.
And,
uh,
and you know,

1164
01:17:02.391 --> 01:17:05.870
something you've done for many years,
Tim,
um,

1165
01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:09.890
that we should embrace these challenges.
And if we apply behaviors,

1166
01:17:09.891 --> 01:17:12.970
we're going to,
we're going to experience a lot more success.
And,

1167
01:17:12.971 --> 01:17:16.280
and so the behaviors he cited were,
first of all,

1168
01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:20.900
always be focused on improving the skill itself.

1169
01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:25.970
And anytime you are doing it,
you're focused on improving the skill,
uh,
the,

1170
01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:27.710
the amount of time you spend,

1171
01:17:27.711 --> 01:17:32.450
what your heart rate is or any of that is secondary to doing things that improve

1172
01:17:32.451 --> 01:17:37.100
the scale.
Uh,
a second is to focus on weak points.

1173
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:42.500
Uh,
don't focus on your strengths.
A third,
and I really love this one,

1174
01:17:42.501 --> 01:17:47.501
this one is my favorite is to love the plateau a in anything we learn.

1175
01:17:49.190 --> 01:17:49.461
Uh,

1176
01:17:49.461 --> 01:17:53.930
we initially as we're working our way through the most basic and easiest skills

1177
01:17:53.931 --> 01:17:55.460
we learned pretty rapidly.

1178
01:17:55.910 --> 01:18:00.350
And then things start to slow down and then things may slow down to the point

1179
01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:05.600
where you only experience a breakthrough every six to 12 months or so.

1180
01:18:06.230 --> 01:18:10.820
And George George Leonard wrote that,
uh,

1181
01:18:10.821 --> 01:18:13.460
when you practice with,

1182
01:18:13.461 --> 01:18:17.000
with a guided by the principles of mastery,

1183
01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:22.310
there is always positive change taking place at the cellular level,

1184
01:18:22.311 --> 01:18:24.710
below your threshold of awareness.

1185
01:18:25.190 --> 01:18:29.480
And that periodically this change consolidates into a thrilling leap forward,

1186
01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:32.840
which was very much my own experience.

1187
01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:37.460
I proved it to myself with my own experience where by the time I had been,

1188
01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.700
by the time I had been swimming 50 years,
in other words,

1189
01:18:40.701 --> 01:18:45.680
I'm in my mid sixties and I've,
I've really been swimming 50 years,

1190
01:18:45.681 --> 01:18:48.530
maybe even a,
uh,
you know,
51 52 years.

1191
01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:51.350
I was still learning things that thrilled me.

1192
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:56.030
I was still getting insights about my own stroke that weren't literally

1193
01:18:56.031 --> 01:19:00.230
thrilling and they were coming at really,
really long intervals.

1194
01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:06.560
And so having read George Leonard,
you know,
long before I was in my sixties,

1195
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:09.980
I was really prepared for that eventuality.

1196
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:15.550
<v 1>Can you teach people to love the plateau or are there ingredients that help</v>

1197
01:19:16.551 --> 01:19:21.200
people to persist through a plateau?

1198
01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:24.950
Uh,
what,
what and,
and if so,
what are they?

1199
01:19:24.951 --> 01:19:29.951
Because I think that this is such a common quitting point for a lot of people

1200
01:19:32.391 --> 01:19:36.860
where they,
they are,
uh,
myself included.
I'm not immune to this.
Uh,

1201
01:19:37.490 --> 01:19:39.400
we'll get the sort of the,

1202
01:19:39.401 --> 01:19:44.401
the sugar high of the initial Aha moments and making rapid progress in rapid

1203
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:50.360
experiencing rapid change.
And then,
oh,
now it's very,

1204
01:19:50.361 --> 01:19:51.141
very incremental.

1205
01:19:51.141 --> 01:19:55.670
Now it's barely perceptible and I feel like I'm not making progress or even

1206
01:19:55.671 --> 01:19:58.070
backsliding.
How,
how do you,

1207
01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:03.760
how would you help someone to persist through plateau,

1208
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:08.040
that plateau and I suppose learned to love it

1209
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:08.873
<v 4>if possible.</v>

1210
01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:12.030
<v 3>Yeah.
Well I think there's a couple of things now.</v>

1211
01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:14.650
I think one of the things you want to do is give,

1212
01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:19.780
give them enough of the right sort of information about the foundations of

1213
01:20:21.321 --> 01:20:26.321
excellence in what they have taken up a that they become curious to learn more.

1214
01:20:27.651 --> 01:20:28.101
So,

1215
01:20:28.101 --> 01:20:32.750
so first you need to stimulate their curiosity and eventually you get to what I

1216
01:20:32.751 --> 01:20:34.580
hope for,
you know,

1217
01:20:34.581 --> 01:20:39.560
for everyone I teach I hope becomes passionate curiosity,
uh,
where you know,

1218
01:20:39.561 --> 01:20:44.561
so you move from curiosity to being really intrigued to wanting to really solve

1219
01:20:45.351 --> 01:20:49.370
this,
to becoming passionate about it.
Uh,
and it's,

1220
01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:52.760
it's that hierarchy.
You've got to love what you're doing.
Um,

1221
01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:56.840
and they're,
you know,
there's,

1222
01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:58.610
there's a a good deal,

1223
01:20:59.150 --> 01:21:03.650
there's a good deal of evidence about what causes people to love what they're

1224
01:21:03.651 --> 01:21:07.220
doing.
And one of the most important is,

1225
01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:10.820
is simply the goal of enjoying enjoy it.
Today,

1226
01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:15.890
if I'm going to work out for an hour,
my goal is to enjoy my,
my hour of workout.

1227
01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:19.970
At the beginning of the year.
Uh,
health clubs all oversee,

1228
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.590
see a flock of people signing up and they sign up far more people than they can

1229
01:21:24.591 --> 01:21:29.060
actually serve because they know that about two thirds of them are going to not

1230
01:21:29.061 --> 01:21:31.970
use their membership.
Uh,
they're gonna,
you know,

1231
01:21:31.971 --> 01:21:35.480
they're going to start out with all the fire and then lose it and stop going to

1232
01:21:35.481 --> 01:21:39.320
the gym.
And uh,
there there's been,

1233
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:43.820
there's been a pretty authoritative study that showed the main difference

1234
01:21:43.821 --> 01:21:46.490
between the people who continued using their membership.

1235
01:21:46.491 --> 01:21:51.491
And those who do not was that those who we use stop using their membership had

1236
01:21:51.891 --> 01:21:52.671
in mind some,

1237
01:21:52.671 --> 01:21:57.671
some benefit they might receive in six months time while the people who use

1238
01:21:58.191 --> 01:22:03.170
their membership and stayed with it.
Uh,
just enjoyed going to the gym every day.

1239
01:22:03.170 --> 01:22:06.660
They did things that brought them pleasure,
uh,
in the moment.

1240
01:22:06.661 --> 01:22:10.040
So I think pleasure in the moment.
This is really important.

1241
01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:14.780
And the other thing is you've got to be really engaged with it.
And it's,

1242
01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:20.840
if I see people on the aerobic equipment at,
at my gym,
what do I see?
Well,

1243
01:22:20.841 --> 01:22:24.920
some of them are reading books and disassociating from what they're doing and

1244
01:22:24.921 --> 01:22:27.500
others are really paying attention to what they're doing.

1245
01:22:27.501 --> 01:22:31.730
They may be using an elliptical machine or a or running treadmill or something

1246
01:22:31.731 --> 01:22:33.110
for the umpteenth time,

1247
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:38.090
but there's still finding details about how they use that machine,

1248
01:22:38.570 --> 01:22:40.430
uh,
that are worth their attention.

1249
01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:44.210
<v 4>So what,
uh,
what might some of those details be?
And I'll,</v>

1250
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:48.770
I'll add a few that I found helpful,
uh,
for

1251
01:22:50.690 --> 01:22:55.460
persisting in the face of a potential,

1252
01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:59.810
say,
technical plateau,
right?
Or even strength plateau for instance,

1253
01:22:59.811 --> 01:23:03.200
in the case of strength training.
So a few things that,
that help me to continue.

1254
01:23:03.201 --> 01:23:07.720
Number one is in the case of swimming,

1255
01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:12.780
recognizing the sort of beneficial mental shift and uh,

1256
01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.880
emotional psychological shift that takes place in me.

1257
01:23:15.881 --> 01:23:20.881
Even if I am not a swimming more laps or improving times,

1258
01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:28.080
my state coming out of the pool is almost always better than it was going into

1259
01:23:28.091 --> 01:23:30.310
the pool.
I just feel better.

1260
01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:34.600
And so that has benefits even if I'm not say,

1261
01:23:34.601 --> 01:23:38.920
developing towards being a top competitive swimmer.
Uh,
the second,

1262
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:43.930
and this is true for me in almost everything,
but I have measurables.
Uh,
so,

1263
01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:48.220
and it doesn't mean that I'm tracking my measurables from workout to workout,

1264
01:23:48.221 --> 01:23:52.750
but it gives me,
I found,
I find the act of counting very meditative.

1265
01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:56.350
Uh,
so the fact that I have,
for instance,
in weight training,

1266
01:23:56.351 --> 01:23:58.330
usually there's a cadence.
Let's say it's two seconds up,

1267
01:23:58.331 --> 01:24:01.510
four seconds down or yesterday I did a workout where I was doing five seconds
up,

1268
01:24:01.511 --> 01:24:03.610
five seconds down.
So there's a,
there's a,

1269
01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:06.880
there's a tempo counting and then there's a repetition counting.

1270
01:24:06.881 --> 01:24:11.440
And then I'm logging the sets and I find for whatever reason that increases my

1271
01:24:11.441 --> 01:24:15.640
adherence to something.
If I have a,
a quantification.
In the case of swimming,

1272
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.990
I have the one,
two,
three,
one,
two,
three of breathing on alternate sides.

1273
01:24:19.991 --> 01:24:23.650
And then I also have the strokes per length,

1274
01:24:24.130 --> 01:24:28.060
uh,
that I can focus on or the hand swapping drill.

1275
01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:30.060
And,
uh,
the,

1276
01:24:30.061 --> 01:24:35.061
the last that comes to mind is specifically as it relates to swimming because

1277
01:24:37.721 --> 01:24:38.471
there is,
I think,

1278
01:24:38.471 --> 01:24:41.980
still a tiny part of me in the back of my head that is afraid of drowning.

1279
01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:42.370
I mean,
there's,

1280
01:24:42.370 --> 01:24:47.080
there's a tiny part that still has the fear accumulated over 30 years.

1281
01:24:47.620 --> 01:24:51.550
Uh,
and,
uh,
I'm,
I'm comfortable in the water,

1282
01:24:51.610 --> 01:24:56.610
but what I think helps me to continue to want to go back to the pool is always

1283
01:24:57.911 --> 01:25:00.250
doing less than what I feel capable of doing,

1284
01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:04.690
which is very much the opposite of what I've done almost every,

1285
01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:08.770
in almost every other place,
not everywhere,
but in the case of swimming,

1286
01:25:08.771 --> 01:25:10.840
there are a few other places,
uh,

1287
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:14.950
where you have fine motor skill.
Uh,

1288
01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:16.240
tennis also true,

1289
01:25:16.630 --> 01:25:20.740
doing less than I feel is possible.
So in other words,

1290
01:25:20.741 --> 01:25:24.460
stopping before my technique really deteriorates.
Sam,

1291
01:25:24.490 --> 01:25:28.860
how long do you usually swim?
I swim for very short periods of time.
Uh,

1292
01:25:28.861 --> 01:25:30.350
I would say,
uh,

1293
01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:34.840
typically less than 45 minutes.
Very good.

1294
01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:39.010
That's what I,
that's what I would recommend to most people.
Okay,
got it.
Yeah,

1295
01:25:39.011 --> 01:25:43.210
I mean,
I would say very often I'll go in and I'll do 20 to 30 minutes.
It's not,

1296
01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:47.590
it's not a,
it's not a long workout.

1297
01:25:47.591 --> 01:25:49.390
And I try not to view it as a workout.

1298
01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:54.420
It's really in a practice of moving meditation for me.

1299
01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:56.253
Uh,

1300
01:25:56.650 --> 01:26:01.570
and if I want to smash my body in some type of other training,
that's fine.

1301
01:26:01.571 --> 01:26:04.100
But in the pool,
I view it more as a

1302
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:08.810
<v 3>practice in elegance and efficiency to the,</v>

1303
01:26:08.811 --> 01:26:12.260
to the greatest extent possible.
You're moving through a fluid,

1304
01:26:12.261 --> 01:26:16.040
what could be better than flow in your on moment.
Right,
right.

1305
01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:19.610
Uh,
now I,
you know,
there's,
there's,
uh,
I see,

1306
01:26:19.611 --> 01:26:23.990
I took a note here and I don't know the story,
so I'll bring it up.
This is,

1307
01:26:23.991 --> 01:26:28.070
it looks like from 2000 and,
uh,

1308
01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:31.700
the story of Phil Cruz.
Uh,

1309
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:37.330
can you tell me who fill cruises and what happened in 2000?

1310
01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:45.170
Yeah.
Uh,
I think,
I think I,
maybe 1999,

1311
01:26:45.171 --> 01:26:49.730
I did a workshop in Chapel Hill.
We had maybe 20,
20 a 10 days.

1312
01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:51.490
Um,
and,
uh,

1313
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:56.830
we had one in particular who was the most challenged student that I had yet

1314
01:26:59.931 --> 01:27:03.710
seen.
Um,
he did what Sarah did,
uh,

1315
01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:06.370
during our first video taping,
uh,

1316
01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:11.420
thrashed about five strokes and stood up to breathe.
And,
and that was it.

1317
01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:12.620
Uh,

1318
01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:17.540
and by the end of the two day workshop on Sunday afternoon,

1319
01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:19.670
it was a triumph for him to,

1320
01:27:19.730 --> 01:27:24.730
to not navigate one length of the pool continuously was with a hybrid between a,

1321
01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:29.420
between drilling and swimming.
It wasn't even the whole stroke.
Um,

1322
01:27:29.690 --> 01:27:31.780
so fast forward,
uh,

1323
01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:37.300
18 months and I'm teaching what we call a Kaizen camp,

1324
01:27:37.930 --> 01:27:41.150
uh,
in Florida.
And,
uh,

1325
01:27:41.170 --> 01:27:46.170
it's a four stroke camp if you want to learn all four strokes and being

1326
01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:51.560
freestyle,
backstroke,
breaststroke,
butterfly had and butterfly.
Correct.

1327
01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:55.640
And,
um,
they didn't have to do four strokes,

1328
01:27:55.641 --> 01:27:59.210
but they can do any number of the four that they wanted.
Uh,

1329
01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:04.240
and we videotaped everybody in the first session to get them before I'll be four

1330
01:28:04.581 --> 01:28:07.520
picture,
um,
any,
any of the strokes that you wanted.

1331
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:12.110
And while we were videotaping freestyle,
uh,
one of these,

1332
01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:15.140
one of these camp participants when the most

1333
01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:19.700
unbelievably beautiful freestyle at the,

1334
01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:22.790
at the level of our best coaches,
just that,

1335
01:28:22.791 --> 01:28:26.720
that sort of grace and fluency and ease.
Um,

1336
01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:31.350
and uh,
so,
uh,
you know,
after,

1337
01:28:31.351 --> 01:28:34.430
after word I said a where did you learn that?

1338
01:28:34.431 --> 01:28:37.480
And he said from you if he came,

1339
01:28:37.670 --> 01:28:41.270
he came clear that he was the person who had attended,
you know,

1340
01:28:41.271 --> 01:28:44.370
he'd been at that at a such a,

1341
01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:47.480
such a challenge when we're 18 months earlier in Chapel Hill.

1342
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:52.700
And not only that,
but,
uh,
he was a soybean farmer.

1343
01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:53.700
Um,
he,

1344
01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:57.680
he had previously worked in a management position and then became a gentleman

1345
01:28:57.681 --> 01:29:02.140
farmer after,
after retiring from that.
But he farmed soybeans and

1346
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:07.140
<v 2>coastal North Carolina and he was 25 miles from the nearest pool.</v>

1347
01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:12.120
So in that intervening 18 months,
I mean,
everybody we teach improves.

1348
01:29:12.150 --> 01:29:16.230
Okay.
So I'm not,
that's not the standard,
it's just I,

1349
01:29:16.290 --> 01:29:20.010
my mind was blown by the degree to which he improved.

1350
01:29:20.011 --> 01:29:22.410
And then I found out he did it entirely on his own.

1351
01:29:22.411 --> 01:29:26.070
He had no other resources or help or anything.
And you know,

1352
01:29:26.071 --> 01:29:31.071
it was just driving himself to the YMC 25 miles away and did it in nine and in,

1353
01:29:31.681 --> 01:29:33.180
in a year and a half on his own.

1354
01:29:33.240 --> 01:29:36.930
And I became what that stimulated in me.

1355
01:29:36.931 --> 01:29:41.370
It was a curiosity when shell someone shows absolutely no knack for something,

1356
01:29:41.850 --> 01:29:45.610
how do they get that good?
That was that,

1357
01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:47.340
that was something that really intrigued.

1358
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:52.310
<v 4>So what was the,
what were the,
what were the components?</v>

1359
01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:55.920
What were,
what went into his practice?
What did he do,

1360
01:29:56.690 --> 01:30:00.240
do you think that led to that degree of improvement?

1361
01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:03.310
<v 2>Yeah,
I,
you know,
I,
I'd say first of all,</v>

1362
01:30:03.311 --> 01:30:08.311
not everybody is as good as he is or as you were at self coaching.

1363
01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:14.140
Um,
so he started out,
it did start it out with some coaching,

1364
01:30:14.141 --> 01:30:18.370
but it was just two days of coaching and then 18 months on his own.
Um,

1365
01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:22.960
so I suppose he probably had probably pretty,

1366
01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:27.430
pretty well acquainted with a spotty for whatever reason.
Um,
that's,

1367
01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:30.100
that's one thing.
But the second thing is he,

1368
01:30:30.101 --> 01:30:35.101
I think he probably just faithfully followed through on practicing the drills

1369
01:30:35.921 --> 01:30:39.880
very patiently,
very attentively,
uh,

1370
01:30:39.881 --> 01:30:44.881
until he really understood them and constantly refined his,

1371
01:30:45.610 --> 01:30:47.470
his form and the drills and then,

1372
01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:51.850
and then taking whatever he learned from the drills and putting it into,

1373
01:30:51.851 --> 01:30:54.160
into whole stroke practices.
He probably gave not a,

1374
01:30:54.190 --> 01:30:57.760
not a moment's thought to speed or how far he was swimming.

1375
01:30:57.761 --> 01:30:59.600
I'll bet he did what you did Tim,

1376
01:30:59.650 --> 01:31:04.420
which was a to only practice for as long as he felt the practice was fruitful.

1377
01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:07.210
<v 4>The other were a,</v>

1378
01:31:07.810 --> 01:31:12.810
I mean a handful of things that I think in any practice for me at least help

1379
01:31:14.051 --> 01:31:17.440
with self coaching.
Uh,
the,

1380
01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:21.160
the first would be whenever possible having a,

1381
01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:26.270
uh,
as,
as they would say in the startup world,
a key performance indicator.

1382
01:31:26.271 --> 01:31:31.271
So what is the number that you are trying to improve week on week?

1383
01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:35.710
And uh,
there's,
there's actually a very famous,
for lack of,

1384
01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:37.990
or to keep it simple,

1385
01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:43.020
I'll say a startup incubator called y Combinator nicknamed YC based in Silicon

1386
01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:49.020
Valley that can be thought of as the Harvard meets seal team six of,

1387
01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:53.920
of,
of startup training.
And they bring in a very,

1388
01:31:53.921 --> 01:31:58.921
very small percentage of people who apply and work into the ground 24,

1389
01:32:00.911 --> 01:32:03.280
seven or these people don't really need help to do that.

1390
01:32:03.281 --> 01:32:07.390
They'll do it on their own and at the end they have a business that they pitch

1391
01:32:07.391 --> 01:32:12.150
to investors and so on.
And during that period,
uh,

1392
01:32:12.730 --> 01:32:17.730
they almost all choose a KPI key performance indicator.

1393
01:32:17.861 --> 01:32:22.060
And the goal is to say improve at 10% week on week.
So for me,

1394
01:32:22.061 --> 01:32:25.960
in swimming,
I decided early on with the help of,

1395
01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:28.270
of total immersion in book form.

1396
01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:33.300
And then later I got the DVDs was the stroke count,

1397
01:32:33.550 --> 01:32:36.820
the number of strokes per lap.
And that was my,

1398
01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:38.740
that was my true north.

1399
01:32:38.741 --> 01:32:43.741
Like anything that I did that hurt that I ended up either fixing or discarding

1400
01:32:44.111 --> 01:32:47.740
and anything I did that improved that I would continue practicing.

1401
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:52.570
And
then on top of that,

1402
01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:57.670
I would test all of these various drills and realized for myself that the hand

1403
01:32:57.671 --> 01:32:59.560
swapping drill,
not saying it's true for everyone,

1404
01:32:59.561 --> 01:33:04.561
but in my case focusing on that front quadrant swimming and the hand swapping

1405
01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:10.390
was what most quickly returned me to a very,

1406
01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:15.640
uh,
optimal for me and my skill level,
stroke per lap,
if that made sense.

1407
01:33:16.150 --> 01:33:18.520
Uh,
and then last,

1408
01:33:18.521 --> 01:33:22.990
and this is actually much easier now at the time go pro,
uh,

1409
01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:24.880
either didn't exist or was very,

1410
01:33:24.881 --> 01:33:28.660
very early and kind of a version one,

1411
01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:31.210
the one,
uh,
type technology,

1412
01:33:31.211 --> 01:33:36.211
but having some means of video observation or correction I just think is so

1413
01:33:38.771 --> 01:33:40.510
incredibly helpful.

1414
01:33:40.870 --> 01:33:44.680
And I've used that in a swimming to a lesser extent,

1415
01:33:44.681 --> 01:33:49.630
but only when we had the gear in Hawaii to do so.
And of course in my head,

1416
01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:52.990
I've been practicing total immersion for a while.
At that point I was like,
okay,

1417
01:33:52.991 --> 01:33:55.840
you know,
I,
I've,
I feel like my,
my technique's pretty good.

1418
01:33:55.841 --> 01:34:00.130
And then you see it on camera and you just want to cringe.
Uh,
and uh,

1419
01:34:00.131 --> 01:34:03.940
that was also true when I was in Argentina in 2004,

1420
01:34:03.941 --> 01:34:07.270
2005 and ended up competing in tango and I mean,

1421
01:34:07.271 --> 01:34:10.730
I ended up going to the world championships and making it to the semifinals,

1422
01:34:10.750 --> 01:34:15.160
but about,
I would say three months prior to that,

1423
01:34:15.161 --> 01:34:18.010
I remember I was two or three months into practicing tango.

1424
01:34:18.610 --> 01:34:23.050
Felt like I had really made a lot of progress.
I had been,
uh,

1425
01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:27.310
taking video of different instructors,
different dancers.

1426
01:34:27.311 --> 01:34:29.020
I'd been cataloguing technique.

1427
01:34:29.380 --> 01:34:34.380
I'd been writing down my specific goals for each as I viewed it practice

1428
01:34:35.621 --> 01:34:36.940
session,
slash,
workout.

1429
01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:41.890
And then I would have one or two things each day that I would work on in the

1430
01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:44.800
uncontrolled environment of a Milonga,
which is a dance hall.

1431
01:34:44.801 --> 01:34:46.780
So I thought I was not hot shit,

1432
01:34:46.781 --> 01:34:51.781
but I thought that I was really on my road to being a fantastic dancer.

1433
01:34:52.121 --> 01:34:55.600
And then I remember I went and I bought a video camera.
This is on Avine,

1434
01:34:55.610 --> 01:35:00.140
the Florida in we know,
say it is,
Eh,
where they have a lot of electronic store.

1435
01:35:00.141 --> 01:35:02.450
So I bought this camera,
took it to practice,

1436
01:35:02.451 --> 01:35:07.451
had somebody record me dancing with this woman and it was horrible.

1437
01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:10.223
It looked what,

1438
01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:15.240
what I was doing in my head and what I was doing on the camera were so different

1439
01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:18.260
that they would have been unrest.
I mean,

1440
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:23.030
you would never have paired my video to what I would have described myself
doing.

1441
01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:26.090
And that is what allowed me though,

1442
01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:29.120
that sort of harsh reality is what allowed me to really,
really,

1443
01:35:29.121 --> 01:35:31.160
really improve after that point.

1444
01:35:31.190 --> 01:35:35.870
Are there any other types of practice,
uh,

1445
01:35:35.930 --> 01:35:40.160
or types of self talk?
Uh,
any types of,

1446
01:35:41.330 --> 01:35:42.163
uh,

1447
01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:47.770
planning or journaling or anything that you have seen helpful,

1448
01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:53.000
uh,
or that you've observed in people who self coach?
Well,

1449
01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:55.460
because I think this is such an important skill.
If you're trying to get,

1450
01:35:55.490 --> 01:35:58.850
if you want to be an autodidact and most of the time,

1451
01:35:58.851 --> 01:36:03.610
even if you have access to good coaches,
you will be without a coach.
Uh,
you know,

1452
01:36:03.611 --> 01:36:04.041
what are,

1453
01:36:04.041 --> 01:36:09.020
what are some of the things that you've seen a contribute to good self coaching?

1454
01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:14.530
<v 3>Um,
yes,
a video,
very,
very important tool,</v>

1455
01:36:14.531 --> 01:36:16.870
very helpful tool for anything more movement Orient.

1456
01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:21.070
There has never been a time that I have them videotape that I was satisfied with

1457
01:36:21.071 --> 01:36:25.900
what I saw to this day.
Um,
but you know,

1458
01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:30.170
if I can cite my own experience,
um,
I,

1459
01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:34.660
because I had been my own total immersion coach all along.
Um,

1460
01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:39.190
I,
I got into,
you know,
once I,

1461
01:36:40.090 --> 01:36:45.090
I have to step back a little bit and talk about how my mind was open to how,

1462
01:36:45.610 --> 01:36:46.330
how much,

1463
01:36:46.330 --> 01:36:50.530
how much potential improvement was available to me that I had not realized that

1464
01:36:50.531 --> 01:36:55.510
all,
uh,
going back to bill boomer,
uh,
after I heard him talk at that clinic,

1465
01:36:55.511 --> 01:37:00.160
I,
I drove up to Rochester to watch him coach and see him put into practice the

1466
01:37:00.161 --> 01:37:03.570
things he talked about and pick his brain.
Um,

1467
01:37:03.850 --> 01:37:08.410
and one of the things that he talked about was that the keystone skill of

1468
01:37:08.411 --> 01:37:09.910
swimming was balanced.
Now,

1469
01:37:09.911 --> 01:37:13.090
I had never even heard of balance as a skill of swimming.

1470
01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:17.500
And he was saying it was the keystone to efficiency.
Uh,

1471
01:37:17.501 --> 01:37:22.080
so he talked about balance during the,
during the clinic thing.
And,
uh,

1472
01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:25.690
then when I went up,
I said,
Bill,
would you teach me something about balance?

1473
01:37:26.050 --> 01:37:27.130
So he,

1474
01:37:27.190 --> 01:37:31.270
he taught me a drill that he called pressing the bully or print pressing the t,

1475
01:37:31.271 --> 01:37:32.860
excuse me.
Um,

1476
01:37:32.890 --> 01:37:37.060
he called it pressing the t where you would have your arms at your sides and be

1477
01:37:37.061 --> 01:37:41.860
flood or kicking with your head in line with your spine and lean on your chest

1478
01:37:41.861 --> 01:37:44.830
as you do.
So.
So I did that.

1479
01:37:45.100 --> 01:37:50.100
And I had spent 25 years thinking I had the misfortune to be born with heavy

1480
01:37:50.471 --> 01:37:54.790
legs.
It's a bad thing as a swimmer to be born with heavy legs.

1481
01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:59.070
And I spent a quarter century thinking I was doomed.
Yeah.
Um,

1482
01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:02.670
and in 10 seconds doing this drill at that,

1483
01:38:02.671 --> 01:38:05.760
that whole concept was exploded because my legs were light.

1484
01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:08.880
And I never realized that I could,
you know,

1485
01:38:08.881 --> 01:38:11.610
I had the power to do something to change that.

1486
01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:15.870
Can you explain the drill one more time please?
Yeah,
yeah.
We,
we,
uh,

1487
01:38:15.871 --> 01:38:18.210
we teach it today.
We call it torpedo boat.

1488
01:38:18.211 --> 01:38:19.800
We do it without the flutter kick butt.

1489
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:24.810
But essentially you put your arms at your sides and you glide with your head in

1490
01:38:24.811 --> 01:38:27.960
line with your spine kicking gently and,

1491
01:38:28.010 --> 01:38:30.180
and lean a little bit on your chest.

1492
01:38:30.181 --> 01:38:34.310
And what you feel is your hips and legs become lighter.
They're,

1493
01:38:34.311 --> 01:38:38.580
they're lifted by the,
by a lever effect.
You,
you know,

1494
01:38:38.581 --> 01:38:40.350
a lever effect of leaning.

1495
01:38:40.351 --> 01:38:44.250
What's the most buoyant part of your body is your chest.
You've got a,

1496
01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:48.980
you've got about you,
you,
you've got,
um,
a,
uh,

1497
01:38:49.230 --> 01:38:51.900
s your lungs in there that holds six liters of air.

1498
01:38:51.901 --> 01:38:56.670
That's the most buoyant part of the body.
Um,
and um,

1499
01:38:56.700 --> 01:39:01.470
so when you lean,
it's like pressing,
pressing a volleyball into the water,

1500
01:39:01.471 --> 01:39:04.020
press,
press down on a volleyball,
it's going to push back.

1501
01:39:04.021 --> 01:39:05.040
So if you keep pressing,

1502
01:39:05.041 --> 01:39:08.220
it's gonna push back somewhere else and it lifts up your hips and legs.

1503
01:39:09.870 --> 01:39:11.370
Got It.
And that's,

1504
01:39:11.490 --> 01:39:15.420
he called that pressing the t because the t was the intersection of your spine

1505
01:39:15.421 --> 01:39:19.820
and a,
if you stretch your arms out to the side,
that's us.

1506
01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:21.320
Yeah.

1507
01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:24.770
<v 4>So there's Shit I was,</v>

1508
01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:29.090
I was spending on maybe talking about this earlier,
but,
uh,

1509
01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:31.400
I want to be respectful of your time and I,

1510
01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:36.440
I also want to make sure that we chat about your cancer diagnosis.

1511
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:42.590
And I have,
I have some questions about that,
but could you tell people the,

1512
01:39:43.990 --> 01:39:47.830
uh,
the origin of the cancer diagnosis and,
uh,

1513
01:39:48.260 --> 01:39:52.040
perhaps just explain the circumstances?

1514
01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:56.730
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah.
I'm just,
about two years ago,
uh,</v>

1515
01:39:56.731 --> 01:39:59.730
I went with two friends,
uh,

1516
01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:04.150
to Sardinia and we swam from course ago,

1517
01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:08.970
which is in France to start.
Danny and I had an unbelievably great swim.

1518
01:40:08.971 --> 01:40:13.650
I had,
you know,
I had been not training exceptionally hard for it.
It's a,

1519
01:40:13.651 --> 01:40:17.970
it's a 10 mile swim.
Uh,
the water temperature was 64,

1520
01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:20.470
65.
Uh,

1521
01:40:20.670 --> 01:40:25.440
and it took us four and a half hours and that was stopping every 30 minutes.

1522
01:40:25.441 --> 01:40:28.920
So there were seven stops for,
for to have a feed,

1523
01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:30.930
which happened to be blueberry soup.

1524
01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:35.780
One of my co swimmers was from Sweden and build Bettis blow bars.

1525
01:40:35.790 --> 01:40:39.690
Sopa uh,
and um,

1526
01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:44.460
just an incredible swim.
One of the best swims in my life.
I,
uh,

1527
01:40:44.610 --> 01:40:45.750
and uh,

1528
01:40:45.810 --> 01:40:50.810
so I came home and within a week of coming home I,

1529
01:40:51.241 --> 01:40:55.500
I got a,
I had my annual physical and my,

1530
01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:57.620
my doctor,
uh,

1531
01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:01.030
found some irregularities when he examined my prostate and he said,

1532
01:41:01.031 --> 01:41:03.490
you need to get a biopsy for me,
urologist.

1533
01:41:03.490 --> 01:41:08.380
I went very quickly to get the biopsy and the biopsy turned out to be positive

1534
01:41:08.381 --> 01:41:13.381
for cancer and it was what's called a Gleason score of four plus three or seven.

1535
01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:18.970
And what's significant about that is the number four in indicates how aggressive

1536
01:41:18.971 --> 01:41:23.140
the cancer is.
And four indicated it was an aggressive cancer.

1537
01:41:23.141 --> 01:41:26.170
So it was one that needed to be treated.
A lot of,
a lot of times today,

1538
01:41:26.171 --> 01:41:30.130
what they try to do is it's just watch and wait as much as possible cause they

1539
01:41:30.131 --> 01:41:33.640
overtreated for quite a while.
Uh,
but in my case,

1540
01:41:33.641 --> 01:41:36.760
it was clear that I needed to get treatment.
I went to,

1541
01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:39.880
I found a surgeon to do a robotic,

1542
01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:44.020
a radical robotic prostatectomy.
It's called the Da Vinci Surgery.

1543
01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:48.580
And a was scheduled for surgery.
Um,

1544
01:41:49.450 --> 01:41:50.290
and uh,

1545
01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:54.130
but beforehand he said to get some scans down and one of the scan showed that I

1546
01:41:54.131 --> 01:41:54.431
was,

1547
01:41:54.431 --> 01:41:59.431
I was already in stage four a that the cancer had already metastasized to my

1548
01:41:59.441 --> 01:42:03.840
bones.
So no surgery since then.
It's been treat the systemic,
uh,

1549
01:42:03.890 --> 01:42:07.770
so it's two years since I'm a diagnosis.
And this is a,

1550
01:42:07.780 --> 01:42:12.400
this ride of cancer I have is called metastatic castration resistant cancer,

1551
01:42:12.401 --> 01:42:16.240
which is sort of a nasty term.
Uh,
just means that the first,

1552
01:42:16.270 --> 01:42:19.930
the first treatment they give you is hormones and the hormones are meant to

1553
01:42:19.931 --> 01:42:24.880
suppress testosterone.
So I have the testosterone have a 66 year old woman now.

1554
01:42:25.690 --> 01:42:27.720
Uh,
but,
uh,
it's,

1555
01:42:27.721 --> 01:42:32.721
it's a very nasty form of cancer and typically 24 to 30 months survival time

1556
01:42:32.771 --> 01:42:36.760
after you are diagnosed.
So that was pretty sobering dose.

1557
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:38.620
<v 4>How are you,</v>

1558
01:42:40.050 --> 01:42:40.420
<v 5>okay.</v>

1559
01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:44.800
<v 4>Uh,
what did,
what have you seen in yourself?</v>

1560
01:42:44.801 --> 01:42:48.490
I mean in our interactions,
at least via email,

1561
01:42:48.491 --> 01:42:52.210
text and so on.
And certainly even speaking with you,
I mean,
you,

1562
01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:53.520
you seem very,

1563
01:42:54.530 --> 01:42:55.363
<v 5>uh,</v>

1564
01:42:56.470 --> 01:43:01.320
<v 4>beat and optimistic and very engaged with total immersion,</v>

1565
01:43:01.321 --> 01:43:02.190
for instance.

1566
01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:03.213
<v 5>Uh,</v>

1567
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:06.220
<v 4>what changes have you observed in yourself,</v>

1568
01:43:06.221 --> 01:43:10.960
just mentally or psychologically since the diagnosis?

1569
01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:15.470
<v 3>Yeah,
I,
you know,
I went through a roller coaster the first,
uh,</v>

1570
01:43:15.471 --> 01:43:18.880
six to eight months afterward where,
you know,

1571
01:43:18.890 --> 01:43:22.430
first I felt sorry for myself and then the news kept getting worse.
Like I,

1572
01:43:22.431 --> 01:43:26.630
I didn't find out that I had the worst variety of prostate cancer right away.

1573
01:43:26.650 --> 01:43:31.010
It took a while for the,
for the failure of my,
uh,

1574
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:34.160
my hormone treatment failed in two months.
Uh,

1575
01:43:34.161 --> 01:43:37.820
the cancer started growing again and they usually look for two years of,
of,

1576
01:43:37.821 --> 01:43:41.780
of cancer suppression from that.
And,
uh,
you know,

1577
01:43:41.781 --> 01:43:45.260
my oncologist said,
I said to be straight with me on this doc.

1578
01:43:45.261 --> 01:43:49.550
And you said it's the far side of bad nose.
Uh,
so,
you know,

1579
01:43:49.551 --> 01:43:53.480
I was going through a rollercoaster where the newest kept getting more sobering

1580
01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:57.830
and,
uh,
I,
I was feeling anger,

1581
01:43:57.831 --> 01:44:02.030
anxiety,
not depression,
ever.
Never.

1582
01:44:02.630 --> 01:44:04.700
Yeah.
Never,
never depression,
but,
uh,

1583
01:44:04.730 --> 01:44:09.140
but I felt quite a bit of anxiety to the point where it,
you know,
it'd be,

1584
01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:12.740
it was out of control and I,
I sought treatment for anxiety,

1585
01:44:12.741 --> 01:44:16.850
which had never thought I would ever need in my life.
Um,

1586
01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:19.160
so the first six to eight months where like that,

1587
01:44:19.190 --> 01:44:23.180
but then with the help of the antianxiety medication,

1588
01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:28.160
I'm on Lexapro and Abilify and I don't mind,
I don't mind admitting it.

1589
01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:32.540
It's worked.
Um,
it's enabled me to reclaim who,

1590
01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:36.290
who I always was,
which is a person who's driven by a purpose.

1591
01:44:36.291 --> 01:44:40.700
And the purpose is to change,
uh,
change the way people swim.
I mean,

1592
01:44:40.701 --> 01:44:45.660
literally to change the way swimming is taught and practiced in this world.
Um,

1593
01:44:46.010 --> 01:44:46.611
it's an,

1594
01:44:46.611 --> 01:44:50.570
I've always had such a powerful sense of purpose and I wake up with that sense

1595
01:44:50.571 --> 01:44:54.410
of purpose every day.
And,
and I have to say that in the past,

1596
01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:58.850
um,
probably 16 months now,

1597
01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:03.560
I haven't experienced any anxiety.
I haven't experienced any depression.

1598
01:45:03.561 --> 01:45:04.221
I wake up,

1599
01:45:04.221 --> 01:45:09.170
I still wake up every morning fired up to do what I'm going to do that day too,

1600
01:45:09.171 --> 01:45:11.510
which today is your podcast

1601
01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:16.870
<v 1>and which,
which I couldn't be happier about.</v>

1602
01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:20.320
And I'm thrilled to have you on.
I mean I,

1603
01:45:20.450 --> 01:45:25.040
I wish we could spend some more time together.
Um,

1604
01:45:25.210 --> 01:45:28.150
so I hope to,
I mean we,
uh,
we,
we had a chance,

1605
01:45:28.330 --> 01:45:32.950
which was really exciting for me after learning Tai through the book and seeing

1606
01:45:32.951 --> 01:45:33.840
freeze frames,

1607
01:45:33.841 --> 01:45:38.841
a view with all the diagrams showing correct direction and so on,

1608
01:45:39.131 --> 01:45:41.470
to actually,
uh,

1609
01:45:41.530 --> 01:45:45.880
get in the water in Hawaii with Sarah and to swim with you is just such a

1610
01:45:45.881 --> 01:45:48.790
highlight for me.
Such,
such a wonderful experience

1611
01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:54.110
<v 3>for May as well.
And I,
I really feel the need to say this about that.
I,
you know,</v>

1612
01:45:54.111 --> 01:45:58.640
knowing all you have on your plate and especially in the midst of that TV

1613
01:45:58.641 --> 01:46:01.930
production,
uh,
and,
um,

1614
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:05.600
knowing what I know about your,
your hunger to learn new things,

1615
01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:09.140
I just had always assumed,
cause you know,
we were,

1616
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:13.640
we were friends from a distance and we met for Medford dinner in San Francisco

1617
01:46:13.641 --> 01:46:17.300
one time.
But you know,
we were friends from the distance with periodic contacts.

1618
01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:20.630
When you wanted to make another mention,
thank you.

1619
01:46:20.900 --> 01:46:25.010
Of total immersion and one of your books,
um,
that when I,

1620
01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:26.840
when I arrived in Hawaii,

1621
01:46:26.841 --> 01:46:31.520
I was so impressed as to see how strong your hungers remained,

1622
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.450
uh,
to improve your swimming.
And I thought like,
you know,
it's not,

1623
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:39.110
it's not a box he wanted to check off at all.
He really cares about this.

1624
01:46:39.111 --> 01:46:43.610
So I saw that and I was really impressed and happy about that.

1625
01:46:44.380 --> 01:46:49.180
<v 1>Thank you.
Yeah,
it,
uh,
it's really been a</v>

1626
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:55.040
<v 4>foundational skill for changing my life for the better.</v>

1627
01:46:55.770 --> 01:46:57.960
And furthermore,
I mean,

1628
01:46:57.961 --> 01:47:01.260
it's given me this toolkit,

1629
01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:05.400
which is very clear,
very counterintuitive,

1630
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:10.430
but very clear with which I've been able to,

1631
01:47:10.940 --> 01:47:15.060
uh,
take part of course just drafting on what you're doing.

1632
01:47:15.090 --> 01:47:19.950
But in say,
helping Sarah and watching that complete transformation take place,

1633
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:23.520
uh,
and helping some of my friends who I've,

1634
01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:28.580
I've run into who say the same thing that I said when I was say 25 and they say,

1635
01:47:28.801 --> 01:47:31.350
Oh yeah,
I just don't swim.
No,
I'm just not comfortable in the water.

1636
01:47:31.470 --> 01:47:34.200
And usually what I'll say to that is,
well,

1637
01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:39.090
why don't we just take an afternoon and come with me to a pool and we'll just

1638
01:47:39.091 --> 01:47:44.040
find a lane that's four feet deep and let's fix that.
And they're like,

1639
01:47:44.041 --> 01:47:47.010
what?
What do you mean fix it?
But like,
I don't have time

1640
01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:52.740
to teach others.
I love that there's nothing I like better.
Uh,
and it's,

1641
01:47:52.741 --> 01:47:54.080
and it's just the end.

1642
01:47:54.210 --> 01:47:58.830
It's really just getting them to that point that I experienced with total

1643
01:47:58.831 --> 01:48:03.210
immersion.
And after the first day of training,
which is,
oh my God,

1644
01:48:03.211 --> 01:48:05.570
I can actually do this,
which is,
I mean,

1645
01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:10.620
similar to the experience that you had with the drill you did with pressing down

1646
01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:14.280
that you now teach us torpedo,
where you realize,
oh my God,

1647
01:48:14.281 --> 01:48:18.030
this story that I've been telling myself,
my legs are heavy,

1648
01:48:18.031 --> 01:48:21.540
I'm just cursed with heavy legs is completely,

1649
01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:26.520
it's either unfounded or completely fixable.
Right?
And what else am I,

1650
01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:27.420
what am else else?

1651
01:48:27.421 --> 01:48:30.540
Am I capable of changing about my swimming and it's turned out there's nothing I

1652
01:48:30.541 --> 01:48:33.570
can change.
Yeah.
Or or your life,
right?

1653
01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:38.600
See if this impossible is not just possible,

1654
01:48:39.631 --> 01:48:43.290
right?
Like Tim Ferriss cannot swim is not only

1655
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:45.890
possible to fix,

1656
01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:50.920
but in fact easy to fix a with the proper counterintuitive teaching and

1657
01:48:52.761 --> 01:48:56.690
progression in this cage case,
which is total immersion.
I mean it's,

1658
01:48:57.020 --> 01:49:00.350
it's such,
it's such a demonstration.

1659
01:49:00.351 --> 01:49:05.351
It's such a profound demonstration of possibility for me that I really encourage

1660
01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:11.030
anyone who's listening to this,
and I'll say this also in the intro,

1661
01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:13.520
who is

1662
01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:20.620
unable to swim or views themselves as being unable to swim or is a poor swimmer

1663
01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:26.320
to just try this because it will open your eyes in such a way that you not only

1664
01:49:29.031 --> 01:49:31.310
look at swimming and water differently,
but you will,

1665
01:49:31.550 --> 01:49:35.870
you will look at other skills in your life differently as well.
Uh,
I mean,

1666
01:49:35.871 --> 01:49:38.780
after total immersion,
that's when I started asking myself,

1667
01:49:39.140 --> 01:49:40.880
what are the other impossibles,

1668
01:49:40.881 --> 01:49:43.460
what are the other things I've told myself I just can't do,

1669
01:49:43.461 --> 01:49:46.940
like play basketball or,
or shoot a basketball was another one.

1670
01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:50.590
Let me reexamine that.
And then I found,
uh,

1671
01:49:51.730 --> 01:49:56.730
a method that is sort of a corollary in a sense to total immersion,

1672
01:49:57.431 --> 01:50:00.610
but for basketball,
it turns out,
I think I'm,
I might be getting the name wrong,

1673
01:50:00.611 --> 01:50:01.580
but I think it's Rick Torb.

1674
01:50:01.581 --> 01:50:06.581
It teaches basketball shooting in a way that you would find very much,

1675
01:50:08.790 --> 01:50:13.480
uh,
a close cousin to Tii and it just makes sense.
And I was like,
okay,
wow,
okay.

1676
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:15.760
That's two for two.
Now,
what else is there?

1677
01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:18.770
I thought I thought the same thing when you,
when you described your,

1678
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:22.260
your first tennis lesson.
Exactly.
Oh yeah.
My rent late.

1679
01:50:22.270 --> 01:50:25.960
And Laura Lorenzo's same story.
The way that he teaches.
Like,
okay,

1680
01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:29.540
this immediately makes sense.
It is,
it,

1681
01:50:29.570 --> 01:50:31.600
it is perfectly sensible.

1682
01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:36.940
And yet I've never seen anyone teach this way.
Uh,
it's uh,

1683
01:50:36.941 --> 01:50:37.281
it's,

1684
01:50:37.281 --> 01:50:42.100
it's really a gift that you've given and continue to give to the world.

1685
01:50:42.101 --> 01:50:44.650
Sell.
I'll bet.
Crazy thing.

1686
01:50:44.770 --> 01:50:47.710
<v 2>No one,
no one else has still teaching this way.
How to,
you know,</v>

1687
01:50:47.770 --> 01:50:51.730
we've been doing it for 30 years with incredible success and we're still the

1688
01:50:51.731 --> 01:50:56.110
only ones teaching this way.
Why does that,
why is that,
why do you think that is?

1689
01:50:56.290 --> 01:50:59.070
It's just a lot of,
a lot of built in

1690
01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:04.390
resistance to change in the world.
This one,
yes,
there are in many,

1691
01:51:04.450 --> 01:51:06.460
many places and you know,
they,
well,

1692
01:51:06.490 --> 01:51:09.700
they believe what matters is how many laps you do and how strong your pulling

1693
01:51:09.701 --> 01:51:12.670
kick as they persist in believing that.

1694
01:51:12.671 --> 01:51:16.480
And so what is the first thing you learn,
uh,
when,

1695
01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:20.560
when you take care of a beginner's lesson is how to kick and how to pull.

1696
01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:21.430
And that's,

1697
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:25.810
that's really putting the cart before the horse if you're not comfortable in the

1698
01:51:25.811 --> 01:51:26.644
water.

1699
01:51:27.060 --> 01:51:29.970
<v 4>Oh yeah.
I mean that's just do,
that'll just guarantee,</v>

1700
01:51:29.971 --> 01:51:33.930
at least in my case that you need to breathe 10 times.

1701
01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:38.480
You write more urgently.
Right.
Then you did other ones.
Yeah,

1702
01:51:38.830 --> 01:51:42.880
<v 2>we've,
we've,
uh,
you know,
crack the code so to speak and,
and it works.</v>

1703
01:51:42.881 --> 01:51:44.470
It just works every single time.

1704
01:51:45.180 --> 01:51:47.200
<v 4>Uh,
we'll,
we'll Terry,
uh,</v>

1705
01:51:48.660 --> 01:51:49.200
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1706
01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:53.850
<v 4>What,
uh,
I want to,
uh,
I want to make sure that,
uh,</v>

1707
01:51:54.050 --> 01:51:58.530
we,
we wrap up in the next couple of minutes,
but,
uh,

1708
01:51:59.170 --> 01:51:59.830
<v 0>okay.</v>

1709
01:51:59.830 --> 01:52:04.380
<v 4>What would you like to
share with,
uh,
with,</v>

1710
01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:06.620
with people who are listening?
In other words,
you know,

1711
01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:11.340
if there were recommendations you have,

1712
01:52:11.490 --> 01:52:12.060
uh,

1713
01:52:12.060 --> 01:52:16.590
certainly checking out total immersion is a no brainer as far as I'm concerned.

1714
01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:19.130
Uh,
and we can get to,
uh,

1715
01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:22.260
where they can find more on that and so on in a second.

1716
01:52:22.261 --> 01:52:24.120
But is there anything else you'd like to convey?

1717
01:52:24.121 --> 01:52:27.090
Anything you would encourage people to,

1718
01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:31.860
to ask themselves or suggest that they do?
Uh,
since we have,

1719
01:52:31.970 --> 01:52:36.300
uh,
quite a few people listening,
I'm sure at this point we haven't,

1720
01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:41.310
we haven't gotten too much into the how to make,
maybe I can,
I can share a few,

1721
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:46.010
a few how to suggestions that people can try.
Yeah,
let's do it.

1722
01:52:46.170 --> 01:52:48.620
<v 3>And,
and some principals.
Um,</v>

1723
01:52:48.710 --> 01:52:53.710
I always like to go back to first principles for as the basis for anything that

1724
01:52:54.801 --> 01:52:59.770
matters.
Anything we care about doing well.
Uh,
and so I'll,

1725
01:52:59.771 --> 01:53:04.771
I'll share five first principles of intelligent improvement oriented swimming.

1726
01:53:07.470 --> 01:53:08.300
Um,

1727
01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:13.300
first is to recognize that as a human swimmer you are in energy wasting machine.

1728
01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:17.960
Uh,
the Darpa,
uh,

1729
01:53:18.070 --> 01:53:21.600
the defense advanced research projects agency,
uh,

1730
01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:26.250
in designing a a swim foil for the Navy Seals back in 2005,

1731
01:53:26.610 --> 01:53:27.450
they did a,

1732
01:53:27.990 --> 01:53:32.940
they did an efficiency estimation for a group of lap swimmers.
These,

1733
01:53:32.941 --> 01:53:35.670
these were not,
uh,
tutored or coach swimmers,

1734
01:53:35.671 --> 01:53:38.580
but that people think they're pretty okay,

1735
01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:42.840
that they swim laps a lot and they found they were only 3% efficient.

1736
01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:47.580
97% of their energy was going into something other than locomotion.

1737
01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:53.370
So,
so as a human swimmer,
you are naturally an energy wasting machine.

1738
01:53:53.371 --> 01:53:55.380
And in everything you do,

1739
01:53:55.740 --> 01:54:00.740
focus on saving energy before you focus on increasing fitness at goes back to

1740
01:54:02.341 --> 01:54:03.480
what bill boomer said,

1741
01:54:03.481 --> 01:54:08.400
conditioning something that happens while you build refiner and print skills.

1742
01:54:09.150 --> 01:54:13.380
So that's principle number one.
Principle number two,

1743
01:54:13.410 --> 01:54:15.810
most of what we know about swimming is wrong.

1744
01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:19.350
All our primal instincts about swimming leaders,

1745
01:54:19.351 --> 01:54:23.970
the straight and most of what we hear,
uh,
are,
are,
are not helpful.

1746
01:54:23.971 --> 01:54:27.880
So you have really have to exercise critical thinking.
If someone,
uh,

1747
01:54:28.010 --> 01:54:31.890
suggest you try something and it doesn't seem to work well,
maybe,

1748
01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:34.350
maybe it wasn't a good idea.
Uh,

1749
01:54:34.351 --> 01:54:38.490
if they suggest you try some smokes something or Tim [inaudible] to go to the

1750
01:54:38.491 --> 01:54:42.660
pool with them in a four foot shallow area,
uh,
and,

1751
01:54:42.661 --> 01:54:46.090
and you experience something,
uh,
thereby,
uh,

1752
01:54:46.230 --> 01:54:50.700
that works then than trust in your trust,
in your own intuition about things.

1753
01:54:50.701 --> 01:54:55.200
And don't feel that you have to believe what you hear from authoritative
sources.

1754
01:54:55.830 --> 01:54:57.480
Uh,
principle number three,

1755
01:54:57.481 --> 01:55:02.060
it's obvious that efficiency is not natural for humans.
Inefficiencies is,

1756
01:55:02.061 --> 01:55:04.710
is natural,
but is entirely learnable,

1757
01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:09.800
as as Tim discovered in a period of eight weeks where he went from swimming 20

1758
01:55:09.931 --> 01:55:14.250
yards in a,
in a pool and being exhausted to swimming a mile in the end,

1759
01:55:14.251 --> 01:55:16.410
the ocean,
it's learnable.
Anyone,

1760
01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:21.470
anyone can learn to swim with great efficiency and then improve on it

1761
01:55:21.781 --> 01:55:25.980
continuously by applying the principles of mastery,
uh,

1762
01:55:25.981 --> 01:55:30.600
including love,
the plateau.
A principle number four,

1763
01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:35.250
if you want to swim with more ease or more efficiency,

1764
01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:40.560
think about what you can do to make your vessels sleeker.
Uh,

1765
01:55:40.570 --> 01:55:43.110
and I'll,
when I finished with the five principles,

1766
01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:48.260
just mention a three or four simple action items that for the next time you go

1767
01:55:49.591 --> 01:55:52.620
to the pool,
but,
but strive for a sleeker vessel,
it's,

1768
01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:57.640
it's a universally unquestioned truth among naval architects and scientists who

1769
01:55:58.141 --> 01:56:02.850
study fish.
So why should it be different for your body?
Um,

1770
01:56:03.690 --> 01:56:06.480
and then finally,
strive,

1771
01:56:06.630 --> 01:56:11.160
strive to swim in a way that you,
you use your body as a whole.

1772
01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:16.520
Resist any suggestions someone tells you to just pull or Kik or separate the

1773
01:56:17.881 --> 01:56:22.881
Poland Keck and you're training a strive for a seamlessly integrated movement

1774
01:56:23.731 --> 01:56:26.760
that is based in,
in the core.

1775
01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:31.710
So those are five first principle principles worth,
uh,

1776
01:56:31.711 --> 01:56:34.230
worth listening to again and writing down I think.

1777
01:56:34.270 --> 01:56:38.330
<v 1>Okay.
And on number five,
just before we get to the action items,</v>

1778
01:56:38.331 --> 01:56:40.700
just to give an example of that integration,

1779
01:56:40.730 --> 01:56:45.730
that was one of these Aha moments that we've been talking about for me at least,

1780
01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:49.090
was the idea that,
uh,

1781
01:56:50.540 --> 01:56:54.890
that you not use your legs for propulsion.

1782
01:56:54.891 --> 01:56:58.460
So if you don't think about your legs and swimming as a propeller,

1783
01:56:59.180 --> 01:57:04.180
but instead use a very small flick of each leg to turn the hips and therefore

1784
01:57:06.021 --> 01:57:10.160
turn the shoulders so that you're going from that fuselage right to fuselage,

1785
01:57:10.161 --> 01:57:14.810
left and back and forth.
It changes the entire nature of swimming.
Right?

1786
01:57:14.811 --> 01:57:16.580
So,
um,
that was,
uh,

1787
01:57:16.670 --> 01:57:21.050
that was just one example of integration that I found hugely helpful.

1788
01:57:22.390 --> 01:57:25.420
<v 3>Tell flake illustrates three other principles that I just mentioned.</v>

1789
01:57:25.421 --> 01:57:29.210
Human swimmers or energy wasting machine.
So what are you focusing on with,

1790
01:57:29.240 --> 01:57:33.440
with a tough lake instead of leg churn,
saving energy.
Uh,

1791
01:57:33.550 --> 01:57:36.850
and um,
principle number two,

1792
01:57:36.851 --> 01:57:38.920
most of what we know about swimming is wrong.

1793
01:57:39.100 --> 01:57:42.080
What did you know about swimming before you learn?
Tai,

1794
01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:44.950
what did you know about the kick?
No,

1795
01:57:44.970 --> 01:57:49.840
and folks had to use it as a propeller to push me forward.
All right.
And,

1796
01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:52.730
and principle number five,
uh,
as,
as you saw,

1797
01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:55.030
principle number four is strive for a sleek or vessel.

1798
01:57:55.600 --> 01:58:00.160
So rather than focusing on on propulsion and a bigger,
bigger,
stronger Kik,

1799
01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:03.520
you lose.
It was the smaller,
lighter kick.
It really worked.

1800
01:58:05.210 --> 01:58:09.700
So for the five principles were illustrated by that.
That one thing.

1801
01:58:09.820 --> 01:58:13.960
And you know,
the same thing with your hand swapping.
Uh,
you know,

1802
01:58:13.961 --> 01:58:15.820
you were what you were accomplishing.

1803
01:58:15.821 --> 01:58:19.630
There was a poll that was a little more patient,

1804
01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:22.120
a little slower probably,
but,

1805
01:58:22.150 --> 01:58:26.290
but by you or using your arms to reduce drag.
Yup,

1806
01:58:26.890 --> 01:58:28.840
definitely.
And it also,

1807
01:58:28.841 --> 01:58:33.841
it also helps pull together the pieces in terms of integrating your stroke.

1808
01:58:33.851 --> 01:58:38.290
Just that timing is one of the things that the stopping the kick,

1809
01:58:38.291 --> 01:58:42.160
which is interrupting your natural rhythm.
But having that

1810
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:46.990
<v 2>timing in your arms naturally promotes an integrated us,</v>

1811
01:58:47.060 --> 01:58:52.000
um,
technique that we're,
all the parts are working together.

1812
01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:58.160
<v 4>So what action items would you have for people who wanted to try something at</v>

1813
01:58:58.351 --> 01:58:59.184
the pool?

1814
01:58:59.370 --> 01:59:00.060
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1815
01:59:00.060 --> 01:59:05.060
so action items and I would suggest that you don't swim long distances while

1816
01:59:06.601 --> 01:59:08.120
trying these.
Um,

1817
01:59:08.490 --> 01:59:13.490
if you can swim anywhere from just about five strokes to a half a lap a and feel

1818
01:59:15.751 --> 01:59:18.180
that you're doing it,
that's,
that's good.
You don't have to,

1819
01:59:18.660 --> 01:59:20.240
you don't have to leave one end with the,

1820
01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:23.520
with an oblong feeling that you're obligated to go to the other end.

1821
01:59:23.850 --> 01:59:28.850
So the very first of these would be hang or align your head.

1822
01:59:30.120 --> 01:59:32.580
Most important,
the fuck,
the most fundamental thing.

1823
01:59:32.581 --> 01:59:37.530
The first thing we always teach is hang or align your head.

1824
01:59:38.070 --> 01:59:40.230
Um,
you could,

1825
01:59:40.260 --> 01:59:45.260
you could visualize perhaps that there's a toll line attached to the top of your

1826
01:59:45.511 --> 01:59:50.511
head pulling your spine directly forward while while you,

1827
01:59:51.080 --> 01:59:54.300
you know,
while you do everything that the stroking part of it,

1828
01:59:54.301 --> 01:59:56.520
that your spine is always moving forward.

1829
01:59:56.970 --> 02:00:01.470
So get your head aligned would be number one.
Number two,

1830
02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:05.400
use your arms to lengthen your body,
not to push water back.

1831
02:00:05.730 --> 02:00:07.950
You're still going to push water back.

1832
02:00:08.130 --> 02:00:11.250
But by using your arms to lengthen your body,

1833
02:00:11.550 --> 02:00:15.720
you're promoting two things,
a lower drag profile,

1834
02:00:16.140 --> 02:00:19.860
um,
and a complete movement.
You're,

1835
02:00:19.861 --> 02:00:21.660
you're focused on completing the movement.

1836
02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:25.170
A lot of people think about finishing the stroke backed by the hip.

1837
02:00:25.410 --> 02:00:30.150
Finish it to the front instead.
Uh,
the third is the what,

1838
02:00:30.180 --> 02:00:32.820
what Tim just mentioned,
um,

1839
02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:36.570
which is you cannot go wrong by kicking less.

1840
02:00:37.260 --> 02:00:41.220
Just always keep that in mind.
You cannot go wrong by kicking list.

1841
02:00:41.221 --> 02:00:46.221
It's a kicking is a great way to burn energy and a great way to create drag.

1842
02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:52.670
It's a very poor way to create propulsion.
So those would be,

1843
02:00:52.710 --> 02:00:54.480
oh,
and one more.
One more.

1844
02:00:54.750 --> 02:00:58.470
Anything you do more quietly is more effective and efficient.

1845
02:00:58.471 --> 02:01:02.130
So whatever you're doing at,
at,
at a given moment and the next lap,

1846
02:01:02.131 --> 02:01:06.600
strive to do it more quietly and it will be better.
So align your head,

1847
02:01:06.780 --> 02:01:09.090
lengthen your body cake last,

1848
02:01:09.210 --> 02:01:11.850
swim more quietly for action items.

1849
02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:13.291
<v 4>Yeah,
the,</v>

1850
02:01:13.291 --> 02:01:17.820
the swimming quietly is one that if I find myself getting,

1851
02:01:18.260 --> 02:01:22.790
uh,
prematurely tired,
which I take as an indication that I'm being inefficient,

1852
02:01:23.390 --> 02:01:26.330
that's usually what I'll focus on.
I'll stop.

1853
02:01:26.430 --> 02:01:31.160
I'll just rest at the side of the pool for whether it is 30 seconds,

1854
02:01:31.161 --> 02:01:32.060
60 seconds,

1855
02:01:32.061 --> 02:01:36.980
and then for the next handful of labs just tried to be as silent as possible.

1856
02:01:36.981 --> 02:01:39.740
So no splashing with the feed,

1857
02:01:39.741 --> 02:01:44.741
with the hands in a really trying to glide the arm in at an angle and to do it

1858
02:01:47.271 --> 02:01:49.520
as silently as possible,
uh,

1859
02:01:49.521 --> 02:01:54.470
is also one of those exercises that just checks so many different boxes it

1860
02:01:54.471 --> 02:01:58.970
seems.
Yeah.
Uh,
well,
uh,

1861
02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:01.490
Terry,
this is a,
this has been great.

1862
02:02:01.491 --> 02:02:06.050
I'm glad that we were able to find the time to do this.
And uh,

1863
02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:11.260
of course people can find total immersion online@totalimmersion.net where they

1864
02:02:11.271 --> 02:02:14.060
can find videos and instruction and everything else.

1865
02:02:14.061 --> 02:02:17.990
Is there anything that you would like people to check out or anything anywhere

1866
02:02:17.991 --> 02:02:19.910
else that people should,
uh,
say hello?

1867
02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:24.520
<v 3>Well,
first of all,
I want to say thank you and I want to say you are a masterful,</v>

1868
02:02:24.521 --> 02:02:29.440
an artful podcast host.
I'm working on it,
work in progress,
but thank you.

1869
02:02:29.441 --> 02:02:32.740
I felt very well guided.
I would like to do a podcast and I hope,

1870
02:02:32.770 --> 02:02:35.260
I hope to be a fraction as good as you are when I,

1871
02:02:35.290 --> 02:02:38.650
when I do it so well.
Yeah,

1872
02:02:38.651 --> 02:02:41.680

1878
02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:08.313
Uh,

1879
02:03:08.650 --> 02:03:13.650
and all they have to do is go to total immersion academy.com,

1880
02:03:14.650 --> 02:03:19.240
forward slash Tim total immersion academy.com,

1881

<v 4>Perfect.
And to everybody listening,
I'll also put that in the show notes,</v>

1883
02:03:29.620 --> 02:03:33.760

1884
02:03:34.210 --> 02:03:39.210
you can find that at tim.blog/podcast and just search Terry's name.

1885
02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:42.250
Uh,
if you just search Terry's since he,

1886
02:03:42.251 --> 02:03:44.980
I believe you are the only Terry I've interviewed so far than a,

1887
02:03:44.981 --> 02:03:49.000
you will pop right up.
And,
uh,
Terry,
it's a,

1888
02:03:49.030 --> 02:03:53.780
it's been such an honor and a privilege,
uh,
to,
to have you on and is,

1889
02:03:53.820 --> 02:03:58.570
as far as your podcasting hosting progress goes,

1890
02:03:58.571 --> 02:04:02.800
I think it's important to,
uh,
if you want a good laugh,

1891
02:04:02.830 --> 02:04:07.830
listen to my first episode that I did as a host.

1892
02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:12.610
Uh,
and you'll realize just how much one can improve

1893
02:04:14.830 --> 02:04:18.920
any scale is improvable.
Boy.
Oh yeah.
So not,

1894
02:04:19.150 --> 02:04:23.710
I think that,
uh,
if you use my first episode as a,
uh,
as a hurdle,

1895
02:04:23.711 --> 02:04:26.260
I think that you'll clear it with flying colors.

1896
02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:29.800
You're already much better than I was then.
Uh,

1897
02:04:29.890 --> 02:04:34.890
so don't be daunted by that and I hope to hear your podcast soon myself.

1898
02:04:35.501 --> 02:04:38.070
But Terry,
thank you so much for taking the time.
I really,

1899
02:04:38.071 --> 02:04:42.330
really appreciate it and thank you so much for inviting me.
It's a pleasure,

1900
02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:43.470
pleasure and a privilege.

1901
02:04:43.471 --> 02:04:48.150
I really looked forward to and to everybody listening,

1902
02:04:48.210 --> 02:04:50.520
try out total immersion,
uh,
honestly,

1903
02:04:50.550 --> 02:04:54.570
whether you're a swimmer or a non swimmer or someone who has never quite been as

1904
02:04:54.571 --> 02:04:59.550
comfortable as you would like.
I,
I am not,
if you've seen photos of me,

1905
02:04:59.630 --> 02:05:01.830
uh,
what you had to think of as built for swimming.

1906
02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:06.860
And I told myself all sorts of handicapping stories and accepted all types of

1907
02:05:07.711 --> 02:05:10.590
partial completeness until my thirties.

1908
02:05:11.100 --> 02:05:15.560
When I used accountability by,
uh,

1909
02:05:15.660 --> 02:05:18.630
having a friend assign me a new year's resolution.

1910
02:05:18.631 --> 02:05:22.410
I knew he would bust my balls forever if I didn't do it,
uh,

1911
02:05:22.650 --> 02:05:25.020
to get me to finally take it seriously.

1912
02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:30.080
And taking it seriously meant I took all sorts of classes and so on and wasted a

1913
02:05:30.541 --> 02:05:33.660
lot of time trying things that were really,
really,

1914
02:05:33.661 --> 02:05:36.030
really hard like kickboards and everything else.

1915
02:05:36.290 --> 02:05:41.290
It doesn't have to be hard and in fact a good instruction should seem very,

1916
02:05:41.911 --> 02:05:44.640
very clear and it should make a lot of sense.

1917
02:05:44.670 --> 02:05:48.180
And that's what I got from total immersion and I can,

1918
02:05:48.181 --> 02:05:52.770
I can go down a long list of my friends who have since learned how to swim.
Uh,

1919
02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:55.680
so definitely check it out.
And Terry,
you mentioned it already,

1920
02:05:55.681 --> 02:05:58.290
but total immersion academy.com forward slash Tim,

1921
02:05:58.291 --> 02:06:03.291
I really hope people give it a test and share their experiences because it's,

1922
02:06:04.230 --> 02:06:09.230
it can really be regulatory and to everyone listening,

1923
02:06:10.170 --> 02:06:14.040
as always,
until next time,
thank you for tuning in.

1924
02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:18.450
Be Safe out there,
question assumptions and never stop learning.

1925
02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:23.770
Okay guys,
that's the end of the first interview.

1926
02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:29.040
And from this point forward you will hear several clips of Terry's daughters,

1927
02:06:30.100 --> 02:06:31.150
Fiona,
Carrie,

1928
02:06:31.151 --> 02:06:36.151
and Betsy interviewing him in the hospital in the days before his passing.

1929
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:38.103
Thanks for listening.

1930
02:06:40.430 --> 02:06:42.650
<v 7>What do you want to make sure that's not written down yet?</v>

1931
02:06:42.890 --> 02:06:47.510
So you're talking about is what makes total immersion distinctive.

1932
02:06:47.770 --> 02:06:50.840
Yeah,
I got that.
Yeah.
Is,

1933
02:06:52.210 --> 02:06:55.400
is teaching balance as the,

1934
02:06:55.760 --> 02:06:58.900
the t skill was farming.

1935
02:06:59.510 --> 02:07:04.010
No one else even recognizes as a skill.
Okay.

1936
02:07:04.370 --> 02:07:09.370
Let alone the keystones skill of swimming efficiently or not just sewing

1937
02:07:11.220 --> 02:07:14.720
efficiently of being able to enjoy swimming,

1938
02:07:16.910 --> 02:07:21.330
being able to swim with ease,
grace and enjoyment.
A lot of these are,

1939
02:07:22.050 --> 02:07:27.050
and we will approach it to demonstrate that the total immersion way is uniquely

1940
02:07:32.270 --> 02:07:37.270
unique and promoting all those ancillary benefits because we do it consciously

1941
02:07:40.030 --> 02:07:44.370
because we're trying to develop the whole person,
not just the swimmer.
Okay.

1942
02:07:46.120 --> 02:07:47.890
We're trying to grow the whole person.

1943
02:07:51.620 --> 02:07:52.380
<v 0>Hello</v>

1944
02:07:52.380 --> 02:07:56.370
<v 7>Brain,
psyche and body done.
Let me ask you a question.</v>

1945
02:07:57.810 --> 02:08:02.810
Is there anything you want to convey to other people about house house swimming?

1946
02:08:03.470 --> 02:08:07.800
You're approach is helping you right now?
Like interval training with this?

1947
02:08:08.340 --> 02:08:10.590
That's a good shot.
Sure.
Everything.

1948
02:08:10.650 --> 02:08:15.650
Everything I've practiced and taught has helped prepare me for this crisis

1949
02:08:16.381 --> 02:08:20.670
moment in my life.
Okay.
Can you give some examples?
Sure.

1950
02:08:23.870 --> 02:08:28.140
Your mindfulness
process orientation.

1951
02:08:29.730 --> 02:08:30.563
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1952
02:08:34.570 --> 02:08:38.410
<v 7>Like the way that you're drinking,
right?
Focus points.
Vocal points.</v>

1953
02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:43.260
Say what your focus points.
We're drinking our mind by mindfulness.

1954
02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:44.471
Casa.
Sorry.

1955
02:08:44.471 --> 02:08:49.471
I'm used to doing things a guided by phone call points and attentive to

1956
02:08:49.901 --> 02:08:53.560
Foucault.
Clients.
Talk about your experience with learning to drink.

1957
02:08:54.140 --> 02:08:55.350
I try to talk about that.

1958
02:08:55.420 --> 02:09:00.420
I have to learn after my stroke I have to learn to drink all over again and I'm

1959
02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:05.770
applying the same prices,
learning,
reteaching myself how to drink.

1960
02:09:06.370 --> 02:09:11.370
That applied to teaching myself how to breathe seamlessly while swimming

1961
02:09:11.801 --> 02:09:15.350
freestyle.
So that's your focus point.
Break it down.
Yeah,

1962
02:09:15.610 --> 02:09:19.450
because this would be really helpful.
So my focal points for drinking our

1963
02:09:22.570 --> 02:09:27.460
sip.
Exhale,
relax,
swallow,

1964
02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:28.473
repeat,

1965
02:09:29.210 --> 02:09:30.043
<v 0>hi.</v>

1966
02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:38.030
<v 7>Then rest interval and rest interval and your treat those like you treat repeats</v>

1967
02:09:39.691 --> 02:09:42.030
when you're swimming in the pool.
She has.

1968
02:09:42.031 --> 02:09:47.031
I do exactly recognizing that what I'm doing is draining my brain because parts

1969
02:09:48.721 --> 02:09:50.790
of my brain had been injured.

1970
02:09:51.390 --> 02:09:56.390
Parts of my brain that controls swallowing properly and not aspirating,

1971
02:09:57.510 --> 02:10:02.510
have been injured and I have to train new neuron just to take over that task.

1972
02:10:05.470 --> 02:10:09.750
And the only way to do it is with a conscious process,

1973
02:10:10.150 --> 02:10:10.650
right.

1974
02:10:10.650 --> 02:10:15.650
Where I connect the motor and cognitive neurons that are associated with that

1975
02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:20.970
tivity yeah.
About the,

1976
02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:25.530
what about the emotional cost that the important points and emotional aspects is

1977
02:10:25.531 --> 02:10:27.940
to be nonjudgmental of this experience.

1978
02:10:27.970 --> 02:10:32.340
Making mistakes is making mistakes is essential to learning.

1979
02:10:33.530 --> 02:10:38.530
So that when I make a mistake that I can recognize the mistake that I can,

1980
02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:42.970
I can,
uh,
analyze the mistake.
I,

1981
02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:47.420
the only way to avoid it in the future is to recognize it,

1982
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:51.110
analyze it,
and,
and,

1983
02:10:52.070 --> 02:10:57.020
and then,
and then come up with a strategy to avoid it.
Right?
Yeah.

1984
02:10:57.620 --> 02:10:59.780
How do I do that by saying,

1985
02:11:00.290 --> 02:11:03.890
recognizing that I have to exhale before swallowing.
Okay.

1986
02:11:04.100 --> 02:11:06.850
But what about the emotional aspect?
Close the epiglottitis

1987
02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:11.610
<v 8>yes.
That's more technical though.
I mean like fear,
anxiety,</v>

1988
02:11:11.611 --> 02:11:16.050
anything like that.
Do you feel like your,
uh,

1989
02:11:16.051 --> 02:11:17.010
your practice

1990
02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:21.920
<v 7>detached almost clinical place you are and doing this?</v>

1991
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:26.900
Because my metaphor,
you're splitting,
right?

1992
02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:29.990
You're sitting English 10 or English Channel.
You're swinging around Manhattan.

1993
02:11:30.070 --> 02:11:34.270
Yeah.
Right.
And you're in rough water and you're struggling right now.

1994
02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:39.280
Recovering from a stroke to recover from a stroke is like training to swim

1995
02:11:40.431 --> 02:11:43.520
around Manhattan.
So when you enter a rough water,

1996
02:11:43.730 --> 02:11:47.050
there's a lot of turbulence around you,
which there isn't it right down slower,

1997
02:11:47.910 --> 02:11:48.743
the ones around you,

1998
02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:52.970
how would you compare that to what's going on in your mind when you're swimming

1999
02:11:52.971 --> 02:11:56.860
in turbulent water versus being in a room with a lot of refer?

2000
02:11:56.920 --> 02:12:01.920
The water is rough for the water or the more turbulent my surroundings,

2001
02:12:02.421 --> 02:12:04.210
the calmer I have to be here.

2002
02:12:04.220 --> 02:12:07.580
You have to think about how this is going to start rolling external turbulence

2003
02:12:07.581 --> 02:12:12.581
and internal comm and there has to be the more external turbulence I camera,

2004
02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:16.340
the more Entercom I must cultivate.
All right.

2005
02:12:16.341 --> 02:12:20.880
Is there anything else you want us to want to talk about as far as,
yeah,

2006
02:12:21.170 --> 02:12:25.360
you want to get that so you still had to,
well,
no,

2007
02:12:25.361 --> 02:12:30.361
I think a very important element in this book is the fact that I'm writing the

2008
02:12:34.131 --> 02:12:37.030
entire book was stage four cancer.
Yes.

2009
02:12:37.370 --> 02:12:42.080
And dealing with things like strokes.
Yeah.
As I'm,

2010
02:12:42.170 --> 02:12:46.970
as I'm writing the book,
Yeah.
That's going to,
that's going to be in the intro.

2011
02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:51.480
Yeah.
We want that to be prominent.
Yeah.
Absolutely.

2012
02:12:51.570 --> 02:12:56.300
Readers and potential readers to know this as they're thinking about how we use

2013
02:12:56.560 --> 02:12:57.620
as they're contemplating,

2014
02:12:58.820 --> 02:13:03.260
because not everybody will have an order read the book and how do you feel like

2015
02:13:03.261 --> 02:13:04.760
people can apply that?

2016
02:13:05.190 --> 02:13:08.360
A lot of the interviews of the bug,

2017
02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:10.810
<v 8>but how do you feel,</v>

2018
02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:14.940
how do you think that knowledge people can apply that to themselves and

2019
02:13:14.941 --> 02:13:18.340
understanding that it's not about ideal circumstances?

2020
02:13:18.390 --> 02:13:21.590
<v 7>It'll add an element of drama.
Yeah.
Right.</v>

2021
02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:28.570
Life drama.
It'll add an element of life's problems and your bracelet.

2022
02:13:29.570 --> 02:13:33.450
Okay.
Hold on.
How am I different person writing this book?

2023
02:13:33.451 --> 02:13:37.920
Then the person that wrote the original book.
Okay.
Big.
A big part of it.

2024
02:13:37.950 --> 02:13:40.560
How are you a different person?
Yes.
Well I'm,

2025
02:13:41.010 --> 02:13:45.960
I'm 65 and 66 I was 45 then.

2026
02:13:46.050 --> 02:13:46.883
Yeah.

2027
02:13:47.670 --> 02:13:51.210
What am I life experiences that I'm bringing to it this time?

2028
02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:58.080
Talk about that.
We'll stage four cancer and this stuff that's come with it.

2029
02:13:59.210 --> 02:13:59.880
Okay.

2030
02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:03.750
<v 8>And Dad,
I think it's also important to know what is going on right now,</v>

2031
02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:08.930
which is very serious and they've told us is,
is it's life threatening,
but you,

2032
02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:09.271
you know,

2033
02:14:09.271 --> 02:14:14.271
you've said and saying this is not the end and you're going to get through this.

2034
02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:19.830
<v 7>I'm going to get through this.
Yeah.
And many more healthy years.</v>

2035
02:14:20.820 --> 02:14:25.340
Good friends.
My,

2036
02:14:25.460 --> 02:14:26.293
my,

2037
02:14:26.990 --> 02:14:31.990
my practice and work and everything I've been teaching has helped prepared me

2038
02:14:33.450 --> 02:14:37.740
for this.
Like almost nothing else that I could have done.

2039
02:14:38.580 --> 02:14:42.950
Yes.
What I'm,
what I'm teaching you in this book.
Okay.
We need it.

2040
02:14:43.980 --> 02:14:47.020
<v 8>Nope.
Can I interject something because we talked about this yesterday.</v>

2041
02:14:48.220 --> 02:14:52.420
You have significant brain swelling.
And we were talking about visualizing,

2042
02:14:52.421 --> 02:14:54.940
you said visualizing a skinny brain,
which was a joke,

2043
02:14:54.941 --> 02:14:59.941
but really the idea of visualize meditating and visualizing on your brain

2044
02:15:00.491 --> 02:15:03.580
swelled decreasing.
Do you want to talk about that?
Have you been doing that?

2045
02:15:04.260 --> 02:15:06.900
<v 7>The physical process by which that happens?</v>

2046
02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:11.880
I needed to understand the physical process by which that happens in order to be

2047
02:15:11.881 --> 02:15:13.140
able to visualize it.

2048
02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:16.920
So did the doctor help me and that helped do this.

2049
02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:20.330
Helen Ellen MCU helped also.
Okay.
Oh yeah.

2050
02:15:20.910 --> 02:15:23.640
Helen's been very,
very helpful here

2051
02:15:25.750 --> 02:15:29.460
in my conversation with the various physicians who come through.

2052
02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:32.430
She came specifically to be the medical translator.

2053
02:15:33.380 --> 02:15:36.850
I'm not sure she did.
Yeah,
she said that

2054
02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:40.730
she's very,
very good at that.

2055
02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:42.550
<v 8>Okay.
Let me just finish this thought.
Okay.</v>

2056
02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:47.600
Can you describe your view of any visualization technique that you have used

2057
02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:48.593
since you've been here?

2058
02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:53.190
<v 7>Sure.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah,
yeah.</v>

2059
02:15:55.890 --> 02:15:59.510
Same,
same blood flow through my brain

2060
02:16:02.990 --> 02:16:06.720
and uh,
keep,

2061
02:16:06.930 --> 02:16:10.460
keep trying to look that way.
Excess

2062
02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:18.880
excess moisture and my brain tissues being drawn into the bloodstream and

2063
02:16:20.331 --> 02:16:22.910
carried out of the brain to be graded.

2064
02:16:24.660 --> 02:16:29.160
<v 8>And how often have you been doing the visualization?
Once a day.
Twice a day.
Oh,</v>

2065
02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:30.040
I'm on and

2066
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:33.790
<v 7>off.
On and off.
Not on a schedule.
Okay.
Yeah.</v>

2067
02:16:33.791 --> 02:16:38.110
Whenever you have a quiet moment.
Yeah.
What about the value of rest?

2068
02:16:39.130 --> 02:16:42.400
What about the value of breast quality over quantity and the value of

2069
02:16:42.401 --> 02:16:44.980
breastfeeding?
Because you emphasize that was swimming too.

2070
02:16:44.981 --> 02:16:48.610
It's about quality a lot of times.
Not Quantified.
I don't know.

2071
02:16:48.611 --> 02:16:50.230
I haven't thought about it.
Okay.

2072
02:16:53.140 --> 02:16:58.140
Well remember when they tell them that the most important element of my recovery

2073
02:16:58.241 --> 02:17:03.170
is rest and sleep.
Yeah.
They,
the doctors here.

2074
02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:08.060
So I see a connecting thread with that and your other,

2075
02:17:08.180 --> 02:17:09.640
yeah.
No,
you're not.

2076
02:17:09.641 --> 02:17:12.860
The injuries that you had during the year that you broke all those records,

2077
02:17:14.360 --> 02:17:18.440
dad.
Yeah.
And remember how you weren't able to train as much.
All right.

2078
02:17:18.710 --> 02:17:22.730
So don't you see that as a similarity?
Yeah,
I actually got a lot more arrest.

2079
02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:27.800
That's a good point.
Could you talk towards the phone cause I,

2080
02:17:27.810 --> 02:17:31.850
it's the microphone's over here,
right.
That was in forest rest that year.

2081
02:17:31.940 --> 02:17:36.940
And for stress actually enabled you to swim better enforced rest.

2082
02:17:37.670 --> 02:17:40.760
Which we've been making sure that you get enough rest and sleep.

2083
02:17:40.940 --> 02:17:45.380
You're doing way better today than you were before.
What do you mean?

2084
02:17:46.070 --> 02:17:46.903
Meaning

2085
02:17:49.430 --> 02:17:54.100
we can see improvements in you from the other day after?
Yes.
What?

2086
02:17:54.140 --> 02:17:58.160
Sorry?
You're more alert and awake for longer periods of time.

2087
02:17:58.430 --> 02:18:02.840
You can speak at length that the first day we could barely wake you up,

2088
02:18:04.010 --> 02:18:08.600
so you needed to rest.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So there's a connection there.
Yeah.

2089
02:18:08.601 --> 02:18:12.800
My body needed to rush the first day for stress too.
It was

2090
02:18:15.130 --> 02:18:18.770
like I had undergone a lot of stress on Tuesday.
Yeah.

2091
02:18:20.060 --> 02:18:24.260
So,
so it was recovering on Wednesday.
Okay.

2092
02:18:24.261 --> 02:18:29.261
So the importance of rest and recovery in some practice from the stress of the

2093
02:18:29.361 --> 02:18:30.420
stroke.
Right.

2094
02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:34.640
Tuesday and recovery.

2095
02:18:35.860 --> 02:18:39.100
Sorry,
sorry,
sorry.

2096
02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:49.480
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

2097
02:18:52.060 --> 02:18:52.480
I'm ready.
