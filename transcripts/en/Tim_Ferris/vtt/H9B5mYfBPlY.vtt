00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.500
Gabor,
welcome to the show.

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 1>Tim is a great pleasure to be here.
Thank you.</v>

3
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.340
<v 0>I have been looking forward to this conversation for a really long time and I</v>

4
00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:10.710
wanted to make an attempt at least to do it right,

5
00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:12.900
so I want it to have the video and the audio and everything else because I think

6
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:17.460
the work you're doing is very important and we're going to cover a lot of

7
00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:18.294
ground,

8
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.350
which I'm very excited to cover because I think it's a real contribution and you

9
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:24.480
have tools and frameworks can really help people.

10
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.260
I thought we might start with books and the reason I thought that could be a fun

11
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:32.580
place to start.
My audience loves books,
Number One,

12
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.010
but number two in tribe of mentors.

13
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.850
Last book that I wrote or that my guest wrote,

14
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.200
you were featured and I thought that many of the books you mentioned paint a

15
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:49.830
picture of your life experience and also your life's work in many ways.

16
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.640
And we can go in any particular order,

17
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:57.150
but I thought maybe it would make sense to start with the scourge of the

18
00:00:57.151 --> 00:00:57.984
swastika.

19
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.480
And that was one that you mentioned had had an impact on you or that perhaps you

20
00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:06.390
recommended on occasion.
Why is that?

21
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.850
<v 1>Well,
so this has to do with my family's history.
I grew up,
was born in Budapest,</v>

22
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:15.060
Hungary in 1944 in January,

23
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:17.580
two months before the Germans occupied the country,

24
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.240
and Hungary at that time was the only country in eastern Europe where the Jewish

25
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:25.080
population had not been annihilated.
And that was our turn.

26
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.940
So it was two months of age.

27
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.890
The day after the German army marched into Budapest,

28
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.510
my mother phoned the pediatrician to say,
would you please come and see God?
Boy,

29
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:39.870
of course he's crying all the time.
And the Peter Just said,

30
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:44.160
of course I will come,
but I should tell you all my Jewish babies of her crying.

31
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.430
And of course that's the infant speaking up on their mother's terror and stress.

32
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.770
And that's how I spent the first year of my life.

33
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.270
We just had a huge impact on my development and my lifelong struggles with

34
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.520
depression and Adhd,
uh,

35
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.340
self shame and,
and other issues.

36
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.440
Jumping ahead now I knew very little about that history and my parents didn't

37
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:11.940
say much about it as I was growing up.

38
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.490
I knew my grandparents had been killed in Auschwitz.

39
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.210
I knew my father had been enforced labor and I never saw him for a year and a

40
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.430
half.
But beyond that,

41
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:25.431
I knew not much about the details until I was about nine or 10 maybe 11 years

42
00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:30.150
old.
And there was a book on my parent's shelf in Budapest with the title,

43
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.560
the scourge of the swastika,

44
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.270
which was where it wasn't by a British civil servant and a member of the House

45
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.060
of Lords.

46
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.320
This man has served at the British army and he was the first book published in

47
00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:45.660
the 50s that detailed the Nazi crimes.

48
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.120
And I climbed up on a chair,
took the,
on the book when I was,
I think 10 or 11,

49
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.800
began to read it.

50
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.510
So photographs of the horrors of the concentration camps and the extermination

51
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.610
details and eastern Europe.

52
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.300
And all of a sudden I swooned cause I got what happened to my family and that

53
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:10.780
question of how can people do such things to other human beings,

54
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.210
which strike me every day.

55
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:18.211
And an almost every this thought occurred to me for years and years and years on

56
00:03:18.301 --> 00:03:20.860
almost every day almost got dizzy with the question.

57
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.490
So why people suffer and my people make other people suffer.

58
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.390
And what is the original?
All that has been a motivating question in our life.

59
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.960
So that's what,
that book was so important to me.
Thank you.

60
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.660
And I have to say that,
you know,

61
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.510
my life's work has been motivated by that question.
As a,

62
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.430
as a medical doctor,
um,
I'm always looking at,
well,

63
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:44.980
what is it that makes people be the way they are?

64
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.370
Why did we come cruel?
Why to become victims.
Um,

65
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.400
why did it become perpetrators?
What drives us?

66
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.700
What kind of insanity covers our basic human nature,

67
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:05.410
which I believe to be good and uh,
and then positive and what happens to us.

68
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.020
<v 2>We're going to spend a lot of time in that territory for sure.
Okay.</v>

69
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.660
So you mentioned sanity or insanity.

70
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.650
I'm not sure if that's a good segue to don Quixote,

71
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:20.420
but I'll let you choose the next one.

72
00:04:20.421 --> 00:04:23.330
So there are a few that came up and you described them brief

73
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.330
in the pages of the book,
but for instance,
the back end that you just gave me,

74
00:04:29.331 --> 00:04:31.850
it was much more in depth.
So we have a few,

75
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.200
and these are going to strike folks as eclectic.
Winnie the Pooh,
the Dhammapada,

76
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.040
the drama of the gifted child and Don Quixote.

77
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.950
Which one of those would you like to explain?

78
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.460
<v 1>School is one of the pool.
Let's go with Winnie the Pooh.
Yeah.</v>

79
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.530
So that was one of the seminal books of my childhood and my parents would have

80
00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:53.380
read to me long before I even knew how to read the hunger.

81
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:57.670
And title is Mitzi much coal.
And uh,
it was translating Moscow,

82
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.320
Mitzi Matsko,
uh,
Mitzi the bear.
And,
uh,

83
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.170
the translator is a great hunger and humorist.
So if anything,

84
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:07.900
the Hungarian book is even funnier than the original English,

85
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.320
which is not something when usually says about translations.

86
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.970
But what struck me about pool of course,
was number one,

87
00:05:15.971 --> 00:05:20.950
that there was this bear of little brains who assault some of so much wiser than

88
00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:22.840
everybody else.
So fundamental,

89
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.150
you found a piece inside despite the fact that his intellect is just under

90
00:05:27.151 --> 00:05:31.180
functioning.
Uh,
number one.
Number two,

91
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.610
there was this relationship with the little boy,
um,
uh,

92
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.670
Christopher Robin,

93
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.700
and there's a passage towards the end of the book where Christopher Robin,

94
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.980
I don't know if you know the real story,
in fact,
there's a movie,

95
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.370
there's a movie about it right now,
but,
but Christopher Robin,

96
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.850
his father AML was a writer and he bought these toys for his son to make stories

97
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:56.104
about them.

98
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.060
And Christopher Robin actually suffered because he was secondary to his father's

99
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:06.240
career.
They did not have a good relationship.
So these characters at the father,

100
00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:10.100
the me made up kind of dominated and squeezed out.

101
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.600
Christopher rob his own life and he himself became a bookseller later on his

102
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:16.430
life and he wrote about his autobiography.

103
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.770
So there's something about the the dysfunctionality and father son relationship.

104
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.770
But in the book,

105
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.930
Christopher is playing with his toys and then he starts to grow up and he has to

106
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:34.130
go to school and he won't be able to play with his toys anymore.

107
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.190
And at the very end of the book,
there's a passage where

108
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.730
the book ends with,
but whatever they go in the enchanted forest,

109
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.400
a little boy has barrier,
will always be playing together.

110
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.530
And that would just bring tears to my eyes for decades upon decades upon decades

111
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.630
until recently I had a,
an experience,

112
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.681
but she,

113
00:06:57.681 --> 00:07:02.681
a psychedelic experience when I realized that does nothing to mourn because I'm

114
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.650
both the bear and the little boy and I was,
we'll be playing that.

115
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:10.820
Nothing is lost.
But when I read that book,
there was a sense of loss.

116
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.310
When I read that passage though,
something's being lost.

117
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.340
Childhood innocence is being lost.
Playfulness is being lost,

118
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.150
which resonated with my own shot because I did lose innocence and then

119
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:25.040
playfulness very early in life.
So both for the fun and the humor.

120
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:27.280
Then of course there's ie or for whatever

121
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.150
<v 3>thing always goes badly.
And as a part of me that's totally,</v>

122
00:07:30.151 --> 00:07:35.090
or I was expecting the worst and nothing will ever work out for me and
nevermind,

123
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.290
leave me alone.
I'm okay with my own suffering.

124
00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:40.350
You know that that's sort of determined victim attitude.

125
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.240
That was also very much Germane to my inner experience.

126
00:07:45.241 --> 00:07:48.240
So that book just spoke to me and made me laugh.
And it still does.

127
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.200
It's one of the funniest books that are written in one of the wisest as well.

128
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.820
<v 0>I need to,
I've only,
I,
I'm ashamed to say this,</v>

129
00:07:56.821 --> 00:08:00.150
but I've only seen the cartoon,
so I,
I know,
I know.

130
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.340
<v 3>Well,
listen,
listen,
one of the sins that,
well,</v>

131
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:06.900
Disney is going to be burning in hell for the rest of existence is what he did

132
00:08:06.901 --> 00:08:11.770
with those.
The stories I was at Disney fight them,
dignified them.
You,
you,

133
00:08:11.771 --> 00:08:14.940
you got to read the original and you,
you would laugh

134
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.180
<v 0>your head off.
Guys,
I'm in,
I'm in.</v>

135
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.820
I wish I spoke Hungarian so I could read the translation.
Uh,

136
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.530
which of these would you like to,
and we can certainly touch on other books,

137
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.000
but so we have three,

138
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.630
three remaining on my list and Dhammapada the drama of the gifted child and

139
00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:30.464
donkey Wooten.

140
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:35.400
<v 1>Well,
let's go to the drama of the gifted child.</v>

141
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:41.040
Said the drama of the gifted child is by a Swiss German Jewish Swiss

142
00:08:41.041 --> 00:08:46.020
psychotherapist named Alice Miller,
who was for three decades a psychoanalyst.

143
00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:51.630
But she realized that the Floridians Psychedelic psychonautic method wasn't

144
00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:55.140
helping anybody get better because it ignored.

145
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.380
So the drama of the gifted child,

146
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.240
the German title of a bitch was prisoners of childhood was really all about the

147
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:07.920
fact that stuff happens to us as children.
Negative things happen.

148
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.900
Then we adapt to those things.

149
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:14.640
By taking on certain defensive ways of being and then we'll leave the rest of

150
00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:16.680
our lives from those defensive modes.

151
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.780
So we're not actually experiencing the present.

152
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.520
We're constantly reliving the past from a perspective that we acquired when we

153
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.230
were helpless and vulnerable children.

154
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:29.130
And when she says the gift to charge him is a sensitive child.

155
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.590
So the more sensitive the child is,

156
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:36.240
the more he or she feels the pain and stress of the environment and the more

157
00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:39.450
effective they are and the more that shapes their lives.

158
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.640
And that book came along for me when I was in my forties and I was a successful

159
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:49.410
doctor and,
and,
and,
and uh,
and I was a father,
but I was depressed.

160
00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:51.690
I was anxious,
I was a driven workaholic.

161
00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:55.950
You wouldn't have known that when you saw me on the job.
But inside me,

162
00:09:55.951 --> 00:09:57.180
I was discouraged.

163
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.170
I had difficulties in my marriage with my children.

164
00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:05.700
I felt they were afraid of me and they were because of my religious.

165
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.130
And that book helped me understand.

166
00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.160
It was the first book to help me understand where all that came from.

167
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.940
So that was for me as for many of the people the Seminole read and really my

168
00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:22.110
whole work since then has been to help liberate people from that prison.

169
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.350
The childhood often imposes on so many of us.

170
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.130
<v 2>This book has come up repeatedly in my life as a recommendation,</v>

171
00:10:30.131 --> 00:10:35.131
as a recommended book from friends who benefited from it are very certainly from

172
00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:42.130
any outward perspective,
highly functioning.
Yeah.
In some cases,

173
00:10:42.131 --> 00:10:46.180
world class performers in their fields and uh,
I'm

174
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:47.960
<v 4>okay</v>

175
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.980
<v 2>in retrospect.</v>

176
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:50.680
<v 4>Okay.</v>

177
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.370
<v 2>Sad that I ignored those recommendations,</v>

178
00:10:54.371 --> 00:10:58.530
but it was in part because I didn't like the pairing of gifted child.

179
00:10:58.531 --> 00:11:01.870
I didn't want to label myself gifted child.

180
00:11:01.871 --> 00:11:04.010
We could certainly say psychoanalyze that,
but I was like,
hmm,

181
00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:08.470
if this is a book written for people who are in,
say,

182
00:11:08.471 --> 00:11:12.760
gifted and talented programs or have some God given talent for whatever reason,

183
00:11:12.761 --> 00:11:14.170
I had a resistance to that,
so I didn't read it.

184
00:11:14.171 --> 00:11:17.580
But the prisoners of childhood makes a lot more sense to me anyway.

185
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.970
<v 1>I think it's a more accurate title,</v>

186
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.000
but there's two things I would say in response.
First of all,

187
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.330
why do you resist you?
I'm giftedness.
You clearly gifted.

188
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:30.740
So why would you not want to find out about that?
Don't know.
Yeah.
So that's,

189
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.280
that's something you might want to consider.
Sure.
A number one.
Number two,

190
00:11:34.281 --> 00:11:36.140
really what she means is the sensitive child.

191
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:41.570
<v 2>Yeah.
So sensitive that would draw me in because I've had,</v>

192
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.540
we don't have to necessarily go down this rabbit hole right now,

193
00:11:44.541 --> 00:11:47.300
but I've had a number of my friends recently asked me,
when did,
you know,

194
00:11:47.301 --> 00:11:50.720
you were so sensitive and not sensitive in a,

195
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.050
in a hyper reactive way,
not in a negative way,
just in a perceptive way.

196
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.640
And I'd never thought of myself,

197
00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.240
it would never have occurred to me to label myself sensitive.
And it just,

198
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:03.370
in the last year I've been thinking about that.
So this,

199
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:08.860
the sensitive child would make,
make more,
uh,

200
00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.220
more sensor would be more appealing.

201
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.340
<v 1>Well,
you have to think of sensitive in terms of his word,</v>

202
00:12:13.341 --> 00:12:16.130
origin of the word sensitive.
Kim's from the Latin word,

203
00:12:16.131 --> 00:12:19.850
sincere to feel so sensitive person feels more.
Yeah.

204
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:23.420
So the example I often give is,

205
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.820
and that can lead to both very positive and very difficult.
Uh,
um,
consequences.

206
00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:32.150
For example,
if I tapped you on the shoulder right now,

207
00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.830
you wouldn't feel any pain at all.

208
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:39.490
But if you're not wearing your shirt and your skin was exposed for the Murphy at

209
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.980
a burn on your shoulders,
so your nerve endings are close to the surface.

210
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.980
If I tagged you with the same force,
you'd feel extreme,

211
00:12:45.981 --> 00:12:50.660
excruciating pain even though the external event was no different.
Right?

212
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.480
So sensitivity magnifies the pain that we have.

213
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.360
Sensitivity also leads to more creativity.

214
00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:00.830
So very often the most creative people also have the most pain,
which is my,

215
00:13:00.831 --> 00:13:04.370
so many creative people escape from their pain through all kinds of
dysfunctions,

216
00:13:04.371 --> 00:13:05.480
like addictions and so on.

217
00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:09.850
So there's a real link between creativity and sensitivity and creativity and,

218
00:13:09.851 --> 00:13:12.260
and,
and sensitivity and suffering at the same time.

219
00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:14.690
That's the first point I would make.

220
00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.380
Now the other thing goes back to what you said about these people that you know,

221
00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:21.230
who are high performers.
Look at that word,
performers.

222
00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:26.540
What does it mean to perform?
One meaning of it is to put on a show.
Sure.

223
00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.433
That's for meaning.

224
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:32.500
And I would have been one of those people who was a high performer.
Uh,

225
00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:37.070
in other words,
look,
that's from the outside successful,
funny doctor,

226
00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.610
direct of a palliative care unit at a major hospital,

227
00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:44.390
national columnist for Canadian newspaper,
writing medical columns,

228
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:47.480
performing at a high level and inside.

229
00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.480
<v 4>Okay.</v>

230
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.690
<v 1>Again,
anxious,
frustrated,
depressed,
discouraged,</v>

231
00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.650
and in my personal life,
a lot of suffering.

232
00:13:57.651 --> 00:14:00.470
So a lot of people who perform well,

233
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:02.130
<v 4>okay</v>

234
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.770
<v 1>are actually deeply troubled inside.</v>

235
00:14:04.771 --> 00:14:07.020
And of course there's many famous examples of that.

236
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:12.530
Some of the greatest performers like Presley or Marilyn Monroe and any number of

237
00:14:12.901 --> 00:14:16.110
people like the name,
that's what they were,
they were performers.

238
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.990
And even from themselves,
they hid their own suffering.

239
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:20.201
<v 2>Well,</v>

240
00:14:20.201 --> 00:14:25.201
we're sitting in a venue right now recording this that is now known as LCR.

241
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:32.470
And there was a mural of prince outside because he performed his,

242
00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:33.310
as I understand it,

243
00:14:33.311 --> 00:14:37.930
last performance in this venue or really before he passed away and before you

244
00:14:37.931 --> 00:14:40.360
overdosed,
before you overdosed.
Yeah,
exactly.

245
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.840
And we can certainly come back to this.

246
00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.090
But part of the reason I wanted to,

247
00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:51.620
big piece of the reason I want it to have you on the show was that I spent,

248
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.400
I'm in a much better place now for many reasons that may be outside of this

249
00:14:55.401 --> 00:14:57.350
interview,
but uh,

250
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.740
feeling the exact same way you just described.
Yeah.

251
00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.600
Outwardly successful in Ridley tortured.
Yeah.
And

252
00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.090
how do you answer the question?

253
00:15:10.091 --> 00:15:14.290
If someone meets you and you just have a short interaction,
what do you do?

254
00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.800
What do I,
if someone asks you,
yeah,
what do you do?
Okay.

255
00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:21.330
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

256
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.340
<v 6>I may maybe self serving,
but somebody once called me a people whisperer.</v>

257
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:26.383
<v 2>People whisper.</v>

258
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:27.690
<v 6>Aye.
Aye.
Aye.</v>

259
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:28.850
<v 5>Okay.</v>

260
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:32.630
<v 6>Do you have a gift for seeing inside?
Cause I've studied,</v>

261
00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:36.770
I'm also sensitive and in some ways,
and I've also studied myself very deeply.

262
00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:39.320
I've had to,
because my real life just wasn't working.

263
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:44.450
And as a medical doctor I've worked with,
all men are of conditioners,

264
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.320
terminal diseases,
newborns,
families,

265
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.330
physical illnesses,
mental dysfunction.

266
00:15:50.331 --> 00:15:52.550
As I spent 12 years working with addictions,

267
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:56.210
I spent on exploring my own and other people's Adhd.

268
00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.660
And so I

269
00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:05.970
work with people to bring a to the truth of their experience so that they're no

270
00:16:05.971 --> 00:16:07.560
longer prisoners of their childhood,

271
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:11.070
but that they can make a conscious choice about how to live in the present

272
00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:15.270
moment,
not based on how they were probably in chartered.
And,

273
00:16:15.271 --> 00:16:19.950
but for that you have to do it in a way that the dog we're spirit do in a very

274
00:16:19.951 --> 00:16:23.790
compassionate way.
Otherwise people just shut down and,
and,
and they,

275
00:16:23.791 --> 00:16:27.480
they shrivel up and they protect themselves.
So that's what I do.

276
00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.870
And I know I also write and I speak publicly and so on,

277
00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:34.950
but the intent is always to bring insight and liberation to people.

278
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.020
<v 2>So I'm going to come back to the medicine makes,</v>

279
00:16:40.021 --> 00:16:43.620
I'd love to know when your journey into medicine began,

280
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:49.040
but first,
since I know my listeners will say,
but you forgot the other two books,

281
00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:50.190
what about the other two books,

282
00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:54.840
the Dhammapada Don Quixote in any order you like?

283
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:58.710
<v 6>Well,
let's go in the order that I discovered them,
which is don Quixote,</v>

284
00:16:58.711 --> 00:17:02.670
which again,
I read that as a child and then reread many times as an adult.

285
00:17:02.671 --> 00:17:06.460
And he's my favorite character.
So Quixote is this,
um,

286
00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.200
diluted Spanish,

287
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:15.590
small noble man who wants to revive the age of chivalry and chivalry knighthood.

288
00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:20.980
So he guessed is broken down a horse called Rosie Dante,

289
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.810
and he is lance and his sword and is he gets this,
uh,

290
00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:31.260
squire called Sachio Panza on his donkey and off they go off to these adventures

291
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:36.120
and he does not see reality.
He thinks windmills are giants and he attacks them.

292
00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:40.320
And of course he gets hurt and he keeps getting hurt cause cause he doesn't see

293
00:17:40.321 --> 00:17:41.220
reality.
He,

294
00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:46.370
but his heart is purely committed to liberating people to truth,

295
00:17:46.911 --> 00:17:49.980
to justice,
to,
uh,
to,
uh,

296
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.460
<v 1>fighting a oppressors,
to liberating the oppressed.</v>

297
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:59.030
So here's this guy who really wants to do good in the world and he's just

298
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.690
diluted in his vision,

299
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.520
but he's far too her and deeper and more human than all the people that scoff at

300
00:18:05.521 --> 00:18:09.180
him and laugh at him.
So what a great character.

301
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:13.260
And the book is both poignant and very funny,
and,
uh,

302
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.220
it's,
he's one of the great creations of world literature.

303
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:22.620
And of course,
again,
you know,
that yearning for justice,
uh,

304
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.160
has always burned in my heart,
uh,
willing to what happened to me.

305
00:18:26.161 --> 00:18:29.880
And what I witnessed
in the double Pata,

306
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.990
the demo plot is the Buddhist collection of sayings.
And it begins with a,

307
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.990
basically the idea that we create the world with our minds.
He says,

308
00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:44.590
everything is thought in the lead.
So how we see the world,
uh,

309
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.160
it's Ho is,
determines the world that we live in.

310
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:52.650
So if I see the world as a horrible place coding the current president of the

311
00:18:52.651 --> 00:18:53.484
United States,

312
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.760
then I will be defensive and grandizing and selfish cause I want to take before

313
00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:02.850
they take from me,
I want to attack before I got attacked.

314
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.210
I'll always will be to look at it for myself because the role is not to be

315
00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:07.044
trusted.

316
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:11.310
So if that's the word you live in and that's the way you're going to create,
um,

317
00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:15.600
and the Buddha was great psychologist and be to recognize that our perception

318
00:19:15.601 --> 00:19:18.900
shaped the world that we live in.
Now what he didn't say,

319
00:19:18.901 --> 00:19:22.920
and that's where modern psychology comes in,
is that before with our mind,

320
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:27.490
we create the world.
The world creates our minds.
So that the,
the,
the,

321
00:19:27.491 --> 00:19:31.200
the kind of world that we live in is very much shaped by early experiences.

322
00:19:31.201 --> 00:19:34.620
What I didn't say that,
but interestingly enough,

323
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:39.090
when you think of what his search for truth,
um,
what happened to him,

324
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.660
if you read his biography,
his mother died before he was a week old.

325
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.450
So He's lost his most important relationship.

326
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:50.160
So his life began with suffering and then he spent all his life trying to

327
00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:56.040
find the nature of suffering and how to transcend suffering and how to get

328
00:19:56.041 --> 00:19:59.660
beyond it.
And this is how he,
um,
uh,

329
00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:03.510
ended up with this particular method of meditation and Contemplation and truth

330
00:20:03.511 --> 00:20:06.280
seeking.
So that book was written 20,

331
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:10.200
2,500 years ago and psychologically we're still catching,

332
00:20:10.201 --> 00:20:11.610
trying to catch up to the wisdom in it.

333
00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:19.320
<v 2>So let's talk about wisdom or perhaps science first.</v>

334
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.530
And maybe they're related in some fashion,
although I know we'll,
we'll,

335
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.830
we'll dig into certainly some things that might be missing.

336
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:31.020
When did medicine into your life or an interest in medicine interest in being a

337
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:32.430
doctor?
Either of those things?

338
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.870
<v 1>Well,
I've speculated on that and um,</v>

339
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.490
there's a number of sources,

340
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.830
strangely enough or necessarily engine of my grandfather who was killed in

341
00:20:43.831 --> 00:20:46.740
Auschwitz in his 50s happened to be a,

342
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.580
and a doctor Grantson ends up as a writer and a doctor.

343
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:56.940
So I think part of it was me trying to fill the hole in my mother's life.
Hmm.

344
00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.760
That was a devastating blow to her.
This is not conscious,
but I'm speculating,

345
00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:04.150
looking back,
it's not that she ever said you have to become a doctor.

346
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.210
It's not that she ever said you have to follow in your grandfather's footsteps.

347
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.810
But I think that consciously I stepped into that role,
number one.

348
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.450
Number two.
Um,

349
00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:18.790
and other reason is that is a June is two in Europe you had every reason to feel

350
00:21:18.791 --> 00:21:23.791
insecure and my mother never failed to tell me that as a doctor you carry your

351
00:21:23.831 --> 00:21:27.130
profession and your hands.
So you don't have to have a business,

352
00:21:27.131 --> 00:21:30.160
you don't have to have riches,
you just have to have the knowledge.

353
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:32.350
And then you can go anywhere in the world and you'll be okay.

354
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.280
Beyond that healing and,
and,
and,
and,

355
00:21:37.281 --> 00:21:42.281
and making this world a better place and have people help people lead healthy

356
00:21:43.121 --> 00:21:47.530
lives was just an ideal of mine.
Then it was like with testicle reasons.

357
00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.220
Uh,
let's face it,
doctors get respect.

358
00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.740
They ever vole they have a good income.

359
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.300
People look up to them and they have a sense of authority that I think I lacked

360
00:21:58.301 --> 00:21:59.134
in my own life.

361
00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:04.520
So it was a combination of unconscious reasons and,

362
00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:08.860
and,
and,
and idealistic reasons and they go just tickle reasons.

363
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.390
Uh,
but,

364
00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.380
but all I know is that all my life I had wanted to be nothing else but a doctor.

365
00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:17.170
I always grew up knowing I'd be a physician.

366
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.720
<v 2>And when you were studying medicine,</v>

367
00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:24.760
what did you think your specialty or specialties might be?

368
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:29.610
<v 1>Well,
first of all,
I should say,
I didn't end up following the dream because,
uh,
I,</v>

369
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:34.440
in my late teens I just couldn't concentrate and study hard enough to get

370
00:22:34.441 --> 00:22:35.880
through the sciences.
I could get through them,

371
00:22:35.881 --> 00:22:38.280
but I couldn't get the high marks needed to get the medical school.

372
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:39.990
So actually taught high school for three years.

373
00:22:39.991 --> 00:22:44.340
I taught English and history for three years and then I would wake up and,
and,

374
00:22:44.341 --> 00:22:47.550
and these voice in me,
you got to be a doctor,
but I'd be a doctor.

375
00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:52.350
And so then I went back to medical school.
And a lot of hard work,
um,

376
00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:57.540
are having been an older student in medical school and being interested in

377
00:22:57.541 --> 00:23:00.570
history and literature and the larger picture,

378
00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.600
I always wanted to put medicine in the context of history,

379
00:23:03.601 --> 00:23:07.200
in the context of society,
in the context of human experience,

380
00:23:07.201 --> 00:23:09.060
not just as an isolated science,

381
00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.210
what does as part of the broader human experience.

382
00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:17.860
And I was interested right away from the,
in the beginning between the,

383
00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.600
in the connections between emotions and illness,

384
00:23:21.601 --> 00:23:24.850
between social factors and health and so on.

385
00:23:24.851 --> 00:23:28.980
And so I was always a larger picture of person.
Uh,

386
00:23:28.981 --> 00:23:32.190
and so that is,
that was with me already in medical school.

387
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:37.190
<v 2>So the integration of mind and body as opposed to the sort of Cartesian duality</v>

388
00:23:37.191 --> 00:23:38.690
and separation of my new buddy.

389
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:42.740
<v 1>Exactly.
Not that anything in medical school prepared me for that.
I mean,</v>

390
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:45.950
in medical school you just don't get that at all.

391
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.880
But that was always my interest.
And then when I started practicing,

392
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:54.990
if your eyes are at all open,
you just can't,
you can't help but to see it,
the,

393
00:23:54.991 --> 00:23:55.301
the,

394
00:23:55.301 --> 00:23:59.040
the who gets sick and who doesn't isn't accidental and who gets cancer because

395
00:23:59.080 --> 00:23:59.750
it doesn't,

396
00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:03.290
isn't accidental then who gets addicted and who doesn't isn't accidental.

397
00:24:03.291 --> 00:24:06.860
And then there was this reasons and those reasons school beyond the individual

398
00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.700
and it has to do with their emotional lives and our relationships and the

399
00:24:10.701 --> 00:24:14.840
society and the culture that they live in.
So more and more over the decades,

400
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.880
my own personal struggles and my medical experience showed me that these

401
00:24:19.881 --> 00:24:21.110
connections are important.

402
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:26.570
<v 0>How did you end up in Palliative care?
And,</v>

403
00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.660
uh,
I suppose for those people listen to,
you don't know what palliative care is.

404
00:24:29.661 --> 00:24:33.740
Perhaps you could give just a brief explanation of what that is.

405
00:24:33.741 --> 00:24:37.680
Some people might think of it as hospice care,
uh,
which is,
which I'm not sure,

406
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:41.510
I don't think are necessarily identical,
but well,
how did you end up,

407
00:24:41.511 --> 00:24:44.510
what was the road to palliative care and what is palliative care?

408
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:50.110
<v 1>So I was a family physician and a very driven one.</v>

409
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:51.680
And I'm also have the,

410
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.490
which means that you want to move around and have this and experiences,
you know,

411
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:57.230
cause you get tired of the same thing.

412
00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:02.180
And it was really in retrospect,

413
00:25:02.181 --> 00:25:04.130
I might say that there's some guidance in all this,

414
00:25:04.131 --> 00:25:06.620
but how it occurred was a series of accidents.

415
00:25:06.621 --> 00:25:11.480
So I've happened to be walking down the hall of Vancouver's Major Hospital when

416
00:25:11.481 --> 00:25:14.660
the current director of Palliative Care said,
I'm quitting.

417
00:25:14.661 --> 00:25:18.080
I would you like to come and work in Palliative care?
And I said,
sure.
You know,

418
00:25:18.081 --> 00:25:20.870
I didn't think it took me a not a moment to think about it.

419
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:24.890
He was just looking for someone to grab,
got palliative care.
Sure.
Thank you.

420
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:29.690
What is that?
And a deeply meaningful work,

421
00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.080
uh,
because when people are facing death,

422
00:25:33.081 --> 00:25:37.850
they also come up against the truth of their lives.
And,
and,
and,
uh,

423
00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.960
uh,
if you can face death,
you can face life

424
00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:42.990
<v 0>in palliative care,</v>

425
00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:46.230
meaning you're helping people to transition with terminal illness.

426
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.370
<v 1>These are people for whom nothing curative or,
or,
or,</v>

427
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.210
or healing is going to happen in the sense of physical healing.

428
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:56.430
So they need to be helped with their symptoms,

429
00:25:56.431 --> 00:25:59.580
with their pain or the ability or weakness or nausea.

430
00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:02.110
But also you have to have to help them go through the,

431
00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:07.440
the psychological process of adjusting to a very short future.

432
00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:13.680
And,
uh,
the people that get daunted,
palliative care work,
the nurses,

433
00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:18.210
um,
and then then the doctors tend to be a special breed.

434
00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.330
It's not because many doctors are not comfortable with death.

435
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:26.130
They're not comfortable with not being able to do something to save somebody.

436
00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:30.030
So you have to develop a lot of patients and a lot of acceptance.

437
00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:34.140
You have to let go of your power to change things.

438
00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.580
So it's deeply meaningful and deeply transformative work.
And,
uh,

439
00:26:38.581 --> 00:26:43.200
you also have to work with a lot of people with multiple different attitudes,

440
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:46.140
life and there's religious,
non religious,

441
00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:51.290
spiritual nonspiritual in denial and acceptance.

442
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:56.550
And all the stages in between.
So it was beautiful,
beautiful work.
And I,
I,

443
00:26:56.590 --> 00:27:01.050
one of my highlights of my medical career all the same time I was still doing my

444
00:27:01.051 --> 00:27:01.920
family practice.

445
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:03.890
<v 0>And when did,
uh,</v>

446
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.480
when did it focus on addiction or an uh,

447
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:13.550
an acute interest in addiction start to steer your medical practice?

448
00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:18.600
<v 1>So as a family physician I've always had substance addicts in my practice.</v>

449
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:22.860
It's just a few.
And uh,

450
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.870
again it was an accident I got fired from I palliative care job.

451
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:34.050
My,
my argument is that I was fired for gross competence

452
00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:39.420
or just too damn good at it but also for gross arrogance.

453
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:44.710
And in other words with my spontaneous and insightful and rather radical non

454
00:27:46.361 --> 00:27:51.270
traditional style,
I could have great results and often did in palliative care.

455
00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:56.580
<v 0>If I may interrupt for one second would be or might be an example of your</v>

456
00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.830
approach that others thought was radical or something you would say or something

457
00:27:59.831 --> 00:28:02.920
you would do with a patient.
That's that that got great results.

458
00:28:02.921 --> 00:28:05.980
But that would seem very radical to others.

459
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.600
<v 1>Well I would engage them in deep conversations.
Stuff would come up with,</v>

460
00:28:09.601 --> 00:28:11.520
it'll be painful,
but it'd be transformative.

461
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:18.170
Physically I would just use the methods that have not been proven but occurred

462
00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:19.501
right to me.

463
00:28:19.501 --> 00:28:23.130
And they've seemed to be helpful and helping people out of pain or dealing with

464
00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.400
they shoes and so on.
Um,
uh,

465
00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.540
I was very open and multiple approaches.
I wasn't just falling,

466
00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:35.040
falling things by the book.
So that was my competence.

467
00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:39.540
The arrogance was that I had a very busy life.

468
00:28:39.541 --> 00:28:43.210
I was still delivering babies,
running my felony practice.
So I would,

469
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:44.760
I would get into palliative care.

470
00:28:44.761 --> 00:28:46.460
And then then the nurses said to working with me,

471
00:28:46.461 --> 00:28:51.000
it was like working in the eye of the tornado and other physicians who didn't

472
00:28:51.001 --> 00:28:56.001
have my attitude or my particular mindset would legitimately question what I was

473
00:28:56.551 --> 00:28:57.384
doing.

474
00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:02.010
But I would regard all such questioning as an attack rather than as an inquiry.

475
00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.610
And I would react like a bulldog was being threatened.

476
00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:09.960
And that's the arrogance.
And that's what ended up leading me to be fired.

477
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:13.950
And it was a great firing because there's always,
I learned a lot about myself.

478
00:29:13.951 --> 00:29:18.180
It took me a while,
but it took,
and then three weeks after I was fired,

479
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:22.470
I got this phone call from,
from our clinic and Vancouver's downtown east side.

480
00:29:22.471 --> 00:29:27.030
Now the downtown eastside of Vancouver is North America's most concentrated area

481
00:29:27.031 --> 00:29:27.601
of drug use.

482
00:29:27.601 --> 00:29:31.830
We have more injection uses in this few swell book radius than anywhere in North

483
00:29:31.831 --> 00:29:35.730
America.
So I get this call saying,
how would you like to come and work down here?

484
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:39.810
And this is three weeks after five foot of care.
Had I not been fired,

485
00:29:39.811 --> 00:29:41.040
I couldn't have taken that other job,

486
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:43.600
which then led me to the high point for my career,

487
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:47.320
which is working 12 years with addicted population and eventually leaving family

488
00:29:47.321 --> 00:29:51.340
practice and doing that full time.
So who,
or orchestrated all this,

489
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.480
I have no idea,
but it was a beautiful progression.

490
00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:02.090
<v 0>Something that's come up quite a bit in interviews on this podcast is some</v>

491
00:30:02.091 --> 00:30:05.570
variation of sometimes you need life to save you from what you want to give you

492
00:30:05.571 --> 00:30:10.250
what you need.
Exactly.
And uh,
I think about that a lot.
At the very least,
it's a,

493
00:30:10.251 --> 00:30:14.120
it's a pain relieving Lens through which to view events that unfold.

494
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:15.643
How,

495
00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:16.850
<v 7>yeah,</v>

496
00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:21.530
<v 0>how do you define addiction?
Or maybe a better question is what is addiction?</v>

497
00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.340
And,
and along with that,
if you want to tackle it,

498
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:30.370
you know what her pour definitions of addiction or misconceptions.

499
00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:31.893
<v 1>Fair enough.</v>

500
00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:36.530
So in addiction is a complex psychological,

501
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:40.420
physiological process,
but which manifests in any behavior,

502
00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:44.650
any behavior that a first sons enjoys,
that a person enjoys,

503
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:49.510
find some relief fan and therefore craves in a short term but suffers negative

504
00:30:49.511 --> 00:30:52.780
consequences in the long term and doesn't give up despite the negative

505
00:30:52.781 --> 00:30:56.290
consequences.
So craving pleasure relief in a short term,

506
00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:01.570
negative consequences in the long term.
Inability to give it up.
No notice.

507
00:31:01.571 --> 00:31:04.750
Say has said nothing about substances.
I said,
any behavior?

508
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:08.950
So it could be related to cocaine,
crystal Meth,
heroin,
fentanyl,

509
00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:14.200
marijuana,
nicotine,
alcohol,
whatever.
Could also be sex,
gambling,

510
00:31:14.201 --> 00:31:19.120
internet relationships,
shopping,
eating work,

511
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:23.520
extreme sports,
working out,
um,
for Nagaffi,

512
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:27.820
any number of human activities.
So I said,
any behavior.

513
00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:33.060
Now the official definition of addiction and according the American Society for

514
00:31:33.611 --> 00:31:36.540
addiction medicine is that this is primary,

515
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:39.070
it's a primary brand disorder.

516
00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:42.910
It arises in the brain role largely due to genetic reasons.

517
00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.900
This is how they see it.
And I say that's just not true.
Uh,

518
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.870
the other popular idea,

519
00:31:49.871 --> 00:31:52.120
but addiction is that it's a choice that somebody makes,

520
00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:53.770
that people choose to be addicted,

521
00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.640
which is what the legal system is based on because if people don't like choosing

522
00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:02.020
what are we punishing them for?
And,
and uh,

523
00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:03.830
<v 7>yeah,</v>

524
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:08.270
<v 1>so I,
although I think the medical definition is closer to the truth,</v>

525
00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:10.400
I don't see it as just genetic.

526
00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:13.690
It's a genetic disorder and I don't see it as a primary brain disorders.

527
00:32:13.691 --> 00:32:15.920
So let me perhaps show you why,
if that's okay.

528
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:21.080
So I give you this definition of addiction again,
craving relief,
pleasure,

529
00:32:21.081 --> 00:32:24.590
short term,
negative consequences,
long term,
inability to give it up.

530
00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.800
Would you be willing to tell them if you've ever had an addiction in your life?

531
00:32:27.801 --> 00:32:29.540
I don't care what to do.
I'm not asking what.

532
00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.670
<v 0>Oh,
yeah.
Oh,
I,
I can,
I can say yes and I can tell you exactly what it was.</v>

533
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:38.770
I in high school,
so I saw,
I suffered for,

534
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.960
from what I suppose most people would consider depressive periods beginning

535
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:50.680
at latest age 10 and never found relief from that until I was

536
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:56.380
<v 4>okay.</v>

537
00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:00.970
<v 0>Competing in wrestling very seriously in high school all throughout high school</v>

538
00:33:00.971 --> 00:33:05.470
and an older teammate introduced me to a federal.

539
00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:08.590
So the federal,
uh,
federal hydrochloride,

540
00:33:08.591 --> 00:33:12.610
which for those people who are curious,

541
00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.250
uh,
is,
well,

542
00:33:15.251 --> 00:33:19.270
at least at one point ephedrine was found at the very least pseudoephedrine and

543
00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.850
something called primatene mist used for asthma.

544
00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.850
And I think they also mixed it with Guaifenesin.
Nonetheless.

545
00:33:24.851 --> 00:33:27.760
The reason you cannot buy in many places,

546
00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:31.660
large amounts of primatene mist is because people freebased it into

547
00:33:31.661 --> 00:33:34.270
methamphetamine.
That's right.
So you have a federation,

548
00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:37.660
which is a very strong stimulant combined with caffeine and aspirin.

549
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:39.310
And when you combine those three,

550
00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:44.290
it's not an incremental increase in effect.
It's a,
I mean,

551
00:33:44.291 --> 00:33:48.100
it's probably logarithmic.
It's a very synergistic effect.
Exponentially.
Exactly.

552
00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:52.270
And he was recommending it for increased endurance.

553
00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:56.020
And uh,
there there is some effect,

554
00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.870
although it's also very highly thermogenic,
which wasn't good for me.

555
00:33:58.871 --> 00:34:01.900
So it made me really hot,
which was already a weakness of mine,

556
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:07.150
but it ended up providing me with relief.

557
00:34:07.151 --> 00:34:10.870
It was a very strong stimulant and I began to not only use it for sports,

558
00:34:10.871 --> 00:34:12.040
but self medicate using it.

559
00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:16.860
<v 1>Okay.
So great.
So let me quickly ask you,
what did it do for you?</v>

560
00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.090
Relief from what?

561
00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.240
<v 0>Uh,
it's,</v>

562
00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:26.860
it's made me or at least contributed to a euphoria,

563
00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:33.380
uh,
optimism,
uh,
energy.

564
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:38.300
So I didn't,
I didn't,
I didn't feel the symptoms of what I,
in retrospect,

565
00:34:38.301 --> 00:34:41.720
I would call it depression,
the low lethargy,
uh,

566
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.240
the pessimistic lens through which I viewed things.

567
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:47.630
It seemed to magically just erase all of that in about 30 minutes.

568
00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:52.790
<v 1>So you've Forio literally means a good feeling.
Um,</v>

569
00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:56.940
it gave you energy,
it gives you,
made you feel good.
It made you up to a mistake.

570
00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:58.680
Also improved sports performance,
right?

571
00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:03.830
I'm not sure that are those good things or bad things to feel optimistic?

572
00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:06.060
Those are all good things.
In other words,

573
00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.820
the addiction wasn't your primary problem,
your problem,

574
00:35:08.821 --> 00:35:12.930
the problem is that you depressed that you lacked a sense of wellbeing,

575
00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.050
but you lacked energy.
Right.
So in other words,

576
00:35:16.051 --> 00:35:19.380
the addiction is not the primary problem.
It's an attempt to solve a problem.

577
00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:24.360
Right.
And then the real question is how did the problem arise?
In other words,

578
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.841
this is a rare,

579
00:35:24.841 --> 00:35:28.860
my theory is that it's always rooted in shelter trauma and that the addiction is

580
00:35:28.861 --> 00:35:31.410
an attempt to do deal with the effects of childhood trauma,

581
00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:35.370
which it does temporarily while it creates even more problems in the long term.

582
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.310
Right.
Uh,
I would have one side question for you.

583
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:42.630
Given that estimate was your drug of choice,
this may not be true for you,

584
00:35:42.631 --> 00:35:45.720
but do you think about the Spec?
You might've had ADHD as a kid?

585
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.430
Quite possibly because typically people with Adhd,

586
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.910
self medicate with stimulants because hardly tweeted age.

587
00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:56.720
I'll be giving people stimulants,
Ritalin,
methylphenidate method.

588
00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:01.740
And so lots of people that choose are stimulants of self medication like

589
00:36:02.011 --> 00:36:05.590
nicotine and caffeine and crystal meth and Ephedra and are actually self

590
00:36:05.591 --> 00:36:07.920
medicating idiot suits.
Very likely.
Yeah.

591
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:11.410
<v 0>And I was punished by teachers for,</v>

592
00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.410
I wouldn't say not paying attention,

593
00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.930
but being interested in other things in class.

594
00:36:16.931 --> 00:36:21.010
So I remember very distinctly my kindergarten teacher,
I'll name her by name,

595
00:36:21.011 --> 00:36:24.820
it's,
it's shameful.
Mrs Ms Bevin,
her,
Mrs Bevin,

596
00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.480
I refuse to learn the alphabet because she wouldn't give me a good reason why I

597
00:36:28.481 --> 00:36:30.880
needed to learn the alphabet.
It was just,
you need to learn the alphabet.

598
00:36:30.881 --> 00:36:33.850
So she made me,
it's soap in front of the class and put me at the bad table.

599
00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:37.360
She got with that too.
But I was always interested in doing many,
many,

600
00:36:37.361 --> 00:36:39.550
many things.
And in fact,
the reason,

601
00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:44.230
one of the reasons that I started wrestling is because I was very hyperactive

602
00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:48.730
and is,
I believe the story goes.

603
00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:52.360
Other mothers recommended to my mom that she put me into something called kitty

604
00:36:52.361 --> 00:36:57.280
wrestling to drain my batteries before I got home.
So that makes perfect sense.

605
00:36:57.281 --> 00:36:59.620
I've never been drawn to d depressants,

606
00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:03.860
never been drawn to opiates.
In fact,
after surgeries,
uh,

607
00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:08.150
I get very sick if I'm given Vicodin or anything like that.
So I've opted out,
uh,

608
00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:12.520
have never personally had any issues with alcohol.
The,
a lot of people do.

609
00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:15.810
It's always been a draw to stimulants.
And once the,

610
00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:19.300
we don't have to go down this,
this,
this path cause I want to,

611
00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:24.340
I want you to be able to focus on,
on these,
these definitions.

612
00:37:24.341 --> 00:37:25.090
But,
uh,

613
00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:30.090
where I got myself into trouble was having never been physically addicted to any

614
00:37:30.611 --> 00:37:34.450
substance before.
I started using ECA stack once a day.

615
00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.620
My friend was doing it twice a day.

616
00:37:35.621 --> 00:37:38.410
I started using it twice a day and then I start using it three times a day and

617
00:37:38.411 --> 00:37:41.300
you develop a tolerance very quickly,
right?
More and more.

618
00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.960
And if you stop the withdrawal symptoms are of Sofa.

619
00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:48.310
I had never experienced that.
So I continued after sports to use this.

620
00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:52.480
And uh,
certainly in the long term there are some,

621
00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:57.640
some very nasty side effects,
but I didn't stop.
I mean for many,

622
00:37:57.641 --> 00:37:58.474
many years.

623
00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:01.630
<v 1>Well,
so there's a great link within 80 at the end,</v>

624
00:38:01.631 --> 00:38:06.370
addictions and not just because they both begin with the same three letters.
Um,

625
00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:09.670
and I can tell you what my own ADHD and this is the way we go back to charter it

626
00:38:09.671 --> 00:38:12.160
again,
so that tuning out,
that absent mindedness,

627
00:38:12.161 --> 00:38:15.910
that desire to scatter your attention all over the place,
that's not a disease.

628
00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.420
They say it's an inherited disease,
the hell it is.

629
00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:23.410
That tuning out dad divided attention is actually,

630
00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:27.070
but let me give you a personal question again.

631
00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:31.660
If I were to become abusive towards you right now,
verbally or otherwise,

632
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:35.980
what would be your options right now?
I could

633
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.190
<v 2>ignore you.
That's not what you would do first.</v>

634
00:38:39.191 --> 00:38:41.770
Is it not likely?
I mean,

635
00:38:41.771 --> 00:38:46.630
I would right now I would probably just listen and pause.

636
00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:50.800
I shut down often if I get attacked verbally because I don't want to respond

637
00:38:50.801 --> 00:38:52.960
with rage,
which has historically been my response.

638
00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:56.660
<v 1>I hear you.
But uh,
but let's get a bit more basic about it.</v>

639
00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:01.640
The rational response,
if I were to become a new sieve would be for you to just,

640
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:04.760
uh,
a search yourself.
St.
Don't talk to me that way.
Right.

641
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:09.440
Or it would be to leave saying,
this interview is over.

642
00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.700
And if for some reason you had not the strength to duty though those,

643
00:39:13.701 --> 00:39:16.370
there's other people in the room here with us,
you could ask for help.
Right?

644
00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:20.030
But what if you couldn't escape,
fight back or seek help,

645
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:22.070
then you would shut down or tune out.

646
00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:25.790
Right now there's the tuning out is simply a defensive response on the part of

647
00:39:25.791 --> 00:39:26.624
the brain.

648
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:31.700
And they'll put me back into my infancy when my mother's so grief stricken that

649
00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:36.710
I'm crying cause she's in pain.
And I'll read you a quote here.
Find a yes please.

650
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:42.020
And uh,
this has to do with,
uh,
the,

651
00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:44.060
the sensitive child.

652
00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:49.550
The child is very open and can feel the pain and suffering and going on its

653
00:39:49.551 --> 00:39:50.630
immediate environment.

654
00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:56.090
The child is aware of his own body and can also feel the tension,
rigidity,

655
00:39:56.091 --> 00:39:59.630
and pain in the body of the mother of an everyone else he's with.

656
00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:01.490
If the mother's suffering,

657
00:40:01.491 --> 00:40:05.180
the baby suffers to the pain never gets discharged.

658
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:10.630
The organism does not develop the confidence that it can regulate itself,

659
00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:16.240
that things will happen the way they should.
Hanse lack of optimism.
Okay.

660
00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:19.940
Now
Mama didn't abuse me.

661
00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:25.670
She did her best to look after me,
but she was stressed,
depressed,

662
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:27.920
terrorized,
grief stricken

663
00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.740
and picking that up as a sensitive infant.
Can I fight back,

664
00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:39.020
change the situation or escape?
Nope.
None of those.
What can I do?

665
00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:44.150
Nothing I can do.
My brain will tune out as a way of dealing with the stress.

666
00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.780
So I'm not talking about abuse here,
I'm just dealing what?

667
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:50.120
Stressed mothering or panting.
The Chas Bandon will tune out.

668
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:53.930
When did the Cias Baining at tuning out when the brain is developing.

669
00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:58.250
So the tuning out then becomes programmed is the default setting and that's why

670
00:40:58.251 --> 00:41:01.970
Edd,
so it's not an inherited disease,
it's not a disease at all.

671
00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.010
It begins as a coping mechanism,

672
00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.950
which thing gets programmed into the brain and is a lot of these early quarter

673
00:41:07.951 --> 00:41:09.230
mechanisms function.

674
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:12.470
They help you in the short term create problems in the long term.

675
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:15.170
And that's atds one of these examples.

676
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:20.570
And of course it also most more porn makes you more prone to be addicted because

677
00:41:20.571 --> 00:41:25.220
now when you're tuned out,
life becomes a less interesting.

678
00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:29.570
You shut emotional,
you protect yourself.
Now you feel depressed.

679
00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:32.210
What does depression actually means?
You said you were depressed.

680
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:36.740
What does mean to depress something is to push it down?
Well,

681
00:41:36.741 --> 00:41:41.210
do people push it down in depression?
The pushed on her emotions.
Why would they?

682
00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.920
Because the emotions are too painful.

683
00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.130
So even depression becomes as a coping mechanism.

684
00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.170
You'll push it down so you don't feel the pain,

685
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:51.260
but then later on that interferes with your life functioning.

686
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:55.220
So it all begins as a coping mechanism and later on becomes a source of

687
00:41:55.221 --> 00:41:58.880
dysfunction.
And all this is happening when the brain is actually developing,

688
00:41:58.881 --> 00:42:02.150
which we can talk about later.
So,
um,

689
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:07.640
these are the links I began to make,
including after I was diagnosed with it.

690
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.760
So I,

691
00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.200
and then despite the fact that a couple of my kids were diagnosed and knew that

692
00:42:12.201 --> 00:42:13.520
this wasn't the genetic disease,

693
00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:17.160
that what it is is actually is a coping mechanism and had,

694
00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:19.160
which got programmed to the brain.

695
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.630
And then when I read the literature on brain development,
wow,

696
00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:28.010
it turns out the human brain is shaped by the environment and particularly by

697
00:42:28.011 --> 00:42:29.810
the adult child relationships.

698
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.170
And so it all began to make perfect sense to me.

699
00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:35.163
<v 0>There,</v>

700
00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:40.420
there are few things I'd love to underscore or reiterate because I think they're

701
00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:45.380
very astute and very helpful.
Uh,

702
00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:49.630
and certainly if I had had some of these reframes,
I think that,

703
00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:51.580
uh,

704
00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:56.380
I would have been able to be proactive with working on a lot of my own issues

705
00:42:56.710 --> 00:43:00.610
much,
much earlier.
Uh,
me too,
by the way.
Yeah.

706
00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:03.280
Uh,
for instance,
uh,

707
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:05.110
<v 4>okay,</v>

708
00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:06.020
<v 0>we can come back to this.</v>

709
00:43:06.021 --> 00:43:07.880
I'm actually just going to mention two things and then we can,

710
00:43:07.881 --> 00:43:08.930
we can go where that takes us.

711
00:43:08.931 --> 00:43:13.160
But the first is rather than asking why the addiction asking why the pain,

712
00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:17.060
instead of looking at the,
the consequences,

713
00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:21.440
looking at the causes and not confusing the,

714
00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.920
the symptoms with the causes.
So instead of asking why the addiction,

715
00:43:24.921 --> 00:43:27.590
asking why the pain and the the other,
this,

716
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:29.510
this might take a moment for me to read,

717
00:43:29.511 --> 00:43:33.620
but I think it's worth reading and I should say that he had compassion for

718
00:43:33.621 --> 00:43:37.540
addiction.
This is an organization cofounded by,
uh,
you,

719
00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:40.940
yourself and Vicky.
I'm going to make a guess.

720
00:43:40.941 --> 00:43:45.230
I've never actually said her last name,
but do lie or do lie.
Uh,
Vicky,

721
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:48.620
just for,
for context,
for folks who are wondering,

722
00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:52.130
I was actually the very first person about five years ago to recommend that we

723
00:43:52.131 --> 00:43:54.710
meet and then I took a note of it in a notebook I still have.

724
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:59.480
And that's part of the reason that I reached out for the book.
And

725
00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:02.780
just because we may revisit this,

726
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:06.260
I met Vicky at a gathering at

727
00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:11.550
the home of someone named George Sarlow,
right?
Who has a lot in,

728
00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:16.830
who shares a lot of common background with you and certainly common interests.

729
00:44:16.831 --> 00:44:19.760
But what we'll come back to that,
the part that I want it to read

730
00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:27.340
is,
is the following,
and
I'm going to make my,

731
00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:30.460
make an attempt here.
All right,
so the mainstream view of addiction,

732
00:44:30.461 --> 00:44:32.250
you mentioned this to the clinical perspectives,

733
00:44:32.251 --> 00:44:35.490
that addiction is a matter of individual choice,
moral failure or weakness,

734
00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:38.130
which is why so many approaches are based on deterrence and punishment,

735
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.410
which includes,
uh,
self help approaches for that matter that,
uh,

736
00:44:43.411 --> 00:44:45.180
that I've attempted myself.

737
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.420
The clinical view is that addiction is a disease of the brain with disorders of

738
00:44:48.421 --> 00:44:51.500
brain circuits and behaviors and accurate yet narrow perspective.

739
00:44:51.501 --> 00:44:52.141
So I think that's,

740
00:44:52.141 --> 00:44:56.790
that's a really important align and accurate yet narrow perspective.

741
00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:00.870
So perhaps accurate,
but incomplete,
right?

742
00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:05.010
It is accurate that in the addicted brain that the addicted brain is

743
00:45:05.011 --> 00:45:07.500
demonstrably physiologically dysfunctional brain,

744
00:45:07.501 --> 00:45:10.980
but narrow because it seeks to explain the dysfunction in strictly physiological

745
00:45:10.981 --> 00:45:14.280
and biochemical terms without recognizing the emotional and social component,

746
00:45:14.281 --> 00:45:15.114
how the brain works.

747
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:20.720
And this was really driven home for me recently in the last several years I've

748
00:45:23.191 --> 00:45:25.350
gotten to know Tony Robbins.
Yes.

749
00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:29.280
And I attended an event not too long ago with several of my very close friends

750
00:45:29.281 --> 00:45:32.130
called date with destiny.
And at this event

751
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:36.420
he asked the audience of a 5,000 people,

752
00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:39.990
how many people here know someone who takes antidepressants?

753
00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:42.240
Pretty much every hand goes up.

754
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:46.350
How many people here know someone who takes antidepressants yet is still

755
00:45:46.351 --> 00:45:50.520
depressed and is probably 80% of the people who raised their hands the first

756
00:45:50.521 --> 00:45:51.180
time.

757
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:55.710
And I personally know quite a few people who take antidepressants,

758
00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:59.940
which,
uh,
seem to help on some level,
although the,

759
00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:04.260
a tolerance for some of these pharmaceutical cause it can also be developed very

760
00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:07.440
quickly.
And yet if,

761
00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:10.860
if my experience is anything like the experience of,

762
00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:12.810
or I should say if the experiences of other people's,

763
00:46:12.811 --> 00:46:16.140
anything like my personal experience with friends,
let's say,
who have depression,

764
00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:21.650
you witness these thought patterns and verbal patterns that can take them from

765
00:46:24.751 --> 00:46:26.100
the highest high or just a,

766
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:29.820
a baseline of optimism and drive them back into depression.

767
00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:31.163
And so they're just,

768
00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:35.070
it seems to be just from an empirical or observational standpoint more to the

769
00:46:35.071 --> 00:46:37.050
story.
Right.
So I,
I,

770
00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:41.760
I really appreciate you putting into words what I've grasped to try to

771
00:46:41.761 --> 00:46:45.780
understand and also convey.
Uh,

772
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:51.000
so with this definition of addiction,
how do you work with patients?

773
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:57.010
<v 6>Well,
let's go back to what I said.
What'd you quoted me saying?</v>

774
00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:58.810
Not why the addiction,
but why the pain?

775
00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:05.530
So if we understand that addiction in every case is rooted in some painful,
uh,

776
00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:06.940
internal experience,

777
00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:12.130
and that when you ask people what does the addiction do for you,
they'll say,

778
00:47:12.131 --> 00:47:17.110
it numbs me.
It was the pain.
It makes me feel connected with other people.

779
00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:19.270
It gives me a sense of control.

780
00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:23.530
It gives me inner peace or the lack of inner peace,

781
00:47:23.531 --> 00:47:25.780
the lack of control or the lack of connection.

782
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:29.080
They're all forms of emotional.

783
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:35.170
<v 1>If I ask the question not why the addiction,
but why the pain,</v>

784
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:40.830
then at least do an examination of that person's life rather than looking at

785
00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:42.370
just at their brain chemistry.

786
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:47.410
San quoted from an article that appeared in the journal Pediatrics,

787
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.740
which is the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

788
00:47:50.741 --> 00:47:52.540
It's about as specific as you can get.

789
00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:58.030
2012 the article comes from the Harvard Center on the developing child.

790
00:47:58.990 --> 00:47:59.291
Again,

791
00:47:59.291 --> 00:48:03.400
a prestigious child development research institution at Harvard University.

792
00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:10.050
This article did not present new information so much as it elegantly summarized

793
00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:15.310
decades of research and notice what they say.

794
00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:16.811
They see growing.

795
00:48:16.811 --> 00:48:21.370
Scientific evidence demonstrates that social and physical environments that

796
00:48:21.371 --> 00:48:24.190
threatened human development because of scarcity,

797
00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:29.290
stress or instability can lead to short term physiologic and psychological

798
00:48:29.291 --> 00:48:33.490
adjustments that are necessary for immediate survival and adaptation,

799
00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:36.700
but which may come at a significant cost to launch them.

800
00:48:36.701 --> 00:48:40.450
Outcomes in learning behavior,
health and longevity.

801
00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:44.020
That's what I was saying before that there's early adaptations like pushing down

802
00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:47.710
your feelings.
When the fingers are too painful,
we'll help you as an infant,

803
00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:50.170
young,
young child,
but then they cause problems later on.

804
00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:52.670
The tuning out that you do to to,

805
00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:56.320
to protect you from the stress in your environment.
If you're very sensitive,

806
00:48:56.321 --> 00:49:00.130
it doesn't take a lot of stress,
uh,
helps you and you are,

807
00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:04.000
but in the longterm becomes the problem.
That's exactly what they're saying.
No,

808
00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:07.640
a jump a few pages ahead to what they say about brain development.

809
00:49:07.641 --> 00:49:10.900
Then this is so crucial and it's so crucial because they still don't teach this

810
00:49:10.901 --> 00:49:14.890
to medical schools.
Even though scientifically is not even vaguely controversial,

811
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.760
the human brain develops an interaction with the environment.

812
00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:21.310
It's not genetically programmed purely.
Here's what they say.

813
00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:25.720
The architecture of the brain is constructed to an ongoing process that begins

814
00:49:25.721 --> 00:49:26.560
before birth,

815
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:31.950
continues into adulthood and establishes either a sturdy or a fragile foundation

816
00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:35.680
for all the health learning and behavior that follow,

817
00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:38.800
not some of the health learning,
all the health learning.

818
00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:41.110
And they'll notice what they say.
First of all,

819
00:49:41.111 --> 00:49:44.410
the architecture of the brain is constructed through an ongoing process that

820
00:49:44.411 --> 00:49:47.670
begins before birth,
which already means what happens in the wound.
Oh,

821
00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:48.670
it is an impact on you.

822
00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:52.330
So if you mother stressed and she's got high levels of stress hormone that's

823
00:49:52.331 --> 00:49:53.800
already affecting your brain development.

824
00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:57.310
And when you think of all this stress pregnant women out there,

825
00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:02.620
no one who has seen so many kids in trouble.
And we know from Machen Studies,

826
00:50:02.621 --> 00:50:06.470
international studies that when mothers are stressed,
uh,

827
00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:10.010
their placenta will naturally have more cortisol and adrenaline and stress

828
00:50:10.011 --> 00:50:12.610
hormones.
Those kids would be more likely to have stress.

829
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:16.090
She was later on abnormal special on levels,
even at one year of age,

830
00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.430
behavioral problems,
learning problems and so on,

831
00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:23.290
which tells us a law as to why adapted kids adopted kids have so many more

832
00:50:23.291 --> 00:50:27.680
problems.
That's another issue.
But the next paragraph is key.

833
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:32.800
The interruptions of genes and experiences literally shapes the circuitry,

834
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:36.770
the developing brain and his critic.
Lynn critically influenced by,

835
00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:37.970
in other words,

836
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:42.740
the circuitry that chemistry of the brain and which centers and with circuits

837
00:50:42.741 --> 00:50:46.550
and which systems develop and which neuro chemicals will be presenting and what

838
00:50:46.551 --> 00:50:51.551
quantities depends on the early environment and is critically influenced by do a

839
00:50:53.031 --> 00:50:56.210
mutual responsiveness of adult child relationships,

840
00:50:56.211 --> 00:50:59.030
particularly in the early childhood years.
In other words,

841
00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:03.170
the most important influence shaping the physiological development of the brain

842
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:05.300
is the quality of parent child relationships.

843
00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:10.890
And the one parents are stressed or distracted or workaholics,
like I was,
uh,
uh,

844
00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:15.410
a young parent.
Uh,
if there is instability,

845
00:51:15.411 --> 00:51:18.020
economic troubles,
relationship troubles,

846
00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:22.160
unresolved trauma on the part of the pant,
loving parents who are just stressed,

847
00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:24.380
that'll interfere with a child's brain development.

848
00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:26.630
That's why we're seeing so much weight.
The HD now,

849
00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.640
so much more waters and then so much for other problems because of stress in

850
00:51:29.641 --> 00:51:34.010
theF and in society.
That affects the parenting environment.
In other words,
yes,

851
00:51:34.011 --> 00:51:37.640
there's physiological problems with the brain,
but it's not a genetic issue.

852
00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:40.280
It's really through the experience.

853
00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:43.640
So when you look at brain scans of adults that are troubled brain scans,

854
00:51:43.641 --> 00:51:46.730
as you do an addicts,
you're not just looking at the impact of addiction.

855
00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:50.960
You also looking at the impact of Charter Toronto and chartered stress.

856
00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:53.810
And this has been shown over and over and over and over again.

857
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:56.960
So there's no separation between the physiology and the psychology.

858
00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:00.780
So if you come to me as an addict,
then you say,

859
00:52:00.781 --> 00:52:03.330
I got such and such and I asked you what does it do for you?

860
00:52:03.331 --> 00:52:06.770
When you say it numbs the pain that my question is where did you develop the

861
00:52:06.771 --> 00:52:07.610
pain,
what happened?

862
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:12.320
And then we have an inquiry and not no longer becomes a shameful thing that you

863
00:52:12.321 --> 00:52:13.790
chose this.
No,

864
00:52:13.791 --> 00:52:16.670
doesn't mean that you stuck with it because you've got this genetic problem.

865
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:22.000
We get it as an adaptive response to something that happened and we can heal

866
00:52:22.161 --> 00:52:22.994
that.

867
00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:28.300
The reason why addiction treatment is failing is because physicians don't

868
00:52:29.811 --> 00:52:32.210
understand is Dickie dealing with the effects,

869
00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.580
which is the addiction and the behaviors,

870
00:52:34.581 --> 00:52:37.160
which shows the effects of the addiction,
but not the cause,

871
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:42.230
which is the charter of distress and the impact of charter distress that carry

872
00:52:42.231 --> 00:52:45.020
into adulthood.
You know,
there was hugs,

873
00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:50.060
state prisoners of sheltered and so president methods of treatment in psychiatry

874
00:52:50.091 --> 00:52:55.091
and addiction medicine and childhood psychiatry deal with the facts rather than

875
00:52:55.311 --> 00:52:58.940
causes.
And this is where we're so ineffective at it.

876
00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:05.720
<v 2>I've,
I've many questions.
Yeah.
Uh,
so the,
the first is just to,</v>

877
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:10.590
to underscore something,
which is,
you know,
the,
our software,
you know,

878
00:53:10.591 --> 00:53:12.600
the genetics play a role but do,

879
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:17.630
but it's not a comprehensive explanation for what we're discussing skimpy

880
00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:20.990
<v 1>to suppose,
but they don't pay the tournament.
Right,
exactly.
No,</v>

881
00:53:20.991 --> 00:53:24.140
there were very few genetic diseases.
There's one runs in my family,

882
00:53:24.141 --> 00:53:26.890
muscular dystrophy.
If you've got the gene,
you'll have the disease.
My Pimp,

883
00:53:26.891 --> 00:53:28.890
my mother had it right.
That would be predetermined.

884
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:32.730
That just predetermined veverial to those diseases.

885
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:35.540
<v 8>Okay.</v>

886
00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:38.600
<v 1>Let me tell you an interesting study from either Australia or New Zealand.</v>

887
00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.690
They looked at a group of people for aggression.

888
00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:45.380
They found that the most aggressive people had a certain gene variant.

889
00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.550
You think they found the gene for aggression?
No,

890
00:53:49.551 --> 00:53:53.270
they didn't because the least aggressive people in the group had the same gene.

891
00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:58.160
So the most aggressive and the least aggressive shared the same gene as compared

892
00:53:58.161 --> 00:54:01.850
to the average.
The gene could not have been for aggression.
No.

893
00:54:01.851 --> 00:54:05.240
If you actually looked at the life histories of those people,

894
00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:09.860
the most aggressive people had been brought up in troubled,

895
00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:12.890
sometimes abusive,
but always very stressed homes.

896
00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:17.030
The least aggressive robot brought in very nurturing homes.

897
00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:20.990
What was the gene for sensitivity?

898
00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:24.720
The more sensitive you are,
the more you're going to be affected.

899
00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:27.440
When you brought up in a peaceful home,
you're gonna get that much more peaceful.

900
00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:30.920
When you're brought up in,
in,
uh,
in,
in,
and a stormy home,

901
00:54:30.921 --> 00:54:35.040
you're going to be that much more aggressive.
So there are these predispositions,

902
00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:39.890
but then not for specific illnesses,
therefore,
temperament.
Right?

903
00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:42.830
Which means that you're going to be more or less affected by the environment.

904
00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:46.310
And so yeah,
there's some Peter's supposing juniors will be no,

905
00:54:46.311 --> 00:54:50.870
both from animal studies in monkey studies and human studies that even you find

906
00:54:50.871 --> 00:54:54.530
a gene that for similar reasons,
predispose somebody to addiction.

907
00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:59.450
If that animal or if that human being is brought up in a good nurturing

908
00:54:59.451 --> 00:55:00.290
circumstances,

909
00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:04.940
their risk of addiction is no greater than creatures without that gene.
Right?

910
00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:09.200
So it's just not a genetic disease.
And the fact that it runs in families,

911
00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:12.080
it doesn't prove anything because,
you know,

912
00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:16.760
as I always point out on a medical doctor and if two of my kids become medical

913
00:55:16.761 --> 00:55:18.650
doctors of,
which is no danger whatsoever,

914
00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:22.250
but if they did that wouldn't prove that the practice of medicine is a genetic

915
00:55:22.251 --> 00:55:23.084
disease.

916
00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:27.740
<v 0>Right.
All right.
It's,
it's,
it's not a,
it's not a catch all explanation.
Also,</v>

917
00:55:27.741 --> 00:55:31.970
you have,
I mean,
because of a few of the books I've written,

918
00:55:31.971 --> 00:55:36.971
I hear a lot of stories both successful and unsuccessful about people attempting

919
00:55:37.611 --> 00:55:41.600
to lose weight.
And,
uh,
they'll often say,
well,
it runs in my family.
Like,

920
00:55:41.601 --> 00:55:44.420
my parents are fat,
my grandparents are fat.
And they'll say,
do you have pets?

921
00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:47.270
And they'll say,
yes,
I'll say,
or your pets overweight.
And they're like,
yeah,

922
00:55:47.271 --> 00:55:50.510
my pets are fat.
Okay,
well clearly,

923
00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:53.510
clearly not just a genetic issue.

924
00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:55.390
<v 1>Well that,
may I say something on that?
Yeah.</v>

925
00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:58.300
But have you heard about the adverse childhood experiences studies,

926
00:55:58.870 --> 00:56:03.730
the ace studies,
the average child adverse adverse childhood experiences study?

927
00:56:04.310 --> 00:56:07.250
<v 0>You know,
I haven't,
but I feel like there's a questionnaire</v>

928
00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:09.830
<v 1>serious.
There's a test that you can take it.
There is,</v>

929
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:15.050
so the address charter expensive studies were done in California,
but I think 17,

930
00:56:15.051 --> 00:56:19.520
14 or 17,000 adults,
mostly Caucasians,
half of them university educated.

931
00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:23.730
And to look at the relationship between childhood adversity and adult outcomes

932
00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:28.390
and an adverse childhood experience was defined as physical or sexual or

933
00:56:28.391 --> 00:56:33.320
emotional abuse at divorce,
at parent being jailed,
um,

934
00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:36.970
violence in the family,
a brand being addicted that pending mentally ill,

935
00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:40.810
a pant,
dying.
Um,

936
00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:45.490
these were the main ones.
And for each of these adverse childhood experiences,

937
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:48.040
the risk of addiction goes up exponentially.

938
00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:51.910
The risk of autoimmune disease go up there.
Just going,
depression goes up.

939
00:56:51.970 --> 00:56:56.590
The risk of Adhd goes up.
The risk of,
uh,
relationship problems,
STDs,

940
00:56:56.591 --> 00:57:00.010
everything goes up.
Now,
you know how these studies started,

941
00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:05.140
these studies started an obesity clinic.
The Dr. Vincent Felitti,

942
00:57:05.141 --> 00:57:09.490
uh,
who was a San Diego internist,
wonderful guy,

943
00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:12.250
a deep thinker and researcher.

944
00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:18.160
They noticed that at this clinic with rigorous dietary control and exercise,

945
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:20.770
they could help people lose weight.
But what even they couldn't do,

946
00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:25.040
<v 0>couldn't ensure they continue those here.</v>

947
00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:27.470
<v 1>Here's when they'd live.
Exactly.
They couldn't help him keep it off.</v>

948
00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:30.140
And then Felitti did something that's,

949
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:32.480
I have to say is unusual for a medical doctor.

950
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:35.450
He listened to his patients and they said,
don't you get it?

951
00:57:35.810 --> 00:57:39.050
We're stuffing down our pain.
This is all based on childhood trauma.

952
00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:43.520
And so obesity itself is a response to childhood trauma.

953
00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:48.020
It's just another addiction.
Uh,
I could talk about it in many ways,
but,

954
00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:53.090
and the adverse childhood experiences studies have been repeated numerous times,

955
00:57:53.091 --> 00:57:57.800
nine other countries,
all those with the same results.
And,
uh,

956
00:57:58.310 --> 00:58:03.310
so that the obesity epidemic right now is not just an epidemic of junk foods

957
00:58:04.491 --> 00:58:08.750
and,
and,
and,
and sedentary lifestyles.
That is true.
Yeah,

958
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:10.760
those are contributing factors,
but it's,

959
00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:14.660
but the underlying basis as people self soothing the stresses in their lives.

960
00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:17.000
And so it's really an epidemic of stress.

961
00:58:17.130 --> 00:58:20.060
<v 0>So let me return to another point,
uh,</v>

962
00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:23.840
or one thing you said in passing,

963
00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:29.290
which I'd love to dig into a little bit and that was how at the time say the

964
00:58:30.591 --> 00:58:33.530
example I think we were discussing.
Well,
actually before that,

965
00:58:33.531 --> 00:58:37.250
let me mention one thing.
So I've had my entire g my full genome sequence,

966
00:58:38.090 --> 00:58:43.090
a predisposition predisposition to alcoholism is very prevalent in my family

967
00:58:43.131 --> 00:58:45.980
from a genetic standpoint,
just from a software basis.
However,

968
00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:51.470
I mentioned earlier,
I never had issues with alcoholism,
with stimulants.
So,
uh,

969
00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:54.850
just,
just as,
just as a footnote,
but what I was going to,

970
00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:58.250
what I'd love to ask you and then I'd really love to hear what you do with

971
00:58:58.251 --> 00:59:01.790
patients and once you start looking at their pain and the tools you use or the

972
00:59:01.791 --> 00:59:02.630
approaches you use.
But

973
00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:09.520
the one of the epiphany's for me in the last very recent,

974
00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:16.600
a year or two has been looking at my coping mechanisms very differently.

975
00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:20.960
And what I mean by that,

976
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:25.850
for very long time I had certain behaviors,

977
00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:30.020
certain defaults that,
uh,
I hate it,

978
00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:32.390
which of course means I'm hating a part of myself.

979
00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:36.920
And that included anger,
rage responses,
uh,

980
00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:40.360
use of stimulants,
you name it.
Uh,

981
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:45.350
uh,
a close friend of mine who is a therapist,
but I've never,

982
00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:50.380
I've never engaged him as a therapist and a,

983
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:52.400
there are certainly plenty of bad therapists out there,

984
00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:56.720
which I think is a separate topic.
Nonetheless.

985
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:59.480
He was helping,
and I'm sure we'll get back to this,

986
00:59:59.481 --> 01:00:04.481
but in preparation for a very controlled supervise psychedelic experience,

987
01:00:04.941 --> 01:00:09.290
he was helping a,
another friend of ours prepare is this with the Mvma?

988
01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:12.680
This is with Iosco.
Okay.
And,
uh,
this,

989
01:00:12.681 --> 01:00:17.681
this person had a number of addictions and she hated these addictions.

990
01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:22.710
And she said,
I hate these.
I realized there they're terrible.
They've,

991
01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.070
they've ruined my life.
They're ruining my life.

992
01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:29.780
And it was all a negative relationship to these behaviors.
And he said,

993
01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.640
did these ever serve you?
Did these ever help?
What did these do for you?

994
01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:36.020
And she,

995
01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:41.050
and she described how they helped her cope with very difficult circumstances

996
01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:43.850
early on.
And he said,

997
01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:48.830
perhaps what you should do as an exercise and what we can do is for you to

998
01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:54.100
effectively thank those behavior for the role they played and for them the

999
01:00:54.171 --> 01:00:57.350
necessity they filled.

1000
01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:02.810
And to then recognize,
you know,
thank them for their duty effectively,

1001
01:01:02.811 --> 01:01:05.300
but to let them go because they're no longer needed.

1002
01:01:05.301 --> 01:01:09.080
And that was a huge eye opener for me.

1003
01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.240
And I began to,

1004
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:14.270
this has coincided with a number of things and I want to take us off the rails,

1005
01:01:14.271 --> 01:01:19.271
but began to use something called loving kindness meditation,

1006
01:01:20.001 --> 01:01:22.700
or met him.
I met a Emmy TTA meditation,

1007
01:01:22.701 --> 01:01:25.160
which was introduced to by a gentleman from Google.

1008
01:01:25.161 --> 01:01:28.640
Actually a formerly Google shade Manc 10 and then also Jack Kornfield,

1009
01:01:28.641 --> 01:01:31.700
who really reiterated for me,
of course,
but I never applied it to myself.

1010
01:01:31.701 --> 01:01:34.160
I always applied this loving kindness meditation to other people.

1011
01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:39.790
And what was recommended is that I apply that loving kindness to these two,

1012
01:01:40.941 --> 01:01:42.110
the younger Tim,

1013
01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:46.580
to the other versions of Tim who had these behaviors that I had grown to hate

1014
01:01:46.581 --> 01:01:50.360
and resent,
and to actually thank them for the role they played.
For instance,

1015
01:01:50.361 --> 01:01:50.961
that rage,

1016
01:01:50.961 --> 01:01:55.940
that anger was the fuel that got me out of Long Island and a where I grew up

1017
01:01:55.941 --> 01:01:59.630
there a lot of serious drug issues,
particularly with opiates.

1018
01:01:59.631 --> 01:02:02.250
And my best friend died of fentanyl.
Uh,

1019
01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:06.280
many of my friends are addicted to opiates.
I who I grew up with,
uh,

1020
01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:10.070
many have died and I got out because I was angry in part.

1021
01:02:10.071 --> 01:02:10.880
I think that was the fuel,

1022
01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:15.710
but that fuel ended up over the longterm being very corrosive,
but to,

1023
01:02:15.711 --> 01:02:18.890
in a way to reconcile myself with that,

1024
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.750
I had to stop presenting it.
Uh,

1025
01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:26.790
and I suppose it's maybe more of a confession than a question,
but your,

1026
01:02:26.791 --> 01:02:30.420
your comment,
uh,
brought it to mind.

1027
01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:34.230
And maybe as a,
as a Segue,
I just love to hear,

1028
01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:36.400
<v 8>okay.</v>

1029
01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.930
<v 0>And we can take it anywhere we want of course.</v>

1030
01:02:37.931 --> 01:02:42.820
But once you have shifted the focus from why the diction to why the pain and you

1031
01:02:42.821 --> 01:02:44.140
start to work with someone,

1032
01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.800
what approaches have you found to help?
What tools?

1033
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:53.180
<v 1>Well,
so I very much solute your friends approach.</v>

1034
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:56.920
It's exactly what the approach I would take myself and

1035
01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:03.630
I call it compassionate inquiry.
So inquiry in a compassionate way.

1036
01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:07.830
Now why did I do this?
But why did I do this?
Right?

1037
01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:11.340
The first one is not a question,
it's a statement.
It's a self condemnation.

1038
01:03:11.850 --> 01:03:16.800
The second one is a question.
Hmm,
wonder why I did this.
Ah,
is soothe my pain.

1039
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:21.990
And so what'd your fence said that it served you?
So thank it.
Love it,

1040
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:26.190
but let go of it is absolutely right.
I call it the stupid friend.

1041
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:28.560
The school was founded.
Is is is,
is,

1042
01:03:28.561 --> 01:03:31.590
is the one who helped you in a particular way at a certain time,

1043
01:03:31.591 --> 01:03:35.420
but it can't learn that that way doesn't function anymore.
Right?

1044
01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:37.050
Then instead of helping though,
it's hurting.

1045
01:03:37.410 --> 01:03:39.330
So it's a friend because it's what you're trying to help.

1046
01:03:39.350 --> 01:03:42.290
But it's stupid because this not learning that you no longer that three year
old,

1047
01:03:42.310 --> 01:03:44.730
that five year old or that 15 year old,
you know,

1048
01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:47.320
so this not,

1049
01:03:47.321 --> 01:03:52.321
this leads to the question of trauma because it's one thing to recognize that

1050
01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:57.450
all this originates in chartered pain.
It's quite another to transform that pain.

1051
01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:01.380
And for that we have to understand what trauma is.

1052
01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:04.800
So people often think that trauma is what happens to you.

1053
01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:09.830
So trauma is a divorce when you were small and your parents fighting trauma is

1054
01:04:10.891 --> 01:04:14.310
your mother's depression.
Trauma is your father's alcoholism.

1055
01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:19.200
Trauma is your parents argumentation,
traumas,

1056
01:04:19.201 --> 01:04:23.190
physical or sexual abuse or some loss.
Those aren't the traumas.

1057
01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:28.490
Those are traumatic.
But the trauma is not what happens to you,
the Traumas,

1058
01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:33.060
what happens inside you.
And as a result of these traumatic events,

1059
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:35.430
what happens inside you is yoga.

1060
01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:40.460
You get disconnected from your emotions and you disconnected from your body and

1061
01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:44.490
you have difficulty being in the present moment and you develop a negative view

1062
01:04:44.491 --> 01:04:48.930
of your world and a negative view of yourself and a defense of view of other

1063
01:04:48.931 --> 01:04:52.980
people.
And these perspectives keeps showing up in your life,

1064
01:04:52.981 --> 01:04:56.370
in the present because they had the stupid friends.

1065
01:04:57.630 --> 01:05:01.200
And so the issue is not just to recognize what happened at 10 15,

1066
01:05:01.201 --> 01:05:03.630
30 however many years ago,

1067
01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:08.370
but to actually recognize that manifestations in the present moment and to

1068
01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:11.970
transcend them.
And how do you do that?
By reconnecting with yourself,

1069
01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:16.590
by restoring the connection with your body primarily and with your emotions that

1070
01:05:16.591 --> 01:05:21.490
you lost.
And once you do,
when you found these things again,

1071
01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:23.830
then you have what we call a recovery.

1072
01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:28.210
Because what does it mean to recover something?
It needs to find it again.

1073
01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:31.470
So what is it that people find when they recover?

1074
01:05:31.471 --> 01:05:35.410
The find themselves and the loss of self is the essence of trauma.

1075
01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:39.940
So the real purpose of,
uh,
of,
of addiction treatment,

1076
01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:43.780
mental health treatment,
any kind of healing is reconnection

1077
01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:46.530
<v 0>for people who are listening.</v>

1078
01:05:46.590 --> 01:05:51.300
And want to reconnect with themselves,
with their bodies.
For instance,

1079
01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:54.150
what recommendations might you have,

1080
01:05:54.151 --> 01:05:58.980
whether that's things they can do or resources they can can look to,

1081
01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:03.270
uh,
or both or something else?
What,
what recommendations?

1082
01:06:03.271 --> 01:06:04.770
Because I'm sure I could actually,

1083
01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:10.890
I'm 100% sure because I've had people come on and for the very first time on

1084
01:06:10.891 --> 01:06:11.491
this podcast,

1085
01:06:11.491 --> 01:06:16.491
talk about sexual abuse that they endured as children and what they did to help

1086
01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:22.650
recover from that.
Uh,
many people listening,

1087
01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:24.870
I am sure have addictions,

1088
01:06:25.470 --> 01:06:29.820
both traumatic past experiences and trauma.
What,

1089
01:06:29.850 --> 01:06:33.300
what recommendations could you make for them?
Sure.

1090
01:06:34.330 --> 01:06:36.880
<v 1>So I want to say first of all,
that for trauma,</v>

1091
01:06:36.881 --> 01:06:41.550
you don't need terribly traumatic events.
So there's two ways to look at trauma.

1092
01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:44.890
One is the bad things happen.
I shouldn't have.
We've talked about those.

1093
01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:48.220
But the other way get traumatized is when good things happen that should've

1094
01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:52.990
happened.
So if the good,
good thing,
it didn't happen,
that should've happened.

1095
01:06:52.991 --> 01:06:55.720
Sorry.
So when you look,
look at the trope of omission,

1096
01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.510
trauma of a nation with the parents,
not that they didn't love you,

1097
01:06:58.511 --> 01:07:01.390
not that they didn't do their best,
but they were too stressed,
traumatized,

1098
01:07:01.391 --> 01:07:03.220
distracted themselves,
then you'd get,

1099
01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:06.940
didn't get the kind of attention and the kind of acceptance and the kind of

1100
01:07:06.941 --> 01:07:09.070
attuned being with that you needed.

1101
01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:13.510
That itself can make a disconnect from yourself.
The child needs that acceptance,

1102
01:07:13.511 --> 01:07:14.980
that connection,
that attunement.

1103
01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:18.940
Our brain development requires it or emotional development demands it.

1104
01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:22.150
And when we don't get it,
not because the parents don't love us,

1105
01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:26.950
but simply because of their own issues,
we can also suffer that disconnection.

1106
01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:30.610
So that's what what I call developmental trauma.
Um,

1107
01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:34.780
and now how do we connect?
Well,
there are many,

1108
01:07:34.781 --> 01:07:37.360
many forms of therapy,
uh,

1109
01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:41.590
is very difficult for anybody to do this on their own.
Some people do it.

1110
01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:43.300
I certainly couldn't do it on my own.

1111
01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:47.380
I've needed a lot of help in terms of therapy.
Uh,

1112
01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:51.470
that helps you understand what happened to me.
And so that is,

1113
01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:56.140
there's a reason for it.
Uh,
so that not as if there's a reason for it,

1114
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:59.950
then it's no longer me.
I'm not somebody to be ashamed of it.
I'm just,

1115
01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:03.490
somebody had developed along certain lines for some very good reasons,

1116
01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:08.800
but it's not in my deepest character and it's not who I am and I don't have to

1117
01:08:08.801 --> 01:08:11.290
be that way.
That's a relief to know.

1118
01:08:11.830 --> 01:08:16.100
It's also not that I'm genetically programs I'm doing to stay that way.
You know,

1119
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:19.370
number one.
Number two,
you have to reconnect with the body.

1120
01:08:19.810 --> 01:08:21.530
There are various body therapies.

1121
01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:26.240
My friend Peter Levine and his somatic experiencing walking tiger,

1122
01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:28.040
is that what it is?
Waking the tiger,
kicking the tire,

1123
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:31.160
we can attack it was his first book and he's written many wonderful books since

1124
01:08:31.161 --> 01:08:34.010
then.
Um,
uh,

1125
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:37.390
so some sematic somatic experience and gives method is called,

1126
01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:41.150
but she developed this brilliant,
there was Emdr,

1127
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:47.050
eye movement desensitization,
reprogramming,
uh,

1128
01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:52.040
which is a way of bypassing the conscious mind and getting through the emotional

1129
01:08:52.041 --> 01:08:57.020
brain and quicker than talk therapy by itself can do.

1130
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:58.370
So it's combined with talk therapy,

1131
01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:03.050
but it takes you past just a conscious defensive egoic mind.

1132
01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:07.850
Um,
there is emotional freedom tapping that people do.

1133
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:12.650
There's a various variations on that.
Um,
there is,

1134
01:09:12.651 --> 01:09:13.484
um,

1135
01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:18.800
there's motor sensory integration techniques.
Um,

1136
01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:23.480
there is,
then there was the traditional therapies like yoga.

1137
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:27.470
Now Yoga was not simply a physical modality when it first developed.

1138
01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:31.100
Yoga actually means unity.
So the very essence of yoga is this,

1139
01:09:31.101 --> 01:09:35.180
to regain that unity,
not just with ourselves,
but also with the larger creation.

1140
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:39.620
And so yoga,
when it's practiced in its intended way,

1141
01:09:39.710 --> 01:09:42.530
not just the hot yoga over you get a good workout.
That's great.

1142
01:09:42.531 --> 01:09:43.364
I'm not against it,

1143
01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:47.090
but I'm talking about intentional yoga with a meditative aspect to it,

1144
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:52.070
which is taught by a number of disciplines,
uh,
bodywork of all kinds.

1145
01:09:52.210 --> 01:09:54.710
I'm just gonna hit pause for one second.
Do you practice yoga?
And if so,

1146
01:09:54.711 --> 01:09:59.030
what type do you practice?
So I have always said that was my ADHD.

1147
01:09:59.031 --> 01:10:01.470
I'm not a yoga person.
I can't do it until you're,

1148
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:03.810
and a half ago I met actually a Yogi.
Uh,

1149
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:08.510
his name is Saad Guru and uh,
he's an Indian Yogi with a big following.

1150
01:10:08.511 --> 01:10:09.710
I was very skeptical,

1151
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:14.000
but I met the guy I know I have a 15 minute daily yoga practice,

1152
01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:17.360
which I did this morning before coming to the interview and has made an enormous

1153
01:10:17.361 --> 01:10:19.490
difference in my life with my ADHD mind.

1154
01:10:19.491 --> 01:10:22.190
I really have trouble just sitting there when they sit down on the meditation

1155
01:10:22.191 --> 01:10:25.820
cushion,
my mind is like all over the place,
but with the yoga,

1156
01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:29.690
which is more body-based,
uh,
I can stay much more present.

1157
01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:34.340
There's a meditational component to it.
Uh,

1158
01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:39.020
and so the answer is yes.
If you'd asked me 18 months ago,

1159
01:10:39.021 --> 01:10:41.900
I would've said no,
I support it,
but I don't do it.

1160
01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:47.030
But now I'm actually a very committed practitioner and it's really has made a

1161
01:10:47.031 --> 01:10:47.360
difference.

1162
01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:48.440
<v 2>Is there a particular,</v>

1163
01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:54.340
is it a particular type of yoga that people could Google or learn more about it?

1164
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:58.670
<v 1>Well,
so I'm not all yoga expert.
Then there's many forms of yoga.</v>

1165
01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:01.940
The other people more knowledgeable than I am because recommend,

1166
01:11:01.941 --> 01:11:06.941
but the one I learned is called inner engineering and it's taught by either

1167
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:11.000
Google or his followers.
Then you can look up in her engineering or engineering.

1168
01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:14.790
When I recommended it to France and others has been only being grateful.
Second,

1169
01:11:14.791 --> 01:11:17.050
highly recommended,
typically a,

1170
01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:19.560
there's to me what seems to be a cult or on the guy,

1171
01:11:19.561 --> 01:11:21.210
which I don't take too particularly,

1172
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:26.070
but he's the genuine article in terms of having a deep experience and being able

1173
01:11:26.071 --> 01:11:31.071
to try and submit that experience to others and creating a practical system

1174
01:11:31.411 --> 01:11:35.430
around it.
So it's worked for me.
I'm not here to recruit anybody else,

1175
01:11:35.431 --> 01:11:36.810
but since you asking,

1176
01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:40.070
<v 2>no,
no,
it's just my,
my fence.
Ppreciate yeah,
well,
you know,</v>

1177
01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:43.230
I'm not going to blame it on my fans.
I like specifics and my inner engineering,

1178
01:11:43.231 --> 01:11:47.160
you can look up online and it's taught here in the states and in Canada

1179
01:11:47.161 --> 01:11:50.670
internationally actually.
And I,
but I did interrupt you.
You're about to mention,

1180
01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:52.530
I think another technique,

1181
01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:57.060
<v 0>modality that can help.
You talked about,
uh,</v>

1182
01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:00.330
<v 2>for instance,
the somatic experiencing,
Emdr,
emotional freedom,
tapping,</v>

1183
01:12:00.331 --> 01:12:04.110
motor sensory integration technique or techniques,
Yoga.

1184
01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:05.730
And then there's something coming up after that.

1185
01:12:05.850 --> 01:12:10.230
<v 1>Well,
about 10 years ago I began to work with psychedelics.</v>

1186
01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:13.350
No.
If you're 15 years ago,

1187
01:12:13.351 --> 01:12:16.740
you were to ask me will ever be working with psychedelics as a healing modality,

1188
01:12:16.741 --> 01:12:21.510
I would have said you're out of your mind.
But then through a series of events,

1189
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:25.470
I became aware of the potential role of psychedelics in healing.

1190
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.430
And I've been doing work with them now for 10 years.

1191
01:12:29.490 --> 01:12:33.470
And they're another potent method.
Um,

1192
01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:34.710
they're not for everybody.

1193
01:12:34.711 --> 01:12:39.160
And I have to emphasize that whatever modality you choose of a sucky,

1194
01:12:39.161 --> 01:12:42.270
they're like nature.
You have to do it with adapt.

1195
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:46.200
Practition is with deep integrity and deep knowledge and experience,

1196
01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:49.380
but in such hands and in such a context,

1197
01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:54.120
it's can be like a superhighway to,
to self awareness.

1198
01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:56.490
I'm not in isolation,

1199
01:12:56.970 --> 01:13:00.660
but it opens doors that otherwise might take years.

1200
01:13:00.661 --> 01:13:05.661
And so it's not unusual for me to conduct the psychedelic session with somebody

1201
01:13:05.701 --> 01:13:10.140
or a series of sessions either in a group or individual setting and had them say

1202
01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:14.190
that was like 10 years of psychotherapy and one day.

1203
01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:17.370
And I've had the same experience myself.
So again,

1204
01:13:17.371 --> 01:13:20.760
it's not to be isolated from other kinds of work and it has to be integrated.

1205
01:13:21.210 --> 01:13:24.800
But it's not a potent way of working.
And of course,
as I know,

1206
01:13:24.801 --> 01:13:29.630
you are personally aware,
there's an increasing movement amongst psychologist,

1207
01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.990
therapist,
psychiatrist,
medical doctors,
uh,

1208
01:13:32.991 --> 01:13:36.000
other healers to find ways of incorporating,

1209
01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:39.780
incorporating psychedelic healing in the larger therapeutic scheme.

1210
01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:40.430
<v 2>Well,</v>

1211
01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:44.350
you mentioned as it related to Emdr and some of these other techniques that you,

1212
01:13:44.351 --> 01:13:45.184
that you listed

1213
01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:51.570
<v 0>that it is a potent way of bypassing the egoic mind and certainly,
uh,</v>

1214
01:13:51.730 --> 01:13:56.440
psychedelics as literally mind manifesting.

1215
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:58.600
That's right.
In that case,
uh,

1216
01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:04.860
are one very potent tool that or they are tools that have been used for

1217
01:14:05.681 --> 01:14:10.681
millennia in traditional or ceremonial context around the world for many

1218
01:14:11.411 --> 01:14:12.130
purposes,
but

1219
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:15.130
<v 6>including bypassing the analytical,</v>

1220
01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:19.060
rational prefrontal Cortex,
uh,
in,

1221
01:14:19.061 --> 01:14:23.080
in many capacities that you mentioned a series of events and I will come back to

1222
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:27.040
the psychedelics and ask you which you've chosen and why.
Sure.
Work with,

1223
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.990
but if you can mention any of them,

1224
01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:37.080
what were the series of events that led you sure to best to psychedelics?

1225
01:14:37.210 --> 01:14:41.980
And 2008,
uh,
my book on addiction in the realm of hungry ghosts,

1226
01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:45.340
close and Congress with addiction,
what was published in Canada.

1227
01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:48.070
And very quickly it became a number one national bestseller,

1228
01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:50.440
subsequently published in the states as well.

1229
01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:55.330
And I was in a book tour and uh,
people could ask me,

1230
01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.830
what do you know about addictions?

1231
01:14:56.831 --> 01:15:01.831
And I was called as a treatment Iowa square being a proven or Amazonia and vine

1232
01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:07.750
that's made into a brew that has psychedelic properties.
I knew nothing.

1233
01:15:08.710 --> 01:15:12.250
The next speech or the next event,
somebody else would ask,
what do you know?

1234
01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:15.480
But I was going to do an addiction.
I finally started getting annoyed with it.

1235
01:15:15.490 --> 01:15:18.580
Like,
leave me alone.
I've just written a book.
I've spent years researching it,

1236
01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:23.480
my life experience and all kinds of,
uh,
scientific,
uh,
uh,

1237
01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:26.560
exploration went into,
it asked me,
it was something I know about

1238
01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:33.300
and then I realized that maybe the universe is knocking on my door and somebody

1239
01:15:33.551 --> 01:15:36.250
said,
did you know you could experience it here in Vancouver?

1240
01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:41.530
There was a Peruvian Shaman leading some ceremonies up in Vancouver.
So

1241
01:15:43.090 --> 01:15:43.990
who am I to say no?

1242
01:15:43.991 --> 01:15:48.910
And I jumped right in and I sat in this tent with 50 other people.
50.

1243
01:15:48.970 --> 01:15:52.270
Yeah,
it was,
that's how they set it up.
It's not what,
it's not what I recommend,

1244
01:15:52.271 --> 01:15:53.290
but that's how they set it up.

1245
01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:58.860
They play beautiful music and there was a little baby in the room.

1246
01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:04.720
Uh,
mother and dad were therefore the experience.

1247
01:16:04.721 --> 01:16:09.721
The baby was in the room and the baby was cooling away and tears started flowing

1248
01:16:09.851 --> 01:16:14.410
down my face.
And these are not tears of sorrow.
They were tears of joy.

1249
01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:18.490
And I got in touch with such profound love that I had never consciously

1250
01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:19.330
experienced before.

1251
01:16:20.130 --> 01:16:20.963
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1252
01:16:21.150 --> 01:16:25.530
<v 6>And there were tears of love.
And it wasn't love for anybody in particular.</v>

1253
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:27.270
It was just love.

1254
01:16:28.410 --> 01:16:33.410
And then I saw in all the ways that I had closed my heart against love in my

1255
01:16:33.841 --> 01:16:36.170
life and high,

1256
01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:39.940
it'd be trade love in my personal relationship with my spouse and uh,
and,
and,

1257
01:16:39.941 --> 01:16:43.440
and,
and my children and in other ways.
So I just got this

1258
01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:51.100
experience of love as something profound and,
and,
and,
and,

1259
01:16:51.101 --> 01:16:54.960
and universal and,
and a life defining.

1260
01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:57.920
But something for my just being cut off in so many ways.

1261
01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:04.020
<v 9>And I got it
because</v>

1262
01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:09.860
<v 6>I closed my heart against love besides,
because when I was vulnerable,
small,</v>

1263
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:13.430
I'd be so hurt.
I went to my mother's states of mind.

1264
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:17.300
She couldn't respond to me when I need it to be responded to.
Not Her fault,

1265
01:17:17.301 --> 01:17:20.240
but she couldn't.
And then when I was a year old,

1266
01:17:20.241 --> 01:17:24.080
she gave me to a stranger to save my life.
And I didn't see her for a month,

1267
01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:28.400
which is a huge,
explain that for a second.
The slogan is Budapest,
Hungary,

1268
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:31.650
Second World War January,
the Russians are,

1269
01:17:31.651 --> 01:17:36.350
I've circled Budapest and on our fighting,
the Germans,

1270
01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:40.310
the government in is a right wing fascist,
antisemitic

1271
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:46.760
military force.
And even though the depredations of Jews had stopped,

1272
01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.950
the German sit down,
I laid,
had half a minute and hunger.

1273
01:17:48.951 --> 01:17:50.390
Andrew was in three or four months,

1274
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:55.640
but now the Hungarian fascist for killing Jews in Budapest and including in the

1275
01:17:55.641 --> 01:17:56.960
house where my mother and I were living.

1276
01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.480
So my mother gave me through a stranger in the street acquistion woman,

1277
01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:03.860
cause she didn't know she'd be dead or alive next day or that I would be,

1278
01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:06.800
and I was quite sick.
So I didn't see her for a month,

1279
01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:09.920
which I experienced is a deep abandonment halls could expense it.

1280
01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:15.670
So my heart's closes against love and uh,

1281
01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:20.570
I got all this.
And so I got that.
If this plant,

1282
01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:25.660
this plant that as you say and manifest the mind can show me both the ways in

1283
01:18:26.481 --> 01:18:31.481
which I've closed off from myself and that I don't need to because the love is

1284
01:18:31.641 --> 01:18:36.170
still there.
What healing potential it has.
No,

1285
01:18:36.171 --> 01:18:38.120
I wish I could say that after that experience,

1286
01:18:38.121 --> 01:18:42.240
I became a loving husband and our loving her and being,
I didn't,
uh,

1287
01:18:42.241 --> 01:18:47.070
it's not that simple as my wife could tell you.
Uh,

1288
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:51.500
nevertheless,
it opened the door for me and I got right away.
Now.

1289
01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:56.720
However,
the thought that I had was that I had no induction.

1290
01:18:56.721 --> 01:18:59.300
I had had no introduction,
I had no processing afterwards.

1291
01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:06.260
Iosco is a medicine or plant that has been used in the Amazon basin for hundreds

1292
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:10.160
of years,
maybe longer in its cultural context,

1293
01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:14.960
in a tribe in the village where people know each other,

1294
01:19:14.961 --> 01:19:17.930
where they know the Shama and where they share the same assumptions in the same

1295
01:19:17.931 --> 01:19:21.120
history.
That's not the same as a bunch of Westerners,

1296
01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.870
strangers to each other come together for one night drinking and stuff and then

1297
01:19:23.871 --> 01:19:24.920
going their separate ways.

1298
01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:30.020
So immediately the question that came up for me,

1299
01:19:30.021 --> 01:19:34.940
it was how can we create a setting that at least resembles as best you can,

1300
01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:38.360
um,
fashion the original setting.

1301
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:42.020
So we came up with the idea of where we treat,

1302
01:19:42.021 --> 01:19:47.021
where a small number of people get together with properly chain Schamens who

1303
01:19:48.051 --> 01:19:53.051
have integrity and experience deep experience and with me facilitating people's

1304
01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.890
preparation and their post ceremony integration.

1305
01:19:58.470 --> 01:20:03.470
And so I've been doing that now for 10 years and a lot of learning involved,

1306
01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:07.070
you made mistakes,
but it evolved.

1307
01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:10.970
And the essence of it is that people don't come into it cold.

1308
01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:15.780
They come into the preparation in a safe setting where pretty soon a group

1309
01:20:15.781 --> 01:20:17.190
becomes a family to each other,

1310
01:20:17.191 --> 01:20:20.670
which means that none of that they love each other and support each other,

1311
01:20:20.671 --> 01:20:25.200
but they also trigger each other.
I mean,
I may basically,
I tell people,

1312
01:20:25.650 --> 01:20:26.251
I guess what,

1313
01:20:26.251 --> 01:20:29.400
you're back in your family of origin and everything you've hated about your

1314
01:20:29.401 --> 01:20:30.810
feeling urgent just going to show up here,

1315
01:20:31.170 --> 01:20:33.940
but in the context where it's safe for that to happen.
Right?

1316
01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:37.320
And so I've seen lots of great healing.

1317
01:20:37.321 --> 01:20:40.740
I've had people with multiple suicide attempts heal from depression.

1318
01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:45.570
I've seen people get much better with the autoimmune diseases.
I've seen,
uh,

1319
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:48.990
people deal with all kinds of addictions and,
and,
and life issues,

1320
01:20:48.991 --> 01:20:51.880
relationship problems come out of it,
much more themselves,

1321
01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:56.850
much more able to deal with these issues so long as the proper integration is

1322
01:20:56.851 --> 01:21:01.810
done afterwards.
So that was my personal experience.
No.
That then,
um,

1323
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:05.590
introduced me to the whole world of psychedelics and I realized the,

1324
01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:10.430
there's a lot of research being done these days.
There's this organization,
uh,

1325
01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:15.270
maps,
multidisciplinary Associated Association for Psychedelic Studies,

1326
01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:21.000
which is a group of psychologists,
psychiatrists and medical doctors,

1327
01:21:21.001 --> 01:21:22.830
therapists,
counselors,
uh,

1328
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:27.450
interested people to study scientifically,
uh,

1329
01:21:27.451 --> 01:21:31.050
the role of psychedelics and healing.
And as you're probably aware,

1330
01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:34.620
interesting studies have been done around psilocybin mushrooms and endo life

1331
01:21:34.621 --> 01:21:37.320
anxiety studies had been done,

1332
01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:41.670
which are revolutionary and using MDME assisted psychotherapy,

1333
01:21:41.671 --> 01:21:45.720
MDME being the medical name for a technical name for ecstasy,

1334
01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:49.080
again,
in the right setting with the right leadership,

1335
01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:52.560
these have proven to be very powerful modalities of healing.

1336
01:21:52.590 --> 01:21:56.620
And so there's a whole new resurgence of psychedelic research,
uh,

1337
01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:59.190
in a number of different areas.
Some of them manmade,

1338
01:21:59.220 --> 01:22:01.600
some of them are plant based.
Um,

1339
01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:05.310
but there's a whole world that I was introduced to and uh,

1340
01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:09.570
I've learned a lot in the last 10 years.
And,
uh,
again,
I,
uh,

1341
01:22:10.230 --> 01:22:13.970
both practice it in my own healing work and,
um,

1342
01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:16.590
I'm interested in it also as a participant.

1343
01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:23.560
<v 0>I'd love to add a few things to your second comment and then ask a bunch of</v>

1344
01:22:23.561 --> 01:22:24.990
questions about the first.
Yeah.

1345
01:22:25.170 --> 01:22:30.170
So for people who are interested in learning more about the current scientific

1346
01:22:31.391 --> 01:22:36.391
studies and mechanisms of action related to some of these compounds and what is

1347
01:22:37.961 --> 01:22:41.260
being done,
there are a number of

1348
01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:47.650
very interesting and a very competent organizations as far as I can tell.

1349
01:22:48.190 --> 01:22:51.020
Maps is one that you mentioned and I'll actually be seeing,
uh,

1350
01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:53.380
the founder Rick Doblin in just a few days time.

1351
01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:57.290
There is the halftime institute.
Yes.

1352
01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:02.460
Which I've worked with primarily run by MDS and PhDs or at least the board and

1353
01:23:02.531 --> 01:23:06.730
so on is comprised of of scientists,
medical doctors.
Uh,

1354
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.010
it was through the Hafter foundation and also directly with Johns Hopkins.

1355
01:23:10.011 --> 01:23:13.150
So I've had some involvement with the [inaudible] with psilocybin studies.

1356
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:17.730
And actually thank you too many of you serve at smacking the mic.

1357
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:21.600
Too many of you in my audience who helped through a crowdfunding funding

1358
01:23:21.601 --> 01:23:25.650
campaign to raise funds for a study at Johns Hopkins related to a treatment,

1359
01:23:25.710 --> 01:23:30.000
a treatment resistant depression until seven.
So after institute,

1360
01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:35.100
excellent organised organization to look into.
And then you sona also,

1361
01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:38.220
uh,
which I believe is primarily focused on Psilocybin,

1362
01:23:38.221 --> 01:23:41.790
whereas maps at this point has done great work on many levels,

1363
01:23:41.791 --> 01:23:46.791
including helping to facilitate MTMA being designated a breakthrough therapy and

1364
01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:53.340
effectively getting fast tracked into phase three trials.
The FDA.
That's right.

1365
01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:53.880
Yeah.

1366
01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:58.880
And these are all organizations that I would encourage people to look into a,

1367
01:23:59.101 --> 01:23:59.934
and

1368
01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:06.860
it's really an exciting time and also a fragile time as it relates to these

1369
01:24:07.381 --> 01:24:11.850
compounds,
which have certainly demonstrated historically,
uh,

1370
01:24:11.851 --> 01:24:15.360
accepting Mtma.
Let's just look at the studies.

1371
01:24:15.361 --> 01:24:19.020
Many of which were done starting and say 50s and 60s,

1372
01:24:20.370 --> 01:24:25.080
looking at the clinical efficacy of using these compounds for everything ranging

1373
01:24:25.081 --> 01:24:29.190
from alcoholism to nicotine addiction to many of the things that you mentioned

1374
01:24:29.530 --> 01:24:32.560
<v 6>brought your daughter what is little known,
but a Bill Wilson,</v>

1375
01:24:32.561 --> 01:24:36.120
Dr Bill who founded one of the funders of Aa,
right.

1376
01:24:36.690 --> 01:24:41.500
Actually had some powerful LSD experiences.
Yeah.
Um,
and which helped him in his,

1377
01:24:41.501 --> 01:24:46.390
in his spiritual growth is an aide.
I don't talk about that very much,

1378
01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:47.650
but it's a fact,

1379
01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:53.460
if I may parenthetically say as much as I support the 12 steps with a also

1380
01:24:54.491 --> 01:24:57.400
doesn't tend to talk about is the trauma that first causes the addiction.

1381
01:24:57.401 --> 01:24:59.500
And Bill Wilson himself was a traumatized child.

1382
01:24:59.950 --> 01:25:01.990
He was abandoned by his parents and he was very young.

1383
01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:05.830
And so it's interesting that a,

1384
01:25:05.831 --> 01:25:08.500
for all the good work that it does do,
which I support,

1385
01:25:08.501 --> 01:25:11.410
I don't support people being forced into any spit to go from the treatment.

1386
01:25:11.411 --> 01:25:15.490
But as a self chosen form of treatment,
it can be very helpful to many people,

1387
01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:19.270
but they don't talk about two very interesting things,
which is,

1388
01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:21.790
when is the SEC Delyth part and the other is the Toronto part.

1389
01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:23.770
<v 0>Yeah.
It's</v>

1390
01:25:26.710 --> 01:25:31.710
for me just looking at my own childhood experiences and uh,

1391
01:25:34.450 --> 01:25:39.010
exploring recovery defined as you define it in,
in the last several years,

1392
01:25:39.011 --> 01:25:40.300
especially in last six months,

1393
01:25:40.810 --> 01:25:45.810
it's been a fascinating and frustrating to discover and try to piece together

1394
01:25:46.511 --> 01:25:50.920
these various elements.
Uh,
but the,

1395
01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:54.860
uh,
what is the frustrating part?

1396
01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:01.630
That there is a,
well there may,
it may exist,

1397
01:26:01.631 --> 01:26:04.410
but I couldn't find one stop shopping that checked all the boxes.
Right.

1398
01:26:04.411 --> 01:26:06.970
So they end any,
right.
So,
so it's,

1399
01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:12.240
it's been an exercise in collecting various tools and piecing them together.

1400
01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:16.290
Like you said,
you have the AIA does incredible work and then they,

1401
01:26:16.490 --> 01:26:20.120
what they've done in terms of a distributed free service with social

1402
01:26:20.121 --> 01:26:24.050
accountability and support is incredible.
Absolutely.
Uh,

1403
01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:29.040
the psychedelic component,
which bill actually wanted to as I understand it,

1404
01:26:29.070 --> 01:26:31.910
make one of the steps in a,
uh,
needless to say,

1405
01:26:31.911 --> 01:26:35.150
it was hard to get widespread leadership support for that.
Uh,

1406
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:36.620
and then you have the trauma piece.

1407
01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:41.650
So these are all tools in the toolkit that people can use for their own sort of

1408
01:26:41.991 --> 01:26:44.570
be spoke approach in some respects.

1409
01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:48.070
Coming back to the IOWASCA specifically,
and I,

1410
01:26:48.071 --> 01:26:52.430
and I should just as a caveat point out because I do think that these tools,

1411
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:54.320
I know these tools are very powerful.

1412
01:26:54.321 --> 01:26:58.500
I have firsthand familiarity from past experiences and,
uh,
have,

1413
01:26:58.970 --> 01:27:03.650
have been very engaged with this scientific community for some time now they can

1414
01:27:03.651 --> 01:27:08.070
be misused.
Uh,
there are many charlatans.
Uh,

1415
01:27:08.190 --> 01:27:12.230
<v 1>unfortunately there's more than,
there's many.
There's some very powerful healers,</v>

1416
01:27:12.231 --> 01:27:16.730
Shamans who unfortunately exploit people sexually and financial,
very common.

1417
01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:21.070
And this is of course not just restricted to the Iosco rolled a,

1418
01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.880
it's also happens in the spiritual world.

1419
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:25.910
How many spiritual leaders with tremendous power,

1420
01:27:25.911 --> 01:27:30.911
tremendous healing influence of at the same time exploited men and women and

1421
01:27:31.131 --> 01:27:34.850
created all kinds of,
uh,
um,
further trauma.

1422
01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:37.160
So unfortunately,

1423
01:27:37.161 --> 01:27:40.880
when you have that much power and you haven't totally done your integration
work,

1424
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:43.580
you can start misusing using that power.

1425
01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:46.910
And that happens in all of the healing modalities as we know,

1426
01:27:47.210 --> 01:27:49.130
but it certainly happens in the psychedelic world as well.

1427
01:27:49.390 --> 01:27:54.320
<v 0>Yep.
It's very,
it's,
uh,
I wish I could say it's rare.
It's not a,</v>

1428
01:27:54.490 --> 01:27:57.640
but it's something to safeguard against,

1429
01:27:57.670 --> 01:27:59.230
especially when you're in that vulnerable state.

1430
01:27:59.231 --> 01:28:02.650
So I would actually recommend that people see a documentary called Kumaré,

1431
01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:06.180
which he is very much worth watching.
And,
um,

1432
01:28:06.850 --> 01:28:11.850
the brief overview is it's an Indian filmmaker who begins studying various gurus

1433
01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:19.660
and healers in the u s uh,
in,

1434
01:28:19.661 --> 01:28:21.160
in hopes of,

1435
01:28:21.370 --> 01:28:26.370
I believe the original impetus was to simply do a documentary on charlatans.

1436
01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:29.410
And then he went to India and he said,
they're just as bad here.

1437
01:28:29.411 --> 01:28:32.380
And he said 99% are just as bad or worse.

1438
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:37.570
And he decides to make himself a guru as a,
as an experiment.

1439
01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:41.970
And it's,
it's a very thought provoking documentary that I think will,
should,

1440
01:28:41.971 --> 01:28:43.840
it becomes a kind of fake guru,
right?
That's right.

1441
01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:47.470
And remember then he unveils it.
Yeah.
I don't want to give too much away,

1442
01:28:47.471 --> 01:28:50.740
but it's very well done.
Very worth watching because it helps to prepare you,

1443
01:28:50.741 --> 01:28:53.560
I think psychologically too,
uh,

1444
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:57.700
not lose yourself in a dangerous way.

1445
01:28:58.180 --> 01:28:59.060
<v 1>And here's the problem.</v>

1446
01:28:59.061 --> 01:29:02.170
You see what I said about the essence of trauma is that you

1447
01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:03.840
<v 6>use,
you lose connection to yourself.</v>

1448
01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:07.830
And that means you lose connection to your gut feelings,
right?

1449
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:10.770
As long as you've got fillings out with you and you honor them,

1450
01:29:10.771 --> 01:29:14.130
they'll protect you.
But the very essence of trauma is the loss of that,

1451
01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:17.790
which means that when you lose connection to the gut feelings,

1452
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:20.370
then you're very vulnerable to being exploited.

1453
01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:25.020
And when you talk to people who were exploited in any context,

1454
01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:28.020
psychedelic or not,
if you ask them,

1455
01:29:28.021 --> 01:29:31.760
do you have any kind of vague sense that this is not quite right,
they'll say,

1456
01:29:31.761 --> 01:29:34.230
yeah,
but I didn't listen to it.

1457
01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:38.370
And the fact that they didn't listen to it is already a marker of trauma.

1458
01:29:38.850 --> 01:29:43.230
So since it's traumatized people,
which is most of us who seek healing,

1459
01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:46.710
it's also vulnerable people who seek healing.

1460
01:29:47.190 --> 01:29:51.340
And this is what some of these people can exploit.
Um,

1461
01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:54.210
so the very portal into healing,

1462
01:29:54.211 --> 01:29:58.380
which is opening up the vulnerability that we've shut down against,

1463
01:29:58.830 --> 01:30:02.910
is also the portal for potential laws.
So people have to do their due diligence.

1464
01:30:03.570 --> 01:30:07.380
And I'm not trying to create paranoia here,
but people just should be careful.

1465
01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.810
<v 0>You just mentioned something that I,</v>

1466
01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:14.140
I'd really love to just pause and emphasize.
Uh,

1467
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:17.150
you mentioned a few things.
So number one is that,

1468
01:30:17.250 --> 01:30:22.250
or your gut feeling slash physiological intuition can help you.

1469
01:30:25.990 --> 01:30:26.420
Uh,

1470
01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:31.420
and that's something that for many reasons I completely muted or ignored for a

1471
01:30:32.781 --> 01:30:35.690
very long time.
So it's been a process of getting reacquainted with that.

1472
01:30:35.691 --> 01:30:40.100
And I would say two things that,
uh,
that I've found helpful.

1473
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:43.930
And if you have any comments on second in particular,
I'd love,
love to hear.

1474
01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:47.420
One was dramatically decreasing my caffeine intake,

1475
01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:51.260
which I found was almost like turning up the volume on static.

1476
01:30:51.290 --> 01:30:55.820
It made it very difficult for me to read or feel that's of their things.
That's,

1477
01:30:56.210 --> 01:30:59.480
I was using it,
uh,
maybe for many reasons,

1478
01:30:59.481 --> 01:31:01.550
but it had the side effect at least of muting.

1479
01:31:01.551 --> 01:31:04.990
Maybe that was why I did it subconsciously.
Many of these feelings.
Uh,

1480
01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:07.010
the second was,
um,

1481
01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:11.030
in fact a video that was recommended to me,
but it,

1482
01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:15.570
it corresponds to a book called the gift of fear by Gavin de Becker.
Uh,

1483
01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:18.880
and who actually owns a company that,
uh,

1484
01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:22.850
does protective services and executive security.

1485
01:31:22.851 --> 01:31:24.440
So you have to keep in mind,

1486
01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:27.770
maybe you don't always want to ask a barber if you need a haircut.

1487
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:31.320
So keeping that in mind.
Uh,
it,

1488
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:36.350
it also in brief points to the benefits of some of these

1489
01:31:39.650 --> 01:31:44.020
reactions are emotional states that we are prone to labeling negative.
Yeah.

1490
01:31:44.530 --> 01:31:47.210
Uh,
and,
uh,
the,

1491
01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:51.200
as you said,
not to make anyone paranoid,

1492
01:31:51.201 --> 01:31:56.120
but rather to inform them these are currently,

1493
01:31:56.690 --> 01:31:58.130
uh,
existing risks.

1494
01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:01.810
And one of the hopes certainly with say,

1495
01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:07.180
ultimately better researching these compounds after they've been,

1496
01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:10.990
uh,
really unfairly but for understandable reasons,

1497
01:32:10.991 --> 01:32:15.880
politicized and put into the same schedule in the United States is heroin and

1498
01:32:15.881 --> 01:32:20.881
cocaine to have them rescheduled so that they're prescribable if then that

1499
01:32:21.251 --> 01:32:22.084
happens,

1500
01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:27.570
the ability to certify therapists to regulate and to maintain a broad type

1501
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:33.310
quality control goes up.

1502
01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:38.340
So that's also one of the hopes is that that will decrease the likelihood of bad

1503
01:32:39.671 --> 01:32:44.020
actors,
uh,
and allow appropriate punishment for bad actors.

1504
01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:45.430
<v 1>It's you,
as we know,</v>

1505
01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:50.500
even in legalized legitimate professions still happens.

1506
01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:53.090
This stuff happens.
It's still on.
It's still ultimately,
you know,

1507
01:32:54.990 --> 01:32:56.830
gut feelings are still the best response.

1508
01:32:56.831 --> 01:33:01.780
And let me address first why we shut down our good feelings,
if I may please.

1509
01:33:02.170 --> 01:33:03.003
So,

1510
01:33:03.490 --> 01:33:03.930
<v 9>yeah,</v>

1511
01:33:03.930 --> 01:33:08.550
<v 1>a human being has two fundamental needs apart from the physical needs in infancy</v>

1512
01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:10.890
and childhood.
One is for attachment,

1513
01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:16.540
not attachment is the closeness and proximity with another human being for the

1514
01:33:16.621 --> 01:33:21.621
sake of being looked after or for the sake of looking after the other human

1515
01:33:22.321 --> 01:33:25.110
beings as mammals and even birds.

1516
01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:26.090
<v 9>Oh,</v>

1517
01:33:26.090 --> 01:33:27.290
<v 1>are creatures of attachment.</v>

1518
01:33:27.291 --> 01:33:30.200
We have to connect and attach because otherwise we don't survive.

1519
01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:34.640
If there's nobody that's motivated to take care of us to attach to us that way,

1520
01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:39.260
and we if not motivated to attached to others,
we just can't survive.

1521
01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:41.420
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1522
01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:44.520
<v 1>One it is,
and the thing is,
is that the endorphins which,
um,</v>

1523
01:33:44.650 --> 01:33:48.310
at the end of the body's internal opiate and make,
uh,
chemicals,

1524
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:51.820
which heroin and all the other opiates of resemble,

1525
01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:53.253
<v 9>okay.</v>

1526
01:33:53.570 --> 01:33:55.040
<v 1>They helped to facilitate attachment.</v>

1527
01:33:56.540 --> 01:34:00.680
So if you think infant mice and you're not out their endorphin receptors,

1528
01:34:00.681 --> 01:34:03.980
so they don't have endorphin opiate activity in their brain,

1529
01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:07.880
they won't cry for help and separated from their mothers Bushman me that they

1530
01:34:07.881 --> 01:34:08.990
would die in the wild.

1531
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:13.370
And which goes back to what happens in early and chart to the,

1532
01:34:13.371 --> 01:34:17.990
when there's stress and trauma,
these,
uh,
these endorphins systems don't develop.

1533
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:21.710
And then when people do heroin,
it feels like a warm,
soft hug to them.

1534
01:34:21.711 --> 01:34:25.220
They feel love and connection for the first time.
That's why it's so powerful.

1535
01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:27.220
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1536
01:34:27.220 --> 01:34:31.420
<v 1>But so we had this need for attachment without which obviously the human infant</v>

1537
01:34:31.421 --> 01:34:33.280
was the most hopeless,
the most dependent,

1538
01:34:33.281 --> 01:34:36.700
at least mature of any creature in the universe at birth.
Uh,

1539
01:34:38.150 --> 01:34:38.610
<v 9>yeah.</v>

1540
01:34:38.610 --> 01:34:42.040
<v 1>You cannot survive without the attachment and that attachment relationship,</v>

1541
01:34:42.041 --> 01:34:45.600
given that we have the longest period of development of any creature you know

1542
01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:48.670
well into adolescence and beyond.

1543
01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:51.073
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1544
01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:52.860
<v 1>Attachment is not a negotiable need.</v>

1545
01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:55.820
<v 9>Okay?</v>

1546
01:34:55.820 --> 01:34:56.870
<v 1>But we have another need which is</v>

1547
01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:01.670
<v 6>authenticity.
Alto,
the self means being connected to ourselves,</v>

1548
01:35:01.970 --> 01:35:04.130
just knowing what we feel and being able to act on it.

1549
01:35:05.150 --> 01:35:07.100
So that means I've got feelings.

1550
01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:12.410
So let's look at a human beings evolved for hundreds of thousands of years and

1551
01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:15.620
forth.
A hundred thousand years or so of this species existing on earth.

1552
01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:19.580
How did we live?
We didn't live in cities and houses.
And so on.

1553
01:35:19.581 --> 01:35:24.581
We lived out there in the wild until very recently in human existence.

1554
01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:26.520
Now just hold on.

1555
01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:29.810
Do you survive in the wild if you're not connected to your gut feelings?

1556
01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:31.610
Not Very Long.
Not Very Long.

1557
01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:34.160
If you start using your intellect instead of your gut feelings,

1558
01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:36.520
you just don't survive.
Yeah,

1559
01:35:37.730 --> 01:35:41.420
so that's a powerful survival need as well as the attachment is a survival need.

1560
01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:43.130
Authenticity is a survival need.

1561
01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:47.990
But what happens if your authenticity threatened is your attachment

1562
01:35:47.991 --> 01:35:51.620
relationships,
for example,
is a two year old.

1563
01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:53.930
You get angry because you didn't get that cookie before dinner,

1564
01:35:55.970 --> 01:35:59.270
but your parents can't handle anger cause they grew up in homes when there was

1565
01:35:59.271 --> 01:36:02.450
rage,
a holism and they're terrified at the very expression of anger.

1566
01:36:02.690 --> 01:36:05.780
So they give you the message that good a little kids don't get angry.

1567
01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:09.440
The message you receive is not that good.
Look is don't get angry,

1568
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:13.240
but the angry little kids don't get loved cause your parents are not salon.

1569
01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:15.980
They won't look at you.
They talk to you in a harsh way.
You're not getting loved,

1570
01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:21.170
not experiencing love at that moment now,
but you've got to stay attached.

1571
01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:25.790
Guess what?
You're going to suppress the authenticity every time.

1572
01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:28.750
And this is hubby lose connection to ourselves and to our gut feelings.

1573
01:36:28.751 --> 01:36:31.490
So that strangely enough,
that very dynamic,

1574
01:36:31.491 --> 01:36:34.340
which is essential for human survival in a natural setting,

1575
01:36:35.070 --> 01:36:39.560
not becomes a threat to our survival in this,
in this more modern setting,

1576
01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:42.650
we have to stay authentic,
is to threaten attachment.

1577
01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:46.070
And so we give up our authenticity and then we wonder who the hell of you are

1578
01:36:46.130 --> 01:36:51.130
and whose life is this and who's experiencing all this and this life doesn't see

1579
01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:55.160
know,
and who am I really?
And so that's where the reconnection has to happen.

1580
01:36:55.161 --> 01:36:57.290
That's where the healing happens is that that reconnection,

1581
01:36:58.130 --> 01:37:01.250
but it's because of that conflict,

1582
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:05.360
that tragic conflict in childhood between authenticity and attachment that most

1583
01:37:05.361 --> 01:37:08.750
of us face,
that we lose ourselves and lose connection to her gut feelings.

1584
01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:14.790
<v 0>There's so many directions we could go with this.
Uh,</v>

1585
01:37:15.180 --> 01:37:19.230
and I'm really glad you shared that because that had an enormous,

1586
01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:24.300
that observation has had an enormous impact on,
on some of my close friends.

1587
01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:29.380
And that's something I was only exposed to really today because,
uh,

1588
01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:32.910
our mutual friend Vicky recommended that I ask you to expand on it.

1589
01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:36.030
What I'd love to return to if we can,

1590
01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:38.010
<v 6>can I say something?
Yeah,
of course.
Sorry.</v>

1591
01:37:39.150 --> 01:37:41.670
In this building does a picture of Elvis Presley.
Yes.

1592
01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:44.390
So there's a song of his that I play at my retreats or,

1593
01:37:44.391 --> 01:37:47.310
and my events all the time.
It's called.
Anyway,

1594
01:37:47.311 --> 01:37:51.840
you'll love me no matter how it goes.
I don't like actually played for you,

1595
01:37:51.841 --> 01:37:56.280
but it goes anyway.
You love me.
That's the way I'll be,
uh,
in your hands.

1596
01:37:56.281 --> 01:38:00.030
My heart is clay.
I'll be strong as a mountain or a week as a

1597
01:38:01.650 --> 01:38:05.100
willow tree.
Avi.
Powerful.

1598
01:38:05.101 --> 01:38:10.020
I'll be like a little baby any way you want me.
That's how I will be now.

1599
01:38:10.021 --> 01:38:12.900
That's considered a love song.
It isn't.
It's a lack of loss song.

1600
01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:18.320
It's a song that says chest attached to me.
I'll give up anything about myself.

1601
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:20.640
Just accept me the way you want me to be.

1602
01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:24.000
So if it's a sad song and when you hear him sing it,

1603
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:29.390
this deep sadness in it and some of the power of Presley as she came from his

1604
01:38:29.791 --> 01:38:32.700
own suffering,
he wasn't just singing a song,

1605
01:38:32.701 --> 01:38:36.270
he was actually infusing it with all the emotions of loss.

1606
01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:39.210
So even though it's presented like a love song,

1607
01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:41.490
it's actually a song about the loss of love.

1608
01:38:41.491 --> 01:38:46.380
And that's the situation of the infant who says,
just love me.

1609
01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:50.430
I'll be anything you want me to be.
And that's the,
uh,

1610
01:38:50.490 --> 01:38:54.700
that's the tragic conflict isn't an attachment and authenticity to see.
Yeah.

1611
01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:57.700
<v 0>So this ties into exactly where I was going.
Uh,</v>

1612
01:38:58.590 --> 01:39:03.590
which is related to your pre and post work with psychedelics.

1613
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:09.630
Yeah.
And for people who are watching this or listening to it,

1614
01:39:10.590 --> 01:39:14.130
I'm returning to this,
not because I want to hammer home psychedelics.

1615
01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:18.920
They're not for everyone.
And in my experience,
the vast majority are,

1616
01:39:18.930 --> 01:39:21.390
should say in my observation,

1617
01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:25.140
the vast majority of psychedelic use is very irresponsible.
Uh,
and,

1618
01:39:25.141 --> 01:39:27.690
and I would not recommend,
uh,
because

1619
01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:30.510
it can,

1620
01:39:30.510 --> 01:39:35.250
it can certainly cause a good amount of harm if not done in a supervised safe

1621
01:39:35.730 --> 01:39:38.910
fashion.
But the pre and post work

1622
01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:40.950
<v 7>okay.</v>

1623
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:45.660
<v 0>Could apply to many modalities.
I mean it,
it does in this case,</v>

1624
01:39:45.661 --> 01:39:49.620
this example that we're about to talk about apply to psychedelics,
but it could,

1625
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:51.080
<v 7>yeah,</v>

1626
01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:51.891
<v 0>and correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

1627
01:39:51.891 --> 01:39:56.810
but it seems like it could very easily apply to going into any intense or

1628
01:39:56.811 --> 01:39:58.490
unusual modality.
Oh,

1629
01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:03.110
like VIP pass and I'm pushing the pasta like this date with destiny,

1630
01:40:03.111 --> 01:40:07.220
Tony Robbins,
I,
I mentioned,
which is certainly intense and very,
very different.

1631
01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:11.030
Very powerful.
That's why I'm coming back to this.
Uh,

1632
01:40:11.070 --> 01:40:15.260
but we can discuss it as it applies specifically to psychedelics and even

1633
01:40:15.261 --> 01:40:19.470
specifically to Iowasca if that is the primary,
uh,

1634
01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:23.030
that's the primary compound we're talking about,

1635
01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:28.290
which is really just for people who are wondering.
It's a,
one of the reasons I,

1636
01:40:28.291 --> 01:40:33.291
Alaska is really tricky is that it is unlike say,

1637
01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:36.890
I'm going to get off topic for a second,
but it's still on topic.

1638
01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:40.270
It's not quite like,
uh,

1639
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:42.710
mushrooms.

1640
01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:47.720
And what people consider the primary psychoactive molecule of psilocybin.

1641
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:49.640
It's a bit different.
It's more of an old fashioned,

1642
01:40:49.641 --> 01:40:51.800
it's like if you go to a bar and you order a vodka soda,

1643
01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:55.210
pretty much everywhere you go.
And Soda.
Yeah,
very similar.
Yeah.

1644
01:40:55.211 --> 01:40:59.710
Assuming the poor is the same.
Yeah.
Iowaska is more like an old fashioned.

1645
01:40:59.750 --> 01:41:03.640
There are few ingredients that are almost always there.

1646
01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:08.670
So if you go to,
let's say I want to say God bow or other parts of Bidu,

1647
01:41:08.671 --> 01:41:13.460
it's going to be mostly the Ios SCA vine plus a plant called Chacruna.
Yeah.

1648
01:41:13.570 --> 01:41:17.730
Or a psychiatry.
A vdd switch is a DMT I think.
Guess,

1649
01:41:17.731 --> 01:41:20.890
suppose it must be nn DMT campaign,
uh,
containing plant,

1650
01:41:20.891 --> 01:41:25.120
which is made orally active through the Maa oh inhibitors.

1651
01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:27.730
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors in the vine.

1652
01:41:28.090 --> 01:41:32.700
How they figured that out is a whole separate story,
which is kind of wild.
Uh,

1653
01:41:32.770 --> 01:41:34.600
the plants told them is the short version.

1654
01:41:34.850 --> 01:41:35.181
<v 6>I know,</v>

1655
01:41:35.181 --> 01:41:39.620
although I have a science scientific fan who gave me a starting these simple

1656
01:41:39.621 --> 01:41:41.210
explanation,
which,
oh,
okay,

1657
01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:43.960
well let's actually makes more sense to the western mind.
What is it?

1658
01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:46.400
When I was improved,
they also told me the plants told us,

1659
01:41:46.401 --> 01:41:49.890
which on some level accept.
But,

1660
01:41:49.891 --> 01:41:52.750
but I just want to say something here because we're talking in an extended way

1661
01:41:52.751 --> 01:41:53.710
about the psychedelics.

1662
01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:57.040
I don't quit the impression that this is most of my life or work.
It isn't.

1663
01:41:57.100 --> 01:42:00.130
I do this stuff one or two or three weeks a year.

1664
01:42:00.730 --> 01:42:03.310
So it's not like the major part of what I do.

1665
01:42:03.311 --> 01:42:06.790
But it is a very interesting part because it illuminates everything else that I

1666
01:42:06.791 --> 01:42:11.730
do.
Uh,
in a sense that it goes very deep.
Now,
this scientific friend,

1667
01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:15.040
when the science friend of mine says,
actually they were,

1668
01:42:15.730 --> 01:42:18.610
let's say using the ios going,
boiling it up,

1669
01:42:18.611 --> 01:42:20.050
because I have a square itself though.

1670
01:42:20.051 --> 01:42:24.790
The vine has some secondary private and on its own without the Chacruna.
Yeah.

1671
01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:27.700
Very strong auditory.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1672
01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:31.480
So then what happens is some leafs of sugar Buena Fall into it.

1673
01:42:31.830 --> 01:42:32.663
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

1674
01:42:33.110 --> 01:42:35.660
<v 6>Inevitably overheads of years that's going to happen,
they say,
oh,</v>

1675
01:42:35.661 --> 01:42:38.360
well this combination is even more powerful.

1676
01:42:38.810 --> 01:42:42.620
So it need not be as esoteric as it could have been.

1677
01:42:42.621 --> 01:42:44.210
A rather simple discovery.

1678
01:42:46.100 --> 01:42:50.000
So who knows what the real story is,
but in any case,

1679
01:42:50.001 --> 01:42:54.440
the preparation and the processing.
So I'm just going to add

1680
01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:56.150
<v 0>to that,
which is,</v>

1681
01:42:56.450 --> 01:43:01.450
that is one combination you then also have in certain regions of,

1682
01:43:02.030 --> 01:43:04.870
and it's found in other places outside of Peru from us,

1683
01:43:04.871 --> 01:43:09.080
certainly in the largest Iowasca as sacrament based churches are actually out of

1684
01:43:09.081 --> 01:43:11.510
Brazil.
Um,
but the,

1685
01:43:12.410 --> 01:43:16.520
it can also be Iowasca vine plus [inaudible],
which is a different plant.

1686
01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:20.060
Also DMT containing,
but a,
a,

1687
01:43:20.061 --> 01:43:23.750
a for some people,
substantially different experience.

1688
01:43:23.970 --> 01:43:28.970
And then the only reason I'm mentioning this is so that people are aware of why

1689
01:43:29.411 --> 01:43:34.411
I am particularly concerned when people are cavalier about,

1690
01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:35.391
hey,

1691
01:43:35.391 --> 01:43:38.330
my friend's ordering some Iowaska from Hawaii and we're gonna put it in a slow

1692
01:43:38.331 --> 01:43:43.070
cooker and have it at his house this weekend.
I'm like,
bad,
bad idea.
Many,

1693
01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:47.350
many centers,
even a well intentioned centers in,

1694
01:43:47.470 --> 01:43:48.303
in Bidu.

1695
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:52.820
We'll also put other things in the brew because they think that want more of x.

1696
01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:57.590
So they'll put coca leaves or put,
so think cocaine,
coca leaves,
they'll put toy,

1697
01:43:57.591 --> 01:44:00.800
which is even,
uh,
the Twitter,

1698
01:44:00.801 --> 01:44:05.400
which is even scarier in some respects.
Coca,
not that scary.
Uh,

1699
01:44:05.810 --> 01:44:09.020
so just be aware that when you say Iowasca not you,

1700
01:44:09.050 --> 01:44:12.890
but when people think ios guide is not a standardized dose that you were getting

1701
01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:17.900
<v 6>the,
I was at a retreat in Costa Rica where really four different nights stayed</v>

1702
01:44:17.901 --> 01:44:20.500
ceremonies in each time with a different concoctions.
Oh God.

1703
01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:25.040
So one night with the Peruvian shoe people tradition,
uh,

1704
01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:29.770
preparation one night with the okay.
From Columbia.
Yeah.
And you know,
it,
it,

1705
01:44:29.771 --> 01:44:34.660
it's who prepares it,
homage.
They bullet for what combination,

1706
01:44:34.690 --> 01:44:38.380
uh,
what intention and so on.
So that's by and large true.

1707
01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:44.110
And really,
um,
the people I've worked with,
the,
you know,

1708
01:44:44.111 --> 01:44:46.960
this is all this,
not that it's always the same drink every night,

1709
01:44:46.990 --> 01:44:48.550
but it's pretty much the same preparation.

1710
01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:53.940
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
And,
uh,
so I,
I took us down a little rabbit hole,</v>

1711
01:44:53.941 --> 01:44:54.774
but the,

1712
01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:58.890
the question I have is with all of your clinical experience in recognizing that

1713
01:44:58.891 --> 01:45:03.350
this is a therapy,
but it's an adjunct therapy,
it's not used in isolation.
Yeah.

1714
01:45:03.390 --> 01:45:08.390
And you've through trial and error and design come to a place now where you have

1715
01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:14.910
maybe certain best practices or approaches to the pre,

1716
01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:17.400
pre and post work.

1717
01:45:17.970 --> 01:45:22.400
Could you tell us about either or both of those are,
you know,

1718
01:45:22.410 --> 01:45:27.220
ideally maybe exercises or questions people could think about it

1719
01:45:29.010 --> 01:45:31.190
on their own.
I know nothing,
it's,

1720
01:45:31.210 --> 01:45:34.890
it's hard to recommend that and isolation perhaps.
But I'd,

1721
01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:36.390
I'd love to hear any,

1722
01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:40.380
any details that you're willing to share about the pre and post because it's so,

1723
01:45:40.381 --> 01:45:45.150
so important to just,
it's hard to,
for me,
at least in my limited experience,

1724
01:45:45.151 --> 01:45:47.040
even to overemphasize

1725
01:45:48.770 --> 01:45:52.780
<v 6>specifically,
um,
we just not the only with ELT I work with,</v>

1726
01:45:52.781 --> 01:45:56.260
but did that specifically,
there's a physical preparation,
for example,

1727
01:45:56.261 --> 01:45:59.200
no caffeine for a period of time.
Uh,

1728
01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:03.380
no red meat cutting down on salt,
um,

1729
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:06.250
uh,
excluding dairy products.

1730
01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:09.600
So there's a physical preparation just to cleanse the body and then to make it

1731
01:46:09.610 --> 01:46:13.010
more receptive to the Ios car.
Um,

1732
01:46:13.390 --> 01:46:15.430
from the emotional and psychological point of view,

1733
01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:19.330
you want somebody to really form an intention what I actually I want or this

1734
01:46:19.331 --> 01:46:20.980
experience because intention is everything.

1735
01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:25.810
So it's not like I'm going to take this stuff and let's see what happens and why

1736
01:46:25.811 --> 01:46:28.590
am I here for why am I coming?
What is my intention and growing there?

1737
01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:30.820
What do I want to find out?
What issues am I working with?

1738
01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:34.140
So intention setting and then,
and really considering

1739
01:46:35.690 --> 01:46:39.080
what is my purpose and undertaking this,
uh,
this experience.

1740
01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:42.233
<v 9>Cool.</v>

1741
01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:45.800
<v 6>When people arrive,
we don't just plunge into ceremony.</v>

1742
01:46:47.190 --> 01:46:52.060
And my Iowa scurry,
we have a day and a half of groups preparation.

1743
01:46:52.061 --> 01:46:54.300
So everybody articulates their intention,

1744
01:46:54.510 --> 01:46:59.510
why they're there and we'll be dk deeply explore how that intention arised a

1745
01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:00.753
rose,
sorry.

1746
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:05.280
And what in their lives brought them to this point and what issues they need to

1747
01:47:05.281 --> 01:47:06.900
deal with.
And

1748
01:47:08.850 --> 01:47:13.500
my way of working is to get people very deeply to their core issues,
uh,

1749
01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:16.860
which they may not be even aware of.
But again,

1750
01:47:16.861 --> 01:47:19.590
to this process I called compassionate inquiry.

1751
01:47:20.050 --> 01:47:23.190
And this is true whether I'm working with plants or not,
they,
they,

1752
01:47:23.191 --> 01:47:28.191
they get to to see what it is that they're really seeking and what are they

1753
01:47:28.711 --> 01:47:31.770
seeking.
They're seeking themselves.
They're seeing the connection ultimately,

1754
01:47:32.190 --> 01:47:34.470
but there's steps that you go through.

1755
01:47:35.550 --> 01:47:39.640
And then we helped them to set a specific intention for that,
uh,

1756
01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:44.550
first ceremony.
And the specific intention is what do I want to learn tonight?

1757
01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:47.880
Not just what I want to learn in general,
but what I'm gonna learn tonight.

1758
01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:49.860
Some people want to learn about,

1759
01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:54.710
tell me about my fear.

1760
01:47:55.590 --> 01:47:56.020
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1761
01:47:56.020 --> 01:47:57.910
<v 6>Uh,
teach me about</v>

1762
01:48:00.450 --> 01:48:05.140
my pain.
Um,
show me what love is.

1763
01:48:06.310 --> 01:48:11.000
Show me what courage is.
Show me what my strength is.
See,

1764
01:48:11.130 --> 01:48:15.340
it's not that the ILS code that comes with an agenda,
uh,
eh,

1765
01:48:15.790 --> 01:48:18.280
it works through you and it manifests,

1766
01:48:18.290 --> 01:48:21.820
was sent you so that your intention,

1767
01:48:21.821 --> 01:48:24.820
the more specific it is to you where you are in life at that moment,

1768
01:48:24.821 --> 01:48:26.890
the more effective it's going to be.

1769
01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:33.220
And then the Sharma's work with you doing a ceremony and they chant to you based

1770
01:48:33.221 --> 01:48:36.580
on what they're picking up from you at that moment.
Uh,

1771
01:48:36.610 --> 01:48:41.590
they work with you on a genetically,
sometimes their work hands on,
uh,

1772
01:48:41.591 --> 01:48:43.510
as well.
And uh,

1773
01:48:44.650 --> 01:48:47.560
you both have your own experience and you share the group energy

1774
01:48:49.330 --> 01:48:54.040
and then people go to sleep and the next day and then the following day,

1775
01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:57.850
we then process,
well,
what happened to you?
What the,
what the visions came to.

1776
01:48:57.851 --> 01:49:02.020
You know,
some people hold the visions,
some people with more prosaic line,

1777
01:49:02.021 --> 01:49:04.520
it's like me.
Well,
all the,
every got divisions.
I,
I,

1778
01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:07.810
I did originally got the vision is,
but it's been years since I've seen anything.

1779
01:49:08.500 --> 01:49:10.980
Uh,
some people will have bought of the experiences.

1780
01:49:10.990 --> 01:49:15.010
Some people go to him in intense emotional states.

1781
01:49:15.810 --> 01:49:18.920
Uh,
which in my view are always a memories of,

1782
01:49:18.921 --> 01:49:22.390
of maybe forgotten memories,

1783
01:49:22.391 --> 01:49:27.310
but in dwelling memories of,
of very early experiences,
intense.

1784
01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:31.840
Some people have beautiful entities coming and teaching them,
you know,

1785
01:49:31.841 --> 01:49:35.890
jaguars and anacondas or various angelic entity is,

1786
01:49:35.891 --> 01:49:39.610
I've never been blessed with that.
Then,
uh,
I used to get frustrated,

1787
01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:43.330
but actually whatever experience you have,
that's the expense you need to have.

1788
01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:47.980
And,
and for me it's not about the visions or it's about what is

1789
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:50.230
<v 1>the teaching and the teaching is always there.</v>

1790
01:49:50.590 --> 01:49:54.790
And the purpose of the processing is to help you find the teaching that was

1791
01:49:54.791 --> 01:49:57.670
important to you by whatever experience you had.

1792
01:49:57.790 --> 01:50:02.300
Not about comparing your experience to the night before or two nights before or

1793
01:50:02.301 --> 01:50:05.200
to the experience of other people.
It's your specific experience.

1794
01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:06.640
What does it mean in your life?

1795
01:50:07.210 --> 01:50:11.650
So this is post a retreat then,

1796
01:50:11.710 --> 01:50:14.450
uh,
again,
um,

1797
01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:19.660
whether you do a program like the past and would you do the landmark forum or

1798
01:50:19.661 --> 01:50:23.380
whether you to do a Hoffman process or whether you do any kind of

1799
01:50:23.381 --> 01:50:26.320
transformational work or a meditation retreat.

1800
01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:30.370
If you don't integrate what you've learned into your life and you build up some

1801
01:50:30.371 --> 01:50:33.580
practice around it,
it's gonna become a memory,
a nice memory

1802
01:50:33.850 --> 01:50:35.540
<v 0>lab best,
right?
Yeah.</v>

1803
01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:41.160
Straight back into making hypercritical decisions impulsively 12 hours later.

1804
01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:43.900
Awesome.
Absolutely.
Very destructive.

1805
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:47.590
<v 1>Absolutely.
So the more integration we can and and,</v>

1806
01:50:47.650 --> 01:50:51.370
and the gentleman in the psychedelic work,
this a question of integration,

1807
01:50:51.371 --> 01:50:55.200
is it becoming a more and more recognized and,
and,
and,

1808
01:50:55.201 --> 01:50:56.380
and more and more practiced.

1809
01:50:56.950 --> 01:51:00.100
So integration means keeping in touch with people that can help you stay on

1810
01:51:00.101 --> 01:51:04.030
track,
keeping in touch with the goop that you shared,
the experience with,
uh,

1811
01:51:04.060 --> 01:51:07.780
putting some practice into your life.
Let's just journaling and meditation.
Yoga,

1812
01:51:09.410 --> 01:51:10.340
perhaps you,

1813
01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:13.150
you're going to return and do some more plant work or perhaps you won't.

1814
01:51:13.151 --> 01:51:15.820
That's entirely up to you.
There's no prescription to be made there.

1815
01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:21.300
But the point is to go from experience that is a discrete and time limited to

1816
01:51:25.691 --> 01:51:28.210
some kind of integration that is,
that happens over time.

1817
01:51:29.330 --> 01:51:31.440
<v 0>How do you format that,
that integration,</v>

1818
01:51:31.441 --> 01:51:36.441
are you interacting with the people on your retreats once a week for four weeks

1819
01:51:37.471 --> 01:51:41.070
or you have two sessions and the following week?

1820
01:51:41.190 --> 01:51:42.720
What is the actual format look like?

1821
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:47.570
<v 1>Well that's evolving and that's different for different people.
But um,</v>

1822
01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:53.560
in general I would say that if you can talk to somebody regularly over time and

1823
01:51:53.871 --> 01:51:55.670
if you can maintain your contact with the group,

1824
01:51:55.671 --> 01:51:58.730
so they're like a Facebook group,
Facebook group where people share experiences.

1825
01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:01.910
If you take on certain practices and you do them together,

1826
01:52:01.911 --> 01:52:05.860
or at least you do them simultaneously.
And then you talk share about practices.

1827
01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:08.480
Um,
these are all forms of integration,

1828
01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:12.030
<v 0>which,
and we've,
we've mentioned this a few times,</v>

1829
01:52:12.031 --> 01:52:15.840
applies to more than just the modality of using plant medicine.
Absolutely.

1830
01:52:15.841 --> 01:52:19.470
So after this,
that sound like broken record,
but this is very recent.

1831
01:52:19.740 --> 01:52:24.230
After going to this Tony robins event with a number of people including a,

1832
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:27.060
we have photo online.
So I think he's fine with me saying it.
Joe Gabia,

1833
01:52:27.061 --> 01:52:30.480
cofounder of Airbnb,
Marc Benioff,

1834
01:52:30.481 --> 01:52:34.530
the CEO of salesforce was sitting right behind me.
He was part of the group,

1835
01:52:34.531 --> 01:52:37.920
but he's a friend,
at least an acquaintance getting to know each other.

1836
01:52:37.921 --> 01:52:39.240
In any case.
Uh,

1837
01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:44.620
we kept a group texts grid,

1838
01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:45.110
uh,

1839
01:52:45.110 --> 01:52:48.800
going afterwards to hold each other accountable and also to set followup group

1840
01:52:48.801 --> 01:52:50.950
calls and so on.
Uh,

1841
01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:55.060
a number of things I'd really like to underscore because uh,

1842
01:52:55.110 --> 01:52:56.690
you mentioned them and,

1843
01:52:56.710 --> 01:53:01.710
and I'd like to reiterate their importance and also how they transcend the

1844
01:53:02.751 --> 01:53:06.890
premise and work the psychedelics.
The first is

1845
01:53:08.450 --> 01:53:12.950
you mentioned intentions and uh,
I'll just,

1846
01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:17.660
I'll just share my experience and also a number of recommendations that helped

1847
01:53:17.661 --> 01:53:21.170
me tremendously with plant medicine work.

1848
01:53:21.171 --> 01:53:24.080
But then life in general,

1849
01:53:24.590 --> 01:53:29.000
which is you set a clear intention but the clear intention is not the same as an

1850
01:53:29.001 --> 01:53:30.820
expectation.
That's right.

1851
01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:35.630
And if you go in to and you have an expectation you can't let go of,

1852
01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:36.620
that's right.
You end up,

1853
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:39.680
many people end up trying to white knuckle the experience.

1854
01:53:39.930 --> 01:53:42.690
<v 1>And that's true in general in life and is very true for plant experiences</v>

1855
01:53:43.050 --> 01:53:45.330
together that this is going to happen.
That's got this should happen.

1856
01:53:45.510 --> 01:53:48.720
And some people sit there the whole night visiting their experience because it

1857
01:53:48.721 --> 01:53:51.300
doesn't meet their expectations.
Right?
So there's,
there's a,
there's a

1858
01:53:51.330 --> 01:53:54.570
<v 0>card.
It's a little car that I was given as a gift,</v>

1859
01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:58.060
which I didn't come to appreciate fully until maybe a year or two ago.

1860
01:53:58.061 --> 01:54:02.850
I've been carrying it a long time and it was given to me by an ex girlfriend.

1861
01:54:02.851 --> 01:54:07.050
It's a,
and it says the tax,
the task,
which hinders your task is your task.

1862
01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:11.130
And See,
you mentioned a few things and he said,
well,

1863
01:54:11.131 --> 01:54:13.830
that is the work for that night.
And uh,

1864
01:54:14.070 --> 01:54:16.560
I've come to know a few people I respect as,

1865
01:54:18.530 --> 01:54:19.650
I hesitate to use the word,

1866
01:54:19.651 --> 01:54:22.590
but are because they're really only two or three people I have personally met.

1867
01:54:22.591 --> 01:54:27.390
I would feel comfortable calling a,
a Shaman,
uh,
and they all have minimum 10,

1868
01:54:27.391 --> 01:54:32.391
15 years experience in a traditional apprenticeship setting.

1869
01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:37.290
<v 1>And,
and,
and by the way,
that means deep personal work.
Very deep.</v>

1870
01:54:37.450 --> 01:54:41.730
He's sitting in the jungle by yourself being bitten by mosquitoes and doing that

1871
01:54:41.731 --> 01:54:45.690
means drinking,
uh,
various plans,
tobacco and other plants,

1872
01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:49.710
not beyond Ios run.
And really preparing,
I know somebody on that path right now.

1873
01:54:49.711 --> 01:54:52.380
Let me tell you,
very deep.
It's deep committed work.

1874
01:54:52.381 --> 01:54:56.610
It's not for the fainthearted.
I would never do it.
Yes,
very intense.
Very,

1875
01:54:56.611 --> 01:54:57.370
very intense.

1876
01:54:57.370 --> 01:55:01.150
<v 0>And I mean there,
there are people do 15 months of isolation,
dieting,</v>

1877
01:55:01.151 --> 01:55:03.950
various plants,
no sex and assault and the pork and red meat.
You know,

1878
01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:07.550
you know the drill we won't get into right now.
And uh,
what,

1879
01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:11.590
what they've,
they've shared a few examples with me

1880
01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:18.430
of say I,
I've never,
well that's not true,
but I,

1881
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:21.760
I have always in the past shied away from large groups.

1882
01:55:21.761 --> 01:55:25.850
That's why I was taken aback back with mentioning 50 people.
Uh,

1883
01:55:27.550 --> 01:55:30.730
but uh,
it is,

1884
01:55:30.731 --> 01:55:34.870
it seems very common in any group,

1885
01:55:34.930 --> 01:55:36.010
especially larger groups.

1886
01:55:36.011 --> 01:55:40.030
And this is true in psychedelics or at Vipassana retreats.
They actually,

1887
01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:42.670
the nickname for it that was given at the,

1888
01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:46.890
the day silent retreat I did at spirit rock was the Vipassana vendetta where you

1889
01:55:46.891 --> 01:55:51.060
decide that someone who's sitting close to you is coughing too loudly or clears

1890
01:55:51.061 --> 01:55:54.990
their throat too often or whenever.
And it starts to,
you start to perceive,

1891
01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.630
read and think about it incessantly and maybe get angry about it.

1892
01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:02.250
And instead of watching your own reaction instead of watching your reaction and

1893
01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:07.760
they're the example that was given to me by this,
this,

1894
01:56:07.761 --> 01:56:12.210
this particular,
uh,
I'm just going to say Ios Gatto to simplify things.

1895
01:56:12.211 --> 01:56:16.250
Iowa skittle,
someone who works with Ios guy was,
uh,

1896
01:56:16.410 --> 01:56:20.490
he told me about this,
this,
this Westerner came down,
I guess.

1897
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:23.130
I guess they're kind of Westerners to there,
just south of the border.

1898
01:56:23.131 --> 01:56:28.131
So Northern American who came down and was furious that someone in the group

1899
01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:31.200
wouldn't shut up with their screaming.
He was just furious about this.

1900
01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:35.260
And there are a number of ways an organizer can handle that.
But he,

1901
01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:40.140
he took the guy outside and he said,
that person is your work tonight.
Absolutely.

1902
01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:44.070
And if you think about that reframe

1903
01:56:45.570 --> 01:56:50.220
and how to view something that perhaps historically you would respond to as a

1904
01:56:50.221 --> 01:56:55.221
problem or an annoyance or offensive to view that.

1905
01:56:56.100 --> 01:56:58.710
And there are certain times when you have to fight and stand up for yourself.

1906
01:56:58.711 --> 01:56:59.640
I'm not saying you shouldn't,

1907
01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:05.070
but I think that in my case and in the cases of many folks,
we fight too often.

1908
01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:08.250
We wear ourselves out.
We get upset too often.
How can you view that as a gift?

1909
01:57:08.251 --> 01:57:09.660
How can you view that as a your work?

1910
01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:14.980
<v 3>Can I again give you a quote?
Yes,
please.
Which I love.
It's one of my,
from my,</v>

1911
01:57:14.981 --> 01:57:17.520
one of my favorite teachers and uh,
his name,

1912
01:57:17.521 --> 01:57:22.440
his age allness and he says,
you'll conflicts all the difficult things.

1913
01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:27.150
They're problematic stitchers situations in your life or not chance or haphazard

1914
01:57:27.690 --> 01:57:32.340
there.
Actually yours.
There's specifically yours designed specifically for you,

1915
01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:34.890
about a part of you that loves you more than anything else.

1916
01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:38.880
The part of you that loves you more than anything else has created roadblocks to

1917
01:57:38.881 --> 01:57:40.890
lead you to yourself.
You're not going,

1918
01:57:41.130 --> 01:57:43.680
you're not going to go in the right direction unless there's something fricking

1919
01:57:43.681 --> 01:57:47.760
on the side saying,
telling you,
look here this way,
that bothers you.

1920
01:57:47.761 --> 01:57:48.630
Love you so much.

1921
01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:52.560
That part of you loves you so much that it doesn't want you to lose the chance.

1922
01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:56.790
It will go to extreme measures to wake you up.
It will make you suffer greatly.

1923
01:57:56.820 --> 01:58:00.570
If you don't listen,
what else can it do?
That's its purpose.

1924
01:58:01.230 --> 01:58:03.810
And I found this to be true,

1925
01:58:03.811 --> 01:58:08.490
a physical illness and mental problems and everything.

1926
01:58:08.491 --> 01:58:10.950
You got to see what is the teaching here.

1927
01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:13.920
So we can look at all these things as problems to get rid of,

1928
01:58:14.370 --> 01:58:16.230
which is what the personality wants to do.

1929
01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:18.930
Or we can look at them as learning opportunities,

1930
01:58:18.990 --> 01:58:23.130
which is what you're to self wants to do.
Now,
two things.

1931
01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:26.760
One is you talked about intention in life.

1932
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:29.760
So my wife and I had a holiday recently in Costa Rica.

1933
01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:33.000
Partly it was the working holiday,
but partly it was just a holiday.

1934
01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:36.240
Traditionally we've had terrible times doing holidays,

1935
01:58:36.900 --> 01:58:40.080
partly because my workaholism and once I go into a holiday,
I just collapsed.

1936
01:58:40.081 --> 01:58:44.910
And now my wife is dragging a corpse around.
You know,
because,

1937
01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.260
because I'm a workaholic,
you know,
and I hadn't cleared a space.
So,

1938
01:58:47.710 --> 01:58:52.070
so this time we actually want to do the holiday with intention.
This is nothing.

1939
01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:55.090
It was like the Alex just to do it,
that we set an intention,
what is it,

1940
01:58:55.091 --> 01:58:57.100
our intention and if we have an intention,

1941
01:58:57.130 --> 01:59:01.210
I've learned from a couple of very wise teachers what structures,

1942
01:59:01.530 --> 01:59:05.200
who want to set up to support our intention and how are we going to handle when

1943
01:59:05.201 --> 01:59:06.850
there's kind of disagreement or conflict.

1944
01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:11.980
We had a beautiful holiday because it was the first international holiday that

1945
01:59:11.981 --> 01:59:15.550
we've had.
So that intention in life in general is absolutely essential.

1946
01:59:15.551 --> 01:59:18.280
Like every morning,
what is my actual intention?

1947
01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:21.550
You want to do a bit of an exercise and,
sure.
Okay.
And then you know,

1948
01:59:21.551 --> 01:59:25.170
if you don't like it,
just tell me when was the last I,

1949
01:59:25.470 --> 01:59:30.340
this is something I do in my groups or when I speak or in the summer.

1950
01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:33.830
Um,
and I teach,
so I,
yes,

1951
01:59:34.090 --> 01:59:37.720
I asked people to tell me some recent episode when they're upset with somebody

1952
01:59:37.721 --> 01:59:40.600
with their lives and something that they are open to sharing.

1953
01:59:40.601 --> 01:59:43.120
So it doesn't have to be anything sorted or thing,
but just something,
you know,

1954
01:59:43.121 --> 01:59:47.830
whether it's your spouse partner,
the bus driver,
I don't care what,
sure.
A friend.

1955
01:59:48.190 --> 01:59:51.580
Okay.
So are you going to do with it?
Okay.
I can share anything.

1956
01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:55.690
It just where you were upset with somebody.
Okay.
Yes.
Okay.
So what happened?

1957
01:59:55.691 --> 01:59:56.580
Describe it.
What happened?

1958
01:59:56.670 --> 01:59:57.150
<v 0>Yeah.
All right.</v>

1959
01:59:57.150 --> 02:00:02.150
There were a number of issues in my home broken,

1960
02:00:04.290 --> 02:00:05.520
uh,
aspects of the home,

1961
02:00:05.521 --> 02:00:10.020
things that were falling apart or needed to be fixed physically.
Physically.
Okay.

1962
02:00:10.021 --> 02:00:10.650
Yeah.
Right.

1963
02:00:10.650 --> 02:00:14.850
And I had hired someone to do these things right while I was gone and I came

1964
02:00:14.851 --> 02:00:16.350
back and none of them were fixed.
Okay.

1965
02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:20.760
<v 6>And your emotional reaction was anger.
Rage.
Anger.
Okay.</v>

1966
02:00:20.910 --> 02:00:22.050
Anything else besides anger?

1967
02:00:23.490 --> 02:00:24.090
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1968
02:00:24.090 --> 02:00:27.870
<v 0>Hmm.
I think they're close cousins.</v>

1969
02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:29.540
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1970
02:00:29.540 --> 02:00:33.230
<v 0>Frustration.
Frustration.
His anger.
Yeah.</v>

1971
02:00:34.050 --> 02:00:38.900
I was disappointed.
Disappointed it.
Sadness.

1972
02:00:38.930 --> 02:00:40.070
Yeah.
It's a different feeling.

1973
02:00:40.610 --> 02:00:44.930
So I was disappointed in myself also because I started to look at how maybe,

1974
02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:45.970
<v 6>well,
this appointed is,</v>

1975
02:00:45.971 --> 02:00:49.770
is not so much any emotion as a state of mind and asking what the emotions were.

1976
02:00:50.020 --> 02:00:51.900
I'm like,
what's inside?
Disappointment.

1977
02:00:53.230 --> 02:00:53.540
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1978
02:00:53.540 --> 02:00:56.290
<v 6>Sung,
it didn't happen.
I want it to happen.
How do I feel?</v>

1979
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:58.340
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1980
02:00:58.340 --> 02:01:02.360
<v 6>Isn't there a sadness there?
Sure.
Yeah.
There's sadness.
I'm not talk you into it.</v>

1981
02:01:02.361 --> 02:01:04.280
I'm just asking,
I suppose I'm,

1982
02:01:04.670 --> 02:01:08.810
I might be confusing state of mind and states of mind and emotion since I'm not

1983
02:01:08.811 --> 02:01:10.900
sure how to do something.
What I'm looking at.
The raw emotion.
Yeah.

1984
02:01:12.460 --> 02:01:13.510
<v 0>Yeah.
Sadness.</v>

1985
02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:17.340
<v 6>So there's anger and sadness.
Those are the emotions.
Let's,
let's go with that.</v>

1986
02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:21.120
Okay.
So I'm going to ask you a silly question.
What were,
you said an Andrea bug.

1987
02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:23.833
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1988
02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:27.900
<v 0>Well,
I suppose the answer,</v>

1989
02:01:27.901 --> 02:01:32.901
which is not the right answer I'm expecting was I was angry that someone had

1990
02:01:33.001 --> 02:01:36.090
made commitments to me and not fulfill those commitments.

1991
02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:40.110
<v 6>Okay.
That's what happened.
They had made the commitment in the phone,</v>

1992
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:42.120
but that doesn't tell me what you were sad or angry.
Well,

1993
02:01:44.190 --> 02:01:44.930
<v 4>okay.</v>

1994
02:01:44.930 --> 02:01:47.790
<v 2>What,
what,
what,
what does that mean?
That they didn't fulfill their commitments?</v>

1995
02:01:48.540 --> 02:01:49.050
Uh,

1996
02:01:49.050 --> 02:01:54.050
meant that they didn't care about me.

1997
02:01:54.910 --> 02:01:58.070
They didn't have that respect.

1998
02:01:58.310 --> 02:01:59.810
<v 6>So they didn't care about getting to know,
respect you.</v>

1999
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:02.090
What kind of person doesn't get cared for?
Respected

2000
02:02:04.050 --> 02:02:05.880
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

2001
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:11.870
I might need a lifeline here.
I don't know.

2002
02:02:11.871 --> 02:02:14.500
Someone who doesn't deserve to be cared for our respective,
exactly.

2003
02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:19.610
Somebody unworthy.
Right?
Sure.
Over respect then and,
and care.
Okay.

2004
02:02:20.030 --> 02:02:20.863
Now

2005
02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:25.270
<v 6>if two other people here,
which there usually are,
when I do this exercise,</v>

2006
02:02:25.271 --> 02:02:29.650
I would ask them,
okay,
we just listened to a Tim.
Tell us about this experience.

2007
02:02:30.010 --> 02:02:33.760
Are there other reasons why this other person might not have done the work that

2008
02:02:33.761 --> 02:02:38.761
has nothing to do with him or her not caring of a tam or not respecting him?

2009
02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:40.300
So what other reasons might there be

2010
02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:45.950
<v 2>1,000,001 with my name on it.
He could have,
he could be in the hospital,</v>

2011
02:02:46.140 --> 02:02:51.060
be in hospital,
are cared.
One could have been in a car accident.
Exactly.
Uh,

2012
02:02:51.061 --> 02:02:55.070
he had a flight delay and got caught on Puerto Rico during a hurricane.

2013
02:02:55.250 --> 02:02:59.720
<v 6>Yeah.
He's got ADHD.
Yeah.
Uh,
he and he can't follow through.</v>

2014
02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:02.810
He's under stress and he couldn't.

2015
02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:04.490
<v 2>Right.
Dude.
Okay.
Okay.</v>

2016
02:03:04.870 --> 02:03:07.300
The email that I was supposed to send a sitting and drafts and I thought I'd

2017
02:03:07.301 --> 02:03:08.920
sent it,
but in fact you never received it.
I mean,

2018
02:03:09.310 --> 02:03:11.860
<v 6>okay.
And any number of possibilities.
Yeah.
No,</v>

2019
02:03:12.580 --> 02:03:15.100
of all the possible use that you've just outlined.

2020
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:17.120
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2021
02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:21.920
<v 6>Including that they don't care about your respect you,
which is the worst one,</v>

2022
02:03:22.940 --> 02:03:26.840
<v 2>the one I immediately defaulted to.
Well,
I mean the worst,</v>

2023
02:03:29.910 --> 02:03:33.510
it's bad.
I don't know.
But internally,
yeah,
internally.
The worst assumption.
Yes.

2024
02:03:33.530 --> 02:03:34.520
The one that I immediately made.

2025
02:03:34.710 --> 02:03:38.970
<v 6>Exactly.
So let's notice something.
Hey you,
I should say we,</v>

2026
02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:42.000
because we're all like this,
we don't respond to what happens.

2027
02:03:42.780 --> 02:03:45.660
We respond to our perception of what happens.
Right?
Okay.

2028
02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:50.370
That's what the Buddha said.
It's with our minds are created the world so that,

2029
02:03:50.550 --> 02:03:55.230
um,
if you'd find that the Adhd or,
or,
or you have a stressed or,
you know,

2030
02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:58.170
you might've been sad for him,

2031
02:03:58.171 --> 02:04:02.650
but he would not have been angry and you will not have been said,
okay.
Uh,
you,

2032
02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:05.070
you might've,
you know,
so first of all,

2033
02:04:05.130 --> 02:04:08.850
we don't respond to what happens to respond to our perception of what happens to

2034
02:04:08.851 --> 02:04:10.410
her interpretation of it.
I'm just got number one,

2035
02:04:10.411 --> 02:04:15.060
number two of all the possible interpretations.
We choose the worst one.
Yup.

2036
02:04:15.360 --> 02:04:19.170
Number two,
certainly what I just said isn't true.
We didn't choose it.

2037
02:04:19.380 --> 02:04:20.500
It's not like you went through all this

2038
02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:23.430
<v 2>possibilities and you said it wasn't multiple choice.</v>

2039
02:04:23.490 --> 02:04:26.850
I chose option don't or he doesn't care about me and he doesn't respect me.

2040
02:04:26.860 --> 02:04:30.310
He didn't do that.
You brain jumped there automatically.
Right.
My question is why.

2041
02:04:30.820 --> 02:04:31.571
Yup.
All right.

2042
02:04:31.571 --> 02:04:36.280
Here's the learning first time in your life that you felt hurt and angry that

2043
02:04:37.110 --> 02:04:38.250
you've been,
you've received

2044
02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:42.000
<v 3>somebody didn't care about you.
I didn't respect you or has it happened before?</v>

2045
02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:46.720
<v 2>This is where the exercise might,
might,
might go sideways.</v>

2046
02:04:46.890 --> 02:04:48.130
I'm going to hit pause on that.

2047
02:04:48.131 --> 02:04:50.380
I think that's probably for more of a conversation,
number one.

2048
02:04:50.620 --> 02:04:53.140
But you'd probably agreed it's not.
The first time is not the first time.

2049
02:04:53.190 --> 02:04:54.020
Very good.

2050
02:04:54.020 --> 02:04:58.940
<v 6>And most people I talked to,
um,
it goes back way back.</v>

2051
02:04:59.300 --> 02:05:02.240
Yeah.
This goes way back into childhood.
Okay.

2052
02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:07.160
And that's what trauma is.
We don't respond to the present moment.

2053
02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:11.660
We respond to the past.
No,

2054
02:05:12.290 --> 02:05:15.920
but along the lines of where discussion,
it's a beautiful learning opportunity.

2055
02:05:16.820 --> 02:05:21.350
No.
You get to know now what if you assume for a moment that you're the most

2056
02:05:21.351 --> 02:05:24.860
lovable,
most worthy of care,

2057
02:05:25.940 --> 02:05:29.060
most worthy of respect,
person in the history of the universe.

2058
02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:34.130
And this guy doesn't do your home.
What's your response?

2059
02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:39.810
<v 2>Any number of the other options,
which does not trigger.
Yeah.</v>

2060
02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:41.480
And intense,
negative,
emotional state.

2061
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:43.470
All of those other options would trigger that.

2062
02:05:43.740 --> 02:05:46.650
<v 6>So something in use,
I would argue,</v>

2063
02:05:47.130 --> 02:05:50.520
still believes that you're not worthy of care and respect.

2064
02:05:52.530 --> 02:05:53.670
And that's what's gets triggered.

2065
02:05:53.700 --> 02:05:56.430
So who's the one that doesn't care about you and who's the one that doesn't

2066
02:05:56.431 --> 02:05:57.540
think you're worthy of respect?

2067
02:05:57.810 --> 02:06:00.960
<v 3>No,
it'd be me.
It would be,
you know,
that's a learning.
No,
it is.</v>

2068
02:06:00.961 --> 02:06:02.730
And this is exactly what you're talking about.

2069
02:06:02.731 --> 02:06:04.470
You're saying how these difficult things,

2070
02:06:04.471 --> 02:06:08.580
how these problems are always teaching opportunities.

2071
02:06:08.970 --> 02:06:13.200
And that's the beauty of healing is that when you reframe things and you,

2072
02:06:13.201 --> 02:06:15.660
and you actually see the source within ourselves,

2073
02:06:16.350 --> 02:06:19.170
all of a sudden that's liberating.
Because guess what?

2074
02:06:19.740 --> 02:06:22.890
If you're feeling that way because this guy did this or didn't do that,

2075
02:06:23.370 --> 02:06:28.230
that makes you a victim.
Yup.
But if you see that you are the source.
Yeah,
no,

2076
02:06:28.231 --> 02:06:29.064
you're powerful.

2077
02:06:29.100 --> 02:06:31.200
<v 2>Yeah.
You're empowered.
You are empowered.
Is that,</v>

2078
02:06:31.880 --> 02:06:35.300
this is something that a friend of mine here in Austin,
uh,

2079
02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:40.330
Robert Rodriguez recently said to me in a very similar way.
I mean it was,

2080
02:06:40.331 --> 02:06:41.460
it completely different context.

2081
02:06:41.461 --> 02:06:44.520
He was actually telling a story about someone else who was constantly blaming

2082
02:06:44.521 --> 02:06:48.180
people for everything in the film world.
And he said,

2083
02:06:48.181 --> 02:06:52.050
if you are the victim and you're,
and it's everyone else's fault,

2084
02:06:52.051 --> 02:06:53.820
you're powerless.
And he's,

2085
02:06:53.821 --> 02:06:56.130
we keep in mind every time you're pointing a finger at someone,

2086
02:06:56.190 --> 02:06:57.460
and I'd never heard this,
I,

2087
02:06:57.461 --> 02:07:00.930
I know it now after the fact that there are other people who have said this,

2088
02:07:00.931 --> 02:07:02.490
but he said every time you're pointing a finger at someone,

2089
02:07:02.491 --> 02:07:04.910
keep in mind that there are three fingers pointing back at you.
Exactly.

2090
02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:09.420
And I thought about it.
I was like,
wow,
that's just a good,

2091
02:07:09.660 --> 02:07:14.370
that's very sentenced to keep in mind.
No,
this is a recording studio sometime.

2092
02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:19.350
Was it this the,
yeah,
they do recordings.
The record in the past,
I just,

2093
02:07:19.730 --> 02:07:23.610
I just did the Johnny Cash every record here by any chance that,
you know,

2094
02:07:23.611 --> 02:07:25.830
I don't know if Johnny Cash was over here.
It's Po.

2095
02:07:25.890 --> 02:07:28.380
I would say it's possible because I spent around for a long time.

2096
02:07:28.410 --> 02:07:30.130
The reason I ask is cause he's got a song song

2097
02:07:30.150 --> 02:07:34.690
<v 6>that I play at all my events.
It's going to in your mind it's called,</v>

2098
02:07:35.320 --> 02:07:38.770
this is all goals done in your mind is on the soundtrack of dead man walking.

2099
02:07:39.240 --> 02:07:40.520
And He,
I think he wrote it himself.

2100
02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:43.180
It all goes down in your mind and it goes one foot in the fire,

2101
02:07:43.450 --> 02:07:45.820
w one foot on Jacob's ladder and other than the fire,

2102
02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:47.500
it all goes down in your mind.

2103
02:07:47.890 --> 02:07:51.370
So whether you are going to hell or it to you on the way to heaven,

2104
02:07:51.580 --> 02:07:52.690
it all happens up here,

2105
02:07:53.110 --> 02:07:57.430
which is such a powerful teaching cause this is what we can work on.
You know,

2106
02:07:57.630 --> 02:08:00.930
if we've,
if we're victims of the world,
uh,

2107
02:08:01.450 --> 02:08:05.150
Ramana Maharshi was a great Indian,
a guru.
Um,

2108
02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:09.610
he said something like,
if your foot hurts when you walk outside,

2109
02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:13.480
you can do two things.
One is the rep,
the horror world in Burlap,

2110
02:08:14.230 --> 02:08:15.340
or you can get a pair of shoes.

2111
02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:21.820
You can see yourself as the victim of the world and trying to change the world

2112
02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:23.710
so that they won't hurt you anymore.

2113
02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:29.650
Or you can actually empower yourself.
Yeah.
And that's what the heating is.
Oliver.

2114
02:08:32.210 --> 02:08:33.043
<v 0>Well,</v>

2115
02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:38.680
I will say the reason I wanted to have you on now is because I've been so

2116
02:08:39.771 --> 02:08:44.771
focused on trying to navigate these things myself over the last several years,

2117
02:08:45.261 --> 02:08:50.180
but most intensely over the last several months.
And I wanted to,

2118
02:08:51.540 --> 02:08:52.080
<v 7>okay.</v>

2119
02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:56.980
<v 0>You ready to have this conversation with you and,
and how you doing so far?</v>

2120
02:08:57.280 --> 02:09:01.620
I'm great.
I'm great.
I'm great.
I'm doing very well.
I think I'm the,

2121
02:09:01.621 --> 02:09:06.621
the sanest and a arguably in the best place I've been maybe ever.

2122
02:09:06.850 --> 02:09:10.960
So I feel very good.
That's very good.
That's w which means that,

2123
02:09:13.070 --> 02:09:13.850
<v 7>okay.</v>

2124
02:09:13.850 --> 02:09:17.410
<v 6>That he didn't,
he just,
this is just available.
It's just possible.
Yeah.
You know,</v>

2125
02:09:17.660 --> 02:09:21.410
I,
I,
I got an email a few months ago

2126
02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:28.080
from a woman called [inaudible] now Hermann goring was the chief of the

2127
02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:29.980
Luftwaffe under Hillary.
Got It.

2128
02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:31.870
<v 0>That's right.
I'm just wondering where I knew that name.</v>

2129
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:35.650
<v 6>Yeah.
And,
and,
and he was the head of the Gestapo,
just,
uh,</v>

2130
02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:41.180
an opiate addict,
by the way.
And a very clever,

2131
02:09:42.140 --> 02:09:43.550
very ruthless man.

2132
02:09:45.070 --> 02:09:45.560
<v 7>Okay.</v>

2133
02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:49.040
<v 6>His great niece sent me an email a few months ago,</v>

2134
02:09:49.850 --> 02:09:54.080
the thanked me for my work and she's been through her own process.

2135
02:09:54.140 --> 02:09:57.800
Imagine the Karma she was carrying.
Yeah.
And all the healing she has had to do.

2136
02:09:58.730 --> 02:10:00.080
So there was a grant,
her,

2137
02:10:00.090 --> 02:10:03.980
her great uncle tried to kill me and my people,

2138
02:10:05.060 --> 02:10:08.540
and there's the great niece making contact with me.

2139
02:10:10.420 --> 02:10:14.440
And to me,
it just in your example,

2140
02:10:14.441 --> 02:10:16.720
in my example and the example of so many people I know,

2141
02:10:16.721 --> 02:10:19.930
it's not like I'm a big piece of cake,
you know,

2142
02:10:20.350 --> 02:10:22.390
it's going to continue as long as I live.

2143
02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:26.680
But I experience internally the goodness and the healing that's available to us

2144
02:10:26.681 --> 02:10:30.700
and I didn't use to,
and I,
and I used to think I could help you,
everybody,
but,

2145
02:10:30.701 --> 02:10:34.470
but that I have was beyond hearing myself,
at least that was my belief,
know,
well,

2146
02:10:34.471 --> 02:10:39.260
let's put my corporate for the last 10 years.
Okay.
It just ain't true.
Um,

2147
02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:43.250
and anybody listening,
I just wanted to know.

2148
02:10:43.251 --> 02:10:44.690
It doesn't matter what state of mind you're in,

2149
02:10:44.691 --> 02:10:49.490
doesn't matter what you're experiencing.
It's human.
It,

2150
02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:53.090
uh,
it is,
tries,
mutable.

2151
02:10:53.091 --> 02:10:57.890
It is transformable because that to solve that you got disconnected from,

2152
02:10:58.130 --> 02:10:59.300
it's still available to you.

2153
02:11:00.380 --> 02:11:03.080
So it's not a question of just talking about what happened in the past.

2154
02:11:03.230 --> 02:11:05.870
It's a question of how do we connect to ourselves and what you're describing

2155
02:11:05.871 --> 02:11:09.710
about your own state.
If,
if,
if,
if I can put it in one sentence,

2156
02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:12.350
you'd probably agree with me that you probably are much more connected to

2157
02:11:12.351 --> 02:11:15.740
yourself than used to be a hundred percent a hundred percent an SDS and SDS.

2158
02:11:15.741 --> 02:11:19.220
We requisite.
I mean,
that's,
that's why I feel the way I described exactly.

2159
02:11:20.630 --> 02:11:25.310
<v 0>Gabor,
I really want to encourage people to learn more about you and your work.</v>

2160
02:11:25.820 --> 02:11:30.320
And there are,
so there are certainly a number of places they could start.

2161
02:11:31.010 --> 02:11:35.270
Where would you suggest people dig more deeply?

2162
02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:38.690
Is there a particular book of your books you would suggest they start with?

2163
02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:44.680
Is there a particular social media handle where they can pay attention and learn

2164
02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:50.510
various announcements and uh,
see what you share of your work and others?

2165
02:11:51.140 --> 02:11:55.720
<v 10>Well,
thanks for asking.
The simplest thing as my website ww,
Dr Gabo,</v>

2166
02:11:55.750 --> 02:11:59.870
that data column,
D R,
G A,
B o r,
m,
a,
t,
the calm,

2167
02:12:00.350 --> 02:12:01.190
where am I speaking?

2168
02:12:01.191 --> 02:12:06.080
Events and I travel lovey and North America and five countries abroad.

2169
02:12:06.190 --> 02:12:09.830
Uh,
this year,
um,
my speaking events are listed,
uh,

2170
02:12:10.010 --> 02:12:13.370
chapters in my books are available,
right?
It was about my books,
articles.

2171
02:12:13.371 --> 02:12:14.204
I've been,

2172
02:12:14.460 --> 02:12:18.980
I've multiple talks on Youtube that people have filmed and posted seen by

2173
02:12:18.981 --> 02:12:21.680
hundreds of thousands of people.
Um,

2174
02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:26.570
I have a Facebook video that somebody that about my work that's been seen 12

2175
02:12:26.570 --> 02:12:30.650
million times now.
Uh,
so there's all kinds of ways to discover me on Facebook,

2176
02:12:30.651 --> 02:12:31.484
on Youtube.

2177
02:12:31.490 --> 02:12:36.110
At my website and I would also really hope that people check out my books,

2178
02:12:36.430 --> 02:12:40.940
um,
of whichever.
Then for,
uh,
the first one,

2179
02:12:40.941 --> 02:12:44.690
the American title is scattered and it's about Adhd.

2180
02:12:45.290 --> 02:12:49.430
And I wrote it after my own diagnosis and pretty much what I've said earlier

2181
02:12:49.431 --> 02:12:51.680
that I don't see it as an inherited disease.

2182
02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:55.160
I do see it as a response to family,

2183
02:12:55.310 --> 02:12:59.060
multigenerational and social stress insensitive children.

2184
02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:03.470
People say you're blaming the parents.
I'm not blaming the parents.
Uh,

2185
02:13:03.471 --> 02:13:04.490
I'd only in myself,

2186
02:13:04.491 --> 02:13:08.120
but I know how stressed my family was when I was a workaholic doctor.

2187
02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:14.030
Um,
and so that's my first book.
And um,
when you say,
well,

2188
02:13:14.031 --> 02:13:19.031
why are we looking at the percentage of kids with ADHD going up so fast?

2189
02:13:19.580 --> 02:13:21.110
It's not an a genetic problem.

2190
02:13:21.111 --> 02:13:23.900
Jesus don't change in a population over five or 10 years.

2191
02:13:24.290 --> 02:13:27.830
It's a social problem as much more stressed in the culture now there's much less

2192
02:13:27.831 --> 02:13:31.680
connection in a culture now and less connected people are.
And the more there is,

2193
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:36.630
the more pressure there is unsensitive kids.
So that's scattered.

2194
02:13:37.740 --> 02:13:41.880
And other parenting book of mine is the work of a brilliant psychologist friend

2195
02:13:41.881 --> 02:13:44.370
of mine,
Gordon Neufeld,
Dr Neufeld,

2196
02:13:44.371 --> 02:13:46.950
who is the world's leading development psychologist.

2197
02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:48.270
As far as I'm personally concerned,

2198
02:13:48.690 --> 02:13:53.340
and I say that advisedly and the book is called hold on to your kids.

2199
02:13:53.370 --> 02:13:55.890
Why parents need to matter more than peers.

2200
02:13:55.920 --> 02:13:59.070
That's been published in over 20 languages now and it's about the fact that

2201
02:13:59.071 --> 02:14:00.720
since kids needs attachment,

2202
02:14:01.380 --> 02:14:04.500
the attachment need is the primary drive that we have and we've talked about

2203
02:14:04.501 --> 02:14:07.920
that.
It's like a duckling.
When a duckling hatches from the egg,

2204
02:14:07.921 --> 02:14:11.070
the duckling would be first to attach an imprint on the mother duck,

2205
02:14:11.730 --> 02:14:13.950
but what will he do if the mother duck is not around?

2206
02:14:14.250 --> 02:14:17.790
He'll imprint on a toy or a dog or a horse.
Our kids,

2207
02:14:17.820 --> 02:14:22.620
because the parents are too distracted and stressed in our society and and not

2208
02:14:22.621 --> 02:14:25.920
aren't so much anymore physically as during human evolution,

2209
02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:29.010
now find themselves in the company of other kids.
Guess what?

2210
02:14:29.011 --> 02:14:33.960
They imprint on their peer group and now you have immature creatures influencing

2211
02:14:33.961 --> 02:14:38.070
each other in moderately and this happens through the social media.

2212
02:14:38.250 --> 02:14:40.890
It happens in personal contact.
And as that happens,

2213
02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:44.160
the parents get pushed into the background,
they get more and more frustrated.

2214
02:14:44.290 --> 02:14:48.960
Now they get more authoritarian or they just give up and kids therefore don't

2215
02:14:48.961 --> 02:14:51.420
grow up.
They don't mature and they develop all kinds of problems.

2216
02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:53.340
Not because the parents don't love them,

2217
02:14:53.820 --> 02:14:55.530
but because simply because in this culture,

2218
02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:59.220
the connection between the kids and the parents have immediate disturbed.

2219
02:14:59.490 --> 02:15:02.520
And how do we store that connection is the subject of hold on to your kids.

2220
02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:08.280
So three of my books that are water on my own,
this one I wrote with Gordon,
uh,

2221
02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:12.090
my next book,
which is an a mindbody unity and health and illness.

2222
02:15:12.091 --> 02:15:14.610
And that's a conversation you and I could have another time,
but again,

2223
02:15:14.611 --> 02:15:18.450
where I showed that cancer,
autoimmune disease,
als,

2224
02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:24.090
multiple sclerosis,
Parkinson's,
colitis,

2225
02:15:24.091 --> 02:15:25.500
Crohn's disease,
chronic fatigue,

2226
02:15:25.501 --> 02:15:30.270
fibromyalgia are not accidental and separate physical events.

2227
02:15:30.510 --> 02:15:33.510
They had to do with the scientifically proven fact

2228
02:15:35.070 --> 02:15:39.150
that mind and body can't be separated.
And when things happen emotionally,

2229
02:15:39.900 --> 02:15:42.960
they will also happen physiologically.
In fact,
it can't be any other way.

2230
02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:48.060
And that the emotional system in our brains and our bodies and part and parcel

2231
02:15:48.061 --> 02:15:52.200
of the same system that also governs the immunity Norridgewock neurological

2232
02:15:52.201 --> 02:15:54.270
response and hormonal response.

2233
02:15:54.900 --> 02:15:58.710
And therefore when our lifelong patterns of emotional repression,

2234
02:15:59.370 --> 02:16:02.350
when people have to suppress themselves,
you know,

2235
02:16:02.351 --> 02:16:06.540
what the main thing and their attachments that 11 negative impact on their

2236
02:16:06.810 --> 02:16:10.440
immune system and the hormonal apparatus and the nervous systems as well.

2237
02:16:11.190 --> 02:16:15.810
And that book is called when the body says no exploring the stress disease

2238
02:16:15.811 --> 02:16:19.890
connection and has been published by over in over 20 countries internationally

2239
02:16:19.891 --> 02:16:24.030
as well,
including in the U S my file into my mind.

2240
02:16:24.031 --> 02:16:28.350
My favorite book,
uh,
is the most recent in the realm of hungry ghosts,

2241
02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:31.590
close encounters with addiction,
which explores addiction,

2242
02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:34.750
not from a point of view of a disease model or a choice model,

2243
02:16:34.751 --> 02:16:37.840
but how it is a response to a childhood loss,

2244
02:16:37.870 --> 02:16:42.790
stress and trauma and how to address that and also sort how to deal with,

2245
02:16:43.060 --> 02:16:45.580
like if you look at the United States right now,
you know what the facts are.

2246
02:16:46.210 --> 02:16:49.690
The most common cause of death under the age of 50 is now overdose.

2247
02:16:50.500 --> 02:16:55.500
And in the U s every three weeks do you have the equivalent of a nine 11 interns

2248
02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:59.860
every three weeks and nine 11 in terms of the number of people dying or where's

2249
02:16:59.861 --> 02:17:03.670
the public outcry,
whereas the resources,
whereas the political will,

2250
02:17:03.850 --> 02:17:07.270
whereas the mobilization of the media and and all the public health energies

2251
02:17:07.540 --> 02:17:10.720
compared to what happened after nine 11 and we're having this every three weeks

2252
02:17:13.390 --> 02:17:15.850
and why?
Because the treatment profession,

2253
02:17:16.330 --> 02:17:19.720
the medical profession and politicians in the legal profession does not

2254
02:17:19.721 --> 02:17:22.060
understand trauma and its relationship to addiction.

2255
02:17:22.510 --> 02:17:26.050
The average medical student doesn't even hear the word trauma and four years of

2256
02:17:26.051 --> 02:17:28.780
education doesn't even hear the word,
let alone get a lecture on it,

2257
02:17:29.140 --> 02:17:30.400
let alone get a course about it.

2258
02:17:30.940 --> 02:17:33.910
The stuff I told you about brain development is still not taught in most medical

2259
02:17:33.911 --> 02:17:36.640
schools.
So we have this response to addiction,

2260
02:17:36.641 --> 02:17:40.240
which is just dealing with the effects,
the behaviors,
controlling the,

2261
02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:43.990
the manifestations and not dealing with the causative factors.

2262
02:17:44.140 --> 02:17:45.460
That's why people don't get better.

2263
02:17:45.970 --> 02:17:49.750
And if you look at why right now is because social stresses increased,

2264
02:17:50.110 --> 02:17:52.580
economic insecurity is increased,
you know,

2265
02:17:52.581 --> 02:17:55.570
look at where do the opiate overdose happens more.

2266
02:17:55.900 --> 02:17:59.170
It's where areas where there's despondency and despair.
Totally.

2267
02:17:59.590 --> 02:18:04.590
And so that's the book in the realm of hungry ghosts that are not lots of my

2268
02:18:04.721 --> 02:18:05.830
talks on youtube,

2269
02:18:05.860 --> 02:18:08.860
but I think the best hub to check all this stuff out is my website.

2270
02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:12.790
And I hope to generate a podcast,

2271
02:18:12.820 --> 02:18:15.370
a regular podcast fairly soon.

2272
02:18:15.371 --> 02:18:18.700
If the people around me can twist my arm strong enough and organize me well

2273
02:18:18.701 --> 02:18:22.900
enough to do it,
there'll be a podcast.
And um,
I hope that will be up soon.

2274
02:18:22.901 --> 02:18:26.290
But knowing myself,
I don't want to make any promises,

2275
02:18:26.590 --> 02:18:28.860
but that'll certainly be listed on my website if it happen.

2276
02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:31.370
<v 0>And could you give your website URL one more time?</v>

2277
02:18:31.440 --> 02:18:33.180
<v 10>Okay.
Doctor Gobbler Matt Day</v>

2278
02:18:33.410 --> 02:18:36.930
<v 0>and Doctor Garber,
mata.com and uh,</v>

2279
02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:42.010
to everybody listening and watching.
There's the camera.
Uh,

2280
02:18:42.020 --> 02:18:44.630
I will also put that in the show notes.
So for everyone,

2281
02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:48.290
everything we've discussed,
the books,
resources,

2282
02:18:49.460 --> 02:18:52.850
organizations,
everything including your website,
which will be at the very top,

2283
02:18:53.060 --> 02:18:54.380
will be listed in the show notes,

2284
02:18:54.410 --> 02:18:59.410
which you can find at tim.blog/podcast and there'll be right at the top soil and

2285
02:18:59.511 --> 02:19:01.660
all of that will be very easy to find,
uh,

2286
02:19:02.930 --> 02:19:07.160
just in closing and we may very well end up doing around too at some point.

2287
02:19:07.161 --> 02:19:10.250
It wouldn't surprise me.
Uh,
even if it's off camera,

2288
02:19:10.251 --> 02:19:12.290
certainly we'd love to spend more time together.
Uh,

2289
02:19:12.410 --> 02:19:17.410
do you have any final closing words or a request or suggestion to the audience,

2290
02:19:20.270 --> 02:19:25.220
anything for people listening that you would like them to consider after they

2291
02:19:25.221 --> 02:19:26.090
finish this interview?

2292
02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:29.930
<v 10>Uh,
okay.
Um,</v>

2293
02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:34.550
I hope people will listen to you in a very personal sense,

2294
02:19:35.420 --> 02:19:39.260
not just as a,
an interesting experience,

2295
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:44.830
but as possibly pretending to themselves and that the discussion with you will

2296
02:19:45.231 --> 02:19:49.140
help people look at themselves in maybe a new way,
um,

2297
02:19:49.910 --> 02:19:51.830
with what I call compassionate inquiry.

2298
02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:56.210
So rather than self judgment about stuff that went wrong or

2299
02:19:57.830 --> 02:20:01.700
they did to themselves or others,
they get curious.
What made me do that.

2300
02:20:02.600 --> 02:20:06.910
They get fused compassionately because we were all born in a send them.

2301
02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:07.753
We're all born.

2302
02:20:08.980 --> 02:20:13.980
Just want it to be loving and loved and then something happens and then it's,

2303
02:20:14.781 --> 02:20:16.130
it's a hard road back.

2304
02:20:16.820 --> 02:20:21.660
But I hope that this conversation helps people reconnect with that path or,

2305
02:20:21.661 --> 02:20:23.930
or,
or,
or encourage them to continue on it.

2306
02:20:25.820 --> 02:20:29.810
And then secondly,
not to see it as an individual issue.
It's a social issue.

2307
02:20:30.260 --> 02:20:32.930
We live in a society that really does disconnect people.

2308
02:20:33.400 --> 02:20:37.310
And so it's not just an individual problem or an individual family problem,

2309
02:20:37.400 --> 02:20:40.640
it's multigenerational.
We never even talked about the mulch energy,

2310
02:20:40.760 --> 02:20:43.920
multigenerational nature of trauma,
but it is,
uh,

2311
02:20:44.200 --> 02:20:46.670
you pass this on from one generation to the next,

2312
02:20:46.671 --> 02:20:48.830
not because we intend to vote because we can't help it.

2313
02:20:49.430 --> 02:20:53.840
So it needs to be looked at in deep over the generations and broadly as the

2314
02:20:53.841 --> 02:20:57.750
function of a whole society.
Now let me give you one quick example,
if I May.
Sure.

2315
02:20:58.040 --> 02:21:01.700
A study last year showed that American black women,

2316
02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:05.690
the more experiences of racism they have,
the greater the risk of asthma.

2317
02:21:06.900 --> 02:21:11.710
And what does that tell us?
What a gift would it be?
Give people to,

2318
02:21:11.780 --> 02:21:13.910
to,
to control their asthma.

2319
02:21:14.120 --> 02:21:18.710
We give them inhalers that contain a copy of adrenaline and a copy of cortisol,

2320
02:21:20.600 --> 02:21:23.150
the stress hormones and other,
there was asthma.

2321
02:21:23.160 --> 02:21:24.410
Everything's everything to do with stress.

2322
02:21:24.770 --> 02:21:27.620
I'm not going to the scientific details now.
I could,
but it won't.

2323
02:21:28.520 --> 02:21:33.520
But it shows this question is the asthma Mac black woman an individual disease?

2324
02:21:35.510 --> 02:21:37.550
What does it a dysfunction of entire society?

2325
02:21:38.510 --> 02:21:42.830
And obviously it's the ladder so that the Buddha said that was at the many,

2326
02:21:42.831 --> 02:21:45.650
that cannot be the one I thought the one that cannot be the nanny.

2327
02:21:45.860 --> 02:21:48.860
And he talked about the interconnected core rising of phenomenon.

2328
02:21:49.160 --> 02:21:52.280
So we are social creatures.
Our brains are wired together.

2329
02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:55.910
Dr Dan Siegel talks about interpersonal neurobiology.

2330
02:21:56.030 --> 02:21:58.910
We're not isolated creatures.
So what have you dealing with?

2331
02:21:59.180 --> 02:22:01.790
You have to look at not just the individual internal environment,

2332
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:06.500
but also the broader social and cultural environment of which you are one

2333
02:22:06.501 --> 02:22:07.730
particular manifestation.

2334
02:22:08.750 --> 02:22:13.010
And as our mutual friend Joe Polish,
so for MP wants,

2335
02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:15.410
we need to change the conversation around these issues,

2336
02:22:15.411 --> 02:22:16.420
particularly as for example,

2337
02:22:16.421 --> 02:22:21.421
on addiction from a blaming and shaming and ostracizing and just medical model

2338
02:22:22.040 --> 02:22:26.400
perspective to one that takes into account trauma and social issues,

2339
02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:28.200
image beings compassion into it.

2340
02:22:28.620 --> 02:22:31.530
And that must be the same for our mental health issues as well.

2341
02:22:31.830 --> 02:22:32.880
And whatever we look at,

2342
02:22:32.881 --> 02:22:35.670
we have to look at both the individual and the broader context.

2343
02:22:36.630 --> 02:22:38.460
<v 0>Thank you for that.
And you mentioned</v>

2344
02:22:40.770 --> 02:22:45.770
how we all begin loving and wanting to be loved or needing love and then

2345
02:22:46.441 --> 02:22:48.330
something happens and it's a hard road back.

2346
02:22:48.840 --> 02:22:51.960
And what I'd like to add to that is it's a hard road back,

2347
02:22:51.961 --> 02:22:56.961
but it's a worthwhile rode back and it is possible to find your way back.

2348
02:22:57.630 --> 02:23:00.780
If you had told me that a year ago,
I would have completely dismissed it,

2349
02:23:00.781 --> 02:23:05.781
but I'm in different place now and I would just like to thank you for helping

2350
02:23:06.661 --> 02:23:11.661
people to navigate that and it's very meaningful work that you do.

2351
02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:15.770
Thank you.
Thank you for taking the time today as well.
Oh,

2352
02:23:15.780 --> 02:23:17.280
it's a great pleasure to speak with you.
Thank you.

2353
02:23:17.490 --> 02:23:22.290

2355

This is not a one and done something you listened to and then you go on as if

2356
02:23:28.891 --> 02:23:33.600
you never heard it.
Please look at the show notes.
