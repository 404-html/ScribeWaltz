00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.800
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:07.000
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking and I answer

3
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:10.780
your question.
No,
it does seem like

4
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.340
I'm a cybernetic organism living this year.

<v 1>This episode is brought to you by 99 designs your one stop shop for all things</v>

6
00:00:27.581 --> 00:00:29.140
graphic design related.

7
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.170
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers including

8
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.870
sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

9
00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:41.860
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

10
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.070
the brainstorming and a lot of it took place with designers from around the

11
00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:49.300
world.
And here's how it works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,

12
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.780
a website and APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

13
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.530
you submit that project and designers from around the world,

14
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.170
we'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

15
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.860
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

16
00:01:02.861 --> 00:01:04.570
money back.
It's that straight forward.

17
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.260
And many of you who are listening have already used it and created some amazing

18
00:01:08.261 --> 00:01:10.660
things that I'll be sharing in the future.
But in the meantime,

19
00:01:10.661 --> 00:01:13.630
if you want to see some of my competitions,

<v 2>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.270
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.
I get asked all the time,</v>

25
00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:31.460
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

26
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.370
And my answer is inevitably Athletic Greens,

27
00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:36.860
it is your all in one nutritional insurance.

28
00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:38.600
I recommended it in the four hour body,

29
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.620
did not get paid for that and I travel with it to avoid getting sick.

30
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.650
I take it in the mornings to ensure optimal performance.

31
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.120
It just covers all my basis.

32
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.140
If I can't get what I need through whole food meals throughout the rest of the

33
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.970
day,
and you can get 50 oh my God,
50% off.
Yes,
50% off.

where it is my job to deconstruct world class performers,

42
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.620
whether they are chess prodigies,

43
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.100
musicians,

But this time we have one of your favorites.

47
00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:50.720
Categorically.
You guys love these episodes and we have a strength coach,

48
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.370

49
00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:56.330

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.790
Charles is currently teaching advanced hypertrophy,

60
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.870
nutrition and strength seminars alongside one of my favorite athletes,

61
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.040
Olympic weightlifting icon and medalist Dimitri cloak off.

62
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.070
You have to look this guy up and there is a photo of Charles who's now over 50

63
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:46.291
years old training with Dimitri and it looks like Charles arms might be bigger,

64
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.200
amazingly sky as a specimen,
both of them.
In any case,

65
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.410
Polokwane has authored more than 600 articles on strength training.

66
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:57.610
He is prolific and his work has been translated into 12 different languages.

67
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.970
He has also written eight books and his latest work is armed size and strength,

68
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.300
the ultimate guide and he certainly walks the talk with that one.

69
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.590
You have to see it to believe it and I'll certainly put some photos and the show

73
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:30.430
the bad and the ugly of that.
What to do with loose skin or stretch marks.

74
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.530
We covered just about everything,
his ideal breakfast and uh,

75
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.060
he is an amusing fellow.

76
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:41.470
skin on your abs,

77
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.070
while he will give you some imagery that will help you remember all sorts of

78

80
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.280
this conversation covers a lot.
I had a blast.

81
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.690
I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
And here is Charles Poliquin.

82
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.550
Charles,
welcome to the show.
Thank you Tim.

83
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.320
I really appreciate you asking me to be on your podcast.

84
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.110
I'm excited to dig into all sorts of good stuff.

85
00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:17.890
You and I have spent some time together and I,
I still remember,

86
00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:20.050
I'm not sure if it's post traumatic stress disorder,

87
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.670
but the art that you did on my shoulder,
one of your seminars,

88
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.220
uh,
where I was,
I was held down.

89
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:30.900
I felt like it was a scene out of Oz or something.
But the,
uh,

90
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.500
you have a very wide ranging,

91
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.860
a very wide ranging expertise and that that goes all the way from you to art

92
00:05:43.421 --> 00:05:47.350
active release technique and doing this manual therapy to the training,

93
00:05:47.351 --> 00:05:51.160
the nutrition,
the supplementation.
When someone asks you what do you do,

94
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.390
what is your answer?
I simply say I'm a strength coach.
Uh,

95
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.980
but the tools I use,
I guess there were a bit worried than some

96
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.813
<v 3>of my colleagues.</v>

97
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.800
And how did you first become fascinated by,

98
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.100
by strength and also closely related to that?
Is English,

99
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.920
is English your first language?
Not at all.
It's French.

100
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:14.780
I didn't speak English actually til I was 17 and then as she learned English

101
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.620
because I wanted to be really good at strength training.

102
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:22.670
So the story behind that is that,
you know,
as a kid,

103
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.210
I remember looking at Tarzan comics or watching captain America cartoons and I

104
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:32.630
was always wanted a big physique.
I thought that was like the ultimate hero.

105
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.370
But what happened is that when I was about 14,
uh,
you know,

106
00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.940
as I'm a recovering Catholic,
so I have to go to Catholic church every Sunday.

107
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.100
And to be frank,
I hated it.

108
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.570
And I only went there to prove on this girl called Lucy,
didn't you?

109
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.000
It was very hot.
And then one day she didn't show up.
So the next day on Monday,

110
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:56.720
I said,
Hey Lucia,
you weren't at Church that she goes,
no,
I'm 14 now.

111
00:06:56.721 --> 00:06:59.630
And my parents say,
you can decide whether you go or not.
So I said,

112
00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:03.350
if it's good enough for her,
it's good enough for me.
So what happened is I,
um,

113
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.930
uh,
there was a university library.

114
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.800
You still bought bottle was right beside the church.
So I said,

115
00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:13.580
instead of wasting my time listening to what I thought it was bullshit,

116
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.100
I'm going to go to the university library.

117
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.540
And I was on the magazine section to periodicals and assign a French,

118
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.580
uh,
magazine appear article from Belgium called Kinesiology,
kinesiology.

119
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.030
And they talked about arthritis in the knee.
And I saw,
I read it,

120
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.170
it was in French so I could understand.
And I didn't speak English at a time.

121
00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:37.840
So then it didn't take a long time to go through anything in French.

122
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.390
Today was about strength training.
So then I said,
okay,
I've got to learn English.

123
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:46.391
And I distinctly remember having to look up what bicep peak meant.

124
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.450
Like I said,
use the English dictionary,

125
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.210
bicep peak and the peak as in peak of a mountain.
I go,
that guy,

126
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.780
it's a figure of style,
blah,
blah,
blah.

127
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.110
And then so I learnt everything in English,
uh,

128
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:05.810
rather quickly because that passion and then I realized that all the best stuff

129
00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:10.730
was in German.
So I decide to learn German.
And that's how I started.
I always,

130
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.280
always wanted to be ahead of the game.

131
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.880
So I always figured out who's the best teachers and then learn from that.

132
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.920
And I remember I was 21,

133
00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:23.921
I would save my money up and I went to Jimmy that meet Raul phaser and I took

134
00:08:23.931 --> 00:08:25.880
the,
uh,
German volume training from,

135
00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:29.750
and I would see all the experts that I went to Finland and we Pavel call me and

136
00:08:29.751 --> 00:08:34.220
have had deep Marshman blacker.
So whoever it was the best at the time,

137
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.590
I went to learn from them.
So,
uh,
that's how I started actually.

138
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:43.170
And you have it just a,
an astonishing memory,

139
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.570
factual recall ability.

140
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.380
Is that something that your parents also had?

141
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.410
My father a spork 14 languages,

142
00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:56.340
so I guess he did a,
uh,
I have a great memory.

143
00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:00.820
<v 4>I think that's,
uh,
I basically taught myself how to read that.</v>

144
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.110
My parents realized I knew how to read before I went to school.

145
00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:08.040
So the way I figured it out is that,
you know,
we had a lot of,

146
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.540
I was the fifth out of eight boys,
so there was a lot of books around,

147
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.800
a lot of comic books in French and there would be like these,
uh,
word,

148
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:21.270
uh,
illustrate dictionary books.
Right.
So let's see,
I saw a fire truck,
you know,

149
00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:25.440
French,
Kenyan,
Pompeii.
Then I said,
okay,
the code for fire truck is this.

150
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.460
And after that I start to read the comic strip called Asterix.

151
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.960
And so my father came back from Paris and he told my mom,

152
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.220
yeah,
he,
he's pretending knows how to read.
And my mom said,
no,

153
00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:42.120
he knows how to read.
He goes,
that's impossible.
He,
he has a good memory,

154
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:48.010
is breathers read to him and he just recites like period parakeet and she goes,

155
00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:50.340
no,
because I have the ultimate test.

156
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.300
So the French edition always came out six months before and then the Canadian

157
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:58.080
dishes.
And since my father knew that all his boys like Asterix,

158
00:09:58.081 --> 00:10:02.280
you would always buy the latest asterix.
So you pull it out,
he says,
read this.

159
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.750
And I read it.
He was astonished.

160
00:10:03.751 --> 00:10:08.590
I could read it in my muscle that told you he taught himself how to read.
So,
uh,

161
00:10:08.591 --> 00:10:11.970
apparently my oldest brother did the same thing.
So it's a,

162
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.840
I was just wanting to learn.
It was bored to death.
So I would pick up reading.

163
00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.450
That's,
that's an incredible,
I,

164
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.290
did your brothers also have an interest in strength training or was that,

165
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.190
were you the the odd one of the group?
Uh,

166
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.610
vibrators,
interests are quite different than mine.

167
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.680
I'm the odd one when the family got it.
And,
um,
I'm going to you,

168
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.310
uh,
ask,
uh,
ask a question,
the wording of which might be a little weird,

169
00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:41.490
but I think you're known for quite a few different things.

170
00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:44.760
What are your best friends think you're world class at the,

171
00:10:44.761 --> 00:10:49.330
perhaps the rest of the world doesn't know.
Probably,
uh,

172
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:54.780
people say that and the best friend to have the worst enemy to.
Uh,
so the LCL,

173
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:58.800
I'll jump in front of a bullet for them,
but before I jump in front of book,

174
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:03.420
I'd write a killer guy myself.
But,

175
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.840
uh,
people say that I'm the most,

176
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:10.980
the compliment I appreciate the most is when people say it to me.

177
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.510
I wish I had a father like you.

178
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.860
So when they see me in track with my daughter and the way she A's and we,

179
00:11:16.861 --> 00:11:19.710
she learns and they said,
uh,
Eh,

180
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:24.630
and I'm really well known to teach.
People have to have confidence.

181
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.670
That's what he said.
I'm a little class that.
So for example,

182
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.770
I had a friend of mine,
she's a single mother or kids.
Dad was absent.

183
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:36.570
So she left him with me for the day,
and when she came back,

184
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.300
the kid knew how to swim it and you had to ride a bicycle without training

185
00:11:39.301 --> 00:11:42.210
wheels.
And she goes,
she did that in a whole day.
I said,
well,

186
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.200
teaching how to swim without fee,
it takes five minutes.
She goes,
are you serious?

187
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.640
And I told him how I teach it.
And she goes,
wow,
that's very simple.
So,

188
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:55.570
uh,
I guess I'm world class at solving problems.
Uh,
and people love my cooking.

189
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.320
Anybody that's been to my house,
but you know,
I cook man food,
you know.

190
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:02.830
So for example,
and make a chili with Yak,

191
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:08.230
a buffalo and elk and ostrich and you know,
people that have six,

192
00:12:08.231 --> 00:12:12.400
seven servings,
they feel it.
But I like it.
I like to cook.

193
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:17.060
I think that's a,
a great way to be creative.
And,
uh,

194
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:22.150
I guess being creative is one of my biggest assets.
Um,
I,

195
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:24.170
um,
and I,

196
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.830
I love to think like a recipe and then improve it.
You're,
so,

197
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.900
I'm not one to stick to rules so much.

198
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:36.500
<v 1>What is your,
so your,
your chili sounds like the Noah's Ark Chile.</v>

199
00:12:36.501 --> 00:12:40.060
It's a bit of every animal imaginable.
So what,
what is,

200
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.040
what are the ingredients in the Chili?
What's the key to making good Chili?

201
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:47.520
<v 4>I think the key to making good Chili's actually blending the meats,
for example,</v>

202
00:12:47.521 --> 00:12:49.620
ostriches they're really high iron content,

203
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:54.240
but you might as well chew on a elite cold barbell plate when you eat ostrich.

204
00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.760
Right?
It's,
it's so,

205
00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:00.150
and then I take a use with a higher fat content,
uh,

206
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.610
like the Yak and then that kind of offsets it.
And I used to Alec,

207
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.860
but l for a lot of people that tends to be two gaming.
Right?

208
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.990
But when you have a buffalo kind of equals it out.
So,
uh,

209
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.820
and I've played with the ratios over the years,

210
00:13:14.821 --> 00:13:19.380
but I think I've got the recipe down pat.
But the secret is it the Yak,

211
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:24.120
I think the Yak makes a huge difference on the,
on a pellet bill the of the meal.

212
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:25.310
Got It.

213
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:28.250
<v 1>And is that,
that's partially thanks to the fat content.</v>

214
00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:29.501
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

215
00:13:29.501 --> 00:13:34.300
And also because all the animals I pick tend to have,

216
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.260
um,
high omega three fat in them because it would be eat,
I mean,

217
00:13:38.261 --> 00:13:40.150
the best meat deed in the world is white PT,

218
00:13:40.151 --> 00:13:44.380
which is a type of deer that lives in north eastern Canada.

219
00:13:44.381 --> 00:13:47.200
And you can only shoot it from an helicopter because there's no roads to where

220
00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:52.201
the white PT lives and that needs is chased by walls all day.

221
00:13:52.451 --> 00:13:56.140
So besides the fact that it's grass than animal itself,

222
00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:58.420
which is really high in Omega three,

223
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.350
the animal is chaste multiple times a day by a wolf pack,

224
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.260
which makes the animal make glycogen,

225
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.060
which makes them eat a fatty and sweet at the same time.
You know,

226
00:14:09.061 --> 00:14:12.200
it's like how it's almost like a fudge in a meeting.
So,

227
00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:17.800
but the problem is is you're not allowed to import it into the u s so I only

228
00:14:17.801 --> 00:14:19.780
made it when I go see my folks in Canada.

229
00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:20.851
<v 1>Got It.
Yeah.</v>

230
00:14:20.851 --> 00:14:24.750
You have to have to a pretty high barrier to entry if it requires a helicopter

231
00:14:24.751 --> 00:14:27.240
ride and,
and sniping skills from the air,

232
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.330
<v 4>basically.
So,
you know,
when I go to Montreal it know where to buy it.</v>

233
00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.740
And there's a place where my sister lives and get no where the avid in stock

234
00:14:36.741 --> 00:14:37.574
year round.

235
00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:42.110
But it is the best meeting Jerry come and him or in Montreal area.

236
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.700
I'll take you the teeth.
That means,

237
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.280
<v 1>oh I'd love to.
I'd love to do that.
I've never been to Montreal.</v>

238
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:50.690
They have very good tango there as well from what I hear.
But um,
the um,

239
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.190
the next,
the next question is kind of a sidestep,
but you have these,

240
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.150
these little nuggets.

241
00:14:56.151 --> 00:15:01.130
And I remember one question that I get asked a lot you had to answers to,

242
00:15:01.131 --> 00:15:05.240
which was how to get rid of stretch marks.
So what happens quite often is I'll,

243
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:09.350
uh,
people will follow any given diet or maybe not one of the diets and the four

244
00:15:09.351 --> 00:15:12.260
hour body or whatever and they'll lose a lot of weight and then they'll have

245
00:15:12.261 --> 00:15:14.980
this loose skin or stretch marks to contend with.
Um,

246
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.670
how do you recommend people,
uh,
mitigate or,

247
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:23.840
or get rid of stretch marks or loose skin?
What are your thoughts on that?

248
00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:24.391
<v 4>I mean,</v>

249
00:15:24.391 --> 00:15:27.050
if you're the type of guy who has lost so much weight that you can actually,

250
00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:31.950
you Winster what you're a scrotum,
then here's the solution,

251
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:33.900
the,
the,

252
00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:39.030
there's an herb called got you cola and that herb will,

253
00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.660
and I learned this from of the past quality was one of my early mentors.
Yup.

254
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:47.960
We'll get rid of what we call unnecessary scar tissue or an unnecessary

255
00:15:49.861 --> 00:15:50.790
connective tissue.

256
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.950
The truth of the matter though is that you will see zero progress,

257
00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:00.810
uh,
for that loose skin,
uh,
for six months.
So people say what?

258
00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:04.920
It's not worth it,
but I tell people just keep doing it for six months.

259
00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.540
And then it's almost like overnight.

260
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.960
This seems to be a saturation point where then the body gets the message to cell

261
00:16:12.541 --> 00:16:16.050
signaling.
And then in matter of days,
and I've had,
for example,

262
00:16:16.051 --> 00:16:19.050
people look like the AV,

263
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:24.090
15% body fat and they're actually 6% body fat when you measure them on a Dexa

264
00:16:24.091 --> 00:16:28.890
scan.
And then when they do this,
a supplement for an extended period of time,

265
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.890
which is two tablets three times a day,
then,
uh,

266
00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:38.260
overnight they tighten up.
This,
this is not an exaggeration.

267
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.390
Everybody who's tried it said the eye,
it's exactly what it is.
I mean,
add,
uh,

268
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.140
one of my best students who was a former pro bodybuilder,

269
00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:51.260
yet a client came in any weighed 480 pounds and he decided to lose weight

270
00:16:52.081 --> 00:16:55.770
because you would select this clothes the night before and you realize this

271
00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:57.030
pants covered a whole bed.

272
00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:02.760
So you enter this gym and after a year and a half,
he was done at 200 pounds.

273
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.640
So we had lost 280 pounds.
But I mean,

274
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:10.980
there's enough loose skin to Barry five cadavers inside of them.
So we,
um,

275
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:15.970
that's all my friend just gave him that.
And a year later I met that guy.

276
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:19.890
He was so thankful for that tricky because you finally got rid of the loose
skin.

277
00:17:19.891 --> 00:17:23.370
So,
uh,
Gotcha.
Cola is the,
or you want to use for that?

278
00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.640
<v 1>Got It.
Got U K O la,</v>

279
00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.170
<v 4>is that right?
Yeah.
Yeah,
exactly.
It's two separate words.
Yes.</v>

280
00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:31.950
<v 1>And uh,
are you using anything topically as well or is it all,
uh,</v>

281
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.610
consumed all consumable.

282
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.770
<v 4>There are some camp pounding pharmacists that will make you a Gotcha Cola,</v>

283
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:42.030
a bioabsorbable cream that works a lot faster.

284
00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:45.900
I would say if he could find the pounding pharmacist,
I will do that.

285
00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.900
And it's a biologically active form.
Uh,

286
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:53.520
you could get the same results in about two to three months in Canada and nearly

287
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.810
early eighties.
You could actually buy it as a prescription.
Got It.

288
00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.970
But it wasn't popular.
That's what Mauer used to recommend.

289
00:17:59.971 --> 00:18:04.230
And then when it cream,
uh,
fell out of the marketplace,

290
00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.030
the best alternative was to use the oral.

291
00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.950
<v 1>I see.
Then this is,</v>

292
00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:13.980
you seem to find a B because you have so many contacts and you work with so many

293
00:18:14.441 --> 00:18:18.100
coaches,
not only coaches,
but also doctors in different countries.

294
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:22.260
I'm constantly astonished by the,
uh,

295
00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:24.190
I wouldn't say shortcuts,

296
00:18:24.191 --> 00:18:27.640
but just a very elegant approaches that you can find all of these just from

297
00:18:27.641 --> 00:18:28.900
problems.
What are,

298
00:18:28.901 --> 00:18:33.250
what are things that you believe that most other people think are crazy?

299
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.960
<v 4>Well,
now,
okay.
We all know about the Chinese five elements.</v>

300
00:18:42.961 --> 00:18:43.910
Correct?
Right.

301
00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.730
<v 1>Maybe you could give an overview for folks who aren't familiar,
but</v>

302
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.780
<v 4>okay.
Okay.
So in Chinese medicine,
they believe there's five elements.</v>

303
00:18:51.781 --> 00:18:56.730
They regulate,
uh,
Al Fire,
water,
Earth,
metal,

304
00:18:56.790 --> 00:19:00.910
and uh,
met them at open water.
You know,

305
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.280
the point is,
is that,

306
00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.200
so in Chinese medicine they'll describe a condition as let's say excessive fire

307
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.670
or not enough fire or fire deficiency or water access.

308
00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.090
And this was very poetic,

309
00:19:15.091 --> 00:19:19.740
but now science has backed up what it means in Chinese medicine.

310
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:20.873
For example,

311
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:25.830
osteoporosis and the adrenal fatigue or the same thing while in western

312
00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:28.620
medicine,
it's not so years ago,

313
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.350
add observed at training the training of athletes as to be individualized.

314
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:37.790
So for example,
you know,
when you talk like let's say about squat,

315
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.670
two of my favorite people on earth or Ed Coan and John wrote,

316
00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.420
and in order to get a big squad,
but if you look at the way day gets you to,

317
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:50.220
I have a big squad,
it's diametrically opposed,
but the keys not to say,

318
00:19:50.221 --> 00:19:54.270
well one is better than the other would.
The key is,
is what is best for you.

319
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.900
And I studied the Chinese medicine approach on it.

320
00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:02.980
What I've figured out is that it's actually a neurotransmitter dominance if you

321
00:20:03.601 --> 00:20:08.420
want to explain it into the modern world.
So some athletes make a lot of dope.

322
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:11.400
They mean they need a lot of variation.
There were cows,

323
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.430
they need to go balls to the walls,
every workout.
Uh,

324
00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:18.570
but they need variation.
If they don't have variation every workout,

325
00:20:18.571 --> 00:20:22.230
they don't make progress.
While some people are what I call earth type,

326
00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:27.060
which I don't have a any dominance,
and then they,
it,

327
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.840
they're more like Thomas the tank engine.
It's slow progress.

328
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:35.910
All that training methods is based on patients.
They never miss a live,

329
00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:39.900
you know,
and that method works for them.
And in bodybuilding,

330
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:43.080
you've seen that you've seen in every sport lately,
even look at wrestling.

331
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:47.570
Of course three girls are on national team and one is dopamine,

332
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.530
the dominant.
And she's like,
uh,

333
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.440
among goose on TCP,
when she fights,

334
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.450
she's really hard to predict what she does.
And then the,
you know,

335
00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:02.560
esoteric Coleen dominant one where she's,

336
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:06.460
she has a style that confuses people.

337
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:09.640
And then I've heard type wrestlers number one in the world right now.

338
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.580
And she's very patient when she fights and you know,

339
00:21:12.581 --> 00:21:16.360
she'll arm lock you in and she waits,
she waits,
she waits and she tires you out.

340
00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:21.040
And she's not a dominant in any neuro transmitters which would make her her

341
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.490
earth type,
you know?
So over the,
so now people,

342
00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:26.380
when I started to talking about the elements,
people say,

343
00:21:26.381 --> 00:21:29.680
oh he's like granola had bullshit or blah blah blah.

344
00:21:29.681 --> 00:21:33.970
And then now my most popular courses actually advanced program design.

345
00:21:33.971 --> 00:21:35.680
And if you look at the reviews on my website,

346
00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:40.240
if people say that's the fastest way to individualize the training process and

347
00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.760
we really big on individualization,

348
00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:47.470
I think that people want a cookie cutter approach and they don't like the fact

349
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.660
that when I answer a question,
if you ask me a question,

350
00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:56.320
what's the best way to screw in a screw?
I'll say a screwdriver.
And they'll say,

351
00:21:56.321 --> 00:21:57.520
why didn't you say a saw?

352
00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.700
Well I don't have time to explain to you that the screwdriver you is the best

353
00:22:00.701 --> 00:22:05.170
tools that I've been considered rigid in my approach.

354
00:22:05.171 --> 00:22:09.400
But I'm not,
I've done a lot of trial and error.
But if you've got an ask me for,

355
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:13.510
uh,
a solution,
I'll tell you the quickest way to get there at all.

356
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:16.000
And I'll have time to educate everybody,
you know.

357
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:20.650
So in that with the neurotransmitter dominance,
how do you determine,

358
00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:25.540
or how does one determine
which category they fall into?

359
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:30.190
I actually,
I think,
I mean,
they've just been a lot of efforts clinically to do,

360
00:22:30.191 --> 00:22:35.080
let's say,
so I ever work or a year and work and even the labs we've done,

361
00:22:35.081 --> 00:22:39.460
the research says it's kind of a useless,
okay.

362
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:44.880
So if you look at catching Wilner who has won the cone of the Nobel Prize for

363
00:22:45.791 --> 00:22:49.720
functional medicine,
she is a big advocate of,
um,

364
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:54.210
the Braverman test,
which you could download for free.
Uh,

365
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:58.660
you just Google Eric Braverman the Braverman test and it's a multiple,

366
00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:03.310
uh,
at question answer type of format.

367
00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:04.930
And I thought she found,

368
00:23:04.931 --> 00:23:08.200
and so that bill bill echoes and over in your transmitter expert to find that to

369
00:23:08.201 --> 00:23:12.820
be the,
actually the most accurate test.
But you can only do it once in your life.

370
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.910
And because if you redo the questionnaire,

371
00:23:15.911 --> 00:23:17.240
you know the questions and then you'll,

372
00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:21.850
there'll be an internal bias to the answer.
But if you answer it truthfully,
um,

373
00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:26.970
and then what you find is that this true complete dominance is right,

374
00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:28.213
are rare,

375
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.470
but you will find that you say more firewood or what I call,

376
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.620
they'll pay me in us steel,
Coleen dependent.
So you need both.

377
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.620
And there's always a limiting factor when you did the test.
So you could have,

378
00:23:38.621 --> 00:23:42.480
let's say be Johnny Dopamine,
but you lacked Gaba.

379
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.860
So your biggest limiting,

380
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:48.360
you can't have what we call centered calmness,
you know,

381
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:52.010
which is what the gap I said a new transmitter for.
So,

382
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:56.960
or it could be dopamine dominant like Uber,
dopamine boy.

383
00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:00.020
But what happens is that you have the whole serotonin so you don't have any fun

384
00:24:00.021 --> 00:24:00.854
in your life.

385
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:04.670
And the fact that she did I though do you fun is actually a limiting factor to

386
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:08.090
your progress.
So I think,
you know,

387
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:13.490
they say know yourself.
Uh,
yeah,
that's the first thing you should do.
So I,

388
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.300
when I teach the class,
I make all my students do the test.

389
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:23.290
And then for three days I explain out to be individualized depending on what

390
00:24:24.571 --> 00:24:25.550
physical quality you want.

391
00:24:25.551 --> 00:24:28.610
So let's say if you want to get big and you don't bring the dependent aside

392
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:29.360
should do it.

393
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:34.360
And then I give the in between and then the most common comments is now the

394
00:24:36.211 --> 00:24:41.010
progress or achieve with my students or my clients as much faster.
And you know,

395
00:24:41.011 --> 00:24:43.500
for years,
I remember when I had my facility in Phoenix,

396
00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.860
I would have let's say 10 hockey player string at the same time and the guys

397
00:24:46.861 --> 00:24:51.520
will look at each other's program and they thought maybe at some favorite,
uh,

398
00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.950
everybody had their best program for them,
you know.
Uh,
so the,

399
00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:01.380
uh,
I think that's one of the keys to success.
I mean,

400
00:25:01.381 --> 00:25:03.780
there's a lot of ways to get there,

401
00:25:03.781 --> 00:25:07.560
but you got to find what's the best way for you,
you know?
Um,

402
00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.450
I mean if you go ahead.

403
00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:10.780
<v 1>Oh No,
I was just going to say,</v>

404
00:25:10.781 --> 00:25:13.510
I think you also touched on something that's very important,

405
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:18.340
which is the testing effect.
So you'll the in so many different areas of life,

406
00:25:18.341 --> 00:25:21.640
whether it's athletics,
academics,
uh,

407
00:25:21.641 --> 00:25:26.590
even very smart people make the mistake of looking at someone who say,

408
00:25:26.591 --> 00:25:31.180
or a cohort of people who take the same test multiple times and they assume that

409
00:25:31.181 --> 00:25:34.030
some type of intervention,
whether it's a supplement or a training program,

410
00:25:34.031 --> 00:25:37.060
is improving their performance.
But it's like,
no,
you have to,

411
00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.760
you have to at least ask the question,

412
00:25:39.761 --> 00:25:43.380
what if they're only getting better at the test?
Right?
And,
and that,
that,

413
00:25:43.381 --> 00:25:48.381
that I think that is probably has a lot of implications for diagnosis with,

414
00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.160
with athletes as well.
I don't,
I don't know,

415
00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:55.480
<v 4>but I mean yourself,
you had the epitome of self testing,
right?
So I mean,</v>

416
00:25:55.481 --> 00:25:58.330
that's one of your keys to success.

417
00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.020
You are willing to be the lab rat for all of us,
right?

418
00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:03.220
So the advantage with me is that bad,

419
00:26:03.221 --> 00:26:06.760
a lot of the lab rats who wanted to go the Olympics and I tried different
things,

420
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:07.810
but you know,

421
00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:11.950
one of the critiques I often get is you're not scientific or you don't like

422
00:26:11.951 --> 00:26:16.620
science.
Well,
here's my answers to these detractors

423
00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:22.320
clinical experience,
uh,
uh,
beats,

424
00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:27.840
uh,
uh,
research studies.
I'll give you an example.

425
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.700
In February,
2008,
in the Journal of applied a strength and conditioning,

426
00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:37.860
there was a paper cluster training and novel approach to strength training or

427
00:26:37.861 --> 00:26:42.650
the development of relative strength.
Okay.
That's February,
2008.

428
00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:46.560
I a new question training in 1975 was 14 years old.

429
00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:51.840
So if I use cluster training with all the sports where I needed relative

430
00:26:51.841 --> 00:26:54.060
strength,
I started to be a strength coach in [inaudible] 78.

431
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.280
So if you look at it,
uh,

432
00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:01.460
the difference between 78 and 2008 is very big and quite a few Olympics in

433
00:27:01.561 --> 00:27:04.320
between.
Right?
Do you agree?
So if you look at that,

434
00:27:04.321 --> 00:27:08.210
if I waited for research to do the right type of training that produced sounds

435
00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:13.120
like medalist,
I would have wasted about a few dozen Olympics.
So they,
yes,

436
00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:15.210
that winter and summer.

437
00:27:15.211 --> 00:27:19.230
So the point is that when the article came out,
I said,

438
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:23.490
that's an interesting,
it's novel in 2008.
So as my coach,

439
00:27:23.491 --> 00:27:26.010
where did you learn about cluster at training?
He says,

440
00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:30.780
I learned it in 68 in Paris.
And I said,
okay,

441
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.220
where do you think it came from?

442
00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:37.520
And we did some background research and we think it was first developed by our

443
00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:41.880
Bhag and coach in 1948.
Okay.

444
00:27:41.881 --> 00:27:44.540
So then we have about 60 years,
uh,

445
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:49.080
of between when the clinician develop the method and when the research was

446
00:27:49.081 --> 00:27:52.520
actually done.
Right.
So for example,
I used to,

447
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:57.830
early on had been recommended high doses or fish or 30 to 45 grams.

448
00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.440
And then the biggest amount of research,
uh,

449
00:28:01.441 --> 00:28:06.030
official news and research at the time was seven grams with the med school

450
00:28:06.031 --> 00:28:10.770
students.
And then I convinced Mark Houston,
he was an MD to use high dosages.

451
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:15.000
And then he says,
wow,
it's really good for dyslipidemia.
I blood pressure,

452
00:28:15.001 --> 00:28:19.260
cardiovascular risk,
and it doubled my business.
Why did it double Your Business?

453
00:28:19.261 --> 00:28:20.094
Mark Walters,

454
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:24.220
my patient's cells in fat and now people are coming in for fat loss and not for

455
00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.700
treating vascular disorders.

456
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:30.300
And five or seven years after I convinced them,

457
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:35.280
there was a Kenyan research paper that came out that said to treat obesity,

458
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.800
the best dose official was 60 grams.

459
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:43.870
And mark sent me an email and the title was clinicians always ahead of the curve

460
00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.630
and he says,
I don't know if you read the study.
And he showed it to me.

461
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:53.160
And then the interesting thing was is that why did I come up with 30 of the 45

462
00:28:53.161 --> 00:28:57.210
grams official?
Okay.
I did not have peered reviewed studies,

463
00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:01.620
but the human genome evolved most dramatically.

464
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:06.120
Once we got our Omega threes to 300 to 400 grams per week.
You know,

465
00:29:06.121 --> 00:29:11.121
we used to eat animal brains and we used to suck on femurs of analogs and stuff

466
00:29:12.151 --> 00:29:15.410
like that.
And when the human start to ingest a lot of Omega threes,

467
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.370
birth three Dha,

468
00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:20.250
our brains heal very fast when you're able to develop tools and so on.

469
00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:24.990
So a lot of the stuff I do may not be peer reviewed based,

470
00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:29.940
but in essence,
basic sciences,
basic science,
you know.

471
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:34.980
And then if you,
if your principles are sound,
then,
and

472
00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:41.570
to be frank,
I don't really give a shit about the detractors because,
you know,

473
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:45.610
uh,
research always back me up,
but sometimes 20 to 40 years after I had done it.

474
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.360
So clinic,
clinical experience,
uh,
you can't beat that.

475
00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:50.750
<v 1>Yeah.
And I,
and I,</v>

476
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:55.020
I think it's important also for people to realize that there's a value in a

477
00:29:55.021 --> 00:29:59.700
place for peer reviewed placebo controlled studies,
but they're also very slow.

478
00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.860
They require funding.
Uh,

479
00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:05.730
there are a lot of regulations and in different areas related to those types of

480
00:30:05.731 --> 00:30:09.540
studies.
And like you said,
science is not a,

481
00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:14.070
a study sciences.
Uh,
scientific thinking is scientific thinking,
right?
I mean,

482
00:30:14.071 --> 00:30:17.130
you're forming a hypothesis,
you're testing that hypothesis,

483
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:18.290
trying to disprove it,

484
00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.860
looking at alternative explanations for the outcome and kind of rinsing and

485
00:30:22.861 --> 00:30:24.960
repeating.
So I think that it's,
um,

486
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:29.880
there's a really good book on this called bad science by Guy Ben Goldacre that I

487
00:30:29.881 --> 00:30:34.120
think everybody should be required to read just so they can parse.
Um,

488
00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.860
it's kind of the sensationalist bullshit that they see in say the newspaper from

489
00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:42.570
what the real science actually says.
A quick question on the fish oil.
Is there

490
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:44.480
<v 4>just on that?
Furthermore,</v>

491
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:49.750
I think it should be a required reading to have a Facebook account because this

492
00:30:51.051 --> 00:30:55.130
way you would stop making those dumb comments if you had that book.

493
00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:00.050
And you know,
I agree 100% with you.

494
00:31:00.051 --> 00:31:03.440
The other thing too is that we don't know if one of the subjects did ecstasy on

495
00:31:03.441 --> 00:31:06.500
a weekend and stayed up,
you know,
there's a lot of shit and we can't control.
So,

496
00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:11.240
uh,
yes,
you do have to have a scientific basis to what you do.

497
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:12.830
And I'm in full agreement.

498
00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:19.520
<v 1>What's also kind of frustrating for me is that people give so much credence to</v>

499
00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:25.490
say long Longitudinal observational studies that are depending on people's self

500
00:31:25.601 --> 00:31:29.490
reporting,
when they can remember or misremember whenever they write down,

501
00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:34.350
but they discount the sort of small sample size experimental studies that,

502
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.770
for instance,
you've been doing with athletes for decades.
Uh,
it's very,

503
00:31:37.771 --> 00:31:42.510
very frustrating.
Um,
but the,
um,
quick question on the,
on the fish oil is a,

504
00:31:42.511 --> 00:31:44.370
is there any risk of,
uh,

505
00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:49.570
any type of intestinal bleeding or anything like that with extremely high,
uh,

506
00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:53.370
what,
what most people would consider high dosages of fish oil.
Wow.

507
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:54.870
<v 4>And they're seen it.</v>

508
00:31:54.871 --> 00:31:59.160
But when I use fish oil in high dosages,

509
00:31:59.161 --> 00:32:00.960
I never use it more than six months.

510
00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:05.580
The reason why I found that I don't need to go along to six months is six
months.

511
00:32:05.581 --> 00:32:07.410
You should have attained your body composition goal,

512
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:11.880
but if you do free fatty acid profiles,
uh,
on a regular basis,

513
00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:14.970
you find that after six months everything is pretty well set.

514
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:19.140
And then you only need a maintenance.
And if the person eats a lot of wild meat,

515
00:32:19.141 --> 00:32:24.000
a lot of,
uh,
c products,
I give them no fish oil.
So for example,

516
00:32:24.001 --> 00:32:27.630
myself,
uh,
from May to October,

517
00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:33.170
I don't take any official because back home I eat the wild meat.

518
00:32:33.301 --> 00:32:36.690
I like to eat the fish,
blah,
blah,
blah.
But of course if I go to England,

519
00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.100
where there a set of stage is more

520
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:44.050
<v 5>like a hockey puck,
you won't,</v>

521
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:47.890
you're that good at we get three supply.
But even,
you know,

522
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:52.900
I get regular blood work and I found that for me at age 54 when I'm on a fish or

523
00:32:54.031 --> 00:32:58.330
a program,
it's two grams a day,
which is nothing,
right?

524
00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:03.700
But you know the every single gene in the human genome as a receptor site for

525
00:33:04.551 --> 00:33:09.230
when we get threes.
So Margaret Basketball,
he taught me this in 94,
he says,

526
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:13.070
if you look at any medical scientific database,

527
00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:18.250
it is impossible not to find the study where we get three LEDs,

528
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:22.250
symptoms of all disease known to man.
And I said,
that was bullshit.

529
00:33:22.251 --> 00:33:26.840
So yet there is on database yet 8 million scientific references.

530
00:33:26.841 --> 00:33:30.500
It's just punch in whatever you want.
So Punch Preeclampsia.

531
00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:35.600
I tried to come up with anything you'd like,
add,
Adhd,
uh,

532
00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:41.120
try Somik children,
whatever.
And then in every single,

533
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:42.560
uh,
ailment,

534
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:47.390
I punched in with the keyword and we get three F on at least one study.
Okay.

535
00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.430
But I read the,
the,
the,

536
00:33:49.431 --> 00:33:52.700
the test two years ago and the minimum amount of Steve's I found,

537
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.650
whereas the beneficial outcome with,

538
00:33:54.651 --> 00:33:59.540
and we go through therapy was 14 for any disease I could punch in.
So,

539
00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.950
uh,
you know,

540
00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:06.220
the 3:00 AM I get three and thyroid aren't necessary for every gene in the human

541
00:34:06.351 --> 00:34:10.790
genome.
That's what we know so far.
Uh,
it's probably more,
but,
um,

542
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:15.950
uh,
as far as intestinal bleeding,
clinically I've used very high dosages,

543
00:34:15.951 --> 00:34:19.940
like 60 grams and,
and there were seen it,
but maybe it's the,

544
00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:20.990
whoever you work with,

545
00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:25.940
I tend to work with healthier than average,

546
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.390
uh,
population.
And,
but then again,

547
00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:31.130
according to Dr Rakowski,

548
00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.790
only two to 3% of Americans would be considered healthy.

549
00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:43.080
<v 1>Yeah.
The net death.
Speaking of,
um,
you,
you mentioned Margie Pasquale,
so he,</v>

550
00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.240
I think introduced me first to what he,

551
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:50.070
what he was calling the anabolic diet when I was back,
when I was in high school.

552
00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.620
Uh,
which,
if I'm remembering correctly,

553
00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:56.610
it was on some level of cyclical ketogenic diet.

554
00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:00.560
A Am I,
I don't think I'm butchering that,
but no.

555
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:05.870
I was also introduced to your writing through muscle media 2000 way back in the

556
00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.900
early days.
Uh,
what have you changed your mind about over time?
What are a,

557
00:35:12.901 --> 00:35:15.690
what are things that you've most change,
changed your mind about over,

558
00:35:15.691 --> 00:35:18.090
over the last decade or two?

559
00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:22.130
<v 5>The most important thing that I've learned about nutrition is you need to</v>

560
00:35:22.131 --> 00:35:23.180
deserve your cars.

561
00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:29.080
So if you look at the world average carbohydrate intake should be about 40% that

562
00:35:30.471 --> 00:35:33.890
would be healthy cardboard.
But it's the average.
It's not the individual.

563
00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:38.000
So if you the language in any way from Tuktoyaktuk and

564
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.330
<v 4>Nick [inaudible],
north
Lt carbohydrate intake forms,</v>

565
00:35:42.331 --> 00:35:47.310
probably 2% because each whale blubber and Arvold a seal and so on.

566
00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:51.210
So I had a guy who played in the Ahl use fat and it should,
you know,

567
00:35:51.211 --> 00:35:53.490
you're a native,
uh,
inward.

568
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.800
Why don't you eat like a native intuit when you go back home?

569
00:35:55.830 --> 00:36:00.540
And he went and he went from something like a 21% body fat to a 6% body fat

570
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:05.010
eating 70% fat and 30% protein and zero carbohydrates.
Right?

571
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:07.490
So I find that you,

572
00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:11.640
you have to figure out what your set point for carbohydrates,
but most people,

573
00:36:11.641 --> 00:36:16.110
the too many carbohydrates are actually drink too when you carb or grades.

574
00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:19.310
And then the carburetors would eat the wrong type.

575
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:23.820
People perceive me as a cardboard read Nazi and not,
you know,

576
00:36:23.821 --> 00:36:25.110
our [inaudible] Nancy.

577
00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:29.640
The thing is is that I got some athletes who do best on 70% carbs,

578
00:36:29.641 --> 00:36:33.990
20% protein,
10% fat,
but they deserve their carbohydrates.

579
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.730
They got a great pancreas.

580
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:38.340
The insulin sensitive about if you've got a lot of muscle mass,

581
00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.380
but some athletes,
you know,

582
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.770
they are allowed 10 licks of a dried prune every six months.
That's,

583
00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:48.210
that's all they deserve.
And that's all they will get.
And after six months,

584
00:36:48.211 --> 00:36:52.650
they're actually allowed to look at calendar pictures of cakes once a week.

585
00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:54.240
But,
but I think that the,

586
00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:56.100
<v 3>the most important they learned from Mario is that</v>

587
00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.730
I remember asking my Arrow this question,

588
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:03.760
he is one of the best people I've ever had the chance,
you know,

589
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.340
and the honor to talk to.
And he told me,

590
00:37:05.341 --> 00:37:08.790
he says in nutrition there's what we call the 70% rule.

591
00:37:08.791 --> 00:37:10.500
And I find that to be true and training,

592
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:14.970
70% of the advice is good for 70% and 7%.

593
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:19.980
The advice is only good for 70% of the population and the IGA 15% on each side,

594
00:37:19.981 --> 00:37:20.820
there are outliers.

595
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:26.270
So the 70% rule for carbohydrates should be 40% if URL.

596
00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:33.240
Okay.
And then some of the guys do very well on 70%.

597
00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:36.330
Okay?
So,
uh,
I think that you,

598
00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:41.430
you have to monitor yourself if things like your morning insulin,

599
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:46.440
your morning glucose,
you're reactive insulin test you,
HB one ac,

600
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:51.480
you do those four tests and you start with a starting point.
And,

601
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.290
uh,

602
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:57.290
you do these tests for the every eight weeks would be enough.

603
00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:02.130
And then you'll find what's best for you.
That's what I tell my students do.
Um,

604
00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:05.910
and then it could you elaborate on the,
each of those tests just so people can,

605
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.280
uh,
and we'll put this in the show notes as well,
but I think,

606
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:12.030
I think people would love to know,
uh,
if you could just go through those,

607
00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:16.650
those bullets and just describe a little bit for context each of those.
Well,

608
00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:20.030
the purpose of each of those tests,
well,
morning glucose,
morning insulin,

609
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:23.610
you know,
our base old tests.
So the,
it gives you a reference value.

610
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:28.290
But one thing you have to be wary of is what we call the norms.

611
00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:32.640
When you think norms,
you should think of homer Simpson.
Okay.
So for example,

612
00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:33.840
morning glucose,

613
00:38:33.841 --> 00:38:38.841
the norms to most American labs is 70 to 99 in the morning.

614
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:42.580
Okay.
That's after a 12 hour fast.
The problem is,

615
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:47.880
is that your risk of cardiovascular disease increases 5% after every single

616
00:38:50.741 --> 00:38:52.690
digit above 70.
So in other words,

617
00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.980
you could have 99 and be in a normal range,

618
00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:01.800
but your cardiovascular risk is actually 145% greater than thought it was 70.

619
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:07.150
Right.
So there's a difference between normal and optimal.
Okay.

620
00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:12.130
So,
uh,
I'd rather you have 70 than to be between 70 and 99.

621
00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:16.990
The next value I'd like to check is,
um,
HB one AC,

622
00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:21.550
which is basically measures how much you're emo Globan,

623
00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:26.020
which is your oxygen carrying molecule has been damaged by glucose.

624
00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:31.240
And then,
uh,
when,
depending on the country,
you know,

625
00:39:31.241 --> 00:39:34.870
the alarm point is set differently.
Some people's FivePoint lines,

626
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:35.920
we will sit 6.9.

627
00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.060
But the truth of the matter is the lower your score is a bit of this,

628
00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:41.380
then it means you have less damage done to your hemoglobin.

629
00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:46.240
But what's interesting is that,
you know,
when you cut it,

630
00:39:46.241 --> 00:39:49.630
it's a lie detector test for cardboard read intake.
In other words,

631
00:39:49.631 --> 00:39:53.380
you come to see me unless he bring a friend who was obese and he said,
Charles,

632
00:39:53.381 --> 00:39:53.861
take care of him.

633
00:39:53.861 --> 00:39:58.861
And I do that test and he's 5.9 and he goes on a low carb diet and he shows up

634
00:39:59.111 --> 00:40:04.111
at 6.16 weeks later while he's a bullshit artist because you know that you

635
00:40:05.501 --> 00:40:06.910
cannot fake that test.

636
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:12.630
So one thing that I've found over the years is that actually the amount of

637
00:40:12.851 --> 00:40:17.080
magnesium supplemental magnesium you consume is the fastest way to drop that

638
00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:21.700
value.
So magnesium is probably one of the best anti aging minerals.

639
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:26.650
And they say that basically you age at the rate you produce insulin.

640
00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.040
So the HB one ac will tell me what,

641
00:40:30.041 --> 00:40:33.130
what was the average insulin or the last three months,
you know,

642
00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:34.500
so that's a good key.

643
00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:39.580
Another test I really like is the reactive insulin tests.

644
00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:42.950
So you submit blood,
uh,

645
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:47.820
for the morning draw at any two rice cakes with um,

646
00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:51.130
jam on it.
Uh,
let's say a tablespoon or Jen,

647
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:56.320
and then you wait one hour and you measure your post Prandial insulin.

648
00:40:56.321 --> 00:41:01.000
So after the meal,
and then that value should be about between 12 and 17.

649
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:02.380
If it's above that,

650
00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:06.310
you could have norming normal morning insulin.

651
00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:10.540
But the problem is,
is that normal morning incident,

652
00:41:10.541 --> 00:41:15.100
he's like having a normal ECG is quite possible that you have a normal ECG at

653
00:41:15.101 --> 00:41:18.980
rest,
but you exercise for 10 seconds and you received g is all over the place,

654
00:41:18.981 --> 00:41:23.950
right?
So,
uh,
an Oregon,
you can only see it's really healthy if you stress it.

655
00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.120
Okay.

656
00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.580
So when you give a dose and really fast carbohydrates in the morning and you'd

657
00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:33.560
skip insulin goes through the roof,
it means that you don't have a good pantry

658
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.450
<v 5>pancake,
pancreatic health and your insulin resistance is a rendered.</v>

659
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:41.810
So I liked that test,
but we found,
for example,

660
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:46.190
in a lot of physique competitors,
they got great morning,
uh,

661
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:50.840
glucose and insulin.
But when you can do to reactive test,
they fail miserably.
So,

662
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:53.660
you know,
so what the,

663
00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:58.040
a lot of things that make them lean is not actually so healthy for them.

664
00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:03.340
So I think the reactive insulin test is the most underrated tests,

665
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:06.620
uh,
in health.

666
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:11.870
And how should people select their doctor?

667
00:42:11.871 --> 00:42:14.000
The person that will help them administer these tests?

668
00:42:14.001 --> 00:42:16.550
Because you and I know there's,
there's the good,
the bad and the ugly.

669
00:42:16.551 --> 00:42:20.570
I remember this MD friend of mine said p equals MD and pass equals MD.

670
00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:23.560
And Yeah,
there are a lot of shitty doctors out there.

671
00:42:23.561 --> 00:42:25.700
There are also some great doctors.
But how,

672
00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:30.950
how would you suggest someone find a doctor who can competently administer and

673
00:42:30.951 --> 00:42:32.090
interpret these tests?

674
00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:35.930
I think the best way to find them over the years is that go through a

675
00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:39.830
[inaudible] dot org so it's the American college for advancement of medicine.

676
00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:45.130
It's the college that certifies people do chelation therapy,
uh,

677
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.940
to treat vascular disease.

678
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:52.070
What I found is that the guys who have an interest for that therapy tend to have

679
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:54.620
an interest on functional medicine.
So there's a good,

680
00:42:54.621 --> 00:42:57.410
it's a good cross reference.
It's not 100%,

681
00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:02.890
but when I tell my students we're asking the exact same question as you to do

682
00:43:03.501 --> 00:43:07.130
that,
the,
in more than nine out of 10 cases,

683
00:43:07.131 --> 00:43:11.180
they report that they're very happy with that new doctor.
Um,
the thing is,

684
00:43:11.181 --> 00:43:16.181
is that the length of time they spent with you on the first visit is bar you

685
00:43:16.701 --> 00:43:17.534
best indicator.

686
00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:21.410
I find the best doctors out there take about two hours to do a medical history.

687
00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:27.020
Uh,
another way to find a good one is just ask around.
I mean,
when people ask me,

688
00:43:27.021 --> 00:43:29.590
he said,
do you know somebody here?
And I said,
yeah,
I don't know God.

689
00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:34.280
So in most large American cities,
I find some of what,
for example,

690
00:43:34.281 --> 00:43:39.080
recently I had a student of mine from Luxembourg,
uh,

691
00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:44.140
was an MD and I got talking to them and I I realize are way ahead of the curve.

692
00:43:44.151 --> 00:43:48.200
You was.
So there was,
you know,
a lot of students in a classroom,

693
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:50.180
14 different or European countries and say,
hey,

694
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:52.850
you guys are looking for a good doctor,
go see him.

695
00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:57.980
And then a female doctor from the Netherlands and she was very open minded and

696
00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:03.320
you know,
she really was looking at different way to treat are patients.

697
00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:07.160
And then I,
so I found somebody in the,
and then so the,

698
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:09.920
there's a lot of good people,
but the best is to ask around.

699
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:13.970
But one of the key points is that they don't do a two hour medical history,

700
00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:18.440
uh,
you know,
at the right place.
Yeah.
I know.
This is,
this is,
uh,

701
00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:21.950
I think worth digging into a little bit because,
uh,
for instance,
I mean,

702
00:44:21.951 --> 00:44:24.920
one of the red flags for me,
and I'm not a doctor,
don't play one on the Internet,

703
00:44:24.921 --> 00:44:29.590
but I've,
I've broken myself enough and done enough experiments that I've,
I've,

704
00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.010
I've,
uh,
had a chance to sample a

705
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.460
<v 1>lot of doctors at the kind of medical buffet.
And,
uh,</v>

706
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:40.610
whenever I have someone respond very definitively to a single blood test,

707
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:45.090
I always get very worried.
They,
if they don't ask if I had anything to drink,

708
00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:49.170
if I didn't,
if I did or did not do a workout before the test,

709
00:44:49.171 --> 00:44:52.110
if they don't ask some of those questions,
uh,

710
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:55.710
and they're simply trying to prescribe some type of medication,
say to address,

711
00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.190
uh,
slightly depressed testosterone,
well,
they're,

712
00:44:59.191 --> 00:45:00.660
they're not doing their homework right.

713
00:45:00.661 --> 00:45:03.200
They're not really doing their detective work properly.
Um,

714
00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.730
at least that's my preference.

715
00:45:05.731 --> 00:45:09.930
But are there any other kind of red flags or a pet peeves that you would use to

716
00:45:09.931 --> 00:45:11.130
disqualify doctors?

717
00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.870
<v 4>Well,
I would truly agree with you is a classic example.</v>

718
00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:18.670
There's someone that you and I both know,
uh,
sends me an email of freaking out.

719
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:23.500
He's been diagnosed with cardiovascular disease,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And I said,

720
00:45:23.501 --> 00:45:26.800
sending your blood work.
So he sends it to me,
and again,
I'm not a doctor,

721
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:28.690
but Ashton,
hey,

722
00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:33.430
let me get you ate before the test and he had a 36 set,

723
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:38.650
12 reps per workout,
uh,
per exercise before you did the test.
And he goes,

724
00:45:38.651 --> 00:45:42.490
how'd you know?
Well,
because of blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And I said,

725
00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:43.930
that test is not valid.

726
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:48.850
Redo the test 12 hour fast and then sent to me and I'll find you the right

727
00:45:48.851 --> 00:45:52.820
doctors.
So,
you know,
the point is,
is that the doctor read the test,

728
00:45:52.821 --> 00:45:55.600
told he was going to die.
I said,
no,

729
00:45:55.601 --> 00:45:58.780
because you're biased to test by doing these two stupid things.

730
00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:01.120
And the doctor should have asked you,
did you exercise?

731
00:46:01.121 --> 00:46:04.900
Did you eat before the meal?
Was that,
uh,
you know,
whatever.
So,
um,

732
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:09.160
it,
I agree with you 100%.
Yeah.
I mean the,

733
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:12.970
there's some basic questions they should ask to eliminate error.
You know,

734
00:46:12.971 --> 00:46:17.470
one thing that I insist on is that the always do at 12,

735
00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:20.530
exactly 12 hours after the last bite.
Why?

736
00:46:20.531 --> 00:46:24.940
Because they want pre and post measures there are valid because you know,

737
00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:25.600
you could,

738
00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:28.890
you group morning glucose could be all over the place because you fasted and

739
00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:31.180
extra two hours and it's not valid.

740
00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:33.600
<v 1>Yeah,
totally agree.
And this is,
this is I,</v>

741
00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:37.190
and I don't want to harp on this too much,
but I think it's really important.

742
00:46:37.191 --> 00:46:41.300
So it's worth underscoring for people and that is the,

743
00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.300
well let me bitch for a second first and that the,

744
00:46:44.301 --> 00:46:47.540
the same people who would criticize you for not,
uh,

745
00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:52.810
sort of walking a strict line with clinical studies when the same people who

746
00:46:53.091 --> 00:46:56.480
don't pay attention to any of these variables when they're dealing with their

747
00:46:56.481 --> 00:46:58.760
patients directly.
And it's just,

748
00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:03.110
it makes me insane because you have to control these variables.
Like you said,

749
00:47:03.111 --> 00:47:03.411
it can't,

750
00:47:03.411 --> 00:47:07.470
you can't have one blood test six hours after you ate because you had a late

751
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:11.030
night,
need a burrito after getting shit faced and then the next time do it on a

752
00:47:11.031 --> 00:47:13.640
Wednesday after no drinking after 12 hour fast.

753
00:47:13.641 --> 00:47:17.300
You those that's apples to oranges and you're not going to be able to get any

754
00:47:17.301 --> 00:47:21.700
good data out of that.
Um,
but the,
um,
for,

755
00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:25.650
for people out there,
I mean,
the one thing that I've always asked friends,
because

756
00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:30.670
people come to me just as they are,
your friends come to you and they're like,

757
00:47:30.671 --> 00:47:35.230
oh my God,
I'm freaking out.
My doctor wants to do a,
B,
c,
d,
and e.
And like I said,

758
00:47:35.231 --> 00:47:39.010
everybody just so,
so I don't have to deal with the stupid,
um,
legal issues.

759
00:47:39.011 --> 00:47:42.820
I'm not a doctor,
but what,
what,
what,
what I'll,
well,
I'll ask is I'll say,
well,

760
00:47:42.821 --> 00:47:45.610
when did you take,
what day of the week did you take the last test?

761
00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:48.520
And when did you take this test?
And,
and Lo and behold,

762
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:53.630
it's almost always like after a shitty three days of of sleep or it's after a

763
00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:58.780
binge drinking for two nights and their testosterone drops 200 points.

764
00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:02.380
And also the blood test was done at say like 10:00 AM instead of 8:00 AM.

765
00:48:02.381 --> 00:48:05.700
And I'm like,
all right,
well
you can't,

766
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:10.270
you have to have some standardization for these numbers to be meaningful in any

767
00:48:10.271 --> 00:48:11.300
way.
It's

768
00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:14.660
<v 3>very true because I'll call for example,</v>

769
00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:19.670
I used to train a lot of pro athletes,
but they would add,

770
00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:22.130
let's say a stag party in Vegas.

771
00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:28.580
What's goes on in Vegas stays in Vegas,
but by Monday when he gave blood work,

772
00:48:28.581 --> 00:48:30.980
I could tell they were in Vegas just you know,

773
00:48:30.981 --> 00:48:34.640
and there's things like for example in massage could throw your CPA through the

774
00:48:34.641 --> 00:48:37.760
roof if it was fairly aggressive.
And until I'll say,
well,
you know,

775
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:42.830
you have a kidney issue or whatever,
they,
their biases.
And for example,

776
00:48:42.831 --> 00:48:47.330
in the liver enzymes,
I get this one all the time.
My liver enzymes are elevated.

777
00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:51.080
So then I tell,
I send this study from Sweden,

778
00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:56.410
people lift weights three days a week of chronically 20% higher than normal

779
00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:01.340
elevations in liver enzymes and it's non pathological.

780
00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:06.290
So essay short out to your doctor before they put you on some liver drug.

781
00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:11.120
You know?
So the thing that always said,
it's not the doctor's fault,

782
00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:14.740
the,
like you said,
p equals MV.

783
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:19.750
So the thing is is that they're not forced to keep up with the literature.

784
00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:24.320
And we know that the books they study in medical school or only nine years,

785
00:49:24.321 --> 00:49:28.380
our data's,
for example,
if you look at blesses this ominous,
if you look at,

786
00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:32.150
we look at what was that the last dyssomnias one of the intestinal,

787
00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:34.610
a pathogen you,

788
00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:39.560
according to the most recent book in pairs analogy,
it's not bad for you.

789
00:49:39.561 --> 00:49:40.520
You should not be treated.

790
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:45.910
But this good studies done on Iraq war veterans that show that that,

791
00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:50.990
uh,
intentional pathogen leads to degeneration of eyesight,

792
00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:55.460
but because it blocks the absorption of vitamin A and it also leads to

793
00:49:56.060 --> 00:50:00.530
degeneration of joints.
But there's two good papers are published in 94.

794
00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:05.540
They're not in the book of Prose Otology but so we're looking in 2015 and the

795
00:50:06.981 --> 00:50:11.030
researcher was done any four and it's not even in the current books that medical

796
00:50:11.031 --> 00:50:14.670
students read.
So a lot of people have,
you know,

797
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:19.750
good and bad eyesight or osteoarthritis from untreated intestinal pathogen.

798
00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:24.440
And then it tells me there's no research on that,
that there is research.
I mean,

799
00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:28.970
one of the most common comment is there's no research that dude did you hear?

800
00:50:28.971 --> 00:50:31.180
He didn't try to look at it.
So

801
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:35.570
yeah.
And then there's,
for example,

802
00:50:35.571 --> 00:50:39.890
there was some guy on arping on that my doses are losing,

803
00:50:39.891 --> 00:50:42.110
were too high.
There were not backed up by research.

804
00:50:42.111 --> 00:50:47.111
Well the two best research papers on leucine in really hard training people were

805
00:50:47.421 --> 00:50:49.790
done by the same goober researchers in France.

806
00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:54.020
They only publish the results in French.
So I can't blame him for the guy to see.

807
00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:56.810
You didn't read,
you could say,
I didn't read anything on it.

808
00:50:56.811 --> 00:51:00.560
But to say that doesn't exist is lie because it did exist,
you know,

809
00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:01.371
<v 1>where,</v>

810
00:51:01.371 --> 00:51:06.371
where are your favorite sort of go to sources for doing searches for research?

811
00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:10.770
I mean there's pub bed of course.
Uh,
but,
but um,
w what,

812
00:51:10.771 --> 00:51:13.320
what are sort of your goto top sources?

813
00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.420
<v 3>Actually my top sources pub med.</v>

814
00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:20.220
But the thing is is that you have to learn a few things about how to search.

815
00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:24.690
For example,
she Shandor Berry,
which is a greater,
uh,

816
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:29.340
to treat,
uh,
too much oxidation in the liver.
Right?
Well,

817
00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:33.630
does 88 synonyms for it in the literature,
if you look at,

818
00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:36.900
uh,
only Bazell,

819
00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:38.910
it has so many different names.

820
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.980
So what I use is a proc called the natural,
uh,

821
00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:48.660
database.
And then they give you all the synonyms for each,
uh,

822
00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:52.220
natural compounds.
And then I search under,
uh,

823
00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:53.820
the different ones because for example,

824
00:51:53.821 --> 00:51:58.290
for only Bazell you can find a lot of research,
but the,
the,

825
00:51:58.291 --> 00:52:01.840
um,
it's not,
it's not the,

826
00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:05.610
this is the most commonly used name in English,

827
00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:09.000
but you have to look under the different Indian names for it to find all the

828
00:52:09.001 --> 00:52:09.301
research.

829
00:52:09.301 --> 00:52:14.220
Because a lot of research that clinically on it was done in India or done in

830
00:52:14.221 --> 00:52:18.830
Thailand and it's peer reviewed,
but it only use Oli basles a keyword.

831
00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:20.010
So you know,

832
00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:25.020
you the natural medical database is a good tool for finding out the synonyms if

833
00:52:25.021 --> 00:52:26.670
you're looking at a nutrient,

834
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:32.390
but the nobody beats pub med in my opinion.

835
00:52:32.711 --> 00:52:33.120
Yeah,

836
00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:33.451
<v 1>it's,</v>

837
00:52:33.451 --> 00:52:38.451
this is really excellent advice and I just want to kind of reiterate for folks

838
00:52:39.841 --> 00:52:44.430
that you,
you have to search for the synonyms and not only that,
I mean,

839
00:52:44.431 --> 00:52:44.971
so for instance,

840
00:52:44.971 --> 00:52:48.720
you can take like Alpha lipoic acid and then thioctic acid or whatever.
Yeah.
But,

841
00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:53.340
but not only that,
but like you said,
if you have studies being done in say India,

842
00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:55.200
uh,
with ayurvedic medicine,

843
00:52:55.201 --> 00:52:58.980
like what are the herbs that contain a lot of fill in the blank,
right?

844
00:52:58.981 --> 00:53:02.580
So you can find these natural sources,
which then are also sometimes studied,

845
00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:05.940
even if the isolated nutrients aren't studied.
And it sounds like a lot of work,

846
00:53:05.941 --> 00:53:06.780
but it's not,

847
00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:12.380
it's not that time consuming once you just have each step one for the checklist.

848
00:53:12.661 --> 00:53:15.090
There's a great book called the checklist manifesto that I thought,
Oh yeah,

849
00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:17.070
oh yeah,
yeah,
that's one of my favorite books.
Uh,

850
00:53:17.071 --> 00:53:20.760
so good by a tool go on day who's an MD?
And so it's like,

851
00:53:20.761 --> 00:53:22.920
what is your checklist for doing research?
It's like,
okay,
number one,

852
00:53:22.921 --> 00:53:25.470
go to natural database,
find some synonyms,
right?

853
00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:29.880
Then go to a pub med and do this following search.
And then if you've read,

854
00:53:29.881 --> 00:53:34.020
say that a bad medicine,
it's like,
okay,
what filters do I run this through?

855
00:53:34.021 --> 00:53:37.110
What are the five to 10 questions that I ask myself to make sure I don't fool

856
00:53:37.111 --> 00:53:40.830
myself?
Right?
You know,
is this interview,
how was it delivered?
Right?

857
00:53:40.831 --> 00:53:44.040
You can't just take oral dosages and,
uh,

858
00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:47.970
or intravenous dosages and assume that you're gonna get the same effect from

859
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.190
oral consumption.
Right?

860
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:54.420
A question for you on hormone replacement therapy.

861
00:53:54.421 --> 00:53:59.310
So a lot of,
a lot of people are fascinated by hormone replacement therapy.
Um,
uh,

862
00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:04.320
how have your thoughts on hormone replacement therapy changed or evolved?
Uh,

863
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:07.800
and,
and we could make it specific to guys,
but we don't have to.
It's a,

864
00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:12.330
<v 5>well,
I think that there's a stronger place for it than ever before because</v>

865
00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:19.430
you know,
people ask you,
well,
it's not natural,
blah,
blah,
blah.

866
00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:22.260
Okay.
All right,
let's go back a second year.

867
00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:28.010
One thing that distinguishes humans from animals is goal setting and progress.

868
00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:33.600
Okay?
So I don't think eagles gather up together in January said,

869
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:34.471
okay,

870
00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:39.471
this year that's eat 78% more rats and I want to expand.

871
00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:44.880
So the animals that do are animals,
they do what they do,

872
00:54:44.881 --> 00:54:48.100
but we were whoever you want to blame for it.

873
00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:50.610
We're blessed with a brain that can learn a new vault.

874
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.040
And then the reality is is,

875
00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:56.400
and this is the World Health Organization statistics,

876
00:54:56.790 --> 00:55:01.790
just average testosterone level as decreased 1% per year since 1950 so what was

877
00:55:03.181 --> 00:55:08.181
considered good to Starstone levels and an enormous tend to change per country.

878
00:55:08.191 --> 00:55:12.240
So for example,
a Dj sulfate in the UK,

879
00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:17.360
if you have 1.6 to 1.8 it's good if you have 1.9 is considered to have high

880
00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:21.840
elevated androgens.
But in Canada,
the norms are three to 10.

881
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:24.540
So if you're a British male at 1.9,

882
00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:27.180
you don't exist in the medical alarms and gather,
okay.

883
00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:31.260
So you don't qualify as a male.
Uh,
it may be a male in the UK,
but you know what,

884
00:55:31.261 --> 00:55:36.180
a male in Canada,
so I show the reality is that,
okay,

885
00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:38.970
we,
we've softened up on the norms,

886
00:55:38.971 --> 00:55:43.680
but we should look at optimal versus a normal.
Right?

887
00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:46.350
So with hormone therapy,

888
00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:50.100
one thing I'll also knows who I have a hundred times more stressed than our

889
00:55:50.101 --> 00:55:53.760
grandparents.
Our grandparents didn't have iPhones.

890
00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:58.620
It didn't have to answer 70 emails an hour,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
So,
uh,

891
00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.000
and there's also the radiation,

892
00:56:00.001 --> 00:56:03.930
which is now more and more well documented and all these things,
uh,

893
00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:08.790
suppress testosterone.
So hit I think is viable,

894
00:56:08.791 --> 00:56:12.300
but yet it's like your carbohydrates,
you need to deserve it.
So for example,

895
00:56:12.301 --> 00:56:15.690
I see a lot of kids who go on growth hormone and that they're still making

896
00:56:15.691 --> 00:56:16.524
plenty.

897
00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:20.610
And by doing growth from too early to actually shutting down their production.

898
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:24.280
Same thing with testosterone,
but the,

899
00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:29.080
the attitude varies a lot from country to country.
For example,

900
00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:33.830
there used to be a drug,
uh,
in France called parabolics,

901
00:56:33.831 --> 00:56:37.570
just trembling.
I forget the uh,
exactly extra.

902
00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:40.150
But if you look in the companion in the 80s,

903
00:56:40.650 --> 00:56:43.720
they would encourage doctors to give the kids who were bullied at school.

904
00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:51.260
<v 6>Oh my God.
So basically they said yes,
it was different.
Like,
okay,</v>

905
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:54.060
the kid has a little muscle mass,
low self esteem,
put him on tremble,

906
00:56:55.410 --> 00:56:58.370
know an American doctor that would do that,

907
00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:01.910
would get castrated and sent to jail for 40 years.

908
00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:04.360
Just to put this in perspective for people,
so tremble,

909
00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:06.350
and correct me if I'm wrong,
I'm pretty,

910
00:57:06.351 --> 00:57:09.300
it's hard for a lot of people to come by who are say like worldclass

911
00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:10.520
powerlifters.
So they'll take,

912
00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:15.790
they'll take capsules that are intended to be injected into cattle and basically

913
00:57:16.761 --> 00:57:19.760
in a,
dissolve them into a liquid so they can inject them.
And this was,

914
00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:22.840
this was prescribed to children and are getting bullied.
That

915
00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:28.370
<v 5>terminal in bodybuilding world,
the profiting rules one of the most potent drugs.</v>

916
00:57:28.371 --> 00:57:30.380
Right.
But the attitude was very different.

917
00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:35.520
It is a friend of mine who's a pharmacist who has actually studied that,

918
00:57:35.661 --> 00:57:38.210
that the concept,

919
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:41.990
and he said like attitude towards drugs is very different.
For example,

920
00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:44.630
in lot of South American countries,

921
00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:49.100
they think that putting stem cells all and multivitamins for kids is good so

922
00:57:49.101 --> 00:57:54.010
they can gain weight.
But the thing with uh,
HRT,

923
00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:54.331
what,

924
00:57:54.331 --> 00:57:57.500
what I see is that a lot of people jump on a bandwagon because they can make

925
00:57:57.501 --> 00:58:02.030
money in up in church,
you know,
horrendous price with testosterone and then,

926
00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:06.960
which is mixed cost,
$2 a sec to make any charge you $150 a season.

927
00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.740
But the,
the,
um,

928
00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:14.240
the therapies that I would say in the US is probably the three guys I know how

929
00:58:14.241 --> 00:58:19.160
to do it properly.
And so if I'm an executive that says to me,
you know,

930
00:58:19.161 --> 00:58:22.340
my testosterone was the same as a Catholic,

931
00:58:22.570 --> 00:58:24.530
a church mouse,

932
00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:28.850
what could I do while I send them to these three dots?
And He'd do a good job.

933
00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:33.020
But they,
the,
uh,
it takes monitoring.

934
00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:35.420
You have to monitor for your estrogens,

935
00:58:35.421 --> 00:58:39.030
you have to align it to your cardiovascular risk factors.
And so on.
Uh,

936
00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:40.910
but if it's done properly,
it's very good.

937
00:58:40.911 --> 00:58:45.911
I think the more exciting real now is actually the use of peptides.

938
00:58:48.110 --> 00:58:52.590
Um,
but the peptides,
it's the,

939
00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:54.510
the frontier right now,
you know,
everybody,

940
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:57.080
but I've met a guy in Australia recently,

941
00:58:57.650 --> 00:59:00.080
probably has done the most clinical research on it.

942
00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:05.770
And when he explained to me odd to use them is view on how to use them at a time

943
00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:12.390
was diametrically opposite to what the cowboys on your net recommend.

944
00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:18.350
But,
but when I was in the waiting room,

945
00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:23.650
it was the WHO's who have the strength world was waiting for that point.

946
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:28.970
So obviously he's clinical experience was very good.
And then,
um,

947
00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:33.110
but he was really,
really far ahead.
But for example,

948
00:59:33.111 --> 00:59:35.480
for repairing joints,
you know,

949
00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:40.460
this two peptides are getting lock the,
and he worked very well.

950
00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:42.800
Uh,
now they're just for research purposes,

951
00:59:42.801 --> 00:59:46.040
but I think that HRIT if it's done properly,

952
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:50.240
it's quite validated as long as you're not in a,
uh,

953
00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:51.730
drug tested sporting.

954
00:59:51.731 --> 00:59:56.731
If you're a 40 year old stockbroker and you have zero sex drive and you've

955
00:59:58.341 --> 01:00:00.640
shaped like a period water ball and yeah,

956
01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:04.790
go get some testosterone therapy because,
but you know,
and I think he said,

957
01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:09.710
I think it's underestimated is the balance between Dha sulfate and the

958
01:00:09.711 --> 01:00:10.544
testosterone.

959
01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:15.320
And I asked to be kept in balance because Dha sulfate is the mother of all

960
01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:18.440
androgens.
And if you don't take care of that at the same time,

961
01:00:18.441 --> 01:00:19.790
he can get into a lot of trouble.

962
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:24.910
So you elaborate on what because well,

963
01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:28.090
for example,
you know,

964
01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:31.370
every molecule can be linkedin in emotion and really think about,

965
01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:36.050
I mean you just spirit world book on that.
But the sulfate is the molecule,

966
01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:40.160
I think for me of motivation or one of them.
Okay.

967
01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:45.320
And if you take so much tests that you don't have enough Dha sulfate,

968
01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:50.450
you could,
you just a big lug with no drive.
So,
uh,

969
01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:53.390
you asked to keep the dag sulfate.

970
01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:59.020
And also you have to balance that with how much a salivary cortisol you make.

971
01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:04.380
It's not easy.
When you look at hormone therapy,
you can't look at a world tour,

972
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:09.020
strong Neto age thinking a shitload of testosterone is not going to solve your

973
01:01:09.021 --> 01:01:11.180
problems.
The best guy,

974
01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:17.790
the best educator on HRT is cherry air tog from Belgium.

975
01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:23.840
You'd lectures all over the world.
How do you spell his name?
Charles?
It's he's t,

976
01:01:23.841 --> 01:01:26.570
H I,
e r r y.

977
01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:31.810
And his family names h e r t o gue or t h o l.

978
01:01:33.350 --> 01:01:37.670
G.
U.
E t.
AF tag.
And he's,
um,
I'm glad I asked.

979
01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:40.410
I never would've,
yeah.

980
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:43.910
But easily found on that he teaches all over the world.

981
01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:49.010
She's probably teaching three weekends out of four always to endocrinologists or

982
01:01:49.011 --> 01:01:53.970
the anti aging circle.
But you know,
you'll talk about,
for example,

983
01:01:53.971 --> 01:01:58.220
of balancing things like,
uh,
oxytocin,

984
01:01:58.850 --> 01:02:03.530
uh,
with your testosterone.
So he has a very good approach and,

985
01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:08.480
uh,
he's big on monitoring where you store your body fat,

986
01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:11.660
uh,
as it relates to hormones.
Yes.

987
01:02:12.330 --> 01:02:15.200
I mean these books are very expensive,
but they really worth the investment.

988
01:02:15.201 --> 01:02:17.410
But he ill explain,
um,

989
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:22.750
or hormone deficiencies manifest in physically outward symptoms.

990
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.400
Like what happens when you're jade,
the sort of APP is to you,
if you,

991
01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:30.250
if you have too much.
Gh is what happens to you if you're done enough.
T three,

992
01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:34.220
you too much to t three.
So he is,

993
01:02:34.310 --> 01:02:39.310
he has made a lot of links between physical medicine and endocrinology and

994
01:02:40.051 --> 01:02:43.050
that's why he's very well respected.
Uh,

995
01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:48.620
and I find the best endocrinologist I've studied under him because he has a

996
01:02:49.171 --> 01:02:51.210
very,
um,

997
01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:55.020
Eagle's view of the hormonal system.

998
01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:59.040
It's not like looking at the world through a straw.
Oh yeah.
Your own test air.

999
01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:00.240
Take a gram a test that week.

1000
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:03.480
I can take a ground tests a week and you don't control the estrogen.

1001
01:03:03.481 --> 01:03:05.280
Zero bigger tits and barrel Anderson

1002
01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:08.660
<v 1>within a month.
Yeah.
Well I mean all that dimension.
I mean,</v>

1003
01:03:08.661 --> 01:03:12.050
your lipid profile is going,
I mean,
yeah.
Your,
your,

1004
01:03:12.051 --> 01:03:14.630
your lipids are not going to look so,
so impressive.

1005
01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:17.800
<v 5>And yet in Naples,
the size of frisbees.
So you know,</v>

1006
01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:22.400
and maybe that's one of your goals in life.
I don't know.
But the point is,

1007
01:03:22.401 --> 01:03:26.840
is that HRT is a viable tool.
It has to be done properly.

1008
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:30.560
And it's if the guy just comes in and tests your tests and he wants to give you

1009
01:03:30.561 --> 01:03:33.860
your prescription run out of there because look a lot of things.

1010
01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:38.460
<v 1>Yeah,
yeah.
No completely aid.
Let me ask you just a random question.
I mean,</v>

1011
01:03:38.461 --> 01:03:40.530
I talked about this very openly in the four hour body.

1012
01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.700
This is something that bugs me.

1013
01:03:41.701 --> 01:03:44.400
We can bitch and Moan about the Internet and other time.

1014
01:03:44.401 --> 01:03:47.520
But the fact that I wrote an entire s,
I wrote an entire,

1015
01:03:47.521 --> 01:03:50.420
I think four or five pages on like anabolics one on one.

1016
01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:52.980
And on Wikipedia it says Tim Ferris,

1017
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.410
Ed's admits to have used anabolic agents.
And I'm like,
it,

1018
01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:00.810
mits is such a weaselly word.
I wrote him back and fucking chapter about it.

1019
01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:04.240
So I've used different anabolics uh,
it,

1020
01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:09.300
it with medical supervision after surgeries.
And,
um,
one of the,

1021
01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.890
uh,
I,

1022
01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:14.850
I don't know if it's an urban myth or just one of the common beliefs among

1023
01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:18.270
athletes is that decker Draplin helps with joint repair,

1024
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:22.890
but I've never been able to come up with a plausible explanation for why

1025
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:26.250
nandrolone versus other things would have that effect.

1026
01:04:26.251 --> 01:04:31.050
And I'm just curious if you think that has any validity and if so what the

1027
01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:32.400
plausible explanation might be.

1028
01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:37.270
<v 5>Surely there is a paper on that.
Uh,
it's about five years old.</v>

1029
01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:41.830
Um,
I dug it on sheet,
pub med,

1030
01:04:42.250 --> 01:04:43.210
the

1031
01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:50.580
after we do the call and I'm pretty sure I got it in my an email because I

1032
01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:54.280
medical doctor asking me a question and not of interest.

1033
01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:59.050
I did find the paper this according to the urban legend,
you know,

1034
01:04:59.051 --> 01:05:02.970
you have more fluid in a joint which Decaux habs the joint which allows the

1035
01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:06.790
cartilage to regenerate,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah blah.
But um,

1036
01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:12.780
this particular study was on their regeneration of connective tissue in the Di.

1037
01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:16.360
They did find a positive influence from,

1038
01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:20.980
I think this study was Nander long funnel appropriate need if my memory serves

1039
01:05:20.981 --> 01:05:25.240
me right.
But the um,
I mean,
okay,
again,

1040
01:05:25.241 --> 01:05:28.390
you have clinical versus anecdotal evidence,

1041
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:33.630
but many old time powerlifters will tell you that when the self administered

1042
01:05:35.490 --> 01:05:39.520
[inaudible] own drugs,
they did see a decrease in joint pain.

1043
01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:45.120
But I do know there's at least one Swedish study on the benefits of Nandrolone

1044
01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:49.240
in the joint health.

1045
01:05:49.850 --> 01:05:54.830
<v 6>Cool.
I'll check it out,
uh,
yet natural.
And it's just also,
I mean,
I've always,</v>

1046
01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.900
uh,
I guess it's probably a legal issue.
Um,
and,

1047
01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:59.750
and just for those people listening are like,

1048
01:05:59.751 --> 01:06:02.740
let me run out and buy some nandrolone.
Uh,
the,

1049
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:07.420
the legal side effects of trying to do this stuff on the black market can be,
uh,

1050
01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:10.950
just as harsh as the physical side effects of using them improperly.

1051
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:13.160
So caveat emptor,
don't,
uh,
you know,

1052
01:06:13.161 --> 01:06:17.300
go find your local meathead and just inject whatever,
um,
you know,
cooking,

1053
01:06:17.301 --> 01:06:20.300
cooking oil,
he happens to sell you.
But,
um,
you know,

1054
01:06:20.301 --> 01:06:23.480
Nederland I found really interesting just from the standpoint of um,

1055
01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:27.710
a romantization and dealing with some of these other issues that you mentioned.

1056
01:06:27.711 --> 01:06:31.420
But anyway,
that's a whole separate conversation with,
but on the,
uh,

1057
01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:34.130
it's kind of non,
um,

1058
01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:38.060
non-drug stand standpoint or from that perspective,

1059
01:06:38.061 --> 01:06:40.670
what are approaches that you take?

1060
01:06:40.671 --> 01:06:44.090
What are things that you eliminate from your household or try to avoid,

1061
01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:47.960
whether that's due to environmental estrogens or you know,

1062
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:51.880
phytoestrogens or whatever the hell is synthetic estrogens or otherwise.
Um,
what,

1063
01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:56.030
what are things that you keep trying to keep out of your house or away from your

1064
01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:57.053
body?

1065
01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:01.540
<v 5>Well,
the thing is is that there's quite a few estrogens that can inform it,</v>

1066
01:07:01.541 --> 01:07:03.070
cosmetics,
shampoos and so on.

1067
01:07:03.071 --> 01:07:08.071
So a very simple tool is to go to ewg.org and the rank,

1068
01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:13.750
uh,
in quality.
All the common household products,

1069
01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:16.510
shampoos,
moisturizers,
or whenever.
If,
so,
for example,

1070
01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:21.520
there's one that comes to mind that is given for free and the Canada's biggest

1071
01:07:21.521 --> 01:07:22.354
health chain.

1072
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:27.400
It has a five types of para beans and pair of beans is linked to all forms of

1073
01:07:27.401 --> 01:07:31.150
cancer.
But he got five eyes and years of pair being in it.
Uh,

1074
01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.400
I'm not going to name the company,
but it's,
they're very well known company.

1075
01:07:33.401 --> 01:07:36.970
So people go get buffed at the gym in Toronto,

1076
01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:41.200
you take a shower and went through this dry.
So we've got dry scan,

1077
01:07:41.530 --> 01:07:46.530
they put that thing in and then basically lathering on crushed forms of oral

1078
01:07:47.651 --> 01:07:51.820
contraceptives.
So,
so,
so,

1079
01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:56.640
so I only buy organic,
uh,

1080
01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:00.460
certified organic products for body care.
Um,

1081
01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:04.600
my actually to my made at the house,

1082
01:08:04.601 --> 01:08:05.830
he's very conscious of that stuff.

1083
01:08:05.831 --> 01:08:09.140
So she only uses the best product and everything's very far,

1084
01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:14.050
ewg.org and it's free.
So,
uh,
and it's high quality,

1085
01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:16.070
uh,
act to

1086
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:20.930
<v 4>them in the past.
I think it's a great organization,
but the thing is,
is that</v>

1087
01:08:22.690 --> 01:08:25.610
Evelyn distributor,
who actually is the concept of batching,

1088
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:28.490
so I batch my email work at batch when cell phone work.

1089
01:08:28.730 --> 01:08:32.810
So I tried to minimize all radiation forms as much as possible.

1090
01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.570
Um,
over the last three years,

1091
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:41.110
I always take the month of July off and that's when I have time to read stuff on

1092
01:08:41.551 --> 01:08:42.680
my upcoming classes.

1093
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:46.970
And three years ago I started to look at their research,

1094
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:49.350
peer reviewed research on them,

1095
01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:53.240
electromagnetic pollution.

1096
01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:56.540
And it was quite a bit staggering.

1097
01:08:56.790 --> 01:08:59.300
A lot of the leading work has been done in France,

1098
01:08:59.330 --> 01:09:03.160
but it's not encouraging by any means.
Um,

1099
01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:06.630
things like dopamine,
if,

1100
01:09:06.690 --> 01:09:10.610
you know what I call Phantom messaged watching is a lot of people will look at

1101
01:09:10.611 --> 01:09:13.850
their iPhone for example,
to see if they've got a message.

1102
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:17.090
They don't batch it,
so they are obsessed with,

1103
01:09:17.091 --> 01:09:19.760
or they want to see who posted one on Facebook.

1104
01:09:20.210 --> 01:09:25.210
They found in Korea that it actually messes up with dopamine receptor site

1105
01:09:25.251 --> 01:09:29.940
location.
And it puts people in a state of I per,
um,

1106
01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.260
the giant ism,
you know,
so they,
they always,

1107
01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:36.770
they're basically like a navy seal and middle of Iraq,
uh,

1108
01:09:36.771 --> 01:09:40.220
anion Barry tolls on a clothesline with an American flag on their back,
you know,

1109
01:09:40.221 --> 01:09:45.170
so they always ready for battle and there's no need for it.
So,
uh,

1110
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:47.930
I fell in the best ways to actually manage stress,

1111
01:09:47.931 --> 01:09:51.860
which I learned from the four hour week,
was to batch my emails,

1112
01:09:51.861 --> 01:09:54.680
batch my cell phone,
uh,
work.

1113
01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:58.300
And I found it's a great stress reducer.
And of course,

1114
01:09:58.550 --> 01:10:02.720
biggest added benefit is you're far more productive,
you know,
um,

1115
01:10:03.810 --> 01:10:06.680
the,
the food,
the quality of the food,

1116
01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.630
you could say I'm quite,
uh,

1117
01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:16.160
uh,
enthusiastic about,
uh,

1118
01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.720
so you know,
where you put in your mouth is a stressor.

1119
01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:23.180
And when you say that comes out of your mouth is also a stressor.

1120
01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:25.550
So at least you have control on both.

1121
01:10:25.730 --> 01:10:28.700
So when I'm here in the US,

1122
01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:33.170
it's very easy for me to have the best food.
But when I travel overseas,

1123
01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:37.880
actually where I teach is dictated by the quality of the food.
So for example,

1124
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:43.270
I partnered up Nick Mitchell for his ultimate performance gym and Marvea he

1125
01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:46.490
goes,
hey,
I don't mind sunshine.
I'd rather teach than sunshine.

1126
01:10:46.491 --> 01:10:49.310
So I do most of my European seminars now,
Spain.

1127
01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:53.060
But in Spain I found this guy,
uh,

1128
01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:57.360
Michael and Antonio who finds me boar and deer and you know,

1129
01:10:57.410 --> 01:11:01.490
and the quality of the fish is very good.
So if I teach six weeks in Spain,

1130
01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:05.090
I got the best food.
Uh,
if I teach in northern Europe,

1131
01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.760
I'll either go to Denmark or Sweden,

1132
01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:10.550
the same thing cause it's basically good quality.

1133
01:11:10.551 --> 01:11:14.610
But in England it is a challenge but still feasible.
If it is,

1134
01:11:14.611 --> 01:11:18.870
you have educated enough students that they have dug out the best places.

1135
01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:22.080
You know,
even when I was in Manchester,
uh,

1136
01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:25.050
two weeks ago I could find some good food.
So it's um,

1137
01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:30.950
the Europeans are catching on quicker to this and the southwest the US.

1138
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:33.510
So for example,
if you go to Phoenix,

1139
01:11:33.511 --> 01:11:37.680
it's be easier eat organic ego to Rhode Island or Boston.

1140
01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:39.330
He should all luck.

1141
01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:46.120
<v 6>When you think of that,</v>

1142
01:11:46.121 --> 01:11:50.000
the typical gym in the u s let's just say what,

1143
01:11:51.170 --> 01:11:53.780
what drives you nuts about warm ups?

1144
01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:57.440
What are people doing incorrectly for warm ups,
for weight training?

1145
01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.390
<v 4>Uh,
the foam roller,
that is such a waste until I,</v>

1146
01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:04.820
and plus it leads to more scar tissue.

1147
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:10.090
So I only like the foam roller to distract vertebraes that's about it.

1148
01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:14.480
Um,
their warm ups.
Okay.

1149
01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:17.000
It's very good at evidence by Magda Adis.

1150
01:12:17.001 --> 01:12:22.001
But warming up on a treadmill or using the treadmill precipitates insulin

1151
01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:27.050
resistance by 46%.
So all it a try and cardio equipment,
in my opinion,

1152
01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:28.910
should be banned.
So I see it tomorrow.

1153
01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:32.120
You name me emperor of all galaxies and I've got all the power.

1154
01:12:32.450 --> 01:12:36.380
I would take all that cardio stuff throughout the gym.
Uh,

1155
01:12:36.381 --> 01:12:40.140
I would just replace it with a strong man equipment.
Uh,

1156
01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:47.260
the also the concept of train your core using unstable surfaces.

1157
01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:54.730
If you look at the actual research,
we'll find a that Elser about six weeks.

1158
01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:56.740
But after that,

1159
01:12:56.741 --> 01:13:01.490
there's no added benefit and the best way to strengthen your core competence.

1160
01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:06.400
Slowly squats,
dead lifts,
Chin ups,
the ups and so on.
So,

1161
01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:07.300
uh,

1162
01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:12.220
what drives me crazy is the gyms where I go and everything is done.

1163
01:13:12.610 --> 01:13:13.610
Like you'll see a,

1164
01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:19.100
a woman do a on a Bosu ball on one leg doing a control,

1165
01:13:20.111 --> 01:13:24.460
lateral dumbbell curl and switch legs and arms.
You know,
what does that do?

1166
01:13:24.461 --> 01:13:27.970
Fuck all
you know,

1167
01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:32.710
you should be better learning how to squat properly and through a set of 20 to

1168
01:13:32.711 --> 01:13:36.790
exhaustion.
It,
bring it more heat shock proteins,
which are,

1169
01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:40.870
have been associated with a fat loss and muscle building.
So the,
the,

1170
01:13:42.490 --> 01:13:44.890
this actually,
uh,

1171
01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:50.460
at trend now there's two gym chains around the world that have iron me to

1172
01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:55.680
develop educational seminars to get rid of all those balances.

1173
01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:02.160
One of them that these see education as a student of mine and he just won a

1174
01:14:02.321 --> 01:14:06.610
bodybuilding contest.
It's changed completely.
And even now,

1175
01:14:06.611 --> 01:14:08.880
the owners of the change by Whoa,
you know,

1176
01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:13.810
what changes did you make these illustrated to do strength training?
And um,
so,

1177
01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:16.000
and then one of the biggest chains in England,

1178
01:14:16.001 --> 01:14:21.001
I was also asking you to revamp that system because the rule is,

1179
01:14:21.011 --> 01:14:25.360
it's like the basics are the basics and you can't beat the basics.

1180
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:27.220
And uh,

1181
01:14:27.490 --> 01:14:32.140
Mass Bay first mentor told me there's three rules of success in strength

1182
01:14:32.141 --> 01:14:35.800
training.
One is art work to his hard work.
Three is hard work,

1183
01:14:36.130 --> 01:14:38.870
so you can't replace quality hard work,
you know?

1184
01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:44.490
<v 1>And if so,
if you were designing the perfect warm up routine,</v>

1185
01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:49.110
so you're able to throw the Bosu balls in the dumpster and we'll be able to get

1186
01:14:49.111 --> 01:14:53.760
rid of all of the cardio equipment.
Uh,
and let's just for the sake of simplicity,

1187
01:14:53.761 --> 01:14:55.680
say someone,
and you can tear this apart,

1188
01:14:55.681 --> 01:14:57.720
but just because people have heard of it,
I'll say,

1189
01:14:58.070 --> 01:15:01.710
if somebody is getting ready for like a five by five squat workout,

1190
01:15:01.711 --> 01:15:06.660
let's just say,
what would you have them do?
Any particular type of warmup?

1191
01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:07.640
The perfect word.
Yeah,

1192
01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:11.150
<v 4>of course.
Because there's two rules about warming up.</v>

1193
01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:16.400
The brain should know what the range of motion is and to,

1194
01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:20.210
their weight's going to get heavier.
So,
so for example,

1195
01:15:20.211 --> 01:15:23.750
you want to do five by five at a 100 kilos at 220 pounds.

1196
01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:28.550
So you go to the gym if it's squat well,

1197
01:15:28.551 --> 01:15:33.551
it's a lot of research that shows that mobility in the ankle is what decreases

1198
01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:38.240
the probability of any lower extremity injuries,

1199
01:15:38.241 --> 01:15:41.660
whether it's ACL tear or Amsterdam pool or grumpy or whatever.

1200
01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:46.410
So the first thing I would do is I would go on a calf machine and stretched the

1201
01:15:46.411 --> 01:15:51.080
calves,
uh,
and then go down all the,

1202
01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:53.840
uh,
statically the stretch for eight seconds.

1203
01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:59.140
Then I finish off with a voluntary contraction because it resets,

1204
01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:03.950
uh,
the patent owner,
uh,
for strength research is clear.

1205
01:16:03.951 --> 01:16:06.530
If you do static stretching,
you don't finish what a contraction,

1206
01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.150
you're more likely to get injured.

1207
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:10.120
<v 1>So you do the eight second stretch,</v>

1208
01:16:10.121 --> 01:16:12.940
let's just say at the bottom of the calf machine,

1209
01:16:12.941 --> 01:16:16.390
and then you would go up to sort of a peak holds or is it,

1210
01:16:16.570 --> 01:16:20.710
<v 4>yeah,
he could concentrate on,
on lifting the weight,</v>

1211
01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:23.680
actively contracting,
uh,
the calf.

1212
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:26.110
So the way it should be enough to stretch you.

1213
01:16:26.111 --> 01:16:29.020
If it's heavy enough to stretch you,
you won't be all lifted,

1214
01:16:29.021 --> 01:16:32.530
but you should do a voluntary contraction for two seconds at the end of the

1215
01:16:32.531 --> 01:16:37.330
stretch to reactivate the power and your muscle.

1216
01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:39.940
So I would make my ankles flexible.

1217
01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:45.060
Then I would take the bar and depending on which muscles are tight,

1218
01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.800
if it's squad or hamstrings or whatever,

1219
01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:52.390
I would do the same principle and get into a position where had to basically do

1220
01:16:52.391 --> 01:16:55.900
PNF stretching,
right?
And then,
uh,

1221
01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:59.570
do those exercises then and mobile for the range of motion.

1222
01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:03.250
If the goal is hundred kilos for five sets of five,

1223
01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:06.760
then the first one I'm upset we'd be the bar,
just a bar,
four reps,

1224
01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:09.650
then I would go to 60 kilos,
which is percent.

1225
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.060
So my body knows what the range of motion has done.
I put 60 kilos or 60%.

1226
01:17:14.450 --> 01:17:18.290
I would only do about three reps.
Then I would go to 75 kilos.

1227
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:23.120
I would do two raps.
I go there,
uh,
85 kilos,
do one rep 90 kilos,

1228
01:17:23.121 --> 01:17:27.740
do one rep,
95 kilos,
do one rep.
So all those weights just telling me to wait,

1229
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:29.360
it's going to be coming soon.

1230
01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:33.830
And then squat aren't kilos versus a five.

1231
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:37.340
So I have accomplished my goal.
I know what the range of motion is,

1232
01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:41.960
which allows me to have great mechanics and then a,
um,

1233
01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:47.540
a more warmed up psychologically and physiologically speaking to handle the

1234
01:17:47.541 --> 01:17:49.880
weight.
Some people do what were they called?
Over warm up.

1235
01:17:49.881 --> 01:17:53.570
So if they want to train at a hundred,
they'll do a set [inaudible] 95,

1236
01:17:53.571 --> 01:17:58.430
then they go to one 10 to activate the nervous system,
but the only one rep,

1237
01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:01.430
so they don't really go to fairly,
they just tell the body,
hey,

1238
01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:04.660
a hundred kilos going to feel lighter.
The Re,
uh,

1239
01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:06.860
Paul Carter is a big advocate of this,

1240
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:12.300
but the first time I'd read it was from,
uh,
uh,

1241
01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:16.700
a part of the coach in 1973.
I mean,

1242
01:18:16.701 --> 01:18:17.870
that's when the article was published,

1243
01:18:17.871 --> 01:18:21.350
but it was from Finland and they have a name in it and finish,

1244
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:22.880
which has about 96 letters.

1245
01:18:22.881 --> 01:18:27.170
But it means it means proper appropriate reception set.

1246
01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:31.400
Um,
so see,
yeah,
appropriate assumptions that,
okay,

1247
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:35.900
so big insurance p set,
but that's a way to warm up,
uh,

1248
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:39.770
where you grew up all over the set.
I mean,

1249
01:18:39.771 --> 01:18:44.450
and it's the one thing Paul Carter figured it out by himself,
but

1250
01:18:46.450 --> 01:18:50.600
there's such a thing as universal and intelligence.
There's nothing new really.

1251
01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:55.640
So,
you know,
I could find in 73 and that's all the research I did on,

1252
01:18:55.641 --> 01:18:59.780
but maybe somebody figured it out in 1908 by himself.
I mean in my house here,

1253
01:18:59.781 --> 01:19:04.640
I've got everything that's ever been waiting on weight training since 1896

1254
01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:08.930
multiple languages.
Like for example,
a Frit,
frittery,
Gill Ids,
anatomy books.

1255
01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:11.450
I've got them in 15 different languages.

1256
01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:16.970
So I find it's a good way,
you know,
I love learning languages,

1257
01:19:16.971 --> 01:19:21.260
but you should learn things you're passionate about.
So you know,

1258
01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:25.280
after that you can learn a lot of grammar on explaining somebody ought to squat.

1259
01:19:25.630 --> 01:19:29.570
He learned that erections and whatever.
So I,
uh,

1260
01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:32.030
I've used that as a tool for learning languages.
But the point is,

1261
01:19:32.031 --> 01:19:36.470
is that when people say,
Oh,
I've invented this,
I said,
bullshit.

1262
01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:37.940
It was in men in Egypt,

1263
01:19:37.941 --> 01:19:42.680
1923 or 1908 by Bob people or whatever it is,
the,

1264
01:19:42.681 --> 01:19:46.670
the,
what's newest combinations,
um,

1265
01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:49.640
you know,
or applications.

1266
01:19:49.641 --> 01:19:53.870
But like a fad grip dumbbells is not new.

1267
01:19:53.871 --> 01:19:57.840
I mean that's 1896.
So,
um,

1268
01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.230
what I did for the Fed grip dumbbells,

1269
01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:04.450
I made them revolve so the easier on your joints.
So I designed them for uh,

1270
01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:09.150
Watson gym equipment.
They're calibrated,

1271
01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:11.910
their nuclear attack resistant,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1272
01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:15.590
But all I did is it's um,

1273
01:20:16.230 --> 01:20:20.280
eh ameliorations yeah,
right.
New Application of an old idea.
Yes,
yes.

1274
01:20:20.281 --> 01:20:23.920
But there's nothing new and we train
to,

1275
01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:28.440
speaking of the squat routine that you sort of led up to,

1276
01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:33.860
what are the most common mistakes that people make after they finished their

1277
01:20:33.961 --> 01:20:36.780
work sets or,
or after a workout for that matter

1278
01:20:38.490 --> 01:20:43.290
and the really,
really big Bailey Tim in immediate recovery,

1279
01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:47.510
that's from personal experience.
Okay.

1280
01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:51.540
I mean that the summer research from Australia and South Africa back or two

1281
01:20:51.541 --> 01:20:56.541
years is cortisol used to be considered the enemy.

1282
01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:59.850
Now in the last four years,

1283
01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:04.020
we figured out that the more cortisol you make drink training,

1284
01:21:04.021 --> 01:21:05.370
the greater training response.

1285
01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:09.760
So people used to take cortisol blockers before training that stupid Gleason no

1286
01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:14.310
gains.
But I think that the effect of the Cortisol is transitory.

1287
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:18.780
So you induce the message,
then you got to get rid of the message.
Okay.
So,
uh,

1288
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:22.680
you know,
uh,
as,
uh,
what's that guy?

1289
01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:27.150
Uh,
Charlie Sheen.
I don't pay women to have sex.

1290
01:21:27.151 --> 01:21:31.530
I paid him to leave after sex.
So of course I was like that.

1291
01:21:31.531 --> 01:21:35.960
It's like the prostitute,
you got to get rid of the,

1292
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:38.860
of the prostitutes that you've got to get rid of it.

1293
01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:45.030
So I know my analogies it up there,
but people like graphic stuff,

1294
01:21:45.031 --> 01:21:48.750
so they remember far better.
So you want to get rid of cortisol.

1295
01:21:48.751 --> 01:21:53.751
So in my opinion is you got to suppress cortisol immediately after exercise.

1296
01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:00.060
Um,
of course,
you know,
people say when she been handed down that hey,

1297
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:03.840
I don't think my,
listen 17 disparate sports,
that's my dad.

1298
01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:07.030
So I've tried not to do it and I,
you know,
I,

1299
01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.700
I've gone away from it after I different ways,

1300
01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:12.000
but I really believe you've got to bring that cortisol down.

1301
01:22:12.690 --> 01:22:16.860
The best way to do that is to make yourself more insulin sensitive.

1302
01:22:16.861 --> 01:22:20.060
So you do,
you go through your steps to make yourself incidences there,

1303
01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:21.480
but it's somebody who trains really hard.

1304
01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:26.810
Let's say he weighs 200 pounds or we like to have a 200 grams of carbohydrate

1305
01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:31.110
blend right after each.

1306
01:22:31.230 --> 01:22:34.530
What about 50 grams of high quality protein?

1307
01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:37.230
A lot of people are intolerant to weigh and they don't even know.

1308
01:22:37.530 --> 01:22:40.410
I really like essential amnio acid blends.

1309
01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:46.050
So if you're a 200 pound man,
I developed a product for ATP lab and the cat,

1310
01:22:46.051 --> 01:22:51.051
it's called Panther car cyclodextrins some dextrose in three forms of non GMO

1311
01:22:53.370 --> 01:22:55.280
Maltodextrin.
I give that to people with uh,

1312
01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:59.310
about 50 grams of essential aminos in most cases if they can handle the whey

1313
01:22:59.311 --> 01:23:02.250
protein,
I give him the whey protein because it's way cheaper.

1314
01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:06.880
Or sometimes I give them go away because they're not to go away,

1315
01:23:06.881 --> 01:23:08.800
but he may be intolerant to cows week.

1316
01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:12.010
<v 6>Where does someone find goat?
Where just out of curiosity,</v>

1317
01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:17.190
<v 4>I mean,
I make no money telling you this,
but my fear brand is Tiaras.
Wait,</v>

1318
01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:21.710
t.
I.
E.
R.
R.
A.
Apostrophe S.
Wait,

1319
01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:23.070
you can find it all foods,

1320
01:23:23.071 --> 01:23:27.980
but on Amazon they'll split your asked to shifty within 24 hours.
Uh,

1321
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:32.250
that's,
that's where,
that's where I get mine.

1322
01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:34.380
Um,
and it's,

1323
01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:39.930
I find it personally to be more in a buck and a causeway.

1324
01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:41.430
That's my personal preference.

1325
01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:46.380
But I use for my immuno acids,
one of my students,

1326
01:23:46.381 --> 01:23:50.730
other Germany makes.
Uh,
and when I said Slash Electric Wade complex,

1327
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:56.190
and I use that,
I mean,
it's something I never ran out.
It's a,

1328
01:23:56.270 --> 01:24:00.000
uh,
come back from a trip.
I put two canisters back into my luggage.

1329
01:24:00.450 --> 01:24:02.620
I don't want to forget it.
So,

1330
01:24:03.210 --> 01:24:07.980
<v 6>and with,
with say the Penta Carb,
just so people don't,
uh,</v>

1331
01:24:09.450 --> 01:24:14.160
take,
uh,
take the,
the wrong or interpreted the wrong way.

1332
01:24:14.670 --> 01:24:18.920
At what point have you earned that?
Say,
you know,

1333
01:24:18.930 --> 01:24:21.810
200 grams of carbohydrates,
50 grams of protein,
for instance,

1334
01:24:21.811 --> 01:24:26.220
if you're a larger athlete,
because I know that,
I'm sure you've seen it.

1335
01:24:26.221 --> 01:24:27.510
I've seen it.
I go to the gym,

1336
01:24:27.511 --> 01:24:32.511
I see somebody do 10 minutes on an elliptical while watching part of a game of

1337
01:24:32.731 --> 01:24:33.930
Thrones.
They get off of them.
They,

1338
01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:38.310
they drink 500 calories of carbohydrates at when?

1339
01:24:38.311 --> 01:24:41.580
When does it make sense to consume this post,

1340
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:45.480
this post workout and when does it not make sense?

1341
01:24:46.130 --> 01:24:47.070
<v 4>Yes,
yes,</v>

1342
01:24:47.071 --> 01:24:51.120
it deserve your cards and I'll repeat myself on that and dessert or done any

1343
01:24:51.121 --> 01:24:54.810
carbs for six days.
You need to be sub 10 cent body fat.

1344
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:59.460
And the quickest way to know if you have slept in body fat as a male is can I

1345
01:24:59.461 --> 01:25:03.720
see the Linea Alba and your apps and or we're just going to see all Ambrose one

1346
01:25:03.721 --> 01:25:06.450
add row doesn't count if you try to see them all.
Okay,

1347
01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:09.840
so you have to have penis skin on your abs.

1348
01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:17.420
If you get pitch an inch,
it certainly all deserve carbohydrates.
So you know,

1349
01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:21.570
if you could see visibly your abs,
then that's when you deserve it.

1350
01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:25.650
Until then I said I think you should stick to uh,

1351
01:25:26.190 --> 01:25:30.870
either way or essential amino acids and more branch chains and some glutamine

1352
01:25:31.230 --> 01:25:32.970
because you don't deserve it.
But

1353
01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:38.430
one of the things that increases our balls and Mr be insulin sensitive.

1354
01:25:38.670 --> 01:25:41.580
What makes you insulin sensitive?
Losing body fat.
I mean,

1355
01:25:42.090 --> 01:25:45.450
Nick Mitchell send me some pictures yesterday of this,
uh,

1356
01:25:46.050 --> 01:25:51.050
journalists that he's training and this guy looked at a human for Aiga and in

1357
01:25:51.181 --> 01:25:53.880
nine weeks that guy's got abs,
right?
I mean,

1358
01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:58.560
he was considering calling his book author Polish a Turd.
But

1359
01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:01.290
no kidding.
But the thing is,

1360
01:26:01.291 --> 01:26:05.270
is that he took this guy who horrendous and it's all documented.

1361
01:26:05.271 --> 01:26:10.200
So there's no like Photoshop and bullshit and took him from it.

1362
01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:15.170
I would estimate at 23% body fat or 9% body fat in nine weeks.

1363
01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:18.350
What did he do?
He restricted this cards.
So now that he's lean,

1364
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:21.340
he's jacked up this card.
So you've got to deserve your cards,

1365
01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:25.550
but if you don't deserve it,
don't have them.
It just get fatter.

1366
01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:27.673
What,
um,

1367
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.950
what are some commonly neglected ways to decrease body fat aside from

1368
01:26:33.951 --> 01:26:35.270
restricting carbohydrates?

1369
01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:40.640
I think that the biggest mistake is to do steady state cardio.

1370
01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:43.610
You want to get fatter?
Go right ahead.
Uh,

1371
01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:48.740
the second most biggest mistake is to use the low fat approach.

1372
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:51.040
So some people will restrict their carbohydrates,

1373
01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:55.340
but they restrict their fats too.
So that's a big mistake.

1374
01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:59.150
If you're going to go high protein,
low carb,
you need to have high fat.

1375
01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:03.490
So you cook your meats in olive oil and butter,

1376
01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:09.140
you put butter on your vegetables and so on and you take coconut oil and uh,

1377
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:12.920
that would help you,
uh,
get more insulin sensitive.

1378
01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:16.070
The thing too is decreasing cortisol.

1379
01:27:16.071 --> 01:27:20.570
Cortisol is a great enemy when we are talking about developing insulin

1380
01:27:20.571 --> 01:27:24.830
resistance.
Are you the Oud?
You decrease cortisol.
Well,

1381
01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:28.100
you manage your stress.
How do you manage your stress?
Well,

1382
01:27:28.130 --> 01:27:32.750
you get an effective work habits.
You eliminate distractions.
When you're at work,

1383
01:27:32.751 --> 01:27:33.800
turn off your email,

1384
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:37.640
only answer your email right before lunch and right before you leave work.

1385
01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:40.940
I mean,
there's a lot of ways to manage your stress.

1386
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:44.450
One of books I really like and I recommend to all my students,

1387
01:27:44.451 --> 01:27:49.190
it's 59 seconds from Richard Wiseman.
Oh,
I've never heard of it.
Okay.
It to him,

1388
01:27:49.210 --> 01:27:50.430
he got to read that book.
It,

1389
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:54.170
I would say it's one of those best book you'll ever read because what he does,

1390
01:27:54.171 --> 01:27:55.600
he takes a critical look.
Yeah.

1391
01:27:56.070 --> 01:28:00.570
<v 3>At the self help industry and one that tests he makes you do.</v>

1392
01:28:00.571 --> 01:28:05.571
He describes 10 self help techniques that are repeated over and over,

1393
01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:08.550
uh,
in the self help literature.

1394
01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:12.240
And he asks you to identify which ones work.

1395
01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:17.870
I won't tell you the answer but I am 100%,
uh,

1396
01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:21.750
on the test because I was that identify the ones that don't work and the ones

1397
01:28:21.751 --> 01:28:25.440
that do work.
So for example,
one of the common ones that you read and every book,

1398
01:28:25.650 --> 01:28:29.950
imagine the body that you want black,
you know,
that's,

1399
01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:33.300
well all he does is encourage you to be delusional.

1400
01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:38.070
What works is a plant would an action step.
You want to get lean,
you need a plan.

1401
01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:41.970
If you fail to plan,
you plan to fail.
So,

1402
01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:46.290
and in the book,
what he does it,
you answered a challenge from his friend Sophie.

1403
01:28:46.291 --> 01:28:48.630
Sophie said,
Mbg,

1404
01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:53.750
I want to help myself but I want stuff that is science based and I want to not

1405
01:28:56.581 --> 01:29:00.750
take a lot of time.
So he says,
so I can give you an asset in under one minute.

1406
01:29:00.751 --> 01:29:02.010
She goes,
right.
So

1407
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:03.900
<v 4>that's why the book is called 59 seconds.</v>

1408
01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:09.320
And in the book you go over anything from building relationships to a goal

1409
01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:10.351
setting,

1410
01:29:10.351 --> 01:29:15.351
any destroys a lot of myths about goal setting and he's bullshit studies.

1411
01:29:15.751 --> 01:29:20.280
They were never actually done and,
but he does everything.

1412
01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:21.030
Uh,

1413
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:26.030
so you would love it and you'll talk about anything from increasing your high,

1414
01:29:27.180 --> 01:29:31.530
your odds to getting picked up when your child through whatever.
It's very,

1415
01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:35.110
very funny guy and he's written a lot of very good books.
Uh,

1416
01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:38.880
he's the one who wrote core ecology.
Uh,
he's a magician.

1417
01:29:38.881 --> 01:29:43.881
He says being a phd in psychology and he could see his magic tricks on Youtube

1418
01:29:44.341 --> 01:29:48.010
is pretty interesting guy.
He's um,
so like that,

1419
01:29:48.110 --> 01:29:50.160
that's probably the best self help book.
But I tell people,

1420
01:29:50.230 --> 01:29:53.760
if you really want to change to read that book,
I'm 59 seconds.

1421
01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:56.730
You have a Richard Wiseman.
Very cool.
What's,
um,

1422
01:29:56.790 --> 01:30:01.080
what other books do you gift the most other people or recommend the most?

1423
01:30:01.950 --> 01:30:05.400
I get that one often.
The only one I read like to give is the one thing.

1424
01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:11.070
I'm actually lecturing with one of the authors in Texas,

1425
01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:15.800
uh,
in November.
So if you want to join up it,
just go look at,

1426
01:30:15.801 --> 01:30:19.590
um,
the,
uh,
powerful executive.com.

1427
01:30:20.130 --> 01:30:23.580
It'll be a page with all three registered,
but,
uh,

1428
01:30:23.670 --> 01:30:27.820
Jay Papasan wrote the one thing with Gary Keller.
Um,

1429
01:30:28.710 --> 01:30:33.150
Eh,
it's very similar actually the four work week and a lot of points,
I mean,

1430
01:30:33.410 --> 01:30:36.240
successor was a success rules,
right?
Uh,

1431
01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:40.110
but when I read your book and I tell my students to buy your book,

1432
01:30:40.111 --> 01:30:44.220
what I learned from you was that work way too hard.
And I had no fun in my life.

1433
01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:45.533
So,

1434
01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:50.730
so after reading your book and Jay Papasan and Gary Keller,

1435
01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:54.240
recommend the first thing you should plan in a year as your vacation.

1436
01:30:55.050 --> 01:30:58.710
So African reading,
both of these books,
I mean,
when I'm at home,

1437
01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:01.200
I worked two and a half to four hours Max.

1438
01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:06.570
I think the month of July off at take the first two weeks of August off.

1439
01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:11.960
I don't work the month of December until about end of January and a week a month

1440
01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:14.580
I take off.
Okay.

1441
01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:19.230
And they're in that in my life unless until the last four years.

1442
01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:24.500
But what else would the one thing is that you have to pick one activity per day

1443
01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:28.440
that will change the rest of your life.
So for example,

1444
01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:32.490
doing a podcast with you is my one thing today because you're very popular

1445
01:31:32.491 --> 01:31:33.324
author.

1446
01:31:33.450 --> 01:31:38.450
I mean short who's another one of my heroes was a on your podcast recently.

1447
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:42.270
Uh,
actually Arnold Schwarzenegger,

1448
01:31:42.271 --> 01:31:45.510
he is probably the most inspiring man you could listen to.

1449
01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:49.050
I was very fortunate to be invited by Tony Doherty to teach of the Arnold

1450
01:31:49.051 --> 01:31:50.910
classic last March in Australia.

1451
01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:55.460
And on the Sunday morning there was a small group of us.
Uh,

1452
01:31:55.620 --> 01:32:00.620
we're invited to listen to Arnold Schwarzenegger and coming out of the bed

1453
01:32:01.691 --> 01:32:05.080
lectured.
I don't think in my life ever been that fired up.

1454
01:32:05.610 --> 01:32:07.630
What I like about Schwarzenegger,
he's very honest.

1455
01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:12.160
And the thing he talked the most about it was actually his mistakes.
And,

1456
01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:16.540
uh,
you know,
it takes balls to do that and I'm all,

1457
01:32:16.541 --> 01:32:20.350
you learn from them and so on.
So the,
uh,

1458
01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:22.930
but the one thing is one of my favorite books,

1459
01:32:22.990 --> 01:32:27.520
I tell him about students because it gets you organized and makes you focused,

1460
01:32:28.030 --> 01:32:32.020
um,
a success.

1461
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:33.790
The rules are universal,
you know?

1462
01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:36.060
<v 1>No,
it's just like strength training.
Like you said.
I think there,</v>

1463
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:39.690
there are old ideas and new applications.
And,
uh,

1464
01:32:39.691 --> 01:32:41.570
I remember I was on the BBC once and is,

1465
01:32:41.571 --> 01:32:45.100
it was kind of funny because I knew that they were going to set me up.
Uh,

1466
01:32:45.150 --> 01:32:47.970
they were,
it was a,
it was a segment on self help.
And I was like,
okay,

1467
01:32:47.971 --> 01:32:51.900
well if it's,
if they're calling itself help,
this is going to be an attack piece.

1468
01:32:51.901 --> 01:32:54.570
And I knew it,
I knew it was coming.
So I sat down and they were like,

1469
01:32:55.380 --> 01:32:57.500
so Mr Ferris,
you know,
and they said this in the,

1470
01:32:57.501 --> 01:32:59.130
in the most British way imaginable.
I mean,

1471
01:32:59.131 --> 01:33:01.200
it was very polite but very condescending.

1472
01:33:03.330 --> 01:33:06.450
Not all British people are,
are like that,
but it is a super power in the UK.

1473
01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:09.300
And um,
and they said,
uh,

1474
01:33:09.301 --> 01:33:14.220
so how would you defend people in the self help genre who this,
this and this?

1475
01:33:14.221 --> 01:33:16.770
And I said,
I wouldn't,
I think they're full of shit.
I said,

1476
01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:19.160
I think that for the most part,
you know,

1477
01:33:19.161 --> 01:33:23.400
you should only take advice from people who have a track record of implementing

1478
01:33:23.401 --> 01:33:28.260
that same advice.
And,
uh,
you know,
if I identify more with,
uh,

1479
01:33:28.261 --> 01:33:31.200
or if,
if,
if you ask me who my favorite self help author is,

1480
01:33:31.201 --> 01:33:33.690
I'd probably say Ben Franklin,
right?
I mean,
that's right.

1481
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:38.160
I'm looking back or Seneca maybe,
you know?
Yeah.
Really rewind the clock.

1482
01:33:38.190 --> 01:33:41.550
And I think that the one thing,
uh,
is,

1483
01:33:41.610 --> 01:33:46.350
is just the title itself after you've read the book I think is very helpful

1484
01:33:46.351 --> 01:33:48.390
because whether you look at Seneca,

1485
01:33:48.391 --> 01:33:51.010
you look at some of the top performing CEOs in Silicon Valley,

1486
01:33:51.011 --> 01:33:54.330
you've actually have lives outside of the businesses they're building.

1487
01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:59.340
They're constantly asking a question that is some variants of like,

1488
01:33:59.341 --> 01:34:03.360
what is the one thing on this list that really matters,
right?

1489
01:34:03.361 --> 01:34:06.680
What is the one thing on this list that will make all the other things easier,

1490
01:34:06.690 --> 01:34:08.040
unimportant,
or whatever.
Right?
There's,

1491
01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:12.930
there's always some variation of that question.
Correct.
And it's,
um,

1492
01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:14.830
but I,
I think it's,

1493
01:34:14.850 --> 01:34:18.750
it's so valuable for people to hear you say what you did,

1494
01:34:18.751 --> 01:34:20.820
which is your planning vacation first rate.

1495
01:34:20.821 --> 01:34:25.440
You're blocking out times for the fun things.
Because if you don't do that,

1496
01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:26.790
then work,

1497
01:34:26.791 --> 01:34:31.080
we'll simply swell to fill those times and fill those voids.

1498
01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:35.910
What do you do with your,
uh,
when you take,
say the month off,

1499
01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:37.980
what are the,
what are the things that you now do?

1500
01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:41.620
<v 4>Well,
it give you an example.
My daughter loves martial arts.</v>

1501
01:34:41.890 --> 01:34:46.240
And last two summers we went to Sweden,

1502
01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:49.210
Stockholm,
and she trained with this,

1503
01:34:49.211 --> 01:34:51.700
a Sensei in Brazilian Jujitsu.

1504
01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:55.570
And so she trained three times a day,
twice,

1505
01:34:55.870 --> 01:35:00.260
a twice in Jujitsu,
once in lifting.
And,

1506
01:35:00.290 --> 01:35:05.000
but in between,
we would do,
uh,
things like visit biking museums.

1507
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:08.600
We would do some type of touristic learning experience,
right?

1508
01:35:09.050 --> 01:35:11.450
And we'd go off,
uh,

1509
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:15.880
visit the islands of Stockholm for one day,
whatever that is.
I think that,

1510
01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:18.620
you know,
when I'm raising her,

1511
01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:22.640
I tried to make your visit as many countries as possible every year so that she

1512
01:35:22.641 --> 01:35:23.271
doesn't,
you know,

1513
01:35:23.271 --> 01:35:27.710
80% of 15 year old Americans can't put the US on the world map.

1514
01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:31.160
That's,
that's a big issue.
So,
you know,
by going here,

1515
01:35:31.161 --> 01:35:36.161
there and then every day ask your three questions and you know,

1516
01:35:37.131 --> 01:35:41.210
I always ask her and I've been in action.
She's a toddler,

1517
01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:47.450
she could speak is one is what have you done today to help someone?

1518
01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:50.570
And then she'll say whatever.

1519
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:55.220
And then the second question is always what someone than knife for you today or

1520
01:35:55.221 --> 01:35:59.090
to help you out.
And then the third question is always,
what did you learn?

1521
01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:04.640
And then,
you know,
so one time we went to visit a lady where we're in London,

1522
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:07.070
who's an expert on mammals.

1523
01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:11.120
She wrote a book on mammals that my daughter read when she was five or six years

1524
01:36:11.121 --> 01:36:14.650
old.
And so I booked a brain picking fee with a lady.
She,

1525
01:36:14.670 --> 01:36:18.700
she was kind of puzzled why we're going to do that.
And I asked my daughters,

1526
01:36:18.750 --> 01:36:20.830
get asked her what her,
uh,
uh,

1527
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:24.500
you want about animals and then she act know,

1528
01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:28.060
and the lady was surprised how much my daughter knew about things that are now

1529
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:32.690
smart.
The question is work,
but you know,
a life not examined is not a word,

1530
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:33.740
a life worth living.

1531
01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:39.170
So I think it's really important that you pause at the end of the day to she

1532
01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:44.090
would have you done.
And you know,
I religiously,
uh,

1533
01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:47.300
donate 10% of what I make,
the different causes.
So for example,

1534
01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:52.760
on the weekend that adopted an enter tiger and uh,
this afternoon,

1535
01:36:52.761 --> 01:36:55.520
Lorie hang up and making a donation to the navy seal foundation.

1536
01:36:55.910 --> 01:37:00.440
So it's really important that w and one of the principles in life,

1537
01:37:00.441 --> 01:37:04.820
if you want to be successful,
these to give what you want.

1538
01:37:05.330 --> 01:37:09.560
So if you give away money,
you'll receive money.
Uh,
if you,

1539
01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:14.180
so if you're not willing to give it away,

1540
01:37:14.210 --> 01:37:17.720
you won't attract it and on it sounds a bit of all key,
but it's very true.

1541
01:37:18.110 --> 01:37:22.070
And my father taught me that a long time ago.
You had the same practice,

1542
01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:25.320
but I remember in university adding zero money.

1543
01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:28.810
I mean I was so poor to furniture was painted on the walls,
you know.

1544
01:37:29.210 --> 01:37:33.410
So I uh,
I donated 150 bucks,

1545
01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:36.460
50 bucks left in my account after that to a,

1546
01:37:36.530 --> 01:37:39.050
a homeless people shelter.

1547
01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:45.700
And the next day I sold one main university papers to two different federations

1548
01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:48.170
and each pay me one,

1549
01:37:48.171 --> 01:37:52.430
pay me 600 bucks and he had a one pay me 1200 bucks for the same chapter is a

1550
01:37:52.431 --> 01:37:54.740
chapter on training for vertical jump and volleyball.

1551
01:37:55.290 --> 01:37:58.230
But so the return on investment was immediate.

1552
01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:03.180
But I'm a big believer if you want more money,
give more weight and uh,

1553
01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:04.200
you know,

1554
01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:09.200
we first have a why the navy seal foundation or those guys take care of that.

1555
01:38:09.361 --> 01:38:11.070
We can live the way we want to live,

1556
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:16.650
but our government doesn't support them very well once the abused them.
Right.

1557
01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:21.950
So I leave clear instructions that I want them to the money to be used for
react.

1558
01:38:22.110 --> 01:38:25.490
A lot of guys get injuries and the one that takes care of them,
right.

1559
01:38:25.770 --> 01:38:28.940
But it doesn't matter if you give to doctors without borders or,

1560
01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:30.810
or whatever else.
I mean,

1561
01:38:30.811 --> 01:38:34.620
the thing is that if you leave this planet with are making it better than them,

1562
01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:37.200
you were born,
you didn't live a good life.

1563
01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:42.380
<v 1>Yeah.
What's the point?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Agreed.
Uh,
the,
um,</v>

1564
01:38:44.410 --> 01:38:45.190
when you,

1565
01:38:45.190 --> 01:38:49.390
what are questions that you ask yourself at the end of the day or the end of the

1566
01:38:49.391 --> 01:38:53.530
week,
just like you had the questions that your daughter asks,
uh,

1567
01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:55.540
or that you asked your daughter rather,
are there,

1568
01:38:55.541 --> 01:38:58.480
are there questions that you revisit on a regular basis?

1569
01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:03.610
<v 4>Well,
it's,
how can I make this better?
Or,
oh,</v>

1570
01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:06.870
can it make the teaching more effective?
You know,

1571
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:13.070
I realized over the years that you act to simplify more and more and more and

1572
01:39:15.991 --> 01:39:19.100
more.
If there's,

1573
01:39:19.130 --> 01:39:23.770
one thing I've learned was for 54 years on earth is that,
uh,

1574
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:27.710
as Einstein said,
there's genius in simplicity.

1575
01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:31.400
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1576
01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:36.150
<v 1>And one thing I've,
I've always admired about the way you teach.
Also,
we'll look.</v>

1577
01:39:36.151 --> 01:39:38.400
Two things really that I've observed.
Uh,

1578
01:39:38.420 --> 01:39:42.900
number one is you use metaphor and analogy in a very memorable way.

1579
01:39:42.930 --> 01:39:46.920
And a,
I mean,
people,
if I asked them what the Charlie Sheen point was,

1580
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:51.750
is there going to remember cortisol?
And it's,
but it's,
it's funny.

1581
01:39:51.751 --> 01:39:56.620
Yes.
And it's a,
it,
it's very Charles.
Yes.
But it's,

1582
01:39:56.630 --> 01:39:58.920
it's also memorable and I think that,
uh,
you know,

1583
01:39:58.921 --> 01:40:03.921
simplifying and pegging these concepts to memorable imagery is something you're

1584
01:40:04.201 --> 01:40:08.400
very gifted at.
Um,
and you're also not,

1585
01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:11.820
uh,
you're not overly easy on your students,

1586
01:40:11.850 --> 01:40:16.770
which I appreciate because for instance,
I'm training with this,
uh,
this,

1587
01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:20.070
uh,
this older Polish trainer in his sixties.
And I've,
I've,

1588
01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:23.130
I've generally not worked with trainers on a regular basis.

1589
01:40:23.131 --> 01:40:26.190
I've worked with coaches,
but now I suppose he could be considered a coach.

1590
01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:30.240
And we're working on,
he has four world records and Olympic weightlifting.

1591
01:40:30.990 --> 01:40:35.580
And He,
the first time I met him,
he,
he's like,
take off your shirt.

1592
01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:39.480
And he walked over and just kind of pinched my left tit and said,
you're too fat.

1593
01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:43.230
And that was the first thing he said to me.
And,
uh,

1594
01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:47.910
it was really refreshing because in the u s uh,

1595
01:40:47.970 --> 01:40:51.640
we have adopted and developed this,
you know,

1596
01:40:51.650 --> 01:40:55.090
you get a gold ribbon for 18th place type of culture,

1597
01:40:55.091 --> 01:40:56.440
which is ultimately I think,

1598
01:40:56.441 --> 01:41:01.270
a disservice to the students we're trying to help.
Uh,

1599
01:41:01.271 --> 01:41:04.410
so it was very refreshing in the end.
He's,
I mean,
he,

1600
01:41:04.411 --> 01:41:07.120
he's not always belligerent just for the sake of being belligerent,

1601
01:41:07.121 --> 01:41:11.620
but he's very brusque when it serves a purpose.
And,
um,

1602
01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:14.770
uh,
I'd love to just hear from you what you think,

1603
01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:20.430
what are common mistakes that teachers make aside from not simplifying

1604
01:41:20.561 --> 01:41:21.880
something?
Uh,
enough?

1605
01:41:22.570 --> 01:41:27.430
<v 4>I think they're all purpose.
What I do is based on a Japanese concept,</v>

1606
01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:31.600
you only a good teacher.
If you leave a student,
it's better than yours.

1607
01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:36.250
So I always try to make somebody better than me,
you know,

1608
01:41:36.370 --> 01:41:41.370
and I've had many students over the years and I got a few up there now that I

1609
01:41:42.221 --> 01:41:43.690
could say I'm starting to get API with.

1610
01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:46.940
But one thing where people are successful and you never hear it.

1611
01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:50.380
So that's what the senior sales between the eagles,

1612
01:41:51.550 --> 01:41:55.230
the Eagle won't fix new goals every year or so.
Um,

1613
01:41:56.230 --> 01:41:58.320
and I am what makes me real,

1614
01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:01.810
Tim is when I see somebody who they want to say his first world champion in

1615
01:42:01.811 --> 01:42:06.811
Jujitsu or another Mellison Kayak or are there other day I was in Stuttgart and

1616
01:42:08.531 --> 01:42:13.531
some Dutch student brought the equivalent that Dutch tradition of men's health

1617
01:42:14.621 --> 01:42:18.160
or men's fitness.
And they were talking about one of my Dutch students,

1618
01:42:18.161 --> 01:42:22.870
we train an Olympic medalist in rent and a guy gave me credit for that.

1619
01:42:23.130 --> 01:42:26.840
Uh,
which was nice to see in a foreign language,
you know,
that,
uh,

1620
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:29.740
my name gets out there.
But you know,
my,

1621
01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:34.800
my ultimate goal is to have one of my students meet my records of uh,

1622
01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:38.380
Olympians and world record holders.
I mean,

1623
01:42:38.410 --> 01:42:43.410
next year we have the Olympics in Rio and I'm training girls in wrestling and

1624
01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:47.240
I've never had Olympic medalists in wrestling.
So there would be 18 sports.

1625
01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:49.960
I found that you,

1626
01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:54.130
even though I teach on strength training almost every day,

1627
01:42:55.010 --> 01:42:59.940
you still have to keep your finger in the pie because you know,
so with the uh,

1628
01:43:00.250 --> 01:43:01.660
the three girls I coach,

1629
01:43:01.661 --> 01:43:05.710
I'm really applying my newer transmitter theory and all of them.

1630
01:43:05.890 --> 01:43:08.680
But again,
what about mindset?
We're in Cuba.

1631
01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:13.540
Each one of my girls won the gold medal.
Okay.
Uh,

1632
01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:16.370
and very definite the winds.

1633
01:43:16.930 --> 01:43:21.910
But the interesting thing is that they,
as soon as they get off the mat,

1634
01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:23.410
within two minutes,

1635
01:43:23.411 --> 01:43:27.820
they were sitting beside me asking me to evaluate what I thought they did right

1636
01:43:27.821 --> 01:43:32.821
or wrong and what could I infer from their fighting into their strength training

1637
01:43:33.431 --> 01:43:38.170
program design.
So there was,
for example,
you don't know,
and I said,

1638
01:43:38.171 --> 01:43:41.620
you know what?
Your risks are way too weak.
I said,

1639
01:43:41.621 --> 01:43:45.070
so we're going to work on your wrist.
And then Atlanta my rules,
I said,

1640
01:43:45.071 --> 01:43:46.810
your lower back is too weak.

1641
01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:50.380
She goes like he did he say that I said that when you move up and down is a way

1642
01:43:50.381 --> 01:43:55.381
to slow in order back his weekend and this other girl we would Vicky acid,

1643
01:43:56.181 --> 01:44:00.200
you need to do a more slow strength.
Your power is very good,

1644
01:44:00.201 --> 01:44:04.550
but we need more.
So strength,
which is w I rarely have to say that,

1645
01:44:04.551 --> 01:44:09.180
but in your case,
yes,
that's the one that's a mango,
some PCP.
So,

1646
01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:14.870
so,
so the,
the,
the point was that,

1647
01:44:15.190 --> 01:44:16.023
uh,

1648
01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:20.990
people who are winners always have a growth mindset.

1649
01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:23.360
And I,
you know,

1650
01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:28.480
I remember in 88 my first day with national ski team and I said,

1651
01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:33.050
after one workout,
I pointed out to one girl and I said,
you know,

1652
01:44:33.051 --> 01:44:35.210
she'll be really good one day.
And they all looked at me like,

1653
01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:38.180
what the hell do you know about Alpine skiing?
It says she'll,

1654
01:44:38.210 --> 01:44:42.110
she won't make it more than one year.
She was 15 at the time.
It was a very young,

1655
01:44:42.111 --> 01:44:42.980
during national team.

1656
01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:48.380
And in 1994 she was three.
She was world champion.

1657
01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:50.120
What did you see in her?

1658
01:44:50.150 --> 01:44:55.150
What did you notice at what I call the growth mindset in a sense that she can

1659
01:44:57.310 --> 01:45:00.050
after your workout and,
oh,
can I do this?
What can I do?

1660
01:45:00.051 --> 01:45:02.900
So I find that my best athletes,

1661
01:45:03.690 --> 01:45:08.600
nothing that I see and it's hard to measure your art to explain.
Um,

1662
01:45:08.970 --> 01:45:10.130
Richburg talked about,

1663
01:45:10.850 --> 01:45:15.850
he called it the intangible is that it's the attitude while you're doing a set.

1664
01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:19.760
One of my all time favorites was a grilling Karen Percy.

1665
01:45:19.761 --> 01:45:23.960
She won a bronze at the Olympics in two silver,
uh,

1666
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:27.440
two silvers or the wheels or a silver hundred Bronson like that.

1667
01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:32.800
But she could be friendly with her teammates in between sets.

1668
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:38.090
But when she picked up the bar,
she was on some other galaxy.

1669
01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:42.500
You could tell by her eyes that she was just doing the set,

1670
01:45:42.810 --> 01:45:46.940
but there was nothing you could have let off a hand grenade beside her.

1671
01:45:46.941 --> 01:45:51.941
She wouldn't have been jumped and look at all the guys have coach or ladies have

1672
01:45:52.071 --> 01:45:55.730
coaching,
move won Olympic medals.
They all have that,

1673
01:45:57.100 --> 01:46:01.580
you know,
fifth dimension look.
Teleportation ability.
Yes,

1674
01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:02.593
because they,

1675
01:46:02.780 --> 01:46:07.780
they live in a moment and they are absorbed in what they do and there's nothing

1676
01:46:08.991 --> 01:46:09.950
that will disturb them.

1677
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:12.251
<v 1>Just going to say,</v>

1678
01:46:12.251 --> 01:46:17.251
you mentioned these female wrestlers and a couple of questions came from fans of

1679
01:46:18.281 --> 01:46:22.120
mine about training a female clients.

1680
01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:27.360
And I'd be curious to hear what you think the perhaps biggest mistakes that are

1681
01:46:28.811 --> 01:46:32.530
made by trainers who train women or uh,
just the,

1682
01:46:32.540 --> 01:46:36.220
the biggest mistakes that say women make if they're training,

1683
01:46:36.221 --> 01:46:37.900
not necessarily to win an Olympic gold medal,

1684
01:46:37.901 --> 01:46:41.710
but just for the usual set of goals,
right.
To lose fat,

1685
01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:46.120
to look a bit better,
to be a bit stronger.
Um,
and uh,

1686
01:46:46.150 --> 01:46:51.060
I'll follow up with some,
uh,
some other questions related to athletic goals,

1687
01:46:51.061 --> 01:46:55.830
but what are some of the mistakes in your mind that you see most frequently with

1688
01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:57.600
the trainers?
With female clients?

1689
01:46:58.150 --> 01:47:02.800
<v 4>I would say the biggest mistake is not wanting to get strong,</v>

1690
01:47:03.190 --> 01:47:07.590
you know,
the
getting strong.
Does it make you a bad person?

1691
01:47:08.010 --> 01:47:12.300
So the f I would say from the outside,

1692
01:47:12.301 --> 01:47:17.070
if I were to criticize the industry or give a fair evaluation,

1693
01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:20.850
there's not enough time spent on overload with women,

1694
01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:22.710
you know,

1695
01:47:22.710 --> 01:47:27.710
in a sense that they don't have goals to for strength.

1696
01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:29.090
So you know,

1697
01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:34.160
they should have shorter goals to comply to you because you know what,

1698
01:47:35.731 --> 01:47:39.450
it's a dead lift or you look at one of my top students,

1699
01:47:39.451 --> 01:47:43.510
her name is Kelly Martinovich,
she's other Perth,
Australia.
You go to Virginia.

1700
01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:47.190
Do you really impressed with the quality of the physique of people that we're

1701
01:47:47.191 --> 01:47:51.190
going to?
Opo Mines or dental assistants,
all the female,

1702
01:47:51.191 --> 01:47:56.190
she trains are in great shape and he could be like seven years old.
Uh,
but,
uh,

1703
01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:59.370
one of my students,
Jess and Sydney,

1704
01:47:59.790 --> 01:48:04.770
she has a lady that's over 80 and this woman is dead lifting,

1705
01:48:04.860 --> 01:48:08.610
you know,
some pretty big,
you wage a good form and there's no excuses.

1706
01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:13.640
So I find that where women lack the most is guidance to how to get strong or

1707
01:48:15.091 --> 01:48:20.040
the,
or being sold and they barely to get strong because,
uh,

1708
01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:24.330
in body composition you need to build lean tissue.

1709
01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:26.940
When it be linked tissue,
you're more insulin sensitive,

1710
01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:30.240
the more insulin sensitive they are,
the easier it is to burn fat,
blah,
blah,
blah,

1711
01:48:30.241 --> 01:48:35.190
blah blah.
So,
uh,
what I don't like is what I call entered training.

1712
01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:39.810
So they keep the people happy and busy,

1713
01:48:39.811 --> 01:48:42.030
but busy doesn't mean productive.
Okay.

1714
01:48:42.390 --> 01:48:46.460
So I like people to have productive outcome.
Um,

1715
01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:49.770
one thing that has helped the industry tremendously actually is crossfit.

1716
01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:53.470
<v 1>And that,
that was actually the next question was sort of the uh,
what you,</v>

1717
01:48:53.530 --> 01:48:56.350
what you take from crossfit that's good.
Bad or in between.

1718
01:48:57.490 --> 01:49:01.930
<v 4>Okay.
People think I'm anti crossfit for some unjust reason,</v>

1719
01:49:02.260 --> 01:49:04.460
but I think crossfit w what a,

1720
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:07.360
I'll tell you what I like about what the work hard,

1721
01:49:07.780 --> 01:49:11.350
do the work smart and not so much,
but you do work hard.

1722
01:49:11.351 --> 01:49:15.070
So the intention is there.
Okay.
So,
uh,

1723
01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:20.310
one of the is a very good on Gary and provert.
If you only got one asks,

1724
01:49:20.311 --> 01:49:24.690
you can't sit on two horses.
So,
so the,

1725
01:49:24.691 --> 01:49:28.480
the problem in most crossfit boxes is they trying to accomplish too many things.

1726
01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:32.290
Like I said,
simple is better.
And you know,

1727
01:49:32.291 --> 01:49:34.210
those guys with the crossfit games,

1728
01:49:34.420 --> 01:49:36.760
and I know for a fact they're trained by good strength coaches,

1729
01:49:37.150 --> 01:49:40.300
but to comply with politics,

1730
01:49:40.301 --> 01:49:42.790
they say doody w o WOD to workout of the day,

1731
01:49:42.970 --> 01:49:47.200
which is complete bullshit because I've done consulting for those coaches on to

1732
01:49:47.201 --> 01:49:51.280
train for crossfit event.
So for example,
cough,
uh,

1733
01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:54.820
my core lecture in Ceres does very well at,
across as games,

1734
01:49:54.821 --> 01:49:59.110
but you certainly doesn't do the workout of the day to get there.
So the,

1735
01:49:59.710 --> 01:50:02.230
so the intention is good.
They use basic,

1736
01:50:02.231 --> 01:50:06.010
simple result producing exercise that I like.

1737
01:50:06.610 --> 01:50:11.610
Where I don't like is that there's an oral screening before people come in.

1738
01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:17.620
So where did they don't do is that they'll look at people's orthopedic issues.

1739
01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:23.220
So if I were again emperor of all galaxies and you wanted to crossfit license,

1740
01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:27.160
people should be screened or if they're repeatedly,

1741
01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:32.380
and then usually within eight to 12 weeks you can straighten out somebody and

1742
01:50:32.381 --> 01:50:33.670
then they can do crossfit.

1743
01:50:33.730 --> 01:50:38.730
But I find the best crossfit boxes are all in Scandinavia.

1744
01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:44.350
Uh,
they tend to do a more intelligent approach to that.

1745
01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:49.510
And then the military and I have been all over the world teaching and he's,

1746
01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:54.100
he's been a lot of crossfit boxes and asked him some questions.
He says,
yeah,

1747
01:50:54.101 --> 01:50:58.840
Denmark,
Sweden,
Norway.
They tend to do a better job.
And why do you think that is?

1748
01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:03.650
I think that it's just as to do an education.
The trainers are there,

1749
01:51:03.660 --> 01:51:08.000
are better educated.
And the third thing I like about crossfit is that there's,

1750
01:51:08.230 --> 01:51:11.080
they're big to the Palio eating.
Uh,

1751
01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:14.080
so they're more conscious about the nutrition.
You go to planet fitness,

1752
01:51:14.081 --> 01:51:17.020
there's chocolate milk and pizza night on Friday.
Right?

1753
01:51:17.050 --> 01:51:19.390
But like what the fuck's the point?

1754
01:51:19.391 --> 01:51:23.800
Where do you want to be pro inflammatory foods?
So,
um,
so,

1755
01:51:24.670 --> 01:51:29.530
so the,
the way to make crossfit better is actually,
for example,

1756
01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:34.500
there's an accident where a guy severe,
this is fine with us.
It was,

1757
01:51:34.510 --> 01:51:37.300
I think he was performing snatch,
right?
Yeah.
Well,

1758
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:42.350
one of the first thing that we're learning that was taught was how to get out of

1759
01:51:43.001 --> 01:51:46.760
trouble.
So they say if the bar she feel it goes like this,
get rid of it by,

1760
01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:49.030
that'd be an it backwards or forwards.

1761
01:51:49.330 --> 01:51:52.180
And you jump accordingly depending on the direction and the bar,

1762
01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:56.560
while obviously someone didn't teach him that because you made a rookie mistake

1763
01:51:56.561 --> 01:52:01.120
by dropping it improperly.
Um,
so,

1764
01:52:01.570 --> 01:52:02.350
you know,

1765
01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:07.350
the Olympic lifts are complicated things and to do Olympic lifts for repetitions

1766
01:52:08.681 --> 01:52:13.280
is utterly stupid.
So I don't believe in that.
Uh,

1767
01:52:13.810 --> 01:52:16.660
my colleague clock off office a bit less diplomatic.

1768
01:52:16.661 --> 01:52:20.950
A knee if you can believe that.
What does cluck offs is that his last name?

1769
01:52:20.951 --> 01:52:24.610
His first name,
last name.
Give me the clock off the clock off.

1770
01:52:24.670 --> 01:52:27.790
We're talking about the guy with the thunder thighs.
I mean,
an incredible actor.

1771
01:52:28.610 --> 01:52:31.450
Dimitri is amazing.
Okay.
I didn't realize you were a co lecturing with them.

1772
01:52:31.451 --> 01:52:34.870
That's incredible.
Yeah,
I did a and doing another tour with them.

1773
01:52:34.871 --> 01:52:39.610
We're going to Toronto,
Las Vegas and four places in Australia,

1774
01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:43.540
but I teach with them and we split the days.
But you'll say something new.

1775
01:52:43.590 --> 01:52:47.530
She's deep equal American crossfit bullshit and

1776
01:52:49.300 --> 01:52:51.380
you know,
yeah.
Educates.

1777
01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:56.680
But all the crossfit attendees love him because he's got solutions to crossfit

1778
01:52:57.111 --> 01:53:00.380
problems.
Um,
the thing with Dimitri,

1779
01:53:00.381 --> 01:53:05.381
I love lecturing with him because he will make sure that 100% of the students

1780
01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:09.050
learn,
they'll go to every single person.

1781
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:13.190
And I've been in this business 38 years and they're at some of the stuff,

1782
01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:16.880
you show him how to learn the next size.
And they were seeing,

1783
01:53:17.180 --> 01:53:18.590
so the Soviet approach,

1784
01:53:19.130 --> 01:53:24.130
they don't like to teach you by talking the teach you by what the infringer

1785
01:53:24.771 --> 01:53:27.470
called AIDS gets stiff.
So educational exercise,

1786
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:30.600
so it won't say put your hips forward in making,

1787
01:53:30.620 --> 01:53:35.510
do an exercise to make your hips go forward or if you,
uh,
so all,

1788
01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:39.230
all corrections are done to a specific exercise,

1789
01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:44.030
which corrects a technical mistake.
So there's very little talking.

1790
01:53:44.690 --> 01:53:49.040
It,
a lot of it is,
is about kinesthetic learning.
Uh,
I really liked that.

1791
01:53:49.110 --> 01:53:51.570
<v 1>No,
just to,
to add to that,
um,</v>

1792
01:53:52.050 --> 01:53:55.350
and I haven't had a lot of experience with the eastern European strength
coaches,

1793
01:53:55.351 --> 01:53:56.184
but the,
uh,

1794
01:53:56.460 --> 01:53:59.980
the Polish gent that I'm working with right now is exactly the same way.

1795
01:53:59.981 --> 01:54:01.890
You know,
I asked him his opinion,
I won't mention names,

1796
01:54:01.891 --> 01:54:06.060
but of a very famous woman who teaches posture improving posture.
And he said,

1797
01:54:06.061 --> 01:54:08.910
well,
I think it's bullshit because you can't just tell someone to improve their

1798
01:54:08.911 --> 01:54:09.271
posture.

1799
01:54:09.271 --> 01:54:12.300
You have to take them through movements that forced them to prove their posture.

1800
01:54:13.020 --> 01:54:14.600
And uh,
it's,
uh,

1801
01:54:14.601 --> 01:54:18.180
it's been really fascinating to work with them because like you said,
it's,

1802
01:54:18.181 --> 01:54:22.830
it's very light on words,
but a high on sort of progressive exercises.

1803
01:54:23.430 --> 01:54:27.900
Um,
what are some of the crossfit problems that to be true has helped athletes,

1804
01:54:28.410 --> 01:54:29.640
uh,
fix for themselves?

1805
01:54:30.150 --> 01:54:32.550
<v 4>Well,
when you take the seminar,
the first thing,</v>

1806
01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:37.550
the way he does it is that I teach in morning.
All right,

1807
01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:40.560
some stuff and I'll tell you what he does.

1808
01:54:40.561 --> 01:54:45.300
He shows up and he works out.
He does one or two exercise in front of everybody.

1809
01:54:45.301 --> 01:54:48.330
But this guy is amazing.
I was in Montreal.

1810
01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:53.190
It was the day after he landed from Moscow.
So he was supposed to be jet lagged.

1811
01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:57.390
You slept in the van,
20 minutes of the 40 minute ride,
didn't drink water,

1812
01:54:57.391 --> 01:55:01.050
didn't drink coffee,
didn't have breakfast.
You shows up six warm upset,

1813
01:55:01.260 --> 01:55:04.380
he takes 180 kilos,
396 pounds.

1814
01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:07.830
Power cleans it and push presses twice.

1815
01:55:09.770 --> 01:55:12.830
<v 1>Okay.
And just so people can imagine this,</v>

1816
01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:18.140
Dimitri does not look like,
uh,
he,
he's not a big fat power lifter.

1817
01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:21.200
Um,
this guy looks like Hercules.

1818
01:55:21.201 --> 01:55:25.440
He is not it remotely.
I mean,
what do you think his body fat has to be?
I mean it,

1819
01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:27.610
<v 4>well it's about 6%,
but yeah,</v>

1820
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:31.110
right now you wait 218 kilos and it's about six feet tall.

1821
01:55:31.111 --> 01:55:34.310
So he's about to 60 at six feet.
I mean,

1822
01:55:34.311 --> 01:55:38.270
you could see his pancreas make insulin when you as a pizza.
So,
but

1823
01:55:40.350 --> 01:55:43.890
I mean,
there's a lot of funny stuff.
Like we were in a restaurant,
Montreal

1824
01:55:44.030 --> 01:55:46.800
<v 5>and the grill goes,
sir,
what would you like to drink?
He goes,</v>

1825
01:55:46.890 --> 01:55:51.450
I want to cock like cook.
So I said,

1826
01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:53.520
in French,
no you mustn't Coca Cola.

1827
01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:57.810
And of course Paul Carter was there.
He didn't want to be left out.

1828
01:55:58.020 --> 01:56:00.690
So when the girl asking,
what would you like to drink?
So he sees a cock,

1829
01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:08.040
but you know,
so we had the correct as English a bit,
but it's a lot better now.

1830
01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:12.710
And they are seen a freak,
uh,

1831
01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:16.920
every day that he teaches it is 95%,

1832
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:20.850
200% of the world record as like the first demonstration.

1833
01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:24.360
Then then we break for lunch,

1834
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:27.360
then I teach mobility for the Olympic lifts.

1835
01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:30.840
And then Dimitri,
we'll save,
for example,

1836
01:56:30.841 --> 01:56:33.930
the first day will be snatched and he'll go all these progressions.

1837
01:56:33.931 --> 01:56:38.190
So the crossfitter we'll know on Friday out of snatch properly.

1838
01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:43.200
And,
and he,
he says,
if you don't do PB,

1839
01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:47.690
no dinner for you.
So that is where clients that every asked to do with PB,

1840
01:56:48.060 --> 01:56:49.260
then it makes it,
yeah,

1841
01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:53.520
the next day you'll do some of freak lift,

1842
01:56:53.910 --> 01:56:56.040
then you'll teach clean jerk at all.

1843
01:56:56.100 --> 01:57:00.360
So I teach art to get flexible from the claim check because a lot of people do

1844
01:57:00.361 --> 01:57:02.670
the exercise,
but they shouldn't,
they don't deserve to do it.

1845
01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.790
So as shown on about an hour and a half,
I'll to be dessert,
uh,

1846
01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:08.160
deserve to clincher.

1847
01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:12.390
And on Sundays he teaches them out of squat.

1848
01:57:13.690 --> 01:57:18.260
He teaches a bunch of different,
uh,
corrective lists,
um,

1849
01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:23.160
and you know,
the,
the work their butts off,
uh,
with them.

1850
01:57:23.490 --> 01:57:27.780
But the big ones,
the crossfitters get out of it is actually how to do the list,

1851
01:57:28.170 --> 01:57:32.040
but also teach them,
you know,
and very important.

1852
01:57:32.430 --> 01:57:36.780
I think he could seriously teach somebody at a snatch and 20 minutes,
but,

1853
01:57:37.140 --> 01:57:39.240
uh,
and the,
the technique would be perfect,

1854
01:57:39.241 --> 01:57:42.570
but it's not what you see in crossfit boxes Baney means.

1855
01:57:43.230 --> 01:57:45.870
So speaking of the snatch,
the,
um,

1856
01:57:46.860 --> 01:57:51.830
technically can be a pretty subtle nuanced to movement once.

1857
01:57:51.860 --> 01:57:56.130
What are your favorite mobility exercises?

1858
01:57:56.131 --> 01:58:00.300
You mentioned mobility exercises for preparing someone for a movement,

1859
01:58:00.301 --> 01:58:01.260
like the snatch,

1860
01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:06.360
the biggest problem in the snatch usually is,

1861
01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:07.290
uh,

1862
01:58:07.890 --> 01:58:12.890
out to activate the external rotators of the shoulder and out to make the

1863
01:58:13.171 --> 01:58:15.030
internal rotators loose.

1864
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:18.690
So I spent a lot of time on different flexibility exercise.

1865
01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:23.490
Sometimes I teach them acupuncture points that instantly correct.
Uh,
the issue,

1866
01:58:23.491 --> 01:58:25.110
I mean,
you,
you took that class in New York,

1867
01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:28.980
so it a time savers and,
um,

1868
01:58:30.210 --> 01:58:35.210
the biggest issue in the snatch is actually a good year.

1869
01:58:35.221 --> 01:58:37.470
Rotator cuff is and uh,

1870
01:58:37.830 --> 01:58:42.030
we spend an hour and a half on that obviously started to do

1871
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:43.720
<v 4>by podcasts,
demonstrate them,</v>

1872
01:58:43.721 --> 01:58:47.890
but we go to secrets as their nails or show them our,

1873
01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:52.480
to identify why the bar is not going into what we call the slot.
Right.

1874
01:58:52.540 --> 01:58:54.560
And then,
um,
we,

1875
01:58:54.720 --> 01:58:59.720
we also showed them a corrective exercises they could do on their own to

1876
01:58:59.771 --> 01:59:02.620
strengthen those muscles so they can put the barn into the slot.

1877
01:59:03.670 --> 01:59:08.280
<v 1>And um,
is there who we can,
we can approach this from a different angle.
Yeah.</v>

1878
01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:11.800
Are there mobility exercises for the shoulder?

1879
01:59:11.801 --> 01:59:16.300
Let's just say it's in the context of Olympic lifting or overhead lifting that

1880
01:59:16.330 --> 01:59:19.570
you think should be thrown out or that,
uh,

1881
01:59:19.630 --> 01:59:21.220
that you would not recommend people do?

1882
01:59:23.390 --> 01:59:28.100
<v 4>Actually,
I can't answer that.
I,</v>

1883
01:59:28.490 --> 01:59:31.100
I like to teach the correct way so I'm not got it.

1884
01:59:31.590 --> 01:59:34.220
Not over focused on the bad way.

1885
01:59:34.710 --> 01:59:39.090
<v 1>Yeah.
I just knew so many people who have injured shoulders.
Um,</v>

1886
01:59:41.070 --> 01:59:43.800
what our exercises,
just,
I'll try this one more time.

1887
01:59:43.801 --> 01:59:45.120
If you don't want to answer it,
it's fine.

1888
01:59:45.150 --> 01:59:48.660
But are there any exercises that you would,
aside from the,
the,

1889
01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:53.720
the balancing sort of contra lateral stuff and the cardio machines.

1890
01:59:54.091 --> 01:59:56.670
So there are other free weight exercises that you,

1891
01:59:56.730 --> 02:00:01.590
you think you would remove for novice and intermediate trainees?

1892
02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:06.800
<v 4>I would,
there's some that I would remove for all cases.
One,
the goblet squat,</v>

1893
02:00:07.880 --> 02:00:10.370
that is such a moronic exercise.

1894
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:15.560
Basically you're limited by the strength of your rhomboids anterior deltoids and

1895
02:00:15.561 --> 02:00:16.400
the elbow flexors.

1896
02:00:16.580 --> 02:00:20.690
So if you can do a goblet squat and overall of your legs,

1897
02:00:20.850 --> 02:00:25.430
these are you going to really,
really weak legs.
You should be in a wheelchair.

1898
02:00:25.730 --> 02:00:28.950
So that's moronic exercise.
Uh,

1899
02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:33.070
a lot of the kettlebell stuff,
like the Kettlebell swings,

1900
02:00:33.260 --> 02:00:34.880
if ask any chiropractor,

1901
02:00:35.210 --> 02:00:40.210
they'll tell you their business went up for disc injuries when they add a

1902
02:00:40.761 --> 02:00:44.780
crossfit box opening up next door that did a lot of kettlebell swings.
Um,

1903
02:00:45.140 --> 02:00:49.250
I think the kettle bells swings is very harmful to the destruction.

1904
02:00:49.490 --> 02:00:54.020
But the thing is the,
the way it arms you,
it's like a dental cavity.

1905
02:00:54.380 --> 02:00:58.160
It doesn't happen overnight.
So,
uh,
you know,

1906
02:00:58.161 --> 02:01:00.740
you don't brush your teeth and railing basis one day early out of the cavity,

1907
02:01:00.741 --> 02:01:03.680
but people don't make,
you know,
so the,

1908
02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:07.910
it all make the link between the tenable and swing and or back problems.
Uh,

1909
02:01:07.940 --> 02:01:12.190
that's an exercise I really hate.
Um,
one exercise I find overrated,

1910
02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:16.550
just plunk,
uh,
and I don't want to fund bodily Moronic is glue,

1911
02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:19.550
uh,
bridges,
um,

1912
02:01:19.700 --> 02:01:22.220
<v 1>got like the,
uh,
the kind of Supine glute bridges.</v>

1913
02:01:22.350 --> 02:01:23.890
<v 4>Yeah.
That's,</v>

1914
02:01:24.390 --> 02:01:27.290
there's so many exercises that recruit the glutes more effective than that.

1915
02:01:27.450 --> 02:01:28.680
And if it was dyed great,

1916
02:01:28.860 --> 02:01:32.940
all Olympic lifters and power lifters would do it because success in Olympic

1917
02:01:32.941 --> 02:01:37.860
lifting and high jump,
long jump is glute strength dependent.

1918
02:01:38.250 --> 02:01:39.980
And no one does an exercise because it's a

1919
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:44.720
<v 5>more chronic exercise.
Uh,
the thing that had the load,
if you're in any strong,</v>

1920
02:01:44.721 --> 02:01:46.610
the load,
if,
first of all,

1921
02:01:47.210 --> 02:01:51.200
when does it ever happen that the load is on the,
uh,

1922
02:01:51.410 --> 02:01:54.530
anterior pelvis area in,
in real life?

1923
02:01:54.590 --> 02:01:57.380
Only if you dismount and obese sexual partner.

1924
02:01:58.230 --> 02:02:01.190
I mean that,
that,
that movement pattern,

1925
02:02:01.191 --> 02:02:05.930
but an overloading their Atkinson in life.
So,
I mean,
unless you'd like to date,

1926
02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:10.820
we'll be swimming.
But,
uh,
it's,
it's a nonfunctional pattern.

1927
02:02:11.630 --> 02:02:16.520
And again,
for cervical health,
I'm not convinced it's the greatest thing for you,

1928
02:02:16.521 --> 02:02:19.580
but because it's like cavities,
the damage is done over time.

1929
02:02:19.850 --> 02:02:22.750
People don't associate the problems.
Uh,

1930
02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:27.240
<v 6>what are good exercises for glute activation or engaging the glutes.</v>

1931
02:02:28.570 --> 02:02:32.320
<v 5>You can't be dead lifts and squats and any type of split squats.
I mean,</v>

1932
02:02:32.350 --> 02:02:36.340
those will transfer it to ordinary activities.
You know,

1933
02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:39.600
everyday life activities.
They'll improve your vertical John dealing,

1934
02:02:39.650 --> 02:02:44.470
improve your results,
hold jumping the ability and so on.
Um,

1935
02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:48.640
but the thing is is that you look at it guys who we advocate as exercise,

1936
02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.900
look at her track record.
It doesn't exist the then they were pretty sad anybody.

1937
02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:57.400
But what I see in this industry is,

1938
02:02:58.290 --> 02:02:58.630
you know,

1939
02:02:58.630 --> 02:03:02.470
it's a very normal human nature to figure out where you are in the food chain.

1940
02:03:03.130 --> 02:03:07.450
And these guys want to move up the food chain by son seeing something different.

1941
02:03:07.930 --> 02:03:12.860
And I always use your analogy of,
uh,
uh,

1942
02:03:13.150 --> 02:03:14.320
if you go to do something different,

1943
02:03:14.380 --> 02:03:17.560
it has to be an improvement or has to be more fun.
And I use it,

1944
02:03:17.561 --> 02:03:20.420
the animals you could give up wearing your underwear over your jeans.

1945
02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:24.370
So I find that's a good example.
But

1946
02:03:27.190 --> 02:03:31.580
a lot of new stuff is like wearing your underwear or over your genes.
It,

1947
02:03:31.620 --> 02:03:35.170
it's no improvement and it's the only thing that's fun for us with people

1948
02:03:35.171 --> 02:03:36.490
watching you,
you know,

1949
02:03:36.580 --> 02:03:40.590
because they make fun of you wearing your underwear or over your genes.
So the,

1950
02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:41.613
the,

1951
02:03:43.490 --> 02:03:47.920
<v 6>like I said,
there's nothing new since 1896 in my opinion.
So,
uh,</v>

1952
02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:50.390
there's better ways to do the stuff from 1896,

1953
02:03:50.391 --> 02:03:52.490
but the concepts were there a long time ago.

1954
02:03:53.060 --> 02:03:56.810
Did you think there's a question about swings with the Kettlebell swing.

1955
02:03:57.650 --> 02:04:00.890
Do you think that kettlebell swings or harmful or,

1956
02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:03.750
I guess I'm curious the,
um,

1957
02:04:04.460 --> 02:04:09.460
are they harmful in any tech you'd given any technique for the swing or is part

1958
02:04:11.691 --> 02:04:13.940
of the harm from say,

1959
02:04:13.941 --> 02:04:18.230
a Kettlebell crossfit box in the way that they perform the Kettlebell swing?

1960
02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:19.551
That's it.

1961
02:04:19.551 --> 02:04:24.551
There's no safe way to do the Kettlebell swing is an exercise called a lumber

1962
02:04:24.561 --> 02:04:28.630
jack,
where use a,
uh,
basically a loaded post.

1963
02:04:28.631 --> 02:04:31.160
But in,
in the lumberjack,

1964
02:04:31.770 --> 02:04:36.180
<v 5>the bar is moved vertically,
not into a swing process.
So people say,
well,</v>

1965
02:04:36.181 --> 02:04:38.180
you recommend the,
yeah,
but the lumberjack,

1966
02:04:38.180 --> 02:04:41.760
<v 3>he's like a different load pattern for the power snatch.</v>

1967
02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:44.250
You look at click off,

1968
02:04:44.251 --> 02:04:46.920
and I were talking about this when they ask us to buy the Kettlebell swing,

1969
02:04:47.250 --> 02:04:48.990
the goal in weightlifting is still,

1970
02:04:48.991 --> 02:04:53.800
it's the most weight in the most vertical way.
So the,

1971
02:04:54.210 --> 02:04:55.880
the best way to lift a lot of weight,

1972
02:04:55.910 --> 02:04:58.260
especially keep the weight in a straight line.

1973
02:04:58.650 --> 02:05:00.840
The more or resentful displacements,

1974
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:05.150
there's a bar that there's more wasted effort and less weight is lifted.
So,

1975
02:05:05.290 --> 02:05:09.060
you know,
that has been studied in biomechanics for years.

1976
02:05:10.290 --> 02:05:13.080
There's no,
there's no two ways about it.

1977
02:05:13.081 --> 02:05:16.060
So when a don't like about the Kettlebell swing,
he said,

1978
02:05:16.070 --> 02:05:19.920
but the way it displaces away from the dish,

1979
02:05:19.950 --> 02:05:23.700
not in squatting,
uh,

1980
02:05:23.850 --> 02:05:27.750
or snatches or cleaner,
the bar always stays close to the center of gravity.

1981
02:05:28.810 --> 02:05:29.643
<v 6>Got It.</v>

1982
02:05:29.730 --> 02:05:34.730
So I have a couple of questions from fans of the podcast who have put things out

1983
02:05:36.761 --> 02:05:40.420
on Twitter and Facebook.
So you've,
you've answered quite a few of them already,

1984
02:05:41.020 --> 02:05:45.490
but this one is from Mia Health Urban Easter.
Uh,

1985
02:05:45.520 --> 02:05:49.120
what are your thoughts on achieving maximum strength on a plant based diet?

1986
02:05:49.240 --> 02:05:51.160
Only plant place,
plant based Diet.

1987
02:05:53.460 --> 02:05:57.690
<v 5>Never seen it.
I mean the answer's quite</v>

1988
02:05:59.220 --> 02:06:00.070
the Chaz.

1989
02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:06.650
You need meat to get strong.
I mean,

1990
02:06:07.400 --> 02:06:09.380
I eat my vegetables to the animals I eat.

1991
02:06:09.500 --> 02:06:12.310
I mean they did the vegetable eating for me.
So

1992
02:06:13.970 --> 02:06:14.870
to be serious,

1993
02:06:15.230 --> 02:06:20.230
I've never seen a worldclass strength athlete that was only in a plan base that

1994
02:06:22.040 --> 02:06:26.810
I've seen octo electro vegetarians.
Uh,
uh,

1995
02:06:27.020 --> 02:06:31.970
I've seen one
you could call a vegetarian,

1996
02:06:31.971 --> 02:06:35.960
but it's still that,
uh,
egg products and dairy products,
but it Vegan,

1997
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:38.060
super strong athlete,
never seen it.

1998
02:06:39.130 --> 02:06:40.550
<v 6>Got It.
Uh,</v>

1999
02:06:40.610 --> 02:06:45.610
next is from Emily House high bar versus low bar squat sumo versus conventional

2000
02:06:46.151 --> 02:06:47.770
dead lift.
Pros and cons.

2001
02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:53.550
<v 5>They all have pros and cons.
The in regarding to dead lift.</v>

2002
02:06:54.150 --> 02:06:58.740
Uh,
they're both good.
I would see it.
Okay.
The question is,

2003
02:06:58.741 --> 02:06:59.570
what is the goal?

2004
02:06:59.570 --> 02:07:03.090
You want to move a lot of weight for short distance so you can win a

2005
02:07:03.091 --> 02:07:04.110
powerlifting competition.

2006
02:07:04.111 --> 02:07:08.730
Will most will record olders do it in the sumo because you've got a better

2007
02:07:08.731 --> 02:07:12.060
mechanics.
But for training purposes,

2008
02:07:12.510 --> 02:07:16.020
I think you should change both.
For power lifting.

2009
02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:21.180
The goal is can I displace the ice amount of weight for a given range of motion?

2010
02:07:21.450 --> 02:07:24.510
So the low bar squat will allow you to do that.

2011
02:07:26.100 --> 02:07:29.550
Think about longterm health.
Uh,

2012
02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:32.120
you look at high bar squats.

2013
02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:37.390
The reason I say that is that you look the incidence of hip replacement and

2014
02:07:37.391 --> 02:07:40.600
power lifters versus a weightlifters,

2015
02:07:40.630 --> 02:07:44.680
it's much greater than power of the three years because of the,
uh,
you,

2016
02:07:44.681 --> 02:07:48.640
my good friend Ed Kona,
total hip replacement.

2017
02:07:48.970 --> 02:07:53.800
So the fact that you restrict the range of motion does in a lot of pure forms,

2018
02:07:53.801 --> 02:07:58.630
for example,
and the,
all the rotators of the hip to gain optimal range.

2019
02:07:58.990 --> 02:08:03.070
So if you are or can be,
again,
it goes back to the goal.

2020
02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:07.150
Do you want to compete in a powerlifting and you want to be world champion?
Well,

2021
02:08:07.630 --> 02:08:11.890
you got a much higher squad,
the low bar squat.
But if you looking at uh,

2022
02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:15.130
squatting with a lot of,
carry over to our different activities,

2023
02:08:15.610 --> 02:08:16.960
I would say the high bar squat,

2024
02:08:16.990 --> 02:08:19.300
if you're going to pick one is your best investment.

2025
02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:20.860
<v 1>If you,</v>

2026
02:08:20.860 --> 02:08:25.860
if you had to pick the high bar back squat front squat or overhead squat as the

2027
02:08:27.741 --> 02:08:30.200
only squat you could use for

2028
02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:35.430
<v 5>athletes you work with,
which one would you use?
The front squat.
And this,</v>

2029
02:08:35.431 --> 02:08:39.390
I have a lot of statistical data on that because

2030
02:08:40.950 --> 02:08:45.540
it is impossible to cheat on the front squat,

2031
02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:49.770
but I'm talking ass to the grass front squat,

2032
02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:54.060
meaning you leave a stain in the carpet in the bottom position.
Uh,

2033
02:08:54.210 --> 02:08:57.990
in my opinion,
for athletic purposes,
all squares should,
he'd done that wick.

2034
02:08:58.350 --> 02:09:01.830
The overhead squat is a screening exercise,

2035
02:09:02.070 --> 02:09:06.360
so it's very good to assess just with an empty bar or even a broomstick.

2036
02:09:06.361 --> 02:09:09.930
The potential for lower extremity injuries.

2037
02:09:09.990 --> 02:09:11.820
But as far as the training exercise,

2038
02:09:12.270 --> 02:09:16.050
you're going to be limited by your shoulder girdle strength.

2039
02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:19.590
So I think that you could do it as a,

2040
02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:23.910
you know,
what I call a change of pace workout,

2041
02:09:23.940 --> 02:09:26.370
but I wouldn't use it as a training exercise,
that's for sure.

2042
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:30.040
<v 1>And with the,
with the front squat from a technical standpoint,</v>

2043
02:09:30.060 --> 02:09:34.290
do you have any particular,
assuming people aren't competing in Olympic lifting,

2044
02:09:34.710 --> 02:09:38.250
and do you have any preference in terms of arm placement?

2045
02:09:38.340 --> 02:09:41.280
Do you have the arms kind of folded back with the elbows elevated?

2046
02:09:41.281 --> 02:09:44.240
Do you have them crossed over?
Um,

2047
02:09:44.590 --> 02:09:46.840
<v 5>no,
they should use it the way the Olympic lifters do it.</v>

2048
02:09:46.841 --> 02:09:49.420
So a slightly wider than shoulder width,

2049
02:09:49.810 --> 02:09:54.810
elbows up as high as you can and actually the elbows in that locks to bar,

2050
02:09:55.060 --> 02:09:58.630
uh,
into right in front of your throat if you can.

2051
02:09:58.870 --> 02:10:01.630
If you find the exercise comfortable and the front squat,

2052
02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:03.990
you're not doing it correctly.
Uh,

2053
02:10:04.060 --> 02:10:09.060
you should feel some restriction in the neck when you front squat properly.

2054
02:10:09.340 --> 02:10:12.880
Of course,
after a few weeks you won't feel the,

2055
02:10:12.970 --> 02:10:14.440
it's like if you wear a wet t shirt,

2056
02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:17.590
it's uncomfortable for the first five minutes then after that to get used to it.

2057
02:10:17.591 --> 02:10:22.591
So people will tolerate the stress of not breathing properly within a few

2058
02:10:23.501 --> 02:10:26.590
workouts.
But,
um,
for example,

2059
02:10:26.890 --> 02:10:28.900
in sports and a lot of sports,

2060
02:10:29.660 --> 02:10:32.640
I have developed formulas where if I know your front squat,

2061
02:10:32.680 --> 02:10:34.580
let's say you incline press and your power snatch,

2062
02:10:34.970 --> 02:10:37.590
I can tell how fast you can speed skate or office.

2063
02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:42.140
You can push a bobsled or whatever else.
I call them predictive formulas.

2064
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:46.810
But when I use a squat for prediction purposes,
uh,

2065
02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:48.520
I only use the front squat.

2066
02:10:49.460 --> 02:10:53.960
<v 6>Got It.
This next question is from John Fox,
uh,</v>

2067
02:10:54.230 --> 02:10:56.480
who is apparently a very big fan of your blog.

2068
02:10:56.510 --> 02:11:00.500
Literally check it every day for new articles.
And that's a,

2069
02:11:00.501 --> 02:11:04.280
that's strength Sensei,
strength Sensei to calm.

2070
02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:06.950
He's question.
He has a,
he had quite a few questions,

2071
02:11:06.951 --> 02:11:10.880
but I'm selecting a few here.
A one is what are the most bang for your buck?

2072
02:11:10.940 --> 02:11:14.000
Things that people can do to improve testosterone and sex drive.

2073
02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:22.110
<v 5>Some people won't be happy with the answers.
Change central partners</v>

2074
02:11:24.660 --> 02:11:27.060
as a route for testosterone.

2075
02:11:31.570 --> 02:11:36.520
Actually the best thing to increase the star stone is to low record as all

2076
02:11:37.240 --> 02:11:39.400
because the same,
uh,

2077
02:11:40.570 --> 02:11:45.570
raw material that makes testosterone and cortisol is called pregnenolone.

2078
02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.550
And then under conditions of stress,

2079
02:11:49.610 --> 02:11:54.610
your body is wired to preferentially go towards the cortisol pathway.

2080
02:11:55.670 --> 02:11:59.530
So anything that lowers cortisol,
uh,

2081
02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:02.720
will increase testosterone.
So for example,

2082
02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:06.470
diminishing the amount of radiation exposure at cell phones,

2083
02:12:06.471 --> 02:12:10.820
computer use a lot,
get off the fucking Facebook.
That would be one.

2084
02:12:10.821 --> 02:12:14.880
The so,
uh,
that,
um,
high zinc,

2085
02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:20.750
high protein containing foods,
I eat meat.
Uh,

2086
02:12:21.290 --> 02:12:24.750
this is a lot of research that backs up meat consumption for improving

2087
02:12:24.751 --> 02:12:27.190
testosterone.
So,
uh,

2088
02:12:28.530 --> 02:12:32.340
eating more meat but more red meat.
But of course,

2089
02:12:33.060 --> 02:12:37.560
you know,
the quality of the meat makes it a big difference.

2090
02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.670
Cold exposure to cold baths will increase testosterone.

2091
02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:46.880
<v 6>What type of duration or frequency your or a protocol would you suggest</v>

2092
02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:50.550
<v 5>and not up to date on the literature?
I mean,</v>

2093
02:12:50.551 --> 02:12:54.570
you know more about this topic than I do,
but that's one thing that,

2094
02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:59.310
uh,
I've seen some papers on but I didn't really expand on it.

2095
02:12:59.430 --> 02:13:02.820
But the,
I think reducing stress and quality of sleep,

2096
02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:07.740
quality of sleep is underrated for,
uh,

2097
02:13:08.610 --> 02:13:12.540
producing testosterone.
Uh,
so you need to do what you need to do.

2098
02:13:12.541 --> 02:13:15.490
So one of the things I recommend to you,
let's just sleep in a bat cave.

2099
02:13:15.491 --> 02:13:18.480
So the room you sleep in should be as dark as possible.

2100
02:13:18.780 --> 02:13:21.540
It's one of the things I talk a lot about seminars I can,

2101
02:13:21.541 --> 02:13:23.220
not powerful executive seminar.

2102
02:13:23.610 --> 02:13:26.430
One of the topics is the importance of sleep on regeneration,

2103
02:13:26.431 --> 02:13:29.810
but I think it's the most underrated one.
Uh,

2104
02:13:29.970 --> 02:13:34.450
it's not a question I can answer in five minutes,
but sleep neat,

2105
02:13:35.610 --> 02:13:36.150
uh,

2106
02:13:36.150 --> 02:13:41.150
called bat and decreasing stress or the four for most bang for your buck

2107
02:13:44.190 --> 02:13:46.930
<v 6>and,
and feeling all that.
A new sexual partner,
it sounds like.</v>

2108
02:13:47.240 --> 02:13:51.860
<v 5>That's right.
That's right.
Because the,
the,
the thing is,
is that,
you know,</v>

2109
02:13:52.770 --> 02:13:53.930
this is a reality.

2110
02:13:55.030 --> 02:13:59.420
What is animal or a human evidence.

2111
02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:04.070
The
changing sexual partners increases testosterone.

2112
02:14:04.100 --> 02:14:07.660
But you may not,
you know,
it's not for everybody,
but the point is,

2113
02:14:07.661 --> 02:14:11.330
is that yes,
that question,
I'll answer it truthfully.

2114
02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:17.370
<v 6>So this question,
I get asked a lot of caveats to this question,</v>

2115
02:14:17.371 --> 02:14:20.680
but this is John's question and I think it's a very common one.
Um,

2116
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:24.570
what supplements should everyone take?
A weather,
men,

2117
02:14:24.571 --> 02:14:27.780
women or all people in a,
in a broad age range?

2118
02:14:28.230 --> 02:14:30.990
<v 5>I think the most underrated supplement,</v>

2119
02:14:32.460 --> 02:14:36.330
if you have a perfect diet,
which is rare is magnesium.

2120
02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:38.650
Even when it perfect that we can get enough and we need,

2121
02:14:39.510 --> 02:14:40.680
I don't care what you say,

2122
02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:45.420
measured people's red blood cell magnesium for years.

2123
02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:50.220
If there's one thing that consistently see low is that one.

2124
02:14:50.250 --> 02:14:52.230
And when you consistently improve it,

2125
02:14:52.260 --> 02:14:55.710
you see changes all across blood work.
Right?

2126
02:14:56.280 --> 02:15:01.260
So how much magnesium,
I think males should take four grams a day.
Females 2.4.

2127
02:15:01.890 --> 02:15:06.600
Uh,
the second one type of magnesium,
sorry to interrupt.

2128
02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:08.671
Any museum.

2129
02:15:08.671 --> 02:15:13.671
I think the best magnesium out there is magnesium threonate if I were to pick

2130
02:15:14.131 --> 02:15:17.130
one,
but I preferred the different key leads.

2131
02:15:17.490 --> 02:15:20.070
So I use glycinate,
they use orotate.

2132
02:15:20.310 --> 02:15:23.820
If you look at the physiology behind it and there's lot of good research,

2133
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:24.660
that's easy.

2134
02:15:24.660 --> 02:15:29.190
Fine is that every form of magnesium tends to go to a specific tissue.

2135
02:15:29.490 --> 02:15:30.211
So for example,

2136
02:15:30.211 --> 02:15:34.740
magnesium glycinate as a profound preference for liver and muscle tissue.

2137
02:15:35.100 --> 02:15:38.010
Magnesium orotate tends to work more in the vascular system.

2138
02:15:38.250 --> 02:15:40.830
Magnesium through an eight is more of a Gab when inducer,

2139
02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:42.330
therefore it improves sleep.

2140
02:15:42.690 --> 02:15:47.690
So personally I take two grams and they need him through and eight of the last

2141
02:15:48.181 --> 02:15:53.010
meal before going to bed.
And I use various forms of key lates,
uh,

2142
02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:57.070
like magnesium,
[inaudible] phosphate from Gaba Mag.
I used that,

2143
02:15:57.120 --> 02:16:01.860
that I use a man using lysinate glycinates.
Uh,
I use,

2144
02:16:02.660 --> 02:16:06.360
and it's good to vary to forums because as the research shows it tends to go to

2145
02:16:06.361 --> 02:16:07.830
different tissues.
Got It.

2146
02:16:08.250 --> 02:16:12.780
The second most important supplement in my opinion for the average person would

2147
02:16:12.781 --> 02:16:17.160
be a good,
uh,
official and it should very official.

2148
02:16:17.161 --> 02:16:20.870
But when they are fish oil,
I prefer to brands like the,
Oh my God,

2149
02:16:20.910 --> 02:16:25.290
veil from designs for l,
which as you say the name one more time please.

2150
02:16:25.610 --> 02:16:30.250
Omega a veil.
So veil from a designs frill.

2151
02:16:30.550 --> 02:16:34.510
So where do you yeah.
Added d three k one and K two.

2152
02:16:34.810 --> 02:16:36.790
When you add the three k one k two,

2153
02:16:37.150 --> 02:16:42.150
the cardiovascular benefits of the official go exponential.

2154
02:16:42.940 --> 02:16:47.080
Uh,
number three,
it depends on where you live around the world,

2155
02:16:47.081 --> 02:16:50.260
but you certainly live in the UK,
Ireland or Australia.

2156
02:16:50.740 --> 02:16:53.830
You are zinc deficient.
So again,

2157
02:16:53.831 --> 02:16:58.180
I prefer to use multiple forms of zinc t lates,
like lysinate,

2158
02:16:59.380 --> 02:17:01.520
Orotate,
blah,
blah,
Blah and uh,

2159
02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:06.540
so broadbased zinc and take that in testosterone levels.

2160
02:17:08.410 --> 02:17:12.550
Zinc is under estimated.
Uh,

2161
02:17:13.330 --> 02:17:17.500
you will find,
for example,
when I worked a lot with hockey players,
uh,

2162
02:17:17.530 --> 02:17:20.230
guys were trying to add,
let's say by the time they came to see me,

2163
02:17:20.231 --> 02:17:23.500
they usually were in their thirties.
They have usually two kids,

2164
02:17:23.501 --> 02:17:28.501
but they're always trying for third or fourth child and they became fertile

2165
02:17:28.540 --> 02:17:33.210
after about four months of,
uh,
uh,
sorry,

2166
02:17:33.490 --> 02:17:34.323
zinc use.

2167
02:17:34.450 --> 02:17:38.560
So fertility is id associated with the zinc status.

2168
02:17:38.980 --> 02:17:40.630
But if you look at the research,

2169
02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:45.820
the sync status is one of the best predictors of quote unquote maleness.

2170
02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:49.270
So the more androgenic you want to be,
the more synchrony,

2171
02:17:49.660 --> 02:17:54.580
but to detoxify foreign estrogens,
the enzymes to do that.
Also in based,

2172
02:17:54.610 --> 02:17:56.710
so it works in multiple patents.

2173
02:17:57.430 --> 02:18:02.200
Zinc is known as a great organizer and human tissues.
So you,

2174
02:18:02.710 --> 02:18:06.820
you can't organize chemistry properly if you don't have enough sink.

2175
02:18:07.230 --> 02:18:09.050
<v 6>Uh,
what,
what type of</v>

2176
02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:12.380
dosages do you typically recommend?

2177
02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:14.690
<v 5>First Time clients,</v>

2178
02:18:15.050 --> 02:18:19.370
you'll be surprised that you use about 180 milligrams a day for about six
months.

2179
02:18:19.820 --> 02:18:22.770
And if you ask Mark Houston or Esther bloom,

2180
02:18:22.771 --> 02:18:25.250
anybody you this clinical nutrition on a regular basis,

2181
02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:29.750
they will agree with that value because a 30 mil.
And the thing is,

2182
02:18:29.751 --> 02:18:31.830
is that in the early,
late 70,

2183
02:18:31.831 --> 02:18:35.360
[inaudible] you could change a guy's to Starstone fairly rapidly.

2184
02:18:35.361 --> 02:18:39.320
We'd only 30 milligrams of supplements a day,
but I don't see that anymore.

2185
02:18:39.350 --> 02:18:43.070
That doses,
you need that about six times greater in the last 30 years.

2186
02:18:43.250 --> 02:18:47.690
Is that just due to ground soil depletion or what is the cause?
Multiple factors?

2187
02:18:47.691 --> 02:18:51.230
I think there's a ground depletion,
uh,

2188
02:18:51.260 --> 02:18:53.150
the type of fertilizers we use,

2189
02:18:53.330 --> 02:18:58.330
but also the stress of the toxic load from the environment.

2190
02:18:58.821 --> 02:18:59.960
So if you're,

2191
02:18:59.961 --> 02:19:03.890
let's say putting a shampoo that has a lot of estrogenic properties,

2192
02:19:04.190 --> 02:19:09.190
you'll need to justify those molecules and those molecules in the pathic dots

2193
02:19:09.500 --> 02:19:14.500
detoxification process always almost always use sync as one of the core factors

2194
02:19:14.781 --> 02:19:17.100
to detoxify those estrogens.

2195
02:19:18.060 --> 02:19:21.360
<v 6>That makes perfect sense.
Alright.
Uh,</v>

2196
02:19:21.510 --> 02:19:23.790
let's shift gears just a little bit.

2197
02:19:23.820 --> 02:19:27.110
Have a couple more questions and then,
and um,

2198
02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:29.720
love to hear,
of course,

2199
02:19:29.721 --> 02:19:32.780
where everyone can find more information on everything you're up to.

2200
02:19:33.230 --> 02:19:36.860
What before we get to that,
when you think of the word successful,

2201
02:19:36.890 --> 02:19:38.660
who is the first person who comes to mind?

2202
02:19:39.510 --> 02:19:42.690
<v 5>Actually,
Winston Churchill.
Why is that</v>

2203
02:19:44.700 --> 02:19:48.840
this guy add balls.
I mean,
you stood up to Hitler,

2204
02:19:49.230 --> 02:19:52.530
you rally
the United Kingdom,

2205
02:19:53.190 --> 02:19:55.050
you refuse to surrender.

2206
02:19:56.590 --> 02:20:01.200
You said Nobel price winner in literature or few people know that,
um,

2207
02:20:02.730 --> 02:20:06.080
was named Britain most,
uh,

2208
02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:10.850
valuable Britain 2002 in east,
uh,

2209
02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:16.080
contributed to the feet of the Nazi empire.
Um,
I think that,

2210
02:20:16.081 --> 02:20:20.140
uh,
his attitude and his,
um,

2211
02:20:21.030 --> 02:20:25.430
he applied a lot of the success principles to like napping and so on.
And He,

2212
02:20:26.010 --> 02:20:26.843
uh,

2213
02:20:27.720 --> 02:20:31.920
he predicted a lot of things that the Americans did not listen to.
For example,

2214
02:20:31.921 --> 02:20:33.420
that you predicted the iron curtain.

2215
02:20:33.810 --> 02:20:38.810
He told the Roosevelt that you was getting screwed at the alto by Stalin

2216
02:20:41.010 --> 02:20:43.140
Roosevelt.
See the way too many things to the Russians.

2217
02:20:43.500 --> 02:20:47.670
And we've had many problems since then,
but he was a visionary.

2218
02:20:48.150 --> 02:20:49.640
Uh,
and he was,

2219
02:20:49.740 --> 02:20:54.740
he took a lot of decisions that were unpopular at the time because they required

2220
02:20:54.931 --> 02:20:59.931
balls and you was later found three streets to have been right in the first

2221
02:21:00.241 --> 02:21:04.620
place.
So,
uh,
I think that if you want to study success,

2222
02:21:04.950 --> 02:21:07.260
you should study,
uh,
Churchill.

2223
02:21:08.440 --> 02:21:09.720
<v 6>Yeah.
Churchill is a fascinating,</v>

2224
02:21:09.750 --> 02:21:13.540
fascinating character and also a great example of,
um,

2225
02:21:14.280 --> 02:21:16.950
how,
how incredible,

2226
02:21:16.980 --> 02:21:20.680
how incredibly productive you can be with some,
um,

2227
02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:25.230
very widely perceived weaknesses as well.
I mean,
just a,
I mean,

2228
02:21:25.231 --> 02:21:28.580
definitely a whole character and,
uh,

2229
02:21:28.581 --> 02:21:33.510
I think a good exemplar of how to focus on your strengths.
Exactly.
Uh,

2230
02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:36.810
what is your favorite documentary or movie?

2231
02:21:37.320 --> 02:21:41.070
<v 5>You know,
what,
as far as your movies,
I think that have laser like focus all day.</v>

2232
02:21:41.610 --> 02:21:42.421
So for me,

2233
02:21:42.421 --> 02:21:47.070
a good movie involves 60 people getting killed and Bruce and way in the first 30

2234
02:21:47.071 --> 02:21:50.550
minutes.
And like I said,
some of the John Wick,

2235
02:21:50.940 --> 02:21:55.650
I mean I watch movies to distract me.
So if you ask me movies,

2236
02:21:55.651 --> 02:21:59.730
I like it like last time where I like gladiator,
I like movies,

2237
02:22:00.310 --> 02:22:04.830
he arrests a struggle,
uh,
and overcome difficulty.

2238
02:22:05.130 --> 02:22:09.480
But you know,
is a movie called the imitation game,

2239
02:22:09.510 --> 02:22:13.080
which has none of these descriptions and I really liked it.

2240
02:22:13.570 --> 02:22:14.880
I'm a big movie buff,

2241
02:22:14.910 --> 02:22:19.910
but for me movies is to take my mind away from what I do every day.

2242
02:22:20.610 --> 02:22:25.110
Uh,
you know,
obviously I run high in dopamine and that's still calling.

2243
02:22:25.380 --> 02:22:26.213
So

2244
02:22:26.220 --> 02:22:30.840
<v 4>action movies are a far better choice for me then sleepless in Seattle.</v>

2245
02:22:32.780 --> 02:22:37.410
But
you know,
the thing I really like,

2246
02:22:37.411 --> 02:22:40.530
national geographic,
the documentaries.
Do you have,

2247
02:22:40.531 --> 02:22:44.190
I really like learning about animal life.

2248
02:22:45.120 --> 02:22:48.170
My daughter and I share that stuff.
Um,

2249
02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:51.900
I read like to learn about ecosystems,

2250
02:22:52.470 --> 02:22:54.880
so those shy,
you know,

2251
02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:59.250
I like the history channel and not a big movie TV watcher.

2252
02:22:59.700 --> 02:23:04.230
If I'm going to watch something,
it's usually a movie.
Did a dye rent.
Uh,

2253
02:23:04.260 --> 02:23:08.250
when I'm overseas and I'm sick and tired of teaching Ela,

2254
02:23:08.251 --> 02:23:11.010
go watch a movie to take my mind off.
I find it's a good,

2255
02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:16.860
I like Quentin Tarantino movies.
I mean,
I like,
I like usually action based stuff.

2256
02:23:17.160 --> 02:23:20.460
<v 1>There's,
um,
I've,
I've a movie recommendation that you might enjoy.</v>

2257
02:23:20.461 --> 02:23:24.030
There's a movie called,
and I'm going to butcher this,
but,
uh,
when profit,

2258
02:23:24.120 --> 02:23:29.120
so a profit about this young Middle Eastern kid who gets thrown into a French

2259
02:23:30.301 --> 02:23:35.190
prison and gets adopted by the core skin mafia and it tracks his growth from the

2260
02:23:35.191 --> 02:23:38.150
lowest on the totem pole to the highest and the totem pole are,

2261
02:23:38.220 --> 02:23:42.960
it's an amazing action movie.
Yeah.
And really,
really good.
You see at 22 bullets?

2262
02:23:43.380 --> 02:23:45.180
No,
I haven't seen 22 bullets.

2263
02:23:45.500 --> 02:23:47.650
<v 4>That's a native French movie with Charles.
I know,</v>

2264
02:23:48.200 --> 02:23:53.200
which is a great movie about a guy that tries to retire from the math yet and

2265
02:23:54.351 --> 02:23:57.280
they don't let them.
It's like,
actually,
that's a great one.

2266
02:23:57.430 --> 02:23:59.880
<v 1>22 bullets.
I'll check it out.
Uh,</v>

2267
02:24:00.190 --> 02:24:02.980
in the last say six to 12 months,

2268
02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:08.410
what $100 or less purchase has most positively impacted your life?

2269
02:24:09.300 --> 02:24:11.460
<v 4>Actually it was a gift,</v>

2270
02:24:11.580 --> 02:24:13.950
so I'm not sure what the price was when it can't be that hot.

2271
02:24:14.220 --> 02:24:18.600
It's called the bamboo bench.
I featured it on my website.
All it is,

2272
02:24:18.660 --> 02:24:22.770
it's a sliced foam roller incented,

2273
02:24:22.810 --> 02:24:27.810
a leather condom with Velcro straps and you put it over a regular bench and it

2274
02:24:29.071 --> 02:24:32.340
has this half moon shape where your spine rests.

2275
02:24:32.700 --> 02:24:37.290
So when you do pressing movements,
you can drop the elbows much further,

2276
02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:42.380
uh,
than the wood irregular bench.
So it allows for more free Kepler,

2277
02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:46.350
uh,
movement and it's uh,

2278
02:24:46.890 --> 02:24:48.870
allows for a greater range of motion when you lift,

2279
02:24:49.290 --> 02:24:52.030
but it allows you for pain free,
uh,

2280
02:24:52.031 --> 02:24:56.490
providing present ha and it's called the bamboo bench.
Yeah.
All it is,

2281
02:24:56.491 --> 02:25:01.491
it's like a condom that you put on a bench that as a half moon,

2282
02:25:02.340 --> 02:25:07.320
um,
as a spine roller inside of it.
And it,

2283
02:25:07.770 --> 02:25:12.770
if you go to my website and you search under Babin bench is a video that I shot

2284
02:25:12.811 --> 02:25:16.260
and strict guard explaining how to use it.
But for,
you know,

2285
02:25:16.261 --> 02:25:20.520
for what it costs over which you have to invest,
it's a great,
uh,

2286
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:24.160
investment on the health and of your shoulders.

2287
02:25:24.990 --> 02:25:28.830
<v 6>Very cool.
That sounds like my next purchase.</v>

2288
02:25:29.670 --> 02:25:34.440
The w what does,
uh,
what does the first 60 to 90 minutes of your day look like?

2289
02:25:34.860 --> 02:25:39.420
People are fascinated by morning rituals.
So just in your ideal sort of,

2290
02:25:39.570 --> 02:25:41.880
let's just say it's a work day.
What is your,

2291
02:25:42.180 --> 02:25:45.060
what is your ideal 60 to 90 minutes look like?

2292
02:25:45.570 --> 02:25:48.690
It depends if I'm on the road or not,
but let's say are not on the road.

2293
02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.970
<v 5>Okay.
Like today.
So I wake up early,
I tend to wake up at four.</v>

2294
02:25:53.430 --> 02:25:56.310
<v 3>Why do I wake up at four?
Well,
nobody's going to bother me.</v>

2295
02:25:56.790 --> 02:26:01.320
So I get two hours to myself.
So if that week had my daughter,

2296
02:26:01.321 --> 02:26:04.380
I can do whatever I want to do for two hours before I wake her up,

2297
02:26:04.620 --> 02:26:07.320
make her breakfast and drive to school.
So,

2298
02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:11.340
and we come up with a ravishing appetite.

2299
02:26:11.430 --> 02:26:16.200
So everyday I start when I'm at home with some type of wild meat,

2300
02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:21.390
some type of nuts and sometimes berries or Avocados.

2301
02:26:21.930 --> 02:26:24.150
So,
uh,
I eat that.

2302
02:26:24.210 --> 02:26:29.160
Then I make coffee and I'm quite a fanatical about the way me coffee.

2303
02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:33.270
Uh,
how to make your coffee.
Well,
for example,
the wall,

2304
02:26:33.300 --> 02:26:35.220
they're asked to be near freezing point.

2305
02:26:35.790 --> 02:26:40.440
The reason why I do that is that it takes longer to warm up the water because it

2306
02:26:40.441 --> 02:26:42.210
takes longer to warm up.

2307
02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:45.360
Then there's more time for the steam to diffuse through the coffee beans.

2308
02:26:45.690 --> 02:26:50.640
Therefore the coffee has more caffeine,
more uh,
of all the antioxidants.

2309
02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:54.990
When you drink that coffee,
if I make you a cup of coffee,
Tim,
today,

2310
02:26:55.380 --> 02:26:57.930
you may fall asleep Valentine's Day.

2311
02:27:00.630 --> 02:27:02.720
<v 5>So people who've been in my house and drink great coffee,</v>

2312
02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:07.010
these start to having convulsions and their faces after two sips.

2313
02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:09.590
But I really like very cold coffee out.

2314
02:27:09.980 --> 02:27:14.690
And one thing that is high in pesticides is actually a coffee.

2315
02:27:14.691 --> 02:27:16.670
It's one more spray plants on the planet.

2316
02:27:16.970 --> 02:27:20.210
So I get my beans either from the Dominican Republic.

2317
02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:23.090
I've got a client who owns their own plantation.

2318
02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:26.930
And when I go to the drs stock up or,
uh,

2319
02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:28.610
one of my assistant teachers,

2320
02:27:28.611 --> 02:27:33.500
Carlos Castro is from the Columbia and he brings me in,
uh,

2321
02:27:33.530 --> 02:27:38.530
organic coffee from Colombia or I buy the one from Kona Island in Hawaii.

2322
02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:43.340
So I really like the coffee beans,
uh,
to be,
uh,
of choice.

2323
02:27:43.880 --> 02:27:48.410
So I drink coffee and then typically just black or how do you take your coffee?

2324
02:27:48.710 --> 02:27:49.580
Like my soul.

2325
02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:52.533
<v 6>Okay.</v>

2326
02:27:53.050 --> 02:27:54.520
<v 5>Sometimes I put a,</v>

2327
02:27:54.610 --> 02:27:58.970
actually coconut oil in it if I need to get a bit more wired.
Uh,

2328
02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:03.490
sometimes they use very,
very heavy cream,
like about three,

2329
02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:05.350
5%.
Uh,

2330
02:28:05.380 --> 02:28:09.370
it's funny because I was in London at the Marriott and there's a polish waiter

2331
02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:12.880
and this for coffee and the guy comes in,
we'd already,

2332
02:28:13.270 --> 02:28:16.480
what the British called devil cream in it.
And they go,
Oh,
you know,

2333
02:28:16.481 --> 02:28:19.300
I like my coffee like that.
It just says I read your post every day.

2334
02:28:21.370 --> 02:28:22.203
But

2335
02:28:23.020 --> 02:28:26.450
<v 3>sometimes they scream,
but probably 70% of the time I drink it black,</v>

2336
02:28:26.451 --> 02:28:29.930
like my soul.
But the,
um,
and then I read,

2337
02:28:30.410 --> 02:28:35.410
I like to read one hour on a non specific to my job stuff.

2338
02:28:37.760 --> 02:28:38.341
So I may read,

2339
02:28:38.341 --> 02:28:43.341
let's say a biography on Churchill or a May read a book like a 59 seconds.

2340
02:28:45.130 --> 02:28:49.700
They're more what you would call self improvement books.
I read recently a book,

2341
02:28:50.090 --> 02:28:54.530
I probably read a book a day.
So I read,
I'm a very good speed reader.

2342
02:28:54.531 --> 02:28:59.531
So I read a book on resilience or this morning at breakfast as reading a fringe

2343
02:29:00.891 --> 02:29:03.020
book on German grammar because

2344
02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:07.820
it sounds like a page Turner.
And I was in,

2345
02:29:08.480 --> 02:29:12.140
in Germany last month and I realized I had lost a lot of my German.

2346
02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:15.890
So I said,
okay,
I've got to catch up my German.

2347
02:29:16.610 --> 02:29:21.610
Or sometimes what I do is I'll type in sentences on being translate and I look

2348
02:29:21.741 --> 02:29:23.550
at the German equivalent or the Swedish agreement,

2349
02:29:23.580 --> 02:29:24.710
whatever language you want to learn,

2350
02:29:25.190 --> 02:29:29.420
just the sentences I use all the time in my practice.

2351
02:29:29.840 --> 02:29:33.080
So like keep your back straight Galore and a squad,
blah,
blah,
blah.
You know?

2352
02:29:33.150 --> 02:29:38.060
So I do that.
And then,
yeah,
did not page turners,
but it's stuff I like to read.

2353
02:29:38.061 --> 02:29:42.200
Or even when I'm overseas,
I buy classic comic books,

2354
02:29:42.201 --> 02:29:46.850
like Asterix in let's say in Swedish or looky,
looky in Swedish or whatever.

2355
02:29:47.150 --> 02:29:51.650
And I read those because it's a fun way to learn a foreign language.

2356
02:29:51.651 --> 02:29:54.890
We felt we stressing myself.

2357
02:29:55.080 --> 02:29:58.740
That's exactly the same thing that I do also by bay because it's also,

2358
02:29:58.741 --> 02:30:03.230
I'm heavy on dialogue.
So yes,
so you get conversation.
I know,

2359
02:30:03.231 --> 02:30:05.510
not to say you're under arrest and 76 languages,

2360
02:30:07.540 --> 02:30:10.190
but the thing is is that,
uh,

2361
02:30:10.520 --> 02:30:15.350
and then after that it'd be ever one hour specific to my job.

2362
02:30:15.560 --> 02:30:19.310
So,
and I like to read a lot of my colleagues stuff.

2363
02:30:19.610 --> 02:30:21.820
So one guy I really like is Josh Brian.

2364
02:30:21.880 --> 02:30:24.410
So you just wrote a really good book on interval training.

2365
02:30:24.920 --> 02:30:27.360
So that's what I'm going to read tomorrow.
Um,

2366
02:30:27.740 --> 02:30:32.740
and then I don't read much on the Internet because I find there's too much

2367
02:30:33.801 --> 02:30:36.920
bullshit.
So,
uh,
a,
um,

2368
02:30:39.050 --> 02:30:42.680
I use a kindle a lot because it allows me to flip the pages faster.

2369
02:30:43.160 --> 02:30:46.370
And what I like about the kindle is it can actually,

2370
02:30:47.030 --> 02:30:49.670
I liked what I find interesting.

2371
02:30:50.390 --> 02:30:55.010
And then at the end of my reading I reread what I had highlighted,

2372
02:30:55.011 --> 02:30:59.720
which increases the retention by under 70%.
So,
uh,

2373
02:30:59.960 --> 02:31:04.910
and then on Sundays I tend to reread the highlights of all the books I read.

2374
02:31:05.300 --> 02:31:07.700
So that goes up to 95%.

2375
02:31:07.701 --> 02:31:10.370
People always wonder how come I got a good memory and there's some tricks to it.

2376
02:31:11.060 --> 02:31:15.230
So repetition is important.
And then,
um,
after that,

2377
02:31:15.500 --> 02:31:20.010
then I started my day at work.
So I'll write,
I'll true whenever I

2378
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:23.010
<v 4>need to on the road.
Oh.
I usually,</v>

2379
02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:25.080
if I drove my daughter as soon as they get back,
I trained,

2380
02:31:25.920 --> 02:31:30.420
I've got a very good gym in my house.
Um,
if I'm on the road,

2381
02:31:30.780 --> 02:31:35.310
I wake up,
eat breakfast,
I do some reading.

2382
02:31:35.370 --> 02:31:37.170
It depends on the distance of the gym.

2383
02:31:37.230 --> 02:31:40.860
What is your go to breakfast at home?

2384
02:31:42.090 --> 02:31:45.630
It's always a wild meat always.
How do you prepare that?
Typically,

2385
02:31:46.120 --> 02:31:50.150
I typically a frightened Goldwater got it at,

2386
02:31:50.490 --> 02:31:53.550
so it could be,
so this morning was chicken breasts,

2387
02:31:53.580 --> 02:31:58.580
but I rarely eat a chicken for breakfast,

2388
02:31:59.190 --> 02:32:00.060
always a red meat.

2389
02:32:00.150 --> 02:32:03.840
But I joined some different today and then I always have and that,

2390
02:32:04.550 --> 02:32:08.160
uh,
what it's wellness,
I read like naked aimia notes with our very that,

2391
02:32:08.161 --> 02:32:10.590
so I don't give up intolerances.

2392
02:32:10.830 --> 02:32:14.820
Nn in Colorado you can get very good berries year round.

2393
02:32:14.821 --> 02:32:19.060
So eat sometimes berries or eat avocados.
Um,

2394
02:32:19.200 --> 02:32:22.290
and then like I said,
the coffee on the road,

2395
02:32:22.350 --> 02:32:26.550
it's one of the reasons why I stayed at Marriott worldwide.

2396
02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:30.770
Is this the only place I'll serve steak and eggs.
So it,

2397
02:32:32.330 --> 02:32:36.750
you know,
it's really hot when he asked for staking.
Like in Italy,

2398
02:32:36.780 --> 02:32:39.930
he might as well ask the question when the aquarium on top of your head,

2399
02:32:40.200 --> 02:32:45.090
they're like,
well,
stage,
you know,
you eat for breakfast.
So,
uh,

2400
02:32:45.150 --> 02:32:48.880
in Sweden,
the,
these,
uh,

2401
02:32:49.110 --> 02:32:53.580
ethnic shrimp that I like it,
they're very small shrimp,

2402
02:32:53.960 --> 02:32:56.970
so I'll buy it out of the supermarket,
keep it in my minibar.

2403
02:32:57.540 --> 02:33:00.300
So in morning I may have shrimp and cashews for breakfast.

2404
02:33:00.510 --> 02:33:05.070
So one thing that I don't negotiate on ever is breakfast.

2405
02:33:05.160 --> 02:33:07.260
I'm a maniac about breakfast.

2406
02:33:07.650 --> 02:33:11.550
I don't want to quash our back in prison.

2407
02:33:11.551 --> 02:33:14.070
Eggs as my friends would call him for breakfast.

2408
02:33:14.160 --> 02:33:18.630
And the salmon is always farmed salmon.
It tastes disgusting.

2409
02:33:19.050 --> 02:33:20.490
So,
uh,

2410
02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:25.290
in Manchester there was no way I could get steak and eggs for breakfast.

2411
02:33:25.680 --> 02:33:28.950
So my sister and I,
we bought sardines,
so,

2412
02:33:29.010 --> 02:33:32.160
and sardines and Brazil nuts for breakfast the next day.

2413
02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:36.770
So I don't negotiate on that.
For me,

2414
02:33:36.980 --> 02:33:41.880
I eat meat,
fish or seafood and some nuts that I find.

2415
02:33:42.120 --> 02:33:45.690
For me it's been one of the secrets to my success because when you teach,

2416
02:33:45.691 --> 02:33:48.710
you got to pay attention.
You got to remember what you got to say,

2417
02:33:48.711 --> 02:33:52.830
you gotta be enthusiastic.
And if I were to eat with hotels,

2418
02:33:52.860 --> 02:33:56.760
typically give a,
and we'll do so well.
Even when I fly,

2419
02:33:57.300 --> 02:33:57.980
if I go to Europe,

2420
02:33:57.980 --> 02:34:02.980
I only fly a Swiss air or a f bounce because if Atlanta Alexander connection and

2421
02:34:06.331 --> 02:34:09.570
Air France has the best Biss Mr First Class Lounge in the world,

2422
02:34:10.020 --> 02:34:14.910
second is a Swiss air.
And when I fly west,
if I go to Australia,

2423
02:34:15.420 --> 02:34:20.230
I always fly with 'em
air New Zealand because again,

2424
02:34:20.231 --> 02:34:23.950
the quality of the lounge is important to me.
Yeah.
For the food,

2425
02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:28.960
for the food and you know,
can you take a shower,
you know,

2426
02:34:29.380 --> 02:34:34.030
American based,
uh,
airlines are useless.

2427
02:34:34.090 --> 02:34:37.090
United Delta American fuck,

2428
02:34:37.660 --> 02:34:40.800
you may fly with Air Buzz Atlanta,
you probably get better

2429
02:34:42.850 --> 02:34:45.770
service.
And you know,

2430
02:34:45.790 --> 02:34:50.790
I find with these airlines I named it the actually believe in quality service,

2431
02:34:51.190 --> 02:34:55.600
you know,
and uh,
for several efficate Air France is great.

2432
02:34:55.601 --> 02:35:00.010
Like cattle ended from Dusseldorf in Paris.
Somebody was there to pick me up,

2433
02:35:00.070 --> 02:35:03.020
but my name drove me to the first class lounge.
I didn't have to clear customs.

2434
02:35:03.100 --> 02:35:05.200
They take your passport for you,
they go do it for you.

2435
02:35:05.550 --> 02:35:08.170
The loose dancer does the same thing.
So the Swiss air,

2436
02:35:08.650 --> 02:35:12.850
and I don't know if people say,
well you waste money traveling first class.

2437
02:35:13.390 --> 02:35:17.710
I don't believe that because I give them much better seminar,
fly first class.

2438
02:35:17.711 --> 02:35:22.260
And if a fly economy I can,
you know,
one of my unique abilities is it,

2439
02:35:22.420 --> 02:35:26.560
I can fall asleep.
And the shooting yard.
I can sleep anywhere,
anytime,

2440
02:35:26.890 --> 02:35:31.150
but I need to sleep when I fly over.
And when you fly first class,

2441
02:35:31.151 --> 02:35:36.100
you're guaranteed quality sleep because there's no one year old kid crying,

2442
02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:37.750
you know,
uh,

2443
02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:42.840
some guy opening up this Tupperware with I can microwave and Broccoli so he can

2444
02:35:44.921 --> 02:35:48.340
say I'm a snob.
Yes I am.
But I haven't over the years,

2445
02:35:48.341 --> 02:35:52.660
even as early as 1982,
one when I was paying for my own flights,

2446
02:35:52.690 --> 02:35:57.580
I've always flown business or first because the quality of your teaching will

2447
02:35:57.760 --> 02:35:59.890
dictate your success of the quality of your coaching.

2448
02:36:00.190 --> 02:36:03.190
Will they take their success and that will pay,

2449
02:36:03.191 --> 02:36:06.130
weighed enough your first class tickets.

2450
02:36:07.120 --> 02:36:10.810
I've had discussions with people about that,
but I still believe,

2451
02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:15.730
and also it's a mindset.
You know,
you want a first class life fly first class.

2452
02:36:16.160 --> 02:36:16.920
Yeah.

2453
02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:20.700
<v 1>Yeah.
I've um,
I've found for myself,
you know,
it took me a long time.</v>

2454
02:36:21.180 --> 02:36:24.310
My family didn't grow up with a lot of money.
It took me a long time to,

2455
02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:28.050
to make the transition from economy to business.

2456
02:36:28.051 --> 02:36:33.051
And the only reason that I made that jump was because I tried to save money on

2457
02:36:33.601 --> 02:36:37.290
an international flight specifically and had to do a speaking engagement than s

2458
02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:41.710
next day.
And it was a disaster because I couldn't sleep.
And it was,
uh,
it,

2459
02:36:41.720 --> 02:36:45.510
it all came down to preserving the ability to sleep if there's some type of,

2460
02:36:45.930 --> 02:36:48.680
of business engagement on the other end.
Um,

2461
02:36:49.260 --> 02:36:51.270
if you could have one bill

2462
02:36:51.340 --> 02:36:55.840
<v 4>board anywhere,
uh,
what would it say and where would it be</v>

2463
02:36:57.550 --> 02:37:02.410
addressing question probably you would say know yourself,

2464
02:37:05.270 --> 02:37:08.730
where would you put it in Times Square?
It was great.

2465
02:37:10.440 --> 02:37:14.890
I spoke probably about Malaysian density because the,

2466
02:37:15.800 --> 02:37:20.800
I look at my industry but I think shooting lessons,

2467
02:37:21.981 --> 02:37:23.540
right?
I love to shoot.

2468
02:37:23.630 --> 02:37:27.460
I think it's a great relaxation exercise acid and,

2469
02:37:27.660 --> 02:37:31.820
and my shooting instructor follows a lot of strength industry

2470
02:37:33.590 --> 02:37:38.060
and he said they had the same issues in the shooting industry with people

2471
02:37:38.061 --> 02:37:41.720
wanting the attention of the consumer.
Right.

2472
02:37:42.140 --> 02:37:46.700
And I think that,
uh,
the,

2473
02:37:46.820 --> 02:37:47.840
the key to,

2474
02:37:48.320 --> 02:37:53.300
to success in anything is know yourself first and then,

2475
02:37:53.840 --> 02:37:55.960
you know,
call,
cough.

2476
02:37:56.460 --> 02:38:01.430
He was telling students that there's one thing that he keeps constant is,

2477
02:38:01.431 --> 02:38:05.210
is with a thin prep.
He's learned over the years not to mess with that,

2478
02:38:05.570 --> 02:38:10.040
but he says the other,
uh,
45 weeks or so,
left out of the year,

2479
02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:15.110
Egos on a day to day basis.
And he says,
he says,

2480
02:38:15.620 --> 02:38:19.790
brining is like food.
Sometimes you eat more,

2481
02:38:19.850 --> 02:38:24.400
sometimes you eat less,
you have to eat when you're hungry.

2482
02:38:24.870 --> 02:38:29.150
So,
you know,
if you look at it,
it's a very simplistic way to explain training,

2483
02:38:29.180 --> 02:38:31.710
but it's very true.
So,
you know,

2484
02:38:32.190 --> 02:38:36.220
he explains why you only squats twice a week.
A lot of guys in this field,

2485
02:38:36.221 --> 02:38:38.840
it was quite nine times a week.
But if you look at it as longevity,

2486
02:38:38.841 --> 02:38:43.760
it's really high remain fairly much injury free.

2487
02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:49.000
Um,
and the thing is is that,
you know,
for example,
Ed Kong,

2488
02:38:49.010 --> 02:38:51.680
he as a way to train is very different than would poke off with dude.

2489
02:38:52.100 --> 02:38:56.720
But I respect that a lot.
But I found over the years all these successful people

2490
02:38:58.220 --> 02:39:02.770
figured out what worked best for them.
And,
uh,

2491
02:39:03.090 --> 02:39:06.410
it's correct gas guys like me,
you know,

2492
02:39:06.500 --> 02:39:09.020
the so called Gurus or the census for advice.

2493
02:39:09.350 --> 02:39:11.570
But at the end of the day you have to make the decision.

2494
02:39:11.660 --> 02:39:15.800
I mean I can make you make a more enlightened decision because I made a lot of

2495
02:39:15.801 --> 02:39:19.910
mistakes.
I mean the only guy I know who's never,
never,

2496
02:39:19.911 --> 02:39:24.740
never made a mistake in his life pumps gas in a gas station in British Columbia

2497
02:39:25.130 --> 02:39:28.310
in Columbia,
you know,
he's my age and made a mistake.

2498
02:39:28.311 --> 02:39:29.600
You still makes eight bucks an hour.

2499
02:39:29.930 --> 02:39:33.570
So you learn by making mistakes and you know,
the,
the,

2500
02:39:33.610 --> 02:39:36.950
there's a saying good judgment comes from experience.

2501
02:39:36.951 --> 02:39:41.450
But experience comes from bad judgment.
So I tell on my seminars,

2502
02:39:41.540 --> 02:39:46.540
I often tell stories of our screwed up metal at the Olympics but didn't make the

2503
02:39:47.221 --> 02:39:50.300
same mistake twice.
And you know,

2504
02:39:50.301 --> 02:39:52.880
that's why like in speed skating it's probably the spoiler I'm most successful

2505
02:39:52.881 --> 02:39:54.770
in because in the early on,

2506
02:39:54.771 --> 02:39:58.460
I mean quite a few mistakes and I learned not to do them again.

2507
02:39:59.690 --> 02:40:03.650
What advice would you give to your 30 year old self

2508
02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:07.880
start working so much?

2509
02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:11.720
I used to work 20 hours a day,
Tim,

2510
02:40:12.380 --> 02:40:14.560
it's a lot of hours plus a week training.

2511
02:40:14.850 --> 02:40:18.510
So I thought that sleep was for wimps.

2512
02:40:20.490 --> 02:40:22.410
Well it's not true.
I mean

2513
02:40:24.210 --> 02:40:29.210
I think there's another book that I read in 91 which changed my outlook.

2514
02:40:29.540 --> 02:40:32.910
It was called life 101 and uh,

2515
02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:37.830
it depends.
It's an old books.
Sometimes you'll funders to authors.

2516
02:40:37.831 --> 02:40:38.820
Sometimes there's one author,

2517
02:40:39.270 --> 02:40:41.820
but he was actually only one real author to the book.

2518
02:40:41.910 --> 02:40:44.070
So eventually it was Peter McDonald.

2519
02:40:44.071 --> 02:40:49.071
But he taught me to distinguish the difference between a fantasy and a goal.

2520
02:40:51.450 --> 02:40:55.440
And I won't give you the,
the,
the punchline,

2521
02:40:55.470 --> 02:40:58.080
but it has to do a lot with,
uh,

2522
02:40:59.100 --> 02:41:01.740
you have to do the exercise in the book.
So in the book you'll say,

2523
02:41:02.100 --> 02:41:05.160
you'll give some theory.
You was always in a funny way.
Then he'll say,

2524
02:41:05.190 --> 02:41:08.160
you have 20 minutes,
yes or no.
If it's yes,
I'll do the exercise.

2525
02:41:08.161 --> 02:41:11.880
You don't have to,
don't keep on reading.
And the people will keep on reading,

2526
02:41:11.940 --> 02:41:15.900
never get the full essence of the book.
If he,
if he asks you,
you have 20 minutes,

2527
02:41:15.901 --> 02:41:17.400
yes or no,
you don't have 20 minutes,

2528
02:41:17.880 --> 02:41:20.700
but the book down next time you have 20 minutes to do the exercise.

2529
02:41:20.970 --> 02:41:25.260
But that was a life changing book for me.
And after that,

2530
02:41:25.650 --> 02:41:27.880
my uh,

2531
02:41:27.930 --> 02:41:32.910
success at the international international levels skyrocketed.
One,

2532
02:41:32.911 --> 02:41:37.410
I applied those principles.
But if I were to to think back on my life,

2533
02:41:38.580 --> 02:41:42.690
I should have had more fun and I should have work a lot less.

2534
02:41:42.750 --> 02:41:47.610
And then actually when I read your book,
I was already starting to evolve,

2535
02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:52.640
which more free time and better organization and you recommend to me in personal

2536
02:41:53.401 --> 02:41:56.260
conversation more books like the one by your friend Edward,

2537
02:41:56.280 --> 02:42:01.280
their Ooda or that it's about simplify your life.

2538
02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:04.230
I forget the,
the author.
Anyway,
I read him,

2539
02:42:04.500 --> 02:42:09.270
I decided to dive less goals and the more you evolve,
if against simplify,

2540
02:42:09.271 --> 02:42:13.710
simplify,
simplify,
simplify.
And um,
uh,

2541
02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:18.180
I tell that to some of my best students,
like say,
Hey,
go on vacation.

2542
02:42:18.780 --> 02:42:23.160
Uh,
it's not so hard with my non British,

2543
02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:26.280
non American students,
but Canadians,

2544
02:42:26.290 --> 02:42:30.390
Americans and British tend to weigh over work,
you know?

2545
02:42:31.130 --> 02:42:36.060
Yeah,
I agree.
It's,
I'm blacking it out ahead of time.
Really,

2546
02:42:36.061 --> 02:42:38.640
really,
really critical.
Putting those things on the calendar,

2547
02:42:38.710 --> 02:42:42.630
the calendar so that work doesn't swell to fill all of the voids.

2548
02:42:43.710 --> 02:42:46.560
Will Charles,
this is,
this is been a lot of fun.

2549
02:42:46.561 --> 02:42:50.430
I always love chatting and catching up.

2550
02:42:50.550 --> 02:42:55.550
Where can people find everything about you and what would you like them to check

2551
02:42:56.011 --> 02:42:59.910
out?
The best place to find my stuff.
Is that a strength?

2552
02:42:59.911 --> 02:43:02.260
sensei.com.
Uh,

2553
02:43:02.430 --> 02:43:06.600
and then if people want to attend seminars is an omelet call a calendar of

2554
02:43:06.601 --> 02:43:10.110
events as probably the most simplistic way to,

2555
02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:12.490
it's a world map and there's like arrows.

2556
02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:16.270
So if you don't want to Charles so much and let's say you live in Australia and

2557
02:43:16.271 --> 02:43:19.900
you see them coming to Perth and click the proof flagging and he'll tell you his

2558
02:43:19.901 --> 02:43:24.490
seminars.
They are,
but also these different ways to search.
If you based on topic,

2559
02:43:24.491 --> 02:43:27.660
what type of class you want.
And uh,

2560
02:43:27.790 --> 02:43:32.530
my next project is I'm working on a membership only site.

2561
02:43:32.740 --> 02:43:36.940
The reason is is because of social media.
People ask these questions.

2562
02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:42.040
I don't have any time on social media to explain them,
but an a membership site,

2563
02:43:42.041 --> 02:43:45.570
people will be able to say,
I'll say for example,
uh,
this month and we're,

2564
02:43:45.571 --> 02:43:48.700
we to really go into detail on choosing the right set,

2565
02:43:49.390 --> 02:43:52.670
choosing the right rep range.
Right.
And I'll talk to Richard,

2566
02:43:52.690 --> 02:43:53.620
that's the 90 minutes.

2567
02:43:53.621 --> 02:43:58.120
So people will be able to watch that and I'll give routines and recipes and tips

2568
02:43:58.810 --> 02:44:03.190
and anticipate it to be a very successful site,
uh,

2569
02:44:03.220 --> 02:44:07.210
because there's a demand for it and people are willing to pay a nominal fee,

2570
02:44:07.211 --> 02:44:12.211
which is less than 20 bucks a month to get top level information because you

2571
02:44:12.371 --> 02:44:16.180
know,
Facebook is nice.
I leave tips there and I leave links to my website,

2572
02:44:16.181 --> 02:44:18.400
but it never allows for,

2573
02:44:19.420 --> 02:44:23.260
and I got this advice from you actually for videos on me explaining something.

2574
02:44:23.590 --> 02:44:28.550
The written word never really catches everything.
Uh,

2575
02:44:28.930 --> 02:44:31.570
and there's a lot to be learned from body language.

2576
02:44:31.571 --> 02:44:34.690
And if I explain it technique,
I can explain it in writing,

2577
02:44:34.691 --> 02:44:37.300
but you could tell by the questions that people didn't understand it at all.

2578
02:44:37.660 --> 02:44:41.890
So most people are visual learners.
So the membership sites,

2579
02:44:41.950 --> 02:44:45.730
which should be out within the next three months will be up soon.

2580
02:44:45.731 --> 02:44:49.840
And of course it will broadcast that and you'll announce that on strength.

2581
02:44:49.841 --> 02:44:51.130
Sensata come on.

2582
02:44:51.550 --> 02:44:55.510
Where can people find you on social media if they want to just receive those

2583
02:44:55.511 --> 02:45:00.400
updates as you publish them?
Uh,
strength Sensei on Facebook.
Got It.

2584
02:45:01.900 --> 02:45:03.460
Go ahead.
I'm sorry.
Go ahead.

2585
02:45:03.540 --> 02:45:08.260
And I've got a strength sensei equivalent in German,

2586
02:45:08.500 --> 02:45:13.480
Spanish,
Russian,
and French.
So if you go strength Sensei,

2587
02:45:13.481 --> 02:45:14.060
Deutsch,
you,

2588
02:45:14.060 --> 02:45:19.010
they'll be the German version and French sensei that are false sense.

2589
02:45:19.130 --> 02:45:21.040
It lot of thoughts on this Spanish show.

2590
02:45:21.690 --> 02:45:24.620
So depending on your native tongue,
ah,

2591
02:45:24.830 --> 02:45:29.530
the same information is there and I've got about a dozen translation in

2592
02:45:29.531 --> 02:45:31.260
different languages to my sites.

2593
02:45:31.261 --> 02:45:34.540
So English is not your first language and you're more comfortable,

2594
02:45:34.541 --> 02:45:38.050
let's say with German or Dutch or French.
Uh,

2595
02:45:38.080 --> 02:45:41.590
the most popular articles get translated,
um,

2596
02:45:42.060 --> 02:45:47.050
and even in Russia.
So it's picking up,
I mean,
my website,
this,

2597
02:45:47.790 --> 02:45:52.040
and then I think it's 83,000 on Alexis for being in,

2598
02:45:52.050 --> 02:45:56.080
in that new business for a year and a half.
It's pretty good score.

2599
02:45:56.980 --> 02:45:57.221
Yeah,

2600
02:45:57.221 --> 02:46:02.221
and I will obviously everybody listening link to all of the sites and uh,

2601
02:46:03.250 --> 02:46:06.580
to Charleston social media in the show notes

2602
02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:10.190
so you guys can find the links and resources

2603
02:46:10.190 --> 02:46:15.160
<v 1>and so on@fourhourworkweek.com forward slash podcast all spelled out.
Uh,</v>

2604
02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:18.110
any parting parting comments or parting words?
Charles?

2605
02:46:18.520 --> 02:46:22.920
<v 3>Well,
thank you.
I mean you,</v>

2606
02:46:23.040 --> 02:46:27.720
it's a great honor for me to be in the same list of

2607
02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:33.870
invitees as Schwarzenegger in Anthony Robbins.
Those are big names.
So,
uh,

2608
02:46:33.970 --> 02:46:36.270
you're a big name to yeah,
but you know what,
it's like,

2609
02:46:37.180 --> 02:46:41.310
it's a big pleasure for me and I really appreciate your time and the ability to

2610
02:46:41.311 --> 02:46:43.320
be reaching your audience.

2611
02:46:43.380 --> 02:46:47.190
I think that's what I want the most grateful for.
He said,

2612
02:46:47.820 --> 02:46:51.970
I think that people who have it eel perceived notion in me,
uh,

2613
02:46:52.030 --> 02:46:55.260
we'll know more of a human side.
And um,

2614
02:46:55.950 --> 02:47:00.950
I think that's a big factor in life and I'm forever grateful for the

2615
02:47:00.991 --> 02:47:01.824
opportunity,
Tim.

2616
02:47:02.250 --> 02:47:02.941
<v 1>Oh,
my pleasure.</v>

2617
02:47:02.941 --> 02:47:06.540
I really wanted people to have the chance to kind of sit down with us at the

2618
02:47:06.541 --> 02:47:10.950
table and and really dig deep and get to know you a bit,

2619
02:47:10.951 --> 02:47:13.200
so I really appreciate it.

2620
02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:16.610
I'm sure people will let us know if they want around too,

2621
02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:20.460
which I'm sure will be the case and until next time,
everybody,

2622
02:47:20.820 --> 02:47:22.650
thank you for listening.
Thank you.

2623

<v 7>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.
I get asked all the time,</v>

2624
02:47:32.641 --> 02:47:34.830
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

2625
02:47:35.170 --> 02:47:37.740
My answer is inevitably athletic Greens.

2626
02:47:37.741 --> 02:47:40.230
It is your all in one nutritional insurance.

2627
02:47:40.260 --> 02:47:41.970
I recommended it in the four hour body,

2628
02:47:42.030 --> 02:47:45.960
did not get paid for that and I travel with it to avoid getting sick.

2629
02:47:46.200 --> 02:47:49.020
I take it in the mornings to ensure optimal performance.

2630
02:47:49.260 --> 02:47:50.490
It just covers all my basis.

2631
02:47:50.520 --> 02:47:54.510
If I can't get what I need through whole food meals throughout the rest of the

2632
02:47:54.510 --> 02:47:59.340
day,
and you can get 50 oh my gosh,
50% off.
Yes,
50% off.

2633
02:47:59.370 --> 02:48:04.370

2636
02:48:13.441 --> 02:48:16.920
For me,
it just covers the basis,
takes a load off my mind,

2637
02:48:16.980 --> 02:48:21.690
puts a lot in my body and check it out.

this episode is brought to you by 99 designs your one stop shop for all things

2639
02:48:29.011 --> 02:48:30.570
graphic design related.

2640
02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:35.580
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers,

2641
02:48:35.581 --> 02:48:39.270
including sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

2642
02:48:39.271 --> 02:48:43.260
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

2643
02:48:43.290 --> 02:48:44.123
the brainstorming.

2644
02:48:44.130 --> 02:48:47.430
A lot of it took place with designers from around the world and here's how it

2645
02:48:47.431 --> 02:48:51.630
works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,
a website,

2646
02:48:51.960 --> 02:48:54.180
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

2647
02:48:54.420 --> 02:48:57.930
you submit that project and designers from around the world.

2648
02:48:58.140 --> 02:49:00.600
We'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

2649
02:49:00.840 --> 02:49:04.290
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

2650
02:49:04.291 --> 02:49:05.970
money back.
It's that straight forward,

2651
02:49:06.300 --> 02:49:09.690
and many of who are listening have already used it and created some amazing

2652
02:49:09.691 --> 02:49:12.060
things that I'll be sharing it in the future.
But in the meantime,

2653
02:49:12.061 --> 02:49:15.000
