1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.130
What else do you recall from your breakfast?
Hamilton?

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.920
I ate it from a ceramic bowl with a metal fork.

3
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.263
Optimal.

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.060
<v 1>At this altitude,</v>

5
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:15.300
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.770
Posting a question.
Now

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.710
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue,

8
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.363
so

9
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.710
<v 0>this episode is brought to you by inc tell and I've used them personally ever</v>

10
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:39.060
since I wrote the four hour work week.

11
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.140
I've been asked over and over again how I choose to delegate tasks,

12
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.110
how I do 80 20 analysis and so on.

13
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.070
At the root of many of those decisions is a simple question.

14
00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:51.270
Actually two questions.
Number one,

15
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:54.030
how can I invest money to improve my quality of life?

16
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.760
I use that in investing as well.
The second,

17
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
how can I spend a little money or moderate money to save significant time inc

18
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:06.540
tell is one of those investments there a turnkey solution for all of your

19
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:08.190
imaginable customer care needs?

20
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.420
I used ink tell during the launch of the four hour body,
which was very,

21
00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:16.830
very involved and they provided 24 seven customer service for my land rush

22
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:21.390
campaign because it was critical for me to take care of every person who

23
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:22.980
purchased my books and participated.

24
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.600
This allowed me to focus on the things that I am better at,
my strengths,

25
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.960
like the marketing plan that we'd worked on for six months,

26
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.040
implementing that until trains their experience.

27
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.040
Customer service reps to know your business and your products inside and out and

28
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:39.990
make it your customers are raving fans.

29
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.100
They answer more than a million customer service requests every year and they

30
00:01:44.101 --> 00:01:48.870
can do so across all platforms including email,
phone,
social media,
texts,

31
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.943
even chat,

32
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.240
leaving your customers with poor service or just mediocre service,

33
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.050
which by the way,
in a competitive pool is a huge liability.

34
00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:03.051
Long wait times are unanswered messages carries a massive cost and risk to your

35
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:04.170
business.

36
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.190
Ink Tell removes the logistics and headaches of this type of communication,

37
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:12.330
allowing you to focus on your strengths and grow your business.

38
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.060
It can be a real competitive advantage.
And I see many,

39
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:20.061
many ecommerce companies and tech companies thinking of customer service as a

40
00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:23.160
good enough checkbox or an afterthought,

41
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.430
and it just like airbnb use design and innovative ways to be a competitor and to

42
00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:31.920
win.
You can do the same thing with customer service.

Tim,

48
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.400
this episode is brought to you by leadership in turbulent times,

49
00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:03.160
which is the latest book by the Ever Amazing Pulitzer Prize winning author,

50
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:04.630
Doris Kearns Goodwin.

51
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:09.490
I had her on the podcast not too long ago and she just blew everyone away.

52
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.610
What an incredible storyteller and weaver of history and lessons from history.

53
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:20.890

Doris D.
R I.

54
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:25.120
S.
It was a captivating conversation that that really blew me away.

55
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.830
Leadership and turbulent times.

56
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.600
That is the latest book is a culmination of five decades of a claim studies in

57
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:32.530
presidential history,

58
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.800
which offers an illuminating exploration of the early development.

59
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:37.240
That's super key.
Early Development,

60
00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:42.130
growth and exercise of leadership and uh,
draws upon four presidents,

61
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.390
which we'll get to in a second.
Goodwin asks and answers in those pages.

62
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:49.810
The questions are leaders born or made,
where does ambition come from?

63
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.330
How does adversity affect the growth of leadership?

64
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.990
Does the leader make the times or do the times make the leader?

65
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.800
And she draws upon the four presidents she has studied most closely,

66
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:02.800
namely Abraham Lincoln Theater,
Roosevelt,
Franklin d,

67
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:06.070
Roosevelt and Lyndon B Johnson to show and how they recognize leadership

68
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:10.720
qualities within themselves and were recognized as leaders by others.

69
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.830
And I mentioned early development being key because it goes back to their first

70
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:19.831
soldier as an experiments and attempts at engaging with policy and public life

71
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.080
and covers their failures,
their near misses and lessons learned.

72
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.730
So it applies to anyone who is trying to make a study of leadership or how they

73
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:34.180
can better lead both themselves and others.

74
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.260
It's important to underscore that no common pattern describes completely a

75
00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:39.820
single trajectory of leadership,

76
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.610
although set apart in background abilities and temperament.

77
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.230
These four men shared a fierce ambition and deep seated resilience that enabled

78
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:51.280
them to surmount uncommon hardships and at their best all four were guided by a

79
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:52.840
sense of moral purpose.

80
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.160
This seminal work provides an accessible and essential roadmap for aspiring and

81
00:04:57.161 --> 00:05:01.030
established leaders in every field.
I highly,
highly recommend it.

Please meet Hamilton Morris

115
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.570
Hamilton.
Welcome to the show.
Thanks for having me.

116
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.200
I have been hoping to have this conversation on the podcast ever since I first

117
00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:20.531
saw your show and have recommended the show too.

118
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.830
Probably more people than any other show I've seen in the last three to five

119
00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:28.880
years.
So thank you for making it,
first of all.
That's great.
I'm glad you like it.

120
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.700
And I wanted to begin the conversation and we're going to bounce around a lot.

121
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.840
I will mispronounce many,
many things,
so please pardon my ignorance.
