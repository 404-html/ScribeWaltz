Hello boys and girls.

2
00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:20.150
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

3
00:00:20.151 --> 00:00:25.100
it is always my job to deconstruct world class performers of various types and

4
00:00:25.101 --> 00:00:29.720
across many disciplines and today we have Liz Lambert on the show.
Liz,

5
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.820
thanks so much for taking the time,
so happy to be here.

6
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.200
I'm thrilled to have you finally in front of me and I'm going to give people a

7
00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:39.080
little bit of context.
So who is Liz Lambert,

8
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.140
Liz Lambert at the Liz Lambert at Instagram and Twitter first purchased a seedy

9
00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:49.370
motel on South Congress Avenue 23 years ago and transformed it into Hotel San

10
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.460
Jose,
which has become known today as the Quintessential Austin hotel.

11
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.440
The success of Hotel San Jose,

12
00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:57.800
which sparked a revitalization in the city is now thriving south Congress

13
00:00:57.801 --> 00:01:02.030
district,
which we'll definitely talk about.
Led her to launch bunkhouse group,

14
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.260
a hospitality company,

15
00:01:03.261 --> 00:01:06.830
founded on the pillars of design and music and community driven experiences.

16
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.821
Since then,

17
00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:11.660
she's expanded bunkhouses unique hotel portfolio to include El Cosmico,

18
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.380
which has been recommended to me about a thousand times the community lodging

19
00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:16.370
concept in Marfa.

20
00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:21.371
Also a place worth talking about the iconic Austin Motel and renovated Motor

21
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.460
Court Hotel and hotel St Cecilia where I was just two nights ago.
In fact,

22
00:01:25.461 --> 00:01:30.170
a 14 room secluded estate in Austin Hotel,
Havana,
Havana,

23
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.160
depending on where you are.

24
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.790
The historic property on San Antonio's riverwalk and most recently is added

25
00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:39.791
bunkhouses first International Hotel Hotel San Cristobal Baca in Todos,

26
00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:40.251
Santos,

27

Mexico and the first non Texas property a domestically the Phoenix hotel to

28
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:49.040
their hotel portfolio.
Lamberton bunkhouse also operate Joe's coffee,

29
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.750
the Popular Austin Coffee Shop,

30
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.920
which I frequent myself and that currently includes three locations and an east

31
00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:58.880
side event space.
Fair market.
Also located in Austin.

32
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.860
They've really gave you a full,
oh,

33
00:02:00.861 --> 00:02:04.240
we're going to cover covering all the basis layer.
It's 4,000 hotel.

34
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.180
The Magdalena is currently in development and is slated to open on South

35
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.900
Congress in 2020 maybe 2019.

36
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.700
We'll see maybe 2019 wow.
I head of schedule.
That's unusual.
I would imagine

37
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.160
it's a moving target and there's so many places that we could start with this.

38
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.950
And we have some mutual friends,
uh,
which,

39
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.510
which makes me always a bit more comfortable and excited to jump into things.

40
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.110
But I thought we would begin with the last days of San Jose.

41
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.630
Now this is a documentary and I hold you fully accountable for keeping me up way

42
00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:45.110
past my bedtime.
I,
I've watched most of it.
I haven't seen all of it.

43
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.400
I'll be honest,
uh,
because I had to go to bed last night at some point.

44
00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:54.370
There's a surprise ending really well,
it's,
it's,

45
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.410
it's a documentary on Hotel San Jose's origins.

46
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.020
And I thought I would share a note from my assistant so my assistant doesn't add

47
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:05.770
notes,
too much of my prep documentation at all.

48
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.780
And this is her note quote.

49
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:10.600
I've watched most of the documentary on and off throughout the day.
Just,

50
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.300
just listened to her talk to the humanity of people.

51
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:16.300
The San Jose tells you everything important you need to know about her.

52
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.740
And I wasn't sure quite what that meant.
It was seemed a bit cryptic.

53
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.200
And,
uh,

54
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.430
I have to say a very impressed with the dock B.

55
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.110
Uh,

56
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.110
you must have captured so much footage and you did a really nice job of editing

57
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:39.060
for emotional impact.
I was,

58
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:40.690
<v 2>by the way.
Okay.</v>

59
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.020
I didn't edit and I never could have edited that and I've never would have been

60
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:45.870
in the doc had it been my,
yeah.

61
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.460
<v 1>Your choice.
Could you tell people who don't know?</v>

62
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.010
And I imagine that's a lot of people,
a lot of people.
Yeah.

63
00:03:53.011 --> 00:03:56.610
I never released it about the doc.
And why didn't you release this?

64
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.090
I was trying to find it online so I could push it out to people.

65
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.960
<v 2>You know,
it's terrible.
It is every year.
This is one of those things.</v>

66
00:04:02.961 --> 00:04:06.170
Every year it's on my list to do and I can never quite,

67
00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:10.340
so this is a documentary and I'll tell you why.
I talked about why I never did.

68
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.390
Um,
this is a documentary that I did when I first bought the San Jose,

69
00:04:14.391 --> 00:04:19.160
which I used to be a lawyer.
It was sort of a change of career inadvertently.

70
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.560
And I bought an old motel down on south congress.

71
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.073
Um,
I,

72
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.920
I have terrible Elsdon allergies today.
So sorry about it.

73
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.720
<v 1>That's okay.
I was,
we were chatting that this is audio verite.
Yeah.</v>

74
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.740
<v 2>Truthfully,
um,
I Biden in the mid nineties,</v>

75
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.870
I bought an old motel down in south congress.

76
00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:45.860
I was a lawyer at the time that I'd basically just walked up to the door,

77
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.120
knocked on the door and there was a Taiwanese couple there that own the motel.

78
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.870
And at the time there was nothing on South Congress,
which is as you know,

79
00:04:53.871 --> 00:04:58.610
a very popular area and on a hot spot,
cool area,
very hip.

80
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.810
And it wasn't a car on the street back then.
I mean,
honestly,
and um,

81
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.210
they were about to put the motel on the market and I sort of,
you know,

82
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.380
purse.
I told him,
don't do that yet.
Let me see if I could do something about it.

83
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.240
I ended up buying the San Jose not knowing anything about what I was doing.
Four,

84
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.560
$500,000.

85
00:05:18.561 --> 00:05:23.561
My mother co signed a note and suddenly they handed me the keys and I'm as I'm

86
00:05:23.871 --> 00:05:28.750
away and I knew nothing about running a hotel or a motel or anything,

87
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.220
knew nothing about business.
Really

88
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.770
<v 1>paint,</v>

89
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.770
paint a picture for people as to the clientele and what was the kind of the

90
00:05:35.931 --> 00:05:39.080
state of affairs because people think South Congress now and they're like,
oh,

91
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.430
cool.

92
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.430
Like I have fancy Japanese food and I can go have a go have some Moscow.

93
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.950
<v 2>Oh,
no,
no,
no.
It was dicey.
I mean,
people didn't go down there at night.</v>

94
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.720
There were no businesses on the street.

95
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.760
The continental club was there and had been there since 1957 and it remained,

96
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.250
um,
but really was no place to eat.

97
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.240
The first Schlotzky's was actually on south congress,
really tiny place,

98
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:06.560
but there was nothing down there.
And I had moved back into the neighborhood.
And,

99
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.130
um,
but I would go to the continental club alliance,
so sit on a bar stool there.

100
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:12.260
And I've watched the San Jose across the street,

101
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:17.261
which was an old motor court built in the 30s I Spanish colonial revival style

102
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.910
painted seafoam green at the time and it looked like it was empty,

103
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.360
but it was really,
because there were people,
it was full all the time,

104
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.190
but it was 30 bucks,

105
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:33.191
25 to 30 bucks a night and nobody really had luggage or cars and nobody really

106
00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:37.970
came out during the day so it looked very quiet.

107
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.160
But at night it was teeming with life and it was,
you know,
there was your,

108
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.260
it was junkies and prostitutes and but a lot of good people too that were just

109
00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:50.630
down on their luck for one reason or another,

110
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.020
couldn't pay a deposit first and last month's deposit or somehow something in

111
00:06:56.421 --> 00:06:59.900
life had happened that dislodge them.
But you know,

112
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:03.500
they could get a hotel room for either a couple of nights or some people live

113
00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:06.710
there.
They were residents that live there permanently,

114
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.060
but they just paid by the day or by the week.
I have so many questions.

115
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:14.720
I could do an hour just on this doc and it's not obviously because I have

116
00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:18.050
anything to gain financially from pushing the docs.
It's not even available.

117
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.880
So I was going to tell you why it's not available.
Okay.
I shot the dock,

118
00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:26.900
which was following I as an undergraduate,

119
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:29.810
I was a creative writing major with a concentration in poetry,

120
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.190
which just for background for folks,
and this is,
this is my,
my non linear style.

121
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.670
I apologize.
Uh,
where did you,
where did you,

122
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.040
just a quick kind of bullets.

123
00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:42.830
Where did you grow up and where did you do your Undergrad?
Yeah,

124
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.670
I grew up in west Texas and I did my Undergrad.

125
00:07:46.671 --> 00:07:48.830
I started at Tcu in Fort Worth.

126
00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:52.550
I'd had a brief stint at Stanford and then I finished at ut.

127
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.930
So I've seen the world doing creative writing and humanities.

128
00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.110
So I had a lot with a concentration in poetry.

129
00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:04.540
So I had a lot of friends who were writers or who,
um,
you know,

130
00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.040
I've wrote a lot at the time.
Even back then,

131
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.950
whether it was journaling or poetry or whatever it was,

132
00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:14.630
and friends would encourage me to write down when I stopped my law job at some

133
00:08:14.631 --> 00:08:15.590
point when I knew,

134
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:20.650
I knew I was in over my head or in a good way over my head at the San Jose.

135
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.290
But I needed to do something with the motel.

136
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.490
I couldn't continue on at $30 a night with people stealing sheets and bleeding

137
00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:32.770
on sheets and burning cheats,
you know,
like your name it.
Um,

138
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:34.250
but I,

139
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.250
people kept encouraging me to write down things that happened during the day

140
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.230
because I would tell stories at dinner,

141
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:44.231
I go to dinner with friends and it would be absolutely absurd or crazy in the

142
00:08:45.141 --> 00:08:50.060
first five or 10 minutes.
You see examples.
Yeah.
So I,

143
00:08:50.061 --> 00:08:54.470
um,
I didn't have time to write it down because I was literally like,
you know,

144
00:08:54.471 --> 00:08:55.304
the,
the place,

145
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.730
the place had been redone in the seventies I think was the last time.

146
00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:01.170
So it had shag carpet still.

147
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:05.550
So you can imagine as you tried to vacuum that shag carpet,
what is like,
I mean,

148
00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:09.150
there were definitely people,
it was definitely a place where you did drugs.

149
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:14.150
It was definitely a place where you had whatever homeless pet you might have.

150
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:17.550
I mean it was just like,
and then the housekeeper that had been at the,

151
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.550
the motel before I bought it,
there were,
uh,

152
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.280
a husband and wife the sues who were awesome people,

153
00:09:26.281 --> 00:09:30.150
but they were the only employees besides Mr Woo Hoo.

154
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.240
I swear to God was like two years of luring God in almost blind.

155
00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:37.340
And he was a housekeeper.
So like the state of the rooms going now,

156
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.290
we got there were just,
I mean,
I think of a hold and uh,

157
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.590
and I cleaned rims for quite a while,

158
00:09:43.591 --> 00:09:48.180
so I was so busy that I wasn't writing things down and there was no journaling.

159
00:09:48.181 --> 00:09:52.050
There was no,
that kind of thing.
But I did find a camera,

160
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.510
it was right when those little pocket cameras came out.

161
00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:59.430
There was a little Sony PC seven.
And,
um,
I got one of those instead of,

162
00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:03.750
I just started talking to people,
people knew the camera was there,
I put it up,

163
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.710
the front desk had a little glass thing that you slip money through and I just

164
00:10:07.711 --> 00:10:11.400
duct taped it to the front for a while and then when I would go out to knock on

165
00:10:11.401 --> 00:10:15.840
doors or kick people out or collect money cause it wasn't like you came and paid

166
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.330
on a daily basis,
you really,

167
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.450
I had to chase down money and so I would just take it with me.
And um,

168
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:27.830
when I was done,
I was really lucky at the time that I had a friend who was um,

169
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:32.850
at Afi as in cinematography,
American Film Institute.

170
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:33.840
Got It.
Uh,

171
00:10:33.841 --> 00:10:38.180
her name is Jen Lane and she just now is the producer of the new queer eye.

172
00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.050
Super popular.
Yeah.
And um,

173
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:45.420
she was one of my good friends and then she had a friend named to Briesewitz who

174
00:10:45.421 --> 00:10:47.400
is a producer now as well,

175
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:52.401
but a very well known a cinematographer before she became a producer.

176
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:57.300
She shot the first three seasons of the wire and that's why the wire looks like

177
00:10:57.301 --> 00:11:01.620
it does.
Wow.
So they were both in film school and they came down and I said,

178
00:11:01.621 --> 00:11:05.700
you guys come help me shoot.
Because they were both directors of photography,

179
00:11:05.701 --> 00:11:06.780
what we're studying.

180
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:12.350
And they were awesome because not only do they shoot some B roll and then when

181
00:11:12.541 --> 00:11:16.290
it was ready to shut the motel down,
they shot the last three weeks,

182
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.430
but outta also has encouraged me.
You said,
um,

183
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.370
audio verite.
That's exactly what she told me.

184
00:11:23.371 --> 00:11:25.680
I was really worried about a big microphone and stuff,

185
00:11:25.681 --> 00:11:29.540
but nobody would have talked to me.
Right.
You know,
like she was like in,

186
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:33.360
don't worry about your film style.
Just talk to people.

187
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:37.200
And the story is compelling enough.
And that was,

188
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.080
those were words of wisdom and it is,
as long as you could hear it right,

189
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.010
you know,
it was going to be okay.

190
00:11:44.011 --> 00:11:47.250
You didn't need a huge microphone to stick in somebody's face.

191
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.660
Just make sure it was audible enough.
So you have this,

192
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:54.070
you have some incredible footage

193
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.410
<v 1>and I mean you really do capture,</v>

194
00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.690
I'm searching for a word besides humanity because it seems too high concept

195
00:12:01.691 --> 00:12:06.400
maybe for,
for for what I'm trying to convey,
but you,
you captured the,

196
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.863
<v 0>okay,</v>

197
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:14.110
<v 1>the vulnerability and this sincerity of so many different types of people,</v>

198
00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:20.480
of all different colors of all different types who are completely marginalized,

199
00:12:20.481 --> 00:12:24.950
discarded these sort of invisible people.
And uh,
I

200
00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:31.790
watched this and I was having just a bitch of a day yesterday and I was feeling

201
00:12:31.791 --> 00:12:35.690
sorry for myself and I was talking to friends and we were commiserating about

202
00:12:35.691 --> 00:12:40.240
various things and I've had a,
what I would consider in my life,
a,

203
00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:44.810
a bit of a hailstorm of a week.
And then I watched this and I was just like,

204
00:12:44.811 --> 00:12:47.300
you asshole God,

205
00:12:47.301 --> 00:12:52.301
you should get down on your knees every day and just either thank God that you

206
00:12:53.571 --> 00:12:56.630
have the bed that you have to sleep in,

207
00:12:56.631 --> 00:12:58.950
that you have the food that you have to eat.
It's,
it's,

208
00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:03.350
it was really humbling and you're holding this footage,

209
00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:07.550
you have these stars to be helping you.

210
00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.700
Why not?
Put it out.

211
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.520
<v 2>I kept busy.
I mean,
here's the thing,
I will help you put this thing out.</v>

212
00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:17.070
Let's do that.
I would love that.
It's,
it's last three years.

213
00:13:17.071 --> 00:13:20.700
It's been at the top of my list and I keep having people that say they'll help

214
00:13:20.701 --> 00:13:23.320
and then you know,
everybody's busy and so it was,

215
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:28.610
<v 1>I can,
I will commit right now publicly.
Like I will help you put it out.</v>

216
00:13:28.611 --> 00:13:31.580
So happy about that.
It's,
it's,
it's very,

217
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.230
as long as you're not expecting like a,

218
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:38.220
a full blown red carpet theatrical release if you just want it to be available.

219
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.570
<v 2>I just want it to be available.
So what happened was Brian,
one of was done it,</v>

220
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.860
you'll see the,

221
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.750
the doc ends as I close the door when we close the San Jose,

222
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.070
we fall during the,
the footage.
What?

223
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:56.300
During the documentary we follow five or six people that are permanent residents

224
00:13:56.301 --> 00:14:00.330
at the San Jose.
Again,
I've,
it's just shooting on the fly,

225
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.770
kind of keeping a video diary.

226
00:14:01.771 --> 00:14:05.820
And so I would turn the camera on myself every once while I never,

227
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.910
even when I began editing and realized that I couldn't edit it,

228
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.360
I had 90 hours of footage.
I mean,
there's so much good stuff in there,

229
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.700
but there was no way I was going to be able to tell a story.

230
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:19.110
So another friend of my friend Jen from Afi,
Tina Bizarro,

231
00:14:19.111 --> 00:14:23.370
whose works in the business still today,
uh,

232
00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:24.810
I hired her to edit,

233
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.150
but I didn't have her edit until about four or five years into the San Jose

234
00:14:30.151 --> 00:14:30.984
being open.

235
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:36.420
And so it was hilarious because she would see people that might have passed

236
00:14:36.421 --> 00:14:41.340
through the footage or the documentary and they would have no idea who she was,

237
00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:46.230
but she spent hours and hours with watching them and you know,

238
00:14:46.231 --> 00:14:50.370
she wouldn't be hey.
And they'd be like,
yeah,
you know,
way too much,

239
00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:51.351
that kind of thing.

240
00:14:51.351 --> 00:14:56.330
But she did an amazing job and she gave compelling reasons that I should also be

241
00:14:56.331 --> 00:15:00.050
a character in the movie because it wasn't just about,

242
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:05.210
it was also about my story in about me living there as part of a community.

243
00:15:05.211 --> 00:15:09.380
And the struggle I was having.
Everybody had a struggle,
different struggles.

244
00:15:09.381 --> 00:15:10.280
But you know,

245
00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:15.281
one of the remarkable things is that they're all behind me,

246
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:17.900
the folks that live there and generally.

247
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.340
<v 1>So can I,
can I pause for a second?
Yep.</v>

248
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:25.510
So there are a few like lilypad hops that I want to know more about.

249
00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:30.530
So first is you went to three places for undergrad focusing on creative writing

250
00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:33.860
with an emphasis on poetry.

251
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:39.770
Why did you go to three places and how on earth do you go from there to law?

252
00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.030
Let's start with that.

253
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.860
<v 2>Um,
I went to three places because my family were,</v>

254
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:50.710
I'm from West Texas.
My,
my parents met at Tcu,

255
00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.870
my grandfather played football for Tcu.

256
00:15:52.871 --> 00:15:56.530
My Dad played football for Tcu and my oldest brothers played football for Tcu,

257
00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.340
everybody and the,
and the kind of cousin group,

258
00:16:00.341 --> 00:16:02.170
everybody went started at Tcu.

259
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.410
And I got there in Fort Worth is a lovely place.

260
00:16:05.411 --> 00:16:07.660
I'm crazy about forth worth these days,

261
00:16:07.661 --> 00:16:12.600
but I always knew it wasn't really going to be a fit for me.
Um,

262
00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:17.680
and once I kind of got interested in creative writing the program,

263
00:16:17.681 --> 00:16:18.760
there wasn't that strong.

264
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.620
I went to Stanford because I think it was aspirational of what I,

265
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.540
I thought that's where I would transfer.

266
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.780
I went there for summer school and then I,
I,

267
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:32.790
I was accepted into as a regular student at Stanford and I deferred.

268
00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.340
Um,
I,

269
00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:39.520
there were things going on with my family that I needed to come back to Texas

270
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:44.730
and I'm,
once I came back,
I just,
in terms of if you're comfortable saying,
man,

271
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:49.040
just interest sickness or divorce my parents yeah.
And,
um,

272
00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:51.340
was really close to my mom.
And so it was,

273
00:16:51.341 --> 00:16:55.630
I felt like I needed to be closer and I defer to semester and then I ended up

274
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.920
just going to ut.
I always loved Austin and if,
you know,

275
00:16:59.921 --> 00:17:03.400
in the long run,
I'm really happy I did.
I mean,

276
00:17:03.401 --> 00:17:06.970
when I arrived in Austin and the early eighties,

277
00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.530
it felt like the place was made for me.
You know,
it just felt like home.

278
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.950
I hit about it,
you know,
I'm a Texan through and through and,

279
00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:19.750
but there were a lot of reasons that I didn't really fit comfortably into other

280
00:17:19.751 --> 00:17:23.940
parts of Texas.
I was gay at the time.
I wasn't even out.

281
00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:28.360
And I was a little more creative.
Maybe I do,

282
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:33.280
I haven't found my place in Texas except for West Texas.
And,

283
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:36.880
um,
you know,
Austin,
it was the state capitol.

284
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.290
The university was huge.
It was,
you know,

285
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:45.300
this liberal place and more conservative state and the blueberries,

286
00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.050
the blueberry and the tomatoes.

287
00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:53.130
And then in the was amazing and there were rivers and lakes and you know,

288
00:17:53.521 --> 00:17:54.900
it's,
it was,

289
00:17:55.080 --> 00:18:00.080
I felt it felt like home for those people who have never been to Texas.

290
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.840
And there certainly lots of international folks listening and they have,

291
00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.840
they may have the image of certainly of the cowboy hat and the boots,

292
00:18:06.841 --> 00:18:08.440
but that's about it.
Uh,

293
00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.490
when you say Texan through and through in other respects for,
for you,

294
00:18:11.491 --> 00:18:15.450
what does that mean?
I'm from West Texas and you know,
that's,

295
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.290
there are a lot of people that grew up in Texas and never even make it to west

296
00:18:19.291 --> 00:18:23.220
Texas is a big state for the you guys who don't know.
I mean,
although Jeff Bezos,

297
00:18:23.221 --> 00:18:26.340
maybe unbeknownst to many people would be one of those people right in the

298
00:18:26.341 --> 00:18:29.700
middle of West Texas is a good place to launch a rocket ship from.

299
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:36.270
Um,
and so,
you know,
it's,
uh,
I,
I'm,

300
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.380
I think sixth or seventh generation in the ranching business.

301
00:18:40.381 --> 00:18:42.930
My family still ranches cow and calf operation.

302
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:48.630
And so there was a certain way Texas,

303
00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:55.930
Texas is like another country for some people.
It really is.
I mean,
Texas.

304
00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:00.360
That's right.
And that comes with a good and bad.
But for me,
mostly it's a,

305
00:19:00.361 --> 00:19:01.650
it's a good thing.
Is there,

306
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:06.660
a friend of mine asked me when I was young and traveling,
he said,

307
00:19:06.661 --> 00:19:11.220
when people,
if people would ask if you were in Europe,
where are you from?

308
00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:14.400
I would say west Texas.
He's like,
that's really odd.

309
00:19:14.401 --> 00:19:17.490
Most people wouldn't say that.
They would say none of that.
You say Texas,

310
00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:20.400
you give the region no texts from,
I'm like,
well,

311
00:19:20.401 --> 00:19:24.930
west Texas is so different than East Texas,
you know,
it is a enormous,

312
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.700
enormous state.
Yeah.
Uh,
so you end up in Austin.

313
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:35.490
How does the law come into the picture and why?
I've,
well,
so as,
as I said,

314
00:19:35.491 --> 00:19:40.160
it was a humanities major,
which I'm forever thankful for.
And uh,

315
00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:44.180
not,
and then I doubled down with a concentration in poetry,
but just,
you don't,

316
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:48.820
you know,
they're not looking for poets out there.
I don't think so much.
Um,

317
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:52.260
and so I,
I applied to go to,

318
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:57.230
I could go get my Mfa was really the path I was on and I graduate degree in

319
00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.073
writing.
Right.

320
00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:03.140
And I applied to one program at Sarah Lawrence and didn't get in.

321
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.330
And I,
I was like,
okay,

322
00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:10.440
what now I knew that I was gonna need a little further education or some other

323
00:20:10.441 --> 00:20:12.360
direction.
So actually,

324
00:20:12.361 --> 00:20:16.470
the first thing I did is I got an internship at Texas monthly and worked there

325
00:20:16.471 --> 00:20:20.760
before.
I didn't went on to work as a,
as a paid,

326
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.440
uh,
I don't even know what it was.
Paid employee,

327
00:20:25.441 --> 00:20:30.441
I guess at Texas monthly for about a year and applied to law school during that

328
00:20:30.541 --> 00:20:33.620
time.
My father always argued that,
um,

329
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.380
law school education was something I'd never be sorry about.

330
00:20:37.381 --> 00:20:40.560
And it was actually the best liberal education you could get.

331
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.650
Do you agree with that now?
I do actually.
You know,

332
00:20:43.651 --> 00:20:47.680
I'm as afraid at the time that it was killed.
Every bit of creativity in me,

333
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.131
you know,

334
00:20:48.131 --> 00:20:53.131
that would somehow learning to think logically would dampen my ability to be

335
00:20:54.011 --> 00:20:58.600
creative.
And I don't think that's true at all.
CIF,

336
00:20:58.690 --> 00:20:59.740
you finish law school.

337
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:04.660
Do you work in the law profession before Hotel San Jose?

338
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.920
I did indeed.

339
00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:11.280
So I went straight from law school to the DA's office in Manhattan and work

340
00:21:12.401 --> 00:21:16.960
there for three and a half years or so and then,
um,

341
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:21.850
move back to Austin and worked at the Attorney General's office.

342
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.360
So it was a trial lawyer.
Um,
and again,

343
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:27.130
something I'll never be sorry about.

344
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:31.720
I made amazing friends that I'm still in touch with.

345
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.520
On a regular basis from that,

346
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.530
from a text thread to a occasional reunions.
Um,

347
00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:43.560
but it also taught me how to think in a way that has served me really well in

348
00:21:44.051 --> 00:21:48.300
business and in just in the world.
Um,
it,

349
00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:52.150
it teaches you a form of rigor,
I think to be a trial lawyer,

350
00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:57.450
to understand all the facts of any situation and to,

351
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.200
again,
to put it together.

352
00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:03.220
So understanding the facts then of your situation at the time.

353
00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:08.600
If I,
if I,
if I,
if I contrast,
contrast isn't the right word.

354
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:12.340
Sounds too judgy.
If I look at,
if I look at your path

355
00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:18.730
side by side with the paths of other former lawyers I know,

356
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:23.080
which are many,
a lot,
right?
So maybe they say,
I don't want to do law,

357
00:22:23.081 --> 00:22:26.260
but I'm going to do management consulting.
I don't want to do law.

358
00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:29.590
I'm going to start a company with my friend or go to business school.

359
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:32.350
There aren't many who say,
I don't want to do law.

360
00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.990
I'm going to buy a hotel that's,

361
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.740
that's full of drug addicts and prostitutes and so on.
So how,

362
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:44.050
why that particular choice,
how did that,
how did that come to pass?

363
00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:47.500
Yeah,
I think partially it was serendipity.
Um,

364
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:52.150
I was in the right place at the right time on the right street.

365
00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:57.070
What appealed about it to you?
Because I mean,
for a lot of people that would be,

366
00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.450
it would have the,
it would have a repellent effect,
but you had an attract,

367
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.430
if you think about it,
it can come from the DA's office.

368
00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:11.460
And a lot of the work I did was with a lot of the same,

369
00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.540
I don't know exactly where that concentric circle is,
but you know,

370
00:23:16.541 --> 00:23:20.980
a lot of the people I dealt with in New York and in the criminal justice system,

371
00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:27.150
whether it was from a police ride along or just looking at the stories of people

372
00:23:27.491 --> 00:23:32.491
every day down and out or in trouble or you know,

373
00:23:33.091 --> 00:23:38.091
with when things get cross in one way or the other in their lives was not

374
00:23:38.561 --> 00:23:43.510
something new for me that way in that I wasn't scared of the,

375
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.830
you know,
junkies and,
and um,
you know,

376
00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.810
like I said,
again,
there were a lot of really good people there,
but we're at a,

377
00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:54.020
at a moment in their lives really clear in the doc.

378
00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:58.680
It's just part of the reason why,
yeah,
it's going to get released.
That's right.

379
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.080
But there were a lot of people hustling and whether that be a good hustle or a

380
00:24:03.081 --> 00:24:07.670
bad hustle.
And I'm a big believer in hustling,
but there was some PR I got,

381
00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:10.790
there's some pretty good grifters in there as well.

382
00:24:10.791 --> 00:24:15.420
But so it wasn't unfamiliar mill you for me.
Um,

383
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:20.270
but I always was interested in design.
Um,
it's something that I,

384
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:24.650
uh,
had always enjoyed.

385
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:28.350
And my brother,
one of my brothers was,
um,

386
00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.990
I had worked for ICF international contract furnishings.
Um,
kind of like no.

387
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:37.730
And um,
was I wish I knew.
No,
no,
no.

388
00:24:37.731 --> 00:24:41.280
It's like a Nolan is a business that makes,
um,
it,

389
00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:46.230
it probably started in mid century,
it was known for Florence Knoll and uh,

390
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:49.020
may issued a lot of classic,
uh,

391
00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.740
furniture that you would see and you know,

392
00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.730
like means Vandero did Steph or no,
or got it.
Okay.

393
00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:01.490
Um,
design.
He was in design I should say.
Um,

394
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:06.520
and so it's a world that I was always fascinated by and it was really not this

395
00:25:07.101 --> 00:25:10.750
clear path.
It was,
I,
and I've also always been,

396
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:15.730
I've always loved hotels.
Did you dislike law?
Um,
you know,
I,

397
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:20.590
I actually really liked the DA's office.
I liked,
um,
criminal law lunch.

398
00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.753
I've,

399
00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:26.540
there's a line in a Carolyn for Shay poem where she says there's nothing no man

400
00:25:26.541 --> 00:25:30.470
won't do to another.
And that's fascinating to me,

401
00:25:30.471 --> 00:25:35.030
like why we do what we do and why does our criminal justice system do what it

402
00:25:35.031 --> 00:25:38.570
does and respond to the human condition the way it does.
And you know,

403
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:42.470
what are our rules and laws?
Um,
I found that fascinating.

404
00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:46.100
And I also liked trial work.
I like talking to a jury.
I'd like the,

405
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:51.500
I liked the whole,
uh,
not just pageant of it,

406
00:25:51.501 --> 00:25:55.790
but the actual truth finding mission.
I,
like I said like,
um,

407
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.120
I liked being a lawyer where it wasn't,

408
00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:01.570
a lot of people think that the DA's office there,

409
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.450
their whole purpose is to get a conviction or you know,

410
00:26:05.451 --> 00:26:08.870
be an arm of the police in one way or the other.
And it's not,

411
00:26:08.871 --> 00:26:12.740
it's really to do justice or to do the right thing.

412
00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.650
And that's an amazingly powerful thing.

413
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:20.690
He know a lot of people with my politics would have probably gone to the public

414
00:26:20.691 --> 00:26:24.770
defender's office.
Can you explain why that's the case?
Well,

415
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:27.500
because why is that the case?

416
00:26:27.501 --> 00:26:31.520
Why do people do with more liberal politics go to the public defender's office?

417
00:26:31.521 --> 00:26:36.521
I think that the DA's office is often seen to be in alignment.

418
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.990
Pit Bull.
Yeah.
And in alignment with police,
the police and you know,

419
00:26:41.991 --> 00:26:46.050
you've got to to do,
you know,
to fight the good fight,

420
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:49.740
you've got to be the person that that is,
um,

421
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:52.760
on the side of,
um,

422
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:57.660
on the side of justice in the way of making sure that the con constitutional

423
00:26:57.661 --> 00:27:02.610
principles are upheld and you're down in the trenches with folks at often or

424
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:04.890
sometimes wrongly accused.

425
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:09.510
And so it tends to separate out that way.
But at the time,

426
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:13.710
I really thought when it was in law school and thinking about going to a Da's

427
00:27:13.711 --> 00:27:15.840
office that,
um,

428
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.910
it made sense to go to the place that had the power and the prosecutor's office

429
00:27:20.911 --> 00:27:25.080
is the place where you can choose to bring a case or not.
Right.

430
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:30.440
I was also the first openly gay person hired at Manhattan Da's office.

431
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:35.580
1991.
Yeah.
Wow.
Crazy one.
Plenty of queers.

432
00:27:35.581 --> 00:27:39.060
Their first openly,
openly.

433
00:27:39.061 --> 00:27:43.800
And so the first year that I was there,
we actually marched in,

434
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:47.400
uh,
the Manhattan Gay Pride Parade,

435
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.900
like right behind the police department and in front of the fire department.

436
00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:57.030
And my girlfriend at the time was,
she worked at the minority task force on aids.

437
00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:01.370
So of course she was like marching with the House of Africa and they were like

438
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:04.830
having a blast and I was there with the DA's office,

439
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.700
the police and the fire department.
She'd be,
I'd be like,
come march with us.

440
00:28:08.701 --> 00:28:13.620
And she's like,
no,
hell no.
But yeah,

441
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.880
so that was,
uh,
you know,
there was a lot of things that I,
you know,

442
00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:22.980
you could talk for hours about that and you know what I learned and,
and um,

443
00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:26.070
yeah,
I guess I'm just curious why,
why stop?

444
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.860
I mean a lot of people stay in La for a very,
very long time.

445
00:28:28.861 --> 00:28:30.630
So you did have this moment,
you're at the continental club,

446
00:28:30.631 --> 00:28:33.300
you see Hotel San Jose across the street,

447
00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:37.680
you have this deep interest in design,

448
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:42.950
you have empathy for the people who are mostly not seen right.

449
00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.770
Indoors during the day there.
You have all of that,

450
00:28:46.771 --> 00:28:51.771
but you also have this potentially safe career in the legal profession.

451
00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.890
Right.
So why stop?
A couple of jumps between there,
but said,

452
00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:00.060
I stopped at the days of,

453
00:29:00.061 --> 00:29:03.930
as you had a three year commitment and so I stopped about three and a half years

454
00:29:03.931 --> 00:29:05.670
in,
right before you go on the homicide chart.

455
00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:08.670
I think in year four I came back to Texas.

456
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:12.660
I think if you stay in New York too long,
you become a New Yorker.

457
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.650
Yes.
Speaking to someone raised in Long Island,

458
00:29:16.651 --> 00:29:21.310
you have to be careful about that is a,
you have to be very,
very careful.
Yeah.

459
00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.950
Done with the hat that happened to you.
So,
um,

460
00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:27.060
I came back here and working at the Attorney General's office and that was a

461
00:29:27.061 --> 00:29:32.010
little bit different.
I was traveling all over Texas trying cases and um,

462
00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.870
and it wasn't as fascinating to me.
Um,
but it's still like being a lawyer.

463
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.960
And
a couple of things happened.

464
00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:45.650
A friend mine died of AIDS related causes and that was a real jolt to the

465
00:29:46.811 --> 00:29:49.390
system.
It was one of those moments where it was,

466
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:53.080
I felt you better do what you want to do.

467
00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.530
It not what you're supposed to do or you know,

468
00:29:56.531 --> 00:29:59.560
this is your one life in your one chance.
And so I think,

469
00:29:59.561 --> 00:30:02.110
I think that probably happens for a lot of people.

470
00:30:02.111 --> 00:30:07.111
You face mortality up close for the first time and that's either you just kind

471
00:30:08.171 --> 00:30:12.220
of push it away or if you really invited in and,

472
00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:17.770
and,
and grapple with it.
I think it's a life changing thing.

473
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:22.060
It's,
so,
it was,
for me,
it made me,

474
00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.320
I always wondered about the San Jose down on South Congress and have a look at

475
00:30:26.321 --> 00:30:30.970
it and kind of dream about it a little bit.
But that was the,
the,

476
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:36.430
that was the thing that got me out of the chair and across the street and

477
00:30:36.431 --> 00:30:39.370
knocking on the door to find out if they never sell it.

478
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:43.290
<v 1>And,
uh,
we,
we could,</v>

479
00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:48.320
we could spend the entire conversation just on the first few months of easily

480
00:30:48.571 --> 00:30:49.201
the first month,

481
00:30:49.201 --> 00:30:53.610
the first day of your experience at San Jose.

482
00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:58.950
And I'm struggling with where to go to next because I kind of want to stay
there.

483
00:30:58.951 --> 00:31:03.570
But,
but maybe what,
what I can do since it's sitting right here,
uh,

484
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:08.820
is talk about Christopher Alexander and certainly the other authors.

485
00:31:08.821 --> 00:31:13.821
But I'm curious how you found your footing and your approach to doing what you

486
00:31:18.241 --> 00:31:21.960
now do.
And so you kind of land there.
I'm writing,
oh my God,

487
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:25.350
you're doing every possible job.
I mean,

488
00:31:25.351 --> 00:31:28.620
you're using a toothbrush to take some God awful stuff out of a sink.

489
00:31:28.621 --> 00:31:32.210
I couldn't even identify what the sludge was,
is you don't want to know like,

490
00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:34.890
yeah,
you don't want to know,
I mean,
syringes and say,
I mean,

491
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:36.960
you're doing every job imaginable.

492
00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:42.240
How do you figure out your playbook?
And when does,
when does,

493
00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:46.740
when does Christopher Alexander,
not to overweight the importance of,
uh,

494
00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:50.160
of these books,
but for those people who are watching,

495
00:31:50.161 --> 00:31:53.280
you can see this is a book called a pattern language town's buildings

496
00:31:53.281 --> 00:31:57.600
construction,
uh,
which has come up a surprising number of times on this podcast.

497
00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.760
Has It?
It has,
yeah.

498
00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:04.040
<v 2>Interesting.
Well,
so at the time I,
I,</v>

499
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.340
I thought that it was going to take the San Jose,

500
00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:11.370
which was a 24 room motor court built in the thirties down on south congress,

501
00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:16.780
an area of town.
That was it.
It was still pretty abandoned.

502
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:20.950
It was one of those places that it's not unusual at the time that there were

503
00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:24.160
urban cores that when highways had come in,

504
00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:29.460
it had redirected traffic and the small kind of mom and pop stores and urban

505
00:32:30.191 --> 00:32:34.090
downtowns were bypassed.
But there,
you know,

506
00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:38.770
obviously there was a lot of interesting architecture is still,
or buildings,

507
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:43.420
uh,
that,
that were because they were older or,
um,

508
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:46.940
and built at a time where they were on a really important avenue.

509
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:52.300
So Congress for those of you guys who don't know is a main thoroughfare in

510
00:32:52.341 --> 00:32:55.370
Austin that leads directly to the state capitol.

511
00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.800
And at one time it was the main avenue that went all the way to San Antonio,

512
00:33:00.801 --> 00:33:05.750
probably 60 miles to the south.
And so it was a major thoroughfare.

513
00:33:05.751 --> 00:33:08.720
So there were a lot of old buildings and businesses,

514
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:12.500
historic and otherwise,
uh,
along the way.

515
00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:14.643
Um,

516
00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:19.790
so I thought that I would just Redo this 24 room hotel motel.

517
00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:25.460
What I didn't realize was that it was 30 bucks a night,
that if I were,

518
00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:30.580
my idea was maybe it could be $75 and we could just redo it room by room and

519
00:33:30.861 --> 00:33:34.460
then it would be this amazing place close to downtown.

520
00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:36.710
I had lots of friends of would,
you know,

521
00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:41.420
from musicians to creative people to people that were going to visit their

522
00:33:41.421 --> 00:33:43.040
friends in the neighborhood that would stay there.

523
00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:46.970
Once I started trying to crack that plan a little bit,

524
00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:52.240
I realized it was a marketing nightmare that most people that we're going to pay

525
00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:55.280
60,
75 bucks,

526
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:59.000
we're on the highway and they wanted something that they can rely on,

527
00:33:59.001 --> 00:34:02.270
like a motel six.
And I'm was,
you know,

528
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:07.340
if I did learn somebody downtown under South Congress where there were no other

529
00:34:07.341 --> 00:34:08.174
hotels,

530
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:13.830
they weren't going to want to stay next to the crack head next door,

531
00:34:13.831 --> 00:34:18.170
a mom and pop and their van didn't want to rent next to somebody with an arrest

532
00:34:18.171 --> 00:34:22.700
for a warrant for murder.
I haven't worn a warrant out for murder.

533
00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:27.520
Um,
so I mean it was true.
You saw it a little bit of the documentary.
Yeah,

534
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:29.660
the police were around.
I remember when the police first came,

535
00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.910
did they have a drive around the San Jose because there was a big court yard

536
00:34:32.911 --> 00:34:36.500
that was just a parking lot.
And when I first got there it was like,
no,
no,

537
00:34:36.501 --> 00:34:39.740
don't do that.
That looks bad for business and by,
you know,
is there a week?

538
00:34:39.741 --> 00:34:43.880
And I was like,
can you guys come more off?
But,
um,

539
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:48.410
so I started to realize and I would go and get new things and kind of tried to

540
00:34:48.411 --> 00:34:53.411
Redo the rooms one by one and w I get something new and it would be stolen or I

541
00:34:54.081 --> 00:34:57.830
would get,
you know,
like it just wasn't going to work room by room.

542
00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.680
I finally realized there was some footage also who were like,

543
00:35:00.681 --> 00:35:04.640
what happened to the TV?
The TV's destroyed.
Like,
Oh yeah,

544
00:35:04.641 --> 00:35:07.430
the last person who was in your left a gift for the new person.

545
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:10.490
Every one of these is a fucking mess.
But they're saying it's a fucking mess.

546
00:35:10.491 --> 00:35:13.100
Let's see what's in here.
It's like,
oh,
you know,
and it's one of those things,

547
00:35:13.101 --> 00:35:15.290
it's,
it is,
if you clean something up,

548
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.600
people are much more like if you respect people,

549
00:35:17.601 --> 00:35:21.830
people are much more likely to respect a place or a thing or a person.

550
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:27.080
And the people that were living there,
I mean it was,
you know,
the bed,

551
00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:31.310
the mattress was a bed springs that we're cutting you at night sometimes.

552
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:35.300
So it wasn't like,
of course you were going to like throw a TV out the window,

553
00:35:35.301 --> 00:35:39.170
you know,
was a cycle.
It was a,

554
00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:43.920
that I had real now I had this place now is trying to keep it afloat.

555
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:49.160
I had to have a plan in my plan at 24 rooms with not much money,

556
00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:53.970
wasn't going to work.
And then I started going to banks to see if I could,

557
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.560
you know,
I,
I had gotten through school without even taking a math class,

558
00:35:58.860 --> 00:35:59.221
you know.

559
00:35:59.221 --> 00:36:03.150
And so now suddenly I needed to understand the basics of business or writing a

560
00:36:03.151 --> 00:36:07.470
business plan.
And I couldn't read a spreadsheet.
I didn't,

561
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.190
I couldn't read the financial statement.
I didn't know what,
you know,

562
00:36:11.191 --> 00:36:14.250
all of those small numbers meant.
And suddenly it was,

563
00:36:14.251 --> 00:36:16.290
became really important to learn that skill.

564
00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:18.870
And so I went and audited some classes.

565
00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:23.850
The business school at University of Texas has a great business school and I

566
00:36:23.851 --> 00:36:27.920
took some management and the service industry classes and tried to leave.

567
00:36:27.921 --> 00:36:32.730
Finally worked my way through how to do a business plan.
It was so hard.
You know,

568
00:36:32.731 --> 00:36:35.040
I do,
we do them all the time now and we,
you know,

569
00:36:35.041 --> 00:36:39.110
do studies and we do market studies and you know,
it's,

570
00:36:39.111 --> 00:36:43.890
it's a skill that I rely on as we look at different hotels in different markets

571
00:36:43.891 --> 00:36:48.240
now.
We do it all,
all the time.
And it was such a foreign language to me.

572
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:53.720
So then I finally got through a business plan and I was headed go try to

573
00:36:53.941 --> 00:36:58.941
convince them banks that they should low me a bunch of money to Redo this motel

574
00:36:59.521 --> 00:37:00.510
on South Congress,

575
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:05.870
which at the time you couldn't convince a lot of locals,

576
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.500
even set foot on south congress at night,
much less spend the night down there.

577
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.390
So it was a process.
So what I was,
what happened,
this is a cliffhanger.

578
00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.690
I finally got,

579
00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:24.050
I finally took on some partners that believed a bit and,

580
00:37:24.541 --> 00:37:28.620
and in the idea.
And so that gave me some,

581
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.980
they had some track record,
so they gave me some legitimacy.

582
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.950
How on earth do you convince the f the first person?

583
00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.660
Because banks are banks are saying thanks,
but no thanks.
Yeah.

584
00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:42.120
But people were intrigued those so I could get,
you know,

585
00:37:42.121 --> 00:37:47.121
remember I was a lawyer and so I was just really selling it and there was a

586
00:37:47.461 --> 00:37:51.240
change afoot in Austin.
You could fill it in the air.

587
00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:55.740
People were starting to return to that neighborhood.
Um,
they'd be there.

588
00:37:55.741 --> 00:37:56.574
There was,

589
00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:00.630
it was a time that it was in the mid nineties and there was starting to be some

590
00:38:00.631 --> 00:38:04.270
urban infill downtown.
And so it was right on the edge of,

591
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:08.050
of that being not completely implausible.
Um,

592
00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.910
but it didn't help that I had absolutely zero experience running a business.

593
00:38:11.911 --> 00:38:15.810
I mean,
that's what really got the banks.
They were like,
what?
I'm like,
no,

594
00:38:15.811 --> 00:38:19.380
I can do that.
A promise.
It's not good enough.
My poetry resume.

595
00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:25.560
So,
um,
it took a local bank at the end of the day,

596
00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:30.600
the guy named Eddie Safdie who was at,
um,
it's now prosperity bank.
Um,

597
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:34.230
but it was liberty at the time,
um,
basically to underwrite it.

598
00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:39.190
But it also was remarkably inexpensive.

599
00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:42.250
The work we did,
uh,
in the,

600
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:45.070
in the bigger picture is something that we would never get away with now.

601
00:38:45.071 --> 00:38:47.080
But I was there all day every day.

602
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:52.270
It was a really lucky to have like to the architecture firm out of San Antonio,

603
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:57.300
now also out of Austin to be my partners and believe in the project as well.

604
00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:03.510
So I hate to bother you with just halting the story and jumping into the nitty

605
00:39:04.091 --> 00:39:04.391
gritty,

606
00:39:04.391 --> 00:39:09.130
but these are such important inflection points if you don't get the money

607
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:12.580
extensively,
not good things.
Oh No.
Proceed from there.

608
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:18.620
So we're talking about liberty and then prosperity.
Both good words,
right?

609
00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.360
How do you convince that person?
How did you convince them?

610
00:39:22.361 --> 00:39:26.760
What was the conversation where they're like,
okay,
how does it,

611
00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:30.310
I mean I also applied for an SBA loan and it finally got,

612
00:39:30.311 --> 00:39:33.670
it was partially funded by the SBA,
so that was great.

613
00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:39.040
I have a business partner now that I'm still in business with who is a great guy

614
00:39:39.041 --> 00:39:44.041
and it had a lot of experience in business and his wife had brought him the

615
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.710
proforma for the San Jose.

616
00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:51.790
How did she get it from a friend of a friend?
Basically it got passed around.

617
00:39:51.791 --> 00:39:54.540
Some of you're just,
yeah,
totally.
Just to you guys,

618
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:58.360
let me get these into circulation.
Exactly.
Again,
I didn't know what it was doing,

619
00:39:58.361 --> 00:39:59.194
right.
I didn't know.

620
00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:04.400
So it was just who knows who and she brought it home and wanted to invest and
he,

621
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:08.080
he still has the copy of it because when it,

622
00:40:08.081 --> 00:40:13.081
when it showed that we would get $110 a night in year three or so,

623
00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:16.870
he wrote in the margin of the pro forma.
No Way.

624
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.090
He totally didn't believe,
but

625
00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.940
I don't know how I,
you know,
I'm tenacious and,
um,

626
00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:33.100
I,
I,
I don't know how I finally convinced the bank.
I mean,
again,

627
00:40:33.101 --> 00:40:35.500
they did take a leap.
Um,

628
00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:38.350
I'm sure there was some kind of personal guarantee that I didn't even know what

629
00:40:38.351 --> 00:40:42.220
a personal guarantee was at the time.
I'm not sure it take it,
take my blood.

630
00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:45.430
I mean,
at that point I had thought about selling the San Jose.

631
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:49.060
I probably took two years to really closed,

632
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:51.970
but at 95 we closed in [inaudible] 97

633
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:56.900
to December of [inaudible] 97 just start renovation.

634
00:40:56.901 --> 00:41:00.160
So it had taken all that time.
I quit my lodge,
I'll just,

635
00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:04.030
just to go try to find money to do some kind of renovation.

636
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:08.310
And in the meantime we decided to say just just so I'm clear,

637
00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:13.620
you were doing your law job simultaneous with running the San Jose up to that

638
00:41:14.891 --> 00:41:15.790
point in the beginning.

639
00:41:15.791 --> 00:41:20.620
And then at some point I realized I had to go work on the front desk and I quit

640
00:41:20.621 --> 00:41:24.820
my law job.
Um,
which was crazy too.
You know,

641
00:41:24.821 --> 00:41:28.900
I have to give it,
you know,
my mother's been gone for about five years now,

642
00:41:28.901 --> 00:41:33.840
but I can't believe that they didn't think it was the craziest thing are done.

643
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.020
I mean like making no money.

644
00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:40.640
My father would have pointed out that it was just at the point I became a really

645
00:41:40.641 --> 00:41:44.850
good trial lawyer that I just jumped ship you now.
Which I mean,

646
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:49.460
I guess,
you know,
I don't know,
even in hindsight,

647
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:54.200
I don't know,
but I knew that I had,
I felt compelled in some way.

648
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:58.520
Again,
I'm really dogged and really,
you know,

649
00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:03.020
I'm going to follow it down.
Once I decided that that's what I wanted to do,

650
00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.910
but I got to say there were nights,

651
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:09.470
I don't know why isn't always nights that I laid awake and really thought about

652
00:42:09.471 --> 00:42:10.490
selling the San Jose.

653
00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:13.610
I'm probably two or three times I got really serious about it.
I thought,

654
00:42:13.611 --> 00:42:17.870
there's no way I'm ever going to be able to do this.
It's too hard.

655
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:23.340
And um,
I just somehow powered through.
Why didn't you sell it?

656
00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.140
Who would have bought it?

657
00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:29.970
<v 1>Right.
Good answer.
That is,
it is a fair answer.</v>

658
00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:35.640
So you finally get the money.
You close for renovations.
What do you do?

659
00:42:35.641 --> 00:42:38.820
Is there anything that you did that you no longer do?

660
00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.220
Were there things that you did where you're like,
oh,

661
00:42:41.221 --> 00:42:45.990
that actually became part of my Palette as an artist,

662
00:42:45.991 --> 00:42:46.470
so to speak?

663
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:50.280
<v 2>Yes and no.
Yes and no to both.
I mean there,
there are ways that,</v>

664
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:55.190
um,
it was extremely inefficient.
Um,

665
00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:00.150
nobody would ever let me do what I did then now.
But you know,
it was,
it was,

666
00:43:00.151 --> 00:43:05.070
I was learning on the job.
It was also really low risk.
I mean,
we think about it,

667
00:43:05.071 --> 00:43:06.960
we'd look at in,
in,
in the hotel business,

668
00:43:06.961 --> 00:43:10.770
you look at the price you pay per key when you're talking about selling or

669
00:43:10.771 --> 00:43:15.420
buying a hotel key.
Yeah.
Perky,
perky,
perky per room,
per room.
So is the,

670
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:18.070
the general notion is,
um,

671
00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:22.440
when you're talking about what a hotel is selling for,
what you're into it for,

672
00:43:22.441 --> 00:43:26.160
what you can develop it for,
whether it's a good deal,
um,
you've taught,

673
00:43:26.161 --> 00:43:29.910
you take the total price of the project from the land,

674
00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:33.810
all the soft costs,
all the hard costs,
all the working capital,

675
00:43:33.811 --> 00:43:37.680
everything you have in it to get the doors open,
all the furnitures,
fixtures,

676
00:43:37.681 --> 00:43:40.080
equipment,
put that in a bucket.

677
00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:45.080
And then divided by the number of rooms and that gives you the price per key of

678
00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:50.040
what the hotel costs,
if that makes sense.
It does.
Yeah.

679
00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:54.840
So I,
we were into the San Jose at the day.

680
00:43:54.841 --> 00:43:57.660
We opened the doors for $100,000 per key,

681
00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:02.940
which is super inexpensive.
Um,
if inexpensive,

682
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.350
inexpensive,
got it at the,
at the end of the day.
So it was low risk.
I mean,

683
00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:09.990
and I was on the front lines,
I'm sure.
Again,

684
00:44:09.991 --> 00:44:13.890
I had a personal guarantee and I was there every day working like crazy and lake

685
00:44:13.891 --> 00:44:18.891
Flato though the architecture firms that I've worked with repeatedly since they

686
00:44:20.311 --> 00:44:25.220
were also there every day.
And so again,
okay,

687
00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:30.030
the question was,
are there things that I did then that I've,

688
00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:31.980
I would never do again?

689
00:44:31.981 --> 00:44:35.370
And then are there things that I did then that became part of my Palette?

690
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:41.010
Um,
yes.
And,
and looking back on it,

691
00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:46.100
I think what I did intuitively there is something that we do as an organization

692
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.030
on a regular basis.
Now,
whenever we're looking at a hotel.

693
00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:55.600
And that is to say that,
um,

694
00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:59.900
I was interested in what the neighborhood wanted and needed and something that

695
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:04.620
the place had been there since the 30s in,
in the South Austin neighborhood.

696
00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:10.300
And so I wanted to look around and look at,
um,
the,

697
00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:14.430
the hotels that are most interesting to me are part of a neighborhood or part of

698
00:45:14.431 --> 00:45:17.160
a community.
There's a places when I was growing up,

699
00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:21.240
my granddad who was a rancher didn't have an office.

700
00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:27.020
So he would go to the local hotel and sit in the lobby and do business deals and

701
00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:32.130
you know,
get his shoe boots shined.
I get his haircut.

702
00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:33.690
You could do that in the lobby of a hotel.

703
00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:38.900
It was a place where people met and whether you were from out of town or you

704
00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:42.120
were a local,
often times,
you know,

705
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:47.150
like a real cornerstone of the community or real and important place to meet for

706
00:45:47.521 --> 00:45:52.110
the community.
Um,
so those were the kinds of things that interested me the most.

707
00:45:52.111 --> 00:45:56.070
So it was one of the first things I asked is how do we serve this neighborhood

708
00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:59.130
and South Austin?
And one of,

709
00:45:59.131 --> 00:46:01.710
obviously the first thing is when we were directly across the street from the

710
00:46:01.711 --> 00:46:05.790
continental club.
So what did musicians need?
And because at the time,

711
00:46:05.791 --> 00:46:10.791
musicians where some of our most frequent guests when we were 30 bucks a night,

712
00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:12.840
because you know,

713
00:46:12.841 --> 00:46:17.730
they were coming through town in the van and they were looking for a cheap hotel

714
00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:21.840
and a lot of times they might be wasted enough that they didn't notice how bad

715
00:46:21.841 --> 00:46:24.300
the bad was.
Carpenter,
anything else.

716
00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:27.990
And then we also have people that were spilling out of the continental club

717
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.720
sometimes late at night,
but um,

718
00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:36.310
and that the neighborhood was starting to change and people were starting to buy

719
00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:43.410
homes downtown again or in Travis Science.
Um,

720
00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:48.510
we also started a coffee shop that opened my brother and I did a month before

721
00:46:48.511 --> 00:46:52.980
the San Jose opened.
And that again was a need of the community.

722
00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:56.090
<v 1>So you were looking to fill the need.
That's what drove it.
It wasn't,</v>

723
00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.460
we want to make a coffee shop and it is,
what do people need?

724
00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:02.480
People need to coffee shop,
let's do a coffee shop.
More than that,

725
00:47:02.481 --> 00:47:06.470
we needed a coffee shop.
Ah,
this is a really,

726
00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:08.500
I want to underscore this because it,

727
00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.390
it comes up so frequently in people who ultimately

728
00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:15.050
succeed in some capacity and entrepreneurship is,

729
00:47:15.051 --> 00:47:19.700
it's so often starts with scratching their own itch and at least that way,

730
00:47:19.701 --> 00:47:23.830
you know,
you have a market,
a one,
maybe,
maybe two.

731
00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.410
It's not a complete speculation,
right?
So not to interrupt.

732
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:29.460
<v 2>Nope.
When you think of a,</v>

733
00:47:29.461 --> 00:47:32.670
a pattern language and you think of Christopher Alexander,
um,

734
00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:38.760
if what I was doing intuitively gigantic books,
those on audio can't see it.

735
00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:42.010
It's,
it's big.
You bludgeon a badger with it.
But,

736
00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:45.640
um,
the,

737
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:50.560
what I was doing intuitively was a lot of what,

738
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:55.870
uh,
for those of you who don't know,
Christopher Alexander is a,

739
00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:58.720
is a writer and a thinker,
um,

740
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:03.730
about architecture and about how we build,
um,
and,

741
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:05.530
and more than that.
But for me,

742
00:48:05.531 --> 00:48:07.870
he wrote a book called the timeless way of building,

743
00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:11.800
which I have not written down.
And he wrote a pattern language,

744
00:48:11.801 --> 00:48:16.801
which was basically his idea was looking at all the old villages and towns and

745
00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:22.540
communities that were,
you know,

746
00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:27.070
throughout the world that have been there for centuries.

747
00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:32.370
And his point was that people figured out how to build intuitively more southern

748
00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:35.680
current at the time.
And probably today,

749
00:48:35.681 --> 00:48:40.681
current architects today who are responding to how a thing looks rather than how

750
00:48:41.381 --> 00:48:44.440
it functions.
And he's,
his argument is,

751
00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:48.590
or his thesis is that we know intuitively,
you know,

752
00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:52.160
where to put a fireplace or a hallway or you know,

753
00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:56.790
a hub and spoke model in a small community.
Because if it's,

754
00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:01.800
it's those ways of building that make a place feel more whole and more complete

755
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:08.800
and makes you as a person feel a more whole and complete.

756
00:49:08.801 --> 00:49:13.540
It's sort of,
he calls it,
I think he calls it the quality without a name.
Yes.

757
00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:18.220
I was so cold that the quality without a name.
What does that mean?
Well,
it does,

758
00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:21.550
it referred to,
you know,
those places that you've been to,
that,
uh,

759
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:26.650
buildings you've been in or places you've been in where it just feels right.

760
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:31.450
And it feels,
um,
calming rather than agitating.

761
00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:32.390
It feels,
um,

762
00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:37.090
like you are part of something in an in a bigger sense.

763
00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:39.820
And I think,
you know,
part of that would be,
you know,

764
00:49:39.821 --> 00:49:42.640
today we people design things today.

765
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000
This happens all the time that they've never even been to the place where the

766
00:49:48.131 --> 00:49:53.120
Tuscan village in the suburbs is going to be put.
You know,
like you're,

767
00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:58.360
his argument is that you look around you and you see how things are built,
uh,

768
00:49:58.450 --> 00:50:00.550
in the place you are and you look at,

769
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:05.600
you don't bring a building materials that would never exist in a place.

770
00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.220
Um,
you,

771
00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:13.260
you look at the ways of doing things that have been done for a long time and

772
00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:17.530
that way you become the fabric of the place itself.
Yeah.

773
00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:20.890
This book is so simultaneously intimidating.

774
00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:24.220
It is and fascinating.
I mean,
they just turned a random page,

775
00:50:24.221 --> 00:50:28.130
five 99 activity pockets and there's a diagram with

776
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:29.630
<v 1>the average number of people,</v>

777
00:50:29.631 --> 00:50:33.620
area of a 150 people to 300.
Oh wait,

778
00:50:33.621 --> 00:50:36.530
no p must mean something else.
300 something square feet.

779
00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.910
And it's looking at the placement of umbrellas and what it looks like an Italian

780
00:50:40.911 --> 00:50:45.080
pavilion and there's another section,
yeah.
Pocket of activity,

781
00:50:45.081 --> 00:50:48.410
which bulges into the square with a picture from Italy.

782
00:50:48.411 --> 00:50:51.520
And then there's a separate section.
And I was actually looking at this,
uh,

783
00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:55.850
because I had a cabin construction project not too long ago.

784
00:50:56.510 --> 00:51:01.510
And there's a section on the integration of outside and inside.

785
00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:05.200
<v 2>Right?
Well,
okay.
So I don't think the book actually is,</v>

786
00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:06.820
I think you're reading isn't the right way.

787
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:10.570
Meaning you should not sit down and read that book from cover to count.
My God.

788
00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:15.230
I mean,
it really is something that is,
you know,
he became,
uh,
uh,
he,

789
00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:19.180
and he's still around today,
but he became a software.
Uh,

790
00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:24.880
what would you say it is?
Designer of software is ideas about patterns.

791
00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:29.050
The patterns are,
I think that happens over and over again.

792
00:51:29.051 --> 00:51:30.790
You see in the natural order of things.

793
00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:35.110
So if you're talking about an Italian plaza where the umbrellas are thinking in

794
00:51:35.111 --> 00:51:36.970
your head,
how many times you've seen that?

795
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:41.980
Well there's a reason that there's a reason people on the ground design that

796
00:51:41.981 --> 00:51:45.850
themselves because that's where human activity went to when we were doing no

797
00:51:45.851 --> 00:51:47.740
cosmic cow,
which is

798
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:53.170
<v 1>grab that because El Cosmico has probably been recommended to me by Texans,</v>

799
00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:56.570
uh,
more than any other hotel.

800
00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:00.500
And then they're Austinites who do staycations at some of your places.

801
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:04.820
But let's describe El Cosmico because when,
when I did the introduction,

802
00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:09.710
how did I describe it?
But I think that the community logic concept.

803
00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.730
So what did what,
when you were designing El Cosmico,
I don't mean to interrupt,

804
00:52:13.731 --> 00:52:14.110
but

805
00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:14.980
<v 2>no,
this is quite a ride.</v>

806
00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:20.400
I El Cosmico is it now 21 acres in far west Texas,

807
00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:25.450
which,
uh,
in,
in the city of Marfa town of Marfa,

808
00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:29.980
Marfa is one of the darkest places.
It is also about a mile high,

809
00:52:29.981 --> 00:52:31.150
about as high as Denver.

810
00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:37.140
And it is a more clear nights and clear days than your average place.

811
00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:43.210
So you,
and it's one of the,
there's no real,

812
00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:46.420
um,
the,

813
00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:51.220
there's very little light because it's such a sparse area of the country.

814
00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:54.850
I mean light pollution and,
yeah.
Yeah.
So if you think about it,

815
00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:59.290
there's two main counties out in far west,
Texas,

816
00:52:59.291 --> 00:53:01.730
Brewster and Presidio and I,

817
00:53:01.731 --> 00:53:05.770
there's something like you can fit like 17 Rhode island's into one of those

818
00:53:05.771 --> 00:53:09.700
counties and the,
I forget what the number is,

819
00:53:09.701 --> 00:53:11.860
but the per capita,

820
00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:17.100
the acreage per capita per person that's a redundant but is enormous.

821
00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:21.580
Like you have,
every person has something like four square miles,
you know,

822
00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:24.860
it's just like sparsely populated.
Im not,

823
00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:29.820
not a lot of cloud cover and not a lot of light pollution for that reason.

824
00:53:29.821 --> 00:53:33.840
My understanding is that uh,
astronomers or amateur astronomers,

825
00:53:33.841 --> 00:53:34.870
but with PR,

826
00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:38.010
nearly professional grade equipment or professional equipment traveled from all

827
00:53:38.011 --> 00:53:40.230
over the country to go specifically to Marfa.

828
00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:44.670
That's true for the new moon and things like that.
Yeah,
I mean,
it's incredible.

829
00:53:44.671 --> 00:53:48.270
You can see the Milky Way,
which when I was growing up,
we could,

830
00:53:48.271 --> 00:53:49.650
you could randomly see the Milky Way.

831
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:55.040
And how often do you see it now in places that aren't like Marfa or like Baja

832
00:53:56.371 --> 00:54:00.720
California or you just weed,
there's too much light pollution.

833
00:54:00.721 --> 00:54:02.040
We just don't see that anymore.

834
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:07.430
And you forget what an amazing feeling that is in the order of things to see

835
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:13.680
another galaxy.
So you have 21 acres.
Okay.
So I digress.

836
00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:18.000
There's 21 acres.
We're right on the edge of Marfa.

837
00:54:18.001 --> 00:54:21.380
It's a town of about 2,400 people.
And,
um,

838
00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:26.450
I had done a small motel in Marfa and it's called the Thunderbird.

839
00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:32.430
Um,
and,
and walked away from it.
It was a bad partnership.
Um,
we,

840
00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:36.020
it wasn't going anywhere and I,
but I didn't know that I wanted,

841
00:54:36.021 --> 00:54:38.040
it was interested in Marfa as a community.

842
00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:42.780
Marfa as a community might it get my family ranches in the region.

843
00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.670
I'd moved back from New York.

844
00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:47.340
I really wanted to spend more time in far west Texas.

845
00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:52.850
And Martha was a little bit on fire if you could say that for a community of

846
00:54:52.951 --> 00:54:56.970
2,400 people because Donald Judd,
who is,
um,
you know,

847
00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:01.500
one of the 20th century's most renounced sculptors,

848
00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:03.170
uh,
was,
uh,

849
00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:08.350
had made a home in Marfa and it had become an art Mecca for,

850
00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:11.310
um,
a lot of folks.

851
00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:17.300
See you have this crazy mix of artists and creative people and ranchers and

852
00:55:17.371 --> 00:55:19.310
people that work on the land,
um,

853
00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:24.590
in this beautiful place that for those of you guys who are from overseas might

854
00:55:26.461 --> 00:55:29.370
think of it as the myth of the American West.
When you see those,

855
00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:34.170
when you've seen giant,
are you seeing,
um,
movies,
westerns?

856
00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:37.200
The,
the landscape we're talking about looks a lot like that.

857
00:55:37.201 --> 00:55:41.250
Just stretching on forever and distant clouds.
So,
um,

858
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:42.820
oh Cosmico uh,

859
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:48.230
I bought this pasture basically that was on the edge of town and I wanted to

860
00:55:49.261 --> 00:55:54.180
build a hotel or lodging experience of some sort there.

861
00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:55.950
And uh,

862
00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:59.610
I realized that it needed to be indoors and outdoors because that's one of the

863
00:55:59.611 --> 00:56:02.020
reasons you go out there.
And,
um,

864
00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:07.090
I didn't know exactly what I was going to do again at the time,
but realize that,

865
00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:08.370
uh,
old trailers,

866
00:56:08.371 --> 00:56:12.810
vintage trailers were a great way to get started putting hotels rooms up

867
00:56:12.811 --> 00:56:14.520
quickly.
And so I bought,

868
00:56:15.090 --> 00:56:20.090
I bought a few trailers and we redid them and I started falling in love with

869
00:56:20.911 --> 00:56:25.480
trailers of that,
of the like fifties,
sixties time period.

870
00:56:25.481 --> 00:56:30.481
Because those old Spartans and vagabonds and things like that are made with this

871
00:56:30.611 --> 00:56:35.110
beautiful birch interior.
It was before they were making airstreams with

872
00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:39.970
I,
you know,
I don't even know what the walls of a interior an airstream are,

873
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:45.270
but they trailers of that vintage had these beautiful wooden interiors that mean

874
00:56:46.721 --> 00:56:51.020
you felt like you were in the belly of a ship or in a ship's Gavin.
And they,

875
00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:54.640
we finished him with the yacht varnish at the time.
And so it was this,

876
00:56:54.641 --> 00:56:58.900
it was like we put the first few trailers out there and it was like ships on the

877
00:56:58.901 --> 00:57:00.430
desert,
you know,
and,

878
00:57:00.431 --> 00:57:05.431
and I just fell in love with the whole notion of these,

879
00:57:06.641 --> 00:57:07.750
um,
uh,

880
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:13.050
kind of nomadic ways of living.

881
00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:18.220
And so we got some yurts.
Eventually we got teepees,
we've safari tents,

882
00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:22.840
and it became this grand experiment to see how we would use the land.

883
00:57:22.841 --> 00:57:27.130
So all of these,
all of the rooms were movable.

884
00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:29.680
And so we kind of lived our way into it.

885
00:57:29.681 --> 00:57:32.980
That comes back to Christopher Alexander and a pattern language.

886
00:57:32.981 --> 00:57:37.981
It was really starting to have music festivals and parties there and people

887
00:57:38.951 --> 00:57:43.510
living out there to determine what did the place need and how would people use

888
00:57:43.511 --> 00:57:44.344
it.

889
00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:49.310
<v 1>So we've been talking about the outside inside integration,</v>

890
00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:50.451
uh,

891
00:57:50.451 --> 00:57:55.451
and Christopher Alexander gives some great contrasting photographs for

892
00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:59.300
illustrative purposes.
It seems based on the homework that I've done,

893
00:57:59.301 --> 00:58:03.560
at least that you also think a lot about.

894
00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:08.780
Well,
I'll quote here
and the Internet misquotes a lot.

895
00:58:08.781 --> 00:58:10.880
So you can correct me if I'm wrong,
but here's,

896
00:58:10.881 --> 00:58:13.820
here's the quote and this is part of a longer conversation of course,

897
00:58:13.821 --> 00:58:17.480
but I hate it when I visited a hotel that hasn't put thought into the products

898
00:58:17.481 --> 00:58:18.530
they placed in their room.

899
00:58:18.590 --> 00:58:21.440
It's all part of the language of the place and the details that affect the guest

900
00:58:21.441 --> 00:58:23.660
experience there.
So if we,

901
00:58:23.661 --> 00:58:26.510
if we look at El Cosmico or you could choose a different example,

902
00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:32.210
what are the things that people might notice in inside,

903
00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:34.800
<v 2>inside and outside and outside?
Yeah,</v>

904
00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:37.500
for I think for us at bunk house,

905
00:58:37.501 --> 00:58:42.330
part of it is a whole experience like being at a hotel should be.

906
00:58:42.331 --> 00:58:44.640
And you think of some of your favorite hotels.

907
00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:50.030
It's not that you liked the bedspread or it was close to the highway,

908
00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:52.680
you might have liked both of those things.

909
00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:57.810
But I think probably the places you like the most are the most immersive and

910
00:58:57.811 --> 00:59:00.900
you,
I think of it is storytelling in a way.

911
00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:06.350
So every hotel that we do has everything from a soundtrack to oftentimes a color

912
00:59:08.490 --> 00:59:13.490
or a color scheme that I'm repeats throughout a smell,

913
00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:18.270
an incense.
Usually I get to Saint Cecilia,
we put Nug,

914
00:59:18.271 --> 00:59:21.880
Champa big sticks and knock Chapa and the garden.

915
00:59:21.881 --> 00:59:24.890
So as you're walking through the courtyard,
it's really subtle,

916
00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:29.380
but it's something that strikes your senses and it will remind you of the saint

917
00:59:29.381 --> 00:59:32.780
says of all the smells that you could possibly choose.
Why did you choose that?

918
00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.170
The Saint Cecilia is a small hotel.

919
00:59:36.171 --> 00:59:40.430
We have 'em off further back in the neighborhood office,
South Congress.

920
00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:45.380
And it's very good selection of Tequila also.
I bet.
Um,

921
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:47.120
it's,
it's only 14 rooms,

922
00:59:47.121 --> 00:59:52.121
but it was a main part of the Saint Cecilia is an old Victorian that was built

923
00:59:52.551 --> 00:59:53.750
in the 1890s,

924
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:58.250
and then it has some bungalows that are scattered around about an acre and acre,

925
00:59:58.251 --> 01:00:01.310
half of land.
Um,
and I,

926
01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:05.240
in order for us to do a hotel for me,

927
01:00:05.241 --> 01:00:07.910
there has to be a skeleton,

928
01:00:07.911 --> 01:00:12.230
a story that everything is hung upon or,
uh,

929
01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:16.890
proceeds from.
And so my business partner at the time,
we were looking,
uh,

930
01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:19.360
at the saint,
so that came up for sale.
It wasn't the Saint Celia,

931
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:24.230
it was just no Victorian on an acre of land near downtown Austin.

932
01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.280
And he's like,
what's the story here?
You know,

933
01:00:27.281 --> 01:00:30.830
it's like you had to describe this to somebody.
And for me,

934
01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.420
I mean it was,

935
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:37.690
I always loved that whole period of rock and roll that was about going to really

936
01:00:37.911 --> 01:00:42.710
nice hotels and the super decadence,
not the throwing the TV out the window,

937
01:00:42.711 --> 01:00:45.520
but uh,
you know,
great silver,

938
01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:50.780
slightly tarnished been the white tablecloths from room service and the contrast

939
01:00:50.781 --> 01:00:52.610
of,
you know,
Dylan taking

940
01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:58.970
t somewhere or you know,
drinking a bottle of whiskey,
the stones at nail caught.

941
01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:00.463
Um,

942
01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:05.560
just that there's something so awesome about where elegance kind of meets rock

943
01:01:06.741 --> 01:01:09.790
and roll and said there was this Victorian and it felt like the,

944
01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:14.791
that I'd seen a photograph of like maybe it was a stones somewhere in like full

945
01:01:15.291 --> 01:01:20.110
on 1970s,
um,
awesome,
uh,

946
01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:24.510
you know,
clothing and there was a chauffeur,
you know,

947
01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.720
washing a Bentley in the background kind of thing.

948
01:01:27.090 --> 01:01:30.530
And so this place where those things met immediately became the Saint Cecilia to

949
01:01:30.531 --> 01:01:34.580
me in the saint to say he was a patron saint of music and poetry.

950
01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:40.100
And so if you ask where knocked chomp it comes from,
it's like that,

951
01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:41.900
that smell of knock chomp is the,

952
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
is the hippie smell of that time and inputting it in a place as elegant as the

953
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:50.720
Saint Cecilia makes perfect sense to me.

954
01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:54.130
<v 1>So many questions.</v>

955
01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:01.240
I would think of myself in general as at least an aspiring minimalist when it

956
01:02:01.571 --> 01:02:04.570
comes to certain aspects of design and uh,

957
01:02:05.650 --> 01:02:09.700
certainly have very,
very limited experience compared to someone like yourself,

958
01:02:09.701 --> 01:02:13.150
but have have had projects,

959
01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:16.870
one in San Francisco before I moved to Austin where this place was stripped down

960
01:02:16.871 --> 01:02:21.180
to the studs and it just became an art project and I've spent a lot of time in

961
01:02:21.181 --> 01:02:21.571
Japan.

962
01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:26.220
So it was a sort of a combination of like a green and green Eslan type feel plus

963
01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:31.350
Japanese and a very simple in some respects.

964
01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.740
And I have a particular dislike of,

965
01:02:32.741 --> 01:02:37.080
of clutter I guess even though it's a ongoing battle in my own house,

966
01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:40.020
I think it was your brother who said the following,

967
01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:45.360
and you can correct me if I'm wrong,
but let people be the color in the room.

968
01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:50.370
Could you expand on that or explain what that means?
My brother,

969
01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:55.170
<v 2>Linden.
Um,
some of the best advice ever.
Um,
I think that,</v>

970
01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:59.460
you know,
you're looking at hotels at any point.
I mean,
particularly,
you know,

971
01:02:59.470 --> 01:03:03.270
last 20,
30 years,
I'd look at someplace and I'm not given a bad shout out,

972
01:03:03.271 --> 01:03:04.200
but yeah,

973
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:09.230
the loft or something or that indigo and they think design is fun and whimsical

974
01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:15.040
and that is,
but oh my God,
how do you sleep in a play?

975
01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:16.170
How do you walk through the hallway?

976
01:03:16.171 --> 01:03:19.800
You're just assaulted by so many different patterns in so many different,

977
01:03:19.801 --> 01:03:24.450
like what people think is like cool or hip or you know,
now.

978
01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:29.340
And it's just like a constant onslaught.
Um,

979
01:03:29.341 --> 01:03:34.341
and to me the best hotels or the best places are places that are more calming.

980
01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:38.520
Um,
and so,
um,

981
01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:43.450
doing things through massing or through a pattern where you,
you know,
take,
um,

982
01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:48.240
the language of a place and repeat it and repeat it and repeat it and maybe so

983
01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:50.940
settled that.
Know the people don't really notice.

984
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:53.730
But I think if you give people,

985
01:03:54.210 --> 01:03:57.800
all of our own lives are so cluttered in so many ways,
um,

986
01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:02.640
but if you strip away everything to a certain degree,
um,

987
01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:08.100
and let the people be the color in the room,
it's infinitely more interesting.

988
01:04:08.610 --> 01:04:13.530
I think people feel better about everything that way as well.
You know,

989
01:04:13.531 --> 01:04:15.540
when the San Jose is,

990
01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:20.570
was the first hotel I did and I kind of think of it as a Jew.

991
01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:24.900
Mexico means Japan is is for you guys who don't know.
It's um,

992
01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:30.330
we did a real sort of minimalist,
um,
job on the place at the time.

993
01:04:30.331 --> 01:04:34.920
We just,
we developed a furniture system that would work in,

994
01:04:34.921 --> 01:04:38.220
um,
in the rooms because all the rooms are very different over the years.

995
01:04:38.221 --> 01:04:42.070
They've been cut up in different ways.
So we needed something where we could,
uh,

996
01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:47.340
use something repeatedly through him.
And we ended up using some,

997
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:49.950
uh,
pine loblolly pine,

998
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:54.450
which is a local lish material from east Texas.

999
01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:57.620
And I'm in sort of a Judd lifeway,

1000
01:04:57.690 --> 01:05:00.120
Judd being the Marfa minimalist,

1001
01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:03.470
although I know he would hate the word minimalist,
but,
um,

1002
01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:08.340
which I think Judd is very informed by Schindler and I don't know if,
you know,

1003
01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:13.200
Schindler Schindler is an architect from the 20s that was working in the La
area,

1004
01:05:13.201 --> 01:05:18.201
but a very influential and with a very simplicity.

1005
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:24.370
And so the San Jose has concrete floors,
um,

1006
01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:25.600
where we took out walls,

1007
01:05:25.601 --> 01:05:28.570
we put in an aggregate so you could see where the walls used to be.

1008
01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:34.180
Could you explain what that means?
Yeah.
So when,
when you,
um,
have,
uh,
old,
uh,

1009
01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:39.550
cement or concrete floor,
a lot of times when you remove a wall,

1010
01:05:39.551 --> 01:05:41.050
you'll have a hole in the floor.

1011
01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:46.380
So what we would do is we'd take 'em a concrete mixed with rock and fill it in

1012
01:05:48.371 --> 01:05:51.700
and then,
um,
and then sanded.
So there was,

1013
01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.160
instead of trying to fit in with the existing floor,

1014
01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:58.960
you could actually see the remains of the footprint of the dinosaur.

1015
01:05:59.110 --> 01:06:02.280
Exactly.
And so I'm the San Jose though,

1016
01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:04.840
although it's very simple with just wood and concrete.

1017
01:06:04.841 --> 01:06:09.520
And some people would think of as cold.
Uh,
there's a ton of plantings,

1018
01:06:09.521 --> 01:06:11.650
a ton of gardens.
It's,
has,

1019
01:06:11.651 --> 01:06:16.530
feels really lush and fill the sort of like living indoors and outdoors.
But,
um,

1020
01:06:16.690 --> 01:06:18.670
when we have comment cards and early on,

1021
01:06:18.671 --> 01:06:21.640
I really paid a lot of attention to come at cards and I'm sure the staff does

1022
01:06:21.641 --> 01:06:22.390
now.

1023
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:26.920
But one of my favorite ones that I had up on the wall for a while was somebody

1024
01:06:26.921 --> 01:06:31.120
had written,
this is the most expensive fucking garage I've ever seen.

1025
01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:38.590
So what do you do in response to something like that?
Or do you not,
are you like,

1026
01:06:38.591 --> 01:06:40.600
you know,
not everyone's going to get it.
And that's okay.

1027
01:06:40.790 --> 01:06:43.510
And it's really hard at first because not everyone was going to get it.

1028
01:06:43.511 --> 01:06:47.500
And you have to decide if you want to please everybody or if you just keep doing

1029
01:06:47.501 --> 01:06:52.501
what you're doing and know that intuitively there's something that you will find

1030
01:06:52.871 --> 01:06:55.000
your audience.
Um,
and again,

1031
01:06:55.001 --> 01:06:59.950
I was very lucky in life to be in the right place at the right time because

1032
01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:04.170
Austin was changing.
And when we first opened the San Jose,
no,

1033
01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:08.650
just to not discount your skillset completely.
I mean,

1034
01:07:08.651 --> 01:07:12.910
you're in the right place at the right time,
but you've also now,
how many,

1035
01:07:12.970 --> 01:07:17.470
how many properties do you have?
Um,
maybe eight,
I think.
Yeah.

1036
01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:22.360
So I mean,
once you're lucky twice,
you're good.
Eight times.
Okay.
Yeah.

1037
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:26.230
Okay.
So,
but you know,
but at that time with the first project,

1038
01:07:26.231 --> 01:07:29.590
you don't know what you don't know and you don't know.

1039
01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:33.340
I have a lot more confidence now.
Right.
I mean,
I had confidence then,

1040
01:07:33.341 --> 01:07:38.110
but not necessarily as a designer.
Um,
but I remember when we first opened,

1041
01:07:38.111 --> 01:07:42.330
we opened,
we opened in March,
which is,
um,
uh,

1042
01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:46.360
spring break,
but it's also south by southwest,
which is a huge conference.

1043
01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.820
You used to be more music centric,

1044
01:07:48.821 --> 01:07:53.821
but now it's tech and film and a lot of people descend on Austin.

1045
01:07:55.211 --> 01:07:58.090
There's not,
yeah,
it's gotta be,
I don't know the exact size now,

1046
01:07:58.091 --> 01:07:59.930
but it's gotta be 50 to a hundred thousand.
Yeah.

1047
01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:04.330
So there's not a hotel room in town.
Well,
we sort of did a soft opening,

1048
01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:07.870
which is crazy,
but uh,
what does that mean?
Soft happening?

1049
01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:12.870
That's where you invite people to that that might be friendly towards you or at

1050
01:08:12.941 --> 01:08:17.330
a very discounted price to a property or a restaurant.
And let,

1051
01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:22.040
let the staff practice on you knowing there's going to be some mistakes.
Um,

1052
01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:26.660
so opening during south by,
right before,
it was like February 14th,

1053
01:08:26.661 --> 01:08:29.810
and I remember February 14th was the first day that we had,

1054
01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:30.681
so it was Valentine's.

1055
01:08:30.681 --> 01:08:35.681
They had anybody that actually spent the night in the hotel and I put a banner

1056
01:08:36.171 --> 01:08:41.171
outside that we sold rooms for $69 for Valentine's Day.

1057
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:44.270
And so that was the special,

1058
01:08:44.271 --> 01:08:47.960
and I mean like trying to just get people in the doors was,
uh,

1059
01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:50.890
was the whole point we opened,
you're in southwest.

1060
01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:55.940
Southwest totally sold out crazy because of course we had something in the,

1061
01:08:57.290 --> 01:08:59.380
something was in the,
uh,

1062
01:08:59.810 --> 01:09:02.780
waste pipe that was going to the street,

1063
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:05.960
like an electrical fixture have fallen down into it.

1064
01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:08.870
So entire wing of the hotel flooded with sewage.

1065
01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:13.240
You'd have people who running out of the hotel with their standup bass or you

1066
01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:17.580
know,
whatever.
And there was no place to put them.
But
all right,

1067
01:09:17.581 --> 01:09:20.750
so it's in the middle of the south by complete chaos.

1068
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:25.220
Everything is stretched to Max capacity.
Yeah.
I,

1069
01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:28.760
I'm sure that stress is running high for a lot of people who've flown in to

1070
01:09:28.761 --> 01:09:32.330
perform or whatever.
So you have sewage flooding,
half a hotel.

1071
01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:35.110
How do you handle that?
I don't know.
I mean,
you know,
you,

1072
01:09:35.111 --> 01:09:38.210
you have to pay on the front lines of it and putting rubber boots and the whole

1073
01:09:38.211 --> 01:09:42.800
thing.
And again,
really,
you know,
I don't know.
It's,

1074
01:09:42.801 --> 01:09:46.370
it's hospitality.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe usually people don't know this,

1075
01:09:46.371 --> 01:09:47.540
but behind the scenes we,

1076
01:09:47.541 --> 01:09:52.541
you a lot of places overbook knowing cause they're counting on cancellations.

1077
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:57.910
Airlines.
Yeah,
exactly.
And so hotels,
you know,

1078
01:09:57.950 --> 01:10:02.000
the hospitality business is really interesting because hotels really are behind

1079
01:10:02.001 --> 01:10:06.200
the scenes,
usually most likely want to be friends with each other.
You know,

1080
01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:09.890
you can say it's competition,
but you're sharing information all the time.

1081
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:13.830
Yield management and what's going on in town.
And,
um,

1082
01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:17.690
you just so you know,
a rising tide raises all boats to a certain degree,

1083
01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:22.580
but you're also going to have to walk somebody sooner or later to another hotel,

1084
01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:24.320
which means that you're going to,

1085
01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:27.650
you're going to pay for their room somewhere else because you've either

1086
01:10:27.651 --> 01:10:30.950
overbooked or mistake or had sewage flooding the room.

1087
01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:34.700
But there was no hotels to walk anybody to,
I don't know how we manage it.

1088
01:10:34.710 --> 01:10:37.160
Just put it out in my mind.
Now you've blocked it,

1089
01:10:37.161 --> 01:10:41.060
but if you try to unblock it though,
is there any,
what you say?

1090
01:10:41.061 --> 01:10:43.940
Did you get them to stay?
They're not sleeping on the street presumably.

1091
01:10:43.941 --> 01:10:45.170
So I think we did get them to stay.

1092
01:10:45.171 --> 01:10:50.171
I think that we went in and cleaned like crazy and disinfected like crazy and

1093
01:10:50.991 --> 01:10:55.100
remade the rooms all hands on deck completely.
You comp the room.

1094
01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:56.900
Yeah,
totally.

1095
01:10:58.250 --> 01:11:02.870
You know they say in the service industry a good recovery is going to make a

1096
01:11:02.871 --> 01:11:03.704
bigger,

1097
01:11:04.190 --> 01:11:08.570
more loyal guests then if you hadn't fucked up at all.

1098
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:10.040
And that's true.
Yeah,
very true.

1099
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:13.920
Because you'll tell 10 people if somebody really makes something.
Right,
right.

1100
01:11:13.921 --> 01:11:14.040
Well,

1101
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:17.370
<v 1>I mean that because everybody's all smiles and high fives when everything is</v>

1102
01:11:17.371 --> 01:11:19.210
going smoothly.
And it's like how,

1103
01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:23.970
how do they handle things and do they own the problem when things go sideways on

1104
01:11:23.971 --> 01:11:26.390
their watch?
Kind of hard not to.
And that one must understand that.

1105
01:11:26.391 --> 01:11:31.060
It's hard not to own that one.
How dare you flood your own room with sewage.
Uh,

1106
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.900
chip Conley.

1107
01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:39.120
Chip Conley is someone we both know.
If chip,

1108
01:11:39.121 --> 01:11:42.300
if you're,
if you're listening or so many passes this along,
miss you,

1109
01:11:42.301 --> 01:11:45.960
we'd love to see you.
It's been a long time since I've spent time with chip.
But,

1110
01:11:45.961 --> 01:11:50.100
um,
I've heard you describe him as a mentor.
I don't know if that,
if you,

1111
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:53.550
if or haven't heard you,
I've read it,
so who knows if it's accurate.

1112
01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:58.650
But could you describe for folks who don't know the name,
who is chipped and,

1113
01:11:58.651 --> 01:11:59.520
uh,
what,

1114
01:11:59.521 --> 01:12:04.280
what have you learned or gleaned or observed from ship?
Huh.

1115
01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:08.750
So much over the years.
Um,
chip isn't mentors to,

1116
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:13.080
to this day I signed last week.
Um,
for those of you guys who don't know,
chip,
uh,

1117
01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:17.790
started a hotel company called you out of Eve that was based in San Francisco.

1118
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:22.140
Um,
and he started when he was fresh out of business,

1119
01:12:22.141 --> 01:12:26.580
go probably early twenties.
The Phoenix was his first hotel,

1120
01:12:26.581 --> 01:12:31.550
which was a motor court,
not unlike the San Jose or the Austin Motel.
Um,

1121
01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:36.740
and was a favorite of bands on tour musicians,

1122
01:12:37.051 --> 01:12:37.884
that kind of thing.

1123
01:12:37.950 --> 01:12:42.950
Chip continued to grow a very successful hotel company and decided at some point

1124
01:12:44.670 --> 01:12:49.300
in is around 50 or so.
I don't know how it was.
Chip when he sold draw to vive.

1125
01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:53.190
It might've been,
might've been right afterwards.
I remember I was at chips.

1126
01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:57.990
We didn't talk about this burning man camp.
Oh,
no kidding.
All right.

1127
01:12:57.991 --> 01:12:59.870
So was it Maslow?
Topia yeah,

1128
01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:03.950
so that's the only time I've ever been to burning man is really funny.

1129
01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:08.920
One of the yurts that was,
um,
you know,
the fold up.
Of course I did.
Uh,

1130
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:10.230
that's wild.
All right.

1131
01:13:10.231 --> 01:13:13.440
So we were at the same camp at burning man and just didn't bump into each other.

1132
01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:17.580
Uh,
or maybe we did at the,
who knows,
like the catered ship food,

1133
01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:21.330
which by the way,
I mean it was such a conscious,
my first experience,

1134
01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.740
not digress too far,

1135
01:13:22.741 --> 01:13:27.300
but my first experience of burning man was trying to build a geodesic dome with

1136
01:13:27.301 --> 01:13:31.620
my friend on the spot that we had put together based on Internet instructions

1137
01:13:31.710 --> 01:13:36.240
when I was in San Francisco.
And then realizing none of it would fit together.

1138
01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:41.870
We ran out of water,
the,
our view we had broken down to the air conditioning.

1139
01:13:41.890 --> 01:13:45.330
Didn't worry,
it was just,
it was absolute survival mode.
And then,

1140
01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:49.110
and then I came to two chips and I was like,
oh my God,

1141
01:13:49.111 --> 01:13:53.760
this is like the four seasons of the salt.
I mean like he really,

1142
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:58.200
he did the whole camp with some friends and basically you could get food at any

1143
01:13:58.201 --> 01:14:03.120
point you wanted.
There was a full service bar.
I had an air conditioner,
you know,

1144
01:14:03.121 --> 01:14:07.520
it was only like six feet across and it was made out of uh,

1145
01:14:07.620 --> 01:14:12.280
some kind of building.
It was like fold up it,
the whole thing folded up into

1146
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:16.840
<v 2>a very small package.
But it wasn't a bad way.
I kind of in and out.
Yeah.</v>

1147
01:14:16.841 --> 01:14:20.210
That's so wild.
I can't,
we were there at the same time,
so,
so he sold,

1148
01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:23.440
he sold around here.
Yeah.
So was right to leave.

1149
01:14:23.530 --> 01:14:28.060
He's still a very young man by the way,
if you're listening chip and um,
he,

1150
01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:32.770
the guys from airbnb tapped him on the shoulder and said come help us a little

1151
01:14:32.771 --> 01:14:37.771
bit and what was helping in an advisory role for a while he became the head of

1152
01:14:39.011 --> 01:14:40.780
global hospitality for Airbnb.

1153
01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:45.160
And along the way he's written a lot of great business books that um,

1154
01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:50.230
we often have our managers read and like peak.
Um,
and uh,

1155
01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:54.610
the,
uh,
the emotional equation.

1156
01:14:54.611 --> 01:14:57.880
What is that book called yet?
You don't,
well,
I'll,
I'll,
if people,

1157
01:14:57.910 --> 01:15:01.300
I'm blanking on the title,
but I will tell people that,
uh,
chips,

1158
01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:06.250
chips been on the blog on my blog a few times and if you search how to become an

1159
01:15:06.251 --> 01:15:09.110
effective CEO,
chief emotions officers

1160
01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:13.120
and my name or just search Tim Ferriss,

1161
01:15:13.121 --> 01:15:16.390
chip Conley and that'll pop right up with that book.
Right.

1162
01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:19.210
Chip has written many books and he is,
uh,

1163
01:15:19.230 --> 01:15:24.230
often has done a ted talk and is often a lecture on business and just on being a

1164
01:15:24.881 --> 01:15:28.260
more complete person.
And so,
uh,

1165
01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:32.800
chip continued throughout.
So the way I met chip is I cold called him.

1166
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:35.950
I bought the San Jose,
didn't know what I was doing,

1167
01:15:36.190 --> 01:15:40.150
had no idea of what it was going to do and I saw his name like in a trade

1168
01:15:40.151 --> 01:15:43.030
magazine.
And so I called him up unbelievably.

1169
01:15:43.031 --> 01:15:46.450
He called me back and about 30 minutes.
Do you live voicemail?

1170
01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:49.670
I think I did.
I don't remember exact.
Yeah,

1171
01:15:49.671 --> 01:15:52.810
I think I did leave a voice and I how I got his number.
What would you have said?

1172
01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:58.170
I have this motel and South Austin and I just wanted to talk to you about it

1173
01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:03.040
quick or something like that.
But of course empl yeah,
of course.

1174
01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:07.370
I think he thought I wanted to see if he wanted to consider buying it.
Um,

1175
01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:10.870
but the fact that he called me back was,

1176
01:16:10.930 --> 01:16:13.930
I have cursed him for,
from this,

1177
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:18.830
from that day to this day,
because now people constantly,
you know,

1178
01:16:18.850 --> 01:16:23.850
now they email me or some way ask if I could spend a few minutes and for advice

1179
01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.500
and you know,
that just aren't the hours in the day,

1180
01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:30.010
but he just pops up in my brain every time.
Like,

1181
01:16:30.011 --> 01:16:33.850
what would have happened had he not called back,
you know,
and I don't know.
But,

1182
01:16:33.851 --> 01:16:36.600
um,
over the years he was one of the first guests at San Jose.

1183
01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:37.990
He was passing through

1184
01:16:39.530 --> 01:16:43.600
and he came to see it after giving advise.
I,
I went and met him in San Francisco.

1185
01:16:43.601 --> 01:16:45.220
He looked at my numbers,
did,

1186
01:16:45.221 --> 01:16:47.890
I didn't really understand and tried to make sense of them,

1187
01:16:47.891 --> 01:16:50.660
but I could've had that conversation.

1188
01:16:50.710 --> 01:16:54.270
I could have that conversation now much better.
Um,
and then,
uh,

1189
01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:59.480
most recently we have a hotel in Baja,
California,
uh,

1190
01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:03.310
in a little town called Todos Santos right outside a little town called todos.

1191
01:17:03.311 --> 01:17:06.700
Santos dead is about 45 minutes from Cabo.

1192
01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:10.280
And he's the one that got me that because,
um,

1193
01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:13.850
he had sold his hotel company and a was not,

1194
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:16.910
I don't know if I had a noncompete or just not supposed to be in the business

1195
01:17:16.911 --> 01:17:21.020
and he was very interested in the community and so he kind of pointed them in my

1196
01:17:21.021 --> 01:17:21.854
direction.

1197
01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:27.100
And now we have a really great hotel there and chip lives part of his life and

1198
01:17:27.670 --> 01:17:28.580
10 desantos.
Now,

1199
01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:29.790
<v 1>what,</v>

1200
01:17:29.790 --> 01:17:34.790
what other best practices or principles or do nots or dues have you picked up

1201
01:17:37.201 --> 01:17:39.270
from,
from chip or,
or other people?

1202
01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:44.720
<v 2>Um,
actually I or had our president now at bunk counts.</v>

1203
01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:49.550
I worked for chip for 10 years,
got named Christian struggle and um,

1204
01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:54.000
you know,
it's good.
Here's the thing,

1205
01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:58.970
you can be as creative as you want to be in dream as big as you want and create

1206
01:17:59.090 --> 01:18:04.090
an incredible experience and programming and everything along those lines.

1207
01:18:04.371 --> 01:18:06.020
But if you don't,
can't keep the lights on.

1208
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:08.510
If you can't return money to investors,

1209
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:12.850
if you can't keep your employees happy,
um,

1210
01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:16.280
then you're never going to have a successful business.

1211
01:18:16.281 --> 01:18:19.190
I mean you've got to keep the lights on,
you know,

1212
01:18:19.191 --> 01:18:22.250
and you've got to do a little better than keeping the lights on.
But,
um,

1213
01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:28.360
I think a lot of people fell in business because they don't have operational

1214
01:18:29.511 --> 01:18:32.420
rigor and that can be a lot of different,

1215
01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:36.010
that can manifest in a lot of different ways.
But,
um,

1216
01:18:36.410 --> 01:18:39.310
I think that chip was,
uh,

1217
01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:44.240
influential from early on about,
uh,
operations and,

1218
01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:48.410
and how important not just your guest was,

1219
01:18:48.411 --> 01:18:51.230
but your employee and your investor as well.

1220
01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:53.533
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1221
01:18:54.090 --> 01:18:57.920
<v 1>The chip is up and peak.</v>

1222
01:18:57.921 --> 01:19:02.250
You mean as it relates to Maslow,
uh,
muscles hurt,

1223
01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:07.280
hierarchy of needs and hence mess utopia as the name of the burning man camp,

1224
01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:11.640
uh,
is something that he would apply also to these various stakeholders.

1225
01:19:12.570 --> 01:19:16.060
Uh,
so another mutual acquaintance,

1226
01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:21.010
Larry McGuire of Mcguire,
Mormon group here,
many different restaurants.

1227
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:24.760
Uh,
I texted Larry to ask him,

1228
01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:29.020
we know what topics or questions might I want to explore with Liz.
And he said,

1229
01:19:29.021 --> 01:19:30.740
oh,
well,
there's so many things you could explore that data.

1230
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:35.350
But one of the things he brought up was the question,
how do you balance,

1231
01:19:36.130 --> 01:19:39.120
and I'm paraphrasing here,
but it's not that far off.
Uh,

1232
01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:44.160
how do you balance wanting the desire to be an artist with the desire to be,

1233
01:19:44.921 --> 01:19:45.970
say,
a business tycoon?

1234
01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:48.780
<v 2>Right.
It's really interesting question.</v>

1235
01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:54.080
I mean,
it's such a balance.
I mean it is,
uh,

1236
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:57.870
Larry is actually very good at what he does.
I,

1237
01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:01.060
Larry has several restaurants here in town and um,

1238
01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:05.600
I've known Larry since he was about 16 and started work for my brother.
Um,

1239
01:20:05.890 --> 01:20:08.860
but Larry is of those rare people that,
um,

1240
01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:12.780
understands both,
um,
again,

1241
01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:14.640
rigor and operations,

1242
01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:19.920
which is going to be really important at the end of the day for somebody to have

1243
01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:24.840
the right experience and the artistry of creating an experience.

1244
01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:28.920
Um,
to me,

1245
01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:32.280
if you don't like people make hotels,

1246
01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:34.680
people design hotels and then they walk away.

1247
01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:40.460
And so that is always going to get diluted over time.

1248
01:20:41.461 --> 01:20:41.870
If,

1249
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:46.770
if you don't remain involved in the experience or what your vision was in the

1250
01:20:46.771 --> 01:20:50.920
first place,
then what you created is,

1251
01:20:50.921 --> 01:20:53.400
it's not just an object,
it's a living,

1252
01:20:53.401 --> 01:20:56.940
breathing thing that has employees,
people that work there,

1253
01:20:56.941 --> 01:20:58.140
that spend their lives there.

1254
01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:03.120
It has guests that come and go as part of a ever evolving community.

1255
01:21:03.690 --> 01:21:07.980
And it has people that have part of the ownership and in the in the place.

1256
01:21:07.981 --> 01:21:12.981
So I think your vision is not complete if you just create something and walk

1257
01:21:13.501 --> 01:21:14.334
away.

1258
01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:14.870
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1259
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:18.040
<v 2>It is and other and other,
uh,</v>

1260
01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:23.110
John Roas of art.
But in a hotel or in a restaurant,

1261
01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:26.740
it begins a new every day in a way.
And so

1262
01:21:29.190 --> 01:21:34.190
to create a guest experience that is right for that hotel takes,

1263
01:21:36.001 --> 01:21:40.170
um,
you know,
constant vigilance in a way and um,

1264
01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:43.260
and then is always going to translate to the bottom line.
I mean,

1265
01:21:43.590 --> 01:21:46.560
we don't mark it most of our hotels in a certain way,

1266
01:21:46.561 --> 01:21:51.350
but people aren't going to him.
For us.
Instagram is obviously great and um,

1267
01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.970
so are a lot of other social media platforms,

1268
01:21:53.971 --> 01:21:58.860
but we get a fair amount of print as well.
And that comes a lot,

1269
01:21:58.861 --> 01:22:03.000
not from us necessarily pitching stories but for people becoming real believers

1270
01:22:03.150 --> 01:22:03.983
in what we do.

1271
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:09.470
And so I don't know if I'm really answering that question except to say it's a,

1272
01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:12.420
you have to have both things,

1273
01:22:12.421 --> 01:22:16.320
whether it's you doing it or someone else that believes in your vision and you

1274
01:22:16.321 --> 01:22:17.220
believe in,
there's,

1275
01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:22.640
you've got to have both the artistry and the beginning and the good practice to

1276
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:29.370
continue in good business practice to continually,
uh,

1277
01:22:29.610 --> 01:22:30.443
tend the fire.

1278
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:35.990
Do you have an idea of if you're going to be continuing to develop hotels and

1279
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:42.570
put your craft
into the world in that way?

1280
01:22:43.290 --> 01:22:47.970
Do you have an idea for say how many properties you'd like to have in five
years?

1281
01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:52.460
Uh,
if you want to scale on a scale,
three years doesn't really matter.

1282
01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:55.620
I'm just wondering if you have some nice,

1283
01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:59.370
it's such a crossroads right now really about this.
Um,
you,
you know,

1284
01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:04.350
the pressure in business and the bigger your business gets is to grow,
grow,

1285
01:23:04.351 --> 01:23:09.290
grow,
and then sell it.
Right?
Dance seems to be,
you know,
I wonder if we'll look,

1286
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:13.870
we'll be 30 years from now,
that won't be the thing.
Or if it was,
it wasn't,

1287
01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:15.130
you know,
50 years ago.

1288
01:23:15.550 --> 01:23:20.550
We live in a time where it's about growth and making your business worth as much

1289
01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:25.450
as you possibly can and then selling it.
And to me,
that's,

1290
01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:29.800
it makes no sense in the world to me because I'm a bit of a,

1291
01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:34.150
the journey is the destination kind of person.
And so if I'm,

1292
01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:36.760
I think that I'm both doing,

1293
01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:40.780
if I grow it at an enormously rapid pace about push,

1294
01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:45.040
not only myself,
but my team to grow as fast as possible,

1295
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:49.810
we're not going to do the quality of work that we want to do.
Um,

1296
01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:54.670
and while we might have a higher value in five years as a company,

1297
01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:58.290
I don't think that the end game is to sell.
I,

1298
01:23:58.350 --> 01:24:00.700
and Larry McGuire I think,

1299
01:24:00.701 --> 01:24:03.640
believes the same thing I do in a lot of people that I look around dad and I'm

1300
01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:08.880
interested in their careers and their lives also are people that are interested

1301
01:24:10.661 --> 01:24:15.130
in what they do from now and from the people they work with day to day.

1302
01:24:16.210 --> 01:24:19.030
And I'm creating an asset,

1303
01:24:19.150 --> 01:24:23.920
like a hotel that can just get better over time rather than,

1304
01:24:23.921 --> 01:24:24.221
so you know,

1305
01:24:24.221 --> 01:24:28.300
we live in a time where you have hotels that they're ridden every seven years,

1306
01:24:28.301 --> 01:24:32.530
every five years there's a big,
you know,
big repositioning or whatever.

1307
01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:35.410
He's the most interesting places to me.

1308
01:24:35.650 --> 01:24:40.000
Just get better as time goes on and layer upon layer to texture upon texture.

1309
01:24:40.001 --> 01:24:43.600
Yeah.
Better not by reinventing themselves every seven years.
Exactly.

1310
01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:48.840
Was the second title.
Not a pattern language.
Thomas way of building timeless way.

1311
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:51.460
But yeah.
So,
you know,

1312
01:24:51.461 --> 01:24:55.420
can you have a good life and make your [inaudible] have,
uh,

1313
01:24:55.540 --> 01:25:00.540
employees who are invested in that business and ha and also keep an asset,

1314
01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:07.120
uh,
and have it,
you know,

1315
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:11.730
this,
I'm going to digress for a second,
but the hotel businesses,

1316
01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:15.940
we know it today is,
um,
as a result of a lot of things,

1317
01:25:15.941 --> 01:25:20.110
but we've come to a time where most hotels are not owned by the management

1318
01:25:20.111 --> 01:25:20.944
company.

1319
01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:25.570
So you have a group of owners and you have a management company that is a brand.

1320
01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:30.900
So from the four seasons to the Hilton to you name a Demariac what,

1321
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:37.000
whatever it is,
um,
or even ace,

1322
01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:40.060
those guys over there,
great friends of mine,
every ace,

1323
01:25:40.061 --> 01:25:44.500
you look at his owned by different ownership group and uh,

1324
01:25:44.770 --> 01:25:47.440
you know,
you can talk all day long about why that is.

1325
01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:51.880
A lot of times the management company wants to say stay asset light because the

1326
01:25:51.881 --> 01:25:56.170
hotel business is,
uh,
you know,
in,
in waves.

1327
01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:01.050
So you don't want to get caught in a downturn owning a property centric,

1328
01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:06.390
mitigate your risk by growing a brand.
Um,
and that is,
um,

1329
01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:11.620
that easier or much easier when you are a Marriott and you're going to be the

1330
01:26:12.141 --> 01:26:15.210
same everywhere.
And you have in,
there was,

1331
01:26:15.310 --> 01:26:17.060
there was a time in the hotel business that,

1332
01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:21.770
or a time in hotels and those of us as consumers of hotels wanted that because

1333
01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:24.370
before that you could,
you know,

1334
01:26:24.630 --> 01:26:29.630
take a trip across country and all these hotels were independent and God knows

1335
01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:32.870
what you might find or might be delightful or it might be horrible.

1336
01:26:32.871 --> 01:26:36.050
And there was no way of judging the quality of a place.

1337
01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:41.600
And then we got Hilton's and holiday inns.
And what was great is that you could,

1338
01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:46.280
you knew what to expect and you knew the level of service for a cup of
Starbucks.

1339
01:26:46.281 --> 01:26:49.760
It's the same everywhere you go.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And we,
and so you,

1340
01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:54.350
you can depend on that.
I,
I'd read something from,
I was,
I was,
look,

1341
01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:58.400
the other day I was looking at some stuff about Hawaiian musicians in hotels.

1342
01:26:58.401 --> 01:26:58.611
You know,

1343
01:26:58.611 --> 01:27:02.030
why that loves story and they're interdependent in one way or the other.

1344
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:03.920
And somebody was saying,
I don't remember,

1345
01:27:03.921 --> 01:27:07.670
it was probably Keith Moon or somebody who is well known for just totally

1346
01:27:07.671 --> 01:27:10.970
trashing hotel rooms.
It's like,
yeah,
it's the fifth.

1347
01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:14.180
This is the of the 20th fucking Holiday Inn.
You know,

1348
01:27:14.181 --> 01:27:17.360
we've woken up in and just as many days and they all look the same.

1349
01:27:17.361 --> 01:27:21.830
Anybody would be mad at it.
But,

1350
01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:22.520
uh,

1351
01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:27.410
that time is that time began to change with what we think of as a boutique hotel

1352
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:32.150
or a lifestyle hotel from Schrager to chip Connolly.
You know,

1353
01:27:32.151 --> 01:27:37.010
I think you asked me about what are the next three,

1354
01:27:37.011 --> 01:27:38.840
five years holds?

1355
01:27:38.841 --> 01:27:42.870
What's my plan business wise or hotel growth wise.

1356
01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:44.780
Um,
and it's,

1357
01:27:44.781 --> 01:27:48.950
I feel like I'm at such a crossroads there and trying to determine what's,

1358
01:27:49.150 --> 01:27:52.640
it's not only what's best for me,
it's also what's best for the company,

1359
01:27:52.641 --> 01:27:55.010
but also the people I work with every day.

1360
01:27:55.400 --> 01:28:00.400
And so you want to grow because you want to be able to give the people you work

1361
01:28:02.781 --> 01:28:04.460
with more equity,
um,

1362
01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:10.040
more chance for more of a chance for um,
you know,

1363
01:28:11.150 --> 01:28:14.270
higher fulfillment moving into other jobs,

1364
01:28:14.630 --> 01:28:17.840
just all those things you want to come there.
I think that we have a natural,

1365
01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:20.600
a natural propensity toward growth.

1366
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:24.680
But then the question becomes how fast and how much and what's,

1367
01:28:24.710 --> 01:28:29.350
what is the end game there?
And in this business,
I think in,

1368
01:28:29.351 --> 01:28:33.830
in this day and age,
people just mindlessly want to grow and explode.

1369
01:28:33.831 --> 01:28:38.420
The bigger you are,
the better you are,
the more people know about you,
the better.

1370
01:28:38.421 --> 01:28:43.421
But I think that a lot of the qualities that you appreciate appreciate it in day

1371
01:28:44.511 --> 01:28:46.160
to day living become lost.

1372
01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:51.620
And I think one of the reasons we're successful as a company internally at least

1373
01:28:51.621 --> 01:28:53.750
is because we are like a family in some ways.

1374
01:28:53.751 --> 01:28:57.980
And so how much can you maintain that as well?

1375
01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:02.820
I guess the answer is I don't want to mindlessly grow.

1376
01:29:02.821 --> 01:29:04.080
I want to thoughtfully grow.

1377
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:09.350
And that may not be at the pace that a lot of companies would want you to grow.

1378
01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:14.100
And it's also about the in game.

1379
01:29:14.130 --> 01:29:17.940
And I don't think my end game would be to grow really fast and to sell the

1380
01:29:17.941 --> 01:29:21.450
business,
which is you find a lot of brands want to do now.

1381
01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:25.070
<v 1>Well,
it sounds also to me,
just based on what you've been saying,</v>

1382
01:29:25.071 --> 01:29:30.071
that your of Philosophical Lens through which you view your life,

1383
01:29:30.591 --> 01:29:33.170
which is the journey is the destination,

1384
01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:38.680
is a fundamental juxtaposition with what a lot of external pressures would want

1385
01:29:40.731 --> 01:29:43.970
to impose on the business.
Absolutely.
It's so tricky.

1386
01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:47.910
<v 2>No,
it's,
it's such a balances and,
and it's a struggle in a way.
Um,</v>

1387
01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:52.750
it is,
but,
you know,
some of it,
they're,

1388
01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:57.650
they're outside pressures are inside pressures.
Um,
but,
uh,
it,

1389
01:29:57.770 --> 01:30:01.190
it's a really good question because I'm in the middle of it right now and I have

1390
01:30:01.191 --> 01:30:03.680
lots of thoughts about it,
but it could go on and on and on.

1391
01:30:03.681 --> 01:30:08.660
But I do know that I could get hit by a bus tomorrow,
you know,
and,
uh,

1392
01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:09.590
and we all could.

1393
01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:14.630
And you're not going to care about that IPO,

1394
01:30:14.970 --> 01:30:17.660
you know,
five years from now.
Um,

1395
01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:21.810
my wife is pregnant and gonna have I,

1396
01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:26.690
I'm older and she's young enough to be pregnant clearly.
And,

1397
01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:31.670
um,
and that's a whole other life change also,

1398
01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:34.220
again,
when you see,
you know,

1399
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:39.080
I do really am a big believer and the realization mortality,
I mean,

1400
01:30:39.081 --> 01:30:43.290
all those things really point me in the direction of,
uh,

1401
01:30:44.090 --> 01:30:48.890
living a quality life with,
in relationship to other people.

1402
01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:52.580
And in those ways,
I think it's,

1403
01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:57.700
you find meaning much more in a much more real manner,

1404
01:30:58.881 --> 01:31:00.800
then you find meaning in making a lot of money.

1405
01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:06.520
<v 1>I agree.
I mean,
money's supposed to be fuel,
uh,
in a,</v>

1406
01:31:06.521 --> 01:31:10.300
in a sense for transferring it,

1407
01:31:10.301 --> 01:31:14.770
transmuting that into other things like experiences and so on,

1408
01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:17.380
ostensibly,
right.
I mean,
it's a money as a representation of it.

1409
01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:17.760
<v 2>That's it.</v>

1410
01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:21.810
I'm not against money and it's super important for a business and it's super

1411
01:31:21.811 --> 01:31:24.870
important for the people you work with and for,
and all those things.

1412
01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:29.550
It's just the means to the end,
you know?
No,
it is.
I mean,
if we look at,

1413
01:31:30.530 --> 01:31:31.363
uh,

1414
01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:32.940
<v 1>there's,</v>

1415
01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:36.170
there's really fascinating book called a biography of a dollar or the biography

1416
01:31:36.171 --> 01:31:39.200
of dollar,
which walks through the history of money in some respects,

1417
01:31:39.201 --> 01:31:42.020
which becomes even more interesting when we start looking at more recent

1418
01:31:42.021 --> 01:31:44.180
develops it developments like crypto currency and so on.

1419
01:31:44.181 --> 01:31:47.330
But at the end of the day,
uh,
at least traditionally speaking,

1420
01:31:47.331 --> 01:31:51.530
it's a medium of exchange.
And so then the question is for one exchange for what?

1421
01:31:51.610 --> 01:31:56.390
Right.
Uh,
let me,
let me ask just a handful more questions,
uh,

1422
01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:00.280
because I think we could have many,
many more conversations

1423
01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:04.390
<v 2>and hopefully this isn't the last,
uh,
we,
we mentioned a few books.</v>

1424
01:32:04.391 --> 01:32:09.391
Are there any other books that you have gifted often to other people or re-read

1425
01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:14.130
allot yourself?
I love that you asked that question that way because,
um,

1426
01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:16.660
it really puts it in a different perspective.

1427
01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:22.220
It's like not what your favorite book is.
It's what you've given us this gift,

1428
01:32:23.350 --> 01:32:26.530
which I thought about a little bit this morning,
and I mean,
it's so clear,

1429
01:32:26.570 --> 01:32:30.340
immediate,
like I didn't have an immediate answer.
And then I had to think,

1430
01:32:30.341 --> 01:32:34.300
why did I do that?
But,
um,
it did,
I think when I was younger,

1431
01:32:34.301 --> 01:32:35.330
and it's still to this day,

1432
01:32:35.331 --> 01:32:40.000
I sometimes gift a book of poetry by Adrian Rich called a dream of common

1433
01:32:40.001 --> 01:32:43.570
language,
a dream of a common law,
common language,

1434
01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:46.620
which was a book written she wrote in the,

1435
01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:50.130
in the late seventies and she's a poet that,
um,

1436
01:32:51.210 --> 01:32:53.800
I was trying to think why it was that book so important to me.

1437
01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:56.440
It's really funny when I read Cheryl stray,
it's

1438
01:32:58.300 --> 01:32:59.133
wild.

1439
01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:02.710
That was one of the books that was most important to her that she had as she

1440
01:33:02.890 --> 01:33:07.130
hiked the Pacific rim.
That's right.
I totally forgot about that.
Yeah.
Um,

1441
01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:11.740
I gift a lot slouching towards Bethlehem,
a book by Joan Didion,

1442
01:33:11.741 --> 01:33:16.741
which is a collection of essays that I love that book so much.

1443
01:33:16.951 --> 01:33:18.540
And it's a lot about how,

1444
01:33:18.541 --> 01:33:23.541
what the kind of writing Joan Didion is doing in those essays are both,

1445
01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:29.020
you know,
of the time.
There's one about John Wayne.

1446
01:33:29.021 --> 01:33:31.000
There's you know about California,

1447
01:33:31.330 --> 01:33:35.470
but there's also this collection of personal essays.
She does,

1448
01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:40.390
that one's called on keeping a notebook that I go back to again and again,

1449
01:33:40.391 --> 01:33:44.020
and I share a lot.
There's one called keeping a notebook.
I'm keeping a notebook.

1450
01:33:44.021 --> 01:33:48.340
There's one called on self respect.
There's one morality,

1451
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:52.620
but it's a,
it's an awesome collection of essays.
Um,

1452
01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:55.030
and there are other books by Joan Didion,

1453
01:33:55.031 --> 01:33:57.610
but that's when I tend to gift the most,
you know,

1454
01:33:57.611 --> 01:34:01.720
the other one that I'm sure people mentioned to you,
I can't imagine they don't,

1455
01:34:01.721 --> 01:34:05.680
is um,
when things fall apart,
but Pema Chodron is,

1456
01:34:05.681 --> 01:34:10.570
anybody recommended that has come up I think only once and up.
I'm Seth,

1457
01:34:10.571 --> 01:34:14.740
I apologize.
Uh,
miss tributing but he,
he does recommend Pema Chodron,

1458
01:34:14.741 --> 01:34:17.140
at least one of her audio books.
But no,

1459
01:34:17.141 --> 01:34:18.670
this was not a book that has come up a lot.

1460
01:34:18.671 --> 01:34:22.120
So if you could explain why so that bunks fall apart.

1461
01:34:22.121 --> 01:34:23.650
I think it's been important to me.

1462
01:34:23.651 --> 01:34:28.630
I've given to people in my life because it had an impact on me,
but it's,

1463
01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:31.960
um,
I don't know.
I could be wrong that it was,
um,

1464
01:34:32.410 --> 01:34:36.910
Pima children's first a shot across the bow.
I mean,

1465
01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:40.030
it might've been the first book she did.
I don't know if that's true or not,

1466
01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:43.810
but it was really my introduction into

1467
01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:48.550
the Pema children for the,

1468
01:34:48.610 --> 01:34:52.660
those of you who don't know as a Buddhist monk who became a Buddhist monk,

1469
01:34:52.661 --> 01:34:57.290
I think probably 30 years ago,
um,
when she had,
when her husband,

1470
01:34:57.470 --> 01:35:01.190
she found that her husband was having an affair and he left her and she was left

1471
01:35:01.191 --> 01:35:03.050
in this place of what to do about that.

1472
01:35:03.051 --> 01:35:06.860
And she kind of accidentally found her way into Buddhism.
But,

1473
01:35:07.570 --> 01:35:08.270
um,

1474
01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:13.270
to me it really revealed the struggle we have day to day of w in the face of

1475
01:35:13.881 --> 01:35:18.740
anything,
laws,
adversity,
all those kinds of things.
You know,
how much,

1476
01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:23.540
uh,
how,
uh,
we tighten up and struggle or we get angry,
we get bitter,

1477
01:35:23.541 --> 01:35:27.260
or we just continued doing the same things over and over.

1478
01:35:27.261 --> 01:35:31.010
The don't necessarily work.
Watching TV,
movies as an escape,

1479
01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:35.960
drinking even exercise sometimes that you have,
whatever it is we're doing.
Um,

1480
01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:37.930
and how,
uh,

1481
01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.950
we always think if we would just get to that next perfect place,

1482
01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:43.820
it would all be okay.

1483
01:35:43.821 --> 01:35:47.660
Like if we had the next job or if we moved to this new city,

1484
01:35:47.661 --> 01:35:52.220
or if we just had this relationship,
it was all be okay.
And then it,

1485
01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:56.330
as it turns out,
when you get to that place,
Lo and behold,

1486
01:35:56.450 --> 01:36:00.860
on the next horizon is you felt uncomfortable because you need this next thing.

1487
01:36:01.130 --> 01:36:05.330
And it's really the idea of,
um,
it did.
Again,

1488
01:36:05.331 --> 01:36:08.100
the journey is the destination.
Being able to,
to,

1489
01:36:08.150 --> 01:36:12.860
I'm on the way to that island role at rowing across the ocean.
You need to get,

1490
01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:17.920
find comfort in being on that boat and the roiling see it.

1491
01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:23.690
And then I did have him permanency and how I think anybody who's lived their

1492
01:36:23.691 --> 01:36:28.691
life with laws or death or anything of the sword understands what a,

1493
01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:33.860
Oh,
quite a jolt it is to figure to understand that things aren't permanent.

1494
01:36:34.190 --> 01:36:39.190
And then when we do accept them permanency of things and learn how to live in

1495
01:36:39.501 --> 01:36:43.940
the moment or on the roiling see and live with that discomfort,

1496
01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:49.370
uh,
it really changed.
It's a life changer.
And so when things fall apart,

1497
01:36:49.371 --> 01:36:52.670
I realized just in saying all that the Joan Didion book slouching towards

1498
01:36:52.671 --> 01:36:57.470
Bethlehem is taken from the same point,
the Yates poem,

1499
01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:02.240
uh,
slouching towards Beth.
What's it called?
Um,
is it slouching towards Bethlehem?

1500
01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:02.770
Right.

1501
01:37:02.770 --> 01:37:07.540
<v 1>Oh God,
you're far more literate than I am.
I'm,
I'm failing my bio exam here.</v>

1502
01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:11.730
<v 2>We'll,
we'll definitely put things fall apart.
The center cannot hold.
It's a yeah.</v>

1503
01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:12.350
Anyway,

1504
01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:12.771
<v 1>puts a,</v>

1505
01:37:12.771 --> 01:37:15.800
we'll put all of these in the show notes and we've talked about mortality a few

1506
01:37:15.801 --> 01:37:17.050
times.
Uh,

1507
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:22.160
I've had quite a bit of revisiting mortality in the last few years with very

1508
01:37:22.161 --> 01:37:26.400
close friends.
And um,
uh,
even now,
currently,
uh,

1509
01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:31.720
some of you effectively family members and I have a coin that sits on my kitchen

1510
01:37:32.781 --> 01:37:35.420
counter or which says Memento Mori.
Remember,

1511
01:37:35.421 --> 01:37:39.740
you're going to die with iconography on it.
Uh,
coincidentally enough,

1512
01:37:39.770 --> 01:37:43.430
I should give him credit made by a friend of mine here,
Ryan holiday,

1513
01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:45.040
who's an author,
uh,

1514
01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:48.740
in the Austin area who writes a lot about stoic philosophy,

1515
01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:53.720
which is highly compatible with a lot of Buddhist thought and contemplative

1516
01:37:53.721 --> 01:37:55.830
practice in my experience.
In any case,

1517
01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.560
<v 2>uh,
do you have a favorite,
favorite is a weird word to use here,</v>

1518
01:38:01.561 --> 01:38:06.360
but a favorite failure or a failure that you feel like taught you a lot or set

1519
01:38:06.361 --> 01:38:09.590
you up for later success?
Um,

1520
01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:18.420
I've felt so often,
and I'm,
I've been successful very often too.
I think if you,

1521
01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:22.560
if it were a formative,
a favorite failure,

1522
01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:27.330
um,
but,
and again,
yeah,
you know,
sometimes don't,

1523
01:38:27.331 --> 01:38:29.970
we all feel like we're beating our head against the wall and he was like,

1524
01:38:30.210 --> 01:38:33.270
why am I doing that same thing over again?
I mean,
that's a whole,

1525
01:38:33.330 --> 01:38:36.720
I think it was still doing that.
It's a whole other subject.
But you know,

1526
01:38:36.721 --> 01:38:40.650
when I was young,
when I was in high school,
I was,
um,

1527
01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:42.510
I was in,

1528
01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:47.540
there was a thing called a youth in government and you from all over Texas that

1529
01:38:48.930 --> 01:38:51.030
they did.
And other states as well.

1530
01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:56.300
But you would learn about government by this kind of mock government thing.

1531
01:38:56.940 --> 01:39:01.720
And it came through the Ymc a tour and they were like little social clubs and

1532
01:39:02.370 --> 01:39:06.490
all of that.
But you think government was,
um,
something I got involved in,
uh,

1533
01:39:06.590 --> 01:39:09.420
when I,
probably when I was a sophomore,
junior high school,

1534
01:39:09.930 --> 01:39:14.640
when I was a senior in high school,
I ran for youth,

1535
01:39:14.641 --> 01:39:18.210
governor of the state of Texas,
which was,
you know,
it's a big state,

1536
01:39:18.211 --> 01:39:18.810
but you had to,

1537
01:39:18.810 --> 01:39:23.250
you had to run on a local level and then you had to run in a regional level and

1538
01:39:23.251 --> 01:39:28.110
then you came to state.
And my grandfather's a Tom is a rancher.
Um,

1539
01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:33.150
uh,
and one of the men I admire most,

1540
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:36.750
um,
was at the time older.
And I think,

1541
01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:40.650
I think at that point he had broken his hip and he was in,
uh,
uh,

1542
01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:44.430
bedbound at home.
But as I ran for youth governor,

1543
01:39:44.431 --> 01:39:48.180
I would read the paper with him on a pretty regular daily basis,

1544
01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:53.010
if not every other day,
and discuss current events and current issues.

1545
01:39:53.011 --> 01:39:56.690
And it was an awesome period of time,
uh,

1546
01:39:57.510 --> 01:40:02.510
having those discussions with him and we came here to Austin for the youth and

1547
01:40:02.791 --> 01:40:04.050
government week and they do it,

1548
01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:07.080
they do it at the Capitol and they do it in the chambers.

1549
01:40:07.081 --> 01:40:09.380
So in the Senate and in the,
in the,

1550
01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:14.550
the House of Representatives and it's right after the,
uh,
the,

1551
01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:18.510
the real thing has led out and so you,
it's,
you know,

1552
01:40:18.511 --> 01:40:21.660
really awesome because you're in these great big hallways and all that kind of

1553
01:40:21.661 --> 01:40:25.860
stuff.
Anyway,
I ran for youth governor and the night that,
um,

1554
01:40:25.930 --> 01:40:28.920
there are already taking the vote and we're staying in a hotel right over here,

1555
01:40:28.921 --> 01:40:31.050
not far from here at all.
They're looking to over there.

1556
01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:35.550
And I was staying in a room with three friends who were there for the party for

1557
01:40:35.551 --> 01:40:37.050
sure.
I was very serious.

1558
01:40:37.051 --> 01:40:40.980
They were there to be in Austin and one of them had an older boyfriend who lived

1559
01:40:40.981 --> 01:40:41.491
here in Austin.

1560
01:40:41.491 --> 01:40:46.491
So they started drinking in the room and I knew that we weren't supposed to be

1561
01:40:46.801 --> 01:40:47.581
drinking in the room.

1562
01:40:47.581 --> 01:40:52.440
And so I left the room and went and visited some other friends down the hall and

1563
01:40:52.441 --> 01:40:57.220
they got caught.
And,
um,
we get called,
I get called to,

1564
01:40:57.221 --> 01:40:59.380
you know,
whoever our supervisor was and she said,

1565
01:40:59.381 --> 01:41:03.670
did you know they were drinking?
And I'm just like,
yeah,
I knew and I left.
Well,

1566
01:41:03.671 --> 01:41:07.090
it turns out that the whole thing was running on the honor system.

1567
01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:11.200
I'm sure I knew that at the time.
And because I did not report them,

1568
01:41:11.650 --> 01:41:14.470
I was kicked out and sent home with them.

1569
01:41:15.010 --> 01:41:18.640
And by that point they knew that I had won the election for youth,

1570
01:41:18.641 --> 01:41:20.110
governor of State of Texas,

1571
01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:23.980
which meant that like in the next year you were going to go to nationals and we

1572
01:41:23.981 --> 01:41:27.130
do all this stuff.
But instead,
so the morning of

1573
01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:32.500
the announcement,
you know,
went to the next person in line and I'm,

1574
01:41:32.501 --> 01:41:36.310
so he was sent home on a bus with them,
you know,
sitting with them.

1575
01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:38.080
And,
um,

1576
01:41:38.140 --> 01:41:42.370
when my mom went to report to my grandfather what had happened because he was

1577
01:41:42.371 --> 01:41:44.800
falling play by play,
he said,

1578
01:41:45.730 --> 01:41:47.620
tell Liz we're really proud of her.

1579
01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:51.240
And to me that was a,

1580
01:41:51.250 --> 01:41:56.250
this formative moment of realizing that there were rules and there was

1581
01:41:56.381 --> 01:41:58.510
authority.
Um,
and you know,

1582
01:41:58.511 --> 01:42:02.770
the honor system was what this whole system was running on.
And it was a system.

1583
01:42:02.771 --> 01:42:05.170
I was,
you know,
part cog and wheel.
And,

1584
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:10.240
and I realized that he was really proud of me because I had grown up with

1585
01:42:10.241 --> 01:42:12.220
brothers and with,
you know,

1586
01:42:12.221 --> 01:42:17.221
a whole community that really believed that you didn't rat on somebody else.

1587
01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:20.680
You didn't call somebody out.
I was right to remove myself.

1588
01:42:20.681 --> 01:42:25.280
But I think there was a whole system of belief that,
uh,

1589
01:42:25.281 --> 01:42:30.010
I'd grown up with it if we've been wrong just to run and tell on somebody else.

1590
01:42:30.410 --> 01:42:33.070
And I think it was the first time that I,
you know,

1591
01:42:33.250 --> 01:42:35.080
over the years and looking back at it,

1592
01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:40.270
I think I learned more from this thing going wrong then it would have learned

1593
01:42:40.271 --> 01:42:41.200
from it going ride.

1594
01:42:41.230 --> 01:42:46.080
And it was about questioning systems in questioning values of just to,

1595
01:42:46.081 --> 01:42:47.980
cause somebody feeds says,
this is the,

1596
01:42:48.010 --> 01:42:49.690
these are the rules and this is what it is.

1597
01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:54.370
It doesn't mean that that's really the rules you need to incorporate,

1598
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:55.623
you know,

1599
01:42:55.760 --> 01:43:00.530
<v 1>as a great story.
What a lovely experience.
Also,</v>

1600
01:43:00.531 --> 01:43:05.450
not that particular,
uh,
time in the capital,
but with your,

1601
01:43:05.451 --> 01:43:07.880
it was your grandfather.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah,
that sounds so great.

1602
01:43:07.881 --> 01:43:09.230
I never had that chance.
My,
uh,

1603
01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:12.860
my grandparents passed all of them when I was very young.
Yeah.

1604
01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:15.380
I was just lucky that way.
Yeah,
that's a name.

1605
01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:18.440
And we all lived in different states,
so even,
even when they were alive,

1606
01:43:18.441 --> 01:43:23.300
we only got to see them very briefly.
Uh,
you know,
just,
just a few more questions.

1607
01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:24.153
Uh,

1608
01:43:25.970 --> 01:43:29.660
if you had gigantic billboard,
metaphorically speaking,

1609
01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:32.520
right to on which you do.

1610
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:38.930
So if you had an additional billboard,
uh,
on which you could put a word,

1611
01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:42.860
a quote,
a question,
anything noncommercial,

1612
01:43:43.340 --> 01:43:45.830
just a message to get out to millions or billions of people,

1613
01:43:45.831 --> 01:43:47.210
what might you put on that billboard?

1614
01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:52.850
<v 2>Um,
we do over,
down by the San and the Austin Motel.
There is a big billboard,</v>

1615
01:43:52.851 --> 01:43:57.020
but of course we rented to advertisers.

1616
01:43:57.620 --> 01:44:02.420
Um,
but on the side of,
um,
there are a couple of things on the side of Joe's.

1617
01:44:02.450 --> 01:44:07.130
One is that iconic,
I love you so much that people take pictures of all the time.

1618
01:44:07.340 --> 01:44:11.480
So it's a,
it's a longer story,
but on the backside of Joe's,

1619
01:44:11.481 --> 01:44:15.320
there is a quote from Jack Kerouac that says,

1620
01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:19.370
don't break your tenderness.
And I love that quote.

1621
01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:23.240
I think that's a good thing for everybody to remember.
Break your tenderness,

1622
01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:26.480
tenderness.
Yeah,
I love that.
I've never actually heard that before.

1623
01:44:26.481 --> 01:44:27.440
Now I think it's something we,

1624
01:44:27.441 --> 01:44:31.520
all this is right on the backside of Joe's on South Congress.
It's in,

1625
01:44:31.521 --> 01:44:33.530
when you're in,
when you're sitting there,
you can see it.

1626
01:44:33.531 --> 01:44:37.670
It's kind of blue on the,
on the corrugated,
so it doesn't bounce out.

1627
01:44:37.671 --> 01:44:42.010
Maybe we need to repaint it,
but it's been there since we opened it from,

1628
01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:43.520
I think Mexico City blows

1629
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:46.150
<v 1>in,
in a very real way.
I know you,</v>

1630
01:44:46.210 --> 01:44:49.190
you wouldn't take full credit for this and there were macro forces at work and

1631
01:44:49.191 --> 01:44:52.970
so on.
But the fact that I,
the first thing I just thought to myself was,
wow,

1632
01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:57.710
I should go check that out next time I go for a nice walk down South Congress.

1633
01:44:58.050 --> 01:44:59.150
I mean,
if you hit,
not

1634
01:45:00.650 --> 01:45:05.650
looked out or perhaps gazed across the street from the continental and taking

1635
01:45:06.021 --> 01:45:08.360
the San Jose upon yourself as a project,

1636
01:45:08.361 --> 01:45:10.160
who knows what that neighborhood would look like.
I mean,

1637
01:45:10.161 --> 01:45:11.950
you had played a formative role in making it

1638
01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:15.190
<v 2>what it is.
That's a big,
that's a big deal.
It is a big deal.
I mean it's,</v>

1639
01:45:15.191 --> 01:45:18.270
it's an interesting,
we could talk for hours about that too.
You know,

1640
01:45:18.271 --> 01:45:20.520
I think it's about to change yet again.

1641
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:24.480
I mean it would have changed and it would have grown and everything is always

1642
01:45:24.481 --> 01:45:28.650
changing and neighborhoods and always changing.
But,
um,
you know,

1643
01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:33.950
I think we were about to see an at home next wave of south congress salmon.

1644
01:45:34.860 --> 01:45:37.440
Oh,
I agree.
Yeah,
I'm excited to see it.

1645
01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:39.550
<v 1>Yeah.
Well,
Liz,</v>

1646
01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:44.640
this is so fun and I'm really glad that we finally had a chance to sit down.

1647
01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:49.570
Uh,
do you have any requests of the audience asks of the audience,

1648
01:45:49.571 --> 01:45:53.800
suggestions of the audience?
Anything you'd like to say before we wrap up?

1649
01:45:54.090 --> 01:45:56.100
<v 2>No,
but,
uh,
no,</v>

1650
01:45:56.101 --> 01:45:59.790
but I'm very excited about getting last days of the San Jose out there.

1651
01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:02.900
<v 1>Yes,
yes.
And,
uh,</v>

1652
01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:07.930
we were just chatting in between a brief a cut that we made about a handful of

1653
01:46:09.771 --> 01:46:13.310
things that probably need to be done just in terms of clearing writes music and

1654
01:46:13.311 --> 01:46:16.040
so on.
So for those people listening,
it might not be immediate,

1655
01:46:16.730 --> 01:46:20.420
but we didn't clink tea glasses.
So last days,

1656
01:46:20.450 --> 01:46:23.780
sooner than never have San Jose sooner than never.
Yes.

1657
01:46:23.781 --> 01:46:28.220
That is something that I think we're both comfortable committing to and people

1658
01:46:28.221 --> 01:46:33.221
can find you at the Liz Lambert on Instagram and Twitter at bunk house hotels,

1659
01:46:33.710 --> 01:46:37.130
Instagram and Twitter,
and a bunk house group.com.

1660
01:46:37.131 --> 01:46:39.380
Definitely if you're in the Austin area and if you're in,

1661
01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:43.760
have never been to Austin for God's sake,
take a visit.
It's a,

1662
01:46:43.761 --> 01:46:47.990
it's a very cool town,
the self proclaimed but believable,

1663
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:53.440
uh,
live music capital of the world.
And,
uh,

1664
01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:57.150
it's been really lovely spending time with you today as well.
It really has been.

1665
01:46:57.151 --> 01:46:57.750
Thank you.

1666
