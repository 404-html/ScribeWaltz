1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.880
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:06.070
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.450
Question,

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.460
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

5
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.230
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by teeter.</v>

6
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.340
I am so thrilled to have connected with these guys because I've used teeter

7
00:00:30.341 --> 00:00:32.410
products for many,
many years.

8
00:00:32.411 --> 00:00:36.850
I've traveled around the country and the world with teeter products and I'm

9
00:00:36.851 --> 00:00:41.851
sitting about 15 feet in my home from one of their inversion tables and we're

10
00:00:42.851 --> 00:00:44.530
going to talk more about all of that.

11
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.640
One of my rituals is hanging and I should say not really that it's a maintenance

12
00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:52.450
and performance program.
I hang not just in the morning potentially,

13
00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:55.510
but particularly after a day of bearing weight,

14
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.620
whether that includes weight training and Jersey Gregorich world record holder

15
00:00:59.621 --> 00:01:04.210
insists on this type of inversion therapy after training or just wearing a heavy

16
00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:08.950
backpack around a few minutes goes a long way towards better sleep.

17
00:01:08.951 --> 00:01:12.220
In my case,
less back pain,
neck pain,
leg pain.

18
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.320
It's not a panacea obviously,

19
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.880
but inversion therapy which uses gravity in your own body weight to decompress

20
00:01:18.881 --> 00:01:23.470
the spinal relief pressure on the discs and surrounding nerves seems to help

21
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.330
with a whole slew of conditions.
And just as a general maintenance program,

22
00:01:28.331 --> 00:01:32.950
it's one of my favorite things to do.
So what to say about that teeter?

23
00:01:32.951 --> 00:01:33.491
Why Tutor?

24
00:01:33.491 --> 00:01:37.900
Tutor is the best known name in inversion table since 1981 more than 3 million

25
00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:40.370
people have put their trust and teeter teeters.

26
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.710
Also the only inversion table brand that has been both safety certified by

27
00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:48.370
underwriters laboratories.
That's Ul for you people in that industry,

28
00:01:48.371 --> 00:01:53.140
you will recognize it and registered with the FDA as a class one medical device

29
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.980
and they're giving a very special offer just to you guys,

30
00:01:56.981 --> 00:02:00.310
my listeners for a limited time that you can get the teeter inversion table with

31
00:02:00.311 --> 00:02:01.300
bonus accessories,

32
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.250
which I have a bunch of again in the room next to me and a free pair of gravity

33
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:09.700
boots so that you can invert at home or take the boots with you to the gym.

34
00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:10.780
So these gravity boots,

35
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.200
I have three separate pairs of gravity boots bought with my own monies in three

36
00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:18.730
different cities that I've had for a very,

37
00:02:18.731 --> 00:02:21.070
very long time because I don't want to travel with them necessarily.

38
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.100
They look kind of like ski boots,
but without the foot portion,

39
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.820
and they hook you upside down so you can take them really anywhere you want to

40
00:02:27.821 --> 00:02:29.320
go to get this deal,

41
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.210
which is a savings of over $148.
It's very specific.

42
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.390
So maybe it's 149 you have to go to teeter.com forward slash Tim,

43
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.860
that's teeter.com forward slash.
Tim,
t.
E.
T.
E.
R.

44
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.850
You also get free shipping,
a 60 day money back guarantee and free returns.

45
00:02:48.851 --> 00:02:51.430
So why not try it out?
Remember,

46
00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:56.110
you can only get the teeter inversion table with bonus accessories and a free

47
00:02:56.111 --> 00:02:59.980
pair of gravity boots by going to twitter.com forward,
Tim.

48
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.200
So if you're thinking of yourself,
what the hell is this thing?

49
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:05.050
And he's talking about,
I can't even envision it in my head.
Well,

50
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.500
take a look at the photos.
Go to teeter.com forward slash Tim,

51
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.190
hello boys and girls and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

52
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.880
This is Tim Ferriss and each and every episode it is typically my job to

53
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:22.210
deconstruct world class performers in law enforcing interviews,

54
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.440
whether they come from the worlds of military,
entertainment,
sports investing,

55
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.420
business or otherwise.

56
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.660
This episode is going to be a special intervention slash helping hand as much

57
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:39.031
for me as anyone else from the outside looking in the last two to four weeks

58
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.750
have been disaster after disaster.
For me,

59
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.650
I had a very unexpected and sad death in the family.

60
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.750
Several large business deals that were in process for six plus months fell apart

61
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:56.830
at the last minute and the list just goes on and on and on.

62
00:03:56.831 --> 00:04:01.180
I may in fact have to sue someone for breach of contract,

63
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.830
which I'm always loath to do and it's been high stress.

64
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.090
It has been high stress.

65
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.980
And the question then is how does one respond when faced with the unpredictable?

66
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.230
One of the tools is a book and there are several books that I've thought about

67
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:18.640
over and over again during this period.

68
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.150
One of them is the obstacle is the way by Ryan holiday and find them on Twitter

69
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:28.840
at Ryan holiday.
It has helped me to look at problems differently,

70
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.340
turn them upside down,

71
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.690
become the calm within the storm and even uncover unique opportunities,

72
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:35.350
believe it or not.

73
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.350
So in many ways I've come to see these problems that have assaulted me,

74
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.220
these situations that have surprised me as blessings in disguise.

75
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.470
In some cases the obstacle's,
the way,

76
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.190
as I mentioned by Ryan holiday is a collection of stories and principles about

77
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:55.150
stoicism,
which is not a cow standing in the rain.

78
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.320
That's not what you want to become.

79
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.370
It is what I consider to be the ultimate personal operating system,

80
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.240
let's say for anyone who wants to thrive in high stress environments and

81
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:07.610
situations.
If you want to be antifragile like Thomas Jefferson,

82
00:05:07.611 --> 00:05:12.190
say Marcus or release bill Bellacheck and many of the most dominant investors in

83
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:12.581
history.

84
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:17.581
Stoicism offers a real playbook and is in fact part of the playbook or play

85
00:05:18.271 --> 00:05:21.430
books of everyone I just mentioned.
If you want to make better decisions,

86
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:25.330
if you want to smile when other people cower,
it offers very,

87
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:28.750
very pragmatic approaches and it's not a panacea.

88
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.370
You are most certainly going to feel certain types of emotions that maybe you

89
00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:36.490
prefer not to.
The question is how do you then react?

90
00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:41.080
How do you then respond to quote Andy Grove,
former CEO of Intel,
quote,

91
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.830
bad companies are destroyed by crisis.
Good companies survive them.

92
00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:47.050
Great companies are improved by them,

93
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.600
so what if you could be a person who is improved by crisis?
At the very least,

94
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.400
I suspect it would give you opportunities.
No one else can see you,

95
00:05:55.401 --> 00:05:58.940
let alone grasp much more important in my mind at this point.

96
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.620
It would make you a happier and much more at peace human being.

97
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.130
And the content of the four sample chapters that are going to comprise this

98
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:15.380
episode are very closely related to my last Ted talk about an exercise called

99
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:19.790
fear setting,
which I do,
I would say these days,
every week,

100
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.920
but more typically every month.

101
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:27.250
It is the most important and valuable exercise that I do and you can hear about

102
00:06:27.441 --> 00:06:32.441
that and also see a text version of it@tim.blog forward slash Ted and this book,

103
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.350
the obstacle is the way is part of the Tim Ferriss Book Club,

104
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.050
which is a in a hibernation,

105
00:06:39.051 --> 00:06:41.750
but there are still about 10 of the books that you can see.

106
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.720
audible.com forward slash Tim's books.

107
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.880
The top is a little bit stoicism heavy,

108
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.910
so you can scroll down to see other books about travel and rituals and routines

109
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.760
of successful people and so on.
So if that has an interest,

110
00:06:54.761 --> 00:06:58.340
you can check out audible.com forward slash Tim's books.
But in the meantime,

111
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.670
I hope that this is an episode that you find helpful or perhaps return to during

112
00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:06.260
times of stress when you're caught off guard.

113
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.230
And with that without further ado,

114
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.650
please enjoy the obstacle is the way by Ryan holiday.

115
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.470
<v 2>Okay.</v>

116
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.150
<v 3>Control your emotions.</v>

117
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.970
Would you have a great empire rule over yourself?

118
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.500
Publius Syrus

119
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.400
<v 2>okay.</v>

120
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.310
<v 3>When America race descend the first man into space,</v>

121
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:35.340
they train the astronauts in one skill more than any other art of not panicking.

122
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.300
When people panic,
they make mistakes.
They override systems,

123
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.980
they disregard procedures and ignore rules.
They deviate from the plan.

124
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.100
They become unresponsive and stop thinking clearly.

125
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.480
They just react not what they need to react to,

126
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.900
but to the survival of hormones that are coursing through their veins.

127
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.100
Welcome to the source of most of the problems down here on earth.

128
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.650
Everything is planned down to the letter.

129
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.850
Then something goes wrong in the first thing we do is traded our plan for a good

130
00:08:05.851 --> 00:08:07.170
ole emotional freak out.

131
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:12.550
Some of us almost crave sounding the alarm because it's easier than dealing with

132
00:08:12.551 --> 00:08:17.551
whatever is staring us in the face at a 150 miles above earth in a spaceship

133
00:08:18.301 --> 00:08:22.710
smaller than a VW.
This is death.
Panic is suicide,

134
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:27.110
so the panic has to be trained out and it does not go easily.

135
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.450
Before the first launch,

136
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:34.220
NASA recreated the fateful day for the astronauts over and over step by step

137
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.260
hundreds of times from what they'd have for breakfast to the ride to the

138
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:42.040
airfield.
Slowly in a graded series of exposures,

139
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.630
the astronauts were introduced to every sight and sound of the experience of

140
00:08:46.631 --> 00:08:48.070
their firing into space.

141
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.670
They did it so many times that it became as natural and familiar as breathing.

142
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.630
They'd practice all the way through,
nothing back,
but the liftoff itself,

143
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.070
making sure to solve for every variable and remove all uncertainty,

144
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:07.350
uncertainty and fear are relieved by authority.
Trading is authority.

145
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.560
It's a release valve.
With enough exposure,

146
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:13.050
you can adapt out those perfectly ordinary,

147
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:18.030
even innate fears that are bred mostly from unfamiliarity.
Fortunately,

148
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.480
unfamiliarity is simple to fix.
Again,
not easy,

149
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:26.040
which makes it possible to increase our tolerance for stress and uncertainty.

150
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.060
John Glenn,
the first American astronauts to orbit the earth,

151
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.040
spent nearly a day in space,

152
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:34.920
still keeping this heart rate under a hundred beats per minute.

153
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:40.610
That's a man not simply sitting at the controls but in control of his emotions.

154
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:46.220
A man who had properly cultivated what Tom Wolfe later called the right stuff,

155
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:51.780
but you confront a client or a stranger on the street and your heart is liable

156
00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:56.100
to burst out of your chest or called on to address a crowd and your stomach

157
00:09:56.101 --> 00:09:57.390
crashes through the floor.

158
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:03.050
It's time to realize that this is a luxury and indulgence of our lesser self in

159
00:10:03.631 --> 00:10:08.250
space.
The difference between life and death lies in emotional regulation,

160
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:09.720
hitting the wrong button,

161
00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:13.650
reading the instrument panels and correctly engage in this sequence too early.

162
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:17.250
None of these could have been afforded on a successful Apollo mission.

163
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.130
The consequences were too great.
Thus,

164
00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:23.730
the question for astronauts was not how skilled a pilot are you,

165
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.190
but can you keep an even strain?

166
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:31.520
Can you fight the urge to panic and instead focus only on what you can change on

167
00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:34.920
the task at hand.
Life is really no different.

168
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.200
Obstacles make us emotional,

169
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:41.790
but the only way we'll survive or overcome them is by keeping those emotions in

170
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:45.360
check.
If we can keep steady,
no matter what happens,

171
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.210
no matter how much external events may fluctuate,

172
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.840
the Greeks had a word for this apathy.

173
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:57.240
It's the kind of emotional equanimity that comes from the absence of irrational

174
00:10:57.241 --> 00:11:01.260
or extreme emotions,
not the loss of feeling altogether.

175
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.120
Just the loss of the harmful,
unhelpful,
kind.
Don't let the negativity in.

176
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.770
Don't let those emotions even gets started.
Just say,
no thank you.

177
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:15.300
I can't afford to panic.
This is the skill that must be cultivated.

178
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:20.070
Freedom from disturbance and perturbation so you can focus your energy

179
00:11:20.071 --> 00:11:25.071
exclusively on solving problems rather than reacting to them of bosses.

180
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.680
Urgent email and asshole at a bar,
a call from the bank,

181
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.950
your financing that's been polled a knock at the door.

182
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:36.630
There's been an accident as Gavin de Becker rights and the gift of fear.

183
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:41.880
When you worry.
Ask Yourself,
what am I choosing to not see right now?

184
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:47.100
What important things are you missing because you chose worry over
introspection,

185
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.810
alertness,
or wisdom.

186
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.250
Another way of putting it does getting upset provides you with more options.

187
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.810
Sometimes it does,
but in this instance,
no,
I suppose not.

188
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.000
Well then if an emotion can't change the condition or the situation you're

189
00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:04.834
dealing with,

190
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:10.080
it is likely and unhelpful emotion or quite possibly a destructive one,

191
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.820
but it's what I feel,
right?
No one said anything about not feeling it.

192
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:20.830
No one ever said,
you can't cry.
Forget manliness.
If you need to take a moment,

193
00:12:20.831 --> 00:12:22.420
by all means go ahead.

194
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.520
Real strength lies in the control or as the seem to lab.
Put it,

195
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:32.410
the domestication of one's emotions,
not in pretending they don't exist,

196
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.240
so go ahead.
Feel it.

197
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:39.130
Just don't lie to yourself by conflating emoting about a problem with dealing

198
00:12:39.131 --> 00:12:42.910
with it because they are as different as sleeping and waking.

199
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:48.070
You can always remind yourself,
I am in control,
not my emotions.

200
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.470
I see what is really going on here.

201
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.440
I am not going to get excited or upset.

202
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.640
We defeat emotions with logic or that's the idea.

203
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.950
Logic is questions and statements.
With enough of them,
we'd get to root causes,

204
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.090
which are always easier to deal with.
We lost money,

205
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.170
but aren't losses a pretty common part of business?
Yes.

206
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.190
Are these losses catastrophic?
Not necessarily.

207
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.170
So this is not totally unexpected,
is it?
How could that be so bad?

208
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.760
Why are you all worked up over something that is at least occasionally supposed

209
00:13:24.761 --> 00:13:29.260
to happen?
Well,
um,
I,
and not only that,

210
00:13:29.261 --> 00:13:31.570
but you've dealt with worse situations than this.

211
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.710
Wouldn't you be better off applying some of that resourcefulness rather than

212
00:13:35.711 --> 00:13:36.544
anger?

213
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:41.290
Try having that conversation with yourself and see how these extreme emotions

214
00:13:41.291 --> 00:13:46.030
hold up.
They won't last long.
Trust that after all,

215
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.120
you're probably not going to die from any of this.

216
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.530
It might help to say it over and over again whenever you feel the anxiety began

217
00:13:53.531 --> 00:13:57.640
to come on.
I'm not going to die from this.
I'm not going to die from this.

218
00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:01.750
I am not going to die from this or try Marcus's question.

219
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:06.400
Does what happened?
Keep you from acting with justice,
generosity,

220
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:11.350
self control,
sanity,
prudence,
honesty,

221
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.100
humility,
straightforwardness.
Nope.

222
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.520
Then get back to work.
Subconsciously,

223
00:14:18.521 --> 00:14:21.430
we should be constantly asking ourselves this question,

224
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.100
do I need to freak out about this?

225
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:28.990
And the answer like it is for astronauts,
for soldiers,
for doctors,

226
00:14:28.991 --> 00:14:32.920
and for so many other professionals must be no,

227
00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:38.160
because I practiced for this situation and I can control myself or no because I

228
00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:44.641
caught myself and I'm able to realize that it doesn't add anything constructive.

229
00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:52.910
Finding the opportunity.
A good person dies.

230
00:14:52.911 --> 00:14:57.080
Events with his own color and turns whatever happens to his benefit.

231
00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:58.573
Seneca,

232
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:03.350
one of the most intimidating in shocking developments in modern warfare was the

233
00:15:03.351 --> 00:15:07.340
German blitzkrieg or lightening war in World War II.

234
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:10.760
The Germans wanted to avoid the drawn out trench fighting of previous wars,

235
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.490
so they concentrated in mobile divisions into rapid,

236
00:15:13.491 --> 00:15:17.420
narrow offensive forces that caught their enemies completely unprepared,

237
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.560
like the tip of a spear.
Columns of Panzer tanks rushed into Poland,

238
00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.210
the Netherlands,
Belgium,

239
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:28.010
and France with devastating results and little opposition.
In most cases,

240
00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:31.520
the opposing commanders simply surrendered rather than face what felt like an

241
00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:34.700
invincible indefatigable monster bearing down on them.

242
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:39.050
The Blitzkrieg strategy was designed to exploit the flinch of the enemy.

243
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.250
He must collapse at the site of what appears to be overwhelming force.

244
00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.610
It's success depends completely on this response.

245
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:51.910
This military strategy works because the set upon troops CB offensive force as

246
00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:54.140
an enormous obstacle bearing down on them.

247
00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.490
This is how the allied opposition viewed the blitzkrieg for most of the war.

248
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:02.090
They could see only its power and their own vulnerability to it.

249
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:06.170
In the weeks and months after the successful invasion of Normandy by allied

250
00:16:06.171 --> 00:16:10.850
forces,
they face it again,
a set of massive German counter offensives.

251
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.720
How could they stop it?
Would it throw them back into the very beaches?

252
00:16:14.721 --> 00:16:17.060
They just purchased it so high a cost.

253
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.910
A great leader answered that question.

254
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.880
Striding into a conference room at the headquarters in Malta,

255
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.550
General Dwight d Eisenhower made an announcement.

256
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:29.480
He'd have no more of this quivering timidity from is deflated generals.

257
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:34.310
The present situation is to be regarded as an opportunity for us and not

258
00:16:34.311 --> 00:16:35.660
disaster.
He commanded,

259
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.700
there will only be cheerful faces at this conference table and that surgeon

260
00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:41.540
counter offensive.

261
00:16:41.541 --> 00:16:45.050
Eisenhower was able to see the tactical solution that had been in front of them

262
00:16:45.051 --> 00:16:49.820
the entire time that the Nazi strategy carried its own destruction within itself

263
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:55.280
only then when the allies able to see the opportunity inside the obstacle rather

264
00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:59.690
than simply the obstacle that threatened them properly seen as long as the

265
00:16:59.691 --> 00:17:04.550
allies could bend and not break.
This attacks that more than 50,000 Germans,

266
00:17:04.551 --> 00:17:09.380
Russian headfirst into a net or a meat grinder as patent eloquently put it,

267
00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.070
the battle of the bulge and before that,
the battle of the fall as pocket,

268
00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:17.600
which both were feared to be major reversals and the end of the allies momentum

269
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.381
in fact,

270
00:17:18.381 --> 00:17:22.820
where their greatest triumphs by allowing a forward wedge of the German army

271
00:17:22.821 --> 00:17:24.770
through and then attacking from the sides,

272
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:28.070
the allies and circled the enemy completely from the rear.

273
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:32.660
The invincible penetrating thrust of the German panzers wasn't just impotent but

274
00:17:32.661 --> 00:17:33.494
suicidal.

275
00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:38.510
A textbook example of why you never leave your flanks exposed more important.

276
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:40.640
It's a textbook example of the role.

277
00:17:40.641 --> 00:17:44.750
Our own perceptions play in the success or failures of those who oppose us.

278
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:50.130
It's one thing to not be overwhelmed by obstacles or discouraged or upset by

279
00:17:50.131 --> 00:17:53.280
them,
and this is something that few are able to do,

280
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:57.850
but after you have controlled your emotions and you can see objectively and Stan

281
00:17:57.851 --> 00:18:01.920
steadily,
the next step becomes possible.
A mental flip.

282
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.160
So you're looking not at the obstacle,
but if the opportunity within it,

283
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:09.660
as Laura Ingalls wilder put in there is good at everything.

284
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.260
If only we look for it.
Yet we are so bad at looking,

285
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.390
we close our eyes to the gift.

286
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:20.580
Imagine if you'd been an Eisenhower shoes with an army racing towards you and

287
00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:24.810
you'd seen only impending defeat.
How much longer would the war have gone on?

288
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:29.670
How many more lives lost?
It's our preconceptions that are the problem.

289
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:34.050
They tell us that they should or need to be a certain way,
so when they're not,

290
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:38.310
we naturally assume we are at a disadvantage or that we'd be wasting our time to

291
00:18:38.311 --> 00:18:43.311
pursue an alternate course when really it's all fair game and every situation is

292
00:18:43.801 --> 00:18:45.600
an opportunity for us to act.

293
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:51.360
Let's take a circumstance we've all been having a bad boss.
Always see,

294
00:18:51.361 --> 00:18:55.350
is the hell always see?
Is the thing burned down on us?
We flinch,

295
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:59.340
but what have you regarded it as an opportunity instead of a disaster?

296
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.330
If you meet it when you say you're at the end of your rope and you would rather

297
00:19:03.331 --> 00:19:04.110
quit,

298
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:09.060
you actually have an opportunity to change and grow and improve yourself and

299
00:19:09.061 --> 00:19:12.210
unique opportunity to experiment with different solutions,

300
00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:16.680
to try different tactics or to take on new projects to add your skillset.

301
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:21.540
You could study this bad boss and learn from him while you fill out your resumes

302
00:19:21.541 --> 00:19:23.730
and hit up contacts for a better job elsewhere.

303
00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:28.350
You can prepare yourself for that job by trying new styles of communication or

304
00:19:28.351 --> 00:19:32.160
standing up for yourself,
all with a perfect safety net for yourself.

305
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.450
Quit in and getting out of there with this new attitude and fearlessness.

306
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:37.403
Who knows?

307
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.830
You might be able to exact concessions and find that you like the job again,

308
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.880
one day the boss will make a mistake and then you'll make your move and out

309
00:19:44.881 --> 00:19:48.930
maneuver him.
It will feel so much better than the alternative.
Whining,

310
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:54.200
bad mouth and duplicity spinelessness or take that long time rival at work or

311
00:19:55.591 --> 00:19:58.620
that rival company,
the one who causes endless headaches.

312
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.550
Note the fact that they keep you alert.
Raise the stakes,

313
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.130
motivate you to prove them wrong.
Harden you,

314
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:10.370
help you appreciate your friends provided instructive analog example of who you

315
00:20:10.471 --> 00:20:14.370
don't want to become or that computer glitch that erased all your work.

316
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.460
You will now be twice as good at it since you we'll do it again.

317
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.540
How about that business decision that turned out to be a mistake?
Well,

318
00:20:21.541 --> 00:20:26.160
you had a hypothesis and it turned out to be wrong.
Why should that upset you?

319
00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:29.070
It wouldn't piss off a scientist.
It would help him.

320
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:34.050
Maybe don't bet so much on it next time and now you've learned two things that

321
00:20:34.051 --> 00:20:38.070
your instinct was wrong and the kind of appetite for risk.
You really have.

322
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:43.140
Blessings and burdens are not mutually exclusive.
It's a lot more complicated.

323
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:45.810
Socrates had a mean nagging life.

324
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:51.010
He always said that married to her was good practice for philosophy.
Of course,

325
00:20:51.011 --> 00:20:53.290
you'd want to avoid something negative.
If you could,

326
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:57.490
but what have you were able to remember in the moment the second act that seems

327
00:20:57.491 --> 00:21:00.940
to come with the unfortunate situations,
we try so hard to avoid.

328
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.470
Sports psychologist recently did a study of elite athletes who are struck with

329
00:21:05.471 --> 00:21:07.420
some adversity or serious injury.

330
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.540
Initially each reported feeling isolation,

331
00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:14.800
emotional disruption at doubts about their athletic ability.
Yet afterwards,

332
00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:19.060
each reported gated a desire to help others additional perspective and a

333
00:21:19.061 --> 00:21:21.910
realization of their own strength.
In other words,

334
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:26.350
every fear doubt they felt during the injury turned into greater abilities that

335
00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:29.500
those exact areas.
It's a beautiful idea.

336
00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:34.030
Psychologists call it adversarial growth and post traumatic growth.

337
00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:38.890
That which doesn't kill me,
makes me stronger,
is not a cliche,
but fact.

338
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.990
The struggle against that obstacle inevitably propels the fighter to a new level

339
00:21:43.991 --> 00:21:48.160
of functioning.
The extent of the struggle determines the extent of the growth,

340
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:51.100
the obstacles that advantage not adversity.

341
00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:54.640
The enemy is any perception that prevents us from seeing this.

342
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.470
Of all the strategies we talked about,
this is the one you can always use.

343
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:04.690
Everything can be flipped scene with this kind of gaze,
a piercing look.

344
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:09.430
The ignores the package and sees only big gift or we can fight it the entire

345
00:22:09.431 --> 00:22:14.350
way.
The result is the same.
The obstacle's still exists.
One just hurts less.

346
00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.990
The benefit is still there below the surface.

347
00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.770
What kind of idiot decides not to take it now?

348
00:22:20.771 --> 00:22:23.560
The things that other people avoid or flinch away from,

349
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:27.910
we're thankful for when people are rude or disrespectful.

350
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:33.130
Well that means they underestimate us.
A huge advantage.
Can I even,
well,

351
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.980
we won't have to apologize when we make an example out of them.

352
00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:41.590
Critical or question our abilities.
Lower expectations are easier to exceed.

353
00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.610
Lazy makes,
whatever we accomplish,
the all the more admirable,

354
00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:47.283
it's striking.

355
00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.790
These are perfectly fine starting points better in some cases than whatever

356
00:22:51.791 --> 00:22:53.920
you'd have hoped for.
In the best case scenario,

357
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:58.960
what advantage do you derive from someone being polite or pulling their punches

358
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.710
behind the behaviors that provoke an immediate negative reaction?

359
00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.820
Is it opportunity,

360
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.720
some exposed benefit that we can see mentally and then act upon?

361
00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:12.040
So focus on that.
All the poorly wrapped at additionally repulsive present.

362
00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:16.810
You've been headed in every seemingly disadvantageous situation because beneath

363
00:23:16.811 --> 00:23:20.470
the packaging is what we need.
Often something of real value,

364
00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.400
a gift of great benefit.
No one is talking glass,

365
00:23:24.401 --> 00:23:28.120
half full style platitudes here.
This is a complete flip.

366
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:32.950
See it through the negative past its underside at Intuit's corollary,

367
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:33.963
the positive

368
00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:41.530
follow the process
under the comb,

369
00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.770
the tangle and the straight path are the same.

370
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:50.680
Hara Cletus coach Nick Saban doesn't actually refer to it very often,

371
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:56.000
but every one of his assistants in players live by it.
They say it for him,

372
00:23:56.270 --> 00:24:01.190
tattooing it at the front of their minds and on every action they take because

373
00:24:01.191 --> 00:24:04.820
just two words are responsible for their unprecedented success.

374
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.670
The process.
Saban,

375
00:24:07.671 --> 00:24:10.580
the head coach of the University of Alabama football team,

376
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:14.060
perhaps the most dominant dynasty in the history of college football,

377
00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:19.360
doesn't focus on what every other coach focuses on or at least not the way they

378
00:24:19.401 --> 00:24:22.010
do.
He teaches the process,

379
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:27.710
the process in his words,
don't think about winning the Sec Championship.

380
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.440
Don't think about the national championship.

381
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:35.780
Think about what you needed to do in this drill,
on this play.
In this moment.

382
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:39.920
That's the process.
Let's think about what we can do today.

383
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:45.310
The task at hand and the chaos of sport as in life process provides us away.

384
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.680
It says,
okay,
you've got to do something very difficult.

385
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:55.940
Don't focus on that.
Instead,
break it down into pieces.

386
00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:01.510
Simply do what you need to do right now and do it well and then move on to the

387
00:25:02.781 --> 00:25:06.470
next thing.
Follow the process and not the prize.

388
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:12.310
The road to back to back championships is just that a road and you travel along

389
00:25:12.651 --> 00:25:13.760
a road and steps.

390
00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:19.360
Excellence is a matter of steps excelling at this one and then that one and then

391
00:25:19.911 --> 00:25:23.480
the one after that.
Saban's processes exclusively.

392
00:25:23.481 --> 00:25:27.530
This existing in the present,
taking it one step at a time,

393
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.550
not getting distracted by anything else,
not the other team,

394
00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:36.200
not the scoreboard or the crowd.
The processes about finishing,

395
00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:41.180
finishing games,
finishing workouts,
finishing film sessions,
finishing drives,

396
00:25:41.181 --> 00:25:45.900
finishing reps,
finishing plays,
finishing blocks,
finishing the smallest task.

397
00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.440
Do you have right in front of you and finishing it?
Well,

398
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:53.360
whether it's pursuing the pinnacle of success in your field or simply surviving

399
00:25:53.361 --> 00:25:56.810
some awful or trying or deal the same approach works.

400
00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:01.520
Don't think about the end.
Think about surviving,
making it for meal,

401
00:26:01.521 --> 00:26:04.520
the meal break to break,
checkpoint to checkpoint,

402
00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:09.380
paycheck to paycheck one day at a time,
and when you really get it right,

403
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:14.500
even the hardest things become manageable because the process is relaxing under

404
00:26:14.901 --> 00:26:17.330
its influence.
We'd need an panic.

405
00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:21.590
Even mammoth task become just a series of component parts.

406
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:26.510
This was what the great 19th century pioneer of meteorology,

407
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:30.980
James Pollard SB had shown to him in a chance encounter as a young man,

408
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:36.350
unable to read and write until he was 18 SB attended a rousing speech by the

409
00:26:36.351 --> 00:26:40.610
famous order,
Henry Clay.
After the talk is spellbound,

410
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.800
SB tried to make his way towards clay,

411
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.420
but couldn't form the words to speak to his idol.

412
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.800
One of his friends shouted out for him.
He wants to be like you,

413
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:54.000
even though he can't read.
Clay grabbed one of his posters,

414
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:58.500
which had the word clay written in big letters.
He looked at Spn said,

415
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.490
you see that boy pointing to a letter?
That's an a.

416
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.610
Now you've only got 25 more letters to go.

417
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:11.430
Sba just been gifted the process within a year he started college.

418
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.200
I know that seems almost too simple,
but envision for a second,

419
00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.850
a master practicing and exceedingly difficult craft and making it look

420
00:27:20.851 --> 00:27:25.590
effortless.
There's no strain,
no struggle,
so relaxed,

421
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:29.940
no exertion or worry,
just one clean movement after another.

422
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.710
That's a result of the process.
We can channel this too.

423
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:39.690
We needn't scramble like we're so often inclined to do when some difficult
tasks,

424
00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:40.530
it's in front of us.

425
00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.820
Remember the first time you saw a complicated Algebra equation?

426
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:49.650
It was just a jumble of symbols and unknowns,
but you then stopped,

427
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:53.640
took a deep breath and broke it down.
You isolated the variables,

428
00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:56.730
solve for them and all that's left was the answer.

429
00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:02.310
Do that now for whatever obstacles you come across.
We can take a breath,

430
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:07.290
do the immediate composite part in front of us and follow it's thread into the

431
00:28:07.291 --> 00:28:11.040
next action.
Everything in order,
everything connected.

432
00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:15.210
When it comes to our actions,
disorder and distraction or death,

433
00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:18.750
the unordered mind loses track of what's in front of it,

434
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.920
what matters and gets distracted by thoughts of the future,

435
00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:28.110
the processes order.
It keeps our perceptions and check and our actions in sync.

436
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:33.120
It seems obvious,
but we forget this when it matters most right now.

437
00:28:33.121 --> 00:28:36.480
If I knocked you down and pinned you to the ground,
how would you respond?

438
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.770
You'd probably panic and then you'd push with all your strength to get me off

439
00:28:40.771 --> 00:28:44.100
you.
It wouldn't work.
Just using my body weight.

440
00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:47.490
I would be able to keep your shoulders against the ground with little effort and

441
00:28:47.491 --> 00:28:51.780
you'd grow exhausted fighting it.
That's the opposite of the process.

442
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:57.390
There's a much easier way.
First,
you don't panic.
You conserve your energy.

443
00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:01.080
You don't do anything stupid like get yourself choked out by acting,

444
00:29:01.081 --> 00:29:04.710
without thinking.
You focus on not letting it get worse.

445
00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:08.730
Then you get your arms up to brace and create some breathing room,

446
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:13.350
some space now work to get your side from there.

447
00:29:13.351 --> 00:29:16.410
You can start to break down my hold on.
You grab an arm,

448
00:29:16.411 --> 00:29:20.130
travel leg buck with your hips and slide and in the end push away.

449
00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:24.270
It'll take some time,
but you'll get yourself out at each step.

450
00:29:24.271 --> 00:29:27.930
The person on top is forced to give a little up until there's nothing left.

451
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.153
Then you're free.

452
00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:33.810
Thanks to the process being trapped as just a position,

453
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.180
not a faith you get out of it.

454
00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:40.290
By addressing and eliminating each part of that position through small

455
00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.440
deliberate action,

456
00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:45.880
not by trying and failing to push it away with superhuman strength.

457
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.130
With our business rivals,

458
00:29:48.131 --> 00:29:51.610
we rack our brains that think of some mind blowing new product that will make

459
00:29:51.611 --> 00:29:55.150
them all irrelevant and in the process we take our eye off the ball.

460
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.970
We shy away from writing a book or making a film.

461
00:29:57.971 --> 00:30:00.790
Even though it's our dream because it's so much work,

462
00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:03.640
we can't imagine how to get from here to there.

463
00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:08.410
How often do we compromise or settle because we feel that the real solution is

464
00:30:08.411 --> 00:30:10.420
too ambitious or outside our grasp?

465
00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.590
How often do we assume that change is impossible because it's too big,

466
00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:17.830
involves too many different groups or worse?

467
00:30:17.831 --> 00:30:21.400
How many people are paralyzed by all their ideas and inspirations.

468
00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:25.960
They chased them all and go nowhere distracting themselves and never making

469
00:30:25.961 --> 00:30:29.770
headway there.
Brilliant,
sure.
But they rarely execute.

470
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.740
They rarely get where they want and need to go.

471
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:38.260
All of these issues are solvable.
Each would collapse beneath the process.

472
00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.970
We've just wrongly assume that it all has to happen at once and we give up.

473
00:30:42.971 --> 00:30:46.240
But the thought of it,
we are a to z thinkers.

474
00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:51.490
Fretting about a obsessing over z yet forgetting all about B through y.

475
00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:54.190
We want to have goals.
Yes.

476
00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.580
So everything we do can be in service as something purposeful.

477
00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:00.850
When we know what we were really setting out to do,

478
00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:05.650
the obstacles that arise tend to seem smaller and more manageable.
When we don't,

479
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.960
each one looms larger,
it seems impossible.

480
00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.590
Goals help us put the blips and bumps in their proper proportion.

481
00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:13.780
When we get distracted,

482
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:17.560
when we start caring about something other than our own progress and efforts,

483
00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:21.820
the process is the helpful if occasionally bossy voice in our head,

484
00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:26.440
it is the bark of the wise older leader who knows exactly who he is.

485
00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.600
And what he's got to do.
Shut up.

486
00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:32.680
Go back to your stations and try to think about what we're going to do ourselves

487
00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:36.910
instead of worrying about what's going on out there.
You know what?
Your job is,

488
00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:41.620
stopped John and get to work.
The processes,
the voice that demands,

489
00:31:41.621 --> 00:31:46.621
we take responsibility and ownership that prompts us to act even if only in a

490
00:31:47.051 --> 00:31:47.884
small way,

491
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:53.590
like a relentless machine subjugating resistance each and every way it exists.

492
00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:57.310
Little by little,
moving forward,
one step at a time.

493
00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:02.170
Subordinate strength to the process.
Replace fear with the process.

494
00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:07.030
Depend on it.
Lean on it,
trust in it.
Take your time.

495
00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:10.510
Don't rush.
Some problems are harder than others.

496
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:15.400
Deal with the ones right in front of you.
First,
come back to the others later.

497
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:20.320
You'll get there.
The process is about doing the right things right now,

498
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:24.790
not worrying about what might happen later or the results or the whole picture.

499
00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:31.330
Love everything that happens.
Uh,
more fatty.

500
00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:37.960
My formula for greatness and a human being is a more fatty that one wants

501
00:32:37.961 --> 00:32:41.360
nothing to be,
not forward,
not backward,

502
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:46.310
not in all eternity,
not merely bear.
What is necessary.

503
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:50.630
Still less conceal it,
but love it.
Nietzsche,

504
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:56.630
at age 67 Thomas Edison return home early one evening from another day at the

505
00:32:56.631 --> 00:32:59.630
laboratory.
Shortly after dinner,

506
00:32:59.631 --> 00:33:02.330
a man came rushing into his house with urgent news.

507
00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:06.680
A fire had broken out at Edison's research and production campus a few miles

508
00:33:06.681 --> 00:33:10.970
away.
Fire engines from the eight nearby towns rushed to the scene,

509
00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:15.470
but they could not contain the blaze fueled by the strange chemicals and the

510
00:33:15.471 --> 00:33:16.490
various buildings.

511
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:21.440
Green and yellow flame shot up six and seven stories threatening to destroy the

512
00:33:21.441 --> 00:33:22.430
entire empire.

513
00:33:22.431 --> 00:33:27.020
Edison had spent his life building Edison calmly but quickly,

514
00:33:27.021 --> 00:33:31.430
made his way to the fire through the now hundreds of onlookers and devastated

515
00:33:31.431 --> 00:33:35.750
employees looking for his son.
Go get your mother and all her friends.

516
00:33:35.751 --> 00:33:37.880
He told his son with childlike excitement,

517
00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:41.960
they'll never see a fire like this again.
What?

518
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:45.500
Don't worry,
Edison Calm Tim.
It's all right.

519
00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:50.120
We've just got rid of a lot of rubbish.
That's a pretty amazing reaction,

520
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:53.990
but when you think about it,
there really was no other response.

521
00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:57.980
What should Addison have done?
Wept,
gotten angry,

522
00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:02.540
quit and gone home.
What exactly would that have accomplished?

523
00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:04.730
You know the answer now.

524
00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:09.790
It's nothing so we didn't waste time indulging himself to do great things.

525
00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:13.190
We need to be able to endure a tragedy in setbacks.

526
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:17.690
We've got to love what we do and all that.
It entails good and bad.

527
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:23.230
We have to learn to find joy in every single thing that happens because there

528
00:34:23.241 --> 00:34:26.240
was a little more than rubbish in Edison's buildings.

529
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:31.610
Years and years of priceless records.
Prototypes and research were turned to Ash.

530
00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:36.620
The buildings which had been made of what was supposedly fireproof concrete had

531
00:34:36.621 --> 00:34:38.870
been insured for only a fraction of their worth,

532
00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.900
thinking that they were immune to such disasters.

533
00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:45.710
Edison and his investors were covered for about a third of the damage.

534
00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:48.770
Still,
Edison wasn't heartbroken,

535
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:53.390
not as he could have and probably should have been.
Instead,

536
00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:57.230
it all invigorated him as he told a reporter the next day.

537
00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.600
He wasn't too old to make a fresh start.

538
00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.630
I've been through a lot of things like this.

539
00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:06.470
He said it prevents a man from being afflicted with unweave.

540
00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:11.540
Within about three weeks,
the factory was partially back up and running.

541
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:14.960
Within a month.
It's men were working two shifts a day,

542
00:35:14.961 --> 00:35:17.570
churning out new products the world had never seen,

543
00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:23.260
despite a loss of almost $1 million more than 23 million in today's dollars,

544
00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:24.970
and it's an word Marshall,

545
00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:28.370
enough energy to make nearly $10 million in revenue that year.

546
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:30.830
200 plus million dollars today.

547
00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:34.280
He not only suffered a spectacular disaster,

548
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:37.430
but he recovered and replied to it spectacularly.

549
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:43.200
The next step after we discard her expectations and accept what happens to us

550
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.540
after understanding that certain things,

551
00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:47.940
particularly bad things are outside our control,

552
00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:53.210
is this loving whatever happens to us and facing it with unfailing cheerfulness.

553
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:58.920
It is the act of turning what we must do into what we get to do.

554
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.630
We put our energies and emotions and exertions where they will have real impact.

555
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:07.770
This is that place we will tell ourselves,

556
00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:11.610
this is what I've got to do or put up with.
Well,

557
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.260
I might as well be happy about it.

558
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:19.280
Here's an image to consider the great boxer Jack Johnson and his famous 15 round

559
00:36:19.741 --> 00:36:22.560
brawl with Jim Jefferies,
Jefferies,

560
00:36:22.561 --> 00:36:27.561
the great white hope called out of retirement like some deranged Cincinnatus to

561
00:36:27.751 --> 00:36:32.751
defeat the ascendent black champion and Johnson genuinely hated by his opponent

562
00:36:33.091 --> 00:36:37.890
in the crowd,
still enjoying every minute of it,
smiling,
joking,

563
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:40.470
playing the whole fight.
Why not?

564
00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:45.960
There's no value in any other reaction should he hate them for hating him.

565
00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:49.980
Bitterness was their burden and Johnson refused to pick it up.

566
00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.740
Not that he simply took the abuse.

567
00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:57.810
Instead Johnson designed his fight plan around it and every nasty remark from

568
00:36:57.811 --> 00:36:58.740
Jeffrey's corner,

569
00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:03.720
he'd give his opponent another lesson and every low trick or rush from Jeffrey's

570
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:07.170
Johnson would quip and beat it back,
but never lose his cool.

571
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:12.420
And when one well-placed blow open to cut on Johnson's lip,
he kept smiling.

572
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.250
A gory bloody,

573
00:37:14.251 --> 00:37:18.480
but nevertheless cheerful smile every round he got happier,

574
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:22.560
friendlier as his opponent grew,
enraged,
tired,

575
00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:27.030
eventually losing the will to fight in your worst moments.

576
00:37:27.031 --> 00:37:30.480
Picture Johnson always calm,
always in control,

577
00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.720
genuinely loving the opportunity to prove himself,

578
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:37.350
to perform for people whether they wanted him to succeed or not.

579
00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:42.330
Each remark bringing the response it deserved to no more letting the opponent

580
00:37:42.331 --> 00:37:46.740
dig his own grave until the fight ended with Jeffrey's on the floor and every

581
00:37:46.741 --> 00:37:50.190
doubt about Johnson silenced as Jack London,

582
00:37:50.191 --> 00:37:54.960
the famous novelist reported from the ringside seats.
No one understands him.

583
00:37:54.961 --> 00:37:57.000
This man who smiles well,

584
00:37:57.001 --> 00:38:01.860
the story of the fight is the story of a smile if ever a man one by nothing,

585
00:38:01.861 --> 00:38:05.220
more fatiguing than a smile Johnson one today.

586
00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:11.340
That man is us.
Or rather it can be us if we strive to become like him.

587
00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:16.410
For we're in our own fight with our own obstacles and we can wear them down with

588
00:38:16.411 --> 00:38:17.580
our relentless smile,

589
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:21.450
frustrating the people that were impediments attempting to frustrate us.

590
00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:26.400
We can be Edison,
our factory on fire,
not bemoaning our faith,

591
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:31.080
but enjoying the spectacular scene and then starting the recovery effort the

592
00:38:31.081 --> 00:38:33.840
very next day.
Roran back soon enough.

593
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:37.780
Your obstacle may not be so serious or violent,

594
00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:41.230
but they are nevertheless significant and outside your control.

595
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.660
They weren't only one response,

596
00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.950
a smile as the stoics commanded themselves.

597
00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.610
Cheerfulness in all situations,
especially the bad ones.

598
00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:56.290
Who knows where Edison and Johnson learn this epigram but they clearly did.

599
00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:00.880
Learning not to kick and scream about matters we can't.
Control is one thing.

600
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:05.350
Indifference and acceptance are certainly better than disappointment or rage.

601
00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:08.260
Very few understand or practice that art,

602
00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:12.460
but it is only a first step better than all of that.

603
00:39:12.461 --> 00:39:16.540
His love for all that happens to us for every situation.

604
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.500
The goal is not,
I'm okay with this,

605
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:23.200
not I think I feel good about this,

606
00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:28.330
but I feel great about it because if it happened that it was meant to happen and

607
00:39:28.331 --> 00:39:30.400
I am glad that it did when it did,

608
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:35.200
I am meant to make the best of it and proceed to do exactly that.

609
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:38.620
We don't get to choose what happens to us,

610
00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:41.230
but we can always choose how we feel about it.

611
00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:45.550
And why on earth would you choose to feel anything but good?

612
00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:51.250
We can choose to render a good account of ourselves if the event must occur.

613
00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:55.510
Uh,
more Fati.
A love of fate is the response.

614
00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:01.440
Don't waste a second looking back at your expectations face forward and face it

615
00:40:01.631 --> 00:40:02.890
with a smug little grin.

616
00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:07.120
It's important to look at Johnson and Edison because they weren't passive.

617
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:10.450
They didn't simply roll over and tolerate adversity.

618
00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:15.520
They accepted what happened to them.
They liked it.
It's a little unnatural.

619
00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:17.650
I know to feel gratitude for things.

620
00:40:17.651 --> 00:40:19.660
We never wanted it to happen in the first place,

621
00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:24.250
but we know at this point the opportunities and benefits that lay within

622
00:40:24.251 --> 00:40:28.720
adversities.
We know that an overcoming them,
we emerged stronger,

623
00:40:28.721 --> 00:40:33.040
sharper,
empowered.
There's little reason to delay these feelings,

624
00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:37.600
to be grudgingly acknowledged later that it was for the best when we could have

625
00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:40.300
felt that in advance because it was inevitable.

626
00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:46.240
You love it because it's all fuel and you don't just want fuel.
You need it.

627
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:50.620
You can't go anywhere without it,
no one or no thing can,

628
00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:52.360
so you're grateful for it.

629
00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:57.490
That is not to say that the good will always outweigh the bad or that it comes

630
00:40:57.491 --> 00:40:58.900
free and without cost,

631
00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:04.650
but there is always some good even if only barely perceptible at first contained

632
00:41:05.141 --> 00:41:09.100
within the bad and we can find it and be cheerful because of it.

633
00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:14.000
<v 0>Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

634
00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.970
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

635
00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:20.270
Do you want to get a short email from me?

636
00:41:20.271 --> 00:41:24.410
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

637
00:41:24.411 --> 00:41:28.370
little morsel of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very short

638
00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:32.900
email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been pondering

639
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:36.590
the week.
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

640
00:41:36.591 --> 00:41:40.070
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

641
00:41:40.071 --> 00:41:44.390
somehow dug up in the,
uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

642
00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:49.660
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

643
00:41:50.301 --> 00:41:53.030
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

644
00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:58.100
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend,

645
00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.350
so if you want to receive that,
check it out.

646
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:05.270
Just go to four hour work week.com that's four hour work week.com all spelled

647
00:42:05.271 --> 00:42:09.410
out and just drop in your email and you'll get the very next one and if you sign

648
00:42:09.411 --> 00:42:13.490
up,
I hope you enjoy it.
This episode is brought to you by [inaudible].

649
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:17.570
I am so thrilled to have connected with these guys because I've used teeter

650
00:42:17.571 --> 00:42:19.640
products for many,
many years.

651
00:42:19.641 --> 00:42:24.080
I've traveled around the country and the world with teeter products and I'm

652
00:42:24.081 --> 00:42:29.081
sitting about 15 feet in my home from one of their inversion tables and we're

653
00:42:30.111 --> 00:42:31.700
going to talk more about all of that.

654
00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:35.900
One of my rituals is hanging and I should say not really that it's a maintenance

655
00:42:35.901 --> 00:42:39.680
and performance program.
I hang not just in the morning potentially,

656
00:42:39.681 --> 00:42:42.740
but particularly after a day of bearing weight,

657
00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:46.850
whether that includes weight training and Jersey Gregorich world record holder

658
00:42:46.851 --> 00:42:51.470
insists on this type of inversion therapy after training or just wearing heavy

659
00:42:51.471 --> 00:42:56.180
backpack around.
A few minutes goes a long way towards better sleep.

660
00:42:56.181 --> 00:42:59.450
In my case,
less back pain,
neck pain,
leg pain.

661
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:01.490
It's not a panacea obviously,

662
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:05.300
but inversion therapy which uses gravity and your own body.

663
00:43:05.301 --> 00:43:08.960
We decompress the spine of the pressure on the discs and surrounding nerves

664
00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:14.380
seems to help with a whole slew of conditions and just as a general maintenance

665
00:43:15.231 --> 00:43:20.180
program.
It's one of my favorite things to do.
So what to say about that teeter?

666
00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:24.530
Why teeter teeter is the best known name in inversion table since 1981 more than

667
00:43:24.531 --> 00:43:27.590
3 million people have put their trust in teeter teeters.

668
00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:31.940
Also the only inversion table brand that has been both safety certified by

669
00:43:31.941 --> 00:43:35.600
underwriters laboratories.
That's a UL for you.
People in that industry,

670
00:43:35.601 --> 00:43:40.370
you will recognize it and registered with the FDA as a class one medical device

671
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:44.960
and they're giving a very special offer just to you guys,
my listeners,

672
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.823
for a limited time,

673
00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:48.500
you can get the teeter inversion table with bonus accessories,

674
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:53.510
which I have a bunch of again in the room next to me and a free pair of gravity

675
00:43:53.511 --> 00:43:57.040
boots so that you can invert at home or take the boots with you to the gems.

676
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:58.010
These gravity boots,

677
00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:03.460
I have three separate pair of gravity boots bought with my own monies in three

678
00:44:04.131 --> 00:44:05.990
different cities that I've had for a very,

679
00:44:05.991 --> 00:44:08.300
very long time because I don't want to travel with them necessarily.

680
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:12.440
It looked kind of like ski boots but without foot portion and they hook you

681
00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:16.100
upside down so you can take them if really anywhere you want to go to get this

682
00:44:16.101 --> 00:44:16.610
deal,

683
00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:21.610
which is a savings of over $148 it's very specific,

684
00:44:21.621 --> 00:44:26.621
so maybe it's 149 you have to go to teeter.com forward slash Tim,

what the hell is this thing that he's talking about?

692
00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:53.190
I can't even envision it in my head.
