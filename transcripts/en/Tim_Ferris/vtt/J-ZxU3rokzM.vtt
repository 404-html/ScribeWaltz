Extra work,
five days,

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.230
zero experience and the world's best teachers.

3
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.120
We need to clear the mind.
Yeah.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.750
Avoid Kasasa is take a chill pill like chilling.

5
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.750
I feel like I need to work on that pass punch.
I'm Tim Ferris,

6
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.180
best selling author and Human Guinea pig.

7
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.110
I'll show you how to make the impossible possible by bending the rules.

8
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.060
I'll find the world's best teachers and push myself to the edge to deconstruct,

9
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.253
decode,

10
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.660
and demystify some of the world's toughest challenges in record time if I can do

11
00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:45.860
it.
So can you.
