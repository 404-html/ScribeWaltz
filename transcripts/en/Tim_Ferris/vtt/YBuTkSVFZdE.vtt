Optimal at this altitude,

00:00:02.811 --> 00:00:06.020
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.890
You posted a question.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.550
I'm a cybernetic organism.

<v 1>This episode is brought to you by wealth.
Front.</v>

6
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.150
Wealth Front is the future of financial advice.

7
00:00:28.151 --> 00:00:32.560
They become incredibly popular among my friends in silicon valley and across the

8
00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:36.670
country because they provide the same high end financial advice that the best

9
00:00:36.671 --> 00:00:38.980
private wealth managers deliver it to the ultra wealthy,

10
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.360
but for any account size and at a fraction of the cost.
For instance,

11
00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:47.140
they monitor your portfolio every day across more than a dozen asset classes to

12
00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:51.370
look for opportunities to rebalance or harvest tax losses.
Now,

13
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.860
would you do the same?
Are you doing the same?
Probably not.

14
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.390
And the powers and the software wealth front now manages more than $4 billion in

15
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:03.330
assets,
which is up from around 2.5 billion.

16
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:05.040
When they started advertising on this podcast,

17
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.510
they're growing incredibly quickly.
Unlike old fashioned private wealth managers,

18
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:11.850
wealth front is powered by innovative technology,

19
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.590
making it the most tax efficient,
low cost,
hassle free way to invest.

20
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.300
They don't have bloated sales teams or retail locations so they can deliver all

21
00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:25.080
of this sophisticated financial advice and these services at a fraction of the

22
00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:28.440
cost of a traditional financial advisor.
So at the very least,

23
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.120
go to wealthfront.com forward slash Tim and take their free risk assessment

24
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:35.770
survey.
It only takes a couple of minutes and Wealthfront.

25
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.790
We'll recommend a personalized portfolio of investments.
In other words,

26
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:41.160
they'll tell you exactly where they would put your money,

27
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.230
so even if you don't use their service,

28
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:46.320
you have a huge leg up and you have additional information for making good

29
00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:47.154
decisions.

30
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.510
They use investment theory to automate good financial behavior and decisions

31
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.100
that people typically don't make,

32
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.370
but should so go to wealthfront.com forward slash Tim to get your first 15 k

this episode is brought to you by id,
commerce and logistics.

36
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.640
Known these guys for quite a while.

37
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:15.960
I'm asked all the time about how to scale businesses quickly and rule number one

38
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:19.380
is removing bottlenecks that slow you down and act as an emergency break.

39
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:20.214
For many companies.

40
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.180
One of the first things that should go is inventory management and fulfillment

41
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.680
ID.
Commerce and logistics focuses on helping online retailers and entrepreneurs

42
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.820
outgrow the competition by handling all of the behind the scenes details that

43
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:35.580
you don't want to,
they manage your inventory,
pick,

44
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:40.581
pack and ship and handle every possible logistics need so that you can focus on

45
00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:43.620
what you're good at and the other aspects of growing your business.

46
00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:46.980
I partnered with them myself during the launch of the four hour chef so that I

47
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:50.190
could focus on promoting the book what I'm good at and they insured.

48
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:51.390
They handled what they're good at.

49
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.490
That is keeping my readers happy with dozens of different products that needed

50
00:02:55.491 --> 00:02:59.490
to be shipped out during holiday crunch season before Christmas.

62
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:49.240
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

63
00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:54.070
it is my job to explore and deconstruct world class performers,

64
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:58.450
people who are at the best at what they do to tease out the belief systems,

65
00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:01.570
philosophies,
habits,
routines,
et Cetera,
that you can use.

66
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.960
This particular episode is different for a few reasons and I'm very excited

67
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:13.090
about it.
Number one,
we have our oldest guests to date 83 years,

68
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.470
which I want to do more of.

69
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.950
I want to really chronicle and investigate some of these treasures that we have

70
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.490
on this planet.
And uh,

71
00:04:22.491 --> 00:04:26.620
so I may also be going after Don Wildman soon.
If you don't know who that is,

72
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:28.900
you will shortly.
But this time around,

73
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:32.110
we have someone I've wanted to interview for decades.
Literally.

74
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.500
His name is doctor Philip Zimbardo at Phil Zimbardo on Twitter.

75
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.680
He's one of the most distinguished psychologists in the world and a professor

76
00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:43.360
emeritus at Stanford University.

77
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.550
He is arguably best known for his 1971 Stanford prison experiment in which

78
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:53.080
students were turned into mock prisoners and guards for continuous 24 hour a day

79
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:53.914
study.

80
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.030
This particular experiment was planned for two weeks but terminated after just

81
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:02.620
six days.
And we will dig into why that was the case.

82
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:06.460
And he gives a fantastic overview of this study.
In this podcast,

83
00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:10.150
we also explore how we as humans can do less evil.

84
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.440
How you can be a deviant for a day.
And I highly,
highly,

85
00:05:14.441 --> 00:05:16.750
highly encourage you all to try this.

86
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.170
And it's detailed in the conversation what mindful disobedience is in much more.

87
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.260
It was a real blast to finally get him on the phone after having read so much of

88
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:30.830
his work.
Apart from all of that,
uh,

89
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.780
Dr Zimbardo has served as president of the American psychological association

90
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.040
and designed and narrated the award winning 26 part PBS series,

91
00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:43.840
discovering psychology.
He's published more than 50 books.
What?
Including Shyness,

92
00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:45.700
the loose for a fact,
the time cure,

93
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.930
the time paradox and most recently man interrupted the time paradox is another

94
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:51.580
one that I recommend to everyone.

95
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.470
If you're a fan of the Tony Robbins Dickens process exercises outlined in tools

96
00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:57.740
of titans,
you will love that book.

97
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.270
Dr Zimbardo currently lectures worldwide and is actively working to promote his

98
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:03.620
nonprofit and trust me,

99
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:08.570
this guy at 83 is more active than almost every person I know.
So you will see,

100
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.360
I believe you will hear phone calls going on in the background.

101
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.090
He's traveling all over the world,
so don't let it distract you.
Anyway,

102
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.110
back to his current passion and focus,

103
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.330
the heroic imagination project,

104
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.860
heroic imagination.org his current research looks at the psychology of heroism.

105
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.600
The question he poses is what pushes some people to become perpetrators of evil

106
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.020
while others act heroically on behalf of those in need.

107
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.500
And that is precisely among many,

108
00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:40.970
many other things what we explore in this conversation.
So without further ado,

109
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:45.920
please enjoy a wide ranging conversation with doctor Philip Zimbardo

110
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.300
<v 2>doctors and Bartow.
Welcome to the show and it can be here.</v>

111
00:06:51.301 --> 00:06:52.500
Thank you for inviting me.

112
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.920
I have wanted to connect with you and speak with you and I don't say this to

113
00:06:57.931 --> 00:07:02.040
many people for many,
many decades.
In fact,
I was a,

114
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.200
at least for a period of time,

115
00:07:04.201 --> 00:07:09.201
a psychology major technically in neuroscience at Princeton and was actually a

116
00:07:10.321 --> 00:07:15.320
subject in some of the experiments of Danny condiments and I,

117
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.410
yeah,
I was indeed.

118
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.060
I tapped a space bar for a very long time and a very dark room and warring party

119
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:29.820
was very boring but hopefully contributed to to greater scientific progress in

120
00:07:29.821 --> 00:07:30.654
some fashion.

121
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.120
I thought I thought we could start with people who are not familiar with your

122
00:07:36.121 --> 00:07:37.190
work.
Uh,

123
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.850
when people think of Dr. Phillips in Bardo,

124
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.440
what do they tend to associate you most with in the world of psychology or

125
00:07:46.441 --> 00:07:47.274
science?

126
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
My legacy for better or for worse is he all Stanford prison experiment,

127
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.270
which I did back in 1971.

128
00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.720
I was recently in Budapest and I'm driving in a taxi and the taxi driver says,

129
00:08:04.561 --> 00:08:07.350
you sound like an American.
I said,
yeah.
I said,
what do you do?
I said,

130
00:08:07.351 --> 00:08:08.850
I'm a psychologist.
He said,

131
00:08:08.851 --> 00:08:12.600
did you ever hear that study where they put a colleague students in a prison

132
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.720
in Budapest,
Hungary as so,
yeah.
So it's,

133
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.510
it's uh,
what I'm most well known for because it was,
it w it is,

134
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:25.681
it was an,

135
00:08:25.681 --> 00:08:30.681
is the most dramatic study ever done in psychology in part because it went,

136
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.550
uh,
24,
seven.
Most research is just one hour.

137
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:43.740
Typically it fits into a student's curriculum schedule.

138
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.560
But this Po,
this research,
uh,

139
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:51.480
went on day and night for a week and it was supposed to go for two weeks.

140
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:52.260
Uh,

141
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:57.260
and so what was special about it is you could then see in other videos,

142
00:08:57.661 --> 00:09:01.380
we took the character transformation of hour by hour,

143
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:06.030
day by day of good kids,
be getting to do really bad things.

144
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:11.350
And these were the nine guards and nine prisoners to begin with.
Yeah.

145
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.180
So if you want me to give a thumbnail overview,
sure.

146
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:17.220
Let's get a just for those people not familiar.

147
00:09:17.221 --> 00:09:22.180
I think it'd be a great place to start.
Okay.
So the year is 1971.
Uh,

148
00:09:22.181 --> 00:09:23.840
it's the 70s,
uh,

149
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.750
exciting things that happening in psychology.
Um,

150
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.480
a little bit earlier at Yale,
um,

151
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:35.790
Stanley Milgrim who was my high school classmate and James Monroe high school in

152
00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:38.400
the Bronx and a 1950,

153
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.940
he had done the classic research on blind obedience to authority in which he got

154
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.430
mostly men ages 20 to 50,
not college students.
Um,

155
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.810
to play the role of teacher who is going to help students improve their memory

156
00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:56.460
by punishing errors.

157
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.290
And the way they would punish the era is by giving them escalating levels.

158
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:03.570
I will electric shock to their fingers.

159
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:09.140
And what happened is the confederate who was pretending to be the student of the

160
00:10:09.661 --> 00:10:14.661
teacher began after a while to yell and scream and say,

161
00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:18.330
I have a heart condition.
I don't want to go on.
And the question is,

162
00:10:18.331 --> 00:10:22.530
would anybody continue the experiment that kept saying to the,

163
00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:27.120
to the real participant,
you must go on,

164
00:10:27.121 --> 00:10:30.120
you have a contract,
you must continue teacher.

165
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:35.870
And the amazing thing is to have every three of these adults went all the way to

166
00:10:36.211 --> 00:10:40.740
a foreign and 50 roles,
which in a sense could have been lethal.
Uh,

167
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.300
I should back up and say,

168
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.260
when Milgrom asks 40 psychiatrists at Yale medical school,

169
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.370
what percent of all Americans would go to the,
to the bitter end?

170
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:55.680
Their estimate was 1% because to do so you'd have to be a psychopath.

171
00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.090
So they're only off by 74%.
And so,

172
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.980
so the point is it's two of every three.
Uh,
and so,

173
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:10.310
but his research was part of the demonstration of the power of social situations

174
00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:15.780
over individual dispositions.
And I follow it up.

175
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.400
Am I my team at Sanford,
Craig Haney and curt banks and David Jaffe.

176
00:11:20.401 --> 00:11:24.430
And I followed up by saying,
you know,
uh,

177
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:28.440
it's rare that somebody will tell you to do something horrible,
a dangerous,

178
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.640
typically you're playing a role and in the role and you're in a group and

179
00:11:32.641 --> 00:11:33.750
everybody is doing this.

180
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.490
So we reconceptualize the setting as a prison and weight goes,

181
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:43.491
prisons are all about power and guards have power and prisoners try to get some,

182
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.450
and guards tried to limit it,
their,
their,
um,
their attempts that power.

183
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:53.890
And so what we did is we put an ad in the Palo Alto newspaper wanted,
okay,

184
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.850
college students for study of prison life that could go up to two weeks.
And,

185
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.820
uh,
75 people answer the ad.
We interviewed,
each of them,

186
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:08.540
gave them a battery of personality tests and we picked two dozen who are normal

187
00:12:08.541 --> 00:12:11.930
and healthy in every way we could,
we could imagine.

188
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:16.980
And then what happened was we randomly assign half to be guards after the

189
00:12:16.981 --> 00:12:18.520
prisoners.
And,

190
00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.520
and in that setting they became prisoners or guards.

191
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.780
Now of course we made it realistic.
They had you in a different kind of uniforms.

192
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:30.800
Prisoners had symbols of power.
Billy clubs,
handcuffs,

193
00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.810
military style uniforms,

194
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.340
and the prisoners were in uniforms that simply had a number on it.

195
00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.490
We took away the name,
they became a,
they became the unionized.

196
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.180
And the amazing thing was in 36 hours,

197
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.200
a normal healthy college students.
And these are not students from Stanford,

198
00:12:48.201 --> 00:12:51.950
they were from all over the United States who were in the bay area finishing up

199
00:12:51.951 --> 00:12:55.430
summer school,
one of the prisoners,
eight six one,
two.

200
00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.030
I still remember if we really had an emotional breakdown,
screaming,

201
00:12:59.031 --> 00:13:01.850
crying out of control.
And,

202
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.380
and each day thereafter another prison,
I had a similar reaction.

203
00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.580
So we ended the study after five days because it was out of control.

204
00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:13.520
And we could not imagine that

205
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.330
that a social situation could have such a profound impact.

206
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:22.320
But what happened was the gardens really became creatively sadistic.

207
00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.440
There were three guards working eight hour shifts,
uh,

208
00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:30.370
and there were three shifts and they were nine prisoners at any one time,

209
00:13:30.371 --> 00:13:32.770
three in this cell.
And then the remaining,

210
00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:34.690
they were backup guards and backup prisoners.

211
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:40.020
And so the study ended on this very down node of good kids doing really bad

212
00:13:41.701 --> 00:13:45.240
things to each other,
creatively evil in the role of guard.

213
00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.520
<v 1>And this,</v>

214
00:13:46.521 --> 00:13:51.200
this has some very wide reaching implications.

215
00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.050
It would seem,
and you've written extensively about this,

216
00:13:55.670 --> 00:14:00.170
has relevance to many things that are happening in,

217
00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.530
in our modern day today,
including,
uh,
the,

218
00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:07.280
the Abu Ghraib prison scandal,
I suppose you could call it.

219
00:14:07.281 --> 00:14:10.330
And it was blamed on rogue soldiers.
But,
uh,

220
00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:14.960
you were one to point out that it was,
it was,
it was a bigger issue than that.

221
00:14:14.961 --> 00:14:19.910
It wasn't,
you couldn't necessarily isolate a few bad actors.
Uh,

222
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.010
it was more of a systemic issue.

223
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.230
<v 2>Yeah.
You hit it right on the head.
Is that for your lifted as well?</v>

224
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:29.770
Just go back in time and 2004,
someone released,

225
00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:30.660
<v 1>okay.</v>

226
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:34.880
<v 2>Pictures of American prison guards in Abu Ghraib,</v>

227
00:14:34.881 --> 00:14:38.930
prison in Iraq,
humiliating,
torturing,
degrading,

228
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:43.050
sexually abusing prisoners who they should have been protecting.

229
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:48.530
So these are images that came from the cameras of the guards themselves.

230
00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:54.130
And it was global disgrace to America at a time when the war in Iraq was,

231
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:59.060
was still a big,
big problem,
big issue.

232
00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:03.920
And,
uh,
and what happened was,
again,
I'll read through the military,
disowned it,

233
00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.160
say this,
their work,
a few bad apples.

234
00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:10.820
And curiously I was in Washington DC when that broke.
Uh,

235
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.960
I had been the president of the American Psychological Association and was there

236
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:18.440
on a,
on a followup visit.

237
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:23.240
And someone from National Public Radio had been my student at Stanford where I

238
00:15:23.241 --> 00:15:26.720
taught for 50 years,
call me and said,
hey,
hey doctorZ ,

239
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:31.930
those images that we just showed where the same as the images you showed us in

240
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:36.210
class of the president experiment.
Wow.
Uh,
uh,

241
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.970
putting bags over prisoners head stripping him naked,
et,

242
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:44.180
and so would you like to come on to be interviewed?
And I was,
and I simply said,

243
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:49.360
look at my hypothesis is that most American soldiers are good apples.

244
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And what we have to realize it someone put them in a bad barrel and we have to

245
00:15:55.341 --> 00:16:00.280
know who the bad barrel makers because that's who should be on trial.
Uh,

246
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:05.160
not,
not,
not the soldiers at the end of the line.
And that became a,

247
00:16:05.161 --> 00:16:07.040
an interesting metaphor.
Bad apples.

248
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:11.210
That's what's wrong with the individual versus bad barrels,

249
00:16:11.211 --> 00:16:13.100
which is the situational analysis.

250
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:16.430
And then of course the system is the bad barrel makers,

251
00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:20.450
the people who will make those situations and sustain them.

252
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:25.730
And then I actually defended shipped Frederick who is a staff sergeant who

253
00:16:25.731 --> 00:16:27.440
should have been in charge of the night shift,

254
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.850
but he too got sucked into different quality.
They was,

255
00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:36.980
they simply say we're having fun and games and they did not have any idea that

256
00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:39.410
the images that they took with their cameras,

257
00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.410
<v 1>uh,
would be released to the world.</v>

258
00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:44.800
And then a few follow up questions related to that.
Uh,

259
00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.740
and I suppose the big question in my mind is if,

260
00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:53.770
if you are someone who views themselves as a good person or at worst,

261
00:16:55.121 --> 00:16:58.430
a neutral person who doesn't want to do evil,
uh,

262
00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:03.750
how do you avoid the circumstances or the slippery slope of evil?

263
00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:06.130
Are there,

264
00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.760
are there things that you can keep in mind or reminders that you can set for

265
00:17:09.761 --> 00:17:10.594
yourself?

266
00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:16.480
Things you can avoid to help to mitigate that risk.

267
00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:18.540
<v 2>Now,
Abby,
I'm ethic.
Great,</v>

268
00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:23.500
great way to frame it is that evil is seductive.
Um,

269
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.593
in fact,

270
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:29.760
Christians around the world say to their god,

271
00:17:29.761 --> 00:17:34.450
lead us not into temptation.
Deliver us from evil.
Uh,

272
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.800
and the point is,
evil comes in many sizes,
many shapes.

273
00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.070
There is the evil of action doing bad things,

274
00:17:41.071 --> 00:17:43.900
but there's also the evil of inaction,
right?
Not,

275
00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.890
not doing the right thing when you could.
So this,

276
00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.370
this is what comes up in the bystander made famous,
uh,

277
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:56.720
I guess 60 years ago in New York City when a young woman was being assaulted,

278
00:17:57.451 --> 00:18:02.160
Kitty Genovese and screened and scream and people heard and no one came to her

279
00:18:02.161 --> 00:18:02.994
aid.

280
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:08.030
So the bystander metaphor is that people around the world do not come to the aid

281
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:15.640
of someone in an emergency who,
who needs their help.
Um,

282
00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:21.030
and so this is this,
these are fundamental themes is that,

283
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:22.020
uh,

284
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:27.020
it's so easy to cross the line and all the research done in psychology,

285
00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:32.490
the Milgram's study,
that Samara prison study and many,
many other experiment.

286
00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:37.560
The curious thing is even though the majority gives in complies,

287
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:41.550
conforms,
there was always a minority,
10% 20%,

288
00:18:41.551 --> 00:18:45.580
sometimes 30% who resists.
And so we,

289
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.600
I began to study what is it about those people who resist that temptation,

290
00:18:50.761 --> 00:18:52.110
the power of the group,

291
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.780
especially when everybody else in the group is doing and say,
come on,

292
00:18:54.781 --> 00:18:55.770
it's fun and games.

293
00:18:56.070 --> 00:19:01.070
And so I began to think of them as everyday heroes.

294
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.960
I wrote a book called the Lucifer effect.

295
00:19:03.961 --> 00:19:06.990
And the subtitle is understanding how good people turn evil.

296
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:11.220
And the book has 10 chapters on the prison study,
two chaps and I,
our grade,

297
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.910
and then a lot of chapters on evil around the world,

298
00:19:14.911 --> 00:19:19.170
Bosnia and Rwanda.
And then in the end,
um,
you know,

299
00:19:19.171 --> 00:19:20.490
I'm buried in evil.

300
00:19:20.491 --> 00:19:25.410
I mean it took two years to write the book and I'm swimming in a sea of evil and

301
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.460
it was so depressing every morning to sit at my desk,
let's say,
Oh my God,

302
00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:33.630
which evil am I going to deal with today?
So in Chapter 16,

303
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.390
if anybody in the audience has not read the book,

304
00:19:36.391 --> 00:19:38.520
start with 16 and work backwards.

305
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:44.150
So 16 is really celebrating the bay now witty of heroism in the same way that

306
00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:47.230
Hannah Arendt,
uh,

307
00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:51.310
in the trial of Otto if Eichmann in Jerusalem talked about,
uh,

308
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:55.620
Eichmann,
uh,
as illustrating the bay.
Now any of evil that is,

309
00:19:55.890 --> 00:20:00.180
here's a monster who orchestrated the deaths of millions of Jews who looks like

310
00:20:00.181 --> 00:20:03.070
your Uncle Charlie.
And you know,
we'll acts like,
well,

311
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.740
an intelligent uncle Charlie because he was in,
he was a,
you know,
a very formal,

312
00:20:07.741 --> 00:20:12.150
intelligent guy.
Uh,
but,
um,
and so I use that metaphor to say,
you know,

313
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:15.260
when we think about heroes,
we really,
you know,

314
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.790
think about classical hero's.

315
00:20:17.791 --> 00:20:20.340
We think about Agamemnon and Achilles.

316
00:20:20.341 --> 00:20:24.210
We think about modern heroes like Gandhi and Nelson Mandela,
Martin Luther King,

317
00:20:24.211 --> 00:20:27.840
Mother Teresa.
But those people are lifelong heroes.

318
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.150
What we should really be thinking,

319
00:20:30.151 --> 00:20:35.151
it's about ordinary people like any of us ordinary people who sometimes do extra

320
00:20:36.341 --> 00:20:39.210
ordinary deeds of goodness,
of kindness or compassion,

321
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:43.020
and we should think of them as heroes in training.

322
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:47.130
That is each day doing daily deeds of goodness and kindness.

323
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.330
That is not how ROIC in and of themselves,

324
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:52.400
but they really on a path toward heroism.

325
00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:57.790
And we what we think is those people when a big opportunity arises,

326
00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.850
when there is an earthquake,
when there is a terrorist attack,

327
00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.070
they will be the ones more likely,
uh,

328
00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.840
to take wise and effective action.
And,

329
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.850
and I embodied all of that in a new program.

330
00:21:11.851 --> 00:21:16.851
I started in San Francisco back in 2008 called the heroic imagination project or

331
00:21:18.191 --> 00:21:21.500
hip.
And the idea is heroism really starts in the mind.

332
00:21:21.501 --> 00:21:25.740
You have to think of yourself as I could be a hero rather than heroism is

333
00:21:25.741 --> 00:21:30.741
something that's a job of other people or is the job of of comic book

334
00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:31.640
characters.

335
00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:36.640
<v 1>And I'd love to dig into a few of the things that you just discussed.</v>

336
00:21:38.051 --> 00:21:41.410
So the first,
the first is,
and uh,

337
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:43.380
I love the,

338
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.790
the latter portion of talking about the everyday here on these components in

339
00:21:47.791 --> 00:21:52.230
part because I believe very much that if we're,

340
00:21:52.231 --> 00:21:55.050
if we're looking for,
I would say patterns of behavior,

341
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.240
I tend to agree with one of my favorite quotes,
which is arc,

342
00:21:58.241 --> 00:22:00.000
a locus who's a Greek poet.
And it is,

343
00:22:00.001 --> 00:22:02.190
we do not rise to the level of our expectations.

344
00:22:02.191 --> 00:22:03.630
We fall to the level of our training.

345
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:09.150
So if you're focusing on these daily behaviors on a micro level than the,

346
00:22:09.151 --> 00:22:11.070
the hope is that on a macro level,
like you said,

347
00:22:11.071 --> 00:22:14.520
when there's an earthquake and a disaster response or something like that,

348
00:22:14.521 --> 00:22:17.010
if you need to triage,
you'll be the one to take that step forward.

349
00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.890
I've looked at,
for instance,

350
00:22:19.891 --> 00:22:23.130
the Lucifer effect and some of the writing around it,

351
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:28.190
and I found a seven social processes that grease the slippery slope of evil.

352
00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.520
And,
and I'd love to just read these off and then ask a followup question.

353
00:22:32.521 --> 00:22:35.490
So the first is mindlessly taking the first small step,

354
00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.520
the second dehumanization of others,

355
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.330
third deindividuation of self.
And other words,
anonymity,

356
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:47.790
then diffusion of personal responsibility,
blind obedience to authority,

357
00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.410
uncritical conformity to group norms.
And then last week,

358
00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:55.530
which you mentioned the kind of error of the evil of omission,
not commission,

359
00:22:55.531 --> 00:22:58.380
that is passive tolerance of evil through inaction or indifference.

360
00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:03.970
Is it possible to become more heroic by doing the very opposite.

361
00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:10.430
So in other words,
making these imperatives the opposite.

362
00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:11.660
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

363
00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:16.360
So all of these I would embed in a broader context of okay,

364
00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:21.040
the importance of situational sensitivity,
situational awareness.

365
00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:26.610
So Milgrom and I highlighted the power of social situations and dominate

366
00:23:27.001 --> 00:23:30.810
personality.
But it doesn't mean it's,
it's ubiquitous,

367
00:23:30.811 --> 00:23:32.520
but it doesn't mean it's inevitable.

368
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.400
Step one is to realize your vulnerability.

369
00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:41.350
All of our vulnerability,
situational forces come in many different forms,

370
00:23:41.351 --> 00:23:43.420
many different shapes.
But it's,

371
00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:48.450
it's always to be mindful of what is happening around you because,

372
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:54.290
and just to be aware of that situational forces,
a group pressure,

373
00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:58.700
what other people are doing,
how you addressed what the situation is,

374
00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.160
can influence your behavior.
Um,

375
00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:05.030
and so some of the things that you had just mansion,

376
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:10.360
I really part of a greater sensitivity to things happening around you in the

377
00:24:11.031 --> 00:24:14.940
social situation rather than in the physical environment.
And if we,

378
00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.910
if we want to go through one,
one by one,

379
00:24:16.911 --> 00:24:20.810
I can just elaborate just a little bit on each.
Absolutely.
Yes please.

380
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:25.340
So number one was mindlessly taking the f the first small step.

381
00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:26.420
Yeah.

382
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:31.420
So the conclusion from the Milgram experiment should be all evil begins with 15

383
00:24:33.561 --> 00:24:36.020
wells.
So in the Milgram study,

384
00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:41.450
the participants had in front of them a big shock box that had 30 switches that

385
00:24:42.021 --> 00:24:46.220
began with 15 volts and increased by 15 bolt increments,

386
00:24:46.221 --> 00:24:51.221
1530 45 and of course there was a label above their mild shock,

387
00:24:51.321 --> 00:24:55.670
strong,
moderate shock,
et cetera.
But the key is,
you know,

388
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.450
imagine you're sitting in front of the shock box and you see at the end it says,

389
00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.190
danger high voltage,
350 volts,
you know,

390
00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:09.050
75,
450.
You have to say to yourself,

391
00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.540
you know,
when I pressed this first button,

392
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:16.590
what's going to keep me from continuing to press the next one and the next one,

393
00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:21.020
the next one,
and,
and then would I ever want to go to 40,
50 volts?

394
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.540
So obviously I wouldn't.
So,

395
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:26.450
but the point is once you press 15 vols,

396
00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:30.860
you are on that slippery slope of evil because it becomes easier and easier.

397
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:35.750
Uh,
and,
and when you press $15,
you know what?
Nothing happens.
The Guy,

398
00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.820
the guy is even notice it,

399
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:43.280
but 15 bolts then is really like the first time you cheat a little bit on a test

400
00:25:43.281 --> 00:25:44.114
in school.

401
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:49.580
The first time somebody tells you a sexist or racist joke and you either smile

402
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.280
or Giggle or laugh a little bit,
right.
Rather than say,

403
00:25:52.281 --> 00:25:55.610
I think that's inappropriate.
Um,
you know,
so again,

404
00:25:55.780 --> 00:26:00.780
it to be where that even though there's nothing truly negative in that first 15

405
00:26:02.001 --> 00:26:02.834
volts,

406
00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:07.360
it is literally on the path of what we consider a slippery slope would be.
Well,

407
00:26:07.361 --> 00:26:09.800
it's going to get,
it's going to be 35.
It's going to be,
I mean,

408
00:26:09.801 --> 00:26:13.520
it's going to be 75 it's going to be a hundred and then in two out of three

409
00:26:13.521 --> 00:26:17.540
cases,
it gets to be 450 volts.
Right.
So being,

410
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:22.630
being very aware of the seemingly harmless gateway drugs for sure down the

411
00:26:24.291 --> 00:26:25.910
slippery slope,
right?

412
00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.740
The number two is dehumanization of others.
Yeah.

413
00:26:30.741 --> 00:26:35.741
And the center of all prejudice of all discrimination is thinking about other

414
00:26:36.321 --> 00:26:40.520
people as less than human.
So in our prison experiment,

415
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:44.400
we took away people's names,
which is part of your humanity.

416
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:48.330
We replaced them with numbers.
They were,
they were eight,
six,
one,
two,
four,

417
00:26:48.331 --> 00:26:52.920
one six,
three,
six Oh nine.
And after a very short time,

418
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.360
for example,

419
00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:59.340
when a Catholic priests who had been a prison chaplain came to see the
prisoners,

420
00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:02.010
and by request he asked him,
what's your name,
son.

421
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:06.240
Almost all of them gave their number in a very short time.

422
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:11.250
They had accepted our dehumanization and became that number.
Now,

423
00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:15.760
uh,
that dehumanization takes other forms.
So by,

424
00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:17.370
by talking about,
uh,

425
00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:22.230
migrants rather than people who are migrating out of danger.

426
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:27.210
Talking about in San Francisco,
we have a big problem with the homeless.

427
00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:32.490
They're not homeless.
They are people who do not have a home.
So again,

428
00:27:32.491 --> 00:27:37.220
it's focusing on,
these are people in different circumstances of,

429
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.470
of tragedy.
But one shoe,
one shoe,

430
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:46.140
once you apply a label,
it's just like saying,
and these are,
you know,

431
00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:51.180
and for Italian swaps were a dirty Jew or something or that kind one.

432
00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:55.140
Once you put a label on other people,

433
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.850
you take away their humanity and then you,
you treat them as less than human.

434
00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:05.310
Yeah,
absolutely.
And I mean,
this is,
can proactively be done,

435
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:09.810
of course,
with those who orchestrate propaganda.
It's,
I mean,
it's,

436
00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.320
it's a meaning warfare,
wartime propaganda,

437
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:15.570
whether it's a Goebbels or if you look at some of the,

438
00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:21.390
the collateral that was created during World War II in the Pacific theater.

439
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.100
I mean,
it's on both sides.

440
00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:26.820
It's the of the objective is to dehumanize your soldiers are more effective in

441
00:28:26.821 --> 00:28:31.140
some cases.
Yeah.
Uh,
uh,
Sam Kane,
who's,
um,

442
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:36.240
I guess I would call them a social philosopher.
He lives nearby here in Marin.

443
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:39.540
He has a wonderful book called faces of the anime.

444
00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:44.960
And when he shows with graphic visuals that before any nation goes to war,

445
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:51.210
they prepare their people to hate the other,

446
00:28:51.211 --> 00:28:56.211
the enemy by having these visual depictions of them as less than human.

447
00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:57.960
Uh,

448
00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:02.960
and then in the end it's mothers are willing to send their sons toward

449
00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:08.280
potentially die to protect them from the end,
quote the enemy.

450
00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:13.350
Um,
so it's really a critical,
critical aspect.
Now,

451
00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:15.390
uh,
I'm jumping ahead.

452
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:20.110
One of the ways that I work to prevent that is I am distressed and yeah,

453
00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.840
especially now in San Francisco with,
and we have cold and rain.
No,

454
00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:28.860
we have hundred,
I don't know,
7,000 homeless people on the street.

455
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:33.090
Many old ladies,
sometimes families.
So each day I decide,

456
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.220
am I going to give him 50 cents a dollar?

457
00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.340
But I don't just give money to a homeless person,

458
00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:43.150
but I do is I try to human eyes them I will pick someone and yeah,

459
00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:47.530
in the street and then simply say hello,
I'm sure as a Marta,
what's your name?

460
00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:52.480
And they're often surprised.
I shake their hand.
I give them a doll,
I say I,
I,

461
00:29:52.481 --> 00:29:55.960
you know,
I wish it could be more hope your luck improves.

462
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:59.100
And I take one minute to make,

463
00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:03.490
to convert that dehumanizing experience until human one.
Yeah.

464
00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:08.860
And I had an occasion recently where a woman began to cry mean cause no one,

465
00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:13.880
no one had done that sympathy.
Okay.
Number three,

466
00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:15.043
<v 1>individuation.</v>

467
00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:15.961
<v 2>Yeah.
So I,</v>

468
00:30:15.961 --> 00:30:19.960
I did early research when I was at New York University before I came to
Stanford.

469
00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:24.110
Simply putting people in mass,
putting people in hoods,

470
00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:28.440
taking away their visual,
their visual sense,
putting them in the dark.

471
00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.780
It's a Mardi gras effect.

472
00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:36.560
We are able to show that when your identity is removed and you're in a situation

473
00:30:36.941 --> 00:30:41.830
that gives you permission to be harmful,
aggressive,
you will take it.

474
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.820
So we did an experiment at New York University where we had college,

475
00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:50.970
female college psych one females who half of them we put in hoods and we took

476
00:30:51.911 --> 00:30:54.760
away the name.
They came the one,
two,
three,
four and a half of them.

477
00:30:54.761 --> 00:30:59.530
We made feel special.
And then they had the opportunity to give electric shock.

478
00:30:59.531 --> 00:31:02.440
They thought to other women who are trying to,

479
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.570
to remember material under stress.

480
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:11.130
And what we've found is college women gave twice as much electric shock to other

481
00:31:12.161 --> 00:31:15.730
women when they were de individuated than when they were not.

482
00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:21.010
And so when you're anonymous,
uh,
it takes away again this length,

483
00:31:21.011 --> 00:31:23.590
another point,
your sense of personal responsibility.

484
00:31:23.591 --> 00:31:26.800
No one knows and no one cares.
Now again,

485
00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.970
it goes both ways in the Mardi gras.

486
00:31:29.971 --> 00:31:34.950
If you're in a situation of fun and pleasure and enjoyment and lost,

487
00:31:34.951 --> 00:31:39.010
if you will,
uh,
people will go that direction.
So it means that

488
00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:44.840
Dee Dee individuation takes away your central organizing principle of I am

489
00:31:47.201 --> 00:31:48.700
responsible for my actions.

490
00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:52.060
And essentially you then go with the flow for better or for worse,

491
00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:52.971
<v 1>right?</v>

492
00:31:52.971 --> 00:31:57.971
It removes the social inhibitions regardless of the,

493
00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:02.300
the particular type or species of,
of impulse,

494
00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:06.200
whether it's towards lust or aggression or otherwise.
The next you,

495
00:32:06.201 --> 00:32:10.160
you already alluded to in a sense is diffusion of personal responsibility.

496
00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:10.821
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

497
00:32:10.821 --> 00:32:15.821
So this ties into what we talking about bystander effect is that ordinarily we

498
00:32:16.731 --> 00:32:21.300
each feel responsible for
our actions.

499
00:32:21.301 --> 00:32:23.790
We feel responsible for people around us.

500
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:27.470
Certainly our friends and family neighbors.
And again,

501
00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:32.010
my hero project tries to extend that to say,
you know,
the world is by neighbors.

502
00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.060
A world is,
it could be my friends.

503
00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:38.620
And all of the research on the fusion responsibility simply says that

504
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:39.560
<v 1>yeah,</v>

505
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:43.960
<v 2>when you see other people like you passing by someone in need,</v>

506
00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:48.620
then they,
they create a social norm of doing nothing.

507
00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.890
When you know,
you should be doing something and something,
sometimes it's very,

508
00:32:52.891 --> 00:32:56.280
very simple,
uh,
helping somebody up who swollen down.

509
00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:01.600
And so it's something that we have to guard against is that not allowing the

510
00:33:01.981 --> 00:33:06.981
social norm of other people being a bad Samaritans to change,

511
00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:12.160
uh,
your,
your sense it'd be a good Samaritan.
Okay.
Now,

512
00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:13.410
one of the things,

513
00:33:13.411 --> 00:33:18.411
there's a fascinating study I bet you probably know about it was done by John

514
00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:23.230
Darley and his student,
Daniel Batson.
And it was that Princeton,

515
00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.900
Princeton theological seminary where,
uh,

516
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:30.580
what they did was they got a bunch of Princeton theological students,

517
00:33:30.581 --> 00:33:34.500
kids who are going to become ministers.
And they said,

518
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:39.710
we're studying the power of sermons and we'd like you to give this sermon on the

519
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:40.591
Good Samaritan.
Do you know that?

520
00:33:40.591 --> 00:33:44.730
Of course they know that and we want you to go to from the psych lab,

521
00:33:44.731 --> 00:33:48.690
goes to the recording studio,
which is down down this alleyway.

522
00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.370
And when you get there,
there'll be waiting for you.

523
00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:55.510
And we just have to record your best sermon about the Good Samaritan.

524
00:33:56.050 --> 00:34:00.100
So here at good guys,
Princeton theological student,
that maybe good girls too,

525
00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:05.550
who thinking about being a good Samaritan and on the way they encounter a women

526
00:34:06.821 --> 00:34:11.340
in a,
in a hallway,
an alleyway,
moaning.
Clearly Anita.

527
00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:13.420
Now do they help?

528
00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:18.610
It turns out they help if they are told,

529
00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:23.140
you know,
you have enough time.
If they told you are late,

530
00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.100
please hurry.

531
00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:29.440
An 80% passed her by 80% of the people trends at the logic on the way to give

532
00:34:31.871 --> 00:34:35.470
the good Samaritan turn out to be bad Samaritans if they're in a hurry.

533
00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.671
So for me,

534
00:34:36.671 --> 00:34:41.080
that's such an important message these days where everybody is in a hurry.

535
00:34:41.081 --> 00:34:45.550
We're all,
we all feel time press even worse.
We don't even notice somebody,

536
00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.680
uh,
moaning in a corner because we're looking at,
we're walking,

537
00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:54.680
looking at our iPads,
our iPhone or Ipad,
uh,
and holding a Starbucks.

538
00:34:54.681 --> 00:34:55.514
And the other hand,

539
00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:57.160
<v 1>no,
absolutely.
This has,</v>

540
00:34:57.430 --> 00:35:00.640
this has a bunch of different paths we could travel in this conversation.

541
00:35:00.641 --> 00:35:02.830
I do want to talk more about time a little bit later,

542
00:35:02.831 --> 00:35:06.220
but just to return to the diffusion of personal responsibility,

543
00:35:06.221 --> 00:35:10.620
this also has tremendous implications for say,
uh,

544
00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:15.840
in this relates to the bystander effect,
but disaster response.
And,
uh,

545
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:20.470
uh,
as one example I did training here in northern California for nurture,

546
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:25.180
which I believe stands for northern California emergency response training or

547
00:35:25.181 --> 00:35:25.810
team.

548
00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:30.810
And the San Francisco lacks the right municipal resources to respond to say a

549
00:35:31.691 --> 00:35:34.720
catastrophic,
very high level,
uh,

550
00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:39.570
earthquake for instance.
They don't want to have the fire engines and,
uh,

551
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.990
medical resources to contend with a catastrophe of that scale.

552
00:35:43.991 --> 00:35:45.870
So they train volunteers,

553
00:35:45.871 --> 00:35:49.440
the fire department and Police Department train volunteers to help in such a

554
00:35:49.441 --> 00:35:50.274
case.

555
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:55.390
And one of the things that they teach is in a group emergency triage situation.

556
00:35:56.601 --> 00:35:57.160
If your team,

557
00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:01.550
if you decide to take control of that situation and try to lead that,

558
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:02.570
you never,

559
00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:06.830
that you always identify individuals in the group first and assign them specific

560
00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:10.250
tasks.
You and you get their attention.
Do this,

561
00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:13.670
you do that because if it's a generic command to the group,

562
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:15.680
nothing's going to happen.

563
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:20.610
<v 2>Yeah.
You again,
for your list,
if we turn it around,</v>

564
00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:22.620
if you are ever the victim,

565
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:25.590
if you are ever heard and there are people around you,

566
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:29.790
the way you get help is you simply say,
you,
you,

567
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:34.710
you point at someone,
you w with the,
with the green dress,
you with,
uh,

568
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:39.770
uh,
the,
uh,
uh,
Brown blazer or you,
you red head.

569
00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:43.800
So you single them out and you break down that,
that,
uh,

570
00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:47.400
anonymity of the group and you're much more likely to get help.

571
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:49.190
So what they're telling you know,

572
00:36:49.191 --> 00:36:52.450
what they're telling you in terms of being an emergency.
Respond.

573
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:56.610
I'm saying if you,
the victim,
the same principle holds absolutely.

574
00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:00.990
The next is blind obedience to authority.
Well,
it say again,

575
00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:06.340
we are all trained as children to obey our parents.

576
00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.770
Our teachers,
uh,
are,
uh,

577
00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:12.910
religious leaders in some cases our politicians.

578
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:18.150
But nobody teaches us the distinction between authorities that deserve our

579
00:37:18.521 --> 00:37:23.230
respect and authorities that do not,
not all parents,

580
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:27.260
not all ministers.
We certainly know from the,
uh,
um,

581
00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:33.090
horrific consequences of sexual abuse by thousands of Catholic priests over

582
00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:39.220
dozens of years that a lot of,
lot of such people don't deserve our respect.

583
00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:44.090
But no way do we get training in differentiating,
you know,

584
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:47.060
uh,
appropriate from inappropriate authorities,

585
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:50.720
authorities that deserve respect versus authorities that deserve defiance.

586
00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:56.060
And so,
again,
I think in most societies we ere the direction of,
well,

587
00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:58.220
you know,
just obey authority.

588
00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:03.390
And an amalgam studies shows how easy it is for that to get overextended.

589
00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:07.930
So the authority in the Milgram study,
it was a guy in a white lab coat.

590
00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:12.610
He was actually a high school biology teacher.
He had,
he,

591
00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:15.770
he knew nothing about psychology.
He was just recruited by him.

592
00:38:15.771 --> 00:38:20.110
Milgrom and here he had,
uh,
uh,
milk and Milgram's study.

593
00:38:20.111 --> 00:38:22.910
They tested a thousand people.

594
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:27.740
So here he had hundreds and hundreds of adults in new haven,

595
00:38:27.741 --> 00:38:32.190
Connecticut blindly following his orders.
The shock more and more.
Okay.

596
00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:37.060
And he was not an expert.
He just had the,
the white lab coat of,

597
00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:40.110
of science.
So again,
it's,

598
00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:44.850
it's be wary of authorities wearing false lab coats.

599
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.720
<v 1>Is there,</v>

600
00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:50.460
is there any particular recommendation that you would have for someone who wants

601
00:38:50.461 --> 00:38:54.300
to train themselves to

602
00:38:56.050 --> 00:39:00.670
more consciously questioned or assess authority?

603
00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:05.350
Is there any type of mental practice that you have for yourself or question that

604
00:39:05.351 --> 00:39:07.990
you asked yourself on a regular basis to help with that?

605
00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:12.970
I think this is a very divisive problem that we have in the United States and

606
00:39:12.971 --> 00:39:15.790
certainly not limited to the United States right now in many respects.

607
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:21.270
But if somebody wanted to train themselves to be better at avoiding blind

608
00:39:22.781 --> 00:39:24.460
obedience to authority,
is there any,

609
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:26.260
any particular recommendation you would have?

610
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.440
<v 2>Yeah,
I think it's again,
questioning.
I mean,</v>

611
00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:34.660
legitimately questioning to say,
uh,
uh,
uh,
why should I do that?

612
00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.850
What are the positive consequences if I do it?

613
00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.830
What are the negative consequences of,
I don't,

614
00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:44.960
rather than assuming if somebody says do that because they are an authority,

615
00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:50.210
um,
that without debt directly questioning their authority or power.

616
00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:52.290
I think you have,
they have,

617
00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:57.940
the burden has to be on them to be willing to explain to you why you should,

618
00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:02.270
you should do what they say and they have to give you a good enough reason.

619
00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.180
And it can't be because I said so.
I mean,
again,

620
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:09.470
many parents say you have to do it because I said so.
Well,

621
00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.210
at some point you have to say that's not a reason.
You know,

622
00:40:12.211 --> 00:40:15.920
that that's an opinion.
That's an authority.
Um,
and,
and that,

623
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:18.470
and then ultimately you have to be willing to challenge it.

624
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:22.220
And when you're challenged,
it's already there will,
there will be some penalties.

625
00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:26.120
You know,
if you're a kid,
you get slapped in the face by it,
by your parents,

626
00:40:26.121 --> 00:40:28.160
you get,
but I still,
you have to,

627
00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:31.400
I think you'd have to practice mindful disobedience,

628
00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:33.570
<v 1>mindful disobedience.
I like that.</v>

629
00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.050
The next is uncritical conformity to group norms.

630
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:42.800
<v 2>Yeah.
All of us as,
especially as teenagers,</v>

631
00:40:42.801 --> 00:40:45.240
when reforming our identities,

632
00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:50.180
when nothing in the world is more important to be popular tab kids like us,

633
00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:54.330
uh,
that we are willing to become them,
uh,

634
00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:59.100
that we dress like them.
The music we like is there music,
our hair,

635
00:40:59.101 --> 00:41:02.070
whether we have tattoos,
whether we have piercing,
you know,

636
00:41:02.071 --> 00:41:06.300
all depends on who our peer group who are in group is.

637
00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:11.350
And the problem is they begin to have enormous power over us.

638
00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:16.390
So if you're a peer group begins to smoke den Kansas,

639
00:41:16.391 --> 00:41:19.960
are you going to be smoking?
And if you start smokey,
you're going to die young.

640
00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:24.870
If they are taking drugs,
you not only take dry,
you take their kind of drug,

641
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:29.650
uh,
if they are discriminating against God,
it's guys discriminate against girls.

642
00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:34.070
Uh,
you do the same if they discriminating against,
you know,
uh,

643
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.030
outside is um,
uh,
people different than you.
So

644
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:44.210
boobs have enormous power to shape our behavior,
our way of thinking,

645
00:41:44.211 --> 00:41:46.730
our attitudes as an individual.

646
00:41:46.731 --> 00:41:51.731
You have to separate out what parts of that group am I willing to go along with

647
00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.440
because I want to be accepted.
I don't want to be rejected.

648
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:57.710
And what parts are unacceptable.
That is,

649
00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:03.110
I should be willing to be rejected rather than to,
um,
uh,

650
00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.360
to do some of the things that they would like me to do.

651
00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:10.600
One way to be aware of the influence people have on you is to be a deviant for a

652
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.540
day.

653
00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:16.540
And the simplest thing to do is you put on with a magic marker that is erasable

654
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:22.130
a square on your forehead
and that once you put it on,

655
00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:22.611
you know,

656
00:42:22.611 --> 00:42:25.310
you look in the mirror and you see where it is and then you don't see it
anymore.

657
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.390
And people are going to say,
what is that?
It's this,
it's nothing.
It's a square.

658
00:42:29.391 --> 00:42:30.770
I'm just trying something out.

659
00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:35.150
UV intensity very quickly how people put pressure on you to take it off.

660
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:37.550
You're not different,
you're not different in any way,

661
00:42:37.551 --> 00:42:39.140
just a little mark on your forehead.

662
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:44.680
And so what we find is very difficult to resist the temptation to just wipe it

663
00:42:44.931 --> 00:42:48.260
off because then you're doing what they want you to do.

664
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:53.060
And the idea is if we can resist one day,
eight hours,

665
00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:58.100
then suddenly you realize you have this inner power to be your own person.

666
00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:02.660
And,
and especially that with parents.
I mean mothers get crazy,
you know,

667
00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:05.260
you're your best friend eve and said,
come on and take it off here.

668
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:08.900
It's you're embarrassing them.
But you know,
by extension,

669
00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:13.910
so I invite your list is to try that game of being a deviant for a day.

670
00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:19.400
Simply put a square with a magic eraser,
a magic mark on your forehead,

671
00:43:19.401 --> 00:43:24.401
a small square a and keep it on for a day and just notice first the pressure

672
00:43:25.161 --> 00:43:29.660
people put on you to be what they want you to be taken off and you'll feel the

673
00:43:29.661 --> 00:43:31.640
temptation they'd do what they want you to do.

674
00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:37.170
But the learning message is that be sensitive to the pressure of people put on

675
00:43:38.451 --> 00:43:43.250
you to be what they want you to be in other ways to like their kind of music

676
00:43:43.251 --> 00:43:47.810
they dress the way they do,
to share in their political views,

677
00:43:47.811 --> 00:43:51.770
et cetera.
I used to have my students at Stanford do things like that,

678
00:43:51.771 --> 00:43:54.230
but also dress,
dress up if you usually dress down,

679
00:43:54.231 --> 00:43:57.020
dress down if you usually dress up or do you just do some,

680
00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:01.640
some weird stuff and watch how people get really upset at you.

681
00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:06.940
For very small deviations from what they think is ordinary and normal.

682
00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:10.430
So I love,
I love this type of exercise and I,

683
00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:15.640
I want to double down and encourage just like you did listeners to try this

684
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:22.520
deviant for a day with the,
with the square,
the erasable is important folks.

685
00:44:22.521 --> 00:44:26.750
So do this with a sharpie on your forehead and take a photo,

686
00:44:26.751 --> 00:44:30.290
put it on social.
Tell us what happened because I appreciate that.
Yeah,

687
00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.130
absolutely.
Because these,
these types

688
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:37.080
<v 1>of,
uh,
I've called them comfort challenges in the past I think are so,</v>

689
00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:39.090
so critical.
I've had,
for instance,

690
00:44:39.091 --> 00:44:43.860
some of my readers before go to a Starbucks and just lay down on the floor for

691
00:44:43.861 --> 00:44:46.890
five seconds and then get back up and a people behave.

692
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:52.640
Doing something like that helps you to inoculate yourself against harmful

693
00:44:54.031 --> 00:44:54.864
conformity.

694
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:59.900
And it also makes me think a lot of a Keto,

695
00:45:00.391 --> 00:45:01.260
for instance,

696
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:06.210
considered the best or the perfect stoic by Seneca and others who would

697
00:45:06.211 --> 00:45:07.920
deliberately wear,
say,

698
00:45:07.921 --> 00:45:12.921
tunics of unfashionable colors to subject himself to ridicule so that he would

699
00:45:13.771 --> 00:45:17.340
learn to be ashamed of only those things worth being ashamed of.

700
00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:20.580
So I love this idea.
I love,
I absolutely love it.

701
00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:24.780
The last one is passive tolerance of evil through inaction or indifference.

702
00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:29.810
<v 2>Yeah.
So that ties into that.
If you share responsibility,
again,</v>

703
00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:34.370
there's evil of action doing bad things,
bullying,

704
00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:39.660
uh,
hearing,
uh,
prejudice points of view.
But there's also,

705
00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:44.220
um,
I'm not doing it yourself,
but accepting by others.

706
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:49.820
I always think of the case of my uncle Charlie who at family gatherings would

707
00:45:50.821 --> 00:45:52.710
tell the same jokes.
Uh,

708
00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:57.750
it was either a sexist jokes or racist jokes and after awhile people would be

709
00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:03.360
horrified,
but no one would say to Uncle Charlie,
I wish you wouldn't do it.

710
00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:08.900
And so one of the issues is how do you have courageous conversations with people

711
00:46:09.571 --> 00:46:12.570
like Uncle Charlie who may,

712
00:46:12.571 --> 00:46:16.140
is probably unaware of the negative impact he's having.

713
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:18.080
A partly has been telling this,

714
00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:21.450
these jokes for years and years when it was more socially acceptable.

715
00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:26.190
And how do you have a courageous conversation,
for example,
to say she,

716
00:46:26.191 --> 00:46:27.750
Uncle Charlie,
I love the way you got it.

717
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:32.910
I love the way you try to make us all feel happy and relaxed and tell jokes.

718
00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:38.300
But maybe you should tell a different kind of joke because some people wouldn't

719
00:46:38.491 --> 00:46:41.480
understand what you mean about black people or,

720
00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:46.610
or women with whether or not to have big breasts.
No.
Uh,
and,

721
00:46:46.611 --> 00:46:48.240
and I think we're going to like it even more.

722
00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:53.590
So the key is you want to change behavior and the key without the person

723
00:46:54.361 --> 00:46:58.500
becoming defensive and really saying,
you know,
you know,
screw you,

724
00:46:58.501 --> 00:46:59.610
I do whatever I want.

725
00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:03.920
<v 1>No,
it's,
um,
reminds me of a few things.</v>

726
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:08.580
There's a quote that I really like from Ayaan Hirsi Ali,
she's equate,

727
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:11.450
which is a tolerance of intolerance,
is cowardice.

728
00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:17.290
And I think that that is certainly one way to look at it.

729
00:47:17.691 --> 00:47:22.460
And there's a,
there's a book that is very helpful and it's,

730
00:47:22.461 --> 00:47:26.870
it's,
it might seem to be not directly related,
but it does tie in nicely.

731
00:47:26.871 --> 00:47:31.240
There's a book called lying by,
it's a very short book by Sam Harris,

732
00:47:31.241 --> 00:47:35.140
who's a neuroscience phd.
Yeah,
I know him.
Yes.
And it's,
it's,
it's a,

733
00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:40.290
it's a fantastically powerful and concise book about the damage done by white

734
00:47:41.411 --> 00:47:46.000
lies or not speaking truth.
Right.
And it is,
uh,
it is,

735
00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:49.590
it is a really powerful,
uh,

736
00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:54.250
dense tome in,
in the best possible way.

737
00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:57.460
I'd love to if,
if,
uh,
if we have some time to explore it.

738
00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:02.760
I'd love to talk about the time paradox.
Oh,
sure.
Time came up,
uh,

739
00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:07.840
in if in a few cases earlier and the importance and impact of perception of time

740
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:11.500
in the case of the,
the goods,
the,
the,

741
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:16.510
the would be good Samaritans who when rushed 80% running by the person in need.

742
00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:22.800
And,
uh,
I think you've written this,
that every significant choice,

743
00:48:22.801 --> 00:48:25.680
every important decision we make is determined by our perception of time.

744
00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:30.420
This is something I'd like to explore.
Could you please describe for people the,

745
00:48:30.421 --> 00:48:34.040
uh,
the time paradox and,
and,
and uh,

746
00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:38.670
perhaps just to give them an overview of why you wrote that book.
Happy to do it.

747
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:43.640
<v 2>The reason that I called my book,
the time paradox,
which I wrote with John Boyd,</v>

748
00:48:43.641 --> 00:48:48.641
who now I was like a Stanford graduate student now works for Facebook is it's a

749
00:48:49.311 --> 00:48:54.311
paradox because we're arguing that the most important influence on all your

750
00:48:55.221 --> 00:48:59.920
decisions are the big ones,
the small ones and decisions it will lead with liens.

751
00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:05.110
Ut or actions is something inside of you that you're unaware of and what it is.

752
00:49:05.991 --> 00:49:07.820
It's your sense of time,

753
00:49:07.821 --> 00:49:12.821
perspective and time perspective is the way you categorize and partition.

754
00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:19.690
You are sensitive time into categories of the big ones,
that past,
present,

755
00:49:19.691 --> 00:49:20.524
and future.

756
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:25.990
And what what we've discovered is it's much more complex and subtle so that all

757
00:49:26.151 --> 00:49:31.100
of us live in multiple time zones.
For some of us,

758
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:35.660
if I ask you,
tell me about your past,
uh,

759
00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:38.270
tell me your recollections of your childhood.

760
00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:42.500
Tell me your recollections of what happened last year.
But some people,

761
00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:46.760
their answers are always focused around all,
it's a good thing.
Okay,

762
00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:50.640
good times,
good awards,
successes,
birthday parties.

763
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.830
For others it's all the negatives,
failures,
regrets,

764
00:49:54.831 --> 00:49:58.640
things you could've done should have done abuse of various ways.

765
00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:04.190
And we now categorize those as people who live in the past,

766
00:50:04.191 --> 00:50:05.930
positive or pass negative.

767
00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:10.310
And then when I asked you about your present for some people,

768
00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:15.260
people we call it present heatedness,
we'll outline all the fun things they do,

769
00:50:15.261 --> 00:50:19.580
all the pleasures they get out of life,
seeking knowledge,
seeking sensation,

770
00:50:19.581 --> 00:50:23.220
seeking novelty.
Uh,
other people are present.

771
00:50:23.221 --> 00:50:26.070
Fatalists they say it doesn't pay to plan for the future.

772
00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:29.720
I don't control my life is controlled by faith.
And this is true.

773
00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:34.610
If you're a Muslim,
Allah controls your future.
Now,

774
00:50:34.611 --> 00:50:35.750
there are two ways in the future.

775
00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:40.680
So once future orientation is probably most of your listeners,
uh,

776
00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:46.110
focus on what do I have to do now to achieve objectives and goals that will take

777
00:50:47.901 --> 00:50:52.310
place in the future.
So these are positive future,
a future of hope,

778
00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:54.870
future possibilities.
Um,

779
00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:57.920
there's two other ways to be future oriented.

780
00:50:57.921 --> 00:51:02.240
One is future negative that you're anxious.
Will I be able to see,

781
00:51:02.241 --> 00:51:04.070
will I be able to achieve?
Uh,

782
00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:09.080
and so the future instead of being filled with hope is filled with anxiety.

783
00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:14.690
And a third way to be future oriented is we called transcend dental future that

784
00:51:14.691 --> 00:51:19.691
I live my life so that when I die I will go to heaven rather than a hell.

785
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:23.920
Uh,
and so,
um,
it's a different kind of system.

786
00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:25.910
I'm not seeking success.

787
00:51:25.911 --> 00:51:30.390
I'm thinking behaving in a way to be seen as a good person on,

788
00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:33.860
on Judgment Day.
And I've developed a scale,

789
00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:38.630
the Zimbardo time perspective,
inventory Z,
TPI,
which,

790
00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:43.100
which when you take it,
it gives you scores on each of these dimensions.

791
00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.190
And if you order my website,

792
00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:50.190
it's the time paradox.com you can take the scale and you get,

793
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:52.430
you get immediate feedback on your scores.

794
00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:57.470
Now what's critical is we've discovered with lots and lots of research is that

795
00:51:57.471 --> 00:52:02.471
the most important thing in life is to have what we call a balanced time

796
00:52:03.171 --> 00:52:05.570
perspective.
Be Pp,

797
00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:10.790
which means being high on past positive,

798
00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:16.810
being moderately high on future so that you're not a workaholic,

799
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:19.370
a positive future.

800
00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:23.630
And being moderate on present hedonism,

801
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:27.440
which is selected when you do as a reward for doing,

802
00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:31.460
achieving a good deeds with your future orientation.

803
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:36.050
So there's lots of research that show people how high a balanced time

804
00:52:36.051 --> 00:52:39.890
perspective are physically healthier,
psychologically healthier,

805
00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:43.480
achieve more.
Um,
that always,

806
00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:48.260
and this is research from around the world are these are much,

807
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:53.290
these are the most successful people psychologically on an with even within the

808
00:52:53.661 --> 00:52:58.490
business world.
So this research that I started back in 19,

809
00:52:58.530 --> 00:53:00.620
I guess about 2000,

810
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:05.120
we now have an international time perspective group.

811
00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:10.460
Hundreds and hundreds of young researchers and in many countries around the

812
00:53:10.461 --> 00:53:15.080
world,
we meet biannually in Portugal and more so in,

813
00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:18.830
uh,
Copenhagen next year,
next year we'll meet in Marcy,

814
00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:23.030
meet and talk about research we're doing.
And it's not just research,

815
00:53:23.031 --> 00:53:27.750
it's application.
So these ideas are in psychotherapy and family therapy,

816
00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:30.570
uh,
and,
and clearly in business.
Uh,

817
00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:35.670
so and so it's something I'm really proud of that just a little research idea.

818
00:53:36.181 --> 00:53:37.014
And as I said,

819
00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:41.400
partly came out of the Stanford prison experiment where everybody's sense of

820
00:53:41.401 --> 00:53:44.070
time was distorted because,

821
00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:49.950
because to evil of the guards made every hour of feel,
I feel like,

822
00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:53.880
you know,
many,
many,
many,
many,
many,
many more hours.

823
00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:59.450
<v 1>What are some of the changes that readers of the time paradox have made in their</v>

824
00:54:03.081 --> 00:54:06.590
own lives or that attendees,
for instance,
uh,

825
00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:10.670
at the time perspective conference have made in their own lives as well as a

826
00:54:10.671 --> 00:54:15.620
result of this work?
Does anything come to mind?
Oh,
be sure.

827
00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:16.693
I mean,

828
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:21.190
<v 2>well,
you know,
but people live in the past negative,
any extreme.</v>

829
00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:24.550
This is post traumatic stress disorder.
You know,

830
00:54:24.730 --> 00:54:28.150
one third of all American beds coming back from Iraq,

831
00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:32.680
Afghanistan are suffering with PTSD,
which is,

832
00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:37.720
which in traditional treatment is incurable.
We drug them,

833
00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:39.040
keep it from getting worse.

834
00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:44.640
We've developed a time perspective therapy and with my colleagues in Maui,

835
00:54:45.730 --> 00:54:46.330
uh,
uh,

836
00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:51.330
Rick and Rosemary Sword in which we are able in eight sessions till quote cure,

837
00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:58.240
uh,
uh,
in our sample was like 32 vets with extreme case of PTSD.

838
00:54:58.510 --> 00:55:02.680
And part of it is teaching them about the psychology of time perspective and

839
00:55:02.681 --> 00:55:07.060
converting each of those negatives into a positive.
Yes,
of course,

840
00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:12.080
you know,
it's,
it's not,
it's not undermining the negative Esu.

841
00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:14.980
Best Buddy died in your arms.
Yes,

842
00:55:14.981 --> 00:55:17.860
you saw children being sexually abused.

843
00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:23.110
But now we're going to do is when a put in positive slides in your slide tray.

844
00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:28.000
I'm using an old metaphor.
Uh,
uh,
you know,
did you,

845
00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:33.080
did your family right to you while you're there?
Did you make any friends?
Um,

846
00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:38.050
uh,
did you do,
did you do any good deeds?
So now clearly what's happening,

847
00:55:38.350 --> 00:55:42.120
people have this negative time perspective.
They have just loaded up.

848
00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:47.180
They've just exaggerated Ms. Focus on a few negatives as if that's what well,

849
00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:52.410
there was even people who have had abuse and a life that had that literally had

850
00:55:52.411 --> 00:55:56.270
some real abuse.
You say,
you know,
we want you,

851
00:55:56.330 --> 00:56:01.020
we are to help you elaborate on all the good things in your life.
Uh,
yes.

852
00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:05.130
So one teacher embarrassed you.
Tell us about all the teachers who praise you.

853
00:56:05.131 --> 00:56:09.060
Tell us about all the teachers who made you feel special.
So again,

854
00:56:09.061 --> 00:56:11.730
it's literally possible,
uh,

855
00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.100
if you understand the psychology of time perspective,

856
00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:18.210
change your own time perspective and your time perspective of others.

857
00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:22.740
So again,
in the time paradox and our other book is called the time.

858
00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:27.220
We give very specific suggestions.
If you want to be more future oriented,

859
00:56:27.221 --> 00:56:30.190
here's what you can do.
Do you want to be,
again,

860
00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:33.400
the problem with being too future oriented is you become a workaholic.

861
00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:38.660
So how do you put some present hedonism,
joy into your life?
Uh,

862
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:40.810
and,
uh,
so again,
I try,

863
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:45.870
I try to go from being a general research or trying to discover how the mind and

864
00:56:48.091 --> 00:56:50.680
body and behavior work to always saying,

865
00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:54.790
how can we use these ideas to make our life better,
richer,

866
00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:58.370
more productive,
uh,
and,
and,
uh,

867
00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:02.350
simply to take the joy in being a human being.

868
00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:07.540
I mentioned before we started recording,
but the,
the fact that I received,
uh,

869
00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:11.410
an early galley copy of the time paradox,
it must have been,

870
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:15.980
I'm gonna say they child right?
It,
the big,
no,
no,

871
00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:20.380
it must've been 2008 or,
or very late 2007,

872
00:57:20.381 --> 00:57:23.620
I think 2008.
And,
uh,
I,

873
00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:28.700
I found it very impactful and underlined a lot in that book.

874
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:33.550
And I ended up among other things in the each,

875
00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:36.790
each morning in the,
this is a recent implementation,

876
00:57:36.791 --> 00:57:41.791
but I have a a five minute journal routine where I try to present state ground

877
00:57:43.931 --> 00:57:48.790
myself with a few things like gratitude bullets and so on before going onto the

878
00:57:48.791 --> 00:57:52.330
goal setting so that I'm not anxious and constantly future focus.

879
00:57:52.331 --> 00:57:55.660
But one of the affirmation,
so to speak,

880
00:57:55.690 --> 00:58:00.010
that I found most helpful is I am unrushed and this,
this,
this,

881
00:58:00.011 --> 00:58:02.530
this comes back directly to the story about the,

882
00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:07.530
the Good Samaritans from the theological seminary.
And uh,
it,

883
00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:09.850
it's proven to be incredibly therapeutic for me.

884
00:58:09.970 --> 00:58:13.190
I would encourage people to check out the time paradox.
I found,

885
00:58:13.191 --> 00:58:16.450
I found it to be a brilliant exploration end.
Also,

886
00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:22.120
a lot of what you've written about corresponds to one of the most powerful

887
00:58:22.121 --> 00:58:26.800
exercises that I've experienced and studied of Tony Robbins.

888
00:58:26.801 --> 00:58:30.610
He has a process and it calls the dickens process and the dickens process refers

889
00:58:30.611 --> 00:58:35.380
to the ghost of Christmas,
past,
present,
and future.

890
00:58:35.570 --> 00:58:40.030
And,
and taking people through these different tenses,

891
00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:44.050
uh,
in a number of respects too.
Like you said,

892
00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:49.120
a replace or at least augment some of the slides in their current slideshow.

893
00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:53.650
Yeah,
Beth,
a great,
I mean,
again,

894
00:58:53.651 --> 00:58:58.651
we all tell the story of know Dickens and screwed and living in the past,

895
00:59:00.221 --> 00:59:04.030
present and future.
The point is we have to,

896
00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:08.530
we have to combine those that how do we,
when we think about the past,

897
00:59:08.531 --> 00:59:12.670
how do we embellish it?
And Richard,
when we,
but we wanted joy.

898
00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:16.360
We want to live in a moment.
We want to enjoy the president of family,
friends,

899
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:21.330
fun in the,
we now know the importance of,
uh,
uh,

900
00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:25.580
spending time outside in the natural environment,
not living at our desks,

901
00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:30.650
you know,
uh,
or a cell cell phone environment.

902
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.560
Uh,
and again,
we want to have hope.

903
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:36.350
Possibility is in the future.

904
00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:41.590
How do we shape our past and present to make us ready to enjoy the best in the

905
00:59:41.841 --> 00:59:42.500
future?

906
00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:47.500
And also to think the future is always shapeable modifiable by our actions.

907
00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:48.201
Now,

908
00:59:48.201 --> 00:59:53.201
the other thing I should add here is that one of the ideas we I promote in the

909
00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:59.770
heroic imagination project is we are most effective in,

910
00:59:59.970 --> 01:00:03.850
in teams,
in small groups.
I call them a hero squads.

911
01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:08.690
So when you want to challenge authority,
when you do it alone,

912
01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:11.030
authority dismisses you as a fanatic.

913
01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:16.550
When you have three or more people who agree with you and you confront

914
01:00:16.551 --> 01:00:21.170
authority,
then it is a point of view.
When you say,
we believe,
sir,

915
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:25.400
that what you're doing is not appropriate,
is not in our best interest.

916
01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:30.800
They can't dismiss you individually.
So again,
when,
uh,

917
01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:35.180
when you're challenging unjust authority in the classroom,
uh,
in,

918
01:00:35.181 --> 01:00:38.150
in a organization and the church,
whatever it is,

919
01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:43.390
it is always better to do it as part of a small operating,
uh,

920
01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:48.400
team is the defining difference between here and all truism the resistance of

921
01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:56.420
some type of authority figure or authority.

922
01:00:56.421 --> 01:01:00.950
Is it,
is that one of the differentiators?
No,
no,
no.

923
01:01:00.951 --> 01:01:04.490
The key they came between altruism is doing social good.

924
01:01:04.491 --> 01:01:08.000
Heroism is doing civic virtue.
The differences.

925
01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:13.820
Altruism is heroism.
Light.
The key,

926
01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:15.770
the key is apt to be a hero.

927
01:01:15.771 --> 01:01:20.771
It's to take action on behalf of others in need or defending a moral cause.

928
01:01:20.991 --> 01:01:25.850
And the key now is aware of potential risks and costs to you.

929
01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:28.790
So I give,
I give blood to blood bank,

930
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:33.260
I give money to homeless people who are homeless.
Uh,
I do,

931
01:01:33.261 --> 01:01:34.610
I work in a soup kitchen.

932
01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:37.730
It doesn't cost me anything except a little bit of time.

933
01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:43.060
So any extreme of heroism,
you die.
Okay.
Uh,
you lose your,

934
01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:46.700
you risk your life,
your real life and limb,
uh,
uh,

935
01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:50.000
whistleblowers often lose their job.
It don't get promoted.

936
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:51.980
But the key is just a perception.

937
01:01:51.981 --> 01:01:56.690
I'm doing this despite the fact that there could be a cost,

938
01:01:56.691 --> 01:02:01.010
that there is some potential risk to me.
And even though I'm aware of that,

939
01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:04.970
nevertheless,
I continue to do it.
If you have five more minutes,
oh,

940
01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:08.990
I have all the time in the world.
I just want to be respectful of your time.

941
01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:10.130
I definitely have time.

942
01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.930
So I will tie in this last thing with the prison experiment.

943
01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:20.130
And the reason why I ended the study,
and it also ties to heroism.

944
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:23.280
Um,
so the Stanford prison study

945
01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.460
and was scheduled to go for two weeks,

946
01:02:26.970 --> 01:02:30.600
I doubt if I could have really gone more than a week,
I probably would have gone,

947
01:02:30.601 --> 01:02:31.740
it started on Sunday.

948
01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:35.560
I probably would have gone to the following Sunday to make it,
you know,

949
01:02:35.590 --> 01:02:40.360
a full week,
partly because it was overwhelmingly stressful.
Um,

950
01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:45.300
it wasn't clear to me what it meant to have an experiment that runs night and

951
01:02:45.301 --> 01:02:46.980
day continuously,
uh,

952
01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:50.490
and with me to graduate students and one undergraduate and then one graduate

953
01:02:50.491 --> 01:02:53.430
student had to leave in the middle of the study,
had a family emergency.

954
01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:56.640
So we have me and two students working 24,

955
01:02:56.641 --> 01:02:59.850
seven prisons or having a breakdown every single day.

956
01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:05.160
Parents are coming for visiting day at his parole board hearings for prisoners

957
01:03:05.161 --> 01:03:09.540
who want to,
who want to leave.
Uh,
there's visiting a prison chaplains,

958
01:03:09.810 --> 01:03:12.840
there's rumor of escape plan is all these things happening.

959
01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.890
And of course I'm in charge and I'm sleeping on a couch in my office on the

960
01:03:16.891 --> 01:03:20.610
second floor,
the psychology department,
Jordan Hall.
Um,

961
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:23.940
and so I'm overwhelmed with stress,
but,
um,
I'm going to keep it,

962
01:03:23.941 --> 01:03:28.350
probably keep it going till till the weekend.
And then on Thursday night,

963
01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:31.380
my girlfriend,
Christina Maslack,
uh,

964
01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:35.940
who had been a graduate student at Sampson who just got a job at Berkeley,
um,

965
01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:38.630
to start in September,
uh,

966
01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:43.620
said she was working at the Stanford Library and you know,
could we have dinner,

967
01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:45.900
uh,
uh,
an evening.

968
01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:48.990
So I had to come down on Thursday night.

969
01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:51.870
So study started August 14th,
1971,

970
01:03:51.871 --> 01:03:55.320
so this is like five days in a row.
And I said,
you know,

971
01:03:55.321 --> 01:03:57.210
come down and then we'll go out to dinner.

972
01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:02.600
And what she sees is what is listed on my schedule as the 10 o'clock toilet run

973
01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:09.450
at 10 o'clock was the last time prisoners could go to a real toilet.
After that,

974
01:04:09.451 --> 01:04:11.910
they had to urinate and defecate in a bucket in that cell,

975
01:04:11.911 --> 01:04:13.950
which they hated it to do because it smelled terrible.

976
01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:17.990
So the guards used the guards on the night shift.
And the night shift was,

977
01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:21.510
was the worst one,
just as a novel grave.
The night shift was,

978
01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:23.550
was were all the disaster took place,

979
01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:26.660
partly because they thought nobody was looking,
um,

980
01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:30.900
that the guards lined the prisons up,
put bags for paper,
bags over their head,

981
01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:34.980
chain their legs together,
start a yelling and cursing and you know,

982
01:04:34.981 --> 01:04:37.380
abusing them in every way.
This is at Stanford,

983
01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:40.290
at this in the Stanford prison experiment,
right?

984
01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:44.880
And the same thing and above grade,
but in the same prison.
Right.
So I look up,

985
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:48.060
I'm looking through a one,
a one way screen.

986
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:51.720
And for me it's a checkmark on my daily schedule,
you know,

987
01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:55.890
eight o'clock breakfast,
10 o'clock visiting day,
12 o'clock lunch,

988
01:04:55.891 --> 01:04:59.740
two o'clock parole board hearing.
It's a 10 o'clock toilet room.
And I,

989
01:04:59.741 --> 01:05:03.210
I look at my Christina,
I say,
Hey,
look at that isn't an interesting,

990
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:05.430
she begins to tear up and runs out,

991
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:09.810
runs out to the quad and try to,
um,
uh,

992
01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:13.710
Jordan Hall stamp.
And I run out,
we have this big argument and I'm saying,

993
01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:19.030
you don't understand the dynamics of human nature has seen,
seen this before,

994
01:05:19.031 --> 01:05:23.110
an action,
et cetera.
And she says,
stop.
These are not prisoners.

995
01:05:23.111 --> 01:05:24.010
These are not guards,

996
01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:28.120
they're boys and they are suffering and you are responsible.
And then she says,

997
01:05:29.350 --> 01:05:33.740
you have been changed by the power of the situation more than anyone.
Yeah.

998
01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:38.650
And how could you not see the suffering that is obvious.
And I'm still arguing.

999
01:05:38.651 --> 01:05:43.270
And then she says,
stop,
uh,
if this is the real you,

1000
01:05:43.271 --> 01:05:46.450
I don't think I want to continue my romantic relationship with you.

1001
01:05:46.450 --> 01:05:48.770
We had just moved in together.
We've thinking of,
you know,

1002
01:05:49.170 --> 01:05:53.710
living together and getting married.
And so,
so the tie back to the point I made,

1003
01:05:53.770 --> 01:05:57.580
so this is heroism and action.
She saying,

1004
01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:02.760
I'm willing to pay the costs of giving up a lifetime with you.

1005
01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:07.310
Uh,
and you know,
we were very much in love.
Uh,
uh,

1006
01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:10.570
if you don't come to your senses that she never said you have to end this study.

1007
01:06:10.571 --> 01:06:15.090
She just said,
you know,
you know,
you have to realize,
you know,

1008
01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:16.370
uh,
that,

1009
01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:20.350
that your perception is being distorted by the role you're playing as prison

1010
01:06:20.351 --> 01:06:24.070
superintendent.
And at that moment I said,
oh my God,
you're right.
Uh,

1011
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:28.480
we had dinner at like midnight and then I ended this study in the next day.
So,

1012
01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:32.050
so this is the best example I know of heroism,

1013
01:06:32.051 --> 01:06:35.070
an action ordinary person,
uh,
you know,

1014
01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:39.970
a former student confronting authority and just making it clear that you know,

1015
01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:43.390
that she is willing to pay this price,
you know,

1016
01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:47.620
in order to challenge this,
uh,
uh,

1017
01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:51.190
moral injustice that that was,
that was happening.

1018
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.850
That is a great story and I think it's,

1019
01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:59.530
I think it's a great place to wrap up for,
for today,

1020
01:06:59.531 --> 01:07:01.330
this installment.
We're practically neighbors,

1021
01:07:01.331 --> 01:07:03.730
so it'd be lovely to know that person at some point,

1022
01:07:05.110 --> 01:07:10.110
but I really appreciate you taking the time doctor Zimbardo this has been,

1023
01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:14.770
uh,
a dream conversation of my for a very long time,

1024
01:07:14.771 --> 01:07:18.160
so I really appreciate you carving out the time in your schedule.

1025
01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:23.260
You seem to be as,
as,
as occupied and engaged as ever with the world.
Also,

1026
01:07:24.790 --> 01:07:25.920
I should mention that,

1027
01:07:25.921 --> 01:07:29.830
that I no longer at t I teach at stamp and maybe once a year I give them a model

1028
01:07:29.831 --> 01:07:31.350
lecture to introductory psych.

1029
01:07:32.290 --> 01:07:36.670
I taught more students and more different courses than any professor and Sam and

1030
01:07:36.671 --> 01:07:41.080
history.
I had classes over a thousand students in an introductory side,

1031
01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:43.390
but now I go around the world and I do,

1032
01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:47.950
I do training in our heroic imagination project in Hungary and Poland and

1033
01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:52.530
Sicily,
Suna,
Czech Republic in Bali and Australia.

1034
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:57.520
Um,
so I keep busy two days,
certainly do.
And you,
you taught,

1035
01:07:57.590 --> 01:08:00.700
well you taught for I guess a 57 years.
Is that right?

1036
01:08:00.701 --> 01:08:05.140
Retired after officially retired after teaching for certainly 50 plus years.

1037
01:08:05.141 --> 01:08:06.820
But you're still teaching.
That's the beauty of it.

1038
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.770
You've just chosen a different,
uh,
different,
uh,
vehicle through which to teach.

1039
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:16.040
And uh,

1051
01:09:01.791 --> 01:09:03.110
pondering over the week.

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:06.080

It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1054
01:09:09.561 --> 01:09:13.850
somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1055
01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:19.150
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

1056
01:09:19.791 --> 01:09:22.520
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

1057

This episode is brought to you by ID commerce and logistics.

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:46.640
Known these guys for quite a while.

1064
01:09:46.641 --> 01:09:50.960
I'm asked all the time about how to scale businesses quickly and rule number one

1065
01:09:50.961 --> 01:09:52.130
is removing bottlenecks.

1066
01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:55.160
It slow you down and act as an emergency brake for many companies.

1067
01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:59.180
One of the first things that should go is inventory management and fulfillment

1068
01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:03.710
ID.
Commerce and logistics focuses on helping online retailers and entrepreneurs

1069
01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:07.820
outgrow the competition by handling all of the behind the scenes details that

1070
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:10.580
you don't want to if they manage your inventory,
pick,

1071

pack and ship and handle every possible logistics need so that you can focus on

1073
01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:21.980
I partnered with them myself during the launch of the four hour chef so that I

1074
01:10:21.981 --> 01:10:25.180
could focus on promoting the book what I'm good at and they insured.

1075
01:10:25.181 --> 01:10:26.360
They handled what they're good at.

1076
01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:30.500
That is keeping my readers happy with dozens of different products that needed

1077

This episode is brought to you by wealth front.

1089
01:11:20.190 --> 01:11:22.650
Wealth Front is the future of financial advice.

1090
01:11:22.651 --> 01:11:27.060
They become incredibly popular among my friends in silicon valley and across the

1091
01:11:27.061 --> 01:11:31.170
country because they provide the same high end financial advice that the best

1092
01:11:31.171 --> 01:11:33.450
private wealth managers deliver to the ultra wealthy.

1093
01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:37.830
But for any account size and at a fraction of the cost,
for instance,

1094
01:11:37.831 --> 01:11:41.460
they monitor your portfolio every day across more than it does an asset classes

1095
01:11:41.490 --> 01:11:45.870
to look for opportunities to rebalance or harvest tax losses.
Now,

1096
01:11:46.530 --> 01:11:50.370
would you do the same?
Are you doing the same?
Probably not.

1097
01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:51.990
And the power's in the software.

1098
01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:55.290
Wealth Front now manages more than $4 billion in assets,

1099
01:11:55.291 --> 01:11:57.810
which is up from around 2.5 billion.

1100
01:11:57.811 --> 01:11:59.520
When they started advertising on this podcast,

1101
01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:03.990
they're growing incredibly quickly.
Unlike old fashioned private wealth managers,

1102
01:12:03.991 --> 01:12:06.300
wealth front is powered by innovative technology,

1103
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:11.040
making it the most tax efficient,
low cost,
hassle free way to invest.

1104
01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:14.520
They don't have bloated sales teams or retail locations,

1105
01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:18.290
so they can deliver all of this sophisticated financial advice and these

1106
01:12:18.291 --> 01:12:21.750
services at a fraction of the cost of a traditional financial advisor.
