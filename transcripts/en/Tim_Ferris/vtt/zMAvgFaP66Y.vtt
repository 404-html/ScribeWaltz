3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.890
You posted a question.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.590
I'm a cybernetic organism.

5
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.730
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by wordpress.com I love wordpress.</v>

I have used it for so many years.

7
00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:34.670
It's my goto platform for blogging and creating websites.

8
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.690
I use wordpress.com for everything every day.
My site,

9
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.610
tim.blog is built on it.
The websites for my books,
including tools of titans,

10
00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:48.520
tribe of mentors.
It's all in wordpress.com and the founder Matt Mullenweg.

11
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.700
One of my close friends has appeared on this show many times.

12
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.750
Just search Matt Mullenweg,
Tequila Ferris for quite an exciting time.

a business site,

14
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.060

15
00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:08.770

18
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.740
and one of my friends@googlewhoshallremainnamelesshastoldmethatwordpress.com

19
00:01:21.071 --> 00:01:25.090

20
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.900
and it's one of the many reasons that nearly 30% of the Internet is run on

21
00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:30.734
wordpress.

22
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.580
You do not need experience or to hire someone that's perhaps the best part.

23
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.250
wordpress.com guide you through the entire experience.

There's no need to worry about security upgrades,

26
00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:49.760
hosting any of that.
They have for 24 seven support and they're very,

27
00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:52.190

29
00:01:56.601 --> 00:01:59.900
headache and friction.

This episode is brought to you by four sigmatic.

39
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.050
You might remember four sigmatic for their mushroom coffee,

40
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.900
which was created by those clever finished founders.

41
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.690
And when I first mentioned that coffee on this podcast,

42
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.170
the product sold out in less than a week.
It lights you up like a Christmas tree,

43
00:02:45.171 --> 00:02:47.720
which can be really useful.
However,

44
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.100
recently I've been testing the opposite side of the spectrum of new product and

45
00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:56.960
that is their Reishi mushroom elixir to help me end my day to get to sleep.

46
00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.860
As you guys may know,
longtime listeners,

47
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:01.960
at least I struggled with insomnia for decades.

48
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.010
I've a largely fixed that but still shutting off my monkey brain has never been

49
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.400
easy,
still isn't easy very often and I found Reishi,

50
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:12.760
which I've been fascinated by for a few years now,
has been very,

51
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:16.690
very effective and calming their old formula,
however,

52
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:21.610
four Sigmadek old formula included Stevia and I like to avoid sweeteners,

53
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.640
all sweeteners for a host of reasons and I then just ping them and asked,

54
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.140
hey guys,
I would love to experiment with this and maybe actually suggested,

55
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.590
but I'd like a version without sweeteners if he'd be open to it.

56
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.880
If too much of a headache,
don't worry.

57
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.020
And they are always game for experimentation.

58
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.740
So they created a special custom version without the Stevia,
without sweeteners.

59
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.320
Now it is part of my nightly routine.

60
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.070
Their ratio looks or comes in single serving packets which are perfect for

61
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:54.400
travel and in fact I'm about to leave the country right now and I have a packet

62
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:58.450
in front of me that's just going to sit in the end of my carry on bag.

63
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.410
You only need hot water and it mixes very,
very easily.

64
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.180
Here's some recommended copy that they put in the read.

65
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.160
So I'm going to read it and then I'll give you my take quote,

66
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.490
a warning for those in the experimental mindset,

67
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.030
Reishi is strong and bitter in parentheses,
like any great medicine.

68
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:17.560
So if the bitterness is too much,

69
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:21.930
I recommend trying it with honey end or nut milk such as almond milk and quote.

70
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.070
So I'm going to say no,

71
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.600
you should suck it up and you should drink the tea because it's not that bitter.

72
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.140
And maybe you should take the advice of all Chinese people when they're

73
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:35.350
criticizing younguns.
When they say [inaudible] should a cool,

74
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.270
which means you're not able to eat bitterness.
Bitter is in many cases,

75
00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:43.870
an indication of things that help liver detoxification and so on.

76
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.670
Not saying that's the case here,

77
00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:50.440
but I've tested this ratio lecture on family members,

78
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:54.280
on friends.
Everybody has liked it.
It's a little bit earthy.
It's not that hard.

79
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:56.770
So I would just say suck it up and no,

80
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.940
don't put in honey or nut milk or any of that shit.
Just drink the goddamn tea.

81
00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:04.060
It's delicious,
I think,
right?
If you like poo air,
that kind of stuff,

82
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:07.600
that type of tea,
you're going to dig it.
So just try it.
Okay.

83
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.680
Back to then my read.
If you'd like to naturally improve your sleep,

84
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.600
both onset and quality,

85
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:18.601
I think naturally you might just enjoy this ratio elixir without any sweeteners.

86
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.350
It has organic,
Reishi extract,
organic fuel to mint extract,

87
00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:27.850
organic rose hips extract,
organic Tulsi extract.
And that's it.

88
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.010
No fancy stuff,
no artificial watching McCall at anything.
So check it out.

104
00:06:27.281 --> 00:06:30.430
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

105
00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:34.390
it is my job each and every episode to deconstruct world class performers,

106
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.450
experts from various disciplines across all industries.

107
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.560
And today we have Brandon Stanton who is the creator of the Number One New York

108
00:06:41.561 --> 00:06:43.930
Times bestselling books,

109
00:06:43.931 --> 00:06:46.780
humans of New York stories as well as the children's book,

110
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.310
little humans of New York.

111
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.260
In 2013 he was named one of the 30 under 30 people changing the world by Time

112
00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:54.094
magazine.

113
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.670
Brennan has told stories from around the world in collaboration with the United

114
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.610
Nations and it was invited to photograph President Obama in the Oval Office.

115
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.440
His photography and storytelling blog,

116
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.680
humans of New York is followed by more than 25 million people plus me on several

123
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.160
So you can find that as well.
Humans of New York,

124
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.143
<v 3>Okay.</v>

125
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.420
<v 1>Brandon,
welcome to the show.
Thanks Tim.</v>

126
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:40.520
I really appreciate you making the time and I've been following your work for

127
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.350
quite a few years now and uh,
I'm excited to have a chance to,

128
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:49.850
to pick it some of the earlier days and explore questions that had been on my

129
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:51.650
mind for a few years now.

130
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.210
So the,
uh,
the,

131
00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:01.190
the first question I wanted to take a stab at is actually one I'm borrowing from

132
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:02.680
another Jorgen.
Uh,

133
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:07.690
and that is a joke Gibeah the cofounder of Airbnb.

134
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:09.620
Who likes to ask this question?

135
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.820
Do you remember the first time you got in trouble or one of the first times you

136
00:08:13.821 --> 00:08:14.654
got in trouble?

137
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.470
<v 3>No.
God</v>

138
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.230
had the first time I got in trouble

139
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.330
<v 1>or a notable time that you got in trouble when you were young?</v>

140
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.280
<v 3>A notable time.
I remember,
um,</v>

141
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.470
I was sitting in,

142
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:35.500
my mom used to take us to the grocery store a lot of times after school and do

143
00:08:35.651 --> 00:08:35.841
you know,

144
00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:39.830
she was just going to run in for a few minutes and grab something and so we just

145
00:08:39.831 --> 00:08:44.450
supposed to sit in the car.
Um,
and I think I was like,
you know,
nine or 10,

146
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:45.733
um,

147
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:50.480
and I wasn't supposed to touch anything but there were all these like buttons on

148
00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:53.570
the dashboard and things like that.
And um,

149
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.010
I remember she came

150
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.750
<v 4>back out and I think,
you know,
the alarms going off and then the,
the keys,</v>

151
00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:04.320
the steering wheel's locked and you can't move the car.

152
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.370
And I remember that one very vaguely because I wasn't allowed to go to the fall

153
00:09:08.371 --> 00:09:12.770
festival at the school that year.
Um,
which was a,
um,

154
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:17.310
my favorite thing to do cause they had like carnival games and things like that.

155
00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:20.940
Um,
so going back in my mind about the,
you know,

156
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:24.480
a painful early time of getting in trouble,
you know,
that comes into mind

157
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:30.340
<v 1>as I was doing homework for this conversation,</v>

158
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:35.550
I was reading up on some of the earlier days and the particular sense that I

159
00:09:39.191 --> 00:09:40.800
wanted to explore.
Uh,

160
00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:44.890
I was in a previous interview of yours and it covers quite a bit of it,

161
00:09:44.891 --> 00:09:48.460
but it said after having flunked out of college in later going back and

162
00:09:48.461 --> 00:09:51.400
graduating as a history major with straight A's and then it goes on to say a

163
00:09:51.401 --> 00:09:52.780
number of other things.
Right.

164
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.780
But did you get into a lot of trouble as a kid or what,

165
00:09:56.781 --> 00:09:58.600
what led to the flunking out of college?

166
00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:03.330
<v 4>Right.
Well,
I mean,
I always say that,
you know,</v>

167
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.760
a lot of my early trouble,
uh,

168
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:11.790
was coming from this thought that I had to do something really big in the world.

169
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:17.500
And,
you know,
I'm sitting in class all day and I'm learning these kind of,

170
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:22.270
you know,
very minute details about things like the magna Carta and,
you know,

171
00:10:22.271 --> 00:10:25.030
the compromise of 18 whatever.
Uh,

172
00:10:25.031 --> 00:10:29.520
and none of this really seemed important at all because,
you know,

173
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.260
I felt that I felt that I was,
you know,

174
00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:36.700
my purpose had to be much greater than this and then how am I going to use any

175
00:10:36.701 --> 00:10:41.200
of this in life.
Um,
and so like,
you know,
I spent all of my time,
you know,

176
00:10:41.201 --> 00:10:43.750
back then I was smoking a lot of weed.
Um,

177
00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:48.780
and just like trying to think about what my big idea and what my contribution to

178
00:10:50.741 --> 00:10:55.240
the world was going to be and instead of going to class,

179
00:10:55.241 --> 00:11:00.220
I was doing that,
you know,
instead of really kind of working to improve myself,

180
00:11:00.221 --> 00:11:01.820
you know,
I was doing that just,
you know,

181
00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:06.370
pontificating and then just like thinking all the time about,
you know,

182
00:11:06.371 --> 00:11:09.670
what my contribution to the world is going to be a,

183
00:11:09.671 --> 00:11:12.760
and that was the time that I flunked out.
And you know,

184
00:11:12.761 --> 00:11:17.761
things really started moving forward for me was when I threw in the towel,

185
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.110
you know,
I waved the white flag.
I said,
you know,

186
00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.190
I'm going to stop trying to figure out,
you know,

187
00:11:24.191 --> 00:11:26.890
what the big thing I'm supposed to accomplish is,

188
00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.720
and I'm just going to start doing what I was supposed to do.
And you know,

189
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.330
I started riding the bus and started going to community college,

190
00:11:34.331 --> 00:11:37.450
Georgia Perimeter College.
I got my grades back up.

191
00:11:37.451 --> 00:11:41.710
I went back to the University of Georgia where I flunked out of.
And you know,

192
00:11:41.711 --> 00:11:45.130
I focused on becoming a disciplined person and you know,

193
00:11:45.131 --> 00:11:50.131
having a routine in my wife of working out every day and playing piano every

194
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.990
single day,
doing my homework.
And you know,

195
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.200
funny because when I stopped trying to think about this big thing that I was

196
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:04.711
going to accomplish in life and started just focusing on putting one foot in

197
00:12:04.721 --> 00:12:07.000
front of the other every single day,

198
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:12.340
it began to propel me on the journey that ultimately led to humans of New York,

199
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:17.440
which was something bigger than I could've ever imagined when I was hitting the

200
00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.430
bong and the Creswell dorm.
That's the University of Georgia

201
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:25.403
now.

202
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:30.420
This preoccupation that you had with your big contribution to the world.

203
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.520
I don't know how common that is.
I didn't have that preoccupation.
Did Dee,

204
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.290
did that come from parents?

205
00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:40.790
Did that come from a book you read or where did that come from?

206
00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:44.650
Psychedelic mushrooms might've had a little something to do with it.

207
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:49.600
I can see that.
I can see that.
It's just like,

208
00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:52.480
I spent so much time,
you know,

209
00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:55.660
I had a very intelligent group of friends and you know,

210
00:12:55.661 --> 00:13:00.070
so much of my 16,
17,
18,

211
00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:04.570
19,
20,
um,
was just,

212
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.260
uh,
I guess partaking in these recreational activities,

213
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:12.490
trying to figure out what is truth,
you know,
like what is,

214
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:17.770
what is the meaning of all of this?
And like all of these kind of big questions,

215
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:22.330
uh,
compared to which,
uh,
you know,

216
00:13:22.331 --> 00:13:27.331
these intricacies of things like calculus and Algebra and,

217
00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:32.420
you know,
verb conjugations and French and,
you know,

218
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:37.440
all of these subjects I was being forced to do in schools seem so minor and not

219
00:13:38.681 --> 00:13:43.420
useful to what I really wanted to understand.
And you know,

220
00:13:43.421 --> 00:13:47.350
alongside these kind of like big questions about,
you know,

221
00:13:47.351 --> 00:13:51.130
why are we here and,
and what is this all about Cain,

222
00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:54.820
this kind of feeling.
And you know,
I think some sort of kind of vague,

223
00:13:54.821 --> 00:13:59.230
like spirituality was wrapped up in it as well,
that,
you know,

224
00:13:59.231 --> 00:14:00.730
this is this,

225
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:05.820
this world is so amazing and the fact that we're here is so amazing and doing

226
00:14:07.061 --> 00:14:12.061
anything less than something amazing is kind of squandering,

227
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.750
you know,
this,
this whole reason that you're here.
Um,

228
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:21.700
and I think that's,
that was the kind of thinking,
you know,

229
00:14:21.701 --> 00:14:25.000
that brought me down this path that I was,
you know,

230
00:14:25.001 --> 00:14:29.870
my time was too good and,
and my thoughts like,
you know,
the,
the,

231
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.000
the space in my brain was too precious to,
you know,

232
00:14:34.001 --> 00:14:36.370
fill it up with all these,
you know,

233
00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:40.570
little this homework and this and this stuff that seemed so unimportant.

234
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.330
Uh,
and so instead,
I just,
you know,

235
00:14:43.331 --> 00:14:46.360
spent all my time just kind of grappling with these,

236
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.670
with these bigger things.

237
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.340
What was it like growing up in Marietta,

238
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.900
<v 1>Georgia and my right.
And were you born in Georgia also?</v>

239
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.260
<v 3>Yeah.
I was born in Georgia.</v>

240
00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:04.320
I mean I am somebody who has liked everywhere I've ever been.

241
00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.840
I liked my school.
I liked my college,

242
00:15:07.841 --> 00:15:11.470
I liked the community college I went to after I flunked out of my college.

243
00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:16.810
I liked Atlanta.
Uh,
I liked Chicago.
I love New York.
You know,

244
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.410
I'm generally somebody who appreciates the,

245
00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.420
the place that I'm in a,

246
00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:26.920
I tend to find that people complaining about where they live.

247
00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:30.760
Not always.
I mean it's,
it's not.
You can,

248
00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:35.080
there's always someplace that you can be,
that might be better for you,

249
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:39.940
but if you hate the place that you live,
if you,
if you kind of just despise it.

250
00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.193
Um,

251
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:46.470
I find that a lot of times a new environment is not the key to your happiness.

252
00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:48.310
Uh,

253
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:51.880
cause I find it a lot of times the people that are complaining about one place

254
00:15:51.881 --> 00:15:54.560
when they moved to another place,
then you know,
if it's,

255
00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:58.630
if they live in Atlanta and the answers New York,
then when they get to New York,

256
00:15:58.631 --> 00:16:03.160
you know what New York's dead.
The answer is La,
when they get to La,

257
00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:07.810
oh,
the American values suck.
Need to get to Paris,
you know,
when they get,

258
00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.980
when they get to Paris,
Oh,
you know,
the West is so,

259
00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:16.180
it's so materialistic.
I need to go to India.
You know what I mean?

260
00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.380
And so I find a lot of times to place it kind of the people who kind of

261
00:16:20.381 --> 00:16:24.850
externalize their environment as being the reason for their dissatisfaction tend

262
00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:29.050
to be unsatisfied everywhere.
Uh,
I kind of the opposite.
You know,

263
00:16:29.051 --> 00:16:33.160
I've loved every place that I've lived.
I've loved the people.

264
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.640
Um,
you know that I've met in every place I lived.

265
00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.390
Marietta was Starbucks and Barnes and noble,
but I had a great,

266
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.620
great group of friends and you know,
I enjoyed growing up there.

267
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.380
<v 1>This,
I'm just piecing the connective tissue together as I go because I'm really</v>

268
00:16:48.381 --> 00:16:50.990
interested,
I don't know why this is the case,
but it,

269
00:16:50.991 --> 00:16:52.640
particularly in the last six months,

270
00:16:52.641 --> 00:16:56.810
I've been more and more fascinated by the earlier stages with almost everyone.

271
00:16:56.811 --> 00:17:00.020
I've been chatting with the history major,

272
00:17:00.021 --> 00:17:05.020
you graduate with straight A's and then you end up,
and I know you've,

273
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:08.750
you've,
you've spoken quite a bit about this,
we won't Belabor the point,

274
00:17:08.751 --> 00:17:13.751
but you get a job as a bond trader in Chicago is my understanding and it that

275
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:15.051
right?

276
00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:19.430
The first time that you weren't embarrassed in front of family and friends about

277
00:17:19.431 --> 00:17:22.820
where your life was going,
you get this,
this prestigious job.
How did,

278
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:26.300
how did you go about choosing that job or finding that job?

279
00:17:26.301 --> 00:17:29.380
Or how did they find you from history?
Right,

280
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.860
<v 3>right.
So,
I mean,
the whole reason I became,
I mean to give you,</v>

281
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.170
to catch you up a little bit,
um,
you know,

282
00:17:36.171 --> 00:17:39.140
when I first went to the University of Georgia,
I was majoring in business.

283
00:17:39.141 --> 00:17:43.390
That's when I wasn't going to class.
Uh,
I flunked out.
Uh,

284
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:48.050
and then when I decided to go back to college,
you know,
I thought to myself,
well,

285
00:17:48.051 --> 00:17:49.530
I'm just going to

286
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.750
<v 4>study something that I enjoy anyway,
so it's not this kind of,
you know,</v>

287
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:59.370
major force of effort to go to class and to do my work.

288
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.120
Um,

289
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.140
at that time I had developed a reading habit that was really when my life kind

290
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:06.330
of turned around.
Cause remember,
you know,
I,
I,

291
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:11.550
I stopped thinking about these kinds of big problems I wanted to solve and you

292
00:18:11.551 --> 00:18:15.720
know,
I started focusing on,
you know,
establishing a routine,

293
00:18:15.721 --> 00:18:20.640
some discipline in my life.
And one of the first big ones and still,

294
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:25.620
probably the most monumental routine that I ever established and decision I ever

295
00:18:25.621 --> 00:18:29.820
made was that I was going to read 100 pages a day.
Um,

296
00:18:29.821 --> 00:18:31.200
mostly nonfiction.

297
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.890
And whether the book was the little prince or it was something like the wealth

298
00:18:34.891 --> 00:18:36.030
of nations,
you know,

299
00:18:36.031 --> 00:18:41.031
whether it took me an hour or whether it took me eight hours every single day,

300
00:18:41.521 --> 00:18:45.030
I was going to read a hundred pages.
And I did that for years.
Uh,

301
00:18:45.031 --> 00:18:47.780
even when I went back to school in addition to my schoolwork,

302
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.580
I would read a hundred pages.
What came was,
sorry to interrupt,

303
00:18:50.581 --> 00:18:53.350
but what catalyzed that decision?
I mean,
was there a feeling it's like this,

304
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.070
it was this feeling,
I mean psychologically,
you know,

305
00:18:56.071 --> 00:19:00.380
it was like this feeling of being,
you know,
maybe behind,
you know,
I,

306
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.620
I remembered,
I remembered,
um,
you know,

307
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:09.950
the,
one of the very first books that I read was a,

308
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.280
this auto biography of Ben Franklin.
And,
you know,
he has all these kind of,

309
00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:15.330
you know,

310
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.840
he did the poor Richard's Almanac and he has all these kinds of sayings.

311
00:19:18.841 --> 00:19:20.820
And I remember,
you know,
first of all,

312
00:19:20.821 --> 00:19:25.821
Ben Franklin himself was kind of the pioneer in and getting self improvement

313
00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:30.720
down to a science.
Do you know what I mean?
And,
um,
so you know,

314
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:34.380
his example,
first of all,
how much he,
you know,

315
00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:38.760
how much effort he put into improving himself and moving himself forward.

316
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.480
And then I remember he had this one quote,
you know,

317
00:19:42.481 --> 00:19:47.280
that I'm uneducated.
Genius is like finding silver in the mine,
you know,

318
00:19:47.281 --> 00:19:51.720
and it kind of,
it,
it made me think that,
you know,

319
00:19:51.721 --> 00:19:56.340
I had spent all this time kind of,
you know,
thinking and kind of pondering,

320
00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:59.430
uh,
and I thought that I was,
you know,

321
00:19:59.431 --> 00:20:03.900
that school was beneath me in school was boring and you know,

322
00:20:03.901 --> 00:20:08.520
because of that I really hadn't been imbibing much information.

323
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:13.890
And you know,
at that time it's something kind of flipped.
And I felt like,

324
00:20:13.891 --> 00:20:17.930
you know,
I've missed out on,
you know,
probably the last four,

325
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:22.320
six years of education because I was just doing the minimum,
you know,
I was,

326
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.310
I was just getting by and writing my papers before class,
you know,

327
00:20:26.311 --> 00:20:30.150
I was probably looking at the person's next to me,
his paper,
you know,

328
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:34.830
a few times.
And so it's like,
even though I was making okay grades,

329
00:20:34.831 --> 00:20:37.410
I really wasn't,
you know,

330
00:20:37.411 --> 00:20:42.390
taking in a lot of information and educating myself.
And so,

331
00:20:42.391 --> 00:20:42.601
you know,

332
00:20:42.601 --> 00:20:47.220
I think that at that time I decided I was going to become extremely educated.

333
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:52.180
And you know,
I did,
I did become an extremely educated person,

334
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:57.370
but you know,
95% of that education was outside of school.
You know,

335
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:02.400
95% of that education was over the course of seven or eight years,

336
00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:08.260
uh,
saying I'm going to read 100 pages of nonfiction a day,
every single day.

337
00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:10.690
And I did it for seven or eight years.

338
00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:15.520
I'd say 60% of that was biography.
Uh,

339
00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:19.810
I would say another 20% of it was history.
Uh,

340
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.100
and then,
you know,
and that wasn't,
I would read fiction too,
you know,

341
00:21:24.101 --> 00:21:27.640
when I was absolutely tired of eating my vegetables,
I,

342
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:32.110
that's what I,
that's what I would call,
you know,
the most boring books,
you know,

343
00:21:32.111 --> 00:21:34.960
the really kind of conceptual one I just viewed as vegetables.
You know,

344
00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:38.860
I was just like sometimes sometimes hard to get through,

345
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.750
but a fiber of knowledge,
you know,
you,

346
00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:47.860
it grows in the kind of,
it kind of develops you.
Um,
but yeah,
you know,

347
00:21:47.861 --> 00:21:52.690
so biographies were the ones that I was really,
really drawn to.
Um,

348
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:56.040
and so,
you know,
at the time,
you know,

349
00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.530
I started kind of reading all these biographies and I was loving it and

350
00:21:59.531 --> 00:22:01.150
biographies,
just history.
You know,

351
00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:05.680
biography is the best form of history if you ask me because it cuts through the

352
00:22:05.681 --> 00:22:08.260
theory,
it cuts through,
you know,

353
00:22:08.261 --> 00:22:12.880
all the speculation of the author and we get down to the nuts and the bolts of

354
00:22:12.881 --> 00:22:16.090
the decisions that people made in their lives.

355
00:22:16.091 --> 00:22:19.450
And I think that is the purest form of education that you can get.

356
00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:23.140
And it's the advice that I give people who don't know what they want to do with

357
00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:27.460
their lives.
Pick somebody that you admire and read their biography,

358
00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:32.260
read their biography.
If you really want some sort of guidance in your life,

359
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:37.680
pick somebody who has done things that you want to do and that you really admire

360
00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:41.920
and read a nice fat 800 page biography of their lives.

361
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:45.190
Find out the struggles they went through.
Find out the,
you know,

362
00:22:45.191 --> 00:22:49.510
the twists and turns their lives and the decisions they made.
And I mean,

363
00:22:49.511 --> 00:22:53.110
I don't think there's any better actionable roadmap,

364
00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:58.180
actionable education then getting down to the granular level of somebody's life

365
00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:02.800
and finding out how they navigated it.
If,
uh,

366
00:23:02.801 --> 00:23:04.330
if someone wanted to,

367
00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:08.860
let's just say that they are having a lapse of concentration and can't think of

368
00:23:08.861 --> 00:23:11.800
people they admire who have biographies.

369
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.680
If you were to recommend any,

370
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:18.620
let's just say one to three biographies as Gateway Drugs into that world,

371
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:19.660
are there any of that comes to mind?

372
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.360
It depends upon what you want to accomplish in life.

373
00:23:22.361 --> 00:23:26.740
Like if you're just flagging and you don't know what you want to do.

374
00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:31.330
A start with Ben Franklin,
start with somebody who was,
who was,
you know,

375
00:23:31.331 --> 00:23:36.310
very disciplined and you know,
programmatic in,

376
00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.370
in figuring out how to develop themselves.
Again,

377
00:23:39.371 --> 00:23:44.371
my advice always to people who are stuck is quit looking at the big pictures.

378
00:23:44.831 --> 00:23:48.890
People stuck because they want to accomplish two big things and they don't know

379
00:23:48.891 --> 00:23:52.280
the right step to take.
So,
you know,
I always say just kind of,

380
00:23:52.281 --> 00:23:56.660
instead of focusing on the year,
instead of focusing on the arc of your life,

381
00:23:56.661 --> 00:24:01.661
focus on the 24 hour period and nobody mastered the 24 hour period more than

382
00:24:02.571 --> 00:24:06.700
Benjamin Franklin.
So it's like,
if you have no idea what you want to do,

383
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:10.370
start there.
I would say if you know what you want to do,

384
00:24:10.371 --> 00:24:13.780
you've got to pick the person that you admired the most.
Do you know,

385
00:24:13.781 --> 00:24:17.030
do you want to participate in social movements?
You know,

386
00:24:17.031 --> 00:24:21.410
Pick Martin Luther King.
Uh,
do you want to be president of the United States?

387
00:24:21.411 --> 00:24:23.420
If you want to pick,
be president of the United States,

388
00:24:23.421 --> 00:24:26.570
I would recommend Lyndon Johnson,
Lyndon Johnson,

389
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:31.600
because he was probably the president that was given the least in his life,

390
00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:36.170
except for maybe Abraham Lincoln.
You know,
he was the,
he didn't go to Ivy League,

391
00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.890
you know,
he didn't,
um,
he wasn't necessarily a,

392
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:44.600
a great looking guy.
You know,
he went to San Marcos teacher college.
He,

393
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.070
you know,
basically,
and again,
this is if you want to be president,

394
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:52.460
I don't want to be president.
Uh,
he,
you know,

395
00:24:52.461 --> 00:24:57.461
worked his way up through understanding how the levers of democracy work,

396
00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:01.190
the levers of power in our government work.
Uh,

397
00:25:01.191 --> 00:25:06.090
and so he is a fascinating character sketch on how to be precedent.
Uh,

398
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:08.990
if you want to read a Lyndon Johnson biography,

399
00:25:08.991 --> 00:25:12.270
you should read the four volume biography by Robert Caro,
uh,

400
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:16.220
which is the best of those.
Um,
but you know,
other than that,
it just like,

401
00:25:16.221 --> 00:25:21.170
it all depends upon what it is that you want to do in life.
You know,
there's,

402
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.920
there's just no biography that every person should read.

403
00:25:24.921 --> 00:25:29.030
They should pick the person they admire the most and read the biography of their

404
00:25:29.031 --> 00:25:32.900
life with Ben Franklin.
It would it be the,
uh,

405
00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.470
a biography like Walter Isaacson or would be the,
at the Isaac,

406
00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.430
the Isaacson one was the one I read and that stands out the most because it was

407
00:25:40.431 --> 00:25:41.264
the first,

408
00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.730
the person that I've read the most biographies on properly,

409
00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:50.690
Theodore Roosevelt.
Um,
just because his life is so fascinating.
Um,

410
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:54.080
probably Adolph Hitler,
probably Stalin.

411
00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.340
And it's not because it,
in any way these people are admirable.

412
00:25:58.341 --> 00:26:00.770
But like as a history major,

413
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:06.040
to me it wasn't the individual themself that was fascinating to me.

414
00:26:06.321 --> 00:26:09.680
It was how does a group of people,
you know,

415
00:26:09.681 --> 00:26:14.060
Germany was a smart industrialized country.
To me,

416
00:26:14.061 --> 00:26:18.470
the big philosophical question that fascinated me and the,
and the reason that I,

417
00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:23.520
I've dealt so much into the lives and the practices of dictators is,

418
00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.960
you know,
how is it that a group of such educated,
smart,

419
00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:34.910
well meaning people,
uh,
we're,
we're able to be,

420
00:26:34.911 --> 00:26:39.470
you know,
um,
ever to be able to be organized under the,
you know,

421
00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.480
the premise of committing such evil.

422
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:46.990
And that to me as has always fascinated me because I believe that people are

423
00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:49.260
inherently good.
And you know,

424
00:26:49.261 --> 00:26:53.550
I've traveled to 30 or 40 different countries and you know,
it's funny,

425
00:26:53.551 --> 00:26:57.930
every place has a reputation.
Oh,
don't go to this city.
People won't talk to you.

426
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.560
You.
So many times when I land in a place they say,
oh,

427
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.580
this isn't going to work here.
You know,
people,
people aren't open here.

428
00:27:05.581 --> 00:27:09.420
People aren't friendly here.
And,
you know,
I find one on one,

429
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:14.610
people all over the world,
you know,
are very,
they,
they,
they kind of share,

430
00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:19.620
you know,
a,
a similar soul I guess.
And you know,

431
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:24.630
if people are generally the same everywhere,
you know,

432
00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:25.170
the,

433
00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:30.170
then that means anywhere something like this could happen anywhere.

434
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.750
You know,
people can,

435
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:38.900
can get pulled into this crowd psychology and you know,

436
00:27:38.911 --> 00:27:43.911
direct their anger in their hatred and violence towards people in a way that

437
00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:49.470
would counter debt,
their morals if you met them one on one.
And,

438
00:27:49.471 --> 00:27:51.300
you know,
because of that,
the,
the,

439
00:27:51.301 --> 00:27:56.301
the lives in the periods of history that have always been most intellectually

440
00:27:56.371 --> 00:27:59.070
interesting to me.
Again,
it's not something that I admire.

441
00:27:59.071 --> 00:28:02.820
It's not something I am looking to duplicate.
Of course,
uh,

442
00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:07.900
at have been these periods where a very driven ideological individual ads

443
00:28:09.901 --> 00:28:11.370
managed to,

444
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:15.840
to mobilize a group of people towards ends.

445
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:20.850
That looking back from a historical perspective were brutal and violent and

446
00:28:20.851 --> 00:28:23.490
absolutely unexplainable.
And you know,

447
00:28:23.491 --> 00:28:26.040
I think it's important to understand these things,

448
00:28:26.041 --> 00:28:29.700
to keep it from happening again.
Do you remember you asked about bond trading?

449
00:28:29.701 --> 00:28:34.120
Like,
oh,
I do.
So no,
I never talked about it.
And

450
00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.450
I think,
you know,

451
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:42.570
I started talking about is cause bond trading was really an anomaly in my life.

452
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:43.530
Um,

453
00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:46.950
I was really kind of wrapped up in all of these things that we're talking about

454
00:28:46.951 --> 00:28:48.120
now.
You know,

455
00:28:48.121 --> 00:28:52.620
I was really kind of wrapped up and in history and biography mainly.

456
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.880
Um,
when Obama,
uh,
it was,

457
00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:01.380
God,
what was it,
2008,
2007,

458
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:06.000
I think it was 2007 he was in the primary.
Um,

459
00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:07.980
and I was,

460
00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:11.940
I really became fixated on this campaign.

461
00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:17.130
Uh,
and you know,
I was not,
I was going to knock on doors.

462
00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.190
Uh,
and this is during the primary when he's going up against Hillary.

463
00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:23.330
And I was knocking on doors.
I was going to different states,

464
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:26.790
knocking on doors and,
and,
um,

465
00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:31.970
I was reading every article about the delegate system and super delegates.

466
00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:33.841
And you know,

467
00:29:33.841 --> 00:29:37.320
there's this point where I was just absolutely positive he was going to,

468
00:29:37.321 --> 00:29:39.060
when I was at,
this is the primary,

469
00:29:39.061 --> 00:29:42.170
I was just absolutely positive he was going to win.
Um,

470
00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:46.330
<v 3>and I was broke at the time on,
this was not something I would ever do today.</v>

471
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:47.463
Um,

472
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:52.470
but I took out $5,000 in student loans and I actually bet on Barack Obama,

473
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:57.400
weird is one bet on something like that.

474
00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:01.720
Back then it was an Irish exchange.
It has since gone under,

475
00:30:01.721 --> 00:30:03.810
it was called Intrade trade.
Um,

476
00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:07.720
and I think they had them at like 40% chance to win at that time.

477
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:12.370
Um,
and he had like a 70% chance you're something.

478
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.190
And so,
you know,
I,

479
00:30:14.191 --> 00:30:18.640
I didn't make a ton of money off of it because it took me like a week to wire my

480
00:30:18.641 --> 00:30:20.350
money to Ireland.

481
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:25.480
And in the time that I was wiring my money,
he had one,
a couple of minutes.

482
00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:31.680
And so,
um,
you know,
I ended up only making,
I mean I made like,
you know,

483
00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:33.250
a thousand,
$1,200,

484
00:30:33.251 --> 00:30:36.520
which for me as a college student was all the money in the world.
Uh,

485
00:30:36.521 --> 00:30:38.680
but more faithfully,
uh,

486
00:30:38.681 --> 00:30:42.250
I was telling that story just like I'm telling it to you,
uh,

487
00:30:42.251 --> 00:30:47.251
to a friend of mine who worked in Chicago and he was a traitor.

488
00:30:48.041 --> 00:30:50.200
He's a bond trader.
And I was telling,

489
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:53.650
I was telling him that story and he told me,
you know,
the,

490
00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:59.010
the one differentiator between successful traders and unsuccessful traders in

491
00:31:00.281 --> 00:31:04.630
our office is their,
um,
their comfort with risk taking.

492
00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:09.040
Uh,
and based on that story,
um,
you know,

493
00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:12.010
I would like you to talk to my boss.
Um,

494
00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:16.030
and so based on the extreme prudence,

495
00:31:16.031 --> 00:31:20.270
you've demonstrated that story.
Well,
yeah,

496
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.950
it's the,
you know,
I think,
I think it was kind of the,

497
00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:28.720
the comes with risk taking.
And so,
you know,
at that time I was,

498
00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.230
you know,
I,
I didn't know what I wanted to do.
Again.

499
00:31:32.231 --> 00:31:36.550
I just studied history because I was,
I enjoyed it and I,
uh,
I really enjoyed it.

500
00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:37.540
Um,

501
00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:42.540
and so he got me an interview with his boss and it was scheduled and I mean,

502
00:31:43.361 --> 00:31:45.910
this is somebody who went to an ivy league school and you know,

503
00:31:45.911 --> 00:31:49.060
he had studied finances entire life.
And he had gotten this job.

504
00:31:49.061 --> 00:31:51.220
So I thought this was an opportunity.

505
00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:54.100
I would not have any other way.

506
00:31:54.101 --> 00:31:57.760
And I wasn't sure what I wanted to do at the time.
It was a history major.
Um,

507
00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.950
and so I had like a month to prepare,

508
00:31:59.951 --> 00:32:04.040
so I read about 20 books on the market.
Uh,

509
00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:07.300
and then I went into the interview.
And,
uh,

510
00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:12.690
at that time I was very well versed on how markets worked.

511
00:32:12.791 --> 00:32:15.040
And,
uh,
that's how I got that job.

512
00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:18.970
Good thing yet all that reading practice go.

513
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:25.420
What was your first week as a bond trader?
Like,
um,
well I mean,

514
00:32:25.421 --> 00:32:29.590
and see this is the,
and I always try to say,
you know,
when I,
uh,

515
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.320
mean if somebody that's just listening to this interview up until this point,

516
00:32:35.321 --> 00:32:39.350
you know,
I think it's,
we talk about,
you know,
bond trading and dictators,

517
00:32:39.351 --> 00:32:40.184
you know,

518
00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.850
<v 4>which really has nothing to do with my life now.
Um,
but you know,
I,</v>

519
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.330
and,

520
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:51.230
and I think the narrative that people in interviews always try to put on me is

521
00:32:51.231 --> 00:32:56.090
that I,
cause,
I mean,
it's a fun narrative.
Oh,
chasing the money,
you know,

522
00:32:56.091 --> 00:33:00.320
doing this soul sucking finance job and then,
you know,

523
00:33:00.321 --> 00:33:03.560
cut the rope behind him to pursue his true passion,

524
00:33:03.561 --> 00:33:07.010
which was taking photographs and art.
And I mean,
there's a,

525
00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:11.910
there's a kernel of truth there.
Um,
you know,
but the,

526
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:16.700
the real story is that markets were fascinating to me.
I,
you know,
I,
I,

527
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.710
I'm still fascinated by markets.
You know,

528
00:33:18.711 --> 00:33:23.711
they seem so tangible when you're watching CNBC and you're seeing these numbers

529
00:33:24.261 --> 00:33:26.360
and it seems all so mathematical,

530
00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:31.040
but in reality markets or are nothing but a bunch of people arguing over what

531
00:33:31.041 --> 00:33:35.990
something's worth.
You know,
it's just like,
it's a market.

532
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:39.320
If you,
if you remove the computer and you know,
go back,
you know,

533
00:33:39.321 --> 00:33:44.321
50 years and market is a crowd of people haggling over what's something that is

534
00:33:45.621 --> 00:33:48.980
impossible to value is worth.
And the,
the,

535
00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:50.840
the number that comes out of it is,

536
00:33:50.841 --> 00:33:55.340
is really based on psychology and it's based on this,
this back and forth over,

537
00:33:55.341 --> 00:33:59.120
over,
you know,
what these numbers mean.
And you know,

538
00:33:59.121 --> 00:34:03.860
that was always so interesting to me.
Um,
and it remains,
you know,

539
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:08.690
very interesting to me.
So it was philosophically very interested in markets and,

540
00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:13.670
uh,
I was,
I,
I was fascinated by bond trading and,
you know,
I,

541
00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:18.440
I was obsessed with it to be honest,
for two years.
Um,

542
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:22.670
and it was a type of bond trading.
We were very highly leveraged.

543
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:24.650
And so,
you know,

544
00:34:24.651 --> 00:34:29.510
it was a time where there was just huge gains,
are huge losses,

545
00:34:29.511 --> 00:34:31.580
like every single night.
Uh,
you know,

546
00:34:31.581 --> 00:34:35.570
I compare it to like playing it very high stakes game of poker every single

547
00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:40.370
night.
And so it was,
it was extremely,

548
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.220
uh,
you know,
I don't think I could do it today.

549
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:45.710
I was in my early twenties at the time.
It was just,

550
00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:50.570
there's just adrenaline pumping through my body at all times.
And,

551
00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:53.930
you know,
I was in,
in that when you,

552
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:56.800
when you take something that is your,

553
00:34:56.801 --> 00:35:01.801
you're naturally kind of philosophically interested in it and you pair it with,

554
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.020
um,
you know,
a large amount of money,
uh,

555
00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:10.490
and a large amount of excitement,
it creates this,
this fixation.

556
00:35:10.491 --> 00:35:12.380
It's almost like crack,
you know,

557
00:35:12.381 --> 00:35:15.860
where it's just all you can think about at any given time.

558
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:17.390
And you know,

559
00:35:17.391 --> 00:35:22.160
when I go to colleges and I give speeches on the path of humans of New York,

560
00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.690
and you know,

561
00:35:23.691 --> 00:35:28.310
what led me to kind of pursue this life that was,
you know,

562
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:32.750
outside of books and outside of computer screens was that,

563
00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:37.040
you know,
I,
after the end of two years when I lost my job,

564
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:40.200
I kind of looked back at,
you know,

565
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:43.270
the time that I had spent that two years and it,

566
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:48.320
it wasn't the physical time that was lost that was most concerning to me.

567
00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:54.830
It was that I had spent two years using all of my intellect and all of my

568
00:35:56.251 --> 00:36:01.251
creative energy trying to figure out how to be the most effective relative value

569
00:36:02.161 --> 00:36:07.110
treater in fixed income securities and the Asian markets.
It was something,

570
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:13.460
it was just something that was so narrow and so myopic and I couldn't even talk

571
00:36:14.251 --> 00:36:19.100
with my friends about it.
And at the end of two years,
you know,

572
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:21.420
that was,
we'd gone through the financial crisis.

573
00:36:21.421 --> 00:36:24.540
I've lost everything I'd ever made.
You know,
when I,

574
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:27.480
when I lost that job was a very lucrative job potentially.

575
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:31.200
But when I lost that job,
I was broke because I lost everything.

576
00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:35.460
Why did you lose the job?
What happened?
Uh,
well,
I mean the,
it,

577
00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:40.150
it depends upon how much personal responsibility I want to take.
You know,

578
00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.220
I think the,
the,

579
00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:42.510
<v 3>the,
the,</v>

580
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:47.570
the narrative that's most protective of the ego is that we had a type of

581
00:36:48.211 --> 00:36:53.211
treating that was calibrated to work during periods of low volatility.

582
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:55.770
Um,

583
00:36:55.770 --> 00:37:00.770
the years from I guess 1995 or whatever,

584
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.850
or after,
whenever,
you know,
I don't,
I don't know when my math is right.

585
00:37:05.851 --> 00:37:09.210
But you know,
like late nineties,
two,
you know,

586
00:37:09.211 --> 00:37:13.410
2008 were periods of historically low volatility or the type of training that we

587
00:37:13.411 --> 00:37:16.500
were doing worked.
And during,

588
00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:21.270
when the financial crisis hit in 2008,
volatility went through the roof.

589
00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:25.920
A long story short,
the type of trading that we were doing,
um,

590
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.720
stopped working.
And,
uh,

591
00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:33.740
the company when that had been around for over a decade was out of business,

592
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:39.810
uh,
about a year after I left.
Um,
so that's the,
that is the,

593
00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:42.600
the part of the,
that's the way of explaining that,

594
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.540
that avoids the most personal responsibility.
Um,

595
00:37:45.541 --> 00:37:47.790
if I was to explain it in the way that,
you know,

596
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:51.030
makes myself the most personally responsible,
uh,

597
00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:56.090
market's changed and I wasn't a adaptive enough to figure it out.

598
00:37:56.730 --> 00:38:01.380
Uh,
I kept banging my head against the same things that used to be working.
Uh,

599
00:38:01.381 --> 00:38:02.640
I refuse to,

600
00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:07.800
I refuse to fully embrace the fact that what worked for me extremely well for a

601
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:11.660
year had stopped working.
Uh,
and because of that,
the,
the,

602
00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:12.900
the risk calculations,

603
00:38:12.901 --> 00:38:15.330
it changed and instead of making a lot of money every night,

604
00:38:15.331 --> 00:38:18.150
I was losing a lot of money every night.
Um,

605
00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:21.330
and I eventually got to the point where,
you know,
I,

606
00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:25.590
I was no longer a productive member of the firm.
Uh,

607
00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:29.310
and so yeah,
it depends upon which story you want to tell.

608
00:38:29.311 --> 00:38:33.480
I think the truth is probably somewhere in between the two.
Uh,

609
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:36.040
but regardless,
I ended without

610
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.023
<v 5>a job.</v>

611
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:43.060
Well thank you for telling or sharing both versions of that and no,
it's,
it's,

612
00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:43.660
it's,

613
00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:48.660
I think that that also reflects a level of,

614
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:52.210
this may not be the right word,

615
00:38:52.211 --> 00:38:56.740
but sort of objectivity or an ability to detach and observe.

616
00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:00.480
That has always fascinated me,
uh,
about you quite frankly.
Um,

617
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:05.020
which certainly translates I think in a very empathic way later and we'll,

618
00:39:05.021 --> 00:39:06.640
we'll get to that.

619
00:39:06.641 --> 00:39:11.410
But I want to talk about the finance world and markets for just a second because

620
00:39:11.411 --> 00:39:12.510
as you noted,
it's,

621
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:17.630
it's very tempting for someone who's trying to weave a narrative of your life

622
00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:24.850
into this soul sucking periods,
sees the light cuts,
the tether,

623
00:39:24.851 --> 00:39:28.000
Burns the ships off into the arts and true passion.

624
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:32.980
But the,
the markets,
as you noted,
a really fascinating,

625
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:36.060
and I was chatting with someone,

626
00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:40.210
I've just gotten to know actually in the last few weeks a,
let's call,

627
00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:41.920
suppose you could call them a wealth manager,

628
00:39:41.921 --> 00:39:45.250
but 75% of what he does and is investing in bonds.

629
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:48.390
He probably wouldn't call it trading,
but in effect,
I mean,
that's,

630
00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.233
that's what he's doing.

631
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:54.810
And he said something to me that that has stuck in my mind for a while now,

632
00:39:54.851 --> 00:39:55.720
which is,
you know,

633
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:59.920
I learned more in the first two to four hours of sitting down and talking to

634
00:39:59.921 --> 00:40:00.910
someone about money.

635
00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:06.240
Then their therapists have probably learned over the last two to four years and

636
00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:11.400
getting to see how people respond to money and loss aversion and the possibility

637
00:40:14.291 --> 00:40:17.650
of making money is in and of itself.
Fascinating.

638
00:40:17.651 --> 00:40:21.010
Then you add in thousands and millions of market participants,

639
00:40:21.011 --> 00:40:23.950
it gets even more interesting.
And then when,

640
00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.860
at least in my limited experience when I read something,

641
00:40:26.861 --> 00:40:28.240
my exposure to bonds is very limited.

642
00:40:28.241 --> 00:40:31.840
But when you read something like Liar's poker,
uh,
by Michael Lewis,

643
00:40:31.841 --> 00:40:33.400
which I think is a fantastic book.

644
00:40:33.401 --> 00:40:36.070
And the part that stuck out to me where I was like,
okay,

645
00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:39.430
I need to be very careful about playing this game because I'll get my face

646
00:40:39.431 --> 00:40:43.690
ripped off is there's some part,
and I'm going to get all the details wrong,

647
00:40:43.691 --> 00:40:47.770
but there's some guy who's nicknamed like fat Tony and he's a big wig at Solomon

648
00:40:47.771 --> 00:40:52.690
brothers.
And he bets his buddies that the markets for whatever,

649
00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:55.780
Aa bonds and x,
y,
and z are going up.
And he said,

650
00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:00.490
he bets them and it's this Dick measuring contest and he puts 50 million into

651
00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:03.790
the market and it,
and it goes down.
And uh,

652
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:07.170
and so as his friends are busting his balls and he's then they're like,
oh,

653
00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.600
market's going up.
Ah,
and so instead of putting 50 million,
and he's like,
fuck it.

654
00:41:10.601 --> 00:41:14.080
And he puts 500 million in like all the other market participants,

655
00:41:14.081 --> 00:41:16.870
panic thinking that he has information they don't.

656
00:41:16.871 --> 00:41:19.990
And so the market goes up and he said,
see,
I told you the market was going up.

657
00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:22.630
And I was like,
oh my God,

658
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:27.400
this is not nearly as clean as the textbooks would want you to believe.

659
00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.820
<v 6>Well,
I would,
I would,
um,
you know,
I,</v>

660
00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:34.910
as somebody who's interviewed 10,000 people,
I would say that,
you know,

661
00:41:34.911 --> 00:41:38.510
talking with somebody about their money and how they choose to use their money,

662
00:41:38.511 --> 00:41:43.230
we'll give you a insight into a very limited,
uh,
a,
an I,

663
00:41:43.231 --> 00:41:45.160
I mean,
maybe,
maybe I'm wrong,

664
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:48.050
but like a very limited aspect of their personality,

665
00:41:48.051 --> 00:41:51.620
which is their comfort with risk.
And,
uh,
you know,
I think there's,

666
00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:56.170
I think our approach to money and our approach to treating or punched to two

667
00:41:56.171 --> 00:42:00.770
markets are very much kind of driven by like our,
our animal spirits,
you know,

668
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:02.230
greed and fear and

669
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:06.850
<v 3>things like that.
Um,
but,
you know,
I,
I feel that the,</v>

670
00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:10.990
you know,
kind of the,
the,
there's a huge,

671
00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:15.700
a huge portion of people's lives and kind of thought lives that are,

672
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.480
um,
you know,
kind of separate and isolated from,

673
00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:23.290
from that,
those drives,
you know what I mean?
Those,

674
00:42:23.291 --> 00:42:26.380
those very kind of primal drives of wanting,

675
00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:29.740
wanting more and being afraid to lose.
I mean,
that's,

676
00:42:29.741 --> 00:42:32.900
that's really what drives the markets is,
is the,

677
00:42:33.010 --> 00:42:36.940
is the greed and the fear is,
and I,
you know,
I think,

678
00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:41.530
I think talking with somebody about their,
you know,
their,

679
00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:42.101
those,

680
00:42:42.101 --> 00:42:45.850
those two drives and where their greed comes from or where their fear comes
from,

681
00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:50.080
you know,
it'll,
it'll give you,
it'll give you,
it'll give you some insight.
But,

682
00:42:50.081 --> 00:42:54.580
you know,
I,
they know,
to me,
the,
the markets,

683
00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:58.370
you know,
they,
there's,
they,

684
00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:02.710
they can only tell you so much.
Um,
and they can only,
you know,

685
00:43:02.711 --> 00:43:07.030
it's such a,
it's such a,
it's,
it's a part of human existence.
The,
the,

686
00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:11.620
the drives that,
that control a market.
Um,
but,
you know,

687
00:43:11.621 --> 00:43:14.950
there's so much that people care about outside of that.

688
00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:19.900
And I think that was what was so dangerous about just being a trader is that,

689
00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:22.000
you know,
you're,
you're,

690
00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:27.060
you're bearing so much of your thought energy into just the desire for more and

691
00:43:28.151 --> 00:43:32.140
the fear of losing,
you know what I mean?
That kind of the kind of narrow,

692
00:43:32.141 --> 00:43:35.580
animalistic drives that,
that you know,
that,

693
00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:39.700
that push market ups up and down and you're kind of tethering yourself to that,

694
00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:40.750
uh,

695
00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:45.750
and you just kind of miss out on so much of the life that's going on around you.

696
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:48.790
And this is me.
You know,
this is me.

697
00:43:48.791 --> 00:43:53.410
I think it's part of my personality that once I dive into something,
it's,

698
00:43:53.411 --> 00:43:56.740
I do it to the exclusion of almost everything else.
Uh,

699
00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:01.090
one of the reasons humans of New York,
uh,
ended up becoming so successful.
Uh,

700
00:44:01.091 --> 00:44:05.860
I did know,
you know,
some,
uh,
you know,
miss more the exception than the rule.

701
00:44:05.861 --> 00:44:10.861
There are people who are so in control of their emotions or maybe they don't

702
00:44:11.261 --> 00:44:14.710
have the same emotional range as other people,
um,

703
00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:17.980
that are able to turn off their computer every single day,

704
00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:22.540
go home and not think about the markets and come kind of completely leave them

705
00:44:22.541 --> 00:44:26.830
there.
Um,
but you know,
for me it was something that,

706
00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:30.910
you know,
was kind of all consuming for me.
And you know,

707
00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:32.430
I made the

708
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:36.300
<v 4>decision to pursue something more artistic,
um,</v>

709
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.880
was when,
you know,
I had kind of,

710
00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:43.900
I had kind of lost my job and I was looking back at the two years of my life and

711
00:44:44.101 --> 00:44:48.410
I was thinking,
God,
you know,
and,
and after I lost my job,
you know,
I,

712
00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:51.990
I was so scared of that day,
you know,

713
00:44:51.991 --> 00:44:55.800
during the two years when I was obsessing over markets and then things started

714
00:44:55.801 --> 00:44:57.210
going bad,
you know,

715
00:44:57.211 --> 00:45:01.200
there was nothing I was more afraid of than losing that job.

716
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:03.510
And then on the day that it happened,

717
00:45:03.511 --> 00:45:08.511
it was surprisingly a good day because I remember taking a walk that day and I

718
00:45:08.911 --> 00:45:12.940
started asking myself things like,
what do I want to do?
You know,
like what,

719
00:45:12.941 --> 00:45:15.300
what do I want to do?
Things?

720
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:19.290
Something like if I could do anything with my time,
what would I do?

721
00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.680
And I had,
I had been for two years,

722
00:45:22.681 --> 00:45:27.570
like so focused on keeping that job,
you know,
that I had,

723
00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.670
I,
I had never,

724
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:34.440
I didn't have room in my brain to kind of ask myself any other questions.

725
00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.830
And so,
you know,
at that moment I decided,
you know,

726
00:45:37.831 --> 00:45:41.580
I've lost these two years of not only my time,
but more importantly,

727
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:46.200
I've lost two years of my thoughts focusing on this,

728
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:48.690
this,
this game,

729
00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:51.390
this game for making money,

730
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:56.160
which was fascinating and philosophically interesting.
But you know,
when you,

731
00:45:56.220 --> 00:46:00.060
when you boil it down,
it's a game.
And I said,
you know,

732
00:46:00.061 --> 00:46:04.920
I'm going to spend the next foreseeable future instead of my spending my time

733
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.730
trying to make money.
You know,

734
00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:12.740
I'm going to try to make just enough money to where I can control my time and

735
00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:17.190
just do something that I enjoy doing for no other reason,

736
00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:19.800
then it is nourishing in the moment.

737
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:23.370
Not that at the end of the day I'm going to have a profit,

738
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:26.550
but because it's nourishing in the moment.

739
00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:31.890
And at that time it was photography and the whole reason I think you don't want

740
00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:33.510
of the best,
you know,

741
00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:38.560
the kind of the neatest things about humans of New York is that over the past

742
00:46:38.881 --> 00:46:43.800
eight years,
you know,
humans of New York has become largely,
you know,
the most,

743
00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:44.071
you know,

744
00:46:44.071 --> 00:46:49.071
followed photography project in the world with 25 million on social media now.

745
00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.090
And it's eight years old.

746
00:46:51.091 --> 00:46:53.850
And I think one of the coolest things is I just started photographing about

747
00:46:53.851 --> 00:46:55.560
eight years ago.
You know,

748
00:46:55.561 --> 00:46:59.160
I started taking photos during this time that I'm talking with you about.

749
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:04.700
And the whole reason I started taking photos was because I was trying to create

750
00:47:04.771 --> 00:47:06.840
some space in my mind away from work.

751
00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:12.240
I was desperate for something to do on the weekends that,

752
00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:16.020
you know,
d that would,
would give me this,

753
00:47:16.021 --> 00:47:20.610
this foot hold in my brain where I had a sense of purpose and he sense of

754
00:47:20.611 --> 00:47:24.030
identity outside how the markets were doing every single day.

755
00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:27.510
And so I bought this camera,

756
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:32.650
I started going to downtown and photographing,
you know,
just everything.

757
00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:34.540
Uh,
and I loved it.

758
00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:39.730
And not long after I lost my job and I made the decision that I was going to be

759
00:47:39.731 --> 00:47:43.930
a photographer,
not because I was very skilled at it at the time,
you know,

760
00:47:43.931 --> 00:47:48.340
not because I thought it was an angle towards success and not because I thought

761
00:47:48.341 --> 00:47:53.110
it was an angle towards an audience is that I just loved doing it in the moment.

762
00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:54.730
It was nourishing in the moment.

763
00:47:55.270 --> 00:48:00.100
And so I found this thing that was nourishing in the moment that I enjoyed
doing.

764
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:01.750
And I said,
you know,

765
00:48:01.751 --> 00:48:06.751
I'm going to try to structure my life around creating as much time for this as

766
00:48:07.031 --> 00:48:10.600
possible.
I want to make the minimum amount of,
I just,

767
00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:13.720
I want to make just enough money to where I can pay my rent,

768
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:15.610
eat and photograph all day long.

769
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:21.150
And the journey that ended up creating humans of New York was my attempt to

770
00:48:22.811 --> 00:48:27.811
create that space in my life and that space in my head to focus on something

771
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:30.310
that was very nourishing in the moment.

772
00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:36.420
How did you cover your expenses in the very early days of that experience?

773
00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:42.220
This was 2008.
Um,
we had a,

774
00:48:42.221 --> 00:48:43.180
I believe

775
00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:49.680
a record amount of time that you could get unemployment and I had just lost my

776
00:48:50.561 --> 00:48:51.394
job.

777
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:55.720
And so I got $620,

778
00:48:55.721 --> 00:48:58.960
I think every two weeks,
uh,

779
00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:03.790
from the government because I was unemployed and I had worked for two years.

780
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:04.901
Um,

781
00:49:04.901 --> 00:49:09.901
so that was enough to basically just pay my rent in a sublease that I found on

782
00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:20.320
craigslist,
uh,
and Bedford Stuyvesant Brooklyn,
uh,

783
00:49:20.321 --> 00:49:25.321
that was enough to pay that and maybe have peanut butter jelly sandwiches and

784
00:49:26.591 --> 00:49:27.424
eggs.

785
00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:32.380
I'm assuming that you need to know other expenses that you wore the same

786
00:49:32.381 --> 00:49:34.270
clothes,
the same shoes.

787
00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:38.620
That was enough for me to just eat,

788
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:42.370
sleep and photograph all day long.
Um,

789
00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:45.370
and once I got to have a,
you know,

790
00:49:45.371 --> 00:49:50.050
a decent level of skill and I mean,
just a passable level of skill,

791
00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:53.980
uh,
if anybody would pay me to take portraits for them,
I would do that.
I,

792
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:58.750
somebody hired me to do their wedding.
Um,
and,
uh,

793
00:49:58.751 --> 00:50:02.710
I basically,
I just,
I didn't spend money on anything.

794
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:06.820
All I did was photograph all day long because I knew that I was like,

795
00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:10.210
I was making this pivot in my life to where I was going after kind of a

796
00:50:10.211 --> 00:50:12.130
lucrative career towards,

797
00:50:12.131 --> 00:50:17.131
I was going towards just wanting to spend my time doing something all day long.

798
00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.990
Uh,
and so,
you know,

799
00:50:19.991 --> 00:50:22.960
and I became obsessed with photography in the same way that I was obsessed with

800
00:50:22.961 --> 00:50:27.140
markets.
I mean,
I just,
I loved it.
I just loved it.

801
00:50:27.141 --> 00:50:28.700
It was like a treasure hot.
I mean,

802
00:50:28.701 --> 00:50:33.110
just going out and was so different than trading too.
I mean,
it was,

803
00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:38.030
I'm outside,
I'm interacting with the world,
I'm having conversations,

804
00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:43.250
you know,
I'm having these little adventures,
discovering these new things,

805
00:50:43.251 --> 00:50:47.840
and I was just hooked on it and I was just obsessed with it.
And you know,

806
00:50:47.841 --> 00:50:52.841
I knew I was making a lot of sacrifices to be doing this in my life.

807
00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:56.540
Uh,
so I didn't do anything else.
You know,
I didn't go to concerts.

808
00:50:56.541 --> 00:50:58.670
I didn't go out to restaurants.
I really,

809
00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:02.780
I didn't spend much time with friends because I didn't really know anybody in

810
00:51:02.781 --> 00:51:04.280
New York.
Uh,
I mean,

811
00:51:04.281 --> 00:51:08.390
that's another crazy detail about humans of New York is that humans of New York

812
00:51:08.391 --> 00:51:12.200
is an eight year old photography project.
Uh,
you know,

813
00:51:12.201 --> 00:51:15.650
based on people in New York City.
Uh,
you know,

814
00:51:15.651 --> 00:51:19.340
I took my first foot photograph eight years ago and I went to New York for the

815
00:51:19.341 --> 00:51:24.260
very first time in my life eight years ago.
Uh,
so it was,
you know,
all,

816
00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:29.410
it was all just a very new and all very driven by the desire to photograph all

817
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.380
day long.

818
00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:35.380
Was the move to New York related to the desire to take photographs or was it

819
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:40.730
something else?
So,
I mean,
what I did is,
so I got fired,

820
00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:45.120
uh,
and I started,
my goal was I got it.

821
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:49.340
I want to find out how to be a photographer.
You know,
I love photography.

822
00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:54.500
How am I going to create a life where I can support myself and photograph all

823
00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:58.490
day long?
And so I was just out doing it every single day.

824
00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:03.260
And then I started kind of along with the graffiti and along with the

825
00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:07.400
architectural shots and along with the nature shots,

826
00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:12.530
I started photographing people and I noticed that these,

827
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:14.450
out of everything I was photographing,

828
00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:18.020
the photographs of people were the most unique.

829
00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:23.390
They're the ones that that least resembled everything else I was seeing being

830
00:52:23.391 --> 00:52:26.510
put on Facebook and stuff like that.
Um,

831
00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:30.200
and so I decided to kind of focus on that.

832
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:33.860
And then while focusing on that,

833
00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:38.890
I started stopping people on the street and asking for their photo and kind of

834
00:52:39.591 --> 00:52:40.940
taking a portrait of them.

835
00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:46.280
And because of that extra layer of difficulty of having to approach a stranger,

836
00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.050
the portrait.

837
00:52:48.051 --> 00:52:53.051
So that was taking of people were more different than the candid photos I was

838
00:52:54.711 --> 00:52:59.270
taking of people.
And so I started focusing solely on that,
you know,

839
00:52:59.271 --> 00:53:03.440
and that's when I kind of started having an idea that even though I hadn't been

840
00:53:03.441 --> 00:53:04.850
photographing so long,

841
00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:09.880
I was heading in a direction that was pretty unique because I was stopping

842
00:53:10.341 --> 00:53:15.290
random people on the streets.
Um,
in a very,

843
00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:17.810
you know,
I know some people will do series,

844
00:53:17.811 --> 00:53:21.650
but I was doing this every single day and I was getting quite a collection and

845
00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:25.250
this seems like kind of a new kind of fresh type of photography.

846
00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:28.980
So it's all I did.
And then I started traveling to different cities.

847
00:53:28.981 --> 00:53:33.600
I went to Philadelphia just stopping people.
Then I went to New Orleans.
Um,

848
00:53:33.850 --> 00:53:38.850
I went back to Atlanta and did this and then I traveled to New York and when I

849
00:53:40.051 --> 00:53:45.051
got to New York and I was stopping people and asking for their photographs,

850
00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:48.570
um,
I realized that New York,

851
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:53.280
if you were going to try to do this type of photography was the best place to
be.

852
00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:58.560
I mean,
mainly just,
just practical reasons,
uh,
that you,

853
00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:02.640
you don't need a car in New York.
I didn't have a car.
Um,

854
00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:06.840
and I couldn't afford a car.
You,
uh,
you can just ride the subway everywhere.

855
00:54:06.841 --> 00:54:10.560
You can walk everywhere.
And there's so many people.
I mean,

856
00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:12.060
there's so many people.

857
00:54:12.061 --> 00:54:17.061
I remember coming out of the Lincoln tunnel the very first time and looking down

858
00:54:17.221 --> 00:54:19.350
and I couldn't even see the sidewalk.
Let's rush.

859
00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:23.850
It was rush hour and that it was just,
there were so many people and I thought,

860
00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:27.790
you know,
if I'm going to do this type of photography,
uh,

861
00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:32.400
this is the place to do it.
And I wasn't doing any interviews at this time.

862
00:54:32.401 --> 00:54:33.900
And I mean that's,
that's the thing,

863
00:54:33.901 --> 00:54:38.901
it's like the humans of New York that I moved to New York to do looks nothing

864
00:54:39.031 --> 00:54:42.660
like the humans of New York that later became successful.
I mean,

865
00:54:42.661 --> 00:54:46.950
it was really just the impetus to get me on the ground working every day to kind

866
00:54:46.951 --> 00:54:49.890
of figure it out along the way.
Uh,
you know,

867
00:54:49.891 --> 00:54:54.891
my very first idea for humans of New York was I was going to photograph 10,000

868
00:54:55.711 --> 00:55:00.180
people in New York City across all five boroughs and I was going to plot their

869
00:55:00.181 --> 00:55:01.110
photo on a map.

870
00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:06.620
That was my idea of how I was going to make a life out of being a photographers.

871
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:11.550
I was going to be the guy who did that.
And,
uh,
it was,

872
00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:14.670
that was kind of what got me on the grounds,

873
00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:17.970
got me out on the street every single day,

874
00:55:17.971 --> 00:55:21.420
approaching hundreds and thousands of people,
uh,

875
00:55:21.421 --> 00:55:26.421
and put me in the situation where I could kind of innovate and I could start

876
00:55:27.481 --> 00:55:29.430
having conversations with these people,

877
00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:32.880
which turned into questions I was asking them,

878
00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:37.020
which turned into eventually seven years later,

879
00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:42.120
the kind of 90 minute to an hour and a half long,

880
00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:46.180
very kind of probing and,
and therapeutic and,

881
00:55:46.181 --> 00:55:51.181
and psychological interviews that I have with random strangers every single day.

882
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:56.460
The result of which,
and the output of which,
uh,

883
00:55:56.490 --> 00:56:01.490
became the stories that I think people are so connected with and the stories

884
00:56:02.971 --> 00:56:05.310
that really make humans of New York humans of New York.

885
00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:09.900
How are you getting better at photography,
uh,

886
00:56:09.930 --> 00:56:13.770
during this say first,
let's just call it six month period.

887
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:19.190
Since you certainly seem from all indications to be someone who goes for total

888
00:56:20.071 --> 00:56:23.040
immersion and whether it's reading 10 to 20 books,

889
00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:26.080
the market before an interview,
uh,

890
00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:30.580
you go 100% into whatever subject matter you choose.

891
00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:33.250
How are you getting better?
What books were you reading?
Who are you studying?

892
00:56:33.251 --> 00:56:34.330
What were you trying,

893
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:39.990
I mean I was too addicted to taking photos to ever stop for a second and learn

894
00:56:41.501 --> 00:56:46.030
about photography.
I have,
I have one memory.

895
00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:49.960
I have one memory of going to Barnes and noble cause I going to afford to buy

896
00:56:49.961 --> 00:56:51.220
any books.
Uh,

897
00:56:51.221 --> 00:56:54.640
I have one memory of going to Barnes and noble one night and flipping through

898
00:56:54.641 --> 00:56:58.180
some photography books and,
and enjoying the photos.

899
00:56:58.181 --> 00:57:03.130
But uh,
I just,
I,
I just wanted to be out taking pictures.

900
00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:07.810
You know,
I,
I didn't really want to be studying how to take a correct photo,

901
00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:12.220
you know,
I just wanted to be out photographing.
It was the,
the act of it,

902
00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:14.500
the act of discovery,
you know,

903
00:57:14.501 --> 00:57:19.060
and I had a very amateur view of photography at the time.

904
00:57:19.061 --> 00:57:23.170
Where is if you,
if you get something or somebody interesting in the frame,

905
00:57:23.171 --> 00:57:27.040
it's a great photo.
I don't care how many points perspective it has.

906
00:57:27.041 --> 00:57:28.780
I don't care about the rules of thirds.

907
00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:32.710
I honestly don't really even care about white balance or focus or any of these

908
00:57:32.711 --> 00:57:35.320
things.
I was just looking for,

909
00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:39.250
for wonderful people and wonderful moments that were happening.

910
00:57:39.251 --> 00:57:43.470
I was still doing a lot of candid photography of people.
Uh,
and if I,

911
00:57:43.471 --> 00:57:47.590
if I captured that,
that was a good photo and that's,
that's all I cared about.

912
00:57:48.070 --> 00:57:51.250
And that was what was driving me for these,
you know,

913
00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:54.430
these first several months and this first year,

914
00:57:54.431 --> 00:57:58.330
year and a half when I took thousands and thousands of pictures and I was

915
00:57:58.331 --> 00:58:01.600
getting better slowly.
I mean,
I'm,
I'm,

916
00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:06.960
I'm not necessarily bragging about that kind of aversion to formal training as

917
00:58:07.331 --> 00:58:09.250
if it was some sort of badge of honor.

918
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:14.670
It was just the way my psychology was hardwired and because of that I might have

919
00:58:16.151 --> 00:58:19.840
improved more slowly than somebody else.

920
00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:25.180
And in fact,
I might've been proved so slowly that I'm sure a lot of professional

921
00:58:25.181 --> 00:58:27.670
photographers look down on my photography still.

922
00:58:28.450 --> 00:58:33.450
But by being that engaged and emerged in the process as opposed to any sort of a

923
00:58:37.061 --> 00:58:40.030
formal structure of what makes a photograph,

924
00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:43.540
I innovated my own style.

925
00:58:43.541 --> 00:58:48.541
I innovated my own type of work that leader on,

926
00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:49.661
you know,

927
00:58:49.661 --> 00:58:54.550
people have introduced me to studs Terkel and people introduced me to,

928
00:58:54.551 --> 00:58:56.350
you know,
to these,
these,

929
00:58:56.351 --> 00:59:01.100
these wonderful photographers to the past who took these,
you know,
you know,

930
00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:06.310
Jacob Reese who took these wonderful photos of regular people,

931
00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:10.540
uh,
that my work,
you know,
kind of grew to resemble.

932
00:59:11.290 --> 00:59:12.070
But I mean,

933
00:59:12.070 --> 00:59:17.070
any resemblance just came out of being on the street and doing it all day long

934
00:59:18.521 --> 00:59:22.100
and just,
and,
and figuring out,
you know,
what it was that I

935
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:27.100
<v 3>liked the most and without any education of what it correct photograph was.</v>

936
00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:28.281
And that,
you know,

937
00:59:28.281 --> 00:59:32.960
I think if humans of New York has original elements,

938
00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:36.860
if humans of New York is original in any way,

939
00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:41.660
it was because I was just so addicted to taking photos that I never stopped to

940
00:59:41.661 --> 00:59:46.570
learn about photography.
And because of that,
you know,
I,

941
00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:48.650
I just,
I was figuring out as I went on,

942
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:50.110
<v 5>well,</v>

943
00:59:50.110 --> 00:59:55.110
it seems to me also that there are many different facets of photography.

944
00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:58.990
One component of which is the technical knowledge,

945
00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:03.520
but certainly another component of which is choosing the subject matter.

946
01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:08.290
Right.
And thinking about the story that an image tells.

947
01:00:08.291 --> 01:00:09.880
So you were learning about photography,

948
01:00:09.881 --> 01:00:14.881
but you were doing at visa vi the sheer volume of experience that you were

949
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:18.400
gathering behind the camera and walking through New York City.

950
01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:22.460
<v 3>Right.
Well,
I was just,
you know,
I was looking for anyone who,</v>

951
01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:27.260
anything that captured my attention or curiosity at all got photographed.
I mean,

952
01:00:27.261 --> 01:00:30.260
and that's one of the beautiful things about digital cameras is,
I mean,

953
01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:33.860
you can just take a thousand photos every single day.
Um,

954
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:36.890
and so you don't have to worry about conserving film.

955
01:00:36.891 --> 01:00:39.200
Like you can just photograph everything.

956
01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:44.480
And so anything that caught my eye got photographed.
And then when you go home,

957
01:00:44.481 --> 01:00:48.440
when you load your thousand pictures on the computer and you start going through

958
01:00:48.441 --> 01:00:50.660
and because you don't know how to photograph,

959
01:00:50.661 --> 01:00:54.890
you photograph that person 50 different times and you're looking at your 50

960
01:00:54.891 --> 01:00:59.510
photos of each person and you're finding the one that you think looks the best,

961
01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:02.540
and then you're going and you're doing it again and you're doing it again,

962
01:01:02.541 --> 01:01:05.630
and suddenly you're not taking 50 photos of each person.

963
01:01:05.631 --> 01:01:10.631
You're taking 40 even 30 then 20 and then 10 as you start to get an idea of what

964
01:01:11.541 --> 01:01:15.410
it is that you think is a great photo and what it is that you like.
Uh,

965
01:01:15.411 --> 01:01:19.250
and that was kind of really how I was honing in on my style again,

966
01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.710
which might still be considered primitive.

967
01:01:21.711 --> 01:01:24.620
It's still might be considered unschooled by a lot of people,

968
01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:29.420
but I was just honing in on what I liked about a photo.
Um,
and that's,

969
01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:30.680
that was the process.

970
01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:35.270
<v 5>What were you,
what were you doing with these photos in the,
in the beginning,</v>

971
01:01:35.271 --> 01:01:39.740
or maybe a better question is when you first started putting photos online,

972
01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:40.970
what did that look like?

973
01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:43.550
<v 3>Um,
at first I was putting the,</v>

974
01:01:43.570 --> 01:01:48.570
I had one of my main kind of weaknesses and blind spots in the beginning was not

975
01:01:50.571 --> 01:01:53.660
understanding the importance of daily content because,
you know,

976
01:01:53.661 --> 01:01:56.340
I had never had a blog before.
Um,

977
01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:59.510
and so I kind of had this great,

978
01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.880
and I mean it kind of mirrors my,

979
01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:05.810
my journey as a college student where I was like trying to do something huge

980
01:02:05.811 --> 01:02:10.310
instead of focusing on doing something every single day.
Um,
and so I was,

981
01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:14.780
I had this huge kind of sweeping project of I was going to photograph 10,000

982
01:02:14.781 --> 01:02:17.360
people and plot their photos on a map.

983
01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.100
I was dumping about 30 or 40 of these

984
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:24.690
<v 6>portraits every single day onto this website that I had that nobody was going to</v>

985
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:28.620
and the numbers,
I even had a counter on the top of the website counting,

986
01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:32.670
counting up to 10,000 because that's all I cared about was the end.

987
01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:33.990
I was going to get 10,000,

988
01:02:33.991 --> 01:02:37.710
I was going to create this sweeping photography project.
Um,

989
01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:40.560
was it called humans of New York at the time or what was it called?

990
01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:44.400
It was called humans of New York from the very beginning.
Yes.
Um,

991
01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:47.340
and it things really and,

992
01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:50.970
and nobody was really paying attention and I was taking hundreds and thousands

993
01:02:50.971 --> 01:02:55.971
of portraits and things really started to get traction when I started posting

994
01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:03.180
the photos as I got them on to social media,
mainly Facebook.

995
01:03:03.570 --> 01:03:08.570
That is when things really started to grow and the focus of humans of New York

996
01:03:09.421 --> 01:03:14.421
moved away from this giant sweeping project of that was going to cover the

997
01:03:17.461 --> 01:03:22.020
entire city of New York and be some sort of representation of New York City.

998
01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:27.540
And it's switched to much more too about the individual who is this person that

999
01:03:27.541 --> 01:03:29.070
I'm meeting each day.

1000
01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:33.660
And it became something more personal and immediate.
Uh,

1001
01:03:33.661 --> 01:03:37.710
and that's when things really started growing.
Brendan,

1002
01:03:37.711 --> 01:03:41.280
I'd love to ask you about the green lady.

1003
01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.720
If that rings a bell.

1004
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:47.870
Could you please describe for folks the experience of the Green Lady?

1005
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:50.940
So,
I mean,

1006
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I'm in New York and I've been trying to make this work,

1007
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.670
uh,
for bounce six months now.

1008
01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:05.270
And six months in that time of my life was probably the equivalent,

1009
01:04:05.941 --> 01:04:10.350
about two years of work,
uh,
because I worked every single day.

1010
01:04:10.410 --> 01:04:14.790
I worked on Christmas or worked on Thanksgiving.
Um,
I didn't go home.

1011
01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:19.830
All I did would just photograph all day long.
You know,
I would go out,

1012
01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:22.500
I would,
I would just photograph people had come home,

1013
01:04:22.501 --> 01:04:26.220
I would take a nap and then I would go out at night,
uh,

1014
01:04:26.221 --> 01:04:28.080
and try to get some more photos.

1015
01:04:28.650 --> 01:04:33.650
And so I had gotten thousands of these portraits and not many people were paying

1016
01:04:34.651 --> 01:04:35.221
attention.

1017
01:04:35.221 --> 01:04:40.221
I think I had just kind of started posting my photos on Facebook and,

1018
01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:40.710
um,

1019
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:45.710
I photographed this woman and she was dressed all in green and she had green

1020
01:04:47.911 --> 01:04:52.610
hair and green makeup.
And I remember it was a,

1021
01:04:52.611 --> 01:04:54.780
it was a photo that I,
I didn't like,

1022
01:04:54.781 --> 01:04:59.781
I thought it was a very bad photo and I wasn't even going to really posted on

1023
01:04:59.911 --> 01:05:04.350
the blog.
Uh,
but then I remembered that she had said something to me.

1024
01:05:04.351 --> 01:05:05.310
She had said,

1025
01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:09.480
I used to be a different color every single day,

1026
01:05:10.170 --> 01:05:13.230
but then one day I was green and that was a great day.

1027
01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:18.330
And so I've been green for 15 years
and

1028
01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:23.630
<v 4>I,
I remember thinking to myself,
well,
I don't really like the photograph,
uh,</v>

1029
01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:27.430
but I'm going to try putting this quote above it that she said,

1030
01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:33.120
and I posted onto Facebook and suddenly it was the most engaged with photo that

1031
01:05:35.951 --> 01:05:40.210
I'd ever posted.
Uh,
I think we're talking like 67 likes at this time.

1032
01:05:40.211 --> 01:05:44.050
There was not a lot of people following my page.
Um,

1033
01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:46.540
and it really,

1034
01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:51.810
it was kind of a Eureka moment because it really made sense that,

1035
01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:54.820
you know,
and this,

1036
01:05:55.720 --> 01:06:00.720
during these months and almost a year of doing nothing but approaching random

1037
01:06:02.171 --> 01:06:06.640
people on the street and asking for their photograph.
Uh,

1038
01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:11.880
the thing that strangely I had gotten to be an expert at wasn't the photography,

1039
01:06:15.550 --> 01:06:19.770
but it was the approaching strangers and the,

1040
01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:23.240
the walking up to random people,
uh,

1041
01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:27.670
getting rejected a lot of times and not letting that affect my,
my mood.

1042
01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:32.800
Uh,
and then once meeting somebody,
you know,
in a very short amount of time,

1043
01:06:32.801 --> 01:06:37.801
making that person comfortable and kind of the Eureka moment was if that is what

1044
01:06:42.701 --> 01:06:46.360
I've become good at,
if that is what I have to offer the world,

1045
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:49.180
shouldn't I,

1046
01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:53.230
now that I've gotten over this fear of approaching a stranger,

1047
01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:58.860
use that opportunity to learn a little bit about this person so that I can share

1048
01:07:01.211 --> 01:07:05.980
a little bit about this person with other people who might be curious of the

1049
01:07:05.981 --> 01:07:10.981
people around them but haven't been able to overcome that fear of talking to

1050
01:07:11.081 --> 01:07:14.200
strangers.
And you know,

1051
01:07:14.201 --> 01:07:19.030
it turned out that the audience for that,
the,

1052
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:22.810
the amount of people who were curious with the lives of the people around them

1053
01:07:22.811 --> 01:07:27.490
but were too afraid to ask,
uh,
you know,
ended up being hundreds,

1054
01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:31.960
then thousands and then tens of thousands and millions.

1055
01:07:31.961 --> 01:07:35.680
And then now tens of millions.
And you know,

1056
01:07:35.681 --> 01:07:37.510
from that moment on,

1057
01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:41.460
humans of New York stops being a photography project.
Uh,

1058
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:45.820
I don't even view myself as a photographer.
You know,
you can,

1059
01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:51.270
you can write a three page essay about why I'm a horrible photographer and it's

1060
01:07:52.991 --> 01:07:55.640
been done many times.
Uh,

1061
01:07:56.350 --> 01:08:01.000
and it doesn't really bother me because I stopped viewing myself as a

1062
01:08:01.001 --> 01:08:03.400
photographer a long time ago.
Uh,

1063
01:08:03.401 --> 01:08:07.430
the photography's really secondary to humans of New York.
You know,

1064
01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:12.540
humans of New York is my effort in a short of time as possible to make a person

1065
01:08:15.801 --> 01:08:20.801
on the street comfortable enough and seeing that it seemed like somebody's

1066
01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:28.540
interested enough in their lives that they'll share their story with me and

1067
01:08:28.941 --> 01:08:33.500
they'll share something deep and vulnerable and real and honest about their

1068
01:08:33.501 --> 01:08:38.501
lives so that I can share that with millions of people every single night.

1069
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.580
Uh,

1070
01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:45.580
and humans of New York over the past six years has been my effort to get as good

1071
01:08:47.151 --> 01:08:48.530
at that as possible.

1072
01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:51.401
<v 5>This,</v>

1073
01:08:51.401 --> 01:08:56.230
this is a perfect segue to asking about the approaches and questions,

1074
01:08:56.290 --> 01:08:57.190
which is

1075
01:08:57.610 --> 01:09:00.100
<v 6>Richards is a really important thing.
I've spent the entire,</v>

1076
01:09:00.101 --> 01:09:03.190
I feel guilty cause I spent the entire,
if you look,

1077
01:09:03.610 --> 01:09:08.610
I have not posted a picture of myself on humans of New York in years.

1078
01:09:09.010 --> 01:09:11.880
Uh,
I don't,
I don't do it.
Uh,

1079
01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:17.040
I find I find that humans of New York is best when I'm the most invisible.

1080
01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.650
Uh,
I feel that the,

1081
01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.770
the less humans of New York is about Brandon Stanton,

1082
01:09:24.490 --> 01:09:28.900
the more influential humans of New York has become.
Um,

1083
01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:30.650
so yeah,
it's,
uh,

1084
01:09:32.110 --> 01:09:37.110
it feels very unnatural to have spent an hour talking already and talk nothing

1085
01:09:38.351 --> 01:09:42.760
about myself.
So please
fire away,

1086
01:09:42.761 --> 01:09:43.870
ask about the work.

1087
01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:46.500
<v 5>So I'm going to ask about the work and you can,
uh,</v>

1088
01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:49.790
you can talk about yourself in third person if it makes it feel better,

1089
01:09:49.791 --> 01:09:53.880
but I will have to,
I will have to involve you in this,
uh,

1090
01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:59.600
when,
what do you say when you cold approach someone on the street?

1091
01:09:59.810 --> 01:10:00.470
Uh,

1092
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:05.470
assuming that now of course you could use humans of New York and a lot of people

1093
01:10:05.541 --> 01:10:07.580
would recognize it and you could break the ice that way,

1094
01:10:07.581 --> 01:10:12.260
but it early on when nobody would recognize that.
How,

1095
01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.130
how did you,

1096
01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:18.130
how did you open and then w what did you use to break the ice and the first 60

1097
01:10:18.531 --> 01:10:19.364
seconds,

1098
01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:23.680
<v 6>uh,
first thing always is,
do you mind if I take your photograph?</v>

1099
01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:26.230
Um,
that was the first thing.
And I mean,

1100
01:10:26.231 --> 01:10:30.910
these are all little things I learned is you don't walk up to somebody and ask,

1101
01:10:30.911 --> 01:10:32.620
do you have a minute?
Do you know?

1102
01:10:32.621 --> 01:10:36.010
Because that immediately puts somebody on defensive because in,

1103
01:10:36.011 --> 01:10:37.450
especially in New York City,

1104
01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:41.260
so people were walking up to you all day long trying to sell you something,

1105
01:10:41.261 --> 01:10:45.700
asking for money.
So people are naturally very defensive.
Um,

1106
01:10:45.730 --> 01:10:50.560
so I don't want my,
my goal is to get into it as soon as possible too.

1107
01:10:50.590 --> 01:10:54.130
So people realize that this is something a little bit different and I'm not

1108
01:10:54.131 --> 01:10:57.510
looking to for their money.
That's the main thing.
You know,

1109
01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:01.180
I'm not looking for their money.
Um,
so I normally walk up and I say,
uh,

1110
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:03.370
do you mind if I take your photograph?
Um,

1111
01:11:03.371 --> 01:11:08.371
I run a website called humans of New York and basically what I do is over the

1112
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.471
past several years,

1113
01:11:08.471 --> 01:11:12.370
I photographed about 10,000 people on the streets of New York City and around

1114
01:11:12.371 --> 01:11:16.380
the world.
And I just learned a little bit about everyone I photograph.

1115
01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:20.400
Um,
and so I was just wondering if I could take your photo and ask you a few

1116
01:11:20.401 --> 01:11:21.480
questions.
Okay.

1117
01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:25.800
<v 4>Now before you had the 10,000 and went around the world when it was maybe the</v>

1118
01:11:25.801 --> 01:11:29.780
hundredth person or 200th person,
was it the same pitch minus that stuff?

1119
01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:34.360
<v 6>I was trying to give you actually the pitch that I used to give in the early</v>

1120
01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:37.180
days.
Now I pull out my cell phone to number one,

1121
01:11:37.181 --> 01:11:41.950
New York Times bestselling books.
Um,
you know,
20 million followers on Facebook.

1122
01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:43.390
And the whole reason of that,

1123
01:11:43.391 --> 01:11:46.360
even though it kind of sounds like boastful and braggy,

1124
01:11:46.361 --> 01:11:50.440
is that especially if somebody hasn't heard of humans of New York,
you know,

1125
01:11:50.441 --> 01:11:55.090
I want to convince them in as short amount of time as possible.

1126
01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:59.620
Um,
that is,
it's something real.
One that's important.
Um,

1127
01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:01.630
and that it's something that,
you know,

1128
01:12:01.631 --> 01:12:05.500
is a lot of people know about and a lot of people follow.
It's not a joke.

1129
01:12:05.501 --> 01:12:08.920
It's not a prank.
You're not going to be embarrassed.
You're not gonna,
you know,

1130
01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:13.120
my goal is in as short amount of time as possible to kind of,
you know,

1131
01:12:13.121 --> 01:12:15.520
make the person feel comfortable.
And these days,

1132
01:12:15.521 --> 01:12:19.870
a big part of that is kind of explaining how big the block is because then it's,

1133
01:12:19.871 --> 01:12:22.450
then it's like,
oh,
this person is not trying to hustle me.

1134
01:12:22.450 --> 01:12:27.370
This person isn't trying to scam me.
Um,
but you know,
to be honest,

1135
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:30.760
you know,
in the early days,
my success,
you know,

1136
01:12:30.761 --> 01:12:34.870
the amount of people who let me take their photo wasn't that much less.
Um,

1137
01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:39.220
except back then,
I wasn't a best selling author.
I was just a kid.

1138
01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:42.990
Um,
you know,
who was,
you know,

1139
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.050
trying to make an art project and,
and you know,
people wanted to help.

1140
01:12:47.290 --> 01:12:51.730
And so,
you know,
the,
I think a lot of people think that,
you know,

1141
01:12:51.731 --> 01:12:55.480
one of the reasons so many people are willing to talk to me is because humans of

1142
01:12:55.481 --> 01:13:00.220
New York is so well known,
especially in New York now.
Uh,
but,

1143
01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:03.430
you know,
I,
the,
my,
uh,

1144
01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:07.420
my rate of people who would talk to me was not all that different when I was

1145
01:13:07.421 --> 01:13:08.410
just getting started.

1146
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:13.020
<v 4>Are there any other nonverbal cues to that?
I mean,</v>

1147
01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:17.500
there's tons of them and,
but I mean,
again,
these aren't things that I like,
Aye.
I,

1148
01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:22.530
these aren't things that,
you know,
I planned or read about.

1149
01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:26.280
You know,
it's not that I get a lot of trial and error.
Well,
they were,

1150
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:30.750
they were burned into me by being rejected so much.
And,
you know,

1151
01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:33.900
some rejections on the streets of New York aren't always polite.

1152
01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:38.580
You know what I mean?
It was hard,
you know,
in the early days.
I mean,

1153
01:13:38.581 --> 01:13:42.600
I remembered there were days,
I mean,
the hardest part about it was,
I mean,

1154
01:13:42.601 --> 01:13:46.380
especially when I got started in humans of New York,

1155
01:13:46.381 --> 01:13:49.770
didn't have any fans and it wasn't book.
It's,
you know,

1156
01:13:49.771 --> 01:13:52.440
it wasn't made into any books.
And me know,

1157
01:13:52.441 --> 01:13:55.860
my family didn't believe in it and my friends thought I was crazy.

1158
01:13:55.861 --> 01:14:00.210
I had no photography experience.
I'm in New York City,
you know,

1159
01:14:00.450 --> 01:14:05.450
stopping random people and asking them questions and I'm feeling insecure.

1160
01:14:05.611 --> 01:14:06.660
And you know,
I,

1161
01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:12.080
when you walk up to somebody and you ask them if they can your photo and they

1162
01:14:13.271 --> 01:14:17.260
respond like you're some sort of freak or that you're weird,

1163
01:14:17.890 --> 01:14:18.640
you know,
it's,

1164
01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:23.170
it's hard to not internalize that because you're so insecure at the moment
about,

1165
01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.960
you know,
whether or not what you're doing is weird.

1166
01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:31.090
And if it's something that,
that,
you know,
it am I,

1167
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:34.780
am I weird,
you know,
for,
for asking these people for their,

1168
01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.910
for their photographs and you know,

1169
01:14:36.911 --> 01:14:41.911
I go out some days and 10 people in a row would make me feel like I'm some sort

1170
01:14:43.031 --> 01:14:45.580
of freak.
Like,
do you know what city you're in?

1171
01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:48.960
You can't be stopped and rid of people,
like,
get out of my way,
like,
get what you,

1172
01:14:48.970 --> 01:14:52.690
what are you doing?
Like,
no,
you can't take my photo,
like,
get Outta here.

1173
01:14:52.691 --> 01:14:53.524
You know what I mean?

1174
01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:58.690
And like during my formative and like impressionable,

1175
01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:03.400
you know,
early days when I'm trying to figure this out,
you know,

1176
01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:08.670
five reactions like that in a row when nobody's paying attention to your work

1177
01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:14.230
and you've been trying for months and you can't figure it out.
I mean,

1178
01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:17.020
psychologically it was very tough.
And you know,

1179
01:15:17.021 --> 01:15:18.790
there'd be days where that would happen.

1180
01:15:18.791 --> 01:15:22.540
I would just kind of do it anymore and I would just go home and,
and,
you know,

1181
01:15:22.541 --> 01:15:24.640
lay in bed.
Uh,

1182
01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:33.670
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Oh,
well,
I mean,
it's just like the,

1183
01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:38.810
that was,
that's the hardest part about doing it.
Uh,
what,

1184
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:41.500
what did you,
what did you say?
I mean,

1185
01:15:41.501 --> 01:15:45.550
what would you say to yourself during a period like that?
I mean,
it sounds so,

1186
01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:51.420
to me at least,
I mean the picture that is painting,
having,
uh,

1187
01:15:51.490 --> 01:15:55.810
experienced some dark periods in my life had been maybe catalyzed by various

1188
01:15:55.811 --> 01:16:00.460
things.
It sounds really soul crushing.
I mean,
that sounds really,
oh,
it's just,

1189
01:16:00.730 --> 01:16:04.750
that was all,
you know,
like that was all,

1190
01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:08.400
it was all like,
you know,

1191
01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:12.400
all of the doubt and you know,

1192
01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:16.470
all those and not having any money,
you know,

1193
01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:19.410
nobody's paying attention and it,

1194
01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:24.420
I'm just doing this all day long for months and you know,

1195
01:16:24.881 --> 01:16:29.440
like all the tough shit was,
uh,

1196
01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:33.400
and like the loneliness too.
Like I didn't know anybody in New York.

1197
01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:37.960
Like there was like,

1198
01:16:38.230 --> 01:16:42.070
I knew like two people and cars and you know,

1199
01:16:42.071 --> 01:16:45.490
like there was a Christmas break where those two people went home.

1200
01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:50.780
And like for two weeks I didn't see anybody that I knew.
Uh,

1201
01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:55.180
Jesus.
Yeah.
And you know,
I remember,
I,

1202
01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:00.700
you know,
was I spent Christmas Eve alone and diner.

1203
01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:04.810
Um,
and then I just went out and photographed,
you know,

1204
01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:10.100
cause it was just like the only thing,
it was the thing

1205
01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:15.760
<v 6>that could like that would keep me from like thinking about how unlikely it was</v>

1206
01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:21.410
and you know,
whether,
how,

1207
01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:23.930
how stupid of an idea it might be.

1208
01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:30.950
Like the only thing that,
that I think,
you know,

1209
01:17:30.951 --> 01:17:34.280
kept me from thinking about the possibility of failing was doing,

1210
01:17:34.281 --> 01:17:36.200
it was just photographing.

1211
01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:40.790
And so like whenever I started to to think,
is this gonna work?

1212
01:17:40.791 --> 01:17:45.550
Is it not going to work?
Uh,
I just go out and photograph.
You know,
I,
I,

1213
01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:50.560
that was my only way of like keeping those wolves away of,

1214
01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:55.700
you know,
is this ultimately going to be a success?

1215
01:17:57.590 --> 01:18:02.480
Am I wasting my time?
And in my,
in my,
my stupid like a,

1216
01:18:02.481 --> 01:18:07.481
the only way to keep those away was to go out and work and you know,

1217
01:18:08.451 --> 01:18:12.140
and so that's what I would do just all day long and do it and do it and do it.

1218
01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:17.150
And so like these negative things,
like the rejection of people and you know,

1219
01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:21.560
people saying no.
Then I was talking about like all of the negative stuff.

1220
01:18:22.170 --> 01:18:27.170
Like the thing that was like counteracting that all the time was just loving it

1221
01:18:28.221 --> 01:18:33.140
so much.
You know,
I just,
I just,
I just loved it so much.

1222
01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:38.480
Uh,
and
so yeah,
you know,
it's like,

1223
01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:43.010
it was just kind of this,
this is the same way I was obsessed with markets.

1224
01:18:43.011 --> 01:18:46.880
You know,
I was obsessed with taking photos.
Uh,

1225
01:18:46.881 --> 01:18:49.700
and so that's kind of what carried me through at all.

1226
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:55.590
<v 5>I mean,
listening to this story,
it makes me want to ask you,</v>

1227
01:18:55.740 --> 01:19:00.740
when I look at humans of New York and think about how many thousands of people

1228
01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:06.440
you've humanized and how much empathy you've created traveling to other

1229
01:19:06.571 --> 01:19:07.410
countries,

1230
01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:12.440
helping to paint a more complete picture of humanity instead of allowing sort of

1231
01:19:14.041 --> 01:19:19.041
mass media distortion to create us versus them mentality or counteracting that

1232
01:19:19.981 --> 01:19:24.981
at least to a very real degree in helping millions of people who have been

1233
01:19:26.311 --> 01:19:30.990
exposed to your work and the interviews to feel less alone.
I mean,
are you,

1234
01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:34.170
that's a huge fucking deal.
And I,
I,
it just,

1235
01:19:34.171 --> 01:19:38.670
it pains me to hear a story like this,

1236
01:19:38.671 --> 01:19:43.290
but it's so helpful for you to share it because I wonder how many people have

1237
01:19:43.291 --> 01:19:47.370
ended up like in that diner alone and just quit.
Right?

1238
01:19:47.371 --> 01:19:49.150
They just stop.

1239
01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:53.910
<v 6>I mean,
well,
I mean it's not even,
it's not even about stopping,
you know,</v>

1240
01:19:53.911 --> 01:19:58.170
it's just like,
I think humans of New York work,

1241
01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:02.220
it's not about like goals are like mission or,
you know,

1242
01:20:02.221 --> 01:20:06.990
I had a goal and I had a mission,
but people just feel alone,
period.
You know?

1243
01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.190
I mean it's like that's,

1244
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.980
<v 4>that's why humans of New York as I succeeded,</v>

1245
01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:14.850
and I'm not even talking about the people reading it.
I mean,

1246
01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:19.830
the number one question that people ask me is how do you get people to share

1247
01:20:19.831 --> 01:20:24.210
with you?
And you know,
I think,
you know,

1248
01:20:24.211 --> 01:20:28.140
for,
for most people,
they're not just,

1249
01:20:28.141 --> 01:20:32.640
if you follow humans of New York,
you know,
like I was yesterday,

1250
01:20:32.641 --> 01:20:36.630
I was talking with a woman who,
I mean,

1251
01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:40.830
she had not heard of humans of New York.
This is a perfect example.
You know,
I,

1252
01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:44.700
I,
she was catching a train.
She had 30 minutes.

1253
01:20:44.730 --> 01:20:46.680
She had never heard of humans of New York.

1254
01:20:47.130 --> 01:20:52.130
We start out with me kind of showing her the blog and 30 minutes later the

1255
01:20:52.651 --> 01:20:56.280
police that we ended up at was,

1256
01:20:56.430 --> 01:21:01.430
she was in this purgatory where her husband was depressed and an alcoholic and

1257
01:21:09.210 --> 01:21:14.210
he wasn't doing anything that was ultimately so bad.

1258
01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:17.010
He didn't beat her,
he didn't cheat on her,

1259
01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:20.040
but she wasn't getting fulfilled.

1260
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:24.810
And she was wondering if she was living her best life by staying with him for

1261
01:21:24.811 --> 01:21:25.644
the kids.

1262
01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:30.270
And she came to this place where she admitted that she was kind of secretly

1263
01:21:30.271 --> 01:21:35.271
hoping that he would do something bad to make the decision easier on her and

1264
01:21:37.081 --> 01:21:42.081
like that sort of like honesty and that sort of truth and that sort of rawness.

1265
01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:43.200
I mean,

1266
01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:48.200
I don't know if she even admitted that to herself before and you know,

1267
01:21:48.211 --> 01:21:51.390
people ask me and that happens all the time,
Tim,

1268
01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:55.500
like that's good humans of New York.
I mean,
some of it's just,
you know,

1269
01:21:55.501 --> 01:22:00.300
pictures of kids say and cute stuff and some of it's cute couples,
you know,

1270
01:22:00.301 --> 01:22:05.190
talking about their relationship.
But you know,
good,
good humans of New York is,

1271
01:22:05.250 --> 01:22:07.290
is when we get to that moment,
you know,

1272
01:22:07.291 --> 01:22:10.980
when me and somebody or thinking through something or talking through something

1273
01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:12.420
that they might not have,

1274
01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:16.530
have thought through before and you know,

1275
01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:20.670
the way people say,
how do you get there with a complete stranger?
You know,

1276
01:22:20.671 --> 01:22:25.230
I think that whenever I'm talking to somebody on the street,

1277
01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:30.980
there are two threads running through their head at any given time.

1278
01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:36.870
And one of them is this kind of fear of being exposed,

1279
01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:41.700
this feeling of,
of being vulnerable and discomfort.
Who is this guy?
Like,

1280
01:22:41.701 --> 01:22:44.430
why is he asking me these questions?

1281
01:22:45.630 --> 01:22:50.630
And on the other hand there this appreciation of being heard that even though I

1282
01:22:52.561 --> 01:22:54.000
don't know this guy,

1283
01:22:54.810 --> 01:22:59.810
this is the first person who has taken such a,

1284
01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:05.450
a focused and detailed interest in my problems and,

1285
01:23:06.330 --> 01:23:10.210
and,
and of the feeling of having somebody focused.

1286
01:23:10.211 --> 01:23:15.211
So an intensely not on the sports teams you like or the music you like or any of

1287
01:23:15.761 --> 01:23:19.430
the other kind of trivial things that we,
we,
we get,

1288
01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:23.620
we get asked it on it on a daily basis.
But you know,
these,

1289
01:23:23.621 --> 01:23:27.490
these real things that you're struggling with and maybe not even on the top of

1290
01:23:27.491 --> 01:23:28.061
your mind,

1291
01:23:28.061 --> 01:23:31.120
but like at the back of your mind that you're not even really bringing to the

1292
01:23:31.121 --> 01:23:33.010
surface.
You know,

1293
01:23:34.030 --> 01:23:39.030
being heard like that is such a validating thing that that's why people always

1294
01:23:43.991 --> 01:23:45.500
share and,

1295
01:23:45.501 --> 01:23:49.840
and I tell people at the beginning of every interview that these questions are

1296
01:23:49.841 --> 01:23:54.400
going to be hard and anything you don't want to answer,
you don't have to answer.

1297
01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:58.120
And we talk about when they got molested as a child,

1298
01:23:59.110 --> 01:24:03.570
we talk about them cheating on their husbands.
We talk about their alcoholism.
We,

1299
01:24:03.630 --> 01:24:07.660
we talk about how they don't love their child as much as they expected they

1300
01:24:07.661 --> 01:24:09.310
would.
You know,

1301
01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:14.410
we talk about all these things and almost never do.
People say,

1302
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:17.740
I don't want to talk about that.
I don't want to talk about that.

1303
01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:23.760
And I think the reason humans of New York works isn't because the people who are

1304
01:24:24.671 --> 01:24:29.410
reading it feel alone.
That's a big part of it is that people,

1305
01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:33.970
when they see somebody being vulnerable in a way that they're afraid to be

1306
01:24:33.971 --> 01:24:36.520
vulnerable themselves,
they connect with that person.

1307
01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:42.960
But it really works because the people on the street that I meet are so thankful

1308
01:24:44.531 --> 01:24:46.720
to have somebody really listened to them

1309
01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:52.570
that in that bubble and an hour and a half where I'm sitting with a stranger on

1310
01:24:52.571 --> 01:24:53.200
the street,

1311
01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:58.200
this magic happens where they're willing to kind of let me into a space in their

1312
01:24:58.721 --> 01:25:03.490
mind or their soul or whatever it is that they don't really let other people

1313
01:25:03.491 --> 01:25:06.170
into.
And it's,

1314
01:25:06.250 --> 01:25:09.010
it's that place that I think connects with so many people.

1315
01:25:09.130 --> 01:25:14.130
<v 5>That's an incredible gift slash talent that you've developed that allows you to</v>

1316
01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:22.920
make people comfortable enough to open up to that extent in 30 minutes.

1317
01:25:23.531 --> 01:25:27.550
I mean,
that is incredibly impressive to me.
Uh,

1318
01:25:27.551 --> 01:25:32.551
even given the fact that perhaps one of the elements underpinning it is how,

1319
01:25:34.090 --> 01:25:38.290
how heard they feel,
which is absolutely,
I'm sure the case.

1320
01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:43.600
Uh,
I think about questions a lot and you have much more experience than I do and

1321
01:25:43.601 --> 01:25:47.590
that just blows me away that you're able to get there in such a short period of

1322
01:25:47.591 --> 01:25:47.861
time.

1323
01:25:47.861 --> 01:25:52.861
What are some of the other ingredients or aspects of it that help you to

1324
01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:54.430
questions perhaps that help?

1325
01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:55.400
<v 4>It's,</v>

1326
01:25:55.400 --> 01:26:00.400
it's not the questions I have about three or four entry questions that I use.

1327
01:26:00.891 --> 01:26:02.060
What's your biggest struggle?

1328
01:26:02.810 --> 01:26:05.630
How your life turned out differently than you expected it to.

1329
01:26:06.410 --> 01:26:08.030
What do you feel most guilty about?

1330
01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:13.340
But really the planned questions are just kind of springboards into a

1331
01:26:13.341 --> 01:26:14.270
conversation.

1332
01:26:15.050 --> 01:26:20.050
And you know where how you get to that deep place with a person is absolute

1333
01:26:22.071 --> 01:26:25.970
presence.
It's being 100% there.

1334
01:26:26.630 --> 01:26:29.390
You're not thinking in the framework of an interview.

1335
01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:31.880
You're not looking at a list of questions.

1336
01:26:31.881 --> 01:26:33.950
You're not thinking about your next question.

1337
01:26:33.951 --> 01:26:37.400
You're not thinking about how this person fits into your idea of them and what

1338
01:26:37.401 --> 01:26:38.450
you know about them.

1339
01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:44.320
You're 100% there and you're 100% listening to them and your questions are 100%

1340
01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:53.560
coming based on curiosity about what they are telling you and nothing else.

1341
01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:01.240
And you know why it is that I think humans of New York is special and I think

1342
01:27:02.631 --> 01:27:06.030
humans of New York is,
is something that you know,
is,

1343
01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:10.790
is precious and may be difficult to replicate is that,
you know,

1344
01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:16.120
I've spent seven years in these conversations with 10,000 people and it's not

1345
01:27:19.221 --> 01:27:24.221
necessarily that I have gotten so good at asking questions,

1346
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:31.870
it's just that I've gotten so comfortable in the presence of a stranger and so

1347
01:27:32.421 --> 01:27:37.421
comfortable in the presence of somebody that I've just met that I can sit there

1348
01:27:37.521 --> 01:27:42.521
with them without an ounce of self consciousness and just be,

1349
01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:47.150
and just be there with it and listened to them and be curious about them.

1350
01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:52.720
And there's this energy that happens there that this doesn't feel like somebody

1351
01:27:53.781 --> 01:27:55.070
that's interviewing you.

1352
01:27:55.071 --> 01:28:00.071
It feels like somebody who knows you and cares about you is really interested in

1353
01:28:01.821 --> 01:28:06.160
what's going on in your life.
And I,
and it's,

1354
01:28:06.161 --> 01:28:08.580
it's very subtle and hard to describe,

1355
01:28:08.581 --> 01:28:12.890
but I think it's that energy and that presence in that being there and it's

1356
01:28:12.891 --> 01:28:17.270
something I had to earn.
It's the same thing like public speaking,
you know?

1357
01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:20.390
I mean,
when do you really get good at public speaking?

1358
01:28:20.630 --> 01:28:25.630
It's when you've done it so much that you can be yourself on the stage yet and

1359
01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:30.410
there's only one way to get there and that's to be on stage,

1360
01:28:30.411 --> 01:28:35.090
scare to shit over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.

1361
01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:40.550
And I think the only way to get to that place where you can have that rapport

1362
01:28:40.551 --> 01:28:45.110
with a stranger is not by studying interview techniques.

1363
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:49.400
It's by sitting with thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of

1364
01:28:49.401 --> 01:28:53.300
strangers until nothing feels strange about it anymore.

1365
01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:57.950
And you're able to be in that calm,
present place.

1366
01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:02.010
And what happens is your energy transfers the other person

1367
01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:04.840
<v 6>and they get to that place too.</v>

1368
01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:10.010
<v 5>If we were to pick up the example that you gave just a few minutes ago about</v>

1369
01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:14.300
this woman talking about her relationship with her husband and his depression

1370
01:29:14.301 --> 01:29:18.290
and alcoholism and so on.
How did you,
if,
if you remember,

1371
01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:22.550
how did you end up there in,
in other words,

1372
01:29:22.551 --> 01:29:27.551
do you recall how the conversation headed to that point?

1373
01:29:28.071 --> 01:29:28.650
Yeah,

1374
01:29:28.650 --> 01:29:33.420
<v 6>I mean it can,
uh,
well let me give you another example since I already,</v>

1375
01:29:33.421 --> 01:29:34.254
uh,

1376
01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:38.250
let me give me an example of somebody I talked to in the Philippines a few weeks

1377
01:29:38.250 --> 01:29:40.560
ago.
Same thing.
I've traveled to 30 different countries now.

1378
01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:44.520
I've done the exact same work.
I've been to Pakistan,
I've been to Iran,

1379
01:29:44.730 --> 01:29:47.010
I've been to Iraq,
uh,

1380
01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:50.940
and I work with interpreters and the process is exactly the same.

1381
01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:54.030
I just walk up to people,
random people,

1382
01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:56.220
and getting into these conversations with them.

1383
01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:02.180
There was a woman in a park in the Philippines and I started asking her,

1384
01:30:03.391 --> 01:30:05.760
I think one of the first questions I asked her was,

1385
01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:08.490
what is your biggest goal in life?

1386
01:30:09.150 --> 01:30:13.980
And she said she wanted to have a good family life.

1387
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.010
And so I thought that that was the story.

1388
01:30:17.011 --> 01:30:21.690
And I started asking about that and I learned that she wanted to have a good

1389
01:30:21.691 --> 01:30:25.110
family life because when she was young,

1390
01:30:25.111 --> 01:30:30.111
her family split and she was forced to go to the courthouse with her mom and her

1391
01:30:31.021 --> 01:30:32.790
dad at the age of nine.

1392
01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:38.360
And the judge made her choose which parents she wanted to go with.

1393
01:30:39.770 --> 01:30:40.240
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1394
01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:42.070
<v 6>And so I thought that was the story.</v>

1395
01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:45.070
And so I started asking questions about that.

1396
01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:51.360
And then I learned that she ended up going with her mom and afterwards she,

1397
01:30:52.810 --> 01:30:56.610
her mom remarried and she didn't like her new stepfather.

1398
01:30:56.620 --> 01:31:00.730
So she ran away.
And I thought that that was the story.

1399
01:31:01.450 --> 01:31:03.820
So I started asking questions about that.

1400
01:31:05.230 --> 01:31:09.250
And then I found out that the reason she ran away was because her step father

1401
01:31:09.251 --> 01:31:14.170
was abusing her and that she had never told a person in her life,

1402
01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:19.060
including her mom until that moment that that had happened.

1403
01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:24.840
And that's how we end up in those places is I just,

1404
01:31:25.050 --> 01:31:29.240
I am just curious about what's going on in there.
You know,

1405
01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:31.300
I'm just curious about what happened.
I,

1406
01:31:31.301 --> 01:31:35.490
I want to know the story and I just ask and I asked,
can I ask?

1407
01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:39.900
And if something's not quite making sense,
I want to know why.

1408
01:31:40.650 --> 01:31:44.370
And so I ask more and I ask boring.
And it's,

1409
01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:46.140
it's like you can't,
I mean,

1410
01:31:46.141 --> 01:31:51.141
somebody can choose to eventually to not tell the truth by saying I'm

1411
01:31:52.741 --> 01:31:53.850
uncomfortable with it,

1412
01:31:55.050 --> 01:31:59.890
but it can't really be concealed if somebody is really,
really,

1413
01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:04.870
really,
really curious,
you know what I mean?
Why he can never,
you know,

1414
01:32:04.890 --> 01:32:09.130
get to the point like it's humans of New York interviews don't work.

1415
01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:12.910
I always say it's not because somebody doesn't have an interesting story.

1416
01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:17.470
Humans of New York interviews don't work.
When I reached a place,

1417
01:32:17.471 --> 01:32:22.300
when somebody's uncomfortable with the process,
which is absolutely fine,
there's,

1418
01:32:22.301 --> 01:32:25.840
that's completely understandable.
I'm a random person.

1419
01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:29.110
I'm sharing these stories with 20 million people.

1420
01:32:29.530 --> 01:32:33.940
It's 100% fine if you don't want to share.
Like that's not,

1421
01:32:34.330 --> 01:32:37.840
that is,
that is nothing against you at all.

1422
01:32:38.650 --> 01:32:41.920
But those are the interviews that don't make it on the blog.

1423
01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:43.990
It's not that people aren't interesting.

1424
01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:49.360
It's that humans of New York really kind of thrives on this kind of honesty.

1425
01:32:49.810 --> 01:32:52.180
And if somebody is willing to be honest,

1426
01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:57.460
I mean everybody's got an interesting story and so it's like the,

1427
01:32:57.550 --> 01:33:00.460
I hit dead ends not because somebody is boring,

1428
01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:05.590
it's because somebody isn't comfortable with disclosing.

1429
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:10.900
Um,
and so that's,
that's kind of what defines,
you know,
the,

1430
01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:14.500
the humans of New York interview or what is usable,

1431
01:33:14.501 --> 01:33:15.730
the humans of New York interview.

1432
01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:18.790
<v 5>How often when people disclose,</v>

1433
01:33:18.850 --> 01:33:23.850
when they do go there and disclose these very vulnerable stories or things

1434
01:33:25.511 --> 01:33:26.920
they've never told anyone else,

1435
01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:32.080
how often do they ask that you not use it or that they are or express concern

1436
01:33:32.081 --> 01:33:35.860
that it's going to cause some type of problem for them?
Well,

1437
01:33:35.890 --> 01:33:40.360
<v 6>that's,
that's one thing that I am very principled about.</v>

1438
01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:41.140
Um,

1439
01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:45.610
I give the person agency every step of the way.

1440
01:33:46.330 --> 01:33:49.180
I tell them anything you don't want to ask.
First of all,

1441
01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:52.810
they don't have to talk to me.
Okay.
They have that decision.

1442
01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:56.800
Once we start talking,
I say,
any question you don't want to answer,

1443
01:33:57.190 --> 01:33:58.300
you don't have to answer.

1444
01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:03.010
If you tell me something during the course of this interview and you change your

1445
01:34:03.011 --> 01:34:05.950
mind afterwards,
it don't want me to share it.
That's fine.

1446
01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:08.470
At the end of the interview,

1447
01:34:08.471 --> 01:34:13.300
if you would like me to photograph your hands or your feet instead of your face,

1448
01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:17.020
we can do that.
In fact,
if it's a very vulnerable story,

1449
01:34:17.021 --> 01:34:20.980
I will normally insist on that to protect the person or protect somebody that

1450
01:34:20.981 --> 01:34:21.910
they're talking about.

1451
01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:27.730
If after I've done the interview and before it's posted at anytime you change

1452
01:34:27.731 --> 01:34:29.350
your mind and you don't want me to share it,

1453
01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:34.740
I give them my email address and after the photo is up for any reason,

1454
01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:36.220
at any time,

1455
01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:39.580
if you become uncomfortable from all the attention and would like me to take the

1456
01:34:39.581 --> 01:34:41.500
story down,
I immediately will.

1457
01:34:42.490 --> 01:34:47.410
And so people have control of it every step of the way.

1458
01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:48.400
Uh,

1459
01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:53.400
it's very important to me that nobody ever sees humans of New York as something

1460
01:34:55.781 --> 01:34:57.130
that was done to them.

1461
01:34:58.310 --> 01:35:03.310
I always want it to be seen as something that was done with them and you know,

1462
01:35:03.471 --> 01:35:08.120
have I failed at that?
Sometimes out of the 10,000 people have I interviewed,

1463
01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:12.470
you don't have there been people who were,

1464
01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:16.880
didn't expect me to share a certain part of their story or were surprised by it

1465
01:35:16.881 --> 01:35:20.540
or it was a negative experience for,
there have been a handful,

1466
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:24.200
you know,
but I can only say that those are the,

1467
01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:28.920
those are the worst moments for me.
Uh,

1468
01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:32.780
when humans of New York was a negative experience for somebody,

1469
01:35:32.781 --> 01:35:36.440
cause that's who I really care about is,
is the people that,
that are on the blog,

1470
01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:40.920
you know,
that because I mean they're,
they're the people who kind of,

1471
01:35:40.921 --> 01:35:42.980
I had that moment with,
you know,

1472
01:35:42.981 --> 01:35:46.100
I spent an hour and a half with them and we,

1473
01:35:46.130 --> 01:35:49.400
and we got to that place and you know,

1474
01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:53.420
I just,
if they are hurt by it,

1475
01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:56.510
you know what I mean?
Um,
or if it's like,
if,

1476
01:35:56.511 --> 01:35:59.060
especially if they were really kind of vulnerable,
then that's,

1477
01:35:59.090 --> 01:36:02.300
that's when I feel the worst about myself.
Uh,

1478
01:36:02.301 --> 01:36:06.650
because I know how much pressure that spotlight can be.
And I know,

1479
01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:11.180
you know,
how,
how difficult it can be.
You know,
under,
you know,

1480
01:36:11.181 --> 01:36:15.030
having 20 million people look at you.
And so,
you know,
if,
if I,

1481
01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:19.670
if I ever feel that,
like I maybe accidentally misrepresented it or,
or,

1482
01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:24.440
you know,
or,
or that,
that's,
that's when I feel the worst.

1483
01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:27.500
How do you think about

1484
01:36:28.170 --> 01:36:32.320
<v 5>money as it relates to humans of New York?
Uh,</v>

1485
01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:36.960
ostensibly you want to probably eat more than peanut butter and jelly sandwiches

1486
01:36:36.961 --> 01:36:40.600
and eggs now at the same,
yeah.
Yeah.
Go ahead.

1487
01:36:40.601 --> 01:36:45.480
And I'm just going to say in terms of what you do with advertising or

1488
01:36:45.481 --> 01:36:50.460
partnerships or projects,
because you have such also such sensitive,

1489
01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:51.750
not,
not always,
but

1490
01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:58.280
you have such potentially sensitive subject matter and it's so personalized for

1491
01:36:59.461 --> 01:37:02.490
these folks or any cases.
How do you,
how do you think about that?

1492
01:37:02.770 --> 01:37:07.150
<v 6>Right.
Um,
well the,
you know,
right now,
obviously,</v>

1493
01:37:07.151 --> 01:37:12.010
so humans of New York,
I think we sold a million and a half books.

1494
01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:15.760
Um,
the,
you know,
the,

1495
01:37:15.790 --> 01:37:20.230
the television show,
you know,
Facebook,
you know,

1496
01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:25.360
Facebook,
there's more than one person interested in it.
And Facebook,

1497
01:37:25.361 --> 01:37:27.610
you know,
they,
they,

1498
01:37:28.150 --> 01:37:32.020
they compensated me well for the four years of work that I worked on the

1499
01:37:32.021 --> 01:37:36.580
television series.
So,
you know,
I'm very comfortable right now,
you know,

1500
01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:41.320
I mean,
humans of New York,
uh,
has made me a,

1501
01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:42.581
let's just say I'm not,

1502
01:37:42.581 --> 01:37:46.230
I'm not working about worrying about peanut butter and sandwiches.
You know,
I'm,

1503
01:37:46.231 --> 01:37:49.540
I'm,
I'm,
I'm very comfortable.
Um,

1504
01:37:50.650 --> 01:37:53.110
with that being said,
uh,

1505
01:37:53.890 --> 01:37:58.110
I will say that humans of New York has raised,

1506
01:37:59.430 --> 01:38:00.690
I've,
I've made,

1507
01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:06.270
I've made a fraction of the money with humans of New York that we have raised

1508
01:38:06.271 --> 01:38:10.560
for charity.
They small fraction of the money that we've raised for charity.

1509
01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:15.720
Um,
I have turned down maybe more money than I've made,

1510
01:38:16.230 --> 01:38:16.950
uh,

1511
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:21.950
from people who want to use my brand to partner with their brand.

1512
01:38:23.550 --> 01:38:24.870
You know,
um,

1513
01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:29.250
the big brands have offered me a lot of money to do.

1514
01:38:29.251 --> 01:38:32.760
Humans have,
and I'm just going to make up some names.
You know what I mean?
Like,

1515
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.240
humans of Mercedes Benz,
humans have,
you know,

1516
01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:40.640
humans of China sponsored by Virgin Airlines.

1517
01:38:40.650 --> 01:38:43.860
These are all fake things and I'm making up right now,

1518
01:38:43.861 --> 01:38:48.210
but had resembled offers that have been made to me.
Um,

1519
01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:53.240
where were I make the dividing line is that I'm willing to make money as Brandon

1520
01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:58.600
Stanton.
Uh,
a big part of my income comes from speeches.
You know,

1521
01:38:58.610 --> 01:39:02.850
I give about 10 of these a year.
Um,

1522
01:39:03.570 --> 01:39:08.130
and,
uh,
that is a big part of my income.
Uh,

1523
01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:12.210
I have sell books is Brandon Stanton.
Um,

1524
01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:16.590
I don't,
so the name humans of New York to anyone.

1525
01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:21.060
I don't rent my brand to anyone.
Um,

1526
01:39:21.210 --> 01:39:26.210
and because I never want any piece of content that I share to have a single

1527
01:39:28.351 --> 01:39:33.030
motive,
I,
I've never broken that seal.
And you know,
it's been,

1528
01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:37.170
it's been so tempting,
but I just know if I break it once,

1529
01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:41.130
I'm never going to get it back.
Um,
so I,

1530
01:39:41.490 --> 01:39:43.140
for seven years,

1531
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:48.350
I've never been compensated for a piece of content that I've posted on my blog.

1532
01:39:49.130 --> 01:39:51.780
Uh,
and you know,
that is,

1533
01:39:51.810 --> 01:39:55.470
that is the main delineation.
Um,

1534
01:39:55.710 --> 01:40:00.030
then I make between,
you know,
what can be monetized and what can't.

1535
01:40:00.031 --> 01:40:02.160
And because of that,
like I said,

1536
01:40:02.161 --> 01:40:06.180
I'm not worrying about peanut butter and sandwiches anymore.
Um,
but you know,

1537
01:40:06.181 --> 01:40:09.180
there is,
there is a little bit of an insecurity.

1538
01:40:09.181 --> 01:40:11.460
Am I going to look back and 40 years if everything,

1539
01:40:11.610 --> 01:40:15.150
suddenly everything's suddenly goes away on Facebook and Instagram,

1540
01:40:15.151 --> 01:40:17.430
nobody you're using anymore.
Am I going to be like,
Oh man,

1541
01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:21.360
I'm working the night shift and now

1542
01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:26.190
at 20 million followers 20 years ago,

1543
01:40:26.191 --> 01:40:29.250
maybe I should have tried a little harder to make some money.
But,
uh,

1544
01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:30.360
that's how I view it now.

1545
01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:35.130
<v 1>Should have done this humans in New York lunchbox as well.
I had the chance.
Uh,</v>

1546
01:40:36.290 --> 01:40:39.460
so you mentioned the book,
I'd like to chat about that for,

1547
01:40:39.670 --> 01:40:44.570
for a second because it's,
it's been the books at this point,
certainly,
but the,

1548
01:40:46.010 --> 01:40:49.610
at least as I understand it,
the first book,
so millions of copies,

1549
01:40:49.850 --> 01:40:54.130
certainly more than a million.
Was it easy to find a,
for that first book?

1550
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:58.090
<v 6>No.
Um,
I,
I,</v>

1551
01:40:58.510 --> 01:41:03.460
I barely did.
Um,
the Mcmillan,

1552
01:41:03.630 --> 01:41:08.050
uh,
God blessed them.
So,
like at the time,
you know,

1553
01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:08.913
I,

1554
01:41:09.370 --> 01:41:13.090
I think when I sold the book and I had a few hundred thousand Facebook fans and

1555
01:41:13.091 --> 01:41:17.200
it was growing so fast,
you know,
there was so much energy,
you know,

1556
01:41:17.201 --> 01:41:21.250
things are really taking off.
And I just thought,
oh my gosh,
you know,

1557
01:41:21.251 --> 01:41:24.330
everybody's going to want to publish this book.
Uh,
and,

1558
01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:27.940
and there's six big publishers,
I'm sure you know all this,
um,

1559
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.600
or seven or something like that.
And you,
you,
you,

1560
01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:35.710
the goal is to get all of them interested.
Um,
and so,

1561
01:41:36.010 --> 01:41:39.830
and then,
you know,
in the perfect world,
all of them are interested in,

1562
01:41:39.831 --> 01:41:42.520
then they bid against each other.
Right.
Um,

1563
01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:47.700
and so I only three of them would meet with me or four of them maybe.

1564
01:41:48.670 --> 01:41:52.840
Um,
and during those meetings I thought that I killed it.
You know,
I thought,

1565
01:41:52.841 --> 01:41:56.980
Oh man,
like,
ah,
then I described it so well,
I,
I,
you know,

1566
01:41:56.981 --> 01:42:00.490
presented so well,
they're all going to be very interested.

1567
01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:05.620
And so we had an auction and the,

1568
01:42:05.710 --> 01:42:10.600
the bids were due by 12 o'clock,

1569
01:42:10.660 --> 01:42:12.550
noon on one day.
Uh,

1570
01:42:12.551 --> 01:42:17.551
and it's like at 11 o'clock I hadn't heard anything from my agent

1571
01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:23.590
and I was just like,
what's going on?
So I texted him and he goes,
Oh,

1572
01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:29.190
uh,
the first three dropped out there,
they didn't make it offer.

1573
01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:34.120
There's still one that we haven't heard from yet.
Uh,
and I'm just like,
oh my God,

1574
01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:35.980
you know,
because that book was,
well,

1575
01:42:36.010 --> 01:42:38.800
that book was my life raft because I didn't have any money at that time.

1576
01:42:38.810 --> 01:42:42.490
Was hoping to get a little bit of a book deal so I could,
you know,
pay my bills.

1577
01:42:42.491 --> 01:42:46.510
And I just remember I went to the y MCA and I just ran like five miles because I

1578
01:42:46.511 --> 01:42:49.450
thought it was going to be the worst day of my life.
Um,

1579
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:54.050
and then when I got on the treadmill,
I found out that a McMillan had made a,

1580
01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:57.880
a,
a small but respectable offer.
Um,

1581
01:42:58.210 --> 01:43:02.770
and that's how I got a book deal by the skin of my teeth,
which I think was a,

1582
01:43:03.370 --> 01:43:05.980
which was lucrative for all parties involved.

1583
01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:13.030
And what were some of the reasons for not meeting with you or not putting in an

1584
01:43:13.511 --> 01:43:14.680
offer that they gave?

1585
01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:20.050
Because there's two types of books that have a history of not selling well,

1586
01:43:20.670 --> 01:43:24.430
uh,
well there's a lot of types,
but my mind fit two categories.

1587
01:43:24.490 --> 01:43:25.900
It was a photography book.

1588
01:43:26.350 --> 01:43:31.030
Photography's books don't sell based on conventional wisdom.
And it was a,

1589
01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:36.120
what they viewed as a regional book where it is a photography books center

1590
01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:41.110
centered on a single city,
therefore nobody's going to want it.

1591
01:43:41.290 --> 01:43:43.060
That was the,
that was,

1592
01:43:43.450 --> 01:43:48.360
that was the argument against publishing a humans of New York.
Oops.

1593
01:43:48.530 --> 01:43:52.280
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is,

1594
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:57.550
I love these stories because they are the rule and not the exception for so many

1595
01:44:00.291 --> 01:44:04.610
things that turn into something.
Well,
things that are not derivative.

1596
01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:09.490
You know what I mean?
In my mind and my mind,
like the most valuable ideas,

1597
01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:13.520
the one that nobody's ever seen before.
Like,
that's when you've got the gold,

1598
01:44:13.970 --> 01:44:17.570
but you've got a better chance of just choosing something else that's good and

1599
01:44:17.571 --> 01:44:21.890
making something derivative on it.
Uh,
because then when you go,

1600
01:44:21.891 --> 01:44:26.240
when you go into these places and you pitch,
you can say,
oh,

1601
01:44:26.241 --> 01:44:31.190
this is the,
uh,
this is 50 shades of gray.
But you know,

1602
01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:35.860
with furries
it's like,

1603
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:37.080
it's,
it's,

1604
01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:41.550
it's funny that like for me as an artist and as a creator,
the,

1605
01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:46.700
the last thing I ever want to do is be describing my work as it's this,

1606
01:44:47.150 --> 01:44:51.950
but with a twist,
you know what I mean?
Like I want to be creating something new.

1607
01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:55.970
Uh,
however,
in the marketplace,
the things that are,

1608
01:44:55.971 --> 01:45:00.260
have most likely chance of getting bought or things that people can,

1609
01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:03.320
can peg to other past successes.

1610
01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:08.620
And so when you walk in with something like what I thought was humans of New

1611
01:45:08.810 --> 01:45:10.070
York's greatest value,

1612
01:45:10.071 --> 01:45:14.390
which was there really wasn't anything else like it at the time,
um,

1613
01:45:15.420 --> 01:45:20.240
they viewed as a detriment.
But what are the comparables?
You're like,
ah,

1614
01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:24.500
that's the whole point there.
There aren't that right.
Copper bowls.

1615
01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:27.470
That fucking word.
I mean,
are you kidding me?

1616
01:45:27.471 --> 01:45:31.070
Like I just like the same thing.
You know,

1617
01:45:31.071 --> 01:45:33.650
when I was making the television series,
like the same thing,

1618
01:45:33.651 --> 01:45:38.600
it's like as an artist I want this to be like nothing else that's been,

1619
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:43.550
that's like the only thing I care about is making something that's really unlike

1620
01:45:43.551 --> 01:45:48.400
anything else like that.
That is,
if it's like something else,
it's,

1621
01:45:48.401 --> 01:45:49.220
it's,

1622
01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:53.930
I don't really want to obsess over it for three years trying to make it,

1623
01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:58.730
you know,
my goal is to,
is to make something new and something fresh.

1624
01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:03.680
And when you're trying to get compensated for your work,

1625
01:46:03.980 --> 01:46:04.221
you know,

1626
01:46:04.221 --> 01:46:08.120
the thing that you care about the most as an artist is often the thing that's

1627
01:46:08.121 --> 01:46:09.790
held against you the most.
Uh,

1628
01:46:10.190 --> 01:46:15.190
because people are risk averse and they want to see something comparable that

1629
01:46:15.531 --> 01:46:18.750
has also done well.
What's next for you?
I mean,

1630
01:46:19.150 --> 01:46:21.590
if you do have five year plans,

1631
01:46:21.591 --> 01:46:24.200
three year plans and so on at this point,

1632
01:46:24.201 --> 01:46:28.700
or is it still 24 hours by 24 hours?
What's next for you?

1633
01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:34.160
I do.
I'm having a baby.
So that's going to be new,

1634
01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:40.310
having a baby in July.
So beyond that,

1635
01:46:40.311 --> 01:46:43.340
which is going to be new.
Um,
the,

1636
01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:45.440
like for me right now,

1637
01:46:45.441 --> 01:46:50.441
the biggest kind of artistic tension is knowing,

1638
01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:56.910
because of my experience on social media,
um,

1639
01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:01.860
the past seven years,
knowing,

1640
01:47:02.490 --> 01:47:05.070
knowing how social media works,

1641
01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:10.100
knowing the importance of output and content and daily content and,

1642
01:47:11.310 --> 01:47:16.070
and,
um,
engagement and things like that.
Um,

1643
01:47:16.230 --> 01:47:21.230
knowing how to build an audience on one hand and wanting to push myself as an

1644
01:47:22.710 --> 01:47:27.150
artist.
On the other hand,
um,
and you know,

1645
01:47:27.151 --> 01:47:30.930
what I really want to do as an artist is I kind of want to withdraw from the

1646
01:47:30.931 --> 01:47:33.900
daily,
you know,
output model.
Uh,

1647
01:47:33.901 --> 01:47:38.670
I want to work on things that have longer timeframes that are more polished and,

1648
01:47:38.671 --> 01:47:43.410
or maybe longer,
but take longer to produce and,
and more resources.

1649
01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:46.500
Uh,
but that in order to do that,

1650
01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:51.420
that requires me to kind of pull back from the blog,
um,
which,

1651
01:47:51.690 --> 01:47:55.740
you know,
the,
the golden rule of,
you know,

1652
01:47:55.770 --> 01:47:58.530
social media is keep engaging with your audience.

1653
01:47:58.530 --> 01:48:02.130
Keep connecting with your audience.
You know,
don't lose touch,
don't lose touch.

1654
01:48:02.131 --> 01:48:04.230
Don't lose touch.
Uh,

1655
01:48:04.950 --> 01:48:08.730
but the artist in me wants to go disappear for awhile and you know,

1656
01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:13.390
go into a dark cave and come out with something.
Uh,
so I think,
you know,

1657
01:48:13.391 --> 01:48:17.010
that is,
that is the main push and pull in my mind right now.
Um,

1658
01:48:17.011 --> 01:48:20.630
so I'm going to be going to the Philippines next month,
uh,

1659
01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:22.560
to work on,

1660
01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:27.000
I'm going to spend a month filming a documentary on somebody because I love

1661
01:48:27.001 --> 01:48:32.001
documentaries and I want to make a documentary that is very interesting.

1662
01:48:32.461 --> 01:48:37.461
So that might not be what's best for business or best for growing audience or

1663
01:48:38.611 --> 01:48:42.930
best buy social media metrics.
But that is,

1664
01:48:43.110 --> 01:48:47.150
that is what is exciting to me and it,
and it all comes back to that moment.

1665
01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:51.690
It's like,
I,
it's so funny and I think you're probably the same way,

1666
01:48:51.691 --> 01:48:55.770
is that we have these mantras and these things that we've learned,
uh,

1667
01:48:56.310 --> 01:49:00.450
that we stand on stage and we,
and we say,
and we,
and we think about,
you know,

1668
01:49:00.451 --> 01:49:04.410
don't wait for the perfect idea.
You know,
it's never going to seem perfect.

1669
01:49:04.411 --> 01:49:06.870
You just got to go after it.
Choose,
you know,

1670
01:49:06.871 --> 01:49:11.400
what is nourishing and the moment things like that.
Uh,
and if you're like me,

1671
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:16.380
like I have to,
I have to preach to myself,
you know,
a lot,

1672
01:49:16.410 --> 01:49:16.891
you know,
and,

1673
01:49:16.891 --> 01:49:20.370
and tell myself the same thing that I'm telling other people because it's so

1674
01:49:20.371 --> 01:49:21.900
easy to kind of,
you know,

1675
01:49:21.901 --> 01:49:26.730
fall back into what everybody else is struggling with as well because you never

1676
01:49:26.731 --> 01:49:31.400
truly escape it.
And so,
you know,
one of the things that I do is,
you know,

1677
01:49:31.410 --> 01:49:36.410
I'd go back to that moment when I lost my job and I was walking in Chicago and I

1678
01:49:36.751 --> 01:49:41.580
asked myself,
you know,
if nothing mattered but,

1679
01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:46.350
but how I was spending my time,
you know,
what,
what would I,

1680
01:49:46.620 --> 01:49:51.280
what would be doing,
what would be most nourishing for me in any given moment?

1681
01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:56.320
Uh,
if it was,
if nothing else mattered except for how I spend my time.

1682
01:49:56.680 --> 01:50:01.270
Uh,
and you know,
I'm trying to remind myself of that,
you know,

1683
01:50:01.271 --> 01:50:02.800
the same thing.
I tell other people,

1684
01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:07.540
and right now I want to go to the Philippines and I want to make a documentary

1685
01:50:07.541 --> 01:50:12.430
and it might not be best for business and it might not be best for humans of New

1686
01:50:12.430 --> 01:50:16.390
York,
but it's what Brandon wants to do.
And so that is,
uh,

1687
01:50:16.450 --> 01:50:18.460
that is the North Star that I'm trying to follow.

1688
01:50:18.940 --> 01:50:22.480
<v 5>Good for you,
man.
I'm excited for you to disappear for a little while.</v>

1689
01:50:24.010 --> 01:50:28.660
That may come off the wrong way,
but you get the,
you get the sentiment behind it.

1690
01:50:29.060 --> 01:50:30.760
Yeah,
exactly.
And uh,

1691
01:50:30.810 --> 01:50:35.140
I have a random suggestion,

1692
01:50:35.770 --> 01:50:39.910
which is if you have not read cryptonomic on,

1693
01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:44.080
which is a book by Neil Stevenson,
also wrote snow crash.

1694
01:50:44.350 --> 01:50:49.150
I love snow crash.
So cryptonomic on part of the through line,

1695
01:50:49.151 --> 01:50:52.560
one of the narratives takes place in the Philippines.
So that could be,

1696
01:50:53.110 --> 01:50:55.770
that could be fun to pick up.
But Brendan,

1697
01:50:55.810 --> 01:50:58.540
thank you so much for taking the time today.

1698
01:50:58.541 --> 01:51:03.541
This was really a wonderful experience for me and thank you for being vulnerable

1699
01:51:03.701 --> 01:51:05.350
also.
And I'd be telling

1700
01:51:07.180 --> 01:51:12.180
filling in some of the color in the story of your life thus far.

1701
01:51:13.150 --> 01:51:16.720
Uh,
and uh,
it's,
it's been,

1702
01:51:16.750 --> 01:51:19.870
it's been really nice to get to know you a little better in this conversation.

1703
01:51:19.980 --> 01:51:24.550
Well,
thank you so much.
Um,
hope,
hope some of that's useful.
Yeah,

1704
01:51:24.670 --> 01:51:25.301
I think it is.

1705
01:51:25.301 --> 01:51:30.301
Is there anything else you would like to ask if people suggest to people and he,

1706
01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:35.530
any closing comments before we wrap up?
No,
I think that's okay.
I think that's it.

1707
01:51:38.740 --> 01:51:41.980
All right.
Awesome.
Well,
once again,

1708
01:51:42.430 --> 01:51:44.380
really appreciate you making the time,
uh,

1709
01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:48.550
particularly how much you think about how you spend your time to chat with me

1710
01:51:48.551 --> 01:51:53.551
and with everybody today and for everyone listening you can as always find links

1711
01:51:54.341 --> 01:51:59.341
to everything we have spoken about to all of Brandon's projects as well in the

1712
01:51:59.681 --> 01:52:04.681
show notes@tim.blog for slash podcast and until next time,

1713
01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:08.970
do what is nourishing for you in the moment or at least ponder the question.

1714
01:52:09.660 --> 01:52:13.860
And thanks for listening.
Hey guys,
this is Tim again.

1715
01:52:13.861 --> 01:52:17.040
Just a few more things before you take off.
Number one,

1716
01:52:17.310 --> 01:52:22.200
this is five bullet Friday.
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1717
01:52:22.230 --> 01:52:26.400
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

1718
01:52:26.401 --> 01:52:29.940
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

1719
01:52:29.941 --> 01:52:34.890
short email where I share the coolest things I found or that I've been pondering

1720
01:52:34.891 --> 01:52:38.580
over the week.
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1721
01:52:38.581 --> 01:52:42.060
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1722
01:52:42.061 --> 01:52:46.010
somehow dug up in the other world of the,
as I

1723
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:46.640
<v 0>do.</v>

1724
01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:51.640
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

1725
01:52:52.281 --> 01:52:55.010
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

1726
01:52:55.100 --> 01:53:00.080
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend,

1727
01:53:00.140 --> 01:53:02.300
so if you want to receive that,
check it out.

1728
01:53:02.570 --> 01:53:07.250
Just go to a four hour work week.com that's four hour work week.com all spelled

1729
01:53:07.251 --> 01:53:11.390
out and just drop in your email and you'll get the very next one and if you sign

1730
01:53:11.391 --> 01:53:12.500
up,
I hope you enjoy it.

1731
01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:16.760
This episode is brought to you by four sigmatic.

1732
01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:20.510
If you're a longtime listener of the show,
we're brand new to the podcast.

1733
01:53:20.900 --> 01:53:23.930
My favorite finish entrepreneurs who founded this company.
Of course,

1734
01:53:23.931 --> 01:53:27.350
I don't know that many Finnish entrepreneurs,
but they may be my favorites,

1735
01:53:27.530 --> 01:53:32.420
have something new that I've been loving and some of you are familiar with.

1736
01:53:32.421 --> 01:53:34.730
Four sigmatic.
I've used their products for years now.

1737
01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:39.680
There were introduced to me by an Acrobat of all folks and they tend to mix

1738
01:53:39.681 --> 01:53:42.590
different types of medicinal mushrooms into their products.

1739
01:53:43.370 --> 01:53:46.460
I have recently started using their Mecha,
which is a green tea,

1740
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.900
which is designed as a coffee alternative and if you're trying to cut back on

1741
01:53:50.901 --> 01:53:52.550
caffeine as I am these days,

1742
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:57.110
the match is a great option and one that I originally learned to love in Japan

1743
01:53:57.111 --> 01:53:58.940
has a very smooth texture to it.

1744
01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:03.860
They're macho blend in particular includes the amino acid [inaudible],

1745
01:54:04.250 --> 01:54:05.750
which helps to provide a,

1746
01:54:05.930 --> 01:54:09.380
let's call it balanced boost of energy without jitters and also includes the

1747
01:54:09.381 --> 01:54:12.590
adaptogen astrologists.
I'm pronouncing that correctly,

1748
01:54:12.830 --> 01:54:15.260
which may help with overall stress tolerance.

1749
01:54:15.770 --> 01:54:17.570
And for those of you who are wondering,
no,

1750
01:54:17.930 --> 01:54:19.790
the products don't taste like mushrooms.

1751
01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:23.390
If they say mushroom coffee for instance,
another product that I use,

1752
01:54:23.530 --> 01:54:26.090
it doesn't taste like mushrooms.
It tastes like coffee,

1753
01:54:26.210 --> 01:54:31.210
but you get to the nutritional benefits of some of these special ingredients.

1754
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:34.160
So the products still taste like mushrooms and are enjoyable.

1755
01:54:34.490 --> 01:54:37.730
I offer them to my house guests and use them myself,

1756
01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:41.960
and I don't particularly want to drink anything that tastes like mushrooms.

1757
01:54:42.050 --> 01:54:46.490
So living on the folks that foursigmatic have designed a few special deals for

1758
01:54:46.491 --> 01:54:47.660
