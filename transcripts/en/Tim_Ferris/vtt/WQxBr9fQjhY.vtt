Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:06.150
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.340
Now it does seem

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.800
like I'm a cybernetic organism,
living tissue over meadow.

graphic design related.

7
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers including

8
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.670
sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

9
00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:41.660
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

10
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.900
the brainstorming and a lot of it took place with designers from around the

11
00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:49.100
world and here's how it works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,

12
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.580
a website,
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

13
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.330
you submit that project and designers from around the world.

14
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.970
We'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

15
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.660
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

16
00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:04.370
money back.
It's that straight forward.

17
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.060
And many of you who are listening have already used it and created some amazing

18
00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:10.460
things that I'll be sharing in the future.
But in the meantime,

27
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.240
I've been using listen headphones since they came out,

28
00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:45.780
partially because the founders started the company after reading the four hour

29
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:48.810
workweek and now they're available in Nordstrom and all over the place.

30
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.840
They're super high quality and if you want to see the headphones that I travel

38
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.380
Hello homies in home ets.

39
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:25.210
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

40
00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:30.211
my job is to deconstruct world class performers to dig into the minds of people

41
00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:34.870
who are the best at what they do,
to try to pull out the tactics,
the routines,

42
00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:37.270
the habits,
the favorite books,
et Cetera,

43
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.050
coping strategies and some cases that you can implement right away.

44
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.380
And that ranges from hedge fund managers to chess prodigies to celebrities like

45
00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:48.730
Arnold Schwarzenegger to iconic music producers like Rick Rubin.

46
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.110
And everything in between.

47
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.440
This particular episode was an experiment and I think very appropriately and

48
00:02:55.451 --> 00:02:58.660
experiment because it includes two people,
a couple,

49
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.730
my couple on the podcast.

50
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.820
The first person is Dr Astro Teller.

51
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.860
So Astro is a computer scientist and entrepreneur who currently oversees Google

52
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.290
x,
which is Google's moonshot factory.

53
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.590
They basically tried to do anything that seems completely absurd and world

54
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:17.690
changing,
uh,

55
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.830
like putting up balloons to give broadband to the entire planet or who knows

56
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:26.290
teleportation,
you name it.
If it's,
if it's crazy enough and big enough,

57
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:30.640
chances are it falls under his purview.
Then you have doctor Danielle teller,

58
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.240
his wife who's a physician specializing in intensive care in lung medicines.

59
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:38.860
She is trained doctors and run research at Harvard University and the University

60
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.050
of Pittsburgh for instance.
They are both very,

61
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:45.370
very powerful minds and our conversation is about many things,

62
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:48.850
but it focuses on something I personally have not figured out,

63
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:53.440
which is relationships and both astro Daniel know from personal experience that

64
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:57.610
finding the right life partner doesn't always happen the first time around.

65
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.260
And through their own respective divorces they learn how widely held assumptions

66
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.630
and misinformation about relationships,

67
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:09.010
what they refer to as sacred cows create all sorts of unnecessary suffering.

68
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.840
Uh,
so the,

69
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.110
the preacher and the idea was to really dig in because these are two very driven

70
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:19.390
people dig into the rigor that is established,

71
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:23.650
both of them as leaders in their respective fields to have them walk me through

72
00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:25.450
how they think about relationships.

73
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.710
How do you take to very type a personalities and have them survive and thrive in

74
00:04:30.711 --> 00:04:31.301
a relationship?

75
00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:35.080
That's something I have not figured out that these two really seem to have

76
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:37.870
figured out.
Uh,
many different aspects.

77
00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:42.040
So we sat down to have some wine and a so thank you for putting up with all

78
00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:46.690
sorts of echoes and dramatic wine pouring acoustics.
But uh,

79
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.960
I greatly enjoyed this conversation and I hope you do as well.

80
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.070
So please meet doctors astro and Daniel Taylor,

81
00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.060
<v 2>welcome to you.
Tim Ferriss,
his dining table.</v>

82
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.160
This is clearly Tim Ferris and we have some incredible guests here.

83
00:05:04.161 --> 00:05:08.120
We've already warmed up with a bite to eat some salmon as well as some wine.

84
00:05:08.121 --> 00:05:10.730
We've had some mall Beck of course.
As you know,

85
00:05:10.731 --> 00:05:15.560
one of my favorites is this true PJ terroir series 2009.

86
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.370
And we have a backup just in case we need that to facilitate the conversation.

87
00:05:19.371 --> 00:05:22.970
So you don't hear a bunch of signing and gloves of line for an hour and a half

88
00:05:22.971 --> 00:05:27.170
or two hours.
I don't think that'll be a problem.
Uh,
we have two very,

89
00:05:27.171 --> 00:05:28.340
very bright folks here.

90
00:05:28.341 --> 00:05:33.341
And what makes these folks so interesting is that they are a couple,

91
00:05:33.591 --> 00:05:38.591
this is the first time I've interviewed a couple and a and on top of that,

92
00:05:39.261 --> 00:05:43.070
people who can talk about not just being top performers in their respective

93
00:05:43.071 --> 00:05:47.030
fields,
but how to harmonize a family,

94
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.830
how to operate with significant others,
uh,
and with children.

95
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.060
So I'm really looking forward to exploring this.
And,
uh,

96
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.450
we have Danielle and astro teller.
Welcome to the show.
Thank you.

97
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.280
Thanks for having us.
And,
uh,
I,
I know it's,

98
00:06:03.281 --> 00:06:07.900
it's very typical to sort of ask you to do the doctor you will thing and it's an

99
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.690
explain,
uh,
your background.
But,
uh,
there's a lot that can be found,

100
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.510
I'm sure on the web when people want to,

101
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.030
to search and explore your respective expertise.

102
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:21.500
But I do want to dig into a little bit of what both of you are up to you to

103
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:25.340
provide some context for the conversations that we'll have in the topics we'll

104
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:29.000
dig into.
So,
uh,
maybe we could start with you,

105
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.940
Danielle and just chat a little bit about,
uh,

106
00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:36.941
what you've been obsessed with or what has consumed you for the last year,

107
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.420
year and a half,
and what you,
uh,
maybe a snapshot of what you did before that.

108
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.920
<v 3>Sure.
Um,
my current obsession is the writing.</v>

109
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.620
So writing was my childhood dream.

110
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.210
I always wanted to write novels as typical Bookworm,

111
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.130
love to just immerse myself in books all day.

112
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.720
And then I realized that it's a really,
really hard way to make money.
Yeah.

113
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.290
And I got scared and decided to go to medical school instead.

114
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.910
But for the last year,

115
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.160
I have actually returned to my childhood dream and I'm writing a novel about

116
00:07:10.161 --> 00:07:13.280
Cinderella's stepmother,
which is the,
a lot of fun.
Yeah.

117
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.270
<v 2>Why Cinderella's stepmother?</v>

118
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.990
<v 3>I mostly honestly,</v>

119
00:07:18.991 --> 00:07:23.640
because I am the stepmother and I think a lot about being a stepmother.

120
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.840
And the more I think about it,

121
00:07:24.841 --> 00:07:29.540
the way I think they get a really bad rap in fairy tales.

122
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.250
There are always the bad guy.
The mom's always dead.

123
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.840
And if there's a villain it's most often the stepmother.
And I just,
yeah,

124
00:07:36.841 --> 00:07:40.010
I wanted to sort of correct.
So people's impression divided about stem,

125
00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.853
others a little bit.

126
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.520
I feel like the stories are not being told from the stepmother's perspective.

127
00:07:44.521 --> 00:07:46.470
So this one is from her perspective.

128
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.490
<v 2>And what,
uh,
what were you doing prior to starting this?
Right?</v>

129
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:56.110
<v 3>Prior to that I was working most recently in Boston at Harvard,
uh,</v>

130
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.240
as a physician and researcher.

131
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:03.570
So I did my teaching and my medical work in the intensive care unit and I did my

132
00:08:05.321 --> 00:08:07.750
research in a basic science lab.

133
00:08:07.751 --> 00:08:12.010
I had a small lab that I ran there and we looked into the origins of chronic

134
00:08:12.011 --> 00:08:14.290
lung disease.
That's what we were excited about.

135
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:19.200
<v 2>And uh,
the,
so the chronic lung disease is interesting to me.</v>

136
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.320
Some people may know this already,
but so,
so I won't Belabor the point.

137
00:08:22.321 --> 00:08:27.321
But I was born premature and had a lot of lung issues so that's born and my left

138
00:08:27.631 --> 00:08:31.820
lung collapsed and had,
uh,
five,
uh,
full body of blood transfusion.

139
00:08:31.821 --> 00:08:36.540
So I still have a lot of thermoregulation problems that,

140
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:37.493
uh,

141
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:43.120
that I think are related to my two decreased respiratory volume,

142
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:47.430
so I can't dissipate heat as well.
Hmm.
Uh,

143
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.660
but we can,
we can dig into that perhaps another time.
Uh,

144
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.890
astro,
what about yourself?
Well,

145
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.880
<v 4>over the last year for my day job,</v>

146
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:04.440
I've been spending time at Google x and trying to make the world a better place,

147
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.660
having a good time doing it.
And then Danielle and I have finished the book,

148
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:10.680
sacred cows.

149
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:15.600
I got it out there and are starting to explore what we might right next to him.

150
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.890
<v 2>How do you choose,
how did the two of you,
and I asked her,
of course,</v>

151
00:09:19.891 --> 00:09:24.700
we've known each other for quite a few years now.
And how do you choose,

152
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:29.770
how do you decide what the next big project is or the next you mean personally

153
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:35.200
or I you mean at Google x either and,
and uh,
I mean that,

154
00:09:35.201 --> 00:09:39.150
that tells me that you separate the two also.
So what,
how do you choose

155
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.830
<v 4>either of them or both of them?
I don't think the hour that separated,</v>

156
00:09:43.831 --> 00:09:48.300
I think choosing anything to spend your time on or to have a group of people

157
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:53.301
spend their time on is a confluence of events and opportunities.

158
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:58.420
You know,
at Google x we focus more on,
you know,

159
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.060
is there a huge problem,

160
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:04.200
is there a radical new way to get at solving that problem?

161
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:09.330
Is there some science or technology perspective from which we really think we

162
00:10:09.331 --> 00:10:11.460
could make progress in that radical solution?

163
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.670
That's the confluence that we tend to look for there.

164
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.120
But it really does mean that you can have two of those things.

165
00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:21.030
And if the third one doesn't connect,
there's just nothing to be done.

166
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.120
But in our case,
you know,

167
00:10:24.121 --> 00:10:29.121
we were both going through divorces and then ended up marrying each other.

168
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.520
And because we were going through our divorces at the same time,

169
00:10:32.521 --> 00:10:37.050
we spend a lot of time as we were falling in love and preparing to get married,

170
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:42.110
talking about our divorces and that led to ultimately this book where we would

171
00:10:43.801 --> 00:10:48.801
never have planned to write a nonself help book about,

172
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.660
you know,
the truth behind marriage and divorce.

173
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.960
If we had been happily married and just like met at a playground or on the

174
00:10:57.661 --> 00:10:59.640
street and said,
hey,
you want to read a book together?

175
00:10:59.641 --> 00:11:04.230
That's just not realistic and I think a lot of the opportunities that come to us

176
00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:08.400
in life are these confluence of events that you can't plan on.

177
00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:10.260
You can only recognize when the happen

178
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.530
<v 2>that does that mean this is,</v>

179
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:17.560
that's that's that is something that I often say when people ask me what my 10

180
00:11:17.601 --> 00:11:20.150
year plan is,
do you have a 10 year plan?

181
00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:24.050
Because I feel very conflicted about

182
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:30.910
preventing the serendipity of these confluence of factors by having a very

183
00:11:32.721 --> 00:11:36.020
longterm plan that I tried to hold to.
Is that what do you,

184
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.040
what's your thinking on that?

185
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:42.270
<v 4>My longterm plan.
I've,
I've had the same answer for that for kind of awhile.</v>

186
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:42.721
Again,

187
00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:46.440
I think this is both in my professional life and in my what's called pseudo

188
00:11:46.441 --> 00:11:49.520
professional life,
like writing books.
Uh,

189
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:53.710
I want to be working on really hard things that matter with really amazing

190
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:55.120
people I can learn from.
Yeah.

191
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.200
And that has nothing to do with whether I'm getting paid to do it,

192
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:04.150
whether it's because my coauthor and a book is my amazing wife.

193
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.750
Or if it's people who I work with at Google x or at some other place in the

194
00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:08.410
future,

195
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:12.100
I won't do anything that doesn't have those characteristics and I'll sign up for

196
00:12:12.101 --> 00:12:13.750
almost anything that has those carrots.

197
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:18.180
<v 2>Juristics
that's a good answer.
I,</v>

198
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:23.310
how did the two of you,
uh,
they have Danieli chat talking about this.

199
00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.590
How do you attack problems differently or,

200
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.870
or do you,
maybe you have complimentary skill sets?
Uh,
I'm just very curious.

201
00:12:33.871 --> 00:12:38.390
When you have a challenge as a,
as a couple or if you were just in an,

202
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.750
in a parallel universe sort of working together and trying to solve probably the

203
00:12:42.751 --> 00:12:45.280
front of you,
whatever those might be.
How do you,

204
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:46.000
<v 3>how do you,</v>

205
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
I think we're actually fairly similar in how we approach challenges in the,

206
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.000
how we approached the future where quite different.

207
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.730
Astra is a planner and I'm not,

208
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:02.530
I read a column the long time ago by David Brooks where he described,
you know,

209
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.170
everyone's got two kinds of people,
but he described these two kinds of people,

210
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:09.040
either the planners who have got everything worked out for the next decade or

211
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:09.670
two.

212
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:13.180
And then there are the people who wander through life looking for the next open

213
00:13:13.181 --> 00:13:14.920
door.
And if it looks interesting,

214
00:13:14.921 --> 00:13:18.460
they go through it and they don't really worry about whether that's part of a 10

215
00:13:18.461 --> 00:13:21.130
year plan or not.
Right?
So he's the former,
I'm the ladder,

216
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.900
so we're very different in terms of planning about the future,
et cetera.

217
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.110
But I think,
I think when new challenges arise,

218
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.990
we both tend to be very

219
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:38.580
logical people and that it's not that we're not passionate or emotional about

220
00:13:38.741 --> 00:13:39.011
things,

221
00:13:39.011 --> 00:13:44.011
but we both approach problems from a pretty intellectual perspective.

222
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.590
And so because we've approached in the same way,

223
00:13:47.591 --> 00:13:50.860
I think that helps us to talk through them and get as close as we can to a

224
00:13:50.861 --> 00:13:51.694
solution.

225
00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:57.090
<v 4>I think it's true.
I would a color commentary on that.
We have a joke,</v>

226
00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.080
uh,

227
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:03.080
which is if we were a world war two era Britain,

228
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.550
British posters,

229
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.240
if she would be keep calm and carry on and you know,

230
00:14:09.241 --> 00:14:10.740
the Silicon Valley version of that,

231
00:14:10.741 --> 00:14:15.450
the one that's all green and has a crown at the top.
But if you look closely,

232
00:14:15.451 --> 00:14:19.020
it's made out of like wrenches and screwdrivers and stuff.
Okay.

233
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.010
And it says get excited and make things.
Ah,
yes.
That's me.

234
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:28.230
And it's not,
I think there's actually quite a bit of truth in that.

235
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:33.540
My way of trying to get through adversity is to change things,

236
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:38.940
is to put out effort when things get really shitty.
I don't like to sit around.

237
00:14:38.941 --> 00:14:43.941
I like to change something and I kind of just a churn up my gears if I can't.

238
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.190
And Danielle sort of the opposite,
that when things get really complicated,

239
00:14:50.191 --> 00:14:52.010
she can be much zen and

240
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:56.840
<v 2>patients and just get through it.
Um,
that doesn't chew up her gears.</v>

241
00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.820
Uh,
I've,
I've obviously,
uh,

242
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:07.580
I've listened to the Ted talk that you guys did together.
Um,
I've,
uh,

243
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:12.290
I've read through the book and even though it,

244
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:17.500
it is looking at relationships,
not exclusively certainly,
but,
uh,

245
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:22.340
through the shared experience that you have,
uh,
many shared experiences,

246
00:15:22.341 --> 00:15:25.460
but one of them being divorced,
uh,
I found that a lot of the,

247
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.910
the thought experiments and questions in this,
we're,

248
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.230
we're very fascinating and,
uh,

249
00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:36.530
we're going to delve into a lot of that I need and I'm sure we'll jump around,

250
00:15:36.531 --> 00:15:40.130
but,
but I'd love to start with the,

251
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:45.430
the idea of a,
uh,
a soul mate and sort of the one that is,

252
00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:49.130
is meant for any given person,
you know,
that there's that,

253
00:15:49.131 --> 00:15:52.190
that Shining Star and uh,

254
00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:53.380
<v 3>yeah,</v>

255
00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:57.610
<v 2>I'd love for you guys to,
to,
to talk about your position on that.</v>

256
00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:02.560
And,
uh,
maybe as part of that just elaborate.
This is something,
I'm 37,

257
00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:04.690
of course I'm thinking about these as well.
Like what,

258
00:16:04.691 --> 00:16:09.691
what were the non negotiables for you both that allowed you and are that are

259
00:16:10.841 --> 00:16:14.770
allowing you to have a happy union.
Does that make sense?
And then you can,

260
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.940
you can separate those two.
But those are two totally different questions.
Yeah.

261
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.760
Those are two totally different questions.
Um,

262
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.770
that I thought I would just make one very difficult long question.

263
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:27.600
You want to answer the one true Cowan?
I'll answer the second one.

264
00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:32.650
<v 3>Sure.
Uh,
so the way we approach it in the book,
okay.</v>

265
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.910
Is as one approach is religion,

266
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:41.210
which is to say I might be a very strong believer in my religion and field,

267
00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:47.430
uh,
at an emotional level as well as an intellectual level that would,

268
00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:52.460
I believe is true and recognize that other people don't have that faith,

269
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.510
that they can't,
they just don't believe it.

270
00:16:54.511 --> 00:16:57.150
They can't bring themselves to believe it even if they wanted to believe it.

271
00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:02.550
I was a,
an agnostic,

272
00:17:02.551 --> 00:17:05.730
I guess about true love.
No,

273
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.400
I was an atheist about your love,
I guess.

274
00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:13.230
I really didn't believe that there was such a thing as true love and I

275
00:17:13.231 --> 00:17:16.890
approached my life through that Lens.

276
00:17:16.891 --> 00:17:20.130
Basically when we fell in love,

277
00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.300
it was as though the way I viewed it,

278
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.210
everything in life changed.
I just,

279
00:17:27.211 --> 00:17:32.040
I saw even the literature I had read before,
poetry I'd read before,

280
00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:35.070
I felt like all of a sudden I had this superior vision.

281
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.550
I could tell which poets were really in love and which ones weren't.

282
00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:43.140
It's like having tasted something or experience something for the first time and

283
00:17:43.141 --> 00:17:47.940
then you sort of see it around you and I don't know,
it's,
it's,

284
00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.270
you see something that wasn't there.
Right.
It's like the sixth sense when that,

285
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.920
oh my God,
there were doing off.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Yeah.
So,

286
00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:01.070
so I think that what we say in the book is that we're believers and yet we

287
00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:04.260
recognize that not everyone is.
And I don't know,

288
00:18:04.261 --> 00:18:07.510
I mean certainly we don't think that everybody's going to find their soul mate

289
00:18:07.511 --> 00:18:10.820
or that there's a soul mate for everybody or that there's even just one soulmate

290
00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:11.760
for,
for people.

291
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:16.560
But that there is a very important qualitative difference between different

292
00:18:16.561 --> 00:18:21.250
kinds of romantic love,
that not every romantic love is the same.
And,
and,

293
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.193
um,

294
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:27.380
there are some types of love that just required that you be together.

295
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:31.170
And Plato described it.
Uh,
you know,

296
00:18:31.171 --> 00:18:36.171
the original sort of platonic ideal of love was that humans were cut in half by

297
00:18:38.191 --> 00:18:42.900
Zeus and we're forced to wander the world looking for their other half.

298
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.120
And then once they found their other half,

299
00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.420
they just became bonded to that other half.

300
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:53.750
And they could just lie down and stay together for forever.

301
00:18:54.751 --> 00:18:57.840
And if you ask them,
what is it that you want,
what is it that you're looking for?

302
00:18:57.841 --> 00:19:02.040
They wouldn't be able to tell you what it was.
And Plato says it's not sex.

303
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.170
It's not,
you know,
it's,

304
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.580
they can't explain what it is because they have just found that,

305
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:09.743
that thing.

306
00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:13.700
<v 4>So,
uh,
that Danielle got,
uh,</v>

307
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:17.260
the poetic version.
Let me give you the intellectual version.

308
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:19.840
So I personally agree with her.

309
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.380
So what I'm about to describe to you is what we say in the book on the same

310
00:19:23.381 --> 00:19:24.214
subject.

311
00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:29.250
I feel exactly the same that I was an atheist and I now religious in this sense

312
00:19:30.821 --> 00:19:35.800
about true love,
but one of the boogie man in our societies,

313
00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.580
in our society,
on the subject of marriage and divorce,

314
00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:44.700
one of the unfair narratives which society keeps and uses to bludgeon people as

315
00:19:46.871 --> 00:19:47.800
it chooses,

316
00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:53.080
is that true love exists before marriage.
Yeah.

317
00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:57.670
If you're not married yet,
then your only best,

318
00:19:57.671 --> 00:20:02.671
highest purpose in life is to find true love and anything is worth it to find

319
00:20:03.971 --> 00:20:04.830
that thing.
Yeah.

320
00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:09.940
Including up to and including ditching somebody's moments before you say the

321
00:20:09.941 --> 00:20:10.960
words I do.
Yeah.

322
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:15.990
Well that was one of the thoughts and yet moments after you say the words I do,

323
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.670
true love does not exist.
Because if you tell your family,

324
00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.820
if you tell your parents,
if you tell your spouse for sure,

325
00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:29.410
if you tell your children moments after you get married,
weeks,
months,

326
00:20:29.411 --> 00:20:30.880
or years after you get married,

327
00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.650
that you have now fallen in love with somebody else or that you think love is

328
00:20:35.651 --> 00:20:38.190
out there,
but it's not with your current spouse.
Right?

329
00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.910
What will everyone tell you?

330
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.800
They will absolutely positively tell you that what you have is as good as it's

331
00:20:44.801 --> 00:20:49.801
ever going to get and that that like we want to have it one way up to marriage,

332
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.650
but then we all pretend that it's the opposite,

333
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:58.600
but this thing doesn't exist after marriage.
Right?
That's Bs and that's,

334
00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:03.920
it's hypocritical and our society uses this to try to create fear and shame to

335
00:21:05.171 --> 00:21:06.610
force people into marriage,

336
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.810
but then to try to keep them from leaving marriage and the weird believers in

337
00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:11.644
true love.

338
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.940
We're not advocates for true love or against true of.

339
00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:20.140
We're really advocating against hypocrisy that it can't be both.

340
00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.140
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
No,
that's fair.</v>

341
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:26.330
Now I realize my question about the sort of the one true love might,

342
00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.730
might actually not be the right question.
So before we,

343
00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:34.350
that that's that sort of predicated on I think an a narrative that a lot of

344
00:21:34.351 --> 00:21:39.150
people have,
which is find the one true love,
get married,
have kids.

345
00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:41.250
And uh,

346
00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.870
in my own personal life looking at a lot of my friends,

347
00:21:45.871 --> 00:21:47.870
there are people who are happily married the night.

348
00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.150
I do know some older folks,

349
00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.900
usually men or that I'm closest with who had been happily married for a long

350
00:21:54.901 --> 00:21:56.340
time and I'm sure they have the ups and downs,

351
00:21:56.341 --> 00:22:01.050
but I've also seen the sort of collateral damage or the,

352
00:22:01.051 --> 00:22:04.560
uh,
the explosions of marriage is all around me,

353
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.870
just with friends who are saying they're the mid thirties or so.

354
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:11.940
And so I'd love to ask both of you,
what is show,

355
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:16.470
what are the misconceptions when people think of the word marriage,

356
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:19.890
what should they think of?
How should they define it for themselves?

357
00:22:19.891 --> 00:22:23.940
What does it represent?
And uh,

358
00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.730
is it for everybody?
I mean is,
is there,
is,

359
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:31.410
is it a I is,
I think a lot of people feel pressured to,

360
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:36.400
to strive towards marriage,
uh,
and then the,

361
00:22:36.401 --> 00:22:38.100
the downstream effects of kids and whatnot.

362
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:42.180
But when people are thinking of marriage and fueling that type of pressure as I

363
00:22:42.181 --> 00:22:46.650
do sometimes,
quite frankly,
uh,
how would you,
what advice would you give them?

364
00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:53.200
<v 3>I don't think there is a should.
I think if we would advocate for anything,</v>

365
00:22:53.201 --> 00:22:58.201
it's just having the space to make your own decision without a lot of social

366
00:22:58.301 --> 00:22:59.134
pressure.

367
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.940
The social pressure doesn't help and it's not right and always in the right

368
00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:05.500
direction.
Yeah.

369
00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.830
I think that there are a lot of different reasons to get married and I'm not

370
00:23:08.831 --> 00:23:12.550
sure,
I mean,
you know,
we talk about to live in these highfalutin ways,

371
00:23:12.551 --> 00:23:16.360
like it's this really awesome thing,
which it is,
but not everyone finds that.

372
00:23:16.361 --> 00:23:21.190
And maybe if you don't believe in it and you're not going to experience it,

373
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.800
you know,
just like some alternative medical treatment.
If you don't believe it,

374
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:27.910
then you don't experience it.
Like maybe you need to be predisposed to it.

375
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:31.630
Some people get married because they want to have a family and they like the

376
00:23:31.631 --> 00:23:33.730
person that they're with and it's not true love,

377
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.440
but that doesn't mean it's wrong.

378
00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:40.680
I guess people just need to go into it with an open with open eyes and and

379
00:23:41.471 --> 00:23:46.471
realize what their motivation is and realize that they're going to what they end

380
00:23:46.581 --> 00:23:48.290
up getting out of it.

381
00:23:48.291 --> 00:23:51.170
What they experience in marriage is going to have a lot to do with why.

382
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:55.310
Then you got into marriage in the first place and I think,
you know,

383
00:23:55.311 --> 00:23:58.190
having both been married and divorced before,

384
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:02.120
we would wish that everyone could be happily married,

385
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:07.300
but certainly marriage isn't for everybody because being unhappily married is

386
00:24:07.311 --> 00:24:12.170
not better than being single.
I mean sometimes lonely to be single.

387
00:24:12.171 --> 00:24:14.030
They are there downsides to being single,

388
00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.480
but there are a lot of downsides to being unhappily married too.

389
00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:23.640
<v 4>The other thing I would say is that marriage is not only something that you can</v>

390
00:24:25.811 --> 00:24:28.330
end to enter into for different reasons,

391
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:33.750
but one of the main challenges associated with marriage and divorce is that

392
00:24:34.961 --> 00:24:39.640
people don't necessarily go into them with clear expectations that they share

393
00:24:39.641 --> 00:24:42.610
with themselves even or let alone with their spouse.

394
00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:46.390
So one of the other sacred cows that we talk about is the holy cow.

395
00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:51.930
And we talk about the marriage contract as though it were almost like a business

396
00:24:52.211 --> 00:24:56.590
contract.
And the concept of a contract is that you pre-negotiate friction.

397
00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:58.420
That's the entire point of a contract.
Yeah.

398
00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:01.270
But when you is not for the best case scenario,
that's right.

399
00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.300
But when you look at the marriage contract,

400
00:25:04.301 --> 00:25:09.301
that is the vows that people say in front of their friends and family is the

401
00:25:09.911 --> 00:25:12.100
worst possible form of a contract.

402
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:17.400
It has all of the pressure and seriousness of a big contract,

403
00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:21.460
but it is ultimately ambiguous because to say,

404
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.430
I promise to love you for the rest of my life,

405
00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:26.620
since that's not something anyone can control,

406
00:25:26.621 --> 00:25:30.940
how they will feel in the future is to leave completely unspoken.

407
00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:35.020
What actually you're promising now.
So if you were to say,

408
00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:38.860
I promise to stay with you,
no matter how miserable I am,

409
00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.510
that's a concrete promise.
Not a very romantic one,
but it's a concrete promise.

410
00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:48.280
If you were to say,
look,
I hope that I love you for the rest of my life.

411
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.300
If I stopped loving you,
like I'm gonna work really hard to,
you know,

412
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:55.450
work it out with you and start loving you again.
But if I can't,

413
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:59.110
I'm going to leave and you should want me to leave.
But that's also concrete.

414
00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:01.780
But we don't,
as we're entering into marriage,

415
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:06.960
have a real conversation typically with our soon to be spouse about what it is

416
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:11.980
we think we're getting into what it is that they think they're getting into and

417
00:26:11.981 --> 00:26:13.480
whether or not it's the same,

418
00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:18.720
because a lot of the hard feelings that happen at the end are really generated

419
00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:21.910
by this ambiguity that set up at the beginning.

420
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:26.160
<v 3>Yeah.
I think our society makes it harder for people to really think about these</v>

421
00:26:26.161 --> 00:26:30.510
things in a really rational way because of the pressures you're talking about.

422
00:26:30.511 --> 00:26:33.660
I think because society just puts a lot of pressure on people to get them to the

423
00:26:33.661 --> 00:26:37.870
altar,
but also the way we've turned weddings into this very tail events,

424
00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:39.480
and you get really places,

425
00:26:39.481 --> 00:26:44.481
the emphasis on instead of the magic of love and love is wonderful,

426
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:49.520
but we can't let our desire to have this wonderful romantic event

427
00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:57.080
make us blind to the fact that love isn't something that we control.

428
00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.710
You know that love is actually an emotion and it's not something that you can

429
00:27:00.711 --> 00:27:00.921
just,

430
00:27:00.921 --> 00:27:04.730
there's no switch inside your heart that you can just turn on that will make you

431
00:27:04.731 --> 00:27:07.550
love someone.
Or if that love fades away,

432
00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.690
that can make you continue to feel the way that you used to feel.
Let me,

433
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.090
if they were match.com would be the most successful business in the world,
right?

434
00:27:14.091 --> 00:27:16.520
You just pick someone who seemed like they fit certain criteria.

435
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.850
You just reach into your lips switch,
turn it on,
and you'd be like,
Oh,

436
00:27:18.851 --> 00:27:22.440
I'm so in love with you.
This is great.
Right?
But it doesn't work that way.
And,

437
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:24.590
and it doesn't work that way after you're married either.

438
00:27:24.591 --> 00:27:26.870
There's no magic threshold that you cross.

439
00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.470
You're the same as the person that you dated for two years that you thought was

440
00:27:30.471 --> 00:27:33.740
really great for the first eight months and then things got worse and worse and

441
00:27:33.741 --> 00:27:37.130
you finally decided to go your separate ways.
It's not really any different.

442
00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:42.020
If you happen to have gotten married before that eight months had elapsed,

443
00:27:42.021 --> 00:27:45.380
you would be in the same position,
but society would see it very differently.

444
00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:48.320
And what and which treat your feelings very differently.

445
00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.960
<v 2>So here's,
here's a question for you guys then.
If,
uh,
you,</v>

446
00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.850
you both experienced divorce,
uh,

447
00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:59.440
why did you choose to officially get married again?
Because I mean,

448
00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:02.560
of all the places that,
uh,
in granted there's still pressure of that,

449
00:28:02.561 --> 00:28:05.620
of all the places that are somewhat for getting the bay area is pretty
forgiving.

450
00:28:05.621 --> 00:28:09.610
I mean,
there's something for everybody here.
And uh,

451
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:11.500
maybe some other podcasts,

452
00:28:11.501 --> 00:28:15.010
I'll talk about the time I accidentally wandered into a polyamorous dinner party

453
00:28:15.011 --> 00:28:19.360
by myself and then they all sat down to do self introductions and I was like,

454
00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:25.150
oh my God,
that was a big pocket.
I'm not sure.
Anyway.
That's a separate time.

455
00:28:25.151 --> 00:28:29.570
But the point being that the bay area San Francisco is,

456
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:34.100
is pretty forgiving I think is as far as those things go in the United States.

457
00:28:34.101 --> 00:28:37.690
So why didn't you guys choose to get officially married again?

458
00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:42.630
<v 4>It had nothing to do with what society wanted.</v>

459
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.870
I wouldn't have felt whole until we'd been married.

460
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:51.230
I would have been fine not to get married for the rest of my life otherwise.

461
00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.500
So it's not about marriage per se,

462
00:28:55.860 --> 00:29:00.860
but it just would have been tragic to have found my other half and then not to

463
00:29:02.821 --> 00:29:05.670
have gotten to get married to her.
That would have been

464
00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:09.830
<v 2>just not sort of a,
it's just realizing that devotion,
I mean,</v>

465
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:10.610
<v 4>whatever.</v>

466
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:15.610
We didn't need the wedding to know that we have the feelings that we have.

467
00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.840
Right.
But to not celebrate,

468
00:29:17.841 --> 00:29:21.500
it just would have been a missed opportunity.

469
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.000
<v 3>I don't know.</v>

470
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Just madly crazy about someone and you just want it to do everything you can to

471
00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:32.760
bring yourself closer to that person.
Sure.
That if the,

472
00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:35.820
it's just another level that brings you closer.

473
00:29:35.821 --> 00:29:40.050
It's not that we wouldn't have been happy living together without being married,

474
00:29:40.051 --> 00:29:43.210
but it's when you're,
when you're that in love,

475
00:29:43.211 --> 00:29:48.100
you want to be bonded in every possible way.
And that's just another way.

476
00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:53.310
<v 2>Yeah,
no,
no,
I,
I get it.
Just I had to ask,
uh,</v>

477
00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:57.500
the,
uh,
I want to come back to the,

478
00:29:57.501 --> 00:30:02.330
the one true cow for a second.
Um,
I feel like there are many,
many people,

479
00:30:02.331 --> 00:30:04.490
and I talked to a lot of friends for instance,

480
00:30:04.491 --> 00:30:06.620
who had been with someone for a long time.

481
00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:11.300
They feel like if they were putting the other report card for that person,

482
00:30:11.301 --> 00:30:13.370
you know,
they're like,
they're doing really well.

483
00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:17.400
Like they're there in the 90th plus percentile and they're like a 10 out of 10

484
00:30:17.401 --> 00:30:19.790
and all these various important things,
but then they're very,

485
00:30:19.791 --> 00:30:24.500
very low on a couple of other maybe a critical factors.
Right.

486
00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:29.890
But they feel like this person is as close to the one true love that I found.

487
00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:34.430
I'm the,
I'm x years of age.
Um,

488
00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:39.090
let's pretend like the kids is not a factor at this point.
Uh,

489
00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:43.490
if I break up with them,
I have to start from scratch.

490
00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:48.030
I just feel like that type of anxiety is very pervasive.
Yeah.

491
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:52.790
Where there's a certain maybe sunk cost fallacy that just,

492
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:55.040
that that goes along with being sort of for a long time.

493
00:30:55.041 --> 00:30:58.310
But if you were sort of advising a friend,

494
00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.620
what would you say to them?
What questions would you have the mass themselves or,

495
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:05.510
or how would you help them get through that?
Because I think it's,

496
00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:09.680
it's easy for people in that situation to feel like they could roll the dice and

497
00:31:09.681 --> 00:31:12.540
go out and continue searching,
but it's like having a,

498
00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:16.650
a revolver that they're playing Russian roulette with where there's,
you know,

499
00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:20.570
a hundred chambers and 99 of them are loaded.
Um,

500
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:25.250
and there's that fear factor so that,
so they don't leave.
Right.
Yeah.
What did,

501
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:28.310
what did what you say and stuff?
Very difficult question,
but,
uh,

502
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.470
I mean it's not an uncommon situation.

503
00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.390
W W what might you say to someone like that?

504
00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:33.610
<v 3>Yeah,
I mean it's really hard.</v>

505
00:31:33.611 --> 00:31:37.360
I don't think that we are very good at giving advice in those situations because

506
00:31:37.361 --> 00:31:41.080
we know people who have chosen to get married for a number of different reasons

507
00:31:41.081 --> 00:31:45.340
and there's more than one reason that works for people.
So I guess,

508
00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:49.450
I guess my question to that would be what?
What is it that you want?
Yeah.
Why?

509
00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.010
Like why would you want to get married?

510
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.040
And if your answer is that you want someone to grow old with that,

511
00:31:54.041 --> 00:31:59.010
you want someone to have children with that you really value the familial bonds.

512
00:31:59.150 --> 00:31:59.983
Yeah.

513
00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.850
It may not be that smart to just continue to wander the world and look for your

514
00:32:03.851 --> 00:32:07.360
other half because you're not guaranteed to find your other half and you might

515
00:32:07.361 --> 00:32:11.280
get to a place where you feel like,
wow,
now I'm too old to kids.
Now you know,
I'm,

516
00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.110
I'm not,
I don't have what I want.
But if,
I guess if you,

517
00:32:14.111 --> 00:32:17.830
if what you want is this,
if it's more about the passion,

518
00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:21.970
then I think you have to be extra careful about what you're getting into.
Yeah.

519
00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:27.250
<v 4>Oh.
So we run this experiment,
I'd say at least two weekends a month.</v>

520
00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:31.700
My brother is single and my brother,
uh,

521
00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:34.740
meets a lot of wonderful women and uh,

522
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.350
he's just never found someone that he wants to marry.

523
00:32:38.351 --> 00:32:43.240
And he asks essentially exactly what you just asked,
how old he is?

524
00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.790
41 now?
Yeah.
Two years younger than me.

525
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:49.460
And um,

526
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.380
<v 5>yeah.</v>

527
00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.460
<v 4>So he asks us this and we say the same thing to him.</v>

528
00:32:54.461 --> 00:32:58.780
Every time there's a prism and there's a presumption is a presumption buried in

529
00:32:58.781 --> 00:33:02.570
here.
He's actually incredibly,
incredibly bright.
Well,

530
00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:06.300
this is stupid.
This is a hard question.
Um,

531
00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:09.880
but what we tell him is,
for God's sakes,

532
00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:15.440
if you don't have to be with them,
don't be with them.
Right?

533
00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:18.850
Not only gonna get married,
but probably don't even date them,
like move on.

534
00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:24.450
But hidden in that statement is an understanding that we have about him in

535
00:33:26.201 --> 00:33:30.070
particular,
that we believe that he's wired the way we happen to be wired.

536
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:35.170
That is that he has it in him to feel the thing that we feel.
We,

537
00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:35.710
I think,

538
00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:40.710
I believe he does and that he will be unhappy.

539
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:46.390
I believe he will be unhappy if he settles,
which as Daniel pointed out,

540
00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:48.190
that is not true for everybody.

541
00:33:48.191 --> 00:33:50.560
That's not necessarily the top of everybody's list,

542
00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:55.510
but because we believe it's at the top of his list having something that is

543
00:33:55.511 --> 00:33:59.020
qualitatively better than anything he's experienced before,

544
00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:02.920
what we tell him is if you don't have to be with them,

545
00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:06.460
you probably have to not be with them.
Right.

546
00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:09.820
And that's not a checklist when you get to the place where you have to be with

547
00:34:09.821 --> 00:34:13.560
someone.
There's no like there are nine out of 10 are there.
It's just,

548
00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:14.990
it's different.
Yeah.

549
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:19.550
<v 2>What,
no,
of the marriages that,
uh,</v>

550
00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:21.760
you both have observed where

551
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:25.790
<v 4>the couples would,
uh,</v>

552
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:27.310
<v 5>yeah,</v>

553
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:31.450
<v 2>honestly say they are happy,
right?
They're not,
they're not putting on a show.</v>

554
00:34:31.451 --> 00:34:32.284
They're not acting.

555
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.360
<v 5>Okay.</v>

556
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.360
<v 2>What were the reasons they decided to get married?
Right.</v>

557
00:34:36.361 --> 00:34:40.290
So if the outcomes are highly dependent on sort of the reasons for getting

558
00:34:40.291 --> 00:34:41.550
married in the first place,

559
00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:45.630
what are the reasons that tend to have better outcomes than others?

560
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:47.660
<v 5>Okay.</v>

561
00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.960
<v 3>I think it's when the couple of the lines in their reasons.</v>

562
00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:56.450
So I do know couples who have gotten married really to have children.

563
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:59.080
I mean it's not that they didn't love each other,
but it,
yeah,

564
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:03.700
<v 2>a lot of people it's,
it's,
it's accelerated or the decision is made for that,</v>

565
00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:04.050
<v 3>right?</v>

566
00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:06.970
So they might not have ended up together except that having children was what

567
00:35:06.971 --> 00:35:11.140
they wanted and they love being parents and they love their families.

568
00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:14.110
They just love being part of the family.
It's like,
I think that that can work.

569
00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:18.250
But you know,
the one thing I,
I feel,
this is just my opinion,

570
00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:20.740
when I see people who are happily married,

571
00:35:20.741 --> 00:35:25.741
I remember one time sitting around the Thanksgiving table and my brother and his

572
00:35:26.111 --> 00:35:28.900
wife were there and he described looking at his life.

573
00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:31.690
He'd been with her for 10 years,

574
00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:35.600
married for five years or something like that.
And,

575
00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:39.270
and he described looking her and thinking,
that's my girl.

576
00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:44.430
And I just said like that feeling that you have of like and just I'm so happy

577
00:35:44.431 --> 00:35:48.240
that I'm with that person and just I admire that person and I'm proud of this

578
00:35:48.241 --> 00:35:51.630
person's my spouse.
I just love being with that person.

579
00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:56.430
That is one of the qualities I think that I see in the happiest marriages.

580
00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.740
<v 4>What asked her,
what are the,</v>

581
00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:02.960
I think you and I have some similar DNA.

582
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:04.970
I mean beyond,

583
00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:08.030
beyond the fact that a lot of humans it will have that similar DNA,

584
00:36:08.031 --> 00:36:12.640
but the 90 like 90% is the same direction.

585
00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:17.660
That's pretty close.
I'm feeling really close to the right now.

586
00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.070
What are the,

587
00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:25.820
what are the most common mistakes that you've observed that sort of type a

588
00:36:25.821 --> 00:36:30.821
personality driven guys make when it comes to these big relationship decisions?

589
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:38.470
I don't know if this is going to be a list of the things you know in proper

590
00:36:40.911 --> 00:36:45.150
order that are a problem,
but I'll tell you a story.
I like stories,
right?

591
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:50.710
I have a friend who had become single and had moved to a new city and it was

592
00:36:55.491 --> 00:36:57.650
just he,
he's a good looking guy.

593
00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:01.760
He's in his late thirties and he was just having a hard time kind of getting

594
00:37:01.761 --> 00:37:05.630
back into the swing of being single.

595
00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:11.150
And he went from that to discovering Tinder in this case.

596
00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:15.080
And once he got on Tinder,

597
00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:20.110
he went from almost not seeing anybody too exhausting himself and with how many

598
00:37:21.261 --> 00:37:22.760
people that he was seeing,

599
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:26.900
he described it almost like being able to just select the attributes that you

600
00:37:26.901 --> 00:37:27.321
wanted,

601
00:37:27.321 --> 00:37:31.220
like ordering a pizza and then the girl would appear almost literally at his

602
00:37:31.221 --> 00:37:32.054
doorstep.

603
00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:36.530
And the thing that I thought was interesting about this was that he said after

604
00:37:36.531 --> 00:37:41.531
he had ordered a good 30 of women who happen to fall into a particular category,

605
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:45.080
they were blonde.
There were six years younger than him,

606
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:47.360
they'd all gone to Stanford,
you know,

607
00:37:47.361 --> 00:37:51.740
technical that he had the set of things that he was positive where his type.

608
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:57.200
And he said,
now that I've been with like 30 of those women I've discovered,

609
00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:58.490
that's not my type.

610
00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:04.490
And I think that that's probably more typical than not.

611
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:08.750
And he just discovered it a lot faster than many people do.

612
00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:14.200
But the types that we think we have come from the movies come from,

613
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:22.340
who knows what our parents said to us we were supposed to be with from our own

614
00:38:22.341 --> 00:38:24.140
insecurities and hangups.

615
00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:28.100
And those things aren't going to make us happy.

616
00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:32.400
So those can't actually be the checklist.
But if you don't use,
I don't,

617
00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.580
I'm not picking on Tinder,
but if you don't use Tinder,

618
00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:38.080
it could take you decades to find that out instead of months.
Right,
right.

619
00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:43.140
Because it could take you several hundred experiences to really verify that it's

620
00:38:43.331 --> 00:38:46.720
not just her or her or her or him or him or him.

621
00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.450
It's actually that you were misguided,

622
00:38:49.451 --> 00:38:53.860
that you had the wrong sense of where people would resonate with you.

623
00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:58.870
So a lot of type a people think that a type a person is who they have to be

624
00:38:58.871 --> 00:39:02.020
with.
Danielle is a introvert.

625
00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:06.940
I'm an extrovert and I dunno,
I've never had a checklist,

626
00:39:06.941 --> 00:39:11.920
but I wouldn't have probably written introvert on some checklist of mine.

627
00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:17.260
But really loving somebody is about throwing the checklist out the window.

628
00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:21.610
And so thank goodness I wasn't like trying to satisfy some checklist because I

629
00:39:21.611 --> 00:39:24.280
don't,
I'm not sure introvert would have like made the list for me,

630
00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:28.210
but that doesn't make us incompatible.
It's,
I had a,

631
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:32.200
I would have had a bad list if I had been making a list.
How did you,

632
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:33.430
how did you first meet?

633
00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:38.940
<v 3>Uh,
we met in 2001 in Pittsburgh.</v>

634
00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:43.590
I had just moved there and I had just gotten home putting it together.
All right.

635
00:39:43.591 --> 00:39:46.890
The Carnegie Mellon and connection,
right.
Yeah.
So,

636
00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:51.360
so I had just gotten married and my husband was still in Boston and I needed to

637
00:39:51.361 --> 00:39:54.750
find a place to live and I was uncertain as to whether I'd be able to stay.

638
00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:58.650
My mentor had just moved from Yale where I had started my training.

639
00:39:58.651 --> 00:40:01.860
I still wasn't quite finished and I mentored,
moved to University of Pittsburgh.

640
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.230
And so I either had to find myself a new science,

641
00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:08.760
science mentor and start all over with a different project or move to
Pittsburgh.

642
00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:10.530
But as a Canadian,

643
00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:14.940
I didn't have a visa that was going to allow me to remain in the u s
necessarily.

644
00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:18.780
Yeah.
And so I needed to find,
I need to get a waiver,

645
00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:22.920
so I need to find a way to be able to stay.
So I was looking for a rental.

646
00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:24.600
I couldn't buy it.
And in Pittsburgh,

647
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:28.290
the housing costs are so low that nobody ran success students.

648
00:40:28.291 --> 00:40:30.810
And so every place I looked at,
it's just the smell,
the fear,

649
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:34.740
SARS are all crooked.
And it was just,
it was sort of,

650
00:40:34.741 --> 00:40:36.840
it was ridiculously hard to find a rental.

651
00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:42.060
And then I found on the web a rental,
this cute little house,

652
00:40:42.061 --> 00:40:45.840
this guy who was going to Stanford for a sabbatical,

653
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:47.370
a professor at Carnegie Mellon.

654
00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:52.500
And so I went to look at the house and it turned out it belonged to Sebastian

655
00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:56.900
Thrun,
who is a good friend of Astros.
And so I walked in the house,
I was like,

656
00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:59.460
I'll take the house.
And he said,
don't you want to know anything about it?

657
00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.490
You want to know like what the heating bill is or anything.
I was like,
no,

658
00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.770
I'll take the house because I just,

659
00:41:04.771 --> 00:41:08.270
I was so desperate for a place and it was really nice place because anyway,

660
00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.860
we hit it off.
We had a fun conversation and he said,
well,
you know what,

661
00:41:10.861 --> 00:41:13.170
we're leaving to move to California,

662
00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:18.350
but why don't you guys come over for dinner the weekend before it really leaves.

663
00:41:18.351 --> 00:41:20.010
So my husband was back in town,

664
00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:24.300
we went to Sebastian's for dinner and the only other guests were astro and his

665
00:41:24.301 --> 00:41:26.670
then wife,
Zoe.
And we just,

666
00:41:26.671 --> 00:41:29.490
we hit it off and our families became friends.

667
00:41:29.491 --> 00:41:31.290
So we were friends for a long time.

668
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:36.920
<v 2>So this is,
um,</v>

669
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:41.600
so many questions I want to ask you guys and it's been very sort of fascinating

670
00:41:41.601 --> 00:41:41.731
and,

671
00:41:41.731 --> 00:41:46.731
and a comically tragic to watch my own monkey mind at work in the last say five

672
00:41:47.691 --> 00:41:50.330
years,
just as like more and more friends are getting married,

673
00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:55.290
more and more friends who are having kids,
uh,
you know,

674
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:56.450
that you're like,
well,

675
00:41:56.451 --> 00:41:59.750
maybe someday I'll have grandkids kind of comments or maybe it's more frequent

676
00:41:59.751 --> 00:42:02.960
than they used to be.
And,
uh,

677
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:04.790
the anxiety that's produced.

678
00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:09.440
And what I've realized is one of my big fears is,
uh,

679
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:11.930
and,
and this is probably right.
I mean,

680
00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:15.140
I think a lot of what's addressed in sick cows,

681
00:42:15.141 --> 00:42:19.850
but is I don't want to lose,
I don't want to do a bad job.

682
00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:24.470
And so I don't,
if I think I'm going to do a bad job,

683
00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:26.450
I don't sign up for the job.

684
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:28.880
Does that make sense of what counts as losing for you?

685
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:32.720
Is it a bad marriage or not?
Or failing to get married?
I'm not telling you.

686
00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:35.270
So here's,
here's a very granular concern.
So when I was thinking,

687
00:42:35.271 --> 00:42:37.150
when I was listening to your story about your,

688
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:42.010
your friend and Tinder and how he had the one on 30 days,

689
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:44.800
you know,
whatever,
but like,
you know,

690
00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:49.270
28 year old Stanford Grad technical women,
and he's like,
ah,

691
00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:53.300
I don't think they're my type part of me and call me cynical.
But you could read,

692
00:42:53.301 --> 00:42:57.230
you know,
sex at dawn or just look at monkeys if you want.

693
00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.890
And I'm just like,
maybe he just got bored.

694
00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:03.350
Maybe he had exhausted,

695
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:06.680
maybe he's looking for novelty after that point.

696
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:11.710
And that's a fear that I have in so much as I've been very good at,

697
00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:16.590
uh,
monogamy.
I've never cheated on a girlfriend.
And,
um,

698
00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:19.610
but I find after a certain period of time,
I kind of have to,

699
00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.970
I have to put a part of my,
uh,

700
00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:28.080
a lot part of my psyche and be like a straight jacket to make it work.
And,
um,

701
00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:31.660
it affects my mood and behavior and everything else.

702
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:37.470
And so I've never had an issue up to say several years of dating someone,

703
00:43:37.931 --> 00:43:38.410
but I,

704
00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:43.410
I fear my fear is that I marry someone and then x number of years into it,

705
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:47.710
who knows?
Five,
six,
seven,
eight,
nine,
10,
whatever it might be.

706
00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:52.660
I cheat or that need,
I could call it,

707
00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:56.220
call it a want,
but I feel like it's very much hard wiring,
uh,

708
00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:57.310
screws everything up.

709
00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:59.850
And it's like we have kids and then the whole thing explodes.
Um,

710
00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.610
how do you encourage someone to think about that?
Because I honestly,

711
00:44:03.611 --> 00:44:06.160
this is something I really struggle with because I don't want to be a bastard.

712
00:44:06.161 --> 00:44:06.994
I don't want to lie.

713
00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:11.950
I don't want to sign up for something that is a doomed mission from the start.

714
00:44:11.951 --> 00:44:14.230
How do you think about this stuff?
I,
I'm so

715
00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:18.560
<v 6>boo Trump like troubled by this.
I don't even know where to start.</v>

716
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:23.750
It's a big question.
Well,
I think if you will

717
00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:25.370
<v 2>to get married to me.</v>

718
00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:29.090
I would hope that you would bring this up with me before we got married.
Right,

719
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:30.950
right.
And Are you proposing

720
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:37.950
<v 0>mission accomplished</v>

721
00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:44.490
wife number two?
Oh yeah,
no,
no.

722
00:44:44.491 --> 00:44:48.970
This is a very like kind of situation ever to know.

723
00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:56.690
<v 4>Where are your lady friend and we were considering getting married.</v>

724
00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:02.070
I would at the very least want you to talk to me about this.
Yeah,
no,

725
00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:03.920
that might be a deal killer for me.

726
00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:06.830
But if this is something you're really worried about and you talk to me about it

727
00:45:06.831 --> 00:45:09.200
and then I say,
look,
deal killer,
you know,

728
00:45:09.201 --> 00:45:11.150
that's probably not the right person for you to marry.

729
00:45:11.151 --> 00:45:14.060
So there's some good self selection going on there.
Yeah,

730
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:20.150
I can't promise,
but I don't think we're the only ones who feel like this.
Yeah.

731
00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:24.350
If you're worried about that,
wait until you don't feel like that anymore.

732
00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:29.680
Because I think we both feel that that's not an issue for us.

733
00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:35.590
Not because we are sexual beings and have desires and you know,

734
00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.480
it's not like we don't crave novelty generally,

735
00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:43.690
but I don't think either of us has like a pressure to leave our marriage to seek

736
00:45:44.961 --> 00:45:46.840
out more novelty and,
yeah.

737
00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:48.350
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

738
00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:51.290
<v 4>I think it's possible for many people.</v>

739
00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:55.790
I bet possible for you to feel like that and maybe that's just part of your body

740
00:45:55.791 --> 00:45:59.000
telling you and you were not ready to get married or you haven't found the right

741
00:45:59.001 --> 00:46:00.470
person to get married too.
Yeah.

742
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:07.170
<v 2>Entirely possible.
Yeah.
It's,
it's,
um,
it's,
it's,</v>

743
00:46:07.171 --> 00:46:09.480
uh,
it seems to be a very,

744
00:46:09.481 --> 00:46:13.780
a perennial challenge for a lot of people,
not just men.

745
00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:18.540
I think just men just coming back to the sort of societal framework within this

746
00:46:18.541 --> 00:46:20.550
operating.
It's just more accepted,

747
00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:25.610
I think for men to talk about it or to lament it.
But,
um,

748
00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:30.090
let's shift gears just a little bit.
So when,
when you guys have a conflict,

749
00:46:30.091 --> 00:46:33.270
I'm very curious,
is there,

750
00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:37.530
what have you guys found to be the most effective way of resolving conflict?

751
00:46:37.531 --> 00:46:42.360
Because I think a lot of the relationship problems that end relationships

752
00:46:42.361 --> 00:46:44.640
ultimately could probably not probably,

753
00:46:44.641 --> 00:46:49.641
but a lot of them could be a virgin if people just managed conflict better or

754
00:46:50.851 --> 00:46:53.700
set expectations in the way that you were talking about since you know,

755
00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:58.130
meeting with number two and everything.
Uh,
so how do you,

756
00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:02.550
how,
how do you guys think of conflict resolution with a significant other?

757
00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:06.150
<v 0>I want her to talk first because I don't want to get yelled at</v>

758
00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:11.760
because I'm the boss.
There's no conflict

759
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:16.210
or else,
yeah,
it's an iron fist.

760
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:19.350
As soon as you see any of match it with an iron fist,

761
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:23.620
I think that

762
00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:26.670
<v 4>there's,
uh,
there are a lot of books written about this,</v>

763
00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:30.110
so I don't think anything that I could say would,
um,

764
00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.440
<v 3>wouldn't be novel.</v>

765
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.140
I think if you have basic respect and love for the other person,

766
00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:44.350
then you're not going to allow your conflict to escalate to the point where

767
00:47:44.351 --> 00:47:47.890
you're hurting the other person's feelings.
So you're not going to be,
I mean,

768
00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:52.330
if you read a book about how to keep your marriage together or how to not have

769
00:47:52.331 --> 00:47:55.120
such bad conflict,
they'll tell you things like,
be respectful,

770
00:47:55.121 --> 00:47:56.340
don't call each other names.
You know,

771
00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:59.970
that's sort of the basis and visited things we learned in kindergarten.
Um,
and,

772
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:02.320
and when you're in a relationship that's a loving relationship,

773
00:48:02.321 --> 00:48:06.820
I think that you often don't do those things because causing pain to the other

774
00:48:06.821 --> 00:48:10.340
person causes you pain yourself.
Um,

775
00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:16.200
I think that we try to be as rational as we can.

776
00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:19.600
I think that helps both of us,
but that's just a style thing.

777
00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:21.790
But there are people for him that doesn't work,
you know,

778
00:48:21.791 --> 00:48:24.250
just like everyone has different coping mechanisms.

779
00:48:24.251 --> 00:48:27.910
Like Freud had all these different mechanisms for how people cope with various

780
00:48:27.911 --> 00:48:30.100
psychological disturbances.
We have our,

781
00:48:30.101 --> 00:48:33.370
like our waste intellectualize everything,
but that just,
that works for us.

782
00:48:33.371 --> 00:48:36.550
That's not for every couple,
but,
but I,
I think that's good.

783
00:48:36.551 --> 00:48:40.000
And then I think the other thing is we agree to disagree about some stuff.

784
00:48:40.001 --> 00:48:42.790
We don't always come to a place where we were both like,
Yep,

785
00:48:42.791 --> 00:48:45.730
I totally get your perspective.
I totally agree with you,

786
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:51.030
but we can respect the fact that we don't always completely share the other

787
00:48:51.791 --> 00:48:53.230
person's opinion and that's okay.

788
00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:55.130
<v 4>I would say I agree.</v>

789
00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:59.270
I know how ridiculous this sounds,

790
00:48:59.271 --> 00:49:04.220
but I think that the conflict resolution in a way that works the best for us,

791
00:49:04.221 --> 00:49:08.900
it was going to sleep
just,
it's so frustrating.

792
00:49:08.901 --> 00:49:10.760
But whenever we have conflict,

793
00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:14.330
if we allow ourselves to sit up and talk about it for four hours,

794
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:16.340
typically the conflict really doesn't go away.

795
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.640
But it doesn't matter if we talk about it for four minutes or four hours.

796
00:49:19.641 --> 00:49:23.560
The conflict,
if anything will get worse.
Typically.
Yeah,
that's right.
Experience.

797
00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:26.660
If we go to sleep the next morning,

798
00:49:26.810 --> 00:49:30.890
we're like lovebirds again and we like can't even reconstruct.

799
00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:36.110
Why were we were linking.
See this is really,
and so,
but we've gotten good at it,

800
00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:39.240
so now we will just say it's sometimes it's hard,
but we,

801
00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:43.070
we are much better than we used to be.
It just saying,
why don't we go to sleep?

802
00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:47.420
We'll talk about it tomorrow and we both understand that that means like we're

803
00:49:47.421 --> 00:49:50.030
being ridiculous.
It's in fuel,
ridiculous.

804
00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:53.840
But we also understand intellectually that we're going to feel different the

805
00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.350
next morning and then we run the experiment and sure enough the next morning we

806
00:49:57.351 --> 00:49:59.210
don't want to fight it better than anymore.
No,

807
00:49:59.211 --> 00:50:01.220
I like this advice because it's simple,

808
00:50:01.221 --> 00:50:06.221
but it's also a runs counter to what you are told a lot in relationship advice

809
00:50:06.891 --> 00:50:08.360
books,
which is never go to bed angry.

810
00:50:08.361 --> 00:50:10.980
Like you have to resolve it for you to sleep.
In my experiences,

811
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.580
you were just like,
all right,
the only thing that was just accomplish this,

812
00:50:13.581 --> 00:50:18.500
we took something that was like nonsense and to humans being stupid from four

813
00:50:18.501 --> 00:50:20.960
minutes to four hours and now we're just not going to get any sleep and we're

814
00:50:20.961 --> 00:50:25.960
going to be bitchy and,
but I'll be tomorrow.
How much point to that?
Okay.
Um,

815
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:28.010
what other,
what?
Uh,

816
00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:28.850
<v 3>okay,</v>

817
00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:33.850
<v 2>so rituals or routines or habits that you guys have that you think help the</v>

818
00:50:35.891 --> 00:50:37.780
relationship?
We're help the family.

819
00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:42.420
<v 3>We have a lot of rituals in our relationship.</v>

820
00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:44.250
And so those have just brown and multiply.

821
00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:48.060
We joke that eventually our whole day is just going to be a 24 hour Mitchell.

822
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:50.930
We built all these rituals,
entire lesson,

823
00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:55.020
but the rituals are really wonderful and they help to preserve our sanity when

824
00:50:55.021 --> 00:50:59.850
things are crazy.
I mean we have four kids,
we've each got two.
So it's a,
it's,

825
00:50:59.851 --> 00:51:04.020
there's a lot of chaos in times,
but having our rituals where,
you know,

826
00:51:04.021 --> 00:51:07.920
after work,
as long as the sun is still up,
we have,

827
00:51:07.921 --> 00:51:09.540
we carve out a period of time,

828
00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:13.110
even when the kids are there to go and sit in the pap sign in our backyard and

829
00:51:13.111 --> 00:51:14.120
we have our special drink.

830
00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.850
<v 2>Usually the pumper some,
yeah,
I'm putting a hyphen in there.</v>

831
00:51:17.851 --> 00:51:19.730
Like what's a fuck?

832
00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:25.730
It's a chair at bamboo frame with a big cushion in it.
Oh,
sounds great.
Yeah.
Okay.

833
00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:29.190
That's comfy.
So we will do that.
And then we have,

834
00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:31.620
we have a morning routine where we have our monogamy.

835
00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:33.420
This is where you have your monogamy,

836
00:51:33.421 --> 00:51:36.380
which is a nickname for explaining the drink.
I love this.
Okay.

837
00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:41.100
<v 4>It is a Rosemary Martini.
How does one make a rosemary murky?</v>

838
00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:46.100
So it's not a secret.
We're,
uh,
we only drink it when we're together,

839
00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:49.040
but we're very happy to push it on other people though typically other people

840
00:51:49.041 --> 00:51:49.874
don't enjoy it.
Yeah.

841
00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:50.890
<v 2>But one of the jokes about</v>

842
00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:54.890
it seems like we're the only two people that actually like it,

843
00:51:56.740 --> 00:52:00.400
<v 4>but the,
the recipe,
the recipe is three parts.</v>

844
00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:02.230
Rosemary infused vodka,

845
00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:07.240
two parts vanilla infused cognac and one part lemon juice.

846
00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:10.810
And there's some sweetness from the vanilla.

847
00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:14.990
And then there's the tartness from the lemon juice and the,
uh,
a,

848
00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:19.400
uh,
sort of pungent newness of the Rosemary and the,

849
00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:22.840
the vodka.
And it's,
it's really wonderful to try that.

850
00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:24.790
And so by infusing relay meters,

851
00:52:24.791 --> 00:52:27.310
taking like a sprig of Rosemary and dropping it in the bottle,
uh,

852
00:52:27.311 --> 00:52:32.311
well we take about 20 sprigs in the bottle and leave it there for 24 hours till

853
00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.710
it's really rose married.

854
00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:35.810
<v 3>Okay.</v>

855
00:52:35.810 --> 00:52:37.510
<v 2>So I like this.
I like this.
This is,</v>

856
00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:38.301
<v 3>so that's one ritual.</v>

857
00:52:38.301 --> 00:52:42.380
And then we have a morning ritual where astro always wakes up earlier than I do.

858
00:52:42.381 --> 00:52:44.990
And he goes and makes coffee and then he waits till evening.

859
00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:49.270
Same Waking up and he brings the coffee to bed.

860
00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:53.600
<v 4>That's it.
That's us sitting in the Papasan and waking dream and not right.</v>

861
00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:59.850
<v 2>Oh Man.
That's a great ritual in the morning.</v>

862
00:52:59.950 --> 00:53:04.110
So he wakes up earlier and when he thinks that you're not going to throw a book

863
00:53:04.170 --> 00:53:07.040
at right.
I would.
I'm pro boxing course of books.

864
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:13.620
Ninjastars bottling or more about the Baltimore.
Right.

865
00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:16.080
So he'll come and he'll wake you home.

866
00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:21.330
<v 3>Yeah.
And then we have our time in bed where we just snuggled in Jakarta,</v>

867
00:53:21.350 --> 00:53:25.060
coffee and that's also sort of sacrosanct time and the kids are,

868
00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:27.300
and they're doing their thing,
but we just,

869
00:53:27.301 --> 00:53:30.990
we carve out that time so that we're in our little bubble and we start our day

870
00:53:30.991 --> 00:53:35.991
out just by being just the two of us and having this calm moment.

871
00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:38.930
<v 2>And this is the,
now this is before the kids get up?</v>

872
00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:42.500
<v 3>No,
they're,
they're,
they're up in,
through getting themselves ready.</v>

873
00:53:42.501 --> 00:53:47.290
I mean they're older now.
They were 13 1211 and 10 okay.
They're old enough to,

874
00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:47.521
<v 2>yeah.</v>

875
00:53:47.521 --> 00:53:50.700
Then advantage she is necessarily now and they don't need us to do everything

876
00:53:50.701 --> 00:53:55.300
for them.
For self organizing bench.
I let know when,

877
00:53:55.301 --> 00:53:59.630
when the kids were younger in both cases.
I'd be interested to hear,
uh,

878
00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:04.770
so we were chatting before we started recording about,
uh,
this,

879
00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:09.480
this article that was written sometime ago by,
I'm blanking on the author's name.

880
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:14.130
Uh,
what was that?
I wallet.
I think so,
yeah.

881
00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:17.310
About how she loved her.
She was mad.
She,

882
00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:19.170
and I'm paraphrasing here,

883
00:54:19.171 --> 00:54:24.171
but prioritized her husband over it gets or loved her husband more than her kids

884
00:54:24.631 --> 00:54:28.560
or something like that.
Um,
what I'm curious to know is,

885
00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:31.070
<v 0>okay,</v>

886
00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:35.430
<v 2>what,
what,
what have you found the balance to be in terms of,
uh,</v>

887
00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:41.430
when handling conflict resolution or anything else?
Uh,

888
00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:46.140
siding with the spouse or the kids or the kids over the spouse.
I think that,

889
00:54:46.141 --> 00:54:50.700
like you said,
ask her earlier about the expectations being clear.

890
00:54:50.701 --> 00:54:52.970
I was very fascinated when I was in college.

891
00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:56.310
Took a year off of college for a whole lot of reasons we can talk about another

892
00:54:56.311 --> 00:54:57.540
time.
Uh,

893
00:54:57.541 --> 00:55:02.541
I was on the extended plan and I lived with this fascinating Mormon guy who is

894
00:55:03.931 --> 00:55:05.430
very high up at Unilever.

895
00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:10.380
And he said that part of the reason he felt his family had a very low degree of

896
00:55:10.381 --> 00:55:12.750
conflict is that he,

897
00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:16.210
his wife was always prioritized over his kids.
Hmm.

898
00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:18.060
So they couldn't be divided.

899
00:55:18.061 --> 00:55:22.050
And so it made conflict resolution much easier.

900
00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.480
And I'm not saying that's the answer,
but it was,

901
00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:26.550
it was thought provoking enough to a college kid.

902
00:55:26.551 --> 00:55:29.370
It really wasn't thinking about marriage and all to stick with me.

903
00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:34.610
So I'm curious sort of how you think about managing the spouse or significant

904
00:55:35.521 --> 00:55:37.230
other relationship with the kid relationship.

905
00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:40.220
<v 3>I don't think it has to be about love.
I mean,</v>

906
00:55:40.221 --> 00:55:44.210
I don't think there's anything wrong with loving your husband more than your

907
00:55:44.211 --> 00:55:47.090
kids are loving your kids more than your husband.
I mean,
I,

908
00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:49.610
I wouldn't cast judgment on anyone for how they love.

909
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:53.630
I think love is just what it is that it happens.
It's not something we control.

910
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:58.880
But I think that being a team is absolutely necessary.

911
00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:03.590
And I think this is the message that we always try to give to the kids,

912
00:56:03.591 --> 00:56:07.940
which is that where we're on the same team and they're on the same team and that

913
00:56:07.941 --> 00:56:12.480
may seem like we're sending things out to be a little more at home,
but,

914
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:16.910
but I think it works because they band together more and they don't try to

915
00:56:16.911 --> 00:56:21.410
divide and conquer the US because they know that we will refuse to allow them to

916
00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:23.740
demand us.
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh,
totally.

917
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.500
<v 4>Yeah.
We're playing two men down as it is.</v>

918
00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:31.610
If we allowed any opportunity,
you know,
it's,
we're like,
you know,

919
00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:34.120
fighting back to back like Batman and Robin,

920
00:56:35.050 --> 00:56:38.230
if they could separate us and like take one of us down and then come get the

921
00:56:38.231 --> 00:56:42.140
other one we do,
we'd never survive.
Came over.
Uh,

922
00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:45.910
what is,
what is some of the worst advice do you,

923
00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:50.310
that you think people are routinely given about it?
Relationships.

924
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:53.550
And that could be marriage,
but just,
I'll keep it broad.

925
00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:58.610
Just about really significant other type relationships.

926
00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:04.230
Well,
here's one of the ones that bothers me a lot.
Um,

927
00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:08.070
we refer to it as the defective cow.
And in the book,

928
00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:11.910
which is there's a strong social narrative,

929
00:57:11.911 --> 00:57:16.911
it's one of these other boogie men in our society that if you are married and

930
00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:22.970
you are in an unhappy marriage and you're getting anywhere close to thinking of

931
00:57:23.971 --> 00:57:27.600
leaving,
you are not just a bad person.
Like,
oh,

932
00:57:27.601 --> 00:57:29.940
I'll get back to how bad a person you are in a minute.

933
00:57:30.090 --> 00:57:32.160
But you're also a broken person.

934
00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:37.320
You are a defective person because you got married to them.
So obviously,

935
00:57:37.321 --> 00:57:40.410
cause I mean it's,
it would be even worse if you were a liar.

936
00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:44.250
You at some point loved them.
So you've lost your way.

937
00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:46.620
So you were hole.

938
00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:51.240
Now you're broken and it is your job to mend yourself and we'll know that you're

939
00:57:51.241 --> 00:57:51.780
mended.

940
00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:55.110
We'll know that you're no longer a broken human being when you love your spouse

941
00:57:55.111 --> 00:57:55.944
again.

942
00:57:56.070 --> 00:58:00.360
And this narrative is incredibly strong in our society and confuses people very

943
00:58:00.361 --> 00:58:04.590
badly because not for all of them,
but for some of them the answer might be,

944
00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:09.900
actually,
I'm not broken.
I'm just not love in love with my spouse anymore.
Yeah.

945
00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:15.660
But if you don't allow that to be one of the possible explanations for why

946
00:58:15.690 --> 00:58:17.520
you're having a hard time in your marriage,

947
00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:21.360
if the only possible explanation is that you're a broken human being,

948
00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:26.190
people spend a lot of time being very unhappy at themselves and trying

949
00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:30.870
completely few to fix themselves when the problem is in fact,

950
00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:33.390
not that they're a bad person,
that they're not trying hard enough,

951
00:58:33.391 --> 00:58:36.600
all the things that they go to their therapist and say.
So

952
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:38.421
<v 3>I mean love,</v>

953
00:58:38.421 --> 00:58:41.930
I mean love is that it encompasses desire as well because this is probably even

954
00:58:41.931 --> 00:58:45.650
more common with sexual desire than it does with love because I think a lot of

955
00:58:45.651 --> 00:58:49.610
people still really do love their spouses but are not sexually attracted to
them.

956
00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:49.910
Right.

957
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:53.930
And this idea of focusing on like what is wrong with you that you lack any sort

958
00:58:53.931 --> 00:58:55.550
of libido is,

959
00:58:55.610 --> 00:58:59.540
I mean some people do have medical reasons or psychological reasons for why they

960
00:58:59.570 --> 00:59:03.710
may have enough normal desire for sex.
Yeah.
But we don't as a society,

961
00:59:03.711 --> 00:59:07.220
spend enough time talking about the fact that sometimes it's about the

962
00:59:07.221 --> 00:59:10.160
relationship,
you know,
it might be that if you were with a different person,

963
00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:12.710
and maybe it's a novelty thing is you were talking about before.

964
00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:14.000
I mean there are other issues,

965
00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:17.780
but we're so afraid as a society of coming close to that because that is

966
00:59:17.781 --> 00:59:22.360
threatened because that might mean that,
well,
we can't be married if,
you know,

967
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:25.850
if the problem is not you,
if it's not your libido that's gotta be fixed.

968
00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:30.290
It must be that our relationship has isn't working and maybe one of the

969
00:59:30.291 --> 00:59:32.640
solutions is you need to be with someone else then that,

970
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:34.550
and that's not something we want to talk about.

971
00:59:34.551 --> 00:59:37.930
But I think it does cause a lot of pain and confusion for people that were at,

972
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:41.630
we're not willing to at least bring that up.
Like if that may not be the cause,

973
00:59:41.631 --> 00:59:45.350
but the fact that we never bring that up as a potential cause,

974
00:59:45.351 --> 00:59:49.220
and I think it's a lot more common in the cause then we let on is,

975
00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:50.300
I think it's hurting people.

976
00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:54.630
<v 2>Yeah.
Uh,
do you,
do either of,
you know,
any,</v>

977
00:59:55.440 --> 01:00:00.160
uh,
long term single people,
uh,

978
01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:03.540
older than 40,
you would consider to be genuinely happy?

979
01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:07.823
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

980
01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:11.320
<v 2>Okay.
Tell me about them.</v>

981
01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:18.390
Um,
because here's,
I'll give you,
I'll give you,
I'll give you,

982
01:00:18.391 --> 01:00:20.910
I'll give you the time now,
so you can,
I can think of is like,

983
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:25.710
because part of me is like,
you know,
yes,
he just got married,

984
01:00:25.711 --> 01:00:28.260
but like George Clooney had a pretty good run of things.
And it's like,

985
01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:33.280
I wonder if there is,
especially as a male,
I just,
I,
I've,

986
01:00:33.281 --> 01:00:37.310
I felt so much pressure from different corners,
uh,

987
01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:41.850
in the last few years related to marriage.
And I'm like,
is it really so bad?

988
01:00:41.851 --> 01:00:44.940
But like,
I'm pretty happy guy.
Uh,

989
01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:50.220
I would love to be with the,
the,
you know,
the true love of my life,
of course.

990
01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:55.680
Uh,
but if there's any degree of doubt,
it doesn't see,
it's,

991
01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:59.940
I don't want to rule that out as a completely non-viable path,

992
01:00:59.941 --> 01:01:04.490
at least for a period of time.
Uh,
and,
uh,
so I'm,

993
01:01:04.491 --> 01:01:08.940
I'm just very curious to know because now the,
the feedback that I would get,

994
01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:13.290
which is very much kind of this conversation in the book and elsewhere about

995
01:01:13.291 --> 01:01:15.690
Seidel pressure will be like,
well,
like,
that's great.

996
01:01:15.691 --> 01:01:17.610
You can focus on yourself and do this,
this and this.
But like,

997
01:01:17.611 --> 01:01:21.030
that's not true happiness.
And this is like,
well maybe,

998
01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.870
maybe,
uh,
but you know,

999
01:01:24.871 --> 01:01:27.870
maybe you're taking a bunch of baggage and like anger and stuff that you haven't

1000
01:01:27.871 --> 01:01:31.380
been throwing it on me.
Uh,
so,
sure.
Yeah.

1001
01:01:31.381 --> 01:01:35.130
So I'd be curious to hear of sort of any single people,

1002
01:01:35.131 --> 01:01:40.131
male or female who you think are genuinely happy and why you think that's the

1003
01:01:41.371 --> 01:01:45.530
case and it doesn't have to necessarily do it there.
Singlehood um,
but right.

1004
01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.190
You mean specifically single people?

1005
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:48.660
<v 3>Yeah.
Well,
I mean,</v>

1006
01:01:48.661 --> 01:01:52.680
I think that we've lived long enough now to have seen a lot of our friends go

1007
01:01:52.681 --> 01:01:57.230
through various states of singleness,
married,
divorced,
remarried,
this,

1008
01:01:57.630 --> 01:01:58.800
well,
you know,
the,

1009
01:01:58.830 --> 01:02:02.490
we've seen people cycle through these things and I think people are in a way

1010
01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:04.650
their own best control because you,

1011
01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:07.390
people probably have different happiness set points,
you know,

1012
01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:10.620
some people that are probably just more predisposed to being happy than other

1013
01:02:10.621 --> 01:02:11.454
people are.

1014
01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:15.690
And I think what I've gathered just anecdotally from watching friends go through

1015
01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:17.940
various types of relationships and,

1016
01:02:17.941 --> 01:02:21.810
and singlehood is that they're,

1017
01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:22.980
they're kind of,

1018
01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:28.110
there are times when they're very happy as married people or as a couple and

1019
01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:30.780
times where they're very happy as single people and Times where they're very

1020
01:02:30.781 --> 01:02:33.060
unhappy in both situations.

1021
01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:38.330
And I don't think that their overall happiness correlates very well with their

1022
01:02:39.631 --> 01:02:41.580
marital status.
I didn't give,
you sort of grasped it.

1023
01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:45.260
They wouldn't be like a super good correlation to how happy they were.
You know,

1024
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:47.910
when they first got married they were,
there was a lot of happiness.

1025
01:02:47.911 --> 01:02:50.580
And then there were some very dark moments.
And then,
you know,

1026
01:02:50.581 --> 01:02:53.430
after they split up,
they were happy again.
They're just,

1027
01:02:53.530 --> 01:02:58.390
they go through happiness and sadness,
kind of the same,
right.

1028
01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:00.990
As happy as a single or as married people.

1029
01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:06.350
And the people I know who have remained single their whole lives who are now in

1030
01:03:06.871 --> 01:03:11.460
their forties and fifties I think that they,
the reason that they're,

1031
01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:15.240
so the people that who seem unhappy are the people who are obsessed with,

1032
01:03:15.241 --> 01:03:17.250
why aren't I married?
You know,
I should be married.

1033
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:20.550
Society was telling me I should be married.
Should I have had children,
you know,

1034
01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.380
can I still have children?
What's wrong with me?

1035
01:03:22.650 --> 01:03:27.650
But the people I know who adjust have a very strong inner sense of this is how

1036
01:03:27.841 --> 01:03:30.690
I'm meant to be,
you know,
I tried being part of a couple,

1037
01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:34.740
it really isn't my thing.
I just like I,
it just doesn't really work for me.

1038
01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:36.480
They seem as happy to me mean.

1039
01:03:36.481 --> 01:03:39.030
You never know how happy any other person really is.
Sure.

1040
01:03:39.210 --> 01:03:42.150
But they certainly seem as happy to me as any married people I know.

1041
01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:46.430
<v 4>Yeah.
I would also say that I think one of the things that does correlate with</v>

1042
01:03:46.431 --> 01:03:46.841
happiness,

1043
01:03:46.841 --> 01:03:51.841
this is well known to be part of what tends to cause happiness and people is a

1044
01:03:51.921 --> 01:03:54.440
sense of uh,
gratitude,

1045
01:03:54.650 --> 01:03:56.960
a sense of connection to other people.

1046
01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:02.080
And a sense of caring for spending time on thinking about people other than

1047
01:04:03.771 --> 01:04:04.604
yourself.

1048
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:09.050
Now having a family happens to drive all of those things.

1049
01:04:09.290 --> 01:04:13.940
And so there can be sort of happiness benefits of a kind.

1050
01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:18.200
There's lots of stressors also,
but happiness benefits to being part of a family.

1051
01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:22.370
But that doesn't mean that you can't get all of those same benefits as a single

1052
01:04:22.371 --> 01:04:26.120
person.
Right.
And I know for example,
entrepreneurs who,

1053
01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:29.900
who treat their companies like their families,

1054
01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:32.840
and they really care a lot about their companies in it,

1055
01:04:32.841 --> 01:04:34.130
but the people in the company,

1056
01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:36.830
they care about it more than they care about themselves.

1057
01:04:36.831 --> 01:04:39.860
And not just because they're trying to win or make a lot of money,

1058
01:04:39.861 --> 01:04:44.570
but because they're are very purpose driven and they're very community oriented.

1059
01:04:44.571 --> 01:04:48.380
And this is the community that they've created and they they care for.

1060
01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:53.590
And so I've seen people who are single have all of the same benefits that you

1061
01:04:55.161 --> 01:04:58.010
get from having the benefits of having a family.

1062
01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:03.280
So I think it's a sort of false sense that you have to be selfish or an

1063
01:05:03.861 --> 01:05:08.480
egomaniac if you stay single,
that I don't think that's a necessary outcome.

1064
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:13.250
Hmm.
So much perfect.
That is a big,

1065
01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:18.190
big subjects.
I mean there are very few things that really,
really,
really stressed

1066
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:21.370
<v 2>me out these days and it's like this relationship stuff is one of them because I</v>

1067
01:05:21.371 --> 01:05:26.220
think there's,
there's so much subjectivity involved and uh,

1068
01:05:26.221 --> 01:05:29.170
I like to be able to kind of like slice it and dice it and put it on a plate of

1069
01:05:29.171 --> 01:05:33.340
glass and be like,
okay,
here's what we have.
Great.
Okay.
All right.
Fantastic.

1070
01:05:33.341 --> 01:05:34.840
One of our assumptions.
Okay.

1071
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:38.500
And here are like three or four things we can test and great.

1072
01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:39.730
Which is where like Tinder,

1073
01:05:39.731 --> 01:05:43.660
is this potentially valuable where you can spend like three weeks figuring out

1074
01:05:43.661 --> 01:05:47.800
like,
oh,
maybe this isn't my type as opposed to three years,
three decades,
uh,

1075
01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:53.340
what,
uh,
what are the,

1076
01:05:53.341 --> 01:05:58.200
uh,
are the little things that both of you do independently too,

1077
01:05:58.610 --> 01:05:59.790
<v 0>uh,
help</v>

1078
01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:05.510
<v 2>happiness or wellbeing?
So not,
not a routine with the other person,</v>

1079
01:06:05.511 --> 01:06:10.511
but things that you guys do separately or individually that help you maintain an

1080
01:06:11.391 --> 01:06:14.300
even keeled sense of wellbeing?

1081
01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:20.830
<v 4>Well,
exercise think that's a pretty interesting answer,
but no,</v>

1082
01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:25.220
I like the real answers.
Not that
exercise is the answer,

1083
01:06:25.221 --> 01:06:28.010
but we do a lot of exercise together.

1084
01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:31.700
So it happens to be that if you separated us for a year,

1085
01:06:31.701 --> 01:06:33.530
we would both keep exercising.

1086
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:36.710
It is also the case that whenever we can,

1087
01:06:36.711 --> 01:06:39.230
we exercise together and it's one of our favorite things to do.

1088
01:06:39.231 --> 01:06:41.680
It's one of our rituals.
And that's

1089
01:06:41.790 --> 01:06:46.070
<v 2>uh,
running or what other types of running,
running primary,
yeah.</v>

1090
01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.420
Do you talk or do you just run it?

1091
01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.950
<v 4>We usually talk.
Sometimes we just run,</v>

1092
01:06:52.030 --> 01:06:56.340
but I've always felt like exercises that the cure for everything.
Like,

1093
01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:59.820
yeah,
no,
I agree.
My lawyer,

1094
01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:04.890
my favorite form of our talking when we run is she listens to more podcasts than

1095
01:07:05.081 --> 01:07:07.540
I have time to listen to.
And she'll do,

1096
01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:11.050
she'll narrate podcasts like this one.

1097
01:07:11.051 --> 01:07:15.820
She'll hear something that she really loves and then in an hour long jog,

1098
01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:19.780
she will narrate,
I think often better than the podcast itself,

1099
01:07:19.781 --> 01:07:21.820
which sometimes you later plays for me.

1100
01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:26.110
Almost like a thought for thought everything in the podcast.

1101
01:07:26.111 --> 01:07:29.700
It's a particularly fun way for us to spend our time listen to the radio.

1102
01:07:31.450 --> 01:07:36.000
No.
What are your go to podcasts you mentioned cereal.
I,

1103
01:07:38.010 --> 01:07:40.850
<v 2>okay.
If you tried to attribute,
have you,</v>

1104
01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:45.080
have you sort of wandered out into the,
uh,
the,
uh,

1105
01:07:45.081 --> 01:07:49.220
the otter neighborhoods outside of a public radio or not yet?

1106
01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:52.730
<v 4>Not much.
I probably should do more of that,
but there's just so many,</v>

1107
01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.750
there's so many podcasts and I listen to as many players,

1108
01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:59.220
so I've recommended it before,
but I'll recommend it again.
Shake out hardcore

1109
01:07:59.230 --> 01:08:02.080
<v 2>history.
Okay.
It's so amazing.</v>

1110
01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:07.420
Maybe one episode every two to three months and it's phenomenal.

1111
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:12.030
Check out wrath of the cons.
It's a multipart series on,
uh,

1112
01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:16.880
Genghis Khan as he says,
getting guess.
Uh,
so,

1113
01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:21.760
uh,
the,
let me,
let me ask you a couple of,
uh,

1114
01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:26.710
very different questions than not necessarily relationship related,
but they're,

1115
01:08:26.711 --> 01:08:29.780
they're questions that I know and what listeners enjoy hearing answers to.

1116
01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:34.670
And I enjoy hearing answers too.
So,
uh,
the first one might sound odd,

1117
01:08:34.671 --> 01:08:38.570
but it's,
it's related to a

1118
01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:43.350
purchasing behavior.
So,
uh,

1119
01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:48.600
what is the most impactful hundred dollars or less that you've spent recently?

1120
01:08:49.150 --> 01:08:54.150
And it could be on anything but a curious and it can be something free for that

1121
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:56.530
manner.

1122
01:08:56.530 --> 01:09:01.530
What I or what have you spent $100 or less on in the last six months,

1123
01:09:02.970 --> 01:09:07.630
year that is disproportionately positively impacted your life.

1124
01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:13.593
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1125
01:09:14.090 --> 01:09:15.900
<v 4>We can plant that seed and come back to them.
I mean,</v>

1126
01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.240
I'm going to tell you the first thing I thought of,

1127
01:09:17.241 --> 01:09:22.190
it's not something we spent money on,
but as many people do,

1128
01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:25.070
we pile up stuff that we don't need anymore.

1129
01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:30.220
And we took a big pile of it to goodwill today and we were saying how wonderful

1130
01:09:31.730 --> 01:09:36.730
the goodwill sort of Jujitsu is that many people don't understand that it's not

1131
01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:41.780
just that they happen to sell the stuff that they sell cheaply,

1132
01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:47.000
but they have this balanced just right where they take the stuff that they get

1133
01:09:47.001 --> 01:09:50.120
for free and they mark it up a nontrivial amount,

1134
01:09:50.121 --> 01:09:54.020
but still a lot less than the people who go to goodwill would otherwise pay for

1135
01:09:54.021 --> 01:09:58.790
that stuff.
It has no value to us.
We would otherwise have thrown it away.

1136
01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:00.560
So it's sort of something for nothing.

1137
01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:05.000
But then they take the profit they make from that and they have other

1138
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:06.620
philanthropic enterprises.

1139
01:10:06.621 --> 01:10:10.130
They use up all of that profit doing other things.

1140
01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:14.300
And I don't know,
it was the first thing I thought it was,
um,

1141
01:10:15.730 --> 01:10:16.563
I know

1142
01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:22.120
we give away something that has no value anymore for us and they derive so much

1143
01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:25.560
value from it.
I know it was just the first thing I thought of was,
oh,

1144
01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:30.200
that's dropping.
It's not just that it feels good to like donate something.

1145
01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:35.380
It's that I particularly love the idea of a well crafted business model and

1146
01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:41.920
there are many Ngo's that are just highly non efficient with the money that they

1147
01:10:43.521 --> 01:10:48.290
get to put it diplomatically and the goodwill is not one of them.

1148
01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:53.270
Goodwill has actually got the sort of fly wheel going in a really positive way

1149
01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:57.670
where everybody goes home happier.
Yeah.
It's just,

1150
01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:00.500
oh they're like the world should be more like that.

1151
01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:03.230
So what has made a big difference?

1152
01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:05.960
Actually Google.

1153
01:11:09.010 --> 01:11:09.843
Okay.

1154
01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:14.310
Really has really

1155
01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:17.500
<v 3>changed everything because we used to have to listen to the radio in the car</v>

1156
01:11:17.501 --> 01:11:20.130
because the kids don't want to listen to pop music and they had switched from

1157
01:11:20.131 --> 01:11:23.310
one station to another and we'd have to listen to this horrible advertising on

1158
01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:26.820
the radio.
And then at home they would play it on youtube.

1159
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:29.430
So then they'd all be hunched around the computer and then they'd end up

1160
01:11:29.431 --> 01:11:32.580
watching videos and it would just be all sort of choppy watching what they

1161
01:11:32.581 --> 01:11:35.190
wanted.
And so we finally got them.
They're all,

1162
01:11:35.191 --> 01:11:40.191
you can eat buffet of Google play and now they can for a flat fee every month,

1163
01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:44.640
get as much music as they want and it has made our car rides much nicer.

1164
01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:50.720
<v 4>Right.
And then because of,
for whatever it is,
like seven 99 a month,</v>

1165
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:54.410
they can make their playlist as long as they want.

1166
01:11:54.650 --> 01:11:57.560
Instead of listening to the 10 popular songs,

1167
01:11:58.010 --> 01:12:00.650
they've made playlists that are several hundred songs long.

1168
01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:05.510
They left today and we kept their pleading and we kept their playlist on because

1169
01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:10.670
at least it's not repeated 20 minute time slot we are 20 minutes ago and nothing

1170
01:12:10.671 --> 01:12:13.250
has to buy music for them.
That's right.
And that was given some money.

1171
01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:15.210
<v 0>Very cool.
I like that.</v>

1172
01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:18.940
<v 2>Uh Oh yeah.
So side note,
very closely related.</v>

1173
01:12:19.150 --> 01:12:24.150
It's taken me years to upgrade to Pandora approach is like $3 a month or

1174
01:12:25.241 --> 01:12:26.450
whatever to get rid of the

1175
01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:31.990
<v 0>ads and now you wonder why,
why</v>

1176
01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:33.670
<v 2>did it take me so long to do this?</v>

1177
01:12:33.671 --> 01:12:38.671
And what's really funny is I set up my Pandora account initially when I was on

1178
01:12:38.771 --> 01:12:43.010
long island.
So all of the ads are targeted locally to long islanders.

1179
01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:46.980
<v 0>Like,
Hey,
come on down the comic form,
you know,</v>

1180
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:49.210
minivans and we'll show it.
Yeah,
that'd be great.

1181
01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:53.470
And like all of these ads and there's,
they're so bad,

1182
01:12:54.190 --> 01:12:55.090
<v 2>while I was like,
all right,</v>

1183
01:12:55.091 --> 01:12:58.080
I'm going to sit down for five minutes and like fix this problem once for,

1184
01:12:58.190 --> 01:13:02.710
it's like $3 a month or whatever the hell it was.
$3.
Right.
So well spent.

1185
01:13:02.770 --> 01:13:06.240
Oh my God.
Uh,
so it'd be like,
you know,

1186
01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:10.180
pretending to dance tango with my girlfriend or something.
We'd be like,
oh,

1187
01:13:10.190 --> 01:13:11.530
it's like romantic moment and then it be,
yeah,

1188
01:13:17.490 --> 01:13:22.110
<v 0>oh,
it's Jesus relying and like Saturday night there it goes to the magic.</v>

1189
01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:25.350
Uh,
so a book,

1190
01:13:25.351 --> 01:13:28.920
so I'm just like my books for a second and documentaries.
Uh,

1191
01:13:29.730 --> 01:13:33.180
<v 2>and there,
there,
there are two options.
The first is favorite book.</v>

1192
01:13:33.181 --> 01:13:35.250
If there's one that immediately comes to mind that you usually,

1193
01:13:35.251 --> 01:13:39.150
people don't know and they kinda just pick one randomly had a memory or most

1194
01:13:39.151 --> 01:13:42.270
gifted book,
the book you've gifted to the most people,

1195
01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:47.270
<v 0>uh,
start with books,
astro or Danielle.</v>

1196
01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:52.710
<v 4>I'm not even going to try to go for favorite book,
too many books,</v>

1197
01:13:52.890 --> 01:13:57.420
but I will tell you the sort of recent books.
Okay.

1198
01:13:57.690 --> 01:14:02.690
Most recent gifted book from our family is what if this is the XKCD amazing

1199
01:14:05.491 --> 01:14:09.570
book.
The kids are obsessed with this.
They can quote it from memory.

1200
01:14:09.571 --> 01:14:13.690
They've learned probably more science from the what if book than they have from

1201
01:14:13.691 --> 01:14:15.490
their science class in the last two years.

1202
01:14:15.491 --> 01:14:20.110
And we've given out quite a few copies and we just finished reading.

1203
01:14:20.111 --> 01:14:22.540
We read in bed together.
Um,

1204
01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:27.590
a nontrivial percentage of the evenings.
Like that's just read silently.
It's,
no,

1205
01:14:27.591 --> 01:14:29.830
no,
no,
no,
no way.
We read to each other.
I mean,

1206
01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:32.050
at least lately I've been the one who was reading,

1207
01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:35.530
so I just finished reading her ready player one,
which was,
you know,

1208
01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:39.820
I just bought that audio book.
I have it.
It's so much fun.

1209
01:14:39.821 --> 01:14:44.380
And now we're in the doldrums because it was so fun that we're like pouting

1210
01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:48.030
because nothing's going to be as good.
You know,
that feeling.
I have to agree.

1211
01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:53.730
<v 2>I have a suggestion.
Yeah.
Uh,
do you have any interest in fantasy?
No,</v>

1212
01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.100
no.
Yes,
yes.

1213
01:14:57.610 --> 01:15:01.710
The name of the wind by Patrick Rothfuss.
Alright,

1214
01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:06.700
well I have yet to suggest it to anyone who hasn't enjoyed it.

1215
01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:07.890
All right.
Yeah.

1216
01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:12.900
The other option that also has a really good track record so far as far as

1217
01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:17.650
people I've recommended to is the graveyard book by Neil Gaiman.

1218
01:15:18.850 --> 01:15:21.700
It's about a young boy who was raised in a graveyard.

1219
01:15:22.410 --> 01:15:25.480
A really,
really stellar,
I think,
uh,
the,

1220
01:15:25.481 --> 01:15:28.600
the audio book is partially what drew me in just because Neil Gaiman is such an

1221
01:15:28.601 --> 01:15:31.410
incredible narrator.
Okay.
So what if

1222
01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:35.840
<v 3>right?
Isn't the graveyard book a recreation of a,
of another famous?
Yes.</v>

1223
01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:41.440
<v 2>Ooh,
that's a good question.
I just thought I would have bet you my life.</v>

1224
01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:43.940
<v 3>Uh,
well I would say the,</v>

1225
01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:47.280
the one book that I had probably tried to push on the most people and it really

1226
01:15:47.281 --> 01:15:51.840
didn't take it cause I stopped pushing it on people was Oscar and Lucinda by

1227
01:15:51.841 --> 01:15:56.290
Peter Carey.
Okay.
Just fell in love with that novel Oscar and loosened up.
Yeah.

1228
01:15:56.370 --> 01:16:00.210
When I was,
uh,
this was a long time ago.
I just really,
really love that book.

1229
01:16:00.211 --> 01:16:02.580
What did you like about it?
It was just so lyrical.

1230
01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:06.090
Every single chapter is like a little jewel.

1231
01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:11.120
He has the most amazing way of bringing to life a scene with not just beautiful

1232
01:16:12.481 --> 01:16:16.130
language,
but incredible imagery like,
uh,

1233
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:21.300
a coat rack with cats and coats on it,
looking like it's covered with crows.

1234
01:16:21.301 --> 01:16:25.530
Like you had this image of these birds who were going to take flayed and um,

1235
01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:29.430
this one of a birds diving into the water,

1236
01:16:29.670 --> 01:16:32.010
piercing the membrane between dreams and reality.

1237
01:16:32.010 --> 01:16:35.430
And he just has this wonderful turns of phrases.
Or there's women who,

1238
01:16:35.810 --> 01:16:40.080
there were parts that are really funny too.
It's,
it's,
it's not just all lyrical,

1239
01:16:40.081 --> 01:16:44.580
but this a w the listened to character in the book gets really angry and yells

1240
01:16:44.581 --> 01:16:47.340
at someone and then the,

1241
01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:50.910
she realizes that she's created a scandal and this is gonna create a problem.

1242
01:16:51.090 --> 01:16:55.800
And there's this great image of her saying that as her anger cooled,

1243
01:16:55.980 --> 01:17:00.930
it was like an athlete who had torn a muscle in the middle of a race or a game.

1244
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:04.560
And then as the anger went away and then she could feel the pain,

1245
01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:07.110
the pain set in.
It's such a common feeling,
right?

1246
01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:10.930
Or you do something in a moment of anger,
but this,
comparing it to this is the,

1247
01:17:10.931 --> 01:17:14.420
this athlete who's just feeling this pain and the first time Amy,
I love that.

1248
01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:16.070
And the other one I love is the hours first.

1249
01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:19.790
A very similar reason by Michael Cunningham.
Yeah,
no.

1250
01:17:19.791 --> 01:17:22.310
Why isn't it the first one not take?
So you're trying to push it,

1251
01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:26.390
but he didn't take it because it doesn't have,
it's not very plot driven.

1252
01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:31.190
It's kind of long and it's really about the moments and about their writing and

1253
01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:34.190
the plot is very slow to get going until you get halfway through the book.

1254
01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:37.790
You're really not sure where the book is going and then it's a romance,

1255
01:17:37.791 --> 01:17:40.040
but it's not a very uplifting,

1256
01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:44.560
<v 4>right.
This is why we're each other's other half my favorite books.</v>

1257
01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:49.080
I have the exact same problem and I pushed them on people and nobody likes him

1258
01:17:49.090 --> 01:17:52.360
either.
Yeah.
It's the Garmin gas trilogy by Mervyn Peake.

1259
01:17:52.450 --> 01:17:57.130
What was the name of the field?
Warming guest.
Gorman.
Gorman gassed.

1260
01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:01.810
It's you spell that.
And G,
O r g e n g.

1261
01:18:01.811 --> 01:18:06.150
H.
A.
S.
T.
O forming gassed.
It's the name of a castle.
It's a,

1262
01:18:06.151 --> 01:18:08.800
it's this castle.
It's like a fantasy story,

1263
01:18:08.801 --> 01:18:10.870
but there's no magic or which is are elves or anything.

1264
01:18:10.871 --> 01:18:15.040
It's just this castle that set in this very abstract place.

1265
01:18:15.250 --> 01:18:18.030
And it's just the political life in the caseloads,

1266
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:22.180
like downtown Abbey in a castle.
Uh,
it's more abstract than that.

1267
01:18:22.530 --> 01:18:26.070
It's a cartoon version of that.
A very gorgeous Tartine,
but it was,

1268
01:18:26.170 --> 01:18:31.170
it's written by an artist and a poet who had until he wrote the first book,

1269
01:18:32.081 --> 01:18:35.950
never written a novel and it reads like that.

1270
01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:39.780
They are word paintings.
Right.
Um,

1271
01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:44.260
and so many people read them and just are like,
uh,
I just,
I can't keep going.

1272
01:18:44.810 --> 01:18:45.643
Uh,

1273
01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:49.890
<v 2>and,
but I just,
I've lived the book recommendation for you.
Yeah.
Uh,</v>

1274
01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:54.450
it's called motherless Brooklyn.
It's about a spent Jonathan them,

1275
01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:55.860
it's fantastic,

1276
01:18:55.890 --> 01:19:00.480
hilarious novel about a detective with Tourette's syndrome

1277
01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:02.203
<v 4>and it's</v>

1278
01:19:02.210 --> 01:19:05.240
<v 2>based in Brooklyn.
And,
uh,
it,</v>

1279
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:09.740
it fully embraces all of the cliches of the detective genre.

1280
01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.750
It's,
I love it.

1281
01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:16.780
It was recommended to me by two staunch critics who seldom recommend books.

1282
01:19:17.181 --> 01:19:20.720
My mother and my brother and I can count on one hand the number of books that

1283
01:19:20.721 --> 01:19:24.230
are recommended to me about,
about those people.
So mother was Brooklyn,

1284
01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:30.050
uh,
when,
uh,
I'll,
I'll,
I'll,
uh,

1285
01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:33.830
ask each of you separately.
So asked her,
when you think of the word successful,

1286
01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:35.450
who is the first person who comes to mind?

1287
01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:43.700
<v 4>Uh,
the first person came to my mind was Elon Musk.
I don't know that I would,</v>

1288
01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:47.750
yeah.
I mean,
obviously it's a successful person,

1289
01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:53.120
but there's so many different kinds of success.
Uh,
oh,
stick into that.

1290
01:19:53.210 --> 01:19:55.490
Yeah,
that's,
that's worth exploring.
I think.

1291
01:19:56.810 --> 01:20:01.810
I admire the fact that he has single handedly done what most other people need a

1292
01:20:02.451 --> 01:20:03.890
large crew to help do.

1293
01:20:03.950 --> 01:20:08.950
He has started a series of really successful things and he's highly involved.

1294
01:20:09.661 --> 01:20:13.110
And,
um,
I admire that.

1295
01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:18.140
That's sort of boundless ambition combined with the seriousness about digging in

1296
01:20:19.471 --> 01:20:22.490
and doing what it takes to get it done.
And he's quit purpose-driven,

1297
01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:24.000
which I happen to like also,

1298
01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:29.700
<v 2>if you had to put a half of your net worth into space,
extra Tesla,</v>

1299
01:20:29.701 --> 01:20:31.020
which one would you choose and why?

1300
01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:34.113
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1301
01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:36.620
<v 2>dramatic wine.
Pour it.</v>

1302
01:20:39.190 --> 01:20:44.120
That's the sound of astro as money going down the drain.
Good,
good,
good,
good.

1303
01:20:44.121 --> 01:20:47.330
Before?
No,
I'm going to say space X.
Okay.

1304
01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.193
<v 4>Um,</v>

1305
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:53.120
I think Tesla will be a more successful financially successful business,

1306
01:20:53.450 --> 01:20:54.283
but

1307
01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:55.250
<v 3>okay.</v>

1308
01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:58.670
<v 4>It would be hard to get as excited about that.</v>

1309
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:04.000
It is just inherently more audacious,

1310
01:21:04.071 --> 01:21:05.860
more um,

1311
01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:11.860
in the spirit that moves me to dream about going to Mars,

1312
01:21:12.771 --> 01:21:17.771
which is what fundamentally drives Alon and especially about space x.

1313
01:21:20.350 --> 01:21:21.450
There's just,
um,

1314
01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:22.850
<v 3>okay.</v>

1315
01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:27.850
<v 4>The ethos of that adventure is worth more to me than the dollars that would be</v>

1316
01:21:30.051 --> 01:21:34.910
created by better electric cars.
So there's not a knock on Tesla,

1317
01:21:34.911 --> 01:21:37.520
but I,
that's my knee jerk reaction.
Yeah.
Okay.

1318
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:41.770
<v 3>Cool.
What about you?
I think I'm going to take a pass on that one.</v>

1319
01:21:41.771 --> 01:21:45.690
I don't really have,
I think I liked that leaps to mind.
No,
no.

1320
01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:49.270
I mean not that there are just so many successful people and I,
I dunno,

1321
01:21:49.630 --> 01:21:53.410
I feel like I just,
the benefit of going second or the curse of going second.

1322
01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:56.170
Well I had all this time to think of and I was thinking,

1323
01:21:56.171 --> 01:22:00.690
I was thinking like who could I,
but they're just so many,
uh,
people at,

1324
01:22:00.850 --> 01:22:01.840
I don't even know where to start.

1325
01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:07.710
<v 2>If you could choose anyone throughout history to ask a hundred questions,</v>

1326
01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:11.490
I'm not going to ask you to get the questions,
but who would you,

1327
01:22:11.491 --> 01:22:12.330
who would you choose

1328
01:22:14.370 --> 01:22:17.490
<v 3>ask a hundred questions that,
anything that,
anything</v>

1329
01:22:18.690 --> 01:22:23.310
<v 2>life,
career or otherwise,
preferably a factually verifiable figure.
You're</v>

1330
01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:24.233
<v 3>right.</v>

1331
01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.950
I think I'd be most interested in

1332
01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:36.080
talking to one of the Greek philosophers cause I feel like we have a lot of

1333
01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:40.980
documentation about what they thought and a fair amount about how they lived,

1334
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:45.690
but it's not a complete picture.
Yeah.
And um,

1335
01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:51.270
obviously they spent a lot of their lives thinking very deeply and that things

1336
01:22:51.271 --> 01:22:56.271
that I would like to get their sort of take on the questions that I would want

1337
01:22:56.730 --> 01:23:01.380
to ask them.
Any particular philosophers?
Probably,
I mean Plato is,
yeah,

1338
01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:05.830
I think the most interesting.
Yeah,
they're all all such

1339
01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:10.510
<v 2>fascinating,
conflicted characters,
modern human beings.
Measure that.</v>

1340
01:23:11.050 --> 01:23:12.010
Uh,

1341
01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:17.820
if you had to point to ways in which you are medical or scientific training has

1342
01:23:17.861 --> 01:23:22.150
helped you or your relationships with family or significant others,

1343
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:24.180
is there anything that you could point to?

1344
01:23:25.050 --> 01:23:28.380
<v 3>Yeah,
I think there are a lot of things to point to.
Um,</v>

1345
01:23:28.890 --> 01:23:32.460
probably the most significant is that

1346
01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:37.440
being in medicine you deal with people from all walks of life,

1347
01:23:37.530 --> 01:23:39.180
from all cultures,

1348
01:23:39.210 --> 01:23:42.930
all parts of the world and working in an intensive care unit,

1349
01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:48.020
you're working with families and patients who are in some of the most dire

1350
01:23:49.471 --> 01:23:52.080
straights that they've ever been in.

1351
01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:57.860
And I think that it really forces you to not just pay lip service to seeing

1352
01:23:57.961 --> 01:24:00.780
things from the perspective of other people,

1353
01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:05.840
but actually having to really try to understand where they're coming from and

1354
01:24:06.841 --> 01:24:10.260
how to
connect with them.

1355
01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:15.350
It's really important in those times to connect when you're trying to talk about

1356
01:24:17.071 --> 01:24:19.230
decisions surrounding life and death.

1357
01:24:19.490 --> 01:24:21.510
You really need to have a strong connection.

1358
01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:26.900
And I think that opens your mind so much to realizing how differently different

1359
01:24:27.811 --> 01:24:30.720
people feel about the world and think about the world.

1360
01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:35.280
And it puts you in the mindset of having to adapt yourself to their way of

1361
01:24:35.281 --> 01:24:39.270
thinking.
And so I feel like that has been very valuable.

1362
01:24:39.271 --> 01:24:43.920
They don't sort of have a knee jerk reaction to whether a perspective someone

1363
01:24:43.921 --> 01:24:47.910
has is right or wrong that I've been trained over the years to not see it in

1364
01:24:47.911 --> 01:24:51.270
black and white terms,
but just see it as,
you know,
people are different.

1365
01:24:52.010 --> 01:24:52.850
<v 2>So it,
it's,</v>

1366
01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:57.880
it's sort of pragmatically trained you to have that immediate degree of empathy

1367
01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:00.650
that you wouldn't have otherwise.

1368
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:01.200
<v 3>That's true.</v>

1369
01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:06.200
But also just not to shut my mind to what they're trying to say because they

1370
01:25:07.521 --> 01:25:10.550
might have,
you know,
I might be speaking with someone,
I'm not religious.

1371
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:14.120
I might be speaking to someone who is very religious and I need to try to see

1372
01:25:14.121 --> 01:25:17.300
the world from their perspective.
And when you're talking to a teenager,
you,

1373
01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:19.590
you need to imply,
you know,

1374
01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:23.630
and play these sorts of skills and see that they may have a radically different

1375
01:25:23.631 --> 01:25:27.470
way of seeing the world then you have have seen the world.
Yeah.

1376
01:25:28.570 --> 01:25:32.200
<v 2>What were you,
uh,
what type of medicine were you involved with in the ICU?</v>

1377
01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:35.200
<v 3>So I worked in the medical intensive care unit,</v>

1378
01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:40.680
which is the unit for everyone who's severely sick enough to either be on

1379
01:25:41.530 --> 01:25:46.360
machines to support them or are going to soon potentially need to be on machines

1380
01:25:46.361 --> 01:25:50.380
to support them,
um,
who don't have a surgical issue.

1381
01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:53.860
So the people who have had surgery,
they go to the surgical intensive care unit.

1382
01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:57.190
And then there's also a separate cardiac intensive care unit.

1383
01:25:57.191 --> 01:25:58.780
So if you had a heart attack,
you go somewhere else.

1384
01:25:58.930 --> 01:26:01.270
So we kind of get rid of the grab bag of everything else.

1385
01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:05.000
These are chronic sort of progressive diseases?
Well,
no,

1386
01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:07.940
I mean we see them when they're in their acute phase and hopefully get them

1387
01:26:07.941 --> 01:26:12.170
better and send them on their way.
Okay.
Oftentimes they don't get better.

1388
01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:14.340
And this is the rest of her glass on it.
The

1389
01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:19.370
conversations with Matt.
Yeah.
You have a lot of,

1390
01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:21.710
a lot of conversations about

1391
01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:27.140
the end of life because that's a lot of these people were at the ends of their

1392
01:26:27.141 --> 01:26:27.890
lives.

1393
01:26:27.890 --> 01:26:32.130
And do any of those conversations in particular stand out to you that have just

1394
01:26:32.170 --> 01:26:37.090
kind of stuck in your mind?
Well,
I think,
um,
yeah,

1395
01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:38.001
a few of them do.

1396
01:26:38.001 --> 01:26:42.650
I think one of the ones that's pertinent to sing people a different perspective

1397
01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:45.230
was a,

1398
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:49.820
one of the problems that a lot of the medical professionals,

1399
01:26:49.821 --> 01:26:54.590
nurses and physicians who work in intensive care units in this country is that

1400
01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:59.570
we ended up having a very different view of the end of life than people who are

1401
01:26:59.690 --> 01:27:02.120
coming in than the families and patients that were coming in.

1402
01:27:02.570 --> 01:27:07.570
Our society has such a strong optimism and so and such a belief in the medical

1403
01:27:09.981 --> 01:27:14.330
system that they believe that everyone's going to be made better.
Not everyone,

1404
01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:15.290
that's an exaggeration.

1405
01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:19.040
But I think that they have more confidence than maybe it's warranted and how

1406
01:27:19.041 --> 01:27:22.220
much the medical system can do to save their loved ones.

1407
01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:27.590
And a lot of people have,
you know,
in order to provide them with hope,

1408
01:27:27.710 --> 01:27:31.760
they have been told along the way that things were maybe rosier than they

1409
01:27:31.761 --> 01:27:32.390
actually were.

1410
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:37.010
And then we were put in the position of having to deliver the news that it's

1411
01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:39.370
unfortunately,
unfortunately,

1412
01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:41.780
we've already passed the point where there's nothing left to do.

1413
01:27:41.781 --> 01:27:45.530
And at this point it's,
we're just coming to the end.

1414
01:27:45.531 --> 01:27:50.531
And what's very difficult is when families won't hear that and don't they want

1415
01:27:51.681 --> 01:27:55.730
us to continue to provide life support.

1416
01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:59.980
We know that it's going nowhere and we know that it's just a bridge too,
like,
uh,

1417
01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:03.950
a more difficult,
challenging death for this person and that,

1418
01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:07.430
and we feel like we're sometimes torturing these people.

1419
01:28:07.431 --> 01:28:12.431
They were just causing unnecessary pain and harm that the outcome's the same,

1420
01:28:12.951 --> 01:28:16.670
that they're going to die very soon and they may die one day and maybe two
weeks.

1421
01:28:16.670 --> 01:28:19.790
But if it's two weeks it's going to be two very horrible weeks.

1422
01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:23.750
And we feel awful doing that to people.

1423
01:28:23.870 --> 01:28:28.160
We just feel like then dignified and it just,
people have very strong,

1424
01:28:28.161 --> 01:28:30.620
the staff have very strong emotional reactions to that.

1425
01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:35.980
So I had one patient who was a very successful medical researcher who had a type

1426
01:28:39.051 --> 01:28:44.051
of cancer that had spread throughout his body and he had insisted on having it

1427
01:28:46.130 --> 01:28:50.660
hacked out one piece at a time,
even though it wasn't really the thing that you,

1428
01:28:50.690 --> 01:28:53.750
from a medical perspective that wasn't going to improve his life expectancy.

1429
01:28:53.751 --> 01:28:57.300
But he was young,
he was only in his forties and he had,
you know,

1430
01:28:57.350 --> 01:29:02.130
been very successful,
very well known scientist.
And um,

1431
01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:06.000
he insisted that he needed to have everything done.
Absolutely everything done.

1432
01:29:06.030 --> 01:29:10.710
And when I met him,
he was at death's door.

1433
01:29:10.770 --> 01:29:13.290
But because his underlying body was so strong,

1434
01:29:13.530 --> 01:29:16.150
he could stay at death's door for a long time,
you know,
be,

1435
01:29:16.750 --> 01:29:21.150
it could take a long time for him to actually die.
And I spoke with his wife.

1436
01:29:21.151 --> 01:29:24.330
We had,
um,
you know,
we had,

1437
01:29:24.510 --> 01:29:28.440
we had talked to the other teams who had taken care of him and they'd said,
look,

1438
01:29:28.441 --> 01:29:33.120
he's never said that he's willing to let people stop with any kinds of

1439
01:29:33.121 --> 01:29:38.070
aggressive treatment,
even if it's few title,
even if it's hopeless.
And in theory,

1440
01:29:39.850 --> 01:29:42.810
doctors don't have to provide treatment that is few tiles.

1441
01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:48.140
But because we so strongly right now in our culture wants to respect the wishes

1442
01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:53.670
of patients,
we often do provide few telecare,
which is where the,

1443
01:29:53.730 --> 01:29:55.230
where it's hard emotionally for every man.

1444
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:59.090
And I had this conversation with his wife and she said to me,
she said,
look fun.

1445
01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:03.180
And she was lovely,
lovely woman.
And she said to me,

1446
01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:05.430
I know where you're coming from.

1447
01:30:05.670 --> 01:30:08.340
I totally get what you're saying.

1448
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:13.550
I know he's going to be dead soon and he wanted to die a warrior's death.

1449
01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:17.700
And he is a warrior and this is how he's going to go out.

1450
01:30:17.730 --> 01:30:19.800
Like he just wants to go out fighting.

1451
01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:24.810
And I just suddenly felt at peace.
I was like,
you know what,

1452
01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:28.140
from my perspective,
this is the wrong thing.

1453
01:30:28.770 --> 01:30:33.770
But we're honoring his wishes by letting him breathe until the last moment where

1454
01:30:34.891 --> 01:30:37.710
even a machine can't support him.
It's not what I would choose.

1455
01:30:37.890 --> 01:30:39.900
It's not what I would choose for anyone I cared about,

1456
01:30:40.410 --> 01:30:45.330
but he was dying as a warrior and that was what he wanted.
And it,
I just,

1457
01:30:45.331 --> 01:30:49.440
I felt so much better about what we were doing and it also,
let me see that.

1458
01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:52.440
Yeah.
This,
my perspective is not the only one.

1459
01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:55.140
Like there are other ways of looking at life and death.

1460
01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:59.750
<v 2>Yeah,
it's a,
I'm very close friends.
Um,</v>

1461
01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:03.940
I had no idea he had metastasized pancreatic cancer.

1462
01:31:04.570 --> 01:31:08.800
We went on a skiing trip and uh,
South America,
which I knew was very,
very,

1463
01:31:08.801 --> 01:31:12.520
very expensive for him.
Uh,
with,
with another friend,

1464
01:31:12.521 --> 01:31:16.660
the three of us went down and skied in Las lineas and Argentina and literally,

1465
01:31:16.661 --> 01:31:20.440
I think it was less than six months later he was dead.
And,
uh,

1466
01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:25.800
it's a part of the reason that I read so much of the stoics because they reflect

1467
01:31:25.931 --> 01:31:29.050
on death.
Some might say obsessed with death.

1468
01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:30.670
They can't seem to get tired of talking about it.
Yeah.

1469
01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:34.070
<v 4>Uh,
how do you think about death,
Astra?
I mean,
what,</v>

1470
01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:37.580
how do you feel about the prospect of biological death?

1471
01:31:39.170 --> 01:31:43.790
I'm not particularly looking forward to mine,
but I made peace with it.

1472
01:31:43.791 --> 01:31:48.791
I think I recognize that it's going to happen and I worry frankly about people,

1473
01:31:49.491 --> 01:31:54.020
especially in the tech community who were obsessed with trying to prevent death.

1474
01:31:54.810 --> 01:31:55.643
<v 3>Aye.</v>

1475
01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:01.160
<v 4>I have no objection to generally trying to help people live longer or be</v>

1476
01:32:01.211 --> 01:32:04.090
healthier while they're alive,
more functional while they're alive.

1477
01:32:04.091 --> 01:32:05.290
Those are all good things.

1478
01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:10.720
It's still sometimes smells like kind of a creepy desperation.

1479
01:32:10.721 --> 01:32:15.610
The way the tech community can get overly obsessed about death and I think that

1480
01:32:15.611 --> 01:32:20.611
they're chasing something that they won't find and making themselves miserable

1481
01:32:21.491 --> 01:32:25.090
in the process because trying to convince themselves that they're going to be

1482
01:32:25.091 --> 01:32:28.930
able to avoid death,
which they don't really believe in their hearts,

1483
01:32:29.230 --> 01:32:34.230
leaves them feeling panicked in a way that if they just made peace with the fact

1484
01:32:34.721 --> 01:32:38.630
that they're going to die,
they could just focus on being happy.
Um,

1485
01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:43.680
my personal philosophy is to live my life as intensely as I can every single

1486
01:32:45.161 --> 01:32:50.020
day.
And if I do that,
then it doesn't matter when I go.

1487
01:32:50.230 --> 01:32:51.063
Um,

1488
01:32:51.190 --> 01:32:55.660
I had this experience when I was just middle of graduate school,

1489
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:58.390
but I was playing soccer very competitively still.

1490
01:32:58.810 --> 01:33:03.810
And it was the last time I ever asked someone to take me out of a game.

1491
01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:09.400
I said,
take me out.
And Cause I was,
I wasn't dying,

1492
01:33:09.670 --> 01:33:14.670
but I just felt like someone else could be doing more for the team because I was

1493
01:33:15.521 --> 01:33:18.010
sufficiently tired as well in the middle of the second half.

1494
01:33:18.011 --> 01:33:23.011
And the coach got me out and as soon as he got me out I was dying to go back in.

1495
01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:27.610
I was just,
and I thought I am never doing that again.

1496
01:33:28.330 --> 01:33:30.340
I would rather collapse on the field,

1497
01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:35.140
which was I suppose a somewhat selfish perspective to have.
But I just thought,

1498
01:33:35.141 --> 01:33:35.974
you know what,
wait,

1499
01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:40.810
it's the coach's job to tell that I'm tired and I,

1500
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:44.110
I sort of overthought the whole thing.

1501
01:33:44.350 --> 01:33:47.500
And then I had all these regrets after I got off the field and they couldn't put

1502
01:33:47.501 --> 01:33:52.501
me back on cause there's only two subs a game and it's become very metaphorical

1503
01:33:53.141 --> 01:33:53.974
to me.

1504
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:58.900
It doesn't matter when the game's over as long as I don't leave anything on the

1505
01:33:58.901 --> 01:33:59.490
field.

1506
01:33:59.490 --> 01:34:02.410
<v 2>So this is very Vince Lombardi.
I like it.</v>

1507
01:34:03.410 --> 01:34:06.900
This living intensely.
I want to dig into this for a second.
What,

1508
01:34:07.530 --> 01:34:10.140
when you come to the close of the day,

1509
01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:15.770
what does a successful day look like versus a a failed day where sub suboptimal

1510
01:34:16.801 --> 01:34:17.634
that everyone,

1511
01:34:17.850 --> 01:34:20.010
<v 4>it's entirely a perspective thing for me.</v>

1512
01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:23.850
I mean I never cross everything off my to do list.

1513
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.851
<v 2>Well,
I mean,
it's just,</v>

1514
01:34:24.851 --> 01:34:28.060
just to give Sobel people may not be familiar with Google mean.
Let's give some,

1515
01:34:28.061 --> 01:34:30.430
if you wouldn't mind giving some examples of the kind of stuff that you guys are

1516
01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:34.150
working on and what the,
what is the function of Google x?
Sounds very,

1517
01:34:34.230 --> 01:34:35.063
<v 4>I expect,
ma'am,</v>

1518
01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:39.360
the function of Google access to try to find some new,

1519
01:34:39.390 --> 01:34:44.310
really important problems with the world that are not yet Google's problems.

1520
01:34:44.700 --> 01:34:49.350
Uh,
and to make them Google's problems to take on things like the transportation

1521
01:34:49.351 --> 01:34:52.560
problem,
solving the connectivity problem,

1522
01:34:52.561 --> 01:34:55.560
their 5 billion people in the world who don't have connectivity,

1523
01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:59.060
who are not connected to the Internet.
Let's make that not be true.

1524
01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:02.000
There are very few things that would make the world a better place and solving

1525
01:35:02.001 --> 01:35:02.834
that problem.

1526
01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:08.020
What can we do to produce electricity cheaper than a coal fired power plant that

1527
01:35:09.291 --> 01:35:14.150
would radically change the world.
And we think we might have a way of doing that,

1528
01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:17.990
uh,
via these energy kites that we're working on.
Um,

1529
01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:19.810
so we have some in health care,

1530
01:35:20.330 --> 01:35:24.230
some in sort of human computer interactions like Google glass.

1531
01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:28.430
But each of these have wild,
I don't know,

1532
01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:33.180
the technical equivalent of mood swings every day.
We are,
you know,
I,

1533
01:35:33.181 --> 01:35:36.740
I came home one day and I told our kids,

1534
01:35:36.741 --> 01:35:39.350
I couldn't tell them this was before Luna had actually launched,

1535
01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:44.420
but I told them truthfully that one of our creations had gotten free and we had

1536
01:35:44.421 --> 01:35:49.110
to send a one of our a marine or an ex marine I guess,
uh,

1537
01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:54.070
after it with a Bowie knife to take it down.
Wait a Bowie knife.
Yes.
And so,

1538
01:35:54.150 --> 01:35:58.160
and I told them that our creation with the size of a house,
which was also true,

1539
01:35:58.280 --> 01:35:59.390
now it's something about a balloon.

1540
01:35:59.590 --> 01:36:03.460
It guess in this particular case it was a balloon that it was like half inflated

1541
01:36:03.461 --> 01:36:07.060
and then took off rolling across the countryside.
We had,
uh,

1542
01:36:07.130 --> 01:36:11.080
an ex marine sort of hop a couple of fences and chase it down and sort of slash

1543
01:36:11.081 --> 01:36:14.330
ad with a Bowie knife till enough of the helium came out and stopped rolling

1544
01:36:14.331 --> 01:36:18.350
across is very high to central valley.
But you know,

1545
01:36:18.351 --> 01:36:21.940
the good parts and bad parts kind of play like that.
Um,

1546
01:36:23.690 --> 01:36:28.130
have you guys publicly,
uh,
uh,
disclosed how many,
uh,

1547
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:33.620
how many balloons you've released?
Oh,
several hundred at this point.

1548
01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:35.170
I think it's,
you know,

1549
01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:39.980
when we're ready it will take a lot more than several hundred to be put up.

1550
01:36:40.190 --> 01:36:43.640
But we have,
I don't know on the order of a hundred in the air,

1551
01:36:43.641 --> 01:36:47.270
but it's a testing process.
So whether it was a hundred or 50 or 150,

1552
01:36:47.271 --> 01:36:52.040
doesn't really matter.
I think we just had our first balloon,
um,

1553
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.840
sort of,
I am not sure exactly what the birthday was,
but you know,

1554
01:36:56.841 --> 01:37:00.170
we've now had balloon,
many balloons that stayed up more than a hundred days,

1555
01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:04.790
many that have gone around the world,
uh,
you know,
on the order of 20 or 30 times.

1556
01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:09.940
So we're running all of the experiments that will take so that loon can,

1557
01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:13.280
in the not too distant future,
do what we've aspired for it to do,

1558
01:37:13.281 --> 01:37:15.740
which is to set up a,

1559
01:37:15.770 --> 01:37:20.770
an infrastructure that then the local telcos in various regions can use to

1560
01:37:23.150 --> 01:37:26.890
provide internet to everyone in their region.
And,

1561
01:37:26.891 --> 01:37:30.200
and by doing that everywhere to everyone on the planet,
hopefully.

1562
01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:33.790
And with your subjective assessment of,
uh,

1563
01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:38.930
success or failure in a given day,
how do you,
how do you,

1564
01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:41.900
how do you approach that or how do you just feel about it at the end of the day?

1565
01:37:41.930 --> 01:37:43.760
Like when you're like,
fuck yeah,
that was a good day.

1566
01:37:44.330 --> 01:37:47.100
What are the things that contribute to that or that like,
ah,

1567
01:37:48.430 --> 01:37:51.560
I have no idea what I did all day.
Maybe you don't have that feeling.
I know.
I,

1568
01:37:51.561 --> 01:37:54.980
I do.
I do.
No,
I mean it's was I,

1569
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:59.990
did I really bring mine?
Did I say what I mean?
Yeah.

1570
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.820
I say exactly.
Um,
did I really bring both my intellect,

1571
01:38:03.850 --> 01:38:07.980
the best part of me intellectually and the best part of me emotionally to work

1572
01:38:08.190 --> 01:38:11.700
that I really share that with people.
Um,
did I move them?

1573
01:38:11.701 --> 01:38:15.120
Did I help them to get to a better place?
Um,

1574
01:38:16.230 --> 01:38:17.660
we um,

1575
01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:23.690
had a team meeting recently for one of the teams where,
you know,

1576
01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:28.200
they have some hard work to do in the not too distant future and I needed to

1577
01:38:28.201 --> 01:38:32.520
deliver some hard news to them and you know,

1578
01:38:32.521 --> 01:38:35.940
they're one version of it could be like,
you suck,

1579
01:38:35.941 --> 01:38:38.880
shame on you run harder,
run faster.

1580
01:38:39.090 --> 01:38:43.560
And that was not the version that I gave to them.
I help them be inspired.

1581
01:38:43.561 --> 01:38:46.440
I helped them feel like a family again in a way.

1582
01:38:46.441 --> 01:38:48.300
I think they had been struggling to feel like,

1583
01:38:48.450 --> 01:38:52.560
and I left that meeting feeling incredibly good about myself and about them.

1584
01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:55.830
And not just because I had given a rousing speech,

1585
01:38:55.831 --> 01:38:57.870
but because they had met me halfway.

1586
01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:00.660
They had responded in the way that I was hoping for.

1587
01:39:00.990 --> 01:39:04.060
And that's a good day when,

1588
01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:09.100
when I leave the office feeling like I've helped people,

1589
01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:14.100
I've,
you know,
I'm,
uh,
someone recently said it's kind of a funny way to put it,

1590
01:39:14.430 --> 01:39:19.050
that I'm like a big flywheel at Google x that when things are going well,

1591
01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:23.220
I have no effect.
But then as soon as things start to wobble,

1592
01:39:23.550 --> 01:39:26.250
I prevent things from like getting crazy.

1593
01:39:28.130 --> 01:39:29.190
<v 2>The safety guy.</v>

1594
01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:34.070
I hope not just that,
but yeah.

1595
01:39:35.890 --> 01:39:38.280
But I'd love to ask you just about your own,
uh,

1596
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:43.350
and we'll close up in the next five minutes,
uh,
for yourself.

1597
01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:47.290
I feel as a writer,
a degree of kinship with who,

1598
01:39:47.291 --> 01:39:49.890
with what you guys have gone through and what you were,
you know,

1599
01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:54.390
tackling at the mode with the writing.
Uh,
for me in the last few years,

1600
01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:56.940
it's been very much a case of,
uh,

1601
01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:02.250
losing my identity in a way.
So I've pegged myself to being,
say a writer,

1602
01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:05.250
but then I'm not working on a book.
So what am I?

1603
01:40:06.090 --> 01:40:09.630
And then I'm working on a TV show,
but that falls through what am I,

1604
01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:14.280
and uh,
I'm not saying you're in that position,
but I certainly have been.

1605
01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:15.850
And uh,

1606
01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:20.670
not having a sort of a big team to account two or accounted for.

1607
01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:23.640
Uh,
how do you,
at the end of the day,

1608
01:40:23.670 --> 01:40:26.760
what makes you feel like a day has been successful or not?

1609
01:40:27.690 --> 01:40:32.070
<v 3>That's very interesting that you should ask that question cause I feel the way</v>

1610
01:40:32.071 --> 01:40:32.341
you do.

1611
01:40:32.341 --> 01:40:37.341
Probably Times 10 I was hanging on to my job with my fingernails.

1612
01:40:40.081 --> 01:40:44.460
I really loved what I did and I couldn't find an equivalent position in

1613
01:40:44.461 --> 01:40:49.461
California and decided to take a risk and do something very different.

1614
01:40:51.301 --> 01:40:54.370
And that I don't know if I'm at qualified for it.

1615
01:40:54.371 --> 01:40:57.490
I don't know if I'll have any success at,
so this is,

1616
01:40:57.820 --> 01:41:02.320
this is actually the big struggle in my life right now is I spend my days

1617
01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:06.520
writing and I have no idea if anyone's ever going to read anything that I'm

1618
01:41:06.521 --> 01:41:11.050
actually writing.
So at every day I ask myself,
is this with this worth it?

1619
01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:13.450
Was it not?
I think,
I don't know,

1620
01:41:13.451 --> 01:41:17.380
the things that make me feel like it was a successful day is if I feel like what

1621
01:41:17.381 --> 01:41:19.600
I wrote was good,
but I don't always,

1622
01:41:19.601 --> 01:41:23.680
I mean there are days when I just think that was crap my day writing something

1623
01:41:23.681 --> 01:41:28.490
really quite terrible or I don't make any progress on it.
So that's,

1624
01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:30.430
that's hard.
And then the smell projects,
you know,

1625
01:41:30.431 --> 01:41:35.120
we've been writing a lot of op eds and so on to support sacred cows and yeah.

1626
01:41:35.810 --> 01:41:40.350
<v 0>More than 4 million,
4 million or so.
Yeah.
That's,</v>

1627
01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:43.910
that's a lot.
Yeah.
So when,
so when,
when we get it,
we get,

1628
01:41:43.911 --> 01:41:45.140
she's got high standards.

1629
01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:49.190
There's a lot that's probably more than anything I've ever written.

1630
01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:55.010
<v 3>Yeah.
Feedback from people and they say,
hey,
that was great.</v>

1631
01:41:55.011 --> 01:41:56.960
That really helped me to see things in a different light.

1632
01:41:56.961 --> 01:41:59.780
I really appreciated that then.
Then that makes me feel good.

1633
01:41:59.781 --> 01:42:03.580
But of course as the writer and most days you get no feedback at all.
I,
I,

1634
01:42:03.930 --> 01:42:06.890
I saw this interview with,
um,
the guy,
I don't know his name,

1635
01:42:06.891 --> 01:42:11.820
who wrote the fault in our stars,
which my kids love it.
The John Green is it?

1636
01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:14.510
I think that's right.
Anyway,

1637
01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:18.560
he gave this interview and he was saying that being a writer is like playing

1638
01:42:18.561 --> 01:42:22.970
Marco Polo where all you say is Marco,
Marco,

1639
01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:28.090
Martha.
And then you know,
if you're successful two years later,

1640
01:42:28.250 --> 01:42:29.990
finally someone will say hello.

1641
01:42:32.490 --> 01:42:36.690
<v 0>That's a great description.
Yeah,
sure.
Vania said,
I think it is when I write,</v>

1642
01:42:36.691 --> 01:42:40.110
I feel like an armless and legless man with a crayon and his mouth.

1643
01:42:46.370 --> 01:42:48.450
All right guys.
Well,

1644
01:42:48.451 --> 01:42:53.040
where can people learn more about both of you?
About the book,

1645
01:42:53.070 --> 01:42:57.120
about what you were up to?
Tell us where people can check you out.

1646
01:42:57.930 --> 01:42:59.470
Uh,
they can,
uh,

1647
01:42:59.550 --> 01:43:03.330
<v 4>checkout sacred cows at Amazon,</v>

1648
01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:06.810
at Nook,
uh,
on Google play.

1649
01:43:06.811 --> 01:43:11.811
They can get the book a iTunes has the book they can order.

1650
01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:12.930
Yeah,

1651
01:43:12.930 --> 01:43:17.930
you can go to astro teller.net to learn more about me or go to sacred cows,

1652
01:43:20.761 --> 01:43:24.180
the book.com to learn more about the book.
Um,

1653
01:43:24.330 --> 01:43:28.110
we just gave this a Tedx talk,

1654
01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:33.120
Tedx Boston about sacred cows that we gave together that I think is a good sort

1655
01:43:33.361 --> 01:43:37.240
of 15 minute intro to the concepts in the book.
It's another good way.

1656
01:43:37.241 --> 01:43:40.560
And just to go to youtube and you can check that out too.

1657
01:43:41.070 --> 01:43:45.690
<v 0>Cool.
And what was the piece that he wrote that stirred up so much fire?
Oh Gosh.</v>

1658
01:43:45.691 --> 01:43:47.250
What would they,
a miracle

1659
01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:51.500
<v 4>American parenting is killing the American marriage.</v>

1660
01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:59.270
<v 2>All right,
well thank you so much for coming over guys.
So this is fun.</v>

1661
01:43:59.750 --> 01:44:03.890
We should hang out more and uh,
lots of food for thought.

1662
01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:07.160
Lots of stuff for me to consider and hopefully everybody else out there

1663
01:44:07.161 --> 01:44:09.200
listening.
You can find the show notes.

1664
01:44:09.201 --> 01:44:12.650
Obviously on the website I'll include the links to everything including the book

Tim this episode is brought to you by 99 designs your one stop shop for all

1683
01:45:26.861 --> 01:45:28.750
things graphic design related.

1684
01:45:28.780 --> 01:45:33.760
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers,

1685
01:45:33.761 --> 01:45:37.480
including sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

1686
01:45:37.481 --> 01:45:40.720
which later became number one New York Times Number One,
Wall Street Journal,

1687
01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:42.310
and the brainstorming.

1688
01:45:42.311 --> 01:45:45.070
A lot of it took place with designers from around the world,

1689
01:45:45.130 --> 01:45:49.840
and here's how it works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,
a website,

1690
01:45:50.140 --> 01:45:52.390
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

1691
01:45:52.630 --> 01:45:56.110
you submit that project and designers from around the world,

1692
01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:58.750
we'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

1693
01:45:59.020 --> 01:46:02.470
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

1694
01:46:02.471 --> 01:46:04.180
money back.
It's that straight forward.

1695
01:46:04.510 --> 01:46:07.870
And many of you who are listening have already used it and created some amazing

1696
01:46:07.871 --> 01:46:10.270
things that I'll be sharing in the future.
But in the meantime,
