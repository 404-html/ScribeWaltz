00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.300
I guys,
Tim Ferriss here want to to talk about cheat days.

2
00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:06.840
So after writing the four hour body,
get a lot of questions about cheat days.

3
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:11.040
Do I still do them?
What are the components of a successful cheat day?

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.350
Why do a cheat day and how do people make mistakes?

5
00:00:14.351 --> 00:00:16.590
What are the most common mistakes people make with Cheetos?

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.120
Let me lay it all out.
So do I still do cheat days?
Yes I do.
I love two days.

7
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:24.570
A lot of bear claws would love ice cream.
I love chocolate croissants.

8
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.170
The list goes on.
These are all things that I really enjoy.

9
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.160
And the purpose of cheat day is multifold.
Number one,

10
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.740
let's just say 90 out of 100 people at least will cheat on a diet.

11
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.050
So if you know you're going to cheat,

12
00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:45.780
you can limit the damage by scheduling it in advance.

13
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.890
And this is the purpose of a cheat day.
And when you have a cheat day,

14
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.600
this digs into one of the mistakes that people make that is one week cycle.

15
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.400
It is not 24 hours.

16
00:00:56.401 --> 00:01:01.401
So at some people like to do is they'll start at say eight or 9:00 PM one day

17
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:06.310
and go until nine,
10:00 PM the next day.
Uh,

18
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.020
that is going to increase the amount of fat you store and the damage that you
do.

19
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.620
So you want to limit the consumption period.
In other words,

20
00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:18.140
from when you wake up to when you go to sleep,
it's one sleep cycle.
All right?

21
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.500
So there's the psychological benefit and the adherence improvement.

22
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:23.334
What does this mean?

23
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.390
If you're looking at a diet or you're looking at any type of behavioral change,

24
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:31.320
you're looking at,
say a method for quitting smoking.
It doesn't matter.

25
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:36.060
Any type of behavioral change.
There are really three,
I would say,

26
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.050
legs to the stool.
And in order of importance,
in my mind,

27
00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:44.010
they are adherence.
Are you actually going to follow the program?

28
00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:46.590
It doesn't matter how good the program is,
if you don't follow it.

29
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:50.550
So the good program that you follow is better than the perfect program that you

30
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:52.770
don't.
This is where,
for instance,

31
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.270
strict Paleo and strict veganism often fail.

32
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.890
And,
uh,
uh,

33
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.950
I get a lot of flack from experts on the Internet experts very often,

34
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.060
uh,
who will say,
well,
you should just have people go strict Paleo.

35
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:12.180
I can't believe you have beans.
People's intestines are going to explode.

36
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.800
You can't have them eat legumes.

37
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.550
And then the vegans go crazy in their own way and they say everybody should be

38
00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:17.971
Vegan.

39
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:22.971
And the issue there is a strict people on either side that I'm doing you a favor

40
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.900
because it is a Trojan horse.

41
00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:32.901
The slow carb diet as described in the four hour body gets more people to say

42
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:37.110
strict Paleo than probably any direct approach.
Why?

43
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.640
Because when I surveyed more than and tracked more than 2000 people,

44
00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:44.460
I think it was more than 2,500 who followed the slow carb diet.

45
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.140
More than 50% said that it was the first diet they're able to stick with

46
00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:51.420
consistently.
This is the key.

47
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.900
So it doesn't matter if you're strict Paleo for a week and then go back to

48
00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:58.820
eating hohos and,
and drinking double gulps.
All right.

49
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.080
And uh,
same for any diet,
but if you are,

50
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.050
say even 80% or 90%,
uh,

51
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.770
to the letter with slow carb,

52
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.620
you will see tremendous benefits and fat loss.

53
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.970
And this is where if you look how to lose,
if you look up on search,

54
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.990
uh,
Z,
Google how to lose a hundred pounds on this low carb diet,

55
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:23.020
you will see a number of case studies and I've met dozens of people who've lost

56
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:25.660
a hundred,
200 pounds.
All right?

57
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.670
And that is why even though I experiment a lot with ketosis or it's people ask

58
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:32.980
me,
do you follow us low carb or Ketogenic Diet?

59
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.810
I generally recommend a slow carb.

60
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:38.560
I generally follow slow card because if you get it primarily right,

61
00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:43.030
you still see benefits with ketosis.
If you are slightly off,

62
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.380
you eat too many elements,

63
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:48.430
you eat slightly too much of carbohydrate load and you knock yourself out of

64
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:48.881
ketosis.

65
00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:53.881
All of a sudden you're just eating an a say 70% fat diet with a high glucose

66
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:58.960
level and you're screwed.
Okay,
so it's a very binary,
uh,
now,

67
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.190
so we have adherence.
Are you going to follow the program?
Number one,

68
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.460
I want to have the highest compliance rate,

69
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.960
the highest conversion rate in terms of behavioral change for say every hundred

70
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:14.290
people.
I look at the percentage of people who are going to follow it.
Number one,

71
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.430
adherence.
Number two,
is it effective?
Does it produce the,

72
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.270
the goals that you want or the,
the results that you want?

73
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:25.900
And then efficient is that making use of resources and your time in an efficient

74
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:30.820
manner.
All right.
Cheek Day limits the damage of cheating,

75
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.240
which is inevitable for most people.

76
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.410
And I'm not talking about somebody who's won the crossfit games five times.

77
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.930
Those are mutants.
Sure they can,
they can eat,

78
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.350
say sweet potatoes and chicken breasts and lentils all day,

79
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:50.110
every day forever because their freak shows.
Uh,
but the majority of people,

80
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:53.650
not true.
All right?
Biochemically,
uh,

81
00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:55.540
it is also very helpful,

82
00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.430
at least based on the data I have seen to spike your caloric load.

83
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.490
So you have one big Bolus of carbohydrate and calorie overload for a short

84
00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:08.290
period of time too.
For instance,

85
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:12.040
prevent your thyroid production from downregulating.
Uh,

86
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:15.970
which if just by virtue of selecting different food on this low carb diet,

87
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.200
if you are,
say a sub maintenance calories,
is very,

88
00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:25.201
very helpful for ensuring that you don't decrease your rate of cellular

89
00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:30.160
metabolism and also natively affect hormone balance like testosterone
production.

90
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.100
Okay.
Uh,
this is also why,
for instance,

91
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:36.400
if you're a ketogenic diet nerd and you're trying to gain muscle mass,

92
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.430
it's very helpful to have a carbohydrate loading day.

93
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.090
And this could be the anabolic diet from a Moro Depasquale,
uh,

94
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.580
or a Dan Duchaine had a similar diet.

95
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:53.560
There are a number of different variations wherein you are provoking insulin

96
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:57.470
response once a week because it is an anabolic hormone.
Now,

97
00:05:57.471 --> 00:06:00.170
overdosing on insulin obviously has its own issues,

98
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.030
but there are ways that you can say be to genic for five days,
Monday to Friday,

99
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.950
do a glycogen depletion workout on Saturday,

100
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:10.610
and then start force feeding yourself with carbohydrates that will be

101
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:12.740
preferentially stored as glycogen.

102
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.940
This would mean a very simple sugars.
I mean,
glucose.
And so,

103
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:20.360
and you're not going to want to go for say,
fructose,
uh,

104
00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:22.340
and things that slow down that uptake.

105
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.610
But you can read more about that some other time,
but cheat days also,

106
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:28.840
biochemically,
the point I'm making are beneficial.
Uh,

107
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.980
and the third point,
okay,
putting aside the,

108
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.100
containing the damage,
putting aside the biochemical reason,

109
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:38.660
if we're just looking at adherence,

110
00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:41.540
how do I get someone to follow us low carb diet for six months?

111
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.190
I do it by giving them a cheat day so they don't follow a strict,
strict,

112
00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:49.190
strict diet for two weeks,
quit and then have a cheat month.

113
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.370
This is why people who've never lost weight before lose a hundred,

114
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:57.230
200 pounds or Ken.
And it's not uncommon at all.
All right.

115
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.370
What are some common mistakes?
So the first one I already touched on.

116
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.320
One way you can screw up a cheat day and make it harder to recover from because

117
00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:09.140
very typically,
let's just say if you're choosing Saturday's your cheat day,

118
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.350
which a lot of people call Saturday,
then uh,

119
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.290
you will retain a lot of water for the next few days and generally be back to

120
00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:22.340
your Friday.
Wait on say Tuesday.

121
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.180
And then you will see the scale and the scale is a blunt instrument.

122
00:07:26.181 --> 00:07:27.680
I encourage you to use say,

123
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.300
a Dexa scan or at least a seven point skin caliper for tracking fat loss and

124
00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:38.420
body composition.
Not just a scale,
it's a very blunt instrument.

125
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:42.890
But if we're looking at the total your weight cheat on,
on Saturday,

126
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.800
you retain a bunch of water,
okay?
You get to about Tuesday,

127
00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:47.540
get back to your Friday,
wait,

128
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.450
and then for a few days you continue to see a decrease,

129
00:07:50.451 --> 00:07:52.630
which is decreasing body fat.
Uh,

130
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.750
sometimes that is mass because you're gaining muscle at the same time.

131
00:07:56.751 --> 00:08:00.410
This is very prevalent with women who get frustrated is they're not tracking

132
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:03.260
body fat or body composition,
the tracking the scale.

133
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:08.590
So this is a Meta problem that is particularly an issue with women who have been

134
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:13.820
unfortunately brainwashed and,
uh,
led to really focus on the scale.

135
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.720
But you're going to be gaining muscle because generally you'll be consuming more

136
00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:21.680
protein than,
uh,
with prior diets.
Okay?

137
00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:24.080
So number one is,
uh,

138
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:28.220
we talked about limiting it to a wake cycle,
right?
Number one.

139
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:29.600
Number two,

140
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.840
are you doing anything to Blunt Your Insulin or glucose response?

141
00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:36.620
And Trust me,
it's going to spike anyway.

142
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.900
But are you doing anything to mitigate the damage?

143
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:42.110
So the damage control chapter in the four hour body,
very important.

144
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:47.450
One of the things that I will very frequently do is I will have a small healthy

145
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:49.550
breakfast.
It could be primarily vegetables.

146
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.890
It will almost always have a decent fiber.

147
00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:55.440
So it could be a small amount of spinach saying with a little bit of you could

148
00:08:55.441 --> 00:09:00.080
just eat some lentil straight out of the can or doll.
Uh,
and Chile,

149
00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:00.841
it doesn't really matter,

150
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:05.640
but something that is going to blunt your cortisol and that Cortisol,

151
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.740
glucose and insulin response,
uh,

152
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:12.150
then throughout the day,
okay.
On top of that,

153
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:15.960
let's just say you have Kathy and plus a little bit of grapefruit juice.

154
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.471
All right?

155
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:19.440
So I'm not going to get it into a neural engine in and how that interacts as a

156
00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:23.820
component or a compound within a group for juice and how it interacts with

157
00:09:23.821 --> 00:09:28.560
coffee.
But suffice to say,
you will be expelling let's say more calories.

158
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:33.590
If you combine those two and you also can use fructose is the sugar in the fruit

159
00:09:35.101 --> 00:09:37.890
in small doses to help blunt your,

160
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.860
again Lucas and insulin spikes,
right this,

161
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:45.070
this will decrease the amount of fat that you store.
And my prep,

162
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.630
my preferred method here is freshly squeezed grapefruit juice cause it's

163
00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:51.720
delicious.
A little bit of that say half cup or a cup is cheat day.

164
00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:55.410
So go crazy if you want and then have coffee very shortly thereafter.

165
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.370
And then that's what I'm going to go nuts.
All right,
so we have small meal,

166
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.800
which is going to be fiber,
a fiber heavy,

167
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.580
then you're going to have caffeine.
It's an,

168
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:09.990
it's an optional but say caffeine plus a little bit of fructose.
Uh,

169
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.770
if you're following the four hour body prescription and you will would also take

170
00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:17.610
pag during this period.
So that is uh,
for the,

171
00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:22.590
for the meals before bed,
you're looking at Alpha lipoic acid,
garlic,
garlic,

172
00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:27.570
which I believe is Alison extract.
And then green tea extract.
A,

173
00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:28.920
you're not going to want to take that before bed,

174
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:32.250
but you're gonna take those prior to meals to minimize the damage.

175
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.710
Other things that can be helpful.

176
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.130
So we talked about the basics are Berberine,

177
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.860
and I'll let you guys look that up.
B,
e.

178
00:10:40.861 --> 00:10:45.380
R.
B.
E.
R.
I.
N.
E.
Berberine.
Very,
very interesting.
Uh,

179
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.420
and if you have,
uh,
if you are talking to your medical doctor,

180
00:10:49.421 --> 00:10:53.970
and this is only for use in consult with a medical doctor,
a,

181
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.570
you can sometimes get something called Akar boasts a,

182
00:10:56.620 --> 00:11:01.620
which can also minimize your glucose response to foods of this time.

183
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.860
All right.
The,
the,

184
00:11:04.861 --> 00:11:09.861
I would say most common mistake that people make aside from going splitting it

185
00:11:11.131 --> 00:11:15.450
over two days is restraint.
Okay?
What does this mean?

186
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.780
This means you say,
okay,
I'm going to cheat.
I'm only going to have a cheat.

187
00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.190
I'm going to have one sheet sandwich or I'm going to cheat,

188
00:11:21.191 --> 00:11:23.600
but I'm going to cheat with Rice.
Uh,

189
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.450
and the cheating clean can be done.
And again,

190
00:11:27.451 --> 00:11:32.451
there are mutants for whom this is enough of a release valve that that can keep

191
00:11:34.951 --> 00:11:38.520
them on the stricter diet during the week.
For most folks,

192
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:43.020
if you don't have a real cheat day,
meaning eat whatever the hell you want,

193
00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:46.560
drink whatever the hell you want.
Uh,
if you don't do that,

194
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.990
you're going to cheat later in the week.
Why?

195
00:11:48.991 --> 00:11:52.140
Because you didn't scratch that itch.
And in fact,

196
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:55.690
and I'm not saying we're not aiming for bulemia or anything like that here,

197
00:11:55.691 --> 00:12:00.691
but I will deliberately try to eat to the point where it makes me a little

198
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:06.280
uncomfortable,
a little sick,
okay?
And I've gotten a lot of flack for this too,

199
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.390
but trust me,
it works.

200
00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:12.220
After tracking and watching thousands and thousands of people do this,

201
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.890
if you half ass cheat date,
you're going to cheat again.

202
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:19.660
And that defeats the whole purpose.
All right?
So really go for the gold.

203
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.670
And uh,
what you'll find is very often at the end of cheat day,

204
00:12:24.671 --> 00:12:28.330
you will be dying to get back to your regular slow carb diet.

205
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.420
You're clean diet and over time,
very often,

206
00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:35.310
naturally you will start to cut back on cheat day.
Uh,

207
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.980
but in the beginning phases,
particularly when you're establishing this habit,

208
00:12:38.981 --> 00:12:42.640
this routine,
you want to go for the Golden Cheat Day,
right?
You don't have,

209
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.940
you shouldn't actually vomit.
You're not going for that.
Okay?
So there's a,

210
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:50.620
there's a goldilocks point,
but it's like,
okay,
if I'm still hungry,

211
00:12:50.621 --> 00:12:55.480
I'm still Jonesing for junk food.
Amen.
Have another kit Kat.
You know,

212
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.490
have another croissant,
have another,

213
00:12:57.491 --> 00:13:00.310
whatever the hell it is that you're Jonesing for.
Have some more ice cream.

214
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.270
And I really don't have assets.
So if you see me on cheat day,

215
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:08.700
every girl I've ever dated has been disgusted by the display of gluttony.
Uh,

216
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:12.970
there's has,
don't cheat day and I love it.
So there we go.
Uh,

217
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:17.350
the next mistake that people make is thinking to themselves,
well,

218
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:22.960
if one sleep cycle is,
or a one sleep cycle,

219
00:13:22.961 --> 00:13:27.340
and then one week cycle is where I'm going to focus my cheat day on,

220
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.910
why don't I just do that twice a week?

221
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.840
So instead of doing say 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM,

222
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.930
I'm going to do 8:00 AM to noon one day,

223
00:13:37.931 --> 00:13:41.590
and then I'm going to do maybe half a day,
some other day during the week.

224
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.700
This will almost always,
from what I've observed,
lead to more fat gain,

225
00:13:45.701 --> 00:13:50.380
less progress than otherwise.
All right?
So if it's cheat day,

226
00:13:50.381 --> 00:13:55.060
cheat day,
then you want to focus it within one week cycle.

227
00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:00.040
I recommend a Saturday for social reasons because very often if you make it,

228
00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:03.760
say a Wednesday could be a Friday for some people,
then they'll go out,

229
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:06.820
they'll have a bunch of booze on the weekend and they'll end up eating pizza or

230
00:14:06.821 --> 00:14:10.540
some other crap.
Anyway,
all right,
don't get to cheat days.

231
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.750
One Cheat Day.
That is it.
Now,

232
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:18.910
if your goal is not primarily fat loss and is masking,

233
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:22.990
instead there are approaches and this is more advanced.

234
00:14:22.991 --> 00:14:27.550
So you want to get a couple of months look arm under your belt first where you

235
00:14:27.551 --> 00:14:32.530
could follow,
say a ketogenic diet or a slow carb diet and then spike,

236
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:37.330
uh,
say for one meal on a Wednesday with something like brown rice.

237
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:41.500
And then again on Saturday.
Okay.
But in less,

238
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:45.010
you have saint less than 10% body fat.
Not Allowed to do that.

239
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.710
Generally Charles polycom would say,

240
00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.950
if you don't have penis skin on your abs and not allowed eat carbs after your

241
00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:54.440
workout and you're certainly not allowed to have two chief.

242
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.820
So it's crass as that is pretty good guideline.
All right,
so that's one.

243
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.640
And uh,
those are,

244
00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:06.641
I would say the most common mistakes that I've observed in cheat days.

245
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:12.050
And there are those people out there would say no cheat days.

246
00:15:12.051 --> 00:15:13.820
Crazy.
You should have a cheat meal.
Well,

247
00:15:13.821 --> 00:15:18.680
is a cheat meal going to scratch the Itch for you in your heart of hearts well

248
00:15:18.681 --> 00:15:23.360
enough so that you are not going to cheat at all later in the week?
Yes or no?

249
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:27.290
The answer from most people is no.
All right.

250
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:32.590
And whenever I get some diet guru or self proclaimed

251
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:40.430
leader of some cult who comes out to attack me because it's low carb,
legumes,

252
00:15:40.431 --> 00:15:42.560
oh my God,
lentils,
they're going to make your head explode.

253
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.590
You're going to give yourself auto immune disorder.
Look,
there's some people,
yes,

254
00:15:45.591 --> 00:15:48.140
if you've already had a diagnosed issue with these things,

255
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:51.920
you probably shouldn't need them for the vast majority,
you're fucking fine.
Okay.

256
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:56.060
And uh,
whenever someone gives you a very strong opinion,

257
00:15:56.061 --> 00:15:59.360
you should ask them where are your data,

258
00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.280
what evidence do you have?

259
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:05.030
And at this point for our body came out seven years ago,

260
00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:10.420
seven years of watching hundreds of thousands of readers go through this.

261
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:15.830
And I would encourage everybody to check out the basics of this low carb diet.

262
00:16:15.831 --> 00:16:18.740
If you haven't checked it out before,
I'm not going to get into it right now.

263
00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.240
You can find it for free.

264
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.450
Just look up how to lose a hundred pounds on this low carb diet.

265
00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:26.150
And it'll pop right up with all the basic guidelines.

266
00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.780
And then if you really want to get into the nitty gritty two chapters in the

267
00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:34.781
four hour body that I would recommend everybody check out or a slow carb diet

268
00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.110
chapter two,

269
00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.110
which really gets into some of the nitty gritty details and little things you

270
00:16:39.111 --> 00:16:41.900
can tweak that make a big difference.
And then damage control,

271
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:46.280
which is basically an expanded version of how to minimize the fact gain.

272
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.250
Even if in some cases I kid you not,

273
00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:54.530
you could consume and I have consumed say 10,000 plus calories in a day and then

274
00:16:54.531 --> 00:16:58.880
clocked in with lower body fat a few days later then prior to the cheat day.

275
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.670
So how does that work while I already give you some of the tools,

276
00:17:01.671 --> 00:17:05.630
but for the 15 or 20 pages that really,
really get into this,

277
00:17:05.631 --> 00:17:07.520
I think it's around that could be shorter.
Uh,

278
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:09.290
you can go to the four hour body and check it out.

279
00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.940
So that's where our body.com all spelled out or just go to Amazon or whatever

280
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:18.080
other fine book retail and you can check it out.
Hopefully that helps.

281
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:20.750
But Cheat Day,
I still stand by it.
Sorry,

282
00:17:20.751 --> 00:17:24.980
slow carb still stand by it completely.
And uh,

283
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:30.010
hopefully those tips and recommendations help you to a joy more.

284
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.070
Succeed more on whichever day you choose,

285
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:39.640
suffer less and gain less fat and lose more fat.

286
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:45.050
So enjoy guys.
Thanks for watching.
If you enjoyed this video,

287
00:17:45.051 --> 00:17:48.190
I want to propose you check out the podcast,
the Tim Ferriss Shell.

288
