1
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.240
So what does Tim Ferriss do at two in the morning besides drink Portuguese,

2
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:11.970
white wine and watch the Bourne identity for the 157th time.

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.200
He does pen tricks,
which is what he does all the time as his own fidget.

4
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.580
So nef is talking in third person.
Let's check out some Hendrix.

5
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.650
So we're going to do these roughly in order of difficulty,

6
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.170
but it may be slightly out of order.
All right,

7
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:32.430
so this is called the helicopter.

8
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.271
Pretty obvious.

9
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:38.271
I'm just going to give you a little showcase of of things that come first so you

10
00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:43.691
can get a pretty good idea of what's possible just by looking at that.

11
00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:51.501
So helicopter is so named because of the emotion and just like that.

12
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:55.170
And I recommend you use a big,
because it's,

13
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:59.710
it's relatively well balanced and a the right diameter.
Okay.

14
00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:04.380
So what we're doing here is pushing us down so that the thumb,

15
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.960
that middle finger is at the very center of the pen in the back and the thumb is

16
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:13.950
about one thumb width away from the center on top,
right?

17
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.450
The top of the thumb,

18
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.280
meaning the part that's parallel to the ground there is going to be parallel to

19
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:22.030
the ground.
And uh,

20
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.760
here I'm pushing the pen into both my index and middle finger and then I'm

21
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:31.761
essentially snapping these two and spins across the back of my thumb,

22
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.490
like so.
And you can do that all day long.
And uh,

23
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.270
that's probably the most common that you'll see in Japan and Taiwan and the

24
00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:45.570
really good kids.
We'll do it one way and then knock it back the other way.

25
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:49.920
I can't do that.
All right,
so the drummer so named,

26
00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:54.150
because you'll see guys like Tommy Lee do that.
All right.

27
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.760
Now if you look at it from that angle,

28
00:01:56.761 --> 00:01:59.670
it looks like it's going up and down and it looks very cool.

29
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.260
If you look at it from the front,
it's actually just that,

30
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:07.500
that emotion.
So really what I'm doing is

31
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.270
moving the top two fingers back and forth as this spins right in front of the

32
00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:18.480
first knuckle.
Like so.
And the way you,

33
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.850
that's been started as I'm pulling down with my index finger.

34
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:26.550
So the middle finger is basically a brace pushing down at the top finger and

35
00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:30.420
then I'm catching the back of the pen and this little web and then as soon as I

36
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:31.650
pull this back,

37
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.700
it gets that initial spin and then you keep it going with these two fingers,

38
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.620
it looks pretty cool.
All right.
Then we have,
uh,

39
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.100
I suppose what I would call the,
uh,
the pincher.

40
00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:46.860
And the reason I'm going to call that none of these things have names as far as

41
00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:50.670
I know,
it looks like that.
And the reason I call it the pincher,

42
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.190
it's very hard to see what this motion is.

43
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.840
This is actually the first one I learned,

44
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:59.841
but one of the hardest is the same motion that I'm using to get that Tommy Lee

45
00:03:00.541 --> 00:03:01.374
spin started.

46
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.890
But it's in between my middle of my ring finger and as it con,

47
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.030
as it flips through,

48
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.690
I'm going to catch it in between my index and my ring finger.

49
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:15.370
So it looks like that and then it swings behind and I catch it back in this

50
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:20.350
position.
So it looks like this
like that very slowly.
Okay.

51
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:24.130
That's what it looks like faster.
That makes sense.
Okay.

52
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.880
And you can either push down here or you can do it on the thumb itself and

53
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.440
that's what it looks like.
And when you get better at it,

54
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.010
you can do it from different positions.
You can start here for example

55
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.170
like that and then go up more.
Or you can even,

56
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:44.050
it's a little hard to do looking through the camera.
So I just jumped.

57
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:48.370
I just skipped these two fingers and went from here to here.
All right,

58
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:50.500
so you can get tricky with it.
All right.

59
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.060
The the wheel was what I'll call this one here with one of the,

60
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.550
one of the easier ones again,
and then you can mix it all together.
Uh,

61
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.070
really all you're doing is I'm pushing off of the,

62
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:05.650
the thumb here between these two fingers and it's pulling,

63
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:10.651
it's doing a straight circle through like that and you end up in this somewhat

64
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.720
awkward position.
Then you can segway into a different mood.

65
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.010
So it looks like that,
we'll just call that the wheel.

66
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.830
That's probably the easiest.
And you'll see that I'm just pushing it down.

67
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.150
And then this very familiar pushing with the middle finger,

68
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.730
pretty similar to how we started the last move.

69
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.320
Instead of going in a circle like that,
we're going in a,

70
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.730
we're pushing down on the top of the thumb so it's further extended on the

71
00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:40.690
fingertips coming straight back like a wheel.
All right.

72
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.590
And then the last one that we'll have is what I'll call the flip and pretty self

73
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:51.890
explanatory.
It looks like that though.

74
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.580
Now that sound you just heard,
you will hear thousands and thousands of times.

75
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.640
Oh,
all right,
well so much for ending with a flourish,

76
00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:08.530
but it uh,
it looks like that and the better you get,

77
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:12.970
you can actually keep your hand flat on a table and flip it and catch it without

78
00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:15.250
moving your hand at all like that.
Right?

79
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:18.670
So that'd be a flip in the way you do that.
Again,
the same motion,

80
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.000
but you're going to be flicking out with your,

81
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:25.420
with your ring finger to get the extension.
So it goes away from your hand.

82
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:28.210
It's going to rotate falling and it's going to land right here in the riding

83
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:32.890
position
like that.
Right?

84
00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:36.260
And then you put it all together.
You can do all sorts of fancy stuff.

85
00:05:36.261 --> 00:05:39.890
So I could do a wheel to the penser

86
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:42.310
helicopter,

87
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.020
to the Tommy Lee and so forth and so on.
You just,

88
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.290
we'll get to the point where you'll do this while reading a newspaper and it'll

89
00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:52.120
drive everybody.
Absolutely.

90
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.810
Apeshit so have fun.

91
00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.450
If you don't have OCD already,
this will give it to you.
Signing off.
