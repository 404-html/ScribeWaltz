00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.340
Aubrey,
Marcus,
welcome to the show.
What's up to him?
Hey Man,

2
00:00:02.341 --> 00:00:04.380
I'm going to shake your hand cause I don't usually do a video.

3
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.540
And here we are in the Shanghai of Texas,
otherwise known as Austin.

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.740
I've never seen so many cranes in one place in the United States.

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.510
Yeah,
it's thriving.

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.770
It is really thriving and I think we're on the cusp of all sorts of fun in the

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.010
next couple of years.
I like it.
People whine about it like,
Oh,
you know,

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.540
Austin used to be this kind of reminiscing fantasy thing.

9
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.330
I think it's just getting better.
Well I think it's uh,

10
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.890
it's like talking to someone who went to a concert in the early days with any

11
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.920
man.
They're like burning man used to be so cool man.

12
00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:39.660
The 2007 before you got here in 2008,
grateful dead.
I was at their first show.

13
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.060
Now it's so on.
Cool.
So there's,

14
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:45.120
there's a lot of discussion along those lines about Austin,

15
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.150
but you are one of the people I know best here in Austin.

16
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.980
Yup.
And I'm thrilled to have you in front of the mic.

17
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.720
It gets gradually came out dope,

18
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.010
hang out and have some wine and have some dinner and I know I'm not impressing

19
00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:02.970
anyone with my 45 pound deadlifts and the Ana gym.
You have a lot.
No,

20
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:04.500
but it's your persistence though to him.

21
00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:09.290
It's the fact that you do it so many times and only do that.
Ooh,
wow,

22
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.150
that's true.
We'll,
last time you saw me in that gym,

23
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.030
I was working on a program from Jersey Gregorich,

24
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.060
the 63 year old former world record holder in Olympic weightlifting doing only

25
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.330
overhead squats.
If I remember crying for like an hour and a half old all day,

26
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.920
let's Tim do it.
No more overhead squat.

27
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.470
So part of the reason I wanted to have you here to have this conversation is

28
00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:36.471
that I feel like you are one of the people who really walks the walk in checking

29
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.120
the boxes of these overlapping spheres of life.

30
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.530
Whether that is body business,
let's just call it balance.

31
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.960
I'm actually barring this bit from a weekend event.

32
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.930
One of my friends went to not too long ago,
but you,

33
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.960
you've done a really good job of integrating those various pieces.

34
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.830
And so this format of this particular podcast is going to be a bit experimental

35
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.430
and jarring maybe,
and it's lack of transitions.

36
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.250
But I want to start with a question.

37
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.280
I was recently asked at a small dinner and the question was posed by a guy named

38
00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:14.310
Michael Hubs,
who's fascinating guy,
very good chef,

39
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.120
organizes dinners around specific topics very often.
So he did one,

40
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:22.020
I think it was called dinner or dining with death and it was in cooperation with

41
00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:25.890
NPR and it was a facilitated conversation around mortality.

42
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.020
And he's done many of these and had a small dinner with him in La with about six

43
00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:35.490
to eight people and no one really knew any other attendee.

44
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.420
And to break the ice,
he started with this question,

45
00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:43.560
which just opened up the flood gates so that everyone got very vulnerable and

46
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:47.040
very open very quickly.
And this is it.
So thank you Michael.

47
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.050
When is the last time that you cried tears of joy that you remember?

48
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.210
Oh Man.
[inaudible] that wasn't too long ago.
That's,
that's a,

49
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.980
a more frequent occurrence for me actually.
And as

50
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.910
<v 1>I've done,
you know,</v>

51
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:05.140
a lot of work on my life and it hasn't been the external stuff that ever makes

52
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:07.540
me cry.
Tears of joy.
It's not a big on that success.

53
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:11.860
It's not something external that happens.
It's really just sitting in a moment.

54
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:15.820
It can be with the lover that I'm sharing a night with and I'll just start

55
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:16.391
crying.

56
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:21.250
And just the experience of enjoying that simple moment or laughing with friends

57
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:22.210
or,
I mean,

58
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.010
it's actually a rather frequent occurrence and that's one of the best indicators

59
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:31.750
for me that the path that I'm on is yielding the kind of fruit that I'm really

60
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:35.710
looking for and looking to forge because I catch myself doing that all the time.

61
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:40.060
I actually today I had a little informal mentorship with one of my employees and

62
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:44.050
just as I saw that breakthrough moment,
I saw that moment where,
you know,

63
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.730
I was talking about her working not on her business and not on her career at on

64
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:51.580
it,
but on her heart and how that,
and she's like,
yeah,
it's a big project.

65
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:53.320
And I go,
yeah,
it is a big project.

66
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:57.100
And I saw that light come up and just the tears will come in that moment for me

67
00:03:57.101 --> 00:03:59.980
too.
It's just like,
fuck yeah.
You know,
like I'm,
I'm,

68
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.960
I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing.

69
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.990
And then just the gratitude for being able to do what I'm supposed to be doing,

70
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.700
it'll just,
it'll come.

71
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.290
<v 0>Is that something that has always been the case or is that something that has</v>

72
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:15.790
become more frequent with any kind of trigger or catalyst?

73
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.810
<v 1>It's uh,
it was very rare.
You know,</v>

74
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:23.230
I think it was very rare cause I think most of my life I was trying to achieve

75
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:26.800
something.
I was trying to validate myself externally,
trying to say,

76
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:30.820
if I get to this point,
then I'll be successful.
Then I'll be,
you know,

77
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.830
living up to my potential,
then I'll be that.

78
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:35.130
And whether it was in high school for basketball,
like,
Oh,

79
00:04:35.131 --> 00:04:37.870
if I make all state honors,
then I'll be there.

80
00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:40.030
If we make it far in the playoffs and it'll be there.

81
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:43.600
And it was always this next thing,
but it's never the next thing.

82
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:45.310
You can keep searching for that next thing.

83
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.580
You're not going to find it until you turn that gaze truly inward.

84
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.800
And as that process has gone,

85
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.340
and I've almost kind of exhausted the external things,

86
00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:56.860
so it's kind of forced me to go internal because when on it was successful in

87
00:04:56.861 --> 00:05:01.720
the external was great then and I still wasn't that happy deeply.

88
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.800
And I was like,
all right,
it's definitely not external.
This is internal.

89
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.890
And that's driven me deeper and deeper inside my heart.

90
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.940
<v 0>If I look back at my own experience with,
uh,</v>

91
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.550
relationships with people who have unfortunately taking their lives,

92
00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:22.551
it's not the depressing outwardly depressing cases that you would expect.

93
00:05:22.951 --> 00:05:27.570
It's actually very often the people who have a lot of money,
not always,
uh,

94
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.400
certainly.
But it strikes me that for instance,
one of my best friends,

95
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.550
uh,
Andrea in high school,

96
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.810
then two friends later in college,
uh,

97
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.590
seem to have everything going for them.
And of course,
I shouldn't say of course,

98
00:05:43.591 --> 00:05:47.520
but nobody saw these coming and they were,

99
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.290
they all had a good amount of money.

100
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.350
And my theory related to that based on what I see also in people who are from

101
00:05:56.191 --> 00:06:00.890
the outside in very,
very successful,
very,
very wealthy but miserable,

102
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.000
is that for a long time,
for most of life,

103
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:08.750
if you're fighting for every scrap to get this external validation,

104
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.620
you can envision a day when I have x,

105
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.340
it'll all be great.
And this anxiety,

106
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:19.880
I feel this fill in the blank that I feel will go away and then it doesn't go

107
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:23.240
away.
And so then at that point,
if you've checked the boxes,

108
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.650
it seems like you can lose hope or if you grow up rich and you realize it does

109
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:30.410
not in fact as a panacea soldier prompts.
So my question then,

110
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.300
walk us through how you shifted your gaze to be more internal.
Because I've,

111
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.090
I've seen that in,
you may have known each other that long.

112
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:40.700
We've known each other for a while and

113
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.940
I'd love to just hear how you made the decision or how you were forced to look

114
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.120
inward because a lot of people get to a point where the outside world,

115
00:06:52.361 --> 00:06:55.510
third parties would think of them as successful,
but they never shift the gays.

116
00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:00.710
<v 1>Yeah.
So,
so how did it happen?
It's in combination from like external pressure,</v>

117
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.780
you know,
external pain,
internal pain,

118
00:07:02.781 --> 00:07:06.830
like pain as a motivator to let you know that something is wrong.

119
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.680
And then so that's kind of like your engine light blinking.

120
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.060
And then it's the practices that I've employed that helped me have that

121
00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:16.940
introspection to actually go searching and figure out what it is.

122
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:22.030
So it's always been a combination of that pain plus the tools to go seek out

123
00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:25.400
where that pain is coming from.
And I was fortunate,

124
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.750
I was given an opportunity to do a vision quest when I was just out of high

125
00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:34.190
school and I was staunch atheist,
zero spirituality.
How did that come?

126
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.850
That was through my father and I had had a lot of issues with my dad,

127
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:41.870
but he was in a lot of pain himself and that it took an him down,
you know,

128
00:07:41.871 --> 00:07:46.310
to try everything from primal therapy to all kinds of different conventional

129
00:07:46.311 --> 00:07:48.230
methods.
Eventually into psychedelics.

130
00:07:48.231 --> 00:07:51.770
Working with actually with Stan Groff doing holotropic breathing,

131
00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:56.771
doing LSD psychotherapy doing and he found a shaman who worked with silicide

132
00:07:57.531 --> 00:07:59.540
been in the mountains and you know,
where was this?

133
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.670
This was in the mountains in New Mexico and he after high school in that

134
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.450
traditional kind of vision quest kind of idea said,
you know,

135
00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:11.390
you should go experience this because at that point,
you know,

136
00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:15.440
he would talk about anything on the fringe of spirituality and I'd grown up here

137
00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:19.310
in Texas and getting washed with religion,
capital r religion.
I was like,

138
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.250
fuck that.
You Know Dad,
like I'm not interested in that.
Like,

139
00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:25.970
I saw the dungeons of the inquisition.
This is bullshit.
You know,
this is bad.

140
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.140
And he's like,
no,
no,
just check it out and see what happens.
It's a vision quest.

141
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.770
And I respected like,
you know,

142
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:37.010
native American culture enough and traditional culture enough that I was like,

143
00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:40.480
all right,
I'll give it a go.
And I was fucking terrified.
Like,
can you hear us?

144
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:44.420
Can you explain to people who describe what that vision quest entails?

145
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.860
It's kind of,
it's a traditional rite of passage where typically young man,

146
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:53.330
but it can be any men goes to find an aspect of themselves that has been hidden.

147
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:58.110
Some calling,
some of them that they don't know about that they aren't aware of.

148
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.570
And that's certainly what happened.
You know,

149
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:05.550
I was given a t in the mountains in a very isolated place with a very loving and

150
00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:07.290
warm,
um,
you know,

151
00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:10.560
mushroom Sharmane and she gave me a tea.

152
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.800
And then after a little while I felt my entire body evaporate into geometry.

153
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.150
And then I was like,
oh shit.

154
00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.460
Like I got a lot of things wrong.
You know,

155
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.700
like there is something else to this experience.
And that was just this.

156
00:09:26.701 --> 00:09:30.690
I stayed up all night writing and there was thunderstorms and the coyotes

157
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:32.460
howling.
I Dunno,
they sounded like wolves,

158
00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:35.550
but I'm probably coyotes being in New Mexico and,

159
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:40.590
and it was this crazy night of just realizing that my whole paradigm at that

160
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:43.980
point,
it shifted.
I'd realize that I'm not just body and mind.

161
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.480
There's something else that I access,

162
00:09:45.481 --> 00:09:47.700
something that could observe both of those things.

163
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.810
And that's been kind of like the fallback,
you know,

164
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:56.220
teacher for me and finding the ways then to not just use the medicines but find

165
00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:59.700
ways to get there in other means because that's kind of like a feast.

166
00:09:59.701 --> 00:10:00.780
You can't feast every night.

167
00:10:00.781 --> 00:10:03.900
Finding the other ways to access that identification point.

168
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:09.860
So you do not have kids as far as I know at this point that you're aware of.

169
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.600
But if I do have any kids out there and you want to claim it,

170
00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:15.930
like we'll talk about that right now.
I'm going a pretty good spot now.

171
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:19.820
[inaudible]
Dot Com uh,
uh,

172
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.840
when you have,
if and when you have kids,
I'm not sure if that's in the cards,

173
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:29.520
but if you do,
would you walk them through,

174
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:34.260
let's just say you was son doesn't necessarily matter son or daughter,
would you,

175
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.530
would you walk them through or introduce them to a rite of passage like that?

176
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.800
Fuck yeah.
Like they're undoubtedly,
how would you structure it?

177
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.070
What do you think it would look like?
Well,
I think as a parent,
as a dad,

178
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.190
you have to kind of get out of the way because part of the vision quest is

179
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:50.430
getting your kid out of your purview.
Right?
You know,

180
00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:54.480
like allowing them to become their own man.
So I would find someone who is,

181
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:54.751
you know,

182
00:10:54.751 --> 00:10:58.230
separate enough for me that I wasn't influencing the experience in someone I

183
00:10:58.231 --> 00:10:59.230
trusted.
And you know,

184
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.370
I know a lot of people right now and I'm sure I'll know a lot of people even

185
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.130
even then and talking to,
you know,

186
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.420
maps and talking to her after and talking to those organizations that are

187
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:11.430
working on the legalization of these as medicines.

188
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.190
I think there's going to be a lot of cool options,
um,

189
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.860
for people to do that completely above board.

190
00:11:16.861 --> 00:11:19.410
And legally by the time I have a kid,
I mean they're targeting 20,

191
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:23.790
21 for Mgma therapy and psilocybin sometime after that.

192
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.520
So I think there's going to be a lot of options and it's going to become more

193
00:11:26.521 --> 00:11:30.920
common.
And um,
you know,
I'd just send them with someone I really trusted and uh,

194
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.790
allow the process to unfold.
And that's the thing you,

195
00:11:33.791 --> 00:11:35.700
you really don't want to guide it too much.

196
00:11:35.701 --> 00:11:38.370
You want to have the guide and allow the medicine and the,

197
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.760
and nature and everything around them to be the teacher.

198
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.700
I'm sure there are people watching or listening who have had early say,

199
00:11:47.701 --> 00:11:52.350
adolescent or high school or college experiences with psychedelics,
but

200
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.600
viewed them in retrospect is sort of uncontrolled recreational.

201
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.840
So do you think the reason that vision quest stuck with you,

202
00:12:01.841 --> 00:12:06.841
how much of it was the psychedelics versus the ceremony versus the guidance?

203
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.460
I mean,
if you had to try to weight those factors,
how would you,

204
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.040
they're inextricably,
they're inextricable,
right?
You know,

205
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:15.790
like the experience itself blends together and becomes inseparable.

206
00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:19.240
Like you couldn't take one part and have it all be there.
You know,

207
00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:23.500
it was the trust that I had in the guide because I think one of the big problems

208
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:26.800
with taking psychedelics haphazardly like,
am I going to die?
Right.
You know,

209
00:12:26.801 --> 00:12:29.980
is this going to,
am I going to,
am I gonna get busted by the cops?
Is this,
is,

210
00:12:29.981 --> 00:12:32.650
this is right environment?
What does that does that person looking at me funny?

211
00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:33.101
You know,

212
00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:36.940
like all of these crazy things come in and can steer it into really squirly

213
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:37.571
pathways.

214
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:42.370
But having that steady loving presence available and just being out in the land

215
00:12:42.371 --> 00:12:46.450
and having it and knowing that I was part of a lineage that had done this

216
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.390
thousands of times for many,
many generations,

217
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.590
that what gave me the support system to be able to really let go.

218
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.380
Because I think you can really stay tense and fight,
you know,

219
00:12:56.381 --> 00:13:00.130
fight these experiences and you get stories and reports of people taking

220
00:13:00.131 --> 00:13:03.040
incredibly high doses and they're like still so bound up.

221
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:04.780
They can't even release into it.

222
00:13:04.781 --> 00:13:09.730
But having a guide that really you trust is absolutely essential because they're

223
00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:14.470
really guiding you through this massive bursting of a cocoon,

224
00:13:14.471 --> 00:13:17.050
you know,
and it's,
it's pretty terrifying on its own.

225
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:21.430
And having somebody there to help is absolutely essential.
And I only,

226
00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:25.690
I only recommend doing it in that context until you are somewhat of a master

227
00:13:25.691 --> 00:13:27.670
yourself.
Yeah,
agreed.

228
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:31.420
And definitely get external verification that your masters not,

229
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.030
I've been on youtube and I think I understand as well enough.

230
00:13:34.031 --> 00:13:37.270
I'm a black belt now.
Yeah.
Uh,
I watched triple rainbow three times.

231
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.370
I know what bliss is.
Exactly.

232
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:44.650
What did you think you wanted it to be when you grew up when you were 1617,

233
00:13:44.651 --> 00:13:48.130
18?
You know,
I think I really,

234
00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.400
I was always into history and I was,

235
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:55.300
I would look at all the great conquering heroes and the great kings and the

236
00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:58.630
great,
the people who had led these big movements.

237
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.230
And I looked around and obviously,
you know,
Kangaskhan was kind of an asshole,

238
00:14:02.231 --> 00:14:02.471
you know,

239
00:14:02.471 --> 00:14:06.070
I didn't really want to kill people and that's not the way it's happens anymore.

240
00:14:06.071 --> 00:14:09.490
So really the people leading the movements,
you had politicians,

241
00:14:09.491 --> 00:14:12.760
but they didn't seem like they were quite doing anything that I was interested

242
00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:14.910
in.
And then so you had,
you know,

243
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.170
business leaders and thought leaders and authors.

244
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.950
And so I think I always knew I was going to end up in one of those categories,

245
00:14:20.951 --> 00:14:25.810
either leading an organization or a writing books or speaking or something.

246
00:14:25.811 --> 00:14:29.350
And interestingly,
I doubted myself the whole way because I failed that.

247
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.010
Absolutely everything I tried.
And like what,

248
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.990
what did you try that didn't work out?
Literally everything.

249
00:14:34.991 --> 00:14:36.640
I mean I tried gold mining,

250
00:14:36.641 --> 00:14:41.641
I tried some variety of different online retail from sex toys to skincare to I

251
00:14:43.421 --> 00:14:46.450
tried oil and gas.
I tried like,
well on gas,

252
00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:51.260
like trading site invest like um,
investor relations,
you know,

253
00:14:51.261 --> 00:14:55.700
like trying to convince people to go bet on some wildcat fucking oil wells in

254
00:14:55.701 --> 00:14:58.580
the middle of nowhere.
That never works,
you know,

255
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.300
and I'd get some stock options like this one's going to hit,
never hit nothing.

256
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.590
But now looking back,

257
00:15:03.591 --> 00:15:08.591
I'm grateful because I literally failed at everything that wasn't directly going

258
00:15:08.871 --> 00:15:11.270
to serve my purpose.
And all of those failures,

259
00:15:11.271 --> 00:15:15.950
all the lessons gave me the strength to be able to hold an organization of this

260
00:15:15.951 --> 00:15:17.180
magnitude that I'm holding now.

261
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.210
Like the person that I was then couldn't run on it.

262
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.100
Like I couldn't write the book that I wrote.

263
00:15:22.101 --> 00:15:23.810
I couldn't do the things that I'm doing.

264
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.220
I couldn't have this conversation now because my ego would get in the way and

265
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.740
all kinds of things.
I wasn't ready yet.
And so the university was like,
no,

266
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:35.630
not ready,
fail,
fail,
fail,
fail,
fail.
And I was like,
man,
I'm just,

267
00:15:35.631 --> 00:15:38.060
I'm 30 and I've failed at everything.
You know,

268
00:15:38.061 --> 00:15:41.210
I scratched out a little money here and there,
you know,
I was doing all right,

269
00:15:41.211 --> 00:15:44.870
doing better than some of my peers when I would go buy bottles at the club and

270
00:15:44.871 --> 00:15:48.530
party,
like I could buy a more expensive bottle than they could.

271
00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:50.420
And so everybody's like,
yeah,
Aubrey,
you're killing.
I'm like,

272
00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:54.740
I'm not fucking killing it.
I'm like blown it.
And that was,
that was tough.

273
00:15:54.741 --> 00:15:58.880
And then finally it just kind of lined up with the right timing and the right

274
00:15:58.881 --> 00:16:03.140
idea and the right person leading it,
meaning me,
and uh,

275
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:05.330
it was able to come to fruition.
So let's,

276
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.990
let's start with a snapshot of where we are now and then I'm going to go back to

277
00:16:08.991 --> 00:16:13.070
you and your dad and 16 for a second.
Yeah.
So on it,

278
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.760
what is on it?
How many employees do you have?

279
00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.960
What are you proudest of that debt on it has done or is doing?

280
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.470
We have on,
it's,
we call it total human optimization.

281
00:16:24.471 --> 00:16:26.960
So what I realized early on is that you couldn't,

282
00:16:26.961 --> 00:16:29.900
and you mentioned this in the Intro,
like balance,

283
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:35.170
you really can't specialize in only one thing and really reach the potential of

284
00:16:35.901 --> 00:16:38.090
that thing.
You have to support everything else.

285
00:16:38.091 --> 00:16:39.920
Like you can go super hard in one direction,

286
00:16:39.921 --> 00:16:43.340
but your health is going to fall apart,
your relationship's gonna fall apart.

287
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.940
And ultimately that's going to start being,
weight's going to be anchors.

288
00:16:46.941 --> 00:16:51.200
It's gonna drag against your progress and it's going to be a headwind for you in

289
00:16:51.201 --> 00:16:53.450
anything that you're doing.
And it's the same with the body.

290
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.130
Like you can take great supplements,

291
00:16:55.131 --> 00:16:57.770
but if your nutrition is shitty and your workouts are shitty and your sleep is

292
00:16:57.771 --> 00:17:00.800
shitty and your mentality Shitty,
so what?
It's not going to matter.

293
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:05.420
So total human optimization is the idea to raise everything at the same time and

294
00:17:05.421 --> 00:17:10.421
really try to incrementally improve and it's not as flashy and sexy is this 30

295
00:17:10.581 --> 00:17:13.070
day transformation expert in this one area,

296
00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.680
but it really works and it's through to the bone.

297
00:17:15.681 --> 00:17:20.360
And I think that's what I'm probably most proud of is that on it is what it

298
00:17:20.361 --> 00:17:22.220
appears to be like.
You go there,

299
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.420
the people who were there from me to Kyle to everybody's who's in the

300
00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:30.020
organization,
they feel that movement.
The people who follow on it,

301
00:17:30.021 --> 00:17:30.950
they feel that movement.

302
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.120
I think it's just the vibe and the authenticity of what we stand for.

303
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:37.940
The ability to be a little bit better tomorrow than you are today.

304
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.460
And I think that's probably what I'm most proud of.

305
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:43.430
How many employees do you have?
180 employees.

306
00:17:43.431 --> 00:17:47.360
If you count or Yoga Studios and count the gym and count the other entities that

307
00:17:47.361 --> 00:17:48.740
we own.
How many employees did you

308
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.100
<v 0>10 years ago?
When did on it?
When did,</v>

309
00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:56.800
<v 1>when was that started in 2011.
Well originally 2010 zero employees.</v>

310
00:17:56.801 --> 00:17:57.634
2010.

311
00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:01.810
I was making like hangover supplements most success party too much.

312
00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.140
And I was,
you know,
really a lot of this was,
well where's,

313
00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:06.490
where's the need for me?

314
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:10.090
Well at that point I was just drinking my head off because I was unhappy.

315
00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:13.660
So I first started making hangover supplements and then realize like,
ah,

316
00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:14.890
that's not where I'm going.

317
00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:19.000
Where I'm going is to really improve my life in all areas.

318
00:18:19.001 --> 00:18:22.690
And that's when we pivoted Alpha brain and different things and yeah,
we started,

319
00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.920
we started in,
there was one employee who is my kind of like my right hand guy,

320
00:18:26.921 --> 00:18:30.430
part assistant part,
you know,
whatever,
everything,

321
00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:35.080
the everything got odd job.
100% and then,
uh,
yeah,

322
00:18:35.081 --> 00:18:38.980
we started getting geared up with Alpha brain and then when it hit and we

323
00:18:38.981 --> 00:18:40.360
actually started having sales,

324
00:18:40.361 --> 00:18:44.380
then it was just like grabbing every friend that had something of a shaky job

325
00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:47.740
that I could trust and say,
quit,
quit,
quit,
come,
you know,

326
00:18:47.741 --> 00:18:48.910
and it's fucking figure it out.

327
00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:52.660
And I was in the attic of a little boutique that my fiance at the time Kaitlin

328
00:18:52.661 --> 00:18:55.960
was running and we were in the attic of this boutique and we were just bringing

329
00:18:55.961 --> 00:18:59.800
out literal trash bags of orders that we were hand labeling,
you know,

330
00:18:59.801 --> 00:19:02.950
from the top of it.
And that's,
that's how it started.
I mean,

331
00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.770
we didn't have a lot of fun.
I'd blown through the only funding I got.

332
00:19:05.771 --> 00:19:08.590
I got 100,000 from,
uh,
my friend Bodie Miller,

333
00:19:08.591 --> 00:19:11.920
who's the Olympic skier at the time,
who a really significant friendship for me.

334
00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:15.850
And then an old investment banking contact that somehow didn't go broke when all

335
00:19:15.851 --> 00:19:18.430
the wildcat wells,
you know,
dried up.
And you know,

336
00:19:18.431 --> 00:19:21.820
I don't know how he ever made money because everything I ever saw him do didn't

337
00:19:21.821 --> 00:19:26.560
work.
But he gave me 50 grand,
so I had $110,000 I blew through a lot of that,

338
00:19:26.561 --> 00:19:29.500
trying to market these hangover supplements and it was like literally like the

339
00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:34.501
last $20,000 invested in an order of Alpha brain on net 30 and then it hit,

340
00:19:36.221 --> 00:19:39.880
we sold out in 24 hours and then net 30 meaning you had 30 days to pay for your

341
00:19:39.881 --> 00:19:44.410
main yeah.
And exactly cost.
Exactly.
It was all in man.
It was just like,

342
00:19:44.411 --> 00:19:46.120
here we go.
Let's see.

343
00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.100
<v 0>So I,
I promised to get back to this,</v>

344
00:19:49.101 --> 00:19:53.270
so I want to not leave people hanging and then we're going to come back to the

345
00:19:53.271 --> 00:19:58.130
attic 16 you,
you mentioned you had a lot of,

346
00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:01.230
maybe a complicated relationship with your dad.
Yeah.
Conflicted relationship

347
00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.120
visionquest yeah.
Was that an overnight experience or was it multiple overnight.

348
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.230
Overnight.
All right,
so you have this vision quest,
uh,

349
00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:12.070
two things if you're comfortable talking about it.
Yeah.

350
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.480
How was your relationship with your dad?
Complicated.

351
00:20:14.481 --> 00:20:18.180
I think that's true for a lot of people.
That as a,

352
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.990
for those people who want a good quote I think is Ron Doss,

353
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.990
formerly Richard Alpert.
You can look up his history,
but he said,

354
00:20:23.991 --> 00:20:25.850
if you think you're enlightened,
go spend a week with your family.

355
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:29.150
So we all have our staff,
we all have our stuff.

356
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:34.010
How was the relationship complicated?
How would you describe it?

357
00:20:34.011 --> 00:20:37.010
And then did the vision quest affect it in any way?

358
00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.970
<v 1>Did,
but that took a long time to unpack.
In fact,
that's still unpacking honestly,</v>

359
00:20:42.971 --> 00:20:45.040
like there's actually been an understanding,

360
00:20:45.041 --> 00:20:49.050
a realization that's actually led to a greater happiness for me.
And,

361
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:52.900
and I'll talk about that,
you know,
when I get to it.
But if I go from the start,

362
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:56.560
you know,
my dad was a tortured soul and from his father who I never met,

363
00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:00.730
his father used to hold trials for him and his brother,

364
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:04.030
he was a lawyer and he would hold trials like Franz Kafka Scowl.

365
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.730
They're like six and eight years old and put him on trial and they'd have to

366
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:10.300
petition their defense and he would hammer them and cross examine them and then

367
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:14.320
then read out their sentence,
you know,
and like some crazy shit like that.

368
00:21:14.321 --> 00:21:15.970
So it wasn't ever like physical or sexual,

369
00:21:15.971 --> 00:21:20.650
but like massive like emotional mind fuck series.
Yes.

370
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.070
And so he,
my dad had,
you know,

371
00:21:23.071 --> 00:21:26.890
he had a lot of his own demons and he started on the path to heal himself.

372
00:21:26.891 --> 00:21:31.830
As I said,
to try and pass as little as that is he could off on is,
uh,

373
00:21:31.831 --> 00:21:36.250
off on his sons.
But you know,
he didn't quite get there by the time he had me.

374
00:21:36.251 --> 00:21:40.480
So one little thing I would say,
I remember one time he was playing ping pong.

375
00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:44.620
I was about four years old.
He's playing ping pong,
he missed hits a ball ball,

376
00:21:44.621 --> 00:21:49.210
goes flying off the thing and I run,
I run by and I go home,
run.
Okay.

377
00:21:49.211 --> 00:21:52.960
And I'm like,
the fucking ball went out of the thing two days later,
corners me,

378
00:21:52.961 --> 00:21:55.600
throws me down in a corner and starts yelling at him.
How could you,

379
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.560
how could you insult me like that in front of my competition?
How dare you,
blah,

380
00:21:59.561 --> 00:22:03.060
blah,
blah.
And I was like,
wow,
wow,
wow.
Like I didn't know.

381
00:22:03.061 --> 00:22:06.590
I couldn't even fathom that.
Like,
you know,
it,
it's so lost,
you know,

382
00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:08.020
gone out of my mind.
Right,
right.

383
00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:12.620
So it built this kind of fear around everything I say could be misinterpreted

384
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:16.090
and that any issue with that delay,
exactly.
The delay was the killer.

385
00:22:16.091 --> 00:22:19.960
Like if it was right away,
you're like,
you know,
hot stove,
ouch.
Okay,
I get it.

386
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:24.100
But that forced me to internalize it because I'd be going over everything I said

387
00:22:24.101 --> 00:22:25.450
the previous day,
the previous day.

388
00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.200
So there's this massive lack of trust around my dad,

389
00:22:29.201 --> 00:22:30.790
which I didn't really realize.

390
00:22:30.791 --> 00:22:34.450
And then fast going fast forward and we had a good relationship and a lot of

391
00:22:34.451 --> 00:22:35.111
other ways,
you know,

392
00:22:35.111 --> 00:22:38.860
he was a brilliant man and taught me a lot and I'm grateful for our
relationship,

393
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.980
but I didn't realize that I never really trusted men,

394
00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:45.520
particularly men that had that kind of paternal role.

395
00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:49.570
So anybody who I had in that kind of father category,
even peer category,

396
00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:53.020
like even when I give him a hug and be like,
Yo fucking trust,

397
00:22:53.021 --> 00:22:56.820
you know like I don't know if one thing I said you know a while ago or is going

398
00:22:56.821 --> 00:22:57.820
to cause you to go off.

399
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:01.240
And I didn't really realize that I was doing that to more people other than my

400
00:23:01.241 --> 00:23:06.070
father.
Like it was extending universally to all men until recently,
you know,

401
00:23:06.071 --> 00:23:10.840
someone who I had held in that kind of father mentor kind of role.

402
00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:13.000
Our relationship really got,

403
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.980
you know when a skew and went haywire and I realize like Oh shit,
you know,

404
00:23:17.981 --> 00:23:20.020
I'm really damaged by this.

405
00:23:20.021 --> 00:23:22.660
Like this is really traumatic to me and where's this coming from?

406
00:23:22.661 --> 00:23:24.130
Oh this is coming from my dad.

407
00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:27.700
This is that same pattern repeats just to occur you while you're in the shower

408
00:23:27.701 --> 00:23:31.480
or what [inaudible] we journaling.
What prompted that realization?

409
00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:37.130
Yeah,
I think it was,
it came kind of slowly and it was unpacking,
you know what,

410
00:23:37.131 --> 00:23:41.320
I'm constantly doing different work and introspection and it was somehow that

411
00:23:41.321 --> 00:23:44.200
pain,
that external pain.
Again,
going back to external pain,

412
00:23:44.201 --> 00:23:48.410
being one of those indicators,
like why am I fucking devastated by this?

413
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.410
Like why am I completely floored?
Why am I,

414
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.980
this is applying universally to everything.
I was like really crushed.

415
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:58.790
Then I couldn't bounce back.
And then so it just forced me to keep looking like,

416
00:23:58.791 --> 00:24:01.730
what is this?
Like why do I care so much and say crush?

417
00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.900
Was that something your mentor or the person in that role had said to you that

418
00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:10.490
threw you off?
It was an instance that repeated the pattern where I had,
you know,

419
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.380
and I don't want to get into the details specifically,

420
00:24:12.381 --> 00:24:15.870
but like I had said and done,
you know,

421
00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.160
I had said and done some things that were interpreted in a way that I didn't

422
00:24:19.161 --> 00:24:23.320
intend.
And it caused a,
uh,
caused a break in our friendship and,

423
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:24.740
and a lot of anger.

424
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:29.990
And so it was that pattern of I'm never safe no matter what I say or do,

425
00:24:29.991 --> 00:24:33.780
it can be interpreted in a different way and I'll never be safe.
And it,

426
00:24:33.781 --> 00:24:38.630
and it really allowed me to look at that and analyze that and say,

427
00:24:38.631 --> 00:24:38.811
all right,

428
00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:43.400
I got to get to the bottom of this and I got to understand where this is coming

429
00:24:43.401 --> 00:24:44.750
from.
And simultaneously,

430
00:24:44.751 --> 00:24:49.250
like I met Kyle Kingsbury who's become one of my best friends probably if I was

431
00:24:49.251 --> 00:24:50.870
to get married now,
he'd be my best man.

432
00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:56.120
And he's also probably the most stable dude I know.
Yeah.

433
00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:59.360
And so like it was a combination of having one example of like the most,
oh,

434
00:24:59.361 --> 00:25:01.280
I can really think I can trust this guy.

435
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.540
Like you can push him to the extreme and he doesn't shift like under pain,

436
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:10.070
under duress,
under fatigue,
under psychedelics,
under alcohol,
under anything.

437
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:15.220
Incredible amount of self awareness from what I've observed of him under duress.

438
00:25:15.861 --> 00:25:20.720
I've seen a bunch of grass and he can go from that initial experience of

439
00:25:20.721 --> 00:25:24.940
overwhelm to completely centered and a few minutes.
It's,

440
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.170
it's remarkable.
It's,
and we're talking about Kyle Kingsbury,

441
00:25:27.171 --> 00:25:31.460
who is our director of human optimization,
former UFC fighter.
Um,
but yeah,

442
00:25:31.461 --> 00:25:35.960
it was a combination of one spinning off and then one being solid and realizing

443
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.550
somewhere in there,
I can't pinpoint the moment,
but I realized,
oh,

444
00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.530
like this is all stuff from my father.

445
00:25:42.531 --> 00:25:45.500
I've never really trusted men ever since that point.

446
00:25:45.501 --> 00:25:50.501
So that was like a second weird coming of age at 36 I'm about to turn 37 where I

447
00:25:50.661 --> 00:25:55.280
finally felt like I wasn't,
I didn't need to prove anything to my dad.

448
00:25:55.281 --> 00:25:56.660
I didn't need to be get validated.

449
00:25:56.661 --> 00:26:00.920
I didn't need to show him that I was worthy of love or any more or any other men

450
00:26:00.921 --> 00:26:01.820
for that matter.

451
00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:05.900
And I could actually trust that I really do have male friends and I really do

452
00:26:05.901 --> 00:26:09.770
have people who I can trust and if they go off,
that's okay.
It's not me,

453
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:10.880
it's not my fault.

454
00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:16.030
It's just a pattern that happened from when I was growing up and that's been

455
00:26:17.121 --> 00:26:17.954
huge for me.

456
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.710
That's been huge because I've always retreated to females is my solace and my

457
00:26:21.711 --> 00:26:26.711
comfort and having like male friends that I can really rely on and trust and

458
00:26:26.721 --> 00:26:29.600
kind of be vulnerable with in,
in really authentic way.

459
00:26:29.601 --> 00:26:31.850
I mean I would go do ceremonies and stuff,

460
00:26:31.851 --> 00:26:34.490
but I'd always kind of keep my shell up,
you know?

461
00:26:34.491 --> 00:26:38.300
And now to be able to relax into that,
it's just,
I feel like,
uh,

462
00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:43.470
a much happier individual know,
like much more solid like having,
having,

463
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.530
you know,
brothers of the way.
Yeah,
no,
that's cool.
Well,

464
00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:50.100
if half the people you encounter are like potential threats,

465
00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.700
that's a lot of day to day existence.
I can't even,

466
00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.670
I mean I simply the so much with people who've had both,

467
00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:00.850
they're both those roles be off center,
off Kilter,
you know,

468
00:27:00.851 --> 00:27:02.490
like if you had your mother and your father,

469
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:05.490
let's say your father was abusive and your mother permitted it and there was

470
00:27:05.491 --> 00:27:09.120
some weird dynamic there and then both sides you don't trust and then you just

471
00:27:09.121 --> 00:27:13.710
don't trust the fucking world.
You know,
I was super lucky.
I had one sock,

472
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:18.150
one half dialed,
then you know,
so I had a place to retreat,
I had a place to rest.

473
00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:21.480
You know,
if you have neither,
that's a hell of a challenging road.

474
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:24.750
But the good news is you make it through that and you'll be even stronger

475
00:27:24.751 --> 00:27:28.710
because of it.
Know,
and you can help people if you do the work.

476
00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:32.880
And I'm going to get back to the attic in a second,
but if you do the work,

477
00:27:32.881 --> 00:27:36.090
what do you know?
What I've realized also just recently,
and I mean I'm 40 now,

478
00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:40.740
but if no matter your circumstances or the hand you've been dealt,

479
00:27:40.741 --> 00:27:45.741
if you do the work to uncover the wounds,

480
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.200
heal the wounds,

481
00:27:49.201 --> 00:27:54.201
or at least be accept that they exist and begin to process that,

482
00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.720
that you're not only doing the work for yourself,

483
00:27:57.721 --> 00:28:01.320
but you can then in turn help other people who've experienced the same thing or

484
00:28:01.321 --> 00:28:05.610
similar things,
right?
So it's,
it's really valuable work.
Hard to understate.

485
00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:07.470
That's almost the turning point,
right?

486
00:28:07.471 --> 00:28:11.310
When you take your lessons and your knowledge and then you can help other
people.

487
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.130
And at that point you got the inspiration and you got the momentum.

488
00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:17.520
That's the final healing catalyst.
It's not healing yourself.

489
00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.370
It's the knowing that you've,
everything that you've suffered,

490
00:28:20.371 --> 00:28:23.250
all of that pain you've endured can now help someone else.

491
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:26.010
It alchemizes it instantly into something that's valuable,

492
00:28:26.011 --> 00:28:29.490
something you can be grateful for.
And when you're grateful for something,

493
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.330
it's no longer trauma.
Like you've healed it.
Like that's the full circle.

494
00:28:33.331 --> 00:28:35.970
Is gratitude for that,
for what it's given you yet,

495
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:40.440
at least for me to the regard for myself or healing myself,

496
00:28:40.441 --> 00:28:42.240
what is it sounds really odd to say,

497
00:28:42.241 --> 00:28:46.200
but wasn't enough to motivate me to do the work.

498
00:28:46.201 --> 00:28:49.050
I knew it'd be really difficult,
but as soon as I realized,
oh,
well,

499
00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:52.260
even if I have no regard or very little regard for myself,

500
00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:55.340
if I can then develop a tool kit,

501
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:58.410
learn about ab and C and impart that to other people,

502
00:28:58.411 --> 00:29:03.411
that's enough to motivate me and since have developed more regard for myself,

503
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:07.980
but it's like,
hey,
you gotta take what works.
And for me it was that realization,

504
00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:11.400
oh,
I can actually hand this baton off to other people.
Look at,
well,

505
00:29:11.401 --> 00:29:16.200
let's work with what,
what motivates.
Yeah.
Look at every great epic novel.

506
00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:20.700
Like what gets the hero inspired.
It's not him,
it's not his own safety.

507
00:29:20.701 --> 00:29:24.720
He's fine like chopping wood and being in the forest.
But when you know,

508
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:28.710
the oppressing force starts fucking with his family or starts fucking with his

509
00:29:28.711 --> 00:29:33.030
kids,
you know,
then then you unleash William Wallace.
Yeah.
You know,
like,

510
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:36.880
like if they didn't slip Mearns throat,
like there may not be Scotland's right.

511
00:29:36.881 --> 00:29:39.930
Is,
you know,
there's just,
there's just the UK,
you know what I mean?

512
00:29:39.931 --> 00:29:44.290
Like what we're wired to really care for those we love almost more than

513
00:29:44.291 --> 00:29:47.500
ourselves.
It's just part of the social dynamic.
And you can tap in,

514
00:29:47.501 --> 00:29:50.680
you can like hack into that current and use that to your advantage.

515
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.870
And that's like the cleanest burning fuel you got.

516
00:29:52.871 --> 00:29:56.530
That's like a fusion reactor from the sun,
you know?
And that's,

517
00:29:56.531 --> 00:29:59.260
that's really what's going to motivate you.
Not the other,
you know,

518
00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:01.660
ego based stuff that's like burning coal.
You know,

519
00:30:01.661 --> 00:30:04.420
you're going to run out of that shit at some point and it's not going to work

520
00:30:04.421 --> 00:30:08.690
for you.
And you have to breathe in the fumes.
Exactly.
So you'd,

521
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:12.640
you'd just turning or you have turned 37 tomorrow.
Tomorrow.

522
00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:18.190
Thanks man.
Uh,
all right.
37.
So if we rewind the clock,

523
00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:22.870
I think you said 2011,
right?
So you're like 29 30

524
00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:27.750
<v 0>and fulfilling orders out of the attic.
I remember those days,
by the way,</v>

525
00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:32.290
when I started my first real business also in sports nutrition,
I remember the,

526
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.010
when I decided to get a fulfillment company was when I was,

527
00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:40.250
I had to race off to the post office to ship off packages.

528
00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:43.530
My car wouldn't start.

529
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:48.300
So I got on my motorcycle used motorcycle with a garbage bag,

530
00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:51.360
big dark garbage bag full of boxes.

531
00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:56.310
And I'm wrapping it around the throttle to try to make it to the post office.

532
00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.990
Almost die obviously.
And uh,
I get back,
I'm like,
that was dumb.

533
00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.430
You didn't want to go Santa Claus.
I hold it over.
I'd have to,

534
00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.770
I'd have to really switch grips if I went Santa Claus.

535
00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:12.480
So I decided just to risk life and limb with it on the throttle and it came
back.

536
00:31:12.481 --> 00:31:15.810
I was like,
okay,
now it's time to start to outsource things up.

537
00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.780
The question I wanted to ask you is,
all right,
so you,

538
00:31:17.781 --> 00:31:22.170
you get up to betting the farm on,

539
00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:27.180
which was a very small farm in the backyard on this manufacturing on Alpha brain

540
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:30.750
with net 30 terms.

541
00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:37.010
<v 1>Uh,
let's,
if we bounce out,
say two years,</v>

542
00:31:37.011 --> 00:31:38.270
so to 32

543
00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:44.010
<v 0>from 16 to 32 could even be earlier for like 12 to 32.</v>

544
00:31:44.011 --> 00:31:47.460
Do you remember,
uh,
any point in time when you were like,
wow,

545
00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:50.490
this is the richest I've ever felt.
Cause I remember,

546
00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.680
I remember one very specific day in my experience,
but when

547
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.920
<v 1>was that?
What was that moment when you're like,
wow,</v>

548
00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.190
well I feel successful or I,
wow,

549
00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:04.480
this is more than I could have anticipated.
Yeah.

550
00:32:04.481 --> 00:32:07.540
I mean that happened pretty quick after that because that,
you know,

551
00:32:07.541 --> 00:32:09.610
with those net 30 terms,
I was able to,

552
00:32:09.611 --> 00:32:13.420
in the sales I was really able to scale pretty aggressively without taking on

553
00:32:13.421 --> 00:32:15.910
extra capital or anything.
And we had no overhead.

554
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.620
I mean that was just the cost of the product itself and a couple friends who

555
00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:24.940
were paying like 25 30 grand,
whatever,
we could kind of pushed together.
And then,

556
00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:28.600
you know,
it started to grow a little bit from there.
But it was a lot of sales,

557
00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:32.500
you know,
just product costs,
a lot of shipments,
no additional advertising.

558
00:32:32.501 --> 00:32:35.050
Cause at that point,
you know,
Rogan was the business partner,

559
00:32:35.051 --> 00:32:37.540
he was the advertising engine he'd bought into the company.

560
00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:42.500
So I'd give an equity in exchange for the,
for the marketing.
And I was,

561
00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:43.100
you know,

562
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:48.100
there was serious money coming in and I started looking at houses and I was

563
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.490
looking at this house and I was thinking maybe,
you know,
600 $700,000 range,

564
00:32:52.491 --> 00:32:54.590
really get a house I can sink my teeth into.

565
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:59.210
And I saw this house that was $1 million and I was like $1 million house.

566
00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.740
Damn.
I was like,
I think I can swing it.
I think I can fucking swing it,
you know?

567
00:33:03.741 --> 00:33:06.030
And it was just,
cause it was my,
it was my dream house,
you know,

568
00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:09.290
it had a nice backyard and I envisioned what's there now,

569
00:33:09.291 --> 00:33:13.640
which is ax throwing and slack line and,
and pool and deck and fire pit.

570
00:33:13.641 --> 00:33:18.080
I was like,
I can do this here in this house.
And it had my style and I just,

571
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.990
you know,
at that point again a little bit early,
but I still went for it.

572
00:33:20.991 --> 00:33:24.050
Like I think I can,
this thing looks solid enough,
I can go in.

573
00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:25.880
And when I went into that house,

574
00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:29.240
that was like a big moment for me because that was a,
that was a real house.

575
00:33:29.241 --> 00:33:32.630
That was like a,
it was a big boy house.
I was like,
I got to fucking big boy.

576
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:36.950
And that was a,
that was really the moment for me.
I was like,
damn,

577
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:38.450
this is awesome here.

578
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:43.240
And you've turned it into the Aubrey Marcus House of Ninja Warrior training,

579
00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:45.770
sort of delight.
It's been heaven.

580
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:50.280
<v 0>You mentioned a name that for those people who don't have contacts,</v>

581
00:33:50.281 --> 00:33:53.010
I want to explore for a second.
So you mentioned Rogan,
Joe Rogan.

582
00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:56.660
So some of you listening of course know who Joe is.
Uh,

583
00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.260
most certainly,
uh,

584
00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:03.870
I would say arguably the most powerful single to the interview format.

585
00:34:03.871 --> 00:34:07.890
Podcaster.
Yeah.
Period.
Um,
part of the inspiration,

586
00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.650
certainly one of the inspirations for me starting my own podcast was being

587
00:34:10.651 --> 00:34:14.490
across the table from Joe and having such a wonderful experience.
Yeah.

588
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:18.750
Able to go long form be myself,
although robes,
he fed me,
you know,

589
00:34:18.751 --> 00:34:21.300
I don't know if I ever told you this just I'm going to digress for a second

590
00:34:21.301 --> 00:34:25.680
cause that's what I do very first time I was on his show,
he said,

591
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:28.920
because I've been on twice.
He said,
um,
do you want some bulletproof coffee?
Sure.

592
00:34:28.921 --> 00:34:30.540
So give me like a huge,

593
00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:33.750
I mean it must've been like 24 ounces of bulletproof coffee and then he goes,

594
00:34:33.751 --> 00:34:36.180
you want some Alpha brain?
I was like,
sure.

595
00:34:36.181 --> 00:34:40.620
So I had like a handful of Alpha brain and then he goes,
do you want some pot?

596
00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.990
And I was like,
I don't even smoke pot,

597
00:34:42.991 --> 00:34:47.991
but I'm a little intimidated Joseph intense guy and maybe it's spending time in

598
00:34:49.201 --> 00:34:50.850
Japan.
I was like,
can't say no.
All right.

599
00:34:50.851 --> 00:34:55.200
So I go into this interview on like 24 ounces of butter coffee,

600
00:34:56.190 --> 00:35:00.270
a handful of Alpha brain end pot,
which I never can.

601
00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:04.800
I very rarely consumed nothing against it.
It's just not really my plant and man,

602
00:35:04.801 --> 00:35:09.170
Oh man,
that was,
that was a hell of an experience.
Uh,
but uh,

603
00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.720
how did you first meet jokes?

604
00:35:12.721 --> 00:35:16.110
I think this is going to tie into maybe a theme that I want to explore.

605
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:19.890
<v 1>I listened to Joe do comedy,
you know,
and I'd seen him as,</v>

606
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.680
I was a huge UFC fan all the way from UFC one.

607
00:35:22.681 --> 00:35:25.350
Literally cause my dad was a fan of the sport.
We'd watch that together.

608
00:35:25.351 --> 00:35:28.610
That was some of the good times memories is watching.
It's brutal first we se.

609
00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.513
Yeah,
right.

610
00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:35.560
Hot Foot slider that tooth out at as sumo mellow guy and to the commentators.

611
00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:40.380
Oh boy is different.
Yeah.
That was pretty epic and a,

612
00:35:40.381 --> 00:35:41.460
so I'd seen him there.

613
00:35:41.461 --> 00:35:44.190
And so I think that probably drew me to listen to his comedy show.

614
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:47.340
And then I listened to his comedy show.
I was like,
Oh shit.

615
00:35:47.341 --> 00:35:49.470
He's thinking about the same things that I'm thinking about.

616
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:54.270
Like he's done psychedelics ease in to Maureen about aliens and super volcanoes

617
00:35:54.271 --> 00:35:58.110
and all this stuff.
It's like man,
I gotta meet this guy and I kept,

618
00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.720
I kept running into them at different events cause I go to some of the UFC,

619
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.290
you know,
when I could and I'd see him out in the,

620
00:36:04.291 --> 00:36:07.050
at that point he was still going to clubs and occasionally going to strip clubs

621
00:36:07.051 --> 00:36:09.990
and we had the podcast at this point.
Uh,

622
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:14.550
no I don't think he did and when I first started at that point and then,
um,

623
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:17.620
but you know,
I'm just a fan at that point so and say,
hey Joe,
you know,

624
00:36:17.621 --> 00:36:18.570
and Blah Blah Blah and you know,

625
00:36:18.571 --> 00:36:23.160
you get your in like kind of fan zone fans at that point.
And you know,

626
00:36:23.161 --> 00:36:24.810
I kept,
I saw more of his comedy show.

627
00:36:24.811 --> 00:36:29.100
Then you launched the podcast and then at that was super early in the podcast

628
00:36:29.101 --> 00:36:31.830
game and he had a no commercials and it's just him and red band and they were

629
00:36:31.831 --> 00:36:32.631
just bullshit.

630
00:36:32.631 --> 00:36:35.550
And it was just like a fun thing that everybody who knows Joe Rogan,

631
00:36:35.551 --> 00:36:37.230
like all in caps,
marquee Joe Rogan.

632
00:36:37.231 --> 00:36:39.740
She'd go back and see some of the early shows.
No,
no.
Yeah,

633
00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:43.050
I think it's inspiring to see where we're up again.
No doubt.

634
00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:45.630
And I had an idea at that point you're like,

635
00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:49.590
oh well he doesn't have advertising on his show.
Maybe I'll hit him up for,

636
00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:49.861
you know,

637
00:36:49.861 --> 00:36:54.330
to do some advertising and use that as a chance to like meet him and maybe

638
00:36:54.331 --> 00:36:56.520
elevate out of the fan zone so we can have a conversation.

639
00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:01.410
So I remember I set up a lunch meeting to just 30 minutes to just meet
somewhere,

640
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:05.330
talk to them about advertising on a show.
This was in la?
This was in la?
Yeah.

641
00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:09.180
And a fly out just for this or you already that did.
And actually it was,

642
00:37:09.181 --> 00:37:11.820
it was interesting.
It was like the universe gave me a test.
So Bodie Miller,

643
00:37:11.821 --> 00:37:13.910
who I mentioned,
four Olympic skier,
you know,

644
00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.720
still in his playboy mode at the time.

645
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:20.190
He invited me for my first Kentucky Derby experience and it was like,
Oh man,

646
00:37:20.191 --> 00:37:22.800
I got a cancellation.
Got Full VIP access,

647
00:37:22.801 --> 00:37:26.400
craziest parties you've ever seen suite at the Kentucky Derby.
And I was like,

648
00:37:26.401 --> 00:37:29.250
and I had that one meeting with Rogan that was right in the middle of that.

649
00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:32.220
I was like,
man,
I can't go.
I gotta take this meeting with Joe.

650
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:36.780
And it was like a cool test.
We'll test,
you know.
And um,

651
00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:40.650
so I took that meeting and a 30 minute meeting to talk about advertising quickly

652
00:37:40.651 --> 00:37:45.090
turned into all those things so I can tell like super volcanoes and genetic

653
00:37:45.091 --> 00:37:49.230
bottleneck theory and aliens and all the philosophical things that we talked

654
00:37:49.231 --> 00:37:51.600
about.
And after that he's like,
hey man,
you know,

655
00:37:51.601 --> 00:37:54.060
I'd love to have you come on the show and we can talk more about this.

656
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:58.410
So went on the show and just as friends just started having a relationship with

657
00:37:58.411 --> 00:38:01.740
them.
And it was a couple of years after that,
I asked him the question like,

658
00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:05.370
hey man,
like what supplement would you like the best yourself?
And he's like,

659
00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.920
Oh yeah,
I'm into new nootropics.
And I was like,
man,

660
00:38:07.921 --> 00:38:11.070
I'm going to make the best one that's ever been made and I'll let you know about

661
00:38:11.071 --> 00:38:13.940
it.
All right.
So this was like made to order.
It's just like,
yeah,
this is it.

662
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:16.890
Bespoke Joseph.
Yeah.
Bespoke.
It's,
I didn't know that.

663
00:38:16.891 --> 00:38:19.740
Now you mentioned in passing something earlier,

664
00:38:19.741 --> 00:38:23.880
and I don't know if this is the product that you were meeting to advertise.
Oh,

665
00:38:23.881 --> 00:38:28.200
I bet it was.
I bet it was.
I bet it was.
So you mentioned the SDX toy.

666
00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.510
Oh yeah.
Well this was,
we talking to,

667
00:38:30.511 --> 00:38:34.200
this was the number one male cell number one selling male sex toy in the world.

668
00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:39.320
The one and only fleshlight fleshlight or a convenient pocket pussy concealed in

669
00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:42.960
a obnoxiously large flashlight container,

670
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:49.110
<v 0>which by the way,
I should say,
uh,
on this podcast,
uh,</v>

671
00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:51.280
had Alice Little,

672
00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:54.550
who is the number one earning as far as I know,

673
00:38:54.551 --> 00:38:57.880
legal sex worker in the u s and one of her top recommendations was,

674
00:38:57.881 --> 00:39:01.090
I wish I could or her pronouncements was,

675
00:39:01.091 --> 00:39:05.470
I wish I could get a fleshlight for every male in the country for a number of

676
00:39:05.471 --> 00:39:09.730
different reasons.
So
you've left a legacy.

677
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:15.250
All right?
So the people can look that up if they would like,
but that was,

678
00:39:15.251 --> 00:39:17.830
that was the co,
the product context for that meeting.

679
00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:19.020
<v 1>That was,
that was the,</v>

680
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:21.610
that was the client that I was working with and I was like,
Oh man,

681
00:39:21.611 --> 00:39:24.370
maybe John will do something with this.
And Joe brought that to his people.

682
00:39:24.371 --> 00:39:27.070
If people are like,
no way,
you can't do that when you say clients.
So you've,

683
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:30.670
you've done a lot of different things at this point on it does not exist on,

684
00:39:30.671 --> 00:39:31.450
it does not exist.

685
00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:35.650
So I have a marketing company and that Boutique Marketing Company has,
you know,

686
00:39:35.651 --> 00:39:38.560
a few people that are working with me and I have,
again,
a bunch of clients,

687
00:39:38.561 --> 00:39:39.820
most of which failed.

688
00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.960
But I couldn't fail at selling sex toys because people just want things to fuck.

689
00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:48.910
It was very easy,
easy thing to learn and not suck at.

690
00:39:48.911 --> 00:39:52.960
So I was able to help make that thing work.
And uh,
yeah,

691
00:39:52.961 --> 00:39:55.420
so I had that one going and you know,
he,

692
00:39:55.421 --> 00:40:00.310
he liked just the ridiculousness of it and he liked the idea of not taking this

693
00:40:00.311 --> 00:40:04.030
show too seriously to do something like that.
And so he just went for it.

694
00:40:04.031 --> 00:40:07.300
And so if you go back to the old diaries,
there'll be old flashlight.

695
00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:08.200
And I remember,

696
00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:13.450
<v 0>might actually there.
Well,
let's see.
So I came about now,
did the,</v>

697
00:40:13.451 --> 00:40:15.280
did the fleshlight and on it

698
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:18.690
<v 1>overlap at all or no,
it did not.
So yeah,</v>

699
00:40:18.691 --> 00:40:22.780
I started on it after I actually got myself in a position where,
um,

700
00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:26.280
I was able to transition out of that company with some severance.

701
00:40:26.281 --> 00:40:30.300
Never got any other in incentives,
but got a pretty generous severance.

702
00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.840
And took that and just rode it into,
you know,

703
00:40:33.841 --> 00:40:36.030
starting on it and just running.

704
00:40:36.031 --> 00:40:40.140
And then I had $110,000 and I'd tried to dip into that as little as possible

705
00:40:40.141 --> 00:40:43.890
with my own,
you know,
utilization.
That was the severance.
No,

706
00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.780
that was the investment from Cody.
Got It.

707
00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:50.430
Run the other person and plus the severance and just kind of rode that to the,

708
00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:54.450
to the very brink of nothing.
And then again,

709
00:40:54.451 --> 00:40:56.550
it just came through like right in the nick of time.

710
00:40:56.990 --> 00:41:01.670
<v 0>What,
what are some of the,
if,
if I know you read a lot of senior library?</v>

711
00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:04.490
Uh,
it's one of the first things I do.

712
00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:08.270
If I get someone's house and I see a bookshelf or bookshelves as I go start

713
00:41:08.271 --> 00:41:12.530
browsing because you can learn a lot by browsing,
uh,
including which books?

714
00:41:12.531 --> 00:41:15.020
I haven't read it.
Not In your case,
but it's like if you see Warren piece,

715
00:41:15.021 --> 00:41:17.600
you're like,
all right.
Yeah,
definitely Moby Dick.
Like,
ask about those.

716
00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.870
I have Warren because I'm like,
well,
I haven't read it.
It's too,

717
00:41:20.871 --> 00:41:25.370
it's too intimidating.
I will get to eventually,
but maybe,
well maybe,
yes.
Dot.

718
00:41:25.371 --> 00:41:25.701
That dot.

719
00:41:25.701 --> 00:41:30.701
Maybe which books or resources do you view as having been very helpful in early

720
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:34.670
days

721
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:36.470
<v 1>of,
of on it or later,</v>

722
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:41.500
but are there any particular books that helped you or helped you think about and

723
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:44.240
develop the business?

724
00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:48.650
There is a direct correlation between my inner work and the outer success of on

725
00:41:48.651 --> 00:41:48.890
it.

726
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:53.890
Like that correlation is as clean a an association as anything I have.

727
00:41:54.351 --> 00:41:57.020
So I haven't been one that's red.
A lot of business books,

728
00:41:57.021 --> 00:42:01.140
a lot of the books that I've read have been oh yeah.
And your game.

729
00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:02.570
And you know,

730
00:42:02.571 --> 00:42:05.810
there's been some really significant books that I've read that have kind of

731
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:07.490
shaped who I am.

732
00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:12.230
And I think the first was kind of following that line of the Toltec philosophy

733
00:42:12.231 --> 00:42:16.250
from crazy Carlos Castaneda through Don Miguel Ruiz.

734
00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:18.350
And I think actually his most powerful book,

735
00:42:18.351 --> 00:42:22.280
although it's a little bit hard to get into,
is the Toltec art of life and death,

736
00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:23.900
which is a pot.

737
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:26.540
A lot of people know Don Miguel Ruiz from the four agreements or agreements.

738
00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.490
Yeah.
And then he wrote mastery of love,

739
00:42:28.491 --> 00:42:31.400
which is an incredible exploration of love and relationship.

740
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:35.000
And then his true masterwork is the Toltec art of life and death.

741
00:42:35.001 --> 00:42:38.810
And then the thing I liked about it is it was the first complete system,

742
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:43.770
a complete spiritual,
physical,
emotional system that you know,

743
00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:48.380
was self contained.
Like it was like its own religion to a certain extent.

744
00:42:48.381 --> 00:42:51.470
But except it was something that I could believe and I can buy into and was

745
00:42:51.471 --> 00:42:55.220
practical and I could utilize those principles of the warrior ethos and the

746
00:42:55.221 --> 00:42:59.450
principles of the Nog.
Well the artist who paints his masterpiece,
you know,

747
00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.630
versus the person who allows the mid totay they called it,

748
00:43:02.631 --> 00:43:05.510
which is the dream of the world to shape their experience.

749
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:08.120
And so that transition from just allowing everything,

750
00:43:08.121 --> 00:43:12.320
expectations and pressures from this person and that person to shape who I was

751
00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.710
to being becoming the Nog.
Well the artists who,
who are proactive,

752
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:20.510
who uses your intention to actually create the world around him and paint that

753
00:43:20.511 --> 00:43:23.960
masterpiece and,
and the laughter as the kind of guide,
you know,

754
00:43:23.961 --> 00:43:26.420
knowing that you've made it.
And I always say that like,

755
00:43:26.421 --> 00:43:29.600
you can tell a spiritual master by the sound of their laughter.

756
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:32.000
Like if they aren't laughing,
I'm not going to drink your cup.

757
00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:35.870
Iowasca like if you don't have a good belly laugh,
like you're missing the point,

758
00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:36.900
you know?
And,

759
00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:41.420
and that's been a really solid guide book in a place that if anybody's
searching,

760
00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:42.050
you know,

761
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:46.430
I would definitely check out Toltec philosophy Toltec art of life and death.

762
00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:50.870
Any other books come to mind,
you know,

763
00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:52.940
as far as like building,
you know,

764
00:43:52.941 --> 00:43:56.390
cause part of building a company is building like a scale of 10 years ago came

765
00:43:56.391 --> 00:43:59.540
to you and said,
I need three books.
Yeah.
What do you recommend?

766
00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:04.700
Aldous Huxley's island I think was another crucial book for me.
And that was,

767
00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:07.490
um,
that was utopian fiction.

768
00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:12.580
But the beauty of that is it was seeing how a system could work in mass,

769
00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:12.921
you know?

770
00:44:12.921 --> 00:44:16.850
And it was the first exposure to rewriting the rules of how everything could be

771
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:20.210
and understanding like,
oh,
we could just change everything.

772
00:44:20.211 --> 00:44:23.330
Like everything could be malleable.
And then what are the downstream effects?

773
00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:24.410
And it's that classic,

774
00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:28.790
classic clash of Utopia versus dystopia and how it all merges.

775
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:33.630
And that's been something I've consistently back on with a lot of like help in

776
00:44:33.631 --> 00:44:36.990
principles.
So I think that one was huge.
Um,
and then honestly,

777
00:44:36.991 --> 00:44:38.910
personally this has nothing to do with on it,

778
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:44.240
but personally the book sex at dawn by Chris Ryan was probably the third most

779
00:44:44.971 --> 00:44:47.010
influential single book.
Uh,

780
00:44:47.011 --> 00:44:52.011
because at that point I was frustrated in conventional monogamous relationship

781
00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:56.730
and I thought that humans were like lions and we were supposed to fight to the

782
00:44:56.731 --> 00:45:00.120
death to protect all our mates and that women should be happy if they found the

783
00:45:00.121 --> 00:45:03.360
right line,
you know,
and sex at dawn,
it's like,
no,
no.

784
00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:06.810
Humans like having sex both sides.
We're always going to like having sex.

785
00:45:06.811 --> 00:45:11.280
And that's just the nature of things.
And I go,
Oh man,
like I had this wrong.

786
00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:15.390
It's not just me that's supposed to want other lovers.
It's everybody that's,

787
00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:15.961
you know,

788
00:45:15.961 --> 00:45:20.961
from an instinctive primitive concept really is open to having a more expanded

789
00:45:21.631 --> 00:45:24.270
view of sexuality.
And that's led me down.

790
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:27.960
That was the initial domino that led me down the path of exploring open

791
00:45:27.961 --> 00:45:32.400
relationship,
which has been a huge advancement in my own personal happiness,

792
00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:36.600
fulfillment,
challenging as hell.
I mean challenging as hell,
but that book,

793
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:37.620
if it wasn't for that book,

794
00:45:37.621 --> 00:45:40.320
I don't think I ever would have given it a try because I was operating under a

795
00:45:40.321 --> 00:45:41.154
false premise.

796
00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:44.080
<v 0>So for people who are listening and they're like,
you know what,</v>

797
00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:48.730
I'd like to give that more expanded view of sexuality,
shot lock,
any,

798
00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:52.810
any,
any guideposts,
any particular guidelines

799
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.940
<v 1>you have to be super committed,
like do not,
you know,</v>

800
00:45:56.941 --> 00:46:00.810
like know that it's going to be hell.
Like you can have it all sorted.
Man.

801
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:01.770
I had it all sorted,

802
00:46:01.771 --> 00:46:04.350
mentally understood it philosophically understood spiritually.

803
00:46:04.351 --> 00:46:07.770
I understood it biologically understood it in evolutionary terms,

804
00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:11.100
but the moment that Whitney had another lover,

805
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:14.190
I spent 24 hours crawling around on the ground,

806
00:46:14.191 --> 00:46:17.940
vomiting every time I thought of her having sex with somebody else,

807
00:46:17.941 --> 00:46:20.050
like literally dry heaving,
right?

808
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:25.080
Like a massive purge that I couldn't even shake myself out of like,

809
00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:26.700
and that was step one.

810
00:46:26.701 --> 00:46:29.760
And then it gets a little bit better from there if you continue to do the work.

811
00:46:29.761 --> 00:46:32.370
But it takes a while to make it through.

812
00:46:32.371 --> 00:46:36.300
Like you got to literally go through the darkness,
the dark night of the soul,

813
00:46:36.301 --> 00:46:40.020
of your own insecurities,
all your fears and insecurities and validation points.

814
00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:44.520
Everything is going to be stress tested and challenged.
If you make it through,

815
00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:47.220
you'll be really free.
These things like jealousy,

816
00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:48.870
these things that can securities,

817
00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:53.490
they will get pushed to the point where you either fix them or you just suffer

818
00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:57.600
and,
and in unbearable pain.
So it forces you,
again,

819
00:46:57.601 --> 00:46:58.950
external pain is that force.

820
00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:01.920
It'll put you in pain and then it's up to you whether you can fix it.

821
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:05.940
<v 0>So we could spend an entire podcast just discussed.
Totally.
Totally.</v>

822
00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:10.180
You and I have spent the equivalent of many podcasts talking about this.
Yeah.

823
00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:13.410
So maybe another time,
but if we're looking back,

824
00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:16.980
this could be professional or personal and of course they're,
so,

825
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:20.340
I mean the two sides of the same coin.
Yeah.
No matter how you slice it.

826
00:47:20.341 --> 00:47:25.341
But do you have any particular failure that you can discuss?

827
00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:31.450
Um,
and I put failure in quotation because the,

828
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:37.200
the goal is to describe a failure that leader ended up setting the stage or

829
00:47:40.241 --> 00:47:44.210
planting a seed for a success later down the line.

830
00:47:44.211 --> 00:47:46.660
Are there any failures that come to mind or a failure that you just learned a

831
00:47:46.661 --> 00:47:48.040
lot from and therefore that helped you?

832
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:51.220
<v 1>You know,
I failed.</v>

833
00:47:51.221 --> 00:47:55.300
It's so many things and every single failure was helpful.

834
00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:58.240
Like every single fucking failure was helpful.

835
00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:01.810
And there's not one that stands out,
but there's some that I remember,

836
00:48:01.811 --> 00:48:05.410
like I remember early in the days of on and I was allowing myself to get really

837
00:48:05.411 --> 00:48:09.100
stressed and I was trying to record a video and someone was knocking on my door

838
00:48:09.101 --> 00:48:09.911
and I didn't respond.

839
00:48:09.911 --> 00:48:12.580
I was trying to stay in line with video and they kept knocking and they kept

840
00:48:12.581 --> 00:48:16.210
knocking.
This was when we had about 12 employees,
14 employees,
and I blew up.

841
00:48:16.211 --> 00:48:18.570
I lost it.
You know,
a little bit of my dad coming out.
Why,

842
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:21.280
what the fuck do you want?
If I don't answer the door when you knock,

843
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:26.020
then I'm fucking busy.
Right.
You know,
I blew up.
Right?
And then I was like,
oh man.

844
00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:30.340
And I go out and I opened the door and it was like the sweetest employee we had,

845
00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:34.840
you know,
and I think her name was Samantha and she's crying and I go,

846
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:39.330
oh my God,
like what did I just do?
Like she didn't know.

847
00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:41.290
And that was like a hard lesson.

848
00:48:41.291 --> 00:48:45.550
Like I am not going to lose my temper at no matter what is going on with my
life,

849
00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:49.990
I will not allow my anger to come out on my employees ever.
You know?

850
00:48:49.991 --> 00:48:50.950
And it was like this deep,

851
00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:53.350
like I interned it like that was deeply painful for me.

852
00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:55.990
Times I've done that in relationships too.
You know,

853
00:48:55.991 --> 00:48:59.980
where I've projected my own shit and put that on somebody else and watch them

854
00:48:59.981 --> 00:49:01.720
suffer from the pain that I've caused.

855
00:49:01.721 --> 00:49:04.810
And then having to deal with that businesses,
every business,
like I said,

856
00:49:04.811 --> 00:49:08.800
every business I did failed.
And then me questioning my own self worth.

857
00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:11.080
Like I'm grateful for all of that.

858
00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:15.370
And I'm sorry for the people who had to suffer along the way that people who bet

859
00:49:15.371 --> 00:49:16.390
on me and invested in me.

860
00:49:16.391 --> 00:49:19.720
And I failed in their shit and the people who I hurt with my anger and the

861
00:49:19.721 --> 00:49:21.460
people who I hurt with my projections.

862
00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:24.550
But I'm grateful for the experience because without all of that,

863
00:49:24.551 --> 00:49:28.540
and without the grace of that happening,
I wouldn't be a fraction who I am

864
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:32.110
allergic to anger

865
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:38.670
<v 0>thing.
I grapple with myself.
Uh,</v>

866
00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:43.940
the anger piece.

867
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.460
I'd love to touch on this because this is also part of my familiar cast

868
00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:53.480
characters and I think I've greatly improved over time with managing that as a,

869
00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:59.480
as an impulse,
something that,
that really was embedded in me early.

870
00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:02.060
And,
uh,

871
00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:06.860
after that experience,
what was your pattern interrupt?

872
00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:10.790
What did you say to yourself when you felt like the physiological response of

873
00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:15.290
about to hit takeoff in terms of losing temporary,
getting angry,

874
00:50:15.291 --> 00:50:19.640
what had,
what was the,
was the technique,
what was the approach?

875
00:50:19.890 --> 00:50:20.310
<v 1>You know,</v>

876
00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:24.570
it coincided with me talking because I started talking about that experience and

877
00:50:24.571 --> 00:50:28.460
then I was like,
yeah,
of course.
I was talking to my friend Duncan Trussell,

878
00:50:28.461 --> 00:50:32.520
who's pretty steeped in kind of Buddhist philosophy and he had a name for it and

879
00:50:32.521 --> 00:50:34.880
I think it was [inaudible] and it's that feeling you get,

880
00:50:34.881 --> 00:50:36.830
it's that welling of energy,
it's,

881
00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:41.210
and it actually feels good and I think it was acknowledging like there's some

882
00:50:41.211 --> 00:50:45.020
part of you that when that anger is coming it like feels good.

883
00:50:45.021 --> 00:50:49.390
It's a sense of power that's rising and that it's identifying that and the,

884
00:50:49.391 --> 00:50:52.550
and the Toltec philosophy offs also helps us.
Don Miguel help me with that.

885
00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:55.780
But you feel it rising and it's like the sweat,

886
00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:59.900
it's like the swell of a wave and there's a choice right there where you either

887
00:50:59.901 --> 00:51:04.640
paddle or you don't paddle.
But to really identify the swell and identify like,

888
00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:06.350
Oh yeah,
this is going to feel good.

889
00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:10.670
Like that power putting on that mantle and like breathing fire.

890
00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:13.640
Like it's going to feel good in certain ways,

891
00:51:13.641 --> 00:51:17.990
but the ramifications like never feel good.
You know,
the burning bodies,

892
00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.080
the house is on fire when you're breathing that dragon fire,

893
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:24.470
that never feels good.
So it's really a hard choice.

894
00:51:24.471 --> 00:51:29.240
I call it mental override to interrupt that,
that pattern,

895
00:51:29.241 --> 00:51:32.210
when I feel that shrimp or whatever the,
whatever Dunkin called it,

896
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:36.530
that moment of takeoff where I start to bristle and the dragon fucking tentacles

897
00:51:36.531 --> 00:51:40.970
come out and it starts to come.
Like I can identify.
Actually,
oddly enough,

898
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.940
I haven't felt this in a long time.
I felt that yesterday,

899
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:45.860
like yesterday and I looked,

900
00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:51.050
I was leaving my office and literally I haven't been this angry in a long time

901
00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:52.730
and someone,
you know,

902
00:51:52.731 --> 00:51:56.150
someone on my team screwed something up super bad and it was the second time on

903
00:51:56.151 --> 00:51:58.520
the same thing.
I was like,
oh my God.

904
00:51:58.521 --> 00:52:02.090
And I found out about at seven o'clock and I looked at a table and I wanted to

905
00:52:02.091 --> 00:52:02.924
smash it.

906
00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:06.260
I wanted to take the table and throw it on the ground and like smash it.

907
00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.320
And then I was like,
oh yeah,
there's that thing.

908
00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:12.380
Like I remember how I did deal with this thing.
All right,

909
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:15.440
I'm going to go for a walk outside and I would go for a walk outside.

910
00:52:15.441 --> 00:52:19.340
And then I read this Japanese study and I'd talk about this in my book where six

911
00:52:19.341 --> 00:52:23.210
breaths,
six deep breaths actually lowers blood pressure.
So they say,

912
00:52:23.211 --> 00:52:24.620
take a breath.
It's not a breath,

913
00:52:24.621 --> 00:52:28.940
it's six like six is the amount that it requires to get that physiological

914
00:52:28.941 --> 00:52:33.890
response.
So I took my six breasts,
I walked outside and it wasn't gone.

915
00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:36.380
Like I carried it for a while.
I talked to people,

916
00:52:36.381 --> 00:52:40.450
but at least eliminated it enough that that initial wave of the,

917
00:52:40.451 --> 00:52:44.450
the big wave of the swell past.
So the big wave of the swell past,

918
00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:47.270
and I paddled into a few other little ones.
You know,

919
00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:50.390
I body surfed on some Whitewater of that rage for a little while,

920
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:52.310
a little long boy.
Oh yeah.
And I,
you know,

921
00:52:52.311 --> 00:52:56.720
I'm fucking hammered a few emails and you don't paddle into it a little bit,

922
00:52:57.140 --> 00:53:02.140
but just my ability to recognize that and then trust the process that I'll be

923
00:53:02.241 --> 00:53:04.400
grateful that I didn't paddle into that wave,

924
00:53:04.401 --> 00:53:09.200
even if it would have felt good at the moment.
Um,
it's just been a,
a gradual,

925
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:12.980
slow experience.
Well,
you mentioned a couple of things I want to underscore.

926
00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:17.960
Number one is that
it's not a binary pass fail.
Right.
It's not,

927
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.823
it's not,

928
00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:23.980
I completely quelled all of my anger before I succeeded and if I didn't do that,

929
00:53:24.111 --> 00:53:26.160
it's a failure.
It's like,
no,
if you dial it back 10%

930
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.580
<v 0>that's yeah.
Big Deal.
Totally.
Right.
It's the,
it's the difference between like,</v>

931
00:53:29.581 --> 00:53:31.900
Hey,
fuck face in an email and like,
dear John,
right.

932
00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:37.160
That's 10% is really meaningful.
Yeah.
Uh,
so that's,

933
00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:39.420
that's one thing that it can be incremental,

934
00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:44.450
but the downstream effect of it can be much larger than that small incremental

935
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.431
change.

936
00:53:45.431 --> 00:53:50.431
And you feel the second when you're talking about failures is that what a lot of

937
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:53.880
per person might perceive as a failure,

938
00:53:53.881 --> 00:53:57.000
which is a path that isn't taken to completion over 10 20,

939
00:53:57.001 --> 00:53:59.400
30 years can still have a lot of value.

940
00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:02.440
And that's why I brought up the fleshlight.
Right.

941
00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:04.530
Like if it were not for that,

942
00:54:04.531 --> 00:54:07.970
you wouldn't have had the context to have the meeting.
Yup.

943
00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:12.660
Which then led to I owe my success to pocket pussy.

944
00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:19.380
Well that,
that that actually leads us to,
this might be your answer.
Uh,
this,

945
00:54:19.381 --> 00:54:24.060
this leads us to,
I'm going to hit a couple of,
uh,
couple of rapid fire questions.

946
00:54:24.061 --> 00:54:27.430
I'll try not to make them long winded and therefore not wrapping it all.
Yeah.

947
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:32.640
But if you could put one short message,
word,

948
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:35.400
quote,
anything on a billboard,
metaphorically speaking,

949
00:54:35.401 --> 00:54:38.040
just to get a message out to millions or billions of people,

950
00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:38.780
what would you put on it?

951
00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:42.110
<v 1>You know,
I heard you ask this question to Wim Hoff and he said,</v>

952
00:54:42.111 --> 00:54:45.440
breathe motherfucker either motherfucker.
That was like the best answer to that.

953
00:54:45.441 --> 00:54:47.030
So I think about this and you know,

954
00:54:47.031 --> 00:54:51.920
I think other podcasters who've Kinda co-opted that question and ask it and you

955
00:54:51.921 --> 00:54:54.530
know,
I was thinking about that question and you know,

956
00:54:54.531 --> 00:54:57.800
I was thinking I wasn't happy with my answer and then I realized like what I

957
00:54:57.801 --> 00:54:58.311
feel now,

958
00:54:58.311 --> 00:55:01.910
what best express the state I'm in is what I would put on that billboard that

959
00:55:01.911 --> 00:55:06.350
was shown everywhere.
I would say welcome to heaven population,
everyone.

960
00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:11.780
And that's really what I feel like we have this choice right now to engage with

961
00:55:11.781 --> 00:55:14.150
life,
all of life and all the opportunity.

962
00:55:14.151 --> 00:55:18.800
Just smell and eat and travel and converse and meet people and have sex and

963
00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:22.340
enjoy and create and build like this can be having.

964
00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:24.710
But we got to get out of our own mental health first.

965
00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:27.590
And so reminding people like,
Hey,
you know,
all right,

966
00:55:27.591 --> 00:55:31.250
extenuating circumstances maybe you know Sarajevo in certain places.
Yeah,

967
00:55:31.251 --> 00:55:34.570
it's fucking tough.
I get it externally it might be hell,
but for most of us,

968
00:55:34.571 --> 00:55:38.980
especially listening to this podcast,
we're in heaven,
we're in heaven like,

969
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:42.470
and it's just our choice whether we want to engage in it that way or whether we

970
00:55:42.471 --> 00:55:44.570
want to get stuck in our own patterns that keep us in hell.

971
00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:49.130
<v 0>What,
what tools?
And I'll volunteer one.
I'm,</v>

972
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:52.860
I'm a Beta testing this so it's not really fair,

973
00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:56.040
but I'm Beta testing the waking up APP,

974
00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:58.380
which Sam Harris is putting together and it's,

975
00:55:58.381 --> 00:56:02.910
it's actually been tremendously helpful and very unlike other programs that

976
00:56:02.911 --> 00:56:07.911
tested for producing the non ordinary states of awareness that one might

977
00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:17.460
correlate to the second Adeleke experience and Sam's no stranger in that arena,

978
00:56:17.461 --> 00:56:19.510
but he certainly,
uh,

979
00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:24.040
passed on the chemical and plant to focus

980
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.980
<v 1>on the meditative component.
Uh,</v>

981
00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:32.580
and I've found that very helpful for becoming less reactive and more response

982
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:38.910
able in terms of being able to choose the lens through which I look at the day

983
00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:40.330
and my interactions.
What,

984
00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:44.350
what else have you found helpful personally for living that billboard?

985
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:45.401
You know,

986
00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:50.401
one of the best ones that I've found is came to me really unusually and it's the

987
00:56:50.831 --> 00:56:55.630
practice of ecstatic dance and cause a lot of,
even psychedelics,
psychedelics,

988
00:56:55.631 --> 00:56:58.210
that kind of project your consciousness out of body,
you know,

989
00:56:58.310 --> 00:57:00.700
from my very first experience was like my body was gone.

990
00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:03.010
Like I didn't have that body somatic awareness.

991
00:57:03.011 --> 00:57:07.540
So it was creating and patterning the separation between consciousness,
mind,

992
00:57:07.541 --> 00:57:12.040
and body.
And then when I first did the ecstatic dance practice,
I had no idea.

993
00:57:12.041 --> 00:57:14.110
I was like,
oh my gosh,
this is really uncomfortable.

994
00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:16.960
Because the idea is you listen to music and then you just move.

995
00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:20.890
Not trying to have a blindfold a lot of times are really dark room and you just

996
00:57:20.891 --> 00:57:24.220
move and expressive ways that push the boundaries of what your body is

997
00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:25.750
comfortable with,
not physically,

998
00:57:25.751 --> 00:57:28.960
but comfortable and moving and just collapsed the mind.

999
00:57:28.961 --> 00:57:32.980
Get to a state of superfluidity kind of flow state where it's just music and

1000
00:57:32.981 --> 00:57:36.910
body.
And I was shocked at how I responded.
I mean,

1001
00:57:36.911 --> 00:57:40.960
tons of emotions came up,
tons of like clarity came up.

1002
00:57:40.961 --> 00:57:44.590
I had visions that were coming through in that experience and it was just

1003
00:57:44.591 --> 00:57:45.610
massive,

1004
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:50.670
massive transformation for me because I felt it all the way through to my cells,

1005
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:53.380
you know,
instead of getting the body out of the way,

1006
00:57:53.381 --> 00:57:57.070
it was using the body as a tool to enhance my consciousness.

1007
00:57:57.250 --> 00:58:00.640
And so it unified everything else instead of siloing it and kind of pulling it

1008
00:58:00.641 --> 00:58:05.350
apart.
Right?
It was pushing it all together in a really powerful way.

1009
00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:08.950
And you know,
I've started leading those practices and doing those frequently.

1010
00:58:08.951 --> 00:58:12.270
Like I will,
if I'm feeling Funky,
I'll just put on music,

1011
00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:14.290
put on a Hoodie and I can be anywhere.

1012
00:58:14.291 --> 00:58:17.350
I was just in Venice doing it and my little rental house in the middle of the

1013
00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:20.650
day and I felt a feeling kind of funky from,
I'm recording the book and whatever.

1014
00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:25.270
I just start moving and I contentionally find those patterns that sends off the

1015
00:58:25.271 --> 00:58:25.931
alarm signals.

1016
00:58:25.931 --> 00:58:29.210
Like don't move your hips like that cause you'll be gay if you like.

1017
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:33.370
If you move your arms too far out,
like they extend beyond one foot Dotoly gay,

1018
00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:34.900
you can't do that,
you know,

1019
00:58:34.901 --> 00:58:37.930
and just force yourself to move into these other patterns that you're

1020
00:58:37.931 --> 00:58:42.700
uncomfortable with and let it let your body like let your body loose,

1021
00:58:42.730 --> 00:58:43.720
like let your body free.

1022
00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:48.460
We bind that up just like we bind up our psyche and when you unbind the body and

1023
00:58:48.461 --> 00:58:51.400
allow it to express freely in this safe container,

1024
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:54.820
not saying go to the club and do it.
You know?
That's a lot of external pressure,

1025
00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:57.700
right?
But in this case,
you know,
do it by yourself in a dark room.

1026
00:58:57.701 --> 00:58:58.391
Put on some music,

1027
00:58:58.391 --> 00:59:01.720
put on something with a tribal beat and force yourself to move in those

1028
00:59:01.721 --> 00:59:05.980
uncomfortable patterns and see what boundaries and restrictions you have for

1029
00:59:05.981 --> 00:59:08.740
yourself.
And then realize like where is that coming from?
Yeah.

1030
00:59:08.770 --> 00:59:13.720
I can't allow myself to move in space right by myself in the dark.

1031
00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:15.340
What the hell?
You know?

1032
00:59:15.341 --> 00:59:19.870
And so that's been a really cool tool for me that I don't think a lot of people

1033
00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:23.030
are engaging,
but it's something that ancestrally,
man,

1034
00:59:23.031 --> 00:59:27.110
everybody was dancing as part of like Sundance rituals,
trance dance rituals,

1035
00:59:27.111 --> 00:59:31.280
all these dance rituals.
That was part of a major part of ceremony for people.

1036
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:35.270
And I think it's great to make you feel more human again and take that

1037
00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:38.990
performance aspect off of dancing.
Like when you dance in public,

1038
00:59:38.991 --> 00:59:41.690
it's like a mating dance.
It's like performance show.

1039
00:59:41.691 --> 00:59:44.930
It's all about how you look in this case and not,
it doesn't matter how you look.

1040
00:59:44.931 --> 00:59:47.330
It doesn't matter if these been approximates dancing as well.

1041
00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:48.740
Getting your body to move.

1042
00:59:48.741 --> 00:59:53.741
And so many times just the tears will flow and the emotions will come up.

1043
00:59:53.991 --> 00:59:57.030
Sometimes rage and anger sometimes.
Ah,

1044
00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:59.960
well I'll come out in that too if I've been bottling that up.

1045
01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:03.890
So it just allows the instrument to release and expel anything that's been

1046
01:00:03.891 --> 01:00:08.660
holding.
And typically by the end,
you know,
you just allow that,
those snowflakes,

1047
01:00:08.661 --> 01:00:12.500
the joy to just come in and touch the skin.
It's,
it's dope.
How long,

1048
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:16.520
how long is the session typically?
How frequently do you try and do it?

1049
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:20.690
Any music recommendations?
Yeah.
Um,

1050
01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.290
you can do it shorter,
but I think minimum you need,

1051
01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:27.800
you need probably 2030 minutes because the first 10,

1052
01:00:27.801 --> 01:00:30.110
15 minutes you're still going to be getting into it.

1053
01:00:30.111 --> 01:00:32.150
And like the real magic happens in the middle.

1054
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:35.480
And then fatigue starts setting depending on your fitness level,

1055
01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:39.770
around 30 to 40 minutes.
So I try to take an arch from,
actually when I do it,

1056
01:00:39.771 --> 01:00:43.220
I follow Stan graphs,
basic prenatal matrix kind of model.

1057
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:46.550
I don't know what that is.
Okay.
So that starts like you're in the womb,
right?

1058
01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:50.540
It's something very comfortable.
Some kind of music that's,
you know,
smooth.

1059
01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:53.280
It's like you're,
everything's taken care of.
The universe is good.

1060
01:00:53.281 --> 01:00:57.040
Some very kind of happy.
Any,
any playlist.
So you can recommend or um,

1061
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:59.690
what would people search for that,
for that music?

1062
01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:04.790
Anything with kind of like a very slow,
positive kind of be,
you know,
I have,

1063
01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:09.370
I have like obscure spiritual music,
massage,
tribal music.

1064
01:01:09.690 --> 01:01:14.540
Yeah.
It's just like,
feels good,
it's happy.
And then,
um,

1065
01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:16.280
then I go into,

1066
01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:19.340
then the next thing that happens is like the water breaks is chaos,
right?

1067
01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:23.060
So chaos around you.
You know,
you're imagining in this,
in the birth process,

1068
01:01:23.061 --> 01:01:23.781
the water breaks,

1069
01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:26.810
you don't know what's happening in the world as it allows is like five minutes,

1070
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:29.690
10 minutes,
I'd like six,
seven minutes and it's just kind of sweating.

1071
01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:32.070
I usually stretch.
A lot of times it's kind of stretch.

1072
01:01:32.071 --> 01:01:35.630
Sometimes I lie on the ground a little bit,
a little bit,
joint mobility,

1073
01:01:35.631 --> 01:01:38.450
a little bit stretched and getting into it.
And then,
you know,

1074
01:01:38.451 --> 01:01:41.870
if I'm doing the practice,
I'll go into that more chaotic mode,

1075
01:01:41.871 --> 01:01:45.840
which is a little still hard to dance to.
And it forces me to do weird patterns.

1076
01:01:45.841 --> 01:01:48.740
And I like violin,
like Lindsey Sterling.
Oh yeah,
that's a great one.

1077
01:01:48.741 --> 01:01:53.140
And then so it's like some weird kind of Staccato violence and beats antique.
Uh,

1078
01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:56.840
music is sometimes good in there.
Something that you tend to is great.

1079
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:59.600
Beats Antique,
exhaustive Lindsey Stirling Violin.
Also,

1080
01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:01.490
we brought up Alice Little earlier,

1081
01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:05.420
one of her favorite types of music to have sex to no shit side.
And I see that,

1082
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:06.463
I see that.

1083
01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:11.750
Then from there I go to like there is the fight and that's where you actually

1084
01:02:11.751 --> 01:02:14.870
see the birth canal and you know,
you have a goal,
tunnel vision.

1085
01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.310
You got to get out,
you got to breathe,

1086
01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.260
you're going to fight with everything you have to breathe.

1087
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:19.860
And that's that warrior archetype.

1088
01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:23.910
So for that it's almost always tribe called red.
Like that's my go to.

1089
01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:27.370
And that's like Edm mixed with um,

1090
01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:32.130
like tribal native American cries and there's some great,
great tracks or that,

1091
01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:36.930
um,
like,
uh,
electric powwow,
like some awesome tracks for that.

1092
01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.030
And then so from there,

1093
01:02:39.031 --> 01:02:41.790
and that's where you really start to express that kind of warrior archetype.

1094
01:02:41.850 --> 01:02:43.680
And allow any of those emotions to come.

1095
01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:48.750
And then finally at the end is the more kind of ecstatic,

1096
01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:50.610
blissful,
but still a beat.

1097
01:02:50.611 --> 01:02:54.360
So something like really upbeat Edm or some really positive,
uplifting music.

1098
01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:58.500
And I usually will take a break with something that's kind of quiet and serene,

1099
01:02:58.501 --> 01:03:02.910
like welcome to Africa.
Everything is beautiful kind of vibe.

1100
01:03:02.911 --> 01:03:04.770
And then into some more,
you know,

1101
01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:09.600
positive message like Edm and just kind of dance it out and really enjoy and

1102
01:03:09.601 --> 01:03:14.280
express like the happiness of taking that breath.
Rebirthing becoming a new,

1103
01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:18.800
you know,
being,
embracing your new self.
And that's the BBM four,

1104
01:03:18.810 --> 01:03:22.860
which is the,
you know,
the ecstasy of,
of breath and a,
and so that's the,

1105
01:03:22.861 --> 01:03:26.090
that's the pathway for the full kind of shamonic roads.

1106
01:03:26.090 --> 01:03:30.510
Sometimes I'll just go straight to the,
uh,
straight to the tribe called red.
My,

1107
01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:31.363
you know,
are,

1108
01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:34.680
I think you've met him to Port Augie who came out with this Iowasca remixed

1109
01:03:34.681 --> 01:03:38.670
album.
He's got a couple of great tribal drum tracks,
which are good.
Um,

1110
01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:42.780
there's a remix from drum spider and a mosaic in there.

1111
01:03:42.781 --> 01:03:47.310
I think it's tracks three and tracks eight on that.
You can get it on Spotify.
Um,

1112
01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:51.690
but I can share a Spotify playlist to have her for an ecstatic dance.
I will,

1113
01:03:51.691 --> 01:03:52.530
for everybody listening,

1114
01:03:52.531 --> 01:03:57.531
I'll put the Spotify playlist in the show notes and it's what strikes me

1115
01:03:58.771 --> 01:03:59.590
listening to this,
because I,

1116
01:03:59.590 --> 01:04:04.590
I knew nothing about extended dance is that the narrative is really important.

1117
01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:09.840
A meeting,
it seems like the,
it's not,
it's not the hero's journey,
but the,

1118
01:04:09.841 --> 01:04:14.730
the narrative arc of the playlist is really important.

1119
01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:19.140
Yeah.
And this is just something that I came up with.
I've been,
uh,
obviously,

1120
01:04:19.141 --> 01:04:21.300
you know,
my father worked with Stan Grof,
so I've been,

1121
01:04:21.301 --> 01:04:24.570
he's used that metaphor and it can just kind of stuck with me like,
oh yeah,

1122
01:04:24.571 --> 01:04:28.650
these are all things we feel.
Everything's cool.
Oh Shit,
everything's not cool.

1123
01:04:28.770 --> 01:04:31.170
Everything's fucked up.
And then like,
all right,

1124
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:33.780
everything's fucked up and I'm going to fight and I don't care and there's a way

1125
01:04:33.781 --> 01:04:36.390
out and I'm going to fucking make it.
And it's just kind of pound your chest.

1126
01:04:36.391 --> 01:04:38.850
Like,
I got this.
And then it's like through the other side.

1127
01:04:38.851 --> 01:04:42.630
Like I got this because I got all this help and I'm fucking grateful and here I

1128
01:04:42.631 --> 01:04:46.950
am.
And that's,
you know,
the tears really flow like at the end.
And you're like,

1129
01:04:46.951 --> 01:04:48.030
man,
life is good.

1130
01:04:48.290 --> 01:04:53.010
And do you use this therapeutically when needed or was it something that you do?

1131
01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.020
Uh,

1132
01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:59.670
preemptively or on a scheduled basis to prevent?

1133
01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:04.910
Yeah,
I should do it more like prophylactically,
like preventatively,
but I,

1134
01:05:04.911 --> 01:05:07.860
I tend to do it when I feel funky.
Like when I feel Funky,

1135
01:05:07.861 --> 01:05:11.430
I'm either changing my temperature drastically going in the sauna,
um,

1136
01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:16.380
or join in the cold or doing something like this and,

1137
01:05:16.381 --> 01:05:20.050
but this is probably the best tool because everything,

1138
01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:23.990
it really just unifies everything for me.
You know,
it brings,

1139
01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:26.290
brings it all together.
You don't need anything,

1140
01:05:26.291 --> 01:05:29.110
you just need a little bit of privacy or someone you feel comfortable.

1141
01:05:29.111 --> 01:05:32.800
Now at this point I'm actually comfortable doing it with other people like

1142
01:05:32.801 --> 01:05:34.690
watching,
cause I've talked about it and um,
you know,

1143
01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:36.400
and it's a little external pressure,

1144
01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:38.790
but then you just breathe into that pressure.
Like the,

1145
01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:40.930
the goal here is to go where you're uncomfortable.

1146
01:05:40.931 --> 01:05:42.820
So like when you're comfortable alone,

1147
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.640
then invite somebody who might be a little judgmental and see,
all right,

1148
01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:47.580
can you still dance?
Can you still do it?

1149
01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:50.320
Because I guarantee you by the time you're done and you've just expressed

1150
01:05:50.321 --> 01:05:50.920
yourself,

1151
01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.590
their judgment's going to be gone and they'll probably be dancing with you,

1152
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:58.330
you know,
so breathing in and it's that,
you know,
kind of stoic training,

1153
01:05:58.331 --> 01:06:00.760
like breathe into those areas where you feel restricted,

1154
01:06:00.761 --> 01:06:02.230
where you feel judgmental,

1155
01:06:02.231 --> 01:06:06.430
where you feel like the eyes are on you and try to unify that all together.
Yeah.

1156
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:11.590
It reminds me of a quote and I'm not going to get the attribution right.

1157
01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:16.360
Wait a second.
Donald Neale Walsch,
maybe someone,
I'm sure it might be Jim around,

1158
01:06:16.361 --> 01:06:19.570
someone can correct me,
but life begins at the end of your comfort zone.

1159
01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:23.320
This is,
and how do you put that into practice?

1160
01:06:23.321 --> 01:06:27.520
It's with activities like this,

1161
01:06:27.810 --> 01:06:31.360
training regiments like this,
especially for men who are tough,

1162
01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:36.250
like men are tough and like a tough man and get in a cold bath and a tough man.

1163
01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:39.520
You can get in a,
in a sauna for a long time.
And it's like,

1164
01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:42.970
it's in our sweet spot.
We're like,
yeah,
I got that.
It's uncomfortable discomfort.

1165
01:06:42.971 --> 01:06:45.310
It's comfortable discomfort.
This is uncomfortable.

1166
01:06:45.311 --> 01:06:49.150
This guy getting your arms way out there and moving those around and checking

1167
01:06:49.151 --> 01:06:52.240
your hips.
Woo.
That's uncomfortable.
Yeah.
Comfortable.

1168
01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.130
But when you break those patterns,

1169
01:06:54.131 --> 01:06:58.740
then there's just a whole new freedom that's available.
So you mentioned,
we'll,

1170
01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:02.890
we'll go for just a couple more minutes,
but you mentioned the book.

1171
01:07:03.070 --> 01:07:07.570
So I've copied this at home and the number of people picked it up and also

1172
01:07:08.410 --> 01:07:11.770
almost immediately gone to the sex chapters under understandably.

1173
01:07:11.771 --> 01:07:16.360
But can you describe the book?
Give us,
give us,
uh,

1174
01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:19.750
a preview.
Why,
why the book?
What is it called?

1175
01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:23.350
Had you choose the contents.
So let's start there.

1176
01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:28.570
What really this book is the embodiment of that idea of total human
optimization,

1177
01:07:28.571 --> 01:07:32.260
which is not just one thing.
You know,
I really admire the people,
you know,

1178
01:07:32.261 --> 01:07:33.400
yourself is one of those people.

1179
01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:38.450
You'll track something down to the very end degree and like really bring home

1180
01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:40.420
the bones of that truth from your journey.

1181
01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:43.180
And I've been surrounded by a lot of people who've done that,

1182
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:47.050
but what I felt like was missing was someone to bring it all together.

1183
01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:50.980
Like bring all the practices who've tried all of the different things and how

1184
01:07:50.981 --> 01:07:51.611
does that look?

1185
01:07:51.611 --> 01:07:54.790
How does it look to go through a day like what's the morning things you do?
Okay.

1186
01:07:54.791 --> 01:07:56.860
Hydration,
light,
movement.
Okay.

1187
01:07:56.861 --> 01:08:00.640
Then how do you bring in Wim Hoff breathing and cold exposure,
heat exposure.

1188
01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:02.710
What are the nutrition principles you want?

1189
01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:04.540
Like how do you optimize your commute to work?

1190
01:08:04.541 --> 01:08:08.440
What are some workplace practices that you've learned?
Then how when you go home,

1191
01:08:08.441 --> 01:08:12.880
how do you relax and connect with yourself and connect with your family and your

1192
01:08:12.881 --> 01:08:14.890
friends and how do you drink a glass of wine?

1193
01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:16.650
What's too much glass of what's too much wine?

1194
01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:19.280
What happens when you drink too much?
Because that's all part of life.

1195
01:08:19.281 --> 01:08:23.840
Like addressing all of those things,
how to have great sex and then how to,

1196
01:08:24.090 --> 01:08:24.350
you know,

1197
01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:27.680
transition from that into the time before bed where you're taking care of

1198
01:08:27.681 --> 01:08:29.840
yourself and journaling.
And then from there,

1199
01:08:29.841 --> 01:08:33.380
the sleep practices sleep was a huge one for me because everybody is telling
you,

1200
01:08:33.381 --> 01:08:35.570
and there's a bunch of bullshit out there.
Like everybody's saying,
Oh,

1201
01:08:35.571 --> 01:08:38.870
you need eight,
eight,
eight,
eight hours of uninterrupted sleep.

1202
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:40.520
Like that's a fucking fantasy.

1203
01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:45.380
Like I might as well be riding a fucking unicorn with the rainbow headband.

1204
01:08:45.381 --> 01:08:47.470
Like if that's not going to happen for me,
you know.

1205
01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:49.850
So I read Nick Little Hill's books,
sleep,

1206
01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:53.060
and he talks about getting 30 to 35 sleep cycles a week.

1207
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:56.490
And then changing the dynamic of that,
utilizing naps more.

1208
01:08:56.490 --> 01:09:00.680
I napped right before this podcast and how naps are reliably shown to be more

1209
01:09:00.681 --> 01:09:02.990
effective than more overnight sleep or more coffee.

1210
01:09:02.991 --> 01:09:06.230
And so just bringing in all these interesting things from books I've read,

1211
01:09:06.231 --> 01:09:07.760
people I've met with,
you know,

1212
01:09:07.761 --> 01:09:11.210
people who've researched in different areas and try to bring this into a

1213
01:09:11.211 --> 01:09:14.870
comprehensive day along with all my own mindset practices.

1214
01:09:14.871 --> 01:09:16.340
Like talking about mental override,

1215
01:09:16.341 --> 01:09:19.910
telling stories about Bodie Miller and the great fighters I know and the great

1216
01:09:19.911 --> 01:09:24.830
champions.
I know.
And just put this together and also remind people like,
Hey,

1217
01:09:24.831 --> 01:09:27.410
like I'm not,
I haven't got it all right.
You know,

1218
01:09:27.411 --> 01:09:31.460
I tell the stories of when I used to eat like relentlessly eat cinnamon pop

1219
01:09:31.461 --> 01:09:32.294
tarts.

1220
01:09:32.310 --> 01:09:37.130
I like how unbelievably unfathomably nutritionally bad that was,
you know,

1221
01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:40.340
it's like sugar frosting on sugar dough,

1222
01:09:40.341 --> 01:09:45.000
on sugar filling like triple the triple crown.

1223
01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:48.140
What was that?
You know,
but I was there,
I did that stuff.

1224
01:09:48.141 --> 01:09:50.840
The double western Bacon cheeseburgers and how,

1225
01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:54.290
what the new double western Bacon cheeseburger looks like with grass fed beef

1226
01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:57.050
and raw cheese and sprouted or sourdough bread and,

1227
01:09:57.410 --> 01:10:00.320
and how you can just live this robust life,
you know,

1228
01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:03.020
not engaging with capital f fear,

1229
01:10:03.021 --> 01:10:07.010
which is I think the virus that underpins a lot of our malaise and try to have a

1230
01:10:07.011 --> 01:10:11.030
real healthy,
joyful expression and you know,
recognize this life,

1231
01:10:11.031 --> 01:10:13.450
as I said on that billboard,
you know,
welcome to have it.

1232
01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:17.690
What is the title of the book books called own the day.
Own your life.

1233
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:21.860
And the idea is,
you know,
fuck all these long winded transformational programs.

1234
01:10:21.861 --> 01:10:25.340
We focus on one thing for 30 days,
40 days,
90 days.

1235
01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:30.260
Let's just focus on doing one day awesomely,
you know,
from top to bottom,

1236
01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:34.310
schedule it out,
get all the practices in line.
I have very clear prescriptions.

1237
01:10:34.311 --> 01:10:38.180
Let's just focus on one day and see how you feel living one day like that.

1238
01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.030
And that's all you gotta do.
Just commit to one day,
not only one day,

1239
01:10:41.330 --> 01:10:44.000
just commit to one hour at a time.
Just commit to like,
all right,

1240
01:10:44.001 --> 01:10:45.920
what are the three things I've got to do when I wake up?
All Right,

1241
01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:49.610
12 ounces of water with some sea salt and some lemon.
Okay,
I got that.
All right,

1242
01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:52.550
10 minutes of sunlight.
Okay,
I got that.
A little bit of movement.
Okay,
I got that.

1243
01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:55.820
Who onto the next thing you know,
that's all he gotta do.
Step by step.

1244
01:10:56.010 --> 01:11:00.290
Relax into the process.
Do it for one day and see what changes in your life.

1245
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:05.270
And when in doubt,
six breaths,
six breaths to quell the dragon fire.

1246
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:10.040
So you don't burn down villages.
Uh,
what,

1247
01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:13.980
uh,
this is the,
the book.
Do you have a,
do you have a

1248
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.390
<v 0>site for the book?
Yeah,
own the day.</v>

1249
01:11:15.391 --> 01:11:18.990
book.com the day book.com.

1250
01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:25.460
And if,
if you were,
let's see,
I'm trying to think of the right age to,

1251
01:11:25.461 --> 01:11:29.280
to see,
you can choose the age of your younger self.

1252
01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:34.530
So it could be at that 29 30 just gay start with on.
It could be far before.

1253
01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:38.520
Could be.
You have a year ago.
It doesn't matter.
You can pick the age.

1254
01:11:38.521 --> 01:11:40.020
But what did,
what advice,

1255
01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:43.260
if you had to give advice to your younger self or someone just like you,

1256
01:11:43.261 --> 01:11:46.080
cause a lot of people like me or like I don't want to step on the butterfly

1257
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:48.690
because I'm pretty happy with where I am.
So I wouldn't give any advice.

1258
01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:54.260
But if you had to give some advice to either a younger version of yourself or

1259
01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:55.990
does someone who's similarly built?

1260
01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:00.910
<v 1>Yeah,
advice to my younger self is going to be,
you know,</v>

1261
01:12:01.570 --> 01:12:05.500
relax man.
It's going to be all right.
That's gonna fucking be all right.
You know,

1262
01:12:05.501 --> 01:12:07.960
it's,
it's this crazy thing where like in hindsight,

1263
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:11.620
we can always look backwards and say,
man,
I'm grateful for all that shit.

1264
01:12:11.650 --> 01:12:14.770
Like I'm grateful for all of my failures.
But with foresight,

1265
01:12:14.771 --> 01:12:17.170
we look at everything that's coming ahead with terror.

1266
01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:20.210
This next thing is going to be,
oh,
that's going to be the one that knocks me out.

1267
01:12:20.211 --> 01:12:20.901
Oh,
that next deal.

1268
01:12:20.901 --> 01:12:23.410
And it's going to be the one that kills me or that next failure that's going to

1269
01:12:23.411 --> 01:12:26.500
be devastating.
But always in hindsight,
we're grateful.

1270
01:12:26.501 --> 01:12:30.760
So what if we switched our hindsight into foresight and it was like,
oh,

1271
01:12:30.761 --> 01:12:32.980
whatever happens,
I'll just be grateful for it later anyways.

1272
01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:36.430
And then all of a sudden we're really enjoying ourselves,
you know?

1273
01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:39.250
And I was terrible at that.
The first few years I started on it,

1274
01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:43.120
I was petrified that it was going to fail because I was so attached to its

1275
01:12:43.121 --> 01:12:45.670
success.
I'm finally doing it.
I'm finally doing it.
It's gonna fail.

1276
01:12:45.970 --> 01:12:48.190
It's gonna fail.
It's gonna fail.
I'm gonna ruin it,
you know?

1277
01:12:48.191 --> 01:12:49.180
And I didn't enjoy it.

1278
01:12:49.210 --> 01:12:53.680
And it didn't really enjoy those initial formative years like I could have and

1279
01:12:53.681 --> 01:12:53.861
you know,

1280
01:12:53.861 --> 01:12:58.690
so in almost every age and almost every year it would be relaxed man.

1281
01:12:58.691 --> 01:13:02.560
Trust,
like trust,
whatever happens,
you'll figure out a way you'll be better,

1282
01:13:02.561 --> 01:13:05.590
stronger,
faster,
you know,
wiser for it.

1283
01:13:05.591 --> 01:13:07.840
So be grateful for it in advance,

1284
01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:09.590
<v 0>dig it,
dig it.</v>

1285
01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:14.780
And where can people say hi on the Internet,

1286
01:13:14.781 --> 01:13:18.470
learn more about what you're up to,
where would you like people to check you out,

1287
01:13:18.471 --> 01:13:19.520
your projects and so on?

1288
01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:22.590
<v 1>Yeah,
I think I,
you know,
Instagram is probably my most active,
you know,</v>

1289
01:13:22.591 --> 01:13:26.640
I post to all the social platforms but it's just at Aubrey Marcus on Instagram

1290
01:13:26.641 --> 01:13:31.410
and I curate all those posts myself and it's a good wide variety of me doing

1291
01:13:31.411 --> 01:13:35.430
weird stuff in the gym and me posting spiritual quotes in different ideas.

1292
01:13:35.431 --> 01:13:39.690
And I actually look forward to those times where I get sideswiped by the

1293
01:13:39.691 --> 01:13:43.890
universe cause I always have some Pearl I can come and I generally put that out

1294
01:13:43.891 --> 01:13:45.330
on Instagram or a podcast.

1295
01:13:45.331 --> 01:13:47.970
And then of course my podcast to the Aubrey Marcus podcast.

1296
01:13:47.971 --> 01:13:51.450
That's a great place to listen to me.
Have some cool conversations with people.

1297
01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:55.710
Perfect.
And I will link to all of that in the show notes for folks as usual.
Tim.

1298
01:13:55.711 --> 01:13:59.790
Dot.
Blog forward slash podcast for all of the links,
resources,
books,

1299
01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:04.560
and so on that we've discussed.
A good to hang man.
Yeah,
man.
Yeah,
I'll go.

1300
01:14:04.561 --> 01:14:06.060
I'll go under over.
There we go.

1301
01:14:06.061 --> 01:14:08.910
We're still figuring out the set up here with the wires.
None of that is,

1302
01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:11.910
that is my fault.
I'll take all the blame slash coach the gun under

1303
01:14:12.210 --> 01:14:15.280
<v 0>a,
it's okay.
Next time.
Next time.
How's your father?</v>

1304
01:14:18.210 --> 01:14:21.210
Uh,
you know,
there's a,
there's,
I had a friend who was a,

1305
01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:24.010
grew up in a cannibal tribe and that was the traditional,
yeah,

1306
01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:26.210
that was a tradition is a famous author by the way.
Yeah.

1307
01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:27.700
And that was the traditional greeting.

1308
01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:30.550
They would grab each other's genitals and give them,
they would tell them,

1309
01:14:30.551 --> 01:14:34.050
you know what?
They'd tell them,
no,
I would eat your feces.
Wow.
That was the Greek.

1310
01:14:34.051 --> 01:14:36.310
Grab someone's genitals and say,
oh,
your feces.

1311
01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:40.660
I hear that's the new thing to do in Brooklyn.
Hipster way to do it guys.

1312
01:14:40.661 --> 01:14:42.910
So feel free to take that,
by the way,

1313
01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:46.330
0.01% people who listen to this podcast and take everything literally.

1314
01:14:46.331 --> 01:14:49.140
That's true.
Please don't do that.
You might get shot in the face.
No,

1315
01:14:49.141 --> 01:14:53.440
that's not allowed.
I Aubrey,
always fun to hang,
man.
Thanks Greg.
Great time.

1316
01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:58.300
Thanks for [inaudible] and to everybody listening,
as always.
Until next time,

1317
01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:03.070

Be Safe out there and don't forget six breaths.

1318
01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:04.150
Talk to you soon.
