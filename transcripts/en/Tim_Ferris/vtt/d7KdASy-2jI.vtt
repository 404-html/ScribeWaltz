2
00:00:02.451 --> 00:00:07.250
What you are about to hear is part two of a two part conversation with Alex

3
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:07.430

4
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.430

5
00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:17.501
also co founder of gimlet media which has produced to blockbuster podcasts at

6
00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:20.540
the time of this particular episode,

7
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.300
namely Startup and reply all.

8
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.920
He is a true master of storytelling,
crafting,
narrative,
radio,

9
00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:31.160
interviewing and much more.
If you didn't catch the first part,

10
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.110
you might want to do that before venturing in,

11
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.840
but you can certainly listen to this independently.

12
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.880
This second part is an excerpt from a masterclass that he taught on creative

13
00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:45.881
live.com I think costs about $99 and it is phenomenal.

14
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.080
Specifically in this portion we are going to look at the art of the interview

15
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.650
and how to craft and find the perfect question so I hope you enjoy it and

16
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.630

17
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.500
please enjoy part two of the Tim Ferriss show with Alex Bloomberg.

18
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.430
<v 1>Optimal.
At this altitude,</v>

19
00:01:03.431 --> 00:01:08.000
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.
Question.

20
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.320
I'm a cybernetic organism,
living tissue over.

21
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.240
<v 2>What we're going to be talking about,
uh,</v>

22
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.550
in this segment is the art of the interview.
Um,

23
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.480
and what I'm going to be covering today,
uh,

24
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.120
what I'm going to be covering this in this section is first of all,

25
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.640
like sort of the most basic question,
which is what,

26
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.130
what are you going for when you're interviewing somebody?

27
00:01:42.131 --> 00:01:44.440
What are you trying to get out of it?
What is the thing that you want to,

28
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.290
what does a,
what does a good interview look like?
Right?

29
00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:51.310
What does it feel like when it's happening?
Um,
uh,
and as part of that,

30
00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:55.270
I'm going to go through what to ask.
How do you come up with the questions,
uh,

31
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.450
to ask?
Um,
and uh,

32
00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:02.560
and I mean maybe talking a little bit about the power of the right question.

33
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.030
Um,
uh,
and then I'm also going to be talking about nuts and bolts.

34
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.380
So that's coming up.
Um,
so,
uh,

35
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.030
what are you going for?
Um,
so the first thing that you're,

36
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.710
that you're going for a,
is what we,
what we talked about in the last section,

37
00:02:20.711 --> 00:02:23.850
which is a fintech moments of,
you know,

38
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.790
sort of authentic moments of authentic emotion,
authentic sort of realization,

39
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.600
authentic moments of humor is something that feels like a real emotion.

40
00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:34.480
Like those,
those are golden moments in an interview.
And that's sort of,

41
00:02:34.481 --> 00:02:36.850
that's one of the things that you're absolutely want to go for.

42
00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:39.010
And we talked a little bit about that before and I'm going to talk about that a

43
00:02:39.011 --> 00:02:40.420
little bit later.
Um,

44
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.530
but the thing that I want to focus on now is the other thing that we're talking

45
00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:49.350
about is,
um,
stories and this and that.
And I am,

46
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.340
I have a,
um,
have had sort of a,
a very specific meaning when I,

47
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.060
when I say what an actual story is.
Um,
but I'm going to,
um,

48
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.220
but I think the first thing to do is to,
is to,
sorry,
sorry.
Uh,

49
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.920
I think the first thing to do is,
uh,

50
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.670
to play you a little bit of what I'm talking about when I'm talking about a

51
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:12.730
story.
So I'm going to play you a little piece of tape.

52
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.820
So this is story that was on this American life a while ago.
And um,

53
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.150
the setup is that is this actor Tate Donovan Donovan is,

54
00:03:21.151 --> 00:03:23.740
it was a sort of a character actor.
He'd been,
you know,

55
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:26.020
sort of on a couple of different shows,
but you can get recognized very much.

56
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.200
And then he had like a stint on friends and all of a sudden you're starting to

57
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:30.250
get recognized.

58
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.550
And it was really exciting for him to be recognized because he finally got to be

59
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.940
the celebrity that he always wished that he could be at the celebrity that he

60
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:43.360
would have wanted to meet before he was famous.
Uh,

61
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.460
so when he got recognized and so one and this story happens when one night he

62
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:51.490
was out at this Broadway show and a lot of people were coming up to him and be

63
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:52.450
like,
Hey,
I saw you.

64
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.690
And he was able to like talk to people and be very magnanimous and say thank you

65
00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:00.910
so much.
It really means a lot.
And he was like posing for pictures for people.

66
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.480
And it was at the show.
It was happening over and over and over again.

67
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.060
<v 3>I was,
I was,
I was exactly how I want it to be.
I was doing it,
I was doing great.</v>

68
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.843
<v 1>And then</v>

69
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.230
<v 3>the kid with the camera came along,</v>

70
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.850
this nervous kid,
he must have been 16 years old,
he's in a rented Tuxedo,

71
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.180
unbelievably like shy and awkward and he's got like an acne and he's got a

72
00:04:29.881 --> 00:04:34.620
camera in his hand and underneath the marquee is his date,

73
00:04:34.621 --> 00:04:37.110
who is literally like a Po,
a prom dress,

74
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.920
and she's got a corsage and she's really,
you know,

75
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.110
nervous and sort of clutching your hands.

76
00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:47.940
And he sort of comes up to me and he sort of mumbles something like,

77
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.080
you know something about a picture.
And I'm like,
I just feel for him.
So I'm like,

78
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.940
oh,
absolutely.
My Gosh,
sure,
no problem.
My God,
you poor thing.
And,

79
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.380
and I go up to,
is it his girlfriend?
I wrap my arms around her and I'm like,
Hey,

80
00:05:01.381 --> 00:05:05.400
where are your from?
Fantastic.
Going to see the play.
It's great.

81
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.790
And the guys sort of not taking the photograph very quickly.

82
00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:10.950
He's just sort of staring at me and he's got his camera,

83
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.760
his hands and standby is like chin,
you know,
and,
and uh,

84
00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:18.210
she's very stiff and awkward and I don't know what to do.

85
00:05:18.211 --> 00:05:23.160
So I just leaned across and I kissed her on the cheek and I'm like,

86
00:05:23.161 --> 00:05:24.990
all right,
God,
take the fixture,
hurry up.

87
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.950
<v 2>Do you guys want to find out what happens next?
That's a story.</v>

88
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.170
Uh,
when you want to,

89
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.500
so what that is the power of a good narrative.

90
00:05:39.661 --> 00:05:42.420
So when I talk about,
I'm talking about like those two basic things,

91
00:05:42.421 --> 00:05:47.380
you're going for emotion and narrative.
We as humans are hardwired,

92
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.190
I believe,
to listen to narrative and,

93
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.050
and it's a very simple sort of the mechanics of narrative or very simple.

94
00:05:55.051 --> 00:05:59.180
There's like a sequence of actions and those sort of rising action and it's

95
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.880
culminating in something.
Um,

96
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.810
and you were in the middle of that sequence of actions and you were about to get

97
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:09.950
to the culmination and I stopped it and it's frustrating and you really want to

98
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:13.010
know what happens next.
And you would never,
if you were listening to this,

99
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:16.010
have turned off that podcast or that radio story at that moment.

100
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.480
And that is a good story.
And that's why you want to operate in stories.

101
00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:22.010
That's why you,
when you're interviewing people,

102
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:25.060
you want to get their stories out of them.
Um,

103
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.670
and you want to get them talking in stories because stories are what we want to

104
00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:32.450
hear.
Um,
and so when you're working in an audio format,

105
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.630
you need to operate in stories.
Um,

106
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.570
the other thing we want to hear as we heard before it is emotion.

107
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:42.680
So those are the two things you're going for it and a good interview.
Um,

108
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:46.010
so moving on,
actually,
do you want to hear what happens next?
All right.
All right.

109
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.490
Um,
I'll rewind it again and then we'll get,
well,
we'll have it play out.

110
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:51.311
<v 3>I don't know what to do.</v>

111
00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:56.260
So I just lean across and I kissed her on the cheek and I'm like,

112
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.070
all right,
go ahead and take the mixture of hurry up.
And,

113
00:06:59.071 --> 00:07:03.400
and finally he sort of like snaps it and uh,
I'm like,
okay,

114
00:07:03.401 --> 00:07:04.360
it was really wonderful to meet you.

115
00:07:04.361 --> 00:07:07.400
And he just like stammered over to me and was like,

116
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.043
<v 4>mmm,</v>

117
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:12.390
<v 3>could you take a picture of us?</v>

118
00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.810
<v 4>Okay.</v>

119
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:14.770
<v 3>Oh,</v>

120
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.760
and the whole time he just wanted me to take a picture of him and his girlfriend

121
00:07:18.761 --> 00:07:22.170
underneath the awning of the play.
He didn't want a picture of me.

122
00:07:22.171 --> 00:07:23.440
I had no idea who I was.

123
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.290
Oh God.

124
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.180
<v 2>Got a little emotion in there too.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

125
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.230
so that is what I'm talking about when it's the right.
So did like very,

126
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.131
very simply,

127
00:07:38.131 --> 00:07:41.310
we're going to be talking a lot more about what story is in the next session,

128
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.050
but,
but very,
very simply,

129
00:07:43.051 --> 00:07:46.570
it is that it is a sequence of actions that culminates in something come,

130
00:07:46.571 --> 00:07:49.350
some sort of revelation,
some sort of punchline,
some sort of jokes.

131
00:07:49.351 --> 00:07:54.090
I'm sort of like realization.
Um,
and more to the point,

132
00:07:54.091 --> 00:07:56.130
it's something that you don't want to turn off that you don't want to stop

133
00:07:56.131 --> 00:07:59.970
listening to.
Um,
and so when,

134
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.610
so that is the thing that's in your mind when you're going out and doing an

135
00:08:02.611 --> 00:08:03.600
interview with anybody.

136
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:08.130
You want to ask questions of the interview subject that are going to either

137
00:08:08.131 --> 00:08:12.900
elicit an honest emotional reaction or they're going to elicit them telling you

138
00:08:12.901 --> 00:08:17.670
a story.
Um,
so,
and there's a lot of things that you can ask,

139
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:21.870
um,
that,
that well,
so let's,
let's talk about that.
So,
um,

140
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.270
so what the ask,
right?

141
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:29.420
So first if you're trying to ask questions that will elicit his story.

142
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.670
Um,
first of all,

143
00:08:32.671 --> 00:08:35.790
you don't want to ask ever really yes or no questions.
I mean,

144
00:08:35.791 --> 00:08:36.930
you've got to get some facts out of the way,

145
00:08:36.931 --> 00:08:39.720
but you don't want to ask a yes or no question because that is not,

146
00:08:39.721 --> 00:08:43.530
that's the end of a story,
right?
Um,
and,
uh,
so you,

147
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:47.280
how you phrase the questions is very,
very important.
Um,

148
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.220
you want to sort of ask questions.
I often sort of say,

149
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:54.780
tell me about the time when you write something,
you know,
you were just like,

150
00:08:54.781 --> 00:08:57.630
you want to tell you,
you can use where it's like,
tell me.
Um,

151
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:02.490
so there are automatically starting to talk to you in,
in story language.
Um,

152
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.270
tell me about the time.
Tell me about the day when you blah,
blah,
blah.

153
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.690
Tell me about the moment when you realized that this was what was going to

154
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:10.950
happen.
Tell me about the,
the,

155
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.720
the time in your life when you were going through this thing.
Um,
uh,

156
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:17.120
another question that works really well.

157
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.460
Tell me the story of just ask them straight up,
right.
You know,

158
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.400
none of this story of this,
how did this happen?
Tell me the story.
You know,

159
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.820
sometimes that works.
Um,
uh,

160
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.140
another thing that you,
when you use that you,
when you're on the right track,

161
00:09:31.141 --> 00:09:31.321
you know,

162
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:34.050
when you're on the right track is when people are actually sort of like talking

163
00:09:34.051 --> 00:09:38.400
to you in dialog.
If somebody is saying,
well,
first I said,
and then she said,

164
00:09:38.401 --> 00:09:42.000
and then I said,
ah,
that's really that.
You know,
you're on the right track here.

165
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.970
So often I will tell people,
you know,

166
00:09:44.971 --> 00:09:47.520
describe the conversation where Blah Blah Blah.

167
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:51.840
And cause if you get people sort of telling you like he said,
then she said,

168
00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:53.520
then he said that she said,
that's great.
You know,

169
00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:56.940
you're on the right track but somebody is telling you a story right then,
um,

170
00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:01.860
cause they're quoting dialogue to,
um,
again,

171
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:05.700
tell me about the,
the,
often what you're going for is a moment of realization.

172
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.280
So a story has to culminate in something often.

173
00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:12.870
It's often the thing that's culminating in is a moment of realization.
Uh,

174
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.860
so you want to say,

175
00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:16.290
tell me about the day that you realize whatever it is that we're talking about

176
00:10:16.291 --> 00:10:21.270
here.
Um,
another thing that really works well,

177
00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:26.040
um,
is if people can sort of talk through a process of,
you know,
there's,

178
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:30.270
there's often steps that led from one situation to the other situation.

179
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.430
What were the steps that got you from one thing to another?

180
00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:37.310
What were the steps that got you from,
you know,
your career in the offer army to,

181
00:10:37.311 --> 00:10:41.880
to your career as a,
as a,
as a celebrity florist or whatever.
Right?
So,

182
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.650
uh,
anybody here have that career trajectory by the way?
Uh,

183
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.790
um,
so,
uh,

184
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.640
so you want to ask that like sort of what were the steps,

185
00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:57.510
if you can get people breaking that down into steps and often each step is its

186
00:10:57.511 --> 00:11:02.460
own story.
So often step one will be,
well,
I was at,
you know,
I was,
I was,
I was at,

187
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.291
I was no,

188
00:11:03.291 --> 00:11:07.410
I had my career in the army and this one thing happened when I was in the army

189
00:11:07.411 --> 00:11:10.260
that this day happened that I wanted,
that made me want to change.

190
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.930
And so they'll tell you that.
And that's a story.
Each step can be its own story,

191
00:11:12.931 --> 00:11:17.040
but the,
the,
that,
that sequence of steps is also a story.
Um,

192
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:22.140
so these are all sort of questions that will,
that will elicit stories.

193
00:11:22.141 --> 00:11:24.450
You want to have people back up,
you want to do all that stuff.
All right,

194
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.570
so that's one whole set of questions.
Um,

195
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:33.270
and often when you're doing,
uh,
so that's a whole set of questions.

196
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:34.920
The other set of questions.

197
00:11:34.921 --> 00:11:38.490
So what do you ask if there's a whole other set of questions that are built

198
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:42.840
around eliciting sort of honest reflection and emotion.

199
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.450
So that's the other stock and trade.

200
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.350
That's the other thing that you're going for,
right?
Pretty simple.
Two things.
Um,

201
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:50.460
so what do you,

202
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:55.660
so what do you ask or when you're trying to get people to tell you,
um,

203
00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:59.950
you don't tell you how they feel.
One question is,
how'd that make you feel?

204
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:06.060
It's pretty straight forward.
Uh,
there's a,
um,
there's a,

205
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.360
I often joke that like doing a good interview for audio and,
and,

206
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:14.530
and having a good sort of therapy session look very similar.

207
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.633
Um,

208
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:20.680
because what you are trying to do is get people to articulate their emotions in

209
00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:23.740
words.
All you have an audio,
our words,
that's all you have.

210
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:27.880
You have people's words.
And so if they're feeling something,

211
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.150
it's like if something happens and you're not shooting at it didn't happen.

212
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.150
If they're feeling something and they don't articulate it,
it also didn't happen.

213
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.510
So you need them to articulate the way they're feeling.

214
00:12:37.511 --> 00:12:39.850
And so a lot of what you're doing is you're in the audience,

215
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.230
you're in the interview,
and you're like,

216
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.810
I noticed feeling and your voice or in your manner,

217
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:48.670
and I want you to articulate that feeling.
Um,
and so,

218
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.900
um,
so that's one thing.
And so that's like how did that make you feel?
Is A,
is a,

219
00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:54.340
is a big,
is a big one.

220
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.990
Often you also want to encourage that kind of reflection.

221
00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:00.970
Some people just aren't very naturally reflective,

222
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.970
but they've gone through something sort of momentous and you want them sort of

223
00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:08.550
like getting that,
getting the,
the,
the,
the emotion in there.
So one good trick I,

224
00:13:08.551 --> 00:13:11.050
I've,
I've known is sort of like,

225
00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:15.940
if the old new could see the new you,
what would the old you say?

226
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.700
Um,
because often you're going,
you're,
you know,

227
00:13:18.701 --> 00:13:20.530
you're interviewing about something that has happened to them.

228
00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:24.160
They've gone through some sort of transition and you want the,
you want that

229
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.270
moment.
You,

230
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.830
you want them to be able to articulate what that transition meant to them.
Um,

231
00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.130
and these are all tricks.
We're going to use by the way,

232
00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:36.290
on one of our audience members and coming up.
Uh,

233
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:40.660
so we're going to do a live interview coming up in another section.
So,
uh,

234
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.870
so these are all sort of take notes cause we're going to have to employ this and

235
00:13:43.871 --> 00:13:47.230
you know,
use this an action.
Um,
so,
um,

236
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:49.413
uh,

237
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:54.340
a lot of what emotion is around is around internal conflict.

238
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.620
Um,
so a lot of,
uh,

239
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.820
and this is one of the things that I love about audio,

240
00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:02.860
which audio can do uniquely well,

241
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:08.130
is that it can give voice to interior sort of interior drama.

242
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.850
Uh,
if there's,
you know,

243
00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:16.780
on television you can sort of see people looking pensively or you can sort of

244
00:14:16.781 --> 00:14:19.510
like,
you can sort of,
you can get across an eternal life,

245
00:14:19.511 --> 00:14:24.340
but stuff has to happen on,
you know,
on tape,
you know,
it has to be happening.

246
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:29.200
And with audio that you can,
if you can give people,

247
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.860
if you can get people to give voice to these,
to the internal conflict,

248
00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:36.310
it has the power of any kind of real drama.
So,

249
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:40.540
so what I often say to people is like I'll often say like so complex you're

250
00:14:40.541 --> 00:14:43.210
going for conflict,
but it can be conflict within a person.

251
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.880
It can be a person feeling conflicted about something.

252
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:48.100
And so a big question that I use a lot,

253
00:14:48.101 --> 00:14:51.980
which is sort of like just if you had to describe the debate in your head over

254
00:14:51.981 --> 00:14:54.770
this moment over this act that you took,
what was one side saying?

255
00:14:54.771 --> 00:14:57.500
What was the other side?
And saying,
you know,
um,

256
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.960
and it's just getting people to sort of like voice this,

257
00:14:59.961 --> 00:15:03.080
this the feelings that they're having and often our feelings or contradictory.

258
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.351
Right?

259
00:15:03.351 --> 00:15:06.650
And so you want that and that's great if people have a conflicted feeling when

260
00:15:06.651 --> 00:15:09.470
you're interviewing them,
that's a wonderful thing too.
That's what you want.

261
00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:13.670
Cause that's the way of breaking out of what you were talking about an which is

262
00:15:13.671 --> 00:15:17.170
the canned thing.
Part of what being canned is,

263
00:15:17.171 --> 00:15:21.260
is just sort of just having like a,
you know,
sort of like a very,

264
00:15:21.261 --> 00:15:23.900
very straightforward feeling about it that you don't necessarily believe but you

265
00:15:23.901 --> 00:15:27.950
can't shake people out of.
And so what you want is to sort of like get at like,

266
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.320
you know,
what,
what was the conflict?

267
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.290
Was there ever a point where you didn't feel so confident competent about this?

268
00:15:33.291 --> 00:15:36.050
Was there ever a point where you like,
felt different?
Like,
you know,
sort of like,

269
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.290
you know,
and sort of,
and sometimes it can be just as simple as sort of like,

270
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.010
you seem very confident right now.
Was that always the case?
You know?

271
00:15:43.011 --> 00:15:44.690
And if they say no,

272
00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:49.310
then just zero in on that like zero head on the weakness,
uh,
the emotion,

273
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.240
right?
Like that's what you're,
that's what your job is.
Right.
Um,

274
00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.370
and then another question that I would

275
00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.520
often happens in an interview on a batch of this,

276
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.450
this will happen to you as you're doing your interviews.

277
00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:06.810
Somebody will say something and it feels like very important to them.

278
00:16:08.201 --> 00:16:13.120
Like they've said something but you know,
is meaningful.
Uh,
you know,

279
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.060
like,
you know,
you're talking to like a,
you know,

280
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:20.630
a rail yard worker and there'll be like,
well,
you know,
and then the,
the,
the,
the,

281
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:25.360
the boss gave us like,
you know,
extra hours and they say it like,
and you're like,

282
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.090
wow,
the boss gave you an extra hour and you're seeing it.

283
00:16:28.091 --> 00:16:31.240
Like it's important that I have no idea what it means,

284
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.150
but it means something to you there.
Emotion in the voice,
right?

285
00:16:34.151 --> 00:16:35.830
Like what does that mean?
And so,

286
00:16:35.831 --> 00:16:39.670
and often you and I would always love this thing.

287
00:16:39.671 --> 00:16:41.770
I would know that there was something that they were getting at,

288
00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:45.250
but they weren't articulating it to me.
And,
and then,

289
00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.860
and then IRA used this question,
use this question all the time.

290
00:16:47.861 --> 00:16:49.870
And it's a really great question and it's super straight forward.

291
00:16:49.871 --> 00:16:51.430
It's just sort of like,
what do you make of that?

292
00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.670
And so I say it all the time now because like I'm often,

293
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:59.140
I just need them to tell me the reason that there's emotion in the thing that

294
00:16:59.141 --> 00:17:03.940
they just said.
Um,
so what do you make of that?
Is it,
it's a really,
uh,
really,

295
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:06.790
uh,
a really important question.
Um,

296
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:12.970
the other thing that I think one of the most important things that we,

297
00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:14.270
<v 1>yeah,</v>

298
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.610
<v 2>which is sort of like part of the whatever you make,</v>

299
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.330
what do you make of that question again?
Uh,

300
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.900
you sort of ask what he make of that and then you're

301
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:24.130
<v 1>okay.</v>

302
00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.330
<v 2>It's sort of a dumb question.
Uh,</v>

303
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:28.990
you sort of feel like an idiot for asking and it's like sort of like basic and

304
00:17:28.991 --> 00:17:32.020
weird and like it's not a question that you actually asked that often in normal

305
00:17:32.021 --> 00:17:36.160
conversation.
Uh,
and so,
and this gets to the point of sort of like,

306
00:17:36.161 --> 00:17:37.630
are you having a real conversation?

307
00:17:37.631 --> 00:17:40.690
Are you having a staged conversation sort of to elicit certain things and you're

308
00:17:40.691 --> 00:17:42.250
doing a little bit of both,
right?

309
00:17:42.251 --> 00:17:47.020
And then what did you make of that is very much like a staged sort of therapy

310
00:17:47.021 --> 00:17:50.580
kind of conversation.
You know what I mean?
Uh,
and so,

311
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.940
but really important is to then shut up.

312
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.910
I can't get across enough the importance of shutting up.

313
00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:01.950
And like early on in my career I would come back and I would just be talking so

314
00:18:01.951 --> 00:18:04.860
much and people would start to be telling me interesting things and I would be

315
00:18:04.861 --> 00:18:06.600
talking over them and,

316
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:10.140
and it was all because I was nervous and I was worried about like sort of making

317
00:18:10.141 --> 00:18:14.430
them feel uncomfortable and you sort of want them to feel uncomfortable a little

318
00:18:14.431 --> 00:18:14.700
bit,

319
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:18.270
not totally uncomfortable so that they're not going to be like talking to you.

320
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.970
You want them to feel,
you want them to feel safe,

321
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.740
but you want them to feel like they're saying something real,

322
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.590
which is often uncomfortable.
So you want it to be safe.

323
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:31.470
You're not judgmental at all,
you never want to be judgemental,

324
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:35.080
but you want to be asking real questions and you want them to be thinking real

325
00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:40.080
really about them.
So,
um,
another,
another just sort of,
you know,

326
00:18:40.081 --> 00:18:42.600
good,
good question that sort of gets at this is the,

327
00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.940
is the why is the story meaningful to you

328
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:50.310
<v 0>coming up?</v>

329
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:55.310
The power of the right question and how to craft it to get honest responses,

330
00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.050
deep responses including plenty of clips.

331
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.510

and now back to the show.

354
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.520
<v 2>So just to sort of get across like sort of like the power of like sort of what</v>

355
00:20:38.521 --> 00:20:41.880
this,
what this question is asking the right question.
Um,

356
00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:46.500
I wanna I wanna play a,
a couple clips of,
of tape here.

357
00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:51.490
Um,
and this first one is like,
um,

358
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.820
a story that we did on.
So this,

359
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:58.360
this first sort of like illustration of the power of asking the right question

360
00:20:58.361 --> 00:21:03.190
and getting people to reflect honestly.
Um,
it's a weird story.
Uh,

361
00:21:03.191 --> 00:21:06.190
it was a sort of this really conceptual story that we did at this American life

362
00:21:06.191 --> 00:21:08.680
a while ago and it was this reporter named Davy Rothbart.

363
00:21:08.681 --> 00:21:09.650
And I was the producer on this story.

364
00:21:09.651 --> 00:21:12.160
So I went out with him and asked all these questions.

365
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.780
And the conceptual story was this,

366
00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:18.781
Debbie lived on this block in Chicago that was sort of like a sort of a black

367
00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:21.250
and transition.
There was like some sort of yuppies moving in,

368
00:21:21.251 --> 00:21:25.060
but it had been sort of like a poor,
there's some gang problems there.

369
00:21:25.061 --> 00:21:27.920
And it was like a sort of a neat,
it was a neighborhood in transition.
Um,

370
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.240
and he lived on this block and there was all these problems that with the

371
00:21:31.241 --> 00:21:32.500
neighborhood was having with each other,

372
00:21:32.501 --> 00:21:35.260
like different neighbors were like having different conflicts with each other.

373
00:21:35.261 --> 00:21:37.990
And there was like a neighbor in this building who was complaining about his

374
00:21:37.991 --> 00:21:40.270
loud music and was constantly banging on the floor.

375
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.170
And then there was another neighbor that had thought that like that somebody

376
00:21:44.171 --> 00:21:46.570
else stole her dog.
And then there was like,
you know,

377
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.780
so there's all these things and,

378
00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:50.590
and the idea was that Davey was the idea of the story.

379
00:21:50.591 --> 00:21:52.750
It was a Davy was gonna sort of like collect all these prompts,

380
00:21:52.751 --> 00:21:53.920
interview all the people in his neighborhood,

381
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:59.050
and then take the problems that were happening in this neighborhood to an expert

382
00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:04.390
on neighbor relations.
Call it five 44 round trips.

383
00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:08.290
I set up the wrong piece of tape.
I mean,
sorry.

384
00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:13.390
A trap that,
oh,
there it is right there in my notes.
I missed it.

385
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.150
Um,
I'm going to set up a different use.
Dave,
there's another piece here.

386
00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.410
This is what would it be very quickly,
sorry.

387
00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:22.540
Keep all that in your mind for a second.
Um,
and uh,
there's two,

388
00:22:22.541 --> 00:22:25.300
there's two stories I'm gonna play.
I'm going play the first one now in order.
Um,

389
00:22:25.301 --> 00:22:27.580
so,
uh,
so,
so this is a different story.

390
00:22:27.581 --> 00:22:31.120
This was one that I did on the housing crisis.
This is a story from 2008.

391
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:35.320
And it was one of the more famous famous stories I did was called the giant pool

392
00:22:35.321 --> 00:22:39.760
of money.
And it was about the housing meltdown basically.
Um,
and,

393
00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:41.680
uh,
back in 2008,

394
00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:45.190
there was all this stuff happening with subprime mortgages and a lot of the

395
00:22:45.191 --> 00:22:50.170
coverage was about our,
um,
who,
you know,

396
00:22:50.171 --> 00:22:51.850
like who's at fault,

397
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.510
is it like we're dead beats taking out loans that they knew they couldn't pay

398
00:22:55.511 --> 00:23:00.040
back and then like ripping off the banks or were like poor people being

399
00:23:00.041 --> 00:23:03.100
victimized by evil banks that were now foreclosing on their homes.

400
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.640
And that was the sort of the narrative and neither narrative really ever made

401
00:23:06.641 --> 00:23:08.080
sense to me.
And I kept on thinking like,

402
00:23:08.081 --> 00:23:10.270
there's like there's something else going on here,

403
00:23:10.271 --> 00:23:15.250
something bigger and more systemic that's going on then just like either people

404
00:23:15.251 --> 00:23:17.680
ripping off banks or banks where if you have people,
um,

405
00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:22.660
and I wanted to get at the heart of it and there was like this question.
So,

406
00:23:22.661 --> 00:23:24.170
so we found this guy who was,

407
00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.820
who was going through foreclosure and he was telling the story of how,

408
00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.870
of how he got this loan,
this enormous loan.

409
00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:34.990
And in the middle of this clip,
you'll hear the question that I'm talking about,

410
00:23:34.991 --> 00:23:38.890
the question that I felt like turned the whole thing and sort of set up the

411
00:23:38.891 --> 00:23:40.030
entire show as a matter of fact,

412
00:23:40.031 --> 00:23:42.680
but sort of got him talking in a very different way.
Um,

413
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.130
so this guy's name is Clarence.
He'd taken out a huge loan,

414
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.910
almost over half a million dollars at the time of that loan,

415
00:23:49.911 --> 00:23:54.320
had three not very reliable part time jobs.
He was making about $45,000 a year.

416
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:57.260
Um,
and on the loan that he took out,

417
00:23:57.261 --> 00:23:59.690
they didn't ask him anything about his income.

418
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.200
<v 6>Call it five 40 for round figures.</v>

419
00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:07.670
Do you basically borrowed $540,000 from the bank and they didn't check your

420
00:24:07.671 --> 00:24:11.750
income.
All right.
They'd say no income verification loan.

421
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:16.250
They don't call me up and say,
you know how much money they don't do that.
I mean,

422
00:24:16.251 --> 00:24:20.880
it's,
it's almost like you pass a guy in the street and you say,

423
00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:26.000
Hey,
let me $540,000.
He said,
well,
what do you do?
Heck,
I job.

424
00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:30.560
Okay.
Hit named it.
It,
it's,
it's seems as if it's that casual,

425
00:24:30.561 --> 00:24:34.790
even though there were a lot of papers that get filled out and stuff flies all

426
00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:38.840
over with the faxes and the emails and all like that.
Essentially

427
00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.480
that's the process.

428
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.570
<v 7>Would you have loaned you the money?</v>

429
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:52.330
<v 6>I wouldn't have loaned me the money and um,</v>

430
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:57.070
nobody that I know would have loaned me the money.
I mean,

431
00:24:57.071 --> 00:24:59.950
I know guys who are criminals that wouldn't lend me that money and they break

432
00:24:59.951 --> 00:25:03.400
your kneecap.
So yeah,
I mean

433
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:09.640
I'm serious.
I mean $540,000 a person with bad credit.

434
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:14.810
<v 2>So I love that piece of tape because like it was the first time that the,</v>

435
00:25:14.811 --> 00:25:17.540
in my experience that anybody,
first of all,

436
00:25:17.541 --> 00:25:19.460
clearance is at the center of the problem.

437
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:24.760
And I'm asking him how he feels about,
like that question got me,

438
00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.610
enabled me to sidestep the whole,
whose fault is it in a way.

439
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:32.480
And it just got to a very honest reaction from him,
which was sort of like,

440
00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.720
like the Wah.
There's all sorts of other ways to phrase that question.

441
00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:39.260
Did you deserve that money?
Should the bank of giving you that money,
blah,
blah,

442
00:25:39.261 --> 00:25:43.160
blah,
and all that would have led to a defensive answer.
It would have led to,

443
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:46.490
not the right answer,
but all this.
But then when I was like in the middle of it,

444
00:25:46.491 --> 00:25:49.520
I remember thinking like,
oh,
that's the question.
And when I asked them,

445
00:25:49.521 --> 00:25:53.540
wouldn't you have a loan you the money,
it forced him to be honest.

446
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:57.380
There was no way to sort of not be honest about answering that question.
Um,

447
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:58.341
and uh,

448
00:25:58.341 --> 00:26:02.840
and it got like a really wonderful sort of honest response that then set up the

449
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.040
entire hour basically.
So like,

450
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:07.880
why were other people are lending money to people that those people themselves

451
00:26:07.881 --> 00:26:09.820
would not have went to them.
Right?
So like what,

452
00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.310
what was going on in there and that it's sort of like that,
that,

453
00:26:12.311 --> 00:26:14.870
that question set up the entire thing.
All right,

454
00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.080
so I teased this next piece of tape mistakenly.

455
00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:22.880
So going back with cast your minds back to a,
when I set this up before,
uh,

456
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.230
so anyway,
Davy Rothbart taking,
getting all these questions from his,
uh,
from his,

457
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.610
um,
uh,
all these questions from his,

458
00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:33.710
the people in his neighborhood and he's all the problems that he's running it by

459
00:26:33.711 --> 00:26:35.330
an expert in neighbor relations.

460
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:47.220
<v 8>Here's the bridge.</v>

461
00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:55.410
<v 2>Mr. Rogers.
Yes,
Mr. Rogers,
who's since passed away,
uh,</v>

462
00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:59.070
Fred Rogers.
So I guess that it was a weird conceptual story.

463
00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.420
We're taking these problems from this leg sort of like rough block of West

464
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:07.740
Augusta in Chicago and then bringing them in front of Mr. Rogers and asking him

465
00:27:07.741 --> 00:27:11.010
to sort of pronounce judgment,
uh,
what these neighbors should do cause weird.

466
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:15.720
There's a backstory that I won't even get into.
Um,
but uh,
but it was,

467
00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.170
I bring it up all to sort of talk about,
because there was,

468
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:21.960
this was one of these moments where like the question really brought us to a

469
00:27:21.961 --> 00:27:25.620
different place.
One of the,
one of the things that they said there was this.

470
00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.710
So one of the problems that Debbie had identified and we play one more piece of

471
00:27:28.711 --> 00:27:30.420
tape and then we'll get to the,
the tape with the question.

472
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:33.870
So one of the problems that Davey had identified in his neighborhood was that

473
00:27:33.871 --> 00:27:36.900
there was this fear,
right?
That was one of the big things.

474
00:27:36.901 --> 00:27:39.490
So there was like people,
the people banging on the floor,
you know,

475
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:41.120
and the music playing too loud.
There was a kid,

476
00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:44.130
there was a guy who was neighbor thought he'd stole her dog.
And then,

477
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.540
but mainly there was like a lot of fear.

478
00:27:45.541 --> 00:27:48.510
There was like the fear of like the yuppies moving into,
into the neighborhood.

479
00:27:48.511 --> 00:27:52.650
We're afraid of the kids who were in the gangs.
Um,
and uh,

480
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.700
and so David talked about that and you got your Davey and then you'll hear a kid

481
00:27:56.701 --> 00:27:58.350
named the mouth who he's interviewing.

482
00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:04.210
<v 3>Okay.
Are you afraid of it?
Ask the only answer the same way.
The gangbangers,</v>

483
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.920
the kids in baggy jeans and basketball jerseys.

484
00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:10.670
Cruised the neighborhood with their stereos,
bumping the gang bangers.

485
00:28:10.671 --> 00:28:13.820
They said those are the bad neighbors.
And maybe even 10,
you guess?

486
00:28:13.821 --> 00:28:17.210
It's no surprise the mouth has his own idea about who the bad neighbors are.

487
00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:22.220
The ones who fear and distrust him as a neighbor in the neighborhood that he

488
00:28:22.221 --> 00:28:24.000
didn't agree with what we did so much.
So He'd,

489
00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.710
he'd stand in his house with a video camera and record what we were doing.

490
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.810
Try to bring it to the beat meetings.
You know,

491
00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:31.880
he used to follow us around with cameras,

492
00:28:31.881 --> 00:28:35.000
literally follows around the neighborhood cameras,
you know,
and say,

493
00:28:35.001 --> 00:28:37.630
I'm going to call the cops and using,
you know,
what,

494
00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.500
for what we ain't bothering you.
You know,

495
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:42.390
that's what I think the worst neighbor is,
you know?
Yeah.

496
00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:45.350
They come in here for us saying that,
you know,

497
00:28:45.351 --> 00:28:48.020
maybe thinking that we're going to do this and do that,
but we'll talk to you.

498
00:28:48.021 --> 00:28:50.930
You know what I'm saying,
Bro.
We ain't,
you know,
he ain't animals,
Bro.

499
00:28:50.931 --> 00:28:52.050
We're normal people like you.
Cute.

500
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:54.320
<v 2>All right.
So that's the mouth.</v>

501
00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:58.250
And his friends were sitting on the street drinking Heinekens and um,

502
00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:03.770
so we bring that Mr. Rogers and so all that.
So Mr. Rogers is a wonderful,

503
00:29:03.771 --> 00:29:06.050
lovely man.
Meeting him was like a thrill.

504
00:29:06.051 --> 00:29:09.930
He's got this strange sort of power when you meet him.
It was crazy.
Uh,

505
00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:13.160
he would like,
he,
when we went to meet him,
uh,

506
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:16.310
his assistant said we were trying to set up the interview and his assistant was

507
00:29:16.311 --> 00:29:19.850
like,
well,
Fred likes to be nearby a piano.
Uh,
so we had to,

508
00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:24.760
we had to meet him in his studio so that you can play the piano every once in

509
00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:26.450
awhile.
He literally,

510
00:29:26.451 --> 00:29:30.980
he had the bag of puppets and he would bring them out sometimes to make a point

511
00:29:30.981 --> 00:29:33.290
and start talking in the puppet voices while we were talking to him.

512
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:37.160
And yet somehow it was like moving and real.
I don't know.

513
00:29:37.161 --> 00:29:41.710
He was an amazing person.
Amazing.
Uh,
but he was getting,
he was us some,

514
00:29:41.711 --> 00:29:44.080
a little bit of canned answers like when we were answering,

515
00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:48.160
so what should this neighbor do?
His answer was always sorta sort of the same.

516
00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:52.120
Like,
you know,
well,
I hope I would be brave enough to go and talk to them.

517
00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

518
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.120
<v 3>I would hope that I would be brave enough to visit.</v>

519
00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:01.560
It's so easy.
She took condemn one.
We don't know.

520
00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:09.030
And if I would visit you and find out that you are a reasonable person.

521
00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:11.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

522
00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:16.780
<v 3>I could tell you about my sensitivities and see if it would make any difference</v>

523
00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:19.723
to you.

524
00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:21.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

525
00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.880
<v 9>It's funny,
a lot of the things like,
you know,</v>

526
00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:27.050
you said if you were in Davies neighbors situation,
um,

527
00:30:27.170 --> 00:30:32.170
you said that you hoped you would have enough courage to go down and visit and a

528
00:30:33.051 --> 00:30:37.310
lot of what you were finding when you were talking to people had to do with that

529
00:30:37.311 --> 00:30:41.540
same sort of notion.
And I'm wondering like what is it that we're afraid of?

530
00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:42.403
Do you think?

531
00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:47.603
<v 1>Okay.</v>

532
00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:50.630
<v 3>Perhaps we think that we won't find</v>

533
00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:57.460
another human being inside that person.

534
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.033
<v 1>Okay.</v>

535
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:06.210
<v 3>Perhaps we think that all of their,
there may be,</v>

536
00:31:06.211 --> 00:31:11.211
are people in this world who I can't ever communicate with

537
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:19.530
and so I'll just give up before I try

538
00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:25.640
and how sad it is to think that,

539
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:26.960
<v 1>okay.</v>

540
00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.690
<v 3>That we would give up</v>

541
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.370
on any other creature who's just like us.

542
00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:38.483
<v 1>Okay.</v>

543
00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:43.780
<v 2>So,
um,
what are your thoughts about that?
I taught,</v>

544
00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.890
I would love to hear what you'd like,
what,
what was going on in your mind?

545
00:31:46.891 --> 00:31:49.140
Anybody respond?
Yeah.

546
00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:53.360
<v 3>And that was Mr. Rogers,
like that was so powerful.</v>

547
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:58.160
And um,
he could hear that flutter in his voice,

548
00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:02.150
which was his emotion,
you know,

549
00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:06.140
rippling through his vocal chords.
And it was amazing.

550
00:32:06.141 --> 00:32:09.560
And it was such an interesting contrast I think of Mr. Rogers and like,

551
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:10.850
it sounded like the Buddha,

552
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:16.140
<v 2>wonderful Buddha legged person.
Yeah.
But it was like,
but that was one of the,</v>

553
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.190
that was the,
that was the most honest moment in that,
in that interview,
you know,

554
00:32:20.191 --> 00:32:21.960
and it,
and it came out of like,

555
00:32:21.961 --> 00:32:24.690
there was this question that was sort of hovering over it and he was giving

556
00:32:24.691 --> 00:32:28.620
slightly,
he sat and did I hear this?
And I wonder if you do too.

557
00:32:28.621 --> 00:32:32.130
Like in the beginning he sounded more canned and then after I ask the question,

558
00:32:32.131 --> 00:32:33.030
right,
you can hear it.

559
00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:36.180
All of a sudden he's actually pausing and he's actually thinking and he's

560
00:32:36.181 --> 00:32:39.110
actually trying to figure out what is the emotion and he's trying to voice that

561
00:32:39.111 --> 00:32:42.560
emotion and all of a sudden it becomes a real and it becomes authentic and you

562
00:32:42.561 --> 00:32:45.680
connect to that moment.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

563
00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:50.100
<v 8>I think the fact that he is Mr. Rogers carries particular weight.
Yeah.</v>

564
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:53.520
We're used to hearing him and we're used to hearing him do those cans.

565
00:32:53.521 --> 00:32:55.980
Simple solutions oriented,

566
00:32:55.981 --> 00:33:00.981
just do this and it'll all be great for me that that moment of real darkness

567
00:33:01.291 --> 00:33:05.550
when he identifies be greatest fear is I will never be able to communicate with

568
00:33:05.551 --> 00:33:09.090
you.
Right?
Yeah.
And as a listener,
I can extrapolate that out to the neighborhood.

569
00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.930
It's like I can see how that person would think bad about that person and it

570
00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:16.080
just took me somewhere so hopeless when he was usually someone who's all about

571
00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:18.300
positivity and it's going to be created.

572
00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:22.110
So that juxtaposition of what I expect to hear from him and then what I hear

573
00:33:22.111 --> 00:33:23.750
from him is incredibly powerful.
Right.

574
00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:24.561
<v 2>I think,</v>

575
00:33:24.561 --> 00:33:26.870
but I think that's a really great point because I think that's what you're

576
00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:30.770
trying to do with it.
That's what,
that's what,
uh,
uh,
uh,
an honest moment.

577
00:33:30.771 --> 00:33:33.290
We'll do it with anybody,
whether it's Mr. Rogers or not.

578
00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.860
If you hear people talking and the way we all talk,
we're all sort of like,

579
00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:37.340
you know,

580
00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:40.130
going through or putting up fronts and lying to ourselves in various ways,

581
00:33:40.131 --> 00:33:44.840
but as,
as we go through our day,
um,
and uh,
you know,

582
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:47.630
nobody's going to notice that I actually screwed up the order of my tape,

583
00:33:47.631 --> 00:33:51.930
for example.
Uh,
but uh,
but you know that,
that,
that when they break,

584
00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:54.410
when you break out of it,
even if you're not Mr. Rogers,
that it,

585
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:58.160
that's what comes through.
That's the thing that comes through.
Um,
yeah,
go ahead.

586
00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:03.800
<v 10>I was just going to say that he really took something that maybe many of us</v>

587
00:34:03.801 --> 00:34:08.210
could not relate to,
like living in a project.
And when he answered that,

588
00:34:08.211 --> 00:34:12.200
when you asked that question about fear,
it made it so personal.
Yeah.
The,

589
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:16.040
I immediately was thinking to myself,
what am I fearing?

590
00:34:16.041 --> 00:34:20.630
And he took this kind of out there thing and brought it deep.
Yeah.
And,

591
00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:24.530
and so because it was personal then it was more important to me,

592
00:34:24.531 --> 00:34:28.150
like you said earlier in the day.
Right.
And then,
and,

593
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:30.560
and I engaged with that immediately.

594
00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.150
<v 2>Right.
And he was identifying something.
I mean,
again,</v>

595
00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:36.030
that's also sort of like identifying,

596
00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:41.210
putting words to a feeling that we have that is sort of undiagnosed or an on

597
00:34:41.890 --> 00:34:45.870
sort of explained that is sort of a definition of profundity a little bit,

598
00:34:45.871 --> 00:34:49.640
you know what I mean?
When you can actually give voice to do,
but,
you know,

599
00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:52.060
put that in words,
the feeling that we share.
Um,

600
00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:56.070
and that's what he did with I like,
oh,
that is our fear.
That is the fear,
right?

601
00:34:56.071 --> 00:34:59.430
We're,
we're afraid that people,
that we are going to encounter somebody who is,

602
00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:02.160
who we can't connect with as humans.
Yeah.
Yeah.

603
00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:06.060
<v 11>I think it's also incredible because he uses his own language.</v>

604
00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:09.560
He doesn't break out of being Mr. Rogers,
you know,

605
00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:14.580
he actually manages to remain himself and still go to this really different

606
00:35:15.631 --> 00:35:17.070
place for him.
And that's how I,
that's how,

607
00:35:17.071 --> 00:35:20.370
at least I could tell it was really honest,
was that he was like,

608
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:25.230
you also get to know Mr. Rogers honestly in his language.

609
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:27.330
<v 2>Yeah,
yeah,
exactly.
And you can see why,</v>

610
00:35:27.331 --> 00:35:31.680
like Mr. Rogers of all people would find that and especially horrifying thing,

611
00:35:31.681 --> 00:35:34.050
you know,
like,
yeah.
They're like,
oh,

612
00:35:34.051 --> 00:35:36.760
the people that there are bad people in the world.
It's just like such a,

613
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:42.690
it's like,
it's more poignant for was Rogers than any of us.
Yeah.
Uh,
uh,
Morgan.

614
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.670
Yeah.
Going off of that,

615
00:35:44.671 --> 00:35:48.090
at the end he uses the word creature and instead of like another human,

616
00:35:48.091 --> 00:35:49.440
it's like we're all just

617
00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:54.280
like connected with another being.
It's not,
you know,

618
00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:57.900
it's not within our organism.
We have a few more guys,
again,

619
00:35:57.930 --> 00:35:59.310
from the chatroom Jennifer says,

620
00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:03.450
<v 0>of all people coming from someone who so genuinely and innocently sees the</v>

621
00:36:03.451 --> 00:36:07.470
beauty in people acknowledging that core fear is really powerful.

622
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.760
And Claudia says,

623
00:36:08.761 --> 00:36:11.970
you can feel how carefully he's thinking about the question and that makes it

624
00:36:11.971 --> 00:36:12.760
very often.

625
00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.910
<v 2>Absolutely.
Absolutely.
I think you can hear it for the first time.</v>

626
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:19.630
He didn't have a ready answer.
Yeah.
You know,
and that was,
that's important too.

627
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:23.770
Um,
and so,
um,
and again,

628
00:36:23.771 --> 00:36:28.240
like I don't think that moment would've happened.
You know,

629
00:36:28.241 --> 00:36:31.480
I often feel like there's like in every interview,
Brent,

630
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.770
a lot of interviews there was like this,

631
00:36:32.771 --> 00:36:35.560
there's a question that's sort of hanging over the interview that if like you

632
00:36:35.561 --> 00:36:37.270
can just figure out what that question is.

633
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:41.050
What's the one that's going to like sort of like what are we talking around and

634
00:36:41.051 --> 00:36:41.800
can you,
can you,

635
00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.280
can you figure out what that is and sort of present it to people.
It gets,

636
00:36:45.281 --> 00:36:48.370
it breaks through often.
Like you again,
the therapy language,

637
00:36:48.371 --> 00:36:49.810
you have a breakthrough a little bit,
you know,

638
00:36:49.811 --> 00:36:51.910
and that's what you're sort of going for yet.
Jeff,

639
00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:56.840
<v 0>I'm wondering if both of those clips ended up in the final cut and whether or</v>

640
00:36:56.841 --> 00:37:00.010
not you like including that transition when,

641
00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:03.200
when you get the right question and that person changing from their canned

642
00:37:03.201 --> 00:37:06.140
response to,
to the more personal honesty.

643
00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.170
<v 2>Oh yeah,
absolutely.
No,
cause you have to,
yeah,
no,</v>

644
00:37:08.171 --> 00:37:10.930
those are both pulled from the actual final version.

645
00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:13.330
So like that's what the music was there and everything like that.
That was the,

646
00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:17.400
that was,
I just downloaded the clip off of iTunes and put it in there.

647
00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:20.920
That was like the,
yeah,
but,
but is that what that your answer was that

648
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:25.170
<v 0>well I was wondering if you had gotten the second answer first,</v>

649
00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:29.100
if that would have satisfied you or if you'd like capturing that moment when you

650
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:30.960
<v 2>kind of,
someone it's interesting.</v>

651
00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:35.570
Did you need the drama of him giving a canned answer first and then to like

652
00:37:35.571 --> 00:37:37.730
break through?
There's something nice.
I mean that's,

653
00:37:37.731 --> 00:37:40.630
there is something about that where you were,
it's nice too.

654
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:43.690
I like that it was the same thing that happened the day Dave Ramsey thing where

655
00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.360
where somebody is not being totally honest and then there's a question that sort

656
00:37:47.361 --> 00:37:52.160
of confronts them.
Um,
I dunno,
that's a good question.

657
00:37:52.161 --> 00:37:56.090
I think,
I think it,
it helps.
I think because it also sort of tells a story.

658
00:37:56.091 --> 00:37:57.200
It's like,
it's like a court,

659
00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:59.930
I feel like it's like a chord resolving and music when you're just like waiting

660
00:37:59.931 --> 00:38:02.630
for the court and then you finally the power cord comes and you're like,
ah,

661
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:04.800
that's how it feels a little bit.
You know,
where,

662
00:38:04.801 --> 00:38:07.190
where like where like somebody is sort of like wrestling with that.

663
00:38:07.191 --> 00:38:08.750
They're not being honest and being honest.
And then they,

664
00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:12.230
there's a question that breaks them out of it and then they acknowledge it.
It's,

665
00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.390
there's a,
there's a nice feeling to that as well.

666
00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.730
But I think it could have worked either way.
Like I will have,

667
00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:18.910
we often will use the,

668
00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:23.180
the answer without using the question and it often is just as powerful,
you know,

669
00:38:23.181 --> 00:38:26.800
you don't need to include the whole thing,
you know?
It's just how it works.
Yeah.

670
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.410
Well the

671
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:30.540
<v 0>questions come in and I think tie in nicely to these clips that we just heard.</v>

672
00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:33.270
So I'd love to get your opinion on this.
So in that,

673
00:38:33.271 --> 00:38:35.380
in that clip you were talking about getting that location,

674
00:38:35.381 --> 00:38:36.520
that street in Chicago.

675
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.260
<v 2>So this ties into a question that Braden had.</v>

676
00:38:38.261 --> 00:38:42.090
Who says when you're reporting on a town or a location or with Mr. Rogers a

677
00:38:42.091 --> 00:38:42.924
neighborhood,

678
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:47.140
do you have a methodology for getting to know that town or that place?

679
00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:52.300
Um,
God,
that's
tricky.

680
00:38:52.301 --> 00:38:56.800
Do I have a methodology?
Uh,
no I don't.
I think,

681
00:38:56.801 --> 00:39:01.030
and I think my methodology is try to find somebody who knows it better than me

682
00:39:01.031 --> 00:39:05.020
is to sort of like go and find the ID,
the person who is,

683
00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.110
I need the person who is the exemplar of whatever it is.

684
00:39:08.111 --> 00:39:09.060
Like if there's somebody,
if it's,

685
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.710
if it's a town and there's like somebody who's in that town who sort of

686
00:39:11.711 --> 00:39:16.711
represents sort of the mainstream view of the town and then identify the

687
00:39:16.961 --> 00:39:19.840
outsider,
the goth kid or whatever,
who can sort of like,

688
00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:23.530
you'd have a more anthropological view of the town and if you get both of those

689
00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:27.250
people generally you're sort of circling around some sort of authentic picture

690
00:39:27.251 --> 00:39:28.480
of it.
But you're always like,

691
00:39:28.481 --> 00:39:32.410
that's the biggest difficulty of being a journalist is sort of like parachuting

692
00:39:32.411 --> 00:39:35.050
in some place.
Trying to pretend,

693
00:39:35.051 --> 00:39:37.780
trying to get as much as you can about the place,
but you never know.

694
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:40.840
You never know as much as you wish you knew and you never have time to figure it

695
00:39:40.841 --> 00:39:43.750
all out.
You know entirely generally what I'm reporting on a topic.

696
00:39:43.751 --> 00:39:47.830
When I find that I have that I'm getting the same answers from enough people,

697
00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:49.181
then I feel like,
okay,

698
00:39:49.181 --> 00:39:51.880
well I've done enough reporting now that I'm getting similar answers.
Yeah.

699
00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:02.820
<v 0>Coming up a sample from my episode with Arnold Schwarzenegger at the one and</v>

700
00:40:03.461 --> 00:40:04.660
only coming soon,

701
00:40:04.661 --> 00:40:08.380
but I'm going to give you a preview but first just a short word from our

702
00:40:08.381 --> 00:40:09.214
sponsors.

703
00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:14.270
The Tim Ferriss show is brought to you by on it.

704

723
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.290
<v 12>And now back to the show,</v>

724
00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.430
those days there was no money bodybuilding.

725
00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.620
And so when we didn't have enough money,

726
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:47.120
we literally had to go to work.

727
00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:52.590
It's a Franklin Niacin's Franco's talent was to be a brick layer and a very

728
00:41:53.601 --> 00:41:58.370
skilled brick layer,
uh,
and learned that in Italy and in Germany,
uh,

729
00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:03.400
B we're able to go and start thinking about the idea of putting an ad in the La

730
00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.100
Times,

731
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:09.100
creating a company and calling it Europe in brick layers and masonry experts,

732
00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:14.300
a marble experts,
building chimneys in fireplaces,

733
00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.130
the European style.

734
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:21.250
And this was also a time where everything that was European was huge in America.

735
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.650
So we benefited from that.
You know,

736
00:42:24.651 --> 00:42:28.940
Swedish massages and everything had to be kind of a foreign name or a Japanese

737
00:42:28.941 --> 00:42:33.290
this and this.
So Europe into Japan and oldest places,
you know,

738
00:42:33.291 --> 00:42:36.710
we'll use the names we'll use because it's for some reason that the other people

739
00:42:36.711 --> 00:42:38.090
just thought that was better.

740
00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:42.500
And so we use that in the ad and we put the ad in the paper.

741
00:42:42.501 --> 00:42:47.501
And literally a week later we had the big earthquake,

742
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:52.190
uh,
in,
in Los Angeles.
And I mean the chimneys fell off the,
the,

743
00:42:52.191 --> 00:42:56.540
the apartment houses and all stuff.
And they had cracked walls and orders.

744
00:42:56.690 --> 00:43:01.100
And so frank and I,
we,
uh,
some Africa,
one of the friend of ours,

745
00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:06.290
wife who was very smart and she worked in a supermarket,

746
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:11.730
um,
she did a answering the phones and calling people back and notice,

747
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:12.420
uh,

748
00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:15.950
just to make sure that I in English doesn't get all screwed up with the talking

749
00:43:15.951 --> 00:43:17.870
over the phone and artist.
And uh,
and,

750
00:43:17.871 --> 00:43:22.460
and so she gave us in the addresses and then we got to do the estimates.

751
00:43:22.461 --> 00:43:26.930
And I was kind of like set up to be the math genius and it figures out the

752
00:43:26.931 --> 00:43:31.010
square footage and that Franco would play the bad guy.

753
00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.540
And I blamed the good guy.

754
00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.840
And so we will go to someone's house and then someone would say,
well,

755
00:43:35.841 --> 00:43:40.040
look at my patio is all crack.
Can you guys put the new patio in here?

756
00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:43.040
And I would say yes,
and then they will run an with a tape measure.

757
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:45.840
But there would be a dead measure with centimeters.

758
00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.640
No one in those days could it all figured out anything that's any matters.

759
00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:54.200
And we will be measuring up and say,
this is,
you know,
uh,
for uh,

760
00:43:54.201 --> 00:43:56.630
meters and the 82 centimeters.

761
00:43:56.631 --> 00:43:59.120
And they had no idea what you're talking about and this is so much.

762
00:43:59.121 --> 00:44:03.490
And then we will be writing up formulas and the Dallas and amounts and,
and,

763
00:44:03.491 --> 00:44:07.100
and square centimeters and square meters in order stuff.

764
00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:10.940
And then I would go to the guy and I said,
well,
uh,
I said,
um,

765
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:16.340
it's $5,000 and the guy will be in a state of shock and you say,

766
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:20.090
it's $5,000 is it?
This is outrageous.
I said,

767
00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:24.110
they didn't think that this is a well,
what did you expected the basis?

768
00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:29.260
I thought maybe it's like two,
$3,000 is up at 5,000 it says,
I see them.

769
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:33.810
He said,
the talk to my guys is because he's rude.
The masonry expert.
I said,

770
00:44:33.811 --> 00:44:35.730
but I can beat him down for you a little bit.
Yeah,

771
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:39.940
let me soften the meat and then so we'll go over the Franklin and was the

772
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:41.760
arguing in German,
you know,

773
00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:46.290
this is any shine that I had to constantly so far field [inaudible] Arbonne here

774
00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:47.830
in America and this will be going on.

775
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:52.740
It was screaming back at me in Italian and some some stuff and then that will be

776
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:57.630
always in the calm down and they,
we'll go through the guys at Fiu.
Okay,

777
00:44:57.631 --> 00:44:58.464
here it is,
is it,

778
00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:03.720
I could get him as low as $3,800 as you can you go with that.

779
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:06.940
And he says,
thank you very much as,
as you know,
I,

780
00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:10.350
I really think that you a great man,

781
00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.610
but I'll go blind notice epicell gay.
I said,
give us half down right now.

782
00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:17.940
We go right away and get the cement and get the bricks and everything that we

783
00:45:17.941 --> 00:45:19.650
need for here.
And we can start working.

784
00:45:19.651 --> 00:45:22.890
I say the Monday and the guy was ecstatic.
He gave us the money.

785
00:45:22.891 --> 00:45:24.150
We immediately ran to the bank,

786
00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:28.110
cashed the check is to make sure that the money's in the bank account and then

787
00:45:28.111 --> 00:45:29.420
we went out and got the cement,

788
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:33.600
the wheelbarrow and the older the stuff that would be needed and uh,

789
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:36.900
went to brook.
And so we worked like that for two years.

790
00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:41.100
I mean very successful as a method then and we had the various different jobs

791
00:45:41.101 --> 00:45:45.690
where we employed like 16 different bodybuilders.
All the laziest bastard did.

792
00:45:45.691 --> 00:45:47.770
You can never hire but never the biggest.

793
00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:51.750
They all were interested in working out and getting a tan at the same time for

794
00:45:51.751 --> 00:45:53.490
the body building competitions.
