00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.840
Optimal,
minimal.
At this altitude,

2
00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:06.200
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.063
No question.

4
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.730
I'm a cybernetic organism interstellar.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.400
<v 1>This episode of the Tim Ferriss show is brought to you by the Tim Ferriss Book</v>

6
00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:28.040
Club.

7
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.040
I have a book club where I resurrect or purchase books that I feel didn't get

8
00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:34.460
the attention they deserved,

9
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.850
and there's a brand new book that I have put out called we learn nothing by Tim

10
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.050
Kreider and there aren't,
I think,
five others,

11
00:00:42.051 --> 00:00:44.270
including several of my favorite books of all time.

21
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.341
Hello boys and girls.

22
00:01:24.341 --> 00:01:27.580
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

23
00:01:27.581 --> 00:01:32.581
I deconstruct and analyze world class performers to find the things they have in

24
00:01:32.981 --> 00:01:37.240
common.
Most important,
the tools,
the tricks,
the favorite books,

25
00:01:37.241 --> 00:01:42.241
the routines that you can use that they use and the figures that we look at

26
00:01:42.491 --> 00:01:44.860
range from billionaire investors like Peter Teal,

27
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.780
two actors like Arnold Schwarzenegger to musicians like Breda of glitch mob or

28
00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:53.290
Mike Shinoda,
Amanda Palmer to chess prodigies like Josh Waitzkin.

29
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.710
And the point of this podcast is to help you to question assumptions,

30
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.510
to find a better way of doing things,

31
00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:05.970
whether that is agreeing or disagreeing with these guests.
And it's,

32
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:08.770
it's really an exercise and pushing your comfort level.

33
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.990
And pushing you outside of your comfort zone.

34
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.900
And the guest for today is no exception.

35
00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:17.950
He's definitely going to help you get excited one way or the other.

36
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.430
And His name is Glenn Beck and there is no secret agenda,

37
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.270
no secret political agenda to this show.
That's not what this is about.

38
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.950
And it is both.
Not a Gotcha interview conversation with Glenn,

39
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.380
but it is also not a softball interview with Glen.
So we,

40
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:38.230
we dig into a lot of his personal habits and role models like Walt Disney and

41
00:02:38.231 --> 00:02:41.940
Orson Wells for instance.
But I also ask them questions such as,
uh,

42
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.470
how he fuels interacting with Peter Teal,

43
00:02:44.471 --> 00:02:49.471
who's openly gay or how he feels interacting as he has with Penn Jillette who is

44
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.900
a very open atheist and a,

45
00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:56.560
I ask them a lot of questions that many of you submitted via Facebook and some

46
00:02:56.561 --> 00:03:00.040
of them are pretty hardcore and I think he does a very fascinating job of

47
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:00.640
answering them.

48
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.640
So that is that now there's a bit of background because I think Glenn is a

49
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:11.200
worldclass storyteller.
He's also a world class world class performer,

50
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.440
a radio personality and entrepreneur.

51
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.410
Some of you may not realize in 2014,
for instance,

52
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:21.690
Forbes named him to their annual celebrity 100 power list,

53
00:03:21.691 --> 00:03:25.840
which pegged his earnings at $90 million for that year and placed him ahead of

54
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:30.160
people like Mark Burnett,
Jimmy Fallon,
Leonardo Dicaprio,
and will Smith.

55
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.380
And he is founder and owner of the blaze.com which gets somewhere between 30 and

56
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:39.040
50 million unique visitors per month,
uh,

57
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.960
which needless to say is massive and there's no end to the,
the growth in,

58
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:48.370
uh,
insights.
So it's a fascinating story.
It's a controversial story,

59
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.520
but there's something to be learned here and I think you will enjoy the

60
00:03:52.521 --> 00:03:54.410
conversation.
So withhold judgement,

61
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.740
reserve your judgment and try to listen with an open mind.
Again,

62
00:03:57.741 --> 00:04:01.100
this is not a political show,
I'm not trying to convert you to anything,
uh,

63
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.010
but it is a learning show and there are some gems in here.

64
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.150
So without further ado,

65
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.040
please meet Glenn Beck and for the resources,
links,

66
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.230
show notes and so on for this episode,

68
00:04:15.591 --> 00:04:16.371

70
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.040
Thank you for listening.
Glenn,

71
00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:28.280
welcome to the show.
Thank you very much.
I am thrilled to have you here.

72
00:04:28.281 --> 00:04:32.210
We were sitting outside at Aquatic Park in San Francisco.

73
00:04:32.211 --> 00:04:35.810
It is a gorgeous day.
Perfect.
And I was going to say,

74
00:04:35.811 --> 00:04:38.240
has anyone ever told you you have the perfect voice for radio?

75
00:04:38.241 --> 00:04:41.960
But probably not today.
Not Today.
Uh,

76
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.060
I know we have a block of time.
I want to get into a lot of different subjects.

77
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.060
The first question I really wanted to ask is,
uh,

78
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.530
what your close friends or colleagues believe you're a world class at?

79
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.830
<v 3>Okay.
MMM.
You know,</v>

80
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.900
I know you always ask that question and the punch in the face question and I,

81
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.310
I am,
I'm,
I'm stumped by that cause I don't,

82
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.100
I don't consider myself worldclass
anything.

83
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.500
Um,
uh,
I think that,

84
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.920
uh,
I think that

85
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.460
I'm a guy who just kind of,
uh,

86
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.790
slips in under the radar a bit and does things just differently enough to where

87
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.490
it's,
uh,
it kind of short circuits the system.

88
00:05:37.491 --> 00:05:40.580
So maybe in short circuiting the system baby.

89
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.480
<v 1>Okay.
This is,
this is an interesting place to start.</v>

90
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:48.481
So what are the elements of short circuiting with system that you are gifted at?

91
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.640
Okay.

92
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.473
<v 3>MMM.</v>

93
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.680
<v 1>Or have developed a gift for,
yeah,
I think it's,
I,
it's just</v>

94
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.490
<v 3>quite honestly,
let me just start here.
Uh,
I have a friend who,</v>

95
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.900
a economic professor at Columbia and he came up to me,

96
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:09.450
first time we met,
he came up to me and it was a cocktail party and he said,
uh,

97
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.730
so tell me Mr. Beck,
where'd you get your education and economics?
I said,

98
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.190
hi,
I don't have a formal education.
I'm self educated man.
He said,

99
00:06:20.191 --> 00:06:25.160
I knew it now I thought to myself,
you sob.
Yeah.
Oh,
here we go.

100
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.130
Yeah,
here we go.
And I said,
did you?
And he said,
yes,

101
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.030
because I can't get my students to think like you.
He said,

102
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:38.840
they're all,
they're all trained to think a certain way.

103
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.460
So I think short circuiting the system is,

104
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.250
is a lot easier when you're somebody,

105
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.583
uh,

106
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.630
Steve jobs is a great example that just has not been trained to think like

107
00:06:55.451 --> 00:07:00.451
everyone else because everyone else expects the system to work this certain way.

108
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.880
And then when you walk in and you don't have that formal education,

109
00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:05.050
you walk in and you look at it and you're like,

110
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.400
this doesn't make any sense is an easier way to do this or a better way to do

111
00:07:09.401 --> 00:07:14.340
this.
And you kind of chart your own path and um,

112
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.900
and everybody stands around and telling you don't do it that way.
Yeah,

113
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.900
<v 1>and you do.
And it usually works.
Job is a,</v>

114
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:25.901
is a really interesting example because he was able to take disparate areas such

115
00:07:25.961 --> 00:07:28.410
as calligraphy,
where in that case took,

116
00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:33.220
took a number of classes that you then brought over to the development of,
uh,

117
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.710
of apple and its interface.
Let's,
uh,

118
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.170
let's talk about radio for a second.
I think that,
uh,

119
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:45.120
actually before I get to radio,
you did not graduate from college,
but you took,

120
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.310
and correct me if I'm wrong,
one client.
What was that class at Yale?

121
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.070
And I read that you were encouraged or,
or,

122
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.120
or we're introduced to yell through senator.

123
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:59.480
I just love to hear a bit of the story surrounding that.
Um,

124
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.930
<v 3>I sobered up,
uh,
in my thirties.</v>

125
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.850
I was a alcoholic and really a pretty despicable guy.
And,
um,

126
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:12.990
and,
uh,
very arrogant and just,
you know,

127
00:08:12.991 --> 00:08:17.400
just not a good guy and a head.
Um,

128
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.900
tried,
not tried,
but I had begun to follow the path of my,
uh,

129
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:27.930
my mother who was an alcoholic and drug headache and committed suicide when I

130
00:08:28.301 --> 00:08:33.100
was 13.
And,
and,
um,
and so I was kind of going down that road when I turned 30.

131
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.870
Um,
I knew my life was at a crossroads.

132
00:08:36.871 --> 00:08:39.090
It was either over or I was going to restart.

133
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.350
And at the time we thought it was over.
Um,

134
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.800
but my daughters,
um,

135
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.960
convinced me that I could start all over again.

136
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:54.310
And so I did and I realized I didn't know anything.
You know,

137
00:08:54.311 --> 00:08:59.250
I was reading was reading everything I could get my hands on and trying to

138
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.360
educate myself because I was just a self.
Uh,

139
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.600
it was living in selfimposed ignorance.
I didn't care.
And,
um,

140
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:11.040
so I started reading a lot and I was reading,
um,
Steven,
uh,
not Stephen Hawking,

141
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:14.040
but,
um,
Carl Sagan is demon haunted world.

142
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.590
And at this time I'm not really religious at all.
I was raised Catholic,

143
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:21.500
but I didn't really believe in any of it in,

144
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.020
and I'm reading demon haunted world and it was all about technology,

145
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:30.050
but he was comparing it to technology is going to become like Latin too.

146
00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:34.140
A lot of people.
And uh,
there will be priest holders,
you know,

147
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:35.310
and we're kind of there now.
It's like,

148
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:40.170
it can you fix this and you have no idea how to fix anything.
And um,

149
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.170
uh,
and so he was warning about it,
but he was talking,

150
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.250
I don't remember what it was,

151
00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:48.750
but he just made some mention of the church and I snapped the book closed and I

152
00:09:48.751 --> 00:09:53.320
threw it down and it caught me off guard.
And I thought,
what did,

153
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.840
where did that come from?
Where did that anger come from?
Here,

154
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.580
I don't believe in the church.

155
00:09:59.581 --> 00:10:03.510
And this is something that was a thousand years ago in the dark ages.
Of course,

156
00:10:03.511 --> 00:10:04.344
it was like that.

157
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.480
And I realized I didn't know anything.

158
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:10.763
And I thought,

159
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:16.820
how much of what's in me has been planted in me just through my experiences or

160
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:23.730
just through other people or my teachers or my parents,

161
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.720
not stuff that I even believe,
but just stuff that's been planted there.

162
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:33.380
And so I decided to take everything out and examine everything piece by piece.

163
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.440
I was reading a,
um,

164
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.880
a letter from Peter car about a month later for Thomas Jefferson,
uh,

165
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:45.870
from Thomas Jefferson to Peter car.
Peter was his nephew.
Peter was coming of age,

166
00:10:45.871 --> 00:10:49.920
and his mother had died when he was young and his father was dying.

167
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:52.560
And before his father died,
he went to Thomas and he said,

168
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:56.640
you're the smartest man I know.
Would you please oversee his education?

169
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.450
I was said,
yes.
So as Peter comes to age,

170
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:04.590
he writes this beautiful letter and it starts out,
it says,
uh,
you know,

171
00:11:04.591 --> 00:11:09.030
when it comes to literature,
never read a book out of its native tongue,

172
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:12.090
cause you'll lose too much.
Learn the language,
then read the book.

173
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:17.430
And he goes through all of the,
the,
um,
uh,
different,
um,
uh,

174
00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:22.260
studies,
mathematics and physics.
And the last one is religion.

175
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:28.230
And he says,
um,
when it comes to religion,
above all things,

176
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:33.030
fix reason firmly in her seat for if there be a god,

177
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:38.130
he must surely rather honest questioning over blind,
folded fear.

178
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.930
When I read that,

179
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.790
that freed my mind up to question everything.

180
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.980
And so I began to,
and,
uh,

181
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.560
I started reading,
um,
hawking and,

182
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.960
and Einstein and Emmanuel Kant.

183
00:11:55.961 --> 00:12:00.220
And I just couldn't keep up with it myself.
I was just not prepared.

184
00:12:00.221 --> 00:12:05.020
And so I,
uh,
I decided to go to school.

185
00:12:05.021 --> 00:12:08.020
I was friends with Senator Joe Lieberman at the time.

186
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:13.090
And so this was around age 30.
Yeah.
Okay.
And,
um,

187
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:18.010
uh,
I'm talking to Joe and so I just gotta go and he said,

188
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.760
well,
why don't you go to Yale?
And I said,
I'm,

189
00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.340
I don't think I'm smart enough to go to Yale.
And I said,

190
00:12:24.341 --> 00:12:27.520
I don't even remember my,
I don't even remember my high school grades.

191
00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:30.010
I think there were bad.
And it is,
it turns out they were all A's,

192
00:12:30.011 --> 00:12:34.990
but I had such a poor image of myself that I thought it was a horrible student.

193
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.610
And,
um,
so I was accepted and went in and,
and,
uh,

194
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.180
I could only afford one class.

195
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.570
The first day of class was the day my wife and I decided to get a divorce.

196
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.720
And so it was really hard.
And,
um,

197
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:52.140
but I took early Christology and I wanted to take it out of the,

198
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.390
um,
uh,
the theology department.

199
00:12:55.391 --> 00:12:58.570
I wanted to take it through the history department.
And,
uh,

200
00:12:58.571 --> 00:13:02.740
so I had a professor named Wayne Meeks and he was great.

201
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.250
And,
um,
you know,
I was underclassmen.

202
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.750
So I'm this 30 year old freak in the class and nobody knows what I'm doing
there.

203
00:13:10.751 --> 00:13:13.600
He doesn't know what I'm doing there.
And,
uh,

204
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.300
and I'm engaging him on everything.

205
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.020
And the underclassmen love it because they just want to skate.

206
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:24.040
You know what I mean?
And so on.
I'm really keeping it busy.
And uh,

207
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:29.170
at one point he said to me,
I was reading,
I mean,

208
00:13:29.171 --> 00:13:31.150
I really do have the library of a serial killer.

209
00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:36.490
I cause I go and I look for people who disagree with each other.
And uh,

210
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:41.940
and so I was reading while I was reading all the things that we're supposed to

211
00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:44.110
teach me about Christ,

212
00:13:44.111 --> 00:13:46.990
I was also reading all the people who are saying it's bunk.

213
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.170
And I was reading a guy named Dominic Crossan at the time.

214
00:13:50.171 --> 00:13:53.890
He's a Catholic theologian who doesn't believe in the divinity of Jesus,

215
00:13:53.891 --> 00:13:56.260
doesn't believe in the resurrection or anything else.

216
00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.970
And the professor had said something and I said,
well,

217
00:14:00.971 --> 00:14:05.110
how do you explain then you know,
this particular point of view?

218
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.640
And he said,
Mr. Beck,
who you're reading?
And I said,
I'm,

219
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:13.450
I'm reading Dominic Crossan.
He said,
don't read him.
He'll,
he'll,

220
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.800
he'll screw you up.
Don't,
don't read him.
I said,
okay,
who do you recommend?
I read?

221
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.690
And he recommended somebody.

222
00:14:19.691 --> 00:14:24.691
So the next week I came in and I asked him the same question and he said,

223
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:30.490
uh,
Mr. Beck,
didn't I tell you not to read dominant crossing?
And I said,

224
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.880
yes you did.
You told me to read this other guy.

225
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.980
And I've read him and I get it,

226
00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:41.530
but I want to know why Dominic Crossan is wrong.
And he said,

227
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.820
I'll see you after class turning point in my life.

228
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.410
We went and had lunch and he looked at me and he said,
why the hell are here?

229
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.630
I said,
because I know I don't know anything.

230
00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:02.090
I'm a moron and I'm,
it's self inflicted and I need to,

231
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.900
I need to know what's going on in the world and in my life and what I really

232
00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:09.230
believe.
He said,
what are you doing?
What are you reading?

233
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:14.030
And I told him and he said,
who's guiding you through all of that?
And I said,

234
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.060
I'm not,
and I'm having a hard time getting through it.
And he said,

235
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:22.340
nobody gets through that.
And he reached across the table and I said,
well,

236
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.920
I know,
but I,
I'm really struggling.

237
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.650
He reached across the table and he grabs my hand and he said,

238
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:33.230
you listen to me for a second.
What'd you,
you realize you belong here,

239
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:37.310
right?
You're,
you're okay to be here.

240
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:42.680
That endorsement.
And as stupid as that seems,

241
00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:47.980
that endorsement opened up my whole world because it was the first time somebody

242
00:15:48.021 --> 00:15:51.290
said,
you're smart enough,
you can do it.

243
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:55.310
That changed my world.
I wish it hadn't.

244
00:15:55.790 --> 00:16:00.530
And in some ways I wish it didn't mean so much to me,
but um,

245
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:06.730
I've learned from that now in my position to say that to people because there's

246
00:16:10.401 --> 00:16:15.401
something stupid in us that just makes us feel like we're not good enough.

247
00:16:17.001 --> 00:16:20.780
We're not smart enough,
everybody else's better.
If they just knew who we were,

248
00:16:20.781 --> 00:16:25.130
if they just knew how much I'm bluffing,
you know,
I'd be caught.
No,

249
00:16:25.131 --> 00:16:29.420
we're all bluffing.
We're all trying to figure it out.
That,

250
00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.450
that brings me back to something you said earlier that I'd love to explore a

251
00:16:32.451 --> 00:16:37.040
little bit,
which is your,
your daughter's convincing you to forge on,

252
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.720
uh,
was that a conversation?
If so,
what did they say to you?

253
00:16:41.721 --> 00:16:44.260
Can you tell me a bit more about them?
Um,

254
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.440
because I think everyone listening or a lot of people listening have face dark

255
00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:52.190
periods.
I know I've faced some pretty dark periods and,
uh,

256
00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.420
I'd love to just hear a bit more detail on that.
I,
um,

257
00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:02.710
I used to think I was a better father when I was drunk because,

258
00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.050
um,
I uh,

259
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:10.940
riddled with add and so I operated a high speed and I have a really hard time

260
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:15.320
sitting down on the floor and just playing with the kids and like,
no,
no,

261
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:20.330
don't you see the blocks?
We can build a bridge.
Um,

262
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:24.950
and uh,
uh,
and so I would drink and,

263
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.550
and I was a,
um,

264
00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:33.590
I didn't think I was an alcoholic because alcoholics are poor,

265
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.280
living on the street,
can't hold a job and are abusive.

266
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.440
I was none of those things.
And um,

267
00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:47.080
and I was a very high functioning alcoholic and became even more creative when I

268
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:53.880
drunk.
And so every night I would tell my kids a story about inky,

269
00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:56.190
blinky and stinky,
the three little mice that we'd go to,

270
00:17:56.191 --> 00:18:00.730
the island of cheese where I would,
where it would rain Parmesan and they,

271
00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.790
their ventures against Thomas the cat.

272
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:06.710
And they would go out on their marshmallow boat to every,
uh,
every,
uh,

273
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:11.380
a night as they would escape from their parents' house.
And,
um,

274
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.150
I would tell him these stories and we had a great time.

275
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:19.350
My alcoholism was getting worse and worse.
And,
and,
uh,

276
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.350
I was starting to have blackouts and you know,

277
00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:26.190
I know that people in movies or like,
oh,
I don't remember what I did last night.

278
00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:30.060
Bullcrap.
If you don't remember what you did last night,

279
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.330
you don't have that attitude.
It's a scary thing.
And,
uh,

280
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:40.200
one day my,
uh,
my kids came down to the breakfast table and,

281
00:18:40.201 --> 00:18:45.030
uh,
they were so cute and they said,
ah,
dad,

282
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:49.530
tell us,
tell us last night the story from Inky,
blinky and this stinky,

283
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.050
that was the best story ever.
Tell us again.

284
00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:57.860
And I realized I didn't even remember tucking them in and I lied to them and I

285
00:18:58.771 --> 00:19:01.530
said,
let's see how much you remember.

286
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.680
You tell me the story of Inky,
blinky and stinky.

287
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:08.580
And I'll tell you if you have a right.
And as they were telling me the story,

288
00:19:08.581 --> 00:19:13.230
all I could think of was,
what are you doing?
What are you doing?
You,

289
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:18.780
you're missing everything.
You're not lying to your children about this.

290
00:19:18.781 --> 00:19:20.960
What are you doing?
And,
uh,

291
00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:25.650
it had been about a two year struggle to finally get the guts to admit that I

292
00:19:25.651 --> 00:19:29.460
was an alcoholic.
But that was the weekend that I did it.

293
00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:34.550
I left the breakfast table and look for a place for Aa and went into a meeting.

294
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.930
I know we're bouncing around quite a bit chronologically,

295
00:19:39.931 --> 00:19:43.440
but how do you structure your life to

296
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:51.000
avoid the temptations or problems that you've experienced in the past?

297
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.870
Uh,
and I think this is an AA expression,
but if you don't want to slip,

298
00:19:54.871 --> 00:19:56.880
don't go where it's slippery.
For instance.
Um,

299
00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:02.730
are there ways in which you structure your life so that you by your insured

300
00:20:02.731 --> 00:20:06.090
against you and visiting that past?
Yeah,
there's a couple of things.
Um,

301
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:11.900
I was just talking to Jim Doty from the center of compassion research of all

302
00:20:12.781 --> 00:20:16.800
tourism head stem Stanford last night.
And um,

303
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:21.930
he's an atheist and
he can,

304
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:26.010
he,
he's totally cool without any framework of God and he's totally cool.

305
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:30.270
My friend pendula atheist,
totally cool.
One of the most moral men I know.

306
00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:34.500
Really good,
decent Matt.
I'd leave my children with him if there was a problem,

307
00:20:34.501 --> 00:20:38.430
I'd be like pen,
protect my children,
you know,
um,

308
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.600
but doesn't believe in God at all.
Okay.
And

309
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:48.250
honestly,
as I told Jim last night,
my church,

310
00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.330
when I go to,
it's a three hour service on the weekend,

311
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.420
could God all mighty.

312
00:20:55.421 --> 00:21:00.421
That's just agonizing three hours dances with wolves is it is,

313
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:02.111
uh,
you know,

314
00:21:02.111 --> 00:21:06.490
and I got to get up on Sunday and put a tie on and a jacket I hated.

315
00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:07.383
I hate it,

316
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:12.660
but it holds my feet where it needs to be and it teaches me and forces me to

317
00:21:13.181 --> 00:21:16.460
serve.
And so for me,
um,

318
00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:20.770
service is really,
really important.
Um,

319
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:25.570
service meaning the weekend service,
no different types of service.
Meaning in my,

320
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:30.460
in my church there's no paid clergy,
so everybody,

321
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:35.320
like I'm a teacher.
Um,
my wife and I ran the New York,

322
00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:40.060
um,
drug and alcohol addiction program for a while for the church,

323
00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.700
uh,
in New York City.
Um,

324
00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:47.710
and it's all non paid positions and so you're forced to serve and then you're

325
00:21:47.711 --> 00:21:49.420
also,
um,

326
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.260
we call it home teaching where everybody is,

327
00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:58.480
is responsible for other families in the,
in the church.

328
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:03.480
So your job is to go over and teach the family and make sure the family's okay

329
00:22:03.701 --> 00:22:07.570
and you know,
see if they need anything because the bishop,
if you will,

330
00:22:07.571 --> 00:22:10.120
doesn't have the time.
He's got a job.
He's got a full time job.

331
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.850
So at 300 families,
we ought to take care of each other.

332
00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:18.240
And so it forces us to live the principles that Jesus taught.

333
00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:23.440
You know,
it's not up to the government,
it's not up to your priest to do it.

334
00:22:23.441 --> 00:22:26.860
It's up to you to do it.
Take care of your brother,
take care of your sister.

335
00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:28.960
And you know,
that's,

336
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.580
that's probably the biggest principle of Aa that keeps people sober,
is surf,

337
00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:38.260
serve other people.
How much of the,

338
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.880
uh,
the service and the church being able to hold you firmly to the ground,

339
00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:47.050
do you think is the,
the theology or the scripture verses the,

340
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:49.960
the accountability of having that social fabric?

341
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:58.000
Uh,
I'm not,
if that makes any sense.
Yeah,
I think it does.

342
00:22:58.001 --> 00:23:02.570
I mean answer it and see if you,
if my answer makes sense to your question.
Um,

343
00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:08.630
I really don't care what other people think about me.
Um,
and I,

344
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.640
I say that somewhat hesitantly because I'm not a robot.

345
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.660
Uh,
you know,
you can only take,

346
00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:21.700
I'm actually grateful that I get hit in the head as much as I do,
um,

347
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.050
and take,
um,
the or,

348
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.430
and handed the abuse that sometimes is,

349
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:32.220
is reserved a or deserved.
But,
um,
um,

350
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:37.300
because it keeps me honest.
It keeps me constantly reflecting emi,
that guy,

351
00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:41.920
do I believe those things?
Am I am I had jerk at and this and that.

352
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:47.000
But beyond that,
I don't care if I'm rich or poor.

353
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:51.770
I don't care if I'm,
um,
uh,
uh,

354
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:55.760
famous or not.
Uh,
and I don't care what other people think.

355
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:59.780
I do care deeply about what God thinks of me.

356
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.950
Um,
and he's the only one that can judge my heart.
And,

357
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:08.480
and that comes from being as low as I was.

358
00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:12.440
Um,
and you know,
for anybody who doesn't believe in God or whatever,
you,

359
00:24:12.441 --> 00:24:14.840
they may not understand this.
But when I,

360
00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.310
I believe in the redemptive power of,

361
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:22.370
of baptism and whether it is a complete sham,

362
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.310
it doesn't matter because it works for me.
But,
um,

363
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.690
when I got into the water,
you know,
the promise is,

364
00:24:29.691 --> 00:24:33.230
is that if you ask for forgiveness and say,

365
00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:38.320
I will obey and I will do what is right and what you tell me to do,

366
00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.960
then I'll remove all the problems of the past.

367
00:24:41.961 --> 00:24:44.900
I'll remove all your mistakes and you don't have to carry them anymore.

368
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:49.490
That was really important to me because I was repeating my mom's life and there

369
00:24:49.491 --> 00:24:54.320
was no out for me.
I mean,
I just couldn't live with myself anymore.
And,

370
00:24:54.321 --> 00:24:58.700
um,
and I stood in the waters of baptism and I don't recommend anybody ever does

371
00:24:58.701 --> 00:25:02.030
this,
but I stood in the waters of baptism and I,
uh,

372
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:07.340
I have a very contentious relationship with God.
I mean,

373
00:25:07.341 --> 00:25:12.320
I challenged him and,
uh,
and I said,

374
00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:15.980
you promise your words,

375
00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:20.630
promise that you will set me free if I live the truth,

376
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:23.630
you will set me free.
And if those true,

377
00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:27.650
if that's not true and I live up to my side of the bargain,

378
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:32.840
then you cease to be God.
There is no god because to be God,

379
00:25:32.841 --> 00:25:37.010
you have to be handcuffed to that truth.
You cannot break your promise.

380
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:41.420
And I said the dumbest thing I've ever said and that was,

381
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:46.010
it's not going to be me.
That breaks the promise dude.
And uh,

382
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:51.250
I challenged him and that I guess was good for me in a way because I think of

383
00:25:53.511 --> 00:25:55.550
that quite often.
Um,

384
00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:01.010
I challenged him and he kept up his side of the bargain and now it's my turn.

385
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.610
And so I do a lot of things like when I left Fox,

386
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:09.380
I left Fox because I felt led to leave Fox.

387
00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:14.100
Um,
I mean I,
it was really an,

388
00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:18.070
I think I would've,
I know I would have been destroyed had I stayed.
Why is that?

389
00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:23.180
Fame is a really ugly,
ugly,
corrosive,

390
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:28.040
awful thing.
Um,
especially that kind of fame.

391
00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:33.440
And um,
uh,
when I was,

392
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:39.080
when I was going up there and we were,
you know,

393
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:44.190
being on the cover of Time magazine and you know,

394
00:26:44.191 --> 00:26:49.191
being as ubiquitous as I was at the time is really intoxicating,

395
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:53.030
really intoxicating.
And um,

396
00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.620
right towards the end,

397
00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:00.480
I remember the last night that before I told Fox I was leaving,

398
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:05.100
my wife and I had decided and we had worked months on it going back and forth.

399
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:10.350
And um,
that night I've always been a pariah.
I've always been,

400
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:14.880
I've always been the kid that was beat up in school and you know,
whatever.

401
00:27:14.881 --> 00:27:19.010
I was never the popular one.
And the night we decided,

402
00:27:19.011 --> 00:27:20.770
and I was going to go in and tell Roger Ailes,

403
00:27:20.771 --> 00:27:25.771
the next day I went to Spiderman and I had been Spiderman movie of the Broadway

404
00:27:27.211 --> 00:27:27.331
show,

405
00:27:27.331 --> 00:27:32.331
Broadway show and I'd been Spiderman two weeks before and they were that week

406
00:27:33.181 --> 00:27:38.160
they were going to close it,
but I gave it a review that saved the,
the,

407
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:41.250
the show.
And so they invited me pack and said,
Hey,

408
00:27:41.251 --> 00:27:45.810
we've made some changes where you come back.
So I came back that night,

409
00:27:45.811 --> 00:27:47.670
halfway through I get an email,

410
00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:51.900
a text that says Banos backstage wants to meet you and say hi.

411
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:57.420
So I go back backstage is Michael Cole is um,

412
00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:01.800
uh,
Julie Taymor and um,

413
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:06.860
and Bano and we spend about 30 minutes talking about the show and they were

414
00:28:08.041 --> 00:28:11.400
struggling with the ending.
And I'm like,
you guys have the ending.

415
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:14.160
The ending is the beginning.
That's the ending.

416
00:28:14.161 --> 00:28:17.520
You've just got it in the wrong place.
And as they were talking about the ending,

417
00:28:17.521 --> 00:28:20.970
I was,
I was walking in to the meeting and I said,

418
00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.310
they don't know what the ending is and here's the ending.

419
00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.340
So when they said they don't know what the ending is,
my wife looked at me like,

420
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.990
dear God,
don't talk.
Please don't give them advice on this please.
And so,

421
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:35.890
but I did and we had a great conversation and it was like a Kool Moe.

422
00:28:35.891 --> 00:28:40.350
It was like,
I'm cool for 30 minutes.
I go home.

423
00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:44.710
And we lived in this apartment in New York that was,
um,

424
00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:47.350
I mean it was movie cool.
It was just,

425
00:28:47.351 --> 00:28:51.370
it was the Bloomberg Building on the 50th floor,
um,

426
00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:56.190
had 180 degree view of the city.
I mean,
it was just spectacular.

427
00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.550
Floor to ceiling windows.
And I walk in,

428
00:28:59.551 --> 00:29:04.551
open up the door and all the lights are off and there's just the city and uh,

429
00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.000
just lit up and it's,
uh,

430
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.970
I'm looking right at Rockefeller Center,

431
00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:16.140
which is where I wanted to work when I was a kid.
Um,

432
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:20.790
I wanted to work in Rockefeller Center,
so it was a lifetime dream to be there.

433
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:26.330
And I just had the cool kid night and I walk into the living room and I standing

434
00:29:26.761 --> 00:29:29.640
right there by the window.
And I said to my wife,

435
00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:34.500
how can this be God's plan?
We've worked hard.

436
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:39.030
I know I didn't get me here because 10 years ago I was a nobody.

437
00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:43.070
So here we are.
I finally have access.

438
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.770
I'm finally starting to get in with creatives,

439
00:29:45.771 --> 00:29:50.771
which I'm better at than all this other crap I'm doing and we can make a

440
00:29:50.961 --> 00:29:54.170
difference in culture.
How can this possibly be God's plan?

441
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:58.970
And I was lucky enough to be married to a woman who does not care about fame or

442
00:29:58.971 --> 00:30:03.510
fortunate all.
And she just said to me,
I'm going to bed.

443
00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:10.070
And I stood there and I put my head up against the glass and I looked down on

444
00:30:10.321 --> 00:30:13.560
Lexington Avenue and I heard in my head,

445
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:17.640
if you don't leave now,
you won't leave with your soul.

446
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:22.950
And I knew that to be true.
I was beginning to want it.

447
00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:27.630
Once you want something,
get rid of it.
Get rid of it

448
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.900
<v 4>once you want.
Meaning once you're attached to something.
Yeah,
once it,</v>

449
00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:34.630
once you start needing something.
Yeah.
Once you're like,

450
00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:39.570
<v 3>I really want that,
then you'll pay too high a price for it.
If you're like,</v>

451
00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.480
this is cool.
You know,
my kids asked me all the time,
dad,

452
00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:48.400
why do you always say enjoy it while it lasts?
And I said,

453
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:51.790
because nothing's permanent.
I've been rich,
I've been poor,

454
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:54.610
and you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.

455
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.410
Let's just enjoy it for today.

456
00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:00.940
And if we have nothing tomorrow will enjoy that tomorrow,
you know?

457
00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:05.810
Um,
and I think that keeps me healthy.

458
00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:10.890
The minute you start to say it's always going to be like this or it's only gonna

459
00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:15.830
get better,
or,
uh,
I can't lose this.
You're,
you're,

460
00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.200
you're starting t I m I can't speak for everybody else.

461
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:21.510
I know I'm starting down a road of trouble.

462
00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.370
<v 4>What are the most fascinating aspects of doing research for,</v>

463
00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.290
for chatting today was,
uh,

464
00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.260
discovering things like your friendship with Pendula for instance,

465
00:31:30.261 --> 00:31:34.280
which I never would have anticipated in a million years.
And Ah,

466
00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:36.453
<v 3>well,
uh,</v>

467
00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:41.160
<v 4>because he would seem to be so antithetical to a lot of your beliefs.
Um,</v>

468
00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.180
and uh,
I admire the fact that you have that friendship.

469
00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:49.250
You've spent time with Peter Teal,
for instance,
who's openly gay.
Uh,

470
00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.210
how do you feel about his homosexuality?
I'm totally fine with it.

471
00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:58.100
How does it affect me?
It doesn't.
All right.
This is why,
let me,

472
00:31:58.101 --> 00:32:02.810
let me back up with,
um,
I think a lot of people,
there are people who,
uh,

473
00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:08.270
I think there are people who project,
you know,
what they think,
I believe.

474
00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:11.600
No,
definitely.
Yeah.
And which,
which I'd love to hear you talk more about,

475
00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:16.700
<v 3>I had an eye.
The only thing that Penn Jillette and I really have found,</v>

476
00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.750
um,
some disagreement in is God.

477
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.980
And we respect each other on that.
And at first we didn't,

478
00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:28.050
when I first met him at CNN,
um,

479
00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:31.130
I spend an hour with him and I just think pendula it's just brilliant.

480
00:32:31.131 --> 00:32:36.040
Just brilliant.
I've respected him for years and years and years.
And,
um,
uh,

481
00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:38.990
so we did an hour with him and I finished,

482
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:43.280
we're standing on the set and had a great time.
And I said,
Ben,

483
00:32:43.281 --> 00:32:47.180
next time you're in town,
let's go have dinner.
And he said,
dude,
I don't think so.

484
00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:52.980
I said,
okay.
I said,
all right.

485
00:32:52.981 --> 00:32:56.360
And he said,
look,
man,
you're religious freak.

486
00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.560
Religious freaks.
You're,
you're a cancer.
Okay,

487
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.450
you're the problem with the world.
And I just stood there and I was shocked.

488
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:09.050
And I said,
wow,
pen,
I've thought a lot of things about you,

489
00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:12.740
but I never thought you were a bigot.
And he said,
look,

490
00:33:12.741 --> 00:33:16.310
I'm not going to bring a disease into my family.
I'm just not going to do it.

491
00:33:16.311 --> 00:33:19.910
And that's what religion is.
I didn't say anything.

492
00:33:19.911 --> 00:33:22.670
I just decided I'm still going to be his friend,
you know,

493
00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:27.320
and I'd still invite him to show,
uh,
and,
and we'd still be on.

494
00:33:27.321 --> 00:33:31.850
And I just love him for who he was because I respect him on so many other
things.

495
00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:34.520
And,
um,
uh,

496
00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:40.240
years go by and Penn is really getting conflicted because now I'm suddenly this

497
00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:45.950
anti homosexual,
but none,
none of the things that I am just,

498
00:33:45.951 --> 00:33:50.930
I'm getting these labels.
Sure.
Um,
because you know,
I believe in x,

499
00:33:50.931 --> 00:33:55.640
so I must believe in y,Z and D and c,
and you know,
amp,

500
00:33:56.210 --> 00:34:00.860
I'm not a Republican.
I'm a libertarian and I'm so,

501
00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:06.460
I see this post that Penn had done backstage and he's crying and he said,

502
00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:10.310
my childhood hero,

503
00:34:10.311 --> 00:34:15.311
Tommy smothers has just reamed me for going on the Glenn Beck show.

504
00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:19.160
I told him I was going to go on next week and he said,

505
00:34:19.161 --> 00:34:22.580
how could you possibly be with a bigot like that and this bad man and I don't

506
00:34:22.581 --> 00:34:25.940
know if I can be your friend patent,
if,
if you're going to be friends with him.

507
00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:31.870
And Andy Penn was just torn up and I wrote to him and I said,

508
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.280
pen,
you don't have to be on the show man.

509
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:39.430
I understand what it's like to have heroes say things to you like that.

510
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:44.120
And I really deeply understand.
He came on,

511
00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:48.590
he tried to corner me on homosexuality out of the blue and he's like,

512
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:50.570
so what do you think about gay marriage?
And I said,

513
00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:56.000
I'm totally cool with gay marriage.
And uh,
uh,

514
00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:01.280
and that he didn't know what to do over time.
Uh,

515
00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.730
Penn came to me just last year and he said,

516
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:08.840
I have to apologize to you for something.
He said,
I don't know if you remember,

517
00:35:08.841 --> 00:35:13.610
but the first time we met was at CNN and I said,
oh,
I do remember.
And he said,

518
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:16.010
I hated myself the minute I said it.

519
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:21.680
And he said I was angry at nine 11 and I was confused and I didn't know what.

520
00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:26.300
I didn't know what to do because of nine 11.
And um,

521
00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:28.610
he said,
that's not who I am.
And I said,
I know that.

522
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:33.230
And I have known that the whole time.
And so we've become great,
great friends.

523
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.010
That's the way we should be
if we,

524
00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:42.720
the country right now is so screwed up because yeah,

525
00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:46.830
we're all talking about interests instead of principles.

526
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.190
Why are,
why are we talking about gay marriage?
Why,

527
00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:57.210
why do we even have the government involved in marriage at all?

528
00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:02.230
I contend it's because of interests.
We started issuing marriage license.

529
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:06.850
One of the reasons why we started issuing marriage license is so we could stop

530
00:36:06.851 --> 00:36:09.920
blacks from marrying whites.
Well,

531
00:36:09.921 --> 00:36:14.870
that sounds like a really bad idea.
Why are we still in that business?
Right?

532
00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:20.420
So all the people are doing is they're using this to separate us from each
other.

533
00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.500
I have no problem.
You want to get married,
get married,

534
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:28.310
don't tell my church what I have to do.

535
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:32.990
I won't tell your church or your judge or whoever what you have to do.

536
00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.970
Let's just leave each other alone.

537
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:38.330
Let's just live side by side and be decent to one another.

538
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:43.250
Let's celebrate real diversity.
We're,
we're living in this world where,

539
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:49.110
um,
we're arguing about mmm.

540
00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:54.100
Nonsense and real massive.

541
00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:56.133
MMM.

542
00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:01.700
The biggest issues possibly that man has ever faced are happening right now.

543
00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.080
And we're arguing over what,
why,

544
00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:08.873
<v 1>how,</v>

545
00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:14.060
how would you suggest people on opposite sides of the fence try to find common

546
00:37:15.001 --> 00:37:18.600
ground?
And the reason I ask that is when I've observed a lot of,

547
00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:22.380
whether it be religious debates or political debates,

548
00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:27.610
oftentimes it seems like people are unwilling to be moved.
It's a,

549
00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.380
it turns out they're afraid.

550
00:37:29.381 --> 00:37:33.850
It turns into a question of who is right not being effective in terms of solving

551
00:37:33.851 --> 00:37:38.530
problems.
How do you try to bridge that gap?
How do you find common ground,
uh,

552
00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:40.840
with people who

553
00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:46.470
<v 3>I tell you honest suddenly opposed to or feel like they're opposed to you?</v>

554
00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:52.020
I will be friends ev I the Jefferson quote I gave you guides.

555
00:37:53.861 --> 00:37:58.861
My light guides my life entirely because it has every important word in it.

556
00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:04.450
Question with boldness,
even the very existence of God.

557
00:38:04.451 --> 00:38:08.030
So at that time when he wrote that,
and for me,

558
00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.580
there's nothing bigger question than God.
Okay?

559
00:38:10.581 --> 00:38:13.970
There's nothing more damning than saying I don't know if you would even exist.

560
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:17.270
So question with boldness,
don't be meek question it.

561
00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:21.920
The ultimate authority question,
it question everything turned over every stone.

562
00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:23.483
Um,

563
00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:28.650
and then because he must surely rather honest questioning over blindfolded fear,

564
00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:32.653
we live in a,

565
00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:37.770
in a society where rarely do you hear honest questions.

566
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:40.510
I haven't heard a dishonest question from you yet.

567
00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:44.680
I haven't heard an agenda from you.
I haven't heard a gotcha question.

568
00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.590
You're not coming in.
And this is what most people do.

569
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:51.700
They come in on both left and right.
Doesn't matter who's doing the interview.

570
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:56.890
Journalists generally say,
I've made up my mind who this person is.

571
00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.910
And I'm now going to prove it.
Definitely.
That's not an honest question.

572
00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:02.860
So we're not going to get anywhere.

573
00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:08.080
So if I sit down at a table with somebody who I disagree and,
and they have,

574
00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:11.920
and they're really looking and they really will say,
okay,
now wait a minute,

575
00:39:11.921 --> 00:39:16.360
wait a minute.
Cheese.
Holy Cow.
Maybe I'm waiting.
I'm,
maybe I am wrong.

576
00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:21.520
And they're willing to say it.
I can,
I can,
I can meet with anybody.

577
00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:26.830
Those people will change the course of the world.
But that takes,

578
00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.690
that takes real confidence to say,

579
00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:37.510
um,
you know,
I think most people are,
um,
I was,

580
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:40.750
when I was at the height of my alcoholism,

581
00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:44.410
and I think most the average person is like this.

582
00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.410
They're not sure

583
00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:54.070
there's enough inside of them to be full.
And there is,

584
00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.920
there's a lot that's a lie.
Um,

585
00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:02.110
and so if they get rid of maybe their illness,

586
00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:07.930
their disability,
their complaints,
their childhood trauma,

587
00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:12.730
whatever it is,
I don't know if there's anything left besides that.

588
00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:18.070
That's who I've become.
It's who I am.
It's not,
that's not,

589
00:40:18.071 --> 00:40:20.680
those are the bumps along the way.
There's something,

590
00:40:20.681 --> 00:40:23.860
there's a gold nugget in each one of us.

591
00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:25.750
You just have to be willing to say,

592
00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:30.810
I'm going to get rid of everything and I'm going to go mine for that.

593
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:33.310
You know,
the last,
the true,

594
00:40:33.311 --> 00:40:38.080
last unexplored frontier is inner space of each of us.

595
00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:42.430
We start exploring inside and say,
I don't care what I find.

596
00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:47.140
Whatever I find will be good.
Whatever I find will be real and authentic.

597
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:49.570
That's when we really change things.

598
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:55.390
I've been very impressed with how many,
how many books you've read,
but of course,

599
00:40:55.391 --> 00:40:59.320
there are more books in the world than you could possibly read and assume as one

600
00:40:59.321 --> 00:41:04.120
person.
What are the books or book that you've gifted most to other people?

601
00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.360
Uh,
probably,
uh,

602
00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:12.760
um,

603
00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:17.230
book of virtues for anybody who gets it has a baby book of virtues by William

604
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:22.030
Bennett.
It's just all the old,
um,
all the old stories of,

605
00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:27.430
uh,
of who we are and how we grow.

606
00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.350
The things that you tell your kids,

607
00:41:29.351 --> 00:41:33.610
the stories you should tell your kids and we should relearn.
Um,

608
00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:38.060
uh,
another one that I think is really good is,
um,

609
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:39.703
uh,

610
00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:44.750
Jon Huntsman's senior Jon Huntsman's book,
um,

611
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:48.050
uh,
weeders never cheat.

612
00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.730
It's awesome.
Uh,

613
00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:57.850
here's a guy who is really responsible for the idea of the Kaytel record.

614
00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:04.130
And he did that,
you know,
he,
he was trying to make a,
you know,
he's,

615
00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:04.993
he's the,

616
00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:10.020
the pioneer of Styrofoam and he's trying to get enough money to make the mold

617
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:17.780
for the Mcdonald's clam shells for the hamburgers.
Okay.

618
00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.780
And he knows he can sell a million of those.

619
00:42:20.781 --> 00:42:25.070
He knows that's the perfect thing to keep hamburgers warm when you go and you'll

620
00:42:25.071 --> 00:42:27.140
just make these little styrofoam clamshells.

621
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:32.450
But he didn't have the money to make the mold.
Okay.
Uh,

622
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.620
and he had just,

623
00:42:33.621 --> 00:42:38.360
he invented the Styrofoam egg carton and he just knows,

624
00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:41.330
but he didn't have the money.
So he's like,
okay,

625
00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:47.360
how can I make money to be able to fund this other?
And,
uh,

626
00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:51.770
he comes up with the idea that,
you know,
there's all these songs that I like,

627
00:42:51.771 --> 00:42:53.000
but I don't like the whole album.

628
00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:58.180
I'll just make a collection and I'll sell the collection of these songs on one

629
00:42:58.791 --> 00:43:03.560
album.
Well those are the Greg,
the super hits of the 70s that,
that came from him.

630
00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:08.360
He's a petrochemical guy.
He doesn't,
he's not a music guy or record guy.

631
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:13.280
He's a petrochemical guy.
Um,
and so he really thinks out of the box,

632
00:43:13.281 --> 00:43:15.390
but more importantly,
um,

633
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:18.890
he knew who he was every step of the way.

634
00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:21.620
And in the book he talks a little bit about making a deal.

635
00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:24.800
I think it was with Shell and I don't remember any of the numbers,

636
00:43:24.801 --> 00:43:28.070
has been years since I've read the book.
But,
um,
he's,
um,

637
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:31.370
he's doing a deal with Shell and,
uh,
uh,
it's,

638
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:35.330
it's a deal for I think $250 million and he's selling off part of his

639
00:43:35.331 --> 00:43:39.590
petrochemical company.
Well,
shells,
attorneys starts screwing around.

640
00:43:39.591 --> 00:43:43.610
They have a handshake deal on it.
He and the head of Shell and,
uh,

641
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:46.800
the attorney starts screwing around with it,
takes them eight months willing.

642
00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:50.690
Those eight months,
John's company's valued three times as much.

643
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:53.900
And,
uh,
the head of shell calls him up,
says,
John,

644
00:43:53.901 --> 00:43:58.580
I need you to fly out and talk to me about this deal.
He says,
okay.
So he goes,

645
00:43:58.581 --> 00:44:02.840
he flies out.
And he said,
uh,
he said,
uh,
how can I help you?

646
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:07.160
He said,
well,
you know,
we've been screwing around and so it's our fault.

647
00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:10.040
But you know,
I was hoping that maybe we could,

648
00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:14.450
we could kind of fall in the middle here because I know we have a deal at two
50,

649
00:44:14.451 --> 00:44:18.650
but it's seven 15.
Maybe we could do 500.
John looked at him and said,

650
00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:23.690
we shook hands at two 50.
It's two 50.
Wow.
Yeah.

651
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:27.680
And when you are that man,

652
00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:30.590
that's where your success comes from.

653
00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:35.930
When you can say money doesn't mean more than my word.
You know,

654
00:44:35.931 --> 00:44:40.800
when we can get away from people who are doing business and they're taking you

655
00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.710
because they can,
you know,
uh,

656
00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:47.560
that's when we're in a business world.
I don't want to be in,

657
00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:53.660
<v 4>I've read that in the last two or three years you've been trying to be positive</v>

658
00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:56.210
to be more positive.
I don't know if that's,
that was in a,
in a,

659
00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:00.970
in a profile already.
I don't know if that's,
if that's accurate,
but if it is,
uh,

660
00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:05.500
what was wrong and what are the ways in which you've been trying to be more

661
00:45:05.501 --> 00:45:09.680
positive or maybe it's a misquote.
You can also,
no,
no.
Um,

662
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.600
<v 3>uh,
I dunno.</v>

663
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:19.560
I Dunno if more positive,
maybe less divisive.
Okay.

664
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:22.480
<v 4>No,
let's talk about that because a lot of people would accuse you of being very</v>

665
00:45:22.481 --> 00:45:24.610
divisive and so I'd like to hear how you're,

666
00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:26.820
how you're thinking or behaviors change.
That was never mind.

667
00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:31.260
<v 3>Tent.
Um,
and you know,
I never set out to be,</v>

668
00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:33.740
I never set out to be the guy.
I don't,

669
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:34.650
<v 4>I don't</v>

670
00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:38.520
<v 3>want to be the guy on Fox News.
I'm not Sean Hannity.
I'm not bill O'Reilly.</v>

671
00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:43.080
I don't like confrontation.
How weird is that?
I don't like confrontation.

672
00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:48.090
Bill O'Reilly loves it.
I hate it.
We'll do it live.

673
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:52.890
Yeah.
I mean,
I just hate it.
I like it when we all get along.
I was the,

674
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.020
I was the,
I was the,

675
00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:59.340
the kid in the alcoholic family that was trying to make everybody get along.

676
00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:04.650
How did I become the divisive one?
It's not cool.
Um,
and so,

677
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:09.350
um,
uh,
so,
uh,
here I am,

678
00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:14.320
uh,
finding myself in a position that I've never wanted to be in.
I,
I don't like,

679
00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:16.030
and uh,

680
00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:21.060
I went to Fox only because I believed the country was in trouble.

681
00:46:21.131 --> 00:46:23.350
I was saying the same things over at CNN.

682
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:28.950
I was calling for the impeachment of Bush on CNN because what are we doing with

683
00:46:29.141 --> 00:46:32.620
the Patriot Act?
What are we doing with the border?
What do we,
what are we doing?

684
00:46:32.621 --> 00:46:35.770
He's lying to you.
What are we doing with war?

685
00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:40.780
And nobody paid attention to me because I was on CNN and it was popular to say

686
00:46:40.781 --> 00:46:41.561
impeach Bush.

687
00:46:41.561 --> 00:46:46.000
I guess soon as I pointed out the same things about President Obama,

688
00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:48.870
well then it becomes divisive.
Uh,

689
00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:51.700
and I'm on a much bigger stage at Fox,

690
00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:57.400
but I only took that job and I knew I'd only be there for a couple of years

691
00:46:57.430 --> 00:47:02.380
because it's not who I am.
Not what I wanted.
I just really believed that.

692
00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:07.780
And this is why I always said it almost every episode.
Don't take my word for it.

693
00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:12.590
I don't want your trust.
I don't trust people who say,
trust me,
I've died,
don't,
I?

694
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:16.540
I'm not looking for your trust.
Do Your own homework.
And if I have it wrong,

695
00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:21.460
I'll lead with my mistake.
And um,
uh,

696
00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:26.550
and so I got out of there and now I think I'm finally in the place to where I

697
00:47:28.571 --> 00:47:33.571
finally beginning to put the team around me that is building the company and the

698
00:47:35.141 --> 00:47:39.910
direction that is really,
truly,
authentically me.

699
00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:44.460
And that is let's build a better world.
Let's,

700
00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:48.810
uh,
let's look to people who are,
um,

701
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:51.150
are focused on principles and,

702
00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:56.420
and ideas and a brighter tomorrow because we choose yesterday's gone tomorrow,

703
00:47:59.961 --> 00:48:03.650
may never get here,
but today we choose.
Today we choose.

704
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:06.530
<v 4>I want to dig into,</v>

705
00:48:06.590 --> 00:48:09.260
I definitely want to talk quite a bit about the company and especially how you

706
00:48:09.261 --> 00:48:13.820
manage your time because I am just astonished with how many arms to this

707
00:48:13.821 --> 00:48:15.920
business you have.
But before we get there,

708
00:48:15.921 --> 00:48:20.120
I'd be very curious to hear a little bit about radio because you started in

709
00:48:20.121 --> 00:48:25.121
radio 1913 and it wasn't until much,

710
00:48:25.211 --> 00:48:29.750
much later that you got into talk radio 2000,
2000.
Uh,

711
00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:33.940
in that span of time,
uh,
what was the best,

712
00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:36.970
what were the most important things you learned that made you,

713
00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:41.470
that helped you get good at radio?
Or what was the best advice that you received?

714
00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:47.980
<v 3>Okay.
Uh,
the best,
if I would just have to pick one,
the best thing I learned,</v>

715
00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:51.610
I learned by mistake.
I learned by self sabotage.
Actually.

716
00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:57.220
I,
um,
okay.
Uh,
I was,
um,

717
00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:04.370
it was in the 90s.
I'm sobering up.
Everybody thinks I'm clean cut.
You know,

718
00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:06.680
I had the image,

719
00:49:06.681 --> 00:49:11.681
if anybody listened in the 80s to a radio in Los Angeles,

720
00:49:12.131 --> 00:49:16.790
I was kind of like a Rick dees kind of clean cut,
Mr wholesome,
you know,

721
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:21.870
Golly Gee,
um,
you know,
uh,
that Kinda guy.
And um,

722
00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:24.590
and so

723
00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.250
nobody knows I'm an alcoholic.

724
00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:32.270
Nobody knows that my life is completely out of control.

725
00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:37.360
The people who work with me know that I'm a complete Hass.
But other than that,

726
00:49:37.361 --> 00:49:38.920
they don't.
MMM.

727
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:44.870
And so I sober up and I start going to school and start learning,

728
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:49.030
start really searching for truth and God.

729
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:54.230
And those are all the things I can't talk about.
And,
um,

730
00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:59.450
and I just don't want to do radio anymore cause it's empty.
It's meaningless.

731
00:49:59.451 --> 00:50:01.970
I'm talking about Brittany Spears and Madonna and it's like,

732
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:06.140
what the hell is any of this mean?
And,
uh,
uh,

733
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:09.300
and I got to the point where,
um,
you know,

734
00:50:09.301 --> 00:50:12.450
I'm introducing the music and stuff in the morning and I'm like,

735
00:50:12.451 --> 00:50:14.700
and that's that super classic from what's her face.

736
00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:18.780
And I would just go on and I mean,
I didn't even,
I didn't care about any of it.

737
00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:22.850
And,
um,
uh,
and um,

738
00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:28.430
at one point it's during the Monica Lewinsky scandal and,

739
00:50:28.431 --> 00:50:31.190
uh,
it's a topic on the morning show on there about eight people on the morning

740
00:50:31.191 --> 00:50:36.080
show.
And,
uh,
somebody calls in and,
and said,

741
00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:40.100
oh,
you know,
Glenn Beck,
you're Mr. Perfect.
Like,
like anything's ever,
you know,

742
00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.030
you've ever done anything wrong.
You just,
you know,

743
00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.090
we can't accept a flaw on anybody.

744
00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:49.900
And I stood there for a while and the room got really quiet and I said,

745
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:52.840
you know,
let me tell you something.

746
00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:58.240
You don't have any idea who I even am or the bad things that I've done.

747
00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:01.830
Yeah.
Let me tell you who I am.

748
00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:07.200
And the whole room just turned like,
oh dear.
Oh God,
what is it?

749
00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:10.010
What's about to happen?
What's about to happen?
And,
uh,

750
00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:13.830
I spent about 15 minutes just being

751
00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:16.870
unbelievably,

752
00:51:16.871 --> 00:51:21.850
brutally honest and laying out who I am.

753
00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:27.970
The worst.
Not It,
not,
not,
no apology,
nothing.
Just saying,
you think,

754
00:51:27.971 --> 00:51:31.300
you know,
I've been lying to you.
This is who I am.

755
00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:36.590
I turn off the mic and I looked at my then intern,

756
00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:40.810
lowest producer on the ladder,
who's now my executive producer too.

757
00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:45.940
And uh,
I said to him,
mark this down on your calendar.

758
00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:48.670
Today's the day Glen Beck ended his career.

759
00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:52.050
The exact opposite thing happened.

760
00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:58.340
I had grown up in a world where everything was manufactured.

761
00:51:58.861 --> 00:52:03.230
Everything was,
uh,
uh,
written,
timed,

762
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:05.180
produced perfectly.

763
00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:09.230
What I realized that day was,

764
00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:13.790
people are starving for something authentic.
They'll accept you,

765
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:17.660
warts and all.
If that's who you really are,

766
00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:22.340
once you start lying to them,
they're not interested.
We're all alike.

767
00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:27.760
So the best advice I learned by mistake and that is be willing to fail or

768
00:52:30.401 --> 00:52:33.940
succeed on who you are,
who you really are.

769
00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.800
Don't ever try to be anything else.

770
00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:40.570
What you are is good enough for whatever it is you're doing.

771
00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:44.530
Peter Teal

772
00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:50.730
<v 4>has a number of very fascinating questions that he asks.
And I also,</v>

773
00:52:50.731 --> 00:52:52.860
uh,
you've spent time with him.
I interviewed him on the podcast.

774
00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:57.630
He gives a tough interview,
isn't he?
He,
he is,
uh,
he's a very incisive guy.

775
00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:02.400
Uh,
and he,
he asks questions including,

776
00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:03.870
you know what,
and I'm paraphrasing here,

777
00:53:03.871 --> 00:53:06.870
but what controversial thing do you believe that few people agree with you on?

778
00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:11.320
Uh,
I want to ask you is a separate question,
but let's start with that.
So what,

779
00:53:11.321 --> 00:53:14.100
what controversial thing do you believe that few people agree with you on?

780
00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:19.243
<v 3>Um,</v>

781
00:53:19.450 --> 00:53:23.830
that we have already seen our arch Duke for Nan moment.

782
00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:25.293
Uh,

783
00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:30.240
archduke Ferdinand was the beginning of world war one a and it seemed like a

784
00:53:30.241 --> 00:53:31.080
disconnected,

785
00:53:31.081 --> 00:53:34.540
stupid little assassination that nobody was going to pay attention to.

786
00:53:34.550 --> 00:53:39.240
And it ended up washing the world in blood.
And I think that was the,

787
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:43.710
um,
I think that was the man who set himself on fire.

788
00:53:43.711 --> 00:53:44.544
Indonesia.

789
00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:48.900
I think that was the thing that started the ball rolling for the chaos that's

790
00:53:48.901 --> 00:53:53.520
now in the Middle East.
Um,
and that,
uh,

791
00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:55.850
Russia,
uh,

792
00:53:56.010 --> 00:54:00.990
Putin is either going to orchestrate or he is going to be taken out by his own

793
00:54:00.991 --> 00:54:05.820
people because he is allowed really very,

794
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.020
very bad men.
Um,

795
00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:11.790
who are Uber Fascists.

796
00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:16.380
I mean that literally talk about Hitler in glowing terms,

797
00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:21.240
but Hitler didn't go far enough.
Aleksandr Dugin is one of them.
He runs the,
um,

798
00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:22.110
uh,

799
00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:27.110
the Moscow university and really frightening people and we are now set up for a

800
00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:34.340
global conflict unlike anything we have seen.
Um,

801
00:54:35.310 --> 00:54:37.560
since World War II.
And

802
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:42.690
I've been warning about the caliphate.

803
00:54:42.691 --> 00:54:46.530
People made fun of me on the Caliphate and now the caliphate is in everybody's

804
00:54:46.531 --> 00:54:49.500
language.
But when I talked about it four years ago and said,

805
00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:51.210
this is going to lead to a caliphate,

806
00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:56.560
I was hammered and made into the biggest joke in the world.
Um,

807
00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:01.380
now I am telling you not only is the caliphate real,
the caliphate,

808
00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:06.450
this particular strain of the caliphate,
they actually believe you don't have to,

809
00:55:06.451 --> 00:55:11.400
but they do.
They actually believe that they are the army to bring on Armageddon.

810
00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:16.290
And they are,
um,
calling on the,

811
00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:19.380
um,
armies.
They call it the armies of Rome.

812
00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:25.470
Meanwhile,
Dougan and Putin and his crew and,
um,

813
00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:26.311
uh,

814
00:55:26.311 --> 00:55:31.311
in Russia are have just taken the Crimea and they're doing it because they are

815
00:55:32.381 --> 00:55:35.250
becoming the third in Putin's own words.

816
00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:38.310
We are restoring the third Roman Empire,

817
00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:43.290
and he is trying to take back all of the land that the Soviets lost.

818
00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:47.100
And nobody's paying attention to this.
And we,

819
00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:53.360
we have to take our troops out of there and we have to pull back and stop

820
00:55:53.641 --> 00:55:56.070
getting in and everybody's business,
uh,

821
00:55:56.220 --> 00:56:01.220
until we will at least admit what the hell is going on and be honest with

822
00:56:03.481 --> 00:56:06.390
ourselves.
We're asking people now to kill people.

823
00:56:06.391 --> 00:56:08.970
In Our Name and I don't know why we're killing them.

824
00:56:08.971 --> 00:56:13.110
I don't know who were killing.
I don't see anything good coming out of this.

825
00:56:13.590 --> 00:56:18.210
And we're about to go into a global conflict,
um,

826
00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:23.990
that people our age have never witnessed.
What are you doing,
if anything,

827
00:56:23.991 --> 00:56:28.991
to prepare for that or mitigate against how that might impact your life?

828
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:36.190
MMM,
I dunno.

829
00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:40.270
I mean,
I don't know how you even prepare for that.
I really don't.
Right?
I mean,

830
00:56:40.271 --> 00:56:41.740
I'm,
I've,

831
00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:46.240
I've talked to great financial advisors and I mean,
you know,

832
00:56:46.241 --> 00:56:48.730
when you're printing money all around the world,
like we are in now,

833
00:56:48.731 --> 00:56:50.650
Europe is with QE.
There's,

834
00:56:50.651 --> 00:56:54.990
this isn't going to w w the,
the,

835
00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:58.950
the worst phrase uttered today is,
well,
this time it's different.
No,
it's not.

836
00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:03.300
It never is.
It never is.
That's a lie.
So,
you know,

837
00:57:03.301 --> 00:57:07.860
I'm looking into things like bitcoin and,
you know,
what is the new technology?

838
00:57:07.861 --> 00:57:12.210
That's one of the reasons why I'm here.
There,
there has to be a,

839
00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.740
um,
uh,

840
00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:20.160
a group of people that say,
okay,

841
00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:24.150
this old system doesn't work.
It just doesn't work.

842
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:28.980
The principles work,
but the power structures,

843
00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:30.570
the way they were made,
they were,
I mean,

844
00:57:30.571 --> 00:57:34.560
we're sitting here in front of building that was made by FDR.

845
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:39.690
This is the,
this is,
we're still using this power structure.
Look at the,

846
00:57:39.691 --> 00:57:42.930
look at the architecture of this building.
It's art deco.

847
00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:46.050
It is clearly from a different time.

848
00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:51.680
We're using the same structures for a world that is totally different,

849
00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:54.450
doesn't need any of this crap.

850
00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:59.930
So look for the people who are thinking differently that can connect and then

851
00:58:00.031 --> 00:58:05.031
more importantly are honest and will and will honestly connect in love and

852
00:58:06.821 --> 00:58:10.080
tolerance of one another.
When I went to Auschwitz,

853
00:58:10.081 --> 00:58:12.090
it took my family to Auschwitz,
um,

854
00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:15.330
about three years ago because I really,

855
00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:20.430
I mean at the time I was talking about the rise of neonazis in,
um,

856
00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:25.770
in Europe,
which again mocked for,
look at it now,
the Nazis are in Germany,

857
00:58:25.771 --> 00:58:30.030
they're in Spain,
there in Italy,
and they're in Greece.
That golden dawn party.

858
00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:31.313
Um,

859
00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:36.180
and I talked about the rise of antisemitism in France and in Europe and look at

860
00:58:36.181 --> 00:58:40.450
it now.
MMM.
And so about three years ago,

861
00:58:40.451 --> 00:58:41.290
maybe four years ago,

862
00:58:41.291 --> 00:58:44.770
I went over to Auschwitz and I took my family and I had them read the Corrie 10

863
00:58:44.771 --> 00:58:47.170
boom story,
uh,
the hiding place,

864
00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:51.370
which she was one of the righteous among the nations.
And she hit,
um,

865
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:53.980
families in her house.
Her family did.

866
00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:56.500
And I asked my family,

867
00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:02.160
let's decide who we are now before trouble comes and let's now build and water

868
00:59:05.261 --> 00:59:09.700
those seeds.
So God forbid those times come,
we're prepared.

869
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:13.480
And that's all it really has to.
You can't prepare financially or anything else.

870
00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:18.340
You can prepare behaviorally behavior.
You know.
And I,

871
00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:21.800
I talked to one of the righteous among the nations,
his old lady,

872
00:59:21.801 --> 00:59:23.390
she wouldn't let me take any pictures of her,

873
00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:27.530
but she let me record our conversation and she was fantastic.
And she said to me,

874
00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:29.270
I said,
Paulina,

875
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:35.030
you were 16 at the time when you decided to give a Jewish person a bowl of soup.

876
00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:38.980
That was the first thing she did.
That was a death sentence.
Um,

877
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:45.260
everybody has that righteous seed in them.
How do we water it?
And she said to me,

878
00:59:45.261 --> 00:59:48.740
and I thought this is really important.
She said,
Glen,

879
00:59:49.850 --> 00:59:53.750
remember,
the righteous didn't suddenly become righteous.

880
00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:58.820
They just refused to go over the cliff with everybody else.

881
00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:03.440
It's all we have to do.
Know what our principals,
not our interests,

882
01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:08.060
know what our principles are today.
And as the world goes over the cliff,

883
01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:11.840
I'm not going to change my principals treating human beings,

884
01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:14.060
whether they're like me or not like me,

885
01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:16.730
whether the same religion or a different religion,

886
01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:20.780
I will treat them with love and respect the,
the,
um,

887
01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:25.280
the story of the Good Samaritan.
Most people don't understand the Good Samaritan.

888
01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:28.370
If you don't hear that story of the Good Samaritan,
and when Jesus says,

889
01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:33.500
and you know,
who was,
you know,
the good guy was the Samaritan.
When you don't,

890
01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:35.630
when you don't hear an audience go,
oh,

891
01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.940
that means they don't understand the story.

892
01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:41.660
Let me just tell that line over in today's terms.

893
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:45.380
So you know who the guy was that helped the other guy on the side of the road.

894
01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:47.480
It was Jihad Johnny.

895
01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:51.800
It's the most vile person you can think of.

896
01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:56.510
The most hated person you can think of,
your biggest enemy you can think of.

897
01:00:56.511 --> 01:00:59.270
So the Samaritans were reviled in that time.

898
01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:01.490
They were the jihad Johnny of the day.

899
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:06.380
So we have to understand that even jihad,
Johnny,

900
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:12.410
we better love.
We need to be loving to Jihad.

901
01:01:12.411 --> 01:01:13.244
Johnny,

902
01:01:16.610 --> 01:01:21.470
how do you demonstrate or embrace love with people you hear to be violent?

903
01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:24.443
Um,

904
01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.420
I would say,

905
01:01:33.310 --> 01:01:36.230
and I,
I don't,
I don't know.
I mean,
I'm not,
it's a tough question.

906
01:01:36.231 --> 01:01:39.860
I'm not tough question.
So,
but I would say the same way.

907
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:44.990
I love my children and I know they're not violent,
um,
per se.
But,

908
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:49.790
um,
well yeah,
let,
let me just,
let me say my kid is violent.

909
01:01:49.791 --> 01:01:53.720
My kid goes out and he robs a bank.
I love my kid,

910
01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:58.130
but I turned them in because it's the right thing for the kid and the right

911
01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:02.060
thing for society.
But I go and I visit him in prison and I love him.

912
01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:07.230
But,
uh,
I don't excuse it.
I,
uh,

913
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.960
and I,
I love him every step of the way.
Unconditional love.

914
01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:17.090
Um,
but not love.
That makes excuses.

915
01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:19.853
Yeah.

916
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:23.870
<v 4>I would love to shift gears a little bit and I know a lot of people are very</v>

917
01:02:23.871 --> 01:02:27.070
curious about your departure from Fox and the,

918
01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:29.930
the success that you've experienced.
Uh,

919
01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:32.890
and just add my own personal interest.
Also.

920
01:02:32.891 --> 01:02:37.891
I'm at a point where I have writing the podcast started off as a lark and now

921
01:02:38.561 --> 01:02:42.130
has become quite a thing.
Yeah.
I'd say I'm bursting at the seams.

922
01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:45.550
And at one point when you walked off a Fox,

923
01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:50.460
I assume you were effectively starting from,
uh,
from,

924
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:54.190
from an organization of one as it were.
Uh,
if you were,

925
01:02:54.191 --> 01:02:56.980
and we're going to get into,
I mean,
some of the numbers,
just a,
and then we can,

926
01:02:56.981 --> 01:03:00.700
we can update these if need be,
but with a GBTV.

927
01:03:00.701 --> 01:03:04.660
So you're streaming network fury featuring your daily TV show in its first year,

928
01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.490
generated more than $40 million in revenue compared to the 2.5 that you made at

929
01:03:09.491 --> 01:03:10.750
Fox News.
Um,

930
01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:15.430
if you were doing it all over again or giving someone advice who was doing the

931
01:03:15.431 --> 01:03:19.540
same thing,
what are the first three hires that you would suggest they make?

932
01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.230
<v 3>Um,
I was 11 to seven.</v>

933
01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:32.460
<v 4>The content game sort of,
uh,
in,</v>

934
01:03:32.461 --> 01:03:34.610
in the world that you operate in the media content.

935
01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:38.650
<v 3>Let me answer that a little differently.
What's your answer in a way that,
uh,</v>

936
01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.470
I think you need to hire,

937
01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:51.340
which is at Facebook yesterday
and

938
01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:52.713
<v 4>okay.</v>

939
01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:57.190
<v 3>Everybody,
there is a fan of Mark Zuckerberg.
Mark Zuckerberg.
Okay.</v>

940
01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:01.850
You don't really find anybody's like,
Yay.
You know,
mark is okay.
Um,

941
01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:04.473
uh,

942
01:04:04.810 --> 01:04:09.810
it's important that the team you have around you are not yes people,

943
01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:15.850
but they are one with you.

944
01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:20.360
If you're the visionary,
they have to be one with you.

945
01:04:20.361 --> 01:04:24.150
They should throw you up against Waldo Glenn night owl.
I don't,
I don't,

946
01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.690
I don't think so.
I don't know how that works.
I don't understand it.

947
01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:29.750
Show me the vision.
You know what I mean?
Help me explain,

948
01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.280
explain this to me again.

949
01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:36.730
But they have to be in the pocket of exactly what you're trying to do.

950
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:40.040
And,
uh,

951
01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:46.010
and that was that I got a little too broad with,

952
01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:50.420
um,
uh,
with some of the hires,
you know,
we had to hire and,

953
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:55.610
and um,
and take on.
She's,

954
01:04:55.611 --> 01:04:59.390
I think we went from 30,
30 or 60 people to 300 overnight.

955
01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:03.800
It was really hard.
You just can't hire that fast and hire right.

956
01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:09.260
And we hired a lot of people that were not in the pocket.

957
01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:13.640
Uh,
and so they didn't see the vision and it's,
it's,
um,

958
01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:18.380
as I explained to my staff here recently,
I just went to a store,
a,
um,

959
01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:23.700
I went to the new Ralph Lauren store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and you could

960
01:05:24.191 --> 01:05:27.460
take all the labels off of it and I could walk by the windows and I had no,

961
01:05:27.461 --> 01:05:28.294
it's Ralph Lauren.

962
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:33.370
I walk into the entryway and it's all wood paneled and it just looks like Ralph

963
01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:36.630
Lauren,
you go in and now all of a sudden it's,
it's,
uh,

964
01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:40.900
it's Indian motif and,
and hunting lodge,

965
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:44.860
Ralph Lauren,
he screams it upstairs.
It's all white walls,

966
01:05:44.861 --> 01:05:49.861
black polished floors and black and white photos and all of it screams Ralph

967
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:54.280
Lauren.
And I thought to myself,
how the hell does Ralph Lauren do this?

968
01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:55.840
How does he do this?

969
01:05:56.950 --> 01:06:01.950
It's because most people I think can see the difference.

970
01:06:02.321 --> 01:06:05.050
Can See Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger.

971
01:06:05.051 --> 01:06:07.480
Most people will see those two ago and it was pretty close.

972
01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:11.110
Ralph Lauren Brooks brothers,
one's got a pony,

973
01:06:11.111 --> 01:06:15.280
one's got a lamb or sheep or whatever it is on it.
Okay,
so I got it.

974
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:18.970
But the same thing,
they're both button down shirts,
not to Ralph Lauren or not.

975
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:20.860
They're wildly different.

976
01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:24.910
And if you don't hire the people that know the difference between Brooks

977
01:06:24.911 --> 01:06:26.040
brothers and Ralph Lauren,

978
01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:28.270
if you don't know the difference between Tommy Hilfiger,

979
01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:32.500
an American east coast kind of guy and Ralph Lauren,

980
01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:33.730
it's not close enough.

981
01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:39.360
And so he developed the team that could see the vision and then execute the

982
01:06:41.621 --> 01:06:46.390
vision and didn't have to come back to him every time.
That's really hard to do.

983
01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:50.020
Really hard to do.
You've got to have a,
uh,

984
01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:53.660
had a product first and they,
oh,

985
01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:55.750
they over see the,

986
01:06:56.380 --> 01:07:00.070
the unity of the messaging on these different,
sure.

987
01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:03.460
That vision is consistent every step of the way.

988
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.990
The second thing is,
um,
and we did this poorly,

989
01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:10.200
really poorly,
and I'm,
I'm,

990
01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:14.920
I'm spending all this year doing,

991
01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:19.810
working with a new head of product that we haven't hired yet.
And,
uh,

992
01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:23.230
somebody else I haven't hired yet.
New Head of customer service.

993
01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:28.140
There is nothing more important than my tribe.
And,
you know,
we,

994
01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:31.420
we,
most companies,
and let me just speak from,

995
01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:34.720
let me speak for me and I'll just give you the warts of my company.

996
01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:38.280
I started looking at my company,
um,

997
01:07:39.310 --> 01:07:42.630
over the last year and,
um,

998
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:46.750
I had been really sick and,

999
01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:51.640
and thought when I left Fox I was sick and most people didn't know it.
And,
and,

1000
01:07:51.641 --> 01:07:56.230
uh,
I thought my wife and I had talked about it,
that this last Christmas would,

1001
01:07:56.410 --> 01:08:01.410
might be my goodbye and I would leave the public sphere.

1002
01:08:02.070 --> 01:08:05.470
Um,
this last 2014.
Yeah.
And,
uh,

1003
01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:10.240
and we had given it my health to recover 2014.

1004
01:08:10.450 --> 01:08:12.670
And,
uh,
if it didn't recover then it would,

1005
01:08:12.850 --> 01:08:17.420
then we would leave and I would just off into the sunset.
And,
uh,

1006
01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:22.960
and so I had some miracle doctors and some miracle cure has happened over the

1007
01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:26.770
last spring and summer and,
and um,
and in this last six months.

1008
01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:31.420
And so I got enough brain power back if you will,

1009
01:08:31.421 --> 01:08:35.110
to be able to really look at my company because I had turned my keys over to my,

1010
01:08:35.410 --> 01:08:39.660
my partners and said,
hey,
take this.
And um,

1011
01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:44.720
what we had done is we had flipped the entire company upside down and we had

1012
01:08:46.301 --> 01:08:50.380
become a company that was about profit,
make the money,
make the money,

1013
01:08:50.381 --> 01:08:53.590
make the money and then protect that profit.

1014
01:08:53.591 --> 01:08:56.080
Don't let anything happen to that profit.
You've got to keep,
keep,

1015
01:08:56.081 --> 01:08:57.040
keep that money in there.

1016
01:08:57.610 --> 01:09:01.840
And then what products can we make to make the money,
make the money,

1017
01:09:01.841 --> 01:09:04.030
make the money,
then people,

1018
01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:10.060
well that that's upside down and principals weren't Elian and the team that

1019
01:09:10.061 --> 01:09:14.260
you've hired,
the team and the tribe.
Okay.

1020
01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:19.880
The company and I think all companies to be successful need to be the exact

1021
01:09:19.881 --> 01:09:22.940
opposite.
So I went back in over the summer and I said,

1022
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.720
we're flipping this whole thing upside down.
The first thing is principles.

1023
01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:30.380
Why do you,
why do you come here?
Why is anybody getting up in the morning?

1024
01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.830
We do it because we believe in something,
right?
What are our principles?

1025
01:09:33.831 --> 01:09:37.370
What drives us?
What do we know that we can say,
oh,

1026
01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:40.550
we do this because of these principles.
Okay,

1027
01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:44.960
we're never going to violate those things.
Then the next thing is the people.

1028
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:49.520
Our principals revolve around the people,
our tribe,

1029
01:09:49.521 --> 01:09:50.810
and the people that we work with.

1030
01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:54.290
Then because we love the people and we know our principles,

1031
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:59.270
then we're going to find the product that makes life easier for the people that

1032
01:09:59.271 --> 01:10:00.410
we love and serve.

1033
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:06.070
Then we're going to protect those people and those products and those principles

1034
01:10:06.441 --> 01:10:10.930
at all costs and profit becomes a byproduct.
That's,

1035
01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:12.090
that's the way it comes.

1036
01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:12.953
<v 4>What he needs to work.</v>

1037
01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:17.060
What's an analogous as suppose to what's on the Facebook walls when you walk

1038
01:10:17.061 --> 01:10:19.520
into a lot of the buildings,
which is a quote from Zuckerberg saying,

1039
01:10:20.060 --> 01:10:24.440
we don't make services to make money.
We make money to make better services right

1040
01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:29.380
now at the same time.
Who,
who's the first person,
I'm,

1041
01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:33.080
I'm stunned by how quickly you were able to hire in your team,

1042
01:10:33.081 --> 01:10:36.560
was able to then expand,
uh,
coming out of Fox News.

1043
01:10:36.561 --> 01:10:40.820
Had you had experience hiring people before and who was the first person that

1044
01:10:40.821 --> 01:10:43.280
you hired to?
Betsy Morgan.
All right.

1045
01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:44.750
<v 3>I've last us.
And she was the,</v>

1046
01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:49.780
she was the head of Huffpo see a CEO of Huffpo and I'm quite controversial.

1047
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:56.400
Yeah.
Um,
because everybody's like,
what,
what are you doing?
Um,

1048
01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:59.990
but she was the fastest hire I've ever made.
How did you,

1049
01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:05.330
how did that higher happen?
Uh,
through friends,
mutual friends and,

1050
01:11:05.331 --> 01:11:08.440
um,
um,
uh,

1051
01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:11.440
Chris Bell who's running my company at the time,
uh,

1052
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:15.510
he had done a search and talk to her and said,
you should meet with her.

1053
01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.790
And I said,
alright.

1054
01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:21.420
And met with her and literally I'm really fast,

1055
01:11:21.421 --> 01:11:26.100
higher if it drags on,
it's not going to happen.
Um,
but,
uh,

1056
01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:30.630
I was sitting with her for about three minutes and I was done.
Um,

1057
01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:33.370
cause I could tell she had good quality principal.

1058
01:11:33.371 --> 01:11:37.200
She was honest and full of integrity.
And you know,
obviously she's smart.

1059
01:11:37.201 --> 01:11:42.180
You don't getting into the office unless you're smart.
Um,
but,
um,
uh,

1060
01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:47.290
she has been,
she's been fantastic.
Now she's the,
uh,

1061
01:11:47.291 --> 01:11:51.030
the CEO of,
of the blaze.
She's replaced.
Chris,

1062
01:11:51.210 --> 01:11:55.410
what did she say or do in those three minutes that made such an impression to

1063
01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:59.250
you?
I'm,
I'm a,
I'm a gut guy.
Uh,

1064
01:11:59.310 --> 01:12:02.760
so I can't remember anything that we even talked about.
Um,

1065
01:12:03.630 --> 01:12:04.560
uh,

1066
01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:09.810
I just looked her in the eye and I just felt she,

1067
01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:14.580
uh,
was a person of real principal and I asked her,

1068
01:12:14.581 --> 01:12:18.930
do you know who our tribe is?
She said,
yeah.
I said,
tell me about it.

1069
01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:24.210
What'd she say?
Uh,
I don't,
I don't,
I don't recall.
Um,
uh,

1070
01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:28.950
I think it was probably somewhere along the lines of,
uh,

1071
01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:33.900
you have a wildly underestimated,

1072
01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:37.560
underserved and misunderstood group of people.

1073
01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:40.440
And that's where that's true.

1074
01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:45.620
We have this massive audience that nobody's serving anymore at 27 million plus

1075
01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:51.000
uniques a month to the website,
something website.
I think the total,

1076
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:56.030
the last total I saw was like 50 million footprint of 50 million a month,

1077
01:12:56.071 --> 01:13:00.960
which is insane.
It's hard for me to go back in time and,

1078
01:13:01.230 --> 01:13:03.990
and um,
and,

1079
01:13:03.991 --> 01:13:08.880
and Redo what I've done.
But if I could start all over again today,

1080
01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:13.560
the,
the first thing I just hired a guy named Jonathan Schreiber.

1081
01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:18.930
And,
um,
I look at him as an architect.
You know,
he,
he,

1082
01:13:19.050 --> 01:13:21.980
he,
he can build the structure.
I'm,
I'm a,

1083
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:25.890
I'm not a business guy.
You know,

1084
01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:30.330
I'm more of a creative and the content and I can see the,

1085
01:13:30.450 --> 01:13:33.060
I can see the vision of where I want the company go,

1086
01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:38.130
but I have no idea how to build it per se.
So I need an architect.

1087
01:13:38.131 --> 01:13:42.150
I need somebody who can really see my vision,
really get it,

1088
01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:45.810
and then say,
here's how the structure works.

1089
01:13:46.230 --> 01:13:48.900
Because for instance,
I know I want a,

1090
01:13:49.290 --> 01:13:54.090
I want an extraordinarily flat operation.
Um,
and,

1091
01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:58.350
uh,
you know,
that's one of the things that we,
you know,

1092
01:13:58.351 --> 01:13:59.730
we built in properly,

1093
01:13:59.731 --> 01:14:03.900
we were building a lot of stuff up in New York and it was being built like CBS

1094
01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:08.360
and it's not a flat organization and that doesn't work and that's just not going

1095
01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:11.250
to happen.
I want a very mobile,

1096
01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:15.760
<v 6>um,
empowered group of people to work with me.</v>

1097
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:17.590
That doesn't have to go through a lot of red tape.

1098
01:14:18.130 --> 01:14:22.510
So you need a good architect and then you need somebody who's looking at the,

1099
01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:28.020
the product itself and the customer protect the customer for tech,

1100
01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:30.790
the,
um,
the

1101
01:14:31.330 --> 01:14:36.330
content or the product and protect the flatness of the organization.

1102
01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:38.670
I've,

1103
01:14:38.670 --> 01:14:43.670
I've heard that a question you sometimes ask is how is your soul and you have a

1104
01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:48.700
very,
very good eye contact,
uh,

1105
01:14:49.330 --> 01:14:52.840
what do you look for or get?
When you ask someone that question,

1106
01:14:55.010 --> 01:14:59.290
do they even know what that question means?
Have they,
have they,

1107
01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:02.320
are they just skating through life?
You know,

1108
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:06.100
do they answer that question like,
Oh yeah,
my soul's good.

1109
01:15:07.210 --> 01:15:10.270
Or have they pondered,
especially,
and I asked that,

1110
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:14.660
I asked that generally of politicians,
um,

1111
01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:19.090
new politicians because most of them don't have any idea what they're walking

1112
01:15:19.091 --> 01:15:23.650
into.
That is,
I mean,
there's no hope in Washington.
I mean,

1113
01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:26.850
on either side.
I,
I don't,
I don't know how you do it.
You're,

1114
01:15:26.851 --> 01:15:31.750
you're walking into a lion's den would be a picnic.

1115
01:15:32.050 --> 01:15:33.310
Uh,
it's just,
uh,

1116
01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:37.790
it's a cauldron of rot and um,

1117
01:15:38.650 --> 01:15:40.810
and everything,

1118
01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:46.540
and I know this because of the media had I wanted to play the game,

1119
01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:52.890
I could have made a lot more money for the rest of my life and be given anything

1120
01:15:53.531 --> 01:15:57.580
I've ever wanted.
Okay.
They'll give you anything as long as you perform,

1121
01:15:58.150 --> 01:16:01.720
give it to him.
Um,
the same thing with,

1122
01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:06.350
with politicians.
You're going in there,
play the game brother,

1123
01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:09.400
play the game.
Just make it all go.
You're going to,

1124
01:16:09.401 --> 01:16:11.560
you and your family are going to be taken care of forever.

1125
01:16:11.561 --> 01:16:15.430
Don't worry about anything.
And so your soul has gone before you know it,

1126
01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:20.050
you first think,
well,
you know what?
If,
if I just compromise a little bit,

1127
01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:23.860
I'll be able to do x,
Y,
and Z.
You're done.
You're done.

1128
01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:28.900
So how's your soul?
Right.
And if they take it lightly,
they're not,

1129
01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:33.310
they're not the guys.
Yeah.
If they are afraid of losing their soul,

1130
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:38.260
then they have a chance.
I want somebody who's like,
Jeez,
man,

1131
01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:41.860
I got to get out of there before I lose my soul because nothing's worth losing

1132
01:16:41.861 --> 01:16:46.660
my soul.
So they at least demonstrate that self awareness.
Yeah.
And the,
and the,

1133
01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:48.140
and,
and the,
uh,

1134
01:16:48.190 --> 01:16:53.190
the awareness that there's more to life then being successful or,

1135
01:16:55.970 --> 01:17:00.460
um,
uh,
or being a senator or you know,

1136
01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:05.840
I don't believe in Salo Linsky,
uh,
that you can,
uh,

1137
01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:09.500
that the ends justify the means.
I don't believe in that.
We don't torture,

1138
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:10.970
I'm sorry,

1139
01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:13.340
one of the reasons why we're having a problem in their countries because we

1140
01:17:13.341 --> 01:17:16.670
torture,
we don't torture.
And so we've diminished who we are.

1141
01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:18.410
The ends don't justify the means.

1142
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:25.910
What does your,
the first 60 minutes of your day look like?

1143
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:31.160
Ugly,
ugly.
Um,

1144
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:36.150
I get your morning routines or habits.
Uh,

1145
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:41.120
get up in the morning around five,
um,

1146
01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.360
uh,

1147
01:17:46.450 --> 01:17:51.050
reed for about 15 minutes.
Just checking the news,

1148
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:54.920
check Facebook.
What news do check?
Uh,

1149
01:17:55.010 --> 01:17:59.890
just generally the blaze and just the quick headlines.
Um,

1150
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:04.400
I'll check the blaze.
A drudge business insider,

1151
01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:08.810
a zero hedge.
I like zero hedge a lot.
Um,

1152
01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:14.690
uh,
and then,
um,
just get ready.
I start,

1153
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:19.640
I get up in the morning,
I say my prayers for probably five minutes,
then read,

1154
01:18:19.670 --> 01:18:23.540
then get ready,
then get in the car.
Um,

1155
01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:27.850
uh,
try to watch,
you know,

1156
01:18:27.851 --> 01:18:32.590
any clips that might be wanted for the radio show or for television.

1157
01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:33.780
Uh,

1158
01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:38.370
then I go in and I have my first briefing within that first hour.

1159
01:18:39.450 --> 01:18:43.860
What are your prayers?
Are the same pairs each morning?
Uh,
no.
They're just,

1160
01:18:44.190 --> 01:18:47.990
I mean generally they are,
um,
help me,

1161
01:18:49.010 --> 01:18:52.220
helped me see the things that I'm supposed to see.
Help me

1162
01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:57.480
avoid doing damage,
um,

1163
01:18:58.250 --> 01:19:00.320
helped me be wiser than I was yesterday.

1164
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:05.210
And do you do that at the kitchen table?
Do you do that in your bedroom?

1165
01:19:05.230 --> 01:19:08.030
Whereas where's outside of my bed?
On the side of your bed.

1166
01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:12.890
And when you go into the office for your first briefing,
what,
uh,

1167
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:17.060
how was that briefing organized?
What happens,

1168
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:22.370
how it happens in that meeting?
I have,
um,
the,
um,

1169
01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:26.700
main executive producer,
uh,
Tiffany Segal,
she produces television.

1170
01:19:27.210 --> 01:19:32.010
Um,
she gives me a briefing.
I get three briefings,
uh,

1171
01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.770
get one from Benjamin Weingarten.

1172
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:38.820
He is a guy who looks at,
um,

1173
01:19:39.570 --> 01:19:40.403
uh,

1174
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:44.850
things that are a little deeper than the average person.

1175
01:19:44.851 --> 01:19:49.590
Maybe he's looking into the Middle East.
He's looking into Russia for me.
Um,

1176
01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:54.390
he's looking a little more over the horizon for the deeper issues,
uh,

1177
01:19:54.391 --> 01:19:59.340
and he'll give me probably 15 stories a day.
Uh,

1178
01:19:59.430 --> 01:20:04.360
then I have another guy who is actually from silicon valley who is kind of a,

1179
01:20:04.530 --> 01:20:09.390
a mole for me that,
uh,
uh,
is,
uh,
is,

1180
01:20:09.391 --> 01:20:14.391
is fascinated by the singularity is I am in Ray Kurzweil and he looks at,

1181
01:20:16.230 --> 01:20:20.300
uh,
emerging technology on a,
on a much bigger scale.

1182
01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.350
I'm not interested in the latest APP.

1183
01:20:22.351 --> 01:20:26.880
I'm interested in the singularity and the ethics that go behind that.

1184
01:20:26.881 --> 01:20:31.470
And so what's coming?
And I get about 10 to 15 stories from him a day.

1185
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:33.030
Then Tiffany Segal,

1186
01:20:33.031 --> 01:20:38.031
she gives me the about 10 or 15 stories that are considered a useful for

1187
01:20:39.891 --> 01:20:44.390
television on things that she knows I'm watching for that.
Um,

1188
01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:47.270
how are these stories given to you?
What's the format?
Uh,

1189
01:20:47.271 --> 01:20:52.220
I get a one sheet with just a quick brief on it and then I get the full story.

1190
01:20:52.221 --> 01:20:53.210
So I get packets.

1191
01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:56.820
<v 4>Got It.
So each one basically has a,
uh,
it's almost like a research paper.</v>

1192
01:20:56.821 --> 01:20:58.560
You have your abstract on the front page?

1193
01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:01.360
<v 6>Yes,
yes.
Potentially that line.
And then the,</v>

1194
01:21:01.361 --> 01:21:04.720
and then I had the full story and then I get one more briefing,
uh,

1195
01:21:04.721 --> 01:21:06.280
from the radio division.

1196
01:21:06.580 --> 01:21:11.080
And those are all the stories that they're looking at for radio.
And so I,

1197
01:21:11.410 --> 01:21:14.960
in that,
in that second hour,
if you will,

1198
01:21:14.961 --> 01:21:16.990
as soon as I get to work in that second hour,

1199
01:21:16.991 --> 01:21:20.550
I go through all of those briefings and uh,

1200
01:21:20.590 --> 01:21:24.890
decide and pick the direction of the,

1201
01:21:24.990 --> 01:21:27.130
the day.
And then longer term,

1202
01:21:27.330 --> 01:21:30.110
<v 4>how do you choose,
how do you choose the stories for the day?</v>

1203
01:21:30.111 --> 01:21:31.790
How do you choose the right combination of stories?

1204
01:21:31.870 --> 01:21:33.880
<v 6>I have absolutely no idea.
Just my gut,</v>

1205
01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:38.530
just whatever is whatever is,
uh,

1206
01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:44.060
whatever interests me,
you know,
whatever.
I think I'm,
um,

1207
01:21:44.250 --> 01:21:49.250
the one thing that I am a decent ad is tying stories together.

1208
01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:55.190
I can see connections on stories and see things that,
mmm.

1209
01:21:56.360 --> 01:22:01.030
How they can come together,
uh,
that most people don't.
And I think that's the,

1210
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:03.980
one of the problems with news and,
uh,

1211
01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:08.570
and with today is everything's just a separate topic.
It's not really,
it's not,

1212
01:22:08.571 --> 01:22:11.720
we're all connected and the stories are all connected.

1213
01:22:11.721 --> 01:22:15.690
What's happening in the Middle East does matter here.
Um,

1214
01:22:15.770 --> 01:22:17.720
and uh,
you know,
what's,

1215
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:21.480
what's happening on Facebook matters to too

1216
01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:22.433
<v 4>people.</v>

1217
01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:27.500
What type of tools or software do you use or apps on a daily basis to help you

1218
01:22:27.841 --> 01:22:28.651
manage your time?

1219
01:22:28.651 --> 01:22:31.770
Because I think most people listening to this probably don't have an idea of the

1220
01:22:31.771 --> 01:22:35.430
breadth of,
of your business in so much as you have all the content,

1221
01:22:35.431 --> 01:22:40.170
you have clothing line,
you have a very large business.

1222
01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:44.970
<v 6>Uh,
what are the tools,
tricks that help you?</v>

1223
01:22:45.250 --> 01:22:48.920
I don't,
I just have a really unbelievable staff.

1224
01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:52.030
I mean it is really,
um,

1225
01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:55.770
I went through a period where,
um,

1226
01:22:55.940 --> 01:23:00.230
my day is so scheduled that,
um,

1227
01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:04.100
we call it the great sock incident of Oh six.
Um,

1228
01:23:04.130 --> 01:23:09.130
because I just snapped one day because I had gone from a regular life too.

1229
01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:13.300
You don't have a life,
Glenn.
Everybody has to do everything else for you.

1230
01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:15.910
You have to focus on what you do,

1231
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:20.290
everything else in life you don't owe,
you no longer get to do.
Okay.

1232
01:23:20.770 --> 01:23:25.090
And uh,
and I wanted to go buy a pair of socks.
It's all,

1233
01:23:25.091 --> 01:23:28.900
I wanted to buy a pair of socks and it was like,
when we get you a pair of socks,

1234
01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:33.130
I'm like,
no,
I want to go buy a pair of socks.
I want to go buy a pair of socks.

1235
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:36.630
And it went on for like two weeks.
Okay.
We'll schedule it in at time for socks.

1236
01:23:37.330 --> 01:23:40.750
And finally I just like,
I just flipped and I was like,

1237
01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:46.200
I'm going right now and I'm going by myself and I'm buying a fricken pair of

1238
01:23:46.201 --> 01:23:50.830
socks.
And,
uh,
uh,
that was the last time I wigged like that.

1239
01:23:50.831 --> 01:23:55.120
But you just have to kind of get used to your,
uh,

1240
01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:59.920
time is,
is no longer really your time.
You,
you have to,

1241
01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:03.790
I read a great book,
um,
years ago,
uh,

1242
01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:07.060
there was two of them and I don't remember which one this was in,

1243
01:24:07.061 --> 01:24:10.360
but the mind of the millionaire or millionaires mind and the millionaire next

1244
01:24:10.361 --> 01:24:14.830
door or something like that,
one of them was talking about how,

1245
01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:19.300
um,
unless you're a plumber,
don't fix your own plumbing.
Okay.

1246
01:24:19.301 --> 01:24:24.010
Cause you're going to spend way too much time on that.
Um,

1247
01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:29.140
and uh,
uh,
and you can hire somebody.
My Aye.

1248
01:24:29.290 --> 01:24:30.970
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.

1249
01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:36.180
Concentrate on the things that I do best and let everybody else do everything

1250
01:24:36.641 --> 01:24:41.020
else.
So I have very regimented times to where,

1251
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:42.970
uh,
you know,

1252
01:24:42.971 --> 01:24:45.940
it just had somebody shadowing me a couple of days ago and I think they freaked

1253
01:24:45.941 --> 01:24:46.750
out.
They were just,

1254
01:24:46.750 --> 01:24:49.480
I think they were about to go into an institution afterwards cause they,

1255
01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:54.580
they had no idea what it was.
And you know,
I was in,

1256
01:24:54.810 --> 01:24:55.643
uh,

1257
01:24:56.020 --> 01:25:00.310
I come right off of radio that day and I walked right into a,

1258
01:25:00.370 --> 01:25:05.370
another stage where we're doing claymation and I'm talking to them about the

1259
01:25:05.411 --> 01:25:07.480
claymation and we're talking about the story.

1260
01:25:07.481 --> 01:25:10.720
And so I'm looking at the claymation,
I'm looking at the shots,

1261
01:25:10.721 --> 01:25:12.610
then I'm talking to them about the story.

1262
01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:17.080
I go upstairs and I'm talking to them about the orchestration and the,
and the,

1263
01:25:17.081 --> 01:25:18.170
uh,
uh,
uh,

1264
01:25:18.250 --> 01:25:23.020
all of the music for the story and kind of doing a quick download on what it

1265
01:25:23.021 --> 01:25:25.510
needs to sound like.
And they're showing me,
you know,

1266
01:25:25.511 --> 01:25:30.010
some pieces of music that have been coming back.
And then I go right from there.

1267
01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:34.780
I go to the clothing line where we're looking at sweaters and designs and what I

1268
01:25:34.781 --> 01:25:39.220
want for the designs to be,
uh,
uh,
you know,
in the patterns of the sweaters.

1269
01:25:39.221 --> 01:25:43.180
I'm talking to them about what are the companies that are making these for us,

1270
01:25:43.181 --> 01:25:46.030
what are the conditions for the workers,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

1271
01:25:46.930 --> 01:25:51.490
And then I walk out of there and I'm into another TV shoot that we're doing for

1272
01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:53.680
a special for three weeks down the road.

1273
01:25:53.950 --> 01:25:58.060
And I get my briefings as I'm walking from place to place.

1274
01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:02.590
And so it's enough to drive you insane,
uh,

1275
01:26:02.650 --> 01:26:04.310
until you get used to it,
you know?

1276
01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:08.280
Did you change anything after the sock incident of Osx or,
uh,

1277
01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:12.980
I let it go.
You let it go.
I just let it keep,
just become accustomed.
Yeah.

1278
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:17.120
Just let it go.
And,
um,
and then,
uh,

1279
01:26:18.050 --> 01:26:22.670
uh,
there are times too that we just schedule in.

1280
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:27.070
I just,
I just,
one time,
I just want my own time now.
You know,
it's,

1281
01:26:27.071 --> 01:26:31.310
you block that out in the calendar.
Yeah.
When you hear the word successful,

1282
01:26:31.311 --> 01:26:32.870
who's the first person who comes to mind?

1283
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:42.650
Um,
gosh,
the first person that came to mind was Billy Graham,
only because I,

1284
01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:46.790
I was talking about him last night.
And,
uh,
when I met with him,

1285
01:26:46.791 --> 01:26:51.300
he was the most at peace man I've ever met in my life.
He was just,
yeah,

1286
01:26:51.630 --> 01:26:56.630
totally comfortable and um,

1287
01:26:57.510 --> 01:27:02.460
and happy.
And he said to me,
um,

1288
01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:07.300
with tears in his eyes,
uh,
he said,
uh,

1289
01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:11.660
I'm not afraid of death.
And he was smiling.
I'm not afraid of death.

1290
01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:17.620
The whole dying part has me a little freaked out.
But death I'm not afraid of.

1291
01:27:18.250 --> 01:27:19.330
And he said,

1292
01:27:19.890 --> 01:27:23.400
I've done my best every step of the way I've tried.

1293
01:27:23.401 --> 01:27:27.780
I failed on many things,
but I've tried my hardest,

1294
01:27:27.781 --> 01:27:32.580
every step of the way.
That's success to me.
Can you get to the end and go,

1295
01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:35.310
man,
I screwed it up.
But I tried.

1296
01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:42.360
You have mentioned before we had,
we had dinner a few nights ago with,

1297
01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:45.660
with a group of folks here in Silicon Valley.
Uh,

1298
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:49.910
Walt Disney specifically.
Uh,
also,
uh,

1299
01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:53.630
George Orwell quite a lot.
Why the fascination with these two men?

1300
01:27:55.140 --> 01:28:00.070
Um,
uh,
George Orwell,
not so much.
Maybe Orson Welles.
Oh,
I'm sorry.
Yeah,

1301
01:28:00.071 --> 01:28:04.630
yeah,
yeah,
that's right.
We're another cup of coffee.
Yeah,
no,
sorry about that.

1302
01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:06.610
Ah,
because Orson Welles,

1303
01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:07.930
<v 3>well,
let me start with Orson Welles.</v>

1304
01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:12.190
He played a role in the early part of my life at eight years old.

1305
01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:17.140
My mother gives me a set of record albums called the golden years of radio.

1306
01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:18.950
<v 6>And,
uh,</v>

1307
01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:23.120
and it's because I grew up in Seattle and it was a day like today,

1308
01:28:23.121 --> 01:28:27.770
it was beautiful outside and I was in watching TV and I must've been seven I

1309
01:28:27.771 --> 01:28:32.030
think.
And uh,
and uh,
she said,
turn off the TV,
go outside and play.
And I said,

1310
01:28:32.031 --> 01:28:35.300
you watch TV when you were a kid and that's talk back to her.

1311
01:28:35.301 --> 01:28:38.150
And then she sent me down and,
and uh,

1312
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:40.280
taught me not to talk back to her and then said,
you know,

1313
01:28:40.281 --> 01:28:44.320
we didn't have TV when I was a kid.
And I mean,

1314
01:28:44.321 --> 01:28:48.320
I was thinking Wilma Flintstone had TV.
How old are you?
And,
uh,

1315
01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:53.380
uh,
and she got,
for my eighth birthday,
she got me a,
this

1316
01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:57.340
<v 3>record album of group of them.
And most of them were Orson wells,</v>

1317
01:28:57.341 --> 01:29:01.860
war of the worlds,
the shadow there was Jack Armstrong,
the all boy,

1318
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:06.930
<v 6>a fibber McGee closet,
all these great classic radio shows.
So eight,</v>

1319
01:29:06.931 --> 01:29:10.680
I knew exactly what I wanted to do.
I wanted to tell stories.

1320
01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:16.100
And I thought radio and the spoken word was so much more powerful than anything

1321
01:29:18.871 --> 01:29:19.740
Hollywood could do,

1322
01:29:19.741 --> 01:29:23.760
anything television could do because your imagination is so much stronger.

1323
01:29:24.570 --> 01:29:25.403
Um,

1324
01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:29.580
and then growing up and learning about Orson Welles,

1325
01:29:29.610 --> 01:29:33.690
he taught me that too.
Uh,
most important things.

1326
01:29:33.691 --> 01:29:38.370
One never give up.
Uh,
and two,

1327
01:29:38.371 --> 01:29:43.260
because of his failure and borderline insanity I think,
uh,

1328
01:29:43.261 --> 01:29:48.210
on,
on,
on,
uh,
never admitting defeat.
Um,

1329
01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:54.720
let it go.
Let it go.
Is a citizen Kane specifically?
Yeah.
Let it go.

1330
01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:58.900
Now I,
what was he not able to let go of?
Um,

1331
01:29:59.130 --> 01:30:01.860
and why was it important that he let go?
Because

1332
01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:06.750
he took on,
I mean,
citizen Kane is his masterpiece.

1333
01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:09.440
He took on a,

1334
01:30:09.630 --> 01:30:14.590
a fight that he knew Betty,

1335
01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:15.480
you know,

1336
01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:20.280
anybody who was less arrogant would know you're probably not going to win.

1337
01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:23.700
Which fight was this,
and I don't actually know know my history.
So he was,
he was,

1338
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:28.110
um,
a citizen.
Kane is the story of William Randolph Hearst.
Right.

1339
01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:32.880
And it's deeply personal.
Rosebud is the name,
uh,

1340
01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:37.800
that William Randolph Hearst gave to his mistress private parts.
Okay.
So,

1341
01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:42.060
I mean,
it's,
it's very direct in your face.
Okay.

1342
01:30:42.210 --> 01:30:46.770
The most powerful man on the planet where you're going to take him on.

1343
01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:50.700
You're not coming out without a bloody nose,
maybe broken head.
All right?

1344
01:30:51.090 --> 01:30:55.500
So he gets his head kicked in on that.
So what happened?
I actually don't know.

1345
01:30:55.530 --> 01:30:58.380
Okay.
So,
um,
he makes this movie,

1346
01:30:58.381 --> 01:31:03.120
he's bluffing right at the time he is,
um,
uh,

1347
01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:05.070
he's the highest paid guy in Hollywood,

1348
01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:09.600
more than Spencer Tracy more than Clark Gable.
He's never done a movie.
Okay?

1349
01:31:09.930 --> 01:31:14.700
He's done McBath with an all black cast in New York.

1350
01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:19.840
He's done all of the best radio shows.
He's,
he's brilliant.
Um,

1351
01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:24.180
and he's got all of this stuff going,
but he's never done to movies.

1352
01:31:24.570 --> 01:31:29.070
So he goes and he,
um,
he does,
uh,
uh,
he goes out to RKL.

1353
01:31:29.071 --> 01:31:32.220
They pay him a fortune.
He's bluffing.
He doesn't have a story.

1354
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:37.620
He goes up to San Simeon and he sees her castle,
the Hearst castle,

1355
01:31:37.621 --> 01:31:41.100
and he's like,
this is the story we're gonna tell.
That's insane.

1356
01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:46.670
It's a closed set.
Nobody knows what's going on.
He writes it all header hop head.

1357
01:31:46.671 --> 01:31:49.530
A Harper who's the gossip columnist at the time.

1358
01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:52.470
She finds out about it once it's all done.

1359
01:31:52.770 --> 01:31:55.810
She tells Hearst Hearst goes the Hurst.

1360
01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:59.950
I'm giving you a very short story version of this hurst eventually to all of the

1361
01:31:59.951 --> 01:32:03.820
heads of the movies that the studios and says,

1362
01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:06.790
here are the pictures of the homosexuals that work for you.

1363
01:32:07.150 --> 01:32:10.300
Here are the pictures and I don't think I need to remind to America about all

1364
01:32:10.301 --> 01:32:13.570
the Jews that work here and he just takes them all out and says,

1365
01:32:13.571 --> 01:32:18.500
I'm going to destroy all of you.
I want this film destroyed wells,

1366
01:32:18.501 --> 01:32:19.311
gets on a plane,

1367
01:32:19.311 --> 01:32:24.311
flies up to Rko in New York and meets with all the Jewish investors and the

1368
01:32:24.531 --> 01:32:29.531
board and it's right after Czechoslovakia and so they're very well aware of

1369
01:32:30.201 --> 01:32:31.220
what's happening in Hitler.

1370
01:32:31.490 --> 01:32:35.990
Will wells gives one of his best performances ever and basically he says,

1371
01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:41.000
you don't let one man squashed the free speech of everyone else.

1372
01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:42.253
They release it.

1373
01:32:43.630 --> 01:32:48.340
Hearst destroys him in it.
It just had everybody come in.

1374
01:32:48.370 --> 01:32:49.930
Yeah,
just just hammers it.

1375
01:32:50.370 --> 01:32:53.470
It's remembered as a horrible movie and everything else.

1376
01:32:53.530 --> 01:32:56.230
Not found until the 60s when it's found in the 60s.

1377
01:32:56.231 --> 01:33:00.160
I already realizes this something masterpiece,
but he couldn't let it go.

1378
01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:03.760
He couldn't let it go.
I couldn't give up the fight.
No.
Just,
just let it go,
man.

1379
01:33:04.090 --> 01:33:05.920
You did a great thing.
Now go do something else.

1380
01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:09.600
How have you found that to apply to your own life?
I,

1381
01:33:09.601 --> 01:33:13.800
have there been any moments where that has been particularly relevant for you?

1382
01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:17.550
Yeah,
I think right now he's one of those moments.

1383
01:33:18.270 --> 01:33:22.830
<v 7>Um,
uh,
for me on a,</v>

1384
01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:29.380
<v 6>I believe the things that I believe about the country and the direction that</v>

1385
01:33:29.601 --> 01:33:34.550
we're headed with progressivism and,
uh,
I don't agree with it,

1386
01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:40.580
but the country's made its choice.
Okay.
Let it go.

1387
01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:41.823
And

1388
01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:47.750
now let's see what impact I can make in a positive to help bring people together

1389
01:33:49.470 --> 01:33:53.670
and make it the best that we possibly can.

1390
01:33:53.671 --> 01:33:58.380
So we don't go down some of these horrible roads that we've gone down before in

1391
01:33:58.381 --> 01:34:01.740
the past.
What about Walt Disney?

1392
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:05.383
<v 7>MMM.</v>

1393
01:34:05.710 --> 01:34:07.780
<v 6>Walt Disney.
Most people don't know.</v>

1394
01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:13.280
Walt Disney was responsible for the death of his parents.
Um,
I didn't know that.

1395
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:14.520
Yeah.
Um,

1396
01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:20.100
it Walt I love because he was eternally optimistic and he believed in a better

1397
01:34:20.861 --> 01:34:25.180
tomorrow.
And,
um,
he had a horrible childhood.

1398
01:34:25.181 --> 01:34:27.610
His father was abusive and his mother,
he loved,

1399
01:34:28.090 --> 01:34:30.390
but his father was a,

1400
01:34:31.690 --> 01:34:36.640
he just was not a good guy and,
and was,
it was a loser.
And,
um,

1401
01:34:37.330 --> 01:34:40.540
uh,
but Walton,
his brother loved him and,
and uh,

1402
01:34:40.541 --> 01:34:43.480
wanted to bring him out to California.
So when they first became successful,

1403
01:34:43.481 --> 01:34:47.170
they decided to buy a house,
but they didn't.
Um,
you know,

1404
01:34:47.171 --> 01:34:49.270
back then you didn't have inspections and everything else.

1405
01:34:49.271 --> 01:34:52.540
So they bring the family out and his father calls him run.

1406
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:55.660
Soon as they move into the house,
his father calls him,
says,
wall,

1407
01:34:56.350 --> 01:35:00.440
something's wrong with your mom.
You've got to come to the house quick.

1408
01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:03.350
She's sick.
Something's wrong.
When they got there,

1409
01:35:03.410 --> 01:35:05.840
they were both dead on the floor.
There was a gas leak.

1410
01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:11.500
So the House that they bought their family and then didn't do the due diligence

1411
01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:15.560
section of right,
it had a gas leak and it killed their parents.

1412
01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:20.480
They never ever spoke about it.
So he had really tragic stuff happening his life.

1413
01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:24.980
But he was really,
really optimistic.
More importantly,
um,

1414
01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:30.650
Walt I think saw the future.
Um,
I have a book that,
um,

1415
01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.290
uh,
was really hard to find.

1416
01:35:33.291 --> 01:35:37.130
It was the book that he carried in his pocket the last 10 years of his life.

1417
01:35:37.670 --> 01:35:38.630
It's called the garden.

1418
01:35:38.631 --> 01:35:43.631
Cities of tomorrow is printed in night in 1898 and it's the first book on urban

1419
01:35:45.381 --> 01:35:46.214
planning.

1420
01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:51.420
This is the key behind Epcot in what he believed.
Um,

1421
01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:55.780
Epcot was,
Epcot is a dream killer.
I was just talking to the head of,
um,

1422
01:35:56.100 --> 01:36:00.980
uh,
uh,
imagineering at Disney and we were talking about,
he was there,

1423
01:36:00.981 --> 01:36:04.460
part of the team as a younger man making Epcot.
And he said,
I said,

1424
01:36:04.461 --> 01:36:05.510
how did that feel?
And he said,

1425
01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:10.190
I never felt like I had ever killed a man's dream more than making Epcot.

1426
01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:12.770
And,
um,
uh,

1427
01:36:13.490 --> 01:36:18.490
Walt saw the future and was responsible in many ways for us going to the moon.

1428
01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:22.250
Um,

1429
01:36:22.250 --> 01:36:26.000
he was the guy who brought Wernher von Braun and ward Kimball together and did

1430
01:36:26.001 --> 01:36:30.740
an episode in 1955 called man in space because of that episode.

1431
01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:35.090
Um,
the legend is that Eisenhower called Walton said,

1432
01:36:35.450 --> 01:36:37.010
while you son of a bitch,
you did it.

1433
01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:39.650
I've been trying to convince the Pentagon we could go to space.

1434
01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:42.680
You did it better.
You convince the American people.

1435
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:45.590
And I think in 1955,

1436
01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:50.150
it was very much the same kind of atmosphere that we have now to where people

1437
01:36:50.151 --> 01:36:54.170
are concerned.
They don't know.
The technology is all about to change.

1438
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:59.420
We could destroy ourselves in a heartbeat.
We,
you know,
they had the cold war.

1439
01:36:59.421 --> 01:37:04.280
We now have what's brewing over in the Middle East.
We're afraid,
um,

1440
01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:08.900
uh,
the world is changing under our feet rapidly.

1441
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:14.330
Somebody just needs to be a warm blanket and say it's okay.

1442
01:37:15.170 --> 01:37:19.040
Look this way,
look to silicon valley,
look to space,

1443
01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:21.500
look to what's on the horizon.

1444
01:37:21.890 --> 01:37:25.940
If we all just take a deep breath,
relax,

1445
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.580
believe in the best of one another.
I believe that the,

1446
01:37:29.670 --> 01:37:31.880
the principles of America work,

1447
01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:36.350
we're gonna make it and it will be a far greater tomorrow than it has been in

1448
01:37:36.351 --> 01:37:37.184
the past.

1449
01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:40.130
That's part of the reason of all the places in the world I've chosen to live

1450
01:37:40.131 --> 01:37:45.131
here in SF and Silicon Valley's because there's such an element of optimism and

1451
01:37:45.711 --> 01:37:49.580
possibility with Peter.
Uh,
people like Peter Diamandis actually lives in la,

1452
01:37:49.581 --> 01:37:52.640
but he's chairman of the x prize and,
uh,
you know,
the Elon musks of the world,

1453
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:56.160
ironically enough also in so cal,
uh,
but it's,
um,

1454
01:37:57.810 --> 01:38:02.040
<v 3>it's a place where if you will ask why not.
Yes,
quite a bit.
Um,</v>

1455
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:06.450
love to ask one more question and then a few questions from my,
for my,

1456
01:38:06.451 --> 01:38:07.950
for my listeners.
Uh,

1457
01:38:08.190 --> 01:38:12.000
the first is if you could give your 30 year old self

1458
01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:18.420
one piece of advice or two pieces of advice,
what would it be?
Relax.

1459
01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:25.300
Why?
Um,
I dunno,
I,

1460
01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:28.810
I've always been in a hurry and I've always felt like,
ah,

1461
01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:33.180
got to get it done.
Got To get it done.
Relax.
Let it,
let it,

1462
01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:37.500
let it happen.
It,
it's a,
um,

1463
01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:41.280
nothing ever is good when it's forced.

1464
01:38:41.370 --> 01:38:42.930
Nothing's ever good.

1465
01:38:42.931 --> 01:38:47.130
When you try too hard,
you know,

1466
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:49.350
do your best,
then let it go.

1467
01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:53.790
If you could give yourself one more piece of advice when,
uh,

1468
01:38:53.970 --> 01:38:57.690
when you've just got hired to work with Fox News,
what would that advice be?

1469
01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:03.390
I do,
and I've thought about a lot,

1470
01:39:03.630 --> 01:39:08.520
and I'm trying to think of an answer here.
I,
I was really,

1471
01:39:08.670 --> 01:39:10.560
um,
believe it or not,

1472
01:39:11.670 --> 01:39:15.030
I tried really hard to do the right thing.
I saw,

1473
01:39:15.031 --> 01:39:17.760
I don't know what advice I would give myself because

1474
01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:22.800
I know I didn't do it right.

1475
01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:28.880
I don't know how else to have done it in that time period of where I was,

1476
01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:32.460
you know what I mean?
Um,

1477
01:39:37.770 --> 01:39:41.430
maybe
this,
I mean,

1478
01:39:42.030 --> 01:39:45.060
this sounds horrible,
but maybe they won't listen.

1479
01:39:47.310 --> 01:39:48.143
They will listen.

1480
01:39:48.330 --> 01:39:52.980
But I don't like that advice because that leads me to say it's passing fry.
Yeah.

1481
01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:02.740
It's tough.
I've,
I've heard said before,
you got the,

1482
01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:06.030
the person who says nothing can be done in the person who says everything will

1483
01:40:06.031 --> 01:40:10.590
be all right,
are the same because neither does anything.
Yeah.
And that's that.

1484
01:40:10.591 --> 01:40:15.180
And I don't,
I don't accept that and,
but I don't know how else to have done it.

1485
01:40:15.210 --> 01:40:20.130
I mean,
uh,
I,
I have racked my brain on it and,

1486
01:40:20.610 --> 01:40:22.950
and I racked my brain then.
I mean,
you know,

1487
01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:29.300
you have to be a pretty bad monster to kick up the dust that I kicked up without

1488
01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:36.780
any reflection on it during it.

1489
01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:41.090
You know what I mean?
You,
you,
um,
I mean,
I,

1490
01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:46.050
I think that would probably be the more surprising thing.
Uh,

1491
01:40:47.190 --> 01:40:50.850
you know,
the,
the,
the staff I have is still the staff.

1492
01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:54.280
A lot of the staff that I had at CNN and staff that I had at Fox

1493
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:58.930
<v 6>and a lot of the staff,
they don't agree with me politically.</v>

1494
01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:03.730
Um,
you know,
I have atheists,
I have,
uh,
Democrats.

1495
01:41:03.731 --> 01:41:07.840
I have progressive's,
you know,
I have my,
my uh,

1496
01:41:08.110 --> 01:41:12.850
director is from San Francisco and she's is about as progressive as you can get.

1497
01:41:13.630 --> 01:41:17.980
We agree on principles.
And so what are the principles you guys agree on?

1498
01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:22.600
Uh,
that we need to try to be good to one another.

1499
01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:24.400
We need to take care of one another.

1500
01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:28.390
We can be better tomorrow.

1501
01:41:28.890 --> 01:41:32.640
<v 7>Um,
uh,
uh,</v>

1502
01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:36.810
<v 6>don't fuel hate.
Um,
but as we,</v>

1503
01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:40.180
as we have gone through this there with me,

1504
01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:45.220
because I've looked to them and said,
how am I missing it?

1505
01:41:45.250 --> 01:41:49.420
What am I help me help me?
How could I,
you know,

1506
01:41:49.421 --> 01:41:54.421
and so I've had many of my advisors are the ones who don't agree with me.

1507
01:41:55.300 --> 01:42:00.040
Some of my best friends are people who don't agree with me politically.
Um,

1508
01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:04.990
and they've helped me a lot.
Um,
uh,

1509
01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:08.290
but I don't know how to mix.
I don't think you can,

1510
01:42:08.291 --> 01:42:13.060
I don't know how you mix politics with reality because I don't think politics is

1511
01:42:13.061 --> 01:42:13.660
real.

1512
01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:17.250
<v 4>So this is this actually a good segway.
So I'd love to ask you,
I know we're,</v>

1513
01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:19.060
we're running tight on time now,

1514
01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:22.930
but just before we close up a couple of questions from people on Facebook and I

1515
01:42:22.931 --> 01:42:27.070
think that at least one or two then we'll,
we'll perhaps offer an opportunity to,

1516
01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:30.600
as you did earlier,
correct.
Some misperceptions and so on.
Uh,

1517
01:42:30.730 --> 01:42:32.660
so the first one is a,

1518
01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:38.380
is from Matt brand and a,
the question is,
and again,
I have no,

1519
01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:42.560
no agenda and asking him to send it.
I'm very curious to hear you answer it.
Uh,

1520
01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:47.650
if you were to theoretically be reborn as a disabled gay woman into a poor

1521
01:42:47.651 --> 01:42:50.530
family,
what political system would you want in place?

1522
01:42:53.290 --> 01:42:56.320
<v 6>Uh,
a libertarian one,</v>

1523
01:42:57.580 --> 01:43:00.220
the one that I'm advocating for,
I'd love to hear you elaborate.

1524
01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:04.660
A one where we are,
uh,

1525
01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:06.580
free to be who we are.

1526
01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:11.500
We are judged on the content of our character,
not our abilities,

1527
01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:16.830
color of our skin or sexual preferences or our political preferences.

1528
01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:21.970
I mean,
um,
uh,

1529
01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:28.080
the most power to the individual is the system that I want and it's the one that

1530
01:43:29.341 --> 01:43:32.790
I think the constitution gives us,

1531
01:43:32.850 --> 01:43:35.970
not the constitution that we've been living under for a hundred years.
We don't,

1532
01:43:35.971 --> 01:43:40.440
we don't even recognize the constitution anymore.
Um,
but one where,

1533
01:43:41.250 --> 01:43:42.083
um,

1534
01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:47.980
the individual is empowered at the maximum and the government is at the minimum,

1535
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:53.130
although we do need government.

1536
01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:58.070
<v 4>So I suppose it's almost like a,
it's one of the most famous track coaches,</v>

1537
01:43:58.071 --> 01:43:59.600
and I'm blanking on his name,
said he's,

1538
01:43:59.601 --> 01:44:02.560
he's broken dozens of world records is in the four hour body.
But he said,
uh,

1539
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:05.990
the goal is to do the least amount necessary.
Not the most possible.

1540
01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:08.990
<v 6>Yes.
Yes.
That's the way government should be.</v>

1541
01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:15.140
<v 4>The next question is from Alex Kirby and it is what are some of the things we</v>

1542
01:44:15.141 --> 01:44:16.680
can do to quote,

1543
01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:20.600
rebrand capitalism and encourage entrepreneurship to people here in the U S and

1544
01:44:20.601 --> 01:44:21.434
abroad?

1545
01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:27.280
<v 6>Tell stories.
Tell the stories like what you do,
you know,</v>

1546
01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:30.010
um,
uh,

1547
01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:35.010
let people see what's really happening in America.
No,
the,

1548
01:44:35.011 --> 01:44:38.820
the media is full of crap and uh,

1549
01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:43.290
and nobody in the media is empowered to tell the story of the people who are

1550
01:44:43.291 --> 01:44:47.130
reinventing the world cause they're reinventing a world that doesn't include the

1551
01:44:47.131 --> 01:44:49.650
people who have all the power right now.
You know what I mean?

1552
01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:54.980
So the best thing we can do is as individuals look for the stories of the people

1553
01:44:55.771 --> 01:45:00.600
who are changing the world.
I really feel that,
um,

1554
01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:05.760
a gift that,
um,
that I have that,
uh,

1555
01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:11.660
I want to use is to be able to connect and highlight the dreamers and the doers

1556
01:45:15.690 --> 01:45:18.840
of tomorrow.
Kind of like what Walt Disney did with the,

1557
01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:23.460
with the space shot to be able to highlight them and show the American people

1558
01:45:23.461 --> 01:45:27.450
again,
you know,
it's,
it's good to dream and,
and we will make it.

1559
01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:31.880
MMM MMM.
But highlight those,

1560
01:45:32.210 --> 01:45:36.410
those people and look for those people and uh,
stop.

1561
01:45:38.020 --> 01:45:40.600
Stop considering what we're doing now.
Capitalism,

1562
01:45:40.601 --> 01:45:44.260
because we're not doing capitalism.
We're in some sort of crony,

1563
01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:49.860
I dunno.
Capitalism.
That's just,
it's ugly.
Now.
This isn't capitalism.

1564
01:45:51.690 --> 01:45:56.690
<v 4>What a t if you were to leave people listening to this with a one piece of</v>

1565
01:45:57.061 --> 01:45:59.100
advice or question they can ask themselves,

1566
01:45:59.810 --> 01:46:02.850
<v 6>okay,
what would that be?
Okay.</v>

1567
01:46:04.670 --> 01:46:09.290
What role have you played in the,
um,

1568
01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.710
in the dialogue of,

1569
01:46:13.610 --> 01:46:16.160
of humanity lately?

1570
01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:21.140
Are you playing a positive role or a negative role?

1571
01:46:22.130 --> 01:46:27.130
How can you change or enhance that to,

1572
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:28.783
um,

1573
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:33.940
make the most positive impact?

1574
01:46:34.650 --> 01:46:37.240
Um,
who is it that

1575
01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:43.850
you should reach out to and go,
hey,
dude,
I really screwed up.
Okay,

1576
01:46:44.130 --> 01:46:48.810
I'm really sorry,
or I misread you or you misread me and I want to fix.

1577
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:51.930
Um,
who have you,

1578
01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:57.860
who or what have you done that has puts you way out of your comfort zone

1579
01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:00.593
lately?

1580
01:47:02.230 --> 01:47:06.230
<v 4>That's a strong question.
That's a very,
very powerful question.
Uh,</v>

1581
01:47:07.150 --> 01:47:09.800
one personal question and then we'll close up with how people can,

1582
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:12.250
can find you and what they,
where they can learn more about you.

1583
01:47:13.180 --> 01:47:14.200
If you were in my position,

1584
01:47:14.201 --> 01:47:18.280
I've always tended to stray away from politics because I quite frankly don't

1585
01:47:18.281 --> 01:47:19.630
know what label to apply to myself.

1586
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:22.690
I go to fly to Alaska to go hunting and eat everything.

1587
01:47:22.691 --> 01:47:26.710
I hunt live in San Francisco,
lots of gay friends,
like minimal government.

1588
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:30.580
You're a libertarian.
I guess that's what somebody said.
Socially Liberal,

1589
01:47:31.450 --> 01:47:33.400
financially conservative.
I don't even know where to start.

1590
01:47:34.190 --> 01:47:39.190
<v 6>And Conservatives can get along entirely if they're libertarian because I'm not</v>

1591
01:47:41.601 --> 01:47:43.580
going to control your life and you're not going to control mine.

1592
01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:48.680
So I don't care what lifestyle you lead,
it doesn't matter to me,
you know,

1593
01:47:48.681 --> 01:47:52.790
let's just be good to each other.
You do your thing.
I'll do my thing.
And let's,

1594
01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:56.120
let's just be good to each other that that's,

1595
01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:57.230
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1596
01:47:57.230 --> 01:47:59.360
<v 6>that's how we get together.
It's this,</v>

1597
01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:02.720
I'm going to control your life and I'm going to tell you who you can marry and

1598
01:48:02.721 --> 01:48:06.740
what you can eat and how you carry your gun and what you do and how you do your

1599
01:48:06.741 --> 01:48:09.920
job.
And that's crazy.
That's crazy.

1600
01:48:09.970 --> 01:48:14.260
<v 4>Each to their own.
Where can people learn more about you?</v>

1601
01:48:14.740 --> 01:48:16.720
Where would you like people to visit you online?

1602
01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:21.830
