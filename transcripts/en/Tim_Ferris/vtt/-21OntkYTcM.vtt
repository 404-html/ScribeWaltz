1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.840
Optimal at this altitude.

2
00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:07.841
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking it.

3
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.610
I'm a cybernetic organism.

4
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.980
<v 1>Well,
hello there,
my dear little munchkins.
This is Tim Ferriss.</v>

5
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.470
Pet some caffeine since you last heard from me.

6
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.010
Where you're about to hear is part two of a multipart conversation with Tony

7
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.660
Robbins.
To put it briefly,

8
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.810
Tony Robbins is a performance strategist with clients including presidents like

9
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:49.620
Bill Clinton,
Mother Teresa,
not making this up.
Andre Agassi,

10
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:53.670
Leonardo Dicaprio,
and Oprah Winfrey who calls him superhuman.

11
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.410
This guy is a force of nature.
If you didn't catch the first part,

12
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.820
you might want to do that before venturing in,
but really we jumped around a lot,

13
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.070
cover a lot of different topics,
so if you don't mind,

14
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:08.100
your stories is more of a jigsaw puzzle.
Then by all means,

15
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.260
keep on listening from this point on.

16
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.810
This episode is brought to you by 99 designs.com the largest marketplace of

17
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:18.750
graphic designers in the world.
Here's how it works.

18
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.990
You go to 99 designs.com I suggest four slash Tim for reasons I'll explain and

19
00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:29.310
whether you need to create a logo,
a website,
a car wrap,

20
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.000
a bumper sticker,
whatever it might be,
a t shirt,

21
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.390
you can put up what you need to description.

22
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.740
Then designers around the world compete for your business by submitting ideas

23
00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:41.910
and designs and so on.

24
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.950
And in less than a week you have an original design that you love or you get all

25
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:51.000
your money back.
And I have used 99 designs for years,

26
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.100
including for some very big projects like the book cover or at least uh,

27
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.950
brainstorming book cover ideas for the four hour body,

28
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.830
which went on to become a number one New York Times bestseller and is in,
uh,

29
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.900
I dunno,
it doesn't plus languages and has sold a good Julian copies.

30
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:11.901
So I have used it when time and money has been of the essence.

31
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.390
It is a fantastic tool and if you go to 99 designs.com forward slash Tim,

38
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.190
please enjoy part to the final part of the Tim Ferriss show with Tony Robbins.

39
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.860
And to,
to touch on a few things that you mentioned,
uh,

40
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:54.320
for those people asking themselves,
as I'm sure a lot of people would,
how,

41
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.830
how can I apply what these guys do to what I do?
And I think that you,

42
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.450
you present a of observations articulated very,

43
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:05.500
very well that most people will never be exposed to.
For instance,

44
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.031
uh,
number one,

45
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:12.031
asset allocation does not mean choosing if you are going to be a stock picker or

46
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:16.500
invest in an index fund for the s and p 500 because it was both your,

47
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.330
you're in one bucket,
right?
It's,
you're,
you're in a correlated class.

48
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.280
That's right.
And

49
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.760
<v 2>right.
There's more and more companies,
but it's all within the same asset class.</v>

50
00:03:25.761 --> 00:03:26.050
Yeah.

51
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.640
<v 1>And the other thing is that there are ways,
uh,</v>

52
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.680
there are,
there are ways to look at the problem,
um,

53
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.990
that are not obvious right off the bat.
For instance,
uh,

54
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:42.320
you mentioned something that's so simple,
but a lot of people miss if,

55
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.980
if you invest and you lose 50%,

56
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.390
you have to now have 100% gain to get back to breakeven.
Put another way,

57
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.070
and this is also straight from the book.
If you,
let's just say you a,

58
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:57.990
I think it was investing over,
uh,
it was either five or 10 years,
uh,
the,

59
00:03:57.991 --> 00:04:01.060
the exact number is in the book,
but,
and you had a,

60
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:03.340
you'd invested in the stock market through a,

61
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.090
let's just call it sort of off the shelf mutual fund that charges typical fees

62
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.940
and the market moves up and down,
up and down,
up and down.

63
00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:13.540
At the end of that period of time,
you're back at the same market levels.

64
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.030
You would think if you put in a hundred grand,
you'd be,

65
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.280
you'd have a hundred grand at the end of that period of time.

66
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:21.760
And it ends up that you're,
what,
47% down,
four something,
a fussy eater.
It's,

67
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.740
<v 2>it's the idea of average rates of return.
So it's a lot of people look at their,</v>

68
00:04:25.741 --> 00:04:29.610
what they've invested in their,
their broker or their,
whoever represents them.

69
00:04:29.611 --> 00:04:33.300
We'll still open the portfolio.
Go Look,
you know,
you went up,
you started here,

70
00:04:33.301 --> 00:04:37.410
you went up 50% you went down 50 but you went up to after you went down 50 so

71
00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:41.380
your average rate of return is zero.
But when we put real dollars in there,

72
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.400
$100,000 and you'd go up 50 or 150 you'd go down 50 you're at 75 do you go up 50

73
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.240
oops and then go down and you ended up at $37,000 instead of $100,000 because

74
00:04:53.881 --> 00:04:55.140
your is moving up and down.

75
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.630
So there are all these ways we could do the biggest one,

76
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.020
the biggest lie in the book.
I want you to do seven steps.

77
00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:05.040
So one of those steps is,
frankly,
you got to do what most of us guys,

78
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.050
probably people listening on your team already do.

79
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.360
And that is you've got to become an investor.
You've got to be an owner,

80
00:05:09.361 --> 00:05:12.660
not a consumer.
Right?
And the way to do that,
frankly,
we all know,

81
00:05:12.661 --> 00:05:16.580
but very few people do.
And that's,
you take a percentage,
you lock it down,
it,

82
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.080
you never see it,
it's automated and you put it aside for investment.

83
00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:20.791
And that just occurs.

84
00:05:20.791 --> 00:05:23.610
And I showed the people some of the tools that Nobel prize winners have come up

85
00:05:23.611 --> 00:05:24.990
with.
So if you say,
I have no money,

86
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.420
you can invest more for tomorrow by committing,

87
00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:29.280
when you get a raise or your company to get to the next level,

88
00:05:29.281 --> 00:05:32.310
you automatically have that percentage go there.
So it's money you've never seen.

89
00:05:32.311 --> 00:05:34.890
It's not taking away money from you,
so you're willing to commit to it.
Right.

90
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.740
And there are ways to automate that.
Totally automate.
It was just fantastic.

91
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.520
So you know,
they took,

92
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.270
they took a group of blue collar workers who couldn't say more than 3% and they

93
00:05:42.271 --> 00:05:46.710
showed in 12 years and have up to 16% would absolutely no sense of loss.

94
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.020
Because you know once,
if I,

95
00:05:49.021 --> 00:05:51.140
they show this with example of behaviors showed me the,
if you,

96
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.380
if you give an a monkey in apple,

97
00:05:52.381 --> 00:05:55.710
they go crazy and you give them two apples and they go crazy and if you take one

98
00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:58.940
of the two apples back,
they're angry.
Hell,
they still have the same first apple.

99
00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.630
Okay.

100
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.690
What happens is if you don't give them that second apple but it gets invested

101
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:06.230
for them,
you know that Pete changes your world.
You don't feel a sense of loss,

102
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:10.550
there's no trop and yet you set yourself up saving 1516 70% at a totally

103
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:12.200
different world than three or nothing.
Obviously.

104
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.450
Second piece thought I got through that brought this up for you is you got to

105
00:06:16.451 --> 00:06:19.430
know it's great to get in the game,
but oh my God,
don't get in the game too.

106
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.700
You understand the rules still you're an insider and so I go through the nine

107
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:26.600
biggest lies there and their,
their investment lies there.

108
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:29.600
Wall Street wise are you want to call them,
but they're marketed wise.

109
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.900
There's a reason you believe very heavily marketed,
very heavily market to that.

110
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:36.290
They had to try and one of those is this idea that they're going to beat the

111
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:38.540
market.
And then here's the real facts.

112
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.930
96% check that 96% of all mutual funds in a 10 year period,

113
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:47.270
we'll never even match the market.
Now you're paying a premium.

114
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:48.770
You could have owned an index.
The cost you,

115
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:52.680
you have 20 basis points right at vanguard or 14 basis points manwich which

116
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.040
index you're dealing with.
Instead you're paying,
they say 1% uh,
you ask people,

117
00:06:57.041 --> 00:06:59.600
what have I was just 1% in reality,

118
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.970
if you go through Forbes as shown on the average mutual fund,

119
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:03.320
when you put all fees in,

120
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.720
if you read the prospectus and there's all these 21 be trading,

121
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.010
all these things that don't,
it'll coffee's very often,

122
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:14.810
but their money out of your pocket,
the average is 3.1% now,
when you do that,

123
00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:15.380
here's the problem.

124
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.380
Number one only 4% what's your chance of picking the 4% of mutual funds?

125
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:22.300
They're going to be succeed.
If you go for Morningstar,

126
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.550
you're screwed because I can show you statistically Morningstar,

127
00:07:24.551 --> 00:07:28.430
its own statistics that showed a 10 year period of 250 people that made it to

128
00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:32.090
five star morning star,
four or left doesn't work that way,
right?

129
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.450
So if you could pick the 4%,
if you were magically able to do that,

130
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.180
you can do oh by the 4% is always changing.

131
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.610
So your chances of picking the right mutual fund or 96% against you and the

132
00:07:43.611 --> 00:07:46.580
average person's furrowing can't work.
They don't know how to evaluate this.

133
00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:47.990
They try and tickets,
so they're screwed.

134
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:53.020
And then you get poor performance and you pay somewhere between 10 and 30 times

135
00:07:53.571 --> 00:07:54.980
more for the same investment.

136
00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:58.250
You kind of got for 30 times the 10 to three times less.

137
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.700
If I'd be ultimate insert injury and go,
why does that matter?
Well,
first,

138
00:08:01.701 --> 00:08:04.760
let me give you this so people understand what 96% means.

139
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:08.450
They're getting a 4% possible success rate.
If you're going to play blackjack,

140
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.730
most people not apply,
right?
21 get two face cards.
That's worth 20 points.

141
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:18.620
If your inner idiot says,
hit me,
I got to face guards,

142
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:21.500
go 21 you have an 8% chance of success.

143
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.280
You have a greater chance success there than you did if you're going to find the

144
00:08:25.281 --> 00:08:26.114
right mutual fund.

145
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.210
Now what's your chance of success and getting financially free when?

146
00:08:29.211 --> 00:08:32.510
Here's what's unbelievable.
If if I said to you,
here's an investment,

147
00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:35.930
I want you to try to,
here's how it works.
You put up all the money,

148
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.680
you put up all the risk and I will put up no money and I put up no risk.

149
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.790
And if you,

150
00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:48.260
when I get up to 60% of your entire growth of what you have over the lifetime of

151
00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:50.750
your investing,
you put a bowl of money dealer.
I take no risk.

152
00:08:50.751 --> 00:08:54.290
I put no money on and if you lose,
you lose.
But I don't lose anything.

153
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.500
That's a deal that most people said I'd never taken a million years.

154
00:08:58.501 --> 00:09:01.470
That's the average mutual fund because for every 1% you pay,

155
00:09:01.471 --> 00:09:04.860
it's 20% over the lifetime of your investments of growth.

156
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:07.530
Because just like there's competitive brokers compound at these,
right?

157
00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:11.160
So Google showed me 60% I'm saying,
Jack,
How's this possible?

158
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:14.680
How could people be doing this?
Like he goes,
Tony,
he's a $13 trillion line.

159
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.220
It's called one thing.
Marketing is marketing.

160
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.060
So I've been in the business 64 years.
It makes me crazy and people still do it.

161
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:23.070
The vast majority of people put their money in the mutual fund.

162
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.130
They had an index fund and now now he's come to you know,

163
00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:27.480
be the largest mutual fund in the world.

164
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:29.340
But then the next time now two and a half trillion,

165
00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:32.400
I mean Jack has been modified,
but most of the smart money is there.

166
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.530
It's not the average person's money that's in the index today.

167
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:39.390
So I go through these lies and what you don't know in the financial world will

168
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:42.090
hurt you and the one you're talking about is just the average rate of return.

169
00:09:42.091 --> 00:09:44.860
You want to be seduced when you look at the rate of return.
Bubble said to me,

170
00:09:44.861 --> 00:09:45.600
he's Tony.

171
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.360
Whenever you see what the rate of return was and you're trying to evaluate that

172
00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:51.450
mutual fund based on its past performance,
just know that number is not accurate.

173
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.780
Dalbar did in gradable study 20 year study,

174
00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:00.160
you found the average mutual fund owner over 20 year period of time made 2.5%

175
00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:02.064
net.

176
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.870
The market was 9.7% that'll give you a sense.

177
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.590
So you know,
I,
I went to go do this book and I won't mention the person's name,

178
00:10:10.591 --> 00:10:13.650
like all these incredible endorsements from everybody.
Nobel Prize winners,
right?

179
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.840
Something,
billionaires,
all these guys.

180
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.390
There's a particular person that I really good friend if I don't want you to
pay,

181
00:10:18.391 --> 00:10:20.130
but it was ironic,
he wrote me back and said,
well,

182
00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:22.380
my team's read it and they really don't think it's that,
you know,

183
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.610
that that special.
I thought,
well,
I'm not insulted by that,
but it's,

184
00:10:25.611 --> 00:10:26.610
it doesn't make sense to me.

185
00:10:26.611 --> 00:10:29.790
And then I found out this person has six mutual funds.

186
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.250
<v 1>Yeah,
the dude gun asking Barbara my fault.</v>

187
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:45.080
I should point out to folks also that some people are very math phobic.

188
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.240
Part of the reason that I went to Princeton.
And it's funny,

189
00:10:48.241 --> 00:10:52.980
I was reading Carl ICAHN's story and how he was,
he was just,
you had told him,

190
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.710
he was told he would never get into any ivy league schools and he chose

191
00:10:55.711 --> 00:10:57.240
Princeton.
Same thing happened to me.

192
00:10:57.241 --> 00:11:00.900
I was told I would never get in to a whole host of schools because,

193
00:11:00.901 --> 00:11:03.590
and this is kind of like your,
your mutual fund guy.
People,

194
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:07.440
humans respond to incentives and this particular guidance counselors

195
00:11:07.441 --> 00:11:11.910
incentivized for what to optimize to be able to say x number x percentage of

196
00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:15.300
students got into their first choice school.
So how do you do that?

197
00:11:15.301 --> 00:11:19.170
Most easily lower their expectations.
Uh,
but the,
uh,

198
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.740
I am intrinsically not someone with a lot of math background.

199
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.290
Part of the reason I chose Princeton over other schools because they didn't have

200
00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:28.260
a math requirement.
And I think for a lot of people listening,
they may be like,

201
00:11:28.261 --> 00:11:31.230
oh my God,
percentages and compounding odds.
It's very overwhelming.

202
00:11:31.231 --> 00:11:36.231
And I think that part of the reason your book had to be as long as it is,

203
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.430
uh,
and book should be as long as it needs to be,

204
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.330
is that if you were to try to compress it into 100 pages,

205
00:11:42.331 --> 00:11:45.930
it would be like watching a three hour action movie.

206
00:11:45.931 --> 00:11:48.810
But getting a frame every five minutes you wouldn't,

207
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.920
it would be too much and too little space.
But when people read the,

208
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.003
when I read the book,

209
00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:54.880
<v 2>uh,</v>

210
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.930
you're leading people in a logical progression from building block the building

211
00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:03.010
block to building blocks so that by the end people are very,
very savvy.

212
00:12:03.011 --> 00:12:05.620
And so people who are,
who might be thinking,
oh my God,
this is,

213
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:10.390
this is really a lot for me to absorb
the book.
I'm telling you stories too.

214
00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:14.080
And I think the stories take it away so it's not numbered.
You Go,
Holy Shit.

215
00:12:14.081 --> 00:12:16.690
If it's to be,
if you had three of my friends,

216
00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:20.650
I'll put aside the same amount of money and we both got a 7% return,

217
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:25.330
but my buddies getting fees of 3%,
my other buddies too,

218
00:12:25.331 --> 00:12:27.790
and I'm one and we both put in all three of us,

219
00:12:27.791 --> 00:12:30.100
put 1 million bucks in or 100,000 I do you want to do it?

220
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:35.700
I the person with 3% of these ends up with 65% less money and they got the same

221
00:12:36.161 --> 00:12:36.994
rate of return.

222
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.730
They start with the same amount of money over the same period of time.

223
00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.120
And I think when you see that with real people's lives,
you start to go,

224
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.220
I don't have to know the math.
I just know one thing,

225
00:12:45.221 --> 00:12:49.090
fees matter and I'm going to cut those babies to the absolute base.
Definitely.

226
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.350
And A,
I'd love to talk you,
you brought it up a little earlier.
Uh,

227
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.950
Ray Daleo as asset allocation because it's something I've been thinking about a

228
00:12:56.951 --> 00:13:00.730
lot considering that due to paper gains,

229
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.220
I'd say I have a very,
very,
very,

230
00:13:03.221 --> 00:13:06.990
very high double digits of my entire net worth in tech.
Uh,

231
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:10.220
and it's hard unfortunately to rebalance when you have a lot of private stock.

232
00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:15.000
They can't be traded.
Uh,
but,
uh,
you know,
it,
it's the,
but uh,

233
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.370
Daleo someone I've been fascinated by for so long.
Uh,

234
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:19.870
maybe you could talk about the,

235
00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.470
the all seasons and what some of the stuff that you,

236
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.500
that you chatted with him about as it relates to asset allocation.

237
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.620
It might be helpful for people to take a second and give people his background.

238
00:13:29.621 --> 00:13:32.800
I mean,
Ray's not the guy you would think of as master of the universe.

239
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:36.730
It comes from Queens.
His Dad was a jazz musician.
His mom was a homemaker,

240
00:13:36.731 --> 00:13:39.330
really lovely lady.
He went from,
you know,

241
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:43.210
very lower middle class family and decided that you wanted to go work at a golf

242
00:13:43.211 --> 00:13:45.340
course.
He bumped into,
you know,

243
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.490
one of the things I talk about is proximity affects your life,

244
00:13:47.491 --> 00:13:48.400
where you're in proximity with,

245
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:50.860
and he's around the proximity with very wealthy people and they're talking about

246
00:13:50.861 --> 00:13:54.970
stocks and he got fascinated by it and got hooked on the process and then,

247
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.130
you know,
got involved in the stock business.

248
00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:01.090
But he got involved in a time period when the world was incredibly volatile,

249
00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:03.490
the 1970s and we're all shaped by our time periods.
Right.

250
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.860
And so if you can imagine,
you know,

251
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.700
that's a time we have this massive inflation where Nixon goes on television and

252
00:14:09.701 --> 00:14:11.560
says,
we're going off the gold standard.

253
00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.230
That money as you know what called US dollar,

254
00:14:14.231 --> 00:14:15.730
we're not going to back up with anything.

255
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.170
And he thought for sure the markets would just be destroyed,

256
00:14:20.171 --> 00:14:22.360
the American dollar is going to be worthless.
And His dad,

257
00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:24.640
they had what was called the Nixon rally and it was like,

258
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:29.260
it shook him to his core that as much as you think you know,
you don't know.

259
00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.860
And it gave him a lifelong focused.
It says,
I always want to be asking,

260
00:14:32.861 --> 00:14:37.390
what do I not know and how do I find,
understand the system as a whole,

261
00:14:37.391 --> 00:14:40.360
not just my perspective on the system.
And um,

262
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:42.400
and so we started Bridgewater and in fact,

263
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.190
my friend Paul Tudor Jones gave him some initial capital,
do this.

264
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.710
It is wishing he didn't loan it to him,
but would have kept it as an investment.

265
00:14:47.711 --> 00:14:50.440
I think at this stage Bridgewater give so gigantic.

266
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.410
But what happened was he's the guy,
the u s government too,

267
00:14:54.411 --> 00:14:55.910
when they're trying to figure how to design tips.

268
00:14:55.911 --> 00:14:56.900
I mean this is the level design.

269
00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.190
He's the guy that when Mcdonald's is trying to come out with egg with mcnuggets

270
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:03.640
and they're trying to figure out how can we make sure we have enough supply of

271
00:15:03.641 --> 00:15:07.550
chicken and he's the one figured out the math of futures and what to do.

272
00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:10.700
So Mcdonald's could even do that.
That's the way this man's brain works.

273
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
So over the years he built this Alpha Fund and it's very intensive and he's lost

274
00:15:16.401 --> 00:15:20.900
money in 23 years,
three times on that fund.
And the Fund has returned.

275
00:15:20.901 --> 00:15:24.170
21% owned it for 23 years.

276
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.800
Just mind boggling before fees and then turn around.

277
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.370
And after all these years he said,
you know,
everybody talks about,
you know,

278
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.350
different stage of life.
You want to protect yourself.

279
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.100
So you do a balanced portfolio,
50% 60% in stocks,

280
00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:39.860
maybe 40 or 50% you know,
if you're in bonds,

281
00:15:39.861 --> 00:15:41.930
because you know when the stocks are more volatile,

282
00:15:41.931 --> 00:15:43.850
the bonds are going to bounce you out.
And then he says,
you know,

283
00:15:43.851 --> 00:15:46.070
but it didn't look that way in 2000 didn't look there too.

284
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.770
That all went down 2008 right?
So over the years he said,

285
00:15:48.771 --> 00:15:52.000
this is a story everybody buys,
but it's not reality,
you know,

286
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:56.060
whole segments of time.
So he began to pursue what he said.

287
00:15:56.061 --> 00:16:00.680
What if I wasn't around,
I need a passive,
almost passive form investment.

288
00:16:00.681 --> 00:16:05.390
I need something that wouldn't take 1500 people that my kids could use that you

289
00:16:05.391 --> 00:16:08.750
know,
that would support all my philanthropic efforts if I wasn't here.

290
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.560
And he questioned everything about asset allocation that anybody's ever been

291
00:16:12.561 --> 00:16:16.700
taught and came up with a different way of looking at it where he basically said

292
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:20.630
there are four things that move the price of any investment.

293
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.650
It's inflation and deflation and whether the economy is growing or shrinking.

294
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.640
And that creates for different seasons in which every,

295
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:32.900
every type of investment stocks,
commodity is gold,
a real estate.

296
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:37.010
It has an ideal environment which it grows and as environments in which AP will

297
00:16:37.011 --> 00:16:37.910
absolutely slam.

298
00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:42.650
And so he figured out what's the right combination of these things so that I can

299
00:16:42.651 --> 00:16:45.790
reduce the risk to the lowest level of loss possible.
Which you know,

300
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.720
Warren Buffett's rules,
everybody talks about the rule,
right?

301
00:16:47.721 --> 00:16:50.720
It hasn't Warren Buffet's rule,
it actually comes from his teacher,
which was,

302
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.210
you know,
rule number one to investing.
Don't lose money.
Rule number two,

303
00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:55.790
see rule number one,
right?
So how do I make that happen,

304
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:59.450
but also maximize the mountain upsides as much upside as possible.

305
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.380
He called his all weather fund because it works in all weather and he did all

306
00:17:03.381 --> 00:17:07.850
his own investing in for 10 years and he back tested it all the way to nine 1925

307
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:10.490
and said,
oh my God,
I have discovered something unbelievable.

308
00:17:10.491 --> 00:17:14.420
So the only people got to use this is he.
And then finally his clients,

309
00:17:14.421 --> 00:17:17.000
the $5 billion net worth,
the governments,
the pension funds.

310
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.400
So I've read about it and you know,

311
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:21.650
rate is very few interviews as I'm sure you know,
you go online,

312
00:17:21.651 --> 00:17:24.620
you won't find a whole lot,
you know,
in front of the Congress.
You know,

313
00:17:24.621 --> 00:17:28.520
maybe at Davos every now and then he kind of avoids any publicity and so forth.

314
00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.910
And I did all my homework on him.
I know Paul Tutors,
one of his dearest friends,

315
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.390
arranged to go see him,
play it all out and I was prepared.

316
00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:39.050
And then I go into this meeting and I started asking him,
I asked him a question,

317
00:17:39.051 --> 00:17:42.320
I ask everybody,
which was,
if you can't,
you couldn't pass on in your money,

318
00:17:42.321 --> 00:17:46.760
your children,
none.
All you could pass on was a set of principles.

319
00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.250
And Investment Strategy in a portfolio,
what would it be for your kids?

320
00:17:50.251 --> 00:17:52.980
So they don't have your skill?
Everybody give me different answers.

321
00:17:52.981 --> 00:17:56.410
But his answer was,
won't be my all,
you know,
all weather approach.
I said,

322
00:17:56.411 --> 00:17:57.330
so explain to me how it works.

323
00:17:57.331 --> 00:18:00.190
Explain it just like me telling it to you right now real fast.
You know,

324
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.190
people are probably going,
I don't have a clue what he just said.

325
00:18:02.191 --> 00:18:06.090
It's seems logical.
Um,
but the one thing he said is,

326
00:18:06.091 --> 00:18:08.280
Toni is when people think they've got a balanced portfolio,

327
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:13.560
stocks are three times more volatile than bonds.
So when you're 50,

328
00:18:13.561 --> 00:18:15.970
50 you really 90 10 yup.

329
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.840
You really are massively at risk.

330
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.210
And that's why when the markets go down and you get eaten alive.

331
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.010
So he has this portfolio,
describes principals.
I said,
I said,
you know what?
Right?

332
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.900
I said,
this is spectacular.
I understand it.
They said,

333
00:18:27.901 --> 00:18:31.320
the only way you really get the result from this is if you know the exact

334
00:18:31.321 --> 00:18:33.170
percentages.
It's like if you've got to,

335
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.700
even even if you've got some his recipe and you put in a gallon,

336
00:18:35.701 --> 00:18:38.400
when they put in a teaspoon of a particular ingredient,
you're messed up.

337
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:43.650
So I say,
I need the secret sauce.
And he likes them.
He laughs.
He goes,
Tony,
yeah,

338
00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:44.670
that's my business.

339
00:18:44.671 --> 00:18:47.370
And that's when he gave me the whole $5 billion net worth and you know,

340
00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.950
got out of 100 million.
I said,
yeah,
right.

341
00:18:48.951 --> 00:18:51.210
But you just got to tell him you haven't take anybody's money for 10 years.

342
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.850
You're not going to take anybody's money.
He goes,
yeah,
but you know,

343
00:18:53.851 --> 00:18:57.120
it's really complex.
And I said,
I know it is,
but give me a simple version.

344
00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.880
And he said,
no,
you know,
it's always changing.
I said,

345
00:18:59.881 --> 00:19:02.090
give me a version with no leverage and the average person can do it.

346
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.810
You just got done telling me and then go into their broker,

347
00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:06.420
going to their wealth manager and you'll go on their mutual funds,

348
00:19:06.421 --> 00:19:09.660
not going to work.
So helping the little guy out,
I know you care.

349
00:19:09.661 --> 00:19:11.790
And I started teasing him.
I said,
come on,
you know,
give me the Jews.

350
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.790
He started laughing.
He goes,
well,
he said,
I could give you something,

351
00:19:14.791 --> 00:19:15.601
wouldn't be perfect.
I said,

352
00:19:15.601 --> 00:19:19.050
I don't want to perfect your worst design will be the best design anybody else

353
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.360
ever come up with.
Right.
So I gotta go.
He said,
well,

354
00:19:21.361 --> 00:19:25.920
we might do any lays out this simple strategy.
And I was vibrating.

355
00:19:25.921 --> 00:19:27.690
I mean I was like vibrating and just,
I could,

356
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.540
I knew what a generosity about what was.
It was unbelievable.

357
00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:34.680
He's never revealed it to anyone in history.
And I ran as fast as I could.

358
00:19:34.681 --> 00:19:36.120
I got in the helicopter,
flew back,

359
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.200
went to the guys at high tower and went to the guys at uh,
at 200 firms.

360
00:19:40.201 --> 00:19:43.860
And I said,
I want you to run these numbers.
Show me the modern period.

361
00:19:43.861 --> 00:19:46.770
The show me the last 30 years.
What really happened with this formula?

362
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.620
Every single year for 30 years.
And what's the overall for the 30 years?

363
00:19:49.621 --> 00:19:51.930
Cause that's,
I look at 30 years,
1984,

364
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:55.710
that's when we finally had cellphones even.
Right.
That's when the world started.

365
00:19:55.711 --> 00:19:58.110
Shift.
Show me 40 years and show me 75 years,

366
00:19:58.111 --> 00:20:02.550
take me back right before the depression even.
Right.
And the guy,

367
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.480
the guy texted me,

368
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.370
I'm in a middle of the night and he never texted me and he says,

369
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.670
have you seen the numbers?
And so I'll never forgot.
I get up,

370
00:20:08.671 --> 00:20:11.370
I call them on the phone.
I said,
what?
No,
I haven't seen him emails them to me.

371
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:17.010
And Ray was right.
85 to 86% of the time.
Every time period.

372
00:20:17.011 --> 00:20:21.670
We look at between 85 and 86 30 years,
40 years,
75 years.
But that meeting,

373
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:22.543
by the way,

374
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:27.510
that's being liberal because the 15% where he lost money the most you have a

375
00:20:27.511 --> 00:20:30.690
loss is 3.95% and 75 years.

376
00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:36.050
And that was 2008 when the market was peak to trough was down 51% the average

377
00:20:36.181 --> 00:20:41.110
loss,
including that was 1.9% so like for example,
you know,
one of his losses,

378
00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:44.610
0.03 I mean really it was break even,
but we called it a lost cause.

379
00:20:44.611 --> 00:20:46.980
It's technically it's a loss.
If you could go to,

380
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.070
and you knew that for 75 years,

381
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:56.130
the strategy you used had been successful 85% of the time and that when you lost

382
00:20:56.441 --> 00:21:00.990
the most loss of 1.9% how much would you bet?
How long would then,
you know,

383
00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.860
continue to gamble and it's not to figure it out.
So I mean,
I mismatched,

384
00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:08.410
I took it,
I took it to some very large institutions.
Then they're like,

385
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.200
I've never seen anything like this.
So a couple of people said to me,

386
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:13.740
you know this,
let's,
let's don't put this in the book.
This is good.

387
00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:16.270
This is a business man.
This is a business.
This is all,

388
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:19.600
this will give you the lowest low volatility,
the highest level of return.

389
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:23.380
It average is just under 10% return.
With that little volatility,

390
00:21:23.381 --> 00:21:26.200
it's mind boggling.
So I said,
you know what,
that's not the spirit.

391
00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:27.670
It was sharing it.
I said,
uh,
you know,

392
00:21:27.671 --> 00:21:30.010
we can do this for people if they want to do any of that option,

393
00:21:30.011 --> 00:21:31.540
but I'm putting the books,
anybody can do it.

394
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.630
And it's in the book right then and there.
And you know,
it's not the only one.

395
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.920
There's strategies for everybody,

396
00:21:35.921 --> 00:21:37.900
but it's one of the more exciting ones that you'll see.

397
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:40.280
<v 1>Is there anything totally up to you,</v>

398
00:21:40.281 --> 00:21:43.850
but just is there anything you can share from what to what he told you about
the,

399
00:21:43.851 --> 00:21:48.280
uh,
the all weather?
Well,
the,
the,
I will just say as a preface there,

400
00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:52.070
there's so much in this book.
Number one,
I've had also people say to me,

401
00:21:52.071 --> 00:21:55.000
for instance,
I'm not going to name any of my close friends,
but,
uh,
you know,
like,

402
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:58.070
yeah,
for our body,
blah,
blah,
blah.
That's fine.
Give me the index card.
And so,

403
00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:01.520
and I give them the next guard and there's,
there's context missing.

404
00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.110
And they also,
it's not just because they,

405
00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:06.950
they can't in some cases do it cause they're missing the detailed,

406
00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:09.770
they won't do it.
So get the book,
do yourself a favor.

407
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.930
<v 2>I'm not holding back on that.</v>

408
00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:14.850
The reason I wouldn't share that is because it'll be out of context.

409
00:22:14.851 --> 00:22:17.910
But even in the book,
I tell people the first chapter I told them this result,

410
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:19.223
even one example I said,

411
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:22.050
I know the first thing you'd want to do is turn back to that section of work.

412
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:25.470
Look and I said you could do it,
but I caution you.
There's a syntax,

413
00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:26.641
there's a sequence,

414
00:22:26.641 --> 00:22:29.700
the dog that judge up the dog and if you will go through the sequence.

415
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.650
It's going to be more of you know that portfolio,

416
00:22:31.651 --> 00:22:35.180
but you don't know truthfully what your risk tolerance is.

417
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:36.930
You don't know truly what your personal goals are.

418
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.140
You don't know what you need to avoid on the fee structure and the tax

419
00:22:40.141 --> 00:22:43.920
structures.
Then that return will be very great for you and more importantly,

420
00:22:43.921 --> 00:22:44.940
you won't go through the psychology.

421
00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.820
It'll make you actually fallen through for awhile,
but if people want to do it,

422
00:22:47.821 --> 00:22:50.970
by the way,
I then went to a high tower,

423
00:22:50.971 --> 00:22:53.790
which is the fifth largest restaurant investment advisory in the United States,

424
00:22:53.791 --> 00:22:57.120
30 billion in assets,
13 fastest growing inc magazine company,

425
00:22:57.121 --> 00:23:01.050
fastest growing company,
mazing Elliot to CEO blown away by this man.

426
00:23:01.051 --> 00:23:02.730
I did an interview with them and I left there going,

427
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:08.610
this man is committed to total transparency.
This man blows out all those fees,

428
00:23:08.611 --> 00:23:12.750
all this to say it in the nicest way possible,
screwing over.

429
00:23:12.751 --> 00:23:16.710
That happens to most clients.
He eliminates that.
He's a former litigator.

430
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.760
He's got a moral code that's pretty intense.
How Optum?
As I came back,

431
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:23.490
I called him up and said,
let's meet again,
a met again,
and I said,
you know,

432
00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.510
I want to challenge you.
I said,
how about you do this for everybody else?

433
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:28.380
If we were talking about,
I said,

434
00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:31.350
how about for the average man that really needs it?
So when you're talking about,

435
00:23:31.351 --> 00:23:33.570
I said,
bring that ultra wealthy advice to them.

436
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.140
Show them on a small scale how they they can do what you're ultra wealthy client

437
00:23:37.141 --> 00:23:38.630
does.
He goes,
Tony,
you can't make money doing it.
I said,

438
00:23:38.631 --> 00:23:40.800
you don't need to make money doing it and I'm doing a book.

439
00:23:40.801 --> 00:23:41.790
I'm not making money doing it.
I said,

440
00:23:41.791 --> 00:23:43.740
a part of our life has to be for something more,
and I said,

441
00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:45.790
I know that's what you're about.
I said,
well,

442
00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:47.870
I'm not talking about putting your business at risk.
I said,

443
00:23:47.871 --> 00:23:51.080
let's use technology technology with lied people,
the balance.

444
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.150
And so we built together a site.

445
00:23:53.151 --> 00:23:55.670
I put them together with this group called stronghold,
which is brilliant.

446
00:23:55.671 --> 00:23:59.150
They've been managing my money from me for a plot seven years.
Aga goofy.

447
00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:02.810
He's actually the person that Charles Swab put on the cover of most magazines

448
00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:07.110
the last year as kind of the face of the 10,000,
you know,

449
00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:08.120
restroom investment advisory,

450
00:24:08.121 --> 00:24:11.300
fiduciary is around the world and around the country.
And uh,

451
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:12.230
the two of them got together,

452
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.960
created this site and it's kind of like check your broker.

453
00:24:13.961 --> 00:24:18.290
So now you can go online and you can put in all your accounts and aggregate
them.

454
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:19.430
It's a patented technology.

455
00:24:19.431 --> 00:24:23.510
You get to see a what your real costs are on everything,
all in one picture.

456
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:27.000
So there's no bs versus what you could have the same investments for.
Right.

457
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.510
It's like why would I pay more seconding it does,

458
00:24:29.511 --> 00:24:32.540
it shows you what your real returns have been combined with first of what you

459
00:24:32.541 --> 00:24:34.460
think they are.
And third,

460
00:24:34.461 --> 00:24:36.860
it shows you what your volatility levels will be in the amount of risk you're

461
00:24:36.861 --> 00:24:39.050
taking.
So,
you know,
and then fourthly,

462
00:24:39.051 --> 00:24:41.300
it does a comparison to that versus other portfolios,

463
00:24:41.301 --> 00:24:44.090
including the wind design by Great Dahlia.
And you can go,
wow,

464
00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:45.050
do I want to do this?
If,

465
00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:49.160
if you're a person like half the u s less than 25,000 festival assets,

466
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:52.010
you get to do the whole thing for free.
It's given to you,
you go do it.

467
00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.490
If you are not,
you have more of a,
you can still do it for free.

468
00:24:54.491 --> 00:24:56.360
He can do it yourself.
Or you can push a button and say,

469
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.820
I like you to become a registered investment advisor and somebody can do it.

470
00:24:58.821 --> 00:25:01.100
So I got him to do it saying most of the people,

471
00:25:01.101 --> 00:25:04.160
you're never going to see anything from wealthy people started not wealthy.

472
00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.740
Right?
Right.
And so it's really cool.
It's one of those few,

473
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.690
according to the sounds,
when wins,
right?

474
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:12.320
These guys are adding value or got him to do it and now they're proud of it and

475
00:25:12.321 --> 00:25:15.800
excited about it.
So it's a cool thing.
So one answer,
quiz URL.

476
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:21.260
The URL is a stronghold.
financial.com I've got to double check,

477
00:25:21.261 --> 00:25:24.140
but I'm pretty sure that's it.
We'll double check that.
You got

478
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:29.750
to answer my question.
I don't want to cut you off.
Oh,
which one?
That

479
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.393
one,

480
00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:35.030
and then you highlight a couple of things and you don't answer your question.

481
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.010
I said,
I'm not going to,
I want to cover here because even the book,

482
00:25:37.011 --> 00:25:38.690
I don't feel that you get there won't mean anything to you.

483
00:25:38.691 --> 00:25:39.650
I'm not holding anything back.

484
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:41.720
You going to the bookstore and opened up and read it and not painting the,

485
00:25:41.721 --> 00:25:44.780
I don't give a shit,
but I think you'd be doing yourself a disservice.

486
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:48.110
Will you really want to do is take yourself to the process so that when you get

487
00:25:48.111 --> 00:25:52.910
to that point you can decide,
do I want that value to be 20% of what I do?

488
00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:57.560
5% 10% none 50 because there are many different strategies in the book and

489
00:25:57.561 --> 00:25:59.000
including,
as you said,
David Swinson,

490
00:25:59.001 --> 00:26:02.240
David Swenson is the most successful institutional investor of all time from

491
00:26:02.241 --> 00:26:04.010
Yale.
He went from 1 billion,

492
00:26:04.011 --> 00:26:08.570
took their monies from 1 billion to 23.9 billion,
24 billion.

493
00:26:08.571 --> 00:26:11.120
Now in two decades,
he's a rock star,

494
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.480
a nicest human beings you'll ever meet in your life and doesn't get paid.

495
00:26:14.481 --> 00:26:17.630
One 10th the rest of these guys,
it's his dedication to Yale with why he's there.

496
00:26:17.631 --> 00:26:20.540
I mean,
he could leave there and be a totally different place.
We had cancer.

497
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:22.640
The man said,
listen,
I'm not going anywhere.

498
00:26:22.641 --> 00:26:25.880
This is my bucket list is to be here and to continue to serve at Yale.

499
00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.580
A man of such unbelievable integrity,

500
00:26:28.581 --> 00:26:32.000
and he gave me his exact portfolio and send the book also and he actually gets a

501
00:26:32.001 --> 00:26:34.340
higher return.
To give you an idea of that,
ray does,

502
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:36.890
but you have to go through a hell of a lot more volatility obviously,

503
00:26:36.891 --> 00:26:39.500
so that's why your risk,
you see what you got to know what your real,

504
00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:43.260
what you think your risk reward is in your mindset versus what it really is.

505
00:26:43.261 --> 00:26:44.010
You'll know when you go to

506
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.760
<v 1>the book.
If I can make a request.
Yes.</v>

507
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.620
I would love for you to interview the guy who hired Swenson for Yale because

508
00:26:49.621 --> 00:26:52.420
talk about the best hire of all the time.
No kidding.

509
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:57.220
I mean just the psychological profile and the guys.
So unique.
Yeah.
Uh,
the,

510
00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:00.810
so a couple of things I'd love to,
to just underscore for folks.
The first is,

511
00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:03.270
and again this is pulling stuff from the book.

512
00:27:03.271 --> 00:27:04.260
I'm going to paraphrase some of it,

513
00:27:04.261 --> 00:27:09.261
but I think it was Daleo who said something along the lines of uh,

514
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:14.380
like losers react,
winners anticipate.
But that's okay.
I'll give it to rebuild it

515
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:21.150
as a compliment.
No,
but the point being that the,
uh,

516
00:27:21.151 --> 00:27:23.310
and I guess Mark Twain quote is also in there,

517
00:27:23.311 --> 00:27:25.860
which was what history doesn't repeat itself,
but it rhymes.

518
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.920
So there are going to be crashes,

519
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:33.950
there are going to be black swan events and you want to have a plan in place for

520
00:27:34.351 --> 00:27:35.184
when that happens.

521
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.520
And the more you can automate your many of your financial decisions,

522
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.360
you know,
know when to hold them.

523
00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:45.570
No one to fold them and actually have a plan going in.

524
00:27:45.571 --> 00:27:47.760
So if you buy something and have no plan for selling it,

525
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:52.560
you're going to be subject to sort of impulse reactions that will cause you to

526
00:27:52.561 --> 00:27:56.490
do with the vast majority of people do they,
they buy high and they sell low.

527
00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.740
So w what is in this,

528
00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.340
what is what we're talking about when we talk about asset allocation among other

529
00:28:02.341 --> 00:28:02.581
things,

530
00:28:02.581 --> 00:28:07.581
just to sort of try to try to distill it for people as a concept is that you

531
00:28:08.671 --> 00:28:13.500
have uncorrelated or inversely correlated buckets so that if,

532
00:28:13.501 --> 00:28:13.890
if,

533
00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:18.540
if one portion of your investments goes down because of inflation deflation,

534
00:28:18.541 --> 00:28:19.440
fill in the blank.

535
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.940
There are others that go up which mitigate your risk and what you notice.

536
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.240
And I live in Silicon Valley,
I'm very involved with tech.
That's,

537
00:28:27.241 --> 00:28:30.690
that's sort of been my sandbox for the last,
uh,
you know,

538
00:28:30.691 --> 00:28:34.590
close to 10 years I guess.
And what you notice about the vet.
Okay,

539
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:35.970
95%.

540
00:28:35.971 --> 00:28:40.890
So talk about venture capital is very similar to mutual funds.
So it's,

541
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.660
the vast majority are horrible as a,
as a class,
they're terrible.

542
00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:50.330
However,
if you've,
if you pick the UNICORNS and you use the same term,
there are,

543
00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:53.970
yeah,
there are a handful who are very,
very consistent.

544
00:28:53.971 --> 00:28:55.020
And so what I've tried to do,

545
00:28:55.021 --> 00:29:00.021
just like you did with a lot of these hedge fund managers is a look at what's

546
00:29:00.471 --> 00:29:05.070
separates them and what separates them is you have the vast majority of tech

547
00:29:05.071 --> 00:29:09.090
investors who think a high risk,
high return.

548
00:29:09.091 --> 00:29:10.590
I've got a swing for the fences.

549
00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:13.860
I'll be okay as long as a third of my startups lose money,

550
00:29:13.861 --> 00:29:18.580
a third break even and a third make money does.
Yeah,
it does.

551
00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.070
It doesn't work that way.
Whereas whereas,

552
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.420
whereas the guys who are really good realize that there is a power law

553
00:29:24.421 --> 00:29:25.254
distribution,

554
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:29.910
one or two of their investments are going to make up for all of the losses and

555
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:34.020
the very top of the top,
even though they don't talk about it publicly,

556
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.490
if they have a lot of their personal money at play have thought a lot about

557
00:29:38.491 --> 00:29:42.820
asset allocation.
So if they're heavily vested in tech and it might have an IPO,

558
00:29:42.821 --> 00:29:44.530
blah,
blah,
blah,
they have,
uh,

559
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:48.580
they have an entire basket of shorts on the Nasdaq or whatever it might be.

560
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.030
So that by the way,
it's not always high risk,
high reward.

561
00:29:52.031 --> 00:29:53.380
If they're tech goes to hell,

562
00:29:53.381 --> 00:29:56.500
they have enough money that is betting it's going to go to hell,

563
00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:59.590
that they don't lose a lot of money if at all.
Or maybe they even make money.

564
00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:03.240
That's absolutely true.
And uh,
so I think the,
um,

565
00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.700
<v 2>it's a way of doing it that you mentioned,
I think you were,</v>

566
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.170
may have been going this direction.
Maybe I'm wrong,
but ray down,

567
00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:12.120
you actually said something in there that stuck with me brutally.
He said,

568
00:30:12.121 --> 00:30:16.230
I don't care what it is that you think you're great at investing in or you like

569
00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:19.710
most people invest in what they like real estate or stocks or bonds or what they

570
00:30:19.711 --> 00:30:23.220
think they're good at or what they were raised with.
He said,

571
00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:24.870
whatever asset class you invest in,

572
00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:30.030
I promise you in your lifetime it will drop no less than 50 or more likely 70%

573
00:30:30.031 --> 00:30:30.864
at some point.

574
00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:35.910
And he said that is why you absolutely must diversify cause you were saying,

575
00:30:35.911 --> 00:30:37.740
but I could make so much more than this side.
You know,

576
00:30:37.741 --> 00:30:40.080
I've had people throughout the years,
I,
I teach this pocket theory.

577
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:42.960
This idea that if you want to do is make asset allocation simple.

578
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.750
That sounds like such a big word.
It's just buckets.

579
00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:47.670
Some of my money is going to go into secure bucket.

580
00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:52.050
That bucket is like a church steeple.
I'm going to,
it's not going away.

581
00:30:52.051 --> 00:30:56.670
It's very secure type investments.
It's upside is not gigantic in terms of speed,

582
00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:00.390
but you know what the compounding process,
if you give it enough time,

583
00:31:00.391 --> 00:31:04.200
those low returns are giant returns still,
but you're not gonna lose.

584
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:07.440
And then there's this thing called where most people call it growth bucket.

585
00:31:07.441 --> 00:31:10.590
I call risk growth because it's really risk first.
And Oh man,

586
00:31:10.591 --> 00:31:13.020
I'm taking bigger risks for potentially greater rewards.

587
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.180
And now the question is how do I balance these?

588
00:31:15.181 --> 00:31:19.920
Am I 604050508020 and that's design really by three things.

589
00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:24.810
Number one,
what your real risk tolerance is.
Not what you think it is.
I do.

590
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.890
I do these wealth mastery programs in a few years and invariably I'll do some

591
00:31:28.891 --> 00:31:31.560
crazy thing.
Like I'll say everything up,
make change.
They look at me,

592
00:31:31.561 --> 00:31:34.380
go make change.
And they start reaching their pockets and making change.

593
00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.060
That's all.
Somebody to pull out,

594
00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:39.770
five bucks and 10 bucks of point $100 and they'll,

595
00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.120
some would come up and they'll take it and give him five bucks and they're like,

596
00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:43.740
you know,
they don't know how to react.

597
00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.470
So this goes on for three or four minutes of music going on and go,
okay,

598
00:31:46.471 --> 00:31:48.780
stop writes it down.
And then they go on like I'm talking about something else.

599
00:31:48.781 --> 00:31:52.800
And then invariably somebody like,
Hey,
wait a second,
how I want my,

600
00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:56.490
I want my hundred dollars back because what are you talking about?
He said,

601
00:31:56.491 --> 00:31:58.790
I don't mind to dollars back.
The game's over.
I said,
what'd you do?

602
00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.000
You think the game was over?
I think the game had ever gone over right,

603
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:06.570
and who said it was your $100 right?
And it's like it takes a while,
but finally,

604
00:32:06.571 --> 00:32:07.081
finally get,

605
00:32:07.081 --> 00:32:10.650
you know I'm stressed about $100 what do you think's going to happen when you

606
00:32:10.651 --> 00:32:13.830
lose a million or half a million or a hundred thousand or 10 grand?

607
00:32:13.831 --> 00:32:15.660
I mean your risk tolerance is not we think it is.

608
00:32:15.661 --> 00:32:17.790
So when you find out what he was talking nonsense and we got great ways to do

609
00:32:17.791 --> 00:32:21.600
that in the book and then you'd figure out really how much time do you have?

610
00:32:21.601 --> 00:32:22.081
If you're younger,

611
00:32:22.081 --> 00:32:24.630
you've got more time to make mistakes and so you can take bigger risks.

612
00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:28.230
You know you've got a timeline on your partners and then the next piece is how

613
00:32:28.231 --> 00:32:30.480
much is your cashflow?
What's that?
What's going to be the rifle?

614
00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.840
If you look at those three things now you can assign how much goes in my secure

615
00:32:33.841 --> 00:32:36.270
bucket,
how much goes my growth,
and if you don't make that decision,

616
00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:38.970
it's the most important investment decision of your life according everybody.

617
00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:41.630
I like what percentage secure,
what percentage growth and risk.

618
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.610
Then when things come up,

619
00:32:43.611 --> 00:32:46.820
you're always going to go for the growth risk since look so sexy and exciting.

620
00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.250
And I can't tell you how many people over the years have done this.

621
00:32:49.251 --> 00:32:49.701
They're telling me,

622
00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:53.390
why would I put money over here when I've got this real estate I'm making 120%.

623
00:32:53.391 --> 00:32:54.940
I have a friend that dope,
uh,

624
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:59.780
some of the big condos in Vegas back in the boom time and he,

625
00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:02.270
he actually went to my programs,
sold the business.

626
00:33:02.271 --> 00:33:05.560
He had made $200 million invested in these condos,

627
00:33:05.561 --> 00:33:09.620
started building the panorama towers in places that nature and he was up to like

628
00:33:09.621 --> 00:33:11.390
three quarters of a billion.
I kept saying to him,
dude,

629
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:14.780
take some of your growth money and put it in the secure bucket,
right?

630
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:17.120
How many times I told you this goes tone.
I love you.

631
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:21.230
I made $200 million cause you,
but now you know,
I'm really like when I touch,

632
00:33:21.231 --> 00:33:23.660
goes to gold and listened to his ego and I'm going,
I love your brother,

633
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:25.730
but I said,
you want me time to have this conversation?

634
00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:30.550
And then guess what happens in 2008 how much you think you about,

635
00:33:30.551 --> 00:33:34.220
he was worth three quarters of $1 billion.
He grown that rapidly.

636
00:33:34.221 --> 00:33:37.220
And those short ears,
what do you think happened to his net worth?

637
00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.460
<v 1>Oh,
I'm guessing it went down according to the Ray Dalio prediction.</v>

638
00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:45.440
<v 2>How about minus 400 million.
He didn't just lose what he had.</v>

639
00:33:45.441 --> 00:33:49.670
He lost everything had and beyond.
So then he's trying to negotiate and leverage,

640
00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.620
leveraged out,
wiped themselves out.

641
00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:55.160
So most people don't put enough from the security bucket is the lesson.

642
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:56.420
And a guy like Dow,

643
00:33:56.421 --> 00:33:59.090
you'll provide you a strategy that's got great sustainability,

644
00:33:59.091 --> 00:34:00.320
but there are many approaches in the book,

645
00:34:00.321 --> 00:34:02.810
but you do have to decide how much to secure,
how much is growth.

646
00:34:02.811 --> 00:34:03.890
And I show you how to do that in the book.

647
00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:07.080
<v 1>And I would emphasize at least,
uh,
I'd be curious to hear your thoughts,
Tony.</v>

648
00:34:07.081 --> 00:34:09.210
But for me,
it took me a long time to think,

649
00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.600
to realize what investing represents for me,

650
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.810
and it's not maximizing return.

651
00:34:15.811 --> 00:34:20.810
It's maximizing quality of life and there's a big difference.
Uh,

652
00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:23.370
and they did it for me at least.
I've,
I've,

653
00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:27.580
I've very kind of barbell strategy where I have super,
super safe,

654
00:34:27.581 --> 00:34:31.820
safe stuff and then the startup stuff,
but I need to modify that.

655
00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:36.220
I want to modify that because it's not currently yeah.
All seasons at all.

656
00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:40.770
And,
uh,
the,
um,
so,
so for people out there,

657
00:34:40.771 --> 00:34:43.440
I think who might say,
you know,
I don't want to think about it.

658
00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:48.150
I would just emphasize that you're making decisions every day about where you

659
00:34:48.151 --> 00:34:51.480
allocate your time,
your money,
your resources.

660
00:34:51.481 --> 00:34:53.550
So whether or not you want to call yourself an investor,

661
00:34:53.551 --> 00:34:58.230
you are an investor group.
And if you make no decision,
that's also a decision.
Uh,

662
00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:00.870
so it's,
it's important to become literally,

663
00:35:00.871 --> 00:35:03.810
I think with a lot of these basic concepts.
There's,
which is not difficult.

664
00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:08.210
<v 2>Do people need to remember that everybody's a financial trader,</v>

665
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:12.180
but most people are making a bad trade because a trading time for money.
Yeah.

666
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:14.810
Worst trade of your life because you can't get more time.
We all know it.

667
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.640
So what this book will do,

668
00:35:16.641 --> 00:35:20.270
if you're willing to just give yourself a chapter a day for a month or go crazy

669
00:35:20.271 --> 00:35:21.104
on a weekend,

670
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:25.700
you'll go from maybe not even knowing what these terms sound so complex to being

671
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:27.800
juiced,
cause you'll be an insider.

672
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:30.500
You will look at the world in a totally different way.
You'll go,

673
00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.320
that is the biggest rip off on earth that will ever happen to me.

674
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:34.910
That is where I want to go.

675
00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:37.560
And you'll make some decisions and it's not an everyday thing.

676
00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.770
Literally you might do rebalancing once a year for 15 minutes.
I mean,

677
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:45.630
unless you're going to be a trader every day,
this shouldn't dominate your life.

678
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:46.200
But you,

679
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.170
when did you give yourself the initial education about one of the most important

680
00:35:49.171 --> 00:35:49.621
areas?
Your Life?

681
00:35:49.621 --> 00:35:52.320
There's only a few areas that really impact the quality of your life,
your body,

682
00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:56.580
your emotions,
your relationships,
your finances,
your career,
your business,

683
00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:59.550
the spiritual side of your life and how you use your time.

684
00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:03.360
About a half dozen or so,
maybe seven areas that really affect you.

685
00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:06.180
But most people major in minor things,
they know so much more about shit.

686
00:36:06.181 --> 00:36:07.230
That doesn't matter.

687
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:12.420
I'm saying that people give yourself the gift of just a short burst of time so

688
00:36:12.421 --> 00:36:15.900
that you can truly look at life and be good at this area.

689
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:17.890
And if you want something to do at four,
you can do that.

690
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:21.980
<v 1>At least then you lead them.
You're not being led by them.
Right.
No,
definitely.</v>

691
00:36:21.981 --> 00:36:23.410
And I think that,
uh,
you know,

692
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:27.530
just like one of the things that you sort of changed my world and startup

693
00:36:27.531 --> 00:36:28.700
investing was,
you know,

694
00:36:28.701 --> 00:36:31.520
any company you invest in should be able to return the fund just as like a

695
00:36:31.521 --> 00:36:36.220
general United money that you're investing over x number of years.
And uh,

696
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:39.170
just like the sort of $1 to $5.
Yeah.

697
00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:44.000
Principal with Tutor Jones and they're there a couple of pithy,

698
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.440
uh,
heuristics,

699
00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:50.530
rules of thumb that I think will change how you view not just money or stocks,

700
00:36:50.931 --> 00:36:53.910
but the world in general,
such as assume in,

701
00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:58.070
in the Daleo case that you know,
your favorite area,

702
00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:01.970
you're kind of investment bucket is going to decrease by at least 50% in the

703
00:37:01.971 --> 00:37:05.300
next x period of time.
77 [inaudible] 78 even better

704
00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:12.080
and plan accordingly.
And uh,
I think that um,

705
00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:13.870
it's,
yeah,
it's been a very,

706
00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:17.360
very fun process to read this and also to connect with you over it.
Uh,

707
00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:22.250
let me ask if I could,
cause I know you've got,
you've got a lot planned and uh,

708
00:37:22.251 --> 00:37:24.850
I also want to finish up the last few interviews in the,

709
00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:28.310
in the book reading the ones that you did.
Uh,
I'm curious if there are any,

710
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:32.540
any particular funny stories or what was the funniest story or interaction you

711
00:37:32.541 --> 00:37:35.480
had while researching and writing this book that comes to me?

712
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:39.050
<v 2>Well,
I think the show,
one of I already,
I think it's funny now,</v>

713
00:37:39.051 --> 00:37:43.220
it wasn't so funny in the moment is walking to Carl Icahn's office,
so excited,

714
00:37:43.221 --> 00:37:45.860
so prepared,
ready to rip open.
Cause this guy,

715
00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.780
he's got the greatest returns of anybody out there.

716
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.290
Very few people know that Kiplinger did the first review that really showed all

717
00:37:51.291 --> 00:37:51.711
the numbers.

718
00:37:51.711 --> 00:37:56.711
I mean if you'd invested him in 1968 you'd have a 31% compounded return within

719
00:37:57.291 --> 00:38:00.590
his firm versus at buffets him,
you'd have a 20% return.

720
00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:02.720
People think of buffet is the ultimate guy.

721
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:04.310
So I got to go to these facts figures.

722
00:38:04.311 --> 00:38:09.311
I'm excited to have him literally throwing my video crew out the door and then

723
00:38:09.321 --> 00:38:10.820
telling me no audio and I'm like,

724
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.220
how the hell am I going to keep up with this guy?
Comes with the notes.

725
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:17.750
So that'd be one.
A fun moment was introducing Carl Icahn to Jack Bogle.

726
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:20.180
They didn't know each other and they're fans of each other.

727
00:38:20.181 --> 00:38:24.650
So it's like I came from being an outsider to now introducing them the most of

728
00:38:24.651 --> 00:38:27.710
the time that these guys wasn't as much as funny as it was fascinating.

729
00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:31.100
It was just seeing the level of the,

730
00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:33.760
they played the games with a great poker player.
You know,

731
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:37.120
they know the psychology,
they know the numbers,

732
00:38:37.121 --> 00:38:40.660
they know the probability and you just realize why most people are never going

733
00:38:40.661 --> 00:38:42.040
to win because you know,

734
00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:44.500
they're not going to win gold medals against these guys that are playing this

735
00:38:44.501 --> 00:38:46.360
game day and night,
night and day,
you know,
so,

736
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.750
and some of that is a new meat just because Paul has been my dearest friend for,

737
00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:52.790
you know,
21 years now.
Um,
but it's,

738
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:57.460
it's fascinating to see that in every,
in every industry,
in every sport,

739
00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:01.720
there are a few players that play at the highest level and they have one thing

740
00:39:01.721 --> 00:39:04.990
in common above all else hunger.
But it's an unquenchable hunger.

741
00:39:04.991 --> 00:39:07.330
You have that hunger.
I see that in you.
It's why I'm a fan of your work.

742
00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.100
It's like you're going to keep finding the answers no matter what answer you
got.

743
00:39:10.101 --> 00:39:13.810
Want to know more and every one of these people has that and it's fun to be

744
00:39:13.811 --> 00:39:17.110
around them because there's energy in every one of these people.

745
00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.040
They have different styles,

746
00:39:18.041 --> 00:39:20.650
but there's an energy and that energy is driven by that desire,

747
00:39:20.651 --> 00:39:21.520
that hunger to know more.

748
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.910
<v 1>And the other observation that was reinforced by,</v>

749
00:39:25.911 --> 00:39:30.800
by reading the book was that they also,
they have principals,

750
00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:35.830
they have operating systems that they use and whether you are trying to lose

751
00:39:36.741 --> 00:39:40.820
weight,
trying to quit smoking,
trying to improve your investment returns,

752
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:45.560
you can insure against your lesser instincts by having a system,

753
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:51.030
putting systems in place so that when you have the impulses that are going to

754
00:39:51.141 --> 00:39:54.380
lead deer destruction or eating a cupcake,
when you should need it,

755
00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:56.000
that you can mitigate against that.

756
00:39:56.030 --> 00:40:00.110
And it's possible you can set these things up in advance.
Uh,
I would love to,

757
00:40:00.111 --> 00:40:04.730
before we wrap up,
just ask a couple of rapid fire questions.
Go for it.
Okay.
Uh,

758
00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:08.720
when you think of the word successful,
who's the first person that comes to mind?

759
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:10.543
Gosh,

760
00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:13.340
<v 2>I like Richard Branson or know why that's first thing pops in my head when you</v>

761
00:40:13.341 --> 00:40:16.520
said that.
All the,
because I think he lives so passionately.

762
00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:19.700
He lives life on his terms.
There's no bullshit with him.

763
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:22.220
I was having a good time.
It was close to his family,

764
00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:27.140
lives on an island like I do.
I cause I like it,
but he's an extra,

765
00:40:27.141 --> 00:40:31.070
any extraordinary leverage and very conscious man about society and what to do.

766
00:40:31.071 --> 00:40:32.660
He's elders program and things like that.

767
00:40:32.661 --> 00:40:35.750
He's very socially conscious and yet still has a great time.

768
00:40:35.751 --> 00:40:37.820
So you'll be one of the first people.
I think it probably.

769
00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.550
<v 1>Uh,
what have you changed your mind about over the years?</v>

770
00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:44.760
Any positions you've taken that you've,
that you've reversed since?

771
00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:47.620
<v 2>Uh,
you don't have to be perfect in everything you do,</v>

772
00:40:47.621 --> 00:40:51.030
including not eating anything enjoyable.
Trying to be,

773
00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:55.450
if they were my right foot battalion,
uh,
Gosh,
you know,
over the years there's,

774
00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:56.680
you're always updating.
I mean,

775
00:40:56.681 --> 00:40:59.920
I don't look at it as changing as much as updating and informing myself,

776
00:40:59.921 --> 00:41:01.420
you know,
if you thought of it is changing,

777
00:41:01.421 --> 00:41:04.600
I think you'd find resistance within your own consciousness,

778
00:41:04.601 --> 00:41:07.420
your own identity and your identity plays such a strong wall,

779
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:09.400
but it need to be consistent with what you believe.

780
00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:11.710
And that's why the political system is so messed up.
You know,

781
00:41:11.711 --> 00:41:14.380
somebody could actually grow and they're seen as inconsistent.

782
00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:19.660
It makes the political system not grow.
It makes us system walked in place.
Um,

783
00:41:19.661 --> 00:41:22.660
so I don't look,
think there's anything that comes to mind just real directly,

784
00:41:22.661 --> 00:41:23.320
but I think it's,

785
00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.020
there's a constant upgrading and sometimes it's those two meters,

786
00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:28.880
two millimeter upgrades that provide the biggest impact.
Yeah.

787
00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:34.340
<v 1>A side note for folks,
it's also common among the venture capitalists investors.</v>

788
00:41:34.341 --> 00:41:38.000
Marc Andreessen,
who created the graphical web browser.
Uh,

789
00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:41.750
one of his mottoes for Andreessen Horowitz is strong opinions,
weakly held.

790
00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:45.890
So He's,
he's,
he's ready to be corrected or update as you mentioned.

791
00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.790
Uh,
what would people be surprised to know about you?

792
00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:55.380
<v 2>Oh Gosh,
that was my wife.
That question.
Um,</v>

793
00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:58.840
I don't know.
Some people would not be surprised at all people at my events.

794
00:41:58.841 --> 00:42:00.610
And I'm a,
I'm a love bug.
I'm going to kind of guide that.

795
00:42:00.611 --> 00:42:04.280
I can be brought to tears by seeing someone do the right thing just and yet I'm,

796
00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:06.400
you know,
I'll,
I'll run through that wall,

797
00:42:06.401 --> 00:42:10.180
shake the building with 10,000 people in it.
Um,
I'm a softie.
Really,

798
00:42:10.181 --> 00:42:12.540
truly underneath it all.
That's what drives all this at me.
Okay.

799
00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:14.680
I love to see people lit up.
I'd love to see people happy.

800
00:42:14.681 --> 00:42:15.880
I love to see people freed.

801
00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:19.560
<v 1>So I'm going to ask a,
an unusual one given that answer,
uh,</v>

802
00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:23.890
what's the first face that comes to mind when you think punchable lunchable?

803
00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:27.950
<v 2>Oh Gosh.
Well,
I had a neutrally meeting with President Obama,</v>

804
00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:35.510
actually had shingles.
It was a,
I was invited by Mark Benioff to calm,

805
00:42:35.511 --> 00:42:38.450
it was for,
I don't know,
15 of the,
you know,
billionaires,

806
00:42:38.451 --> 00:42:39.470
they're in silicon valley.

807
00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:44.270
That was s in San Jose and it was for the president and it was before the second

808
00:42:44.271 --> 00:42:47.930
election,
his reelection and a,
I voted for the president,
you know,

809
00:42:47.931 --> 00:42:49.730
so I'm a bit of fan of the president,

810
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.470
but I was getting more and more frustrated by watching the style of politics,

811
00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:56.990
which was,
you know,
creating greater and greater division.

812
00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:01.910
And it seemed to me a great level inaccuracy in the promises are being made that

813
00:43:01.911 --> 00:43:05.300
very hard not to see.
And at that time it was the whole thing.

814
00:43:05.301 --> 00:43:08.240
We're going to raise taxes on the rich and that's going to balance the budget.

815
00:43:08.241 --> 00:43:09.620
And you know,
I've done the numbers,

816
00:43:09.621 --> 00:43:11.850
I did a whole video on it shows you can kill every rich person,

817
00:43:11.851 --> 00:43:15.290
the United States and take all their money and take all the corporations and all

818
00:43:15.291 --> 00:43:16.790
the advertising from the Superbowl.
I mean,

819
00:43:16.791 --> 00:43:19.520
I'd do this whole long Gig that came from some statistics,

820
00:43:19.521 --> 00:43:21.350
another man put together for me,
but I did it together.

821
00:43:21.351 --> 00:43:24.080
And you can't cover the budget for one year and then what do you do next year?

822
00:43:24.081 --> 00:43:27.410
Right.
Um,
and so I said to mark,
I said,
listen,

823
00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:31.100
I support the president.
Um,
but I said,
honestly,
I don't know.

824
00:43:31.101 --> 00:43:34.520
I can support the other side,
but I don't know that I,
I'm a guy to be there.

825
00:43:34.521 --> 00:43:36.800
I don't know if I'm a fan and mark and I said,
mark,

826
00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:40.580
you and I are so aligned on so much,
but you know,
the way in which,

827
00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:44.330
you know how Simpson Bowles was this close and he let it pass.

828
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:49.100
We have both sides willing to make some tough decisions is beyond me.
That just,

829
00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.170
it lacks the leadership that fundamentally the president had.

830
00:43:52.171 --> 00:43:54.920
States in my mind has to have it.
That's my judgment.
I'm just a person.

831
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:59.180
But it's like I don't understand it was taking the easy route is not something

832
00:43:59.181 --> 00:44:03.170
that's going to sustain or grow this economy longterm.
And,
and I said,
Ann,

833
00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:05.060
and using the political capital,

834
00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:08.080
even though I'm supportive healthcare using that healthcare,

835
00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:11.660
we're half the country is upset about it and pushing it down their throat and

836
00:44:11.661 --> 00:44:13.460
trying to say it's going to cost less money.
I mean,

837
00:44:13.461 --> 00:44:15.830
it's just like there's certain things,
so much as I agree with you,

838
00:44:15.831 --> 00:44:19.550
I agree with you.
And Mark is the second largest fundraiser for the president.

839
00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:22.220
So I said,
well then how the hell he raised all the money.
He goes,

840
00:44:22.221 --> 00:44:25.400
well cause I feel strong about him and the other guy.
And he said,

841
00:44:25.401 --> 00:44:27.650
and you and I are aligned with them on so many other things about you know,

842
00:44:27.651 --> 00:44:31.100
the environment and you know,
you know people's right to marriage regardless,

843
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:34.260
their sexual preference.
And I said,
of course we are.
So he said,
come,

844
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:37.740
come and be there.
I said,
I said,
you know me,
I'm totally respectful,

845
00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:42.120
but I'm honest.
He goes,
come.
He says,
I'll sit,
you're right next to the president.

846
00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.780
He said,
well,
have a great conversation.
So I went to this,

847
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:47.610
to this meeting and it was crazy.

848
00:44:47.611 --> 00:44:49.020
I mean I've worked in so many presidents over the years,

849
00:44:49.021 --> 00:44:51.770
but I'm not going to bottle.
And it's downtown San Jose.

850
00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:55.530
If they locked everybody in their buildings and literally,
you know,

851
00:44:55.531 --> 00:44:56.820
it looked like one of those movies,
you know,

852
00:44:56.821 --> 00:44:59.280
when everybody's died and there's nothing left.
But the buildings,
it was,

853
00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:02.490
it was the wildest thing for several blocks.
It took us up in this room,

854
00:45:02.491 --> 00:45:05.310
there was nobody else,
seniors,
these 16 people,

855
00:45:05.311 --> 00:45:10.020
many of which you know from Silicon Valley.
And,
and I listened and present,

856
00:45:10.021 --> 00:45:12.550
came in and it was really wonderful.
And he shared,
you know,

857
00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.670
some comments and said,
I'm not here to give a speech.
I'm here.

858
00:45:14.671 --> 00:45:17.190
You guys had built the biggest companies in the world.
I'm thinking,
not me,

859
00:45:17.191 --> 00:45:20.520
I don't fit that category.
And so I was going to say anything and he said,

860
00:45:20.521 --> 00:45:23.880
but I really want to hear from you guys.
So mark turns to him and says,
well,

861
00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:28.020
are you ready for some real give and take spreads me?
He said,
yeah.
He goes,
okay,

862
00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:32.900
who wants to go first?
And he pointed straight at me.
That's a friends and boy,

863
00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:38.910
I said,
Mr President,
I said,
I've paused.
I literally pause it.
I shouldn't do this.

864
00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.160
I'm not here.
And they won't pay a quarter million bucks to be here.

865
00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:44.300
I actually have never done it where I went.
Thousand 1000 xe.

866
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:47.310
If somebody else is going to say something we have,
I said,
okay.

867
00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:50.760
So when Mr President,
I said,
I said,
I really want,
you know,
I voted for you.

868
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:54.060
I know you've had a tremendous integrity.
I share the same values you do,

869
00:45:54.061 --> 00:45:59.010
I believe.
But I said,
I'm really confused about two things.
Number one,

870
00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:03.240
how you think you'll be able to have a,
you know,

871
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:08.270
a second four year run and get anything done when you have taken the other side

872
00:46:09.031 --> 00:46:12.180
and demonized unto a point that they're never going to work with you.

873
00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.810
And my second question,
if I ever get one would be,

874
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:20.130
why didn't you support Simpson Bowles?
Right?
I said,
it was right there.

875
00:46:20.131 --> 00:46:23.640
It needed to be done.
And He,
you know,
he's long pause.
And he said,
well,

876
00:46:23.641 --> 00:46:27.420
those are fair questions.
And he said,
uh,
he is the,
first of all,

877
00:46:27.421 --> 00:46:29.700
I don't think I've ever demonized the other party ever.

878
00:46:29.701 --> 00:46:33.450
And I just sat there and watched him saying,
I was like,
are you kidding me?

879
00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:36.450
I mean,
I'm not a Republican,
but come on.
Right.
You know,

880
00:46:36.451 --> 00:46:38.250
both sides of demonize you and Kim.
And he goes,

881
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:40.950
and they've been really unfair to me.
And he went through this piece and I said,

882
00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:44.410
Mr President,
that's happened with every president.
Fair.
You know,
that's,

883
00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:47.100
that's what they both do.
And it's gotten worse throughout the years for sure.

884
00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:50.290
I said,
but what about Simpson Bowles?
And he said,
well,
Tony and eat,
you know,

885
00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:52.890
every has a research about who's in the room,
the president.
He goes,
well Tony,

886
00:46:52.891 --> 00:46:56.550
you know,
your friends,
your hedge fund friends,
he said,
you know,

887
00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.820
they wouldn't like it if we got rid of,
you know,

888
00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:02.520
the 15% tax so they can do and they win.
And he goes in,
you know,

889
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:05.850
most Americans would like it if they got rid of their mortgage deduction and you

890
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:08.220
know,
one else thinks.
And he said,
I got a better plan.
And I said,

891
00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:12.000
the better plan is you're going to raise taxes back to Bush on the wealthy.

892
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:16.200
And I said,
it takes $4 billion a day to run this country.

893
00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:18.480
And you know,
as well as I do,

894
00:47:18.481 --> 00:47:22.410
the estimates of all that money in won't even cover three months of this

895
00:47:22.411 --> 00:47:24.430
government spending.
So it won't solve any,

896
00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:27.660
you're gonna have to raise taxes on everyone to cover this.
I said,

897
00:47:27.661 --> 00:47:31.270
so how do you deal with that?
And he and I went back and forth and to be fair,

898
00:47:31.271 --> 00:47:33.660
I'm telling my version of the story.
I'm sure he'd give you the version story,

899
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:34.960
but there's a point where I was,

900
00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:38.590
I felt I'm losing rapport with every person in this room,
but I had to be honest.

901
00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:42.490
And,
and finally at 1.6 years and came over and grabbed my wrist and he said,

902
00:47:42.491 --> 00:47:46.030
I think that's enough.
And the presidents,
uh,
I wasn't even raised my voice.

903
00:47:46.031 --> 00:47:49.430
The presidents,
uh,
you know,
to honor him,
he said,
no,
Tony,

904
00:47:49.431 --> 00:47:51.850
he's created some creative tension here.
And he said,

905
00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:55.600
I'm not used to that and these rooms.
But he said,
it's fair question.
I said,

906
00:47:55.601 --> 00:47:57.970
you know what,
Christina,
I just want to know because I voted for you.

907
00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:00.730
And a lot of people I know that voted for you.
And I don't know if they will.

908
00:48:00.731 --> 00:48:03.560
Again,
I don't know if they need to.
You're going to win anyway.
Yep.

909
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:06.400
But I'd really love to know what to tell them about how you're going to govern

910
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:10.540
with this level of division.
And so at the end I just said,

911
00:48:10.541 --> 00:48:11.380
well thank you for your time.

912
00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:14.790
And then everybody else got up and ask the questions like when you give a shout

913
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.510
to the Jews,
and they were like that.

914
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:18.210
It doesn't have no hard balls in there at all,
but you know,

915
00:48:18.211 --> 00:48:20.660
as a political environment.
So afterwards I thought,
oh my God,

916
00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:23.080
he's gonna to hate me.
And the Reed Hoffman walks up to me,
you know,

917
00:48:23.081 --> 00:48:26.290
from linkedin says,
I can't believe you asked him that question.

918
00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:28.330
I can't believe you asked him that.
He said,

919
00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.030
I've been wanting to ask him that question forever.
He said,

920
00:48:31.031 --> 00:48:33.600
I would get on even a health.
People come up to me,
give me a boot.

921
00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:37.190
And then the present gave around and we came back around to,
it's shaking,

922
00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:37.991
his hand shakes my hand.

923
00:48:37.991 --> 00:48:40.430
I shook his hand and I grabbed him with both hands and I pulled him close to me

924
00:48:40.431 --> 00:48:41.980
and said,
Mr President,
I said,

925
00:48:41.981 --> 00:48:45.730
I'm not some stupid Republican who's just looking for some tax break.
I said,

926
00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.700
you know,
this week I thought a quarter million people in San Jose,

927
00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.550
I don't live here.
I came in to do an event.
This is what I do.
Wherever I go.

928
00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:54.460
I came from nothing and I don't forget where I've come from.

929
00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:57.190
I care as much as you care.
But I said,

930
00:48:57.191 --> 00:49:02.191
I'm really concerned about your ability to get your agenda done in the next

931
00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:03.190
season of your career.

932
00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:06.160
If you don't find a way to bridge your communication style with these people,

933
00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:09.400
intelligence is not enough.
You've got to build relationship.

934
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:12.160
And he stared at me and he said,

935
00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:17.730
how about you weren't like Keith Cheeky Chief of staff and you come visit me,

936
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:21.730
the White House you and I want on one for an hour.
I was like,
blown away.

937
00:49:21.731 --> 00:49:25.880
I thought,
you know,
I didn't reach him at all.
It was mind boggling.
So,
uh,

938
00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:28.330
mark was right there.
He goes,
that was unbelievable.
That was the going of,

939
00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.430
I love that,
you know,
Mark Club,

940
00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.300
I love seeing that that edge back and forth he use can really help.
So then,
um,

941
00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:37.120
about a week later they were getting ready to these debates and the other side

942
00:49:37.121 --> 00:49:40.360
called me and asked me if I would work with their particular candidate privately

943
00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.510
and I'm not one side of the,
I wouldn't want to see a debate that's real.

944
00:49:43.511 --> 00:49:46.870
So I worked with Mr Romney and that's the first debate they went in and he did

945
00:49:46.871 --> 00:49:50.440
pretty well and my invitation was no longer extended,

946
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:53.590
so I wouldn't say punched in the mouth,

947
00:49:53.591 --> 00:49:56.970
but I'd say frustrated because here's a man who has such integrity,

948
00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:01.980
president had states and I think a classic human being who cares deeply smart as

949
00:50:02.681 --> 00:50:04.420
a whip,
but it's,
you know,

950
00:50:04.421 --> 00:50:08.680
the failure to find a way to bridge compromise is both sides responsibility.

951
00:50:08.681 --> 00:50:10.930
But in my mind as a citizen and then the person had,

952
00:50:10.931 --> 00:50:13.180
states has got to make that happen and their presence have done that.

953
00:50:13.181 --> 00:50:16.030
And presidents that have it.
And I think that's not his fault,

954
00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.610
but we're at an impasse politically.

955
00:50:18.611 --> 00:50:21.850
That is not allowing us to do the things that I think are necessary for our,

956
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.450
you know,
put our house in order in this country and easy for an outsider see it.

957
00:50:25.451 --> 00:50:28.880
But as a citizen,
we all have a right to opinion.
So I don't know,
think punch,

958
00:50:28.881 --> 00:50:33.140
but I'd say you have a shakeup.
Metaphor might be a better one.

959
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:37.570
<v 1>Wow.
That's a hell of a story.
I,
uh,
one last question and uh,</v>

960
00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:40.660
I think people are really gonna enjoy this and I can't wait to see the comments

961
00:50:40.661 --> 00:50:45.430
on the questions also.
Uh,
I have my moments of doubt,

962
00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:49.300
dark moments.
I don't know if you have those,
those,

963
00:50:49.301 --> 00:50:54.040
those moments of doubt yourself,
never.
What do you do?

964
00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:58.170
Uh,
when you have those,
those,
those,
those dips,
when you have those,

965
00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:00.160
those down moments and,
uh,

966
00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:01.763
<v 2>those moments,</v>

967
00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:06.410
those moments I've experienced primarily when I found an inner conflict,
uh,

968
00:51:06.411 --> 00:51:08.030
that it's hard to resolve.
Um,

969
00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:12.220
and that was been in the past when I'm traveling around the world,
you know,

970
00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.470
I feel like I made to do what I do is human being.

971
00:51:14.471 --> 00:51:15.880
I'm certainly not the only him being can help people,

972
00:51:15.881 --> 00:51:18.350
but I'm able to have a lot of people and I've filled,

973
00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:19.720
it's a privilege and it's um,

974
00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:24.670
it's a gift and it's something that's earned and something that is part of
grace.

975
00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:26.870
And um,
and yet I,

976
00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:30.910
the greatest thing in my life outside of my work and my family is my wife.

977
00:51:31.330 --> 00:51:33.940
And ironically I met her,

978
00:51:33.941 --> 00:51:38.941
she had extreme motion sickness since birth and I spent almost a decade going

979
00:51:39.071 --> 00:51:41.680
everywhere cause she would throw up on,
we never want to be apart.

980
00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:44.560
And she would throw up on the flight up and on the flight down.

981
00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:47.620
And she literally lost,
I don't as 19 pounds,
which she couldn't lose.

982
00:51:47.621 --> 00:51:51.190
She was a size zero.
I took her to every type of physician.

983
00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:54.010
I took her to every kind of natural healer,
an acupuncturist.

984
00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:58.300
I took her to NASA thick expert there.
Nobody's able to help her.

985
00:51:58.301 --> 00:52:01.390
I took her to the guy who works at the top gun pilots because if they lose their

986
00:52:01.391 --> 00:52:03.340
budgets,
stipular system,
you know,
you know they're dead.

987
00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:05.410
So you had the system and he was the only one who can help her,

988
00:52:05.411 --> 00:52:08.230
like maybe 10% of the time,
not throw out the process.

989
00:52:08.290 --> 00:52:12.370
She did cause this antibody created a constriction of lymph fluid and she

990
00:52:12.371 --> 00:52:16.540
developed a tumor.
And so the darkest days are,

991
00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:20.770
you know what I think I made here to do and it is hurting the person I love most

992
00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:25.960
or I've got to be a part and you know,
Corny as it sounds.
I just,

993
00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:29.200
I just believed that there was a larger lesson that I need to find a way to

994
00:52:29.201 --> 00:52:29.621
break through.

995
00:52:29.621 --> 00:52:32.500
And we finally did and she know like she doesn't love motion but in Oregon

996
00:52:32.501 --> 00:52:35.170
throws up on any flight and it was ironically and experience in India,

997
00:52:35.171 --> 00:52:37.210
which sounds so bogus to me,

998
00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:40.390
but I experienced it and she's never thrown up since that time is mind boggling.

999
00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:43.210
It's just man who's,
it doesn't,

1000
00:52:43.211 --> 00:52:46.570
he's not of any particular faith that's called oneness.
And uh,

1001
00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:51.430
he does this form of meditation work where it basically prime your brain to a

1002
00:52:51.431 --> 00:52:56.030
certain way of being and it balanced her body out.
Just amazing.
Um,

1003
00:52:56.110 --> 00:52:59.560
but the point of the matter is,
I went through all this pain,
all this question,

1004
00:52:59.561 --> 00:53:03.850
all this doubt,
but I kept asking what's right,
what's real.

1005
00:53:03.851 --> 00:53:07.300
And I trusted my gut even when it was painful to trust my gut.

1006
00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:09.400
And I found that that's probably the most useful thing.

1007
00:53:09.401 --> 00:53:13.090
And the other thing you got to do is ha sounds stupid.

1008
00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:18.250
Hydrate your ass off.
Make sure you rest,
because in a lowered state of energy,

1009
00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:19.420
you'll doubt everything.

1010
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:23.980
And in the worst thing can happen if you are what I call energy rich.

1011
00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:27.270
If you are it at a peak,

1012
00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:30.870
you can slam anything against you and you'll know.
Um,

1013
00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:32.760
and so that's not to say you won't have those downs,

1014
00:53:32.761 --> 00:53:33.541
but that's what I tried to do.

1015
00:53:33.541 --> 00:53:37.020
Put my body back in the strongest place that will put your mind back there.

1016
00:53:37.021 --> 00:53:40.440
Your heart is always there and then ask what's right and live it and you're

1017
00:53:40.441 --> 00:53:41.880
gonna still make mistakes.
And when you do,

1018
00:53:41.881 --> 00:53:46.020
I think it's being forgiving herself and learning from it and moving hell on to

1019
00:53:46.021 --> 00:53:46.561
what's next,

1020
00:53:46.561 --> 00:53:50.040
as quickly as you can so that that experience allows you to help other people.

1021
00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:52.980
And for me,
the worst events I've ever gone through my life,

1022
00:53:52.981 --> 00:53:55.950
I've always been the best events cause I figured if I'm experiencing this

1023
00:53:55.951 --> 00:53:56.790
someone else's too,

1024
00:53:56.791 --> 00:54:00.420
and if I figured out I can help millions of people and that's given me sanity,

1025
00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:03.510
so I'm not just dealing with my pain or bullshit or whatever the case may be.

1026
00:54:03.511 --> 00:54:07.230
And that's,
that's a big part of my life is ending suffering,
which is impossible,

1027
00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:11.750
but ending it in areas of people's lives is possible.
And you know,

1028
00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:16.080
it was like always say it was corny.
You know,
suffering is optional.
Paying Kane,

1029
00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:18.240
you know that everyone's got pain in the left,
but suffering is optional.

1030
00:54:18.241 --> 00:54:20.220
And I really believe I can help people get out of that.

1031
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:23.130
More importantly than get out of the suffering is to give them an experience and

1032
00:54:23.131 --> 00:54:24.540
more than joy that's already inside them.

1033
00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:27.210
And I lived to see that light in their eyes.

1034
00:54:27.211 --> 00:54:29.470
And I'm going to look forward to seeing you at some point out of that cause

1035
00:54:29.471 --> 00:54:32.280
you'll have an experience of it and it won't be this discussion because

1036
00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:36.150
discussions,
wonderful experience 10 times better.
I always tell people,
you know,

1037
00:54:36.151 --> 00:54:39.580
a belief is a poor substitute for an experience,
right?

1038
00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:42.730
You can believe all you want about what you think something is or investing is

1039
00:54:42.731 --> 00:54:46.140
or what China's like we'd go to China getting the experience,
go to event,

1040
00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:47.003
venule know.

1041
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:50.640
And I'm a big guy on put people in the experience as quick as they can and let

1042
00:54:50.641 --> 00:54:53.100
their spirit and their heart and their soul kind of take over.

1043
00:54:53.101 --> 00:54:56.670
And that's what my life's about.
To get admission.
It's an amazing mission.

1044
00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.140
Where can people learn more about the book?
Come on that you,

1045
00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:03.060
where would you like him to go?
His,
I'll give you the address,

1046
00:55:03.061 --> 00:55:05.640
but they can go to Tony robbins.com.
That's the easiest way.

1047
00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:09.270
And the book again is called money master the game.

1048
00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:13.170
Seven simple steps to financial freedom.
And,
uh,
uh,

1049
00:55:13.171 --> 00:55:17.010
what I'll do is I'll give you a site and if people decide to do this and they go

1050
00:55:17.011 --> 00:55:19.500
to Amazon,
it,
they'll send me the receipt.

1051
00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:22.950
I will give them something I did for people during the pre publication period,

1052
00:55:22.951 --> 00:55:27.060
which is I've made three videos that are kind of a fast track.

1053
00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:30.780
So somebody going to like 600 pages seems like a lot to me.
Well here's this,

1054
00:55:30.781 --> 00:55:32.100
we'll get you going.
Um,

1055
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:35.220
I think for a lot of people the audio video approach is a good approach to them

1056
00:55:35.221 --> 00:55:36.540
and then it'll take them deeper in the book.

1057
00:55:36.541 --> 00:55:38.670
But I do want you to know that most people,

1058
00:55:38.671 --> 00:55:39.660
I don't know if you're experiencing this and this,

1059
00:55:39.661 --> 00:55:42.960
we read the book or entertained because it isn't just like some heavy factual

1060
00:55:42.961 --> 00:55:43.781
piece.
It's take,

1061
00:55:43.781 --> 00:55:47.040
it takes you on a journey and it's a journey through financial world,

1062
00:55:47.041 --> 00:55:49.800
which was wild,
weird,
crazy stuff happening.

1063
00:55:49.801 --> 00:55:52.470
It's a journey to the lives of people that started with nothing,

1064
00:55:52.471 --> 00:55:54.360
that are the wealthiest people in the world.
How they did it.

1065
00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:57.900
And your own journey about where you're going to take yourself from this point

1066
00:55:57.901 --> 00:56:02.160
on and how you want to live that life and experiences that you want to not only

1067
00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:04.090
have for yourself,
but what you really want to give.
And,

1068
00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:07.860
and that's the greatest thing.
I,
I,
I look back and you think about money.

1069
00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:13.530
Money is nothing but a tool that you either use for a life of service in a life

1070
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:17.240
increased the quality of life for yourself and the people you love or it's used

1071
00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:18.480
on you cause a weapon.

1072
00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:22.830
And I'm big on saying time for it to no longer be a weapon used against you.

1073
00:56:22.831 --> 00:56:24.220
And the only way to do that as educate

1074
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:27.250
<v 1>yourself.
And you can do it in a way that's really fun.
And that's what this says.</v>

1075
00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:30.730
Oh,
absolutely.
So guys,
check out the book.
Check out Tony.
Uh,

1076
00:56:30.731 --> 00:56:34.690
Tony had a huge impact on my life and just to the entertainment aspect of the

1077
00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:36.850
book.
Uh,
I have tons of books sent to me.

1078
00:56:36.851 --> 00:56:39.970
I mean dozens a week cause I'm sure you do.
Huge stack.

1079
00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:44.170
A lot of the questions that I asked did not require me to read the book.

1080
00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:49.260
And I ended up pushing off probably a half dozen important projects of mine

1081
00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:53.050
because I got pulled into the book and I remember I emailed you and I said,

1082
00:56:53.051 --> 00:56:56.770
you know,
it's been 20 years,
you still have it hot.
Damn.

1083
00:56:56.771 --> 00:57:01.771
Like I that feeling that sort of the Tony Robbins response that I had reading

1084
00:57:01.871 --> 00:57:04.450
your material back in high school and remember you emailed me or like high

1085
00:57:04.451 --> 00:57:07.620
school.
How old are you?
It's,

1086
00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:10.840
it's a really fascinating read and I know some of you listening are,

1087
00:57:10.841 --> 00:57:13.890
my friends are deep in the world of finance.
You will find things,
uh,

1088
00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:17.330
in whether it's in the interviews at the back,
the profile,
some of the,
uh,

1089
00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:21.370
you know,
the top performers over the last several decades or within,

1090
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:25.600
it's a really fascinating romp with lots of good stories.
So Tony,

1091
00:57:25.601 --> 00:57:30.070
thank you so much for taking the time.
Definitely hope it's not the last time.
