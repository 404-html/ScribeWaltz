19
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.180
Ladies and gentlemen,

20
00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:31.590
this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show where

21
00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:35.610
of course I try to deconstruct world class performers,

22
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.970
whether they be billionaire investor is chess,
prodigies,

23
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.590
athletes and everything in between to pull apart,

24
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.680
tease out the tactics and tools and resources that you can use and this episode

25
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.340
was a real treat.
I had so much fun with this.

26
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.360
It was easily one of the most enlightening and lucid conversations about

27
00:01:57.361 --> 00:02:02.220
physical training I've ever had and we covered everything,
meaning strength,

28
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.860
flexibility,
endurance and beyond.

29
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.030
And my guest is none other than Pavel Tsatsouline and yes,

30
00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:13.830
that is how you say it.
He is chairman of strong first inc and was born in minx.

31
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.150
Not Thinks Minsk.
I always have so much trouble saying that.

32
00:02:18.151 --> 00:02:21.180
Not that I say at that much.
USSR,
former USSR,

33
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:25.050
which is now part of Baylor Russ in the 1980s he was a physical training

34
00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:27.190
instructor for [inaudible].

35
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.210
That's also another one I want to miss pronounce always.

36
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.340
It's not Spetsnaz Spit Nas,
the elite Soviet special forces units.

37
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.580
Pablo is now a subject matter expert to the u s Marine Corps,

38
00:02:38.581 --> 00:02:43.530
US secret service and the US Navy seals and he has also perhaps you know this or

39
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:48.240
not,
he is widely credited with introducing the Kettlebell to the United States,

40
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.770
the ubiquitous kettle bell,
which is called kettle ball by almost everyone.

41
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.070
Maybe that should be changed to make things easier.
In any case,

42
00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:59.560
over the last several years,
Pablo has become a friend of mine.

43
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.610
I'm honored to call him a friend and his input was critical to the success and

44
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.550
many of the experiments of the four hour body,

45
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.830
whether you have heard of him or not,

46
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.990
stick with this interview prepared to have your mind blown and I really don't

47
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:15.100
say that lightly.

48
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.020
You are going to enjoy this and that you will have a lot to take notes on and

49
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:20.561
they're all of course,

50
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:25.561
be tons in the show notes@fourhourworkweek.com forward slash podcast but without

51
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:31.570
further ado,
here we go.
Please meet Pavel Tsatsouline.

52
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.060
Pavel,
welcome to the show.
I'm so thrilled to have you.

53
00:03:39.061 --> 00:03:40.980
And I thought we would start with the,

54
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.980
the answer to a question that I ask all of my guests,

55
00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:48.630
which is how do you pronounce your name properly?
Uh,
bubble.

56
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.450
So insulin,
it's hot.
Sulan and,

57
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.770
and you'd mentioned before we came on what you tell people at Starbucks if you

58
00:03:57.061 --> 00:04:01.830
order a coffee in the end,
what does that it just has to be Pablo Pablo.

59
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.450
There was no other way

60
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.130
and I uh,

61
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.310
I've really admired your work and the expertise and also just your method of

62
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.830
teaching quite frankly for so many years.

63
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.120
And I was having trouble piecing together how we first came in contact.

64
00:04:21.121 --> 00:04:21.391
Of course,

65
00:04:21.391 --> 00:04:26.391
I was well aware of your work prior to us having us having any direct contact.

66
00:04:26.821 --> 00:04:29.460
But how,
do you recall how we,
how we came to know each other?

67
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.120
<v 3>Yes,
I do it Tim.
Uh,
as you,</v>

68
00:04:32.121 --> 00:04:35.990
I'm a big fan of simplicity in my life and different aspects of my life.

69
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.740
And a four hour work week really resonated with me.

70
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.870
And at that point I remember writing an article and I entitled the,

71
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:46.610
an Article Ferris Bueller's Day,
the gym.

72
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:49.010
<v 0>Okay.</v>

73
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.430
<v 3>And I sent you that article.
I submitted it for him,</v>

74
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.010
<v 0>Blah.
That's right.
That's right.
Okay.
And that,
that,</v>

75
00:04:56.011 --> 00:05:00.740
that really set a cascade of events in motion.

76
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.360
And I became very,
very fascinated.
I mean,
of course,
like a lot of people,

77
00:05:05.361 --> 00:05:09.720
I think I was initially exposed to you as the strength trainer who,

78
00:05:09.721 --> 00:05:13.730
who used the word comrade at a lot and really hadn't,

79
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.550
hadn't delved into a lot of the details,
uh,

80
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.880
of your strength training specifically,
which will of course get into.

81
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.230
And I guess there are two questions I'd love to ask,
but the first is,
uh,

82
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.250
what do people consider you,
the people who know you well,

83
00:05:31.251 --> 00:05:33.290
what do they consider you world class at

84
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.460
<v 3>Tim?</v>

85
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.320
I have been able to take very complex subjects,

86
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.720
take them apart and put them back together in a manner that's very simple,

87
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.130
that can be delivered to regular people without losing the essence of what

88
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:57.090
these,
uh,
of the systems.
So I'm talking about specifically serious strength.

89
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.690
I'm talking about both programming and I'm talking about what I would refer to

90
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:04.790
as a divided language of strengths.

91
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.070
<v 0>And could you explain for people who are perhaps not,
uh,</v>

92
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.680
not inductees into the world of strength training yet?

93
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.120
What do you mean by programming?

94
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.710
<v 3>Programming,
planning your training.
You go from a to B,</v>

95
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.310
you want to add 50 pounds to deadlift.
This is what you do.

96
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.300
And unfortunately the world of programming is very confused.

97
00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:28.130
While the whole world of fitness is very confused and again,

98
00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:31.420
at what I attempt to do is to bring principle based training.

99
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.660
So when you understand the principles,
applications are,

100
00:06:34.661 --> 00:06:36.940
many applications are easy,
right?

101
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.750
<v 0>And I,
I think that's where I feel such a,
such a degree of,</v>

102
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.630
of kinship with what you tried to do with these subjects.
Because of course,

103
00:06:45.631 --> 00:06:49.130
whether I succeed or fail and sometimes they do both,
uh,
I,

104
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.850
that's very much what I try to deal with.
The subjects that I tend to obsess on.

105
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.520
And for,
for those who are familiar with your background,

106
00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:02.420
you've worked with many different types of elite athletes and also special

107
00:07:02.461 --> 00:07:03.950
forces and so on.
Uh,

108
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.960
would you mind just giving a little bit of background on your,
um,

109
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.140
your bonafide,
so to speak,
some of your,
your,
your background as it relates to,

110
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.240
to training?
I'm sure.
Fine.

111
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.630
<v 3>I used to be a PT training instructor,
physical training instructor force beds,</v>

112
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.700
Oz,
uh,
sort a special courses.

113
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.420
And my education is in sports science and uh,

114
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.060
I did over the years trained a number of,
uh,

115
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.970
high end units in the West.

116
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.370
I've been a subject matter to a US Marine Corps,
to the US secret service,

117
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.780
uh,
Jews,
navy seals and others.
And uh,

118
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.760
my methods are used,
uh,
officially by some very high end,
uh,

119
00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:52.010
military and counter terrorist units into countries that are main allies of the

120
00:07:52.501 --> 00:07:56.400
United States.
What I do,
pardon me?

121
00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.700
<v 0>Oh,
I'm sorry.
No,
I was just,
uh,
my,
my brain erupted with something nonsensical.</v>

122
00:08:00.701 --> 00:08:01.534
Please continue.

123
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:02.270
<v 3>So,</v>

124
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:07.270
so what I do is I take methods that perform very well in very rugged

125
00:08:08.511 --> 00:08:12.740
environments and I take this methods and I apply it to other environments.

126
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.030
So if somebody decides I just wanted to change my life,
I went to get stronger.

127
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.930
I want to have a better game of tennis.
I want to succeed in a given sport.

128
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:26.090
I take these same methods that have been tested by operators at war,

129
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.490
and I bring these people the same methods.

130
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.410
<v 0>And uh,
just to,
to,</v>

131
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.370
to drill into that because I've seen the many,
I'm sure at this point,

132
00:08:35.371 --> 00:08:40.050
thousands of photographs that are sent to you by deployed troops overseas or

133
00:08:40.051 --> 00:08:44.370
people in special forces,
uh,
of their kettle bells or,
or they're,

134
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.850
they're,
they're,
uh,
they're rigged.
They're rigged gyms with know,

135
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.490
sort of makeshift pull up bars and whatnot.
What,

136
00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:57.491
what is it that you have to keep mind when you're designing or why have,

137
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:02.250
why have your methods had such appeal for a elite military?

138
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:06.960
What are the things that you've considered perhaps at other people have not for

139
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:08.850
those types of trainees?

140
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.390
<v 3>Well,</v>

141
00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:15.390
and Plutarch who said thousands of years ago that the training of a soldier and

142
00:09:15.431 --> 00:09:17.500
the training of an athlete is radically different.

143
00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.980
That I'd athlete has the luxury of a pampered lifestyle and,

144
00:09:23.141 --> 00:09:26.530
uh,
the soldier doesn't.
So this is pretty much the difference.

145
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:31.260
So what you want to do is you want to build the training that'd becomes in the

146
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:35.770
wards or one of my favorite authors did they seem Taleb antifragile is that type

147
00:09:35.771 --> 00:09:39.850
of trading training does it thrives on very harsh environment that's really

148
00:09:39.851 --> 00:09:44.740
robust in those different environments.
And uh,
that's pretty much the difference.

149
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:45.603
How do we do that?

150
00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:50.610
We have to strip all the nonessentials down pretty much what you do in your work

151
00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:56.380
with different,
uh,
with business,
with lifestyle and so on.

152
00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.220
And once we get down to the things that really matter and we apply them,

153
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.980
then everything's out in the big towns.
Very simple.

154
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.460
<v 0>Have you spent any time with,
uh,
Nasim?</v>

155
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.720
<v 3>No,
I have not.
I have not.
I'm looking forward to,</v>

156
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.590
<v 0>Oh,
I should,
uh,
I should introduce you guys at some point.
He's,</v>

157
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:16.670
he's exactly what you see is what you get if you've read his books.

158
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.980
And I think you guys would really hit it off.
Uh,
the,
the,

159
00:10:21.981 --> 00:10:26.200
uh,
you know,
what you just said brought to mind,
uh,

160
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:31.380
a conversation that I had with a friend of mine who was formerly navy seal and

161
00:10:31.581 --> 00:10:33.340
now he's doing things that he can't tell me about,

162
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:37.610
not that he could tell me much about what he did before,
but,
uh,
he and actually,

163
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.840
uh,
not to be named,
but I now that now that I think of it,
you introduced us.
Uh,

164
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:46.790
so let's call him victor.
Victor.
Yes.
Victor.
Amazing guy.

165
00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.950
And uh,
victor is,

166
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:53.300
is the most efficient trash compactor I've ever seen in my life.
He,

167
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:58.250
he can eat anything and make fuel out of it.

168
00:10:58.251 --> 00:11:02.600
And he was,
uh,
he was criticizing it in a very good natured way.

169
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.150
Some of his colleagues,
cause he said,
well,
you know,
you know,

170
00:11:05.151 --> 00:11:07.970
some of the guys that I,
that I work with out in the field,
you know,

171
00:11:07.971 --> 00:11:11.150
some of them are the bodybuilder types and they get really grumpy if they can't

172
00:11:11.151 --> 00:11:14.330
have their protein shake every two or three hours.
And he's said,

173
00:11:14.331 --> 00:11:17.870
I view it as a real competitive and practical advantage that I can,

174
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:22.340
I can consume anything.
And then go for a 30 40 50 mile run.

175
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.940
<v 3>Well and victor 40 strengths also.</v>

176
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:28.450
That gentleman is exceptional both in his strengths and he's and Doris budge for

177
00:11:28.451 --> 00:11:33.250
his strengths.
He relies on the nervous system,
not so much in the muscle to,

178
00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:35.800
and again,
that's what's so there's lots of different,

179
00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:40.690
you can if you look at or a typical person and how do we get him stronger.

180
00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:45.780
Let's say that you have a four cylinder engine and what the person would do is

181
00:11:46.061 --> 00:11:48.970
they would make that,
you know,
six cylinder engine,

182
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.970
but before you were firing in two and now you're firing in three.

183
00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.940
But if instead you do is you learn to fire on all four.

184
00:11:55.420 --> 00:12:00.190
So there are ways of training your nervous system to engage your capacity so

185
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:01.240
much more fully.

186
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:06.580
And if you look at high level performers at light body weight in some fields,

187
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.500
let's say a very high level martial artists,
somebody very skinny,

188
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:14.550
breaking a stack of boards or very skinny guy like landmark and dead lifting

189
00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:16.420
five times his body weight.

190
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:20.470
So this is so much about the concentration of mental force.

191
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.420
And for your listeners,
I could give a very simple example how you can use,

192
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.230
you can do that.
Then your gym,
let's say that you performed,

193
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.210
tried for the simplest exercise possible,

194
00:12:31.211 --> 00:12:35.590
try it with a dumbbell curl or a barbell curl because I know your sissies out

195
00:12:35.591 --> 00:12:35.711
there.

196
00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:40.711
You'll do that and so let's say that you were going through your curls and

197
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.750
things are suddenly started to get tougher so when these suddenly start to get

198
00:12:46.751 --> 00:12:47.290
tougher,

199
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:52.290
I wouldn't you to just crush the dumbbell or the barbell or the kettle bell,

200
00:12:52.841 --> 00:12:55.810
whatever it is that you're currently just white knuckle,

201
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.980
white knuckled pressure and which you will see is you're going to definitely

202
00:12:59.981 --> 00:13:03.850
going to be able to get several more repetitions out and I'm going to give you

203
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.160
two more techniques in addition,
once you have practiced that,

204
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:14.530
then on the next set,
in addition to crushing the bar and the way up,

205
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:18.370
also contract your glutes as tight as possible.

206
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.310
Like somebody going to kick you in the bud very,
very tight.

207
00:13:21.311 --> 00:13:22.750
So you just like crunch,
you will not.

208
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.550
And at the same time tighten your abs as if somebody is going to kick you,

209
00:13:27.551 --> 00:13:32.410
which you know,
somebody might.
So if you do that,
if you do these three things,

210
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:36.400
if you can track your glutes,
contract,
your abs,
contract,
your grip,

211
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:40.840
everything that you do,
absolutely everything is going to be greatly amplified.

212
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:46.380
And this is just a small example of the skills of strengths that I do teach.

213
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.250
<v 0>And we're going to,</v>

214
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:54.310
we're going to dig really deeply into this because I have personally reached a

215
00:13:54.831 --> 00:13:58.130
point where I want to return to the training of a,

216
00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:03.170
an athlete who's trying to optimize relative strength as opposed to just packing

217
00:14:03.171 --> 00:14:07.550
on slabs and pounds of muscle.
Uh,
which,
uh,
quite frankly,

218
00:14:07.551 --> 00:14:11.930
just my frame and my joints and my,
my entire system is,
is,

219
00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:16.850
is finding a aggravating to sustain just the,
the,

220
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:21.350
the fulltime eating and other bull diabetes.
And that's what gets me,
Oh God,

221
00:14:21.351 --> 00:14:25.460
it's the worst.
Ah,
especially as someone who has,
depending on how you look at it,

222
00:14:25.461 --> 00:14:30.461
like the most acute form of conditioned like body dysmorphia or orthorexia

223
00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.260
possible through a decade of wrestling.

224
00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.750
It's just my eating habits are really astonishing.

225
00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:40.940
So there like a German shepherd is like broken into the pantry and eating sticks

226
00:14:40.941 --> 00:14:44.330
of butter on,
on more than more than a few occasions.
But the,

227
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.720
the question I wanted to ask you,
uh,

228
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:51.790
next is what are the biggest misconceptions that people have about powerful

229
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.100
<v 3>Tatsu Sulan and I am training myself to say touch Sulan because I've heard</v>

230
00:14:55.101 --> 00:14:57.830
everyone say Satsu lean.
So I'm trying to correct that.

231
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:01.530
But what are the biggest misconceptions that people have about you?
Well,

232
00:15:01.531 --> 00:15:06.320
do they call him the Big Kettle Bell Guy?
They,
me,
the father of the Kettlebell,

233
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:10.080
which I appreciate very much.
I did introduce together with my business partner,

234
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:12.260
I did introduce the kettle belt to the west.

235
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:16.130
And right now the kettle bell has become mainstream.

236
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.090
But what I'm really all about,
it's above the principles,

237
00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:23.840
the underlying principles of strength training that underlining principles of

238
00:15:23.841 --> 00:15:27.320
power generation.
And it doesn't really matter what modality you use,

239
00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:30.380
whether you use a kettle bell,
the Barbell,
your bodyweight,

240
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:34.100
whether your armrest and fighting,
lifting rocks,
it really doesn't matter.

241
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:37.010
So I am not about the kettle bell.

242
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.620
I am about the principles that make us strong.

243
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.980
What I have done is I have reverse engineered the way the strongest people move

244
00:15:45.921 --> 00:15:46.754
naturally.

245
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.300
And I have brought it to the people I've shown to people how to move in this

246
00:15:50.301 --> 00:15:52.970
matter and how to shave off years.

247
00:15:52.971 --> 00:15:57.500
And if not decades of training to progress too much higher then you,

248
00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.260
you've worked with some incredible strength athletes.

249
00:16:00.261 --> 00:16:02.120
Would you mind mentioning some of the main,

250
00:16:02.121 --> 00:16:04.860
some of them you've coauthored books with,
but,
uh,
who are,

251
00:16:04.861 --> 00:16:09.230
who are some of the strength athletes that you've collab or a strength trainers

252
00:16:09.231 --> 00:16:13.940
that you've collaborated with?
Andy Bolton.
Uh,
Andy Bolden,

253
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:19.160
uh,
he's,
uh,
the first person to dead lift or a thousand pounds.
He is,

254
00:16:19.161 --> 00:16:23.990
um,
he's an amazing athlete.
He's a very,
very smart trader.
So Andy Bolton,
I,

255
00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:28.040
we have written a book together called the dead,
the dynamite.
And,
uh,

256
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.940
the reason Andy and I have written this project together is again,

257
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:36.970
and he's very smart trainer and he's particular title that looks exactly like

258
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:41.600
the Kettlebell swing that I teach.
So it's again,
that fit of the body language.

259
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.500
I have a written a book called easy strengths with debt.
John,

260
00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.980
Dan and John is a strange coach extraordinaire.

261
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:54.490
You would really love introducing dad on the show because he's a beast that is

262
00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.390
and who's so again,
he just gets past the fluff.

263
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.920
He goes to the things that matter and then does not have tried to press you then

264
00:17:03.921 --> 00:17:05.210
tries to get the results.

265
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:10.220
So Dan and I are variation with collaboration with his dad over the years.

266
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:10.850
Uh,

267
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:15.850
we have taught each other a lot and our views and strengths are very similar

268
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.760
even though they are colored in some way.

269
00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:23.180
So that's why we have written this book called the easy strengths.

270
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:28.570
And so easiest strengths was about making yourself strong for your sport,

271
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:35.270
not making lifting in your priority.
That's what easy strength lives abroad.

272
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:40.310
And just since you brought it up,
what are some of the things that you've,
you've,

273
00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.580
uh,
what would be an example or examples of things you've learned from Dan?

274
00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:52.100
Dan has a terrific concept.
The quadrants,
the four quadrants,
uh,

275
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:57.000
uh,
one grid,
you're going to see the level of development,
the level,

276
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.870
uh,
on the other one you're going to see the level of specialization.

277
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.700
It's really quite hard to explain that,
uh,
over over audio.

278
00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:10.020
But if you look out type in Dan,
John and quadra and since a terrific concept.

279
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:15.470
So what that allows you to do is it allows you to place yourself today and the

280
00:18:16.001 --> 00:18:21.001
particular quadrant according to your status according to your goals and select

281
00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:23.700
the correct type of training for yourself.

282
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.990
That alone is going to save years of preparation for you.

283
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.300
So that just one of the many things then,

284
00:18:30.301 --> 00:18:35.150
and I have exchanged this little tactical tidbits and details over the years and

285
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.940
I highly recommend that then John has worked to anybody.

286
00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:43.970
Anybody who's an athlete or anybody who thinks of himself or herself as an

287
00:18:44.821 --> 00:18:45.654
athlete.

288
00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:47.080
<v 0>And I'd love to,</v>

289
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:52.110
I want to personally give a few examples of just how quickly or how

290
00:18:52.451 --> 00:18:57.370
significantly you can shave off what people assume is required to make massive

291
00:18:57.371 --> 00:19:02.230
gains.
You introduced me to Barry Ross in uh,

292
00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.630
Los Angeles and the,

293
00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:08.560
that became the effortless superhuman chapter in the four hour body and I was

294
00:19:08.561 --> 00:19:09.394
able to put,

295
00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:14.670
I'd have to say it must have been between a hundred and 150 pounds on my dead

296
00:19:14.941 --> 00:19:19.930
lift in less than three months.
I mean,
it was,
it was just,
it was crazy.

297
00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:21.190
And uh,

298
00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:25.390
particularly when you consider the inputs or the total amount of time under

299
00:19:25.391 --> 00:19:29.740
tension and,
and actual lifting frequency and time,
it was state.
It really,

300
00:19:29.741 --> 00:19:33.850
I've seen just given that we are cut from the same cloth and that we try to

301
00:19:33.851 --> 00:19:38.500
distill very complex things and,
and use 80 20 analysis and so on.

302
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.100
I've seen a lot of disproportionate outputs for inputs,
but it really just,

303
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.200
it really blew me away.
And the,

304
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:48.070
the testing of assumptions where in that particular case it's a dead lift based

305
00:19:48.071 --> 00:19:52.120
protocol that's using what many people would consider the weakest range emotion.

306
00:19:52.121 --> 00:19:56.920
So from the floor up to the knees effectively really impressed me in and then

307
00:19:56.921 --> 00:20:00.760
to,
to highlight your,
a couple of the points you made earlier,

308
00:20:00.761 --> 00:20:05.290
the crushing with the grip and the,
the ABS and the glutes.

309
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:09.140
I recall,
uh,
when I did,
uh,
uh,

310
00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.670
RKC one an RKC too for those people not familiar with the Russian kettlebell

311
00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:16.330
certification one and two a,
which was a tremendous,

312
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:20.710
a tremendously positive experience for me.
And,
and uh,

313
00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:26.500
encountering a Max plank.
Um,
if I'm getting that,
that is his last name,
right?

314
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:31.630
Uh,
Mike,
am I getting that right?
Does that Max a big MACs?
Uh,
he,

315
00:20:31.631 --> 00:20:35.830
he was a believer.
I believe that's,
that's the fellow that whose named is,

316
00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.740
it's coming to mind.
But there were,
there were a few people,

317
00:20:38.741 --> 00:20:41.080
yourself included who,
uh,

318
00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:45.880
I did not pass all of the tests for RKC to the first time around.

319
00:20:45.881 --> 00:20:47.860
And one of them,
if remembering correctly,

320
00:20:47.861 --> 00:20:51.850
was a cleaning and pressing a kettle bell.
That's roughly half your body weight.

321
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:57.160
And uh,
I,
I,
I,
I was,

322
00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.340
I guess I ultimately made the three attempts and I failed on the first two

323
00:21:00.341 --> 00:21:05.341
attempts and with a few minor corrections just as moving my weight slightly back

324
00:21:07.001 --> 00:21:09.500
towards the heels cleaning,
uh,

325
00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:14.410
with my elbow closer to basically dropping my elbow a little bit lower and then

326
00:21:14.411 --> 00:21:16.690
really focusing on the grip,
I was able to press it.

327
00:21:16.691 --> 00:21:21.460
And the third attempt was felt easy and it was just astonishing.
Uh,

328
00:21:21.461 --> 00:21:25.450
also some of the demonstrations that you've done in front of trainees where

329
00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:27.610
you've taken people out of the crowd and said,
all right,

330
00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.940
who's somebody who would consider there,
and I'm paraphrasing here,
but your,

331
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.880
your maximum press x number of kilos and then you'd bring them up in,

332
00:21:34.881 --> 00:21:37.630
in front of everyone in the,
in the,
within five minutes or so,

333
00:21:37.631 --> 00:21:41.890
you'd increase their press by whatever it might be,
five,
five kilos or 10 kilos.

334
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.060
You,
you once mentioned to me in a casual conversation,

335
00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.680
I called you for some type of training advice or it might've been via email.
And,

336
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:52.480
uh,
correct me if I'm wrong,
but you said,
when in doubt,

337
00:21:52.481 --> 00:21:57.100
train your grip and your core is that,
could you elaborate on that?

338
00:21:57.101 --> 00:22:01.330
Because I think it's very,
uh,
it's not advice that many people have received.

339
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:06.060
<v 3>Walton,
uh,
there is such a thing as cold.
The radiation.</v>

340
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.950
So the phenomena of irradiation,

341
00:22:07.951 --> 00:22:10.950
what it really means is if you can attract a muscle,

342
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:14.910
the tension from that muscle is going to spill over to the neighborhood muscles.

343
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.660
So,
uh,
for your listeners,
I'd like to try this,
make a fist,

344
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.890
probably going to feel tension in your forearm.
Now make a tight fist.

345
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.620
You're going to feel tension in your biceps,
triceps.

346
00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:27.330
Don't make a white knuckle fist.

347
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.850
You're going to find that tension is going to spread it into your shoulder.

348
00:22:29.851 --> 00:22:34.290
You latch it back and so on.
Okay,
folks,
you may relax now and,
uh,

349
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:39.120
the same thing happens.
So certain areas of the body have this great,

350
00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:44.190
uh,
great overflow of tension.
So the gripping muscles or,
yeah,
amongst them.

351
00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:45.503
Why?

352
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:50.510
In part because they have such a drudge representation in your nervous system,

353
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:54.540
in your brain.
And as for the ads and us for the glutes,

354
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:58.140
that has a lot to do with creating your intro abdominal pressure.

355
00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:59.400
So what does this mean exactly?

356
00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:05.220
Visualize your muscles as speakers and visualize your brain as the gadget that

357
00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.160
plays the music.
Whatever it is is days,
iPad,
iPhone,
whatever.

358
00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.990
And the record player,
it doesn't matter.
And the amount of your pressure,

359
00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.200
the pressure in your abdomen,
they dropped Donald,
the pressure,

360
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.080
that's the amplifier,
that's a volume control.

361
00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:25.470
So by increasing the pressure in your abdomen,

362
00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.860
it's like you're turning up the volume and vice versa.

363
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.310
So when you're trying to stretch,
when increasing your flexibility,

364
00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:35.610
if you see somebody,
they're trying to do a split and you see

365
00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:38.243
it's a,

366
00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:43.280
the person is creating high intra abdominal pressure and that just increases the

367
00:23:43.501 --> 00:23:46.100
tension of the muscle.
Instead you need to do,
you need to

368
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:51.950
complete the release and let go and bring it down.

369
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:53.960
So for strengths would do the opposite.

370
00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:58.340
We have special techniques where you increase that pressure and maximize your

371
00:23:58.341 --> 00:23:59.770
power.
So that's,

372
00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.810
those are just a couple of different ways we can increase his strengths.

373
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:06.340
And that's what you've seen in my certification.
Fyi,

374
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:09.650
I am no longer with that organization.
So right.
My company,
today's cold,

375
00:24:09.651 --> 00:24:13.760
strong first and sod certification.

376
00:24:13.761 --> 00:24:17.120
That's that same curriculum that you have that you have learned back then.

377
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:21.850
<v 0>And uh,
the,
um,
just to,</v>

378
00:24:21.851 --> 00:24:26.220
to touch on two points and then we're going to jump into more training in and

379
00:24:26.221 --> 00:24:30.710
ask about how you would rank certain aspects of what people would traditionally

380
00:24:30.711 --> 00:24:33.650
consider perhaps fitness,
uh,
the,

381
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:37.250
what would be a good,
what would you,

382
00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.660
what would you recommend as good methods for developing,
uh,

383
00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:45.620
the grip and a core or abdomen,

384
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:47.450
uh,
for,
for those people listening,

385
00:24:47.451 --> 00:24:52.451
if they wanted to take a simple protocol and perhaps experiment for the next few

386
00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.430
weeks,
what uh,
is,

387
00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:57.380
is there any basic approach that you might suggest for those two things?

388
00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:03.590
<v 3>It can be done in conjunction with a full body training regimen that uses,</v>

389
00:25:04.081 --> 00:25:08.490
let's say,
kettle bells climbing the road,
so,
so on.
But if it is not,

390
00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:11.700
then what I recommend that you do is you get some grippers.

391
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.910
So the company's called iron mind iron,

392
00:25:14.911 --> 00:25:18.120
mind.com and they carry hen grippers.

393
00:25:18.121 --> 00:25:21.310
One thing you need to understand is these are now those little sissy blessed a

394
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.170
group as you get it at you get at a store.
Uh,

395
00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:28.380
these are heavy duty grippers they'd go up to 365 pounds,

396
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:31.430
which a couple of people in the world I've done that.
And uh,

397
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.550
they also do have the also do have resources and how to do that.

398
00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:40.020
But even without reading how I can tell you how to train.

399
00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:43.230
So it gets yourself a couple of Gerber's use their charge,

400
00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:46.900
their recommendations that iron mind offers and uh,

401
00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:52.380
start training them in the manner that are referred to as a grease the groove,

402
00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:53.121
the grease,

403
00:25:53.121 --> 00:25:57.180
the groove is a highly simplified training methodology that's been derived from

404
00:25:57.181 --> 00:26:00.270
Soviet weightlifting methodology.
So in a nutshell,

405
00:26:00.271 --> 00:26:03.840
this is what you do throughout the day,
every day,

406
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.120
whenever you feel fully recovered.

407
00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.540
So you have to have at least 15 minutes of rest between sets.
You know,

408
00:26:09.541 --> 00:26:10.374
maybe it's 30,

409
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:15.440
maybe even more is you're going to do as set and you only going to do about half

410
00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:19.020
the repetitions that you are capable of.
So for example,

411
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:23.570
you've picked up a particular river,
you start squeezing it and uh,

412
00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:28.740
you probably could do it 10 times,
but you only do five and you put it down.

413
00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:33.540
Let's say you later on pick up a gripper that's a little heavier.

414
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:35.400
Maybe you could do three reps with it,

415
00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:40.610
but you do all one and in this particular manner you accumulate to reps and you

416
00:26:41.101 --> 00:26:46.080
keep going and going and going and everybody tells you that's impossible to get

417
00:26:46.081 --> 00:26:47.340
strong in this particular manner.

418
00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:52.290
Yet science and experience shows that this makes you strong.

419
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.150
These makes you strong as fast.

420
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.940
This makes you a strong in a safe manner and this makes it,

421
00:26:56.941 --> 00:26:59.430
you can apply this particular methodology.
Again,

422
00:26:59.431 --> 00:27:02.850
I go through the group to any strength,

423
00:27:02.851 --> 00:27:05.160
exercise or any strength endurance exercise.

424
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.250
Just to give you an example of its effectiveness.
My father in law,

425
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:13.110
former marine at the age of 64 started following this routine.

426
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.560
He was able to do about 10 kilometers at that point in several months,

427
00:27:16.561 --> 00:27:21.360
he was up to 20 what he tested and he could not do that mini as a young jarhead,

428
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:25.860
so a young bucks out there,
you can definitely get this done.

429
00:27:25.861 --> 00:27:29.610
So this is how you guys are going to train your grip with these grippers carry

430
00:27:29.611 --> 00:27:31.200
through with you throughout the day.

431
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.900
You're not going to get sweaty just whenever you feel like it,

432
00:27:33.901 --> 00:27:38.430
just take it out and squeeze.
As for training your abdomen,

433
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.860
there are many different methods of training the abdomen,

434
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:44.370
but you have to abide by the following the rules.

435
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:49.440
You have to keep the repetitions to five and under.
No more than five reps.

436
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:54.660
Anything more than five reps is bodybuilding and you need to make a focus

437
00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:59.680
intention like Nick Leeka focused on contraction as opposed to on reps and

438
00:28:00.121 --> 00:28:02.940
fatigue.
Just to give you an example of the plank,

439
00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:07.350
the plank isn't kind of a fashionable exercise in the core training circles,

440
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:10.470
and by the way,
we don't use the word core that's thrown first.

441
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.230
Why don't we use the word cord because,
well,

442
00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.840
because people will use the word cord.
They do things we don't like.

443
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.870
We don't like it all.
So we just say,

444
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:23.370
we just say it's action.
And uh,
so the plaque,

445
00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.550
so traditionally they would put you in the plank and you were supposed to stay

446
00:28:26.551 --> 00:28:28.140
in displaying for a couple of minutes.

447
00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.930
And what's happening is you see this poor person who cannot have an assumed that

448
00:28:32.931 --> 00:28:37.830
proper posture to start with.
And then as fatigue sets in,
uh,

449
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:41.100
other muscles,
wrong muscles start kicking in,
the back starts arching,

450
00:28:41.101 --> 00:28:45.330
the bus starts shooting up.
And what you're doing is what Greg Cook,
Kohl's,

451
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:47.040
putting fitness on top of dysfunction.

452
00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:52.920
And what we do instead is if we do a plank who called the hardstyle plank,

453
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:57.900
we would do a blank for no longer than 10 seconds.
And when you do the plank,

454
00:28:57.901 --> 00:29:02.360
you try to contract everything.
Absolutely everything.
When a,

455
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.270
it showed that,
uh,
everything's hiding this shins,
your forearms,
your neck,

456
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:09.810
everything,
everything but your neck and face.
Everything below your neck,

457
00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:13.380
you're going to contract.
It's not for folks with high blood pressure,

458
00:29:13.381 --> 00:29:16.680
heart condition.
And that's true for pretty much any type of training.

459
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:21.300
But for everybody else,
an extremely powerful tool.
So you get down at a plank,

460
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:25.680
you make fists,
okay?
You can attract your apps,
you can track your glutes,

461
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:27.150
you can track your entire body.

462
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.360
You pretend that somebody is walking into work by and kick you in the ribs,

463
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:35.190
which again,
somebody might at at least of my course and uh,

464
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:38.760
Andrew Bolton and other top power lifters do.
And I've taught this technique.

465
00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:42.130
They swear by this because this is,
they have Donald training for strengths.

466
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.640
This is not just some nonsense that you do cranking out the Reps.

467
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:48.070
So to sum up your abdominal training,

468
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.220
find whatever abdominal exercises that you like.

469
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:55.840
It can be the plank youth can be some kind of a set up.

470
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:59.500
It can be something from your book,
the four hour body.

471
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:02.230
It can be something from my book,
the hardstyle ABS.

472
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.600
It can be something else that's not important as long as it's a good exercise

473
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:10.090
that has been recognized that it does work.
And three times a week,

474
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:15.220
do three to five sets of three to five Reps.
Okay folks,

475
00:30:15.221 --> 00:30:18.700
just remember this.
Three to five sets of three to five reps.

476
00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:23.800
Focus in contraction,
don't focus on fatigue,
dual focus on the reps.

477
00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.670
And I promise if you do these two things for several months,

478
00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.840
you work your grip in this matter.
You work your abs in this matter.

479
00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:36.070
Everything that you do today is going to be stronger.
I don't care what it is,

480
00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.970
it's a bigger deadlift is a tennis serve.
It makes no difference.

481
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:41.140
You are going to be stronger.

482
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:46.310
<v 0>And in the case of the,
the APP,
let's just the,
the,</v>

483
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.840
the midsection and we're working with the plank.

484
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:53.860
If people decided they were going to keep it simple just so they can remember it

485
00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:58.180
and do three sets of three reps three times a week,
let's just say Monday.

486
00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:03.640
<v 3>Loves do just three sets of 10 seconds.
Got It.
10 seconds,
10 seconds.</v>

487
00:31:03.641 --> 00:31:08.170
Three times a week.
Yes.
And tried to contract everything below your neck.
Got It.

488
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:11.640
<v 0>And,
um,
I just as a,</v>

489
00:31:11.641 --> 00:31:15.600
as further exhibit exhibit a,
uh,
I've always had an,

490
00:31:15.601 --> 00:31:17.880
I'd be curious to dissect this just for a second,

491
00:31:17.881 --> 00:31:21.720
but I've always had difficulty with pull ups.

492
00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:26.370
I have a relatively strong pull from say the floor,
um,

493
00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:30.300
in large part thanks to wrestling and other types of strength training,

494
00:31:30.301 --> 00:31:34.980
but also the barrier Ross protocol when it comes to pulling myself up to a bar

495
00:31:34.981 --> 00:31:38.430
though.
Uh,
I can,
I can use wait for low repetitions,

496
00:31:38.431 --> 00:31:41.820
but I've never been able to do higher repetitions very well.

497
00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.860
And I did this greasing the groove,

498
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:49.100
walking around San Francisco for a few a weeks where anytime I past construction

499
00:31:49.381 --> 00:31:53.790
scaffolding
I would jump up.
And,

500
00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:56.610
uh,
there are enough crazy people in San Francisco.

501
00:31:56.611 --> 00:32:00.270
Fortunately or unfortunately that it didn't really raise any eyebrows,
were like,

502
00:32:00.271 --> 00:32:02.400
oh,
it's just some crazy guy doing pull ups with a backpack,
whatever.

503
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:07.050
And I would do a two or three bullets and then I'd just continue on my way.

504
00:32:07.051 --> 00:32:11.850
And it was,
it was astonishing.
Uh,
I didn't really test my Max,

505
00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:14.340
uh,
repetitions,
but how,

506
00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.700
how much my velocity,
I guess my,

507
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.410
the equivalent of bar speed increased over that period of time.

508
00:32:21.411 --> 00:32:25.740
I mean I really became much,
much more explosive.
It was,
it was just astonishing.

509
00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:27.140
And uh,

510
00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:31.440
but for people who have perhaps trouble with higher repetition pullups,

511
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:33.090
how would you troubleshoot that?

512
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:38.480
<v 3>Well,
to me,
I guess first of all depends on high repetitions mean if it's,</v>

513
00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:40.520
if your is 20 or 25

514
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:43.790
<v 4>trickle ups.
Yeah,
let's,
let's use then.
Yes.</v>

515
00:32:43.791 --> 00:32:47.960
That's one thing because if you go beyond that and in Russian,

516
00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:51.320
in Russia they even have specialized competition cause what they do strict

517
00:32:51.321 --> 00:32:53.150
gloves for some crazy insane wraps.

518
00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:58.480
Then training becomes so weird and so state of the art then you better not even

519
00:32:59.541 --> 00:33:02.270
bother.
But most people don't need to do that.

520
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:06.140
So if you want to be able to do 20 or 25 pull ups,

521
00:33:06.141 --> 00:33:08.630
you can achieve that level purely by training your strength,

522
00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:13.310
which means that you never even have to do more than five or ramps and training.

523
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:17.930
And just whenever you go out and test,
then you're going to get those reps.
Sure.

524
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.540
Something years in note about strength,
endurance,

525
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:25.990
the more resistance that you're overcoming in your endurance effort,

526
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:30.170
the more strength helps.
So what does that mean?

527
00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.040
It means that if you're a strong,
that is,

528
00:33:34.041 --> 00:33:38.510
let's say you have a good dentist that's going to help you carry beer kegs to

529
00:33:38.511 --> 00:33:41.210
the second floor.
But on the other hand,

530
00:33:41.211 --> 00:33:46.010
it's not necessarily going to help you,
um,
hammering a nail old day,

531
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:49.640
if that makes any sense.
Rico's hammers,
light beer kegs are heavy.

532
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.820
So when you're doing at 25 repetition effort,

533
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:58.190
the weight is significant.
It's so significant percentage of your one rep Max,

534
00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:01.970
so that can be bumped up your religious by,
by getting stronger.

535
00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:07.390
So that'd be my recommendation for people who have a hard time doing pull ups to

536
00:34:08.841 --> 00:34:12.120
start with.
I would recommend,
uh,

537
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:16.340
start by learning to get tight through their apps.
That's very important.

538
00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:20.280
There was an article a couple of years ago saying that women cannot do pull up

539
00:34:20.281 --> 00:34:24.070
switches out of course is absolutely nonsense.
Uh,

540
00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:28.670
in strong first organization,
we have some ladies who can do,
uh,
you know,

541
00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.400
we have a lady in Boston,
uh,

542
00:34:31.401 --> 00:34:36.401
Amanda Perry who can do strict dead hang 14 pullups neck to the bar.

543
00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.460
So the way we do pull ups,
there's no kipping,

544
00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.240
no swinging pause in between on the bottom and you have to touch your neck to

545
00:34:44.241 --> 00:34:46.850
the bar so she can do 14,
for example.

546
00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:52.200
<v 0>So she's in my,
I'm the last one,
much better men than most of the men.</v>

547
00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:56.260
And just the way just for those people who have not tried this,

548
00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:58.930
having gone through some of this training with Paul,

549
00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:01.630
if you have just done,

550
00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:05.950
if the difference between doing a strict pullup or what you envisioned to be a

551
00:35:05.951 --> 00:35:10.720
strict pull up where you kind of throw your chin up above the bar height versus

552
00:35:10.721 --> 00:35:14.450
pulling in to touch your neck slowly to the bar.

553
00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:19.420
It is so different as to it's not a difference in degree.

554
00:35:19.421 --> 00:35:22.870
It's sort of a difference in species.
Uh,
but anyway,

555
00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:28.540
I challenge,
I challenge everyone to try it.
It's really challenging.

556
00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:30.620
<v 4>Well,
it's a,
for people who offer,</v>

557
00:35:30.621 --> 00:35:33.910
people have a hard time just to get started and pull ups.
And again,

558
00:35:33.911 --> 00:35:35.890
that's true for some ladies.
Many ladies.

559
00:35:35.891 --> 00:35:37.740
That's true for a number of gentlemen as well.

560
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.430
A lot of the problem is they're unable to contract their abdominals strongly

561
00:35:41.431 --> 00:35:45.030
enough.
They are enabled to even assume the strong posture.

562
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:48.900
I remember I told you earlier that I reverse engineer with a strong people do

563
00:35:48.901 --> 00:35:49.734
naturally.

564
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.800
So if you watch a gymnast perform any kind of maneuvers in their rings,

565
00:35:52.801 --> 00:35:55.620
let's say you will see something called the hollow position.

566
00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:59.280
So what's the hollow position?
The hollow position is,
uh,

567
00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:04.280
the body is like your tail talk 10 and your body kind of forms a,

568
00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:07.350
it's like a dish.
Your body looks like a dish pretty much.

569
00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.500
So if you want to learn to do clubs first,

570
00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:15.060
you need to master the hollow position.
It's very easy for you to type in it,

571
00:36:15.061 --> 00:36:18.960
type it into your search engine,
the hollow position,
find a picture,

572
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:23.550
see what it looks like,
and just practices.
Hollow position is Hollow Rock,

573
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.130
listened to action,
says gold to hollow rock.

574
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:28.680
I explained it into my book hardstyle labs,

575
00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.290
but I'm sure you can find it anywhere else.

576
00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:36.410
And so you practice is hollow rock and this hollow rock is going to not only

577
00:36:37.381 --> 00:36:38.940
strengthen your abs,

578
00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:43.140
but it's also going to teach you how to acquire that position.

579
00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:47.730
And that after that you can start working with assisted reps.

580
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.760
And that's a very big difference.
We're not talking about negatives,

581
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:53.970
we're not talking about four straps.
We're talking about assistance reps,

582
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:56.070
assistant reps.
So what's the difference?

583
00:36:56.790 --> 00:37:01.790
The differences and assisted rep feels like a moderately challenging rep that

584
00:37:02.911 --> 00:37:03.744
you do on your own.

585
00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:08.460
So your training partner or your trainer is going to push it in your mid back

586
00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:13.170
and enable you to do that with some degree of difficulty,

587
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.700
but definitely not make his struggle.

588
00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:20.340
And when they've done a study on young gymnast years ago and the Soviet Union

589
00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:24.060
and they use this type of methodology that cold it,

590
00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:29.180
artificial controlling environment where the partner allows you to do a perfect

591
00:37:29.611 --> 00:37:32.670
repetition but in a way that doesn't really kill you.

592
00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:34.290
It doesn't make your struggle.

593
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.700
They fall in that the speed with which the progress was absolutely remarkable.

594
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:44.330
So practicing your hollow rock and don't forget your grip and then start three

595
00:37:46.231 --> 00:37:50.370
times a week with the help of your training partner do let's say it's three to

596
00:37:50.371 --> 00:37:54.000
five sets of three to five reps of assistant assisted pull ups.

597
00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.910
And I just want to reiterate again,
the low reps are key guys.

598
00:37:57.270 --> 00:38:00.780
If you want to be strong,
you need to keep your reps at five and under

599
00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:05.880
<v 0>and at at five reps are under is what you're really working on.</v>

600
00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.150
Sort of the it's,

601
00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:11.190
and that I'll get out of my depth and into yours pretty quickly,

602
00:38:11.191 --> 00:38:13.860
but the sort of neural pathways in their recruit,

603
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:18.660
the recruitment of motor neurons and uh,
sort of firing capabilities and so on.

604
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.260
<v 4>Pretty much you were going to have,</v>

605
00:38:20.261 --> 00:38:23.700
you're going to have a high level of neural adaptations and uh,

606
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:26.230
you are all sort going to build some muscle as well.

607
00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:29.740
So you're going to build a high threshold motor units as well.
But not,

608
00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:33.070
it's not a bodybuilding protocol.
You will build some muscle,

609
00:38:33.071 --> 00:38:37.390
but it's not really the end Dan goal itself.
So,
uh,

610
00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.810
you were trying to also,
you're trying to avoid the fatigue.

611
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:44.950
You're trying to avoid the burn because whenever I start experiencing the burn,

612
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.010
that's from something called the hydrogen ions,

613
00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:50.020
that bleeds to whole lot of problems for you.

614
00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:55.560
So one of the problems is it interferes with the command that your brain's sends

615
00:38:56.141 --> 00:38:57.430
to the muscle to contract.

616
00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:01.450
And another problem that it creates these hydrogen ions,
literal or destructive.

617
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:04.000
So if you leave them around the muscle for too long,

618
00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:08.680
they really start destroying your muscle.
So just keep those reps under.

619
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:12.460
And a five,
three to five,
don't worry about getting bulky,

620
00:39:12.461 --> 00:39:14.260
are not going to get blockades.
It's not going to happen.

621
00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:17.950
And a approach your training as a practice.

622
00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:20.040
So this is another very important point,
Tim.

623
00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:23.790
<v 0>I hate the super important point.
No,
I'm glad you're bringing this up.</v>

624
00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:25.220
<v 4>I hate the word workouts.</v>

625
00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:28.370
The award workout does not exist in the Russian language.

626
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:33.790
We talk about a training session or would talk about it a lesson we never talked

627
00:39:33.881 --> 00:39:38.670
about a workout.
Just sync of what does the word working out,
what is it,

628
00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:39.560
what do you envision?

629
00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:42.460
<v 0>Sweating and grunting and</v>

630
00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:47.110
<v 4>the CLSC.
Let's see how much I can punish myself and draining myself.</v>

631
00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.860
So the goal is not to get stronger.
The goal is just to get,
get worn out.

632
00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:55.960
And there are simpler ways of doing that.
Drawing up the mountain.
Okay.
So no,

633
00:39:55.961 --> 00:40:00.310
the idea here is practice strength is a skill and as such it must be practiced.

634
00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.230
And if you approach it in this matter,

635
00:40:02.231 --> 00:40:04.360
not only you're going to get stronger so much faster,

636
00:40:04.361 --> 00:40:07.420
but you get a truly enjoy your training process.
Training.

637
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.310
It should be something that should be enjoyed.

638
00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:13.450
<v 0>No,
I this,
this,
this ring,
so true to me.</v>

639
00:40:13.451 --> 00:40:18.150
And it was really a revelation just coming from the masochistic,
uh,

640
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:22.390
world of the few sports that I practiced in a certainly did not get to a world

641
00:40:22.391 --> 00:40:27.150
class level,
but competed on a national level in a few different sports.
And the,

642
00:40:27.151 --> 00:40:32.151
the mind shift from a depleting your reservoir or reserves as much as possible

643
00:40:33.401 --> 00:40:36.510
to identifying the skills and practicing them even if it,

644
00:40:36.511 --> 00:40:39.190
if you feel better at the end of a workout than at the beginning,

645
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:42.620
was really a huge shift for me in a few places.
Uh,

646
00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.950
certainly in strength training,
I think that,
uh,
you know,

647
00:40:44.951 --> 00:40:49.951
Barry Ross's protocol was eyeopening in so much as just like you mentioned,

648
00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:53.370
put a hundred,
I think it was around 120.

649
00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:56.350
This is all detailed in the four hour body.
So I'd,
I'm losing the specifics,

650
00:40:56.351 --> 00:40:59.930
but about about 120 pounds on my Max deadlift through them,

651
00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.190
through the full range of motion,
not just the range in which we were practicing,

652
00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.513
uh,

653
00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:09.660
in a short period of time and gained fewer than 10 pounds of additional muscle.

654
00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:14.470
And you probably had judge your training.
Loved it.
Oh,
is it was just amazing.

655
00:41:14.471 --> 00:41:16.540
I mean,
felt on fire.
I mean,
partially because you're,

656
00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:21.080
you're blowing a fog horn into your nervous system's ear when you do it.
Uh,

657
00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:24.140
but the,
the,
the other area,
and I think this,

658
00:41:24.141 --> 00:41:29.141
this is such a fantastic principle that applies to so many different areas was

659
00:41:29.171 --> 00:41:30.910
in the world of swimming.
And,
uh,

660
00:41:30.911 --> 00:41:34.850
some people might recall if they followed my stuff for a while that I was not

661
00:41:34.851 --> 00:41:39.090
able to swim a lap in a proper pool,
uh,

662
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.900
until I was in my thirties.
And what,

663
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:46.930
what really shifted the mindset completely was going from swimming workouts and,

664
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:51.320
and hiring coaches who viewed it that way,

665
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:56.030
to looking at total immersion where they really focus on the skill of

666
00:41:56.031 --> 00:41:58.610
deconstructing the biomechanics of swimming,

667
00:41:58.611 --> 00:42:01.640
challenging the assumptions of how swimming's taught.

668
00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:05.660
And it became this really joyful,
wonderful experience.

669
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:10.720
And I was able to go from a biscuit zero lapse to sort of 20 laps per practice

670
00:42:11.511 --> 00:42:13.280
in less than 10 days.
So it's,

671
00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:16.610
it's such an important shift and I'm glad you brought it up,
which,

672
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:20.840
which kind of leads me to the next,
uh,
the next question that,

673
00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.480
and it's about prioritization.
So when people think of fitness,
uh,

674
00:42:24.481 --> 00:42:26.270
particularly nonathletes,

675
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:31.280
I think that there tends to be very scattershot approach and there's a paradox

676
00:42:31.281 --> 00:42:33.420
of choice challenge that they have where they're,

677
00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:38.440
they're fed a lot of recommendations from many different people and they have

678
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:44.360
strength at,
let's just talk this strength,
not necessarily muscle gain,

679
00:42:44.361 --> 00:42:46.940
but just getting stronger.
They have hypertrophy.

680
00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:52.070
So increasing there is a muscular size,
for lack of a better description,

681
00:42:52.071 --> 00:42:56.750
endurance,
flexibility.
How would you rank these in order of priority and why?

682
00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:03.890
<v 4>As long as the person has their required mobility and symmetry,</v>

683
00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:08.340
the priority is always an health did.
Priority's always strengths.

684
00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.350
Strengths has to be at first.

685
00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:14.370
So the first step that you do is you assess your mobility.

686
00:43:14.371 --> 00:43:18.510
You find a specialist who can do that.
Fms would be,

687
00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.090
fms would be recommendation of mine.

688
00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:24.690
Very Kooks FM as functional movement screen functional movement screen is going

689
00:43:24.691 --> 00:43:28.380
to find out how mobile you are and also how symmetrical you are.

690
00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.590
So as long as that is dialed in,
that is in place,

691
00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:36.740
you have to get strong and strength is the mother quality of all physical

692
00:43:37.201 --> 00:43:39.240
qualities and that's not a statement by me.

693
00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:42.560
That's a statement by my fist I'm about to be the father of fertilization,

694
00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:47.580
one of the greatest sports scientists ever and greater strength increases your

695
00:43:48.511 --> 00:43:53.460
performance in absolutely everything so you can see of course,

696
00:43:53.461 --> 00:43:54.300
okay,
of course,

697
00:43:54.301 --> 00:43:58.240
yet being stronger as get them help you and let's say punching somebody harder,

698
00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:00.820
lifting something,
but how is that going to help me?

699
00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:02.580
You find let's say a triathlete.

700
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.340
How's that going to help me find that marathon runner?

701
00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:08.250
It is going to help you in several different ways.

702
00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:13.230
One is the perceived level of exertion is going to go down.

703
00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:18.090
Several years ago in our regions did a very interesting study where they put a

704
00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:20.490
elite endurance athletes,

705
00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:25.700
some more bicyclists sound were runners on at pure strength regimen does four

706
00:44:27.781 --> 00:44:29.970
sets or four reps of heavy squats.

707
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:34.650
It's about as strength is against and in the end of the study,

708
00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:39.630
not surprisingly,
all these guys were stronger.
They could jump higher and so on,

709
00:44:39.631 --> 00:44:42.690
but they were not impressed with that.
That didn't matter to them.

710
00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.900
What did impress them is there ran faster,

711
00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:51.480
there are times their race times went down because strengths just makes,

712
00:44:51.481 --> 00:44:55.890
enables everything else.
If you were trying to,
let's say,

713
00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.880
lose weight being stronger is going to help you do that because you're going to

714
00:44:59.881 --> 00:45:02.490
have,
uh,
you can have,
have a bigger furnace,

715
00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:04.140
you're going to train yourself much harder.

716
00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:07.110
And the exercises that are fat loss exercises,

717
00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:10.890
so it really doesn't matter what it is that you're trying to achieve.

718
00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:14.940
Strength is the number one attribute you need to address.

719
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.340
And that's why my company's called strong first.

720
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.310
<v 0>You know,
I love,</v>

721
00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:25.840
I love that you,
one of the things that I love about you Pablo,

722
00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:30.380
is that you see what you mean and mean what you say.
And I,
I just,
it,
there's a,

723
00:45:30.381 --> 00:45:34.070
there's a,
there's a degree of clarity that I,
I envy and uh,

724
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:37.610
I might include it for people,
but the,
when we did our sound check,

725
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:39.260
I asked you to do,

726
00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:42.470
to give me an answer so we can test the audio of what you had for breakfast and

727
00:45:42.471 --> 00:45:46.760
what was your answer?
Coffee.
And that was it.
That was the soundcheck.

728
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:50.000
I love this,
the simplicity.
Now,

729
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:55.270
speaking of simplicity and also a sort of undoing the confusion that a lot of

730
00:45:55.281 --> 00:45:57.050
people suffer from,
what are,

731
00:45:57.051 --> 00:46:02.051
what are the most counterproductive myths or misconceptions about strength

732
00:46:02.991 --> 00:46:04.340
training that come to mind?

733
00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:05.811
<v 4>Well,</v>

734
00:46:05.811 --> 00:46:10.811
the number one team I guess is the idea that you have to go to failure every

735
00:46:11.571 --> 00:46:12.670
time you trade.
Right?

736
00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:17.040
And I can tell you one thing that is so good to weightlifters.

737
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.460
I have done a very thorough analysis of the student weightlifting methodology

738
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:25.220
from through the sixties through the eighties the Laura days.

739
00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:30.790
And I've found that they typically did one third to two third of maximal

740
00:46:33.621 --> 00:46:37.010
repetitions per set.
So what does it mean you flood stayed this,

741
00:46:37.011 --> 00:46:39.880
you're using a way that's your 10 rep,
Max Tendonitis.

742
00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.840
All you could do if you push yourself very hard,

743
00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.650
they would do three to six consistently.

744
00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:48.020
Now you'd probably ask yourself,
okay,

745
00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:53.030
I'm not a weight lifter and what does this still get stuff from the eighties

746
00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:56.990
have to do with today?
Well,
two things.
First of all,

747
00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:59.930
even though a person who is not at lifting athlete,

748
00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:04.610
it's not going to train exactly as a weightlifter a power lifter.
Nevertheless,

749
00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:09.530
the methodology has to be derived from the sports because these are specialists

750
00:47:09.531 --> 00:47:13.220
strength sports,
so it they just have to be adapted to your needs.

751
00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:14.540
Second of all,

752
00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:19.280
the this particular is so good methodology is still superior to this day.

753
00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:20.750
This is very interesting,

754
00:47:20.751 --> 00:47:25.370
but if you keep hearing about all this new world records set in the sport of

755
00:47:25.371 --> 00:47:26.204
weightlifting,

756
00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:31.690
well if you compare the world records today to the world records of the 80s you

757
00:47:32.411 --> 00:47:37.411
will see then in most cases the records today are inferior to Rutgers in the 80s

758
00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:39.183
how can that be?

759
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:44.670
They accuse people of doing drugs and they changed weight classes twice since

760
00:47:45.971 --> 00:47:48.430
the 80s.
Of course.
It's so wonderful.

761
00:47:48.431 --> 00:47:50.710
I'm so happy that today nobody does drugs anymore.

762
00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:51.763
<v 0>Just terrific.</v>

763
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:59.110
<v 4>If you look at,
if you look at the lifts performed by sort of,
you have lift her,</v>

764
00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:03.310
you would have provided by neon in 1980 at the Moscow Olympics.

765
00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:06.160
This lifts have never been exceeded.

766
00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:08.890
These lives have never been approached.

767
00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:13.210
So this particular methodology does work extremely well.

768
00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.950
It's still the best methodology period.

769
00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:19.530
Later on in the store we had power lifting team adopted this methodology for

770
00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:23.980
part of the thing with tremendous success that dominate and uh,

771
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:29.400
these same particular methodology has been adopted to bodyweight training,

772
00:48:29.531 --> 00:48:31.600
Kettlebell press is and so on and so forth.

773
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:35.380
So it's the same thing to come up life for everybody because this is principle

774
00:48:35.381 --> 00:48:36.214
based training.

775
00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:41.490
So the major misconception is that you have to go to failure.

776
00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:47.760
So that's if you just overcome that and if you make it a habit to do one third

777
00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:52.600
to two third of the repetitions that are possible and do more sets.

778
00:48:52.601 --> 00:48:56.320
Instead you are going to make much grid to progress.

779
00:48:56.590 --> 00:49:00.130
You're going to do much safer and folks are going to enjoy your training.

780
00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:03.120
<v 0>And how do,</v>

781
00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:08.150
how does the approach shift if your focus is a maximal hypertrophy,

782
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:14.230
<v 4>if you're after maximum hypertrophy is volume.</v>

783
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:18.280
So they figured out in the Soviet Union that there's a direct correlation

784
00:49:18.281 --> 00:49:21.850
between volume and a hypertrophy.

785
00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:23.770
She just pretty much have to do more sets.

786
00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:26.350
You're going to have to do more sets in there,

787
00:49:26.351 --> 00:49:31.351
like 60 to 70% of your max range and a whole bunch of sets of five and six does

788
00:49:31.541 --> 00:49:35.560
many of them.
And your rest periods might be compressed a little more.

789
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:39.370
But that's it.
If you do that,
do this a couple of times a week.

790
00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:43.240
Many sets of five or six don't want to worry about how many,

791
00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:47.650
just just keep going.
Don't kill yourself,
enjoy yourself,
uh,

792
00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:50.760
eat more,
you're going to get bigger.
It's unavoidable.

793
00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:51.760
It's just as simple as that.

794
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.810
<v 0>I've of course I've,
I've spoken to with,
uh,</v>

795
00:49:58.050 --> 00:50:01.350
with fans and written about the APP,

796
00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:05.700
the applications of to failure training for primarily hypertrophy just because

797
00:50:05.701 --> 00:50:05.901
you're,

798
00:50:05.901 --> 00:50:10.901
you're doing so much with the sarcoplasmic him and maximizing the sort of a

799
00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:15.760
cellular volume,
uh,
that the,

800
00:50:15.761 --> 00:50:20.720
the challenge is not so much the training with hypertrophy.
It's the eating.
Uh,

801
00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:25.760
it's just,
I mean,
you really,
you feel like the,
the,

802
00:50:25.761 --> 00:50:28.370
the Japanese hot dog Kobayashi after awhile,

803
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:32.540
it's just waking up in the middle of the night to eat meals and whatnot.
It's,
uh,

804
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.900
that,
that's by far the most punishing aspect of,
for me at least

805
00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:41.080
<v 4>it is dumb.
It is.
And uh,
any tricks there,
nobody knows.
Also,
nobody knows.</v>

806
00:50:41.081 --> 00:50:44.380
Yeah,
there are a couple of tricks,
but there,
no,
I'll mention them in a second.

807
00:50:44.381 --> 00:50:48.370
Yeah.
Nobody does know exactly what happens in the cellular level when you try to

808
00:50:48.371 --> 00:50:53.080
stimulate muscle hypertrophy.
Anybody who tells you that they know they,
you know,

809
00:50:53.110 --> 00:50:56.440
it's just a speculation.
At best.
There were a number of theories.

810
00:50:56.441 --> 00:50:58.750
Some of the theories are more credible than others,

811
00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:04.260
but the fact is we still do not know.
And what makes this Soviet,
uh,

812
00:51:04.410 --> 00:51:09.400
weight lifting methodology of the eighties so spectacular is that was a purely

813
00:51:09.401 --> 00:51:10.600
empirical methodology.

814
00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:14.740
They tried to explain what happens in the southern level,

815
00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:15.910
but they didn't try too hard.

816
00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:19.960
It was pretty much a trial and error that would analyze the training logs of

817
00:51:19.961 --> 00:51:22.810
successful lifters and successful competitions.

818
00:51:23.350 --> 00:51:25.450
They analyze this data,

819
00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:28.060
they made recommendations and there's kind of a chicken and egg.

820
00:51:28.061 --> 00:51:31.060
Where does this start?
Scientist watching what the best lifters do,

821
00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:34.570
what the best lifters divided scientists telling the best lifters want to do.

822
00:51:34.930 --> 00:51:38.480
It was kind of both and they kept narrowing down,
narrowing down,

823
00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:40.420
narrowing it down.
And this is how it works.

824
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:43.570
But we still don't know exactly what happens there.

825
00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:47.120
<v 0>What is your,
I want to,
I definitely want to touch on the,</v>

826
00:51:47.121 --> 00:51:51.280
the tricks for not making yourself nauseous all day when you're trying to,

827
00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:55.060
to pack on pounds of muscle.
But before that,

828
00:51:55.061 --> 00:51:57.130
what is your favorite pet theory,

829
00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:03.060
even if its speculative at this point,
what is your preferred theory?
Uh,

830
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:04.360
for muscular growth.

831
00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.033
<v 4>Okay.</v>

832
00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:10.210
If I think about passing cause theory makes most sense to me.

833
00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:15.640
And according to this theory,
when the muscle comes,

834
00:52:15.641 --> 00:52:19.180
the contraction comes to an end or close to an end.

835
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:23.680
When you have depleted the creatine phosphate in the muscle,

836
00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:28.270
that's the primary stimulus for hypertrophy according to him.
And again,

837
00:52:28.271 --> 00:52:29.500
what could that possibly,
well,

838
00:52:29.501 --> 00:52:34.501
how could that possibly do in if the muscle contractions stops not as a result

839
00:52:36.401 --> 00:52:39.070
of mounting acidity.
And that's very,
very important.

840
00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:43.180
But as a result of there's simply not enough creatine phosphate,

841
00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:46.000
supposedly the,
uh,

842
00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:49.420
cross bridges no longer can really disengage properly.

843
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:51.410
So supposedly,
right?

844
00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:53.410
<v 0>Crossbridges you're talking about the mindset.</v>

845
00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:57.940
<v 4>That's right.
Yep.
So bowls ugly.
This is what terrorism apart to Bozo,</v>

846
00:52:57.950 --> 00:53:01.960
that's what causes the microtrauma that makes us satellite cells do their thing.

847
00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:07.510
So that's one fair.
The credible explanation.
I don't know if this is true or not,

848
00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:12.870
but training in my experience that,

849
00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:15.970
but that since got,
but that's when it goes approach to training.

850
00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:19.720
Were you going to hit it pretty hard?
Uh,

851
00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:23.530
this set would probably be about 20,
30 seconds in duration.

852
00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:28.140
If you're trying to target your highest potential motor units and then you're

853
00:53:28.141 --> 00:53:32.100
going to have to stop and you have to rest a long time between the,

854
00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:36.780
between the sets.
So this,
it does make a lot of sense.

855
00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:41.550
There was another theory that works fairly well with it.

856
00:53:42.110 --> 00:53:46.050
Uh,
professor Victosa,
Leanna according to him,

857
00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:51.800
the role of creating a phosphate here is once you deplete your creatine

858
00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:54.930
phosphate and you do have a lot of free period,

859
00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.180
which is pretty much byproduct.

860
00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:02.660
What that does is makes the membrane of the cell permeable to the hormones,

861
00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:06.160
anabolic hormones.
Very interesting.
So what's hill?

862
00:54:06.161 --> 00:54:09.660
Yanno says there are four prerequisites to muscle hypertrophy.

863
00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:13.680
One is obvious is a,
that's the presence of amino acids.

864
00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:17.820
The second is the presence of anabolic hormones,

865
00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:21.570
which obviously has to do with the capacity we are and the current system,

866
00:54:21.571 --> 00:54:25.590
but also your training as well.
Training stress,
does it seem to do that.

867
00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:31.020
And third is the presence of Free Kreatin as the,
again,

868
00:54:31.021 --> 00:54:33.500
the same thing that free creates and it's a lot of recruiting.

869
00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:37.050
This forums when the muscles pushed hard but not before it gets a city.

870
00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:42.570
And finally the fourth one is,
uh,
the presence of hydrogen ions.
Not,

871
00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:46.970
not for too long.
So I get hydrogen ions.
It's again,
it's uh,

872
00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:50.460
something that you get out of muscle contraction animals or contraction.

873
00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:56.120
And the service that they do for muscle hypertrophy according to see young of,

874
00:54:56.520 --> 00:55:00.210
is just like the free creating.
They make the membrane permeable to the hormones.

875
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:03.900
So then,
uh,
then what happens is this hormones,

876
00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:06.180
which are pretty much messengers,

877
00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:09.900
they go into the cell and as they go into the cell,
they had good,

878
00:55:09.901 --> 00:55:12.180
the whole process of transcription,
translation,
you know,

879
00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:17.210
protein synthesis going the also the very interesting element of a single young

880
00:55:18.850 --> 00:55:23.850
of theory and Celiac was methodology and against something that sits well with

881
00:55:24.181 --> 00:55:26.700
me.
I'm having observed training.

882
00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:31.730
Effective training is very long recipe or as between sets.

883
00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:37.850
So it's Juliana fricking mance five to 10 minutes of rest between the sets and

884
00:55:38.011 --> 00:55:41.490
that at rest has to be active.
So you pretty much have to move around.

885
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:45.210
So you don't just,
you don't just sit,
you just move your way of you arms.

886
00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:48.360
You got to shake your muscles,
you shake your legs,
you walk.

887
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:52.880
And that's opposed to good tread of the clear out the hydrogen ions as quickly

888
00:55:52.881 --> 00:55:56.880
as possible because having them there briefly as good,
having there for too long,

889
00:55:56.881 --> 00:56:00.120
it's not good because it literally destructive.
It's a charged particle.

890
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:02.520
That's what it is.
And um,

891
00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:07.620
so they're walking or are they on stationary bikes on like an Arrow?
Diamonds.

892
00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:11.570
You don't need a stationary bike,
you just pretty much want to walk there.

893
00:56:11.571 --> 00:56:14.790
Or there's a particular type of relaxation exercises,
Tim,

894
00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:17.820
we'll call it fast and loose exercises the old Russian athletes do.

895
00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:22.110
So pretty much what the are is if you may remember my Kettlebell certification,

896
00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:25.030
I had people standing kind of shake out the arms and legs,
right?

897
00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.030
So you're just pretty much shake your arms and legs and you just walk around.

898
00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:31.240
That's,
that's pretty much what you do.
So that's,

899
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:35.800
that is a silly Yanas Siri,
which also seems to make sense.

900
00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:39.280
Notice that in both cases where there's protesting that goes there were civil

901
00:56:39.281 --> 00:56:40.090
Yana ups,

902
00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:44.350
you are going to push yourself much closer to failure to rep Max.

903
00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:47.950
So when you're training just for strength,
you don't need to do that.

904
00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:51.970
You just do one third to two thirds of your maximum reps when you're trying to

905
00:56:51.971 --> 00:56:56.260
train for hypertrophy.
Yes,
you can do just simply more setbacks and we'll sets,

906
00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:00.670
but sometimes you just have to push yourself harder not to fail.

907
00:57:00.671 --> 00:57:03.650
There's still but harder and Juliana full.

908
00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:07.960
So it has the most fascinating slow twitch fiber protocol as well.

909
00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:11.320
I'd like to tell your readers about it because there are a lot of misconceptions

910
00:57:11.321 --> 00:57:15.580
about training the slow fibers.
Well if you think about slow fibers as well,

911
00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:19.030
which most people associate with endurance.
Yeah,
exactly.

912
00:57:19.031 --> 00:57:22.140
And they do have endurance.
That's true.
But there are also people think,

913
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:25.750
well they're thin,
they're weak,
they're small.
And why should I do that?

914
00:57:25.810 --> 00:57:29.620
Why would any self-respecting Paul are athletes,
you know,
demeaned himself,

915
00:57:29.621 --> 00:57:33.220
training a slow car.
So,
and uh,

916
00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:36.430
Giuliano has a very different point of view on this.
First of all,

917
00:57:36.431 --> 00:57:40.060
if you look at back in the six in some studies done in the 60s,

918
00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:44.590
if you compare the strengths of your slow fibers and fast ones,
uh,

919
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:47.050
they are just as strong for the same cross section.

920
00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:51.250
So which means that if you have a bundle of slow fibers that's as thick as your

921
00:57:51.251 --> 00:57:55.540
finger and you have a bundle of fast fibers that's as thick as your finger,

922
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:56.860
they're equally strong.

923
00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:00.940
Just this lower bundle is going to have more smaller fibers,

924
00:58:00.941 --> 00:58:03.880
but it doesn't matter number one.
Number two,

925
00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:08.980
because their velocity of contraction for the fast fibers can be 20,
40% higher.

926
00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:12.490
For this slow fibers,
the presumption is,
well,

927
00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:16.300
I need to move fast.
I can't afford that.
So,

928
00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:20.710
but see was work has found out that even in sprint,

929
00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:25.420
50% of the output is provided by slow fibers.
And he says,

930
00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:28.240
even though in vitro,

931
00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:32.950
that may be true that these fibers are contracting faster,
but in Vivo,

932
00:58:32.951 --> 00:58:36.490
in real life and sport activities,
you're not really going to go so fast.

933
00:58:36.491 --> 00:58:39.700
So that's advantages.
No longer,
no longer valid.

934
00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:45.690
He has put experienced sprinters on a training protocol that hypertrophied there

935
00:58:47.921 --> 00:58:52.921
slow fibers and these sprinters improve their sprint 400 meters on every Trump

936
00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:59.800
10.9 seconds to 10.7 just form just from this slow,
fast,

937
00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:01.060
slow fibric hypertrophy.

938
00:59:01.930 --> 00:59:06.550
And there is additional benefits of hyperledger for your slow fibers.

939
00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:08.380
Something we can discuss a little bit later if we talk about,

940
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:10.030
if you choose to talk about endurance,

941
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:14.800
is these slow fibers count pre equipped with Mitochondria,

942
00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:16.570
which means they have a lot of endurance.

943
00:59:16.570 --> 00:59:19.330
So for other types of athletes that can be very beneficial.

944
00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:23.840
So Seattle Yacht has this fascinating training protocol for training,

945
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:28.310
for hypertrophy of slow fibers.
So here's how this goes.

946
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:32.100
He says the biggest problem that you have is typically the people that just try

947
00:59:32.101 --> 00:59:35.630
to go and burn them out.
Well,
but all that does again,

948
00:59:35.631 --> 00:59:39.020
that just the gig comes to an end because of the mounting acidity.

949
00:59:39.050 --> 00:59:40.820
That's not the right stimulus right there.

950
00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:44.300
You want to make sure that you exhausted creatine phosphate and get the free

951
00:59:44.301 --> 00:59:47.360
creative flowing.
So how do you do that?
You create a collusion.

952
00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:51.050
So he would have you do a occlusion.
Yeah.

953
00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:55.180
It means basically shut with the contraction,
prevents the blood flow,
right?

954
00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:57.980
It's a constant tension.
Would bodybuilders would call constant tension.

955
00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:01.250
And what you would do is you would do,
let's say squats,

956
01:00:01.251 --> 01:00:02.690
you go a little bit below parallel,

957
01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:05.030
you go a little bit above parallel and you're going to slow,

958
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:10.450
the timeframe is 30 to 60 seconds that the duration and uh,

959
01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:14.480
you have to counter failure with close to failure.
Now this is again,

960
01:00:14.481 --> 01:00:16.550
this is what's really fascinating after that,

961
01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:20.810
and this is what's so different from the traditional slow twitch training is you

962
01:00:20.811 --> 01:00:24.920
have to take that same five to 10 minutes active rest because he says if you

963
01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:27.470
don't,
that mounting a city is going to mess everything up.

964
01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.930
And on one day a week,

965
01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:35.080
typically you would do four to nine sets in this matter and then three to four

966
01:00:35.721 --> 01:00:39.350
days later you do a second day where you do one,
two,
three sets.

967
01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:42.980
So that's a protocol.
One more time,
super slow movement.
No rest,

968
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:48.650
30 to 60 seconds in duration,
one day a week,
four to nine sets,

969
01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:51.890
three to four days later.
One,
two,
three sets,

970
01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.400
five to 10 minutes of rest in between active rest by the way,

971
01:00:55.401 --> 01:00:57.710
active rest and also mean and work in different muscle groups.

972
01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:02.540
That's very fine as well.
And just to tell you how effective this protocol is,

973
01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:06.440
he put a number of athletes,

974
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:11.360
experienced athletes from different sports on the WHO knew how to squat on a

975
01:01:11.361 --> 01:01:14.810
back squad protocol using these music thing,

976
01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.850
these types of reps and sets and so on.

977
01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:20.660
And in eight weeks these guys increased more than added,

978
01:01:20.661 --> 01:01:24.200
more than 25% of their back squat.
Holy Crap.
Yeah.

979
01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:26.180
And you realize these guys were not these guys,

980
01:01:26.181 --> 01:01:28.790
we're not your typical American college subjects.

981
01:01:28.791 --> 01:01:33.290
You know the guys were very fast thumbs,
you know Facebook people,
no,
I'm talking,

982
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:34.820
I'm talking about athletes

983
01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:43.090
and what percentage of their one rep Max were they using for these 30 to 62nd

984
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:47.450
sets.
Cause that's a,
that's a challenging micro range of movement.

985
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:50.780
The typical guidelines,

986
01:01:50.781 --> 01:01:53.550
you have to find it for yourself because that depends on your boss,

987
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:55.070
on your fiber composition.

988
01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:00.320
Typically it's about 30 to 60% for your lower body and tend to 40% free opera

989
01:02:01.281 --> 01:02:04.400
body.
So why is the difference and the difference is,
uh,

990
01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:08.480
is determined by the fact that your opera bodies more fest bridge.

991
01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:10.980
So if you look at an average person and every,

992
01:02:10.981 --> 01:02:14.990
each person's going to have about 70% fast twitch fibers in the upper body and

993
01:02:14.991 --> 01:02:17.750
lower body,
but 50,
50.
But uh,

994
01:02:17.751 --> 01:02:22.140
so you have to use a weight relatively speaking for the upper body to stay in

995
01:02:22.141 --> 01:02:26.520
that timeframe.
I see.
Got It.
That is it trial and error?
It is just trial it out.

996
01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:27.910
<v 0>No,
of course.
And what would people,</v>

997
01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:31.840
what would you suggest they Google or search for to learn more about this?

998
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:34.980
<v 4>Uh,
nothing I'm afraid,
but I think that's,</v>

999
01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:38.470
<v 0>and that that means don't search for quote nothing.</v>

1000
01:02:38.471 --> 01:02:40.390
I'm afraid that means you can't search for it.

1001
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:43.970
<v 4>They listened very carefully to what I said.</v>

1002
01:02:43.971 --> 01:02:47.240
They should have no problem doing that.
I can give you a couple of exercises.

1003
01:02:47.350 --> 01:02:50.990
Other exercises that you can do.
So for the lower body,
uh,

1004
01:02:51.050 --> 01:02:56.050
you can use the back squats or you can use the front squat and a for the upper

1005
01:02:57.141 --> 01:03:02.030
body you could use something like the diamond pushups for the triceps and what

1006
01:03:02.031 --> 01:03:06.110
you need to do is you need to adjust the difficulty based on adjusted elevation

1007
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:09.670
elevates your hands.
If you want it easier,
elevate your feet.

1008
01:03:09.671 --> 01:03:12.770
Do you want to make it harder?
But again,
the idea is to come to failure.

1009
01:03:12.771 --> 01:03:16.160
It's rooted,
so did to 60 seconds and a for the push up,

1010
01:03:16.161 --> 01:03:19.330
you're going to be working in the new range so you never get to come to lock
out.

1011
01:03:19.550 --> 01:03:21.050
You know,
if we're going to come to the bottom,

1012
01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:25.310
you're going to slowly keep working,
keep working through that mid range.

1013
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:30.590
If you want to do this for the upper body is probably the best idea,

1014
01:03:30.591 --> 01:03:33.020
would be some kind of a rolling machine.
And again,

1015
01:03:33.021 --> 01:03:37.370
you're going to be working it through the mid range or curls,
I hate to say it,

1016
01:03:37.371 --> 01:03:38.300
but she has curls.

1017
01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:43.880
Sulla Yan of Sila Yacht of has been extremely successful with athletes from very

1018
01:03:45.051 --> 01:03:49.370
diverse sports.
Uh,
he's,
uh,
worked with national team for judo,

1019
01:03:49.371 --> 01:03:51.140
Sambo,
uh,

1020
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:54.920
full contact cut out day bicycler racing soccer and these guys who have seen

1021
01:03:54.921 --> 01:03:59.210
terrific,
terrific results from this.
So,
uh,
you guys may want to give it a try.

1022
01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:01.530
<v 0>That's,
yeah,
the,
the,
the fascinating,</v>

1023
01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:04.790
the most unexpected aspect of that for me is the,

1024
01:04:04.810 --> 01:04:09.270
the five to 10 minute rest sets.
That's really fascinating.
And I should also,

1025
01:04:09.271 --> 01:04:12.030
I'd love to underscore one thing for people and please correct me Pablo if I'm

1026
01:04:12.031 --> 01:04:13.470
getting this incorrect,

1027
01:04:13.471 --> 01:04:18.471
but a lot of folks think about the burn as being a product of lactate or lactic

1028
01:04:18.631 --> 01:04:19.081
acid,

1029
01:04:19.081 --> 01:04:24.081
but it's actually a byproduct or a side effect to primary effect of the hydrogen

1030
01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:28.740
ions that you were talking about.
It is.
Um,
and I think that that has a lot of,

1031
01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:31.860
<v 4>there is some swelling and nerve endings are,
yeah.
Yeah.
It doesn't,</v>

1032
01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:33.590
it really folks,
that really doesn't matter.

1033
01:04:33.591 --> 01:04:35.690
The only thing that you need to realize is this,

1034
01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:40.900
on this particular training protocol you go for this barn is burned,

1035
01:04:40.901 --> 01:04:44.390
is needed.
The important thing is that burn is over after 30 to 60 seconds.

1036
01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:46.910
And then you try to good tread of as fast as possible.

1037
01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:51.500
And for other types of training,
if you're trying to train for strength,

1038
01:04:51.830 --> 01:04:55.310
you want to try and to avoid the burden altogether,
the burners,

1039
01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:56.300
the burn is your enemy.

1040
01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:01.640
<v 0>I've to two,
uh,
two questions on the details here.</v>

1041
01:05:01.641 --> 01:05:06.450
The first is if the free creatine,
I guess that's just free creatine in,

1042
01:05:06.451 --> 01:05:09.410
in serum,
uh,
although I could be wrong on that,

1043
01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:14.420
is one of the stimuli,
uh,
that,
that produces the,

1044
01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.770
the training adaptation,

1045
01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:21.160
can you accelerate that or even catalyze it with supplemental use of Creatine

1046
01:05:22.091 --> 01:05:26.350
monohydrate for instance?
Yeah,
absolutely.
Okay.
And then second question,

1047
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:31.300
uh,
is related to the,
uh,

1048
01:05:31.330 --> 01:05:34.960
what some people have called the golden era of steroids,
which was the 80s.
Right?

1049
01:05:34.961 --> 01:05:35.440
So the,

1050
01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:40.440
I guess what I'm very curious to know is why have the why of the Soviets changed

1051
01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:46.190
their approach or what has caused the,
um,

1052
01:05:46.450 --> 01:05:47.050
what is,

1053
01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:51.520
what has prevented them from attaining or surpassing the records of the 80s and

1054
01:05:51.521 --> 01:05:56.230
understood obviously that athletes are still using many different types of

1055
01:05:56.231 --> 01:05:58.870
performance enhancing drugs.
But,
um,

1056
01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:00.760
what has changed or and why did they change it?

1057
01:06:01.550 --> 01:06:06.140
<v 4>Tim,
I think Dan John has said it really well.
It works so well.</v>

1058
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:08.120
I got bored with it and I stopped doing it.

1059
01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:12.900
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1060
01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:17.730
<v 4>And a will before,
shortly before their death.
Uh,
not,</v>

1061
01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:18.900
you know,
in the last decade,

1062
01:06:19.170 --> 01:06:24.170
both vice eidetic see if who was a great champion and a archives.

1063
01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:27.910
You but I'd be off was a great champion and a sports scientists,

1064
01:06:27.911 --> 01:06:31.530
they criticize these practices very,
very heavily.

1065
01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.100
At least see me advise you of who,
uh,

1066
01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:36.470
also has done the same thing they just said,

1067
01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.880
basically you guys are barking up the wrong tree right here.

1068
01:06:39.210 --> 01:06:42.480
So I just think that people are trying to get fantasy.
It's funny.

1069
01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:47.510
That's what's happening in Russia is probably reflecting that whole trend,

1070
01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:54.900
western trend.
That's,
and that seemed to call new Amania.

1071
01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:58.470
People love the New People just absolutely love the new there.

1072
01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:02.340
They're forgetting that what stuff that will work.
It's worked much better.

1073
01:07:02.370 --> 01:07:05.520
You could consider the results.
There was all sorts of period back.

1074
01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:09.660
Then the same thing.
You can look at the power lifting methodology,

1075
01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:12.480
uh,
the ulcer going back to the 80s,

1076
01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.720
the classic American power lifting methodology,

1077
01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:20.730
the classic cycling as exemplified by lifters like Ed Coan and Lamar gant and a

1078
01:07:22.530 --> 01:07:27.300
systematized by Marty Gallagher.
Again,
people are saying,
well,

1079
01:07:27.450 --> 01:07:31.560
we have better training methods these days and they're showing you a different

1080
01:07:31.561 --> 01:07:35.730
numbers in the squats and the bench press and so on.
To which I say,
well,

1081
01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.170
in the squat and the bench press,

1082
01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:40.950
it has become impossible to really compare apples and apples because it will

1083
01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.920
these crazy shirts and it's usually people are wearing exactly,

1084
01:07:44.370 --> 01:07:49.320
but in the deadlift you are still seeing,
look at the record tables,

1085
01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:54.560
the record tables and number of the death of trekkers are still set back in the

1086
01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:57.600
eighties and nineties and there is still sitting.

1087
01:07:57.601 --> 01:08:01.020
These are old timey historic correctors and even the advancement of some

1088
01:08:01.021 --> 01:08:04.410
assistance gear for the deadlift and advancement of the longer bars.

1089
01:08:04.411 --> 01:08:07.530
We'd be at bars and so on yet improved some pools,

1090
01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:12.120
but still many of this record is still do stand.
And uh,

1091
01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:16.110
the 80s is a fascinating era for strength.

1092
01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:21.590
I wrote a blog a little while ago that I call it forward to the past.

1093
01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:27.040
It was inspired by the upcoming 30th anniversary of the movie back to the

1094
01:08:27.351 --> 01:08:31.580
future.
And if point and the point I made in there,
and look,
you know,

1095
01:08:31.581 --> 01:08:33.440
if Marty Mcfly,
I want it to travel there.

1096
01:08:33.441 --> 01:08:36.050
Plenty of reasons to travel to today's Day,

1097
01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:41.480
but looking for strength advice that he would have been much better off staying

1098
01:08:41.481 --> 01:08:45.650
home because it's so hidden up with lifting cause the dollar to the 80s the

1099
01:08:45.651 --> 01:08:49.460
American power lifting methodology of the eighties this to or remain superior.

1100
01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:51.650
And that's not something you can argue.

1101
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:55.640
<v 0>Yeah.
Even from the deliver,
not familiar,
perhaps,</v>

1102
01:08:55.641 --> 01:08:58.100
especially for people who are not familiar with powerlifting,

1103
01:08:58.290 --> 01:09:02.570
I think would just be fascinated by,
by Ed coan.
What was it?

1104
01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:05.030
He pulled a,
Oh God,
I'm blanking here.

1105
01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:07.190
<v 4>Nine oh one probably.</v>

1106
01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:11.660
<v 0>That's a little button I will add.
It has body weight.
That was 20 years old.</v>

1107
01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:13.073
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1108
01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.033
<v 0>Sanity</v>

1109
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:19.820
<v 4>ad has said Ed has said some workloads to a hundred world records in and he has</v>

1110
01:09:19.821 --> 01:09:22.310
competed in weight classes,
you know,

1111
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:24.240
so many different weight classes over the years.

1112
01:09:24.241 --> 01:09:28.970
So he also had a remarkably injury-free courier.
Just really remarkably

1113
01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:32.840
<v 0>his hips gave him,
I mean he's had,
he's had hip issues since then.</v>

1114
01:09:32.841 --> 01:09:35.300
Do you think that's a result of sumo style deadlift?

1115
01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:40.250
<v 4>I doubt it very much.
I doubt it very much.
I mean deep squat,
if you,</v>

1116
01:09:40.251 --> 01:09:42.380
if you talk to somebody like Greg Cook,

1117
01:09:42.381 --> 01:09:44.600
if you'd talk to somebody professors to it and my Gill,

1118
01:09:44.601 --> 01:09:49.100
you will find that deeper wide squads could pop.
Probably lead to some problems.

1119
01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:51.710
Sumo deadlift.
It's extremely,
extremely unlikely.

1120
01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:54.800
<v 0>Very interesting.
And one of the things that,</v>

1121
01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:56.230
<v 4>Tim,
sorry to interrupt you,</v>

1122
01:09:56.260 --> 01:10:00.160
how many people do you know who don't sumo dead lift anything heavier than a

1123
01:10:00.161 --> 01:10:02.170
newspaper and have to go get,
get their hips?

1124
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.560
<v 0>No,
exactly.
And this is actually something I was going to bring up,</v>

1125
01:10:05.561 --> 01:10:09.790
which is when people see the [inaudible] of the world of the bodybuilders who

1126
01:10:09.791 --> 01:10:12.820
get cancer and they go,
oh my God,
you know,
the,
the steroids cause cancer.

1127
01:10:12.821 --> 01:10:13.391
And it's like,
well,

1128
01:10:13.391 --> 01:10:18.391
you have to look at it in the context of how many people out of a thousand would

1129
01:10:18.521 --> 01:10:19.121
get cancer,

1130
01:10:19.121 --> 01:10:24.010
whether they're in the gym or injecting steroids or not to really have a fair

1131
01:10:24.011 --> 01:10:28.720
assessment of the causal factors.
Right.
So,
so your point's well taken,

1132
01:10:28.721 --> 01:10:30.470
the thing,
the origin.

1133
01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:32.570
<v 4>Gotcha.
I'll interrupt you though and I will say one thing.</v>

1134
01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:34.890
I'll keep interrupting any of these guys.

1135
01:10:34.891 --> 01:10:39.510
Many of these guys who competed at a very high level in the eighties and the

1136
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:42.570
seventies are very healthy and doing extremely well.

1137
01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:45.880
If you look at Gallagher himself,
he's right now,
he's in his sixties.

1138
01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:50.580
He's a very strong,
he's very surprised,
fully healthy hikes in the woods,

1139
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:55.290
you know,
every day.
If you look at,
uh,
weight lifters,

1140
01:10:56.040 --> 01:11:00.890
forget the 80s.
Let's go back a little farther.
A little bit of poop fed.

1141
01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:04.220
Yeah.
He was,
uh,
his,
uh,
Soviet German.
Uh,

1142
01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:08.910
he was a Olympic champion in weightlifting,

1143
01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:14.070
had the age of 37 and that's something that's never been incredible replicated.

1144
01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:19.570
Absolutely.
It is incredible.
Today he's somewhere in his mid eighties,
and uh,

1145
01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:22.050
every day as part of his training regimen,

1146
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:26.250
he does jump squats with 200 pounds,
90 kilos.

1147
01:11:26.650 --> 01:11:28.920
So he goes rock bottom of the squat and jumps up.

1148
01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:33.060
And that's the guy in his mid eighties.
And in fact,
you look so good.

1149
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:36.630
So some journalist came to interview him.
He said,
excuse me,
sir,

1150
01:11:36.631 --> 01:11:37.890
may we speak to your dad?

1151
01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:44.320
<v 0>That's amazing.
Wow.
Something to aspire to.
I've been at,
just on the,</v>

1152
01:11:44.321 --> 01:11:45.860
on the weightlifter point,
uh,

1153
01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:50.210
I've been spending time with an amazing gentleman named,
uh,

1154
01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:53.120
Jersey Gregorich.
I'm not sure if that rings a bell,
but yeah,

1155
01:11:53.190 --> 01:11:57.480
<v 4>he is a very nice man.
He's a Polish or accomplish this year.</v>

1156
01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:00.400
<v 0>Very accomplished,
uh,
rolled class weightlifter,</v>

1157
01:12:00.401 --> 01:12:04.030
I think primarily in the master's division,
but he's,
I'm speculating here,

1158
01:12:04.031 --> 01:12:07.660
probably in his mix,
mid sixties.
I'm spending time with him and he can still,

1159
01:12:08.150 --> 01:12:10.720
you know,
throw,
I don't,
I don't know the exact weight,

1160
01:12:10.721 --> 01:12:14.390
but the a two to 300 pounds over his head in the snatch,
no problem.

1161
01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:18.660
That was a jersey is still going to do a full splits.
I,
he is IX.

1162
01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:21.250
He is amazingly flexible.

1163
01:12:21.251 --> 01:12:25.630
I haven't asked him to do any vandamme type stuff for me,
uh,
but his,

1164
01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:28.930
his ability,
his head,
his hamstring flexibility,

1165
01:12:28.931 --> 01:12:30.640
which of course is much more than hamstrings.

1166
01:12:30.641 --> 01:12:34.390
But what I perceive with a lay person would perceive as hamstring flexibility

1167
01:12:34.391 --> 01:12:39.190
just blows my mind.
It's,
it's amazing how flexible this guy is.
Uh,

1168
01:12:39.250 --> 01:12:43.420
so it's,
it that's,
um,
I'm very interested in the long game,

1169
01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:47.410
so,
but increasingly interested,
you know,
the older I get,

1170
01:12:47.411 --> 01:12:50.080
I'm 37 and I can't,
I'm certainly not going to be winning any,

1171
01:12:50.081 --> 01:12:51.970
a Olympic gold medals anytime soon.
And weightlift

1172
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.390
<v 4>my father to cop Barbara Lifting at the age of 71,</v>

1173
01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:58.810
he's 77 today.
Uh,

1174
01:12:58.930 --> 01:13:03.830
he dead lifted 413 pounds without a belt.
And a,
he said,

1175
01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:04.120
you know,

1176
01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:09.100
several American records in his age group and overtraining for five years.

1177
01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:11.110
So he put on 20 pounds of muscle.

1178
01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:14.020
If you look at my father looked at him from the back,

1179
01:13:14.530 --> 01:13:18.430
you will think that this guy's gotta be in his forties and he looks like a

1180
01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:23.110
wrestler.
He is just massive.
And a stu McGill when he examined him,

1181
01:13:23.111 --> 01:13:24.040
he says he's got,

1182
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:27.780
he's never as soon as such as career development of a 70 Rome and uh,

1183
01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:29.260
he started when he was 71.

1184
01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:33.220
<v 0>Would,
would you consider the,
uh,</v>

1185
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:35.390
and please disagree if this is not the case,

1186
01:13:35.391 --> 01:13:39.260
but if you had to pick one movement for strength,

1187
01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:42.800
longevity with the deadlift,
be that mood,
that movement,

1188
01:13:42.801 --> 01:13:44.930
or is it not possible to choose one movement?

1189
01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:46.580
How would you try to answer that question?

1190
01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:49.260
<v 4>If you were to choose one moment,
Tim?
Yes,</v>

1191
01:13:49.290 --> 01:13:52.290
I would choose the deadlift or I would choose the Kettlebell swing.

1192
01:13:52.530 --> 01:13:55.230
Obviously the Kettlebell swing is not something you couldn't compete in and

1193
01:13:55.231 --> 01:13:56.040
something you're not,

1194
01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:00.000
it's not going to give it that same satisfaction was lifting heavy weight.
But,

1195
01:14:00.001 --> 01:14:04.140
uh,
those are the two main full body exercises,

1196
01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:09.620
the full body expressions of power that will go such a long way for you,

1197
01:14:10.411 --> 01:14:13.870
for lungevity strengths,
just the quality of life

1198
01:14:14.410 --> 01:14:17.970
<v 0>are there.
What are the biggest mistakes that people make with the deadlift,</v>

1199
01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:21.840
whether that's technically or in,
in programming,

1200
01:14:21.841 --> 01:14:24.000
what are the biggest mistakes?
And not,

1201
01:14:24.090 --> 01:14:27.120
not asking you to repeat things you've already said,
but is it,

1202
01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:29.310
are there any things that are top of mind that a,

1203
01:14:30.150 --> 01:14:33.840
<v 4>well,
Tim,
I think they're very big mistake is because they think,
okay,</v>

1204
01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:36.600
I have big tops things from the floor.
This looks so simple.

1205
01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:39.510
It's not an Olympic lift,
therefore it's very simple.

1206
01:14:39.570 --> 01:14:43.890
So just start filing on place and start training they'd done as a very technical

1207
01:14:43.891 --> 01:14:47.790
lift.
And even if you're just a recreation lifter,

1208
01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:52.320
you owe it to yourself to learn to deadlift correctly.
So that's,

1209
01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:54.180
that's as simple as that.
So I say that's,

1210
01:14:54.210 --> 01:14:58.800
that's a primary mistake and that mistake goes for every exercise that people do

1211
01:14:58.801 --> 01:14:59.634
out there.

1212
01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:04.340
<v 0>Yeah.
And I would highly recommend people check out your book with,
um,</v>

1213
01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:09.750
and now I want to say,
uh,
with Mr. Bolton.
Dynamite.

1214
01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:13.360
Yeah.
Really a very,
very dense,
uh,

1215
01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:18.250
shifting gears just a little bit dense and the best way possible.
Um,
no,
no fluff.

1216
01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:24.280
Uh,
I'd love to shift gears and just ask you a few questions about,

1217
01:15:24.690 --> 01:15:29.370
it's sort of your philosophies and your thinking,
not the,
not so much,
uh,
the,
the,

1218
01:15:29.410 --> 01:15:32.860
the highly specific training questions.
But when you think of,
for instance,

1219
01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:36.010
the word successful,
who's the first person who comes to mind for you?

1220
01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:39.183
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1221
01:15:39.650 --> 01:15:40.010
<v 4>Tim.</v>

1222
01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:45.010
I am fortunate enough to know many successful people and I think that what

1223
01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:49.670
separates him from the rest is,
uh,

1224
01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:54.350
does she have strong first Eric for a heart,
he put it very well.

1225
01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:58.940
He says balance with priorities.
Balance was priorities.

1226
01:15:59.210 --> 01:16:00.140
So Eric,

1227
01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:04.940
yourself and many others are fortunate to know they exemplify success for me.

1228
01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:11.430
<v 0>And the how do you,
what is the best way?</v>

1229
01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:17.250
What are the habits that you've observed that allow people to have balance with

1230
01:16:17.251 --> 01:16:21.470
priorities?
What are the,
the things they do that other people don't do?

1231
01:16:22.230 --> 01:16:24.210
Or maybe the things they don't do that other people do.

1232
01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:26.380
<v 4>Well,
I think one is calm.</v>

1233
01:16:27.170 --> 01:16:27.670
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1234
01:16:27.670 --> 01:16:31.870
<v 4>These people are calm because people who are hyper,</v>

1235
01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.960
they get so trapped in their reactive mode.

1236
01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:40.080
They get too trapped in the everyday minutia of their work in their existence.

1237
01:16:40.570 --> 01:16:44.320
So they just do not pause and they do not sync again.

1238
01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:49.380
Eric has a great quote from the Vietnam era seal which says calm is contagious.

1239
01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:52.360
It's contagious.

1240
01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:57.610
So when the person is calm that he or she has the time to meditate,

1241
01:16:57.730 --> 01:17:01.990
reflect,
sad,
their priorities and uh,
send the balance.

1242
01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:03.513
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1243
01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:07.960
that's certainly the holds true from what I've seen.

1244
01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:09.320
And the opposite of course is true.

1245
01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:15.200
<v 4>Hysteria is chasing the tail.
Absolutely.
Chicken little,</v>

1246
01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:17.990
this guy's falling.
Everything is urgent.

1247
01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:23.210
It sounds like the Internet in a nutshell right there as well.
Uh,
uh,

1248
01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.810
what do you have any morning rituals?
What does you,
what are the,

1249
01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:30.230
what are the first,
what is the first hour or two of your day look like?

1250
01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:34.670
Typically I like to ease into my day.

1251
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.020
I will get up early.

1252
01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:41.860
6:00 AM typically and my wife and I will just have coffee and read the newspaper

1253
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:45.050
and make small talk and I really take my time.

1254
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:49.970
I pointedly Rita favor not watch TV,

1255
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:52.670
not to get any kind of electronic news or radio.

1256
01:17:53.330 --> 01:17:58.330
I really appreciated the calm of print because whenever you're watching TV it's

1257
01:17:58.371 --> 01:18:02.450
just the latest news breaking news and it's again that same tail chasing

1258
01:18:05.050 --> 01:18:09.770
after that.
If I,
if I decide to the train with kettle bells,

1259
01:18:09.771 --> 01:18:13.850
I'll go to the beach and do that.
If I do not do that this morning,

1260
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:16.490
I'll just still go to the beach for half an hour.
What time?

1261
01:18:17.810 --> 01:18:21.800
That'll probably be about seven o'clock and I will take a dip.

1262
01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:25.490
I'll meditate a little,
I might stretch a little.
So it's again,

1263
01:18:25.491 --> 01:18:29.810
it's a time to time to be composed.
After that,

1264
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:31.490
it's a time to do creative work.

1265
01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:36.970
So I will either write or I will do research and when I do that I very pointedly

1266
01:18:37.761 --> 01:18:41.120
have the email down.
So my whole email application is down.

1267
01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:44.120
If I need to use the Internet for some research,
you know,

1268
01:18:44.121 --> 01:18:46.160
the browser will stay out,
but not the email.

1269
01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:51.020
And My colleagues know to call me if they have something urgent.

1270
01:18:51.710 --> 01:18:52.640
And uh,

1271
01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:56.960
not a lot of people call me because I have my business card only has my email.

1272
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.943
So that's good.

1273
01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:02.650
Does it have your email and then it says please call a virgin?

1274
01:19:03.790 --> 01:19:06.740
No,
he doesn't know my,
obviously my colleagues do have that.

1275
01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:10.400
So and when I write I will sometimes change the environment.

1276
01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:13.790
I'd like to go to a coffee shop or go to a park or something.

1277
01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:19.100
And I do have a particular methods when I,
when I write.

1278
01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:24.520
So I will just select some topic and I work in this topic and as soon as I hit

1279
01:19:24.921 --> 01:19:27.260
the wall and this topic,
I just switched to something else.

1280
01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:31.370
I had never find the right at writer's block.
I just absolutely,

1281
01:19:31.371 --> 01:19:34.700
I just have a lot of different things,
a lot of different projects,
chapters,

1282
01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:39.170
articles,
books,
whatever,
going at the same time.
And I'm very flexible about it.

1283
01:19:39.171 --> 01:19:44.171
And also do let my Luca Brasi evolve and sometimes they evolve in a very

1284
01:19:44.271 --> 01:19:45.410
unpredictable manner.

1285
01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.090
The naked warriors started out as a book for strength training in the field for

1286
01:19:50.091 --> 01:19:50.924
the military.

1287
01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:55.790
And then it evolved in a sort of a manifesto for reverse engineering,

1288
01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:58.550
the body language of the strong.
So I just kind of allowed that to happen.

1289
01:19:59.690 --> 01:20:03.680
Towards the end of the day,
it's a make a call,

1290
01:20:03.710 --> 01:20:06.260
make a call with my coworkers,

1291
01:20:06.270 --> 01:20:10.410
take care of some business and with my wife and you know,

1292
01:20:10.411 --> 01:20:15.120
pretty much relaxed.
Read some first reason nonfiction that or read some fiction.

1293
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:18.570
That's a pretty standard day.
I like my days.

1294
01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:22.870
<v 0>I like the sound of your days to the uh,
the,</v>

1295
01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:26.470
do you listen to music and if so,
what type of music,

1296
01:20:26.710 --> 01:20:30.790
what are the most frequently played songs or albums on your iPhone or,

1297
01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:34.530
<v 4>well,
my,
my music tastes are,</v>

1298
01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:37.350
I like the ying and Yang kind of like stuff in the middle.

1299
01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:41.280
So on one hand I enjoy 1980s,

1300
01:20:41.281 --> 01:20:46.281
heavy metal I like accept aren't maiden Saxon do's are my favorite bands.

1301
01:20:47.011 --> 01:20:50.970
On the other hand,
I will listen to Jackson Browne.

1302
01:20:51.150 --> 01:20:55.860
Carla Bruni [inaudible] time.
So in my opinion,

1303
01:20:56.190 --> 01:21:00.970
music has to be either,
you know.
Yeah,
it is.
Yeah,
exactly.

1304
01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:04.860
Seriously,
it's like a performance is the same,
the art,

1305
01:21:04.861 --> 01:21:08.190
a physical performance as the art of turning on the switch and shutting it off

1306
01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:09.660
for maximal strength,

1307
01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:12.660
you have to turn to allot for maximum flexibility and endurance.

1308
01:21:12.661 --> 01:21:13.590
You have to turn it off.

1309
01:21:14.010 --> 01:21:17.310
And for a lot of sports is that ability to join it on and off,
on and off,

1310
01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:19.680
back and forth,
back and forth,
tension,
relaxation.

1311
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:22.140
So I do like these extremes in my music.

1312
01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:27.590
<v 0>Right?
So you're either you're either Vivaldi or Penn,
Tara and no,
nope,
nope,</v>

1313
01:21:27.650 --> 01:21:31.580
no pop music and all this stuff in the middle has no rights to exist.

1314
01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:39.050
And,
uh,
when you're writing,
are you writing?

1315
01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:44.270
Do you write on a laptop?
Do you write?
And if so,

1316
01:21:44.271 --> 01:21:46.620
do you use word or some other program?
Uh,

1317
01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:49.520
or are you writing in a journal?

1318
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:52.910
How are you jumping between these various articles that you're working on?

1319
01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:56.500
<v 4>To my right and ward.
And,
uh,</v>

1320
01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:59.760
what I do is I have a very big Cuellar,

1321
01:21:59.761 --> 01:22:03.010
a type of organization of data in my mind,
in my mind,

1322
01:22:03.011 --> 01:22:06.790
I have many different shelves with many different projects and many different

1323
01:22:06.791 --> 01:22:08.230
research studies and so on.

1324
01:22:08.770 --> 01:22:12.670
So I can kind of see in my mind what connects with what I see,
the pattern.

1325
01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:16.990
So I can go back and forth.
And I really think that,
uh,

1326
01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:20.260
the computer does enable me to do that so much easier.

1327
01:22:20.770 --> 01:22:24.130
And I'm generally not a fan of technology,

1328
01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:26.380
but I have to say that the word processor,

1329
01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:30.820
it's one piece of technology that I have a very big fan,
I think on the page.

1330
01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:33.580
I don't think in my mind,
I think in the page.

1331
01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:35.740
<v 0>Yeah.
That's,
that's something that I've,</v>

1332
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:37.970
I've heard from a number of good writers is that they,

1333
01:22:38.010 --> 01:22:41.290
they have to write to clarify what they're actually thinking.

1334
01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:44.290
It's another thing to day form the thought and put it down.

1335
01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:48.370
They use the process of writing to clarify their thinking.
Uh,
do you,

1336
01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:50.350
do you have a private journal or anything like that?

1337
01:22:51.210 --> 01:22:51.700
<v 4>No.</v>

1338
01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:55.720
<v 0>You do not.
Okay.
And,
uh,
just since,
uh,
I love talking about this,</v>

1339
01:22:55.721 --> 01:22:58.150
but I won't take too long.

1340
01:22:58.210 --> 01:23:03.210
A recommendation that really was a game changer for me is using a program called

1341
01:23:03.491 --> 01:23:04.324
scrivener,

1342
01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:09.620
a in of word and a Scribner's is as it sounds,

1343
01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:11.120
uh,
what that allows you to do it,

1344
01:23:11.121 --> 01:23:15.880
it was originally designed for a movie scripts I believe for screenwriting.

1345
01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:21.120
And what it allows you to do is have all of your various documents which would

1346
01:23:21.401 --> 01:23:26.401
each otherwise be a separate word file in a table of contents on the left hand

1347
01:23:27.071 --> 01:23:31.300
side of the screen,
which you can move around and modify and put into folders,

1348
01:23:31.330 --> 01:23:34.660
which I uh,
I've used for are all of my,
my last three books.

1349
01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:40.140
And then you can look at two different pieces of writing on the right hand side.

1350
01:23:40.331 --> 01:23:44.350
So it all typically have is a folder that's all research documents and,

1351
01:23:44.410 --> 01:23:48.460
and I will have a split pane on the right side where the top is,

1352
01:23:48.461 --> 01:23:50.230
what I'm working on,
what I'm actually writing.

1353
01:23:50.230 --> 01:23:53.890
And the bottom right is the research document.

1354
01:23:53.891 --> 01:23:58.891
So rather than having a million windows open with different word documents and

1355
01:23:59.261 --> 01:24:01.420
as you've probably experienced,
once you have enough of those open,

1356
01:24:01.421 --> 01:24:06.070
eventually it just craps out on you and jumps off the cliff.
Ah,

1357
01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:11.080
I've,
I don't think I've ever had in however many years I've used it,

1358
01:24:11.081 --> 01:24:14.440
scrivener fail on me and it's because it strips out a lot of the bloat.

1359
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:18.140
But you might really,
I don't think I'll definitely try it.
Yeah.
It's,

1360
01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:21.910
it's a fun program to play with and I don't have the mental,
uh,

1361
01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:25.110
I have too many plates spinning at once in terms of,

1362
01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:28.030
of articles if I'm working on a larger project like a book.

1363
01:24:28.031 --> 01:24:32.170
So scrivener helps me to codify that,
which I find very helpful.

1364
01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:36.970
How do you change your,
do you change your typical routine on the weekends?

1365
01:24:36.971 --> 01:24:40.510
Is there anything that you do differently on the weekends to decompress or

1366
01:24:40.511 --> 01:24:41.344
otherwise?

1367
01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:46.960
<v 4>Not a lot.
Go to church,
go out,
go for a hike with my wife Julie.
But otherwise,</v>

1368
01:24:46.961 --> 01:24:49.490
pretty much every day I tried to have,
uh,

1369
01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:54.780
at balance work and balance of family and balance of recreation and a balance of

1370
01:24:55.901 --> 01:24:56.734
self improvement.

1371
01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:02.530
<v 0>Speaking on,
on the last point,
self improvement,
uh,
what are,
what are,</v>

1372
01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:05.380
what are things that you're currently trying to,
uh,

1373
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:07.510
or would like to improve about yourself?

1374
01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:13.840
<v 4>Well,
above myself that would be private,
Timmy.</v>

1375
01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:18.040
<v 0>I think that it's just maturity.
It's just us girls just between us.</v>

1376
01:25:18.930 --> 01:25:23.930
<v 4>I think that over sharing is one of the major malfunctions of the modern world.</v>

1377
01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:27.240
So,
uh,
I think I'm going to keep these ones for myself,

1378
01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:30.810
but I'm going to tell you what I'm trying to improve professionally.
Okay,

1379
01:25:30.811 --> 01:25:33.620
that's fine.
I have,
uh,
as I mentioned again,

1380
01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:38.660
I have been able to dissect the very successful weightlifting methodology of the

1381
01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:44.010
sixties through eighties,
uh,

1382
01:25:44.010 --> 01:25:48.300
which is extremely complex methodology and I've been able to bring it down to

1383
01:25:48.301 --> 01:25:52.410
the underlying principles and codify it and write up hug rhythms.

1384
01:25:52.770 --> 01:25:53.520
So what I'm,

1385
01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:57.930
what I'm doing right now is trying to bring this very sophisticated,

1386
01:25:58.290 --> 01:26:02.820
very amazing system of training to regular people who just want to get stronger.

1387
01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:06.740
So I am in this refinement phase.
Got It.

1388
01:26:07.670 --> 01:26:10.400
<v 0>And so just touch on that just as a segway,</v>

1389
01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:15.770
I'd love to talk about flexibility because I get a lot of questions about

1390
01:26:15.771 --> 01:26:18.680
flexibility.
I don't consider it my area of expertise,

1391
01:26:18.681 --> 01:26:23.510
so I constantly refer people to your work.
But uh,

1392
01:26:25.010 --> 01:26:30.010
I'd love to hear you talk about where flexibility fits into the picture or when

1393
01:26:30.471 --> 01:26:33.890
it does.
Because I think for me and for other people,

1394
01:26:33.891 --> 01:26:38.600
there's a lot of confusion around mobility versus flexibility.
Uh,

1395
01:26:38.630 --> 01:26:41.960
one of the questions I get most often for instance is,
uh,

1396
01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:45.200
how do I get to the full side splits?
They want to go between the chairs,

1397
01:26:45.201 --> 01:26:49.430
like Van Damme and you know,
is that,
is that a,

1398
01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:52.790
a a worthwhile goal?
Is it a terrible goal?

1399
01:26:52.791 --> 01:26:55.070
And this is a lot coming at you at once,
but how does,

1400
01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:58.550
how does flexibility fit into the picture or not for what types of people?

1401
01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:02.460
<v 4>Okay.
Well first of all,
let me tell you about the goal of this split.
Whether you,</v>

1402
01:27:02.490 --> 01:27:06.040
if you choose to achieve that,
it's achievable.

1403
01:27:06.250 --> 01:27:09.130
I will tell you a great success story.

1404
01:27:09.230 --> 01:27:13.960
He's one of the strong first instructors and he is truly a product of the

1405
01:27:13.961 --> 01:27:18.100
system.
The gentleman's name is Steve freebies and he's a music professor.

1406
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.580
He was severely injured.

1407
01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:24.880
His lower back was herniated,
very bad.

1408
01:27:24.881 --> 01:27:28.540
He spent eight or nine months in bed and Percocet.
It was very bad.

1409
01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:31.330
And then he decided to become a man,

1410
01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:35.440
decided to train seriously for strength,

1411
01:27:35.441 --> 01:27:39.130
for flexibility training like a real athlete after getting the proper medical

1412
01:27:39.131 --> 01:27:43.630
clearance and so on.
Of course.
So fast forward to today,

1413
01:27:43.950 --> 01:27:46.840
see free these who is a 59 if I'm not mistaken,

1414
01:27:47.290 --> 01:27:51.500
he holds a number of American records for is age group in the dead lift and he

1415
01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:54.460
Douglas without a belt.
And Steve freebies,

1416
01:27:54.610 --> 01:27:59.610
59 year old man who used to have horrendously messed up back,

1417
01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:04.980
can do suspend the size,
please just like find down.
So,
uh,
you've exists,

1418
01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:08.290
he's out there thing that you were too old or too whatever.

1419
01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:11.140
You just got to get to shape up.

1420
01:28:14.110 --> 01:28:16.910
<v 0>All right,
so touching on the,
all right,</v>

1421
01:28:16.990 --> 01:28:21.080
I will raise my hand.
I'm one of those disease.
Uh,

1422
01:28:22.330 --> 01:28:24.710
if,
if,
and I've,
I've had this,

1423
01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:28.460
I think there are many to do's that are,
there's the,

1424
01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:31.790
they're the nice to have things than the must have things.

1425
01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:34.640
And for me it's been at least a decade,

1426
01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:39.290
maybe 20 years where I've had the suspended sides splits on the to do list and

1427
01:28:39.291 --> 01:28:42.740
it,
it just gets,
it gets renewed.
You know,
it's kind of like a car insurance.

1428
01:28:42.741 --> 01:28:47.330
Like I renew it every year,
but I never really make any use of it.
So,

1429
01:28:47.610 --> 01:28:50.530
uh,
we'll deal with that will get you there.

1430
01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:53.920
<v 4>You know,
it's whether it's a worthwhile goal or not to pursue you.</v>

1431
01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:57.660
Obviously there's the obvious just because it is their right and there was no

1432
01:28:57.661 --> 01:29:02.640
way up judge Doug kind of go,
somebody climbs to the mountain and somebody,
uh,

1433
01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:05.040
somebody learns to do a side split.

1434
01:29:05.370 --> 01:29:09.900
Is that something that she needed to do for your performance outside of several

1435
01:29:09.901 --> 01:29:13.350
sports like taekwondo or gymnastics?
No,
you really don't.

1436
01:29:13.730 --> 01:29:15.780
Is that going to improve your wellbeing?

1437
01:29:16.170 --> 01:29:21.170
I do have to say that this sense of freedom that you have on your hips when you

1438
01:29:22.771 --> 01:29:24.600
consistently can do a full split,

1439
01:29:25.230 --> 01:29:29.220
it's really pretty awesome to have that feeling of freedom and the hips.

1440
01:29:29.250 --> 01:29:33.570
You can only know that freedom if you also have known what not to have it,

1441
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:36.630
if that makes any sense.
So I will periodically,
you know,

1442
01:29:36.631 --> 01:29:39.870
for a while I kind of would not treat tooted to serious.
They take some time,

1443
01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:42.830
you know,
stretch very lightly,
kind of stay,
might keep,

1444
01:29:42.850 --> 01:29:46.740
maybe it's 70% and then I'll just make the push again and bring it back.

1445
01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:51.990
And I always really enjoy that feeling of freedom.
So that's,

1446
01:29:52.010 --> 01:29:54.530
it's,
it's a decision though.
Let's talk about this mobility,

1447
01:29:54.531 --> 01:29:57.540
a flexibility of business.
Let's talk about how people should proceed about it.

1448
01:29:58.020 --> 01:30:00.060
So Mobility,
pretty much,

1449
01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:03.510
we were talking about the full range of motion in the joint when,
uh,

1450
01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:05.100
the length of the muscle is not an issue.

1451
01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:09.960
So let's use an example of a full squat.
Okay.
So if you're in a full squad,

1452
01:30:10.050 --> 01:30:11.310
uh,
you know,

1453
01:30:11.311 --> 01:30:15.060
not a whole lot of officers are preventing you from hitting that range of
motion.

1454
01:30:15.420 --> 01:30:18.990
So there may be a possibly that you need to just pretty much get your joint

1455
01:30:18.991 --> 01:30:22.650
moving smoother.
So what does that mean folks?

1456
01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:25.290
It just literally means,
uh,

1457
01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:29.310
just doing a whole bunch of squats very slowly and not very slowly,

1458
01:30:29.311 --> 01:30:33.900
just slowly and building up progressively range of motion.
Uh,
I'm also,

1459
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.600
I could admission,

1460
01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:39.240
I'm also the famous Soviet scientists who was a kind of a health guru.

1461
01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:41.460
He would perform this movements every day.

1462
01:30:41.490 --> 01:30:45.450
He would perform a hundred squats every day and a hundred other other things.

1463
01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:48.990
If you're not up for doing that,

1464
01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:52.680
you just simply hold on to the doorway.
So he just unloaded yourself partially.

1465
01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:56.070
You shift your weight more to the heels to make it easier on your knees and you

1466
01:30:56.071 --> 01:31:00.630
start squatting and don't go to pain,
you know,
be very progressive.

1467
01:31:00.631 --> 01:31:03.930
It goes deep as you can eventually go deeper.
Just do multiple sets.

1468
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:08.850
And the same thing is true really for pretty much for all the other joints.

1469
01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.940
But obviously they have joined stats.
That's a big one.

1470
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:16.770
And everybody needs,
everybody needs this type of training.

1471
01:31:17.670 --> 01:31:22.320
I like a very simple,
uh,
joint mobility protocol.

1472
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:26.070
Obviously you can make this as complex as you want seriously and may people
have.

1473
01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:31.230
But like in my book,
Kettlebells,
simple and sinister,
that's my latest book.

1474
01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:34.440
I give this protocol where they're just,

1475
01:31:34.441 --> 01:31:36.180
just a couple of different exercises you do.

1476
01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:39.470
One exercise you do is you just kind of a move the extra step,

1477
01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:43.890
move a way to round your head in a circle,
a halo,
loosen up the shoulders.

1478
01:31:44.490 --> 01:31:47.520
And other exercise you do is a very particular type of squat.

1479
01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:51.390
Got a prion goblets quad.
That's a terrific exercise.

1480
01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:53.550
So you can do search online,

1481
01:31:53.551 --> 01:31:56.550
prying Goblin squad just for people.

1482
01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:59.500
I remember the first time I heard you say that I embarrassed myself at the

1483
01:31:59.501 --> 01:32:02.290
certification because I thought you were saying goblins squat and I asked you

1484
01:32:02.291 --> 01:32:06.260
what a Goblin squad is.
So for me,
it is a goblet,
uh,

1485
01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:11.210
like drinking out of a goblet squat,
the name by and John,
and it's,

1486
01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:15.090
it's a terrific type of a squad that's literally squad for the people.
See,

1487
01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:20.100
the problem with the squat exercise is most people are don't know how to move

1488
01:32:20.411 --> 01:32:24.340
well,
they're tight and you try to put a bar in their bag and they just cannot do

1489
01:32:24.341 --> 01:32:28.480
that.
So the goblets quad is kind of a squad for the people that then developed.

1490
01:32:28.930 --> 01:32:29.530
And uh,

1491
01:32:29.530 --> 01:32:34.510
the prying that is added to that is something that really allows you to increase

1492
01:32:34.511 --> 01:32:37.450
your mobility and flexibility.
So,
uh,

1493
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:42.030
what you need to do when you trying to get,
get your flexibility increase.

1494
01:32:42.031 --> 01:32:46.290
Let's say that an mobility,
let's pick any exercise that you're doing,

1495
01:32:46.291 --> 01:32:49.050
any kind of a stretch that you're doing,
whatever it is.

1496
01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:53.430
So there are certain rules that you need to abide by.

1497
01:32:54.090 --> 01:32:55.170
And uh,

1498
01:32:56.130 --> 01:33:00.870
I call these the three s so use your strength,

1499
01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:06.220
find space and spread the load.
Use Strength,

1500
01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:11.330
find space,
spread the load.
So what does that,
so what does that mean exactly,
Tim?

1501
01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:14.530
Well,
let's use an example of the squad.

1502
01:33:14.710 --> 01:33:19.240
Using strength for the squad means pulling yourself down into the squat.

1503
01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:23.560
Instead of just dropping yourself using example of the split,

1504
01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:26.890
instead of trying to drop yourself down into the split,

1505
01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:30.400
you're very actively pushing your feet out,

1506
01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:34.210
like you're trying to spread the walls apart.
So spreading the walls apart,

1507
01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:37.510
that means you're using strengths,
find space.

1508
01:33:37.511 --> 01:33:40.870
So what does finding space finding space mean?

1509
01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:44.500
Just pretty much kind of a prying and moving your body into the position and

1510
01:33:44.501 --> 01:33:48.460
trying to find more space in the joint and also try to loosen up the Fascia.

1511
01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:51.790
That sheet,
that fiber sheet around your muscles.

1512
01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:57.420
It's a very good analogy would be trying to pull a post out of the ground.

1513
01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.060
So let's say you're trying to pull a pollster that grown.
It's a concrete poles.

1514
01:34:01.450 --> 01:34:04.270
You pull on it hard and it's not going to come out.

1515
01:34:04.450 --> 01:34:09.450
And I can tell you because I have tried then down in southern California,

1516
01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:14.620
I know that was not a golf vandalizing parking lot more back in the past we had

1517
01:34:14.621 --> 01:34:17.740
a house and uh,
we bought a house and there was some,

1518
01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:20.380
some things in the bag that I wanted to demolish.

1519
01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:25.920
So I'm trying to pull all this concrete posts so I tie and nylon rope to this

1520
01:34:25.961 --> 01:34:29.680
post that attach it to a crow bar,
get a nice strong sumo deadlift position.

1521
01:34:29.681 --> 01:34:30.514
I pool,

1522
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:34.240
well what happens is the nylon rope rips and I do a back flip into the pilot

1523
01:34:34.241 --> 01:34:37.810
dirt because I'm very smart.
I do this two more times.

1524
01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:41.080
And then my wife Julie walks by,
she says,
you know,

1525
01:34:41.110 --> 01:34:45.310
you could just kind of a wiggle it around pride.
I said,
oh,
that's right honey.

1526
01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:49.300
So the same thing is really with your flexibility.

1527
01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:53.440
So let's Tim,
let's use the,
let's use the example of the straddle.

1528
01:34:53.530 --> 01:34:57.160
Let's say you're trying to get the straddle instead of simply trying to force

1529
01:34:57.170 --> 01:35:01.190
yourself down.
So straddle meaning sites buts a side split,

1530
01:35:01.191 --> 01:35:04.310
but maybe lying on your stomach or maybe sitting up doesn't really matter either

1531
01:35:04.311 --> 01:35:07.190
way.
So he looked like a frog on its stomach.
Pretty much.

1532
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:08.660
So what you're trying to do is,

1533
01:35:08.661 --> 01:35:12.830
what you're trying to do is not just force your way in one direction,

1534
01:35:12.831 --> 01:35:15.890
but you're trying to kind of a pride to him loosen up in every direction

1535
01:35:15.891 --> 01:35:19.730
possible.
So let's say that you are,
uh,
let's see,

1536
01:35:19.731 --> 01:35:23.300
you are resting in your forums,
so you trying to get into this,
this straddle.

1537
01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:25.430
So your first pushing your legs out,

1538
01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:28.460
but then you're also kind of tilting your pelvis back and forth.

1539
01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:31.770
Then you're going to try to kind of wiggle your butt's side to side.

1540
01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:35.690
Then you will try to turn your body one way you can to try to turn your body the

1541
01:35:35.691 --> 01:35:36.524
either way.

1542
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:39.230
So pretty much what you're doing is you're taking advantage of the fact that

1543
01:35:39.231 --> 01:35:40.850
your Fascia,
that covers your muscles,

1544
01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:44.060
it runs and all sorts of different directions,
kind of like plywood.

1545
01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:46.910
So you need to loosen that up and a lot of different ways.

1546
01:35:47.150 --> 01:35:51.650
So if you keep going in different directions all around you will progress to

1547
01:35:51.651 --> 01:35:52.820
those goals so much faster.

1548
01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:57.640
So you strength find space and spread the load and again,

1549
01:35:57.660 --> 01:36:02.150
spreading the load just pretty much means that you are not just trying to focus

1550
01:36:02.151 --> 01:36:06.490
in that particular joint so you to be spreading it all around and we're like

1551
01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:11.500
[inaudible] is the absolutely absolute relaxation and impatience are the two

1552
01:36:12.321 --> 01:36:14.000
things that are absolutely fundamental.

1553
01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:17.000
If you're trying to get a high level of flexibility,
like a split,

1554
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:21.050
you see you get a recommendation,
let's say,

1555
01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:24.410
oh hold the stretch for and they'll give you some duration,

1556
01:36:24.690 --> 01:36:28.310
30 seconds or whatever.
Like how did they arrive at that number?
I have no idea.

1557
01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:30.860
Just somebody decided,
well that sounds like a nice round number,

1558
01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:34.880
let's recommend that.
But what you're trying to do,

1559
01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:38.210
it's disturbing how much of the world comes about that way.

1560
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:40.820
All it's like how many glasses of water you're supposed to drink it.

1561
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:45.350
It's just the same thing.
And so you know,
hold the stretch for 30 seconds,

1562
01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.410
but the fact is you are trying to wear out your stretch reflex.

1563
01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:53.120
You're trying to leg the muscle,
relax.
And depending on your fiber composition,

1564
01:36:53.121 --> 01:36:58.010
depending on your mental,
state,
emotional state training,
history,
injuries,

1565
01:36:58.011 --> 01:37:00.380
tree,
they can take different times.
So just don't worry about it.

1566
01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:04.550
So you just get in this position and you kind of a pry a little bit for awhile

1567
01:37:04.850 --> 01:37:07.220
and then you just relax and when you relax,

1568
01:37:07.221 --> 01:37:10.250
we try to breeze through that tight spot.

1569
01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:13.940
When I say breathe through,
I'm saying,
just listen to my breathing.

1570
01:37:19.010 --> 01:37:23.780
You completely release the tension.
Totally.
If you do this,

1571
01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:27.650
which is pretty much what most people do when they're trying to stretch,

1572
01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:31.430
you're tightening up the muscles.
So you just have to complete the lead.
Go.

1573
01:37:31.730 --> 01:37:34.400
You have to be patient and you have to spend,

1574
01:37:34.401 --> 01:37:36.620
you have to spend good half an hour,
40 minutes.

1575
01:37:36.621 --> 01:37:38.060
And this type of practice said day.

1576
01:37:38.061 --> 01:37:43.020
If you really are serious about reaching that level,
how long,
I'm sorry,
about 30,

1577
01:37:43.060 --> 01:37:46.160
40 minutes.
But even if you don't,
well,

1578
01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:49.940
there are ways of doing it faster to him,
but that involves isometric stretching.

1579
01:37:49.941 --> 01:37:53.480
And that's a little bit more technically involved to talk about here and the

1580
01:37:53.481 --> 01:37:55.260
show.
But,
uh,

1581
01:37:55.530 --> 01:37:58.850
even if you did not pursue this extreme flexibility,

1582
01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:02.430
go even if you just want to be flexible to whatever level you want to be

1583
01:38:02.431 --> 01:38:07.431
flexible and understand that the idea of relaxation breathing and patients are

1584
01:38:08.641 --> 01:38:09.570
absolutely fundamental.

1585
01:38:10.110 --> 01:38:14.370
You have to be patient flexibility training is not something you should ever do

1586
01:38:14.371 --> 01:38:16.020
when you're in a hurry for some appointment.

1587
01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:18.360
It's something you should save for the end of the day.

1588
01:38:18.690 --> 01:38:22.680
Let's say you're watching some TV show just and go and stretch,

1589
01:38:22.710 --> 01:38:26.100
or you're reading a book.
One of my colleagues,
Dr. Mark Chang,

1590
01:38:26.190 --> 01:38:30.420
a strong first senior instructor,
he has these beautiful side splits.

1591
01:38:30.450 --> 01:38:35.160
The way he worked up to east side split is she would just sit and read a book in

1592
01:38:35.161 --> 01:38:39.990
a straddle on the ground and then at some point whenever he felt like he could,

1593
01:38:39.991 --> 01:38:42.450
he just tried to spread his legs a wider and that's it.

1594
01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:46.950
You go back to reading his book.
So they see acquiring flexibility.

1595
01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:48.960
It's an exercise in patience.

1596
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:52.800
So if you do not have the patience or if you do not have the time,

1597
01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:53.910
I suggest to just give up.

1598
01:38:56.050 --> 01:38:59.290
<v 0>And the,
uh,
the isometric,
just to touch on that is,</v>

1599
01:38:59.291 --> 01:39:04.291
is that a variant or press the same thing as p and f,

1600
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.680
the,
uh,
pretty much sequential certificate contractions and uh,

1601
01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:11.040
and release.
Yeah.

1602
01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:14.780
<v 4>So here's how this works in a nutshell.
Imagine that you are,</v>

1603
01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:18.450
let's say that you're stretched out far and it feels like,
uh,
I,

1604
01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:22.040
I cannot go any farther than muscle.
It cannot get any tighter.

1605
01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:26.450
Then you slowly contract that muscle slowly.

1606
01:39:26.451 --> 01:39:30.590
So important for safety and you'd build up the tension and you hold that tension

1607
01:39:30.591 --> 01:39:34.190
for awhile and then you release that tension.
The important thing is again,

1608
01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:37.910
release.
And when you have released,
you will see this contrast.

1609
01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:41.120
So in a way you kind of a climb from the fire into the frying pan,

1610
01:39:41.121 --> 01:39:45.500
it's still hot but not as hot and you can eke out just a little bit more range

1611
01:39:45.501 --> 01:39:46.334
of motion.

1612
01:39:46.370 --> 01:39:51.260
So these isometric contractions can be added to any type of stretching.
And,

1613
01:39:51.261 --> 01:39:54.500
uh,
the idea of the very important thing and bogged them as you need to make them

1614
01:39:54.501 --> 01:39:57.170
steady,
do not make them jerky in any way.

1615
01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:01.700
The only thing that bottom that sudden is that release,
otherwise steady,
steady,

1616
01:40:01.730 --> 01:40:02.563
steady.

1617
01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:05.140
<v 0>And when you're,
when you're holding the contraction,</v>

1618
01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:09.940
and this is hard to quantify,
but uh,
as a guideline,

1619
01:40:09.941 --> 01:40:13.510
what percentage of maximal contraction is that?

1620
01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:17.770
<v 4>You know,
there are various,
there are various methods.</v>

1621
01:40:18.170 --> 01:40:23.080
Some of them attempt for you to bring the attention to a very,
very high level.

1622
01:40:23.590 --> 01:40:26.890
Gradually still very gradually but very too high level to the point where the

1623
01:40:26.891 --> 01:40:30.520
muscle literally shuts down something called Golgi tendon organ just fires

1624
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:33.910
mostly just goes,
ah,
that's an advanced technique.
It takes,

1625
01:40:33.911 --> 01:40:36.010
takes a lot of practice.
Uh,

1626
01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:40.870
you can go or you can just go for a very steady tension of about 30% and just

1627
01:40:40.871 --> 01:40:43.900
try to stay there for pretty much as long as you can handle it.

1628
01:40:44.410 --> 01:40:47.500
Just the important thing is that the tension doesn't diminish,
you know,
whatever.

1629
01:40:47.501 --> 01:40:50.290
When you feel like the tension is about to diminish whatever level that you've

1630
01:40:50.291 --> 01:40:54.310
chosen,
then you just release and then you pry it a farther prior to before,

1631
01:40:55.190 --> 01:40:56.850
<v 0>uh,
mark,
uh,</v>

1632
01:40:56.930 --> 01:41:01.040
Chang has one of the most impressive Turkish getups I've ever seen.

1633
01:41:02.450 --> 01:41:05.950
Very impressive.
As if for people who are not familiar with that move,
you could,

1634
01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:10.130
you could certainly do a search and see some examples.
That is a very,
very,

1635
01:41:10.131 --> 01:41:11.150
very technical move.

1636
01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:12.690
<v 4>Uh,
and the Turkish get up.</v>

1637
01:41:12.691 --> 01:41:16.710
The beautiful thing about the Turkish get up that somebody like yourself who is

1638
01:41:16.711 --> 01:41:20.670
a minimalist when appreciate is you get done so much with so little.

1639
01:41:21.330 --> 01:41:26.330
It's one of those amazing all around want to stop shop exercises and some food

1640
01:41:26.551 --> 01:41:27.840
for thought for people in general.

1641
01:41:27.841 --> 01:41:31.260
When you think about training earlier we talked about where he straight offs,

1642
01:41:31.261 --> 01:41:36.261
what to do in the program is training is just like a budget budget for a person

1643
01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:40.320
who has a regular paycheck.
So you have to decide,

1644
01:41:40.590 --> 01:41:43.860
am I going to buy a couch or I'm going to go on vacation,

1645
01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:49.640
am I going to get in debt and do both?
I'm going to buy the glue,

1646
01:41:49.650 --> 01:41:52.650
the good couch and not go on vacation or buy a cheap couch and take a short

1647
01:41:52.651 --> 01:41:55.980
vacation.
You see my point.
So there were a lot of choices,

1648
01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:59.310
a lot of trade offs and these trade offs have to do with both.
Your time,

1649
01:41:59.730 --> 01:42:01.830
but also where the capacity of your endocrine system,

1650
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:06.030
your endocrine system can only handle so much training and all these different

1651
01:42:06.031 --> 01:42:08.070
types of training that they are added up.

1652
01:42:08.071 --> 01:42:11.130
And plus he also have the stresses of your life and so on.

1653
01:42:11.370 --> 01:42:15.720
So whenever you're deciding on what it is that you do for your exercise,

1654
01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:17.910
you have to identify really what's important.

1655
01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:22.890
It's tripped and on essential and uh,
make compromises and sacrifices somewhere.

1656
01:42:24.390 --> 01:42:26.840
<v 0>Yeah,
true.
For so many areas.</v>

1657
01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:32.740
I want it to come back to something you said about oversharing earlier and the,

1658
01:42:33.110 --> 01:42:37.270
uh,
cause it was the,
uh,
the,
the,
the flaws or the,

1659
01:42:37.271 --> 01:42:41.120
the dangers of oversharing and malfunction,
the malfunction even better.

1660
01:42:41.121 --> 01:42:45.380
I've oversharing,
so that's kind my,
my business model I guess.
But

1661
01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:49.390
the,
uh,
the I'd love to

1662
01:42:49.810 --> 01:42:51.520
<v 4>is my opinion.
I'm not judging.</v>

1663
01:42:51.650 --> 01:42:53.870
<v 0>Oh,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
You can feel free to judge.
I think.</v>

1664
01:42:53.871 --> 01:42:57.230
I think that oversharing is a problem also.
But,
uh,

1665
01:42:57.231 --> 01:43:02.231
I'd love to hear your thoughts on what Americans could learn from,

1666
01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:09.150
uh,
perhaps the culture you grew up in,

1667
01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:13.400
the former Soviet Union or vice versa.
Because I personally,

1668
01:43:13.401 --> 01:43:15.050
and this is not meant as a slight at all,

1669
01:43:15.051 --> 01:43:19.590
I have so much respect for so many people in the former Soviet Union.
Uh,
I've,

1670
01:43:20.090 --> 01:43:23.810
most of my observation has been in the,
in the sports arena,
a sports arena.

1671
01:43:23.811 --> 01:43:24.021
I mean,

1672
01:43:24.021 --> 01:43:27.560
looking at people like Constantine Constantine off or Dimitri cloak off or just

1673
01:43:27.561 --> 01:43:29.210
these,
these amazing specimens.

1674
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:34.280
But I haven't very tough time when I meet some people from the former Soviet

1675
01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:38.540
Union socially with,
uh,
getting through the cultural differences.
And I'm usually,

1676
01:43:38.541 --> 01:43:42.540
I don't usually find that hard unless there's a lot of vodka involved.
Um,

1677
01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:46.320
<v 4>but well,
that's,
that's the social lubricant to need to a,</v>

1678
01:43:46.330 --> 01:43:47.560
you just need to drink more vodka.

1679
01:43:50.250 --> 01:43:52.250
<v 0>What,
what,
what could Americans</v>

1680
01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:57.230
<v 4>learn from,
uh,
from the culture you grew up in or vice versa?
Okay.
Well,</v>

1681
01:43:57.231 --> 01:43:59.390
first of all,
I'm speaking about this Sobeys coucher.

1682
01:43:59.510 --> 01:44:01.790
I'm not talking about the current culture,

1683
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.750
the Post Soviet college here because unfortunate,

1684
01:44:05.751 --> 01:44:10.751
this is my observation that oftentimes when different countries learn something

1685
01:44:12.770 --> 01:44:17.180
from America,
they choose to learn,
not that things that are worth learning,
right.

1686
01:44:17.570 --> 01:44:22.570
I really would like to see for Russia to learn about a free enterprise,

1687
01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:28.820
about a fair competition,
about freedom.

1688
01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:33.080
And unfortunately the things they are learning and are not,

1689
01:44:33.230 --> 01:44:37.660
these are like reality to me.
That's what they're learning and that's,

1690
01:44:37.661 --> 01:44:39.620
that's not unique to rush it.
That's,

1691
01:44:39.670 --> 01:44:41.900
that's pretty universal around the world for some reason.

1692
01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:44.780
Instead of getting the best from America,

1693
01:44:44.781 --> 01:44:48.390
people are just sort of getting the Las Vegas version America

1694
01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:52.910
and what people can learn,

1695
01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:57.890
what Americans can learn is they can learn to limit their choices.

1696
01:44:57.950 --> 01:45:00.320
You mentioned earlier and the paradox of choice,

1697
01:45:00.321 --> 01:45:03.770
they was embarrassed Schwartz book,
right?
That's right.
It's a very good book.

1698
01:45:03.771 --> 01:45:07.460
I enjoyed the book very much and I think that is,
I think that is very true.

1699
01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:09.800
When there's so many choices to exercise,

1700
01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:13.220
these choices are difficult.

1701
01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:17.890
It takes a lot of processing power.
There was a great,
uh,

1702
01:45:18.050 --> 01:45:23.050
moment in a Phil Moscow on the Hudson and old film with Robin Williams where he

1703
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:29.480
walks into a,
an American grocery store and he sees coffee everywhere.
He says,

1704
01:45:29.481 --> 01:45:31.490
coffee,
coffee,
coffee,
and he just passes out.

1705
01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:36.820
So what is very difficult in this country is exercising the choice because

1706
01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:40.940
options are just so many and choices are difficult.

1707
01:45:41.390 --> 01:45:42.740
And in fact,

1708
01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:46.640
you will find out that a number of eastern Europeans who have failed to

1709
01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:51.440
assimilate with failed to make the life in America are the ones we just have a

1710
01:45:51.441 --> 01:45:52.670
hard time making choices.

1711
01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:55.460
They're used to for a lot of choices being made for them.

1712
01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:59.180
And there was obvious downside to that in terms of freedom.

1713
01:45:59.420 --> 01:46:02.390
There was obviously an op side of it because there's,

1714
01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:07.220
there are fewer distractions.
So you,
uh,
personally,
not youtube,

1715
01:46:07.250 --> 01:46:08.083
but the listeners,

1716
01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:13.190
you need to figure out how to limit your choices then made these choices and

1717
01:46:13.191 --> 01:46:16.410
stick to them.
The Constantino and the cloaker.

1718
01:46:16.411 --> 01:46:18.500
When these other Russian athletes,

1719
01:46:18.501 --> 01:46:23.501
you mentioned these guys do not train with 360 degree bud's queasiness,

1720
01:46:24.321 --> 01:46:25.310
God curl bench.

1721
01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:30.340
That GBC in the typical gym is guys have the basics and they just hammer just to

1722
01:46:30.861 --> 01:46:35.030
wrap.
So the hammer and the basics and the,

1723
01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:38.480
I'm a big admirer of the free enterprise system.
Unfortunately,

1724
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:43.990
as much as that's worked in so many fields and industries is completely failed

1725
01:46:44.330 --> 01:46:47.150
in,
uh,
the exercise industry,
the fitness industry,

1726
01:46:47.570 --> 01:46:51.960
because it's constantly chasing its tail tail with a novelty,
the new,

1727
01:46:51.961 --> 01:46:55.770
the best or whatever,
and as a fad,
that just goes away again.

1728
01:46:56.220 --> 01:47:01.140
But the simple fact is certain things just do not change.
What I think also,

1729
01:47:01.141 --> 01:47:05.280
I think Americans could really learn is they could learn from themselves.

1730
01:47:05.281 --> 01:47:09.570
That can learn from the past.
I have a great,

1731
01:47:09.950 --> 01:47:10.740
uh,

1732
01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:15.740
idealized image of America that I did when I was growing up and that came from

1733
01:47:17.370 --> 01:47:20.010
my favorite film is in the magnificent seven.

1734
01:47:21.150 --> 01:47:24.690
It's interesting that they showed that film when my dad was in the service and

1735
01:47:24.691 --> 01:47:27.780
there was Kim health first and then I saw it many years later.

1736
01:47:27.781 --> 01:47:32.781
They showed it again and I was just very impressed with this ethics that you

1737
01:47:33.691 --> 01:47:38.250
could see.
They're these very strong,
so if we're aligned,

1738
01:47:38.251 --> 01:47:42.150
people who don't a waste towards,

1739
01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:46.020
who do not get stuck in a part of hierarchy,

1740
01:47:46.380 --> 01:47:49.050
who should a ride into the sunset,
I think just very powerful.

1741
01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:54.870
I think if America we just a little bit more reconnect with what makes his,

1742
01:47:54.990 --> 01:47:59.530
makes it great,
it wouldn't have to search elsewhere.
Uh,

1743
01:47:59.610 --> 01:48:02.880
we can talk about American exceptionalism and there is such a thing as American

1744
01:48:02.881 --> 01:48:07.881
exceptionalism because no other country has that same sense of freedom,

1745
01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:14.440
has the same opportunities and that same spirit of everything as possible.

1746
01:48:16.170 --> 01:48:19.890
No other place.
So even people who go out and start criticizing America,

1747
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:22.830
that's usually,
it happens because of anime.
That's really all it is.

1748
01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:28.380
So maybe let's just go back to the older times.

1749
01:48:28.410 --> 01:48:31.770
Maybe some of them didn't even exist.
The old west,
whatever it is,

1750
01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:36.960
where just people,
I had the pride in being pioneers.

1751
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:42.090
The pride in just getting ahead or let's even look Tim,

1752
01:48:42.091 --> 01:48:45.810
lesson one,
look in the fifties or sixties like today,

1753
01:48:47.070 --> 01:48:50.850
where do the brightest young people,
what did they end up doing?

1754
01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:56.130
They ended up designing APPS,
right?
Well,

1755
01:48:56.131 --> 01:48:59.610
in the fifties and sixties they design space ships.

1756
01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:02.900
So the dreams were just so much bigger.
And right now,
who,

1757
01:49:02.901 --> 01:49:05.340
who was this hot new APP?
Ooh,
golly.
Gee Martha.

1758
01:49:05.850 --> 01:49:10.710
So let's just try to go back to what made this country great to a grand vision

1759
01:49:10.860 --> 01:49:13.980
and not just petty little APP stuff.

1760
01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:20.460
<v 0>Who are some of the,
the people for you,
whether current day or,</v>

1761
01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:24.170
uh,
hundreds of years ago or more,
uh,

1762
01:49:24.270 --> 01:49:28.650
who exemplify the best of what America has to offer?

1763
01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:31.020
If people listening,
we're looking for role models,

1764
01:49:31.050 --> 01:49:35.760
role models to revisit or to try to emulate.
Who would you put on that list?

1765
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:40.740
<v 4>I'll say the founding fathers.
Ben Franklin,
definitely</v>

1766
01:49:42.490 --> 01:49:46.170
there.
So many great people in American history.
They're worth emulating.

1767
01:49:46.171 --> 01:49:50.260
There's the great generation of the World War II,
these really quiet people.

1768
01:49:50.261 --> 01:49:52.730
We just went and got the job done and uh,

1769
01:49:52.990 --> 01:49:56.740
then twine and complain about the lack of opportunities and life is hard.

1770
01:49:56.741 --> 01:50:00.370
Then we're having it so tough.
There are many.

1771
01:50:02.230 --> 01:50:05.320
I have,
uh,
and just,
you know,
even people who are just,

1772
01:50:05.321 --> 01:50:08.740
even people who are younger,
I have a good friend named stony.

1773
01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:13.420
Stony was a marine.
He a father of Vietnam and just stone.

1774
01:50:13.421 --> 01:50:16.870
He's just such a great person who is such a positive outlook on life.

1775
01:50:17.290 --> 01:50:20.170
He just uses a true American.
You will not hear and complaining.

1776
01:50:20.590 --> 01:50:22.540
He thinks that America is by great things.

1777
01:50:22.630 --> 01:50:27.190
And that's what seriously this is what disappoints me as an,

1778
01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:30.730
as a naturalized American because I think America is so much bigger,

1779
01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:34.690
so much better than it's than it has been.

1780
01:50:35.140 --> 01:50:37.210
So just look back into it.
It was before.

1781
01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:43.320
<v 0>No,
I,
I'm of course born and raised here,
but very much feel the same way.</v>

1782
01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:48.000
And it's been uplifting to me though to see that although the,

1783
01:50:50.250 --> 01:50:50.641
the,

1784
01:50:50.641 --> 01:50:55.641
the kids building apps as some of which are very rural changing I think,

1785
01:50:55.741 --> 01:50:59.910
but many of which are not and are very trivial.
Uh,
if,
if we look at Apps,

1786
01:50:59.911 --> 01:51:04.050
it's just the new software applications and mobile devices.

1787
01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:06.270
That is the new computers.
There are people changing the world.
But there,

1788
01:51:06.271 --> 01:51:09.480
there's also been a resurgence of,

1789
01:51:10.890 --> 01:51:15.840
of people aspiring to be like Elon Musk for instance,
who is building spaceships.

1790
01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:17.860
Uh,
and uh,
that,

1791
01:51:17.870 --> 01:51:22.530
that's been really reassuring to me in some ways.
But,
uh,

1792
01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:25.260
the,
the Ben Franklin example I think is a great one.

1793
01:51:25.261 --> 01:51:26.740
And for anyone who hasn't read the,

1794
01:51:26.741 --> 01:51:31.200
the Walter Isaacson biography of Benjamin Franklin.
It's a fascinating,

1795
01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:35.520
fascinating,
uh,
picture of,
uh,
uh,
deep,
uh,

1796
01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:39.790
very capable but also hilarious figure.
Uh,

1797
01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:43.200
I wanted to just in,
in,
uh,
in closing

1798
01:51:44.790 --> 01:51:47.070
a few more questions,
uh,

1799
01:51:47.130 --> 01:51:52.130
but the first is how do you personally limit your choices to avoid the coffee,

1800
01:51:53.191 --> 01:51:57.600
coffee,
coffee experience and the,
and the distraction.

1801
01:51:57.930 --> 01:52:01.320
How do you,
what are some ways in which you,
uh,

1802
01:52:02.310 --> 01:52:05.220
you contain those,
those choices in life

1803
01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:08.310
<v 4>to him?
Professionally?
I use this,</v>

1804
01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:10.710
I use the same technique that you use for voting.

1805
01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:14.160
I remember that you mentioned that you don't like following the current current

1806
01:52:14.161 --> 01:52:15.930
affairs before you vote.

1807
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:20.180
You just talked to a number of people whose opinion you respect and who old the

1808
01:52:20.181 --> 01:52:21.750
way,
who delivered the way you do.

1809
01:52:22.350 --> 01:52:25.950
So I do the same thing and training pretty much.
So when I do,
and I do research,

1810
01:52:25.951 --> 01:52:28.830
most of my time is spent reading the classics.

1811
01:52:28.831 --> 01:52:32.610
So we had tests and studies and uh,
once in a while,

1812
01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:37.940
either rise up on periscope and I'll talk to several people I respect in the

1813
01:52:38.281 --> 01:52:40.950
industry and as what's going on,
what's new.

1814
01:52:41.610 --> 01:52:44.840
And they will just brief me on that most of the time,
frankly,
nothing's going on.

1815
01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:50.900
So this is an example of,
this is an example of that.
My technique.

1816
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:55.940
I am very ruthless about limiting my communications.

1817
01:52:56.540 --> 01:52:59.660
I am very protective of my time to write.

1818
01:52:59.750 --> 01:53:03.240
I'm very protective of my time to read.
And,
uh,

1819
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:06.103
that's what it,

1820
01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:08.450
<v 0>no,
that's a,</v>

1821
01:53:09.210 --> 01:53:13.760
I think this is a really important topic and I appreciate the answers.

1822
01:53:13.761 --> 01:53:16.610
And I also encourage everyone to think about how they can create their own

1823
01:53:16.611 --> 01:53:17.210
choice,

1824
01:53:17.210 --> 01:53:21.950
minimal lifestyle so they can preserve their creativity and unique abilities for

1825
01:53:21.951 --> 01:53:22.784
the storage.

1826
01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:27.580
<v 4>We need to,
we need to,
we need to teach people around us,
be,
uh,</v>

1827
01:53:28.210 --> 01:53:32.290
to understand that not to over communicate.
It's again,

1828
01:53:32.291 --> 01:53:36.190
it's an interesting modern phenomenon that it's a play by play.

1829
01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:39.730
Everything has to be a play by play.
It's like,
you know,
kids in the car.

1830
01:53:39.770 --> 01:53:44.050
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?
No,
we're driving,
we're on route.

1831
01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:45.490
And uh,
no.

1832
01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:53.880
<v 0>So,
uh,
this has been really fun,
Pablo.
I really appreciate the time.
Uh,</v>

1833
01:53:54.230 --> 01:53:57.410
how,
what,
what are you up to focused on currently?

1834
01:53:57.411 --> 01:54:00.430
Where can people learn more about you?
Uh,

1835
01:54:00.980 --> 01:54:04.830
where would you suggest people look to,
to learn more about,
uh,

1836
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.870
the things you work on?

1837
01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:08.460
<v 4>Thank you,
Tim.
My company's called strong.</v>

1838
01:54:08.461 --> 01:54:12.060
First strong for his.com is the website and,
uh,

1839
01:54:12.120 --> 01:54:15.150
we are about changing lives,

1840
01:54:15.151 --> 01:54:17.940
making the world a stronger place strew through strength.

1841
01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:23.250
So we teach various skills through courses,
certifications and so on.

1842
01:54:23.790 --> 01:54:27.870
So just we stopped by@strongforhis.com and I also,
uh,

1843
01:54:27.990 --> 01:54:32.370
recommend you pick up a copy of my book,
Kettle Bells,
simple and sinister.

1844
01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:36.300
And I can assure you that this book definitely fits with the spirit of this

1845
01:54:36.301 --> 01:54:40.020
conversation.
It was absolutely nothing fluff,
no fluff there whatsoever.

1846
01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:45.650
<v 0>And,
uh,
just,
just to,
to,
to also add my,</v>

1847
01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:49.600
my own 2 cents related to my direct experience.
Uh,

1848
01:54:50.350 --> 01:54:52.900
Pablos methods,
your methods,
Pablo,
uh,

1849
01:54:52.901 --> 01:54:57.470
and those that you've distilled from all of the mines and practitioners,

1850
01:54:57.490 --> 01:55:02.010
the operators that you've researched and observed a really do work.
So,
uh,
for,

1851
01:55:02.020 --> 01:55:03.310
for those people who know me,

1852
01:55:03.311 --> 01:55:08.120
I obviously conduct hundreds and thousands of various experiments and we might,

1853
01:55:08.121 --> 01:55:11.740
my house right now just looks like a,
a laboratory slash pharmacy.

1854
01:55:11.741 --> 01:55:16.670
There's so much crap strewn about related to all the various odd,
uh,
you know,

1855
01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:19.000
human Guinea pig stuff that I'm doing.
And I,

1856
01:55:19.010 --> 01:55:21.780
I've really run the gamut and,

1857
01:55:21.781 --> 01:55:26.781
and tested so many things available out there and in a world that tends to

1858
01:55:27.041 --> 01:55:31.600
complicate to profit,
I think you really simplify to results.

1859
01:55:31.630 --> 01:55:34.570
And so I commend you for that and I've seen tremendous,

1860
01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:39.100
tremendous transformations in my own life,
thanks to a lot of your advice.

1861
01:55:39.101 --> 01:55:43.980
So I really encourage people to check it out.
And this was,
this was a,
so,
uh,
uh,

1862
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:48.300
hopefully sometimes we can do with that around to in person buds.
Uh,

1863

Pavel.
