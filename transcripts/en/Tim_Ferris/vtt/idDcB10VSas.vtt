Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:06.090
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.140
I'm a cybernetic organism living.

4
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.170
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by legal zoom,</v>

5
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.800
which more than 2 million Americans have used to help start their businesses.

6
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.270
Past guests even such as well,
wordpress lead developer,

7
00:00:34.271 --> 00:00:38.530
CEO of Automattic,
Matt Mullenweg now valued at more than a billion dollars,

8
00:00:38.531 --> 00:00:41.110
have used legal zoom to help with their business needs,

9
00:00:41.111 --> 00:00:43.240
specifically in his case to form his company.

10
00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:46.330
But legal zoom isn't just for launching your business.

11
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.440
Their services include everything from helping you to manage changing tax laws,

12
00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:54.970
reviewing contracts,
creating Ndas,
nondisclosure agreements,
important stuff,

13
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.830
handling lease agreements and assisting with really any other legal challenge,

14
00:00:59.831 --> 00:01:04.300
hurdle,
inconvenience that typically takes time and effort away from running your

15
00:01:04.301 --> 00:01:05.110
business.

16
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.590
The best part is that you won't get charged by the hour because legal zoom isn't

17
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.271
a law firm,

18
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:14.271
so they won't be running the clock up and spinning circles just to raise your

19
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.000
bill.
Instead,

20
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:19.600
they just ask you to pay one low upfront price for whatever it is that you're

21
00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:21.040
looking to get all the card style.

22
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.690
So visit legal zoom.com and check out their business section for all of their

23
00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:28.270

24
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.320
that's the terminology in the copy that they suggest.

25
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.280
I don't know what the special savings is folks,
but it's titillating.

26
00:01:36.281 --> 00:01:37.600
If you want special savings,

Tim,

30
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.190
I get asked all the time,
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

31
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.100
And my answer is inevitably Athletic Greens,

32
00:01:58.101 --> 00:02:00.590
it is your all in one nutritional insurance.

33
00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:02.360
I recommended it in the four hour body,

34
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.380
did not get paid for that and I travel with it to avoid getting sick.

35
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.380
I take it in the mornings to ensure optimal performance.

36
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.850
It just covers all my basis.

37
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.870
If I can't get what I need through whole food meals throughout the rest of the

38
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.880
day.
If you want to give athletic Greens to try,

39

40
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.810
I always travel with at least three or four of these.

41
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.090
This represents a $100 value,

42
00:02:26.091 --> 00:02:30.110
so if you by Athletic Greens you get an extra $100 in free product,

46
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.060
Hello boys and girls.

47
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:48.390
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

48
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.570
This is an experimental episode and my guest so to speak is someone I've known

49
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:58.650
for quite a long time now.
Sam Harris,
Sam Harris,
you may know the name,

50
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.470
received a degree in philosophy from Stanford University and a phd in

51
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:03.880
neuroscience from Ucla.

52
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:08.170
He's the author of many bestselling books including the interfaith letter to a

53
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:10.570
Christian nation,
the moral landscape,
freewill lying,

54
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:15.370
waking up and Islam in the future of tolerance,
a dialogue which he coauthored.

55
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.850
He also hosts the popular podcast waking up with Sam Harris.

56
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:21.610
You can find him on Twitter at Sam Harris Org,

57
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.640
that's h a r r I s Sam Harris Org and on the web@samharris.org.

58
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.820
But this episode came about because Sam asked me somewhere between six and nine

59
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:38.011
months ago to be a Beta tester for a new app he was creating and ostensibly it

60
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:39.970
was a meditation APP.

61
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.150
It's called waking up and you can find it@wakingup.com which I highly recommend.

62
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.180
I anticipated it would be good because Sam is always good and he's one of those

63
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.250
rare humans who very irritably seems to think and speak in finished prose.

64
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:56.260
He also has a voice,

65
00:03:56.261 --> 00:04:01.261
one of the few voices that can put you into a semi psychedelic state while you

66
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:05.020
were completely sober.
And if that makes no sense,

67
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:09.580
it will make sense experientially once you get to the end of this episode.

68
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.320
In any case,
there are some great apps out there for different purposes.
Uh,

69
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.970
among them,
oak made by my friend Kevin Rose for meditation also.
Fantastic.

70
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.240
Sam's approach is a little different and as he puts it in the audio that you're

71
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:30.460
going to listen to in part he says you do not have to be the best at anything to

72
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:32.800
be almost uniquely qualified for something.

73
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.800
He is a very unusual combination of experiences and areas of expertise and his

74
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.330
particular approach here is that of a progression and what I like is that

75
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:47.170
there's a logical progression,
one,
two,
three white belt,
yellow belt,

76
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.230
et Cetera in terms of layering on different types of training for learning,

77
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:57.010
the skill of meditation and it's really an experience of exploring
consciousness.

78
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.260
He also gets into quite a bit more,
it talks about his experiences with MDA,

79
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.160
his spiritual exploration,
God forbid suit I did there in India,

80
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.770
contact with so called Gurus Dueling masters.

81
00:05:08.771 --> 00:05:13.771
The goal is the path duality versus nonduality and there are a lot of gems

82
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.620
within that you can apply to business,
your personal life,
et Cetera,

83
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:22.360
because guess what the precursor to all of this is your mind and consciousness,

84
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.630
so learning how to hone the mind and your perceptions is really paramount to

85
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.650
mastering on some level everything else.

86
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.570
If you want to just jump to the meditations and lessons that he presents you can

87
00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:42.370
jump to,
but 47 minutes after he starts and uh,
uh,

88
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.290
those of you who are even more impatient,

89
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:49.291
I'm going to be publishing a companion episode to this immediately after this

90
00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:51.070
one.
So think of it as simultaneously.

91
00:05:51.071 --> 00:05:52.660
If you go back to where you got this podcast,

92
00:05:52.661 --> 00:05:55.870
you'll find a shorter one of say 10 or 20 minutes.

93
00:05:55.871 --> 00:05:58.220
I'm not sure exactly how long that will take

94
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.000
<v 2>you through meditations and lessons.</v>

95
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.920
I did one meditation first thing in the morning and one lesson in the late

96
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.820
afternoon to wind down.

97
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:12.821
That's how I approached it so that you can just hit play and jump immediately

98
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:15.580
into guided meditations.
And uh,

99
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.240
they will offer different approaches to give you a flavor.
In any case,

100
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.940
the lessons themselves,
we'll jump in to thinking about death,

101
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:26.360
the mystery of being.
And in the companion episode,
the logic of practice,

102
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.190
this is a somewhat dense episode.
I encourage you to stick with it.

103
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.840
If it's too tough,
if you find yourself wandering in the mind,

104
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.600
which of course you're going to be training in a sense against,

105
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.070
then you can jump to minute 47 after Sam starts for the meditations.

106
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.070
Or you can go to the companion episode.
In either case,

107
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.100
I really suggest checking out waking up.com that is the APP itself.

108
00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:54.140
I have no financial stake,
nothing,
uh,

109
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:59.170
to gain other than recommending you to a tool that I've found to be incredibly

110
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:02.900
powerful.
And that is shared by some people.

111
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.530
I also respect greatly who are Beta testers like Dr Peter Attia,

112
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:09.410
who's also been on the podcast.
So without further ado,

113
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.960
and that was a lot of a do but I think necessary context,

114
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:17.380
please enjoy this exploration of your own mind and consciousness with Sam

115
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.600
Harris.
Hello,
Tim Ferriss fans.

116
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.190
This is Sam Harris of the waking up podcast and now the waking up course,

117
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.580
which was a app that I just released on Ios and soon to be on android.

118
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:35.953
And,
uh,

119
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:40.970
my friend Tim has very generously invited me onto his podcast to preview this

120
00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:45.230
course for you and to speak a little bit about meditation.

121
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.190
And I'm very happy to do that.
First,
a warning.

122
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.640
In addition to just talking about the course and about meditation,

123
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.350
Tim has asked me to preview a few of the guided meditations from the APP.

124
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:03.100
So parts of this podcast won't make for a very good listening in the car or at

125
00:08:03.861 --> 00:08:08.861
the gym or while multitasking to get value from these sections and to not be

126
00:08:09.591 --> 00:08:13.700
bored by the periods of silence.
You really need to be paying attention.

127
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.820
So if you're not in that situation now,
uh,

128
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.000
you might save this whole podcast for another time.

129
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.790
I'll let you know when I'm dropping them in and how long they are.

130
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.620
So if you insist on listening to this while you are kite surfing or hacking some

131
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:32.950
government installation or staggering around south by southwest and full ketosis

132
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.790
or whatever it is that the average Tim Ferriss fan does on a day like today,

133
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.160
you will be okay.
Okay.

134
00:08:40.161 --> 00:08:45.161
So I'm going to talk for a while about what I'm attempting to do with this

135
00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:49.530
course and why I've released it as an APP.
Of course,
there,

136
00:08:49.531 --> 00:08:53.240
there are several meditation apps out there and many of them are quite good.

137
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:58.260
There's calm and headspace and my friends Dan Harris and Joseph Goldstein have

138
00:08:58.261 --> 00:09:02.580
the 10% happier app.
Tim's buddy,
Kevin Rose has the OIC app.

139
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.750
These apps really are quite good and they will definitely teach you how to

140
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:10.020
meditate and while I cover similar ground in the waking up course,

141
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.190
it's not just a meditation APP.
I'm attempting something else too,

142
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.570
but before I get into the app first let me tell you a little bit about my

143
00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:21.540
background.
For those of you who are not familiar with it,

144
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:26.520
I got into meditation at the end of my sophomore year in college just when I

145
00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:31.521
turned 20 and this was on the heels of a psychedelic experience that provided a

146
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.960
fairly startling firmware upgrade of my mind.

147
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.240
I've written about psychedelics and supportive and also in fairly cautionary

148
00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:46.350
ways,
especially in my book waking up and actually there's a,

149
00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:51.351
there's a main chapter on that topic that's available both in print and an audio

150
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:56.880
on my website under the title drugs and the meaning of life.
In fact,

151
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.510
Tim has not only referenced it on this podcast,

152
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:05.511
but I think the audio is available in one of his earlier podcast and I'll say a

153
00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:11.301
few words about how I view the difference between psychedelics and meditation in

154
00:10:11.701 --> 00:10:12.534
a minute.

155
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.950
Actually I think I should just read you the first few pages of my book waking up

156
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:22.520
because it gives the full context about how I came to this topic and how I think

157
00:10:22.681 --> 00:10:27.090
about the nature of mind and the role that my experience with psychedelics play

158
00:10:27.091 --> 00:10:30.510
it here and also how I came to the practice of meditation.

159
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.080
So here's how the book begins.

160
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:39.330
Once participated in a 23 day wilderness program and the mountains of Colorado,

161
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.040
if the purpose of this course was to expose students to dangerous lightning and

162
00:10:44.041 --> 00:10:48.360
half the world's mosquitoes,
it was fulfilled on the first day.
What was,

163
00:10:48.361 --> 00:10:48.901
in essence,

164
00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:53.670
a forced march through hundreds of miles of back country culminated in a ritual

165
00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:58.560
known as the solo where we were finally permitted to rest alone on the outskirts

166
00:10:58.561 --> 00:11:02.850
of a gorgeous Alpine lake.
For three days of fasting and contemplation,

167
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:07.940
I had just turned 16 and this was my first taste of true solitude since exited

168
00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:08.790
in my mother's womb.

169
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.520
It proved a sufficient provocation after a long nap and a glance at the icy

170
00:11:14.521 --> 00:11:15.420
waters of the lake.

171
00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.340
The promising young man I imagined myself to be was quickly cut down by

172
00:11:20.341 --> 00:11:23.640
loneliness and boredom.
I filled the pages of my journal,

173
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.390
not with the insights of a budding naturalist philosopher or mystic,

174
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.020
but with a list of the foods on which I intended to gorge myself.

175
00:11:31.021 --> 00:11:32.940
The incident I return to civilization.

176
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.880
Judging from the state of my consciousness.
At the time,

177
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.440
millions of years of hominid evolution had produced nothing more transcendent

178
00:11:40.441 --> 00:11:43.170
than a craving for a cheeseburger and a chocolate milkshake.

179
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:48.270
I found the experience of sitting undisturbed for three days and mid pristine

180
00:11:48.271 --> 00:11:51.750
breezes and starlight with nothing to do but contemplate the mystery of my

181
00:11:51.751 --> 00:11:52.584
existence.

182
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.770
Be a source of perfect misery for which I could see not so much as a glimmer of

183
00:11:56.771 --> 00:12:00.730
my own contribution.
My letters home in their plaintiff,

184
00:12:00.731 --> 00:12:04.660
Nis and self pity rivaled any written at Shiloh or globally.

185
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.950
So I was more than a little surprised when several members of our party,

186
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.890
most of whom were a decade older than I described,

187
00:12:11.891 --> 00:12:16.270
their days and nights of solitude in positive,
even transformational terms,

188
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.390
I simply didn't know what to make of their claims to happiness.

189
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.520
How could someone's happiness increase when all the material sources of pleasure

190
00:12:24.521 --> 00:12:27.640
and distraction had been removed at that age?

191
00:12:27.641 --> 00:12:31.480
The nature of my mind did not seem to interest me.
Only my life did.

192
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.620
I was utterly oblivious to how different life would be if the quality of my
mind,

193
00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:38.800
where to change our minds are all we have.

194
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.550
They're all we've ever had and they're all we can offer others.

195
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.410
This might not be obvious,

196
00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.040
especially when there are aspects of your life that seem in need of improvement.

197
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:53.050
When your goals are unrealized or you're struggling to find a career where you

198
00:12:53.051 --> 00:12:56.080
have relationships that need repairing,
but it's the truth.

199
00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.220
Every experience you've ever had has been shaped by your mind.

200
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:05.890
Every relationship is as good or as bad as it is because of the minds involved.

201
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.560
If you are perpetually angry,
depressed,
confused,
and unloving,

202
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.720
or your attention is elsewhere,

203
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.590
it won't matter how successful you become or who is in your life.

204
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.210
You won't enjoy any of it.

205
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:24.400
Most of us could easily compile a list of goals we want to achieve or personal

206
00:13:24.401 --> 00:13:25.960
problems that need to be solved,

207
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.560
but what is the real significance of every item on such a list?

208
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:34.720
Everything we want to accomplish to paint the house,
to learn a new language,

209
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:39.930
to find a better job is something that promises that if done it would allow us

210
00:13:40.961 --> 00:13:44.020
to finally relax and enjoy our lives and the present.

211
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.200
Generally speaking,
this is a false hope.

212
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.290
I'm not denying the importance of achieving one's goals,

213
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.430
maintaining one's health or keeping one's children clothed and fed.

214
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.300
But most of us spend our time seeking happiness and security without

215
00:13:58.301 --> 00:14:00.730
acknowledging the underlying purpose of our search.

216
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.060
Each of us is looking for a path back to the present.

217
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.900
We are trying to find good enough reasons to be satisfied.

218
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:11.890
Now acknowledging that this is the structure of the game that we're playing

219
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.720
allows us to play it differently.

220
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:18.940
How we pay attention to the present moment largely determines the character of

221
00:14:18.941 --> 00:14:22.060
our experience and therefore the quality of our lives.

222
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:25.630
Mystics and contemplative have made this claim for ages,

223
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.230
but a growing body of scientific research now bears it out.

224
00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:35.410
A few years after my first painful encounter with solitude in the winter of 1987

225
00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:37.300
I took the drug three,

226
00:14:37.301 --> 00:14:42.301
four methylenedioxy and methylamphetamine Mtma commonly known as ecstasy.

227
00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.660
And my sense of the human mind's potential shifted profoundly.

228
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:52.470
Although MTMA would become ubiquitous a dance clubs and raves in the 1990s at

229
00:14:52.881 --> 00:14:56.930
the time,
I didn't know anyone of my generation who had tried it.
One evening.

230
00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.000
A few months before my 20th birthday,

231
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:01.700
a close friend and I decided to take the drug.

232
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.810
The setting of our experiment bore little resemblance to the conditions of

233
00:15:05.811 --> 00:15:09.530
Dionysian abandoned under which MDA is now often consumed.

234
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.510
We were alone in a house seated across from each other on opposite ends of the

235
00:15:14.511 --> 00:15:19.280
couch and engaged in quiet conversation as the chemical worked its way into our

236
00:15:19.281 --> 00:15:20.114
heads.

237
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.890
Unlike other drugs with which we were by then familiar marijuana and alcohol

238
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.400
MTMA produced no feeling of distortion in our senses.

239
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:33.350
Our mind seemed completely clear in the midst of this ordinariness.
However,

240
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:36.800
I was suddenly struck by the knowledge that I loved my friend.

241
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.910
They shouldn't have surprised me.
He was after all one of my best friends.

242
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:42.770
However,
at that age,

243
00:15:42.771 --> 00:15:46.010
I was not in the habit of dwelling on how much I love the men in my life.

244
00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:51.890
Now I could feel that I loved him and this feeling had ethical implications that

245
00:15:51.891 --> 00:15:55.280
suddenly seemed as profound as they now seem pedestrian on the page.

246
00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.620
I wanted him to be happy.

247
00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:03.320
That conviction came crashing down with such force that something seemed to give

248
00:16:03.321 --> 00:16:07.580
way inside me.
In fact,
the insight appeared to restructure my mind,

249
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.430
my capacity for envy.
For instance,

250
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.080
the sense of being diminished by the happiness or success of another person seem

251
00:16:15.081 --> 00:16:18.290
like a symptom of mental illness that had vanished.
Without a trace,

252
00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.890
I could no more who felt envy at that moment than I could have wanted to poke

253
00:16:21.891 --> 00:16:22.820
out my own eyes.

254
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:27.110
What did I care if my friend was better looking or a better athlete than I was?

255
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.870
If I could have bestowed these gifts on him,

256
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:34.460
I would have truly wanted him to be happy,
made his happiness my own.

257
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.300
A certain euphoria was creeping into these reflections perhaps,

258
00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:42.650
but the general feeling remained one of absolute sobriety and of moral and

259
00:16:42.651 --> 00:16:45.050
emotional clarity,
unlike any I had ever known.

260
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:49.880
It would not be too strong to say that I felt sane for the first time in my
life,

261
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.010
and yet the change in my consciousness seemed entirely straightforward.

262
00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:59.480
I was simply talking to my friend about what I don't recall and realize that I

263
00:16:59.481 --> 00:17:03.650
had ceased to be concerned about myself.
I was no longer anxious,

264
00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:07.490
self critical,
guarded by irony in competition,

265
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.140
avoiding embarrassment,

266
00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:14.270
ruminating about the past and future or making any other gesture of thought or

267
00:17:14.271 --> 00:17:16.340
attention that separated me from him.

268
00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.680
I was no longer watching myself through another person's eyes and then came the

269
00:17:21.681 --> 00:17:25.640
insight that irrevocably transformed my sense of how good human life could be.

270
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:31.430
I was feeling boundless love for one of my best friends and I suddenly realized

271
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.160
that if a stranger had walked through the door at that moment,

272
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.580
he or she would have been fully included in this love.

273
00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:39.920
Love was at bottom,

274
00:17:39.921 --> 00:17:44.921
impersonal and deeper than any personal history could justify indeed a

275
00:17:45.171 --> 00:17:46.880
transactional form of love.

276
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:50.400
I love you because now made no sense at all.

277
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.570
The interesting thing about this final shift in perspective was that it was not

278
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:56.610
driven by any change in the way I felt.

279
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.030
I was not overwhelmed by a new feeling of love.

280
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.330
The insight had more the character of a geometric proof.

281
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.950
It was as if having glimpse the properties of one set of parallel lines.

282
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:12.150
I suddenly understood what must be common to them all the moment I could find a

283
00:18:12.151 --> 00:18:13.500
voice with which to speak.

284
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:17.850
I discovered that this epiphany about the universality of love could be readily

285
00:18:17.851 --> 00:18:20.520
communicated.
My friend got the point at once.

286
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:24.630
All I had to do was ask him how he would feel in the presence of a total

287
00:18:24.631 --> 00:18:28.200
stranger at that moment and the same door opened in his mind.

288
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.460
It was simply obvious that love,
compassion,

289
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.210
and joy and the joy of others extended without limit.

290
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.580
The experience was not of love growing,
but if it's being no longer obscured,

291
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:46.260
love was as advertised by mystics and crackpots through the ages,

292
00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:47.670
a state of being.

293
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.350
How have we not seen this before and how could we overlook it ever again?

294
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.070
It would take me many years to put this experience into context.

295
00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:00.720
Until that moment I had viewed organized religion as merely a monument to the

296
00:19:00.721 --> 00:19:04.980
ignorance and superstition of our ancestors,
but I now knew that Jesus,

297
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:06.600
the Buddha,
loud sue,

298
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.530
and the other saints and sages of history had not all been epileptic

299
00:19:10.531 --> 00:19:12.090
schizophrenia,
x or frauds.

300
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:16.230
I still considered the world's religions to be mere intellectual ruins

301
00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.350
maintained that enormous economic and social costs,

302
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.700
but I now understood that important psychological truths could be found in the

303
00:19:23.701 --> 00:19:28.020
rubble.
Okay,
so that's how I started my book,
Waking Up,

304
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:34.130
which is a book about the nature of consciousness and how we can understand some

305
00:19:34.561 --> 00:19:39.150
of the life changing experiences people can have experience often described as

306
00:19:39.151 --> 00:19:40.530
mystical or spiritual,

307
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:45.870
but understand them in a 21st century rational,
scientific context.

308
00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.371
Some of you probably know,

309
00:19:47.371 --> 00:19:50.670
I've been a fairly vociferous critic of religion over the years.

310
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:55.110
I've written several books and participated in many debates,

311
00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.520
spelling out the reasons why.

312
00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:02.070
My basic view is that there's a difference between believing things for good

313
00:20:02.071 --> 00:20:04.350
reasons and believing things for bad reasons.

314
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.460
And this is the difference that we all recognize in every area of our lives.

315
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:14.210
Until the conversation turns to things like God and what happens after death and

316
00:20:15.241 --> 00:20:18.390
the origins of certain books like the Bible and the Koran,

317
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:24.170
my argument is that we can get what is most profound out of human life without

318
00:20:24.171 --> 00:20:28.020
lying to ourselves or to our children about the nature of reality.

319
00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.530
That's not to say that the universe might not be incredibly strange,

320
00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.470
whether it's science has everything figured out.
In fact,

321
00:20:34.471 --> 00:20:38.430
the university is incredibly strange and science does not have everything

322
00:20:38.431 --> 00:20:42.720
figured out.
But one thing should be absolutely clear.

323
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:48.410
The men and women who live 2000 years ago didn't have everything out either and

324
00:20:48.731 --> 00:20:50.140
on many crucial points,

325
00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:55.240
they were ignorant of things that every child learns in school today.
Okay.

326
00:20:55.241 --> 00:20:58.930
Like for instance,
that brains are somehow involved in producing mines.

327
00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.840
No one knew this 2000 years ago,

328
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:05.740
and to deny it today is intellectual irresponsible.

329
00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.970
So after I had the experience on Mtma I just described,

330
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:15.750
I spent the better part of my twenties seeking out a fairly esoteric education.

331
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:20.350
It wouldn't have been so esoteric in the 60s when many people were dropping out

332
00:21:20.351 --> 00:21:21.970
and going to India with the Beatles,

333
00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:27.070
but it was fairly rare to see someone my age doing this in the late eighties so

334
00:21:27.071 --> 00:21:32.050
most of my friends at the time were 20 years older than I was and I made many

335
00:21:32.051 --> 00:21:35.680
trips to India and they Paul to study with various meditation masters.

336
00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:39.520
I spent around a year and a half or two years on silent retreat,

337
00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.130
never for longer than three months at a time.

338
00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:47.650
That was spread out over my twenties I did a couple of three month retreats and

339
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:52.270
several two month retreats and one month retreats and many shorter ones,

340
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.450
mostly in the context of practicing Vipassana,

341
00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:59.860
otherwise known as mindfulness meditation,
but ultimately practicing Zobe Chan,

342
00:21:59.861 --> 00:22:02.920
which is a Tibetan practice that I'll talk about.
In fact,

343
00:22:02.921 --> 00:22:06.940
I should just read you another section of my book waking up because I spell out

344
00:22:06.941 --> 00:22:10.510
some important distinctions there.
There's a distinction.

345
00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:15.780
Generally speaking between gradual versus sudden notions of realization or

346
00:22:18.251 --> 00:22:22.450
awakening.
And this can seem totally paradoxical to people.

347
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:27.510
So I'm gonna read you a little bit about this and you'll get more of my

348
00:22:27.581 --> 00:22:28.450
background here.

349
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:34.300
This from a section in the book titled Gradual Versus Sudden Realization.

350
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:40.570
We wouldn't attempt to meditate or engage in any other contemplative practice if

351
00:22:40.571 --> 00:22:44.050
we didn't feel that something about our experience needed to be improved.

352
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:48.970
But here lies one of the central paradoxes of spiritual life because there's

353
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.830
very feeling of dissatisfaction causes us to overlook the Intrinsic Freedom of

354
00:22:53.831 --> 00:22:56.710
consciousness in the present.
As we have seen,

355
00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:00.730
there are good reasons to believe that adopting a practice like meditation can

356
00:23:00.731 --> 00:23:02.710
lead to positive changes in one's life,

357
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:07.390
but the deepest goal of spirituality is freedom from the illusion of the self.

358
00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:12.580
And to seek such freedom as though or a future state to be attained through

359
00:23:12.581 --> 00:23:17.230
effort is to reinforce the chains of one's apparent bondage in each moment.

360
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:20.740
Traditionally,
there have been two solutions to this paradox.

361
00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:25.510
One is to simply ignore it and to adopt various techniques of meditation and the

362
00:23:25.511 --> 00:23:29.290
hope that a breakthrough will occur.
Some people appear to succeed at this,

363
00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:33.640
but many fail.
It is true that good things often happen.
In the meantime,

364
00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:36.220
we can become happier and more concentrated,

365
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.740
but we can also despair of the whole project.

366
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:43.180
The words of the sages may begin to sound like empty promises and we're left

367
00:23:43.181 --> 00:23:47.690
hoping for transcendent experiences that never arrive or prove merely temporary.

368
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.200
The ultimate wisdom of enlightenment,
whatever it is,

369
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.560
cannot be a matter of having fleeting experiences.

370
00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:59.870
The goal of meditation is to uncover a form of wellbeing that is inherent to the

371
00:23:59.871 --> 00:24:00.800
nature of our minds.

372
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.260
It must therefore be available in the context of ordinary sights,
sounds,

373
00:24:06.261 --> 00:24:10.430
sensations,
and even thoughts.
Peak experiences are fine,

374
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.880
but real freedom must be coincident with normal waking life.

375
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.980
And as a sidebar to this,
this now me speaking off book,

376
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:24.610
this is one of the crucial distinctions between meditation and Psychedelics as

377
00:24:24.801 --> 00:24:25.634
tools.

378
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:30.710
It's very easy to draw the lesson from psychedelic experiences,

379
00:24:30.711 --> 00:24:35.711
however useful that freedom somehow lives in radically transforming the contents

380
00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.800
and character of consciousness.

381
00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:44.810
Whereas the goal of meditation is to recognize that there is something about

382
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:46.250
ordinary consciousness,

383
00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:51.520
the very awareness in you that is experiencing the sound of my voice in this

384
00:24:52.221 --> 00:24:55.790
moment.
There's already radically free of self.

385
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.180
It's already open.
It's already undefined.

386
00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:04.370
Consciousness never is truly confined by its contents.

387
00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.960
And so while psychedelics have been very useful for me and many others,

388
00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:14.620
the center of the Bullseye for me is something that is actually coincident with

389
00:25:14.931 --> 00:25:18.890
normal waking consciousness where I'm at precisely the kind of consciousness

390
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.520
that it could allow you to safely drive a car,
right?

391
00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:27.530
Which if you've ever taken acid or mushrooms is not where one tends to be

392
00:25:27.531 --> 00:25:30.710
pitched on those drugs.
So back to the text.

393
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:35.840
The other traditional response to the paradox of spiritual seeking is to fully

394
00:25:35.841 --> 00:25:40.700
acknowledge it and concede that all efforts are doomed because the urge to

395
00:25:40.701 --> 00:25:45.440
attain self transcendence or any other mystical experience is a symptom of the

396
00:25:45.441 --> 00:25:49.910
very disease we want to cure.
There is nothing to do but give up the search.

397
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:54.560
These paths may appear antithetical and they are often presented as such.

398
00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.370
The path of gradual ascent is typical of Teravata,

399
00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:02.330
Buddhism and most other approaches to meditation in the Indian tradition and

400
00:26:02.331 --> 00:26:06.800
gradualism is the natural starting point for any search,
spiritual or otherwise.

401
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:11.810
Such goal oriented modes of practice have the virtue of being easily taught

402
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.620
because a person can begin them without having had any fundamental insight into

403
00:26:15.621 --> 00:26:18.740
the nature of consciousness or the illusory ness of the self.

404
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.070
He need only adopt new patterns of attention,

405
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:26.960
thought and behavior and the path will unfold before him.
By contrast,

406
00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:32.120
the path of sudden realization can appear impossibly steep is often described as

407
00:26:32.121 --> 00:26:36.770
quote non-dualistic because it refuses to validate the point of view from which

408
00:26:36.771 --> 00:26:39.770
one would meditate or practice any other spiritual discipline.

409
00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:45.780
Consciousness is already free of that remotely resembles a self and there is

410
00:26:45.991 --> 00:26:50.250
nothing you can do as an illusionary ego to realize this.

411
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:54.930
Such a perspective can be found in the Indian tradition of Advaita Vedanta and

412
00:26:54.931 --> 00:26:56.250
in a few schools of Buddhism.

413
00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:00.150
Those who begin to practice in the spirit of gradualism often assume that the

414
00:27:00.151 --> 00:27:04.800
goal of self transcendence is far away and they may spend years overlooking the

415
00:27:04.801 --> 00:27:06.600
very freedom they yearn to realize.

416
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:10.890
The liability of this approach became clear to me when I studied under the

417
00:27:10.891 --> 00:27:13.770
Burmese meditation master side out who Pandita.

418
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:18.300
I sat through several retreats with open data each a month or two in length.

419
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:22.170
These are treats were based on the monastic discipline of Teravata in Buddhism.

420
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.820
We did not eat after noon and we're encouraged to sleep no more than four hours

421
00:27:26.821 --> 00:27:28.380
each night.
Outwardly,

422
00:27:28.381 --> 00:27:31.860
the goal was to engage in 18 hours of formal meditation each day.

423
00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:35.910
Inwardly it was to follow the stages of insight laid out in Buda,

424
00:27:35.911 --> 00:27:37.590
ghosts as fifth century treatise.

425
00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:41.910
The vesuvio Maga and elaborated in the writings of [inaudible] has own legendary

426
00:27:41.911 --> 00:27:43.520
teacher Mahasi Sayadaw.

427
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:49.250
The logic of this practice is explicitly goal oriented according to this view,

428
00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:54.300
one practices mindfulness not because the intrinsic freedom of consciousness can

429
00:27:54.301 --> 00:27:55.950
be fully realized in the present,

430
00:27:56.550 --> 00:28:00.930
but because being mindful is a means for attaining and experience often

431
00:28:00.931 --> 00:28:05.931
described as quote cessation which is thought to decisively uproot the illusion

432
00:28:06.301 --> 00:28:10.170
of the self along with other mental afflictions depending on one stage of

433
00:28:10.171 --> 00:28:11.004
practice,

434
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:15.210
cessation is believed to be a direct insight into an unconditioned reality.

435
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:16.681
In Pauley,

436
00:28:16.681 --> 00:28:21.570
this is called Nibhaana in Sanskrit and nirvana that lies behind all manifest

437
00:28:21.571 --> 00:28:22.404
phenomena.

438
00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:27.150
This conception of the path to enlightenment is open to several criticisms.

439
00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:31.440
The first is that it is misleading with respect to what can be realized in the

440
00:28:31.441 --> 00:28:34.710
present moment in a state of ordinary awareness.
Thus,

441
00:28:34.711 --> 00:28:38.850
it encourages confusion at the outset regarding the nature of the problem one is

442
00:28:38.851 --> 00:28:41.850
trying to solve.
It is true,
however,

443
00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:46.170
that striving toward the distant goal of enlightenment as well as the nearer a

444
00:28:46.171 --> 00:28:50.220
goal of cessation can lead one to practice with an intensity that might

445
00:28:50.221 --> 00:28:51.930
otherwise be difficult to achieve.

446
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.950
I never made more effort than I did when practicing under group on data,

447
00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:00.780
but most of this effort arose from the very illusion of bondage to the self that

448
00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:01.950
I was seeking to overcome.

449
00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:07.260
The model of this practice is that one must climb the mountain so that freedom

450
00:29:07.261 --> 00:29:12.261
can be found at the top but the self is already an illusion and that truth can

451
00:29:13.621 --> 00:29:18.120
be glimpsed directly at the mountains base or anywhere else along the path.

452
00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:23.190
One can then return to this insight again and again as one sole method of

453
00:29:23.191 --> 00:29:27.390
meditation thereby arrive in at the goal in each moment of actual practice.

454
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:31.980
This isn't merely a matter of choosing to think differently about the

455
00:29:31.981 --> 00:29:33.300
significance of mindfulness.

456
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:38.610
It is a difference in what one is able to be mindful of dualistic mindfulness,

457
00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:43.180
paying attention to the breath for instance generally proceeds on the basis of

458
00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:45.910
an illusion.
One feels that one is a subject,

459
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:51.070
a locus of consciousness inside the head that can strategically pay attention to

460
00:29:51.071 --> 00:29:54.730
the breath or to some other object of awareness because of all the good that it

461
00:29:54.731 --> 00:29:55.564
will do.

462
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:59.860
This is gradualism inaction and yet from a non dualistic point of view,

463
00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:05.110
one could just as well be mindful of selflessness directly to do this.
However,

464
00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:09.910
one must recognize that this is how consciousness is and such an insight can be

465
00:30:09.911 --> 00:30:12.010
difficult to achieve.
However,

466
00:30:12.011 --> 00:30:15.130
it does not require the meditative attainment of cessation.

467
00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:19.510
Another problem with the goal of cessation is it most traditions of Buddhism do

468
00:30:19.511 --> 00:30:23.590
not share it,
and yet they produce long lineages of contemplative masters,

469
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:27.400
many of whom have spent decades doing nothing but meditating on the nature of

470
00:30:27.401 --> 00:30:29.770
consciousness.
If freedom is possible,

471
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:34.540
there must be some mode of ordinary consciousness in which it can be expressed.

472
00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:38.620
Why not realize this frame of mind directly?
Nevertheless,

473
00:30:38.621 --> 00:30:43.540
I spent several years deeply preoccupied with reaching the goal of cessation and

474
00:30:43.541 --> 00:30:46.030
at least one year of that time was spent on silent retreat.

475
00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.150
Although I had many interesting experiences,

476
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:52.600
none seem to fit the specific requirements of this path.

477
00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:56.710
There were periods during which all thoughts subsided and any sense of having a

478
00:30:56.711 --> 00:30:57.760
body disappeared.

479
00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:02.590
What remained was a blissful expanse of conscious piece that had no reference

480
00:31:02.591 --> 00:31:04.750
point in any of the usual sensory channels.

481
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.770
Many scientists and philosophers believe that consciousness is always tied to

482
00:31:08.771 --> 00:31:12.430
one of the five senses,
that the idea of pure consciousness,

483
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.010
apart from seeing,
hearing,
smelling,
tasting,

484
00:31:15.011 --> 00:31:18.820
and touching is a category error and a spiritual fantasy.

485
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.220
I am confident that they are mistaken,

486
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.410
but cessation never arrived given my gradualist views at that point.

487
00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:31.210
This became very frustrated.
Most of my time on retreat was extremely pleasant,

488
00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.840
but it seemed to me that I had been merely given the tools with which to

489
00:31:34.841 --> 00:31:39.060
contemplate the evidence of my non enlightenment.
My practice has become a vigil,

490
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:43.450
a method of waiting,
however patiently for a future reward.

491
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:49.470
The pendulum swung when I met an Indian teacher named Hwl Pooja called Puente GG

492
00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:55.120
or papa g by his students who Intergy was a disciple of Ramana Maharshi,

493
00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:00.600
arguably the most widely revered Indian sage of the 20th century Ramona's own

494
00:32:00.791 --> 00:32:04.570
awakening and had been quite unusual because he'd had no apparent spiritual

495
00:32:04.571 --> 00:32:06.310
interest or contact with a teacher.

496
00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:11.290
As a boy of 16 living in a middle class family of south Indian Brahmins,

497
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:16.060
he spontaneously became a spiritual add depth while sitting alone in his uncle

498
00:32:16.061 --> 00:32:19.780
study,
Ramana suddenly became paralyzed by fear of death.

499
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:23.650
He laid down on the floor,
convinced that he would soon die,

500
00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.110
but rather than remaining terrified,

501
00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.470
he decided to locate the self that was about to disappear.

502
00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:33.400
He focused on the feeling of I a process.

503
00:32:33.401 --> 00:32:37.660
He later called self inquiry and found it to be absent from the field of

504
00:32:37.661 --> 00:32:41.120
consciousness.
Ramana the person didn't die that day,

505
00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:45.170
but he claimed that the feeling of being a separate self never darkened his

506
00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:49.790
consciousness again after fruitlessly attempting to behave like the ordinary boy

507
00:32:49.791 --> 00:32:54.791
he had once been Ramana left home and traveled to tear of anomaly and ancient

508
00:32:55.221 --> 00:32:58.730
pilgrimage site for followers of Shiva.
He spent the rest of his life.

509
00:32:58.731 --> 00:33:02.960
They're in proximity to the mountain Arunachala with which he claimed to have a

510
00:33:02.961 --> 00:33:06.410
mystical connection.
In the early years after his awakening,

511
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.340
Ramana seem to lose his ability to speak and he was said to grow,

512
00:33:10.341 --> 00:33:14.360
so absorbed in his experience of transfigured consciousness that he remained

513
00:33:14.361 --> 00:33:17.510
motionless for days at a time.
His body grew weak,

514
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:21.980
develop sores and had to be tended by the few locals who had taken an interest

515
00:33:21.981 --> 00:33:22.814
in him.

516
00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:28.270
After a decade of silence around 1906 Ramana began to conduct dialogues about

517
00:33:28.761 --> 00:33:31.670
the nature of consciousness until the end of his life,

518
00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:33.950
a steady stream of students came to study with him.

519
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:36.890
These are the sorts of things he was apt to say.

520
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:42.950
These are quotes from Ramana Maharshi.
The mind is a bundle of thoughts.

521
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.990
The thoughts arise because there's the thinker.
The thinker is the ego.

522
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:52.100
The Ego if saw it will automatically vanish.

523
00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:54.043
Here's another quote.

524
00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.920
Reality is simply the loss of the ego destroy the ego by seeking this identity,

525
00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:02.840
because ego is no entity,

526
00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:06.890
it will automatically vanish and reality will shine forth by itself.

527
00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.590
This is the direct method,

528
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:13.430
whereas all other methods are done only retaining the ego.

529
00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.350
No sadness.

530
00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:19.550
Spiritual practices are necessary for engaging in this quest.

531
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:24.560
And finally,
here's one more quote.
There is no mystery greater than this.

532
00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:28.580
That being reality,
we seek to gain reality.

533
00:34:29.390 --> 00:34:33.920
We think that there's something hiding our reality and then it must be destroyed

534
00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:37.700
before the reality is gained.
It is ridiculous.

535
00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:43.280
A day will dawn when you will laugh at your past efforts that which will be on

536
00:34:43.281 --> 00:34:48.281
the day you laugh is also here and now back to my text.

537
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:53.450
Any attempt to make sense of such teachings in third person scientific terms

538
00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:58.010
quickly produces monstrosities from the point of view of psychological science.

539
00:34:58.011 --> 00:34:58.844
For instance,

540
00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:04.030
the mind is not just a quote bundle of thoughts and in what sense can reality be

541
00:35:04.431 --> 00:35:06.680
quote simply the loss of the ego.

542
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:10.250
Does this reality include quasars and Hanta virus?

543
00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:14.600
But these are the kinds of quibbles that will cause one to Miss Ramana's point.

544
00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.960
While the philosophy of Advita and that's the US,

545
00:35:17.961 --> 00:35:20.300
the word for non-dualism in Sanskrit.

546
00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:25.430
While the philosophy of Advita and Ramana's own words may tend to support a

547
00:35:25.431 --> 00:35:27.440
metaphysical reading of teachings of this kind.

548
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:31.760
Their validity is not metaphysical,
rather it is experiential.

549
00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:37.420
The whole of Advanta reduces to a series of very simple and testable assertions.

550
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.700
Consciousness is the prior condition of every experience.

551
00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:46.920
The self or ego is an illusory appearance within it.

552
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:52.820
Look closely for what you are calling I and the feeling of being a separate self

553
00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:54.413
will disappear.

554
00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:00.560
What remains as a matter of experience is a field of consciousness,

555
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:03.510
free,
undivided,

556
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:07.620
and intrinsically uncontaminated by as ever changing contents.

557
00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:12.390
These are the simple truths that Puente Jiji taught.
In fact,

558
00:36:12.391 --> 00:36:15.870
he was even more uncompromising than his guru in his nonduality,

559
00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:20.400
whereas Ramana would often can see the utility of certain dualistic practices.

560
00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:24.150
Puente judge,
he never gave an inch.
The effect was intoxicating,

561
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:28.320
especially to those of us who had spent years practicing meditation punted.

562
00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:31.530
She was also given to spontaneous bounce of weeping and laughter,

563
00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:36.150
both apparently from sheer joy.
The man did not hide his light under a Bushel.

564
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:37.650
When I first met him.

565
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.400
He had not yet been discovered by the throngs of Western devotees who would soon

566
00:36:41.401 --> 00:36:45.900
turn his tiny house and luck now into a spiritual circus like his teacher,

567
00:36:45.901 --> 00:36:50.010
Ramana Puente g claim to be perfectly free from the illusion of the self.

568
00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:52.230
And by all appearances he was,

569
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:56.240
and like Ramana and every other Indian guru Puente,

570
00:36:56.250 --> 00:37:00.840
she would occasionally say something deeply unscientific on the whole.
However,

571
00:37:00.841 --> 00:37:05.220
his teaching was remarkably free from Hindu religiosity or unwarranted

572
00:37:05.221 --> 00:37:07.020
assertions about the nature of the cosmos.

573
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:11.940
He appeared to simply speak from experience about the nature of experience

574
00:37:11.941 --> 00:37:15.210
itself.
Puente,
druggies influence on me was profound,

575
00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:19.650
especially because it came as a corrective to all the strenuous and unsatisfying

576
00:37:19.651 --> 00:37:22.050
efforts I'd been making in meditation up until that point.

577
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.130
But the dangers inherent to his approach soon became obvious.

578
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:30.900
The all or nothing quality of Puente or gs teaching obliged him to acknowledge

579
00:37:30.901 --> 00:37:34.830
the full enlightenment of any person who was grandiose or manic enough to claim

580
00:37:34.831 --> 00:37:35.664
it.

581
00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.840
Thus I repeatedly witnessed fellow students declare their complete and undying

582
00:37:39.841 --> 00:37:40.674
freedom,

583
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:45.090
all the while appearing quite ordinary or worse in certain cases.

584
00:37:45.091 --> 00:37:48.540
These people had clearly had some sort of breakthrough,
but poons,
Geez,

585
00:37:48.541 --> 00:37:52.680
insistence upon the finality of every legitimate insight led many of them to

586
00:37:52.681 --> 00:37:55.080
delude themselves about their spiritual attainments.

587
00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:59.130
Some left India and became gurus.
From what I could tell,

588
00:37:59.131 --> 00:38:02.250
punchy g gave everyone his blessing to spread his teachings in this way.

589
00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:04.200
He wants suggested that I do it,

590
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:07.920
and yet it was clear to me that I was not qualified to be anyone's guru.

591
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.000
Nearly 20 years have passed and I'm still not,
of course,

592
00:38:12.001 --> 00:38:14.250
from Puente Judge's point of view,
this is an illusion,

593
00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:18.570
and yet there simply is a difference between a person like myself who is

594
00:38:18.571 --> 00:38:22.710
generally distracted by thought and one who isn't and cannot be.

595
00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:26.160
I don't know where to place Puente or g on this continuum of wisdom,

596
00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.460
but he appeared to be a lot farther along than his students.

597
00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:33.150
Whether Punto she was capable of seeing the difference between himself and other

598
00:38:33.151 --> 00:38:34.560
people.
I do not know,

599
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:39.550
but his insistence that no difference existed began to seem either dogmatic or

600
00:38:39.551 --> 00:38:41.800
delusional.
On one occasion,

601
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:45.940
events conspired to perfectly aluminate the flaw in Puente or gs teaching.

602
00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:49.810
A small group of experienced practitioners among us,

603
00:38:49.811 --> 00:38:52.920
several teachers of meditation had organized a trip to India,

604
00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:56.980
Nepal to spend 10 days with Puente Gigi in lock now followed by 10 days in

605
00:38:56.981 --> 00:39:01.840
Katmandu to receive teachings on the Tibetan Buddhist practice of Xojane as it

606
00:39:01.841 --> 00:39:05.830
happened during our time and luck now,
a woman from Switzerland became quote,

607
00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.760
enlightened in Puente druggies presence for the better part of a week.

608
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.540
She was celebrated as something akin to the next Buddha who hindered you

609
00:39:13.541 --> 00:39:18.070
repeatedly put her forward as evidence of how fully the truth could be realized

610
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:20.590
without making any effort at all in meditation.

611
00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:24.610
And we had the pleasure of seeing this woman sit beside Puente and g on a raised

612
00:39:24.611 --> 00:39:29.470
platform expounding upon how blissful at now was in her corner of the universe.

613
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:34.760
She was in fact radiantly happy and it was by no means clear that Puente Gigi

614
00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.550
had made a mistake and recognizing her.

615
00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:41.410
She would say things like there is nothing but consciousness and there is no

616
00:39:41.411 --> 00:39:46.210
difference between it and reality itself coming from such a nice guile,

617
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:47.063
this person,

618
00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:51.250
there was little reason to doubt the profundity of her experience when it came

619
00:39:51.251 --> 00:39:53.350
time for our group to leave India for Nepal.

620
00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:57.340
This woman asked if she could join us because she was such good company.

621
00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.520
We encouraged her to come along a few of us.

622
00:40:00.521 --> 00:40:04.000
We're also curious to see how her realization would appear in another context

623
00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:08.800
and so it came to pass that a woman who is enlightenment had just been confirmed

624
00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:12.970
by one of the greatest living exponent of Advita was in the room when we

625
00:40:12.971 --> 00:40:15.460
received our first teachings from Tuk,
Oregon [inaudible] Jay,

626
00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:19.780
who was generally thought to be one of the greatest living zone 10 masters of

627
00:40:19.781 --> 00:40:21.010
all the Buddhist teachings,

628
00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:24.820
those of Zohak Gen most closely resemble the teachings of Advita.

629
00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:29.080
The two traditions seek to provoke the same insight into the non duality of

630
00:40:29.081 --> 00:40:29.914
consciousness,

631
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:34.640
but generally speaking only zog Jen makes it absolutely clear that one was

632
00:40:34.641 --> 00:40:39.010
practice this insight to the point of stability and that one can do so without

633
00:40:39.011 --> 00:40:42.460
succumbing to the dualistic striving that haunts most other paths.

634
00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.400
At a certain point.
In our discussions with Tuco Oregon,

635
00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:50.020
our Swiss prodigy declared her boundless freedom in terms similar to those had

636
00:40:50.021 --> 00:40:52.600
used to such great effect with punch g.

637
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:56.650
After a few highly amusing exchanges during which we watched took,

638
00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:59.560
Oregon's struggled to understand what our translator was telling him.

639
00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:03.460
He gave a short laugh and look the woman over with renewed interest.

640
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:07.330
How long has it been since you were last lost in thought he asked.

641
00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:10.720
I haven't had any thoughts for over a week.
The woman replied,

642
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:15.820
took Oregon smiled a week.
Yes,
no thoughts.

643
00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.810
No.
My mind is completely still.
It's just pure consciousness.

644
00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:24.580
That's very interesting.
Okay,
so this is what's going to happen now.

645
00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:29.020
We're all going to wait for you to have your next thought.
There's no hurry.

646
00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:32.650
We're all very patient people.
We're just going to sit here and wait,

647
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:35.720
so please tell us.
When you notice a thought arise in your mind,

648
00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:41.360
it is difficult to convey what a brilliant and subtle intervention this was.

649
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:45.440
It may have been the most inspired moment of teaching I have ever witnessed.

650
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:49.610
After a few moments,
a look of doubt appeared on our friend's face.

651
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:55.850
Okay,
wait a minute.
Oh,
that could have been a thought there.

652
00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:59.030
Okay.
Over the next 30 seconds,

653
00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.970
we watched this woman's enlightenment completely unravel.

654
00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:06.710
It became clear that she had been merely thinking about how expansive her

655
00:42:06.711 --> 00:42:10.640
experience of consciousness had become,
how it was perfectly free of thought,

656
00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:11.630
immaculate,

657
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:16.630
just like space without noticing that she was thinking incessantly.

658
00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:20.810
She had been telling herself the story of her enlightenment and she had been

659
00:42:20.811 --> 00:42:24.740
getting away with it because she happened to be an extraordinarily happy person

660
00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:27.050
for whom everything was going well.
For the time being.

661
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:31.370
This was the danger of nondual teachings of the sort that Poon Gigi was handing

662
00:42:31.371 --> 00:42:32.270
out to all comers.

663
00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:36.380
It was easy to delude oneself into thinking that one had achieved a permanent

664
00:42:36.381 --> 00:42:40.250
break through especially because he insisted that all breakthroughs must be

665
00:42:40.251 --> 00:42:43.280
permanent.
What the Xojane teachings made clear,
however,

666
00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:48.640
is that thinking about what is beyond thought is still thinking and a glimpse of

667
00:42:48.831 --> 00:42:53.270
selflessness is generally only the beginning of a process that must reach

668
00:42:53.271 --> 00:42:54.104
fruition.

669
00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:59.330
Being able to stand perfectly free of the feeling of self is the start of one

670
00:42:59.331 --> 00:43:01.290
spiritual journey,
not attend.

671
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.570
I think I'll read one more section here cause this,

672
00:43:04.571 --> 00:43:08.750
he'll give you more context for how I think about meditation.

673
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:14.770
So next section here at titled Chen taking the goal is the path took Oregon

674
00:43:15.381 --> 00:43:18.770
Rimpoche.
Jay lived in a hermitage on the southern slope of Shiva Pori mountain

675
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:20.510
overlooking Katmandu Valley.

676
00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:25.160
He spent more than 20 years of his life on formal retreat and was deservedly

677
00:43:25.161 --> 00:43:27.470
famous for the clarity with which he gave the quote,

678
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:29.330
pointing out instruction of Xojane,

679
00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:33.970
a formal initiation in which a teacher is seeks to impart the experience of self

680
00:43:33.971 --> 00:43:36.170
transcendence directly to a student.

681
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:39.080
I received this teaching from several soak and masters,

682
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:43.490
but I never met anyone who spoke about the nature of consciousness as precisely

683
00:43:43.491 --> 00:43:46.640
as to Corrigan in the last five years of his life.

684
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.190
I made several trips to Nepal to study with him.

685
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:53.990
The practice of Zog Gen requires that one be able to experience the intrinsic

686
00:43:53.991 --> 00:43:56.120
selflessness of awareness in every moment.

687
00:43:56.570 --> 00:44:00.120
That is when one is not otherwise distracted by thought,
which is to say the,

688
00:44:00.121 --> 00:44:01.370
for a Xojane meditator,

689
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:06.470
mindfulness must be synonymous with dispelling the illusion of the self rather

690
00:44:06.471 --> 00:44:10.130
than teach a technique of meditation such as paying close attention to one's

691
00:44:10.131 --> 00:44:14.570
breathing as ocean master must precipitate an insight on the basis of which a

692
00:44:14.571 --> 00:44:17.210
student can thereafter practice a form of awareness.

693
00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:21.890
The dependent term is Rick Ba that is unencumbered by subject object dualism.

694
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:24.380
Thus it is often said in Soak Chen,

695
00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:29.420
that one quote takes the goal as the path because the freedom from self that one

696
00:44:29.421 --> 00:44:34.421
might otherwise seek is the very thing that one practices the goal of Xojane if

697
00:44:35.701 --> 00:44:39.570
one can call it.
Such is to grow increasingly familiar with this way of being.

698
00:44:39.571 --> 00:44:42.120
In the world.
In my experience,

699
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:44.490
some soaked and masters are better teachers than others.

700
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.120
I've been in the presence of several of the most revered Tibetan lamas of our

701
00:44:48.121 --> 00:44:50.790
time while they were extensively teaching Xojane,

702
00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:55.080
and most of them simply describe this view of consciousness without giving clear

703
00:44:55.081 --> 00:44:56.430
instructions on how to glimpse it.

704
00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:01.410
The genius of Choke Oregon was that he could point out the nature of mind with

705
00:45:01.411 --> 00:45:03.050
the precision and matter of factness,

706
00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:06.690
of teaching a person how to thread a needle and could get an ordinary meditator

707
00:45:06.691 --> 00:45:10.770
like me to recognize that consciousness is intrinsically free of self.

708
00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:14.760
There might be some initial struggle and uncertainty depending on the student,

709
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:17.610
but once the truth of nonduality had been glimpsed,

710
00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:21.660
it became obvious that it was always available and there was never any doubt

711
00:45:21.661 --> 00:45:24.400
about how to see it.
Again.
I came to Tukul,

712
00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:29.040
Oregon yearning for the experience of self transcendence and in a few minutes he

713
00:45:29.041 --> 00:45:32.970
showed me that I had no self to transcend.
In my view,

714
00:45:32.971 --> 00:45:36.870
there's nothing supernatural or even mysterious about this transmission of

715
00:45:36.871 --> 00:45:41.580
wisdom from master to disciple took Oregon's effect on me came purely from the

716
00:45:41.581 --> 00:45:44.910
clarity of his teaching as it is with any challenging endeavor.

717
00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:49.770
The difference between being utterly misled by false information being nudged in

718
00:45:49.771 --> 00:45:54.771
the general direction and being precisely guided by an expert is difficult to

719
00:45:54.841 --> 00:45:59.700
overstate the direct perception of the optic blindspot provides a useful

720
00:45:59.701 --> 00:46:00.534
analogy.

721
00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.340
Imagine that perceiving the blind spot will completely transform a person's
life.

722
00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:10.320
Next,
imagine that whole religions such as Judaism,
Christianity,

723
00:46:10.321 --> 00:46:14.220
and Islam are predicated on the denial of the blind spots existence.

724
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:18.870
Let us say that their central doctrines assert the perfect uniformity of the

725
00:46:18.871 --> 00:46:22.410
visual field.
Perhaps other traditions acknowledged the blind spot,

726
00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:26.730
but purely and poetical terms without giving any clear indication of how to

727
00:46:26.731 --> 00:46:27.564
recognize it.

728
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:31.630
A fuel in you just may actually teach techniques whereby one can see the blind

729
00:46:31.631 --> 00:46:32.580
spot for oneself,

730
00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:37.440
but only gradually after months and years of effort and even then one glimpses

731
00:46:37.441 --> 00:46:41.850
of it will seem more a matter of luck than anything else in a more esoteric

732
00:46:41.851 --> 00:46:43.500
traditions.
Still a quote.

733
00:46:43.501 --> 00:46:46.920
Blindspot master gives the quote pointing out instruction,

734
00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:48.420
but without much precision.

735
00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:52.650
Perhaps he tells you to close one eye for reasons that are never made explicit

736
00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:56.220
and then says that the spot you seek is right on the surface of your vision.

737
00:46:57.030 --> 00:47:00.060
No doubt some people succeed in discovering the blind spot under these

738
00:47:00.061 --> 00:47:03.450
conditions,
but the teacher is certainly could be clearer than this.

739
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:07.680
How much clearer if two local Oregon had been pointing out the blind spot,

740
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.070
he would have produced a figure like the one below and given these instructions.

741
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:15.630
And then I have the classic image you would use to glimpse your own blind spot

742
00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:20.460
of a fixation cross on one side and a large dot on the other.

743
00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:22.950
And then I give the instructions here.

744
00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:27.690
I'll just read them through it and remind you about how clear this could be.
One,

745
00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:33.050
hold this figure in front of you at arms length to close your left eye and stare

746
00:47:33.491 --> 00:47:38.491
at the cross with your right three gradually move the page closer to your face

747
00:47:38.561 --> 00:47:43.561
while keeping your gaze fixed on the cross for notice when the dot on the right

748
00:47:44.021 --> 00:47:46.120
disappears.
Five.

749
00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:50.500
Once you find your blind spot continue to experiment with this figure by moving

750
00:47:50.501 --> 00:47:54.370
the page back and forth until any possibility of doubt about the existence of

751
00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:55.990
the blind spot has disappeared,

752
00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:01.000
is considered bad form and most spiritual circles,
especially among Buddhists,

753
00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:04.450
to make claims about one's own realization.
However,

754
00:48:04.451 --> 00:48:08.170
I think this taboo comes at a high price because it allows people to remain

755
00:48:08.171 --> 00:48:09.820
confused about how to practice.

756
00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:14.910
So I will describe my experience plainly before meeting to Corrigan,

757
00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:18.610
I had spent at least a year practicing of Apos,
non silent retreats.

758
00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.240
The experience of self transcendence was not entirely unknown to me.

759
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:26.290
I could remember moments when the distance between the observer and the observed

760
00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:27.520
had seemed to vanish,

761
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:31.780
but I viewed these experiences as being dependent on conditions of extreme

762
00:48:31.781 --> 00:48:34.360
mental concentration.
Consequently,

763
00:48:34.361 --> 00:48:38.200
I had thought that they were unavailable in more ordinary moments outside

764
00:48:38.201 --> 00:48:41.260
intensive retreat.
But after a few minutes took,

765
00:48:41.261 --> 00:48:44.890
Oregon's simply handed me the ability to cut through the illusion of the self

766
00:48:44.891 --> 00:48:47.800
directly,
even in ordinary states of consciousness.

767
00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:52.150
This instruction was without question the most important thing I've ever been

768
00:48:52.151 --> 00:48:54.100
explicitly taught by another human being.

769
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.560
It has given me a way to escape the usual tides of psychological suffering,
fear,

770
00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:04.210
anger,
shame in an instant that my level of practice,

771
00:49:04.211 --> 00:49:06.130
this freedom lasts only a few moments,

772
00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:10.960
but these moments can be repeated and they can grow in duration,
punctuating,

773
00:49:10.961 --> 00:49:14.770
ordinary experience in this way,
it makes all the difference.
In fact,

774
00:49:14.771 --> 00:49:18.700
when I pay attention,
it is impossible for me to feel like a self at all.

775
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:23.710
The implied center of cognition and emotion simply falls away and it is obvious

776
00:49:23.711 --> 00:49:28.600
that consciousness has never truly confined by what it knows that which is aware

777
00:49:28.601 --> 00:49:30.550
of sadness is not sad,

778
00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:33.970
that which is aware of fear is not fearful.

779
00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:36.790
The moment I am lost in thought,
however,

780
00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:41.590
I'm as confused as anyone else given this change in my perception of the world.

781
00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.980
I understand the attractions of traditional spirituality.

782
00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:50.140
I also recognize the needless confusion and harm that inevitably arise from the

783
00:49:50.141 --> 00:49:51.790
doctrines of faith based religion.

784
00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:56.140
I did not have to believe anything irrational about the universe or about my

785
00:49:56.141 --> 00:49:58.870
place within it to learn the practice of Xojane.

786
00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:03.160
I didn't have to accept Tibetan Buddhist beliefs about Karma and rebirth or

787
00:50:03.161 --> 00:50:06.880
imagine that two cool Oregon or the other meditation masters I met possessed

788
00:50:06.881 --> 00:50:10.990
magic powers and whatever the traditional liabilities of a guru devotee

789
00:50:10.991 --> 00:50:11.824
relationship.

790
00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:16.090
I know from direct experience that is possible to meet a teacher who can deliver

791
00:50:16.091 --> 00:50:20.140
the goods.
Okay,
so that's the end of my reading.

792
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:23.110
So that's how I come to the practice of meditation.

793
00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:29.370
And after I spent the decades of my twenties largely focused on meditation as

794
00:50:30.901 --> 00:50:34.410
well as reading the relevant eastern and Western philosophy,

795
00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:39.490
I decided to go back to school because I was writing nonfiction about the nature

796
00:50:39.491 --> 00:50:40.324
of the mind.

797
00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:44.860
Happily I had dropped out of Stanford University where you can never really drop

798
00:50:44.861 --> 00:50:48.120
out.
I think Stanford is one of the few schools in the United States that has a

799
00:50:48.121 --> 00:50:49.890
policy of never making you reapply.

800
00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:55.730
So it just showed up like some rip Van Winkle character after 11 years away and

801
00:50:56.511 --> 00:51:01.350
finished my degree in philosophy and then went on to do a phd in neuroscience at

802
00:51:01.351 --> 00:51:02.184
Ucla.

803
00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:08.090
So I bring a philosophical and scientific and secular perspective meditation.

804
00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:13.420
Ultimately I think we should all be practicing non dual mindfulness without

805
00:51:13.421 --> 00:51:17.230
believing any bullshit that is a human future worth wanting.

806
00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:23.420
And that's what I'm attempting to equip people to do in the waking up course in

807
00:51:24.391 --> 00:51:24.860
producing the,

808
00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:29.060
and of course I'm attempting to do something that I'm especially qualified to
do,

809
00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:32.130
man.
I don't consider myself the best at any one thing,

810
00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:37.430
but you don't have to be the best at anything to be almost uniquely qualified

811
00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:41.440
for something.
The weekend of course is in part a meditation course.

812
00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:46.460
So obviously there are a guided meditation compre continually adding to those as

813
00:51:46.461 --> 00:51:50.180
time goes on.
I would say that even if you're an experienced meditator,

814
00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:53.160
using guided meditations can be extremely helpful.

815
00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.060
And this is one of the things that's unique about audio.

816
00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:57.830
You can't do this with a book.

817
00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:02.050
There's no alternative to having an actual voice remind you that you're supposed

818
00:52:02.051 --> 00:52:02.884
to be paying attention,

819
00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:06.410
and I find guided meditation is extremely helpful and I've been meditating for

820
00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:10.140
now nearly 30 years.
In addition to the guided meditations,

821
00:52:10.141 --> 00:52:15.000
there's also an expanding curriculum of short talks on a variety of topics I

822
00:52:15.001 --> 00:52:16.170
call these talks lessons,

823
00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.770
some explained concepts that are directly relevant to meditation.

824
00:52:20.350 --> 00:52:24.610
Others are more like philosophical interventions or have you reflect on a

825
00:52:24.611 --> 00:52:26.500
specific topic for a few minutes.

826
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:30.750
Sometimes starting with a scientific finding or quotation that inspires a

827
00:52:30.751 --> 00:52:34.220
particular line of thought.
So here I'd like to give you a taste of the course.

828
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:36.920
I'll start with one of the early meditations,

829
00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:40.420
very much designed for someone new to the practice of mindfulness.

830
00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:42.330
So if you're not on board already,

831
00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:45.680
this is the part of the podcast that really will bore you to tears if you're

832
00:52:45.681 --> 00:52:47.450
working out of the gym or commuting.

833
00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.690
But if you're in a spot where you can meditate,

834
00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:52.200
here's the first 10 minute meditation.

835
00:52:58.600 --> 00:52:59.433
<v 3>Okay?</v>

836
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:01.261
<v 2>Once again,</v>

837
00:53:01.261 --> 00:53:05.680
take a seat either in a chair or cross legged on a cushion.

838
00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:07.240
<v 0>Okay.</v>

839
00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:08.980
<v 2>It's good to sit as comfortably as you can</v>

840
00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:14.600
and it's usually best to be sitting as straight as you can.

841
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:18.270
Now close your eyes

842
00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:22.910
and become aware of the sensations of sitting.

843
00:53:23.850 --> 00:53:24.410
<v 0>Okay.</v>

844
00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:26.100
<v 4>Feel your arms at your sides</v>

845
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:31.940
and perhaps take a few deep breaths.

846
00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:50.380
Just allow gravity to settle you into your seat

847
00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:57.870
now as you did yesterday,

848
00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:01.710
they'd come aware of the sensations of breathing.

849
00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:02.793
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

850
00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:06.390
<v 4>notice where you feel the breath most clearly,</v>

851
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:12.910
either at the tip of the nose or the rising and falling of your abdomen or

852
00:54:12.911 --> 00:54:13.744
chest.

853
00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:20.260
It doesn't matter where you pay attention to the breath

854
00:54:22.210 --> 00:54:25.390
and you can change your focus from session to session if you like,

855
00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:33.010
but for the moment,
just pick one spot and focus there.

856
00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:57.390
There's nothing especially significant about the breath,

857
00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:00.910
but it's something you always have with you

858
00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:04.370
and it's as good as any other sense.

859
00:55:04.371 --> 00:55:07.580
Object as a basis for training your powers of attention.

860
00:55:09.770 --> 00:55:13.430
Eventually the practice will incorporate everything that arises in
consciousness.

861
00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:33.780
Just feel the mirror sensations of breathing from the beginning of the

862
00:55:35.291 --> 00:55:36.124
inhalation

863
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:41.780
to the pause between breaths

864
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:48.510
and follow the exhalation to the end.

865
00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:03.190
Trying to cover the breath with your awareness.

866
00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:11.070
And once again,
there's no need to control your breathing.

867
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:15.330
Just let it come however it comes.

868
00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:57.520
What we're doing here is sharpening the only tool you really have your mind.

869
00:57:01.610 --> 00:57:04.820
This is what you take with you in any situation in life.

870
00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:11.380
This is what determines how you respond to emotional stress and physical pain

871
00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:15.980
and every other difficulty you encounter.

872
00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:23.330
This is the basis for every decision you make and every interaction you have

873
00:57:23.331 --> 00:57:24.164
with other people.

874
00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:26.793
<v 0>Okay?</v>

875
00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:28.690
<v 4>And as you begin to observe it,</v>

876
00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:33.700
you'll notice perhaps with growing amazement

877
00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:38.620
that your mind is totally out of control.

878
00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:49.060
And as you try to pay attention to the breath,

879
00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:56.440
you'll begin to notice that the primary obstacle to your paying attention is

880
00:57:56.991 --> 00:58:01.110
thinking
thoughts continually arise.

881
00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:06.320
And you forget that you were even trying to meditate at all.

882
00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:11.190
And this happens over the course of mere seconds.

883
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:21.150
Just try to count the next 10 breaths without getting distracted.

884
00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:31.200
You can silently in your mind count one on the inhalation and one again on the

885
00:58:32.231 --> 00:58:36.730
exhalation and then to see if you can get to 10

886
01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:08.050
unless you have a lot of concentration,

887
01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:13.650
you probably were unable to tell how precarious here awareness of the breath

888
01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.390
actually was,

889
01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:22.560
how your attention was being buffeted on all sides by discursive thought.

890
01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:32.840
Now the goal isn't to stop your thoughts or to suppress any emotion that might

891
01:00:33.551 --> 01:00:34.660
arise along with them.

892
01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:40.680
It is rather to notice these mental events clearly and to experience them fully

893
01:00:41.351 --> 01:00:43.120
or more fully.
In fact,

894
01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:44.800
<v 0>okay,</v>

895
01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:49.060
<v 4>to recognize them as appearances and consciousness the moment they arise,</v>

896
01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:54.800
but that is generally a very difficult thing to do in the beginning.

897
01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:00.680
So for the time being,
the moment you discover that you're thinking,

898
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:05.300
just observe it and come back to the breath.

899
01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:24.640
In this final minute of the meditation,

900
01:01:26.170 --> 01:01:27.190
just start again.

901
01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:46.150
Just feel the next breath as it comes.

902
01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:19.613
Okay.

903
01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:24.840
Well just take a moment to take stock of how you're feeling.

904
01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:26.240
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

905
01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:30.080
<v 4>Whether you're tired or restless or calm.</v>

906
01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:31.210
<v 0>Okay.</v>

907
01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:34.450
<v 4>Whether your experience was pleasant or unpleasant isn't really the point.</v>

908
01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.300
What you're learning here is a new skill.

909
01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:38.310
<v 0>Okay.</v>

910
01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:41.270
<v 4>And unless you're coming to this course already knowing how to meditate,</v>

911
01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:44.930
you can't expect to be able to do it well in the beginning.

912
01:02:45.590 --> 01:02:46.090
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

913
01:02:46.090 --> 01:02:49.090
<v 4>And is the practice develops over the next days and weeks,</v>

914
01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:53.950
you'll see that you do less,
not more than you normally do.

915
01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:59.530
You're not adding an artifice to your experience in the present moment.
Rather,

916
01:02:59.531 --> 01:03:01.510
you're simply becoming less distracted.

917
01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:06.490
The purpose of meditation is to discover what's your mind is like when you're no

918
01:03:06.491 --> 01:03:10.480
longer perpetually identified with the contents of your thoughts.

919
01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:16.490
And to make progress,
you simply need to be willing to begin again.

920
01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:23.903
<v 3>Okay.</v>

921
01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:29.550
<v 4>Okay.
So that's what an early guided meditation sounds like.
Now,</v>

922
01:03:29.551 --> 01:03:32.220
I'll give you a lesson and these are,
again,

923
01:03:32.221 --> 01:03:35.150
these are short talks on many different topics.

924
01:03:36.070 --> 01:03:37.600
Here's one on the topic of death.

925
01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:46.451
Well,

926
01:03:46.451 --> 01:03:51.100
today's topic is a topic we all think about while doing our best not to think

927
01:03:51.101 --> 01:03:54.100
about it.
The topic is death,

928
01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:55.910
<v 0>okay?</v>

929
01:03:55.910 --> 01:04:00.800
<v 4>And how we think about death changes depending on whether we're thinking about</v>

930
01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:04.880
dying ourselves or about losing the people we love.

931
01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:08.180
But whichever side of the coin we take here.

932
01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:09.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

933
01:04:09.450 --> 01:04:14.450
<v 4>Death is really an ever present reality for us and it is.</v>

934
01:04:15.361 --> 01:04:17.700
So whether we're thinking about it or not,

935
01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:23.510
it's always announcing itself in the background on the news,

936
01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.780
in the stories we hear about the lives of others.

937
01:04:28.930 --> 01:04:29.370
<v 0>Okay.</v>

938
01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:31.500
<v 4>In our concerns about our own health.</v>

939
01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:33.140
<v 0>Okay.</v>

940
01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:35.540
<v 4>In the attention we pay when crossing the street.</v>

941
01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:36.980
<v 0>Okay.</v>

942
01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:39.590
<v 4>If you observe yourself closely,</v>

943
01:04:39.591 --> 01:04:44.591
you'll see that you spend a fair amount of energy each day trying not to die.

944
01:04:46.610 --> 01:04:47.230
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

945
01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:52.230
<v 4>And has long been noted by philosophers and contemplative and poets.</v>

946
01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:58.210
Death makes a mockery of almost everything else we spend our lives doing.

947
01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:00.070
<v 0>Okay.</v>

948
01:05:00.070 --> 01:05:03.640
<v 4>Just take a moment to reflect on how you've spent your day so far.</v>

949
01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:06.850
The kinds of things that captured your attention,

950
01:05:07.930 --> 01:05:10.090
the things that you've been genuinely worried about.

951
01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:11.880
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

952
01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:14.190
<v 4>Think of the last argument you had with your spouse.</v>

953
01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:18.220
Think of the last hour you spent on social media.

954
01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:20.980
Over the last few days,

955
01:05:20.981 --> 01:05:25.600
I've been spending an inordinate amount of time trying to find a new font for my

956
01:05:25.601 --> 01:05:30.040
podcast.
This is literally absorbed hours of my time.

957
01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:35.290
So if you had stopped me at any point in the last 48 hours and asked me what I'm

958
01:05:35.291 --> 01:05:37.630
up to,
what really concerns me,

959
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:43.710
what deep problem I'm attempting to solve the solution in which seems most

960
01:05:44.021 --> 01:05:47.140
likely to bring order to the chaos in my corner of the universe.

961
01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:51.640
The honest answer would have been,
I'm looking for a font

962
01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:58.090
now.
I'm not saying that everything we do has to be profound in every moment.

963
01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.100
I mean sometimes you just have to find a font,

964
01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:05.140
but contemplating the brevity of life,

965
01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:08.710
bring some perspective to how we use our attention.

966
01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.860
It's not so much what we pay attention to.

967
01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:16.600
It's the quality of attention is how we feel while doing it.

968
01:06:17.730 --> 01:06:20.170
If you need to spend the next hour looking for a font,

969
01:06:20.171 --> 01:06:24.580
you might as well enjoy it because it's truth is none of us know how much time

970
01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:29.581
we have in this life and taking that fact to heart brings a kind of moral and

971
01:06:31.241 --> 01:06:34.600
emotional clarity and energy to the present,

972
01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:40.500
or at least it can and it can bring a resolve to not suffer over stupid things.

973
01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.710
Can we take something like road rage?

974
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.750
This is probably the quintessential example of misspent energy.

975
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:54.910
You're behind the wheel of your car and somebody does something erratic or

976
01:06:55.330 --> 01:06:59.650
they're probably just driving more slowly than you want and you find yourself

977
01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.410
getting angry.
Now,

978
01:07:01.950 --> 01:07:06.520
I would submit to you that that kind of thing is impossible.

979
01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:10.330
If you're being mindful of the shortness of life,

980
01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:15.910
if you're aware that you are going to die and that the other person is going to

981
01:07:15.911 --> 01:07:20.911
die and that you're both going to lose everyone you love and you don't know when

982
01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:28.060
you've got this moment of life,
this beautiful moment,

983
01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:31.510
this moment where your consciousness is bright,

984
01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:36.540
whereas it's not dimmed by morphine in the hospital on your last day among the

985
01:07:36.851 --> 01:07:41.830
living
and the sun is out or it's raining,

986
01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:47.070
both are beautiful and your spouse is alive and your children are alive and

987
01:07:49.811 --> 01:07:50.644
you're driving

988
01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:56.770
and you're not in some failed state where civilians are being rounded up and

989
01:07:56.771 --> 01:07:58.180
murdered by the thousands.

990
01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:03.780
You're just running an errand and that person in front of you who you will never

991
01:08:04.451 --> 01:08:09.100
meet,
whose hopes and sorrows you know nothing about,

992
01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.950
but which,
if you could know them,

993
01:08:12.550 --> 01:08:15.500
you would recognize or impressively similar to your own,

994
01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:20.630
is just driving slow.
This is your life,

995
01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:26.390
the only one you've got,
and you will never get this moment back again.

996
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:31.910
And you don't know how many more moments you have.

997
01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:35.930
No matter how many times you do something,

998
01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:39.350
there will come a day when you do it for the last time.

999
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:45.740
You've had a thousand chances to tell the people closest to you that you love

1000
01:08:45.741 --> 01:08:50.741
them in a way that they feel it and in a way that you feel it and you've missed

1001
01:08:53.570 --> 01:08:58.490
most of them
and you don't know how many more you're going to get.

1002
01:09:00.290 --> 01:09:05.030
You've got this next interaction with another human being to make the world a

1003
01:09:05.031 --> 01:09:06.560
marginally better place.

1004
01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:12.140
You've got this one opportunity to fall in love with existence,

1005
01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:18.220
so why not relax and enjoy your life really relaxed,

1006
01:09:20.210 --> 01:09:21.770
even in the midst of struggle,

1007
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:25.370
even while doing hard work,

1008
01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:28.100
even under uncertainty.

1009
01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:34.010
You are in a game right now and you can't see the clock,

1010
01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:37.340
so you don't know how much time you have left,

1011
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:42.350
and yet you're free to make the game as interesting as possible.

1012
01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.750
You can even change the rules.

1013
01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:48.500
You can discover new games that no one has thought of yet.

1014
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:54.550
You can make games that used to be impossible suddenly possible and get others

1015
01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:56.660
to play them with you.

1016
01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:03.220
You can literally build a rocket to go to Mars so that you can start a colony

1017
01:10:04.311 --> 01:10:05.144
there.

1018
01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:10.480
I actually know people who will spend some part of today doing that,

1019
01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:13.580
but whatever you do,

1020
01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:18.980
however seemingly ordinary you can feel the preciousness of life,

1021
01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:25.250
that an awareness of death is the doorway into that way of being in the world.

1022
01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:37.240
Okay,
here's a lesson titled the mystery of being

1023
01:10:45.390 --> 01:10:49.620
of all the solar systems in this universe that might sustain complex life.

1024
01:10:50.250 --> 01:10:51.720
We find ourselves in this one.

1025
01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:57.000
He took billions of years of evolution on this earth to produce the people we

1026
01:10:57.001 --> 01:10:57.834
now are.

1027
01:10:58.470 --> 01:11:02.310
Our brains and bodies have evolved through millions of generations reaching back

1028
01:11:02.311 --> 01:11:05.280
to Creekers,
totally unlike us to animals.

1029
01:11:05.281 --> 01:11:10.281
So strange that we wouldn't even want them as pets and finally to single celled

1030
01:11:10.501 --> 01:11:14.970
organisms for ages.
The world got on without us,

1031
01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:20.550
but now we're here and among all the possible people that could exist,

1032
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:25.910
we are among the tiny minority that actually do and have all the periods in

1033
01:11:26.281 --> 01:11:29.520
human history where we might have appeared.
We live in this one,

1034
01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:34.080
arguably the first in which it was possible to understand our circumstance in a

1035
01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:37.410
truly universal sense.
For the first time,

1036
01:11:37.411 --> 01:11:41.100
a person's view of the world need not be dictated by the mere location of his

1037
01:11:41.101 --> 01:11:45.240
birth or the religion of his parents for the first time.

1038
01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:49.050
The barriers of language and geography have totally fallen away.

1039
01:11:49.890 --> 01:11:50.551
At this moment.

1040
01:11:50.551 --> 01:11:55.050
You have instantaneous access to more information than even the greatest scholar

1041
01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:57.060
a world leader did a generation ago.

1042
01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:02.010
And yet on some level we can front the same mystery of our existence that

1043
01:12:02.011 --> 01:12:06.720
Socrates,
where the Buddha faced.
The fact that you are at you,

1044
01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:11.700
the fact that you exist in this moment,
he is a miracle of sorts.

1045
01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:15.600
There's something fundamentally inexplicable about it.

1046
01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:21.800
There's no amount of knowledge that seems adequate to dispel the mystery of our

1047
01:12:21.931 --> 01:12:26.040
appearance here and whatever,
you know,
whatever you believe,

1048
01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:28.350
whatever you have done or hope to do,

1049
01:12:29.130 --> 01:12:32.490
you have this moment of conscious life to contemplate.

1050
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:37.050
You have this minute,
this hour,
this day,

1051
01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:39.330
and it will never come again.

1052
01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:40.850
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1053
01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:44.360
<v 4>So I want to talk for a few minutes about the intrinsic mystery of this</v>

1054
01:12:44.361 --> 01:12:45.194
circumstance.

1055
01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:49.880
It really is the mystery of being in science and philosophy.

1056
01:12:49.881 --> 01:12:53.420
We often claim that we're in the business of getting rid of mysteries and there

1057
01:12:53.421 --> 01:12:55.430
is of course a sense in which that's true.

1058
01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:58.610
If we don't know why people are getting sick,
for instance,

1059
01:12:58.970 --> 01:13:01.010
and we discovered the virus that's causing it,

1060
01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:03.350
well then the mystery has been solved.

1061
01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:08.660
But there's another sense in which mystery never recedes and if you pay

1062
01:13:08.661 --> 01:13:09.111
attention,

1063
01:13:09.111 --> 01:13:13.580
you can see that it's an ever present fact of even the most well understood

1064
01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:14.533
phenomena.

1065
01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:19.400
The philosopher Bertrand Russell described her most rudimentary knowledge of the

1066
01:13:19.401 --> 01:13:22.880
world as knowledge by acquaintance.
For instance,

1067
01:13:22.881 --> 01:13:26.750
the color of a table standing before you,
and here's a quote,

1068
01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:32.030
the particular shade of color that I'm seeing may have many things said about
it.

1069
01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:36.380
I might say that it is brown that is rather dark and so on,

1070
01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:41.450
but such statements do they make me know truths about the color do not make me

1071
01:13:41.451 --> 01:13:46.010
know the color itself any better than I did before so far as concerns,

1072
01:13:46.011 --> 01:13:50.450
the knowledge of the color itself as opposed to knowledge of truth about it.

1073
01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:55.190
I know the color perfectly and completely when I see it and no further knowledge

1074
01:13:55.191 --> 01:13:57.440
of it is even theoretically possible.

1075
01:13:58.610 --> 01:14:02.570
Thus the sense data which make up the appearance of my table are things with

1076
01:14:02.571 --> 01:14:07.130
which I have acquaintance and things immediately known to me just as they are

1077
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.600
and quote.
Now,

1078
01:14:10.601 --> 01:14:15.280
what Russell seems to overlook here is that this basic knowledge to which no

1079
01:14:15.281 --> 01:14:20.281
knowledge can even be theoretically added is a place where we uncover an

1080
01:14:20.711 --> 01:14:25.711
intrinsic limit to understanding when we consider any facet of experience,

1081
01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.060
in this case,
a vision of color.

1082
01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:33.310
If we can then stem the tide of our thoughts long enough to merely observe it as

1083
01:14:33.311 --> 01:14:34.120
it is,

1084
01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:39.100
the fact that we're in total ignorance of what it is can become obvious.

1085
01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:42.340
I mean,
what is the color blue?

1086
01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:47.080
Not as a function of wavelengths of light or neurophysiology,

1087
01:14:47.710 --> 01:14:49.570
but as it has directly perceived.

1088
01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:54.430
We're really left with nothing to say,
but that it's blue,

1089
01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:59.650
which of course does nothing to clarify things.
In fact,
it's not even blue,

1090
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:03.980
which is just a word.
It's a noise we're making.
Well,

1091
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.640
what we see before us is whatever it ineffably is

1092
01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:13.290
focusing on this distance between concepts and experience is a means of sneaking

1093
01:15:13.331 --> 01:15:17.650
up on a truth is generally described in Buddhism as the truth of emptiness.

1094
01:15:18.490 --> 01:15:23.230
The idea that no thing has intrinsic independent existence in the way that it

1095
01:15:23.231 --> 01:15:24.730
seems now.

1096
01:15:24.731 --> 01:15:29.050
There are many ways to come at this insight into emptiness and frankly this line

1097
01:15:29.051 --> 01:15:31.930
of inquiry maybe too steep for some of you at this point,

1098
01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:36.250
so I encourage you to return to it after you have more experience in the

1099
01:15:36.251 --> 01:15:39.700
practice of meditation,
but it is worth reflecting on even in the beginning.

1100
01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:45.040
The moment we suspend the conceptual associations we have with a given object or

1101
01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:47.170
perception or knowledge about it,

1102
01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:52.650
our direct experience of it can grade into this experience of just pure mystery.

1103
01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:58.740
We're left with this wordless intuition of consciousness and its contents about

1104
01:15:59.501 --> 01:16:04.150
which nothing more really can be said.
Right?
Right now,
as you listen to me speak,

1105
01:16:04.930 --> 01:16:07.960
pay careful attention to the process of listening,

1106
01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:12.970
the feeling of sitting in your chair.
Look closely at everything around you.

1107
01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.320
I'd like to suggest that while you know many things about the present moment,

1108
01:16:19.690 --> 01:16:22.900
you do not know what anything in itself is.

1109
01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:27.550
Now look at your hand.
What is it?

1110
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:34.090
We can define this part of your body in language.
You can call it hand.

1111
01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:39.790
You can consider the fact that it's made of bone and muscle and threaded with

1112
01:16:39.791 --> 01:16:41.170
blood vessels and nerves,

1113
01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:46.420
but this is all a description about the object that you're now looking at.

1114
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:52.110
If you simply look at your hand and ask yourself what is it you might realize in

1115
01:16:53.771 --> 01:16:58.771
a moment of rare openmindedness that it is an absolute mystery.

1116
01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:04.450
It is in fact as mysterious and appearance as any you could ever hope to find.

1117
01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:09.280
Now there are scientific arguments that can be a raid against the mysteriousness

1118
01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:12.740
of any object.
We can point to the fact that the atoms in your hand,

1119
01:17:12.741 --> 01:17:17.510
we're born billions of years ago in the belly of a star and in fact some of

1120
01:17:17.511 --> 01:17:22.511
these atoms may have inhabited several stars in succession is even possible that

1121
01:17:22.551 --> 01:17:26.180
some atoms that were once in the bond is of historical figures like Churchill or

1122
01:17:26.181 --> 01:17:28.850
Cleopatra or now in you.
In fact,

1123
01:17:28.851 --> 01:17:33.260
it might be descriptively true to implicate the entire universe in your hand or

1124
01:17:33.261 --> 01:17:35.210
in any objects being what it is,

1125
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:41.000
but no such litany of concepts or connections can account for the mystery that

1126
01:17:41.001 --> 01:17:45.140
looms whenever you just look at something closely,
anything,

1127
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:47.060
however commonplace,

1128
01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:50.420
and realize that while you might have volumes of knowledge about it,

1129
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:54.860
you don't have the slightest understanding of what it is in itself.

1130
01:17:56.420 --> 01:18:00.650
Now,
others have noticed this fact,
Walter Benjamin,
the chairman,

1131
01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:01.513
literary critic,

1132
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.930
stumbled upon this mystery and Marcee after smoking hashish for the first time.

1133
01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:10.700
He distilled it in the phrase how things with Stan,
the gays

1134
01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.350
and all things really do with Stan the gays.

1135
01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:19.670
We confront the mystery of being in every moment,

1136
01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:24.710
but we don't notice it because there's mystery is tiled over with concepts.

1137
01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:26.770
<v 0>Okay?</v>

1138
01:18:26.770 --> 01:18:30.970
<v 4>Now,
meditation isn't about understanding things.
Conceptually.</v>

1139
01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:36.840
It's the ability to experience things more clearly prior to concepts.

1140
01:18:37.930 --> 01:18:42.160
It is the knowledge by acquaintance that Russell spoke of here taken to the

1141
01:18:42.161 --> 01:18:45.430
ultimate degree and the more you practice it,

1142
01:18:45.790 --> 01:18:48.880
you'll find that it really is a new form of intelligence.

1143
01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:53.320
It leads to another way of being in the world and one that can allow for a kind

1144
01:18:53.321 --> 01:18:56.830
of psychological freedom than a continuous entanglement with concepts.

1145
01:18:56.850 --> 01:18:57.683
It doesn't.

1146
01:18:59.130 --> 01:19:02.580
There's a famous parable from the Buddha meant to get at this difference.

1147
01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:08.160
A man has struck in the chest with a poison arrow and a surgeon Russia's to

1148
01:19:08.161 --> 01:19:10.590
assigned to begin the work of saving his life.

1149
01:19:11.490 --> 01:19:15.510
But the man resists the first wants to know the name of the Fletcher,

1150
01:19:15.511 --> 01:19:20.340
who fashioned the arrows shaft and the type of wood from which it was cut and

1151
01:19:20.341 --> 01:19:24.870
the motive of the man who shot it and the name of the horse upon what she road

1152
01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:28.570
and a thousand other things that have no bearing at all upon his present

1153
01:19:28.571 --> 01:19:33.180
suffering or ultimate survival.
So this man needs to get his priorities straight.

1154
01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:38.760
His commitment to thinking about the world results from a basic misunderstanding

1155
01:19:38.910 --> 01:19:42.540
of his predicament.
And then we may be only dimly aware of it,

1156
01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:46.740
we to have problems that will not be solved by more thinking.

1157
01:19:55.170 --> 01:19:55.651
Finally,

1158
01:19:55.651 --> 01:19:59.910
here's a 12 minute guided meditation that comes a little later in the course.

1159
01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:08.893
<v 0>Okay?</v>

1160
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:13.020
<v 4>As you get comfortable in your seat,</v>

1161
01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:18.360
he might keep your eyes open for the beginning of this session

1162
01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:25.410
and take a few deep breaths

1163
01:20:29.710 --> 01:20:34.710
and just let yourself settle into the feeling of resting in space.

1164
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:09.180
And as you gaze in front of you,

1165
01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:15.060
just let your gaze be as wide as possible.

1166
01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:19.350
No need to focus on anything in particular.

1167
01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:34.780
Just stare into space

1168
01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:38.500
with a soft eyes,

1169
01:21:43.710 --> 01:21:46.260
feeling the breath come and go.

1170
01:22:15.090 --> 01:22:17.190
Listen to the sounds in the room.

1171
01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:18.980
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1172
01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:21.650
<v 4>Horizon and passing away.</v>

1173
01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:34.680
And as you stare into your visual field,

1174
01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:39.860
take a moment to look for what is looking.

1175
01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:45.060
See if you can look back,

1176
01:22:46.110 --> 01:22:49.770
whether your attention at the one who has seen,

1177
01:22:54.430 --> 01:22:58.490
this may sound paradoxical,
but see what happens.

1178
01:22:58.510 --> 01:23:00.090
The moment you look,

1179
01:23:07.390 --> 01:23:12.260
it was a teacher named Douglas Hardin who wrote a book titled on Having No head

1180
01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:18.970
and the exercise he recommended to his students was to gaze at whatever is

1181
01:23:19.851 --> 01:23:24.350
before you and look for your own head.

1182
01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:32.240
Notice that your head is not one of the things you see.

1183
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:41.470
What does it like to see the world and simultaneously notice that your head is

1184
01:23:43.611 --> 01:23:45.020
not appearing in it.

1185
01:23:51.890 --> 01:23:55.760
See if that does anything to your sense of awareness.

1186
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:08.840
Harding used to say that where his head was supposed to be,

1187
01:24:10.670 --> 01:24:11.840
it was just the world.

1188
01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:18.650
See if you can be mindful of that
in each moment

1189
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:51.190
and now and gently close your eyes

1190
01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:56.290
and pay attention to this feeling

1191
01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:01.660
that you might have,
that you are now inside your head.

1192
01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.860
Your attention is in something,

1193
01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:09.760
but again,
what you're calling your head,

1194
01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:13.570
the sensations you get from your skin,

1195
01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:16.030
the muscles in your face.

1196
01:25:17.410 --> 01:25:20.530
All of that is appearing in consciousness.

1197
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:31.060
That which is aware is not inside of something.

1198
01:25:33.490 --> 01:25:34.780
Everything is in it.

1199
01:25:37.870 --> 01:25:39.030
See if you can feel that.

1200
01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:52.010
Open your eyes again

1201
01:25:54.290 --> 01:25:57.680
and ask yourself what has changed?

1202
01:26:01.730 --> 01:26:04.790
Is there a sense that the world comes rushing in?

1203
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:08.263
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1204
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:10.930
<v 4>the space just cut bigger.</v>

1205
01:26:16.010 --> 01:26:21.010
He might play with this opening and closing your eyes periodically.

1206
01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.110
Is there really a change?

1207
01:26:29.070 --> 01:26:32.010
Does it change in the contents of consciousness?
Clearly

1208
01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:38.040
there are things you can see with your eyes open that you can't with your eyes

1209
01:26:38.041 --> 01:26:38.874
closed,

1210
01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:43.950
but you still have a visual field in both cases.

1211
01:26:47.170 --> 01:26:48.003
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1212
01:26:49.230 --> 01:26:52.020
<v 4>When you close your eyes,
your visual field doesn't disappear.</v>

1213
01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:01.613
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1214
01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:05.690
<v 4>All of this changing or the contents of consciousness</v>

1215
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:31.980
and more and more as we proceed in this practice,

1216
01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:38.360
we went to be looking to see if the feeling that consciousness has a center,

1217
01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:45.920
that there's a meditator in the middle of each moment of meditation,

1218
01:27:47.310 --> 01:27:48.540
I think or have thoughts.

1219
01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:54.540
His seer of sites here of sounds

1220
01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:57.570
we'll be looking into that

1221
01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:04.180
have feeling that awareness emanates from a single point inside the head

1222
01:28:09.310 --> 01:28:14.310
and in some ways this is even easier to do with eyes open because we use vision

1223
01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:21.580
to define ourselves in opposition to our environment more than we do with the

1224
01:28:23.271 --> 01:28:24.104
other senses.

1225
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:30.440
There's a clear feeling that most of us have most of the time that we are behind

1226
01:28:30.441 --> 01:28:34.910
our face looking out at the world through our eyes.

1227
01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:40.570
But as you look out at the world in this moment,

1228
01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:46.060
see if that feeling is true.

1229
01:28:49.810 --> 01:28:50.650
You might look

1230
01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:56.650
to see if there's any evidence because you are behind your face

1231
01:28:58.450 --> 01:28:59.283
at this moment

1232
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:44.880
and the moment you notice you're lost in thought.

1233
01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:46.590
<v 0>Okay,</v>

1234
01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:48.300
<v 4>come back to this exercise.</v>

1235
01:29:50.670 --> 01:29:52.690
Keep paying attention very wide

1236
01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:56.380
with our eyes open or closed.

1237
01:30:10.450 --> 01:30:14.130
Have you seen if this feeling of being inside the head

1238
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:17.200
survive scrutiny

1239
01:30:43.950 --> 01:30:48.830
in the last minute of this session?
Just give up all efforts

1240
01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:55.600
and notice whatever appears on its own.

1241
01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:58.510
Well today I introduced a slightly different exercise

1242
01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:03.880
and there'll be some more of that coming from time to time.

1243
01:32:04.770 --> 01:32:09.770
This is good to use this growing facility with mindfulness to engage kind of

1244
01:32:13.811 --> 01:32:16.780
structured analysis of experience.

1245
01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:23.640
You can definitely precipitate certain insights by doing something a little more

1246
01:32:25.091 --> 01:32:29.260
directed than just noticing whatever happens to arise

1247
01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:34.990
and if you're interested you might get that book I mentioned on having no head

1248
01:32:34.991 --> 01:32:39.991
by Douglas Harding because he in a way that was quite unique to him,

1249
01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:46.080
developed analogies and exercises that can provoke an insight into the illusory

1250
01:32:48.881 --> 01:32:52.180
penis of subject object perception.

1251
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:56.410
It's not to say that consciousness is neurons in the brain.

1252
01:32:57.460 --> 01:33:02.460
It's not making any claims about your mind being coterminous with the rest of

1253
01:33:05.290 --> 01:33:06.280
the physical world.

1254
01:33:07.630 --> 01:33:12.630
What Harding was doing was showing that this sense of being inside the head from

1255
01:33:14.410 --> 01:33:19.410
the side of experience changes when you actually look to see if it's true and as

1256
01:33:22.781 --> 01:33:24.580
you play with that exercise,

1257
01:33:24.730 --> 01:33:29.730
you might find that a very expansive and centerless sense of what awareness is

1258
01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:38.700
can emerge in place of this feeling that you would otherwise call I.

1259
01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:50.453
<v 3>Okay,</v>

1260
01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:54.590
<v 4>well hopefully that gives you a sense of what I'm doing with awakened.
Of course,</v>

1261
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:59.360
again,
this is an ongoing project for me and as I add content to the course,

1262
01:33:59.390 --> 01:34:02.870
I'll be attempting to synthesize everything I've discovered in my own practice

1263
01:34:03.170 --> 01:34:04.910
and in philosophy and science generally.

1264
01:34:05.250 --> 01:34:09.110
That seems helpful for increasing our understanding of our own minds.
Of course,

1265
01:34:09.111 --> 01:34:12.170
many of these things have been discussed by philosophers and contemporary those

1266
01:34:12.171 --> 01:34:13.490
for thousands of years,

1267
01:34:14.090 --> 01:34:17.460
but they can now be viewed in a 21st century context.

1268
01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:19.770
So unlike my own podcast,

1269
01:34:20.140 --> 01:34:25.140
which deals with politics and recent developments in science and a host of

1270
01:34:25.141 --> 01:34:27.060
topical and controversial issues,

1271
01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:30.350
the waking of course is really a chance for me to talk about the most important

1272
01:34:30.351 --> 01:34:31.310
things I've ever learned.

1273
01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:35.860
So if you're interested in practicing meditation with me and engaging in

1274
01:34:35.861 --> 01:34:39.260
philosophical and scientific considerations about the nature of mind,

1275
01:34:40.230 --> 01:34:43.920
you can check it out@wakingup.com and thank you,
Tim,

1276
01:34:43.921 --> 01:34:45.270
for inviting me on your podcast.

1277
01:34:45.670 --> 01:34:49.080
Your audience should know that I consider myself not only a friend of yours,

1278
01:34:49.330 --> 01:34:52.940
but I'm also one of your true fans because yours is one of the podcasts that I

1279
01:34:52.941 --> 01:34:56.930
regularly listen to.
In fact,
with some regularity,
I steal your,

1280
01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:02.400
<v 2>I discovered Eric Weinstein on your podcast and he and I now have done a few</v>

1281
01:35:02.401 --> 01:35:03.234
together.

1282
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:08.350
I found will macaskill here along with the inimitable Jocko Willink.

1283
01:35:10.090 --> 01:35:13.960
Um,
I think there may be a few others and all those guys became not only podcast

1284
01:35:13.961 --> 01:35:18.880
guests but friends as well.
So apart from being grateful that turned my life.

1285
01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:23.260
Tim,
I am hugely benefiting from what you were doing in the world.

1286
01:35:23.530 --> 01:35:28.360
So keep it up my friend and thanks again for introducing me to your audience.

1287
01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:33.270
<v 5>Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

1288
01:35:33.630 --> 01:35:36.270
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1289
01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:39.480
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1290
01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:42.150
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday?

1291
01:35:42.450 --> 01:35:46.680
That provides a little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet

1292
01:35:46.681 --> 01:35:51.300
Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that

1293
01:35:51.301 --> 01:35:52.890
I've been pondering over the week.

1294
01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:55.890
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1295
01:35:55.891 --> 01:35:59.340
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1296
01:35:59.341 --> 01:36:03.630
somehow dug up in the other world of the esoteric as I do.

1297
01:36:03.930 --> 01:36:08.930
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

1298
01:36:09.571 --> 01:36:12.300
close friends,
for instance,
and it's very short.

1299
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:17.370
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

1300
01:36:17.430 --> 01:36:19.620
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

And if you sign up,

1303
01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:32.490
I hope you enjoy it.
I get asked all the time,

1304
01:36:32.491 --> 01:36:34.680
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

1305
01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:37.590
My answer is inevitably athletic Greens.

1306
01:36:37.591 --> 01:36:40.050
It is your all in one nutritional insurance.

1307
01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:41.760
I recommended it to the four hour body,

1308
01:36:41.850 --> 01:36:45.780
did not get paid for that and I travel with it to avoid getting sick.

1309
01:36:46.050 --> 01:36:48.840
I take it in the mornings to ensure optimal performance.

1310
01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:50.310
It just covers all my basis.

1311
01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:54.330
If I can't get what I need through whole food meals throughout the rest of the

1312
01:36:54.330 --> 01:36:56.340
day.
