00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.370
Hey guys,
Tim Ferriss here.
Before we jump into this episode,

2
00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:09.371
I'm going to do something I very rarely do and that is to make a direct ask with

3
00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:14.030
Hatton hand,
my brand new book just came out today.

4
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.580
It is called tribe of mentors,
subtitle,

5
00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:20.090
short life advice from the best in the world.
If you like the podcast,

6
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.340
you will love this book.

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.140
I reached out to 130 people who are the best at what they do in sports

8
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.790
investing,
business,
acting,
directing,
you name it.
We got it,

9
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:36.791
cryptocurrency done and it turned out better than I ever could have expected.

10
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.700
Many of my friends think of all my books.
It is the easiest to read,

11
00:00:40.701 --> 00:00:44.210
the easiest to use,
so check it out.
Please take a look.

12
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.330
I put out so much free material.
The podcast is free.

13
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.670
The 700 plus blog posts are free.

14
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.900
Every once in awhile I put out something like this and it's not that expensive,

15
00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:54.734
so please take a look.

16
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.740
Tribe of mentors.com and it does make a great holiday gift or gift for others.

17
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.170
There's something for everybody in here.

18
00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:05.780
It is really a choose your own adventure guide,

19
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.140
a buffet of options for improving your life,

20
00:01:09.141 --> 00:01:13.400
both in business and in the personal sphere.
So take a look.

21
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.720
I appreciate you taking a look.

22
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.930
Tribe of mentors.com or anywhere that books are sold

23
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.140
<v 1>optimal at this altitude,
I can</v>

24
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.310
start shaking [inaudible].

25
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.530
I'm a cybernetic organism,
living tissue.

26
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.830
<v 0>This episode is brought to you by Peloton and I'd heard about Peloton over and</v>

27
00:01:47.831 --> 00:01:48.640
over again,

28
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.560
but I ended up getting a Peloton bike and the whole system after I saw my buddy

29
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.680
Kevin Rose,
I've known him forever,
some of you know,

30
00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.740
and he showed up at my gate at my house a while back and he looked fantastic.

31
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.000
I asked him as a dude,
you look great.
What the hell have you been up to?

32
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.130
Because he's always doing a weird diet or another,

33
00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:10.660
but it only lasts like a week or two.

34
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.500
So he always regresses to the mean after like 75 beers.
And he said,

35
00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:18.580
I've been doing Peloton five days a week now that caught my attention because

36
00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:22.510
Kevin does nothing five days a week.
And you know,
I love you Kevin,

37
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.000
but it really peaked my curiosity.

38
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.060
Ended up getting a system and it's become an integral part of my week.

39
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.960
I love it and I really didn't expect to love it at all because I find cycling

40
00:02:34.961 --> 00:02:36.610
really boring usually.

41
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.620
But peloton is an indoor cycling bike that brings live studio classes right into

42
00:02:41.621 --> 00:02:42.454
your home.

43
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.040
You don't have to worry about fitting classes into your schedule or making it to

44
00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:47.080
a studio with some type of commute,

45
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.610
etc. New classes are added every day and this includes options led by elite New

46
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.080
York City instructors in your own living room.

47
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.100
You can even livestream studio classes taught by the world's best instructors or

48
00:02:57.101 --> 00:03:00.130
find your own favorite class on.
And in fact,

49
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:04.360
Kevin and I rarely do live classes and you can compete with your friends,

50
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.950
which is also fun.
Kevin,

51
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:10.150
I'm coming after you but we usually just use classes on demand.

52
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.690
I really like Matt Wilbur's and his iron,

53
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.660
high intensity training sessions that are shorter,
like 20 minutes.

54
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.240
And I think Kevin's favorite is Alex and everyone seems to have their favorite

55
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.930
instructor or you can select by music duration and so on.

56
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.940
Each Peloton bike includes a 22 inch HD touchscreen performance tracking

57
00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:31.451
metrics.

58
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:36.040
I think that along with the realtime leaderboard are the main reasons that this

59
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:40.420
caught my attention when cycling never had caught my attention before.

60
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.960
It's really pretty stunning what they've done with the user interface to keep

61
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:44.794
your attention.

62
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.850
The belt drive is quiet and it's smaller than you would expect so it can fit in

63
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:52.840
a living room or an office.
I actually have it in a large closet,

64
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:56.230
believe it or not and it fits with no problem.

65
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.240
So peloton is offering all of you guys,
listeners of the Tim Ferriss show,

66
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:06.241
a special offer and it is actually special visit one Peloton that's o n e p e l

67
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:12.871

68
00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:17.950

69
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.080
Now you might say ma accessories.
Wait,

70
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:24.730
I don't need fancy towels or whatever other supplemental bits and pieces.

71
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.950
No,
the shoes you need,

72
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:29.950
you need the clip in shoes and those are in the accessory category.

73
00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:33.520
So there's $100 off is a very legit $100 off.

74
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.270
So if you want to get in your workouts,

75
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.610

interval training or anything else or you just want to get a fantastic gift for

77
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:46.931

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.090
Check it out one peloton.com code Tim,

82
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.170
this episode is brought to you by convert kit.
My go to email service provider.

83
00:05:15.171 --> 00:05:18.590
I use them for everything.
If you've ever wondered how professional bloggers,

84
00:05:18.591 --> 00:05:19.371
podcasters,

85
00:05:19.371 --> 00:05:24.230
youtubers and so on can build a platform they control and get the word out about

86
00:05:24.231 --> 00:05:28.250
their best content,
email is still the answer.
People think it's all social.

87
00:05:28.251 --> 00:05:31.910
Social social,
but one algorithm change and oops,
bait and switch.

88
00:05:31.911 --> 00:05:33.650
Now you only reach 10% of your audience.

89
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.650
That is why I've doubled and tripled down on email.

90
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.890
After reviewing many different email service providers,

91
00:05:39.891 --> 00:05:43.490
I ended up selecting convert kit for email like five bullet Friday,

92
00:05:43.491 --> 00:05:47.900
which goes out to about a million people now because convert kit delivers on

93
00:05:47.901 --> 00:05:51.320
what matters most to me at least easy to use systems,

94
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.920
split testing and resending technology,
both very,
very important.

95
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.940
High rates of deliverability and hands on customer service.

96
00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:01.130
So whether you run a business or simply have,

97
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:05.870
say a serious blog convert kit has integrations with more than 70 different

98
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:09.320

99
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:11.540
wordpress,
ecommerce platforms like Shopify,

100
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:15.170
lead capture technology like bounce exchange or sumo and many more.

101
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.250
They also offer a visual automation builder that makes it really easy to deliver

102
00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:22.730
the right content to the right people in your audience just when they want it.

103
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:25.550
If you want a segment in different ways,
which a lot of people do,

104
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.210
convert kit offers,
plans that adjusted the size of your business,

105
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.110
so it's a good option whether you have a thousand people or 1 million on your

106
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.800
list,

107
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.240
and certainly I am planning on growing and growing and growing and I don't like

108
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:39.800
switching email service providers,

109
00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:43.370
so I thought very carefully about this before I selected them.

Why hello boys and girls,
ladies and germs.

119
00:07:17.701 --> 00:07:21.510
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show or

120
00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.170
perhaps you're listening to the brand new tribe of mentors podcasts,

121
00:07:25.171 --> 00:07:30.030
which is currently as of this recording number five across all of iTunes and

122
00:07:30.031 --> 00:07:31.080
apple podcasts.

123
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.370
This is a cross post episode so it appears in both places and I'll keep this

124
00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:36.450
intro short.

125
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.220
This conversation you're going to hear is with Tim urban and we'll get into his

126
00:07:41.221 --> 00:07:43.890
bio in the actual conversation.

127
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.480
It was recorded at Barnes and noble in Union Square,

128
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.110
New York City on the launch evening of the tribe of mentors book.

129
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.500
You can learn all about that@tribeofmentors.com we had a blast.

130
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.120
The audience was awesome.

131
00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.450
Thank you to everyone who came out and we'll probably be doing some more live

132
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.000
experiments like this.
So without further ado,

133
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:08.240
please enjoy my very wide ranging conversation with the ever hilarious and

134
00:08:08.971 --> 00:08:10.800
fascinating Tim urban

135
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:19.470
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

136
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.940
How's everybody doing?
All right,

137
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:33.070
this is exciting.

138
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.880
<v 2>Thank you all so much for coming and it's a real honor and privilege to have you</v>

139
00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:42.881
all here and we're going to do something a little bit different tonight rather

140
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.940
than do what is the norm and perhaps what I've done many times before.

141
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:51.710
Just get up and tell you all about this book that you already own.

142
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.600
I thought we'd do a bonus round with one of the guests,

143
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.050
one of the people who was interviewed for tribe of mentors.

144
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.650
So I'm going to welcome him to the stage and just a moment,

145
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:09.651
but I'll read the bio first while I wrestled with the audio and a,

146
00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:14.190
here we go.
One of my,
one of my favorite people in New York City,

147
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.420
so I'm excited and we'll be asking questions I've not asked him before.

148
00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:22.860
So this is a rare live edition of the Tim Ferriss show in some ways also.

149
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.410
Here we go.
Tim Urban,
he was Tim urban,

165
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.940
You can start with the first one.
Ilan Musk,

the world's radice to man 10 his ted talk inside the mind of a master

I checked it yesterday,

168
00:10:32.701 --> 00:10:37.560
25 million combined views.
Please welcome to the stage,

169
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:42.000
the incredible,
the brilliance and handsome Tim urban

170
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:47.450
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

171
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.450
<v 2>like your birthday party.</v>

172
00:10:52.451 --> 00:10:56.140
And I'm like stepping in the middle and it's very uncomfortable.
Well,
you know,

173
00:10:56.141 --> 00:11:01.141
I said what other Tim can I bring into the fold for those people who are maybe a

174
00:11:01.241 --> 00:11:05.020
little older like I am,
this is the t to the improved version.

175
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.600
That's terminator reference.
All right,

176
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:11.170
so I figure we'll jump into it and what we're going to do is we'll have a

177
00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:16.171
conversation which mostly involves me just asking him questions and then we'll

178
00:11:16.481 --> 00:11:21.481
jump into this fishbowl and answer some of your questions and then after that we

179
00:11:21.941 --> 00:11:22.980
will have the opportunity.

180
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.890
We might be here for awhile so I will not be offended if people are like peace.

181
00:11:26.891 --> 00:11:28.590
I'm out.
I don't want to wait a,

182
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.960
but we will have a chance to say hello and people who want to have photographs

183
00:11:31.961 --> 00:11:36.790
and so on.
We'll be able to do that.
Okay.
Let's just jump right into it.
All right.

184
00:11:36.791 --> 00:11:40.780
We put why before we put wine,

185
00:11:40.781 --> 00:11:42.790
you and I chatted a little bit about this.

186
00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.360
I guess it feels like a couple of nights ago,
but maybe it was yesterday.

187
00:11:46.361 --> 00:11:48.190
I can't remember.
It's been a big week.

188
00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.630
You blood casually for six years or so on the side.

189
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.610
Could you tell us about

190
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.880
<v 3>that blog?
What subjects that you cover?</v>

191
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:02.410
What characterized what you did part time for six years?

192
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.500
It uh,
so it was called underneath the turban.

193
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.550
So that's a little thing that I came up with.
Um,
and the turban.
Yes.

194
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:12.790
Cause my name is Tim Urban.
I was 23.
I wasn't taking,

195
00:12:12.791 --> 00:12:14.560
that guy was not a serious project

196
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.750
and it was very much a side project.
I um,

197
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:24.970
it was actually,
I think I can credit because credit,

198
00:12:24.971 --> 00:12:27.580
the fact that it was a side project for why I was,

199
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:32.140
I'm actually able to kind of be productive because I didn't have this pressure

200
00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:34.960
to do it.
I was like,
you know,
what's my voice?
Who am I as a writer?

201
00:12:34.961 --> 00:12:36.550
I wasn't a writer.
I was just doing something else.

202
00:12:36.551 --> 00:12:39.280
I was going to blog to procrastinate from all the other things that are supposed

203
00:12:39.281 --> 00:12:43.000
to be doing,
which liberated me creatively.
Actually.
I was able to kind of,

204
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.990
you know,
do my own thing and you know,
kind of find my voice and be,
you know,

205
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:52.000
kind of a little bit,
you know,
courageous at times.
Um,
and I think,

206
00:12:52.001 --> 00:12:55.090
um,
I think so.
So for someone like me is actually like,

207
00:12:55.091 --> 00:12:58.030
it was like a trick myself into,
uh,

208
00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.300
actually doing stuff that I normally probably would have.
Um,
you know,

209
00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.580
been a little bit more belabored and trying to get it going.
But,
uh Huh.
Yeah.

210
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.390
What type of subjects was it?
Was it similar?

211
00:13:07.391 --> 00:13:10.900
How was it most different and how is it most similar to wait,
but why?
Yeah,

212
00:13:10.901 --> 00:13:15.820
so it was very much more like a,
a blog blog.
You know,
I'd write about my day,

213
00:13:15.821 --> 00:13:17.140
I'd rant about,
you know,

214
00:13:17.141 --> 00:13:22.141
going to a store and then they had a McDonald's there and then they,

215
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.990
I was like,
don't get the six piece nugget,
you know,
get the four.

216
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:27.010
And then I ordered the 10,

217
00:13:27.011 --> 00:13:30.080
and then they actually have the end of the nights where they give me teen and

218
00:13:30.081 --> 00:13:34.210
then I eat all 18.
And that,
it was like that kind of like a story about my day.

219
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:39.250
Uh,
very much like just the top of my head,
just typing,
publishing,
you know.
Um,

220
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.840
and,
uh,
it never,
it was,

221
00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:45.070
it was a small little passionate following of like 700 people,

222
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.910
like six comments on a thing.
And that was that.
And it was,
um,

223
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.510
it was this side project,

224
00:13:49.511 --> 00:13:53.500
but it was a way for me to actually write like 300 blog posts over a six year

225
00:13:53.501 --> 00:13:55.420
span.
What were the,

226
00:13:55.510 --> 00:14:00.510
were there any seeds from that experience that then informed,

227
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.040
wait,
but why and why did you create wait,
but why?
Yeah,

228
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:08.440
and where's the name come from?
Yeah,
so,
so,
um,

229
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:11.710
I was able to kind of hone my voice through writing 300 blog posts.

230
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:15.010
I look back at the early ones and I,
I when sit like the tones I was using,

231
00:14:15.011 --> 00:14:19.690
so it was like 300 blog posts.
We'll teach you what you liked,
you know,

232
00:14:19.691 --> 00:14:23.200
the voice you'd like to write in.
Um,
and uh,
so that's one thing.

233
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:24.820
And then I also like towards the end,

234
00:14:24.821 --> 00:14:29.110
Isis decided one night to try to draw something.
Um,
and I kind of said,
let me,

235
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.960
you know,
I was going to try to depict this concept of,

236
00:14:31.961 --> 00:14:33.040
that was funny when someone,
you know,

237
00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:36.130
it was like doppelganger day on Facebook and someone posts a doppelganger that's

238
00:14:36.131 --> 00:14:39.040
way better looking than they are.
I always think that's kind of hilarious.
Um,

239
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.720
and I was like,
I'm going to draw this.

240
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:45.000
I figured it's kind of messy looking at then like a handsome stick figure with a

241
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:48.400
wave of hair.
And so I did that and it hit me that I'm like,
I,
I was like,

242
00:14:48.401 --> 00:14:50.410
that would be better and drawing.
And I realized I liked that.

243
00:14:50.411 --> 00:14:52.640
And so I discovered that there too.
So when I started,
wait,

244
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:55.760
but why a couple of other people also respond positively to that?

245
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:59.060
Or did he buried yeah,
they did.
It got great feedback.
And then I started just,

246
00:14:59.061 --> 00:15:00.050
every post on the lady was like,

247
00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:02.540
the last seven posts on the blog all had drawings.
It was like,

248
00:15:02.541 --> 00:15:05.480
I discovered that at the very end.
So then it was time just,
you know,

249
00:15:05.481 --> 00:15:08.000
starting a new project.
Why was it time to start a new project?

250
00:15:08.001 --> 00:15:12.830
Why not continue writing about the chicken?
Mcnuggets
good.
No,
it's not,

251
00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:16.950
I'm not trying to be a dick.
I'm,
no,
no,
it's fair.
And I,

252
00:15:16.951 --> 00:15:20.900
and I also write about chicken nuggets.
I'm sorry,
this family programming.

253
00:15:20.901 --> 00:15:25.710
Not sure.
Sorry.
Uh,
no,
I,
um,
I,
it was,
uh,

254
00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:30.800
I,
it was time in my life in general to like turn all my attention,

255
00:15:30.801 --> 00:15:34.190
not a third of my attention to one creative project.

256
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.100
It was always I'm doing something with my full time and then I'm doing these

257
00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:39.800
like two creative projects on the side.
I'm going to be a pain in the ass.

258
00:15:39.801 --> 00:15:43.100
I apologize.
But that's my nature.
Why was it time?

259
00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:48.101
Like what realization of conversation or getting fired or whatever catalyzed the

260
00:15:48.261 --> 00:15:51.920
decision?
You know,
it's time for me to put all my eggs in one basket.
Creatively.

261
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.800
It's this thing you do that makes me love your podcast.

262
00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:58.670
It's stressful being the person just learning this for the first time.

263
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:03.500
Um,
but,
um,
you know,
so for me it was actually,

264
00:16:03.501 --> 00:16:06.020
I spent the years from the age of 22 to 31,

265
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:11.030
like hating myself a little bit because I was burning to do something creative,

266
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.440
whether it was writing or music or something.
Uh,
and,

267
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.870
um,
and I always was doing them on the side.
You know,
I,
I,

268
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.590
it was like that,
that kind of,
uh,

269
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:26.750
that kind of leap of faith in my own kind of ability to do something creative

270
00:16:26.751 --> 00:16:30.050
full time took me nine years,
nine years that,
uh,

271
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:34.310
that I wasn't very happy.
And so I finally said,
you know,
I,
this is,

272
00:16:34.311 --> 00:16:36.230
I have to do something full time.

273
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.180
Cause I always thought if I could just do something full time,

274
00:16:38.181 --> 00:16:40.700
but all the energy from all of these things into one thing,
it would go,

275
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:44.150
it would go well.
So I decided,
you know,
um,
I,

276
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:47.840
I actually owned a business with my friend Andrew Finn,
and it was the fact that,

277
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:48.050
uh,

278
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:51.770
the business gotten to a decent enough spot that we were able to start something

279
00:16:51.771 --> 00:16:54.110
new and kind of,
that's when I jumped on.
What was the business?

280
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:58.010
It's a test prep company cannot,
this is a great business.

281
00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:03.040
So [inaudible] who's a very successful novelist also got his beginnings.

282
00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:08.180
It's a good starter,
a good like starter business aside and Robinson as well.

283
00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:12.050
So three people in this book.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
I think the together now,

284
00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.690
who knew?
Who knew I was onto like the starter business idea.

285
00:17:14.691 --> 00:17:18.080
I was just procrastinating from my music career is actually all I was doing when

286
00:17:18.081 --> 00:17:21.140
I started it because I was tutoring on the side.
And then of course,
you know,

287
00:17:21.141 --> 00:17:23.090
the other side things ended up taking all my time,

288
00:17:23.091 --> 00:17:27.800
which is what classic procrastinator would do.
Um,
but yeah,
just simple kind of,

289
00:17:27.801 --> 00:17:31.070
you know,
you'd be the,
each session pays for itself.
You don't need overhead.

290
00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:34.430
You at the beginning,
you don't need any full time employees.
And so we,

291
00:17:34.431 --> 00:17:37.310
but we had built it up to the point where we had good foot fulltime employees,

292
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:41.540
uh,
good enough to run,
um,
run it kind of without both of us there.

293
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.650
Um,

294
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.890
and so it was time to start something and we'd done this a couple of years ago.

295
00:17:45.891 --> 00:17:49.920
We started the podcast app back in 2011 with the theory that podcasts were just

296
00:17:49.921 --> 00:17:51.510
going to get bigger.
And they did.
Unfortunately,

297
00:17:51.511 --> 00:17:55.330
we didn't know how to build a good app.
You built a bad app,
build a bad app.
Um,

298
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:56.363
but we,

299
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.620
but now it was a couple of years later when it was time for something new and I

300
00:17:58.621 --> 00:18:01.410
said,
I'm going to jump on this and say I need to do something creative.

301
00:18:01.411 --> 00:18:05.370
Let me see if I can do it as also a business that like we can kind of own

302
00:18:05.371 --> 00:18:09.570
together.
You can run our tutoring company.
I'm going to go and start something.

303
00:18:09.571 --> 00:18:12.840
And you know,
I was,
it was between kind of like writing a musical,

304
00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:13.920
which is a terrible business.

305
00:18:13.921 --> 00:18:17.520
I wouldn't want to drag him into that or writing maybe a a content website

306
00:18:17.521 --> 00:18:20.340
that's,
that can,
you know,
have platform media platform that can,

307
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.080
that can be a business.
So that's why,

308
00:18:22.081 --> 00:18:24.990
that's where we send along that I knew those were things I could do creatively.

309
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:28.740
Well,
and so we settled on this and the of the premise was like,

310
00:18:28.741 --> 00:18:30.690
what if I took instead of five hours a week,

311
00:18:30.691 --> 00:18:34.710
try to blog 60 hours a week to write a blog,
what will happen?
Um,

312
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.710
and it took the things I knew that I had gotten good at on the other blog,

313
00:18:37.711 --> 00:18:41.460
which was just kind of writing colloquially,
um,
and uh,

314
00:18:41.461 --> 00:18:45.030
and drawing stick figures and started it from there.

315
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.760
What is the origin of the name?
Uh,

316
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:54.190
16 hours on go daddy searching for dotcoms.
Um,

317
00:18:55.710 --> 00:19:00.690
and man is,
there's not much,
there is not much.
Uh,
but I knew I didn't,
I,

318
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:05.090
uh,
I wanted it to be something that wouldn't pigeonhole it into,

319
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.670
you know.
All right.
So I mean,

320
00:19:08.671 --> 00:19:11.850
when you're just typing in random combinations of words,

321
00:19:11.851 --> 00:19:16.830
or is there some itch that you had related to the expression and then you do

322
00:19:16.831 --> 00:19:18.210
have a habit?
I was imagining,
oh,

323
00:19:18.211 --> 00:19:21.780
it's because people would say something to you and you want to test the

324
00:19:21.781 --> 00:19:25.350
assumptions or you wouldn't accept it at face value should go wait.
But why,

325
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.720
you know,
that was in my head how I explained it.
I wish it,

326
00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.870
I wish it was that situation.

327
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:36.230
I checked 2000 things and go down 150 came out.

328
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:42.330
Uh,
my girlfriend knocked out 140 immediately.
It was like,
absolutely not.

329
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:47.340
That leaves me with 10 where I was kind of like,
okay,
these are all bad,

330
00:19:47.341 --> 00:19:49.830
which is the least bad.
Which if the site's good,

331
00:19:49.831 --> 00:19:52.860
it can seem kind of cool suddenly,
maybe,
but it starts off bad,

332
00:19:52.861 --> 00:19:53.694
but then it's not that.

333
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.150
And there's some of the other ones were just extremely embarrassing.
So I'm just

334
00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.490
dangle that hook in front of me.

335
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:04.230
Were there any that I can give some examples too,

336
00:20:04.231 --> 00:20:07.940
if it makes you feel any better,
if both titles that are horrible.
Uh,

337
00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.860
but were there any that you really liked that your girlfriend shot down?

338
00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:16.740
You were like,
we can both do this embarrassing.
Can you actually just,
you
okay,

339
00:20:16.741 --> 00:20:20.790
I'll kick it off.
Uh,
so there was four.

340
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.650
What ended up being the,
for our work week,
there was lifestyle hustling.

341
00:20:25.651 --> 00:20:30.480
Glad I didn't use that.
There was drug dealing for fun and profit,

342
00:20:30.481 --> 00:20:33.900
which was promptly vetoed by every retailer.

343
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:39.120
Thank God.
Uh,
there was a broad band and the white sand,

344
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.750
I mean it goes,
it goes on.

345
00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.890
So sometimes you need life to save you from yourself.
Those are kind of good,

346
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.530
at least heard sensical.
Like they,
they have some kind of,

347
00:20:50.531 --> 00:20:55.240
I understand two of those three at least.
All right,
I'll take two out of three.

348
00:20:55.241 --> 00:20:57.700
That's partially because I'm giving you like the better of the worst,

349
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:03.280
but near return,
miniature king.com

350
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.880
I wasn't a deep,
you'd go daddy's spiral.
You know,

351
00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:12.370
if you ever been on one of these weird,
it gets really weird.

352
00:21:12.371 --> 00:21:13.300
So I'm there and I'm like,

353
00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:17.980
I'm like into this idea of a king because I picture the playing card cane.

354
00:21:17.981 --> 00:21:20.980
I'm like so a miniature king and I suddenly got obsessed with it.
I was like,

355
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:24.280
he has little legs and he's very angry.
He's very like cranky.

356
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.160
And it was like big adult people walking by him and he's on the ground.

357
00:21:27.161 --> 00:21:31.150
He's like two feet tall.
And my girlfriend was like,
Jesus.
Absolutely.

358
00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:37.870
But I got so addicted to the king concept that when I started,
wait,

359
00:21:37.871 --> 00:21:41.710
but why I made the logo that's playing,
I was just thinking he's pissed off.

360
00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:46.040
That's amazing.
You were like,
okay.
Kind of.
Yeah.

361
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.450
I still kind of think miniature king could have worked,
you know,
he's the mascot.

362
00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:56.800
He's,
he's cranky and anyway,
I like it.
All right.
But since then I've all,

363
00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:58.360
you know what you can do all this happens.

364
00:21:58.361 --> 00:22:01.220
I'll do you still own the Nutria can.com uh,

365
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:05.540
I own miniature king.com and about like 15 others.
Yeah.
Um,

366
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.250
yeah,
there's a lot of Jesus' half bro was going to do,

367
00:22:09.251 --> 00:22:12.850
I'm a site where I'm Jesus,
his half brother and how he's like,

368
00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:16.150
but he's not like the divine one.
He's just like born from like Jesus,

369
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:19.680
his mom with like some guy and he's,
and he's a upset.

370
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:23.350
What could go wrong with that?
Yeah.
He's got all kinds of,

371
00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.810
all kinds of psychological issues going on.
You know,
he's,

372
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:32.350
he's trying to figure out his career.
What,
what were,

373
00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:36.310
if you look back,
I look back and I remember the first,

374
00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:41.580
my first attempt at blogging and like the first 12 posts and I mean they're,

375
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:46.000
they've thankfully mostly been forgotten over time.

376
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.380
But what were your first,
you had,
you had more practice,

377
00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:54.670
you'd already put in 300 reps.
What were the first posts like?

378
00:22:54.671 --> 00:22:57.130
Do you remember any of the topics?
Yeah.
Well,

379
00:22:57.131 --> 00:23:01.270
so my early blog,
I mean the topics where it was like,

380
00:23:01.271 --> 00:23:03.420
they started with like three sentence thing.
So one of the,

381
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:06.820
I feel like the first three was,
you know,
the title was frankly,

382
00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:09.790
and then it said like peeing in the shower is wrong.
I don't want to be right.

383
00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:15.550
That was a blog post back in the day.
Flash forward six years now.
Wait.

384
00:23:15.551 --> 00:23:18.250
But why?
I knew more and I,
and I,

385
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.760
I knew right away it was going to be like long and thorough cause that's,
I just,

386
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.190
you know,
it was at my own site and I had a,
you know,

387
00:23:24.191 --> 00:23:27.650
I knew I could get into depth.
Um,
if I,
if I,
you know,

388
00:23:27.651 --> 00:23:31.270
could just go longer.
And so first the beginning,

389
00:23:31.271 --> 00:23:34.000
I was anonymous and I'm sure you dealt with this too,
at some point,
you know,

390
00:23:34.001 --> 00:23:38.800
you have to get attention phase.
So I,
um,
anonymous,

391
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:43.810
the only platform marketing platform I have is my personal Facebook page.
Um,
and,

392
00:23:43.811 --> 00:23:44.644
um,

393
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:49.160
I started with seven ways to be in sufferable on Facebook,

394
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.010
which sounds like a buzzfeed headline,
but it was like much more in depth.
Uh,

395
00:23:53.011 --> 00:23:57.680
I'd like gotten to the deep dark psychology of why like,
you know,

396
00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:01.460
like the why it's the wild west of social etiquette and why we're all like our

397
00:24:01.461 --> 00:24:05.190
very embarrassing version of ourselves on it and what the different like

398
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.090
qualities of negative human qualities that come through on it.

399
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:09.530
So that was the very first one.

400
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.930
I actually went to Easter island for a month before I started.
Wait,
but why?

401
00:24:12.931 --> 00:24:15.530
To just alone in the middle of nowhere,
right.

402
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.060
Blog posts and pick like my favorite one to put on first to just kind of like

403
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.770
figure out what,
and that was the winner.
Why did you pick Easter Island?
Um,

404
00:24:24.771 --> 00:24:28.600
I like the fact that you could take like a 2000 mile yard stick and swinging

405
00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:31.910
around the island and not hit any people.
Like that was cool to me.

406
00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:36.300
It was just so isolated.
Plus like the statues and the whole thing.
Uh,

407
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:38.660
and I was kind of like,
ah,
I've always wanted to go.

408
00:24:38.661 --> 00:24:41.330
I was either there or it was going to go to Lithuania in the winter and just

409
00:24:41.331 --> 00:24:43.490
creep out some small village.
Yeah.
Well,

410
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.850
well you could tell me a small village to creep out some time and they were just

411
00:24:46.851 --> 00:24:48.590
going to actually talk to someone and they're like,

412
00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.730
you may actually like arise arouse suspicion if you're like,

413
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:53.790
it's like foreign or like working every day,

414
00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:58.730
just writing blog posts and isolation and all the small Lithuanian village.
Yeah.

415
00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:02.180
It sounds like a George Clooney spy movie,
but I do want to,

416
00:25:02.181 --> 00:25:03.890
I do want to do that in the mid dead of winter.

417
00:25:03.891 --> 00:25:06.470
Go to like a small cold village somewhere.
Anyway.

418
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:10.700
So how did the blog posts do that one?
Um,
it did well,

419
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:14.150
the very first one I chose.
Well.
Um,
it,
it,

420
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.390
how did you choose it relative to the other ideas that you had?

421
00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:21.320
Trying to do some combo of like something that I thought was like true enough to

422
00:25:21.321 --> 00:25:23.810
me that represented like the kind of quality I wanted to do,

423
00:25:23.811 --> 00:25:27.380
but also that we could go viral just beginning.
Uh,

424
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:32.130
how can we go viral because that's the way you is this 2013 summer of 2013 in

425
00:25:32.131 --> 00:25:34.460
Santa.
All right.
Yeah.
So that post did really well.

426
00:25:34.461 --> 00:25:38.020
It got 500,000 uniques a month.
That's it.
Yeah.

427
00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:42.680
My whole last blog got 250,000 uniques in six years.
So this was like,
okay.

428
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:47.340
Longer like getting into more serious topics and insulting people.
Like you know,

429
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.940
it's onto something.
Plus,
you know,
I would,

430
00:25:49.941 --> 00:25:54.350
I didn't know at the time was that 2013 was a pretty magical year to be

431
00:25:54.351 --> 00:25:56.870
promoting content on Facebook.
Ah,
this was,

432
00:25:56.871 --> 00:26:00.590
that Facebook has decided let's show everyone just how powerful we are.

433
00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.900
And they started made,
this is why buzzfeed exploded.
Then upworthy,

434
00:26:03.901 --> 00:26:06.140
you first heard of it in 2013 viral Nova,

435
00:26:06.141 --> 00:26:09.110
these sites exploded because Facebook's algorithm basically said,

436
00:26:09.111 --> 00:26:11.900
anyone posting content,
we're going to show it to half a million people.

437
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:16.230
I was the right place at the right time.
And so that was very helpful as well.
Uh,

438
00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:16.940
you know,

439
00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:17.121
<v 2>yeah.</v>

440
00:26:17.121 --> 00:26:22.121
I just to to maybe underscore one thing because for instance,

441
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:28.220
when I started my first business,
it was the golden age of Google ad words.

442
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.740
I mean,
it was shooting fish in a barrel is so inexpensive.

443
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:33.470
And then when the four hour workweek launched,

444
00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:38.560
it was at the same time at south by southwest when Twitter was effectively

445
00:26:39.591 --> 00:26:40.970
publicly debuted.
I mean,

446
00:26:40.971 --> 00:26:45.000
there were big screens displaying all of the tweets in the world going on,

447
00:26:45.001 --> 00:26:48.300
which happened to be concentrated right in Austin,
Texas because it was so small.

448
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:54.170
And I would say that any time is the right time in some way,

449
00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:57.870
right?
So these opportunities we're talking about,

450
00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.430
there are these opportunities right now.

451
00:26:59.431 --> 00:27:03.240
You just have to try to sniff them out or to shoot in the dark and hope that

452
00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:08.280
you'll catch some tailwind.
But,
uh,
everybody has,

453
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.190
it seems with these stories,
some element of luck involved,

454
00:27:11.191 --> 00:27:14.610
but you can improve the odds cause that's just well,
right?
There's like 10 waves,

455
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.620
you know,
uh,
throughout your time.

456
00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:18.990
One of the waves as crusty when you're starting,
you don't know which one,

457
00:27:18.991 --> 00:27:20.520
but something is cresting at the time.

458
00:27:20.521 --> 00:27:24.420
It's the perfect time to start something for some reason always.
Right?

459
00:27:24.421 --> 00:27:26.880
And in every story where you find a component of good timing,

460
00:27:26.881 --> 00:27:29.700
there's usually a quite a bad time,
right?
Like podcast APP,

461
00:27:29.701 --> 00:27:31.190
like you were paddling for the right way,

462
00:27:31.191 --> 00:27:35.760
but we're just doing it years too early.
Yeah.
Uh,
all right.

463
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:40.410
So I want to bring another figure,
another character into this picture.

464
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.130
Whose Winston can you tell us about Winston please?

465
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:49.520
Winston's a close friend of mine,
I met him in 2005,
uh,

466
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:53.580
when he was three months old,
um,

467
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.370
like purchased him.
And um,

468
00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:59.250
you've lived happily together ever since.

469
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.100
He was the size of a golf ball at the time.
Now he's the size of a football,

470
00:28:02.101 --> 00:28:06.720
which is a huge upgrade for him.
Uh,
he's a tortoise.
Um,

471
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:11.070
but he's,
um,
he's very lovable.
He's a,

472
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.800
he's kind of my apartment screensaver.
Like I'm just sitting there.

473
00:28:13.801 --> 00:28:15.240
And what would be just an,

474
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.650
you was still seen and there's this like moseying thing,

475
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:24.420
middle moseying dinosaur that Moses by and who doesn't want that you should all

476
00:28:24.421 --> 00:28:27.030
own a tortoise.
It's weird that you,
most of you don't own a tortoise.

477
00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:33.310
Why did you name Him Winston?
Because I thought he had a church.
He'll look to him

478
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.990
or it's more the Churchill has a tortoise late to him.

479
00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.610
I'm sort of imagining the A,
and then I know that they're not the same,

480
00:28:41.611 --> 00:28:45.600
but like the sea turtles in finding Nemos,
it's like,
yeah,
I could see that.

481
00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:50.340
Maybe he has less charisma,
but otherwise,
yeah.

482
00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:55.710
Uh,
when I look at some of your posts,

483
00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:59.700
and I've had my,
my life very directly and profoundly impacted by,

484
00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:00.750
by some of your writing,

485
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:06.530
particularly about time remaining with say parents or family.

486
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:14.610
But when I look at some of your very research heavy posts and it feels funny to

487
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.140
call them posts,
uh,

488
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:20.930
whether it's on Ai or other topics that confuse a lot of people.
I mean,

489
00:29:20.931 --> 00:29:24.840
we're talking about for those of you who don't have any familiarity,

490
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:30.060
in some cases,
50,000 words,
70,000 words,

491
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:35.550
that's a book everybody,
how long has the four hour workweek?
Four hour work week?

492
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:39.720
Uh,
that's a solid.
Now it's deceptive to use page count,

493
00:29:39.721 --> 00:29:44.230
but that's how I think it's about,
I want to say what,
420 pages,
430 pages.

494
00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.020
And it's not gigantic Dr Seuss print.

495
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:51.250
So it's probably closer if I'm guessing taking a stab to the hundred thousand,

496
00:29:51.251 --> 00:29:54.130
120,000 word mark.
Uh,

497
00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:58.690
I seem to have sort of word inflation with the books,
right?

498
00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.170
They're getting bigger.
But when you,
when you're tackling one of these posts,

499
00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:08.670
what are some of the approaches or questions you ask that allow you to write

500
00:30:09.311 --> 00:30:12.040
something better and different?

501
00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:17.950
Because presumably many people are out there trying to learn about these various

502
00:30:17.951 --> 00:30:22.951
topics and yet you put out these posts that are the size of books that ended up

503
00:30:23.471 --> 00:30:28.450
going viral and you make complicated or seeming the complicated topics.

504
00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:29.620
Very digestible.

505
00:30:29.621 --> 00:30:34.621
So what is your approach to tackling a topic like AI?

506
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.690
Yeah.
Um,
so

507
00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:42.150
<v 3>it's pretty simple for me for first of all,
like I just,
just,</v>

508
00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:47.660
I do this kind of weird thing where I assume that my audience is,

509
00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:54.330
I picture like a stadium full of meat.
So it's narcissistic fantasy,
you know,

510
00:30:54.331 --> 00:30:59.040
but it's like,
you know,
it's just,
I'm just writing for,

511
00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.710
I'm writing the exact post that I would be thrilled to get.
Right.
So I'm just,

512
00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.520
that's my focus group right there.
It's right in my head.

513
00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:08.670
And it's easy because like,
you know,
we're all kind of like special,

514
00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.260
unique people except not really.

515
00:31:10.261 --> 00:31:12.900
There's like 100,000 copies of each of you out there somewhere.

516
00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.600
And the truth is like,
you know,
if I just write for me,

517
00:31:15.601 --> 00:31:18.330
there's a lot of people that have my exact what your taste.
I just know that.

518
00:31:18.331 --> 00:31:21.540
So I start there with kind of like,
Ooh,
who am I writing for that?

519
00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:25.560
That makes it easy.
Uh,
and so something like Ai,

520
00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:31.170
if there's a one through 10 scale of how much you know about something,

521
00:31:31.171 --> 00:31:33.090
10 is world leading expert in on,
you know,

522
00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.670
one has absolutely never heard of the term.
Um,
you know,

523
00:31:35.671 --> 00:31:37.950
I started the two or three on most stuff.
Like most layman,

524
00:31:37.951 --> 00:31:40.110
I'm a layman right at everything.
Um,

525
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:44.340
and so then I spend it just out of my curiosity is the driver.

526
00:31:44.341 --> 00:31:49.230
I picked topics I'm excited to dig into and I'll spend however long it takes.

527
00:31:49.231 --> 00:31:53.160
Sometimes it's one day,
sometimes it's three weeks,
sometimes it's three months,

528
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:55.590
but I'll take as long as I need to,
uh,

529
00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:59.540
to learn enough to get me to maybe like a five or a six out of 10,
you know,

530
00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:00.660
I'm not going to get a phd.

531
00:32:00.661 --> 00:32:03.450
I'm not going to spend five years getting myself to an eight or a nine,

532
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.460
but I'm going to get myself to a six where I'm like,

533
00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:08.580
I can answer basically any question a layman asks me,

534
00:32:08.581 --> 00:32:12.900
I can do a Q and a with an audience on this topic for 10 hours and I'll have a

535
00:32:12.901 --> 00:32:14.610
pretty good solid answer to everything.

536
00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:17.310
Not that I know necessarily the truth of everything,

537
00:32:17.311 --> 00:32:20.400
but I know when the experts don't know the truth and they're arguing,

538
00:32:20.401 --> 00:32:22.710
I know what the experts say about basically everything,

539
00:32:22.711 --> 00:32:27.210
so I get myself to that level and then I think about,
okay,

540
00:32:27.211 --> 00:32:30.130
so exports have sometimes a hard time explaining because they haven't been into

541
00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:34.140
two in decades sometimes and they have this jargon and they don't remember what

542
00:32:34.141 --> 00:32:37.620
it's like to be a two out of 10 I was there three weeks ago.

543
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:42.710
I know exactly what my readers know about this and I know exactly what,

544
00:32:42.861 --> 00:32:44.150
so I just looked at the road,

545
00:32:44.151 --> 00:32:47.460
I went down to get myself to a six and I think about,
you know what?

546
00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.510
How can I do that road way more efficiently?
If I could go do it again now,

547
00:32:50.511 --> 00:32:53.210
how could I do it in a much more fun way?
You know,
and what's,

548
00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.770
what's this fun story I can tell to bring readers from the tutors six.

549
00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.990
And so that's my challenge then is to basically package the road.

550
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:04.991
I just went down for three weeks and make it an hour and a half a package

551
00:33:05.271 --> 00:33:06.104
instead.

552
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:10.750
<v 2>Okay.
Not Surprising.
Lamps and follow up questions.
Uh,</v>

553
00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:16.860
let's pick a subject.
Have you written about cryptocurrency or blockchain?

554
00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:21.930
Not yet.
Oh,
perfect.
So highly requested,
Tom.
I'm sure it is.

555
00:33:21.931 --> 00:33:24.650
Now the reason I ask is that much like a,
I,

556
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:30.430
I have seen dozens of people attempt to explain without misrepresenting

557
00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:36.690
cryptocurrency and blockchain 101 for the masses.

558
00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:40.230
And it seems like almost every single attempt has failed.

559
00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:46.500
If you were to take that assignment on,
where would you start?

560
00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:50.470
<v 3>I would,
I always start,</v>

561
00:33:50.471 --> 00:33:53.210
I feel like I'm blindfolded in the room and I'm just trying to figure out where

562
00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.450
or even the walls here,
you know,
where is the furniture?

563
00:33:55.451 --> 00:33:58.090
I just want to start an understand what I even need to learn.

564
00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.660
So I want to get a picture of the topic and then I can start diving in,

565
00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:06.790
going on various rabbit holes and usually going outside of the topic or a rabbit

566
00:34:06.791 --> 00:34:11.590
hole outside the topic is procrastination,
but it also often,
you know,

567
00:34:11.591 --> 00:34:13.260
it gives you even more context.
Uh,

568
00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:15.970
you'll find some metaphor out there that you ended up bringing back.

569
00:34:15.971 --> 00:34:19.930
So I'll just read and read and watch youtube videos,
uh,

570
00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:24.920
all on the Internet.
How do you search?
So I'm reading,
are we talking,

571
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:29.200
you started Wikipedia is at ground zero.
Yeah,
I'll start a Wikipedia all,
uh,

572
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:30.760
for just a basic foundation.

573
00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.560
What can be as good at telling you where the walls are.

574
00:34:32.561 --> 00:34:36.150
Just letting even understand the topic in general and we can beat,

575
00:34:36.151 --> 00:34:38.450
he has a lot of good,
good knowledge on it.
So I'll go there.

576
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.620
Then I'll go to the bottom Wikipedia and start clicking on all the reference

577
00:34:41.621 --> 00:34:46.280
links.
Um,
and I'll usually Google like,
you know,

578
00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:50.770
blockchain pdf and you end up finding all these superbly boring,
you know,

579
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.490
journal articles.
Um,
and then I'll go on youtube.
There's a lot of good people,

580
00:34:54.491 --> 00:34:56.080
smart teachers explaining stuff on Youtube.

581
00:34:56.081 --> 00:34:57.550
They're not going to explain the whole thing.

582
00:34:57.551 --> 00:34:59.410
Usually they're going to explain one part,

583
00:34:59.411 --> 00:35:01.360
maybe I realized that to understand blockchain,

584
00:35:01.361 --> 00:35:03.700
you need to first go down three layers.

585
00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.820
You need to build a foundation that begins with understanding what encryption
is.

586
00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:10.960
You need to understand how encryption works in public keys and private keys.

587
00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:13.690
That's when you can start to on top of that,

588
00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.600
build an understanding of what a ledger is that would be on these different

589
00:35:16.601 --> 00:35:18.850
computers and how it could possibly be secure.

590
00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:22.540
And by the time you get to blockchain,
you're like eight layers up.
But,
um,

591
00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:25.840
so I'll go find a youtube video,
not on blockchain but on encryption.

592
00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:29.410
And then I'll find a youtube video explaining what ledgers are in general.

593
00:35:29.411 --> 00:35:31.780
I wasn't reading about the history of ledgers and where they're used in the

594
00:35:31.781 --> 00:35:34.180
world and you know,
encryption and where it was in,
you know,

595
00:35:34.181 --> 00:35:38.250
how was invented and how it's evolved and you just keep doing.
And the reason I,

596
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.130
it's easy for me,
this part is because I'm super curious.
So the more,

597
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:44.790
the more I learn,
the less icky the topic gets.
When the topic gets uneasy,

598
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:48.860
it gets started to be super delicious,
the opposite.
Um,
and then I,

599
00:35:48.861 --> 00:35:51.780
and then I kept meet another that starts with it's so fun.
Suddenly I'm like,

600
00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:52.261
I get it.

601
00:35:52.261 --> 00:35:55.050
And then I just want to like fill in the knowledge and I want to watch a youtube

602
00:35:55.051 --> 00:35:57.930
video I already know the answer to just to feel good about,
oh man,

603
00:35:57.931 --> 00:36:02.060
I already knew everything that he's saying.
This is great,
but it solidifies it.

604
00:36:02.061 --> 00:36:05.280
You hear seven different people articulate it in seven ways and you just rounds

605
00:36:05.281 --> 00:36:08.580
out your understanding and um,
and by the end they start to be like,

606
00:36:08.581 --> 00:36:11.760
I totally get this finding.

607
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:15.600
I find a video on youtube.
So last I checked,

608
00:36:15.601 --> 00:36:20.040
which was not recently a youtube is the second largest search engine in the

609
00:36:20.041 --> 00:36:23.880
world.
It's a lot of great stuff.
There's also a lot of nonsense.

610
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:28.950
How do you search?
So what are the terms?
How do you sort them?

611
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:34.470
How do you go about kicking properly?
Well,
so in Google it's,
I just,

612
00:36:34.471 --> 00:36:38.760
I will Google like blockchain,
leave that in a,
in a window,

613
00:36:38.761 --> 00:36:41.650
open a new window and I'll Google,
um,
uh,

614
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.690
bitcoin new window theory of new window,
cryptocurrency,
new window,

615
00:36:45.691 --> 00:36:49.260
like decentralized systems,
crypto new window,

616
00:36:49.261 --> 00:36:54.090
like the cryptocurrency is bullshit new window.
Like,
um,

617
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:57.180
you know,
whatever.
And I'll just keep going and I'll just think of anything.

618
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.930
And then each one of those windows I go back to and I just hold down command and

619
00:37:00.931 --> 00:37:04.550
I just click,
click,
click,
click,
click,
click and I 10 tab 10 tab 10 times.

620
00:37:04.551 --> 00:37:09.300
And I just go and read everything.
So that's Google,
you know,
again,
beyond that,

621
00:37:09.301 --> 00:37:10.620
I don't have to discern,

622
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:15.320
I don't care if this Gizmodo article is going to be really useful,
you know,

623
00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:19.170
whether it's going to be accurate because it's the beginning process is just if

624
00:37:19.171 --> 00:37:23.640
you read 70 articles that may or may not have validity to them,
uh,

625
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.811
the total,

626
00:37:24.811 --> 00:37:28.740
some of them actually start to understand what do we know as a species?

627
00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:29.580
Where are we all agreeing?

628
00:37:29.581 --> 00:37:32.700
And then where clearly a lot of people don't know what they're talking about.

629
00:37:32.701 --> 00:37:34.560
Or there's this broad,
you know,

630
00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:38.670
there's this kind of dichotomy of a view in this one area is,
is these people.

631
00:37:38.671 --> 00:37:41.490
And then as these people,
Youtube is kind of the same thing.

632
00:37:41.491 --> 00:37:44.340
I'll just start watching without discerning.
Again,
if you're a procrastinator,

633
00:37:44.341 --> 00:37:48.480
it's fantastic because you don't feel bad about just watching endlessly when

634
00:37:48.481 --> 00:37:50.380
you're taking all of your time and it's not what you're supposed to do.

635
00:37:50.381 --> 00:37:53.160
And it feels great.
So,
um,
I'll just,
I'll just watch.

636
00:37:53.161 --> 00:37:56.650
And then of course the sidebar starts to figure out you to very quickly and

637
00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:59.860
Google will figure out what you're doing and then youtube will start to put all

638
00:37:59.861 --> 00:38:00.840
of the things on the side for me.

639
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:04.300
Plus you start to see names you trust to make money in cryptocurrency.
Yeah,

640
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:06.690
well even just,
it's funny,

641
00:38:06.691 --> 00:38:10.080
I've just writing a post now on like won't get into this,
but like,
you know,

642
00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:12.540
political stuff and you know,
normally my sidebars like,

643
00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:15.540
look how much of an idiot Trump is and his voters.
And then I go to the,

644
00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:17.010
I'm now trying to tell,
you know,

645
00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.860
I was googling all of these conservative things and because I'm writing about,

646
00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.180
you know,
both sides of stuff,

647
00:38:21.181 --> 00:38:24.720
and suddenly the Internet starts to indoctrinate me the other way and they're

648
00:38:24.721 --> 00:38:28.500
like,
look at this.
Like,
why is Trump voter like,
embarrass this?
Like,
and I,

649
00:38:28.501 --> 00:38:31.830
and I look over and I'm kind of like,
no,
like,
and a couple hours later I'm like,

650
00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:33.530
Trump's the best.
Like,
you know,
let's go.

651
00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:38.500
So like the Youtube figures out your angle and it will start to kind of like

652
00:38:38.501 --> 00:38:42.010
feed your stuff.
Um,
and then there's certain names you trust,
you know,

653
00:38:42.011 --> 00:38:46.030
Hank and John Green,
like I trust them,
you know,
[inaudible] get sod.
I trust them.

654
00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:49.240
Um,
CGP grey as trust him.
So certain,
you know,

655
00:38:49.241 --> 00:38:53.080
you'll see certain names you trust minute physics.
Great.
So,
um,
there's also that,

656
00:38:53.081 --> 00:38:55.760
and it's same with thing with them.
You know,
Google,
of course,
like I'll trust

657
00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:57.040
<v 2>sources more than others.</v>

658
00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:02.400
And once you've ingested massive amounts of information and you've established a

659
00:39:03.911 --> 00:39:07.510
basic map for the territory,
what do you think?

660
00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:12.430
Are the tools or approaches,

661
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:18.990
anything at all that that help you to be so good at teaching these subjects in

662
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:23.620
the way that you presented or structure your pieces?

663
00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:26.250
<v 3>Yeah.
Well,
so again,
the starting point is I'm like,</v>

664
00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:30.210
I just went through this and I had to teach myself and I was bad at teaching

665
00:39:30.211 --> 00:39:33.010
myself because I didn't know what I was doing.
So now if I could,
I,

666
00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.030
the experience of a learner is fresh in my head.
So that's the first thing.

667
00:39:36.031 --> 00:39:39.930
It's helpful.
Um,
but then I always,

668
00:39:39.931 --> 00:39:42.150
basically with almost any explainer posts like that,

669
00:39:42.151 --> 00:39:46.530
I just zoom out helicopter up.
Like,
you know,
if you're,
if you're looking at,

670
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:50.750
um,
the land and you see kind of like a,
a beach,
you don't know what it is.
Is it,

671
00:39:50.751 --> 00:39:53.850
is,
is that,
oh,
is this a huge lake?
Uh,
is this a,
is this a little beach?

672
00:39:53.851 --> 00:39:55.620
And then there's,
there's a curve around,
I don't know.

673
00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:00.000
That's how I feel like a lot of the articles on AI or crypto currency are,

674
00:40:00.001 --> 00:40:02.730
they show you a piece of beach and they,
and,
and then the odds are,

675
00:40:02.731 --> 00:40:04.920
might have a full understanding,
but you just look at your,
they're just,

676
00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:06.060
they're just describing the beach.

677
00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:09.210
And so you take a helicopter up and you're like,
oh,
okay,
wait a second,

678
00:40:09.211 --> 00:40:11.910
this is a big river.
And there's a there and you go take up further.

679
00:40:11.911 --> 00:40:12.910
And you're like,
oh no,
this is uh,

680
00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:15.240
this is kind of a tributary that goes into the ocean.
And,

681
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.340
and now you're kind of up where airplanes go.

682
00:40:17.341 --> 00:40:20.370
And maybe even the international space station goes and you're like,
ah,
okay,

683
00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:21.750
this is actually what's going on.

684
00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:25.950
So I start there myself as a thinker and then when I'm trying to explain,

685
00:40:25.951 --> 00:40:28.080
I'm just going to start that were just why,
you know,

686
00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:30.480
people make fun of me and he's like,
I'll write about three different things.

687
00:40:30.481 --> 00:40:32.660
And they all started the big bang by the time I'm like,
dumb it down.

688
00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:34.310
I have to base on you.
Go back to the now.
Um,

689
00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:38.160
but like sometimes like it's helpful to you just like you just,
um,

690
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:41.940
by the time you get from the big bang to now suddenly it's like we're all like

691
00:40:41.941 --> 00:40:45.270
we can see the whole coastline of now the beach suddenly makes sense.

692
00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:50.370
And then I tried to make it fun also because who wants to like Sony,
you know,

693
00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.410
like the journal articles for the experts.
Like they're often just,

694
00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:55.680
they don't because they're not reading to entertain,
you know,

695
00:40:55.681 --> 00:41:00.020
and they're just an,
it's just bad.
It's like textbooks in school were so bad.

696
00:41:00.021 --> 00:41:00.960
There were so boring.

697
00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.660
Part of the reason I like youtube is because the people who end up with a lot of

698
00:41:03.661 --> 00:41:05.610
views on youtube that are going to end up,
you know,
on,

699
00:41:05.611 --> 00:41:09.450
on my recommended recommended thing there.
They have an eye for entertainment.

700
00:41:09.451 --> 00:41:10.284
So I tried to do the same.

701
00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:14.160
<v 2>Well and if you were to ask say friends of yours,</v>

702
00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.710
who are fans of your writing,

703
00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:22.260
what your ingredients for entertaining are,

704
00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:26.280
what might they say or just to ask you?
I'm just not sure.
I don't want you to do,

705
00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.560
I don't want you to be overly self deprecating.
I'm struggling.

706
00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:34.250
<v 3>Um,
yeah.
What,
what,
what makes it entertaining?
Because it is clearly,
well,</v>

707
00:41:34.251 --> 00:41:37.550
I again,
entertaining means 10 different things to 10 different people.
I get,

708
00:41:37.551 --> 00:41:41.090
you know,
every time I get nine emails from like,
you know,

709
00:41:41.091 --> 00:41:44.570
mothers and Kansas angry at me for swearing,
but like,
you know,
it's,

710
00:41:44.571 --> 00:41:48.260
it depends on,
you know,
it's,
you know,
it's,
it's,
it's,
um,

711
00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.590
I think trying to ad sense of humor into basically everything.

712
00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.730
You keep treating it light.
Um,
good metaphors.
Uh,
you know,
and that for me,

713
00:41:55.731 --> 00:41:57.530
lots of visuals.
I'm a visual learner.

714
00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:00.800
If I see a block of text and I'm just scrolling down,
I'm kind of upset.

715
00:42:00.801 --> 00:42:03.620
It's like,
feels like homework.
But if I can scroll down and every few paragraphs,

716
00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:07.330
there's a chart,
there's a comic,
I'm suddenly like,
okay,
this is fun.
I'm,

717
00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:10.700
I'm kind of excited.
Like,
and so that's how I think.
So I tried to do that.

718
00:42:10.701 --> 00:42:13.670
That's what I would want.
So I like,
I like,
um,
you know,

719
00:42:13.671 --> 00:42:16.930
like there's so many things where you can just do a funny stick drawing or a

720
00:42:16.931 --> 00:42:21.050
really good diagram and just it just way clearer and sticks in your head more.

721
00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:24.280
You know,
if I'm going to talk about procrastination,
I could talk about like the,

722
00:42:24.281 --> 00:42:27.470
the,
the limbic system and you know,
talk about,
um,
you know,

723
00:42:27.471 --> 00:42:29.240
how it works and it's our fight or flight zone.

724
00:42:29.241 --> 00:42:32.210
Or I can make an instinct gratification monkey and like,

725
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:36.200
cause that is essentially what it is and that's more memorable and I think more

726
00:42:36.201 --> 00:42:36.660
fun to read

727
00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:41.130
<v 2>at the time.
So you've really,
in my opinion,</v>

728
00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:41.880
uh,

729
00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:46.830
exhibited a mastery for taking what many people would consider extremely

730
00:42:46.831 --> 00:42:49.030
intimidating subjects,
uh,

731
00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.620
many of them involved in the forging.

732
00:42:52.621 --> 00:42:55.560
What we're going to experience as a species is the future.

733
00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:58.410
So I'd like to talk about the future for a second,

734
00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:01.920
and I want to read a quote here.
All right.

735
00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:07.080
Believe that you wrote or said this.
So correct me if I'm wrong.

736
00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:09.390
I always thought the future would be intense,

737
00:43:09.391 --> 00:43:13.500
but now I think the future is going fully fucking crazy.
Okay.

738
00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:19.310
So what are a few things that you're excited about or see coming down the pike

739
00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:24.990
in the future?
It doesn't have to be one or two babies could be many.

740
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:27.020
<v 3>It is going to be crazy.
And here's why.</v>

741
00:43:27.021 --> 00:43:29.770
So the first thought a lot of people have,
um,

742
00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:34.260
is that it's naive to think that the future is good.
This is all weird.

743
00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.240
The end of times everyone thinks that you know,
you know,

744
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:37.961
you're just another night.

745
00:43:37.961 --> 00:43:39.920
You've person that thinks they live in a special time because,

746
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:44.950
and the reason we all have that instinct is because we are biology moves very

747
00:43:46.341 --> 00:43:48.500
slowly.
It evolves very,
very slowly.

748
00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.880
So 50,000 years is nothing in biology and evolution.

749
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.980
So we barely changed meaning we are still a baby.

750
00:43:54.981 --> 00:43:59.981
Born today is a baby that is perfectly optimized to live in a tribe in Ethiopia

751
00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:02.390
and 50,000 BC.

752
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:06.320
And it is everything about it is ready for survival in that world.

753
00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:09.860
But what we've done is taken that baby away from its home planet and brought it

754
00:44:09.861 --> 00:44:10.640
to another planet,

755
00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:14.750
which is the earth in 2017 and that baby isn't made very well for this world.

756
00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:17.810
None of us are.
Okay.
So,
so the,

757
00:44:17.811 --> 00:44:22.460
the first thing to think about is just that a lot of our instincts and a lot of

758
00:44:22.461 --> 00:44:26.120
our,
you know,
intuitions are actually going to be inherently wrong.

759
00:44:26.121 --> 00:44:30.410
We're going to be living in a delusion that was helpful back then today just as

760
00:44:30.411 --> 00:44:32.910
is not great.
So the reason,

761
00:44:32.911 --> 00:44:36.480
the way you can cut through this and actually see reality when you're the bait,

762
00:44:36.481 --> 00:44:37.470
that baby is not,

763
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:41.580
it's not seeing reality isn't helpful to that baby fitting in with the tribe is

764
00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:45.960
and bleeding with the tribe believes it.
So today we want to see reality.

765
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:49.170
And so you can do things like,
you can just look at the facts sometimes.

766
00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:52.920
So managing the,
the,
it's gonna be a long answer.
Um,
I imagine that,

767
00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:56.250
I have a lot to say about us.
I imagine that this is what I want to say saying,

768
00:44:56.251 --> 00:45:00.330
but the zoom out,
this is a,
it's a thing enters or can't be short in my head.
So,

769
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:01.373
um,

770
00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:05.160
and that in the human history is about a thousand central comfortable folks get

771
00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:10.440
settle in,
um,
a thousand centuries of human history.
A hundred thousand years.

772
00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:15.300
Okay?
So each two centuries is a page in a book,
okay.
How many pages does this,

773
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.360
that's 700 8,500 pages,
let's say.
Actually,
you know,

774
00:45:18.361 --> 00:45:21.690
whatever ain't gon make me mad that they're finding older human roommates.

775
00:45:21.691 --> 00:45:23.730
So fine.
So 140,000 years,

776
00:45:23.731 --> 00:45:28.530
every page in this book that you're holding is 200 years in human history.
Okay?

777
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:33.600
Um,
so page one through six 50 of that book,

778
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:34.491
Hunter Gatherers,

779
00:45:34.491 --> 00:45:37.050
if you're an alien reading this book to understand what happened on this planet,

780
00:45:37.051 --> 00:45:42.000
your board,
I mean,
it is really boring.
Page six,
50,

781
00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.440
10,000 years ago,
you have the agriculture revolution,
okay,
wait,

782
00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:48.780
so suddenly people are coming together,
forming cities,
okay?

783
00:45:48.781 --> 00:45:50.850
They're starting to actually form larger civilizations.

784
00:45:50.851 --> 00:45:53.760
They have a collective intelligence,
uh,
that starting to form.

785
00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:54.780
They can compare notes.

786
00:45:54.781 --> 00:45:58.410
They can kind of create a knowledge tower that is bigger than any one of them.

787
00:45:58.411 --> 00:46:00.900
It's very interesting stuff.
So that's 50 pages ago.

788
00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:05.820
Then it gets boring again for awhile.
Okay.
Page six,
90 out of 700,
right?

789
00:46:05.821 --> 00:46:09.540
It's a little tiny end of the book.
Here you have Jesus,
you have,
you know,
six 93.

790
00:46:09.541 --> 00:46:12.450
You have,
uh,
the advent of Islam.

791
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:16.980
The Roman empire happens two pages ago.
It's already done.
Um,
697.

792
00:46:16.981 --> 00:46:19.740
You have imperialism for the first time.
You have countries.

793
00:46:19.741 --> 00:46:24.190
This is new thing that happened in the last three pages.
Page six 98.
Um,

794
00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:27.210
you have the enlightenment,
you have the renaissance,
you're things like this.

795
00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:32.100
It discovered that there's galaxies,
telescope page 699.
You have a,

796
00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:34.890
you,
you finally get to the beginning of the u s and the beginning of kind of

797
00:46:34.891 --> 00:46:38.880
constitutional democracies.
Right now.
Page 700 happens,

798
00:46:38.881 --> 00:46:42.720
which is from about 200 years ago till today.
Okay?
So the beginning of page 700,

799
00:46:42.721 --> 00:46:46.770
the alien turns the page.
Industrial Revolution happens.
Okay?

800
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:52.170
Big Deal.
Big Change.
Okay.
And as reads on the page,
things start to go crazy.

801
00:46:52.171 --> 00:46:56.400
You start to have you,
you,
you have an 699 pages.

802
00:46:56.401 --> 00:46:59.460
This alien or thread,
this boring ass species has,

803
00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:04.140
has communicated through letters and talking.
Uh,
you know,

804
00:47:04.141 --> 00:47:07.420
he was excited about language 500 pages ago.
Now he's born,
um,

805
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:11.400
smoke signals firing a cannon ball in the air and stuff like that.
Okay?

806
00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:14.370
Suddenly on page 700,
we'd go to the space station.

807
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.380
I mean in the space station we have the moon,
we have airplanes.

808
00:47:16.381 --> 00:47:20.820
You have card just on page 700,
699 pages,
okay.

809
00:47:20.821 --> 00:47:25.290
We have a,
and B,
we only communicate through,
well,
we have these kind of,
you know,

810
00:47:25.291 --> 00:47:30.220
simple,
uh,
transportation,
uh,
communication.
Now we have,
we have face time,
okay?

811
00:47:30.221 --> 00:47:33.850
We have,
you know,
we,
we have,
we have telephone,
we have the internet.
I mean crazy,

812
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:38.560
right?
Less than a billion people.
But the first 699 pages on page 700 alone,

813
00:47:38.561 --> 00:47:41.170
we crossed the one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six and 7000000001st and marks.

814
00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:44.710
So the aliens reading and like,
cause his wife comes in and is like,
hey,

815
00:47:44.711 --> 00:47:49.040
we're going,
we're going to have dinner.
So most intro,

816
00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:52.770
riveting things on things like what is about to happen to this species.
This is,

817
00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:56.830
this is crazy.
We just happened on this page here.
This is when we're born.

818
00:47:56.831 --> 00:48:01.030
We're born at the end of page 700.
Okay.
So

819
00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:06.240
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

820
00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:12.480
<v 3>what do you think the future's going to be like?
I'm like,
Oh,</v>

821
00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:14.940
page seven oh one and they're like,
how's this guy?

822
00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:20.630
There's no way.
It's the shit just goes bonkers.
Yeah.

823
00:48:20.631 --> 00:48:23.110
The three sentences on page seven,

824
00:48:23.111 --> 00:48:26.670
no one will take us to 2025 when they predict it.
Like,
you know,

825
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:31.500
AI is going to basically infiltrate every single industry and part of our lives

826
00:48:31.501 --> 00:48:32.550
the way electricity did it,

827
00:48:32.551 --> 00:48:36.600
like a 10 year span of 1880s I mean that's the first three sentences.
So to me,

828
00:48:36.601 --> 00:48:37.500
I see revolutions,

829
00:48:37.501 --> 00:48:40.650
the onset of the pages of the first half of page seven oh one the first quarter

830
00:48:40.651 --> 00:48:44.760
of page seven Oh one I see revolutions and uh,
you know,
Vr,
Ar,

831
00:48:44.761 --> 00:48:48.570
I see revolutions in Ai.
And see revolutions in brain machine interfaces.

832
00:48:48.571 --> 00:48:51.910
We're going to be able to think thoughts to each other way cooler than language

833
00:48:51.911 --> 00:48:55.530
for the first time.
Um,
were icy revolutions in genetic stuff.

834
00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.840
Your grandkids are going to be like so cheap.

835
00:48:57.870 --> 00:49:01.410
You just had a baby and hoped it was a good baby.

836
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:06.200
It's going to seem crazy to see so permanent.
Um,

837
00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:08.730
and you can just go on and on and on with things that you're,
look,

838
00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:11.550
how about this one?
Okay.
What are the major leaks for life?

839
00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:13.770
You can count on one hand for all of life.

840
00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:19.190
Simple cell to complex sell big one complex cell to multicell big one.

841
00:49:19.291 --> 00:49:21.840
We have animals now ocean to land.
Big One.

842
00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:26.820
I would say the fourth that fits on this same list is going from one planet to

843
00:49:26.821 --> 00:49:31.320
multi planets as a civilization that's happening in the next decade with his

844
00:49:31.321 --> 00:49:34.200
space.
No one talking about it yet,
but they will be,
I mean,

845
00:49:34.201 --> 00:49:37.260
just the fact that like we're going to witness in our lifetimes one of the great

846
00:49:37.261 --> 00:49:38.960
leaps for all of life.
Like this isn't normal.

847
00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:42.390
<v 2>So yeah.
Okay.</v>

848
00:49:42.391 --> 00:49:46.950
So I want to talk about extra planetary.
Um,
just a couple of,

849
00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:48.930
of,
of,
uh,

850
00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:53.790
curious notions that I've been bouncing around in my own head.

851
00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:58.900
If you had to bet on more humans inhabiting,
say,

852
00:49:58.901 --> 00:50:03.720
Mars or inhabiting space stations that don't have to conquer a separate gravity,

853
00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:05.400
where would you bet?

854
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Because there are competing camps or at least technologists who are looking at

855
00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:17.460
say,
habitating other planets or saying,
no,

856
00:50:17.461 --> 00:50:20.040
that makes no sense because now you're dealing with a separate environment,

857
00:50:20.041 --> 00:50:22.680
gravitational fields,
et cetera.
We're going to just build space stations.

858
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:26.810
<v 3>Yeah,
I'll take bars for awhile.
Uh,
Mars is probably going to have a million,</v>

859
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:27.831
you know,

860
00:50:27.831 --> 00:50:32.270
in the next five or six decades and then it'll eventually probably end up in a

861
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:36.590
billion people.
But,
uh,
I think space stations in the long run way better.
I mean,

862
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:40.330
it's gonna seem really crappy to be on a planet.
Uh,
it's going to be,
you know,

863
00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:41.091
being on a plan.

864
00:50:41.091 --> 00:50:45.080
It's going to seem very old school and very kind of rough compared to the space

865
00:50:45.081 --> 00:50:45.990
station.
We can,
you know,

866
00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:49.070
imagine dealing with whether it's going to seem crazy that you'd have to deal

867
00:50:49.071 --> 00:50:52.730
with weather that you had to deal with.
Things like climate change.
It's just not,

868
00:50:52.731 --> 00:50:54.890
not our problem.
We have to deal with bugs.
It's my,

869
00:50:54.891 --> 00:50:58.920
I be so happy there's no bugs on the space station.
So,
um,

870
00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:02.420
so I think in the long run that,
but I have a more important question,

871
00:51:02.421 --> 00:51:06.380
which is are you going to go to Mars?
No,
no.
Well,
not in the near term.

872
00:51:06.381 --> 00:51:08.740
I don't to be the first monkey shot at the first Mars.

873
00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:12.110
I'll led quite a few people work out the kinks on that one.
I mean,

874
00:51:12.111 --> 00:51:16.040
we can't even figure out how to upgrade ios without replacing I

875
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:22.790
fucking images.
Like I'm going to let someone shoot me to Mars.
No,

876
00:51:22.791 --> 00:51:27.230
no,
not early.
No.
Okay.
Now picture is 20 years from now and the last,
you know,

877
00:51:27.231 --> 00:51:30.680
every 26 months,
you know,
earth lap smarts.
Okay.

878
00:51:30.681 --> 00:51:33.830
And they ended up next to each other and that's when you have this window to go.

879
00:51:33.831 --> 00:51:36.830
So every 26 months there's going to be a fleet to colonial fleet.

880
00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:39.620
Heading there and another fleet coming back,
bringing people back,

881
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:41.720
round trip tickets.
Um,

882
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:47.410
different people on the legs,
right?
Yeah,
no,
no,
exactly.
And just,

883
00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:49.670
I'd be like first class things,
it'll be like fancy people,

884
00:51:49.671 --> 00:51:52.160
but everyone be like jumping around,
bouncing around with the gravity.

885
00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:56.630
It sounds great.
Like zero gravity cruise ship.
So question is for you.

886
00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:01.100
Uh,
it's 20,
38,
2020,
45 and it's a,

887
00:52:01.101 --> 00:52:04.640
it's been proven for the last like 20 trip back where no one's gotten hurt.

888
00:52:04.641 --> 00:52:08.570
It's totally safe.
Would I visit?
Yeah.
Yeah.

889
00:52:08.571 --> 00:52:12.000
What's the total time invested at this point in the trend?
Let's say the first,

890
00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:14.560
the shortest round trip you can do as a 52 month or

891
00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:21.140
I would,
I would strongly consider it.
Okay.
I heard,

892
00:52:21.141 --> 00:52:23.480
I heard Jeff Bezos recently on stage,
you know,

893
00:52:23.481 --> 00:52:27.110
before you think about going to Mars,
spend a month in Antarctica,

894
00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:32.390
that's a cakewalk.
Oh,
Antarctica is way better than Mars,
Antarctica,

895
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:37.540
but 15 or 20 degrees colder,
you can't breathe the air.
Uh,
uh,

896
00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:41.590
you can't be outside in the sun without a radiation suit.
Uh,

897
00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:45.440
I think it depends a lot on the brochure of Mars Club Med that I received.
Yes,

898
00:52:45.441 --> 00:52:50.270
it's not
a,
all right.
Shifting gears a little bit.

899
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:54.800
Ai,
do you think it is an existential threat or not?
And if so,

900
00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:58.280
what is the time horizon for becoming a,

901
00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:03.710
a imminent existential threat?
Um,

902
00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:06.820
so this is the,
one of the great questions.
Uh,
you know,

903
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:10.970
AI is probably the subject I've talked to most experts on,
so I'm not an expert,

904
00:53:10.971 --> 00:53:12.440
but I've really know what the experts think.

905
00:53:12.441 --> 00:53:15.110
And I tried to keep up to date because they changed their minds a lot.
Uh,

906
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:18.290
so it will be fine.
No,
we're all done.
No,
we'll be fine then.
We're all done.

907
00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:23.270
What I find is very few people who don't think this is going to basically take

908
00:53:23.271 --> 00:53:26.160
over everything.
Uh,
the question is when,

909
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:29.340
and I was surprised that even the people that are pessimistic,

910
00:53:29.341 --> 00:53:31.650
they kind of think,
oh,
it might be a hundred years from now on.

911
00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:35.970
Most people think 50 30 and people at deep mind these days at Google,

912
00:53:35.971 --> 00:53:37.620
which is like the leading Ai Company.

913
00:53:37.621 --> 00:53:41.580
Now they're saying things like 10 and this is what I say 10 10 till what I'm

914
00:53:41.581 --> 00:53:46.080
talking about.
Um,
you know,
before any of this moment happens,

915
00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:49.950
it's like there's to understand Ai,
you have to think about two things.

916
00:53:49.951 --> 00:53:52.500
There's narrow intelligence and there's general intelligence.

917
00:53:52.501 --> 00:53:57.390
So humans have general intelligence.
We are smart across the board.
Okay,
we have,

918
00:53:57.420 --> 00:54:01.650
we have social skills,
we have creativity,
we can understand math,
we can read,

919
00:54:01.651 --> 00:54:05.190
we can be creative,
we can learn from experience.
You just name it,
name anything.

920
00:54:05.191 --> 00:54:07.650
Humans can kind of learn how to be smart.
They're okay.

921
00:54:07.651 --> 00:54:10.530
But when you think about Ai,

922
00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:14.420
AI is way better than any human at the things that's good at like chess is that

923
00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:16.490
the world chess master,
right?
Of course.
And it's the,

924
00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.570
it's the real master at everything that it does well,

925
00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:21.510
but it's only good at that one thing for this AI on your phone.

926
00:54:21.511 --> 00:54:24.150
Does AI in your car and this AI running most stuff at this point,

927
00:54:24.151 --> 00:54:28.500
but it's only good at one thing.
So the question is,
when will AI become,
gain?

928
00:54:28.501 --> 00:54:32.040
That same breadth that we have when we'll have become broadly smart.

929
00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:35.670
And until then,
it's still going to change the world.

930
00:54:35.671 --> 00:54:38.270
It's still going to take a huge amount of jobs and,
and,
and,

931
00:54:38.271 --> 00:54:41.520
and create a whole new,
you know,
a whole bunch more.
Um,

932
00:54:41.521 --> 00:54:44.730
so it's going to be a massive group of changes that happen even before we get

933
00:54:44.731 --> 00:54:45.451
general intelligence.

934
00:54:45.451 --> 00:54:49.050
But the question that I was referring to before is when do we get to this level

935
00:54:49.051 --> 00:54:52.980
where AI is now smart like we are,
but way,
way smarter.

936
00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:55.140
What Nick Bostrom called Super Intelligence where it's,

937
00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:59.100
it's a smarter than us as we are then monkeys.
Yeah.

938
00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:04.200
So basically if you picture like not only can a monkey not like build this room

939
00:55:04.201 --> 00:55:04.921
are not only can,
you know,

940
00:55:04.921 --> 00:55:07.590
when you look out in the night sky and you see little lights moving around,

941
00:55:07.591 --> 00:55:09.570
you know,
humans are so smart.
We put those there.

942
00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:13.680
We put airplanes in satellites in the night sky,
right?

943
00:55:13.681 --> 00:55:17.950
So not only can a monkey not do that,
um,
you can show the monkey the light.

944
00:55:17.951 --> 00:55:21.380
So this building and you can't,
you can't even understand that you did.

945
00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:24.510
It just will think that it's just there that's just as moving star,
right?

946
00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:28.200
So we're talking about something that not only can we not do what this thing can

947
00:55:28.201 --> 00:55:32.430
do,
we can't even understand that it did it,
even if it tried to explain it.

948
00:55:32.431 --> 00:55:36.090
That's how smart this thing is to really crazy concept.

949
00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:40.830
So things that we think are hard like curing disease,
poverty,

950
00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:44.820
you know,
climate change,
name it,
you know,
anything that we consider a challenge,

951
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:48.300
uh,
easy piece of cake for the AI.

952
00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:51.090
So that's the really exciting side.
And then there's the,

953
00:55:51.091 --> 00:55:53.820
what if we're not in control of it the way we want to be,

954
00:55:53.821 --> 00:55:57.020
not that it's going to be evil.
That's this anthropomorphization that people do.

955
00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:59.520
They try to apply human stuff to this thing that's not human.

956
00:55:59.521 --> 00:56:02.760
But when you build a house and there's an ant hill there,

957
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:05.700
you're not like ha depth to the hands.

958
00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:08.190
You just build a house and they were in the way so you killed them.
Big Deal,

959
00:56:08.191 --> 00:56:12.120
right?
The fear is that the ad is doing its thing.
And that it just,

960
00:56:12.121 --> 00:56:15.120
we're kind of in the way and that we programmed it in a way that we didn't think

961
00:56:15.121 --> 00:56:18.600
of this thing,
but now it's too powerful.
We can't change it and,

962
00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.430
and we're toast or it gets,

963
00:56:20.431 --> 00:56:23.740
it gets annoyed that we're doing something to it that it doesn't and we're
toast.

964
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:27.310
So you have some high stakes here.
Uh,

965
00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:31.000
and which is why basically we're going to have God on earth because we can play

966
00:56:31.001 --> 00:56:32.380
God to every other animal right now.

967
00:56:32.381 --> 00:56:35.200
Even a chip chips are really smart until we put it in a cage.

968
00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:37.390
Now when are you going to do,
we haven't gotten,
we have a taser.

969
00:56:37.391 --> 00:56:38.380
We can poison it's food.

970
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:42.520
Chimps are nothing compared to our God like ability because we have a little

971
00:56:42.521 --> 00:56:45.130
intelligence gap over them.
Little in the scheme of things,

972
00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:47.890
when this thing has a big intelligence gap over us,

973
00:56:47.891 --> 00:56:50.320
it's truly complaint God to us.
So the question is,

974
00:56:50.321 --> 00:56:53.860
is it a good God that could solve all of our problems or is it like one of those

975
00:56:53.861 --> 00:56:58.750
Dick Gods in the Old Testament?
Like that guy.
So this is what the,

976
00:56:58.751 --> 00:57:01.960
this is what they're talking about.
This is why AI safety so important,

977
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:04.990
but most of the money in time is going into AI development right now.

978
00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:10.250
So the last question then we'll go to go to audience questions.
Uh,

979
00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:14.350
how do you view happiness?

980
00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:17.770
Just to bring it back to things that we may be able to influence,

981
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:22.870
at least speaking for myself and a lot of people in this room.
Uh,

982
00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:28.030
how do you view or define happiness for yourself if you do it all?
Yeah,

983
00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:29.470
well I kind of think of,
um,

984
00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:32.740
there's two kinds of happiness that you have to kind of deal with.
Both.

985
00:57:32.741 --> 00:57:34.120
One is like micro happiness,

986
00:57:34.121 --> 00:57:38.800
like are your Tuesday's good that you generally having a good Tuesday?
Uh,

987
00:57:38.801 --> 00:57:42.160
and then there's like macro happiness.
Like are you present?
Are you like,
yeah,

988
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:46.000
I'll dig into this current life for 20 years.
I love it.
Or are you like,

989
00:57:46.001 --> 00:57:49.180
I was for nine years after college,
which is like,
well,
I'm doing this now,

990
00:57:49.181 --> 00:57:54.130
but I really want to like I should be doing,
you know,
and that's macro happiness.

991
00:57:54.131 --> 00:57:56.050
So I think you have to worry about both.

992
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:59.710
I think that the most important one to get right at the beginning,

993
00:57:59.711 --> 00:58:02.710
at least as a macro,
I think if your macro happiness isn't there,

994
00:58:03.370 --> 00:58:06.060
you know you're gonna,
you're going to have,
um,
you're gonna,

995
00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:08.980
you're going to feel frustrated,
kind of,
you don't have a cloud over you.

996
00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:11.650
And then I think you can work on micro happiness,
which is about lifestyle.

997
00:58:11.651 --> 00:58:14.380
This is what you're so good at and is,
I think a lot of people here,
you know,

998
00:58:14.381 --> 00:58:17.920
really both for both kind of happiness as they look to you because you have a

999
00:58:17.921 --> 00:58:20.270
lot of good advice.
But I think with Mike Rowe,
you really have,

1000
00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:24.580
you focus so hard on like just really crushing like a Tuesday.

1001
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:28.020
And I think like that,
but all life is,

1002
00:58:28.021 --> 00:58:30.130
is literally a Tuesday again and again and then you die.

1003
00:58:30.131 --> 00:58:33.670
So the crushing the Tuesday's the title of my next book,
let's get good at it.

1004
00:58:33.671 --> 00:58:37.420
Right?
White Sand in Tuesdays.
Um,

1005
00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:40.790
but so yeah,
and,
and the,
the,
with the,

1006
00:58:40.791 --> 00:58:43.720
with the hard thing that's hard is a lot of times we as so be assumed that it's

1007
00:58:43.721 --> 00:58:47.410
the external world.
We have to succeed.
We have to,
you know,
get,

1008
00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:51.280
get this relationship and then we'll be,
and you know,
this is kind of Cliche,

1009
00:58:51.281 --> 00:58:53.200
but we know that it's,
it's,
it's the,

1010
00:58:53.201 --> 00:58:55.810
it's messing with your internal expectations.

1011
00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:58.850
It's getting your mind in the right place and,
and,

1012
00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:01.000
and kind of seeing reality and get,

1013
00:59:01.001 --> 00:59:05.650
see what is your ego and what is your fear and what is kind of,
you know,

1014
00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:09.310
worrying about judgment and what is actually real that matters to you.
And,

1015
00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:12.850
and realizing that a lot of the perceived risk isn't really dangerous and a lot

1016
00:59:12.851 --> 00:59:15.020
of their perceived reward isn't really gratifying.
And this,

1017
00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:15.970
it's all there in front of you.

1018
00:59:15.971 --> 00:59:20.971
If you can just look past your primate self with your very rational intelligence

1019
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:24.020
self and just see it and then learn to internalize it,

1020
00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:26.510
often suddenly the happiness is or you know,

1021
00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:28.520
become very clear how to work themselves out.

1022
00:59:28.521 --> 00:59:32.330
And it's up and often we end up spending all our time trying to get to those

1023
00:59:32.331 --> 00:59:35.390
happinesses with the primate kind of self in charge.

1024
00:59:35.391 --> 00:59:36.590
And that usually doesn't get us there.

1025
00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:42.040
<v 2>So the add to that reality minus expectations,</v>

1026
00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:47.500
is that a useful framework for defining happiness,
do you think?

1027
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:49.510
<v 3>Yeah,
I mean if,</v>

1028
00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:52.010
so you're just saying you know what your happiness is like an equation.

1029
00:59:52.011 --> 00:59:55.400
Reality minus expectations is your happiness and um,

1030
00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:58.400
and so you can work on two things.

1031
00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:01.970
You can work on improving your reality or you can work on not lowering,

1032
01:00:01.971 --> 01:00:06.020
but kind of like refining your expectations to reflect what actually matters to

1033
01:00:06.021 --> 01:00:09.320
you,
which will almost always end up with them lowering in a certain sense.

1034
01:00:09.321 --> 01:00:12.500
And maybe maybe going up in another sense,
but um,
you know,

1035
01:00:12.501 --> 01:00:15.320
the classic trap of course is like,
you know,

1036
01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:17.150
you're in a way better place than you were 10 years ago,

1037
01:00:17.151 --> 01:00:21.560
but you're just as unhappy because you're the hedonic treadmill concept is this

1038
01:00:21.561 --> 01:00:23.780
term that psychologists use that you know,
you just,

1039
01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:26.540
your happiness goes up because something really good happens.
Even like,
you know,

1040
01:00:26.541 --> 01:00:27.890
the little examples,
you get a new,

1041
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:29.710
you buy something new in your wake up in the morning,
you're like,

1042
01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:34.670
oh my iPhone x 10 whatever.
And you're like all happy.
And then like,
you know,

1043
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:37.340
every day that that goes down in six days later,

1044
01:00:37.341 --> 01:00:40.460
it's just you're stupid iPhone again.
But we use this in a macro sense.

1045
01:00:40.461 --> 01:00:42.890
You get the new job,
you finally get into a really good relationship,

1046
01:00:42.891 --> 01:00:43.760
you work it out or you know,

1047
01:00:43.761 --> 01:00:47.690
you have a sick friend or a parent and then they get healthy and wow.
And then,

1048
01:00:47.691 --> 01:00:52.430
um,
instead of just,
you know,
so the obvious way to,
um,
to,

1049
01:00:52.431 --> 01:00:57.080
to get off the treadmill is,
it's obvious just sets over,
grabbing gratitude.

1050
01:00:57.081 --> 01:01:00.080
There's like what I have,
what I want.
And like looking up,

1051
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:03.320
you're going to be really unhappy and if you keep the mountain keeps growing

1052
01:01:03.321 --> 01:01:04.610
underneath you,
but you're not even looking at it,

1053
01:01:04.611 --> 01:01:07.070
you're just looking up all the time.
It's going to seem like everything sucks.

1054
01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:09.440
If you're looking down,
you're like,
look at this mountain,
it's amazing.

1055
01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:12.410
Look at all the things I have.
Like you're going to be really happy.
So like the,

1056
01:01:12.411 --> 01:01:14.720
the gratitude things are real,
like all the,
you know,

1057
01:01:14.721 --> 01:01:18.380
the thing we is just to write three good things that happened that day.
Uh,

1058
01:01:18.381 --> 01:01:19.580
every night before you go to bed,

1059
01:01:19.581 --> 01:01:21.750
write three good things that happened and why they happen.

1060
01:01:21.751 --> 01:01:23.030
The reason that people want you to,

1061
01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:26.990
that psychologist say this is good is because it trains your brain to all day be

1062
01:01:26.991 --> 01:01:28.760
thinking,
wait,
what's good and they have to do this thing tonight.

1063
01:01:28.761 --> 01:01:30.000
Like it's just what's good,
what's good,

1064
01:01:30.001 --> 01:01:32.270
and you're suddenly you're looking down and all of these things that are good in

1065
01:01:32.271 --> 01:01:34.850
your life as opposed to kind of looking up at what sucks,

1066
01:01:34.851 --> 01:01:37.550
what sucks about the situation,
how has the world wronging me,
which is a

1067
01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:42.330
<v 2>pure recipe for unhappiness.
Okay,
I'm going to,</v>

1068
01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:46.380
I'm going to try to put a little icing on top just to,

1069
01:01:46.381 --> 01:01:47.760
just to add to that,

1070
01:01:47.761 --> 01:01:52.761
which is as reading recently about some of the supposedly objectively assessed

1071
01:01:53.730 --> 01:01:56.940
happiest places on earth.
And if you look at them,

1072
01:01:56.970 --> 01:01:59.280
three of them are Costa Rica.

1073
01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:05.790
Ego,
Buddha.
Okay.

1074
01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:09.790
Screwed up my gender already.
It's not bad to do and these days,
Huh?
All right.

1075
01:02:09.791 --> 01:02:12.870
At least I did it in Spanish.
Uh,
so moving on,

1076
01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:20.380
I'm going to move,
move on quickly.
Costa Rica,
Singapore and I sing porn.

1077
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:23.820
Is everyone a shout?
Okay.
Uh,
I'm all for it.

1078
01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.540
You don't see it as much in Singapore and then Denmark.
All right.
So,

1079
01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:37.680
<v 1>well you can,
you can write a letter.
I love Norway,</v>

1080
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:42.330
but I will,
I will,

1081
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:44.200
I will rely on national

1082
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:48.400
<v 2>geographic.
You can write them an angry letter.
Uh,
they are very communicative.</v>

1083
01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.650
That's fine.
So Norway,
awesome.

1084
01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:53.190
<v 1>But I can only speak,
I can only speak</v>

1085
01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:56.310
<v 2>to the dance,
but I will give you the official gold medal.</v>

1086
01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:00.690
But the silver medal for the dance.
And I want to point out a couple of things.

1087
01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:05.760
Knowing people in all three places that in Singapore there's very much an

1088
01:03:06.421 --> 01:03:09.720
optimization for improving your reality.

1089
01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:15.210
It's very achievement focused and there's a large economic component.

1090
01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:19.380
Nonetheless.
The various combination of factors lead them to be in the very top.

1091
01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:24.180
On the perhaps opposite side of that equation,
or at least in the alternate side,

1092
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:25.950
you have the Danes.

1093
01:03:25.951 --> 01:03:29.400
And I know a lot of Danes and I remember one point without even bringing up any

1094
01:03:29.401 --> 01:03:32.250
of this,
I said,
you guys are apparently really happy.

1095
01:03:32.251 --> 01:03:34.620
Why do you think that is as a group?

1096
01:03:34.621 --> 01:03:39.270
They said we have really low expectations.
I was like,

1097
01:03:39.271 --> 01:03:42.000
wow,
that's interesting.
Hmm.
I mean noodle on that.

1098
01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:45.930
And then I think Costa Rica's kind of squarely in the middle and a lot of

1099
01:03:45.931 --> 01:03:50.250
respects.
Uh,
so stuff to ponder work on both.

1100
01:03:50.251 --> 01:03:54.810
And also it just struck me that given all the talk about stoicism and so on,

1101
01:03:54.811 --> 01:03:58.860
that I tend to be people over the head with a stoicism in a lot of respects.

1102
01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:03.080
I would view as a complete philosophical system that checks a lot of boxes but

1103
01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:07.740
does focus quite a bit on refining your expectations and preparing for the worst

1104
01:04:07.741 --> 01:04:08.574
case scenario.

1105
01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:12.900
So I often had quite a healthy dose of epicureanism and so on,

1106
01:04:12.901 --> 01:04:16.740
which is more on the opposite side and any case,
Tim,

1107
01:04:16.741 --> 01:04:19.950
thank you so much and we're going to jump into some audience questions.

1108
01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:25.020
<v 1>[inaudible] definitely be doing</v>

1109
01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:32.920
<v 2>some individual Hellos,</v>

1110
01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:36.720
but we jump in and see what we have here.
And a,

1111
01:04:36.730 --> 01:04:40.780
I suspect there might be some curve balls slash bear traps that I don't want to

1112
01:04:40.781 --> 01:04:44.290
step into.
So let me see what we have here.
Bear with.

1113
01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:49.150
All right.
Uh,

1114
01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:54.000
you're 20 you have three to six months pre job post college.
All right,

1115
01:04:54.010 --> 01:04:57.430
I take that to me in three to six months after graduation to do whatever and no

1116
01:04:57.431 --> 01:05:00.700
financial social commitments.
And you've already read Tim's books.
All right,

1117
01:05:00.701 --> 01:05:01.534
thank you for that.

1118
01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:07.060
How do you spend your time to maximize well being and developed perspective

1119
01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:08.980
Amman from Paris,

1120
01:05:11.350 --> 01:05:14.770
wellbeing and develop perspective three to six months.

1121
01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:19.960
Now you may have already done this,
where's month?
It's money here.
Hey,

1122
01:05:19.961 --> 01:05:22.990
how's it going on?
All right,
so you may have already done this,
but if,

1123
01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:27.400
if I were giving advice to
the

1124
01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:31.420
normal American audience for that,

1125
01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:34.120
I would say travel for those three to six months.

1126
01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:36.070
Go to countries where you do not speak the language,

1127
01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:38.830
get deliberately lost in places that are safe,

1128
01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:43.860
perhaps like Japan or Costa Rica and most places and for wellbeing and

1129
01:05:45.401 --> 01:05:46.720
developing perspective,

1130
01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:52.500
wellbeing would me and deliberately exposing yourself to people who are worse

1131
01:05:53.321 --> 01:05:56.290
off.
Maybe at least financially than yourself.

1132
01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.130
So spending part of that time volunteering for instance,

1133
01:06:00.131 --> 01:06:03.550
and this three to six months and then that will simultaneously help you to

1134
01:06:03.551 --> 01:06:05.830
develop many,
many different perspectives.

1135
01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:11.670
That would be just as speaking as someone who's life was changed completely by a

1136
01:06:12.701 --> 01:06:14.290
number of overseas experiences,

1137
01:06:14.291 --> 01:06:19.291
which I had starting at age 16 or 17 I'd never really spent time outside of the

1138
01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:22.750
u s that would be my recommendation.
Tim,
do you have any other,

1139
01:06:23.290 --> 01:06:27.280
any other thoughts?
No,
I think that's right in line with what I would have said,

1140
01:06:27.281 --> 01:06:28.114
which is

1141
01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:30.610
<v 3>we basically traveling to me is like,</v>

1142
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:33.620
and that is another way to zoom out because you're just looking at your life

1143
01:06:33.621 --> 01:06:36.080
from far away.
You know?
It's like you don't,

1144
01:06:36.081 --> 01:06:37.970
you're not going there to look at your life,

1145
01:06:37.971 --> 01:06:41.270
but you ended up thinking about your life for some reason.
Being far away,

1146
01:06:41.271 --> 01:06:43.370
being out of your comfort zone and out of your element.

1147
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:47.150
You just have fresh eyes on your whole situation.
You can have this perspective.

1148
01:06:47.151 --> 01:06:47.541
You can kind of,

1149
01:06:47.541 --> 01:06:50.030
it's like going in a helicopter and looking at it from up there and a lot of

1150
01:06:50.031 --> 01:06:50.864
things make sense.

1151
01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:54.820
And then I would have also said couple that with like kind of like,
um,

1152
01:06:55.100 --> 01:07:00.000
a hard zoom in on like reality,
which is,
which I think you get from,
um,

1153
01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:03.320
I might've said like wait tables were construction,

1154
01:07:03.321 --> 01:07:07.690
just do something where you kind of like you're just around working people.
Um,

1155
01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:10.460
and you're just,
um,
I dunno,
it just,

1156
01:07:10.461 --> 01:07:14.780
it just just reminds you what like work is like,
what reality is like,

1157
01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:16.850
what adults you know,

1158
01:07:16.851 --> 01:07:19.520
go through and then that can like help you figure out where you're about to,

1159
01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.040
you know,
where you're about to be in what you want to do.
Yeah,
for sure.

1160
01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:26.240
<v 2>The travel advice,
I would not limit to someone just going to college.</v>

1161
01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:28.620
I think everybody when possible,

1162
01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:33.650
it shouldn't have that experience because the benefits outlast the trip because

1163
01:07:33.691 --> 01:07:35.160
what'll happen to most people,

1164
01:07:35.161 --> 01:07:38.490
especially if you put yourself in very foreign environments where perhaps you

1165
01:07:38.491 --> 01:07:42.480
can't even read what is written in Japan,
China,

1166
01:07:43.170 --> 01:07:46.230
many different examples,
right?
Whether it's Cyrillic,
Arabic doesn't matter,

1167
01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:51.420
I and you observe different customs.
What happened to me,

1168
01:07:51.421 --> 01:07:53.130
at least in Japan for instance,

1169
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:56.910
so my first real time abroad for a year as an exchange student,
the only

1170
01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:03.060
person who looks like this and a school uniform in a high school of 5,000

1171
01:08:03.061 --> 01:08:06.390
Japanese kids,
right?
Pretty easy where's Waldo game,

1172
01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:10.110
but I was like,
wait,
they drive on the other side of the street?

1173
01:08:10.290 --> 01:08:12.240
That doesn't make any sense.
Then I was like,
wait a second.

1174
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:14.160
Maybe we don't make any sense

1175
01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:19.070
what they take a shower before they get into the bathtub.
That doesn't make any,

1176
01:08:19.190 --> 01:08:19.761
wait a second.

1177
01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:24.650
That makes perfect sense and I got back and I realized how many rules we follow

1178
01:08:24.651 --> 01:08:28.430
are just made up.
They're just totally made up.

1179
01:08:28.610 --> 01:08:29.750
Very fragile,

1180
01:08:29.751 --> 01:08:34.100
socially reinforced illusions that we just reinforced and that's very liberating

1181
01:08:34.101 --> 01:08:35.090
because you realize,
wait a minute,

1182
01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:39.530
like if all of these different cultures do things differently,

1183
01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:45.500
maybe I don't have to go there to do things differently.
I can do that here.

1184
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:49.520
Then you start to really question assumptions and you become,
in my experience,

1185
01:08:49.521 --> 01:08:52.220
more experimental.
All right.
Let's go to

1186
01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:54.650
another question.

1187
01:09:00.050 --> 01:09:04.340
What trends,
industries,
topics are you most excited about right now?

1188
01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:07.970
Patrick?
Patrick,
is Patrick here?

1189
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:12.530
Hey Bedrick all right.
I like that.
Hi.
Tim.
Applies to both of us.

1190
01:09:12.570 --> 01:09:15.530
Simplifies matters.
Uh,
what trends,
industries,

1191
01:09:15.531 --> 01:09:19.580
topics am I most excited about right now?
Uh,
speaking for myself,

1192
01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:24.650
trends.
I'm not watching very closely.
Uh,

1193
01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:30.470
like I have trouble explaining why really I suppose I'm not trying to capitalize

1194
01:09:30.471 --> 01:09:35.471
on any trends because I feel like particularly having left Silicon Valley and

1195
01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:40.070
having moved to Austin,
which I love on almost every level,

1196
01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:45.890
if I'm spotting trends that I hope to capitalize on,
by the time you see it,

1197
01:09:45.891 --> 01:09:48.860
you're too late,
generally speaking.

1198
01:09:48.861 --> 01:09:52.850
So I'm not paying a lot of attention to trends,
industries.
Uh,

1199
01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:58.180
I am interested just almost from an academic standpoint in space travel,

1200
01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:04.530
not so much from a personal experiential standpoint,

1201
01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:09.580
but specifically looking at inhabiting planets versus building space stations.

1202
01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:17.380
That debate is interesting to me because you have some of the smartest humans

1203
01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:23.150
last 5,000 years,
arguably with very,
very different viewpoints.

1204
01:10:23.151 --> 01:10:26.520
And whenever that happens in any field,
I'm really interested.
Uh,

1205
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:30.200
you see that quite a few places,
topics I would say,

1206
01:10:31.230 --> 01:10:34.520
uh,
and this might be considered a trend.

1207
01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:39.580
I'm hoping to turn it into a trend which would be scientific research using

1208
01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:44.720
current cutting edge technologies to re-examine,
uh,

1209
01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:47.020
both psychedelics end Mtma,

1210
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:52.030
which I wouldn't strictly consider the traditional sense of psychedelic for

1211
01:10:52.101 --> 01:10:55.340
applications to very debilitating,

1212
01:10:55.341 --> 01:11:00.341
serious conditions ranging from PTSD to resist treatment resistant depression,

1213
01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:03.590
end of life,
anxiety and so forth.

1214
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:07.650
So I've taken most of my energy and capital that went into startups and

1215
01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:11.300
redirecting that to the scientific research at Johns Hopkins.

1216
01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:12.920
Hopefully other places like UCF,

1217
01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:18.080
Nyu also that are taking these compounds that have been used very,

1218
01:11:20.551 --> 01:11:21.390
very wisely,

1219
01:11:21.391 --> 01:11:26.391
I think in certain contexts for Millennia by various civilizations and uh,

1220
01:11:28.530 --> 01:11:32.280
applying a scientific lens to understand the mechanisms of action and the risks

1221
01:11:32.281 --> 01:11:33.240
involved quite frankly,

1222
01:11:33.241 --> 01:11:38.241
but how they can be less politicized and stigmatized for unscientific reasons

1223
01:11:38.551 --> 01:11:41.310
and examined so that we have a better understanding of why they do what they do,

1224
01:11:41.311 --> 01:11:45.300
which can be pretty incredible.
What about you,
trends,
industries,

1225
01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:48.510
topics that you're excited about right now?
Um,

1226
01:11:48.670 --> 01:11:50.170
<v 3>definitely some of those,
uh,</v>

1227
01:11:50.290 --> 01:11:55.290
agree with you on getting the stigma off of a prospective altering drugs.

1228
01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.970
But,
um,
I would,
uh,
I would also add,
um,

1229
01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:02.710
there's a lot of cool things going on and what the field but also has this

1230
01:12:02.711 --> 01:12:07.000
stigma called life extension and the stigma is that it just seems like it's
like,

1231
01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:10.000
you know,
narcissistic,
rich white guys and want to live forever.

1232
01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.250
But the truth is it's a,

1233
01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:15.190
and people think it's vain and narcissistic kind of thing,

1234
01:12:15.191 --> 01:12:18.910
but really what you could just reframe it as it's,

1235
01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:23.560
if you just cure or learn how to manage like the four things that kill people

1236
01:12:23.561 --> 01:12:27.550
basically,
which is like heart disease,
stroke,
Alzheimer's,
cancer.

1237
01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:31.930
Um,
it just means that like [inaudible] and other things going on in health,

1238
01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:36.931
like we can just live a lot longer and higher quality later years.

1239
01:12:37.570 --> 01:12:38.680
Like who doesn't want that?

1240
01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:41.470
It's this like knee jerk reaction that that makes people not even want to put

1241
01:12:41.471 --> 01:12:43.000
money your time into this industry.

1242
01:12:43.330 --> 01:12:47.590
But like I just feel like there were definitely people back when humans lived on

1243
01:12:47.591 --> 01:12:49.900
average to 40.
You know,
it would have been like,
oh,

1244
01:12:49.901 --> 01:12:52.910
did deck the 40 is the lot of man like living to 80 yourself.

1245
01:12:52.911 --> 01:12:55.690
But like now we're all happy about that.
No one wants to go back.

1246
01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.780
So if suddenly,
you know,
I dunno,

1247
01:12:58.781 --> 01:13:03.370
one 41 40 was the new 90 and 90 was the new 50.
Like,

1248
01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:07.200
who's not happy about that?
Like,
so,
uh,
you know,
we always say,
oh look,

1249
01:13:07.201 --> 01:13:08.800
cause you know,
at that point you're done.

1250
01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:10.660
We'll demo Lance's cause we got used to that.

1251
01:13:10.661 --> 01:13:13.690
We're managing our own expectations.
If we all died at 35,
I would be like,

1252
01:13:13.691 --> 01:13:15.040
well it's been good.

1253
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:19.000
But like I'm not that I'm all ambitious and exciting because I think I have more

1254
01:13:19.001 --> 01:13:22.960
decades.
So,
um,
I think that,
uh,
there's a lot going on.

1255
01:13:22.961 --> 01:13:25.500
Mark Zuckerberg and his wife and our program,
you know,

1256
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:29.680
one of the teams that are trying to cure all diseases by the end of the century.

1257
01:13:29.681 --> 01:13:33.850
Like this is just a machine and the diseases are just a glitch inside of the

1258
01:13:33.851 --> 01:13:36.250
machine.
Like,
if we can have,
you know,

1259
01:13:36.251 --> 01:13:40.390
enough nanotech and really fancy AI and um,
you know,
medicine,
you know,

1260
01:13:40.391 --> 01:13:42.820
and everything we can,
we can go in there and fix it.

1261
01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:44.680
This is a fantastic development.

1262
01:13:45.010 --> 01:13:48.730
The most heartbreaking thing is someone you know that you love dying especially

1263
01:13:48.731 --> 01:13:52.840
early.
Uh,
let's work on that.
So I think there's a lot going on there,

1264
01:13:52.841 --> 01:13:56.950
but I think that a lot more would be going on if the stigma of this as kind of

1265
01:13:56.951 --> 01:14:01.390
like a narcissistic pursuit would just go away.
Yeah.
To,

1266
01:14:01.450 --> 01:14:06.100
to come in on one thing there in terms of the,
the narcissistic rich people,
you,

1267
01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:11.140
everyone should want the narcissistic millionaires and billionaires to spend

1268
01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:12.280
much money as possible

1269
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:14.080
<v 2>on this,
right?</v>

1270
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:18.280
You want them to be the people who create the economies of scale for everybody

1271
01:14:18.281 --> 01:14:21.070
else.
And many of the things we take for granted now,

1272
01:14:21.071 --> 01:14:26.071
like recycling started off being very hoity toity affluence experiments and,

1273
01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:27.161
and you,

1274
01:14:27.161 --> 01:14:32.050
you want them to be spending millions of dollars on something then 10 years

1275
01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:36.610
going to be available for $50 a month.
Yes.
Plumbing,
like in sanitation,

1276
01:14:36.611 --> 01:14:39.190
these things are all rich,
rich people things for awhile.

1277
01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:41.830
And like then everyone benefits tremendously from them.

1278
01:14:41.831 --> 01:14:43.960
So like people also get mad.
They think,
oh and this is,

1279
01:14:43.961 --> 01:14:46.010
well this is just going to benefit like the rich.

1280
01:14:46.011 --> 01:14:49.330
It's this unfair thing where like super rich people will be able to live longer

1281
01:14:49.331 --> 01:14:50.800
and it's like,
yeah,
for a while.

1282
01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:53.800
And then it trickles to everybody cause the cost comes down as we get better.

1283
01:14:53.801 --> 01:14:58.040
So like get over it,
you know,
on that note,
yeah.

1284
01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:02.830
Uh,
if you want to read some,

1285
01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:06.490
I think very interesting thinking related to what might account to life

1286
01:15:06.491 --> 01:15:08.080
extension or at least death prevention.

1287
01:15:08.081 --> 01:15:12.370
Doctor Peter a tia is willing to pay attention to one of my favorite people.

1288
01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:14.860
Uh,
Eh,

1289
01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:19.090
what is the name of the city everyone must visit before they die?

1290
01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:22.390
Thanks for everything.
Steve.
Steve Grill.

1291
01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:28.070
Not to be confused with Steve Carell.
This ca.
Yeah,

1292
01:15:28.071 --> 01:15:32.590
it was a great name.
It's a great name.
Spelled differently.
Uh,

1293
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:34.210
I on my list,

1294
01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:39.360
I would have to go with Tokyo because it has such an unusual combination of

1295
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:44.500
safety,
cleanliness,

1296
01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:49.530
extreme weirdness and incomprehensibility even to someone who speaks to and haze

1297
01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:57.040
that it provides a really unite,
a unique,

1298
01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:00.430
I think I just used that twice and I'm going to get shipped from friends who

1299
01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:03.520
love to heckle me for using modifiers on unique.
They're like,
no,

1300
01:16:03.521 --> 01:16:05.860
there's no such thing as very unique like,
okay,
alright,
alright.

1301
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:08.920
I'm going to say it again.
Just annoy them.

1302
01:16:08.921 --> 01:16:13.921
It's a very unique opportunity to feel extreme discomfort and confusion with

1303
01:16:16.541 --> 01:16:21.250
elation with next to no real harmful consequences.

1304
01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:26.340
So I think that provides an awesome learning opportunity and just a fun trip.

1305
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:31.170
So I would say,
I would say Tokyo is very high on the list.
Right?

1306
01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:32.740
You still my answer again,

1307
01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:36.330
I was just in Japan all summer and the sun,

1308
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:39.460
it's like going to another planet and you're like,
oh,
how did,

1309
01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:43.150
how did this civilization live?
And you're on another planet.

1310
01:16:43.151 --> 01:16:47.200
That's how different it is.
And just isolated western culture has like,
you know,

1311
01:16:47.310 --> 01:16:51.280
infiltrated so many places and it just hasn't really there and they just have

1312
01:16:51.281 --> 01:16:54.190
done everything their own way.
And so you're like,
how does the cab door open?
Oh,

1313
01:16:54.191 --> 01:16:58.720
it opens by itself.
Then I get in and it closes by itself.
That's really cool.

1314
01:16:58.721 --> 01:17:03.370
So I had to give a different answer.
I'll say,
um,
Hanoi,

1315
01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.240
Vietnam,

1316
01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:09.100
just because crossing the street is just crazy.

1317
01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:09.973
So there's like

1318
01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:12.710
<v 3>bites just like motorbikes,</v>

1319
01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:16.670
just a sea of a sea of them going by and there's no stop lights and it doesn't

1320
01:17:16.671 --> 01:17:21.610
stop.
And what you do is it walkers,
you just walk.
It's like,

1321
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:24.920
it's like Indiana Jones,
like walking over the thing.
Um,
you,

1322
01:17:24.921 --> 01:17:29.350
you just walk and you just,
and they figure it out and,

1323
01:17:31.050 --> 01:17:32.720
and it's unbelievable.

1324
01:17:32.721 --> 01:17:35.300
It's like you feel like you're like God walking on water or something.

1325
01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:38.000
Were you just like,
you're just like walk out and nothing happens,

1326
01:17:38.001 --> 01:17:39.440
but the thing you don't want to do is like,

1327
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:42.210
we have freaked out towards that like stops cause then,
then the,

1328
01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.300
then you're doing it.
It's something they can't anticipate,

1329
01:17:44.301 --> 01:17:45.710
but you got to try this time.

1330
01:17:47.190 --> 01:17:51.330
<v 2>Steady.
Well based strides.
Competent,
yes.</v>

1331
01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:01.710
<v 3>Yeah.
All right.
Is it the same there?
I didn't go down there.</v>

1332
01:18:03.610 --> 01:18:05.210
He spent some time in coaching then

1333
01:18:05.790 --> 01:18:06.920
<v 4>I was actually trying.</v>

1334
01:18:11.130 --> 01:18:15.000
<v 2>Yeah,
go with the flow or else you die.
Good,
good advice.</v>

1335
01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:19.170
Thank goodness.
All right.

1336
01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:22.260
That one would take us both several hours knowing the two of us.

1337
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:28.580
I apologize to the person whose name I will not read.
Uh,

1338
01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:32.070
alright dear Tim,

1339
01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:36.600
that applies both of us regarding two crappy pages per day.

1340
01:18:36.601 --> 01:18:37.530
I'll explain what that means.

1341
01:18:37.531 --> 01:18:41.520
How do you structure your days and weeks when you are working on a book?

1342
01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:47.040
Thanks Jean or Jeannie.
I'm not sure if the,
all right,

1343
01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:50.190
I'll,
I'll go with [inaudible] both.

1344
01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:55.560
I wasn't sure how to respond.
All right,

1345
01:18:55.561 --> 01:18:58.680
so the two crappy pages per day for those who don't know was advice that I

1346
01:18:58.681 --> 01:19:01.790
received,
I received regarding writing and working on a book,

1347
01:19:01.791 --> 01:19:06.200
which you can be in my personal experience,
a very daunting,

1348
01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:11.440
intimidating task and I would get frozen for days or weeks and I'd try to write

1349
01:19:11.511 --> 01:19:13.460
something.
It wouldn't be perfect and I'd throw it out.

1350
01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:19.030
And at a mentor of mine or an author I knew said your quota should be two crappy

1351
01:19:21.891 --> 01:19:22.724
pages per day.

1352
01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:26.750
And he told me the story about IBM and how they demolish the competition by

1353
01:19:26.751 --> 01:19:31.751
exceeding every sales quota every quarter and just absolutely steamrolling

1354
01:19:32.541 --> 01:19:36.890
everyone for a long time.
And he asked me,
do you know why that is?
And I said No.

1355
01:19:36.891 --> 01:19:37.320
And he said,

1356
01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:41.960
because of the quotas were low and then people were unintimidated to pick up the

1357
01:19:41.961 --> 01:19:45.300
phone to make the calls.
Uh,

1358
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:48.500
and you can do the same thing with yourself with writing.

1359
01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:53.930
And you do that by making your bar for a successful day,

1360
01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:57.080
two crappy pages.
That's it.
Even if you throw them both out,
you never use them.

1361
01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:59.380
You've won the day if you have to copy pages.

1362
01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:02.930
And of course over time there are days when you just get your two crappy pages

1363
01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:04.610
and they are really truly terrible.

1364
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:06.500
And then there are other days where you overshoot,

1365
01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:09.150
you're in the flow and you get 10 1520 pages.

1366
01:20:09.450 --> 01:20:13.500
You don't need so many of those to eventually put together what can become a

1367
01:20:13.501 --> 01:20:17.940
button in terms of structuring my days and so on.
Uh,
I'll,

1368
01:20:17.950 --> 01:20:18.661
I'll be super,

1369
01:20:18.661 --> 01:20:23.661
super specific here because the weeks and months basically look identical and

1370
01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:27.630
it's just copy and paste of this particular day.

1371
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:32.990
I realized for myself that I benefit greatly given historical predisposition to

1372
01:20:33.661 --> 01:20:38.250
bipolar and all of these various things.
It's just written in my code.
Uh,

1373
01:20:38.930 --> 01:20:42.150
it's a whole separate story.
But yeah,
it's kind of laughable.

1374
01:20:42.151 --> 01:20:47.151
And how it predisposed my family has that writing your sunshine is really

1375
01:20:47.761 --> 01:20:48.594
important.

1376
01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:53.600
So I write books generally during summer months and my day involves getting up

1377
01:20:56.070 --> 01:21:00.780
not super early,
but for me it was respect respectably early,

1378
01:21:00.781 --> 01:21:05.781
which would mean say 9:00 AM nine 30 before the sun is setting and I wake up,

1379
01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:11.610
I meditate for 20 to 22 minutes.

1380
01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:15.420
It should be typically transcendental meditation or some type of guided

1381
01:21:15.421 --> 01:21:16.254
meditation.

1382
01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:20.640
Then I jumped in the water because I'm on Lake Long Island and jump in the water

1383
01:21:20.641 --> 01:21:24.270
to wake up.
I might do a little bit of swimming.
I hop out.

1384
01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:27.240
I already have pages from the night before that I want to edit.

1385
01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:31.470
I will edit during the day,
but I,
I do my pros generation at night.

1386
01:21:31.471 --> 01:21:35.550
That's just when I have the best output.
But I can edit,

1387
01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:39.360
do that grunt work during the day.
I have printed out pages.

1388
01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:41.190
I will go into a sauna,

1389
01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:44.610
which requires all sorts of trickery because you start sweating on the pages,

1390
01:21:44.611 --> 01:21:48.720
but go into a sauna and I will hand edit those pages.

1391
01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:51.570
Then I come out,
take a quick shower.

1392
01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:56.580
I have a very small breakfast of some time,
typically say macadamia nuts,

1393
01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.620
some eggs.
Very,

1394
01:21:58.621 --> 01:22:03.621
very small and I continue to work very often at a treadmill desk and the

1395
01:22:04.711 --> 01:22:09.600
treadmill desk works during this period of time at a very slow pace because say

1396
01:22:09.601 --> 01:22:12.930
in the case of tribe of mentors,
I'm handling outreach and editing.

1397
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:17.910
I'm not going to do comp it original drafts and composition at the treadmill

1398
01:22:17.911 --> 01:22:21.870
desk.
Uh,
I will work at the treadmill desk.

1399
01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:25.980
This is literally the exact day and this one would take hours to explain it.

1400
01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:31.340
Then around say noon or 1:00 PM hop on a bike with a researcher or someone that

1401
01:22:34.381 --> 01:22:38.250
I have hired to be with me in the same house at all times.

1402
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:43.590
Why is this important?
I realized that writing is very isolating for me and it,

1403
01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:48.880
it can catalyze a lot of negative mental states and downward spirals because I

1404
01:22:49.771 --> 01:22:54.771
feel alone so I have someone physically there even though we could probably do

1405
01:22:54.871 --> 01:22:58.020
the work remotely,
they have to be optimistic,

1406
01:22:58.021 --> 01:23:03.000
which fortunately my researcher is everything to him.
His hand clapping.
Amazing.

1407
01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:08.710
Really good influence have around.
So we both get on a bike,

1408
01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:10.320
so you'll notice there are there,
there's,

1409
01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:14.710
there are little bursts of physical exercise inserted in the day,
get on bikes,

1410
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:19.950
ride to this very mediocre Deli and we have Mediterranean raps every day

1411
01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:27.790
for those interested it is whole wheat tortilla with chicken,
hummus,

1412
01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:31.900
tomato,
Avocado added,
always extra cost

1413
01:23:33.730 --> 01:23:38.730
and we eat our Mediterranean wraps and I have unsweetened ice tea plus sparkling

1414
01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:44.250
water and we work there until say five or six sun starts to set,

1415
01:23:45.581 --> 01:23:49.750
jump on the bikes,
sometimes head to the bay,
jump in the water again,

1416
01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:54.610
head home,
uh,
and then have a snack,

1417
01:23:55.210 --> 01:23:57.820
work for an additional two or three hours,
then go to dinner.

1418
01:23:57.850 --> 01:24:00.640
There are two or three restaurants that we go to.
That's it.

1419
01:24:01.090 --> 01:24:05.710
Those are the rotations.
And for all of these restaurants will give a pro tip.

1420
01:24:06.010 --> 01:24:09.010
Jesus with a long answer that I said wasn't getting along.
All right,

1421
01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:12.910
pro tip for people who might want to do this.
Now it's late.
We're going out late,

1422
01:24:12.911 --> 01:24:14.260
rubbing dinner at nine o'clock.

1423
01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:17.440
A lot of these kitchens closed and say nine 30 10,
what does that mean?

1424
01:24:17.441 --> 01:24:19.120
Staff's going to be fucking pissed.

1425
01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:22.540
They were coming in right as the doors about to close.

1426
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:26.530
And I know this because I worked in service jobs as busboys and waiter in

1427
01:24:26.531 --> 01:24:31.510
restaurants forever.
I get it.
So here's what you do.
You have three restaurants,

1428
01:24:31.511 --> 01:24:34.660
you know you're going to be going to them for a few weeks or few months.

1429
01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.870
You go to the same restaurant for dinner three nights in a row,

1430
01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:41.140
and then the next restaurant,
same place,
three nights in a row,

1431
01:24:41.170 --> 01:24:46.170
each night you buy rounds of Tequila over and over again.

1432
01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:49.090
For every person who works in the restaurant,

1433
01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:52.450
front of House and back of house,
really important.

1434
01:24:53.230 --> 01:24:58.230
These people will now love you and they will let you hang out for an extra hour,

1435
01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:03.550
hour and a half.
This is really key.
Uh,
okay.
So we do this,
then we go home,

1436
01:25:03.610 --> 01:25:07.100
not too much to Cuba and uh,

1437
01:25:07.150 --> 01:25:10.510
will continue to prepare things for the next day.

1438
01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:13.870
Go to bed around 1:00 AM say,

1439
01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:18.130
and then it's groundhog day over and over again.
That's it.

1440
01:25:18.670 --> 01:25:22.150
And there are very often,
I would say every other day,

1441
01:25:22.590 --> 01:25:26.470
some type of a kettlebell swings or exercise that has done immediately before

1442
01:25:26.471 --> 01:25:30.400
leaving to dinner.
And it's just that day over and over and over again.

1443
01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:35.490
Yes.
I see your raised hands from yes,
Joanne.
Yeah.

1444
01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.500
Genie.
Goddammit.
Sorry,

1445
01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:44.670
<v 5>when you were having the Mediterranean racks.</v>

1446
01:25:47.330 --> 01:25:50.340
<v 2>Oh yes,
yes,
yes.
So important to clarify and question.</v>

1447
01:25:50.341 --> 01:25:51.680
Do I work where we have lunch?
Yes.

1448
01:25:51.681 --> 01:25:56.360
Their outdoor picnic tables and we will sit down and work outside.

1449
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:58.570
That's actually a fairly key point,

1450
01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:02.240
but you have to have a high tolerance for mosquitoes and ticks because it's

1451
01:26:02.241 --> 01:26:03.140
eastern long island.

1452
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:07.680
So caveat emptor on the Lyme disease or uh,

1453
01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:09.013
Tim,

1454
01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:16.650
<v 3>um,
if you take the opposite of that answer,</v>

1455
01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:22.510
I think there's 16 hours a week is like a,
a morphous Wad and self loving.

1456
01:26:25.390 --> 01:26:27.770
It's basically someone asks me that would be like,
what do you,

1457
01:26:27.930 --> 01:26:30.570
what do you need with your work?
What do you do?
And I was like,

1458
01:26:30.571 --> 01:26:35.571
I need to know that will follow me around and like shock me if I'm not working

1459
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:38.730
and like,
wait,
I'm supposed to be working.
And they were kind of like,

1460
01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:42.870
that was kind of,
but,
um,
I,
uh,
yeah,
no,
no.
I mean,

1461
01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:45.900
I mean this is what you're awesome at and what I admire you for an eye.

1462
01:26:45.901 --> 01:26:48.500
You can also,
just to be clear,
have really regimented,

1463
01:26:48.510 --> 01:26:52.020
well-structured self-loathing just to make that clear.
Continue.

1464
01:26:52.021 --> 01:26:54.660
But I was like trying to memorize it,
that answer because I want to like,

1465
01:26:54.661 --> 01:26:59.500
I think for me,
the times when I am being productive,
um,
I find that it,

1466
01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:00.990
the two days of the two minutes,

1467
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.910
a two pages a day thing resonates with me because for me it's like if I get in

1468
01:27:05.911 --> 01:27:08.730
my by,
by problem when I'm not being productive is that I had this in my head.

1469
01:27:08.730 --> 01:27:11.640
I'm behind on my stuff.
So I need to work 14 hours.

1470
01:27:11.641 --> 01:27:14.110
I need 14 hours of writing today.
Um,

1471
01:27:14.130 --> 01:27:18.090
and I have done those crazy hours when there like a crazy panic in my life.
So I,

1472
01:27:18.091 --> 01:27:21.900
I know I can.
So I think I can,
but without the panic it never happens.

1473
01:27:21.930 --> 01:27:24.960
And then six hours into the day,
I've already blown it.

1474
01:27:25.050 --> 01:27:26.100
I've already blown the day.

1475
01:27:26.101 --> 01:27:29.040
And you get discouraged and then you start to self fulfilling prophecy yourself.

1476
01:27:29.041 --> 01:27:29.940
That of course I'm going to blow it.

1477
01:27:29.941 --> 01:27:33.800
I blew the last three days and then so if I do the same thing,

1478
01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:36.870
I say I'm going to write three hours today and then I've had a successful day.

1479
01:27:36.871 --> 01:27:37.441
It's amazing.

1480
01:27:37.441 --> 01:27:42.420
All the positive like reward pathway feedback that comes in from feeling like

1481
01:27:42.421 --> 01:27:44.820
you succeeded that day.
Um,

1482
01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:48.360
and then that night you can go to bed on time because I already succeeded today

1483
01:27:48.361 --> 01:27:50.070
as opposed to thinking,
no,
I can't go to bed now.

1484
01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:53.880
I can't like let this be the the whole day I didn't and that can feed on itself.

1485
01:27:53.881 --> 01:27:58.680
And something I try to remind myself is someone who is three,

1486
01:27:58.681 --> 01:27:59.820
three hours of writing,

1487
01:27:59.821 --> 01:28:03.780
five days a week but really focused like phone is away like deep,

1488
01:28:03.810 --> 01:28:08.010
deep focus writing 15 hours a week.
Like it's shocking how much you can produce.

1489
01:28:08.011 --> 01:28:11.370
Like add those weeks together.
40 weeks later you have a book,
right?

1490
01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:15.650
The difference between the prolific writer and the person does self-loathing

1491
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:20.750
person who doesn't write anything is one does 15 hours a week out of their

1492
01:28:21.481 --> 01:28:26.100
hundred and 12 Weking hours a week writing and the other one does zero to 112

1493
01:28:26.101 --> 01:28:30.030
waking hours.
So one seven versus zero sevens six seven.

1494
01:28:30.031 --> 01:28:34.470
So those two people's days and lines are the same.
I mean,
it is.
So people go,

1495
01:28:34.471 --> 01:28:35.880
people who can put something together,

1496
01:28:35.950 --> 01:28:39.030
they have this daunting kind of assumption that the prolific writers

1497
01:28:39.210 --> 01:28:41.190
fundamentally different.
They're just,
they just had,

1498
01:28:41.191 --> 01:28:44.850
they're working constantly all the time.
Um,
it doesn't have to be that way,

1499
01:28:44.851 --> 01:28:47.010
but it's the consistency.
It is the IBM thing.

1500
01:28:48.370 --> 01:28:51.250
<v 2>I have never thought about it that way.
That's a really great way to put it.</v>

1501
01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:53.760
So true too.
I mean,
most,
most,

1502
01:28:55.650 --> 01:29:00.650
most writers I know spend the majority of their time inventing things to,

1503
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:06.030
to avoid writing.
But my,
my plants dying.
There's,

1504
01:29:06.031 --> 01:29:10.620
there's really no way that I could possibly,
Winston needs another massage.
Yeah,

1505
01:29:10.621 --> 01:29:12.780
I am.
And this is an unconstructive environment.

1506
01:29:12.781 --> 01:29:15.330
The writing's not going to be high quality if I don't Polish my tennis shoes.

1507
01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:18.510
And so on a very,
very pure,
I,

1508
01:29:18.511 --> 01:29:23.190
this will be the last question and then we'll move on to the next phase of this

1509
01:29:23.190 --> 01:29:25.950
evening.
Uh,
what experiments,
questions,

1510
01:29:25.951 --> 01:29:28.170
hypotheses are you wrestling with right now?

1511
01:29:28.171 --> 01:29:30.750
How have they changed over your life?
Where do you think they'll take you?
Now?

1512
01:29:30.751 --> 01:29:34.770
We may not have a chance to hit every aspect of this,

1513
01:29:34.771 --> 01:29:39.630
but let's,
let's start with what experiments,

1514
01:29:39.631 --> 01:29:42.450
questions,
hypotheses.
It's,
let's start with you telling shit.

1515
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:46.980
So nice having his answer.
What experiments,

1516
01:29:46.981 --> 01:29:51.570
questions or hypotheses are you wrestling with right now?
And then let's,

1517
01:29:51.571 --> 01:29:53.640
I'm just going to approach this and go do,

1518
01:29:53.641 --> 01:29:55.920
where do you think they might take you?

1519
01:29:58.390 --> 01:30:02.170
<v 3>Well,
it's a little like my last answer.
I am trying to,</v>

1520
01:30:02.590 --> 01:30:05.700
so my mind is structured,
uh,

1521
01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:09.280
as I explained in the Ted talk,
you mentioned,
um,
with,
there's the,

1522
01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:12.120
there's three characters,
there's the rational decision maker who's like,

1523
01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:16.300
she would help me work right now it's 10:00 AM it's,
you know,
on a Wednesday,

1524
01:30:16.301 --> 01:30:21.090
a very good time to work.
Then there's the,
the,
the,

1525
01:30:21.091 --> 01:30:26.080
the,
his pets,
the instinct gratification monkey who uh,
he does not,

1526
01:30:26.081 --> 01:30:27.280
he has a different idea,

1527
01:30:27.281 --> 01:30:30.310
is a different idea of what 10:00 AM on Wednesday is good for.

1528
01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:31.830
And then there's a,

1529
01:30:31.831 --> 01:30:35.620
and the two of them go back and forth and the instant gratification monkey wins

1530
01:30:35.621 --> 01:30:36.454
every single time,

1531
01:30:36.490 --> 01:30:39.670
which leaves me and what I call the dark playground where I'm like not working

1532
01:30:39.671 --> 01:30:42.850
but I'm supposed to be.
Um,
and the only thing,

1533
01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:46.630
the only thing that breaks that cycle is the third character who suddenly wakes

1534
01:30:46.631 --> 01:30:49.930
up when a deadline gets closer or there's some external pressure that's the

1535
01:30:49.931 --> 01:30:54.520
panic monster and the panic monster freaks the monkey out.

1536
01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:55.720
The only thing the monkey scared of,

1537
01:30:55.721 --> 01:31:00.100
he runs away and I can get my thing done and I'm going to die at 45.

1538
01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:04.060
Um,
and what I'm trying to learn how to do,

1539
01:31:04.061 --> 01:31:07.000
especially since I'm about to start my first book next year,
so I like,

1540
01:31:07.030 --> 01:31:11.860
you've done 52 books.
I need to like learn from.
This man is like,
you know,

1541
01:31:11.861 --> 01:31:15.430
a book is too big a project.
You can't just do that all at once.
I,
it's like,

1542
01:31:15.490 --> 01:31:19.680
it's like at some point you have to learn how to have this internal,
uh,

1543
01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:23.590
motivation.
And for me,
I'm like,
uh,
you know,
a caricature of myself,

1544
01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:26.440
but there's a lot of people in this room who maybe aren't classic

1545
01:31:26.441 --> 01:31:30.420
procrastinators,
but,
uh,
without realizing it,

1546
01:31:30.421 --> 01:31:31.870
if there's no kind of deadline,

1547
01:31:31.871 --> 01:31:35.440
even if they're not down to the wire with the deadline,

1548
01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:40.270
the deadline itself,
just being there is what makes them do stuff.

1549
01:31:40.330 --> 01:31:41.860
And that's dangerous.
Um,

1550
01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:45.520
because actually a lot of what's really important in life is that kind of

1551
01:31:45.521 --> 01:31:48.190
important but not urgent stuff.
The stuff that doesn't have the deadlines,

1552
01:31:48.191 --> 01:31:51.430
seeing your friends and family and not fuck changing careers,

1553
01:31:51.490 --> 01:31:54.670
improving yourself in the long run.
So I think like this whole,

1554
01:31:54.671 --> 01:31:58.930
these three characters thing applies to a lot of people,
applies very much to me.

1555
01:31:58.931 --> 01:32:02.550
So I'm working on is trying to,
just really,
really working on,
uh,

1556
01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:05.630
having productive days,
uh,

1557
01:32:05.890 --> 01:32:07.720
with nothing in the external world,

1558
01:32:07.721 --> 01:32:11.910
making me because a child is not good at that.
And I,

1559
01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:15.160
I trying to be,
uh,
less of a child.

1560
01:32:15.890 --> 01:32:19.550
<v 2>That's my goal for the next year.
Yeah.</v>

1561
01:32:20.530 --> 01:32:25.400
I empathize.
I do.
I do.

1562
01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:30.140
I do.
I do,
uh,
most productive person in the history of,

1563
01:32:30.141 --> 01:32:34.190
no,
I'm just really good at showing like the high,
right,
the high,
right.
Well,

1564
01:32:34.191 --> 01:32:35.480
I got really super,

1565
01:32:35.481 --> 01:32:38.390
when I get tired this is going to give me an all sorts of trouble.
I actually,

1566
01:32:38.391 --> 01:32:41.330
after spending a year only speaking Japanese,
when I get really tired,

1567
01:32:41.331 --> 01:32:45.980
I start to mix up my in my house.
I'm not shitting you.
Wow.

1568
01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:50.900
You speak Japanese.
Yeah.
That's so cool.
Yeah,
it's a cool language.
Uh,
so,

1569
01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:55.400
and just so you guys know,
I'm just going to digress for a second.
In Japanese,

1570
01:32:55.401 --> 01:32:59.660
they have naughty duty though they have a syllabus and the our l and d sounds

1571
01:32:59.661 --> 01:33:00.770
are kind of combined into one thing.

1572
01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:03.170
That's why they're not aware of the distinction.

1573
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:06.620
They kinda got screwed when God was handing out phonemes that didn't get a lot

1574
01:33:06.621 --> 01:33:08.950
of sounds.
It's really hard for them to learn other languages,

1575
01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:11.040
but of a rip off for them.
But,
uh,

1576
01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:15.620
I'm showing the highlight reel of like a very mediocre movie.

1577
01:33:16.130 --> 01:33:16.950
So I'm getting,

1578
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:21.410
it creates the illusion that I'm just knocking out productivity all day,

1579
01:33:21.650 --> 01:33:23.630
not the case.
Which is why when people are like,

1580
01:33:23.631 --> 01:33:25.670
can we follow you around for a day?
I'm like,
no,
absolutely not.

1581
01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:29.930
Naturally not because you'd just be like,
are you going to do something

1582
01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:35.060
though man?
I'm like,
I found some lint in the carpet and I need to fix this.

1583
01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:41.400
Not a good like dances with wolves experience for the documentary film goer.
Uh,

1584
01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:42.630
all right,
so what experience questions,

1585
01:33:42.650 --> 01:33:44.450
hypotheses in my wrestling with right now,

1586
01:33:44.810 --> 01:33:48.530
I'm going to make this maybe a little soft around the edges,

1587
01:33:49.010 --> 01:33:53.650
which is not my style tip events like hard analytical,
quantitative,
uh,

1588
01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:55.940
but whatever.
Uh,

1589
01:33:55.941 --> 01:34:00.941
so I've spent the vast majority of my life at best tolerating myself.

1590
01:34:03.050 --> 01:34:05.450
It's true.
Uh,
had had some,

1591
01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:11.280
some really horrible experiences early on that led me to just decide sort of

1592
01:34:12.381 --> 01:34:13.760
self love is for other people.

1593
01:34:13.761 --> 01:34:15.950
I could be a really good instrument for competition though.

1594
01:34:16.130 --> 01:34:21.130
I get home myself into an instrument with a high pain tolerance to be really

1595
01:34:22.431 --> 01:34:24.440
good at certain things.
And that was enough.

1596
01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:29.450
And then I could get my joy or happiness where I found that from observing other

1597
01:34:29.451 --> 01:34:32.210
people,
long storytelling packed that fully.

1598
01:34:32.211 --> 01:34:37.211
But suffice to say like I accepted a really low level of self regard and it was

1599
01:34:37.551 --> 01:34:41.990
really,
really unforgiving.
The brutal with myself.
I mean I,

1600
01:34:41.991 --> 01:34:46.880
I talked to myself endlessly everyday we're talking about decades in a way that

1601
01:34:46.881 --> 01:34:48.260
I would never speak to another person.

1602
01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:54.160
And what I've realized in the last few months actually in particular is that if

1603
01:34:55.971 --> 01:35:00.971
you want to fully love other people and to make other people feel loved,

1604
01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:04.760
you can't get away with just tolerating yourself.

1605
01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:09.530
You cannot and you have to learn how to

1606
01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:13.070
forgive yourself for a lot.
Uh,

1607
01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:17.060
but more so than that for me at least is to have compassion for earlier versions

1608
01:35:17.061 --> 01:35:22.061
of yourself that you might view as cowardly or ashamed or week.

1609
01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:27.620
And uh,
I was introduced to that through something relatively new for me,

1610
01:35:27.621 --> 01:35:32.210
which is called Meta m e t t a or loving kindness meditation,

1611
01:35:32.211 --> 01:35:33.420
which sounds Super Woo.

1612
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:36.200
And I mean the 20 year old version of Tim would just be vomiting on his shoes

1613
01:35:36.201 --> 01:35:40.700
right now.
Hearing this like,
Oh my God,
you're embarrassing us.

1614
01:35:40.701 --> 01:35:41.540
Stop it.

1615
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:48.070
But it's been a really profound shift in my perspective and realizing that even

1616
01:35:48.651 --> 01:35:53.651
if my only goal is not necessarily to love myself but to do the greatest good I

1617
01:35:53.781 --> 01:35:56.630
can possibly do with my small amount of time on this planet,

1618
01:35:57.380 --> 01:36:01.460
that I have to put my on oxygen mask on first.

1619
01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:07.220
And that's something that comes up a lot and try to mentors Arianna Huffington,

1620
01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:08.180
Sharon Salzberg,

1621
01:36:08.181 --> 01:36:13.181
it comes up again and again and I just want everybody to realize this is part of

1622
01:36:13.371 --> 01:36:15.710
my,
I suppose,

1623
01:36:15.711 --> 01:36:20.711
new mission of sorts is for people to realize that if you're feeling damaged or

1624
01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:28.760
flawed and that leads you to be depressed and to have really,

1625
01:36:28.761 --> 01:36:33.761
really low amount of regard for yourself where you're really aggressively brutal

1626
01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:35.090
to yourself,

1627
01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:40.090
that the first thing to realize is that you are not alone in feeling that.

1628
01:36:41.630 --> 01:36:44.930
And in fact,
I certainly not everyone in this book,

1629
01:36:44.931 --> 01:36:49.850
but I would wager,
and this is just speculation in most cases,

1630
01:36:49.851 --> 01:36:51.860
but a very,
very high percentage

1631
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:58.750
have incredible demons and are fighting battles that we all know nothing about.

1632
01:36:59.630 --> 01:37:03.140
But I mean really with some very,
very dark periods.

1633
01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:08.690
So a,
is that you're not alone and B is that you can actually

1634
01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:14.360
let go of and repair almost all,

1635
01:37:14.361 --> 01:37:18.350
if not all of what you think you should just lock away and forget.

1636
01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:24.700
So that I suppose would be what I am wrestling with right now and working on and

1637
01:37:26.211 --> 01:37:30.410
try to communicate and there's some really concrete ways you can go about it.

1638
01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:33.320
I would recommend everybody,
certainly,
if any of that resonates,

1639
01:37:34.010 --> 01:37:37.340
do yourself a favor,
get a book called radical acceptance by Tara Brock.

1640
01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:40.730
Terrible title,
fantastic book.
Give it a read.

1641
01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:43.070
I could have a huge impact.

1642
01:37:47.810 --> 01:37:52.260
Yeah,
that's a good question about psychedelics.
I would say,
uh,

1643
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:55.280
that yes is my tentative answer,

1644
01:37:55.950 --> 01:38:00.950
but I would not recommend that anyone tage psychedelics without professional

1645
01:38:04.291 --> 01:38:05.130
supervision.

1646
01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:09.270
There are legal ramifications to consider and I would take it as seriously as

1647
01:38:09.271 --> 01:38:14.271
you would choosing a neurosurgeon to remove a tumor that if miss operated on

1648
01:38:15.001 --> 01:38:18.420
were resulted in a fatality.
It's a lot of people right now.
Sorry man.

1649
01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:20.460
That's about it right now.

1650
01:38:20.461 --> 01:38:23.100
A lot of people are going on craigslist and finding neurosurgeons.

1651
01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:27.360
My friend's a shaman would just order some stuff from the Internet,

1652
01:38:27.361 --> 01:38:30.090
from China for Iowasca.
We're going to do it in our slow cooker.

1653
01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:33.930
That idea that,
that,
that,
that idea.

1654
01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:39.630
Uh,
so there are many tools.
I don't think that's the only tool.
Meditation,

1655
01:38:40.710 --> 01:38:42.360
Silent Retreats,
which I'm not ready to do,

1656
01:38:42.361 --> 01:38:44.880
recommend it cause I do think they can be extremely destabilizing.

1657
01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:46.950
There are many,
many tools in the toolkit,

1658
01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:50.880
but the point I want to make is there are tools and you can start with something

1659
01:38:50.881 --> 01:38:55.290
that does not involve visiting your ancestors and seeing flashing neon

1660
01:38:55.291 --> 01:38:56.400
crocodiles in your mind,

1661
01:38:57.900 --> 01:39:01.500
which could be radical acceptance is to take a look.

1662
01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:03.390
<v 6>Thank you guys very much and thank Tim.</v>

1663
01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:11.940
Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.

1664
01:39:12.270 --> 01:39:14.910
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1665
01:39:15.330 --> 01:39:18.180
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1666
01:39:18.210 --> 01:39:20.730
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday?

1667
01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:25.350
That provides a little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet

1668
01:39:25.351 --> 01:39:29.970
Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that

1669
01:39:29.971 --> 01:39:31.530
I've been pondering over the week.

1670
01:39:31.770 --> 01:39:34.530
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1671
01:39:34.531 --> 01:39:37.980
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1672
01:39:37.981 --> 01:39:42.300
somehow dug up in the other world of the esoteric as I do.

1673
01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:47.600
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

1674
01:39:48.270 --> 01:39:50.970
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

1675
01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:56.040
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend,

1676
01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:58.260
so if you want to receive that,
check it out.

1677
01:39:58.530 --> 01:40:03.210
Just go to a four hour work week.com that's four hour workweek.com all spelled

1678
01:40:03.211 --> 01:40:07.320
out and just drop in your email and you'll get the very next one and if you sign

1679
01:40:07.321 --> 01:40:12.180
up,
I hope you enjoy it.
This episode is brought to you by convert kit,

I use them for everything.

1681
01:40:15.630 --> 01:40:18.930
If you've ever wondered how professional bloggers,
podcasters,
youtubers,

1682
01:40:18.931 --> 01:40:23.310
and so on can build a platform they control and get the word out about their

1683
01:40:23.311 --> 01:40:27.540
best content.
Email is still the answer.
People think it's all social,
social,

1684
01:40:27.541 --> 01:40:30.900
social,
but one algorithm change.
Oops,
bait and switch.

1685
01:40:30.901 --> 01:40:32.610
Now you only reach 10% of your audience.

1686
01:40:32.910 --> 01:40:35.550
That is why I've doubled and tripled down on an end mill.

1687
01:40:36.150 --> 01:40:38.880
After reviewing many different email service providers,

1688
01:40:38.910 --> 01:40:42.480
I ended up selecting convert kit for email like five bullet Friday,

1689
01:40:42.481 --> 01:40:46.890
which goes out to about a million people now because convert kit delivers on

1690
01:40:46.891 --> 01:40:50.280
what matters most to me at least easy to use.
Systems,

1691
01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:53.860
split testing and resending technology,
both very,
very important.

1692
01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:57.910
High rates of deliverability and great hands on customer service.

1693
01:40:57.911 --> 01:41:00.100
So whether you run a business or simply have,

1694
01:41:00.101 --> 01:41:04.840
say a serious blog convert kit has integrations with more than 70 different

1695
01:41:04.841 --> 01:41:06.730
services just about anything you might need,

1696
01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:10.540
including hosting sites like wordpress,
ecommerce platform like Shopify,

1697
01:41:10.541 --> 01:41:14.080
lead capture technology like bounce exchange or sumo and many more.

1698
01:41:14.530 --> 01:41:18.250
They also offer a visual automation builder that makes it really easy to deliver

1699
01:41:18.251 --> 01:41:21.700
the right content to the right people in your audience just when they want it.

1700
01:41:21.701 --> 01:41:24.490
If you want to segment in different ways,
which a lot of people do,

1701
01:41:25.390 --> 01:41:28.180
convert kit offers,
plants that adjusted the size of your business,

1702
01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:32.770
so it's good option whether you have a thousand people or 1 million on your
list,

1703
01:41:32.830 --> 01:41:37.210
and certainly I am planning on growing and growing and growing and I don't like

1704
01:41:37.211 --> 01:41:38.770
switching email service providers,

1705
01:41:38.771 --> 01:41:42.310
so I thought very carefully about this before I selected them to check it out.

1706
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Take a look@convertkit.com forward slash 10 that's convert Con v e r t k,

1707
01:41:48.341 --> 01:41:52.810
I t.com/tim and you can get your first month for free.

1708
01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:55.900
Kick the tires,
test it out.
That way you can give it a shot.

1709
01:41:55.990 --> 01:41:59.890
Make sure that it works for you,
your business and all of that goodness.

1710
01:42:00.250 --> 01:42:03.190
If you're like me,
I hope you'll find that they get the job done.

1711
01:42:03.310 --> 01:42:06.250
That's certainly been my experience.
It's check it out.
Again,

1712
01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:11.200
that's convert kit.com forward slash Tim for a free month of email services.

1713
01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:16.900
This episode is brought to you by Peloton and I'd heard about Peloton over and

1714
01:42:16.901 --> 01:42:17.734
over again,

1715
01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:22.570
but I ended up getting a Peloton bike and the whole system after I saw my buddy

1716
01:42:22.990 --> 01:42:25.720
Kevin Rose,
I've known him forever,
some of you know,

1717
01:42:25.810 --> 01:42:30.810
and he showed up at my gate at my house a while back and he looked fantastic.

1718
01:42:33.190 --> 01:42:36.040
I asked him as a dude,
you look great,
what the hell have you been up to?

1719
01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:38.200
Because he's always doing a weird diet or another,

1720
01:42:38.201 --> 01:42:39.700
but it only lasted like a week or two.

1721
01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:43.570
So he always regresses to the mean after like 75 beers and he said,

1722
01:42:43.571 --> 01:42:46.090
I've been doing Peloton five days a week now.

1723
01:42:46.091 --> 01:42:50.830
That caught my attention because Kevin does nothing five days a week and you

1724
01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:54.040
know,
I love you Kevin,
but it really peaked my curiosity.

1725
01:42:54.130 --> 01:42:59.130
Ended up getting a system and it's become an integral part of my week.

1726
01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:04.030
I love it and I really didn't expect to love it at all because I find cycling

1727
01:43:04.031 --> 01:43:05.560
really boring usually,

1728
01:43:05.710 --> 01:43:10.690
but peloton is an indoor cycling bike that brings live studio classes right into

1729
01:43:10.691 --> 01:43:11.524
your home.

1730
01:43:11.590 --> 01:43:14.170
You know if worry about fitting classes into your schedule or making it to a

1731
01:43:14.171 --> 01:43:16.120
studio,
it's some type of commute,

1732
01:43:16.121 --> 01:43:20.680
etc. New classes are added every day and this includes options led by elite New

1733
01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:22.060
York City instructors in your own living room.

1734
01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:26.170
You can even livestream studio classes taught by the world's best instructors or

1735
01:43:26.171 --> 01:43:31.171
find her own favorite class on demand and in fact Kevin and I rarely do live

1736
01:43:31.361 --> 01:43:35.020
classes and you can compete with your friends,
which is also fun.
Kevin,

1737
01:43:35.021 --> 01:43:39.190
I'm coming after you but we usually just use classes on demand.

1738
01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:44.280
I really like not Wilbur's and his eye high intensity training sessions that are

1739
01:43:44.291 --> 01:43:49.291
shorter of 20 minutes and I think Kevin's favorite is Alex and everyone seems to

1740
01:43:50.351 --> 01:43:54.980
have their favorite instructor or you can select by music duration and so on.

1741
01:43:55.550 --> 01:44:00.530
Each Peloton bike includes a 22 inch HD touchscreen performance tracking
metrics.

1742
01:44:00.531 --> 01:44:05.120
I think that along with the real time leaderboard are the main reasons that this

1743
01:44:05.121 --> 01:44:09.470
caught my attention when cycling never had caught my attention before.

1744
01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:13.010
It's really pretty stunning what they've done with the user interface to keep

1745
01:44:13.011 --> 01:44:17.330
your attention.
The belt drive is quiet and it's smaller than you would expect,

1746
01:44:17.331 --> 01:44:19.310
so it can fit in a living room or an office.

1747
01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:22.610
I actually have it in a large closet,
believe it or not,

1748
01:44:23.210 --> 01:44:25.210
and it fits with no problem.

1749
01:44:25.250 --> 01:44:30.250
So peloton is offering all of you guys the snares of the Tim Ferriss show,

1750
01:44:30.321 --> 01:44:31.640
a special offer,

1751
01:44:31.641 --> 01:44:35.450
and it is actually special visit one Peloton that's o,

Wait,

1755
01:44:49.161 --> 01:44:53.750
I don't need fancy towels or whatever other supplemental bits and pieces.

1756
01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:57.380
No,
the shoes you need,
you need the clip in shoes.

1757
01:44:57.381 --> 01:45:01.670
And those are in the accessory category.
