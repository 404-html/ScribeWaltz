00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.850
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:06.210
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.890
No else are you posting a question?

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.530
I'm a cybernetic organism.

5
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.210
<v 1>This episode of the Tim Ferriss show is brought to you by Linkedin.</v>

6
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.230
More specifically,
I'm referring to Linkedin job recruitment platform,

7
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.830
which is a great way to find and hire the quality talent that you need in your

8
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:37.170
organization.
You already know,
of course,

9
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:40.230
Linkedin as the world's largest professional network,

10
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.290
and in fact 70% of the US workforce is already on Linkedin and 22 million

11
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.790
professionals view and apply to jobs on linkedin every week.
Given those numbers,

12
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.180
it's not surprising at all that there've been hundreds of thousands of

13
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:58.410
businesses that have posted to linkedin jobs over the past year alone,

14
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.430
and because linkedin considers skills,
experiences location and much more,

15
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.990
they just have better data to match and promote your job to potential
candidates.

16
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:10.140
The most qualified candidates,
unlike other generic job boards,

17
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.850
businesses have rated linked in jobs 40% better than job boards at delivering

18
00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:16.650
quality candidates.
So check it out.

27

28

<v 2>Yeah.</v>

51
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.170
<v 1>Hello,
you crazy kids.
This is Tim Ferriss.</v>

52
00:03:13.171 --> 00:03:17.490
Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my want to

53
00:03:17.491 --> 00:03:21.600
investigate the habits and routines of world class performers to try to tease

54
00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:25.050
out the various details so you might apply to your own life.

55
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.420
This episode is a very different format.

56
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.570
It is an odd one that has proven surprisingly popular for reasons that sometimes

57
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.060
I don't quite understand and that is a drunk dialing Q and a with all of you

58
00:03:39.061 --> 00:03:43.440
guys,
which I've done a few times in the last few years and here's how it works.

59
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.920
I solicited phone numbers from listeners on Facebook and Twitter.

60
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.560
You want to receive a phone call from me,
which they put into a Google form.

61
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.920
Then I told people who the first say 10 to 20 we're going to be by posting it on

62
00:03:58.921 --> 00:04:01.440
social media and then I started drinking and dialing,

63
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.540
answering questions and getting a little frisky along the way.
Uh,
in fact,

64
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.610
this one,
I came in hot,

65
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.450
started after a few preliminary drinks with friends on a weekend,

66
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.680
so it's double trouble.

67
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.390
I ended up covering topics including how to reassess existing projects,

68
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.500
specifically ones which you've put a lot of capital and time into using 80,

69
00:04:22.501 --> 00:04:27.360
20 analysis and other tools.
How to learn to care less about what people think,

70
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.140
social perception and how to minimize herd mentality.

71
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.000
Not Saying I'm perfect in that regard,

72
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:38.001
but I'm pretty good and have approaches for sort of decreasing the perceived

73
00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:40.140
pressure around all of those things.

74
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.220
A framework for thinking about entrepreneurship risk taking and how to cut your

75
00:04:44.221 --> 00:04:48.450
teeth as a business builder or creator.
How to learn to ask better questions,

76
00:04:48.451 --> 00:04:52.350
whether in dating or sales and how to let the silence do the work and so much

77
00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:56.310
more.
And uh,
all that preamble out of the way.

78
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.020
Please enjoy this Tequila fueled Q and a with all y'all.

79
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.103
<v 2>Okay,</v>

80
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.583
<v 3>Danny.</v>

81
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.570
<v 1>Hey Dad.
It's Tim Ferris.
Oh Hey Danny,
this is Tim Ferriss.
I drop my mic.</v>

82
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.463
How are you?

83
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.360
<v 3>Are you,</v>

84
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.060
<v 1>oh,
I'm a clicking into sixth gear was just sloppy gear.</v>

85
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.460
So you're catching me at a good point.

86
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:23.461
This is just in the transition to probably 20% too much alcohol.

87
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.873
How are you doing?

88
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.000
<v 3>I don't know man.
I don't mean to you.
I'm not quite sure.
Andy glass of wine.</v>

89
00:05:30.001 --> 00:05:30.840
Are you in right now?

90
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.320
<v 1>Oh No,
we're,
we're dealing with straight Tequila.</v>

91
00:05:33.321 --> 00:05:36.920
So I would say four or five glasses in,
which is,

92
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.120
I'd say a pretty good spot.
It's not completely haphazard,

93
00:05:41.121 --> 00:05:45.920
but it is a well lubricated.
Where are you at the moment?

94
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.990
<v 3>I am throwing you some Lake City,
Utah,
honor you.</v>

95
00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:52.180
I'm in Texas at the moment.

96
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:57.180
<v 1>I am the fine,
the fine city of Austin and the Republic of Texas.</v>

97
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.190
Big Fan

98
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.170
<v 4>of SLC though.
It's a good spot.
So how can I assist this evening?</v>

99
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:04.580
What questions might you have?

100
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.990
<v 3>What's your system do you use or have you used in the past essentially or</v>

101
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:25.610
effectively stop caring about what other people opinions are about you,

102
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:27.890
your endeavors that you like that.

103
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.170
And then how do you go about building a world class supports this stuff.

104
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.090
<v 4>These could both go for a while.</v>

105
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:40.091
So I will try my best to provide a non bullshit answer to either or both.

106
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.633
Uh,

107
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.790
in terms of getting to the point where you care less or not at all about what

108
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.270
other people think.
Let me drill into your,
your personal case.

109
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:57.080
So what is,

110
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.080
what is there that you might want to do where caring about what other people

111
00:07:03.711 --> 00:07:06.770
think is inhibiting your ability to execute,

112
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:11.780
whether for yourself or for the world at large in some capacity?

113
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.100
<v 3>Yeah,
just because I grew up</v>

114
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.180
in Germany,
family,
immigrated to Germany from Yugoslavia,

115
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.420
all of the war and genocide,
immigrant narrative,

116
00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:30.310
if you're nobody,

117
00:07:30.311 --> 00:07:33.580
and once you get a college degree is so naturally I'm competing against all of

118
00:07:33.581 --> 00:07:37.080
my family members and cousins who are all electrical engineers,

119
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.860
mechanical engineers,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

120
00:07:38.861 --> 00:07:43.861
So regardless of what idea of ambition or anything else that in that regard

121
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.650
staff to do that,
as long as I have a college degree,

122
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.950
nobody valued it and spinning your wheels and wasting your time.

123
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.360
<v 4>Got It.
Okay.
So it's not,</v>

124
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:57.540
it's so you're not then concerned about what perspective customers or people in

125
00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:02.720
the marketplace think of whatever you're starting.

126
00:08:02.721 --> 00:08:04.550
It's more of a question of family members,

127
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.090
<v 3>especially getting out of the herd mentality,
right?</v>

128
00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:13.091
And just being able to actively break away from that and not be bogged down with

129
00:08:13.561 --> 00:08:16.100
just some of the things that are going to happen.
Um,

130
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.120
<v 4>you know,
within my own circle,
this is tougher.</v>

131
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.920
This is tougher than the marketplace.

132
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.480
I would say tougher but not impossible.
I would recommend a few,

133
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.260
a few resources.
This is not something that I've personally experienced,

134
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.910
but it's something that a lot of my friends have experienced.
Uh,
it's very,

135
00:08:33.911 --> 00:08:38.620
very common as you know,
with immigrant families,
right?
Whether,
uh,
I,

136
00:08:38.621 --> 00:08:43.390
lot of my friends are first generation raised in the u s from India for
instance.

137
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:45.550
Uh,
exceptionally common.

138
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.840
If you are not an engineered lawyer or doctor or fill in the blank,

139
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.580
then all of your motives and the future prospects are suspect.

140
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:55.800
Uh,

141
00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.800
what I have observed is that if you experience a degree of success and

142
00:09:01.801 --> 00:09:05.290
entrepreneurship than all sins are forgiven and,

143
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.300
and ultimately people are very proud of what you've done.

144
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.800
A few resources that I might recommend that I've found helpful in navigating

145
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.780
maybe somewhat similar psychic space.

146
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:23.160
And then I've seen other people benefit from and that have come up a lot in

147
00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:25.260
interviews on the podcast for instance,

148
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:30.570
as it relates to some similar life experiences.

149
00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:34.610
One would be man,
search for meaning by Viktor Frankl.
Uh,

150
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.830
the second which has,

151
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:41.880
has come up a lot is the magic of thinking big by David Schwartz.

152
00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.690
Um,
both of these books are,
are quite short.

153
00:09:45.691 --> 00:09:49.680
I want to say both are certainly no longer than 250 pages and maybe less than

154
00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:53.790
200 each.
So you could,
you could read each in an afternoon,

155
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.550
uh,
or certainly a single day.
And you know,

156
00:09:59.551 --> 00:10:01.290
aside from that,

157
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.800
I would look for people who have done what you are trying to do,

158
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.940
namely succeed as an entrepreneur,

159
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.870
as the child of immigrants who have,

160
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:18.510
uh,
a security focused mindset.

161
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.930
If I could be so bold as to assume that's the case right now.

162
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.710
Yeah.
Uh,
and there are many,
many,

163
00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:33.390
many such people to look to,
whether that's uh,

164
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:37.950
on the,
on the name brand side,
you can certainly pick and choose.

165
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.250
I'm more familiar with many of the Indian entrepreneurs who've done this based

166
00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:45.900
on,
uh,
spending time with organizations like the Indus Entrepreneur,

167
00:10:45.901 --> 00:10:49.980
Tai,
which may or may not exist any longer,
but it was certainly a,
a,

168
00:10:49.981 --> 00:10:54.981
a major entity when I was first getting to know the bay area with nothing to my

169
00:10:55.711 --> 00:11:00.420
name aside from really a piece of Shit,
hand me down green minivan.

170
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.510
Uh,
and,
uh,
I've,

171
00:11:03.511 --> 00:11:08.511
I've always found those stories to be exceptionally inspiring but also to serve

172
00:11:09.241 --> 00:11:13.950
as proof of concept for you to see that it can be done and that in fact those

173
00:11:13.951 --> 00:11:16.830
people then end up not just being reconciled with their family,

174
00:11:16.831 --> 00:11:21.831
but very respected and honored and talked about by their family at the same

175
00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:22.351
time.

176
00:11:22.351 --> 00:11:27.330
So I think studying historical cases is very useful,

177
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.100
uh,
in,
in a situation like this.
If you're setting,

178
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.290
certainly we already talked about it.
You already talked about it.

179
00:11:34.291 --> 00:11:37.710
I'm not going to Belabor that.
Uh,
otherwise,

180
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.960
I do think that,

181
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:45.750
and a reach a Chada who's an Indian actress,
certainly more than that,

182
00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:48.930
but talked about this in tribe of mentors when she,

183
00:11:48.931 --> 00:11:53.770
I asked her what she did when she felt overwhelmed or unfocused and she would

184
00:11:53.771 --> 00:11:57.130
ask,
so what,
so you really,
you write down your fear,

185
00:11:57.131 --> 00:12:00.670
and this is different from fear setting,
but she would ask,
so what,

186
00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:05.140
five to eight times,
let's just say,
and you'd write down your fear.

187
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.700
This happens.
So what?

188
00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:10.690
And then you write the consequence or the proceeding generative year.

189
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.700
And then so what?
And then so what?
And then so what,

190
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:16.390
and by the time you really get to the bottom of one or two pages,

191
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.800
you realize that the teeth just aren't there.
Ultimately,

192
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.020
I'm making this up.
This may not be true for you,

193
00:12:23.021 --> 00:12:26.080
but ultimately like your family will love you no matter what.

194
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.890
They're just busting your balls about this particular thing,
right?

195
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.930
Or if you fail an entrepreneurship,
you can always go get a job.

196
00:12:34.931 --> 00:12:38.620
It may not be an electrical engineering,
but if you wanted to and had to,

197
00:12:38.621 --> 00:12:39.520
you had a gun against your head,

198
00:12:39.521 --> 00:12:43.150
you had to go find a job that your parents would approve of or your siblings and

199
00:12:43.151 --> 00:12:45.550
approve of.
You could do that.
Right.

200
00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.950
Or You could at least get on a path that would lead to one of those jobs and

201
00:12:50.951 --> 00:12:55.810
therefore in and of itself,
be respectable to your family members.

202
00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:01.000
So that's,
that's another tool in the toolkit potentially.

203
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:06.680
But I think that any modicum of success for gives all sentence,

204
00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:10.540
<v 3>right?</v>

205
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.260
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah.
It is.
It is.
But look,
I am not,
I mean,</v>

206
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:19.261
my grandfather was the first of his family born in the United States on one side

207
00:13:21.221 --> 00:13:22.054
of my family.

208
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:27.060
And I never dealt with having parents who were first generation immigrants,

209
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.200
uh,
at all.
But,
uh,

210
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:37.230
certainly my parents had been unable to explain to anyone what Tim does for a

211
00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:42.400
living for a really,
really long time.
I mean,
it was,
it was very,

212
00:13:42.401 --> 00:13:43.960
very hard to explain.

213
00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:49.030
And once I had a label like author or podcast or they can be used,

214
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.680
it made things a whole lot easier and they were very supportive.

215
00:13:53.681 --> 00:13:56.800
I don't want to send,
my parents weren't supportive.
Uh,
they were.

216
00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:01.860
But the labels and the success combine to give your parents or siblings a story

217
00:14:05.561 --> 00:14:10.561
that makes sense for them and that they can convey to other people and you can

218
00:14:10.721 --> 00:14:13.450
help them to develop that narrative,
if that makes sense.

219
00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.910
And you can also help them to develop that narrative by introducing them to

220
00:14:18.911 --> 00:14:23.911
documentaries or books or stories or articles about immigrants who have become

221
00:14:24.611 --> 00:14:25.444
entrepreneurs.

222
00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.390
<v 3>First Generation Entrepreneur,</v>

223
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:38.080
immigrants just filled the number one priority for all of these.

224
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.170
So it's interesting paradox.

225
00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:44.960
<v 4>Yeah,
I would,
I,
yeah.
And here's,
here's nothing I would say,</v>

226
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:49.100
it doesn't make you weak to care about what other people think.

227
00:14:49.101 --> 00:14:54.101
It makes you human as a homo sapiens would not have created,

228
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.020
I mean arguably destroyed also.

229
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:02.170
But what we have created without a concern for social perception and hierarchy,

230
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:10.930
that is just part of the programming that we experience as a human being.

231
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.170
And it's serves a lot of productive purposes.

232
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.910
So I wouldn't judge yourself too harshly for caring what other people think.

233
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:25.010
You just have to equally care about what you think.
Right?

234
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.820
Yeah.

235
00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:30.080
And in a good way to learn to care about what you think is to take it out of

236
00:15:30.081 --> 00:15:31.550
your head and to put it onto paper,

237
00:15:31.551 --> 00:15:34.790
whether that's through fear setting through the five minute journal or something

238
00:15:34.791 --> 00:15:36.560
like that,
morning pages and so on.

239
00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:41.561
I really find that I cannot grapple productively with my own thoughts until I've

240
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.460
trapped them on paper in some fashion.

241
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.970
<v 3>I appreciate that.</v>

242
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:51.160
<v 4>Yup.
So hopefully that helps.
If it doesn't,
I apologize,
but,
um,
what,</v>

243
00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:52.880
what else,
what else do you have?
For me?

244
00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.200
<v 3>Building a support system and just,
you know,</v>

245
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:05.220
getting in the right network or group of people that you are in silicone valley

246
00:16:05.221 --> 00:16:08.700
around a bunch of Angel Niecey's and kind of that tech industry,

247
00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:12.960
which initially helped open a lot of doors for you and kind of broke down a lot

248
00:16:12.961 --> 00:16:15.420
of barriers to help you get your foot in the door and you know,

249
00:16:15.421 --> 00:16:19.440
become as successful as you are for or,
um,
in that feel.

250
00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:23.400
<v 4>Let's get specific.
So what do you need a support system for?</v>

251
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.460
What are you trying to achieve?
What do you think you need one for?

252
00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:29.110
<v 3>Right.
And so I guess it just ties into going into,</v>

253
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:34.030
which is my ambition of entrepreneurship and branching out and just essentially

254
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.220
doing my own thing and

255
00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.590
<v 4>okay.
Which is totally fine,</v>

256
00:16:38.591 --> 00:16:43.450
but their entrepreneurship is a very,
very broad,
right,

257
00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:48.010
right.
I mean that could be any,
no,
no,
no.
You don't have to apologize.

258
00:16:48.011 --> 00:16:53.011
It's very common that people want to man their own ship and carve their own

259
00:16:54.041 --> 00:16:54.874
course.

260
00:16:55.390 --> 00:17:00.390
But it will help me to think about the question if we have some degree of

261
00:17:01.151 --> 00:17:05.680
specificity.
And,
uh,
if you're trying to pick,

262
00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.220
and uh,
this is something I've,
I've mentioned before,

263
00:17:09.221 --> 00:17:12.400
but the five people with whom to associate with most,

264
00:17:12.401 --> 00:17:16.090
whether they're in the form of books,
in person,
mentors or otherwise,

265
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.730
you do need the specificity to help you target,

266
00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:26.820
whether that's a skillset or certain types of characteristics that you want to

267
00:17:27.761 --> 00:17:31.840
develop.
Uh,
so what,
what do you want to do in the world of entrepreneurship?

268
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:33.730
I mean,
who are the people you aspire to be?
Like,

269
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.650
what are the projects that you would love to be a part of?
And uh,
you know,
where,

270
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:40.600
where are you in that journey also?
I mean,

271
00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:42.400
do you have a company with 10 employees?
Do you have a,

272
00:17:42.401 --> 00:17:44.530
a company with one employee?
Namely you do,

273
00:17:44.531 --> 00:17:46.930
you have no company but you're thinking about starting something?

274
00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:48.480
Where are you at the moment?
Moment.

275
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.060
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,</v>

276
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.680
<v 4>so for your concrete's essentially I'm looking at an individual sectors.</v>

277
00:17:53.681 --> 00:17:58.260
Your sound for like a Gary Vaynerchuk,
John D Rockefeller,
Steve Jobs,

278
00:17:58.261 --> 00:18:02.610
obviously not aiming to hit those heights just cause there's so much luck

279
00:18:02.611 --> 00:18:03.890
involved in that way.
Those are there.

280
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:07.530
You got to see the people that I brought to the forefront often and think about

281
00:18:07.531 --> 00:18:11.250
off then.
Then as far as pulling the trigger,
I'm doing something.

282
00:18:11.251 --> 00:18:15.390
I'm always down to the point of building something,

283
00:18:15.391 --> 00:18:19.020
building up the systems to essentially having everything set up on my end but

284
00:18:19.021 --> 00:18:21.270
then just never pulling the trigger and going live.

285
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.390
Right now I work at a small start up like San Francisco based actually.
Um,

286
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.640
we've have an office in your town.
There was operations,
um,

287
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.540
analysts and do a lot of building in salesforce.

288
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:36.570
But the saying the shy branch out,
do my own thing.
And uh,

289
00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:42.360
the realm of social and chat or some sort of cross a hybrid between the two.

290
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:45.950
What do you want to get?

291
00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:50.090
What do you think you might get through entrepreneurship that you don't get

292
00:18:50.091 --> 00:18:51.020
through your current job?

293
00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.530
<v 3>Can it be the captain of my own ship?
I've never,</v>

294
00:18:54.531 --> 00:18:58.010
it never sat well with me kind of being that guy was like,
okay,
here's the job,

295
00:18:58.011 --> 00:18:58.611
here's the role,

296
00:18:58.611 --> 00:19:03.611
here's what we think you're capable of and here's your pay relative to what we

297
00:19:03.771 --> 00:19:04.910
think your skill set is.

298
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:08.570
And what you can handle and then diamond and plan your life accordingly to that

299
00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.410
and essentially just like to have more time than you'd be able to draw on my own

300
00:19:12.411 --> 00:19:16.640
life,
my own agenda on my own calendar,
do whatever I want to do and that my will.

301
00:19:16.641 --> 00:19:20.590
And then I'm also recently married on coming up on two years in Marion,

302
00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.330
trying to start a family in the next couple of years.

303
00:19:23.331 --> 00:19:28.160
So I'm essentially giving them a one up at better foundation than what I had

304
00:19:28.161 --> 00:19:30.980
started.
And I just love the game of business.

305
00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.690
<v 4>Well,
if you had to start a business tomorrow,</v>

306
00:19:33.691 --> 00:19:37.770
you got fired and you need to start generating income within,

307
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.390
let's just call it eight weeks.
You have eight weeks of severance.
Oh,

308
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.550
we can make a 12 let's be generous.
You have 12 weeks of severance.

309
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:49.070
You have health insurance for a year.
Let's just assume,
right?

310
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.513
What would you do?

311
00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:56.370
<v 3>I'd go into ecommerce and Shopify and</v>

312
00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:03.160
fair and just to be something going.
What would you sell?
Probably Apparel.

313
00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:07.730
Apparel.
Why would you sell apparel?
Now you're grilling me.

314
00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:14.580
I feel like I could find some sort of niche to fill as far as the people

315
00:20:17.651 --> 00:20:22.190
identifying with a group or industry,
whether it's,

316
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.760
I'm just throwing things out there for the sake of throwing things out there,

317
00:20:24.761 --> 00:20:28.930
but whether it's geared towards entrepreneurship and I've seen a lot of things

318
00:20:28.931 --> 00:20:32.980
trending where like crypto investors and big one,
stuff like that.

319
00:20:32.981 --> 00:20:34.900
I know it's trendy,
it's not going to be long term,
but

320
00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.390
just help me get from point a to point B.

321
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.690
<v 4>Okay.
So here,
here's what I would,</v>

322
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.570
here's what I would suggest,
uh,
as a,

323
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.420
as a framework for thinking about entrepreneurship.

324
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:56.070
Entrepreneurship is not mutually exclusive with employment.

325
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.560
And truth be told,

326
00:20:59.561 --> 00:21:04.561
I think the best way to cut your teeth as an entrepreneur is doing so while you

327
00:21:05.321 --> 00:21:07.270
have a paycheck.
Uh,

328
00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:12.320
I even though people might think of me as a risk taker and someone with a high

329
00:21:13.181 --> 00:21:16.780
tolerance for risk,
I don't think of myself that way.

330
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:20.800
And for the record,
I've interviewed people like Richard Branson for instance.

331
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:24.970
They do not think of themselves that way either.
Uh,
first and foremost,

332
00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:26.380
they're looking at how to mitigate risk.

333
00:21:26.381 --> 00:21:31.090
So I would suggest that if that is what you would do as an entrepreneur,

334
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:36.120
that you spend say every Friday night and Saturday for the next eight weeks

335
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:42.400
developing that business or Sunday afternoons and evenings,

336
00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:43.480
whatever it might be,

337
00:21:43.481 --> 00:21:47.710
so that you have the security of the paycheck you're receiving,

338
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:52.740
you are fulfilling your obligations to your employer while simultaneously

339
00:21:53.051 --> 00:21:58.051
cutting your teeth and testing the assumptions that are underpinning your belief

340
00:21:58.691 --> 00:22:03.691
that apparel and ecommerce could be the business that provides you with the

341
00:22:05.411 --> 00:22:09.530
freedom you seek.
And,
uh,

342
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.110
there is no right answer here.

343
00:22:11.111 --> 00:22:16.111
I should also emphasize in the sense that for better or for worse,

344
00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:23.970
the American dream and the media machines that exist in our country highlight

345
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.600
the entrepreneurs who seemingly throw caution to the wind bet,

346
00:22:28.601 --> 00:22:30.190
the farm and when big

347
00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:36.160
that is not how most entrepreneurs succeed.
And in fact,

348
00:22:36.161 --> 00:22:39.370
that is not how most humans,
uh,

349
00:22:39.371 --> 00:22:44.110
achieve a life of fulfillment and financial security and contentment.

350
00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:45.100
Uh,

351
00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:49.960
there is no shame in determining that you are really,

352
00:22:49.961 --> 00:22:50.381
really,

353
00:22:50.381 --> 00:22:55.381
really good lieutenant or general who can execute on orders and take something

354
00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:03.340
that would overwhelm other people in complexity or fill in the blank perimeter

355
00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.810
and a turn a plan into reality.

356
00:23:07.811 --> 00:23:10.150
That is an incredibly powerful gift.

357
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:15.630
And if you do that within the confines of a company that is in no way indicative

358
00:23:15.851 --> 00:23:20.851
of a lower value than being an entrepreneur staring off into space and trying to

359
00:23:22.751 --> 00:23:25.900
figure out what the fuck do it.
So I just,

360
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:30.820
even though I mean I am an entrepreneur because I am a shitty,
shitty,
shitty,

361
00:23:30.821 --> 00:23:34.780
shitty,
shitty employee basically.
And,
uh,

362
00:23:34.781 --> 00:23:37.000
I'm proud of that in some capacities,

363
00:23:37.001 --> 00:23:39.190
but I'm also ashamed of that in other capacities.
I mean,

364
00:23:39.191 --> 00:23:43.270
there are severe personality,
uh,

365
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:48.320
and interpersonal deficits that make my entrepreneurship a necessity and not an

366
00:23:49.701 --> 00:23:54.180
option.
Does that make sense?
Right.
Um,
and,
uh,

367
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.750
furthermore,
I am not a good manager of people.

368
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.960
I'm very good at figuring out systems.
I'm very,
very,

369
00:23:59.961 --> 00:24:03.920
very good at figuring out processes.
I am not a good manager of people.

370
00:24:03.921 --> 00:24:08.080
I have certain Achilles heels including,
uh,

371
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:13.180
unreasonable impatience and perfectionism and other things that lead me to be

372
00:24:13.191 --> 00:24:17.390
very difficult to work with,
uh,
and very difficult to work for.
Uh,
certainly,

373
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:20.360
and I,
and I,
and I don't wear those as a badge of honor.

374
00:24:20.361 --> 00:24:25.361
I think those are handicaps in many respects and there's no way that I could

375
00:24:25.641 --> 00:24:28.440
possibly be the CEO of say,
a publicly traded company.

376
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:32.300
It would not that I wouldn't pass go in a situation like that.

377
00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.460
So I have my sweet spot.

378
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:38.720
Other people have their sweet spots and you are going to have your sweet spot

379
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:44.110
and I wouldn't judge yourself harshly at all if that ends up being a sort of a

380
00:24:47.241 --> 00:24:52.241
special purpose weapon inside a company for doing x,

381
00:24:52.371 --> 00:24:53.360
y,
and Z.
Right.

382
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:58.930
But the way you test your assumptions related to entrepreneurship is by doing so

383
00:24:59.151 --> 00:25:01.760
in a moonlighting capacity.
So I would,

384
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:07.250
I would take what it is you think you could do when you quit your job and do

385
00:25:07.251 --> 00:25:12.020
that now.
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't test those assumptions.

386
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:16.070
When you've already cut the umbilical cord and you no longer have the financial

387
00:25:16.071 --> 00:25:17.630
security of a paycheck.

388
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:21.710
So I would do that now and I've seen a lot of really,
really,
really,

389
00:25:21.711 --> 00:25:24.870
really good companies started that way.
But you know,

390
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:29.890
for the sake of your sanity and financial security and also the security of your

391
00:25:32.511 --> 00:25:36.470
family to be,
if you're considering moving on that,
uh,

392
00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.060
I would absolutely moonlight.

393
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:41.660
Well that's going to mean is you're going to have to put in extra time in

394
00:25:41.661 --> 00:25:45.830
addition to your job,
whether it's on evenings or weekends or otherwise.

395
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.620
And guess what?
Like that is what you're signing up for.
If you're,

396
00:25:48.621 --> 00:25:50.000
if you choose to be an entrepreneur,

397
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:54.590
if you're currently working eight hours a day for at least the first six to 12

398
00:25:54.591 --> 00:25:56.750
months,
you are going to be working,
you know,

399
00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:01.580
1214 hours a day and almost without exception,

400
00:26:01.581 --> 00:26:02.840
that is a foregone conclusion.

401
00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:07.900
So you might as well get used to that in terms of additional hours per week and

402
00:26:08.601 --> 00:26:11.240
see how you handle it psychologically,
physically and otherwise.

403
00:26:11.241 --> 00:26:15.770
Because that is par for the course for at least the first six to 12 months

404
00:26:15.771 --> 00:26:20.771
without any necessary guarantee of success,

405
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.560
uh,
in the,
in,
in the longer term.
So those are,

406
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:27.620
those are a few possibilities to consider,

407
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:32.630
but I would absolutely make sure that you moonlight and test your

408
00:26:32.631 --> 00:26:35.990
entrepreneurial chops and develop your entrepreneurial skills while you still

409
00:26:35.991 --> 00:26:38.670
have fulltime income.
Uh,

410
00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:43.680
I think that's a very cautious but ultimately intelligent way to approach

411
00:26:44.011 --> 00:26:44.680
things.

412
00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.090
<v 3>All right.
I appreciate your insight.</v>

413
00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:51.860
<v 4>Uh,
alright.
Anything,
anything else?
I know that probably,</v>

414
00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:56.300
uh,
hopefully that's not completely underwhelming as recommendation,

415
00:26:56.301 --> 00:26:59.810
but I would really,
I would really just fucking get to it.
Like,

416
00:26:59.811 --> 00:27:00.920
if you're going to be an entrepreneur,

417
00:27:00.921 --> 00:27:03.200
you don't have to wait until you quit your job.
Like start now.

418
00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:08.030
Like start tonight,
start this weekend,
like just fucking get on it.
And it's like,

419
00:27:08.031 --> 00:27:09.590
all right,
set up your Shopify,

420
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.090
start doing your market research to determine exactly what you're going to test

421
00:27:14.091 --> 00:27:17.840
first and what you can dry test before you do any manufacturing.

422
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:22.790
Or are there options like teespring or otherwise that enable you to begin to

423
00:27:22.791 --> 00:27:27.260
kick the tires and see if what you think is gonna resonate and sell actually

424
00:27:27.261 --> 00:27:29.500
resonate itself,
so on and so forth.
Right.

425
00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:31.573
<v 3>No,</v>

426
00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.920
I have one more question that's not necessarily needed business or

427
00:27:36.921 --> 00:27:40.220
entrepreneurship related and hopefully it wouldn't be found a long winded answer

428
00:27:40.221 --> 00:27:41.054
either.

429
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:41.711
<v 4>Go for it.</v>

430
00:27:41.711 --> 00:27:46.510
I'll try to try to try to keep my inebriated as to a few sentences.

431
00:27:46.511 --> 00:27:47.344
Go for it.

432
00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:53.200
<v 3>How would you,
or have you
had a balance,</v>

433
00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:58.260
a caloric surplus intensive hypertrophy regimen and routine,

434
00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:04.420
but also mixed in intermittent fasting or Kenogenic?

435
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.270
Or is it just kind of,
you know,
they're binary.

436
00:28:07.271 --> 00:28:11.800
You're either doing one or the other of our 87,
the way to mix the two,

437
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:13.420
you know,
some capacity.

438
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.200
<v 4>Yeah,
I would say you're doing either,
well,
at least in my,</v>

439
00:28:16.201 --> 00:28:18.300
in my case you're doing one or the other.

440
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:22.290
So right now I'm in Tequila chocolate chip cookie,

441
00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:26.760
like bullshit caloric surplus mode because I've been having a tough week.

442
00:28:26.761 --> 00:28:31.530
So I've been just completely blowing every role and um,

443
00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:36.540
yeah,
basically aging and dying as quickly as possible while getting fat in the

444
00:28:36.541 --> 00:28:40.170
process.
So
yeah,

445
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.990
there's kind of that like garbage mode,
which is what I'm in right now.

446
00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.310
I try not to do that too,
too often,
but I'm,

447
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:49.880
I'm currently there cause I've had a motherfucker of a couple of weeks.
And uh,

448
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:54.120
then you have the programmatic hypertrophy,

449
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:59.130
uh,
likely high insulin growth mode,

450
00:28:59.131 --> 00:29:02.910
which is very much performance focused and not longevity focused.

451
00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:08.690
And I will schedule periods during which I achieve ketosis and that is very

452
00:29:11.941 --> 00:29:14.190
frequently through fasting.
So I will,

453
00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.890
and this is something that should be done with medical supervision,

454
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:22.220
but I will do generally speaking through a minimum of three contiguous days of

455
00:29:23.541 --> 00:29:25.110
fasting per month.

456
00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:28.800
And then I will do five to 10 day fast,

457
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:32.790
at least once per year,
ideally three to four times per year.

458
00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:38.370
And that is something that you should speak with your doctor about.
Uh,

459
00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:43.550
but otherwise I do not generally sustain long periods of ketosis because I find

460
00:29:44.831 --> 00:29:49.090
it so dietarily boring as all.
Fuck,

461
00:29:49.091 --> 00:29:51.610
it's awful.
It's really,
really boring.

462
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.520
And this is particularly true if you remove dairy,

463
00:29:54.521 --> 00:29:58.600
which I've tried to because my lipid profile goes sideways.

464
00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.720
If I consume cheese and dairy while in Ketosis,

465
00:30:01.721 --> 00:30:06.721
which is something that I've identified and which is not that uncommon in fact.

466
00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:09.700
So I treat the,

467
00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:15.270
I would say performance focused periods as quite separate from my longevity

468
00:30:17.681 --> 00:30:21.280
slash autophagy focused periods,
which could involve fasting.

469
00:30:21.281 --> 00:30:25.390
It could involve going hypo caloric,
it could involve intermittent fasting,

470
00:30:25.391 --> 00:30:29.220
it could involve fast mimicking diets,
Alaa,

471
00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:33.460
Victor Longo or any number of other things.

472
00:30:33.461 --> 00:30:36.550
I don't currently use anything like metformin or Rapamycin,

473
00:30:36.551 --> 00:30:41.200
but at some point could incorporate one or both of those and so on and so forth.

474
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:43.420
Uh,
but I do treat those as quite separate.

475
00:30:43.421 --> 00:30:48.421
Much like looking at bodybuilders going through say bulking and cutting phases.

476
00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.510
The,
although that's mostly aesthetically focused,

477
00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:56.820
certainly reflects a certain,
uh,

478
00:30:57.070 --> 00:31:02.070
caloric load and macronutrient ratio that I tend to alternate between.

479
00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.160
I don't,
I,
I don't try to achieve both at the same time.

480
00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.273
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

481
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:19.880
<v 3>I appreciate you giving me a call and do what he returned to helping me out.</v>

482
00:31:19.881 --> 00:31:22.860
I'm trying to help me get started in going.
And,
uh,

483
00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:24.550
the only thing I'm just curious and I was wondering,

484
00:31:24.551 --> 00:31:26.900
can I take you to lunch sometime ago in Salt Lake?

485
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:29.411
<v 4>Well,
you know what,</v>

486
00:31:29.411 --> 00:31:32.470
I might throw it up on social when I'm next there so you can keep an eye out for

487
00:31:32.471 --> 00:31:36.910
that,
but I can't make any promises beyond that.
However,

488
00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:40.660
uh,
I would like to ask that you just fucking get after it.

489
00:31:40.661 --> 00:31:42.820
So we're recording this on a Thursday,

490
00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:47.910
so I'd say this weekend and you are now an entrepreneur starting right now.

491
00:31:48.551 --> 00:31:53.551
So don't quit your job and get started on testing the rest of it and your off

492
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:55.023
hours.

493
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.823
<v 3>I appreciate it.</v>

494
00:31:56.990 --> 00:32:01.690
<v 4>Of course.
My pleasure.
Have a great night.
Hello.</v>

495
00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.300
Hello.
This is Joseph.

496
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:09.070
This is Joseph Timothy.
This is Timothy.

497
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.370
Good evening.
How are you sir?
I'm doing well.

498
00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:17.410
I am all yours.
So please fire away.
What can I help with?

499
00:32:17.411 --> 00:32:18.640
What can I answer if anything?

500
00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:25.010
<v 5>Like most people,
I'm sure.
I want to thank you for everything.
Um,</v>

501
00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:30.320
I found your book through the barbell shrugged guys.
Yeah.

502
00:32:30.321 --> 00:32:34.150
Good crew.
Yeah.
Um,
and,
uh,

503
00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:39.580
because of them I found podcasts and I found you and found your books and I've

504
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.050
become one of your,
uh,

505
00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:46.160
what thousand true fans as Kevin Kelly would say.
So thank you.

506
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:47.840
<v 1>Thank you for listening.</v>

507
00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:51.620
<v 5>Well,
thank you for doing what you do.
So,
um,</v>

508
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.220
so I know you,
you have a lot of projects and you're always,
um,

509
00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.070
got a shit ton of balls in the air.
Um,
you know,

510
00:33:01.071 --> 00:33:06.071
and I consider myself kind of a jack of many trades or a dilettante and training

511
00:33:06.141 --> 00:33:06.974
if you will.

512
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:12.070
And with that comes like I have a diverse group of interests and things I like

513
00:33:12.321 --> 00:33:15.920
to,
I'm always trying to pursue something different.
Um,

514
00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:19.820
and you've talked several times about the advice that you were given when it

515
00:33:19.821 --> 00:33:23.910
comes to picking projects that you only have like six rounds or bullets a year

516
00:33:23.911 --> 00:33:27.320
and to pull the trigger on.
Um,
and the more that you try to,

517
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:32.740
if you try anymore,
it pulls you in too many directions.
So,
uh,

518
00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:37.040
how do you pick projects and how do you know what to pull the trigger on and

519
00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:37.874
what to let go?

520
00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:42.940
Because I'm constantly trying to always look the next shiny object.

521
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:44.220
So

522
00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.260
<v 1>does a good question.</v>

523
00:33:45.261 --> 00:33:49.640
It's very timely for me as well because quite frankly I've taken on too many

524
00:33:49.641 --> 00:33:53.300
projects and also realize that many of the projects I'm working on currently,

525
00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.090
our legacy projects,
in other words,

526
00:33:57.050 --> 00:34:01.580
the reasons for starting them seemed valid a year ago,
two years ago,

527
00:34:01.581 --> 00:34:06.410
six months ago,
and now with new information,

528
00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:11.440
with the ability to test those projects,

529
00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:15.570
some of which have underperformed,
some of which have over performed,

530
00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:20.840
there's an inclination to continue doing those things.
We've invested a lot into,

531
00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:23.690
uh,
due to sunk cost fallacy and so on.

532
00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:29.120
And I'm at a point right now where I'm reassessing not only the projects that I

533
00:34:29.121 --> 00:34:30.680
might do new projects,

534
00:34:30.681 --> 00:34:35.450
but really putting under scrutiny a lot of my current projects and the way that

535
00:34:35.451 --> 00:34:39.590
I'm going about that right now is number one,

536
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:45.190
doing a lot of hypothetical journaling or it's actually real journaling,

537
00:34:46.641 --> 00:34:50.540
but based on hypothetical questions and namely,

538
00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:55.520
if I stop doing x,
what might be the upside?

539
00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:58.460
What might,
how,
how might it be a good thing or a great thing?

540
00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:03.530
Projects that I've put a lot of energy,
time,
capital resources into,
right?

541
00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:08.920
And forcing myself to write out a full page of bullets or a full page of

542
00:35:09.261 --> 00:35:14.261
sentences for each of these projects that is consuming a disproportionate amount

543
00:35:14.931 --> 00:35:19.220
of my time primarily.
So if we're looking at 80 20 analysis,

544
00:35:19.221 --> 00:35:23.060
which is something I come back to repeatedly,
Plato's law and so on for our work,

545
00:35:23.061 --> 00:35:25.440
we can elsewhere that I've written about it yet,
we're,

546
00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:29.390
I'll ask myself what are the 20% of projects right now that are consuming 80% or

547
00:35:29.391 --> 00:35:30.224
more of my time?

548
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:35.230
Or what are the 20% of projects or relationships that are currently producing

549
00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:40.770
80% or more of the phone calls,
conference calls,
email,

550
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.190
and other types of,
in most cases,
noise,
right?

551
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:48.960
And those go on the chopping block for consideration for elimination.

552
00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:52.440
And really what I've realized for myself and um,

553
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:57.500
but what I'm going through right now is recognizing that it's always easier to

554
00:35:57.931 --> 00:36:02.931
look at the shiny new project versus looking at your current roster and deciding

555
00:36:04.231 --> 00:36:07.470
which children to kill in terms as it relates to project.

556
00:36:07.471 --> 00:36:12.360
So I'm trying very hard not to say yes to new things until I've streamlined my

557
00:36:12.361 --> 00:36:14.100
current operations,
right?

558
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:17.520
If you're 10% from the breaking point at all times and you've take on more

559
00:36:17.521 --> 00:36:20.490
projects,
it's a foregone conclusion that eventually that's not going to work.

560
00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:25.140
And,
uh,
so currently I literally just did this last night.

561
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:29.380
I sit down,
I'm spending time on morning pages,
uh,
as,

562
00:36:29.381 --> 00:36:34.140
as I've written about before.
So Julia Cameron morning pages,
and,

563
00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:39.300
uh,
I'm also doing a
80,
an 80,

564
00:36:39.301 --> 00:36:42.220
20 analysis on the positive side.
Uh,
and that,

565
00:36:42.221 --> 00:36:45.510
that applies on a few different dimensions.
Number one is financial,
right?

566
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:50.230
So I'm looking at where the income is actually coming from and what are the,

567
00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:55.200
the handful of projects or activities in my case,
let's just say podcast,

568
00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.410
uh,
and a handful of other things,
uh,

569
00:36:58.411 --> 00:37:03.411
that generally generate the vast majority of monthly annual income.

570
00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.870
And then looking at ways to streamline that.
And the,

571
00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:12.900
the question that I would ask there,
which is something I've wrote about,

572
00:37:12.901 --> 00:37:17.790
I believe in tribe of mentors,
was what might this look like if it were easy?

573
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:20.180
Right?
So,
uh,
the,

574
00:37:20.181 --> 00:37:23.130
the way I'm answering your question maybe somewhat dissatisfying,

575
00:37:23.131 --> 00:37:26.760
but the point being that it's what I've learned over time is that you really

576
00:37:26.761 --> 00:37:31.761
need to basically put your current projects in front of the judge and jury for

577
00:37:34.651 --> 00:37:39.240
possible execution before you even consider what to say yes to in the new

578
00:37:39.241 --> 00:37:41.430
category on the new category.

579
00:37:41.431 --> 00:37:46.431
What I might look at our projects that are tasks that make the other possible

580
00:37:49.021 --> 00:37:53.250
projects and tasks either irrelevant or much easier.

581
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:57.210
For instance,
I'm looking at,
uh,
say,
uh,

582
00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:00.060
I'll give you a list of projects that could be on my plate.

583
00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:04.350
One would be doing a nother book similar to tribe of mentors,

584
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:09.400
or I have a hundred to 200 experts of various types weighing in,

585
00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.780
answering the same set of,
or a similar set of questions.

586
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:18.230
The next could be I work on a feature film screenplay that I then intend to

587
00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:25.140
produce and direct or at least produce to have some creative control over.

588
00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:29.640
Uh,
then I could put on that same list.

589
00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:34.890
I want to from soup to nuts,
start to finish,
beg,
borrow,

590
00:38:34.891 --> 00:38:39.891
and to get Robert Rodriguez attention to from the first word of the screenplay

591
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
to the finished product work on a handful of short films and and so on and so

592
00:38:45.551 --> 00:38:48.640
forth and what what if I look at those three,

593
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:53.110
I might decide that it's in my best interest to not do the the feature film

594
00:38:53.111 --> 00:38:58.060
first because I would learn so much through the process with Robert before doing

595
00:38:58.061 --> 00:38:58.810
that,

596
00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:03.810
that it would behoove me to tackle a handful of short films or even one or two

597
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:09.220
so that that will better inform the decisions I make with the higher stakes

598
00:39:09.221 --> 00:39:10.600
project,
which would be the feature film.

599
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:15.600
I made further decide that it makes sense to do another book where perhaps I

600
00:39:17.711 --> 00:39:22.711
invite the 20 to 50 figures and entertainment and feature film and so on who I

601
00:39:24.281 --> 00:39:28.870
might lay a lot to collaborate with to contribute in some fashion.
Right.

602
00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:29.890
And in that sense,

603
00:39:29.891 --> 00:39:34.330
I think about the logical progression that will make each subsequent project

604
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:38.080
easier.
And I remember I heard it said at one point,

605
00:39:38.081 --> 00:39:41.050
this might have been from Tony Robbins,
but I may be misattributing it,

606
00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:45.430
that we could have been who knows any number of people in any case,

607
00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:50.930
ineffective that we overestimate what we can achieve say in a day or a month,

608
00:39:51.281 --> 00:39:54.610
but we underestimate what we can get done in three to five years or 10 years.

609
00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.530
And for me it's come down to realizing that you can do,

610
00:39:59.531 --> 00:40:02.110
you can actually do everything just about everything.

611
00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.790
You just can't do it at the same time.

612
00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:08.790
So you have to figure out the logical progression that puts you ahead and when

613
00:40:09.791 --> 00:40:10.271
in doubt,

614
00:40:10.271 --> 00:40:15.100
choosing projects that help you to develop skills and relationships that

615
00:40:15.101 --> 00:40:19.330
transcend any single given project because you might look at,

616
00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.350
for instance,
a single project liked four hour chef,

617
00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:26.980
which was a tremendous amount of work.
It was a huge investment of time.

618
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:30.760
It was a suicidal schedule,
very proud of the outcome.

619
00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.100
But ultimately from a commercial standpoint,

620
00:40:33.101 --> 00:40:36.190
because it was the first major acquisition and through Amazon publishing,

621
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:40.260
it was boycotted everywhere and the sales were,

622
00:40:40.261 --> 00:40:42.280
were quite disappointing to me,

623
00:40:42.281 --> 00:40:46.780
certainly because we didn't have the distribution necessary and you could look

624
00:40:46.781 --> 00:40:51.070
at that as an abject failure.
But in doing that for print distribution,

625
00:40:51.071 --> 00:40:56.071
I got to know the people at Hmh Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,

626
00:40:56.171 --> 00:41:00.220
which then went on to publish tools of titans and tribe of mentors,

627
00:41:00.221 --> 00:41:01.690
both of which ended up being number one.

628
00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:06.280
So I develop the relationship with those people,
was able to kick the tires,

629
00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:10.620
learn their strengths and weaknesses while also developing other skills.

630
00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:15.250
Then later informed bigger projects,
arguably speaking.
Uh,
so that's,

631
00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:20.110
that's a long answer,
but I would encourage you to also pick up a book.

632
00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:23.800
It's very short.
I've read it dozens of times called the effective executive.

633
00:41:23.801 --> 00:41:28.270
In fact,
saying it right now makes me realize that I should reread it myself.

634
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:32.960
But the effective executive by Peter Drucker would be one place,
uh,

635
00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:37.460
that I would also turn to as a resource when trying to make decisions about your

636
00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:42.190
time,
which ultimately every decision or almost every decision comes down to.
Um,

637
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.033
so those would be,

638
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:48.250
those would be a few guidelines that I would suggest,

639
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:51.200
uh,
at least as having been helpful for me in the past.

640
00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:52.923
<v 5>So</v>

641
00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:59.100
basically figuring out what you're doing that's sucking all the energy that you

642
00:41:59.101 --> 00:42:02.850
could be using on something that you would care more about and get rid of those

643
00:42:02.851 --> 00:42:05.310
and then go back and,
uh,

644
00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:09.810
when you're picking new projects and figure out what your end goal is and figure

645
00:42:09.811 --> 00:42:13.830
out the best project that will get you the skill to get you the end goal,

646
00:42:13.831 --> 00:42:15.690
even if it doesn't take you directly there.

647
00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.330
<v 1>Right.
The,
the,</v>

648
00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:22.350
the progression of projects that will get you to one longer term objective,

649
00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.520
even if it's just a placeholder,
that may totally change.

650
00:42:27.521 --> 00:42:31.510
But as long as you're amassing skills and developing relationships,

651
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:36.070
those are more adaptable than is important.

652
00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:39.640
The report card for any single project,
at least of your thinking longer term.

653
00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:45.190
So that would make sense.
Yeah,
that'd be my recommendation.
Uh,
all right.

654
00:42:45.191 --> 00:42:50.170
If you have one more that short,
I'll take a stab at it.
But otherwise,
uh,
we can,

655
00:42:50.171 --> 00:42:52.510
uh,
we can decide how to do it before

656
00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:56.930
<v 5>you always talk about your five people.
Who are your five people?</v>

657
00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:02.290
<v 1>Yeah,
this is a,
a good question.
And the five people change.
Uh,
so I,</v>

658
00:43:02.291 --> 00:43:06.000
I would say that very often they are.
I mean,

659
00:43:06.001 --> 00:43:10.710
they're almost always close friends of mine just by,
by virtue of the question,

660
00:43:10.711 --> 00:43:12.450
you know,
who are the five people you associate with most?

661
00:43:12.451 --> 00:43:16.260
And for those people who don't have the context,
uh,
I,

662
00:43:16.261 --> 00:43:17.550
and many other people have said,
you know,

663
00:43:17.551 --> 00:43:19.770
you are the average of the five people you associate with most,

664
00:43:19.771 --> 00:43:23.930
whether it's physically,
emotionally,
psychologically,
whatever it might be.
Uh,

665
00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:25.260
remotely.

666
00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:30.120
I still spend a lot of time with close friends of mine who I admire and aspire

667
00:43:30.121 --> 00:43:33.840
to be more like in certain ways.
Neval Robert Kahn,
Kevin Rose,

668
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:36.900
Matt Mullenweg would,
would all be on my list.

669
00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:42.180
Then looking at say people closer to me geographically now since I live in

670
00:43:42.181 --> 00:43:44.850
Austin,
Texas,
you would have Robert Rodriguez,

671
00:43:44.851 --> 00:43:49.851
I think Aubrey Marcus CEO of on it actually has a lot figured out and not only

672
00:43:50.041 --> 00:43:54.540
figured out but implemented in a very systematic way that,
uh,

673
00:43:54.541 --> 00:43:59.250
is,
is hard to appreciate until you've actually spent a lot of time around him.

674
00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:03.240
Uh,
and so forth and so on.
Uh,

675
00:44:03.241 --> 00:44:06.030
I would say ray Daleo is also on that list.
I don't,

676
00:44:06.031 --> 00:44:08.070
I don't spend as much time with him as I would like,

677
00:44:08.071 --> 00:44:13.071
but certainly from a reasoning from and planning from first principles

678
00:44:13.261 --> 00:44:16.590
perspective,
one of the more impressive guys that you'll ever come across.

679
00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:21.120
So those are a few folks on my list and they all have a lot of writing and

680
00:44:21.121 --> 00:44:22.080
recording out there.

681
00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:26.840
So it's possible to learn from them even if you don't know them directly.
Uh,

682
00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:28.650
all right,
my friend.
Well,

683
00:44:28.651 --> 00:44:31.950
I'll tell you what I need to keep drinking and keep so you have

684
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.890
<v 4>a wonderful night and appreciate the questions.</v>

685
00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.250
Hi,
is this Regina?

686
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.690
<v 6>Oh my God,
this,
hi.</v>

687
00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:46.160
<v 4>It's,
it's uh,
this is Tim Ferriss.</v>

688
00:44:46.161 --> 00:44:49.440
I'm looking at your area code is late as hell.
Where you are?
I'm not going to,

689
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:55.950
<v 6>yeah,
I um,
yeah,
it's,
it's late,
but it's okay.</v>

690
00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:03.990
<v 4>No,
you are my last call of the evening,
so I appreciate you being awake.</v>

691
00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:07.050
Are you game for a short conversation?

692
00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:08.230
<v 6>I am.
Yeah.</v>

693
00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:12.350
<v 4>All right,
perfect.
Well,
I guess,
uh,
I guess it's what does,</v>

694
00:45:12.351 --> 00:45:15.200
it is probably like two 30 in the morning or something like that where you are

695
00:45:15.201 --> 00:45:20.030
maybe one,
one 30 in the morning.
In any case,
uh,
I am,

696
00:45:20.031 --> 00:45:20.720
uh,

697
00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:25.310
well warmed up and happy to try to answer any questions that you might have.

698
00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:29.450
I can't make any quality guarantees,
but I will certainly give it a shot.

699
00:45:29.451 --> 00:45:30.740
So how can I help?

700
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:34.210
<v 6>So first,
thank you for calling my pleasure.
Um,</v>

701
00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:40.290
and I guess my first question is whose I am the last call,

702
00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.800
how much have you partaken?

703
00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.073
<v 4>Ah,</v>

704
00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:50.830
fine question I've had and I would say five moderate glasses of Tequila and

705
00:45:54.321 --> 00:45:59.300
soda.
So I am,
I'm very much,
uh,

706
00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:04.820
I'm not going to say levitating,
but uh,
I feel light on my feet,

707
00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:08.120
which I think is more a reflection of the alcohol than anything else,

708
00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:12.920
but I'm not completely incoherent,
so it's a good middle ground.
I would say

709
00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:18.350
<v 6>that's decent.
Then I guess my question for you,</v>

710
00:46:18.351 --> 00:46:21.050
it would be a good one because I would have a hard problem with it.

711
00:46:21.051 --> 00:46:26.051
How do you come up with questions to ask people to ask the right questions to be

712
00:46:26.481 --> 00:46:31.481
a good interviewer so that you are getting to know them very well or getting the

713
00:46:31.551 --> 00:46:34.970
right answers or the answers they're interesting for your listeners.

714
00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:40.910
<v 4>The way I approach that is not thinking of my listeners at all.
Quite frankly.</v>

715
00:46:40.911 --> 00:46:44.540
I asked the questions that relate to

716
00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:51.100
personal pains or personal goals or dreams that I have and I assume that that

717
00:46:52.281 --> 00:46:54.530
will apply to some percentage of my listeners,

718
00:46:54.531 --> 00:46:58.700
but it's a very personal journey for me.

719
00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:00.420
And,
uh,
there,
there,

720
00:47:00.421 --> 00:47:04.760
there there's a bit more planning to it in the sense that if I'm talking to

721
00:47:04.761 --> 00:47:07.310
someone who is very,
very frequently interviewed,

722
00:47:07.311 --> 00:47:10.820
who has a lot of public exposure,
then I will try to avoid questions.

723
00:47:10.821 --> 00:47:15.590
They were frequently asked for the first say 20 to 30 minutes of the interview.

724
00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:16.640
Uh,

725
00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:21.590
but if we're looking at the overarching approach,

726
00:47:21.591 --> 00:47:26.591
I would say it is intense curiosity and a focus on my own personal needs that

727
00:47:28.131 --> 00:47:30.520
drives the questions I ask.

728
00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:32.960
<v 6>Okay.
Right.
That makes sense.</v>

729
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:37.910
You've been asked quite a lot of questions and you've told us quite a lot.
Um,

730
00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:43.100
I guess over the years about things that probably we already had Ashton's for.

731
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:43.670
Um,

732
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:47.090
I would like to know the attitude because I struggle with that just in general

733
00:47:47.091 --> 00:47:50.270
personally because I'm more of a listener than a talker.

734
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:55.990
So I'm even amongst like the thought of dating or a friend or something like

735
00:47:56.211 --> 00:47:58.550
that.
I find that hard to come up with questions,

736
00:47:58.551 --> 00:48:02.300
then make the other person feel like I'm interested because I'm usually the type

737
00:48:02.301 --> 00:48:07.301
of person that's like anything that I'm told or how things just unfold naturally

738
00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:12.620
is how I,
um,
I guess I feel comfortable.
Yes.
Learning about someone.

739
00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:15.330
<v 4>The questions don't have to be,
yeah.
I mean,</v>

740
00:48:15.331 --> 00:48:20.331
the questions don't have to be sophisticated at all.

741
00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:24.990
In fact,
one way to ask questions is just to be quiet.

742
00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:29.340
So I was told by cal Fussman who wrote the,

743
00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:34.370
what I learned column for Esquire for decades and primarily wrote that column,

744
00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:36.850
interviewed everyone from Jewish clean,

745
00:48:36.851 --> 00:48:40.830
neat and corporate chef to a prison in a Bush and so on.

746
00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:45.210
And every single celebrity in between,
he told me at one point,

747
00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:46.590
let the silence do the work.

748
00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:50.610
You don't have to ask questions per se to be a good conversationalist,

749
00:48:50.611 --> 00:48:52.410
but there are also very,

750
00:48:52.411 --> 00:48:57.411
very short questions that you can ask following almost any statement from

751
00:48:58.201 --> 00:49:02.400
someone else,
such as,
you know,
what did you learn from that?

752
00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:06.420
Or how did that make you feel?
Uh,
they're,
they're very,

753
00:49:06.421 --> 00:49:11.310
very short questions that you can ask that can then prompt someone to talk for

754
00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:14.220
two to five to 10 minutes.
Uh,

755
00:49:14.221 --> 00:49:19.221
it doesn't have to be anything groundbreaking or particularly innovative in,

756
00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:21.803
in fact,

757
00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:25.980
if you try to come up with really clever questions at very often comes off as

758
00:49:25.981 --> 00:49:28.530
disingenuous or artificial.
Uh,

759
00:49:28.531 --> 00:49:32.130
so simple tends to work really well in my experience.

760
00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:37.290
<v 6>Okay.
Um,
well I guess like the piggy back off of that,
my other,
um,</v>

761
00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:41.470
things that I always feel like I'm asking a question that might be a little too

762
00:49:41.471 --> 00:49:43.750
personal.
Do you ever feel that way?

763
00:49:43.751 --> 00:49:46.600
Like when you're thinking of things as long as the conversation,

764
00:49:46.601 --> 00:49:48.880
like how do I ask this question or is this too much

765
00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:53.470
<v 4>will be an example of a question you might ask that would be too personal</v>

766
00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.680
<v 6>sometimes.
I guess it's for me,</v>

767
00:49:56.681 --> 00:50:01.480
I'm the type of person that I grew up like as a child and I was younger.

768
00:50:01.481 --> 00:50:03.760
I grew up with a lot of like my family members being older than me because I'm

769
00:50:03.761 --> 00:50:04.594
the youngest.

770
00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:08.080
I was always in that situation where it was like a child safe and a child's

771
00:50:08.081 --> 00:50:11.360
please,
you don't ask that question or you know,
um,

772
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:13.150
you only talk when spoken to kind of thing,

773
00:50:13.151 --> 00:50:16.870
like when I was younger and it's kind of rolled over.

774
00:50:16.871 --> 00:50:21.871
So he mean even something as simple as if I'm dating someone or like asking

775
00:50:22.031 --> 00:50:25.060
questions,
get to know each other,
I'm asking anything.

776
00:50:25.061 --> 00:50:29.300
Like how to know which question is asking about the past or asking about,

777
00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:33.620
you know,
past people they feed it or things like that.

778
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:37.070
Like how,
you know,
what happened at the end of the last relationship.

779
00:50:37.071 --> 00:50:41.090
Like sometimes I feel like that question might be a little too personal for

780
00:50:41.091 --> 00:50:41.920
someone.

781
00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:46.280
I'm just asking them off of that and I kind of wait for that conversation to be

782
00:50:46.281 --> 00:50:49.830
brought up by them so that it's bought it online,
they're comfortable with.
Um,

783
00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.580
so I guess that kind of stops me from asking a lot of the questions.

784
00:50:52.581 --> 00:50:55.280
I am curious because I don't want to come off too forward.

785
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:58.840
<v 4>Uh,
well I don't know if the question is too personal.</v>

786
00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:03.230
They might just be too early.
Right.
So,
yeah,

787
00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.800
in a context like that,

788
00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:11.220
you don't want to jump from like the intellectual equivalent of like a pat on

789
00:51:11.381 --> 00:51:14.590
the shoulder to like heavy petting and 10 seconds flat.
Right?

790
00:51:14.591 --> 00:51:18.880
You don't want to just emote emotionally sideswipe someone we're like,
Holy Shit,

791
00:51:18.881 --> 00:51:22.150
like this woman's asking me about like my most embarrassing,

792
00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:26.560
humiliating moment of my life and we barely got drinks already.
Right?
Okay,

793
00:51:26.561 --> 00:51:29.920
this is,
this is,
this is too much for me to handle.
Uh,

794
00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:33.730
is that the only context?
Are there other contexts?

795
00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.670
Is it primarily in a dating context that you're concerned about this?

796
00:51:36.671 --> 00:51:38.620
Are there other contexts where this affects you?

797
00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:45.090
<v 6>Um,
well,
for the past year I'm still learning how to be a travel agent.
So,</v>

798
00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:47.970
you know,
like in sales it's just asking them qualifying questions,

799
00:51:47.971 --> 00:51:52.800
asking the right questions.
I'm asking questions to build rapport.
So,

800
00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:56.030
um,
sometimes you know,
like you're bringing someone,

801
00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:59.880
then some people tell you things that you may not have you been wanting to know,

802
00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:03.360
but they just kind of roll along with the conversation and they let themselves,

803
00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:06.300
like they just talk.
And that's kind of where I feel more comfortable.

804
00:52:06.301 --> 00:52:11.160
But then when it's an essence where you have someone who you want to try it,

805
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:12.840
because I'm kind of an introvert,

806
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:16.490
so it's a lot easier for me to listen to someone else talk when they just want

807
00:52:16.491 --> 00:52:21.491
me to try to facilitate that conversation to make it flow so that it does seem

808
00:52:21.841 --> 00:52:24.930
natural.
Like I'm having a conversation with them,

809
00:52:24.931 --> 00:52:28.090
but also getting information I need to give them,
um,

810
00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:31.650
the product that they're looking for because they don't know necessarily what

811
00:52:31.651 --> 00:52:33.060
they're looking for.
That's why they've come to us.

812
00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:35.640
If I have to ask them the questions to get those answers,

813
00:52:35.641 --> 00:52:38.150
to provide something that makes them feel like I understand.

814
00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:39.380
<v 4>Yeah,
totally.
Uh,</v>

815
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:44.430
so the first and foremost being an introvert is not a handicap.

816
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:47.290
Uh,
I am very much,

817
00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:51.070
I would do myself as an introvert who can pretend to be an extrovert for limited

818
00:52:51.071 --> 00:52:55.600
periods of time.
Yeah.
Don't get fancy.
So for instance,

819
00:52:55.601 --> 00:53:00.340
when someone's telling you something,
you can just say,
tell me more about that.

820
00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:06.310
Really give me the,
give me an example.
Could you tell me more about that?

821
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:11.380
How does that make you feel?
Why is this important?
I mean,
there are,

822
00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.660
there are questions like that which are very,

823
00:53:13.661 --> 00:53:18.661
very simple that keeps someone talking and eventually they're going to give you

824
00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:24.720
that nugget of information that helps you to better design a solution for them

825
00:53:26.311 --> 00:53:30.750
or find the answer to a specific need they had that which they couldn't

826
00:53:30.751 --> 00:53:34.170
articulate.
If you simply ask them what do you need,

827
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:38.130
they wouldn't be able to give you the right answer.
Uh,

828
00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:43.180
so I w I mean if you really just had five to 10 of these followup questions

829
00:53:44.491 --> 00:53:46.460
noted down on a piece of paper in front of you,

830
00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:48.480
you would be able to pick and choose,
which,
by the way,

831
00:53:48.481 --> 00:53:50.700
is exactly what I often do or did,

832
00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:55.920
at least for the first hundred podcasts that I,
I don't on this show.

833
00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:59.220
So it's,
it's,
there's no shame in that.

834
00:53:59.221 --> 00:54:01.230
I think that it's very,

835
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:06.560
very helpful to have a goto portfolio of followup questions,

836
00:54:07.111 --> 00:54:11.160
which are very,
very short and very,
very simple to keep people talking,

837
00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:15.700
uh,
in,
in at least a sales context.
And that's true for a,

838
00:54:15.701 --> 00:54:17.460
my experience for dating as well.

839
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.650
If you didn't want to ask about how their last relationship ended,
right?

840
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:28.050
You could ask them like,
well how did you end up using Tinder?
Like how,

841
00:54:28.051 --> 00:54:31.740
how long have you been doing Dah,
Dah,
uh,
what led you to that?
Right?

842
00:54:31.741 --> 00:54:34.590
You can ask questions which get them to the same end,

843
00:54:34.591 --> 00:54:39.000
which out with without coming off as like the psycho who's going for the juggler

844
00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:42.690
right away.
Do you know what I mean?
And like,
trust me,
I've,
I've been there,

845
00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:47.370
I've been that person.
Right?
Like I get it.
But it's like you can,
you can,

846
00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:52.400
you can kind of tip toe around it while leading them to the story of what

847
00:54:53.911 --> 00:54:58.911
brought them to where they are today without being exceptionally direct about

848
00:54:59.431 --> 00:55:02.250
it.
And for instance,

849
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:07.400
if I'm interviewing someone who's dealt with a scandal and my podcast isn't

850
00:55:07.981 --> 00:55:09.810
about scandals,
it's not about Gotcha.

851
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:14.870
But maybe I want to explore the emotional terrain that reflects how they reacted

852
00:55:15.751 --> 00:55:19.930
to some very difficult set of circumstances.
If I,

853
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:21.990
if I ask them directly,

854
00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:27.800
how did you respond to this event that happened when such and such person

855
00:55:28.231 --> 00:55:31.140
accused you of such and such thing,
they're going to shut down.

856
00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:32.910
That is a nonstarter.

857
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:38.510
But if I asked them and I know something happened within the last three years

858
00:55:38.881 --> 00:55:41.250
and I asked them,
you know,
could you,
could you tell me,

859
00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:46.650
people listening to this podcast will think based on your bio,

860
00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:50.610
based on all the successes you've had,
that every time you step up to the plate,

861
00:55:50.611 --> 00:55:51.660
you hit home runs.

862
00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:56.940
And I feel like that is inspiring on one hand,
but very,

863
00:55:57.580 --> 00:56:01.890
uh,
intimidating on the other.
So I'd like to try to humanize you a bit.

864
00:56:01.891 --> 00:56:06.891
Can you tell us about a really difficult situation or a circumstance in the last

865
00:56:07.801 --> 00:56:11.550
handful of years and how you responded to it?
Right.

866
00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:17.090
Framing it that way opens the door to allow them to introduce it without hitting

867
00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:22.960
them with a full frontal assault that is going to make them defensive.
Right.

868
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.100
That makes sense.

869
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:24.800
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

870
00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:25.580
<v 4>So that's,</v>

871
00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:30.380
that's an indirect way to approach something that allows someone else to feel

872
00:56:30.381 --> 00:56:33.530
like they're taking the initiative and introducing a topic that may be

873
00:56:33.531 --> 00:56:34.610
uncomfortable to them.

874
00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:39.990
<v 6>And I think that's my biggest problem is because I'm afraid to ask the question</v>

875
00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:43.890
in any way and then the other person may be,

876
00:56:43.891 --> 00:56:48.720
feels like all of us,
you know,
she's not a good conversation or she doesn't care,

877
00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:49.740
um,

878
00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:54.090
to ask anything about me because she never asked any questions that are deeper

879
00:56:54.091 --> 00:56:55.320
than the typical question.

880
00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:59.730
So I can ask him direct questions that makes a conversation start falling and

881
00:56:59.731 --> 00:57:01.610
gives them control over what they tell me.

882
00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:07.950
<v 4>Furthermore,
I would,
I would recommend that you practice when it doesn't matter,</v>

883
00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:11.340
right?
So don't just practice with sales prospects.

884
00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:14.670
Don't just practice with people you're dating,

885
00:57:14.671 --> 00:57:18.090
you have the hots for and that you want to have babies with.
Don't do that.

886
00:57:18.091 --> 00:57:21.180
Like wait,
like actually,
you know what I mean?
Where you're like,
oh my God,

887
00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:24.540
this one could be the one.
Like that's not the time to practice.

888
00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:30.660
The time to practice is when you hear like talking to like fucking Joe blow in

889
00:57:30.661 --> 00:57:32.460
line at Starbucks.
You're like,
I don't give a shit.

890
00:57:32.461 --> 00:57:35.940
Well this guy thinks like that's the time,
that's the time to practice.

891
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:39.460
And it's this,
it's the same skillset.

892
00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:44.480
It is the same tool kit is the same portfolio of Goto questions that you can

893
00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:49.170
utilize on a regular basis.
So you develop a level,

894
00:57:49.350 --> 00:57:54.350
a baseline level of comfort with this repertoire so that you can then as second

895
00:57:55.351 --> 00:58:00.180
nature,
use it very naturally when it matters.
So that would be my,

896
00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:04.170
one of my recommendations is practice when it doesn't matter

897
00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:11.220
whether that is negotiating a pickup line,

898
00:58:11.221 --> 00:58:15.390
a follow up question,
a simple way of bridging one topic to the next,

899
00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:18.960
really go out of your way to practice when it doesn't matter.

900
00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:22.100
<v 6>Okay.
Yeah,
that makes,
that makes sense.</v>

901
00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:24.500
So then my other question would be

902
00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:31.670
how I'd actually don't have a lot of situations where I could ask those

903
00:58:31.671 --> 00:58:35.200
questions where it doesn't matter because I pretty much just go to work,

904
00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:39.770
go to the gym and then come home.
Yeah.
So,

905
00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:44.440
I mean,
well actually I guess I've kind of already been doing that.
Um,
cause I,

906
00:58:44.441 --> 00:58:48.920
I cross it so it's know like eight people,
10 people,
um,
with the classes,

907
00:58:48.930 --> 00:58:50.000
the times that I go to.

908
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:55.010
And I've kind of already been trying to talk more with people at class as

909
00:58:55.011 --> 00:58:58.190
opposed to just like going to class,
going to the shower and leaving.
Um,

910
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:59.630
and I'll kind of already been doing that.

911
00:58:59.631 --> 00:59:04.631
But I guess I can start making those fat list of followup questions that help

912
00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:09.330
move the conversation along to get to know people aren't talking about.
Um,

913
00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:11.540
that definitely helps having things set already.

914
00:59:11.541 --> 00:59:15.320
Cause I work better that way when I kind of already know how I'm supposed to do

915
00:59:15.321 --> 00:59:16.154
things.

916
00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:20.070
<v 4>Yeah.
I mean you have a right getting index card,</v>

917
00:59:20.071 --> 00:59:24.140
write down the five questions and just make it happen.

918
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:27.230
You're not going to find time to do it.
So you have to create time to do it.

919
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:31.910
And that could be,
you know,

920
00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:36.680
the boyfriend watching the dog while his girlfriend's doing some,
God awful,

921
00:59:37.070 --> 00:59:40.590
you know,
Francis crossfit workout or whatever.
Well it's all right.

922
00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:42.800
That's the guy you're like,
all right,
that's my dude.

923
00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:45.200
That's the guy I'm practicing on.
Walk over like,
Hey,

924
00:59:45.201 --> 00:59:48.380
what's your fucking dogs name?
Oh,
cool.
Really?
Like,
how'd you choose that dog?

925
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:52.070
Oh Wow.
What's the story behind that?
Right.
That's another good question.

926
00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:56.990
Like what's the story behind that?
Huh?
How'd you decide on why?
Huh?

927
00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:00.640
That's interesting.
That's interesting to me.
Tell me more about that.
Like,

928
01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:04.490
tell me more about that as such a lazy,
useful statement.

929
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.590
How did you decide that?
How did that make you feel?
That sounds crazy.

930
01:00:09.591 --> 01:00:13.400
I don't know how I'd respond to that.
Okay,
boom.
And then you got another three.

931
01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:17.120
You just bought a three to five minute story and just practice that stuff.

932
01:00:17.121 --> 01:00:19.090
You have to,
you're not going to find time to do it,

933
01:00:19.091 --> 01:00:23.120
so you have to make time to do it.
If you make it a priority,
it will serve you.

934
01:00:23.121 --> 01:00:26.140
If you don't make it a priority,
it's not going to help you.
Uh,

935
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:30.350
so that would be in my drunken stupor,
Yodel,

936
01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.030
like line that may or may not help.

937
01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.920
I think that was a very coherent

938
01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.810
answer.

939
01:00:44.010 --> 01:00:45.320
A fantastic,

940
01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:49.490
well I should let you get some sleep and I should probably also take my dog out

941
01:00:49.491 --> 01:00:54.110
for a walk and do the same thing.
So,
uh,
I think

942
01:00:55.790 --> 01:01:00.620
my pleasure and good luck this stuff.
Honestly listen to my first few podcasts,

943
01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:05.030
especially the first one when Kevin Rose busting my balls.
It's rough.

944
01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:08.690
It's really,
really rough.
This is a craft.

945
01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:13.720
This is something you can learn and practice and I really believe anyone can get

946
01:01:16.641 --> 01:01:21.530
better at it because it is so straight forward.

947
01:01:21.531 --> 01:01:22.820
If you make the time,

948
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:27.740
how you can deliver a questions to humans you encounter,
it's not,

949
01:01:28.090 --> 01:01:31.370
it's not difficult or it's not complex.

950
01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:36.380
You just have to put yourself out there and endure a small amount of discomfort

951
01:01:36.381 --> 01:01:38.600
with the uncertainty of how someone will respond.

952
01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:43.160
And if you're willing to do that,
you can get a lot better at this in a very,

953
01:01:43.161 --> 01:01:47.360
very short period of time.
Hey guys,
this is Tim again.

954
01:01:47.361 --> 01:01:50.570
Just a few more things before you take off.
Number one,

955
01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:55.700
this is five bullet Friday.
Do you want to get a short email from me?

956
01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:59.900
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

957
01:01:59.901 --> 01:02:03.220
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Fridays,

958
01:02:03.221 --> 01:02:07.790
a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

959
01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:09.050
pondering over the week.

960
01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:12.080
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

961
01:02:12.081 --> 01:02:15.530
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

962
01:02:15.531 --> 01:02:19.860
somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric I do.

963
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:25.130
<v 7>It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my</v>

964
01:02:25.801 --> 01:02:28.530
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

965
01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:33.570
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

966
01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:35.820
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

967
01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:40.740
Just go to four hour work week.com that's four hour work week.com all spelled

968
01:02:40.741 --> 01:02:43.920

Tim,

998
01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:26.610
this episode of the Tim Ferriss show is brought to you by linked in.

999
01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:30.600
More specifically,
I'm referring to Linkedin's job recruitment platform,

1000
01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:34.200
which is a great way to find and hire the quality talent that you need in your

1001
01:04:34.201 --> 01:04:36.540
organization.
You already know,
of course,

1002
01:04:36.541 --> 01:04:39.600
Linkedin as the world's largest professional network,

1003
01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:44.690
and in fact 70% of the US workforce is already on Linkedin in 22 million

1004
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:50.190
professionals.
View and apply to jobs on linkedin every week given those numbers.

1005
01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:53.580
It's not surprising at all that there've been hundreds of thousands of

1006
01:04:53.581 --> 01:04:57.750
businesses that have posted to linkedin jobs over the past year alone,

1007
01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:01.800
and because linkedin considers skills,
experiences location and much more,

1008
01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:06.360
they just have better data to match and promote your job to potential
candidates.

1009
01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:09.510
The most qualified candidates,
unlike other generic job boards,

1010
01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:14.220
businesses have rated linked in jobs 40% better than job boards at delivering

1011
01:05:14.221 --> 01:05:16.020
quality candidates.
Let's check it out.
