00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.850
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:06.210
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.890
You posting a question?

4
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.600
I'm a cybernetic organism.

5
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.120
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by Peloton,</v>

6
00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:27.770
which I've been using probably for about a year now.

7
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.000
Peloton is a cutting edge indoor cycling bike that brings live studio classes

8
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:35.150
right into your home.
You can also do on demand,
which is what I do.

9
00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:38.900
We'll come back to that so you don't have to worry about fitting classes into a

10
00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:42.890
busy schedule or making it to a studio or gym with a hectic or unpredictable

11
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:44.480
commute.
I,
for instance,

12
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.650
have a Peloton bike right in my master bedroom at home and it's one of the first

13
00:00:48.651 --> 00:00:52.370
things I do.
Many mornings I wake up and meditate for a bit.

14
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.930
Then I knock out a short 20 minute ride in my undies.
Hard to do that at the gym,

15
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.660
take a shower,
and I'm in higher gear for the rest of the day.

16
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.470
It's really convenient and has become something that I look forward to.
See.

17
00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:05.630
You have a lot of options for one if you'd like.

18
00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:09.140
You can ride live with thousands of other writers across the country on an

19
00:01:09.141 --> 00:01:11.210
interactive leaderboard to keep him motivated.

20
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.580
There are also up to 14 new classes added every day with more than 8,000 classes

21
00:01:16.731 --> 00:01:21.710
on demand and you can pick based on length,
45 minutes,
20 minutes,
whatever music,

22
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:26.000
hip hop,
rock and roll or say low impact versus high intensity or interval.

23
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.160
You can pick the class structure and style that works for you and in my case I

24
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:35.450
quite like Matt Wilbur's and I tend to do on demand and listened to a lot of and

25
00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:37.640
watch many of the same classes over and over,

26
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.520
but I'm kind of promiscuous and also enjoy classes from a lot of the other

27
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:41.354
instructors.

28
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.650
They have Peloton and amazing roster of incredible instructors in New York City

29
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.980
with a whole range of styles and personalities so you can find what you're in

30
00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:49.814
the mood for.

31
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.810
You also get real time metrics that you can use to track your performance over

32
00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:58.670
time and that will help,
I would say,
catalyze you to beat your personal best.

33
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:01.730
Now that all sounds good,
right?
Gamification,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada.

34
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.990
I didn't think that it would work for me or in any way incentivize me,

35
00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:09.530
but they really 100% hit the nail on the head.
I was very,

36
00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:14.531
very impressed with how motivating it was and it worked tremendously to keep me

37
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:19.490
pushing,
uh,
which quite honestly takes a fair amount.
I can get quite lazy,

38
00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:22.070
particularly with anything that edges on endurance,

39
00:02:22.071 --> 00:02:26.390
which is kind of more than five reps of anything for me.
So check it out.

This episode is brought to you by legal zoom,

48
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.720
which more than 2 million Americans have used to help start their businesses.

49
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.220
Past guests even such as,
well,
wordpress lead developer,

50
00:03:11.221 --> 00:03:15.480
CEO of Automattic,
Matt Mullenweg now valued at more than a billion dollars,

51
00:03:15.481 --> 00:03:18.060
have used legal zoom to help with their business needs,

52
00:03:18.061 --> 00:03:20.190
specifically in his case to form his company,

53
00:03:20.191 --> 00:03:23.280
but legal zoom isn't just for launching your business.

54
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.390
Their services include everything from helping you to manage changing tax laws,

55
00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:31.950
reviewing contracts,
creating Ndas,
nondisclosure agreements,
important stuff,

56
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.810
handling lease agreements and assisting with really any other legal challenge,

57
00:03:36.811 --> 00:03:41.250
hurdle,
inconvenience that typically takes time and effort away from running your

58
00:03:41.251 --> 00:03:42.084
business.

59
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.540
The best part is that you won't get charged by the hour because legal zoom isn't

60
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.201
a law firm,

61
00:03:46.201 --> 00:03:51.201
so they won't be running the clock up and spinning circles just to raise your

62
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.980
bill.
Instead,

63
00:03:52.981 --> 00:03:56.550
they just ask you to pay one low upfront price for whatever it is that you're

64
00:03:56.551 --> 00:03:57.990
looking to get all the card style.

68
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.230
I don't know what the special savings is folks,
but it's titillating.

69

72
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.500
Hello boys and girls.

73
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:32.500
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

74
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:37.360
it is my job each episode to interview and deconstruct world class performers

75
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.380
and or people who are the best of what they do to tease out the life lessons,

76
00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:45.610
habits,
tools,
and so on that you can hopefully apply to your own lives.

77
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:48.610
And this episode was such a treat for me.

78
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:52.360
I had so much fun and I was able to interview a living legend.

79
00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:56.440
Someone I've wanted to interview on this podcast for many years.

80
00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.450
Stanislav Grof and we went deep.
We went long,

81
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:06.040
we went wide.
It was everything I hoped it to be.
Stanislav Grof,

82
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.840
MD,
otherwise known as Stan Grof.
Stanislav is spelled s.
T a.

83
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:12.760
N.
I.
S.
L.
A.

84
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.080
V is a psychiatrist with more than 60 years of experience in research of

85
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:19.840
holotropic states of consciousness,

86
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:21.940
and we'll define what that means in the interview,

87
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.050
but suffice to say for now it is a large and important subgroup of non ordinary

88
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:27.130
states that have healing,

89
00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:31.360
transformative and evolutionary potential and we will explore all of that.

90
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.140
Previously he was principal investigator in a psychedelic research program at

91
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:38.200
the psychiatric research institute in Prague,
Czechoslovakia,

92
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.400
Chief of psychiatric research at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center,

93
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.210
Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore,

94
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:49.180
Maryland and scholar in residence at the Esalen Institute.

95
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.180
In this very wide ranging conversation,

96
00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:56.740
we cover a whole lot of things including some stuff that he has not gone over

97
00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.730
previously.
So among others,

98
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.790
some of his main takeaways after supervising or guiding roughly 4,500 LSD

99
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:09.020
sessions,
that is LSD assisted psychotherapy sessions,

100
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.500
the place in role of so called wounded healers,

101
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.730
limitations and uses of traditional psychoanalysis and talk therapy,

102
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.050
similarities.

103
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:22.910
There's some similarities between holotropic breathwork and MDM may use or the

104
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:24.890
applications of Mtma stories,

105
00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:29.630
a very odd synchronicities and the seemingly impossible.
We get into some very,

106
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.050
very hard to explain reports and phenomena to put it very,

107
00:06:35.331 --> 00:06:36.164
very lightly.

108
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.700
Stan's strangest personal experiences on psychedelics and what Stan believes

109
00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:43.880
humanity most needs to overcome.
Division and destruction.

110
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.750
Currently stand is professor of psychology at Ciis,

111
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:51.560

114
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:03.320
He's one of the founders and chief theoreticians of transpersonal psychology as

115
00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:08.321
a field and the founding president of the International Transpersonal

116
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.470

His publications include more than 150 articles in professional journals and

118

books like psychology of the future of the cosmic game and hold tropic

119
00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:19.820
breathwork among many others.

120
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.480
You can find him online and I will link to this and everything in this episode

Now,

123
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.740
one more thing before we get to the interview and I'll try to keep this short.

124
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.830
Please,

128
00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:52.820
this is very,
very helpful to me and my podcast team.

129
00:07:52.821 --> 00:07:56.030
It helps us to get hard to reach guests and do much more of ticks,

130
00:07:56.031 --> 00:07:57.050
10 to 30 seconds.

131
00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:01.070
So all you have to do is search for the Tim Ferriss show you can misspell,

132
00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:03.590
it doesn't matter in iTunes or on your phone,

133
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.910
in the app you use like apple podcasts,
overcast,
stitcher,
castbox,
whatever.

134
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.120
When you see my face and the Tim Ferriss show,

136
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.720

137

138
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.100
And with that said,
please enjoy this interview.

139
00:08:25.101 --> 00:08:29.300
I hope you enjoy it as much as I did with the one and only Stan Grof.

140
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:33.950
Stan,
welcome to the show.

141
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.230
<v 3>Thank you very much.
Thank you for having me.</v>

142
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:40.973
It's such an,

143
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:45.410
I would like to thank you for everything you have been doing for raising

144
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:50.270
consciousness on this planet has been amazing and it's a great honor and

145
00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:51.980
pleasure for me to be on your show.

146
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:56.610
<v 1>Oh,
thank you so much.
I could not be more excited be speaking with you right now.</v>

147
00:08:56.611 --> 00:09:01.290
And we said hello via video of just a few moments ago and,

148
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:06.180
uh,
I certainly have only become more excited to have this conversation,

149
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.290
uh,
because of our,
our introduction Jack Kornfield,

150
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.890
one of the sweetest humans I know.
And uh,

151
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:16.570
I have many questions and many topics.
Uh,

152
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:20.190
so thanks of course to Jack for making the introduction.

153
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.250
And,
uh,

154
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:26.580
by this time people would have already heard some of your bio graphical

155
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:28.380
information that I would have read,

156
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:33.410
but I suppose we should start maybe at the beginning and ask you how you first

157
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:38.070
became interested in psychedelics.

158
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.910
<v 3>Well,
the situation was I became initiative,</v>

159
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.470
very excited about psychoanalysis and,
uh,
it is out there.

160
00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:53.730
I went to medical school and in my fourth year of medical school,

161
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.640
I was going to the psychiatric department already as a volunteer to get some,

162
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.120
you know,
some,
a sense for the,
for the discipline.

163
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.080
And this is where we got from Santos,

164
00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:11.850
a supply of ampules of Delis,
it of,
of LSD.

165
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:17.460
And it came with a letter talking about the history about the,
you know,

166
00:10:17.461 --> 00:10:18.400
the famous,
uh,

167
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.610
experienced self experimental Albert Hofmann and the bicycle ride and all that.

168
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:29.300
And they were asking us if we would like to experiment with that substance and

169
00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:35.721
let them know if there was any illegitimate use for it in a psychiatry and uh,

170
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.910
psychology.
And,
uh,
my preceptor,
um,
uh,

171
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:46.020
don't send her ob check who was very interested in Lsd,

172
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:50.970
but he didn't have time to sit,
uh,
you know,
for six or eight hours with this,
uh,

173
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.410
um,
patients,
uh,
the experimental subjects.

174
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.850
So he was using several of us as a kind of goal for us.

175
00:10:59.851 --> 00:11:03.530
We were sitting in these sessions and we very keeping the records.

176
00:11:03.531 --> 00:11:07.410
So I actually started my exposure to Lsd,
uh,

177
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.470
already in 1954,
but a,

178
00:11:10.471 --> 00:11:13.620
unlike at Harvard students who are excluded.

179
00:11:13.621 --> 00:11:18.540
So I couldn't have my own session until I graduated from the medical school.

180
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.560
And by the time,
you know,
my appetite was whetted.

181
00:11:21.561 --> 00:11:25.510
So I was sitting in these sessions of a psychologist,
psychiatrist,
uh,

182
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.900
artists and,
uh,
you know,

183
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.190
hearing all these fantastic stories about the experiences that they had,

184
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.070
but I had no really no access to it.

185
00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:40.570
<v 1>What application were you looking at initially?
Uh,
what was,
uh,
what was the,</v>

186
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:45.700
<v 3>you know,
initially it was just a,
just a kind of a toss,</v>

187
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.670
just a phenomenological,

188
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.970
a search that's giving it to different people and seeing what it does,
you know,

189
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.320
I don't know if you can now,
when there are a lot of publications and,
uh,

190
00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.910
you know,
other kinds of publicity,

191
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.690
what it was like for us when the substance fell into our laps,

192
00:12:01.691 --> 00:12:05.440
we had absolutely no idea what it would do,
you know,

193
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:09.550
from session to session.
I mean,
uh,
we didn't know where it would be going,

194
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:13.030
you know,
with our patients and in our own sessions.

195
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.270
So it was quite an exciting adventure.

196
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.830
I spent several years actually doing two sessions a day.

197
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:25.170
I would get up early if to a session and,
uh,

198
00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.360
uh,
two,
uh,
two o'clock,
you know,

199
00:12:28.361 --> 00:12:33.361
I started another one and I had a department where I had 18 beds and all the

200
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.110
patients were getting Lsd,

201
00:12:38.111 --> 00:12:42.610
so they were really familiar with the states and all our nurses have training

202
00:12:42.611 --> 00:12:45.580
sessions.
So by two o'clock I could pass the,

203
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:50.910
the person I was coming down from an LSD session to this team of nurses and

204
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.860
patients and I could start another one.

205
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.630
And I was sitting in all of those sessions,
you know,
all the whole time,

206
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.990
unlike some other places where,
for example,

207
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.920
on scar loin or he was just surely leaving the bay,
the experimental subjects,
uh,

208
00:13:06.921 --> 00:13:11.320
alone.
And they just had a bell where they could call the nurse when they were in

209
00:13:11.321 --> 00:13:15.370
trouble.
But I was so excited about what was coming on.

210
00:13:15.371 --> 00:13:20.170
I realized this was,
this is going to change,
you know,
psychiatry,

211
00:13:20.171 --> 00:13:21.880
psychology.
What,

212
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:26.800
what was it about those early experiences that led you to that conclusion that

213
00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:30.880
it would change psychiatry and psychology?
And maybe just before we get to that,

214
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.880
and I want to talk about your first experience as well,

215
00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:38.881
but how many total sessions have you directly or indirectly been a part of or

216
00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:43.750
supervised in your life would you say at this point?

217
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:48.260
Who would be like a four and a half thousand of,
uh,
you know,
uh,

218
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:52.960
LSD sessions,
but I adult,
so I was working with silicide been also,

219
00:13:52.961 --> 00:13:56.710
we were working for a while with the tryptamine derivative switch.

220
00:13:56.711 --> 00:14:00.850
You actually came from Budapest,
from our neighbor,
a doctor's Zada,

221
00:14:00.851 --> 00:14:02.750
Steven Zara and doctor sermon.

222
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.220
They were the ones who actually develop the whole group of,
uh,
the,
uh,

223
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:11.820
tryptamine derivatives,
the Mtd e t.
T.
P.
T.
Um,

224
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.800
it,
I don't think they had at the time the metrics,
the DMT,

225
00:14:14.801 --> 00:14:17.710
which seems to be the most,
uh,
most interesting one.

226
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:23.770
And the initial feeling that you,
that you had or the,

227
00:14:23.771 --> 00:14:28.600
the initial excitement that you felt this could change psychology and

228
00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:33.310
psychiatry.
Why was that?
What did you see that made you come to that conclusion?

229
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:37.570
Whether the initial was this,
uh,
uh,
you know,
approach,

230
00:14:37.571 --> 00:14:42.160
which could be a cold search for toxin ex.
Um,
the way,

231
00:14:42.161 --> 00:14:42.820
um,

232
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:47.230
LSD came to us was that is a substance that can mimic somehow a psychosis.

233
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:51.140
We call the initial sessions experimental psychosis.
You know,

234
00:14:51.141 --> 00:14:54.110
it was called Hallucinogens psychotomimetic.

235
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:59.740
And so the excitement or that we have a model of something like schizophrenia or

236
00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:03.740
the,
or the,
uh,
other kinds of psychosis.

237
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.460
And this made the possibility of creating a model,

238
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:12.290
which is always great to have a model in,
in science.
So,
uh,
give,
uh,

239
00:15:12.291 --> 00:15:15.260
Lsd,
you know,
to a quote unquote normal subjects.

240
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:20.030
And they would spend six to eight hours in a world that seemed to be like the

241
00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:23.750
world of,
uh,
of our,
uh,
patients.

242
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:28.400
And so the initial,
my initial research actually was laboratory.

243
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:33.700
I wrote one of the early papers on the role of Serotonin in a psychiatry.

244
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.950
And the initial research was we had a group of 40 people,
including ourselves,

245
00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:46.820
mostly professionals,
psychologists,
psychiatrists,
biologists and so on.

246
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:51.830
And we had a protocol.
We would invite these people for a day,

247
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:55.880
uh,
to,
uh,
the research institute.
We would,
uh,

248
00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.950
do really scientific work,
you know,

249
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.510
throwing a blood every hour on the hour,

250
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.740
collecting samples of urine,
doing psychological tests and uh,

251
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:11.120
and electrophysiological,
uh,
investigations.

252
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.780
And then we had one day when we brought,
uh,

253
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:18.890
schizophrenia patients who were matched by age,
by gender,

254
00:16:18.891 --> 00:16:23.600
by,
uh,
Iq and so on with our experimental subjects.

255
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:28.930
And we are looking if these values of this psychological and physiological

256
00:16:30.021 --> 00:16:35.000
biochemical tests would sort of converged with the values in schizophrenia x.

257
00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.670
And then something amazing happened.

258
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:40.730
I found that there was incredible,

259
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.480
I would say in their individual inter individual variability.

260
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:48.590
So you give the same substance,
uh,
uh,

261
00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:49.790
in the same dosage,

262
00:16:49.791 --> 00:16:54.440
under the same circumstances and the same lousy set and setting,

263
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.380
which we had.
And each of those,
uh,

264
00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:02.480
people would have different experiences to the point that some of them called

265
00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:05.780
it,
like the moments that they get between the tests.

266
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:09.690
It was like a self analysis,
like a,
you know,

267
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:13.090
drug assisted psychotherapy,
uh,

268
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:17.540
others where just unpleasant physical symptoms.

269
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:20.350
Some of them,
uh,
uh,

270
00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.930
had to know paranoid episodes or became hyper manic.

271
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.810
And for some of them,
uh,
it was the,
the,

272
00:17:26.811 --> 00:17:31.700
even under those circumstances that got glimpses of ecstatic states that,
uh,

273
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.950
that we are very mystical and the same,
uh,
inter individual variability.

274
00:17:36.951 --> 00:17:41.900
If we took the same substance at different times,

275
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.510
uh,
this phenomenology was completely different.

276
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:49.130
And at that point I realized this was not psychopharmacology.

277
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:53.130
We were not doing pharmacology because if you do pharmacology,

278
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:56.130
you have to have some idea what you are getting.
You know,

279
00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:01.160
if you give people apomorphine you,
you expect that a lot of them will be,
uh,

280
00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:05.640
what meeting if you give them,
uh,
uh,
uh,

281
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.030
hypnotic,
you expect them to,
to,
to sleep.

282
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.820
Whereas here we had no idea what would happen.

283
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.930
So I realized we were doing something much more interesting.
We were,

284
00:18:15.931 --> 00:18:20.931
we had a catalyst that was a make made it possible to explore the depths of the

285
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:25.200
human psyche.
I realized that people were not having LSD experiences.

286
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.420
They were having experiences of themselves,

287
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.870
but they were coming from depths that,
uh,
you know,

288
00:18:30.871 --> 00:18:35.250
psychoanalysis didn't know anything about.
And so at that point I just lost,

289
00:18:35.251 --> 00:18:39.620
completely interested in his laboratory approach and I took it to,
uh,

290
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:44.720
to clinical work and I started giving to my patients,

291
00:18:45.811 --> 00:18:48.330
you know,
in a psychotherapeutic context.

292
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:52.230
When did you have your first personal experience?
It was,

293
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:57.050
how much and what are taken?
How much did you take,
if you recall?
Uh,

294
00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:01.940
this was,
uh,
actually a hundred,
a hundred micrograms.

295
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.840
It was on the 13th of,
uh,
of,
uh,
uh,

296
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:10.770
November,
1956.
So I was from 54,

297
00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.790
56.
I was sitting for people.
Uh,
but,
uh,

298
00:19:14.791 --> 00:19:19.500
it was a little more complicated because my preceptor or my mentioned earlier,

299
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:24.090
he was very interested in,
uh,
electroencephalography.

300
00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:29.640
And um,
at the time when Lsd came,

301
00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:34.170
he was the one who received it from Santos.
So at the time when it came,

302
00:19:34.171 --> 00:19:38.080
he was interested in something that's called driving the brainwaves or,
and,

303
00:19:38.081 --> 00:19:42.240
and training the brainwaves,
which the Eeg,
uh,
well,

304
00:19:42.241 --> 00:19:47.241
it was exposing people to a very powerful stroboscopic light frequencies and

305
00:19:48.031 --> 00:19:51.870
finding out if the brainwaves in the suboccipital area,
which is the,

306
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:56.610
the visual Cortex,
if the brainwaves would pick up that frequency,

307
00:19:56.611 --> 00:20:00.840
if you can drive the,
or trained the brainwave.

308
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:05.310
So,
uh,
the condition for,
for us having the session with him,

309
00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:10.470
we had to agree that we would have a EEG,
you know,
before,
during,
and after.

310
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.810
And that we also will have our brainwaves driven,
uh,
in,

311
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:20.070
in all those sessions.
So what happened that,
uh,
you know,

312
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:24.480
between the third and the fourth hour,
when the session,
uh,
usually culminated,

313
00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.730
uh,
the,
uh,

314
00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:33.270
Doctor Ob checks assistant came and she said,
it's time to drive the brainwaves.

315
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.950
So she took me to a little,
um,
a room,
uh,

316
00:20:37.951 --> 00:20:41.370
I laid down,
she pasted all these,
uh,
electrodes on my head,

317
00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:44.970
and then brought this gigantis stroke,
put it above my head,

318
00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:49.930
and then turn this thing on.
And in the next moment there was light.

319
00:20:49.931 --> 00:20:52.540
Like I had never seen.
I couldn't even imagine existed.

320
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.120
My only concept there was a,

321
00:20:56.121 --> 00:20:59.560
this is what it must have been like in Hiroshima,
where the thing went off,

322
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.270
you know,
uh,

323
00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:06.520
today I think it was more like a tea Dharmakaya the,

324
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.900
the primary clear light from Bardo Trudeau from the Tibetan book of the dead

325
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.060
that we see at the moment of our death.
Uh,

326
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:19.460
but what happened is my consciousness was catapulted out of my body.
Uh,

327
00:21:19.461 --> 00:21:23.380
I lost,
uh,
the research assistant,
you know,

328
00:21:23.381 --> 00:21:27.040
I lost the clinic,
I lost the Prague I of the planet.

329
00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:32.560
And,
uh,
I had,
uh,
the feeling that I actually stepped extinguished,

330
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.410
uh,
in,
in the form that I knew myself,

331
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:40.660
but also the sense that I somehow became everything there was,
I became all of a,

332
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:43.820
all of existence.
Uh,
as you know,

333
00:21:43.821 --> 00:21:47.680
we must have heard it quite a few times that these states are considered

334
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:50.140
ineffable.
It's when you start,

335
00:21:50.141 --> 00:21:55.141
the trying to describe them is you find out that we just simply don't have,

336
00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.120
don't have language.
Our language is developed,
you know,

337
00:21:59.121 --> 00:22:01.960
to communicate about things from,
from everyday life.

338
00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.130
And in my later experiments,
some of the sophisticated,
uh,

339
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:11.140
patients actually tried to use a language from cultures that knew something

340
00:22:11.141 --> 00:22:15.700
about consciousness,
like using,
you know,
from,
from induced and from,
uh,

341
00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:20.940
uh,
you know,
uh,
Tibetan Buddhism from Tao is,
and sort of the,

342
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:25.260
we're talking about,
uh,
uh,
you know,
Nirvikalpa Samadhi,

343
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:28.900
stomach help us,
nobody can show a Satori,
you know,

344
00:22:28.901 --> 00:22:33.901
using terms like Maya and so on because we simply don't have a technical terms

345
00:22:34.631 --> 00:22:38.230
for,
for the states.
So,
uh,

346
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:42.120
the experiences of mystical states are full of paradoxes.

347
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.980
Paradoxicality is one of the characteristics,

348
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.360
so you can have the feeling that you became nothing,

349
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:51.070
but by becoming nothing,

350
00:22:51.071 --> 00:22:55.250
you actually became a of a existence.
Uh,

351
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:58.210
so I was in this incredible state and then

352
00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.700
as she was continuing,
uh,
breaking with me,
it was unfolding.

353
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:09.100
She had a protocol.
So she started from two Hertz,
which is,
you know,

354
00:23:09.101 --> 00:23:13.120
two frequencies per second,
took it up to 60,

355
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:18.350
and then she kept it for a while in the Alpha range.
Then the data range,

356
00:23:18.351 --> 00:23:22.990
the Delta range,
and then she turned it off.
And why she was doing this,

357
00:23:22.991 --> 00:23:27.580
that at a certain point,
I actually went from this sense of being everything,

358
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:32.200
of being in the universe,
in the astronomical universe or,

359
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:36.150
or actually being the universe.
Uh,

360
00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:40.240
there were things happening for which at the time I didn't have,
uh,
names,

361
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.520
but then later I read about,
uh,
you know,
the,

362
00:23:43.521 --> 00:23:46.680
a big bank and the black holes and the wormholes.

363
00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:52.620
And so this was something in that category and it was happening to me.

364
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:57.780
I actually had the feeding again that I not,
was not only in the universe,

365
00:23:57.781 --> 00:24:02.190
but I actually was the universe.
And then,
uh,
you know,

366
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:06.780
as she turned it off,
then my world started shrinking again.

367
00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:12.150
I found the planet.
I found Prague.
I zoomed in on my body,

368
00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:17.580
but there was a major problem because by my consciousness was actually,
uh,

369
00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.500
kind of,
uh,
uh,

370
00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:23.850
circling around my body and I had difficulties aligning.

371
00:24:23.851 --> 00:24:26.220
My consciousness was,
uh,
my body.

372
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:31.380
So at that point it became clear to me that what,
uh,
uh,

373
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:36.420
they had teaching at a university is about consciousness as a product of the

374
00:24:36.421 --> 00:24:39.250
brain.
Simply was nonsense.
That is,
you know,

375
00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:45.020
consciousness was something cosmic and that the brain somehow is a moderator for

376
00:24:45.091 --> 00:24:48.780
that,
but it's not the generated in,
in our skull.

377
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.330
Could you even find it?
I managed to align death and uh,

378
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:56.070
I came down in an very ecstatic state,

379
00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:00.690
very impressed with just happened and they were right there.

380
00:25:00.691 --> 00:25:04.050
I decided if I'm a psychiatrist,
uh,
you know,

381
00:25:04.051 --> 00:25:07.540
this is by far the most interesting thing I can do working with these,

382
00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:12.090
with these states,
it's just overshadowed psychoanalysis.
You like,
uh,

383
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:17.760
you know,
uh,
I was not interested in psychoanalysis anymore.

384
00:25:17.761 --> 00:25:20.670
I was interested in exploring the psyche using these states.

385
00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.280
<v 1>So you,
you,</v>

386
00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:27.290
you've at this point dedicated more than six decades to studying non ordinary

387
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:32.120
states of consciousness,
uh,
which is,
I think we'll probably talk about this.

388
00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:36.800
That is a,
a term or a phrase you prefer over altered states of consciousness.

389
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:38.500
But,
uh,
you're,

390
00:25:38.501 --> 00:25:42.620
you're alluding to perhaps a definition of consciousness or how you think about

391
00:25:42.621 --> 00:25:47.600
it now.
How do you think about consciousness at this point?
You said that,
uh,
it's,

392
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:52.610
uh,
I think mediated or moderated by the brain,
but not generated by it.
Uh,

393
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.070
based on these experiences,
the experiences of others you've supervised,

394
00:25:59.150 --> 00:25:59.983
everything you've,

395
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:04.990
you've seen and experienced and studied up to this point,

396
00:26:05.241 --> 00:26:08.990
how do you think about consciousness now?
Are there any other aspects

397
00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:10.360
<v 3>that you'd like to,</v>

398
00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:15.190
and I'm very close now to every Laszlo who is this brilliant,

399
00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.053
uh,

400
00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:20.650
a systems theorist and a philosopher of Hungarian origin,

401
00:26:20.651 --> 00:26:23.560
but living in Pisa in,
in Italy,

402
00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:27.820
and he has a series of books where he essentially addressing these problems.

403
00:26:27.821 --> 00:26:30.190
He's the only one debit,
I think,

404
00:26:30.191 --> 00:26:34.990
found some way of scientifically describing what is happening to us.

405
00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:39.160
And he has a book called what is reality,

406
00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:44.580
but he actually goes through these different that we have related to

407
00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:49.710
consciousness and,
uh,
argues,
you know,
what,
what are the,

408
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:54.290
um,
uh,
observation that we have against the idea that,
uh,

409
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.300
that consciousness is local that is inside of our brain.

410
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:03.000
And he moves to the,
that just,
this is more transpersonal,

411
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:03.953
that it,
uh,

412
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.740
in the non ordinary states you can have experiences of consciousness of other

413
00:27:07.741 --> 00:27:09.650
people.
You can have experiences of,
uh,

414
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:15.200
of being in becoming members of a different species and not just animals,

415
00:27:16.861 --> 00:27:20.850
but also plants and so on.
So he moves from that,

416
00:27:20.851 --> 00:27:24.690
from the consciousness being local to coaches as being transpersonal.

417
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.970
And then he brings even arguments against that and concludes that that

418
00:27:29.971 --> 00:27:32.910
consciousness is costs make.
And you know,
that would be,

419
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.340
that would be my present.

420
00:27:35.341 --> 00:27:40.341
Understanding the consciousness is simply a part of integral part of existence.

421
00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:47.361
It cannot be reduced to two anything as let alone the neurons in the brain.

422
00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:50.610
Uh,
so this also support it.
Now,

423
00:27:50.611 --> 00:27:55.430
of course by many people from quantum relativistic physics and,

424
00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.550
um,
for example,

425
00:27:56.551 --> 00:28:01.551
Stuart Hameroff initially thought that maybe it's the called tubules in the mid

426
00:28:02.161 --> 00:28:03.180
200 [inaudible] in the,

427
00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:07.980
in the brain might be the place where some quantum processes generate

428
00:28:07.981 --> 00:28:08.814
consciousness.

429
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:13.590
And then later he sort of took it back and he says,
now,

430
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.480
uh,
according to him,

431
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:20.720
consciousness is simply a property of the universe that can be traced back to,

432
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:25.300
uh,
the big bank in the form of protocol consciousness.
Okay.

433
00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:31.420
<v 1>There's a term that people often associate of course rightly with you in</v>

434
00:28:32.531 --> 00:28:36.880
association with consciousness and that is holotropic states of consciousness.

435
00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:42.140
And I'd love to,
to jump into that because,
uh,

436
00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:42.551
it also,

437
00:28:42.551 --> 00:28:47.200
just as a side note for people listening who are wondering what the applications

438
00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:50.200
of uh,
these,
these,
uh,

439
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:54.580
non ordinary states might be or how they've been utilized.
There are men,

440
00:28:54.581 --> 00:28:57.460
if it appears to me that there are many,
many different ways to utilize this.

441
00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.150
There's certain multiple Nobel prizes associated with it.
Kary Mollis,

442
00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:05.610
Francis Crick and they code discovery of the double helix.
And then there are uh,

443
00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:08.380
you know,
well known entrepreneurs and so on like Steve Jobs.

444
00:29:08.381 --> 00:29:13.270
But what does whole atropic refer to a hold of topic,

445
00:29:13.271 --> 00:29:14.230
state of consciousness?

446
00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:15.910
<v 3>He was great.
Great question.</v>

447
00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:20.920
But I have so far been or we have been using the term non ordinary states of

448
00:29:20.921 --> 00:29:22.780
consciousness,
which is better.

449
00:29:22.781 --> 00:29:26.910
That one about psychiatry is British and American psychiatry side doing calling

450
00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:31.120
it altered state.
You know,
I really dislike that term,

451
00:29:31.121 --> 00:29:35.380
although it was coined by a good friend of mine,
uh,
Charlie Tarik.
Um,

452
00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:39.520
because it suggests somehow that there is a correct way of experiencing

453
00:29:39.521 --> 00:29:43.990
ourselves and the world and that's somehow a disturbed,

454
00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:45.310
you know,

455
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:49.090
I always have to think about veterinary medicine and we talk maybe if we had our

456
00:29:49.091 --> 00:29:50.000
dog altered.

457
00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:54.520
So I'm feel too much respect for these days to call them altered.

458
00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:57.070
And even the state non ordinary,

459
00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:02.340
it's really not accurate because there many non ordinary states that have not

460
00:30:02.711 --> 00:30:06.460
the properties that a,
the holotropic states would have.

461
00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.690
So I use the term holotropic four s special,

462
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:15.870
large subcategory of non ordinary states that have Ealing potential therapeutic

463
00:30:16.391 --> 00:30:19.390
potential that have,
according to my experience,

464
00:30:19.391 --> 00:30:22.750
transformative potential that have,
uh,

465
00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:27.190
what we call your stick Agu are,
which means when you work with these states,

466
00:30:27.191 --> 00:30:30.410
you run into a lot of paradigm breaking,
uh,

467
00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.610
observations that challenged the whole way of thinking,

468
00:30:33.611 --> 00:30:36.580
not just in psychiatry but in a terroristic science.

469
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.940
And then I believe they also have evolutionary.

470
00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:44.710
I think they would if people would systematically use them.
Uh,
I,

471
00:30:44.711 --> 00:30:49.570
I think we will almost become another and other species,
you know,
people,
uh,

472
00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.780
work through a lot of aggression.
It's replaced by compassion.

473
00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:58.090
They have the experience of,
uh,
tremendous,
uh,
ecological sensitivity.

474
00:30:58.091 --> 00:30:58.840
They,

475
00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:03.160
they discovered that we are deeply embedded in nature and that we cannot do

476
00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:08.161
anything to nature that doesn't damage as they start seeing.

477
00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:15.190
Violence is an unacceptable way of,
uh,
of solving problems.

478
00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:17.590
You know,
they have a sense of,
uh,
uh,

479
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:20.930
being actually global citizens,
uh,

480
00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:24.700
rather than being Czechs or Russians or Americans,

481
00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:29.710
they start seeing themselves very much the way it happened to the astronauts who

482
00:31:29.711 --> 00:31:34.210
at the possibility of actually seeing the,
the planet,
uh,
from,

483
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.110
uh,
from,
uh,
the moon or from space.

484
00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:40.270
Uh,
so,
um,

485
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:46.110
this is my term that I coined because I realized psychiatry does not have that

486
00:31:46.481 --> 00:31:50.020
kind of distinction.
So I coined it myself.

487
00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:53.230
It's a kind of a variable hybrid.

488
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:56.140
It's a neologism as we call it.
Uh,

489
00:31:56.141 --> 00:31:58.450
that comes from the Greek language.

490
00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.890
We're holistic means whole and tread portrait.

491
00:32:01.891 --> 00:32:04.870
Pain means I'm moving in the direction of something.

492
00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:09.280
I usually refer to the,
uh,
Elliot tropism.

493
00:32:09.281 --> 00:32:14.281
Helios means son and heliotropism is the property of plants to always orient

494
00:32:16.841 --> 00:32:20.500
themselves towards the sun always followed the sun.

495
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:24.700
So literally this means moving toward wholeness.

496
00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:30.670
You know,
when I,
when I use that term,
there's usually somebody who say,
uh,

497
00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.470
what do you mean moving toward wholeness?

498
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.800
Aren't we whole already the way we function in everyday life?

499
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.720
And I would have to say no.
On the basis of my,
we have a,

500
00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:45.290
we are using only a small fraction of our experiential potential when we are in

501
00:32:45.291 --> 00:32:48.810
the ordinary states.
So maybe I just give a few examples of,

502
00:32:48.811 --> 00:32:52.310
of all the tropic states of people have a sense of what I'm talking about.
Yes,

503
00:32:52.311 --> 00:32:52.760
please.

504
00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:57.760
So one category when you would find stays that I called holotropic would be the

505
00:32:58.341 --> 00:33:03.341
initiatory crisis of Shamans in the carrier of most Germans begin by a

506
00:33:03.591 --> 00:33:08.540
spontaneous experience of traveling into the visionary experience of traveling

507
00:33:08.541 --> 00:33:13.210
into the universe,
being traveling into the,
the,
um,

508
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:18.590
underworld,
Ferris,
uh,
uh,
they have the experience of being exposed to some,
uh,

509
00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:23.920
uh,
ordeals,
uh,
experience,
uh,
a lot of emotional,

510
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:28.370
physical pain and they experience Nia Alation and then,
uh,

511
00:33:28.371 --> 00:33:30.020
experience of psycho spiritual death,

512
00:33:30.021 --> 00:33:34.700
rebirth that's followed by this journey into the supernatural realms.

513
00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:38.810
And in this initiatory journey,
they heal themselves.

514
00:33:38.811 --> 00:33:43.400
Typically a anthropologists called chairman's,
the wounded healers,

515
00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.070
and they also learn how to heal.

516
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:50.060
So when they then managed to come back and they ground decision,

517
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:54.800
they use holotropic states in their healing.
When they heal,

518
00:33:54.801 --> 00:33:59.210
they either go into an unordinary state or the induce them in their clients,

519
00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:03.440
or both Shamans and clients get into this holotropic state.

520
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.880
So that's a major category.

521
00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:10.460
The second one is what you see in a so-called a rites of passage.

522
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:15.550
This is the term that was coined by a Dutch anthropologists are not one Hennit,

523
00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:20.720
that's g,
e,
N,
n,
e,
p,
who studied many native cultures.

524
00:34:20.721 --> 00:34:25.280
And he found out that they all,
uh,
uh,
you know,

525
00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:29.540
at the time of important biological or social transitions,
uh,

526
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:33.860
perform a very powerful rituals,
uh,

527
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:38.420
when they also induce in the cellar tropic states in,

528
00:34:38.421 --> 00:34:41.990
in different ways,
uh,
many of those cultures,

529
00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:43.730
even with psychedelic plants,

530
00:34:43.731 --> 00:34:48.380
so psychedelic psychedelic materials in some others using,

531
00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:53.300
uh,
you know,
sonic technology,
drumming,

532
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:58.640
ref,
DirectLink and so on.
A physical pain,
stay in the desert,

533
00:34:58.641 --> 00:35:00.730
stay in the high mountains,
uh,

534
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:04.460
stay in a cave in the Arctic ice and so on.

535
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:09.250
And if you study these people experience psycho spiritual death,
rebirth,

536
00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:14.030
very much like the Shamans in the spontaneous,
a initiatory journey.

537
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:19.280
And of the third important category,
uh,
with the ancient mysteries of death,

538
00:35:19.281 --> 00:35:20.114
rebirth,

539
00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:25.520
like the Eleusinian mysteries or the eyes is society's mysteries in Egypt or the

540
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:29.640
Sumerian mysteries of Inanna and,
uh,
[inaudible].

541
00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:34.070
And also,
you know,
they were,
they were Mesoamerican,
uh,

542
00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:39.460
mysteries of Shababa,
the Mayan and so on.
Uh,
so,

543
00:35:39.461 --> 00:35:40.050
um,

544
00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:45.050
all of these were inducing these holotropic states for healing and

545
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:47.550
transformation.

546
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.710
And then also all the major religions developed what I called technologies of

547
00:35:52.711 --> 00:35:55.760
the sacred,
you know,
different forms of Yoga,
uh,

548
00:35:56.010 --> 00:36:00.930
different schools of Buddhism from,
uh,
Teravata to,

549
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:04.440
to,
uh,
then,
and,
uh,
uh,
much Rhianna.

550
00:36:04.441 --> 00:36:08.070
Dow is exercises in the Christian tradition,

551
00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:13.660
has see cars and the Jesus prayer or the exercises of Ignatius,

552
00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:16.830
Saint Ignatius of Loyola.
Uh,

553
00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:21.600
it's various cabalistic cabalistic exercises.
So those were all,

554
00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:22.750
um,
um,

555
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.970
methods that were designed to,

556
00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:31.590
to take people into this holotropic experiences,
uh,
for the purpose of,

557
00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:35.910
of having a mystical experience,
having a spiritual experience.

558
00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:40.170
And of course,
we have now modern,
uh,
technology,

559
00:36:40.171 --> 00:36:42.750
so the sacred to induce holotropic experiences.

560
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.900
We have now a pure alkaloids from,
from,
uh,

561
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:51.650
the psychedelic plants.
You know,
we have,
uh,
mescaline from PR,

562
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:56.960
we have a seal of sin and silicide being from the magic mushrooms of the,

563
00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:01.660
uh,
the muscle techs,
we have now,
um,
uh,

564
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:06.120
the,
uh,
Ibogaine gain from,
from Alga,
from,
from the African,

565
00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:08.640
um,
African,

566
00:37:08.641 --> 00:37:13.641
a Welsh and so on and to be also have now,

567
00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:15.990
uh,
the tryptamine derivatives,

568
00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:21.210
DMT a DPT,
and then meth,
oxy,
the empty,

569
00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:26.240
those are of active in Ayahuasca and in the different snuffs from the Caribbean.

570
00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:31.270
Um,
and also from this,
uh,
toward,

571
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:34.590
that's now becoming very famous than,
than before,
before our Larios.

572
00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:39.600
This are secretions from the parotid glands and from the skin of the stores.

573
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:43.350
Very,
very powerful,
very important.
Uh,
psychedelics.

574
00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.300
<v 1>So let me pause for one second.
I have many,</v>

575
00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:51.220
I'm not going to lose track of the train and I have a number of different

576
00:37:51.221 --> 00:37:55.660
questions.
But since,
since you brought it up,
uh,
a mutual friend of ours,

577
00:37:55.690 --> 00:38:00.400
different mutual friend had had suggested I ask you about toad and you just

578
00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:04.930
mentioned that,
uh,
it,
it could be or is important.

579
00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:09.940
And you mentioned methoxy Dmt,
uh,
which,
you know,
in this case,

580
00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:13.090
uh,
often referred to a five meo DMT.

581
00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:17.050
What are your thoughts on this particular,

582
00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:22.090
this particular compound?
Uh,
and,
and why is it important,
if it's important?

583
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:24.240
<v 3>Well,
the thing is,</v>

584
00:38:24.241 --> 00:38:28.750
it has not really been explored scientifically unlike silicide,
you know,

585
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:29.910
or Lsd.

586
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:35.480
But we have enormous amount of information from either stem illegal or illegal,

587
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:38.830
you know,
underground experiments,

588
00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:43.000
which were happening during those years when psychedelics,
uh,
uh,

589
00:38:43.001 --> 00:38:47.070
we're not really explored scientifically.
Uh,

590
00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:51.490
but we have an amazing book by,
uh,
Ralph Metzner,
which is called the tote.

591
00:38:51.491 --> 00:38:53.560
And the Jaguar,
uh,

592
00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:58.620
Ralph or traveled all over Europe and in the United States visiting this groups

593
00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:01.870
that were using it,
um,
you know,

594
00:39:01.871 --> 00:39:05.680
either using some legal loopholes or,
or,
uh,

595
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:09.520
you know,
doing it kind of an underground,
uh,
research.

596
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:15.190
And he wrote this book where he,
where he collected that information in,

597
00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:18.960
in a way that,
uh,
could become a basis of,

598
00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:20.500
of scientific research.

599
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:24.300
Now what is fantastic there is a,

600
00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:29.590
that this substance creates a very short,
uh,
you know,

601
00:39:29.591 --> 00:39:34.330
within an hour,
which is in the time of one cycle psychoanalytic session.

602
00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:38.500
You can experience significant,
uh,
transformation,
even,

603
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:43.400
even spiritual,
uh,
opening.
Uh,
and the,

604
00:39:43.401 --> 00:39:44.550
the substances method.

605
00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:49.620
See The empty I have in my book when the impossible happens,

606
00:39:50.051 --> 00:39:54.430
a chapter which is called the secret of the tote of light.

607
00:39:55.210 --> 00:40:00.130
There are churches in the American southwest that are actually using it as a

608
00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:03.190
sacrament.
It's called Church of the total of a light.

609
00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:08.340
And I took a fairly large doses,

610
00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:12.230
which is not just more than it's usually used.
Uh,

611
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:14.680
this was my first time when we really didn't know,

612
00:40:14.681 --> 00:40:19.681
I didn't know the dosing and it was estimated 25 milligrams today you would use

613
00:40:20.921 --> 00:40:24.440
like five or 10.
And uh,

614
00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:29.640
this was by far the most powerful psychedelic experience I've ever had and uh,

615
00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:35.470
was in seconds.
You know,
it took me a,
out of my body.
They were known.

616
00:40:35.471 --> 00:40:38.920
There's nothing biographical,
no,
no birth experiences,

617
00:40:38.921 --> 00:40:42.940
no nothing archetype.
I was just facing this,
uh,

618
00:40:42.941 --> 00:40:46.480
incredible.
Um,
I mean,

619
00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:49.990
source of light for the,
for the lack of a better description,

620
00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:54.790
it was like beyond anything I could imagine in terms of the,
the brilliance,

621
00:40:54.791 --> 00:40:58.350
the in Candice sense that it had.
But also since that this,

622
00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:03.400
there was an incredible intelligence,
creative intelligence going beyond any,

623
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:08.020
uh,
dichotomies.
I couldn't say for demonic or,
or divine,

624
00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:12.970
uh,
you know,
there was just off the scales that I had.

625
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:18.700
Um,
and then coming down,
uh,
from that experience,

626
00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:21.430
I actually had the feeling I was dying,

627
00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:27.060
but the feeling that I was not from life into dying but from a place beyond

628
00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.120
death into dying body.

629
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:35.780
And then after awhile it became clear that this was not really dying.

630
00:41:35.781 --> 00:41:37.520
It was just the experience of dying.

631
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:42.970
And for quite a while I was in a situation where I was in absolutely blissful

632
00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:50.020
kind of state and I was having visions of streams of my past life experiences

633
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:56.210
where I had feeling of,
you know,
dying and being killed and different situations.

634
00:41:57.010 --> 00:42:01.940
Um,
and my body was kind of acting out.
The,
the agony was shaking,

635
00:42:01.941 --> 00:42:06.230
twitching,
uh,
by,
you know,
psychologically,
emotionally.
I was in,

636
00:42:06.231 --> 00:42:11.060
in absolute bliss.
And then coming down for a week,

637
00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:15.940
I was in a state in which I would like to live.
Uh,
we were at the time,
uh,

638
00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:20.420
uh,
living at Sln,
we had a deck overlooking the ocean.

639
00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:23.410
And this was the time when I was handwriting my,

640
00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:28.220
my manuscripts and they're giving it to a secretary and then having to edit it.

641
00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:33.250
And I was in that week,
I was doing editing of my manuscript.

642
00:42:33.251 --> 00:42:36.230
People check would do perfectly lying in the sun there.

643
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:39.740
And then I felt I will take a little break.
I again,
it was in seconds.

644
00:42:39.741 --> 00:42:43.700
I had the feeling it was just a oneness with the,
the,
the whole environment,

645
00:42:43.701 --> 00:42:44.534
wonders with the world.

646
00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:49.490
And then I would open my eyes and I could continue editing.
But then of course,

647
00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:50.423
you know,

648
00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:55.830
the is sort of the consciousness of the industrial civilization came back,

649
00:42:57.201 --> 00:43:01.530
you know,
to uh,
do workshops,
travel,
uh,
you know,
uh,

650
00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:06.740
so,
um,
I didn't stay in that,
in that state,
but,
uh,

651
00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:09.680
uh,
my meditations became a much,
much,

652
00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:14.980
much deeper and it was not difficult to get into some version of that state,

653
00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:20.120
you know,
just through meditation.
So I think this would be an amazing,

654
00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:25.550
amazing substance to try for practical reasons because you've,

655
00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:29.990
you will not find a psychiatrist like myself,
uh,
in the,

656
00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:33.230
um,
you know,
in the 60s and so on,
uh,

657
00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:37.940
sitting for six hours with their patients,

658
00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:43.330
but they could certainly do a one hour session with the methoxy DMT and,

659
00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:50.150
uh,
I think significant,
uh,
therapy could be done,
you know,

660
00:43:50.151 --> 00:43:52.700
within these very short,
uh,
short term.

661
00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:56.580
It's also according to Ralph Messiness,
observations,
uh,

662
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:58.590
it's a,
uh,

663
00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:02.690
substance where the experience and very cleanly the,

664
00:44:02.691 --> 00:44:07.040
there is no sort of lingering on.
So there is a very powerful experience,

665
00:44:07.041 --> 00:44:11.230
but also a good,
a good closure.
So,
anyway,

666
00:44:11.231 --> 00:44:15.410
so this is my experience with the metric CD empty now.
It was called,

667
00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.500
it's a very,
very popular,
for example,

668
00:44:18.501 --> 00:44:23.270
we had the transpersonal conference in Prog,

669
00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:26.180
you know,
and there were lectures about it and of course they were,

670
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:31.070
there were people who had access to the,
to,
uh,
uh,

671
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:35.910
the toad material to the excretions or secretions of the glands.

672
00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:41.460
So it's becoming a very,
very popular,
popular substance right now.

673
00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:46.950
<v 1>You mentioned therapy a few times in describing your experience with five Amino</v>

674
00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:52.630
DMT in the potential,
say within a one hour window or something like that,
uh,

675
00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.690
to,
uh,
provide,
uh,

676
00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:59.750
therapy if someone were sitting for someone experiencing this.
Uh,

677
00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:04.390
I want to tie that into a comment that you're very famous for having made.

678
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:09.410
And I think it was in your first book in 1975 realms of the human unconscious in

679
00:45:09.581 --> 00:45:11.950
which you mentioned the Lsd could become for psychiatry,

680
00:45:11.951 --> 00:45:15.090
what the microscope was for biology and,
uh,

681
00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:19.830
in medicine and what the telescope is for astronomy.
Uh,

682
00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:24.610
what I'm curious about is,
I suppose a,
why you say that,

683
00:45:24.611 --> 00:45:25.540
but then B,

684
00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:30.550
is there still a place for psychoanalysis,
you know,

685
00:45:30.551 --> 00:45:35.551
traditional psychoanalysis or psychotherapy in combination with some of these,

686
00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:41.260
uh,
psychedelic compounds?
Uh,
because it,
it's,

687
00:45:41.261 --> 00:45:43.760
it seems to me that the,
uh,

688
00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:48.130
perhaps some of the value that people derive from these experiences or don't

689
00:45:48.131 --> 00:45:52.060
derive from these experiences is dependent quite a bit on what happens

690
00:45:52.061 --> 00:45:55.900
beforehand and what happens afterwards.
But I just,
I just love to hear you.

691
00:45:55.901 --> 00:46:00.901
I suppose clarify what you mean by LSD becoming for a psychiatry with the

692
00:46:01.001 --> 00:46:04.240
microscope is for biology and the telescope is for astronomy and then B,

693
00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:09.500
if therapy still has a place in combination with these.

694
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.030
<v 3>Another wonderful question.</v>

695
00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:16.740
So let me tell you what happened when I lost interest in this laboratory,
uh,

696
00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:22.310
research and took it to the clinic.
Uh,
uh,
we were,

697
00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:26.490
you mentioned in the,
in your interview with Michael Pollan,

698
00:46:26.491 --> 00:46:31.430
there are these two forms.
Uh,
they'd been using,
uh,
uh,

699
00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:34.980
LSD and other secondary,
the psycholytic and the psychedelic.

700
00:46:34.981 --> 00:46:39.510
The psychedelic is the,
you know,
using large dosage is fully internalized with,

701
00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:42.490
uh,
headphones,
eye shades,
and,
uh,

702
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:46.470
the method that was used mostly in Europe,

703
00:46:46.471 --> 00:46:50.970
but also by some American,
uh,
therapists.
It's called psycholytic,

704
00:46:50.971 --> 00:46:54.600
which is sort of dissolving the psyche,
dissolving the tensions,

705
00:46:54.601 --> 00:46:59.260
conflicts in the psyche and so on,
uh,
from,
from uh,

706
00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:00.960
Lucy's means this solution.

707
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:06.270
And so I started it with using sort of medium dosages,
may be,
you know,

708
00:47:06.271 --> 00:47:08.480
150,
uh,

709
00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:11.340
maybe up to 200 at the beginning.

710
00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:15.990
And what happened was absolutely fascinating because,
uh,

711
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:19.600
so intensification of the symptoms that the patients who are having,

712
00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:24.920
but then the process automatically took us to the different layers of a

713
00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:30.350
traumatic experiences that were actually underlying that disorder and layer

714
00:47:30.971 --> 00:47:31.840
after layer.

715
00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:37.780
Then I came up with the concept of a coexistence system of condensed experience

716
00:47:37.781 --> 00:47:42.430
where each symptom had like,
uh,
uh,
history,
you know,
has a,

717
00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:47.980
uh,
a series of layered experiences behind it.

718
00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:49.780
Uh,

719
00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:54.780
and so it was a process of exploring the different layers of the psyche.

720
00:47:55.550 --> 00:48:00.530
Uh,
one of my patients call it a onion peeling of the,
of,
uh,

721
00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:04.180
the psyche.
And other uncoded,
uh,
chemo archeology.

722
00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:09.690
So you could really explore the different layers of the postnatal biographical

723
00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:14.170
level.
This is what,
what,
uh,
Freudian analysis is about.

724
00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:18.140
But the problem is it didn't stop there.
Then each of those,
uh,

725
00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:23.310
coexistence also had a contribution from the trauma of burst.

726
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:24.430
There's suit,

727
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:28.780
even if we're using these lower dosages as we were going on,

728
00:48:28.781 --> 00:48:32.920
it took us to birth and that point,
suddenly people started experiencing,

729
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:36.320
uh,
that they are trapped.
They're caught.

730
00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:39.580
They aren't in a situation of no exit.
Uh,

731
00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:43.990
they had the feeling they're getting crazy,
uh,
you know,
they are dying and so on.

732
00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:49.090
And,
um,
you know,
my psychiatry and my,
uh,
my,
uh,

733
00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:54.530
psychotic training did not prepare me for that kind of thing.
And it took,
while,

734
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:58.960
including my own experiences to realize there was a powerful record of

735
00:48:58.961 --> 00:49:03.490
biological birth in there.
So,

736
00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:07.010
um,
what we activated actually,
uh,

737
00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:11.410
in the psyche was what I call now self healing intelligence of the psyche.

738
00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:14.830
You see,
the,
the process spontaneously was talking.

739
00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:19.780
It was taking us to the sources of,
uh,
of,
uh,
these,
uh,

740
00:49:19.781 --> 00:49:22.480
emotional and psychosomatic symptoms.

741
00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:26.740
It also created automatically the mapping of the psyche.

742
00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:31.290
So,
um,
for awhile I was just collecting these,
uh,

743
00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:36.040
um,
uh,
reports from the page,
my,
my own records and,
and,
uh,

744
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:39.760
people's,
uh,
uh,
um,
you know,

745
00:49:39.761 --> 00:49:44.490
descriptions of their sessions and I was putting it on a map,

746
00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:49.330
creating a,
what I thought was a new map for,
uh,
or psychology,

747
00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:52.250
um,
which would be,
um,

748
00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:57.830
and the result of the fact that we had absolutely new tool like a microscope

749
00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:01.570
open up,
you know,
this whole underworld which we in micro world,

750
00:50:01.571 --> 00:50:03.580
which we didn't know existed.

751
00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:08.170
And telescope discovered new new galaxies that the astronomers didn't know

752
00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:12.430
about.
So,
uh,
you know,
I felt we were discovering,
uh,

753
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.760
uh,
the depths of the,
uh,
of the psyche.

754
00:50:15.761 --> 00:50:19.060
So in that sense it was like a microscope or a telescope,

755
00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:23.650
but it also was the self healing intelligence that,
that sort of,
uh,
uh,

756
00:50:23.651 --> 00:50:26.650
emerged out of it in.

757
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:30.860
Do you find now when I finally got the map to get,

758
00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:35.600
yeah.
Oh No,
I was just going to say please continue.
I was just going to,

759
00:50:35.601 --> 00:50:40.220
I'm just going to ask about if their adjunct therapies or things that you would

760
00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.550
add to the beginning,
the,

761
00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:45.680
the pre psychedelic experience or post psychedelic experience.

762
00:50:45.681 --> 00:50:48.350
But I don't want to interrupt your train of thought.
Well,

763
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:52.400
I just a couple of sentences.
So the new map which I created,

764
00:50:52.401 --> 00:50:55.730
which I thought was new,
had the biographical level,

765
00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:58.860
which it shared with psychoanalysis and current,
uh,

766
00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:03.830
psychiatry because uh,
you know,
however much Freud was criticized,

767
00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:06.540
psychiatry accepted is uh,
uh,

768
00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:10.580
idea that the newborn is a Tabula Rasa is a clean slate.

769
00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:13.800
There's nothing of interest to a psychologist,

770
00:51:13.801 --> 00:51:17.720
psychiatrist that proceeds bearers.
And this was a major discovery.

771
00:51:17.721 --> 00:51:21.910
There is a powerful,
powerful record of purse.
And,
uh,

772
00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:24.350
when you become of aware of that fact,

773
00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:29.180
you have to radically change,
transform a thinking in,

774
00:51:29.181 --> 00:51:30.110
in psychiatry.

775
00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:35.590
So this new new map or map that I thought was new had the biographical level

776
00:51:35.721 --> 00:51:39.380
that it shared with,
uh,
with,
uh,
current psychiatry.

777
00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.860
But then I had to add the level of which I called perinatal,

778
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:45.950
which is related to birth with the record of burst.

779
00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:48.960
And then it opened up further into,
uh,

780
00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.760
the level that I call a transpersonal now.

781
00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:58.950
And there's a greater overlap with what young described as the collective

782
00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:02.870
unconscious,
the historical and the,
the,
uh,

783
00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:06.590
archetype archetypal unconscious.
But you see,
when I had the map,

784
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.300
I realized this was not a new map at all.

785
00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:11.180
Like should a map that in different forms,

786
00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:15.590
it's been around for not for four centuries,
but for millennia,

787
00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:20.900
I started seeing the connection to the great spiritual philosophies of the east,

788
00:52:20.901 --> 00:52:25.850
of Hinduism,
Buddhism,
Taoism,
Sufism,
and so on.

789
00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:30.830
And even the shamanic maps,
there was a lot of overlapping with the,

790
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:33.850
with the Shamanic,
uh,
cartography.
Uh,

791
00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:40.070
so I haven't forgotten your original question was about psychoanalysis.

792
00:52:41.230 --> 00:52:45.710
Uh,
now the problem is that psychoanalysis has this very narrow map,

793
00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:50.470
limited to postnatal biography into the individual unconscious,
which is,
uh,

794
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:54.920
just barely scratching the surface of what the psyche really is.

795
00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:59.760
So if you would do psychoanalysis,

796
00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:03.830
you would have to expand the conceptual framework very,

797
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:06.050
very radically.
Because otherwise,

798
00:53:06.051 --> 00:53:10.730
if you would get to something like perinatal experiences or transpersonal

799
00:53:10.731 --> 00:53:14.840
experiences,
you would not have any map if you use just Freudian,

800
00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:19.730
Freudian psychoanalysis.
So it's not the,

801
00:53:19.731 --> 00:53:24.230
it's not the question of the technique.
I think in my understanding,

802
00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:27.570
Freud was actually in a right on the right track.

803
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:31.770
He was asking questions like,
why do we have,
uh,

804
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:36.990
um,
you know,
hysteria,
why do we have,
uh,
uh,
phobias?

805
00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:40.530
Why do we have an obsessive compulsive neurosis?

806
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:45.120
Why do we have perversions and so on?
He was tracing it back,

807
00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:48.540
but unfortunately his map was very superficial.

808
00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:52.890
He did not have access to the,
uh,
to the perinatal level,

809
00:53:52.891 --> 00:53:57.760
to the transpersonal level.
So he ended up with conclusions that then,
uh,

810
00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:03.240
sometimes,
uh,
seemed absurd.
You know,
like,
uh,
uh,

811
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:08.600
suicide is killing the interjected a bed breast of your mother and so on.

812
00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:14.880
And then there was a tendency just to move away completely and not ask the

813
00:54:14.881 --> 00:54:19.830
questions about etiology that Freud's genius was trying to understand.
You know,

814
00:54:19.831 --> 00:54:24.300
why do we have a certain kinds of symptoms?
Why do we have anxiety?

815
00:54:24.301 --> 00:54:29.250
Why do we have a depression of why do we have a suicidal tendencies and so on,

816
00:54:29.251 --> 00:54:33.480
and was looking for a rational understanding for this.

817
00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:36.160
But he took it only,
uh,

818
00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:41.190
not even halfway had he had access to the perinatal level.

819
00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:43.910
He would have gotten much more,
uh,
uh,

820
00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:48.270
convincing understanding why do we have a depression,

821
00:54:48.271 --> 00:54:50.300
different forms of depression.
Why,
what,

822
00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:54.160
what does it mean when people would want,
uh,
uh,

823
00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:58.650
to kill themselves in a way that is nonviolent as compared to people who have

824
00:54:58.651 --> 00:55:03.090
the tendency to commit violence you site and so on.

825
00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:06.040
So if you expand the cartography and you,

826
00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:10.740
you add the perinatal level and the transpersonal level,
you can continue this,

827
00:55:10.741 --> 00:55:14.940
a psychoanalytic work actually and get,
um,
you know,

828
00:55:14.941 --> 00:55:17.940
some reasonable,
quite convincing answers.

829
00:55:17.941 --> 00:55:20.700
Why do we have certain kinds of symptoms?

830
00:55:20.701 --> 00:55:24.180
Why do they cluster in what we call syndrome and so on.

831
00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:28.590
And it also opens up a new radical,
different,
uh,

832
00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:31.080
approaches to psychotherapy,
which would be,

833
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:34.850
we'd have to be experiential if the roots of,
uh,

834
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:38.310
emotional problems are not just a postnatal,

835
00:55:38.311 --> 00:55:42.380
but also perinatal and transpersonal.
You cannot reach it by talking.

836
00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:46.570
He would have to actually,
uh,
use experiential,
uh,

837
00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:50.100
psychotherapy of the kind that started in the,
in the 60s,

838
00:55:50.101 --> 00:55:53.940
the developed within humanistic humanistic psychology.

839
00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:59.670
Let's,
let's go directly to that.
And,
uh,
I certainly have,

840
00:55:59.730 --> 00:56:02.580
we're going to come back to when the impossible happens.

841
00:56:02.581 --> 00:56:07.420
We're going to come back too many different pieces of your past experience and,

842
00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:08.880
and more recent projects,

843
00:56:08.881 --> 00:56:13.530
but this experiential psychotherapy in,
in,

844
00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:17.790
in an ideal world,
based on all of your experience,
what would that look like?

845
00:56:17.791 --> 00:56:21.730
What would the format look like?
Well,
we are talking about psychedelics.

846
00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:26.600
So one would be psychedelic assisted psychotherapy.
When,
uh,

847
00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:31.630
you know,
people would have sessions and then you would use talking,
uh,
uh,

848
00:56:31.631 --> 00:56:35.320
helping them to integrate,
helping them to understand.

849
00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:39.130
So they would be,
you know,
focus on the,

850
00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:44.060
on in the therapy would be on the experience,
but also,
um,

851
00:56:44.110 --> 00:56:47.290
it would be so,
uh,
at the same time,
very much what it was for Freud,

852
00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:49.510
it would be exploration of the psyche,

853
00:56:49.511 --> 00:56:53.190
getting to know the dimensions of the psyche that the different,
uh,

854
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:56.940
levels of experiences and so on.
Uh,

855
00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:02.080
but now we have powerful a non drug experiences that can actually take you to

856
00:57:02.081 --> 00:57:06.280
those levels,
to the perinatal level,
to the a transpersonal level.

857
00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:10.270
So,
um,
my late wife Christina and I developed a,

858
00:57:10.271 --> 00:57:13.030
what we call holotropic breathwork,

859
00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:16.420
where you use very simple means,

860
00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:20.050
which is a faster breezing,
some powerful,

861
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:25.110
evocative music,
a certain kind of a body work.
Uh,

862
00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:28.210
and then we also use art.

863
00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:33.211
We use a Mandela drawing and sharing groups and people have access to,

864
00:57:35.411 --> 00:57:40.000
uh,
not just to the postnatal,
a biographical level,

865
00:57:40.001 --> 00:57:44.650
but also to the perinatal and to the transpersonal level.

866
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:47.120
So there are,
you know,

867
00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:51.890
there are both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic weights of,
of uh,
uh,

868
00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:56.620
accessing these levels that have the deepest roots of,

869
00:57:56.650 --> 00:57:59.200
uh,
emotional psychosomatic problems.

870
00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:03.930
<v 1>So I'm really glad you brought up holotropic breathwork,
uh,
which is,</v>

871
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.801
as you mentioned,

872
00:58:04.801 --> 00:58:09.801
a non pharmacological or non exogenous way of inducing these holotropic states,

873
00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:17.670
uh,
which,
which I've,
I've experienced three times in different,

874
00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:22.320
uh,
workshops for holotropic breathwork.
And,
uh,
I,
I,

875
00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:24.420
I went into it,
I'm not going to lie to you,

876
00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:29.190
skeptical as someone with psychedelic experience that it could achieve anything

877
00:58:29.191 --> 00:58:29.791
comparable.

878
00:58:29.791 --> 00:58:34.791
And I was really stunned by just how,

879
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.780
uh,
how powerfully you can induce,
uh,

880
00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:43.940
these,
these non ordinary states using breath work.
Uh,

881
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:48.360
and what I observed in other people in the rooms as well,
who many of,

882
00:58:48.361 --> 00:58:53.280
many of which were,
we're skeptical as I was at the time.
So two,
two questions to,

883
00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:57.770
to uh,
dig into both the,
uh,

884
00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:01.890
supposed to be a psychedelic or entheogenic assisted and then the holotropic

885
00:59:01.891 --> 00:59:03.960
breathwork approach.
What,

886
00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:09.400
what psychedelic materials in what dosages would you potentially be using,

887
00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:13.020
uh,
with what frequency would it be once a week,
twice a week?

888
00:59:13.021 --> 00:59:15.660
Would it be determined by the patient?

889
00:59:15.690 --> 00:59:18.810
Would it be psycholytic dosing or would it be psychedelic dosing?

890
00:59:18.811 --> 00:59:21.180
How would you think about that piece of the puzzle?

891
00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:24.470
<v 3>I wouldn't do psycholytic therapy,</v>

892
00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:28.670
although I very much value the information that I got from it.
You know,

893
00:59:28.671 --> 00:59:32.540
as the self healing intelligence of the psyche,
the coexistence and,

894
00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:36.050
and to discovery of,
uh,
the,
uh,

895
00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:41.110
the dimensions that are on that expanded map being taken to,

896
00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:46.190
uh,
to the perinatal level and then to the transpersonal level.
Uh,

897
00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:49.490
I also have a lot of interesting observations.

898
00:59:50.090 --> 00:59:54.950
If you read the ramps of the human unconscious a this,
a lot of it is about,

899
00:59:55.450 --> 00:59:56.283
um,

900
00:59:56.450 --> 01:00:01.450
trying to understand how and why the world is changing under the influence of

901
01:00:01.701 --> 01:00:05.420
Lsd or some other psychedelics.
I became fascinated,
you know,

902
01:00:05.421 --> 01:00:10.160
the people saw me at different periods of their session as a different things.

903
01:00:10.161 --> 01:00:14.540
They saw me as a Jaguar.
They saw me as a toddler.
They saw me as angel,

904
01:00:14.541 --> 01:00:17.320
they saw me as a supreme judge,
uh,

905
01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:22.850
or they look around the treatment room and sometimes the,
the feeling that,
uh,

906
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:27.410
they are on the death row.
Sometimes Kevin in the Pacific,
a symptom,

907
01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.810
sometimes it was a Bordello and so on.

908
01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:32.390
So I did the kind of frothy and work on it,

909
01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:36.560
trying to understand how it condensed,
you know,
different levels of the material.

910
01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:37.640
Uh,

911
01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:42.640
so I got a good understanding of the dynamics of the postnatal biography,

912
01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:48.580
but I also found out that it was not the most effective way of getting therapy,

913
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:55.490
therapeutic results.
So then,
uh,
already in Prague I increased the dosage,

914
01:00:55.570 --> 01:01:00.050
I started using music and uh,
and the headphones eye shades.

915
01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:04.430
And this is how we did the whole research,
uh,
at Spring Grove,

916
01:01:04.431 --> 01:01:05.780
the American research when I,

917
01:01:05.781 --> 01:01:09.560
when I came to the United States there you can very,

918
01:01:09.561 --> 01:01:12.890
very powerful transformation,
you know,

919
01:01:12.891 --> 01:01:17.360
within there then six,
eight hours of the high dose.

920
01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:21.440
Uh,
but you don't have any idea why that happened.

921
01:01:21.441 --> 01:01:24.290
You don't understand the mechanism of the change.

922
01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:27.450
It resembles the material that journey.

923
01:01:27.451 --> 01:01:32.451
Rosen described when he studied the experiences of people who did suicidal jumps

924
01:01:33.201 --> 01:01:38.040
from a golden gate bridge and,
and,
um,
the bay,

925
01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:40.580
the bay bridge,

926
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:44.750
he found that people who survive with which is about 1%,

927
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:50.230
they usually a survival it unscathed and they experience powerful transformation

928
01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:55.580
within the three seconds that it took to get from the fall,

929
01:01:55.581 --> 01:01:57.590
from the railing to the surface of the water,

930
01:01:58.130 --> 01:02:03.130
and then maybe about eight minutes in cold water before they were rescued.

931
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:08.560
Uh,
um,
again,
powerful,
powerful changes that you know,

932
01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.750
you wouldn't achieve by a year or so of psychoanalysis.
But,
uh,

933
01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:15.640
there was no understanding what,
what happened.
Uh,

934
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:18.890
now with this history of the psycholytic therapy,

935
01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:23.960
I have now some idea about what is happening in these high dose sessions,

936
01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:28.440
but in a very condensed,
very rapid,
rapid way.
So by high dose,

937
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:33.270
what does that generally mean?
A state once more.

938
01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:37.710
Oh,
by high dose,
how many micrograms would you generally be using?

939
01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:41.220
Okay.
I would probably use now a dosage is like a,
you know,

940
01:02:41.221 --> 01:02:45.450
300 or even 400 to 400 micrograms,

941
01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:50.880
which uh,
you know,
might be in some instances it's not very frequently.

942
01:02:50.881 --> 01:02:54.390
It might be a challenge the management of the,
of the session,

943
01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:58.770
but you generally get much more powerful transformation.
Also cleaner.

944
01:02:59.250 --> 01:03:01.170
Actually if you use smaller dosages,

945
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:06.060
there is a tendency sometimes to actually activate what happens and people have

946
01:03:06.061 --> 01:03:09.100
more of a chance to,
to resist it if there are areas,

947
01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.640
areas that they don't want to go into.

948
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:16.670
So I consider the high dosages if this proper management to be more effective

949
01:03:17.581 --> 01:03:18.510
therapeutically,

950
01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:25.880
I would use now that smaller dosages if we continue the exploration of the

951
01:03:26.611 --> 01:03:31.170
psyche,
you know,
that's,
that's where lower dosages are.
Sydney very useful.

952
01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.580
And I'm very sorry that this is not happening with,
uh,

953
01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.900
with psychedelics in this new renaissance.

954
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:41.910
With that we don't continue the Freudian work where we are trying to,
to go to,

955
01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:46.080
to find what the roots are trying to understand the etiology.

956
01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:50.970
Now in these,
in these later,
uh,
Dsm,

957
01:03:50.971 --> 01:03:54.320
the diagnostic and statistical statistical manual,
uh,

958
01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:59.160
they moved completely from any question of etiology.
You know,
they now just,

959
01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:02.770
uh,
describe the,
uh,
the symptoms.
They use,

960
01:04:02.771 --> 01:04:07.210
what they call neoprep alien,
uh,
approach.
Uh,
Mel crap.

961
01:04:07.211 --> 01:04:11.610
Berlin was the,
uh,
the person who did the first diagnosis in a,

962
01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:16.260
in a psychiatry at the turn of the 19th and 20th century.

963
01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:19.410
Um,
dementia,
pray Cox,

964
01:04:19.411 --> 01:04:23.970
which was the original name for schizophrenia and manic depressive disorder.

965
01:04:23.971 --> 01:04:28.530
Those were the,
the first two diagnosis in psychiatry and what he did,

966
01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:31.890
he just simply described the symptoms that these patients have.

967
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:36.300
And now the tendency in psychiatry is to go to the neoprep alien.

968
01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:41.280
Like in the DSM.
You don't ask the question of why do we have a depression?

969
01:04:41.281 --> 01:04:45.060
Why do we have suicidal tendencies?
Uh,
you know,
uh,

970
01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:47.430
why do you have different psychosomatic disorders?

971
01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.340
It's just simply describing the symptoms.

972
01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:55.350
And I think there is tremendous field of discovery which would be doing

973
01:04:55.351 --> 01:05:00.090
individual cases.
Like initially in psychoanalysis,
you had,
uh,

974
01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:04.530
I think about 1500 psychoanalysts all over the world who were seeing their

975
01:05:04.531 --> 01:05:05.610
patients.
And they were,

976
01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:09.780
they were describing what they observed and it was published in journals and so

977
01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:14.460
on until they ended up with the psychoanalytic understanding of,

978
01:05:14.461 --> 01:05:17.040
uh,
emotional psychosomatic disorders.

979
01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:19.960
Do you find in AutoFair Nichols book,

980
01:05:19.961 --> 01:05:23.980
the psychoanalytic theory of a neurosis?
Uh,

981
01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:29.290
um,
so we need,
we need to continue that kind of work.

982
01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:32.680
This would be something for psychoanalysts to do,
you know,

983
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:35.980
to continue Freud's exploration of the psyche,

984
01:05:35.981 --> 01:05:40.660
trying to understand the psyche,
understand why we have symptoms and syndromes.

985
01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:45.190
Uh,
but not keeping it just on the,
uh,
on,
uh,

986
01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:49.750
um,
the postnatal level in the etiology.

987
01:05:49.751 --> 01:05:54.010
I think that was the word that I heard earlier is that the exploration of the Y

988
01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:58.030
we experienced closers.
Yes.
Causes,
why do we have that?
So Freud,

989
01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:03.370
Freud had the concept of the development of the libido,
the oral phase when,

990
01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:04.240
uh,

991
01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:09.240
the sensual feelings that are associated with nursing and the of the,

992
01:06:09.550 --> 01:06:14.530
the passive oral,
and then the active oral when,
uh,
um,
the,

993
01:06:14.531 --> 01:06:17.410
the infant starts biting his teeth and so on.

994
01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:22.810
And then it moved to the anal phase at the time to have toilet training.

995
01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:26.950
And then refined toilet training,
which had to do with urination.

996
01:06:26.951 --> 01:06:31.210
That was the urethra station.
Then he talked about the phallic stage,

997
01:06:31.570 --> 01:06:34.030
which was the stage where the focus is on the,

998
01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:39.120
on the genitals and the clitoris in girls and the penis of the boys.

999
01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:43.330
And then where you have the [inaudible],
uh,
complex and you know,

1000
01:06:43.331 --> 01:06:47.500
the castration complex and all those things.
Um,
which was very,

1001
01:06:47.501 --> 01:06:52.240
very interesting way of thinking,
but it didn't go deep enough.
So,

1002
01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:57.250
uh,
you,
you ended up with very unconvincing interpretations.
But,

1003
01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:01.630
uh,
no,
I have tried in my books to,
uh,

1004
01:07:01.930 --> 01:07:06.820
continue and see how you would understand,
uh,
in a much deeper way.

1005
01:07:06.970 --> 01:07:10.490
Why would we have these things?
Do we have depression,

1006
01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:13.780
different types of depression,
suicidal tendencies?
You know,

1007
01:07:13.781 --> 01:07:17.740
why do we have symptoms like a headache and,
and many,

1008
01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:21.730
many a neurotic patients have problems breathing and so on.

1009
01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:23.290
Where does that come from?

1010
01:07:23.830 --> 01:07:28.720
Why do we end up with psychosomatic paints for which there is no,
uh,

1011
01:07:28.721 --> 01:07:32.260
organic a finding?
So if you expand the cartography,

1012
01:07:32.261 --> 01:07:37.180
you can really get a much fuller understanding.
You know,
Freud,

1013
01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:40.630
at a certain point when he discovered the individual unconscious,

1014
01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:43.420
he compared the psyche to an iceberg.

1015
01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.650
He said what we thought the psyche was is just a surface,

1016
01:07:47.651 --> 01:07:51.160
like the part of the iceberg that's showing above the surface.

1017
01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:53.710
And psychoanalysis shows you,
uh,

1018
01:07:53.711 --> 01:07:58.150
also the submerged a part of the iceberg.
Now,

1019
01:07:58.151 --> 01:08:01.250
if you now bring psychedelics,
you have to change the,

1020
01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:03.280
the simile or the metaphor,

1021
01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:07.330
you would have to say what classical psychoanalysis discovered.

1022
01:08:07.570 --> 01:08:12.570
It's just barely the surface is the part of the iceberg that's showing a four

1023
01:08:13.021 --> 01:08:13.960
psycho analyst.

1024
01:08:14.410 --> 01:08:19.410
And there is an enormous part of the psyche that remained hidden even for,

1025
01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:25.240
for a traditional psychoanalysis.
So let me ask you this.

1026
01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:29.180
If Joseph Campbell,
I just,
let me just find sentence,
which I cannot resist.

1027
01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:30.850
Joseph Campbell and you know,

1028
01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:35.420
the wonderful mythologies that is this incredible Irish humor.

1029
01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:40.130
He put it differently.
He said Freud was fishing while it's sitting on a whale.

1030
01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:48.960
<v 1>Uh,
the,
the,
you've,
you have seen so many things,</v>

1031
01:08:48.961 --> 01:08:53.460
experienced so many things.
Uh,
let's just call it roughly 4,000,

1032
01:08:53.461 --> 01:08:57.920
500 different sessions.
You've thought of all these different modalities.
Uh,

1033
01:08:58.260 --> 01:08:59.280
looking at my very,

1034
01:08:59.281 --> 01:09:04.281
very limited personal experience and what I've observed in other people,

1035
01:09:05.970 --> 01:09:06.540
I've,

1036
01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:11.540
I've certainly seen as you have some incredible examples of transformation,

1037
01:09:11.791 --> 01:09:15.840
people who have seemingly resolved,
uh,

1038
01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:21.300
chronic depression or anxiety disorders,
eating disorders,
uh,
and,

1039
01:09:21.330 --> 01:09:23.430
and experienced incredible healing,

1040
01:09:23.610 --> 01:09:28.570
that that seems to have a persistent effect after experiencing,
uh,

1041
01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:32.940
these,
these deep psychedelic states.
I've also observed,

1042
01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:34.213
uh,

1043
01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:39.770
not a small number of people who collect interesting drug experiences or

1044
01:09:40.591 --> 01:09:41.760
psychedelic experiences,

1045
01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:46.110
but don't seem to experience or resolve any deeper healing.

1046
01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:49.980
What do you think separates those,
those two groups and how,

1047
01:09:50.010 --> 01:09:54.240
how can you increase the likelihood of real healing,

1048
01:09:54.270 --> 01:09:55.410
real deep healing occurring?

1049
01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:59.830
<v 3>Well,
extremely significant.
Uh,</v>

1050
01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:04.190
is the concept of set and setting that means who gives it to whom,

1051
01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:08.270
uh,
under what circumstances?
For what purpose,
you know,

1052
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:09.830
that makes a big difference.

1053
01:10:09.831 --> 01:10:14.060
I have seen people who have taken LSD hundred times and they didn't discover

1054
01:10:14.061 --> 01:10:16.190
that it had something to do with their own psyche.

1055
01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:19.940
It was like going to the movies.
They kept their eyes open and you know,

1056
01:10:20.150 --> 01:10:24.560
things were floating around check.
People were making funny faces,

1057
01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.600
like a curious kind of interesting experience,

1058
01:10:26.601 --> 01:10:31.010
but had no idea that the way they perceive the environment is actually a result

1059
01:10:31.011 --> 01:10:32.720
of the projection from their own unconscious.

1060
01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:37.310
So the one major difference is do you keep your eyes open and walk around,

1061
01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:41.840
let alone driving cars,
what people have been doing and so on.
Uh,
you know,

1062
01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:46.880
or doing it in the raves where,
uh,
it's an open place where,
uh,
uh,

1063
01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:50.910
people don't know what they are taking and,
uh,
the police might,
they,

1064
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:53.510
they know they do something forbidden.

1065
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:57.660
Police might show this is the worst possible set settings.

1066
01:10:57.710 --> 01:11:01.740
So you increased tremendously the risk of uh,
these,
uh,

1067
01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:07.100
experiences.
Any Regis,
they reduce the potential.
Uh,
so that's,

1068
01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:11.300
that's important.
Uh,
so if you come,
if you come with an intention,

1069
01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:15.780
the self exploration eeling for me,

1070
01:11:15.781 --> 01:11:20.340
for my first LSD session,
it became a spiritual quest.
Every,

1071
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:25.410
every one of my,
uh,
experiences.
Uh,
I had about maybe,
you know,

1072
01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:29.070
140 I those psychedelic sessions over the years.

1073
01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:34.170
It might seem like a lot,
but it's expanded over,
extended over a period of 60,

1074
01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:38.880
60 years.
So if you look at it that much,
it's not that much.

1075
01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:44.280
Uh,
so,
uh,
that is extremely,
extremely important.

1076
01:11:44.370 --> 01:11:49.050
But what is your intention?
Do you,
is serious intention for self exploration,

1077
01:11:49.051 --> 01:11:53.700
self healing?
Is it part of your spiritual quest or,
I are you doing it for,

1078
01:11:53.701 --> 01:11:58.230
for cakes?
You know,
because it's sort of a funny,
weird,

1079
01:11:58.290 --> 01:12:01.420
a weird experience.
Uh,
there's also,
uh,

1080
01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:06.240
something that Euston Smith's set,
which was very interesting.
Uh,

1081
01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:10.980
there was this whole discussion about instant on or chemical,
uh,

1082
01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:15.690
mysticism when we saw in the early LSD sessions that people had mystical

1083
01:12:15.691 --> 01:12:20.340
experiences.
Then this whole question of a chemical mysticism and Kramer,

1084
01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:23.790
what is it?
What are we launching?
And there was one,

1085
01:12:23.791 --> 01:12:28.470
a group of people who was a,
where sort of hardcore,
uh,

1086
01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:32.550
uh,
materialistic scientists who says,
well,
here you have it.

1087
01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:36.700
What the mystics are some kind of deep,
uh,

1088
01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:38.880
insights into ontology.

1089
01:12:38.881 --> 01:12:43.290
And cosmology is nothing else but a aberrations of body chemistry.
So,

1090
01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:47.760
so much for uh,
mysticism flow much for spirituality.
It's all chemistry.

1091
01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:52.710
And there was another group that was saying,
uh,
no,
what is happening?

1092
01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:57.980
There is a very special group of chemicals that can induce mystical experiences.

1093
01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.280
Those are sacred substances,
those are sacraments,

1094
01:13:02.281 --> 01:13:04.650
those are sacred medicines and so on.

1095
01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:10.220
So they took basically the position that the Shamans of native cultures took who

1096
01:13:11.131 --> 01:13:14.430
were using psychedelic plants,
like your tone on our cattle,
you know,

1097
01:13:14.431 --> 01:13:18.690
the flesh of the gods and so on the plants either where the it is.

1098
01:13:18.691 --> 01:13:23.691
So they had the mediated access to two deities and uh,

1099
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:30.990
uh,
there was this,
uh,
uh,
position also.
Uh,

1100
01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:36.080
the third position was the mystical experiences in use by psychedelics are

1101
01:13:37.890 --> 01:13:42.570
phenomenologically indistinguishable from those that are described in spiritual

1102
01:13:42.571 --> 01:13:43.404
literature,

1103
01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:47.790
but they don't have the same value to have really variable mystical experience.

1104
01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:50.790
It has to be a result of,
of prayers,

1105
01:13:50.791 --> 01:13:54.210
of meditation or it has to come as a grace.

1106
01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:57.720
There's no way you can take a pill and experience God.

1107
01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:01.950
So people like Mayor Ababa and so on,
the,
you know,
very,
very negative.

1108
01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:06.630
A guy called Zia in,
in,
in,
uh,
a British,

1109
01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:12.010
uh,
British,
uh,
uh,
Sarah login and so on.

1110
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:17.470
Uh,
so this would put it sort of in the,
in the court,
uh,

1111
01:14:17.471 --> 01:14:21.520
of a spiritual teachers to say are these variable or not.

1112
01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:26.140
And there was disagreement.
All the Tibetans for example,

1113
01:14:26.141 --> 01:14:29.610
that I have known and,
and actually being in,
uh,

1114
01:14:30.370 --> 01:14:33.510
around some of them when they had sessions,

1115
01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:37.690
they all valued it very much as something that that is,
uh,

1116
01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:41.830
accelerating your spiritual,
spiritual development.

1117
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:44.410
But just caution that this is very,

1118
01:14:44.411 --> 01:14:48.610
this is very powerful that you said to be done very,
very,
uh,

1119
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:51.670
carefully.
Uh,
on the other hand,

1120
01:14:51.671 --> 01:14:56.470
Zen Buddhist usually had difficult experiences with psychedelics because you are

1121
01:14:56.471 --> 01:14:59.970
not supposed to pay attention to what's happening.
It's called [inaudible].

1122
01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:02.770
If you just stop your past life experiences,

1123
01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:07.930
you're supposed to sit through it and cut into the no mind place.

1124
01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:13.110
It's very difficult to have 300 micrograms and to pay attention to what is,

1125
01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:17.290
you just cut through it,
you know,
uh,
no mind place.

1126
01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.240
And then this is the,

1127
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:22.810
and back now to use and Smith [inaudible] Smith set of people,

1128
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:26.860
unlike a [inaudible] Baba,
uh,
all center,

1129
01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:31.660
they had actually experiences,
uh,
he came to us,
uh,
to,

1130
01:15:31.661 --> 01:15:34.840
um,
uh,
Baltimore,
you know,
for a session.
We had the,

1131
01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:38.530
the possibility of giving sessions that legally to,
uh,

1132
01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:43.450
people who were ministers during pastoral account counseling and so on.

1133
01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:47.530
Uh,
I actually was in one of his,
one of his sessions.

1134
01:15:47.770 --> 01:15:51.640
So he knew what he was talking about and he said,
the,

1135
01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:53.110
uh,

1136
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:58.110
chemical in use mystical experiences are phenomenologically indistinguishable.

1137
01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:00.570
This was already shown in,
uh,

1138
01:16:00.610 --> 01:16:04.230
Pankey's Good Friday experiment,
uh,

1139
01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:09.300
in the Marsh Chapel,
the,
uh,
Boston University.
Very famous experiment,

1140
01:16:09.301 --> 01:16:11.650
Good Friday experiment that you'd be,

1141
01:16:11.651 --> 01:16:15.880
I know you talked about in your discussion with Michael Poland and so on.

1142
01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:17.660
And just to define very quickly,

1143
01:16:17.661 --> 01:16:20.780
I apologize for people who are listening for a phenomenal,
phenomenal,

1144
01:16:20.781 --> 01:16:24.370
logical or phenomenology.
That's the subjective report.
Yeah.
This,

1145
01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:28.170
if you look at the subjective experiences of,
uh,

1146
01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:32.620
people who had them through Lsd or Psilocybin,

1147
01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:37.600
uh,
and you compare it with what you,
what you read about in spiritual literature.

1148
01:16:38.650 --> 01:16:42.640
So that's phenom analogically indistinguishable,
but he said,

1149
01:16:42.641 --> 01:16:47.641
but the value would be very different depending on the set and that setting.

1150
01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:51.460
He said,
if a,
let's say you have a situation,

1151
01:16:51.461 --> 01:16:56.461
there is a party in Berkeley and the way it was done and there would be a fruit

1152
01:16:56.591 --> 01:17:01.591
punch and the joker comes with a handful of sugar cubes laced with LSD.

1153
01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:06.250
People think that drinking punch and then you know this,

1154
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:11.060
they out of their gourds,
there's nobody who's holding the kite string.

1155
01:17:11.061 --> 01:17:14.210
And so on.
Even under these lousy circumstances,

1156
01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:17.870
sometimes it can happen that people would have mystical experiences,

1157
01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:20.510
but it would be completely out of context.

1158
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:23.850
They would not know what to do with difficulties,
uh,
to,

1159
01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:28.730
to integrate it and become a kind of very likely alien enclave in their,

1160
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:30.103
in their life.

1161
01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:35.330
If it is somebody who is a spiritual seeker who reads literature,

1162
01:17:35.331 --> 01:17:37.700
who is doing systematic meditation,

1163
01:17:37.701 --> 01:17:42.320
and then now here is that this could accelerate and even do,

1164
01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:46.700
um,
the sessions,
you know,
in a proper set and setting the context.

1165
01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:48.093
Um,

1166
01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:52.880
so in some kind of a reverential attitude and who do then afterwards,

1167
01:17:52.881 --> 01:17:54.470
after the sessions,
some,

1168
01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:58.520
some reading and continue working on it in meditation,

1169
01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:02.840
this could become a really a powerful catalyst of a spiritual journey.

1170
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:05.990
And I think that's a,
that's the correct answer.

1171
01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:08.310
<v 1>You know.
So you've mentioned,
uh,</v>

1172
01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:12.050
seekers and a number of names.
A,

1173
01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:16.580
a friend of mine recommended,
I don't even know this name and,
um,

1174
01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:19.260
maybe a shame that I don't,
but,
uh,

1175
01:18:19.290 --> 01:18:24.270
recommended that I asked You about your experiences with Swami Muktananda and I

1176
01:18:24.271 --> 01:18:25.740
don't recognize that name,

1177
01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:30.600
but I thought that this is as good a time as any to perhaps bring it up.
Uh,

1178
01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.760
if you,
if you can answer that.

1179
01:18:34.170 --> 01:18:38.180
<v 3>Yes.
It became kind of bite important figure in,</v>

1180
01:18:38.190 --> 01:18:41.460
in our lives.
Uh,

1181
01:18:41.970 --> 01:18:46.970
I met him first about 1965 when he was on his second tour around the world.

1182
01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:54.120
He was the head of the,
of the CD Yoga,
uh,
movement,

1183
01:18:55.170 --> 01:18:58.050
um,
the,
during the first trip around the world.

1184
01:18:58.051 --> 01:19:03.000
He was actually accompanied by Ram Dass and by,
um,
uh,

1185
01:19:03.001 --> 01:19:07.980
by Vernor Earhart.
And,
uh,
again,
my,
my,

1186
01:19:08.010 --> 01:19:11.240
uh,
late wife,
Christine,

1187
01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:15.080
she came to one of his early session,
he came to Oh,
Lulu.

1188
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:19.110
And she became a devotee of his.
And so when we,

1189
01:19:19.530 --> 01:19:23.540
when we connected,
she wanted me to meet Muktananda and arrange this,
uh,

1190
01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:26.490
this Darshawn with him in,
in Oakland.

1191
01:19:27.450 --> 01:19:31.350
And I described this experience in some later experience,
again,

1192
01:19:31.351 --> 01:19:35.460
in a couple of chapters in the book when the impossible happens.

1193
01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:40.320
And it was very interesting.
I was very reluctant,
you know,
to go,

1194
01:19:40.321 --> 01:19:44.460
I was not a group person.
I would was not sort of somebody who would be,
you know,

1195
01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:47.690
at the feet of somebody.
I said,

1196
01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:52.320
the feeling that ultimately it was between me and the,
uh,
the cosmos and so on.

1197
01:19:53.070 --> 01:19:57.070
Uh,
but,
uh,
we had about 20 minutes waiting for,
uh,

1198
01:19:57.090 --> 01:20:01.600
for the Darshawn.
And at that point she told me that he was,
eh,
Eh,

1199
01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:05.550
shaivite.
Um,
it's used for,
you know,
a follower of Shiva.

1200
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:08.280
And I had of my most powerful

1201
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:11.440
<v 4>experiences in my sessions with the,
the archetype of,</v>

1202
01:20:11.441 --> 01:20:15.760
of Shiva sort of various ways.
And,
uh,

1203
01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:18.720
this sort of changed my feeling about this.

1204
01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:22.710
It would be interesting find somebody I knew that [inaudible] are using all

1205
01:20:22.711 --> 01:20:26.940
kinds of means,
including Bonk,
you know,
hashish and so on and,
and,

1206
01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:32.340
uh,
also,
uh,
dot.
Torah.
So they have,

1207
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:35.370
it's a very highly experiential,
uh,
group.

1208
01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:41.070
And so this change in my attitude to this,
uh,
for this,
uh,
interview.

1209
01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:46.740
And,
uh,
I walked in and he,
he was sitting there,
you know,

1210
01:20:46.741 --> 01:20:50.970
was the,
uh,
red ski cap was dark glasses holding a,

1211
01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:55.440
when the wound of a peacock feathers,
sent it with the center oil.

1212
01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:58.650
And,
uh,
as I told Longhi,

1213
01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:03.680
which just looked like a knight knight shirt and he sort of a back in me,

1214
01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:09.080
you know,
to come and you sit here in the chair just by him.
And,
uh,

1215
01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:13.920
he turned my head.
And,
uh,
what sort of took off his,

1216
01:21:13.921 --> 01:21:18.330
uh,
took,
uh,
or,
or sort of shifted up is a dark glasses,

1217
01:21:18.331 --> 01:21:19.890
which he very seldom did.

1218
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:24.450
And he sort of looked into my eyes like he was an ophthalmologist,
you know.

1219
01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:29.730
And the first thing that he said is,
you're a man who has seen Shiva.
He says,

1220
01:21:29.731 --> 01:21:34.340
this is very good and this just blew my mind.
I just finished,
you know,

1221
01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:37.340
describing my experiences with,

1222
01:21:37.650 --> 01:21:41.850
with Shiva and the fact that this was a very important figure.

1223
01:21:42.090 --> 01:21:45.990
And the first thing that he says,
you know,
I can tell you,
I've seen Sheila.

1224
01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:48.660
And so we had,

1225
01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:53.700
we had this long interview where I actually ask him about the Soma.

1226
01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:59.280
Dji was fascinated by,
this is the,
uh,
this,
uh,

1227
01:21:59.370 --> 01:22:03.630
psychedelic plan that was used to,
you know,
in ancient India.

1228
01:22:03.631 --> 01:22:05.190
And it was described in the rig.

1229
01:22:05.190 --> 01:22:10.190
Veda hundred over a hundred dancers in regretted are dedicated to Soma.

1230
01:22:11.490 --> 01:22:15.450
It was a plant and they were so beverage that was a produced.

1231
01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:18.740
And some of the descriptions show that those were to sweat.

1232
01:22:18.741 --> 01:22:23.040
Powerful psychedelic,
you know,
half of us is on earth,

1233
01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:26.700
half of us in heaven,
we have taken Soma.
Uh,

1234
01:22:26.970 --> 01:22:31.560
so we knew that there was a powerful psychedelic,
but the secret was lost.

1235
01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:36.460
And so I ask him,
he said,
Oh yeah,
well,
you know,
on my birthday,
uh,

1236
01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:41.500
the vedic priests come down to [inaudible] Puri and they do so much ceremony.

1237
01:22:42.210 --> 01:22:46.230
You can come as my gift,
I guess,
you know,
uh,
I will introduce you.

1238
01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:51.600
And then he died before we could actually do it.
So,

1239
01:22:51.870 --> 01:22:53.580
to make a long story short,

1240
01:22:53.610 --> 01:22:58.610
then we were walking out of this his room and it was standing at the door and he

1241
01:23:00.241 --> 01:23:03.940
looked at us and says,
uh,
you come to,
um,

1242
01:23:04.260 --> 01:23:06.220
our intensives,
we have two intense

1243
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:10.950
<v 3>intensives of cash on Kashmir Shaivism,
uh,
which is,
uh,</v>

1244
01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:14.650
this kind of,
uh,
um,
um,

1245
01:23:15.190 --> 01:23:19.690
Mahajana,
uh,
branch of Buddhism,
uh,

1246
01:23:19.810 --> 01:23:24.430
that,
uh,
started in Kashmir when in the eighth century,

1247
01:23:24.431 --> 01:23:24.901
a rush.

1248
01:23:24.901 --> 01:23:29.901
She had a vision of a summer rocks near Srinagar and he went there and,

1249
01:23:30.821 --> 01:23:34.060
uh,
exposed some,
uh,
uh,
cover,
uh,

1250
01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:37.660
vegetable cover and they were,
uh,

1251
01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:41.980
inscriptions carved in the rock that became then the Shiva Sutras.

1252
01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:46.390
This was like the Bible of,
of Kashmir Shaivism.
So he said,
come,

1253
01:23:46.391 --> 01:23:49.240
this is on Kashmir Shaivism.
He looked at me and says,

1254
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:54.190
this will be very important,
very interesting for you.
And so of course we did.

1255
01:23:54.850 --> 01:23:57.400
And when I listened to the Swami,

1256
01:23:57.401 --> 01:24:01.780
who started describing what the Kashmir Shaivism,
uh,
was,

1257
01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:05.050
I had the feeling that he was stealing,
uh,
you know,

1258
01:24:05.051 --> 01:24:08.500
sentences and paragraphs from,
uh,

1259
01:24:08.530 --> 01:24:12.880
an article which I had written,
I think 1969,

1260
01:24:13.150 --> 01:24:18.150
which was called a secretary ontology and cosmology observations from LSD

1261
01:24:18.161 --> 01:24:23.000
sessions.
So the interesting question about,
you know,

1262
01:24:23.050 --> 01:24:27.880
what is the common denominator between experiences that people have with LSD,

1263
01:24:27.881 --> 01:24:32.290
this strange substance that Swisscom is discovered in,
in Switzerland,

1264
01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:36.340
and something that was found written,
uh,
on the,

1265
01:24:36.341 --> 01:24:38.710
on the Rock in Srinagar in the eighth century.

1266
01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:42.760
And so then we started sort of going to

1267
01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:49.210
these intensives whenever we were,
we are need to Muktananda.

1268
01:24:49.690 --> 01:24:53.980
And then we actually did a large transpersonal conference,
uh,
in,
uh,

1269
01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:58.360
in,
um,
Bombay or Mumbai.

1270
01:24:59.190 --> 01:25:03.790
Um,
so it's 1982,
which was on ancient wisdom and modern science,

1271
01:25:03.791 --> 01:25:08.791
bringing together spiritual teachers and people from the new paradigm circles,

1272
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:13.780
like for each of Fritjof,
capra and you know,
others.
So,

1273
01:25:14.010 --> 01:25:18.070
uh,
that was our,
that was our history where we've mentioned,

1274
01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:21.490
we've mentioned the title,
you know,
when the impossible happens a few times.

1275
01:25:21.491 --> 01:25:25.090
I figured we might as well jump into it and uh,

1276
01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:29.440
discuss certainly the,
perhaps the reasons for writing the book,

1277
01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:32.550
but also some of the stories I would imagine.
Well,

1278
01:25:32.551 --> 01:25:34.990
I would love to hear some of the stories and I would imagine people listening

1279
01:25:34.991 --> 01:25:38.600
would love to hear some of the stories as well.
Well,
Tim,

1280
01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:43.360
what happened to us that our house in the Middle Valley burn down in,
uh,

1281
01:25:44.290 --> 01:25:45.640
in 2001.

1282
01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:49.420
And I lost my whole a referential library.

1283
01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:52.780
So it was difficult to write books like I used to wear,

1284
01:25:52.781 --> 01:25:56.500
you have to refer to people's work and take passages of it and so on.

1285
01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:01.060
And so I decided to write a biography,
but you know,

1286
01:26:01.061 --> 01:26:04.040
my life has been pretty,
pretty intense,
pretty

1287
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.460
<v 4>rich.
So the question was,
you know,
what do I select?</v>

1288
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.000
And then I decided to select observations and experiences from my life that,

1289
01:26:13.670 --> 01:26:17.780
uh,
current materialistic science would consider it to be impossible.
This,

1290
01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:22.260
this is not,
not possible if the materialistic paradigm is,

1291
01:26:22.261 --> 01:26:25.160
is accurate.
So I selected them.

1292
01:26:25.161 --> 01:26:27.860
So it's a selected of selection of these stories.

1293
01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:33.610
And about one third of this is a dedicated to amazing synchronicities that I

1294
01:26:35.061 --> 01:26:38.210
have a experience in my,
uh,
in my life.

1295
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:43.190
And some of the synchronicities were actually related to a Muktananda.

1296
01:26:43.191 --> 01:26:48.191
So there are two chapters of it describing what happened between us and,

1297
01:26:48.541 --> 01:26:51.950
and uh,
Muktananda what is a synchronicity?

1298
01:26:53.690 --> 01:26:58.190
Well,
synchronicity is something that a Carl Gustaf young brought into the,

1299
01:26:58.191 --> 01:27:03.191
to the attention of a Western scientists after hesitating for 20 years

1300
01:27:03.650 --> 01:27:08.540
collecting for 20 years,
uh,
observations,
uh,
because you realize this is a,

1301
01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:14.020
uh,
against this is undermining the cornerstone of materialistic science where,

1302
01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:18.710
uh,
the basic principle is linear causality.
You know,
the,

1303
01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:23.120
what we experience is a chain of a linear causality.

1304
01:27:23.121 --> 01:27:26.240
Everything that happens as a course and has an as an effect,

1305
01:27:27.530 --> 01:27:31.610
and this works in Western materialistic science with the exception of,
uh,
the,

1306
01:27:31.611 --> 01:27:33.730
the costs of causes.
You know,
what,
what,
uh,

1307
01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:36.050
caused the beginning of the university are we,

1308
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:39.940
we don't go there very frequently because we don't have any,

1309
01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:44.240
any good answers for that.
Uh,
now what he showed up,

1310
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:48.200
that there are situations where,
uh,

1311
01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:52.910
there's a meaningful correlation or connection between something that's an

1312
01:27:52.911 --> 01:27:54.590
interest psychic event,
like a,

1313
01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:59.570
like a dream or a vision or a psychedelic experience and something that happens

1314
01:27:59.571 --> 01:28:00.900
in material,
the universe,

1315
01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:05.930
in the material universe or what we call so called objective reality,

1316
01:28:05.931 --> 01:28:10.640
consensus,
uh,
uh,
reality.
And now this should not be happening.
I mean,

1317
01:28:10.641 --> 01:28:14.810
our psyche should be reflecting the material universe,
which is out there.

1318
01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:19.790
It should not get into a kind of playful interaction with it.
Okay.

1319
01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:24.410
So let me,
let me just give you a couple of major examples from,
from,

1320
01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.040
from that book.
Uh,
I,

1321
01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:30.640
I'm referring to the experience that I had with Joseph Campbell again,
you know,

1322
01:28:30.710 --> 01:28:32.730
great,
great.
Uh,
uh,

1323
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:36.670
mythologist greatest mythologist over the 20th century,
probably of,

1324
01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.000
of all time.

1325
01:28:38.630 --> 01:28:43.610
And he used to come regularly to SLN and do workshop and he went to our workshop

1326
01:28:43.611 --> 01:28:47.630
months launch where substance,
so on.
And we were doing some workshops with him.

1327
01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:53.380
And in one of these,
uh,
workshops,
he started,
he was talking about young,
he was,

1328
01:28:53.381 --> 01:28:58.040
you know,
great supporter and,
and,
and a very enthusiastic about,
uh,

1329
01:28:58.041 --> 01:28:59.270
about a young,

1330
01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:04.590
and he mentioned synchronicity and somebody didn't understand it and say,
Joe,

1331
01:29:04.591 --> 01:29:08.790
could you explain what synchronicity is?
And,
uh,

1332
01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:12.300
he first gave this official definition of Young's,
you know,

1333
01:29:12.301 --> 01:29:16.960
this is a meaningful connection across time or space,
uh,

1334
01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:21.690
between an inter psychic event and something that happened in the material
world.

1335
01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:26.280
But he says,
I will give you an example.
He said,
you know,

1336
01:29:26.281 --> 01:29:31.281
we were living in downtown Manhattan on the 14th floor of a high rise building.

1337
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:39.150
And my office had two sets of windows.
One was overlooking six avenue,

1338
01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:41.300
which was,
you know,
not nothing interesting,

1339
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:46.510
like many streets in Manhattan about the other set was overlooking the Hudson

1340
01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:48.810
River.
And there was a beautiful view.

1341
01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:53.010
So these two windows were open all the time.
The others,

1342
01:29:53.011 --> 01:29:57.570
we were open just for cleaning.
Nobody was bothered to open those windows.

1343
01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:03.660
And then he said,
and uh,
at the time I was working on,

1344
01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:04.523
uh,

1345
01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:09.560
the first volume of what was supposed to be a world mythology and it's called

1346
01:30:10.650 --> 01:30:12.240
the way of the animal powers.

1347
01:30:12.690 --> 01:30:16.560
And that first volume is about shamanic mythologies of the world.

1348
01:30:17.550 --> 01:30:22.500
And then Joe said that I was working on the chapter about Kalahari Bushmen,

1349
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.700
the Bushmen,
you know,
living in the Kalahari desert.

1350
01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:30.180
And he said that in their mythology,
a major,

1351
01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:33.720
a heroic figure is praying mantis.

1352
01:30:35.010 --> 01:30:39.540
And so I,
my desk was covered with papers and pictures,
uh,

1353
01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:44.580
related to the mentees and the,
uh,
the Kalahari bushmen.

1354
01:30:45.330 --> 01:30:47.190
And there was Lauren Vander posts,

1355
01:30:47.191 --> 01:30:51.180
a book about his childhood when he hit a Bushman nanny.

1356
01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:53.340
And it was,
he,

1357
01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:58.580
the Lauren under post described how this nanny was seem to be communicating with

1358
01:30:59.991 --> 01:31:04.500
the,
with the praying mantis that they were having sort of conversations.

1359
01:31:04.501 --> 01:31:08.920
And uh,
you know,
when the,
with the movements,
the,
uh,

1360
01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:11.220
the praying mantis seem to be responding to him,

1361
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:16.650
but to her and then sits in the middle of this a work,

1362
01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:21.210
I suddenly had this totally irrational impulse to go and open.

1363
01:31:21.211 --> 01:31:24.570
One of the windows that we never open and I stick,

1364
01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:29.400
stuck my head out and turn it,
uh,
automatically,
uh,
to the side.

1365
01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:33.690
And they're on the 14th floor of a high rise building on Manhattan.

1366
01:31:33.930 --> 01:31:38.930
There was a great specimen of a praying mantis sort of climbing up the,

1367
01:31:39.090 --> 01:31:44.040
uh,
the,
uh,
building and turned,
uh,
her,

1368
01:31:44.041 --> 01:31:48.510
his head toward,
uh,
Joe.
And you said,
uh,

1369
01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:49.560
uh,

1370
01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:54.560
I took a close look and the way a vendor post described it was to it,

1371
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:59.350
there was something,
uh,
that make the prep fragment is looked like a Bushman.

1372
01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:04.660
So anyways,
so that's the,
that's historic.
And so,
you know,

1373
01:32:04.661 --> 01:32:09.550
it's possible to imagine that somehow praying mentees got into Manhattan,

1374
01:32:09.551 --> 01:32:14.080
somebody has it as a pet or whatever and it got to that place.

1375
01:32:14.410 --> 01:32:18.130
So,
but that in itself is not very probable happening,

1376
01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:21.480
but the fact that it's happened,
you know,
uh,

1377
01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:24.670
in such a way that at the time when chose had,

1378
01:32:24.671 --> 01:32:27.790
was filled with thoughts about praying mantis and so on,

1379
01:32:28.450 --> 01:32:32.710
and he had this irrational impulse to go and open the window that he never

1380
01:32:32.711 --> 01:32:36.340
opened and he looks out and you know,
there is a right,

1381
01:32:36.341 --> 01:32:40.750
there is a praying mantis and actually turns toward him and gives him a meat.

1382
01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:45.490
Got what he felt was meaningful.
Look,
that's pretty mind blowing synchronicity.

1383
01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:48.510
So,
you know,
uh,

1384
01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:53.500
young hesitated 20 years before he presented it at 1951 in,
uh,

1385
01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:56.350
in one of the era knows conferences.

1386
01:32:56.920 --> 01:33:01.510
And it was presented together with a talk by Wolfgang Pauli,

1387
01:33:01.511 --> 01:33:05.830
one of the founders of quantum physics who was,
uh,
first,
uh,

1388
01:33:06.370 --> 01:33:10.660
um,
Young's patient and then a very close,
very close,
uh,

1389
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:15.250
friend that,
let me just to quickly give you another example,

1390
01:33:15.251 --> 01:33:19.960
which is the most mind blowing a synchronicity from,

1391
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.830
uh,
my life has please at.

1392
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:26.470
This happened during our first trip to China where we were bringing

1393
01:33:26.471 --> 01:33:30.550
transpersonal psychology and,
uh,
holotropic breathwork to China.

1394
01:33:31.630 --> 01:33:36.630
And we did a workshop and broad topic breathwork workshop in Janeane,

1395
01:33:37.241 --> 01:33:41.830
which is the birth place of,
uh,
of Confucius.
And,

1396
01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:46.540
uh,
we were having dinner and one of the participants,
uh,
uh,

1397
01:33:46.570 --> 01:33:51.450
came to me and said,
Stan,
I had an experience about you,
uh,

1398
01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:56.050
in my dream last night.
And,
uh,
um,

1399
01:33:56.140 --> 01:34:00.460
I said,
um,
what was it?
And,
uh,

1400
01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:03.010
she said,
uh,

1401
01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:08.520
it was my great grandmother who showed up and told me that we have an important

1402
01:34:08.681 --> 01:34:11.710
stone in our family for generations,

1403
01:34:12.010 --> 01:34:15.550
and that's a stone should go to doctor gruff.

1404
01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:21.010
So she actually brought it,
she was holding a beautiful,

1405
01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:25.810
beautiful blue velvet bag and opened it.

1406
01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:30.700
And it was a fossil,
a nautilus,
the ammonite,

1407
01:34:30.701 --> 01:34:35.020
you know,
which are the,
that are the ancestors of,
of,

1408
01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:40.030
uh,
the Nautilus.
Very,
very beautiful for sale.
Now,

1409
01:34:41.170 --> 01:34:46.150
the interesting thing was that it was picked up at the top of Mount Everest.

1410
01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:50.800
I didn't know at that time that it's possible that this is a marine.

1411
01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:55.090
Mollusk you see,
so it comes from the bottom of the ocean and it's some,
it got,

1412
01:34:55.130 --> 01:35:00.090
uh,
during the creation of Mri,
got to the top of Mount Everest.

1413
01:35:00.930 --> 01:35:04.560
Now,
what is interesting about this that,
uh,
when,
uh,

1414
01:35:04.561 --> 01:35:09.561
I started a transpersonal psychology international association of transpersonal

1415
01:35:09.931 --> 01:35:13.740
psychology and the series of international conferences,

1416
01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:17.160
we were thinking what would be the proper logo for,
uh,

1417
01:35:17.190 --> 01:35:20.790
the international transpersonal association.
And we came up with the,

1418
01:35:21.090 --> 01:35:23.250
with the chamber to Nautilus,
you know,

1419
01:35:23.251 --> 01:35:27.810
which is a beautiful piece of sacred geometry.
So for decades,

1420
01:35:27.811 --> 01:35:29.820
we were using it on the stationary.

1421
01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:33.900
It was on all the programs of a transpersonal psychology.

1422
01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:39.150
So,
uh,
you know,
here we are bringing transpersonal psychology to China.

1423
01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:43.350
And a great grandmother,
uh,

1424
01:35:43.410 --> 01:35:47.000
shows up in the dream of a woman who actually was called main,

1425
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:49.290
which is the Chinese name for dream,

1426
01:35:50.250 --> 01:35:54.910
and tells her to bring me this,
uh,
this sale nautilus uni,

1427
01:35:54.911 --> 01:35:59.670
which was taken from the bottom of the ocean to the top of the,
uh,

1428
01:35:59.671 --> 01:36:04.050
of,
uh,
uh,
uh,
the highest mountain in the world.

1429
01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:08.130
Uh,
according to the estimates,
uh,

1430
01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:11.320
mls were born about,
uh,

1431
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:16.800
about 50 million years ago during the collision of the,
of the tectonic plates.

1432
01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:21.730
So this was,
you know,
at least 50 million years old,
uh,
uh,

1433
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:26.130
fossil nautilus euro symbol of the international transpersonal association.

1434
01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:28.980
So of course the Chinese press,
you know,

1435
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.130
didn't describe how great that Holotropic breathwork was,

1436
01:36:32.131 --> 01:36:36.450
but they all focused on this incredible synchronicity,
you know.

1437
01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:40.990
<v 1>Are there,
are there any,
uh,
other,
uh,</v>

1438
01:36:41.710 --> 01:36:44.320
stories or phenomena,

1439
01:36:44.321 --> 01:36:48.940
experiences that are difficult to explain in that book are outside of one of the

1440
01:36:48.941 --> 01:36:52.810
impossible happens that are related to a psychedelic sessions?

1441
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:59.180
<v 4>Well,
there are of course,
experiences of the,
um,
a out of body experience.</v>

1442
01:36:59.181 --> 01:37:04.070
It's in near death experiences.
You know,
where people who are in a state of,
uh,

1443
01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:08.950
uh,
clinical death,
cardiac death,
or even a flat,

1444
01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:13.660
uh,
EEG have experiences.
They might be watching the,

1445
01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:18.420
the procedure from,
uh,
from the ceiling.
Uh,
uh,

1446
01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:21.070
so that when they brought back to consciousness,

1447
01:37:21.071 --> 01:37:23.590
they are able to describe the procedure.

1448
01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:29.220
There's one case where this was happening to a woman who had to be frozen

1449
01:37:29.621 --> 01:37:32.590
because they needed to get to the tumor at the base of the skull.

1450
01:37:33.370 --> 01:37:37.790
And so she had fled,
uh,
electrocardiogram fled,
uh,
electric answer,

1451
01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:42.280
fellow Graham.
And at the same time,
this is the most detailed description of the,

1452
01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:47.020
uh,
of the surgical procedure that we have or she was able to,

1453
01:37:47.290 --> 01:37:51.250
to draw the instruments that they were using and so on.

1454
01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:54.160
So there are many,
many of these.
And,
uh,
we had,

1455
01:37:54.190 --> 01:37:58.320
we had a couple of those experiences with our own,
uh,
cancer patients.

1456
01:37:58.321 --> 01:38:03.310
So there's one of them is described in the book.
Uh,
uh,

1457
01:38:03.610 --> 01:38:07.430
there is,
um,
there is one chapter which I called,
uh,

1458
01:38:07.630 --> 01:38:12.630
Unorthodox psychiatry where people experience healing in connection with the

1459
01:38:12.861 --> 01:38:17.520
experiences that you know,
wouldn't make any,
any sense to current psychiatrists.

1460
01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:19.500
What,
what would be an example of that?

1461
01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:23.560
So there was one situation where we had a five day

1462
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:29.070
workshop at SLN and a woman came who had four,

1463
01:38:29.130 --> 01:38:33.930
two last two years,
had had a very bad depression,

1464
01:38:33.931 --> 01:38:38.931
which a psychiatrist would consider to be what's called a endogenous,

1465
01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:43.620
which of course doesn't mean anything and endogenous means generated from
within.

1466
01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:48.240
Um,
but the characteristic is that it's worse in the morning.

1467
01:38:48.241 --> 01:38:52.980
So she got out of the bed and it took her like a couple hours before she managed

1468
01:38:52.981 --> 01:38:56.210
to brush her teeth and,
and,
uh,
you know,
uh,

1469
01:38:57.810 --> 01:39:02.670
get dressed properly and so on.
So she had,
uh,
um,

1470
01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:08.340
two sessions,
uh,
with us,
which we had in the five days at SLN.

1471
01:39:09.090 --> 01:39:13.220
And,
uh,
you know,
they were pretty powerful things from childhood and she was,
uh,

1472
01:39:13.890 --> 01:39:18.420
reliving her birth.
But a Friday in the morning,

1473
01:39:18.421 --> 01:39:22.180
which was the last day she came and she,
uh,
uh,

1474
01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:27.630
actually experience some intensification of these feelings.

1475
01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:31.620
So we,
uh,
ask her to lie down.

1476
01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:33.450
We had a different,

1477
01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:37.680
different program for that more naked or the conclusion of the five days,

1478
01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:42.300
but it was clear that we had to do something.
So she laid down in the,

1479
01:39:42.301 --> 01:39:45.220
in the middle of the room and,
uh,

1480
01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:50.400
we just told her just to go with the experiences is she didn't even do more

1481
01:39:50.401 --> 01:39:54.180
breathing.
And she again,
uh,

1482
01:39:54.270 --> 01:39:58.150
completed a little something,
but the,
um,
experience of,
uh,

1483
01:39:58.190 --> 01:40:02.760
the birth biological births and then went to,
went into this very strange,
uh,

1484
01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:08.080
uh,
serious of movements where does look like sort of,
uh,
uh,

1485
01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:12.780
praying or worshiping something end up in a,
in a sitting position.

1486
01:40:13.170 --> 01:40:17.970
And then this monotonous chant,
repetitive chant,
came,
uh,

1487
01:40:17.971 --> 01:40:20.910
in a language that,
that we did not understand.

1488
01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:26.100
And this was going for quite a while.
And then it ended and she,

1489
01:40:26.101 --> 01:40:30.660
uh,
laid back and she was just completely blissed out,
you know,
in a,

1490
01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:35.580
in an aesthetic state.
Uh,
the group was reacting in a strange way.

1491
01:40:35.581 --> 01:40:40.140
People were ending up in their lotis positions.
Um,
you know,

1492
01:40:40.190 --> 01:40:44.880
uh,
some of them crying for unknown reasons.

1493
01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:48.270
And we had a Jewish,

1494
01:40:48.271 --> 01:40:53.271
a psycho analyst from a bonus IRS participating in this,

1495
01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:58.030
uh,
typically a five day workshop.

1496
01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:02.410
And he came to us and he said,
this is fantastic.

1497
01:41:02.620 --> 01:41:07.320
Do you understand what happened?
We said No.
Uh,

1498
01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:12.250
he said she was,
she was a chanting and perfect Sephardic language,

1499
01:41:12.370 --> 01:41:16.480
the Ladino,
which is the medieval mixture of,
of,
uh,

1500
01:41:16.510 --> 01:41:21.290
Spanish and Hebrew.
And it happened to be his hobby.
You know,

1501
01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:26.050
he will,
he knew the Sephardic a language and we say,
wow,
it's just,

1502
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:30.460
we ask him what,
what was she singing?
This is what she was singing.

1503
01:41:30.490 --> 01:41:33.460
I am suffering and I will always suffer.

1504
01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:36.280
I am crying and I will always cry.

1505
01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:40.990
I am praying and I will always pray.
Now,

1506
01:41:40.991 --> 01:41:45.991
this episode finished this two years of the exogenous depression we saw her than

1507
01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:51.820
couple of times at conferences and the depression never came back to back.

1508
01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:57.310
So the idea of,
you know,
healing,
Eh,
depressions,

1509
01:41:57.870 --> 01:42:02.260
pretty bad depression by singing a Sephardic prayer.
It's,

1510
01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:07.060
it's a pretty unusual sort of a therapeutic,
uh,
uh,
mechanism.

1511
01:42:07.970 --> 01:42:11.800
What do you,
what do you make of that?
What do you,

1512
01:42:12.370 --> 01:42:15.000
how do you,
I have learned that,
you know,
self,
we,

1513
01:42:15.090 --> 01:42:17.530
we seen a lot of this kind of thing,

1514
01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:20.530
the B that a healing happens,

1515
01:42:20.531 --> 01:42:24.490
powerful hearing happens in the holotropic breathwork through mechanisms that we

1516
01:42:24.491 --> 01:42:27.760
don't understand.
Uh,

1517
01:42:28.330 --> 01:42:32.730
I saw before,
you know,
working with people who were in psychoanalysis.

1518
01:42:32.740 --> 01:42:37.570
So on the opposite that people,
uh,
after years of psychoanalysis,

1519
01:42:37.571 --> 01:42:39.760
they got to the point where they can give you lectures,

1520
01:42:39.761 --> 01:42:44.170
why they have the problems,
how is it related to early cannibalism and the,

1521
01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:47.080
you know,
the toilet training and her deepest problems.

1522
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:50.970
Only the problems don't change very much.
So you are,

1523
01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:56.340
you have the option to either have a very little result with what seems to be

1524
01:42:57.550 --> 01:43:01.860
intellectual understanding or a result where you have no clue what.

1525
01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:08.560
And in that particular experience with these Sephardic chanting that was with,

1526
01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:14.050
that was following breath work,

1527
01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:19.240
but not using any type of dosing of an all type of Ontario.
No,

1528
01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:22.600
we were,
you were careful not to bring in people,

1529
01:43:22.601 --> 01:43:26.650
not to bring anything into the,
you know,
the uh,

1530
01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:30.830
holotropic breathwork sessions.
Uh,
because it's the,

1531
01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:33.710
the structure is completely different.
The,

1532
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:38.350
the timing of the breathwork is different about three hours and the type of

1533
01:43:38.351 --> 01:43:42.820
music that we use.
So it would not be,

1534
01:43:42.821 --> 01:43:46.420
it would not be great set and setting.
It's not,

1535
01:43:46.450 --> 01:43:51.290
it's not structured for a psychedelic experience.
And actually this would,
uh,

1536
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:53.420
you know,
disturb.
We had one situation,

1537
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:57.740
actually there's somebody who had a black belt,
uh,

1538
01:43:58.310 --> 01:44:03.290
took it going into our,
uh,
uh,
our workshop at Sln,
uh,

1539
01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:06.020
without telling us and ended up,
you know,

1540
01:44:06.021 --> 01:44:09.310
when a pretty aggressive situation and uh,

1541
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:12.440
it's just a very disturbed the whole,
the whole session.

1542
01:44:12.441 --> 01:44:17.270
We had a hard time sort of,
um,
you know,
bringing him,

1543
01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:18.490
bringing him down.

1544
01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:20.300
<v 1>Sounds terrifying.</v>

1545
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:24.600
<v 4>You've just been in metro of principle,
you know,</v>

1546
01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:29.420
it was not only was it illegal,
but it,
it just does not,

1547
01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:33.860
does not work well in that context that's created for all atropic breasts.

1548
01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.890
<v 1>If,</v>

1549
01:44:34.890 --> 01:44:39.890
if you had to an answer the question and there might not be an answer to this or

1550
01:44:40.751 --> 01:44:42.580
there might not be an affirmative answer

1551
01:44:44.770 --> 01:44:47.470
to the question that someone posed to me,

1552
01:44:47.471 --> 01:44:50.440
which was they hadn't experienced holotropic breathwork and they ask,

1553
01:44:50.530 --> 01:44:53.290
but they did have a lot of,
uh,
sort of research experiment,

1554
01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:57.070
a experience with psychedelics and they asked what psychedelic at what dose is

1555
01:44:57.071 --> 01:45:01.810
most similar to the effects or the experience of holotropic breathwork.

1556
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:07.810
<v 4>It would be more a,
something in the category of Mdm,
a in that,
uh,</v>

1557
01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:12.410
the holotropic breathwork can create visions,
you know,
visual experiences,

1558
01:45:12.650 --> 01:45:16.550
but it's not that common as it is in,
in,
uh,

1559
01:45:16.610 --> 01:45:19.910
LSD or mescaline where you have kind of have,
you know,

1560
01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:23.080
read this fantastic fractal display.

1561
01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:28.120
So if a colorful images and so on and the whole session could be,

1562
01:45:29.361 --> 01:45:30.194
could be very,

1563
01:45:30.860 --> 01:45:35.570
very visual in the breathwork is more like an Mtma,

1564
01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:40.330
whether you have something that's a almost like on a,
uh,

1565
01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:44.840
the interface between vision and a vivid thought and so on.

1566
01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:49.730
<v 1>Uh,
and if,
uh,</v>

1567
01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:53.540
if we were to look at another,
uh,

1568
01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:57.880
subjective experience that's reported with,

1569
01:45:57.890 --> 01:46:01.250
with decent regularity,
with psychedelics,

1570
01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:03.560
specifically entity encounters.

1571
01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:08.990
And this seems to be frequently reported with say,
Iowasca or smokes,

1572
01:46:08.991 --> 01:46:10.410
eight saved once more,
uh,

1573
01:46:10.490 --> 01:46:15.140
entity and counters and countering entities that well used to be separate from

1574
01:46:15.141 --> 01:46:19.310
themselves,
seems to be quite common with Iowasca or smoked DMT.

1575
01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:23.750
Nn DMT specifically.
Uh,
what is,

1576
01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:26.870
have you seen this in breathwork?

1577
01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:32.220
And also why do you make any attempt to interpret what these things mean?

1578
01:46:33.231 --> 01:46:38.231
Or is it really left to the person experiencing it to integrate it or to heal

1579
01:46:39.021 --> 01:46:40.450
through such,
uh,

1580
01:46:40.850 --> 01:46:45.140
a perceived encounter or something that exists independently?
Uh,

1581
01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:46.530
uh,

1582
01:46:46.530 --> 01:46:50.930
<v 4>well this,
you know,
this was described of course with,
uh,
with,
uh,
payor tear,</v>

1583
01:46:50.931 --> 01:46:55.931
the Mescalito Miss Garlia then also very common with Iowasca Pachamama,

1584
01:46:58.290 --> 01:47:00.780
the mother,
mother.
Uh,
and so on.

1585
01:47:01.230 --> 01:47:05.720
The only time I had it was in an Ios concession,
uh,

1586
01:47:05.970 --> 01:47:10.590
where there was a sense of,
actually it's not true.
I had it once in a,

1587
01:47:12.150 --> 01:47:16.740
in an LSD early LSD session where there was a presence,
there was a,

1588
01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:21.840
um,
energetic presence.
I didn't see,
you know,
a figure,

1589
01:47:22.830 --> 01:47:27.570
but there was also communication,
which was a telepathic,
which was without words.

1590
01:47:28.530 --> 01:47:32.660
Uh,
this was very strange because,
uh,

1591
01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:36.180
this was at a time when we had closed boundaries.
We,

1592
01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:40.350
we couldn't even,
uh,
initiative Trevor to Russia,

1593
01:47:40.351 --> 01:47:42.090
let alone two to the west.

1594
01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:46.110
And there was this kind of entity appearing in my LSD session.

1595
01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:51.330
It was like a genie,
almost like asking,
you know,
uh,
what would you like,

1596
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:55.560
uh,
uh,
your,
your life to be like?
And I said,

1597
01:47:56.010 --> 01:48:00.480
I would like to see the world.
I would like to understand a psychosis.

1598
01:48:00.630 --> 01:48:02.100
This was the place I was in,

1599
01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:07.770
and I would like to have a job that's not the kind of a nine to five job.

1600
01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:11.880
I would like to have some kind of a freedom.
And the answer was,

1601
01:48:12.930 --> 01:48:17.640
okay,
but your task is to bring spirituality to eastern Europe and to Russia.

1602
01:48:18.450 --> 01:48:21.240
I said,
no,
I really did it.
You should know.
I'm flipping out.

1603
01:48:21.241 --> 01:48:25.650
I got to know I can't even travel to Poland.

1604
01:48:25.690 --> 01:48:30.390
Uh,
and this is promising me.
I can see the world.

1605
01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:34.950
But then of course,
it,
it happened,
you know,
then,
uh,
uh,

1606
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:40.310
developing transpersonal psychology and become very,
very popular,
um,

1607
01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:44.100
in,
in Russia.
And then 25 years ago,

1608
01:48:44.101 --> 01:48:49.050
bringing transpersonal psychology too to Czechoslovakia actually.

1609
01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:52.980
So,
so that was a fascinating synchronicity again.

1610
01:48:53.870 --> 01:48:57.690
Uh,
and then I had one in the IOWASCA session,

1611
01:48:57.691 --> 01:49:02.010
but also this was a,
this was a very,
uh,
uh,

1612
01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:05.190
intense,
but it was guiding my session was,

1613
01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:09.000
was sort of telling me what I should look,
look at how I should handle it.

1614
01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:16.200
And that's not something that you observe in,
in breathwork very often.
No.

1615
01:49:16.290 --> 01:49:17.880
Yeah,
no.
You know,

1616
01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:22.900
I actually wrote initially I wrote that I considered psychedelics to be a

1617
01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:28.200
nonspecific amplifiers.
Yes.
When I,
and,
uh,

1618
01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:30.660
it would have to be modified.

1619
01:49:30.690 --> 01:49:35.690
I actually all psychedelics can take you to the areas which I described in that

1620
01:49:36.541 --> 01:49:38.760
cartography.
You can experience something from,

1621
01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:44.160
from a child's a sufficiently important emotionally.
You can relieve your birth,

1622
01:49:44.161 --> 01:49:47.740
you can have prenatal experiences.
Even this is a,

1623
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:52.870
I almost hesitate to say that the reliving your a conception,
you know,

1624
01:49:52.871 --> 01:49:57.490
identifying with it on a cellular level with the sperm and the,
and the ovum.

1625
01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:02.020
Uh,
you can have past life experiences.
You can have archetypal experiences.

1626
01:50:02.021 --> 01:50:06.790
You can,
it can take you to that,
to the collective unconscious and so on.

1627
01:50:07.210 --> 01:50:09.490
So the cartography applies to all of them,

1628
01:50:09.670 --> 01:50:14.190
but there is a different style in which it's coming.
Uh,

1629
01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:18.250
you know,
let's talk about more,
more visuals,
visual and so on.

1630
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:19.960
More emphasis on,

1631
01:50:19.961 --> 01:50:24.961
on physical feelings or on the emotions in the certainly,

1632
01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:28.930
uh,
uh,
Mtma or some,

1633
01:50:28.931 --> 01:50:33.670
some of the other NTO they are shifted whole spectrum towards the positive.

1634
01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:36.880
There are very few people who have bad trips or Mgma.

1635
01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:41.080
Mgma is very dangerous physiologically,
but very,

1636
01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:45.790
very easy for most people to,
to handle psychologically,
emotionally.

1637
01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:51.800
Uh,
but then I discovered this,
uh,
these,

1638
01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:52.673
uh,

1639
01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:57.840
element in Iowa that there is very frequently the imagery of the Amazonian

1640
01:50:58.331 --> 01:51:02.880
jungle or the Anaconda snake is coming.
They kind of,
uh,

1641
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:07.990
a rotor rooter,
you know,
cleansing Jaguars,
images of Jaguar.

1642
01:51:07.991 --> 01:51:10.790
So there is some kind of a cell activity.

1643
01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:15.340
What from the collective unconscious is actually prevalent in,

1644
01:51:15.341 --> 01:51:17.290
in those sessions.

1645
01:51:18.490 --> 01:51:23.490
Do you have any opinion or opinion of or experience with microdosing of

1646
01:51:25.061 --> 01:51:26.020
different psychedelics?

1647
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.620
Is that something you've administered to people or,
uh,

1648
01:51:30.670 --> 01:51:35.070
I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.
It's become a topic to guy.
I had had quite,

1649
01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:37.680
quite a few,
like the 25 micrograms,
you know,
for,

1650
01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:42.280
for hiking or swimming in the ocean or something.
They just enhancement of the,

1651
01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:44.060
of the,
um,

1652
01:51:45.010 --> 01:51:48.290
perceptual experience of the world.
Uh,

1653
01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:53.290
but I haven't experimented with the,
with the smart,

1654
01:51:53.291 --> 01:51:57.180
I had lots of very interesting experiences,
uh,
uh,

1655
01:51:57.220 --> 01:51:58.510
inside of the sessions.

1656
01:51:58.570 --> 01:52:03.570
And then particularly coming down from the sessions when I was in a kind of a

1657
01:52:03.911 --> 01:52:04.960
state that would,

1658
01:52:05.170 --> 01:52:09.430
that you might be experiencing another lower dosages,

1659
01:52:10.060 --> 01:52:13.290
but it was at the end of a high dose session rather than,
uh,

1660
01:52:13.450 --> 01:52:15.100
an experience per se.

1661
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:19.180
What did you experience at the tail end of those sessions?

1662
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:24.380
What were they,
yeah,
what,
what were,

1663
01:52:24.450 --> 01:52:29.270
what were those experiences at the tail end of those high dose sessions that,
uh,

1664
01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:31.100
that were interesting?
Well,
you know,

1665
01:52:31.101 --> 01:52:34.820
all kinds of psychological insights and a lot of the things that I've been

1666
01:52:34.821 --> 01:52:36.340
writing about,
you know,

1667
01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:40.790
there are combinations of what I saw in the patients and then getting insights

1668
01:52:40.791 --> 01:52:44.300
and understanding,
uh,
uh,
even in the,

1669
01:52:44.301 --> 01:52:49.301
in the high dose s about pirates of the sessions when I hit some difficult

1670
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:51.470
places,
like for example,

1671
01:52:51.980 --> 01:52:56.720
existential despair feeling,
you know,
there's no meaning in life,

1672
01:52:56.750 --> 01:53:00.130
absurdity of life and so on,
which,
uh,

1673
01:53:00.380 --> 01:53:04.250
very frequently happens in,
uh,
during the reliving of births.

1674
01:53:04.251 --> 01:53:07.400
When you get to what I call the second a perinatal Matrix,

1675
01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:12.320
which is the stage of birth where the uterus contracts,
but there is no opening,

1676
01:53:12.321 --> 01:53:14.510
the cervix is not open.
So you have the feeling of,

1677
01:53:14.780 --> 01:53:19.130
of total existential despair.

1678
01:53:19.130 --> 01:53:22.130
Total bummer.
There's no,
I don't mean like everything's absurd.

1679
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:26.400
We go from nowhere to nowhere.
Uh,
uh,

1680
01:53:26.450 --> 01:53:31.220
we come to this world naked crying in pain,
uh,
you know,

1681
01:53:31.970 --> 01:53:35.480
without any possession and this is how we are going to end no matter what you do

1682
01:53:35.481 --> 01:53:40.370
in your life or with your life.
Those are really heavy kind of experiences.
Uh,

1683
01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:42.010
uh,
so,
uh,

1684
01:53:42.050 --> 01:53:47.050
I had some of those experiences when either there's a suicidal impulse or even

1685
01:53:48.201 --> 01:53:53.060
suicide,
even suicides would not be solution of trying to get out of that state.

1686
01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:58.250
And so when I was hitting some of these places in my own sessions,
uh,

1687
01:53:58.370 --> 01:54:02.330
I would have like a parade of my patients are,
I would suddenly say,
oh,

1688
01:54:02.331 --> 01:54:05.780
this is where it was,
or this is where she was when I was,

1689
01:54:05.781 --> 01:54:09.950
when I was bringing just my training as a psychiatrist and things that I've
read,

1690
01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:13.070
I realize I was sitting there listening to what they were saying.

1691
01:54:13.070 --> 01:54:16.840
I had no clue what they were talking about.
And,

1692
01:54:16.850 --> 01:54:21.850
but I got really full experiential understanding by finding those places in

1693
01:54:21.981 --> 01:54:25.450
myself.
And this is also interesting about this,

1694
01:54:25.490 --> 01:54:28.700
this large map of the psyche.
You know,

1695
01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:31.640
that each of us has all those things.

1696
01:54:31.641 --> 01:54:35.150
It's not a question of whether you are a psychiatric patient or not.

1697
01:54:35.151 --> 01:54:38.870
If you go deep enough,
you,
you find all those elements within yourself,

1698
01:54:39.810 --> 01:54:42.920
you are,
if you,
if you are dealing,

1699
01:54:42.921 --> 01:54:45.620
you're processing the hours in the birth canal,

1700
01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:49.700
you find the whole psychopathology there,
all the emotional problems,

1701
01:54:49.701 --> 01:54:53.660
all the psychosomatic symptoms,
the choking,
the,
the nausea,

1702
01:54:53.670 --> 01:54:57.950
the headaches,
the,
the paints,
psychosomatic pains in the body.

1703
01:54:58.550 --> 01:55:03.230
Uh,
you know,
people frequently telling me they found eight layer inside,

1704
01:55:03.231 --> 01:55:07.790
they found stolen.
I mean,
uh,
you,
you discover the shadow aspects.
So,

1705
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:09.141
so the,

1706
01:55:09.141 --> 01:55:13.340
the human personality is a little different from what described by mainstream

1707
01:55:13.490 --> 01:55:14.323
psychiatry.

1708
01:55:14.410 --> 01:55:16.310
<v 1>Would you,
you and your late wife,</v>

1709
01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:21.040
Christina coined the term spiritual emergency.
Uh,
and,

1710
01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:25.670
uh,
she found it I guess in 1980,
the spiritual emergence network Sen.

1711
01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:30.940
Now I'd love for you to explain what that means,
but then also,
uh,

1712
01:55:31.610 --> 01:55:36.440
if you could,
if you could touch on the difference between or differences,

1713
01:55:36.441 --> 01:55:41.441
if there are any between spiritual emergencies that are naturally occurring.

1714
01:55:42.410 --> 01:55:44.160
Let's just say,
or people

1715
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:47.400
<v 4>might view as say the onset of schizophrenia and the late twenties or something</v>

1716
01:55:47.401 --> 01:55:51.150
like that.
Yeah.
First versus those precipitated by psychedelics.

1717
01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:56.640
Whether it concept came from,
uh,
the work with psychedelics and was the,

1718
01:55:56.670 --> 01:56:01.060
with the breath work,
you know,
when you realize that,
uh,
uh,

1719
01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:06.240
people in these situations would have experiences like of a death,

1720
01:56:06.241 --> 01:56:11.130
three bursts,
destruction of the birth,
recreation,
recreation,
a of the world,

1721
01:56:11.160 --> 01:56:14.970
you know,
past life experiences and so on.
And,
uh,

1722
01:56:15.330 --> 01:56:19.170
I very early,
uh,
discovered that there was,
if you have bad trip,

1723
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:23.580
it is no way,
no good way of,
of terminating it.

1724
01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:26.550
The worst thing that you can do is what's done routinely,

1725
01:56:26.730 --> 01:56:31.350
which has come with tranquilizers when you give tranquilizers to people who are

1726
01:56:31.351 --> 01:56:35.430
in a,
on a bad trip and then keep them on maintenance.
Those is,

1727
01:56:35.431 --> 01:56:40.230
this prevents any kind of resolution.
If somebody has a bad trip,

1728
01:56:40.260 --> 01:56:41.040
uh,

1729
01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:44.370
that means that they are dealing with a difficult aspect of their unconscious.

1730
01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.110
And when it's coming up,
it's coming up for a healing for it's not,

1731
01:56:49.470 --> 01:56:54.270
it's not just the drug created this horrible,
horrible experience.
So,

1732
01:56:54.450 --> 01:56:57.770
so the way you do it,
you have to tell people,
you know,

1733
01:56:57.780 --> 01:57:02.070
the euro in Lsd session,
this is a time limited thing.

1734
01:57:02.071 --> 01:57:06.480
I'm going to be here.
And then when something remains unresolved,
we do some,
uh,

1735
01:57:06.610 --> 01:57:10.830
body work and some emotional work to bring it to a good closure.

1736
01:57:10.831 --> 01:57:13.740
People can benefit from this,
a bad trips.

1737
01:57:14.250 --> 01:57:17.490
So I realized very early that when people had difficult experiences,

1738
01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:22.640
the last thing I would do is to combine with tranquilizers.

1739
01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:23.753
You know,

1740
01:57:24.090 --> 01:57:28.800
and so I saw many of those situations where people experience what they would be

1741
01:57:28.801 --> 01:57:32.700
hospitalized for in the psychedelic session.
And we,
if we stayed with it,

1742
01:57:32.850 --> 01:57:36.600
it actually was a major healing major transformation.

1743
01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:39.450
So then the obvious answer was,
you know,

1744
01:57:40.530 --> 01:57:45.530
should we treat it differently just because it happened without breathing fast

1745
01:57:46.201 --> 01:57:50.730
breathing or because it happened without the psychedelics?
No,

1746
01:57:50.731 --> 01:57:53.910
we just,
uh,
you know,
applied to that,
uh,

1747
01:57:54.510 --> 01:57:59.490
other category of spontaneously emerging experiences of this kind.
Now,

1748
01:57:59.491 --> 01:58:03.300
what is necessary for having this kind of understanding,

1749
01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:08.480
you have to have the large map psyche is not just the postnatal biography and

1750
01:58:09.181 --> 01:58:13.920
the Freud and,
um,
individual unconscious.
There is the record of,

1751
01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:19.120
uh,
these hours of bursts of the,
of the anxiety of the,
of,

1752
01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:24.150
uh,
you know,
the,
uh,
physical discomfort.
And,
uh,

1753
01:58:24.450 --> 01:58:27.630
also the,
the amazing,
uh,
aggression,

1754
01:58:27.631 --> 01:58:32.280
the fury that is generated in the fetus who cannot breeze and is a,

1755
01:58:32.650 --> 01:58:36.450
is subjected to all those torsions and so on.

1756
01:58:37.490 --> 01:58:42.460
Uh,
so,
uh,
if you have a,
if you have a map that includes that,

1757
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:45.820
and if you have the map that includes the collective unconscious,

1758
01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:49.870
which psychiatry has not accepted the young gay and idea that we have also,

1759
01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:51.010
uh,

1760
01:58:51.010 --> 01:58:56.010
the collective unconscious as irregular kind of Germane part of our unconscious,

1761
01:58:56.351 --> 01:59:00.960
both the historical part of the collective unconscious and the archetypal,

1762
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:05.860
so having visions of archetype will beings are being taken to archetype of

1763
01:59:05.861 --> 01:59:10.630
domains like hell or paradise.
Those are common experiences,
uh,

1764
01:59:10.690 --> 01:59:14.110
in a,
in the breathwork or in psychedelic sessions.

1765
01:59:14.111 --> 01:59:17.320
So this just gives you an idea.

1766
01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:21.880
This is a stage that you can work with the way you would work with people in a,

1767
01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:23.470
in a psychedelic session.

1768
01:59:24.050 --> 01:59:27.420
<v 1>So,
so that's a perfect segue.
Let's take as a,</v>

1769
01:59:27.540 --> 01:59:32.540
as a hypothetical situation and an alternate world where the of psychologists

1770
01:59:36.751 --> 01:59:40.760
and psychiatrists have accepted the collective unconscious and,

1771
01:59:40.860 --> 01:59:42.600
and have this larger map.

1772
01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:48.350
Someone is brought to a hospital by their family because they seem to be having

1773
01:59:49.381 --> 01:59:51.450
what the family believes to be a psychotic break,

1774
01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:54.540
whether it's schizophrenia or a diet.

1775
01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:59.160
However it might be diagnosed currently they're brought to the hospital.

1776
01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:03.750
If a,
if a practitioner,
if a doctor or psychologist have this larger map,

1777
02:00:03.751 --> 02:00:08.670
what would the intervention or diagnostic process look like?
Potentially?

1778
02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:13.860
<v 4>Uh,
well,
people,
people usually ask me when,
when I say that the concept 32,</v>

1779
02:00:13.861 --> 02:00:18.270
two emergency,
uh,
if there are any professional psychiatry psychology,
they say,

1780
02:00:18.780 --> 02:00:22.700
can you give me differential diagnosis?
You see,
this is what we did.

1781
02:00:22.701 --> 02:00:27.540
And in somatic medicine,
differential diagnosis,
if people have a,
you know,

1782
02:00:27.550 --> 02:00:30.390
infection,
you want to find out which infection,

1783
02:00:30.391 --> 02:00:32.600
what is the differential diagnosis of,

1784
02:00:32.610 --> 02:00:36.480
what is the differential diagnosis between different kinds of diabetes and so
on.

1785
02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:39.990
So they would like something like that for spiritual emergency,

1786
02:00:40.350 --> 02:00:45.300
which you cannot do because,
uh,
the,
you know,
psychosis,
it's not,

1787
02:00:45.330 --> 02:00:49.140
this is not a medical diagnosis.
We,
we can't,

1788
02:00:49.500 --> 02:00:54.360
in the exception of the organic,
uh,
uh,
psychosis,
we cannot,

1789
02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:58.500
um,
uh,
really,
um,
make the diagnosis.

1790
02:00:58.501 --> 02:01:01.830
We don't have any findings in the cerebral spinal liquid.

1791
02:01:01.831 --> 02:01:03.450
We don't have any findings in the blood.

1792
02:01:03.451 --> 02:01:07.530
We don't have any finding in a urine where we can,
you know,

1793
02:01:07.650 --> 02:01:12.000
have a litmus paper,
put it in the sample of urine,
says it's comes out,
uh,

1794
02:01:12.510 --> 02:01:15.690
uh,
you know,
green.
It's a schizophrenia.

1795
02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:19.230
You basically the diagnose these different cycles,

1796
02:01:19.231 --> 02:01:24.231
so called psychotic states by the fact that people have experiences,

1797
02:01:24.750 --> 02:01:28.660
uh,
and behaviors that current model cannot.
But,

1798
02:01:28.770 --> 02:01:32.190
but part of those,
uh,
symptoms which are,

1799
02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:36.990
which are used as being important,
you know,
diagnostic,

1800
02:01:37.090 --> 02:01:41.270
uh,
two,
four,
four psychiatry could be,
for example,

1801
02:01:41.271 --> 02:01:42.680
people have the experience of,

1802
02:01:43.010 --> 02:01:46.790
of death three boroughs or destruction of the world,
recreation of the,

1803
02:01:47.150 --> 02:01:49.500
of the world.
They have experiences.
Uh,
uh,

1804
02:01:49.620 --> 02:01:52.190
that seemed to be a past life experiences.

1805
02:01:52.970 --> 02:01:56.840
So those are all absolutely normal,
uh,
um,

1806
02:01:57.560 --> 02:02:00.710
elements in the,
uh,
human unconscious.

1807
02:02:00.711 --> 02:02:03.890
But other understood really in a,

1808
02:02:03.891 --> 02:02:07.400
if you want in the graphy and Yogi and a way the,
the,

1809
02:02:07.490 --> 02:02:12.490
the psyche is infinitely larger than then a mainstream psychiatry ever

1810
02:02:14.780 --> 02:02:15.560
considered.

1811
02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:19.790
It's more like the description that you find in the great spiritual philosophies

1812
02:02:19.791 --> 02:02:23.660
of the East and induce them Buddhism,
Taoism,
and they have the,

1813
02:02:24.110 --> 02:02:28.910
they have the real maps of the psyche because they were focusing,
uh,
you know,

1814
02:02:28.911 --> 02:02:33.911
for centuries on systematic exploration of the psyche in a very similar way in

1815
02:02:35.541 --> 02:02:39.990
which we do science.
You know,
people,
they were describing certain,
uh,

1816
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:43.100
procedures that you have to follow certain forms of meditation.

1817
02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:47.900
They would collect the,
uh,
descriptions of those experiences,
uh,

1818
02:02:48.410 --> 02:02:50.540
discuss or write about it and so on.

1819
02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:55.370
So it's a systematic exploration of the human psyche,
this,
uh,

1820
02:02:55.930 --> 02:02:58.500
uh,
cultures.
We're not interested in technology,

1821
02:02:58.501 --> 02:03:03.200
so they are nowhere close to what we are in terms of the understanding of the

1822
02:03:03.201 --> 02:03:04.034
material world,

1823
02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:08.660
but a way ahead of us in terms of understanding of consciousness and the,

1824
02:03:09.170 --> 02:03:12.160
and the psyche.
And it's very,
you know,

1825
02:03:12.170 --> 02:03:16.600
it's very humbling for somebody like myself having a,
you know,

1826
02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:20.900
professional training and being through a stage when I thought,

1827
02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:24.560
what the Shamans are doing,
this other primitives in the jungle somewhere,

1828
02:03:24.561 --> 02:03:28.490
you know,
illiterate and so on.
We have our scientific approach,

1829
02:03:28.491 --> 02:03:33.050
which is behavior is immoral or psychoanalysis.
Now this,
if you,

1830
02:03:33.051 --> 02:03:36.950
if you have the experience of these tools that the Shamans have available,

1831
02:03:36.951 --> 02:03:39.490
you develop a lot of respect to that and

1832
02:03:41.090 --> 02:03:45.170
related to that.
But the question is,
is it has to be harnessed.
You know,

1833
02:03:45.171 --> 02:03:49.850
and that's not an easy,
easy task in the,
um,

1834
02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:53.870
industry civilization.
You would have to change first.

1835
02:03:53.871 --> 02:03:58.010
He would have to change the,
the paradigm,
which is a difficult thing.

1836
02:03:58.930 --> 02:04:00.110
You probably know that the,

1837
02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:05.500
the shift from the geocentric system to the heliocentric system after Copernicus

1838
02:04:07.081 --> 02:04:11.960
is,
uh,
you know,
published this about the revolutions of the planets.

1839
02:04:12.290 --> 02:04:16.550
It took over a hundred years.
And the,
the,
the,
uh,

1840
02:04:17.540 --> 02:04:20.180
uh,
resistance,
it was not just the church.
This was,

1841
02:04:20.181 --> 02:04:21.950
the resistance was coming also from,

1842
02:04:22.340 --> 02:04:26.270
from the universities where there are all kinds of arguments.
Why the,
you know,

1843
02:04:26.271 --> 02:04:29.750
why the earth cannot be,
uh,
uh,

1844
02:04:29.810 --> 02:04:33.560
around and rotate and,
uh,
and uh,
you know,

1845
02:04:33.590 --> 02:04:38.580
they're around the sun and so on.
For you personally?

1846
02:04:39.390 --> 02:04:44.390
<v 1>How has your experience of your inner world changed over the last,</v>

1847
02:04:44.401 --> 02:04:48.420
say,
60 years or after you had your first psychedelic experience?

1848
02:04:48.510 --> 02:04:52.650
So you have that experience and you go on to have all of these experiences.

1849
02:04:52.651 --> 02:04:56.760
What is your inner,
your experience of your inner world look like?
How's that?

1850
02:04:57.400 --> 02:05:00.010
<v 4>You know,
I was an atheist,
uh,
um,</v>

1851
02:05:00.330 --> 02:05:04.920
this goes back to a little scandal in our family.
Uh,

1852
02:05:05.110 --> 02:05:09.910
when my parents got a gut,
fell in love and wanted to get married,

1853
02:05:09.911 --> 02:05:14.710
it was in a small check down and my father's feminity was,

1854
02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:19.110
had no a religious affiliation and my mother's feminine will stick to the

1855
02:05:19.111 --> 02:05:19.944
Catholic.

1856
02:05:20.140 --> 02:05:25.140
And so the church refused to marry them because my father was taken by the

1857
02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:30.370
definition and this was great.
A lot of turmoil.
It's almost,

1858
02:05:30.371 --> 02:05:34.870
seems like it would not happen until the solution came.
Uh,
my,

1859
02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:37.270
um,
mother's,
uh,

1860
02:05:37.420 --> 02:05:42.420
parents made a batch of donation to the church and then suddenly they relax

1861
02:05:42.941 --> 02:05:46.740
their standards and they allowed that.
And,
uh,

1862
02:05:46.810 --> 02:05:51.370
they had a business on main street and uh,
so when,

1863
02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:56.050
when the wedding happened,
they could roll out carpets across the street,

1864
02:05:56.080 --> 02:05:59.770
stopped the traffic,
and to take the carpets to the,

1865
02:06:00.070 --> 02:06:04.120
to the altar so the guests could go from the altar all the way to the house in

1866
02:06:04.121 --> 02:06:05.560
Everett banquet there.

1867
02:06:06.370 --> 02:06:10.930
And my parents got so upset by this that they decided not to commit me or my

1868
02:06:10.931 --> 02:06:15.610
brother to any religion.
It,
we should make our own decisions when we come of age.

1869
02:06:16.120 --> 02:06:20.710
So we actually had classes of religion,
but for me it was always a three hour.

1870
02:06:20.711 --> 02:06:24.370
Why would go for a walk or read their book or if they were sort of playing

1871
02:06:24.371 --> 02:06:29.170
soccer summer,
I would join them.
You know,
being glad that I had this extra time.

1872
02:06:29.171 --> 02:06:33.580
But also I was very curious creature.
I was,
I was also missing,

1873
02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:35.150
this was called,
uh,

1874
02:06:35.260 --> 02:06:40.240
I think very DZ and morale or something like this where the classes and David,

1875
02:06:40.570 --> 02:06:42.760
they were being taught something that I was missing.

1876
02:06:42.761 --> 02:06:44.740
So I was kind of a little ambivalent about it.

1877
02:06:45.790 --> 02:06:47.530
But then from this kind of background,

1878
02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:51.340
I went to medical school at the time when they hit the Marxist regime,

1879
02:06:51.341 --> 02:06:53.140
we were controlled by the Soviet Union.

1880
02:06:53.560 --> 02:06:58.180
So we really got the pure materialistic doctrine.
You can't,
you can't get,
uh,

1881
02:06:58.750 --> 02:07:02.320
you know,
more materialistic than that.
So,
uh,

1882
02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:06.580
it was my first LSD session.
They just changed that.
And,
uh,

1883
02:07:07.510 --> 02:07:07.841
you know,

1884
02:07:07.841 --> 02:07:12.100
I was one kind of person in the morning and another person walked out of there,

1885
02:07:12.160 --> 02:07:13.510
uh,
in the evening,

1886
02:07:14.710 --> 02:07:18.940
I was really basically open to the,
to the mystical world.

1887
02:07:19.060 --> 02:07:23.050
I saw that,
you know,
that was a much deeper understanding that,

1888
02:07:23.110 --> 02:07:27.820
that anything that,
uh,
that my,
uh,
formal training provided.

1889
02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:31.270
So,
uh,
so this the paradox,

1890
02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:34.980
which I was aware of it when I was coming down as a,
as a believe,

1891
02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:38.710
sort of not believing,
but the mystical mystical person,

1892
02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:40.390
I differentiate quite a bit.

1893
02:07:40.391 --> 02:07:44.470
Spirituality from religion never became a religious in any way.

1894
02:07:44.471 --> 02:07:49.420
I became very spiritual.
And,
uh,
I realized the paradox,

1895
02:07:49.421 --> 02:07:50.470
you know,
it's,
uh,
the,

1896
02:07:51.250 --> 02:07:55.660
the divine sort of comes to me in an experiment in a,

1897
02:07:55.661 --> 02:07:58.360
in a Marxist,
a country,
you know,

1898
02:07:58.450 --> 02:08:03.320
induced by this substance from a Swiss chemist.
Uh,

1899
02:08:03.700 --> 02:08:08.470
but I knew,
I felt I was stuck in psychiatry and I was at that point,

1900
02:08:08.860 --> 02:08:12.590
not very excited about psychiatry.
Uh,
but I,

1901
02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:16.060
I felt coming down from the session,
I felt the fire.
I'm psychiatry.

1902
02:08:16.270 --> 02:08:19.540
This is by far the most interesting thing I can study.

1903
02:08:20.020 --> 02:08:23.350
So if you look at my professional career,
there is nothing.

1904
02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:29.200
There was a year,
60 years,
you know,
that,
uh,

1905
02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:33.760
I have done that would not be in one way or another related to these holotropic

1906
02:08:33.761 --> 02:08:38.350
states.
That became what I said was by my passion,

1907
02:08:38.351 --> 02:08:40.840
my vocation,
my,
my profession.

1908
02:08:42.490 --> 02:08:47.490
<v 1>Is there any particular synchronicity or experience in any of the holotropic</v>

1909
02:08:48.921 --> 02:08:52.850
states that you've experienced yourself that,

1910
02:08:52.910 --> 02:08:56.870
that you find the hardest to explain or the most,

1911
02:08:58.110 --> 02:09:03.020
uh,
uh,
unusual.
Slash remarkable?
Does it,
does it,
does anything come to mind?

1912
02:09:03.430 --> 02:09:07.330
<v 4>Uh,
I don't know.
You,
I have so many,
so many of them.
Uh,
I think when have</v>

1913
02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:10.490
<v 1>pick one.
Yeah,
you could do,
you can choose more than one too.</v>

1914
02:09:11.090 --> 02:09:16.090
<v 4>One of the wildest one was actually the first question that I had in when I came</v>

1915
02:09:17.091 --> 02:09:18.410
to Baltimore from Prague.

1916
02:09:20.210 --> 02:09:22.280
It was a process where my,

1917
02:09:22.281 --> 02:09:26.990
a request to for the scholarship was first turned down.
And then,

1918
02:09:27.020 --> 02:09:31.460
uh,
then,
uh,
I appealed.

1919
02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:32.810
And then,
uh,

1920
02:09:32.811 --> 02:09:36.890
I had a very powerful psychedelic session with a colleague of mine,

1921
02:09:36.891 --> 02:09:40.400
a psychiatrist,
and uh,
this was a major,

1922
02:09:40.401 --> 02:09:44.210
major death rebirth opening can what I experienced.
It's like,
you know,

1923
02:09:44.211 --> 02:09:48.260
kind of Atman Brahman,
uh,
experience.
And uh,

1924
02:09:48.410 --> 02:09:51.530
I came back home and,
uh,

1925
02:09:51.770 --> 02:09:56.600
in the mailbox was the positive response I can,
I can go to the United States.

1926
02:09:57.110 --> 02:10:00.590
So it,
within very short time I packed,
I ended up,
you know,

1927
02:10:00.591 --> 02:10:04.520
it's 40 pounds of my luggage.
I took all my records with me,
25,

1928
02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:07.610
25 pounds,
15 pounds of personal belonging.

1929
02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:10.160
And I was going to Baltimore.

1930
02:10:10.850 --> 02:10:15.850
And in Baltimore we had the permission to give sessions to professionals and

1931
02:10:16.761 --> 02:10:20.030
collecting the information from that.
And so I had a session,

1932
02:10:20.290 --> 02:10:23.570
we qualified for that ourselves.

1933
02:10:24.620 --> 02:10:29.600
And in that session I suddenly had the feeling,
uh,
that,
uh,

1934
02:10:29.660 --> 02:10:34.660
I was not bound by space and time that I somehow could get to other places in

1935
02:10:34.881 --> 02:10:39.710
the world if I decide to,
uh,
and I wanted to put it to a test.

1936
02:10:39.711 --> 02:10:44.570
I said,
can I,
for example,
get to Prague
into,

1937
02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:48.740
into the,
uh,
uh,
apartment of my parents?

1938
02:10:49.430 --> 02:10:51.620
And so I imagine,
you know,
which direction it was,

1939
02:10:51.621 --> 02:10:56.621
pride and how far an imagined myself sort of flying in that direction.

1940
02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:00.560
And I was experience of flight,
but I was not getting anywhere.

1941
02:11:00.561 --> 02:11:05.140
So I felt there was a problem there and I was thinking about it.

1942
02:11:05.141 --> 02:11:10.120
And then I realized that I was
limited by this,

1943
02:11:10.121 --> 02:11:11.200
by the constant,
this,

1944
02:11:11.210 --> 02:11:15.890
the court in its spatial temporal coding is I believe that practice in this

1945
02:11:15.891 --> 02:11:18.080
direction,
uh,
you know,

1946
02:11:18.081 --> 02:11:22.640
and a certain kind of distance that I have to overcome.

1947
02:11:22.730 --> 02:11:26.180
And just imagine that I am,
I'm in Prague.

1948
02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:30.740
And what happened the next time I was suddenly trapped in some kind of very

1949
02:11:30.741 --> 02:11:33.530
strange space where they were like,
uh,
uh,

1950
02:11:33.531 --> 02:11:38.000
circuits on transistors and stuff.
Uh,

1951
02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:39.500
and I didn't know what was happening.

1952
02:11:39.530 --> 02:11:44.510
And then I realized I was inside of the television of,
uh,
the,

1953
02:11:44.511 --> 02:11:49.250
uh,
the television set of my,
of my parents.

1954
02:11:50.330 --> 02:11:55.330
And I was thinking about it and I had to laugh because I was still holding on to

1955
02:11:56.420 --> 02:11:58.520
the next element of the materialistic world.

1956
02:11:58.550 --> 02:12:02.620
The only way you can really see what's happening in other places.
You,

1957
02:12:02.621 --> 02:12:07.340
you need a television unit,
you need a camera and a satellite,
you see.

1958
02:12:07.341 --> 02:12:12.200
So I realized I am not even bound by that.
I'm,
I'm in,
uh,
in,
uh,

1959
02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:16.100
uh,
the,
the world of spirit.
I can just has to say,

1960
02:12:16.101 --> 02:12:19.180
now I am there and I'm there.
And then in the,

1961
02:12:19.700 --> 02:12:24.140
at that point it turned kind of inside out.
And I was walking,
I felt straight.

1962
02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:25.970
I didn't feel,
it didn't feel,

1963
02:12:25.971 --> 02:12:30.110
I was in a session and I was walking in the department.

1964
02:12:30.111 --> 02:12:34.940
I heard my parents breathing and I went to the,

1965
02:12:35.060 --> 02:12:37.820
to,
uh,
the window.
And,
uh,
there,

1966
02:12:37.910 --> 02:12:42.910
there on the corner was a clock and it was showing this the six hour difference,

1967
02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:50.000
uh,
which,
uh,
I thought for awhile and I said,
not,

1968
02:12:50.001 --> 02:12:53.100
not approve,
you know,
um,
uh,
I,

1969
02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:56.390
I knew it that there was a difference that my mind could fabricate that.

1970
02:12:56.840 --> 02:12:58.910
So how do I prove that this really happened?

1971
02:12:59.450 --> 02:13:04.450
And I said I would go and take a picture of the wall and then check what my

1972
02:13:04.761 --> 02:13:07.000
parents said.
There was something strange happened to,
you know,

1973
02:13:07.001 --> 02:13:11.790
if we found this painting on the,
uh,
you know,
on the floor and,
uh,

1974
02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:14.300
this nail was still in the wall.

1975
02:13:15.500 --> 02:13:18.530
And so I started walking to the,
and reaching for that.

1976
02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:22.920
And then suddenly I had the feeling that I was gambling.
I was,
I was playing,
uh,

1977
02:13:24.020 --> 02:13:27.830
like a ruler with my,
with my soul.
That was,

1978
02:13:27.831 --> 02:13:31.010
this was very dangerous.
Every,
the feeling that,
uh,

1979
02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:35.010
I was getting sort of under the influence of some evil forces.

1980
02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:40.530
And then I realized how much they warn you if you are under spiritual quest,
uh,

1981
02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:44.590
from that,
uh,
that period where you start playing with these mind over,
you know,

1982
02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:48.570
the cds and so on.
And a,

1983
02:13:48.571 --> 02:13:53.490
I started seeing,
I started thinking images,
what I could do,

1984
02:13:53.491 --> 02:13:58.491
if I really have the possibility I could go and eavesdrop and political meetings

1985
02:14:00.571 --> 02:14:05.400
in the world,
you know,
uh,
I could get access to scientific secrets and so on.

1986
02:14:05.580 --> 02:14:10.040
I could go to a casino,
I could beat the casino and so on.
And,
uh,

1987
02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:13.830
I realized there was a,
there was a real danger from the ego to,

1988
02:14:13.890 --> 02:14:18.570
to start playing with the possibility of having this power.

1989
02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:23.070
So I finally sort of didn't have the courage to do that.

1990
02:14:23.130 --> 02:14:28.050
And also didn't want to be in a world where this would be possible because if I

1991
02:14:28.051 --> 02:14:31.170
had the power than other people had the power and then the,

1992
02:14:31.250 --> 02:14:34.880
the doors don't protect me.
I mean a world sort of,
uh,
you know,

1993
02:14:34.890 --> 02:14:37.530
this kind of wild western and I didn't,

1994
02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:41.820
didn't want that proof that this is this what's really possible.

1995
02:14:42.450 --> 02:14:46.700
And I went,
I lied down on a couch.
Uh,

1996
02:14:46.740 --> 02:14:48.560
we're actually,
uh,
uh,

1997
02:14:48.590 --> 02:14:53.430
I was coming down from a session before going to,
to Baltimore,

1998
02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:59.000
and I was lying then.
And then this horrible thought came to me.
Uh,

1999
02:14:59.250 --> 02:15:04.250
maybe I never got to ball team or I am just like fabricated that trip to,

2000
02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:09.630
to the United States in my LSD session.
I'm now coming down,
uh,
from,

2001
02:15:09.631 --> 02:15:14.040
from the session.
I never left,
you see,
so I was like the trunk.

2002
02:15:14.041 --> 02:15:15.660
So in that situation,
you know,

2003
02:15:15.661 --> 02:15:19.710
am I a butterfly having the dream of being a human or a human,
having the,

2004
02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:25.170
um,
the feeling that I'm butterfly.
Uh,
so,
uh,

2005
02:15:25.590 --> 02:15:29.790
I was stuck in that place for a while where I was not sure whether I was having

2006
02:15:29.791 --> 02:15:32.940
astral projection from Baltimore or whether I was a,

2007
02:15:32.941 --> 02:15:36.840
I was coming down from the session.
So that was the wildest one probably.

2008
02:15:36.841 --> 02:15:40.010
And of course then coming back I was cursing myself.
You know,

2009
02:15:40.011 --> 02:15:44.610
what a wasted opportunity for a great experiments,
you know,

2010
02:15:44.611 --> 02:15:47.460
the proof,
uh,
Esther protection,
uh,
and uh,

2011
02:15:48.150 --> 02:15:51.990
but the fear and the metaphysical fear that I was really sort of,

2012
02:15:53.030 --> 02:15:55.720
uh,
you know,
losing my soul in that too.

2013
02:15:55.740 --> 02:15:57.930
So I started playing with these kinds of forces

2014
02:15:58.810 --> 02:16:02.680
<v 1>that,
that last part of that experience in particular sounds terrible though.</v>

2015
02:16:02.970 --> 02:16:05.890
The laying down or terrifying I should say,
laying down on the,

2016
02:16:05.950 --> 02:16:09.430
on the couch in Prague and wondering,
like you said,

2017
02:16:09.910 --> 02:16:13.780
if the entire trip to the United States had been a fabrication when you came out

2018
02:16:13.781 --> 02:16:14.860
of that experience,

2019
02:16:15.370 --> 02:16:20.370
how quickly did it take or how long did it take for you to realize that in fact

2020
02:16:20.411 --> 02:16:23.200
you are back in the United States

2021
02:16:26.540 --> 02:16:30.400
<v 4>eight hours?
So I was absolutely clear,
you know,</v>

2022
02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:35.340
<v 1>read back to California.
Yeah,
yeah.
If,
if you were starting your career,
just,</v>

2023
02:16:35.341 --> 02:16:38.610
just a few more questions.
You've been so generous with your time,

2024
02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:42.180
but if you were starting again right now and,
uh,

2025
02:16:42.181 --> 02:16:44.490
you are a promising young scientist,

2026
02:16:44.520 --> 02:16:47.190
you could research anything you wanted.

2027
02:16:47.191 --> 02:16:50.880
Let's assume that all of these compounds are legal.
Uh,

2028
02:16:51.330 --> 02:16:55.020
what would you focus on?
What type of studies would you want to do,

2029
02:16:55.021 --> 02:16:56.910
or what type of research would you want to do?

2030
02:16:59.170 --> 02:17:01.770
<v 4>Well,
you know,
one of the problems with this,
uh,</v>

2031
02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:06.820
renaissance that a lot of this is repeating things which were already done.

2032
02:17:07.540 --> 02:17:10.220
Like the cancer projects are great,
but,
but,
uh,

2033
02:17:10.420 --> 02:17:15.420
we did it to the point when that when we ask for more money for continuing the

2034
02:17:15.701 --> 02:17:20.000
research,
they say,
you have already proved it.
Now it has to go to the hospitals.

2035
02:17:20.001 --> 02:17:24.930
So it has to be used.
And,
uh,
so,
uh,
you know,

2036
02:17:24.940 --> 02:17:26.020
those also,

2037
02:17:26.021 --> 02:17:30.790
this wonderful study at Johns Hopkins is just a more sophisticated and

2038
02:17:31.150 --> 02:17:35.540
methodologically better,
uh,
you know,
Walter Pankey experiment,

2039
02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:37.250
which had some flaws that,

2040
02:17:38.490 --> 02:17:43.490
but I would love to see this now going to the research of creativity to bring

2041
02:17:43.601 --> 02:17:45.310
people,
um,
you know,

2042
02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:49.750
biology's quantum relativistic physicists and see what they can do.

2043
02:17:50.540 --> 02:17:51.311
As,
you know,

2044
02:17:51.311 --> 02:17:55.480
we have indications that the whole development of computers was closely

2045
02:17:56.650 --> 02:18:00.610
connected with the use of psychedelics.
You know,

2046
02:18:00.611 --> 02:18:05.020
people like Duck Engelbart and uh,
and uh,
even,
you know,

2047
02:18:05.021 --> 02:18:09.610
Steve Jobs and all these people made it absolutely clear.
Uh,

2048
02:18:09.790 --> 02:18:14.350
there was a statement that uh,
uh,
all the people to one,

2049
02:18:14.380 --> 02:18:19.000
two men and a woman who developed virtual reality where acid hats.

2050
02:18:20.050 --> 02:18:23.500
So,
and this is now,
you know,
understood.
There is a,

2051
02:18:23.501 --> 02:18:27.070
there is a possibility of sort of loosening somehow the,

2052
02:18:27.700 --> 02:18:32.620
the blocks that we have in problem solving because we are stuck with a paradigm.

2053
02:18:33.290 --> 02:18:35.920
Know Thomas Kuhn wrote that fantastic book,

2054
02:18:35.921 --> 02:18:40.921
the structure of scientific revolutions showing that the history of science is

2055
02:18:42.371 --> 02:18:46.450
not a linear development where we started from not knowing anything and then

2056
02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:51.430
each generation edit a little of the observations and they were,
you know,

2057
02:18:51.431 --> 02:18:55.660
more and more accurate a hypotheses and theories created.

2058
02:18:55.930 --> 02:18:59.110
So that what we have now,
the understanding of the universe is the,

2059
02:18:59.170 --> 02:19:03.040
is the best understanding that has ever been in,
you know,
in any,

2060
02:19:03.041 --> 02:19:06.790
at any time in any society.
And it showed that it's a,

2061
02:19:06.791 --> 02:19:11.791
it's a joke that the development of science breaks into these distinct periods

2062
02:19:12.671 --> 02:19:17.250
and each of them is governed.
But what he calls a paradigm,
you know,
a way of,
uh,

2063
02:19:17.530 --> 02:19:19.750
uh,
looking,
uh,
looking at the world,
you know,

2064
02:19:19.751 --> 02:19:24.470
certain basic metaphysical assumptions,
uh,
uh,
beliefs,
uh,

2065
02:19:24.490 --> 02:19:28.550
ways of,
uh,
what are relevant,
uh,
uh,
areas to research.

2066
02:19:28.730 --> 02:19:33.700
How do you do research?
How you evaluated this is all paradigm,
uh,

2067
02:19:33.740 --> 02:19:38.240
the tide.
So the examples of course,
I already mentioned the,

2068
02:19:38.241 --> 02:19:43.241
the shift from a geocentric to the heliocentric system.

2069
02:19:43.850 --> 02:19:44.810
There was a one,

2070
02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:49.920
a revolution in chemistry where they had focused on chemistry where there was

2071
02:19:51.591 --> 02:19:56.570
this,
the royal substance of focused on.
And then when people like,

2072
02:19:56.600 --> 02:20:01.250
uh,
uh,
like a delta or Lavoie Zia came with the idea of atoms,

2073
02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:06.070
you know,
uh,
uh,
people at problems because they didn't believe in,
uh,

2074
02:20:06.350 --> 02:20:10.400
in flogging stone anymore.
Now we laugh when they hear that.
And then of course,

2075
02:20:10.401 --> 02:20:13.460
the,
the first three decades in the 20th century,

2076
02:20:13.461 --> 02:20:16.670
the physicist had to go through this incredible,
uh,

2077
02:20:16.760 --> 02:20:21.760
conceptual cataclysm moving from Newton first to the theories of relativity and

2078
02:20:23.241 --> 02:20:25.760
then to quantum physics that even Einstein,

2079
02:20:25.761 --> 02:20:30.050
who initiated or couldn't accept that until his death.

2080
02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:33.170
So this is,
this is the question of paradigm.

2081
02:20:33.171 --> 02:20:38.171
So I believe that we are now in the period of paradigm shift,

2082
02:20:38.660 --> 02:20:39.470
uh,

2083
02:20:39.470 --> 02:20:44.090
in relation to consciousness and the human psyche that's comparable in the

2084
02:20:44.091 --> 02:20:48.560
nature and scope to what the physicists had to,
uh,

2085
02:20:48.561 --> 02:20:51.860
experience in the first three decades of the 20th century.

2086
02:20:52.640 --> 02:20:53.660
And then in a sense,

2087
02:20:53.661 --> 02:20:58.460
it can be soon as being complimentary to the changes that already happened in

2088
02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:03.400
the understanding of matter.
You know,
the quantum physicists,
uh,

2089
02:21:04.060 --> 02:21:06.800
uh,
who are my friends said no,

2090
02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:10.610
no problems relating to my observation.

2091
02:21:10.611 --> 02:21:14.960
It was mostly the resistance of psychiatrists and psychologists.

2092
02:21:17.440 --> 02:21:21.430
So one more thing,
one more thing.
Uh,
uh,

2093
02:21:22.360 --> 02:21:24.890
uh,
so there is the,
uh,

2094
02:21:24.920 --> 02:21:29.120
the situation that couldn't describe it during the time when you have the

2095
02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:34.370
science dominated by a paradigm,
the scientists do what he called,

2096
02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:37.580
uh,
um,
normal science,

2097
02:21:37.581 --> 02:21:41.510
which is problem solving within the context of a given parameters.

2098
02:21:41.540 --> 02:21:45.770
It's like playing chess.
If you play chess,
you have to follow the rules.

2099
02:21:45.771 --> 02:21:50.620
You can't suddenly take an inconvenient figure and throw it out of the,
uh,

2100
02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:53.870
out of the chess board,
you know?
Uh,

2101
02:21:54.410 --> 02:21:56.710
and then he describes what happens then when,

2102
02:21:56.780 --> 02:22:01.640
when observations come the challenge,
the paradigm,
how is,
uh,

2103
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:02.450
rejected.

2104
02:22:02.450 --> 02:22:06.770
Initially people are called crazy or it's called fraud or whatever.

2105
02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:11.960
And then when it comes,
keeps coming,
then finally realization there is a problem.

2106
02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:16.370
And then the wilder theorists come and the first they are sort of rejected.

2107
02:22:16.371 --> 02:22:21.371
And after awhile the new paradigm emerges and is accepted by the scientific

2108
02:22:22.071 --> 02:22:26.940
community.
And then history is rewritten because now you have new heroes,

2109
02:22:26.941 --> 02:22:29.910
people who already saw it,
you know,
centuries ago.

2110
02:22:29.911 --> 02:22:34.760
The way we see it now about,
uh,
what I would like to add was then,
uh,

2111
02:22:34.800 --> 02:22:37.710
Gregory Bateson edit.
And other thing is this the,

2112
02:22:38.520 --> 02:22:42.490
not only do the scientists believe in,

2113
02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:45.300
in that paradigm are committed to it,

2114
02:22:45.750 --> 02:22:50.220
but they believe that it's an accurate and exhaustive description of reality,

2115
02:22:50.221 --> 02:22:51.690
per se.
Not a map,

2116
02:22:52.260 --> 02:22:56.700
not the best way we can sort of currently organize the observation that we have.

2117
02:22:56.850 --> 02:23:00.870
It is a definitive description of how things are.

2118
02:23:01.950 --> 02:23:02.960
And,
uh,
this is,
uh,

2119
02:23:03.090 --> 02:23:06.060
this is called the confusion between the map and the territory.

2120
02:23:06.660 --> 02:23:10.770
People like Arthur core,
zip ski.
And then Gregory Bateson was very,

2121
02:23:10.771 --> 02:23:15.210
very big about it and,
uh,
Gregory was laughing about it.
He says,

2122
02:23:15.211 --> 02:23:18.030
if scientists make a arrows like that,

2123
02:23:18.031 --> 02:23:22.470
it can happen that one day they come to the restaurant and they eat the menu

2124
02:23:22.471 --> 02:23:27.020
instead of the thinner,
the relationship between the paradigm,
you know.
And uh,

2125
02:23:27.030 --> 02:23:32.030
the territory that it described is that is a very much like a reading the

2126
02:23:32.131 --> 02:23:32.964
manual.

2127
02:23:34.060 --> 02:23:38.900
<v 1>So I had this question I wanted to ask this entire conversation since we first</v>

2128
02:23:38.901 --> 02:23:42.790
started speaking and uh,
let me,

2129
02:23:42.890 --> 02:23:46.970
let me just get my facts straight before I ask it.
Are you currently 87?

2130
02:23:46.971 --> 02:23:49.040
Is that accurate?
What is your current age?

2131
02:23:49.570 --> 02:23:54.240
<v 4>Uh,
I just wanted to,
1st of July I was just,
was,
uh,
was uh,</v>

2132
02:23:54.300 --> 02:23:55.010
87,

2133
02:23:55.010 --> 02:23:59.270
<v 1>87.
Well,
happy belated birthday and thank you.
Go.
Thank you very much.</v>

2134
02:23:59.330 --> 02:24:03.710
You are remarkably,
uh,
I'd be incredibly sharp,

2135
02:24:03.711 --> 02:24:07.490
incredibly energetic.
I mean more so than some 20 somethings.
I know.

2136
02:24:08.300 --> 02:24:11.630
What do you attribute that to?
I mean our r and d two,
what factors,
I mean,

2137
02:24:11.631 --> 02:24:15.780
are you,
are both,
we're both of your parents sharp their entire lives.
I mean,
I,

2138
02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:18.370
I aspire currently I'm 40,

2139
02:24:18.620 --> 02:24:21.740
I'm 41 and I would love to have half the energy that you do.

2140
02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:27.170
So what to what do you attribute that it's,
it's really,
uh,

2141
02:24:27.230 --> 02:24:29.930
just,
I mean mind blowing to me.
Uh,

2142
02:24:29.940 --> 02:24:32.240
I'm so inspired,

2143
02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:37.280
I just trying to absorb some of the enthusiasm and energy that you have in his

2144
02:24:40.190 --> 02:24:41.330
phone in this phone call.

2145
02:24:42.250 --> 02:24:45.910
<v 4>I think,
you know,
part of it is that I'm really,
really very,</v>

2146
02:24:45.911 --> 02:24:50.830
very deeply committed to this,
uh,
to this,
uh,
idea of,

2147
02:24:50.850 --> 02:24:55.300
uh,
these holotropic states to,
to bring them into psychiatry,

2148
02:24:55.301 --> 02:24:59.850
to bring them into society.
I had a lot of,
uh,
you know,

2149
02:24:59.860 --> 02:25:02.830
meetings with,
uh,
Albert Hoffman who,

2150
02:25:03.310 --> 02:25:08.310
who was talking about the new LLCs to create a situation where these are

2151
02:25:08.770 --> 02:25:12.580
integrated into social fabric.
They are socially sanctioned.

2152
02:25:12.700 --> 02:25:15.880
That we can sort of use it the way ancient Greeks.

2153
02:25:16.150 --> 02:25:20.710
The Loc is a Mr is,
uh,
you know,
uh,

2154
02:25:20.770 --> 02:25:24.630
you probably know this was done for two years in the lenses.

2155
02:25:25.540 --> 02:25:28.510
So they had to offer something pretty impressive too,

2156
02:25:28.570 --> 02:25:33.120
to keep the attention of the ancient world.
And,
uh,
the,

2157
02:25:33.130 --> 02:25:37.300
uh,
a list of people who have been initiates in these mysteries.

2158
02:25:37.630 --> 02:25:40.270
It reads like,
who is who in antiquity.
I mean,

2159
02:25:40.271 --> 02:25:44.570
it includes Plato,
Aristotle,
Cicero wrote about it,
you know,

2160
02:25:44.890 --> 02:25:49.330
mark was already,
it's been Darras and,
uh,
all these people.

2161
02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:54.610
So we all sort of say,
you know,
the Greeks are very talented,

2162
02:25:54.611 --> 02:25:59.590
beautiful art,
beautiful science,
and a great ideas.
No,
the fact that,

2163
02:25:59.591 --> 02:26:03.390
uh,
you know,
so many people every five years at,
uh,

2164
02:26:03.880 --> 02:26:07.330
some powerful experiences,
uh,

2165
02:26:07.390 --> 02:26:10.210
puts it into somewhat different perspective.

2166
02:26:10.900 --> 02:26:15.210
And a Albert Hofmann and Gordon was the one who brought the,

2167
02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:20.140
the mushrooms from Mexico,
from the muscle,
take Indians and Carl Rock,

2168
02:26:20.260 --> 02:26:23.760
a Greek scholar.
They wrote the book road to LMC.

2169
02:26:23.761 --> 02:26:28.690
So when they found out that the key to these mysteries was Kiki on k,
y,
k,
e,
O,

2170
02:26:28.691 --> 02:26:33.150
n,
and they found out that this was a,
um,

2171
02:26:33.250 --> 02:26:37.260
psychedelic portion,
which was made of,
uh,
of Erica,

2172
02:26:37.300 --> 02:26:41.850
very similar to LSD.
So it's again,
imagined,
uh,

2173
02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:43.270
it's so many people,

2174
02:26:43.271 --> 02:26:47.710
every five years in that smaller world had psychedelic experiences that it could

2175
02:26:47.711 --> 02:26:52.300
have had some impact on the,
uh,
on the culture.

2176
02:26:53.530 --> 02:26:57.160
You know,
the last time when we were in,
uh,
in [inaudible],
uh,
there was,
uh,

2177
02:26:57.220 --> 02:27:01.390
a guide and there are the,
the ruins of,
uh,

2178
02:27:02.110 --> 02:27:05.890
of the telestream on which is the building where this was happening and it's a

2179
02:27:05.891 --> 02:27:08.560
gigantic building.
And I ask,

2180
02:27:08.561 --> 02:27:13.000
how many people were having these experiences here at a time?
You said,

2181
02:27:13.300 --> 02:27:15.820
at least,
you know,
in the,
in the last stage,

2182
02:27:16.060 --> 02:27:19.630
3000 people every five years,
we are getting this,

2183
02:27:20.110 --> 02:27:24.940
this dose of this.
Uh,
so,
uh,
you know,
when I,
when I read Plato now,

2184
02:27:24.941 --> 02:27:28.110
I don't see him like pacing in the academy and say,
go,

2185
02:27:28.111 --> 02:27:30.820
let me see how the world works.
You know,
we have not done this,

2186
02:27:30.821 --> 02:27:33.280
but there's this level of the,
with the archetypes.

2187
02:27:33.281 --> 02:27:35.310
And so this is something that you can explore.

2188
02:27:35.311 --> 02:27:40.060
You can experience archetypes in a,
in psychedelic session.
So these are all,
all,

2189
02:27:40.061 --> 02:27:44.680
uh,
the philosophy was inspired by,
by psychedelic experiences.

2190
02:27:45.850 --> 02:27:46.391
<v 1>What do you,</v>

2191
02:27:46.391 --> 02:27:51.130
what do you think humanity needs most right now?

2192
02:27:51.410 --> 02:27:56.380
And you,
in your opinion,
if that's what people,
do you have any big question?
Yeah.

2193
02:27:56.381 --> 02:28:01.060
What,
what,
what do you think humanity needs most right now?
What we need?

2194
02:28:01.180 --> 02:28:05.530
Yeah.
If there's any particular type of change or shift the,
no,

2195
02:28:05.620 --> 02:28:06.453
I haven't met him.

2196
02:28:07.800 --> 02:28:08.530
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2197
02:28:08.530 --> 02:28:13.150
<v 4>Well,
we,
I think,
you know,
the,
uh,
the monastery materialistic paradigm,</v>

2198
02:28:13.151 --> 02:28:18.100
I think it's the really destroying this,
uh,
uh,
this planet.

2199
02:28:18.190 --> 02:28:21.950
And we have a,
you know,
we have philosophy,

2200
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:26.960
<v 1>experiential spirituality that people have really,
the experience don't have,</v>

2201
02:28:26.990 --> 02:28:30.680
uh,
have,
uh,
spiritual experiences,

2202
02:28:30.681 --> 02:28:32.300
which are nondenominational,

2203
02:28:32.340 --> 02:28:36.260
which are a non chauvinistic nonsectarian,

2204
02:28:36.261 --> 02:28:41.140
which are universal,
all inclusive,
all uh,
or,
um,

2205
02:28:42.090 --> 02:28:45.470
uh,
embracing to people who have these,

2206
02:28:45.530 --> 02:28:48.790
these direct spiritual experiences.
They,

2207
02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:53.600
they don't experience division in the world.
You know,
the,

2208
02:28:53.601 --> 02:28:58.100
what happened with the,
with the great organized religions is that they,

2209
02:28:58.220 --> 02:28:58.990
they,
uh,

2210
02:28:58.990 --> 02:29:03.380
unite people who are willing to see it the same way and worship the same way.

2211
02:29:04.160 --> 02:29:04.431
Uh,

2212
02:29:04.431 --> 02:29:08.300
but at the same time divide the world because they set it against another group

2213
02:29:08.660 --> 02:29:12.340
which have taken sort of different archetypes in different,
uh,

2214
02:29:12.740 --> 02:29:16.460
different ways of worshiping.
So then you have a situation where,
you know,

2215
02:29:16.461 --> 02:29:21.370
we are Christians,
you all other guys are pagans and there's,

2216
02:29:21.380 --> 02:29:25.250
we really have to convert you or there's really not a good place for you here.

2217
02:29:25.550 --> 02:29:29.840
Or we are,
uh,
Muslims and you guys all are infidels.

2218
02:29:29.900 --> 02:29:33.740
Let go that have sacred word against the infidels.
You know,

2219
02:29:33.741 --> 02:29:36.350
we have juice you are going in and so on.

2220
02:29:37.340 --> 02:29:41.210
And then you have even these kinds of divisions within the same religion.

2221
02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:46.240
There's centuries of bloodshed between Protestants and Catholics.

2222
02:29:48.050 --> 02:29:52.640
And you have the same with the Sunni and the Shia.
They killing each other,

2223
02:29:52.641 --> 02:29:54.530
destroying their own temples.

2224
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:59.660
Now these are not religions that will help us in this situation in the world.
Uh,

2225
02:29:59.900 --> 02:30:03.740
but this is very different with the spirituality,
which is really taking,

2226
02:30:03.980 --> 02:30:07.970
taking everything in and it changes,
it changes,
you know,

2227
02:30:07.971 --> 02:30:11.590
consciousness in a way that people embrace the,
uh,

2228
02:30:11.620 --> 02:30:13.760
the ecological movement.

2229
02:30:13.761 --> 02:30:17.030
They realize we have to treat nature in a different way.

2230
02:30:17.031 --> 02:30:21.560
Because we are so vitally embedded in [inaudible] and entangled in,

2231
02:30:21.580 --> 02:30:25.640
in nature that we will not use nature as commodity.
You know,

2232
02:30:25.641 --> 02:30:30.500
something that should serve as a and uh,
the expense of,
of,

2233
02:30:30.830 --> 02:30:35.720
you know,
destroying the,
storing our environment.
This,
uh,
this,

2234
02:30:35.721 --> 02:30:39.530
you know,
nothing that's more important for us.
We are biological creatures.

2235
02:30:39.531 --> 02:30:40.640
We need air,

2236
02:30:40.730 --> 02:30:45.650
we need water and we need clean soil where we are growing our food.
It's,

2237
02:30:45.651 --> 02:30:50.300
it's,
it's a soul.
So suicidal,

2238
02:30:50.360 --> 02:30:54.820
so self destructive to destroy the basis on which we depend as uh,

2239
02:30:55.430 --> 02:31:00.120
you know,
there should not be anything keeping the environment supporting,
uh,

2240
02:31:00.260 --> 02:31:04.940
life.
No,
no.
You know,
economic profit,
no,
no political,

2241
02:31:04.941 --> 02:31:09.050
no,
no military order.
We should really realize that we are in the same boat.

2242
02:31:11.320 --> 02:31:15.620
You know,
whoever is destroying the environment is,
is uh,
destroying us.

2243
02:31:16.490 --> 02:31:21.030
And there are many places people can find of course,
writing and more about you.

2244
02:31:21.031 --> 02:31:24.900
Stanislav grof.com.
I'll link to all of this in the show notes for people.

2245
02:31:24.901 --> 02:31:26.550
So they'll be able to find that at Tim.
Dot.

2246
02:31:26.551 --> 02:31:31.551
Blog slash podcast and I certainly recommend that people check out your books,

2247
02:31:32.180 --> 02:31:34.510
including when the impossible happens.
I,

2248
02:31:34.520 --> 02:31:38.130
a friend of mine who involved in scientific research recommended I read the

2249
02:31:38.131 --> 02:31:40.920
cosmic game.
And,
uh,

2250
02:31:40.950 --> 02:31:43.800
I'm wondering if before we wrap up,

2251
02:31:43.801 --> 02:31:48.480
maybe could you share one more story,
uh,
any story that,

2252
02:31:48.510 --> 02:31:49.350
that,
uh,

2253
02:31:49.620 --> 02:31:54.120
to folks out there who are wondering if there might be more to the story than

2254
02:31:54.121 --> 02:31:58.290
just the,
the purely material,
sort of a hyper rational,

2255
02:31:58.500 --> 02:32:01.290
materialistic worldview.
There might just be more to the story.

2256
02:32:01.710 --> 02:32:03.930
I'm wondering if there's anything else that you can share.

2257
02:32:03.931 --> 02:32:06.990
I remember the coming across the pig,
God,
his story.
I mean,

2258
02:32:07.380 --> 02:32:09.360
there are so many to choose from.
Uh,
but

2259
02:32:09.720 --> 02:32:14.560
<v 4>yeah,
let me,
let me do one that's kind of,
I think he's,
uh,</v>

2260
02:32:15.030 --> 02:32:19.270
you know,
has a larger kind of importance than,

2261
02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:23.370
than just mentioning one of and clinical story and sold.

2262
02:32:23.371 --> 02:32:28.371
So a story from when the impossible happens and it has to do with the experience

2263
02:32:28.981 --> 02:32:30.810
that I had in a peyote ceremony.

2264
02:32:32.280 --> 02:32:34.740
So when I came to the United States,
you know,

2265
02:32:34.741 --> 02:32:38.730
I heard about [inaudible] and so on.
I never had a chance being in,

2266
02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:44.360
in a Czechoslovakia and not having the possibility of traveling to have the

2267
02:32:44.610 --> 02:32:47.190
Toyota experience.
So I was very interested in that.

2268
02:32:47.970 --> 02:32:52.450
And we had this program for professionals.
Um,

2269
02:32:52.590 --> 02:32:57.530
one of the programs at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center,
and,
uh,
the,

2270
02:32:57.540 --> 02:33:00.480
one of the persons who came and was a Ken Godfrey,

2271
02:33:00.750 --> 02:33:04.440
who was the psychiatrist at the Va Hospital in Topeka,
Kansas.

2272
02:33:05.070 --> 02:33:07.740
He was himself,
uh,
you know,

2273
02:33:07.741 --> 02:33:12.380
native American and his wife was native American and he was running a

2274
02:33:12.780 --> 02:33:17.070
psychedelic program in,
in,
uh,
in Topeka.
Uh,

2275
02:33:17.100 --> 02:33:19.410
but he didn't have anybody to sit for him.

2276
02:33:19.411 --> 02:33:24.411
So he came for his own session and I sit in history psychedelic session.

2277
02:33:24.621 --> 02:33:29.160
So,
you know,
we became very,
very close.
And so when,
uh,

2278
02:33:29.161 --> 02:33:31.590
after his last session,
we were talking,
I said,
Ken,

2279
02:33:31.830 --> 02:33:36.830
is there any possibility you can get me into a native American church ceremony?

2280
02:33:37.890 --> 02:33:42.360
And he says,
I will try.
And then he called in a few days and say,
you know,

2281
02:33:42.361 --> 02:33:44.830
I talked to the road chief,
uh,

2282
02:33:45.180 --> 02:33:48.270
and you can come and you can bring four of your friends.

2283
02:33:49.350 --> 02:33:50.340
So anyway,

2284
02:33:50.341 --> 02:33:55.341
we sort of got into the airplane and flew to Topeka and then drove into to the

2285
02:33:55.471 --> 02:33:58.350
middle of the Kansas prairie there.

2286
02:33:58.770 --> 02:34:01.580
And there were these teepees and uh,
this,
uh,

2287
02:34:01.730 --> 02:34:06.000
the ceremony was being prepared and we had to go through kind of a clearance

2288
02:34:06.001 --> 02:34:08.400
that they wanted to find out what kind of people we were.

2289
02:34:08.580 --> 02:34:12.810
We had to tell them about ourselves and we go just a lot of aggressive comments

2290
02:34:12.811 --> 02:34:17.560
from them about,
uh,
how,
you know,
white people came and they,
uh,

2291
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:22.810
they have,
uh,
taken their land.
They had killed their buffalo,
they're killed,

2292
02:34:23.320 --> 02:34:27.310
they're warriors,
they have raped a,
their women and so on.

2293
02:34:28.090 --> 02:34:32.020
And so there was a sort of,
almost like an encounter group.

2294
02:34:32.050 --> 02:34:33.490
And as we were going on,

2295
02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:38.290
they were sort of finding out that we were okay and one after another that we

2296
02:34:38.291 --> 02:34:39.160
can participate.

2297
02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:43.480
And at the end there was just one very sort of dark solid men who wouldn't have

2298
02:34:43.510 --> 02:34:47.080
any of us.
We had,
we were like Pale faces and that was it,
you know,

2299
02:34:47.081 --> 02:34:49.510
is not going to ever in the sacred ceremony.

2300
02:34:49.870 --> 02:34:54.010
And then he get onto a lot of peer pressure.
It was time to start and people say,

2301
02:34:54.011 --> 02:34:58.630
come on,
you know,
let it go.
And so he did say yes,
but it was really no,

2302
02:34:59.230 --> 02:35:04.210
and I was a in the tp,
I was sitting across him and then,

2303
02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:09.180
uh,
the,
the buttons,
two buttons where we're a past and a,

2304
02:35:09.190 --> 02:35:14.190
then it started coming on and he sort of was really like radiating like a laser

2305
02:35:15.641 --> 02:35:18.480
beam toward me.
You know,
the hey treat was kind of an,

2306
02:35:18.580 --> 02:35:22.210
everything was amplified of course by the,
by a pot.

2307
02:35:22.870 --> 02:35:24.700
And we were doing the rounds.

2308
02:35:24.790 --> 02:35:28.780
When you pass a staff and a drum and every time you get it,

2309
02:35:28.781 --> 02:35:29.770
you can say something,

2310
02:35:29.771 --> 02:35:33.850
you can sing a song or invite people to do something or make a confession or

2311
02:35:33.851 --> 02:35:36.460
whatever,
but you can also pass.

2312
02:35:36.790 --> 02:35:40.150
And every time it came to him he would grab it.
And push it.

2313
02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:42.160
He just would not participate.

2314
02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:48.060
And so we will all these rounds and we were going through the Ras last round,
um,

2315
02:35:48.670 --> 02:35:52.700
where everybody can say something and a probably high who was a,

2316
02:35:53.010 --> 02:35:56.380
another LSD therapist from,
from a Maryland working with us,

2317
02:35:56.650 --> 02:36:01.650
Helen Bonnie and her sister Helen Bonny was our music therapist and Walter Use

2318
02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:06.910
Clark was very famous,
a professor of religion.
And uh,

2319
02:36:07.090 --> 02:36:09.590
so as we were doing the last round,
uh,

2320
02:36:10.090 --> 02:36:14.140
water use in Clark gave this,
you know,
almost like masochistic,

2321
02:36:14.141 --> 02:36:19.000
a kind of a speech.
He said how wonderful it was from your,
you know,

2322
02:36:19.300 --> 02:36:24.300
brothers and sisters to take us into the sacred ceremony after what we have done

2323
02:36:24.311 --> 02:36:28.900
to you have killed your buffalo and your warriors and rape your women and taking

2324
02:36:28.901 --> 02:36:32.170
your spirituality.
And then somehow,

2325
02:36:32.680 --> 02:36:35.900
I don't remember except exactly the context he mentioned me and said,

2326
02:36:35.950 --> 02:36:40.060
especially stand here,
who was so far from his native Czechoslovakia.

2327
02:36:40.900 --> 02:36:45.900
And suddenly when he mentioned that it was like a lightning hit this guy and he

2328
02:36:46.451 --> 02:36:50.470
started shaking,
he got up,
he threw himself into my lab at put,

2329
02:36:50.471 --> 02:36:52.950
put his head into my lab,
sort of not,

2330
02:36:52.951 --> 02:36:56.530
what's the tears were running out of his eyes and,
and,
you know,

2331
02:36:56.800 --> 02:36:57.910
snot out of his nose.

2332
02:36:58.340 --> 02:37:03.340
It became like one of our workshops that we sort of close work with people and

2333
02:37:03.850 --> 02:37:04.960
everybody was watching,

2334
02:37:04.961 --> 02:37:08.080
nobody knew what was happening and this was happening for awhile.

2335
02:37:08.830 --> 02:37:13.180
And then he got up and went back to his place,

2336
02:37:13.181 --> 02:37:16.400
sit down and not,
not talking,
just sitting there.

2337
02:37:17.540 --> 02:37:20.850
And there was like a lot of,
lot of pressure,
you know,
psychological pressure,

2338
02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:25.670
people wanting to know what was happening.
And then he sits,
you know,
uh,

2339
02:37:25.671 --> 02:37:27.170
I have to say something horrible.

2340
02:37:27.950 --> 02:37:31.010
I thought you were all Americans.

2341
02:37:31.550 --> 02:37:34.700
I didn't know Stan was from Czechoslovakia.
You know,

2342
02:37:34.701 --> 02:37:38.840
the checks are not known as your archetype of Raiders of the wild west.
Exactly.

2343
02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:43.340
So his,
I treated him,
uh,
as a,

2344
02:37:43.341 --> 02:37:48.341
as if we were an American and I hated him through the whole ceremony.

2345
02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:53.450
And,
uh,
it's just more,
more than I can,
I can take,
you know,

2346
02:37:53.451 --> 02:37:57.290
and,
uh,
then what sitting there and,
uh,

2347
02:37:57.470 --> 02:38:01.010
it was clear that something more was coming.
And then he said,

2348
02:38:01.460 --> 02:38:04.610
but it's worse than that.
During the Second World War,

2349
02:38:04.611 --> 02:38:09.611
I was drafted in the American air force and I was personally present in the air

2350
02:38:09.741 --> 02:38:13.640
raid on his city.
There was five days before the end of the war.

2351
02:38:13.820 --> 02:38:14.900
There was an American,

2352
02:38:15.340 --> 02:38:20.340
a attack on and that destroyed the automobile factory there and damaged pills.

2353
02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:26.120
So he stayed home.
But I went and I killed his people.

2354
02:38:26.121 --> 02:38:29.210
Our roles were reversed.
And that's just too much for me.

2355
02:38:30.350 --> 02:38:35.350
And then he got up and he went to the four Americans there and embrace them.

2356
02:38:35.690 --> 02:38:40.180
He says,
uh,
you are not my enemies.
You are,
you are my friends.

2357
02:38:40.190 --> 02:38:43.640
He says,
we are all in the same boat.
We,
if we,

2358
02:38:43.650 --> 02:38:48.350
if we hold the old grudges,
uh,
we,
we all die.

2359
02:38:48.830 --> 02:38:53.690
We have,
we are all
children of mother earth.

2360
02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:57.620
And we have to,
we have to sort of,
uh,
uh,

2361
02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:02.180
really sort of learn how to,
how to live with each other.

2362
02:39:02.180 --> 02:39:06.500
And how to love each other.
And then he ended in his says,

2363
02:39:06.950 --> 02:39:09.460
well,
they believe in reincarnation.
So says,
well,

2364
02:39:09.710 --> 02:39:13.610
for what I can say when this was happening,
I might have been on the other side.

2365
02:39:14.710 --> 02:39:17.920
And you know,
we were still still under the influence of priorities.

2366
02:39:17.921 --> 02:39:21.200
So we were all crying and sort of embracing each other.

2367
02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:25.760
And that was fear of reconciliation was amazing.

2368
02:39:26.630 --> 02:39:31.600
I actually told that story at the,
at the end of,
uh,

2369
02:39:31.730 --> 02:39:34.810
the international transpersonal conference in Prague when I was bringing

2370
02:39:34.830 --> 02:39:39.780
transpersonal psychology back to Prague because we had all these,

2371
02:39:39.820 --> 02:39:40.310
you know,

2372
02:39:40.310 --> 02:39:44.990
European nations that had all kinds of grudges and really didn't like each
other.

2373
02:39:45.080 --> 02:39:50.000
Like we were occupied by Nazi Germany for six years,
you know,

2374
02:39:50.001 --> 02:39:52.880
a lot of people killed and it up in the concentration camps.

2375
02:39:53.180 --> 02:39:57.860
Then we had years of,
uh,
uh,
Communist.
Uh,

2376
02:39:57.890 --> 02:40:00.420
they're in,
so nobody liked a Russian,
none,

2377
02:40:00.421 --> 02:40:03.380
none of the people from the eastern European countries,

2378
02:40:03.381 --> 02:40:08.120
like either Russia or Germany.
We had sort of German and Jews there.

2379
02:40:08.900 --> 02:40:10.820
And,
uh,
uh,

2380
02:40:10.970 --> 02:40:15.540
what was amazing that we did a large holotropic breathwork,
uh,
you know,

2381
02:40:15.570 --> 02:40:18.270
that'd be for the conference as a,
as a pre conference workshop.

2382
02:40:18.990 --> 02:40:23.100
And it was amazing how within within two days,
I mean,

2383
02:40:23.101 --> 02:40:26.730
some of these boundaries where were melting and you know,

2384
02:40:26.731 --> 02:40:30.540
people embracing each other and,
uh,
sitting for each other.

2385
02:40:30.541 --> 02:40:33.780
And when people were owning their own emotional problems,

2386
02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:37.980
they actually activated the best in other people.

2387
02:40:38.040 --> 02:40:41.130
And in spite of language difficulties and so on,

2388
02:40:41.131 --> 02:40:45.930
there was really a change of the,
of the atmosphere,
uh,
from,

2389
02:40:46.310 --> 02:40:50.820
you know,
all these antagonisms that were certainly in the air at the beginning.

2390
02:40:52.530 --> 02:40:56.370
What a wonderful story.
So anyway,
that's my story.
Thank you.
Psychotic,

2391
02:40:56.390 --> 02:40:58.110
less lesson in forgiveness.

2392
02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:03.600
<v 1>I think we could all use lessons and forgiveness not only towards others,</v>

2393
02:41:03.601 --> 02:41:05.400
but towards ourselves.

2394
02:41:05.460 --> 02:41:10.290
And I really want to express gratitude.

2395
02:41:10.570 --> 02:41:14.380
Uh,
and thanks certainly,
uh,

2396
02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:19.440
for the experiences that I've had,
which had been informed by your writing and,

2397
02:41:19.441 --> 02:41:20.920
uh,
people who have,
uh,

2398
02:41:20.970 --> 02:41:25.820
indirectly or directly been trained by you in some respects.
And,
uh,

2399
02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:28.560
to thank you on behalf of no doubt,

2400
02:41:28.561 --> 02:41:32.720
many people who are listening who have had similar experiences.
And,
uh,
I get,

2401
02:41:32.730 --> 02:41:33.270
I'm very,

2402
02:41:33.270 --> 02:41:37.980
I very cautiously optimistic about this,

2403
02:41:38.030 --> 02:41:41.520
this renaissance that we're witnessing and hopefully we won't repeat some of the

2404
02:41:41.521 --> 02:41:44.340
same mistakes that appear to have been made,

2405
02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:47.860
but the social circumstances are so different.
And,
uh,

2406
02:41:47.960 --> 02:41:50.520
we really appreciate you taking the time today.
Uh,

2407
02:41:50.650 --> 02:41:54.540
I certainly hope this isn't our last conversation.
Uh,
but,
uh,

2408
02:41:54.570 --> 02:41:58.140
I want to be respectful of your time and we've,
we've gone for quite,

2409
02:41:58.141 --> 02:41:59.370
quite a bit already today.

2410
02:41:59.730 --> 02:42:04.230
Is there anything else that you would like to say to the people listening,
uh,

2411
02:42:04.231 --> 02:42:09.060
we're asking of them before we,
before we end this particular conversation?

2412
02:42:09.350 --> 02:42:10.290
<v 4>Well,
maybe it'll repeat,</v>

2413
02:42:10.320 --> 02:42:14.940
you know what the colleague was stuff young said that I would really endorse

2414
02:42:15.630 --> 02:42:16.610
that.
Uh,

2415
02:42:17.280 --> 02:42:21.660
it's important that we live our life not just sort of by responding to what is

2416
02:42:21.661 --> 02:42:26.030
happening outside of us,
but spending some time in some kind of focus.

2417
02:42:26.031 --> 02:42:31.031
The self exploration and the yen debt can read too in a transformation.

2418
02:42:31.051 --> 02:42:35.910
So we live our life as a synthesis of what we see outside and what comes from

2419
02:42:35.911 --> 02:42:40.500
within it would say you,
you get lessons from what he called the self,

2420
02:42:40.530 --> 02:42:45.360
the higher I aspect of our hour personality.
So,
you know,

2421
02:42:45.361 --> 02:42:50.010
part of the,
part of the problem of the industrial civilization,
we lost this,
uh,

2422
02:42:50.550 --> 02:42:52.640
this,
uh,
tradition,
uh,

2423
02:42:52.650 --> 02:42:57.600
off if you want of psychonautics all the other groups of humanity way back

2424
02:42:57.601 --> 02:43:00.180
probably into the Palaeolithic.
They were,

2425
02:43:00.210 --> 02:43:05.070
they weren't using these holotropic states for healing,
for,
uh,

2426
02:43:05.360 --> 02:43:09.630
you know,
transformation for the main main vehicle for ritual,

2427
02:43:09.870 --> 02:43:13.960
a spiritual,
uh,
alive.
They weren't using it for a lot of,
uh,

2428
02:43:14.350 --> 02:43:18.520
practical things as an inspiration for,
for art and so on.

2429
02:43:19.120 --> 02:43:20.100
So,
um,

2430
02:43:21.150 --> 02:43:25.330
I see this a distributor brand as the renaissance that is happening now,

2431
02:43:25.780 --> 02:43:30.490
not just this correcting of these,
of these,
you know,
uh,
uh,
really,

2432
02:43:30.500 --> 02:43:31.333
uh,

2433
02:43:32.090 --> 02:43:36.880
terrible administrative legal mistakes that were done that stopped the research

2434
02:43:36.881 --> 02:43:40.540
for 40 years.
I returned to the research.
Uh,

2435
02:43:40.600 --> 02:43:43.910
I see it also as,
uh,
the,

2436
02:43:44.070 --> 02:43:49.070
the possibility of the industrial civilization to join the rest of humanity.

2437
02:43:50.441 --> 02:43:54.550
That always was combining somehow the,
these,
uh,
spiritual,

2438
02:43:54.610 --> 02:43:58.450
inner spiritual ritual experiences with whatever they were doing in the,

2439
02:43:58.870 --> 02:44:03.220
in the external world.
Well,
thank you so much.
Uh,

2440
02:44:03.610 --> 02:44:05.680
uh,
again,
uh,
Tim,

2441
02:44:06.610 --> 02:44:11.290
thank you so much for everything you have been,
you have been doing and uh,

2442
02:44:11.950 --> 02:44:16.240
thank you for this,
for this opportunity to,
you know,

2443
02:44:16.241 --> 02:44:19.480
share some of my life.
It was with your listeners.

2444
02:44:21.030 --> 02:44:25.960
<v 1>It's such a pleasure and uh,
I can only aspire to,
uh,</v>

2445
02:44:26.370 --> 02:44:31.350
contribute in some small way.
Uh,
and I'm excited to see,

2446
02:44:31.710 --> 02:44:32.070
uh,

2447
02:44:32.070 --> 02:44:36.690
what you do from this point forward and you seem to have as much energy as ever

2448
02:44:36.990 --> 02:44:39.390
traveling around the world doing what you do.

2449
02:44:39.540 --> 02:44:44.450
And I hope we can have many,
many more conversations and uh,

2450
02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:45.540
but,
but for today,

2451
02:44:45.990 --> 02:44:50.940
I want to be respectful of your time since you do have so many things going on.

2452
02:44:50.970 --> 02:44:55.620
And I will certainly in the show notes to everybody listening,

2453
02:44:55.800 --> 02:45:00.510
uh,
link to everything we've discussed,
all of the books,
the different websites,

2454
02:45:00.511 --> 02:45:01.590
foundations and so on.

2455
02:45:02.370 --> 02:45:07.130
And you can find all those at tim.blog/podcast.
Uh,

2456
02:45:07.170 --> 02:45:09.780
Stan,
thank you so much.
I really,
really appreciate it.

2457
02:45:10.220 --> 02:45:15.170
<v 4>Again,
it's wonderful.
It's great to have,
uh,
an interview or you know,</v>

2458
02:45:15.171 --> 02:45:19.160
who knows what we are talking about.
It doesn't,
it doesn't always happen.

2459
02:45:20.400 --> 02:45:21.560
I suppose one of the great ones.

2460
02:45:21.660 --> 02:45:25.650
<v 6>Thank you so much.
I really,
really appreciate it and to everybody listening,</v>

2461
02:45:26.430 --> 02:45:31.430
keep your mind open and look outside but also look inside as Stan mentioned.

2462
02:45:32.580 --> 02:45:36.990
And until next time,
thank you for listening.
Hey guys,

2463
02:45:36.991 --> 02:45:40.950
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.
Number one,

2464
02:45:41.190 --> 02:45:46.110
this is five bullet Friday.
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2465
02:45:46.140 --> 02:45:48.780
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday?

2466
02:45:49.080 --> 02:45:53.310
That provides a little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet

2467
02:45:53.311 --> 02:45:53.630
Fridays.

2468
02:45:53.630 --> 02:45:58.200
A very short email where I share the coolest things I found or that I've been

2469
02:45:58.201 --> 02:45:59.520
pondering over the week.

2470
02:45:59.730 --> 02:46:02.490
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

2471
02:46:02.491 --> 02:46:05.940
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2472
02:46:05.970 --> 02:46:10.250
somehow dug up in the other world of the,
as I do.

2473
02:46:10.550 --> 02:46:15.550
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

2474
02:46:16.191 --> 02:46:18.920
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

2475
02:46:19.010 --> 02:46:23.990
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

2476
02:46:24.080 --> 02:46:26.240
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

2477
02:46:26.480 --> 02:46:31.160
Just go to a four hour work week.com that's four hour workweek.com all spelled

2478
02:46:31.161 --> 02:46:34.310
out and just drop in your email and you'll get the very next one.

2479
02:46:34.540 --> 02:46:36.440
And if you sign up,
I hope you enjoy it.

2480
02:46:37.430 --> 02:46:39.530
This episode is brought to you by legal zoom,

2481
02:46:39.710 --> 02:46:43.160
which more than 2 million Americans have used to help start their businesses.

2482
02:46:43.520 --> 02:46:47.630
Past guests even such as well,
wordpress lead developer,

2483
02:46:47.631 --> 02:46:51.890
CEO of Automattic,
Matt Mullenweg now valued at more than billion dollars,

2484
02:46:51.891 --> 02:46:54.470
have used legal zoom to help their business needs.

2485
02:46:54.471 --> 02:46:56.900
Specifically in his case to form this company butts.

2486
02:46:57.340 --> 02:46:59.690
Legal Zoom isn't just for launching your business.

2487
02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:03.800
Their services include everything from helping you to manage changing tax laws,

2488
02:47:03.801 --> 02:47:08.330
reviewing contracts,
creating Ndas,
nondisclosure agreements,
important stuff,

2489
02:47:08.570 --> 02:47:12.680
handling lease agreements and it's this thing with really any other legal

2490
02:47:12.681 --> 02:47:13.700
challenge,
hurdle,

2491
02:47:13.710 --> 02:47:17.660
inconvenience that typically takes time and effort away from running your

2492
02:47:17.661 --> 02:47:18.494
business.

2493
02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:21.950
The best part is that you won't get charged by the hour because legal zoom isn't

2494
02:47:21.980 --> 02:47:26.780
a law firms so they won't be running the clock up and spinning circles just to

2495
02:47:27.080 --> 02:47:28.640
raise your bill.

2496
02:47:28.790 --> 02:47:32.840
Instead they just ask you to pay one low upfront price for whatever it is that

2497
02:47:32.841 --> 02:47:34.370
you're looking to get all the card style,

02:47:45.860 --> 02:47:49.640
I don't know what the special savings is folks,

02:48:02.570 --> 02:48:04.580
this episode is brought to you by Peloton,

2506
02:48:04.581 --> 02:48:06.230
which I've been using [inaudible] for about a year now.

2507
02:48:06.530 --> 02:48:10.490
Peloton is a cutting edge indoor cycling bike that brings live studio classes

2508
02:48:10.491 --> 02:48:12.980
right into your home.
You can also do on demand,

2509
02:48:12.981 --> 02:48:15.890
which is what I do and we'll come back to them so you don't have to worry about

2510
02:48:15.891 --> 02:48:20.060
fitting classes into a busy schedule or making it to a studio or gym with a

2511
02:48:20.061 --> 02:48:22.940
hectic or unpredictable commute.
I,
for instance,

2512
02:48:22.970 --> 02:48:27.110
have a Peloton bike right in my master bedroom at home and it's one of the first

2513
02:48:27.111 --> 02:48:30.800
things I do.
Many mornings I wake up and meditate for a bit.

2514
02:48:31.130 --> 02:48:35.360
Then I knock out a short 20 minute ride in my undies.
Hard to do that at the gym,

2515
02:48:35.630 --> 02:48:38.120
take a shower and I'm in higher gear for the rest of the day.

2516
02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:41.930
It's really convenient and has become something that I look forward to see.

2517
02:48:41.931 --> 02:48:44.090
You have a lot of options for one if you'd like.

2518
02:48:44.091 --> 02:48:47.600
You can ride live with thousands of other writers across the country on an

2519
02:48:47.601 --> 02:48:49.670
interactive leaderboard to keep him motivated.

2520
02:48:50.060 --> 02:48:55.060
There are also up to 14 new classes added every day with more than 8,000 classes

2521
02:48:55.191 --> 02:49:00.170
on demand and you can pick based on length,
45 minutes,
20 minutes,
whatever music,

2522
02:49:00.171 --> 02:49:04.430
hip hop,
rock and roll or say low impact versus high intensity or interval.

2523
02:49:04.790 --> 02:49:09.630
You can pick the class structure and style that works for you and in my case I

2524
02:49:09.631 --> 02:49:13.800
quite like now we'll birds and I tend to do on demand and listened to a lot of

2525
02:49:13.801 --> 02:49:16.080
and watch many of the same classes over and over,

2526
02:49:16.380 --> 02:49:18.960
but I'm kind of promiscuous and also enjoy classes from a lot of the other

2527
02:49:18.961 --> 02:49:19.794
instructors.

2528
02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:24.090
They have Peloton and amazing roster of incredible instructors in New York City

2529
02:49:24.290 --> 02:49:27.390
with a whole range of styles and personalities so you can find what you're

2530
02:49:27.410 --> 02:49:28.243
looking for.

2531
02:49:28.350 --> 02:49:32.280
You also get real time metrics that you can use to track your performance over

2532
02:49:32.281 --> 02:49:37.140
time and that will help,
I would say catalyze you to beat your personal best.

2533
02:49:37.140 --> 02:49:40.200
Now that all sounds good,
right?
Gamification,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada.

2534
02:49:40.410 --> 02:49:44.460
I didn't think that it would work for me or in any way incentivize me,

2535
02:49:44.461 --> 02:49:48.000
but they really 100% hit the nail on the head.
I was very,

2536
02:49:48.001 --> 02:49:53.001
very impressed with how motivating it was and it worked tremendously to keep me

2537
02:49:53.611 --> 02:49:57.960
pushing,
which quite honestly it takes a fair amount.
I can get quite lazy,

2538
02:49:57.961 --> 02:50:00.540
particularly with anything that edges on endurance,

2539
02:50:00.541 --> 02:50:04.830
which is kind of more than five reps of anything for me.
So check it out.
