Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:05.980
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.570
I'm a cybernetic organism.

officio.

6
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.580
99 designs is the world's largest online marketplace of graphic designers and I

7
00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:37.170
have used 99 designs for years,

8
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:40.410
including to get cover concepts for the four hour body,

9
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:44.580
which went on to become number one New York Times Number One Wall Street
Journal.

10
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.840
It was a huge shit and here's how it works and you can check everything out,

11
00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:50.430
including some of my competitions.

12
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:54.300
You can see these book covers and so on@ninetyninedesigns.com forward slash Tim,

14
00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:00.540
a tee shirt,
whatever.

15
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.780
You go to 99 designs.com you describe your project and then within a week or

16
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:10.830
less you have tons of designers around the world who compete for your business

and submit different ideas and designs and drafts.

18
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.060
You have an original design that you love or you pay nothing.
It is fantastic.

19
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.730
I have used it.
I have mentioned it before,

20
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:23.400
including in the four hour work week as a resource.

25
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.670
Ex-Officio boy,
where do I begin?
I have a long history with ex-officio.

26
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.910
Ex-Officio makes clothing and as far back as 2007 2008 I had a hit video that

27
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:52.050
went viral called how to travel the world with 10 pounds or less.

28
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:56.820
And I talked about ex-officio underwear.
Ex-Officio underwear is lightweight,

29
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.960
ultra lightweight,
quick drying and antimicrobial.
Why is this important?
Well,

30
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:03.870
I've gone through 20 plus countries with two pairs of underwear before,

31
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.070
both from ex-officio,
and I'm not alone in this.
This might sound crazy,

32
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:11.310
but a lot of executives,
for instance,
we'll take this underwear,

33
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.640
they'll wash it in the sink or somewhere else,
roll it up in a towel,

34
00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:19.200
like a Burrito step on it,
and a few hours later they are completely dry,

35
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:22.320
completely clean.
You don't have to just have to,
and yes,

36
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:24.300
they have to be comfortable for all day wear,

37
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.270
but check out their clothing as well as their underwear.

42
00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:42.480
this clothing is not just for the gents ladies.

43
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:47.400
You have choices too and they really have an incredible collection of high

Hello Ladies and germs.
This is Ferriss,
yet again,

47
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.680
running out the door to a flight.

48
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.660
But I have such an exciting episode.
I can barely contain myself.

49
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.280
I might just,
we myself on my way across the country,
but I digress.

50
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.130
Probably Tmi.
Let me answer it.
Just a couple of questions.

51
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:20.131
What does this podcast about you long term listeners might know longterm long

52
00:03:20.371 --> 00:03:22.870
time that it's about dissecting excellence,

53
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:27.871
trying to tease apart what makes world class performers so good at what they do.

54
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.540
Finding the tools and tactics that you can apply in this episode.

55
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:33.280
Features Maria Popova.

56
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.330
I'm about to explain who she is and if you don't know who she is or if you are

57
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:39.910
intimately familiar with who she is,
you're in for a treat.

58
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.060
First I'll answer a question that a lot of people ask me and that is what are

59
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:43.810
you reading?
Well,

60
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.490
what I'm reading right now is two books comprised of two books.

61
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.850
The first is William Goldman Adventures in the screen trade.

62
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.080
Goldman is the screenwriter behind such movies as the princess bride,

63
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.410
one of my favorites of all time and butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid.

64
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.510
The second book is John Muir wilderness essays,
so very different.
Both very,

65
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:07.090
very good and highly recommended.
The adventures in the screen.

66
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:11.500
Trade is a little outdated with some of the contents because it's related to

67
00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:15.700
film and it was written in the 80s but there are a lot of timeless principles

68
00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:20.110
and Goldman is just hilarious,
but moving on the guest,
Maria Popova,

69
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.220
oh my goodness,
where to start.
She would describe herself as a reader,
writer,

70
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.570
interestingness,
hunter gatherer and curious mind at large.

71
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.600
What does that mean?
It'll all make sense in just a few seconds.

72
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.590
While she's written for all sorts of amazing outlets like the Atlantic and the

73
00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:36.424
New York Times,

74
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.260
I find her most amazing project to be brainpickings.org and I'm not alone in

75
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:41.950
this.

76
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.930
Founded in 2006 as a weekly email that she sent out to seven friends,
coworkers,

77
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:48.010
really very informal.

78
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.300
Brainpickings was eventually brought online and now it gets more than 5 million

79
00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:56.530
readers per month.
It is massive.
Many of you ask,

80
00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:59.500
what blogs do you read often,
what do you do online?

81
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:00.730
Where do you spend most of your time?

82
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.000
The answer is that I read very few sites consistently.

83
00:05:04.001 --> 00:05:07.900
I don't have that type of loyalty,
but brainpickings is one of the few,

84
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.610
it is a treasure trove.
It is Maria's one woman labor of love,

85
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.550
her subjective lens on what matters.

86
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.630
It's also an inquiry into how to live and what it means to lead a good life.

87
00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:20.890
This is what hooks me of course,

88
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:25.840
because she'll pull from excerpts and reading from the Stoics,

89
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.630
my favorite Seneca to mark Twain,
Oscar Wilde,
and everyone in between.
Uh,

90
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.740
Maria is good at finding the hidden gems to share and the amount of information

91
00:05:36.071 --> 00:05:40.360
this woman consumes and camp can parse down to the finest detail of what will

92
00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:42.700
help you.
Now blows my mind.

93
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.960
She makes me look like the laziest son of a bitch ever.
Uh,

94
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.310
and of course immediately my questions are how,
how does she do that?

95
00:05:51.311 --> 00:05:55.780
How on earth does she do that?
And we dig into this in this interview.
Really,

96
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.490
I try to unearth the hidden gems in her life,
her workflow,

97
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.200
it takes me a few minutes to warm up as it often does,
but once we get going,

98
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:07.100
we geek out like crazy and we talk about almost every aspect of her life,

99
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:11.330
her site,
her business,
her workouts,
her writing,
her workflow,
her tools,

100
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.800
her work arounds,
all of it.
And I love doing this interview.

101
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.010
I hope you love listening to it.
And for bonus credit,

102
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:21.290
for those of you who are super curious,

103
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.040
might have a little bit of extra time to do some detective work.

104
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.750
At one point she mentioned that her Facebook fan page went from a few hundred

105
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.830
thousand people to over 2 million people without explanation.

106
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.150
So if you are able to figure out why that happened,
what contributed to that?

107
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.620
Please let me know.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.640
I'm dying of curiosity and always,

109
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.780
or as always I should say the show notes,
all the links that we mentioned,

110
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:51.770
the tools,
et Cetera,

111
00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:56.771
all of that can be found on the blog at four hour work,

112
00:06:57.111 --> 00:07:00.740
week.com,
forward slash podcast,
four hour workweek.com,

forward slash podcast all spelled out.

114
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:05.990
So you don't need to scribble away furiously with notes.
Uh,
all that you can,

115
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.950
I will have pretty much everything that you will need right there in the show

116
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:14.240
notes.
So without further ado,
please meet Maria Popova.

117
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.130
Hello Ladies and gentlemen,

118
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:22.790
this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Shell.

119
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:28.180
I am extremely excited to have a fellow Geek in arms,

120
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.910
Maria Popova on the line with me.
Maria,
how are you today?

121
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.740
<v 2>Very well,
thank you.
Thank you for having me.</v>

122
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.870
<v 1>And I appreciate your coaching on the last name,</v>

123
00:07:37.871 --> 00:07:42.310
I wasn't sure if it was Popova or Popova.
I have friends who,
for instance,

124
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.130
[inaudible] has a friend.
It's actually novel,

125
00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:48.100
but Americans can't really pull that off.
So he goes for Nevada all.

126
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.290
So I appreciate the coaching and I,
yes,

127
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.110
<v 2>as a country of immigrants,</v>

128
00:07:54.111 --> 00:07:58.790
we have a surprisingly hard time getting people original names.

129
00:07:58.791 --> 00:07:59.624
Right,
right.
Yeah.

130
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.370
<v 1>Oh,
absolutely.
It's,
you know,
just the sort of anglicizing of,</v>

131
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.770
of such a,
uh,
curry sorta like a,

132
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.270
a melting pot of different cultures and you know,
it at the same time,

133
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:15.280
I think it's a reflection of where I spend a lot of time,
uh,

134
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:20.350
which is reading and there are so many words I've embarrassed myself on many

135
00:08:20.451 --> 00:08:24.320
occasions that I've read dozens or even hundreds of times,

136
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:29.330
especially in scientific literature that I've never heard pronounced.
Yeah.

137
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.770
<v 2>Plus reader syndrome as somebody who spends the majority of her waking hours</v>

138
00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:38.120
reading,
you run into that a lot,
especially with,
um,

139
00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:41.120
sort of cultural icons,
last names,

140
00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:43.340
first names that are spelled differently than,

141
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.080
very differently than their pronouns.

142
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:50.270
It's kind of tragic comic when you actually find out how they're pronounced.

143
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:55.770
<v 1>No,
exactly.
Or it can be a real revelation.
I remember when I was a,
uh,
a kid,</v>

144
00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.330
I couldn't hit,
let's say democracy or aristocracy.

145
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:03.300
I could only say because that,
and I'd also read it,
uh,

146
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:07.260
you get a demo Krassi Aristo Krassi for whatever reason I couldn't get the

147
00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:10.210
emphasis right.
Uh,
but coming back to the,

148
00:09:10.211 --> 00:09:14.810
the reading and someone who spends most of their waking hours reading,
uh,
if,

149
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.090
if someone asks you,
and I'm sure occasionally it happens,
you'll,

150
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:22.170
what do you do for those people listening who may not be familiar with you,

151
00:09:22.171 --> 00:09:25.740
but we'll start with a cocktail question.
When someone asks you,
what do you do?

152
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:27.360
How do you answer that?

153
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:29.640
<v 2>Well,</v>

154
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.960
I've answered it differently over the years in part because I think inhabiting

155
00:09:33.961 --> 00:09:36.480
her own identity as kind of a perpetual process.

156
00:09:36.481 --> 00:09:41.481
But right now I would say I read and I write in that order and in between I do

157
00:09:43.741 --> 00:09:48.741
some thinking and I think about how to live a meaningful life basically.

158
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.090
<v 1>And if someone were to go online,
find your work,</v>

159
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.660
end up at brain pickings and they're like,
oh,
this is quite interesting.

160
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.200
What kind of looked over their shoulder because they happen to be doing it on

161
00:10:01.201 --> 00:10:03.620
their iPhone at the party.
And they're like,
what is brain pickings?

162
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.170
How would you describe,
how do you typically describe that?

163
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.680
<v 2>It's just a record of that thinking.</v>

164
00:10:09.681 --> 00:10:14.681
My personal subjective private thinking that takes place between my reading and

165
00:10:14.751 --> 00:10:17.980
takes and the writing and takes form in writing

166
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:22.500
<v 1>collection of very interesting things.
And sometimes you know,</v>

167
00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:26.320
how I can sort of simply put it to folks and brain pickings for those people

168
00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.300
wondering is one of the very few sites.

169
00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:35.800
Then I end up on constantly.
And when people ask me,

170
00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:37.210
what blogs do you read?
I,
I,

171
00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:42.010
I'm embarrassed in some cases kind of humiliated to answer that I don't go

172
00:10:42.011 --> 00:10:45.370
really too many blogs consistently.
Um,

173
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:50.470
and I think part of the reason is so many of them are feel compelled to put out

174
00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:52.571
very,

175
00:10:52.571 --> 00:10:57.430
very timely of the moment material that expires within a few hours.

176
00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.180
And I don't like the feeling of,
uh,

177
00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:06.510
keeping up with the is when the Jones's or just sort of churning out content.

178
00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:12.400
And I remember Kathy Sierra at one time at one point told me that you should

179
00:11:12.401 --> 00:11:16.140
focus on just in time information,
not just in case information.
Uh,

180
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.260
and which I thought was very astute and really sort of profound.

181
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.610
But there are,

182
00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.660
there are two sites that come to mind that I end up on quite a lot.

183
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:30.250
Brainpickings is one,
uh,
and Sam Harris blog yeah.
Is another,

184
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:35.680
uh,
and I saw your,
your review of his latest book Waking Up,
not a review,

185
00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.450
not a review.
I don't review books I bought.
Okay.
No,
this is no,

186
00:11:39.451 --> 00:11:42.570
so this is this annotated reading if they're well,
okay.

187
00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:45.200
So an annotated reading of a,

188
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:49.810
and I definitely want to dig into that annotated reading of waking up,

189
00:11:49.811 --> 00:11:54.060
which I found really,
really impactful me in a lot ways.
It,

190
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.180
it put words to a lot of vague sort of feelings or observations that I had for a

191
00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:02.230
very long time.
Uh,
talking about reviews.

192
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.880
So I pulled a number of my friends and my readers about different questions they

193
00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:11.650
would love to ask you.
And a close friend of mine,
Chris Saka,
uh,

194
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:12.700
he,

195
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:17.700
he came back with what percentage of New York Times bestsellers can be

196
00:12:17.711 --> 00:12:22.480
attributed to your coverage.
And I'd be curious to hear you answer that.

197
00:12:22.481 --> 00:12:24.670
And then there's sort of a followup,
but you've,

198
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.690
you've built this incredible powerhouse of,

199
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.420
uh,
an an outlet for your,

200
00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:35.330
whether it's creative musings or observations and it has a,

201
00:12:35.331 --> 00:12:38.380
a huge influence on what people read.

202
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.830
So if you were to sort of think of that,
how would you answer that question?

203
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:45.830
<v 2>Well,
first of all,
you,
you're very kind to put it that way as a script.</v>

204
00:12:45.831 --> 00:12:50.831
But I think one big caveat to all of that is that the majority of books that I

205
00:12:53.541 --> 00:12:57.500
read and write about,
or very old out of print,
uh,

206
00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.500
things that are not competing for New York Times bestseller.
In fact,

207
00:13:00.501 --> 00:13:04.550
I don't even know if I ever really,
I mean perhaps,
um,

208
00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.840
I dunno if the books that I read have any overlap in the venn diagram of things

209
00:13:08.841 --> 00:13:10.250
with the New York Times bestsellers.

210
00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.570
But I suspect that the reason Chris asked that question is actually that I met

211
00:13:14.571 --> 00:13:18.540
him through his wife who collaborated with Wendy McNaughton,

212
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.850
the illustrator whose work I love.
And I love Wendy on a book about wine.

213
00:13:22.851 --> 00:13:25.130
And that book ended up,

214
00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:30.160
I and I wrote about it because it's lovely and sort of profound and um,

215
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.540
challenges or existing ideas about sort of sensory experience.

216
00:13:35.541 --> 00:13:39.770
And I like things that that takes something very superficial and find something

217
00:13:39.771 --> 00:13:42.440
deeper and something unusual.
And it's uh,
but in any case,

218
00:13:42.441 --> 00:13:46.580
so I wrote about that drug in that particular piece on green pickings seem to do

219
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:50.940
pretty well.
And I think perhaps that warp tour

220
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.620
<v 1>of how much</v>

221
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:58.880
<v 2>contemporary books I really sort of am interested in.
Um,</v>

222
00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:01.770
but,
but I would say that's a minority,

223
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:03.930
<v 1>right.
And for those people wondering,</v>

224
00:14:03.931 --> 00:14:07.380
it's the essential scratch and sniff guide to becoming a wine expert,

225
00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:11.530
which has written along with,
and the illustrations are,
are wonderful.
Uh,

226
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.220
the Richard,
that's his,
the Somalia who is part of that.

227
00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:19.010
And at one point I met with him because I wanted to try to uh,

228
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.760
deconstruct the master,
some lea test and he said,
I can show you how to do it.

229
00:14:23.761 --> 00:14:28.020
And it was just the paired down sort of hacked,
if you will,

230
00:14:28.021 --> 00:14:33.021
version still of passing the masters familiar taste was so intimidating that put

231
00:14:33.271 --> 00:14:37.990
it on ice indefinitely.
But at some point Richard,
we will talk again and uh,
and,

232
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.180
and form a game plan.
The,
so the,

233
00:14:40.181 --> 00:14:44.940
the opposite of course of sort of putting out this material that expires as soon

234
00:14:44.941 --> 00:14:47.700
as it's out on the vine is uh,

235
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.370
putting out what I think you do very often and that is sort of timeless,

236
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:53.930
timely and timeless.

237
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:58.930
I've heard you call it material where you're sort of pulling from old sources

238
00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:00.920
are older sources,
uh,

239
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:05.950
doing pattern recognition to pull from other areas to talk about say a a theme

240
00:15:07.251 --> 00:15:11.860
or,
or,
or something that still affects people.
And uh,

241
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.070
I was,
I was doing research for this interview and uh,
you know,
we've,

242
00:15:16.071 --> 00:15:20.810
we met briefly in New York at an event and I've been a longtime fan of your
work.

243
00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.990
And so I thought to myself like,
you know,
how much,

244
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.770
how much digging do I really need to do?
And Good God,

245
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:32.800
you have such an absolute cannon of work out there.

246
00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:36.560
It is astonishing.
I mean it is really,

247
00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:40.450
<v 2>I find it's just the volume of time really.
It's been,
you know,</v>

248
00:15:40.451 --> 00:15:43.480
I've been doing this for eight years,
coming up actually exactly.

249
00:15:43.481 --> 00:15:48.160
A month from today,
it'll be eight years.
Cumulation you know,

250
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.900
<v 1>and I,
so I was,
I was,
I was,</v>

251
00:15:50.901 --> 00:15:55.560
I'm fascinated by routine and schedule and uh,
you know,

252
00:15:55.561 --> 00:15:58.550
I'm reading from,
of course not,
not the always accurate,

253
00:15:58.551 --> 00:16:02.310
but generally a good place to start Wikipedia and,
uh,

254
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:07.820
it says that brain pickings takes you to 400 plus hours of work per month,

255
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.740
hundreds of pieces of content per day,

256
00:16:09.741 --> 00:16:13.810
12 to 15 books per week that you're reading.
Uh,

257
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.610
how do you,
and I,
I'm,

258
00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:18.740
I know I'm asking a handful of questions that you've been asked before,

259
00:16:18.741 --> 00:16:21.750
but sometimes the answer is change and evolve.

260
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:22.840
<v 2>They always do.</v>

261
00:16:22.841 --> 00:16:27.841
And which is why I actually don't do interviews very frequently because I find

262
00:16:29.351 --> 00:16:30.340
that they sort of

263
00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:37.620
tend to kind of cast this as this static thing that just stays there is some

264
00:16:37.781 --> 00:16:38.920
sort of reference point.

265
00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.880
While we're really just the fluid process and we're constantly evolving.

266
00:16:42.881 --> 00:16:43.720
But in any case,

267
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:48.080
<v 1>no,
definitely.
So what do teens do?
The question that you've,</v>

268
00:16:48.081 --> 00:16:49.310
I'm sure been asked many times,

269
00:16:49.311 --> 00:16:53.840
but I'll ask again is how do you choose the books?

270
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.930
How do you find slash choose the books that you read?

271
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.600
This is a huge problem for me because I,
I,
my,

272
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:03.860
my appetite for reading outstrips the time that I have.

273
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.670
And so I ended up actually,
uh,

274
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:11.710
unfortunately sometimes finding myself anxious because of the number of books

275
00:17:12.471 --> 00:17:14.420
I've taken on it at any given point in time.

276
00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.900
So I'd be curious how you sort of vet the books that you read.

277
00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:24.340
<v 2>Well,
I guess it goes back to that question of,
well,</v>

278
00:17:24.341 --> 00:17:29.341
let me backtrack and just say that I write about a very wide array of

279
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:31.370
disciplines,

280
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:35.610
an era as and sensibilities because that's what I think about too.

281
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:40.450
And the thing from art and science to philosophy,
psychology,

282
00:17:40.451 --> 00:17:44.260
history,
designed poetry,
you name it.

283
00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:49.180
But the common denominator for me as just this very simple question,

284
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:53.020
does this eliminate some aspect,

285
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:57.180
big or small of that grand question that I think we all test the lid everyday,

286
00:17:57.181 --> 00:18:01.170
which is how to live well,
how to live a good,
meaningful,
fulfilling life.

287
00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:03.150
Whether that's,
you know,

288
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:08.180
Aristotle's views on happiness and government or beautiful art from 12th century

289
00:18:09.991 --> 00:18:14.000
Japan or,
or Sam Harris's new book.
Anything.

290
00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.620
<v 1>Got It.
And the,</v>

291
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:23.400
I've read you citing Kurt Vonnegut,
uh,
before,
uh,
on,

292
00:18:23.401 --> 00:18:25.510
against one of my favorite writers of all time.

293
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.060
<v 2>No,
I heard you're a Semicolon,
right?</v>

294
00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.020
<v 1>I think it was</v>

295
00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.690
<v 2>either the interview I did with Kevin Kelly or with Sam,</v>

296
00:18:32.691 --> 00:18:35.750
but I actually have a counterpoint to the semicolon.

297
00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.900
<v 1>Okay.
No,
no,
go on.
So I actually,
uh,
I actually beat,</v>

298
00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:45.940
I brought up the semi colon quote partially as a sort of wink,

299
00:18:46.181 --> 00:18:47.950
wink,
nod,

300
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:53.130
ribbing to a friend of mine named John Romanello who has a tattoo of a semicolon

301
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:58.540
on is,
I think it's his fault.
He left some type nerd.

302
00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:02.480
He loves semi colons.
He also has a molecule of testosterone on the other armies.

303
00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:05.650
He's a fascinating guy.
But,
uh,
the,

304
00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:11.220
the quote that I heard you site that I wanted to dig into a bit was the Kurt

305
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.580
Vonnegut saying,
right to please just one person.

306
00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.850
And so my question to you is,

307
00:19:18.851 --> 00:19:22.780
when you write a,
is that still the case?

308
00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.360
And if so,
who are,
who are you,

309
00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:27.940
who is that person that you are writing for?

310
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:30.920
<v 2>It does very much the case.</v>

311
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:35.000
I still write for an audience of one and that's myself.

312
00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:39.290
It's like I said,
it's just a record of my thought process,

313
00:19:39.291 --> 00:19:44.291
my way of just trying to navigate my way through the world and understand my

314
00:19:45.561 --> 00:19:48.230
place in it,
understand how we relate to one another,

315
00:19:48.231 --> 00:19:51.590
how different pieces of the world relate to each other.

316
00:19:51.591 --> 00:19:53.720
And students create a pattern of,

317
00:19:53.721 --> 00:19:58.721
of meaning out of seemingly unrelated meaningless information and the sort of

318
00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:04.280
intersection of,
or transmutation of information into,

319
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:09.020
into wisdom really,
which is what learning to live is.
It's about Lisbon.
Um,

320
00:20:09.021 --> 00:20:10.240
so I,
and,

321
00:20:10.241 --> 00:20:14.090
and it's interesting too because when I started writing things,

322
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:16.070
like I said almost eight years ago,

323
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.450
it started very much as a private record of my own curiosity.

324
00:20:20.451 --> 00:20:23.570
And I shared it with seven coworkers that I had at the time,

325
00:20:23.571 --> 00:20:26.800
just as a little sort of email newsletter thing.
Um,

326
00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.770
and now to think that there are about 7 million people,

327
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.450
strangers reading it every month,

328
00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:33.483
<v 1>that's amazing.</v>

329
00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:39.920
<v 2>But,
and I'm not sort of number dropping for sale or anything like that,</v>

330
00:20:39.921 --> 00:20:44.921
but just to try to articulate how surreal it feels to me that I still feel like

331
00:20:45.261 --> 00:20:50.140
I'm writing for one person,
one very sort of,
you know,
inward person.

332
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:55.390
But there's also now the awareness that there are people looking on and

333
00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:00.400
interpreting and,
and just relating to this pretty private act.

334
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.900
And it's a strange thing to live with and,
and no way a,
a bad thing.

335
00:21:04.901 --> 00:21:07.060
I'm not complaining about it obviously,

336
00:21:07.061 --> 00:21:10.320
but it's just interesting to observe how,

337
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:15.360
how one relates to oneself when being looked on by a few million people.

338
00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.173
You know.

339
00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:23.090
<v 1>Definitely.
And uh,
there's so many,
it's so many questions I want to ask you.</v>

340
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.330
We might have to do part two at some point because I know we have some time

341
00:21:26.331 --> 00:21:29.000
constraints,
but the uh,

342
00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.210
the where to even begin,
this is where my,

343
00:21:32.211 --> 00:21:36.470
I start fraying at the ends as an interviewer.
So the,
the,

344
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.310
the first question would be related to that.

345
00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:45.820
There's so much temptation to dumb things down or to go after kind of the tried

346
00:21:47.781 --> 00:21:52.000
and true buzzfeed type headlines.
Uh,

347
00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:57.530
do you ever contend with that temptation?
And if,
if so,

348
00:21:57.531 --> 00:22:01.750
how do you resist it?
And I ended,
this is part of the,
you get,

349
00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.730
how do you respond to the,

350
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.750
the expectations of the crowd or the 7 million people looking on,

351
00:22:08.751 --> 00:22:12.200
and I feel this personally sometimes because I have a blog.
It has,

352
00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.340
it's certainly by no means the number of monthly readers that you have.
Um,

353
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:20.860
you know,
I'm somewhere between one and 2 million uniques a month usually.
Uh,

354
00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:24.800
but thank you.
But even at that point,
even though that scale,

355
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:29.420
there are times when I put out something that I feel is very,

356
00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.940
it's very important,
but on the dense side and,

357
00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:39.230
and then it will,
sometimes it takes off,
but,
but sometimes it doesn't.
And,

358
00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:42.860
and there's a lot of temptation when,
for instance,

359
00:22:42.861 --> 00:22:47.060
I know you use social media quite a bit and we'll get to that where I look at

360
00:22:47.061 --> 00:22:48.290
say the retweets,

361
00:22:48.291 --> 00:22:51.650
the favorites on something that's kind of dense and then I'm like,
Oh God,

362
00:22:51.651 --> 00:22:55.250
I should just do like the seven tricks you can,
you can actually teach your cat,

363
00:22:55.251 --> 00:22:59.900
you know,
and get 500,000 retweets.
Um,
is that something that,
that you're,

364
00:22:59.901 --> 00:23:04.901
that ever sort of crosses your mind and do you ever feel that temptation?

365
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.833
<v 3>Okay.</v>

366
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:08.950
<v 2>Well,
you know,</v>

367
00:23:08.951 --> 00:23:13.570
it's interesting because I think anybody who thinks in public,

368
00:23:13.571 --> 00:23:16.690
which is what writing is,
which is even what art is,
it's some sort of

369
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.740
putting a piece of oneself out into the world.

370
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:25.770
Anybody who does that struggles with this really irreconcilable kind of tug of

371
00:23:28.121 --> 00:23:33.121
war between wanting to really stay true to one's experience.

372
00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.540
You know,
and being aware that as soon as it's out in the world,

373
00:23:37.541 --> 00:23:42.520
there is this notion of the other audience.
And you know,
Oscar Wilde,
he,

374
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.940
uh,
very memorably said that I'm a true artist,
takes no,

375
00:23:46.941 --> 00:23:51.590
not noticed whatever of the public and that the public art to him,
nonexistent.

376
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.780
And it's very easy to say,

377
00:23:53.781 --> 00:23:57.110
especially for somebody as Wilde who was very prolific,
very public,

378
00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.900
almost performative in his public presence.

379
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:04.070
It's very easy to call this out as a kind of hypocrisy and say,
well,

380
00:24:04.071 --> 00:24:08.300
you can't possibly not care about the audience even you make your living through

381
00:24:08.301 --> 00:24:11.640
it and sort of perform to it.
Right.
But I,

382
00:24:11.641 --> 00:24:15.820
I think that's a pretty cynical interpretation.
I think rather than hypocrisy.

383
00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:20.840
It's just this very human struggle to be seen and to be understood,

384
00:24:21.141 --> 00:24:21.980
which is why

385
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:28.610
all art comes to be because one human being wants to put something in it to the

386
00:24:28.611 --> 00:24:32.600
world and to be understood for what he or she stands for and who he or she is.

387
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:38.210
And so with that Lens,
I do think it's hard to say,
well,
you know,

388
00:24:38.211 --> 00:24:40.550
I don't care about what happens to it out there,

389
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.060
even though I write for myself and think for myself,

390
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:48.230
the awareness of the other really does change things.

391
00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:53.560
But I think perhaps Werner Herzog put it best that I just finished reading this

392
00:24:54.681 --> 00:24:58.790
kind of 600 page,
um,
interview with him.

393
00:24:58.791 --> 00:25:02.720
Essentially it's a conversation that I'm a journalist named Paul Cronin had with

394
00:25:02.721 --> 00:25:05.940
him over the course of 30 years.
And in one passage,
um,

395
00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:10.490
Herzog says something like,
you know,
it's always been important for me to,

396
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:14.030
um,
have my films reach an audience.

397
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:19.190
I don't necessarily need to hear what those audience reactions are just as long

398
00:25:19.191 --> 00:25:21.290
as they're out there that they're touching.

399
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:25.280
The films are touching people in some way.
And I feel very similarly.

400
00:25:25.281 --> 00:25:29.660
So with that in mind,
I guess to answer your question,

401
00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:34.661
rather circuitously I don't feel quote unquote tempted to make listicles or to

402
00:25:36.231 --> 00:25:41.231
make anything that I feel compromises my experience of what I stand for and

403
00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:48.170
import.
I think the beauty of the web is that it's a self perfecting organism,

404
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.670
but for as long as it's an ad supported medium,

405
00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:57.080
the motive will be to perfect the commercial interest.
So perfect.

406
00:25:57.081 --> 00:25:59.990
The Art of the Buzzfeed Listicle,
the endless slide show,

407
00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:04.991
the infinitely paginated article and not perfect the human spirit of the reader

408
00:26:06.621 --> 00:26:09.260
or the writer,
which is really what I'm interested in.

409
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.100
<v 1>No,
it's a</v>

410
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:18.750
very virtuous goal.
I,
um,

411
00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:25.290
I really admire your site and obviously the newsletter and all these other

412
00:26:25.291 --> 00:26:29.530
aspects of it,
uh,
for a lot of reasons.
Uh,

413
00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.580
one of them is,
uh,
well I,

414
00:26:31.581 --> 00:26:36.581
I feel a very sort of kindred spirit with a lot of the decisions it seems you

415
00:26:36.931 --> 00:26:39.710
have made.
So for instance,
I mean not doing the,

416
00:26:39.711 --> 00:26:43.890
the slideshows to rack up page views for some type of advertising.

417
00:26:43.891 --> 00:26:45.240
That stuff drives me insane.

418
00:26:45.241 --> 00:26:48.730
So if it drives me insane and I assume it drives my readers insane,

419
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.560
so I'm not going to do it.
Or like you said,
yeah,

420
00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:55.810
<v 2>so wonderful that you do that because I think so much of that cultural crap that</v>

421
00:26:56.211 --> 00:26:58.430
is out there,
not just in the Internet,
just in general,

422
00:26:58.431 --> 00:27:02.390
comes from people who failed to understand that they should be making the kind

423
00:27:02.391 --> 00:27:05.000
of stuff they want to exist.
So if you're a writer,

424
00:27:05.001 --> 00:27:06.760
write the things you want to read.
If you're an artists,

425
00:27:06.761 --> 00:27:09.080
paint the things you want to pick me you want to see painted.

426
00:27:09.081 --> 00:27:13.730
And I think the commercial aspect is really warping that.

427
00:27:13.731 --> 00:27:14.810
And I really,

428
00:27:14.811 --> 00:27:18.920
one thing I really admire about your work in all of its permutations from your

429
00:27:18.921 --> 00:27:21.320
books too,
you know,
this podcast,
the say everything,

430
00:27:21.321 --> 00:27:26.000
is that there's just this sort of sense that you just want this to exist.

431
00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.360
It doesn't exist for any other reason than you want it to exist.

432
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:30.800
And I think that's wonderful.

433
00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:35.830
<v 1>Thank you.
That means a lot to me.
And I uh,</v>

434
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:41.420
you know,
coming back to the,
the right to please just one person.
It's,
I,

435
00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.230
I think that it's,
it's related to that.
So in a way it's,
you know,

436
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.930
put the things out into the world that you would want to

437
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:54.150
consume yourself or experienced yourself.
Number one.
Secondly,

438
00:27:54.151 --> 00:27:56.250
just for those people who,
who haven't,

439
00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.000
I heard this anecdote when I was reading the four hour workweek is my first
book.

440
00:28:00.001 --> 00:28:00.191
I've,

441
00:28:00.191 --> 00:28:04.650
I still to this day find writing very challenging and I wish I could say it's

442
00:28:04.651 --> 00:28:08.940
gotten easier over time,
but for whatever reason it seems not to have,

443
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:13.310
uh,
the,
in the case of the four hour work week,
I,
you know,

444
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:17.680
came out of Undergrad at Princeton and many,
many years have passed.
I'm asleep.

445
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:19.680
But when I wrote the first few chapters,

446
00:28:19.681 --> 00:28:23.280
it was really stilted and pompous and kind of Ivy League,
you know,

447
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:27.630
where I was trying to use $10 words where a 10 cent word would suffice and be a

448
00:28:27.631 --> 00:28:28.464
lot cleaner.

449
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:33.680
So I threw out the first few chapters that I drafted and this was a major panic

450
00:28:33.691 --> 00:28:36.430
attack moment.
I was on deadline.
And,
uh,

451
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:39.240
I remember I was in Argentina at the time.
Uh,

452
00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:42.540
and then I went the other way and I said,
no,
no,
no,
I have to be loose.

453
00:28:42.541 --> 00:28:47.270
I have to be funny.
And so I wrote a few chapters that were completely slapstick,

454
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.300
ridiculous.
I mean,
they,

455
00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:53.360
it sounded like three stooges put on paper and so I had to throw out those few

456
00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:58.730
chapters and of course I'm doubling down on my anxiety at this point and uh,

457
00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:03.150
decided at one point that I was just going to have a little bit of Yerba latte t

458
00:29:03.151 --> 00:29:07.140
two glasses of wine and no more than two glasses of mall back and sit down and

459
00:29:07.141 --> 00:29:11.010
start to write.
What is that?
Uh,
Malbeck is just this wonderful,

460
00:29:11.011 --> 00:29:15.540
versatile in South America,
uh,
best known in Argentina,

461
00:29:15.541 --> 00:29:20.010
but there are actually some really nice malbeck wines in Chile.

462
00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:22.470
They were,
as I understand it,

463
00:29:22.471 --> 00:29:25.500
it was viewed almost as a garbage grape in Europe,

464
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:30.570
but it was brought by the Italians to winnow side days and has developed this

465
00:29:30.571 --> 00:29:35.220
worldwide fame because of its cultivation in Argentina.
So there's,

466
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:39.150
there's a lot of sort of,
there's a lot of metaphor there.
Then I also like,

467
00:29:39.151 --> 00:29:41.380
but drink two glasses of wine,

468
00:29:41.381 --> 00:29:46.381
sat down and literally opened up an e an email client and started typing the

469
00:29:47.741 --> 00:29:51.850
four hour work week as if I were writing it to two of my closest friends.
Uh,

470
00:29:51.851 --> 00:29:53.650
one was,
uh,

471
00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.860
an investment banker trapped in his own job and he felt like he couldn't leave

472
00:29:56.861 --> 00:29:59.500
because his lifestyle was swelling to meet his income.

473
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:03.580
And then the other was an entrepreneur sort of trapped in a company of his own

474
00:30:03.581 --> 00:30:06.460
making.
And so these two very specific guys in mind,

475
00:30:06.461 --> 00:30:11.080
I started to write with just enough alcohol to dissertate the edge off.

476
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.880
And that's how,
uh,
the,
I was writing in that case to please just two people.
Uh,

477
00:30:15.881 --> 00:30:20.260
but that's,
that's the only way I could make it work.
Uh,
the,

478
00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.490
uh,
your schedule.
So I've,
I,

479
00:30:24.491 --> 00:30:27.690
I've read of your schedule,
uh,
but I,

480
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:32.480
I'd love to hear the current iteration of that.
It seems like you,

481
00:30:32.481 --> 00:30:36.130
you've had a fairly,
you have a fairly regimented schedule,

482
00:30:36.131 --> 00:30:38.050
which would make sense if you're putting the number of,

483
00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.350
of hours into reading and writing that you do.
So what is,

484
00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:43.210
what is your current day look like?

485
00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.920
<v 2>Well,
I'll answer this with a caveat.</v>

486
00:30:46.921 --> 00:30:51.921
The one thing I have struggled with or tried to solve for myself in the last few

487
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:55.320
years,
couple of years maybe as the student,

488
00:30:55.321 --> 00:31:00.321
really delicate balance between productivity and presence and especially in a

489
00:31:00.751 --> 00:31:05.751
culture that seems to measure our worth or marriage or value through our

490
00:31:08.641 --> 00:31:13.260
efficiency and our earnings and our ability to perform certain tasks as opposed

491
00:31:13.261 --> 00:31:14.094
to

492
00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:18.360
just the fulfillment we feel in their own lives.

493
00:31:18.361 --> 00:31:22.200
And the present is that we take in in the day to day.

494
00:31:22.201 --> 00:31:25.110
And that's something that's like a more and more apparent to me.

495
00:31:25.111 --> 00:31:30.111
So I'm a little bit reluctant to discuss routine as some sort of holy grail of

496
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:35.190
creative process because it's just really,
it's a crutch.

497
00:31:35.191 --> 00:31:37.040
I mean routines and rituals help us.

498
00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:38.383
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

499
00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:43.750
<v 2>Not feel like this overwhelming messiness of just day to day life with</v>

500
00:31:43.751 --> 00:31:48.340
consumers.
It's a control mechanism,
but that's not all there is.
And if anything,

501
00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:50.590
it should be in the service of something greater,

502
00:31:50.591 --> 00:31:55.330
which is being present with one's own life.
So with that in mind,

503
00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.540
my day is very predictable.
Um,

504
00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:00.820
I get up in the morning,

505
00:32:00.821 --> 00:32:04.990
I meditate between 15 to 25 minutes before I do anything else.

506
00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:07.080
<v 1>What time do you wake up typically</v>

507
00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:12.340
<v 2>exactly eight hours after I've gone to bed.
So it varies.
Okay.
Um,</v>

508
00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:16.690
I'm a huge proponent of sleep.
I think,
um,

509
00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.240
I,
when I write because what,
or when,

510
00:32:21.241 --> 00:32:25.470
I guess tried to think what I do is essentially make associations between

511
00:32:25.471 --> 00:32:29.130
seemingly unrelated ideas and concepts.

512
00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:31.500
And in order for that to happen,
you know,

513
00:32:31.501 --> 00:32:35.310
those associative chains need to be firing.
And when I am sleep deprived,

514
00:32:35.311 --> 00:32:38.590
I feel like I don't have full access to my own brain.
Um,

515
00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.300
which certainly I'm not unique in that in any way.

516
00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:46.040
There's research showing that the are reflexes are severely hindered by lack of

517
00:32:46.041 --> 00:32:50.570
sleep were almost as drunk if if we sleep less than half the amount of time when

518
00:32:50.571 --> 00:32:53.060
normally need to function.
And I think

519
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:57.700
ours is a culture where we,
where we,
um,

520
00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:02.750
where our ability to get by on very little sleep as a kind of badge honor badge

521
00:33:02.751 --> 00:33:06.890
of honor,
the speaks work ethic or toughness or whatever it is,

522
00:33:06.891 --> 00:33:11.891
but really it's a total profound failure of priorities and have self respect.

523
00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:18.670
And I tried to sort of enact that in my own life by being very disciplined about

524
00:33:19.851 --> 00:33:23.150
my sleep,
at least a disciplined as about as I am about my work.

525
00:33:23.151 --> 00:33:27.170
Because the latter is a product of the capacities,
you know,

526
00:33:27.171 --> 00:33:29.840
cultivated by the former.
Um,
so in any case,

527
00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:34.190
so I get up eight hours after I have gone to bed,
I meditate.

528
00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:38.210
Um,
I go to the gym where I do most of my,
um,

529
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:43.220
longer form reading.
Uh,
I get back home,

530
00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:44.930
I had breakfast and I start writing.

531
00:33:44.931 --> 00:33:49.931
I usually write between two and three articles a day and one of them tends to be

532
00:33:49.971 --> 00:33:53.960
longer.
And when I write,
I need uninterrupted time.

533
00:33:53.961 --> 00:33:58.961
So I try to get the longer one done earlier on in the day when I feel much more

534
00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:04.780
alert.
Um,
so I don't look at email or any,

535
00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:09.620
anything really external to the material I'm,
I'm dealing with,

536
00:34:09.621 --> 00:34:11.810
which does require quite a bit of research usually.

537
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:15.980
So it's not like I can cut myself off from the internet or from other books,
but,

538
00:34:15.981 --> 00:34:20.510
uh,
I don't have people disruptions I guess.
So anything social.

539
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.020
Um,
and then I take a short break.

540
00:34:24.021 --> 00:34:26.900
I'm a believer in sort of pacing,
um,

541
00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:31.010
creating a sort of rhythm where you do very intense focused work for an extended

542
00:34:31.011 --> 00:34:35.130
period and then you take a short break and then cycle back,
you know?
Um,

543
00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:40.140
and then I deal with any sort of admin stuff like emails and just taking care of

544
00:34:41.721 --> 00:34:42.650
errands and whatnot.

545
00:34:42.651 --> 00:34:47.651
And I resume writing and I write my other article or articles through the

546
00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:54.290
evening.
I try to have,
um,
some private time,
um,

547
00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.280
just later in the day,
either with friends or with my partner or just,
you know,

548
00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:03.530
time that is unburdened by deliberate thought.
Oh,

549
00:35:03.531 --> 00:35:06.500
though you can never unburden yourself from thought and general.

550
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:11.300
And then usually later at night I either do some more reading or some more

551
00:35:11.301 --> 00:35:13.160
writing or a combination of the two.

552
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.140
<v 1>Got It.
And so a number of follow up questions.</v>

553
00:35:18.141 --> 00:35:21.110
What type of meditation do you practice currently?

554
00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:26.650
<v 2>Just guided Vipassana.
Very,
very basic.
Um,</v>

555
00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:31.600
there's a woman named Tara Brock who,
um,
she's a mindfulness practitioner.

556
00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:35.390
B R,
a,
c h.
Got it.

557
00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.570
And she's based out of DC and she,
um,

558
00:35:39.571 --> 00:35:44.571
was trained as a cognitive psychologist then the decades of Buddhist training

559
00:35:44.611 --> 00:35:49.260
and,
and lived in an Ashram and now she teaches mindfulness has been with a very

560
00:35:49.261 --> 00:35:54.120
secular lens.
So,
um,
she records her classes and she has a podcast,

561
00:35:54.121 --> 00:35:57.330
which is how I came to know her.

562
00:35:57.331 --> 00:36:01.800
And every week she does a one hour lecture and sort of the philosophies and

563
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:05.160
cognitive behavioral,
you know,

564
00:36:05.161 --> 00:36:09.900
wisdom of the ages and then she does a guided meditation.
Um,
so I,

565
00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:14.901
I used her meditations and she has changed my life perhaps more profoundly than

566
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:20.290
anybody in my life.
So I tried to be highly recommend her.
Um,

567
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:24.080
Tara Brock,
Brock,
yes.
And all her,

568
00:36:24.081 --> 00:36:28.080
her podcast is free.
Um,
she has two books out to,
um,

569
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.750
she's really wonderful,
very generous person.

570
00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.270
<v 1>I'll have to check that out.</v>

571
00:36:32.271 --> 00:36:36.950
And a c you're listening then you have earbuds in when you are doing or you're

572
00:36:36.951 --> 00:36:39.050
listening,
you're listening to audio while you meditate.

573
00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:43.530
<v 2>Yes.
And it's interestingly,
I mean she puts one out every week,</v>

574
00:36:43.531 --> 00:36:47.760
but I've been using the exact same one from the summer of 2010.

575
00:36:47.761 --> 00:36:51.870
It's just one that I like and feel familiar with and it sort of helps me get

576
00:36:51.871 --> 00:36:53.950
into the rhythm.
So everyday I listened to the right

577
00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:59.110
<v 1>2010.
How does that start?
How would people recognize it?
How does the audio</v>

578
00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:02.970
<v 2>tidal is,
it sounds cheesy but it is not cheesy.</v>

579
00:37:02.971 --> 00:37:05.740
I think it's called smile meditation.
Uh,

580
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:09.840
and I'm sure she has repeated it in various forms through the years.

581
00:37:09.841 --> 00:37:12.870
In other recordings,
you just happens to be the one that I,
you know,

582
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.430
have on and on.

583
00:37:14.431 --> 00:37:19.230
My broken three g iPhone without any internet or cell service,

584
00:37:19.231 --> 00:37:20.730
which I just use as an iPod.

585
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:27.360
<v 1>Awesome.
That's great answer.
Um,
God a love.
I love digging into the specifics.</v>

586
00:37:27.361 --> 00:37:31.860
And when you go to the gym then,
uh,
to workout,

587
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:36.660
are you still using an elliptical for that or are you,
are

588
00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:40.400
<v 2>I do sprints,
time testing,
intervals on the elliptical.</v>

589
00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:44.900
And Are you getting your cardio and I do a lot of weights and body weight stuff

590
00:37:44.901 --> 00:37:45.260
too.

591
00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:49.960
<v 1>You do?
All right.
But when you're reading,
is that on the elliptical?
Yes.</v>

592
00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:54.230
And what type of a device,
if any,

593
00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.480
are you using for that reading?

594
00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.550
<v 2>Well I prefer electronic,</v>

595
00:37:59.551 --> 00:38:04.551
so I use the kindle app on the Ipad or any pdf viewer cause I read a lot of

596
00:38:04.651 --> 00:38:07.500
archival stuff.
But the challenge of course with it,

597
00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:11.640
because I read so many older books that are out of print,

598
00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.950
let alone having digital versions,

599
00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:18.870
that's not always possible in case it's rarely possible unless I'm writing about

600
00:38:18.871 --> 00:38:20.310
something fairly new.

601
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:25.650
And so in that case I just go there with my big Tome and my sticky notes and

602
00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:29.550
pens and sharpies and areas,
annotation,

603
00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:32.460
analog devices and I just do that.

604
00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:36.490
<v 1>Cool.
All right.
So that leads perfectly into the next question,</v>

605
00:38:36.491 --> 00:38:40.870
which is what is your note taking system?
Look like and how do you take notes?

606
00:38:40.871 --> 00:38:42.770
So for instance,
uh,

607
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:47.970
you're really good at using excerpts or quotations,

608
00:38:48.941 --> 00:38:53.430
pull quotes.
And I found myself asking as I was reading this,
like how,

609
00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:57.990
how are you gathering all of this so that you can use it later.
Um,

610
00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:02.890
so what is your note taking system look like when you see in the case of digital

611
00:39:02.891 --> 00:39:04.640
and in the case of hard copy?

612
00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:08.920
<v 2>Yeah,
so when digital,
um,
it's very simple.</v>

613
00:39:08.921 --> 00:39:13.921
I just highlight passages and I write myself little notes underneath each year,

614
00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.370
um,
that are,

615
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:20.670
that have acronyms that I use frequently for certain topics or shorthand that I

616
00:39:20.741 --> 00:39:24.010
have developed for myself.
Uh,
but reading is really,

617
00:39:24.011 --> 00:39:28.000
or understanding really is below in reading should be a conduit to,

618
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.480
is a form of pattern recognition.
So when you read a whole book,

619
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:35.910
you kind of walk away with certain takeaways that are thematically linked and

620
00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.530
they don't usually occur sequentially.

621
00:39:38.531 --> 00:39:41.470
So it's not like you walk away with one in section one,

622
00:39:41.471 --> 00:39:43.420
the first chapter one is it from the second chapter.

623
00:39:43.421 --> 00:39:48.421
It's just sort of this pattern of the writers thoughts that,

624
00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:51.880
that,
that permeated the entire narrative of the book.
And so,

625
00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:56.380
especially as you,
if you read as a writer,

626
00:39:56.381 --> 00:39:59.860
so somebody who not only needs to walk away with that but ideally wants to

627
00:39:59.861 --> 00:40:02.650
record what those patterns and themes are.

628
00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:05.020
That sort of reading is very different.

629
00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:09.610
And so what I end up doing with analog books in particular,

630
00:40:09.611 --> 00:40:12.970
and it's sort of hacked him systems of doing it electronically but they're

631
00:40:12.971 --> 00:40:17.710
imperfect,
is add on the very last page of Ad Age book,

632
00:40:17.711 --> 00:40:21.430
which is blank usually right before the end cover,

633
00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:25.060
I create,
uh,
an alternate index.

634
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:30.090
So I basically list out as I'm reading the topics and ideas that that seemed to

635
00:40:31.031 --> 00:40:33.640
be important and recurring in that volume.

636
00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:37.660
And then next to each of them I start listing out the page numbers where they

637
00:40:37.661 --> 00:40:38.200
occur.

638
00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:41.890
And on those pages I obviously highlighted the respective passage and they have

639
00:40:41.891 --> 00:40:45.640
a little sort of sticky tab on the side so I can find it.
Um,

640
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:48.790
but it's basically a,
an index based,

641
00:40:48.791 --> 00:40:53.080
not on keywords,
which is what a standard book index is based on,

642
00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:55.750
but based on key ideas.

643
00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:01.200
And I use that then to sort of synthesize what those ideas are once I'm ready to

644
00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:02.650
write about the book.

645
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:06.050
<v 1>Okay.
I have to geek out on this because I'm so excited now.</v>

646
00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.650
So is it turns out with analog books,

647
00:41:09.651 --> 00:41:12.350
I do exactly literally exactly the same thing.

648
00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:14.870
I usually start with the in front inside cover,

649
00:41:14.871 --> 00:41:18.050
but I create my own index and of course they don't have to be an order.

650
00:41:18.051 --> 00:41:22.640
So you can sort of list them in any way in my particular case,
in any,
any order.

651
00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:26.900
Um,
I also will have sort of a to

652
00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:33.610
a couple of have lines dedicated to Ph and ph just refers to phrasing if I find

653
00:41:33.771 --> 00:41:36.180
a turn of phrase or wording that I find really great.

654
00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:37.143
<v 2>Do that.</v>

655
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:38.910
<v 1>Oh,
really?
Okay.</v>

656
00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:40.850
<v 2>B L for beautiful links.</v>

657
00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:45.570
<v 1>Oh,
that's so cool.
Okay.
So there's that.
And then I have,</v>

658
00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:46.493
um,

659
00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:48.170
<v 2>uh,</v>

660
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:52.100
<v 1>you know,
like Q or Q if I,
if their quotes.
So,
for instance,</v>

661
00:41:52.101 --> 00:41:57.101
many books will have quotes attributed to other people or just Hetero quotes,

662
00:41:57.750 --> 00:42:02.030
uh,
in some cases.
And so I'll have,
um,
you know,
quotes all,
just write that out.

663
00:42:02.031 --> 00:42:03.140
And then colon and then I'll,

664
00:42:03.141 --> 00:42:07.940
I'll list all the page numbers for that particular sort of category that I'm

665
00:42:07.941 --> 00:42:12.050
collecting in the case of quotes.
So for when you're gathering this,

666
00:42:12.051 --> 00:42:16.670
you mentioned acronyms and a shorthand.
So besides beautiful language,

667
00:42:16.671 --> 00:42:18.890
what are some of the other acronyms that you use?

668
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.220
<v 2>Oh,
they wouldn't make that.
They're just very private.</v>

669
00:42:22.221 --> 00:42:25.040
It's like too long to get into what they stand for.

670
00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:30.830
<v 1>Is there one other example that you just,
just,
if you could indulge me?</v>

671
00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.271
<v 2>One that is,</v>

672
00:42:32.271 --> 00:42:37.030
I guess not so much about the contents of that passage as it,

673
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:40.070
as about its purpose is LJ,
which is,

674
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:44.680
I have a little sort of labor of love side project called litter and jukebox.

675
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.160
Right?

676
00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.920
<v 1>Sure.
I've seen it.
It's,
yeah,
it's,
it's awesome.</v>

677
00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.300
<v 2>Oh,
thank you.
But yeah,</v>

678
00:42:49.301 --> 00:42:53.980
so I do these pairings of passages from literature with at the magically matched

679
00:42:53.981 --> 00:42:57.700
song.
And so sometimes when as I'm reading a book,

680
00:42:57.701 --> 00:43:01.450
I would come across a passage that I think would be great for that and maybe a

681
00:43:01.451 --> 00:43:04.900
song comes to mind and so I would put LJ next to,

682
00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:08.500
but I want to go back to what you said about the external quotes.

683
00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:11.560
I guess the author quoting another work.

684
00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:15.370
I think those are actually really important and that goes back to your question

685
00:43:15.371 --> 00:43:20.371
about how I find what to read and I mark those types of things.

686
00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:22.690
So for the,

687
00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:26.830
for the annotations that are specific to that particular book,

688
00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:31.720
all of my sticky tab notes are on the side of the,
of the pages.

689
00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:35.860
But when there's an external quotes,
something referencing another work,

690
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:40.360
I put a tab at the very top with the letterF ,
which stands for find.

691
00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:44.140
If I am not with the word the work or just no letter.

692
00:43:44.141 --> 00:43:47.080
If I just want to flag a from something else that I know of.

693
00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:52.060
And I think that's actually very important because
the,
the,

694
00:43:52.061 --> 00:43:56.710
the phenomenon itself,
not my annotations of it,
because literature is really,

695
00:43:56.711 --> 00:43:59.470
and I say this all the time,
it is the original Internet.

696
00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:04.770
So all of those references and citations and illusions,

697
00:44:05.121 --> 00:44:05.501
even,

698
00:44:05.501 --> 00:44:10.300
they're essentially hyperlinks that that author placed to another work.

699
00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:14.860
Um,
and that way if you follow those,

700
00:44:14.861 --> 00:44:19.660
you go into this magnificent rabbit hole where you start out with something that

701
00:44:19.661 --> 00:44:21.490
you're already enjoying and liking,

702
00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:26.470
but follow these tangential references to other works that perhaps you would not

703
00:44:26.471 --> 00:44:28.770
have come across that way.
Uh,

704
00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:33.840
I mean directly and in a way it's a way to push oneself out of the filter bubble

705
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:37.290
in a very incremental way.

706
00:44:37.291 --> 00:44:41.730
And I've often found amazing older books that were,
you know,

707
00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:46.230
five or six hyperlink reference says removed from something I was reading,

708
00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.120
which led me to something else or something,
make something else,

709
00:44:48.121 --> 00:44:51.300
which led me to this great other thing.
Um,
so I think that's,

710
00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:53.580
that's kind of a beautiful practice.

711
00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:55.350
<v 1>Yeah,
it's a,
the,</v>

712
00:44:55.351 --> 00:45:00.351
the serendipity of it is so beautiful when it works out.

713
00:45:00.371 --> 00:45:05.200
And I'll,
I'll,
I'll,
uh,
give a confession.
This is really embarrassing,

714
00:45:05.201 --> 00:45:08.580
but you know,
since you know,
is listening.
Uh,

715
00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:13.720
I came across Seneca Seneca,

716
00:45:13.721 --> 00:45:18.721
the younger who's had probably more impact on my life than any other writer.

717
00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:24.010
Uh,
it originally,
because there I,

718
00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:25.570
I was perusing it,

719
00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:30.830
a number of anthologies on minimalism and simplicity and Seneca kept on popping

720
00:45:31.271 --> 00:45:33.820
up,
quote Seneca,
quote,
Seneca.

721
00:45:33.821 --> 00:45:38.640
And because it was always one word like Madonna
or,

722
00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.710
and this is going to be really embarrassing,
or like sitting bull,

723
00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:46.740
I assumed that Seneca was a native American elder of some type for probably a

724
00:45:47.351 --> 00:45:48.170
good,

725
00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:49.003
<v 2>well,
yeah,</v>

726
00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:54.200
<v 1>I assumed he was a native American elder for a probably a good year or two</v>

727
00:45:54.201 --> 00:45:57.920
before I realized he was a Roman.
I was like,
man,
Ferris,

728
00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:01.730
you gotta do your homework pal,
like,
get to dig in.

729
00:46:01.731 --> 00:46:06.731
And then at that point is when I really sort of jumped off the cliff into all a

730
00:46:06.801 --> 00:46:11.630
lot of his writings,
which I've,
I still to this day revisit on an almost

731
00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:16.900
<v 2>revisited,
um,
his,
um,
the shortness of life.</v>

732
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:17.870
<v 1>Oh,
so good.</v>

733
00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:20.880
<v 2>So is this perhaps the best manifesto?</v>

734
00:46:20.881 --> 00:46:24.750
And I hadn't had this modern word,
um,
sort of buzz word,

735
00:46:24.751 --> 00:46:25.950
but I use it intentionally.

736
00:46:25.951 --> 00:46:30.951
So the best manifesto for our current struggle with this very notion of,

737
00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:31.861
you know,

738
00:46:31.861 --> 00:46:36.861
productivity versus presence and how much are we really mistaking the doing for

739
00:46:37.771 --> 00:46:39.390
the being,
you know,
and,
and,

740
00:46:39.391 --> 00:46:44.100
and it's amazing that somebody wrote this millennia ago before there was

741
00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:47.970
internet before there was the things we call distractions today.

742
00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:52.320
And yet he writes about the exact same things just in a different form.

743
00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:53.520
Yeah.

744
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:55.860
<v 1>The exact same things.
And the way that,
uh,</v>

745
00:46:55.861 --> 00:46:59.310
if I'm trying to use Seneca is a gateway drug into philosophy.

746
00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:04.290
I won't use the P word first of all with most people because philosophy smacks

747
00:47:04.291 --> 00:47:07.380
of,
I think it calls to mind for a lot of people.

748
00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:12.330
The hottie pompous,
uh,
college student in,

749
00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:17.220
um,
uh,
goodwill hunting in the bar scene,

750
00:47:17.221 --> 00:47:21.810
who's like reciting,
you know,
Shakespeare without giving,
uh,
any type of

751
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.700
<v 2>completely disagree.
No,</v>

752
00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:28.490
I agree with the notion that those are its connotations today and people have a

753
00:47:28.491 --> 00:47:32.950
resistance.
I think that's all the more reason to use it heavily and to use it

754
00:47:32.951 --> 00:47:37.180
intelligently.
And to reclaim it and to get people to understand that philosophy,

755
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:41.110
whatever form it takes is the only way to figure out how to live.

756
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:46.240
Everything else that we take away from anything is a set of philosophies

757
00:47:46.241 --> 00:47:47.074
essentially.

758
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:51.970
<v 1>I agree.
No,
I totally agree.
So,
but I usually,
if I'm going to lead people there,</v>

759
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:55.770
I try to,
to,
to lure them.

760
00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:59.110
You are the man with,
with Seneca because I think he's,

761
00:47:59.111 --> 00:48:03.410
he's very easy to read compared to a lot of st least the Stoics,
uh,
or,

762
00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:06.490
or that's actually not even fair compared to a lot of philosophers who,

763
00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.230
who had been translated from Greek.

764
00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:11.470
Most of his writing and believe is translated from Latin,

765
00:48:11.471 --> 00:48:14.740
which tends to be just an easier jump from English.
So,
um,

766
00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:18.160
it's very easy to read night.
What I tell people is,
you know,

767
00:48:18.161 --> 00:48:21.490
start off with some of his letters and you'll find that you could just as easily

768
00:48:21.491 --> 00:48:26.491
replace these Roman names like Luke Ileus and s and so on with like Bob and Jane

769
00:48:29.891 --> 00:48:34.770
are,
you know,
pick your contemporary name if a of choice and it,

770
00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:39.640
they're all as relevant now as they were then.
Um,
so I,

771
00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:43.450
I'm going to come back to the sort of performance versus presence,

772
00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:48.430
which I think of oftentimes as the sister of achievement versus appreciation,

773
00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:53.350
uh,
split or balance or maybe neither.

774
00:48:53.351 --> 00:48:56.890
But before we get there,
I want to put a,

775
00:48:57.250 --> 00:49:01.570
put a bow on the note taking with your electronic note taking.

776
00:49:01.571 --> 00:49:03.640
So you're using the kindle APP,
you're taking highlights.

777
00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:07.210
Where do you go from there?
Are there any other,
what is,

778
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:11.290
what is the sort of workflow look like from there?
And are there any,
any,
uh,

779
00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:16.480
particular types of software or apps or anything like that that you use often?

780
00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:18.260
<v 2>I mean,
honestly,</v>

781
00:49:18.261 --> 00:49:22.790
I feel like that problem has not been solved at all in any kind of practical
way.

782
00:49:22.791 --> 00:49:27.290
So the way that I do it as basically a bunch of hacks using existing

783
00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:31.280
technologies,
but I don't think,
or perhaps I'm just unaware,

784
00:49:31.281 --> 00:49:36.281
but I don't think there's anybody designing tools today for people who do

785
00:49:36.681 --> 00:49:38.090
serious heavy reading.

786
00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:42.620
There just isn't anything that I know and see what I do is I highlight in the,

787
00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:47.420
in the kindle app on the Ipad,
um,
and then,
um,

788
00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:48.620
Amazon has this function.

789
00:49:48.621 --> 00:49:53.621
Then you can basically see your kindle notes and highlights on the desktop or on

790
00:49:55.101 --> 00:49:57.320
your computer.
I go to those,

791
00:49:57.410 --> 00:50:02.390
I copy them from that page and I pays them into an Evernote file,
um,

792
00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:06.980
to sort of just have all of all of my notes in a specific book in one place.

793
00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:09.830
But sometimes I would also,
um,

794
00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:13.730
take a screen grab of a specific iPad,

795
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:18.760
kindle app and kindle page with my highlighted passage and then email that

796
00:50:18.761 --> 00:50:23.630
screen grab into my Evernote email because Evernote has,
as you know,

797
00:50:23.631 --> 00:50:27.500
optical character recognition.
So right when I searched it,

798
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:30.290
it's also going to search the text in that image.

799
00:50:30.291 --> 00:50:33.380
I don't have to wait until I finish the book and explored all my notes.
And,

800
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:38.030
and also it's,
the formatting is kind of shitty on the,

801
00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:42.500
on the kindle notes on the desktop,
we can see all your notes.

802
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:43.970
So if you copy them,

803
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:48.110
they paste it into Evernote with this really weird formatting.
Uh,

804
00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:52.760
so it tabulate each next notes in dented to the right.

805
00:50:52.761 --> 00:50:57.761
So it's sort of this cascading long cascading thing that shifts more and more to

806
00:50:58.341 --> 00:51:01.610
the right.
Right.
Moved down.
Horrible.
It's like an email thread.

807
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:05.760
It's like an email thread except there's no actual hires.
You,
these are all,

808
00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:07.890
you know,
and so if you want to go fix it,

809
00:51:07.891 --> 00:51:12.240
you have to do it manually within Evernote.
And you know,
I read,
you know,

810
00:51:12.241 --> 00:51:15.480
on on the Verner Herzog books for example,
which is 600 pages,

811
00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:17.460
I have thousands of notes.

812
00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:22.470
So imagine thousands of tabulations until the last one is so narrow and long

813
00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:24.390
that it's just like unreadable.

814
00:51:24.391 --> 00:51:29.310
So hence my point about just there is no viable solutions that I know.

815
00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:33.050
<v 1>Got It.
Okay.
So let me just,
because I,
I,</v>

816
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:35.470
this may or may not help for me,

817
00:51:35.471 --> 00:51:40.471
it was a huge shift in how I manage Evernote because that may mean I'm looking

818
00:51:41.681 --> 00:51:43.620
at this list of questions.
Um,

819
00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:47.260
and I'm not reading entirely offset on script,

820
00:51:47.261 --> 00:51:50.770
but I have a collection of questions in Evernote right now.
And one,

821
00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:55.860
one of the things I realized about formatting and transposing things from say

822
00:51:56.410 --> 00:51:59.400
the,
you know,
my kindle page,
if you,
if you log into your,

823
00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:04.530
your Amazon account through kindle.amazon.com or I'm copying pasting from many

824
00:52:06.701 --> 00:52:09.640
different places is going to,
I don't know if you've tried this,

825
00:52:09.641 --> 00:52:14.641
but edit and either paste and match style or paste as plain text and it tends to

826
00:52:14.831 --> 00:52:19.820
remove all of that headache.
Um,
let's see,
nine times out of 10.
So if you,
yeah,

827
00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:23.010
<v 2>if you have a problem with that,
I did try that once.</v>

828
00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:25.620
But when you remove the style,

829
00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:28.450
it makes all the metadata look the same as the tech.

830
00:52:28.451 --> 00:52:33.210
So I may be highlighted passage.
I also have my own notes.
I see.
Got It.
Plus,

831
00:52:33.211 --> 00:52:37.590
plus,
you know,
Amazon's own thing that says add note,
read,

832
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:41.910
redid this location.
And so it all merges it and become just hideous.

833
00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:43.350
It's just an awful today.

834
00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:45.770
<v 1>No,
I wonder,
I wonder what to do there.
Yeah,</v>

835
00:52:45.771 --> 00:52:50.000
I used to take notes and drop them into text wrangler,

836
00:52:50.001 --> 00:52:53.300
which is used for coding a lot just to remove the formatting and then put it

837
00:52:53.301 --> 00:52:53.890
into every,

838
00:52:53.890 --> 00:52:57.550
<v 2>yeah,
I do that with Cota.
Yeah.
Yeah,
it's true though.</v>

839
00:52:57.551 --> 00:53:01.910
There there's gotta be a solution.
And the thing is Evernote.
I love it.
Evernote,

840
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.270
I've been using it so many years and I could probably not get through my day

841
00:53:05.271 --> 00:53:09.520
without it,
but it hasn't Api,
which means somebody can build this,
you know,

842
00:53:09.521 --> 00:53:12.570
in a sure way to like,
I even thought,
I mean,

843
00:53:12.571 --> 00:53:16.660
I was at one point so desperate and so frustrated,
which I think is the,

844
00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:21.560
you that causes all innovation,
you know,
desperation and frustration.

845
00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:26.110
I thought maybe I should just save up some and offer,
uh,

846
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:31.140
like a scholars or like a grand for a hackathon for somebody to solve this for

847
00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:34.030
me.
You know,
that's a great idea.
I mean,
I,

848
00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:36.870
I'm still sort of contemplating that.

849
00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:39.650
<v 1>Okay.
We'll,
we'll,
we'll talk about that separately.</v>

850
00:53:39.651 --> 00:53:43.010
I think that's something that we could absolutely explore it for all of you

851
00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:45.830
programmers,
coders out there,
please take a look.

852
00:53:45.831 --> 00:53:48.770
This is actually not as rare issues you might expect.

853
00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:52.730
One question for you on the kindle highlights,
uh,
because I've run into this,

854
00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:55.840
you mentioned the Werner Hertzog book and having,
you know,

855
00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:59.180
thousands of of highlights I've have,

856
00:53:59.181 --> 00:54:03.710
you run into instances where your,
you're reading an entire book,

857
00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:06.020
you're super impressed or not,

858
00:54:06.021 --> 00:54:10.370
but regardless you have hundreds of highlights and you go to look at those

859
00:54:10.371 --> 00:54:14.330
highlights and you're restricted to only see,
yeah,

860
00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:18.180
<v 2>the Fred like 200 highlights,
81 available.</v>

861
00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:21.130
<v 1>Right?
So how often does that happen to you?</v>

862
00:54:21.131 --> 00:54:25.060
Because that's happened to me where I've taken so much time to meticulously

863
00:54:25.061 --> 00:54:29.800
highlight stuff and then I'm only able to see a 25% and it's so infuriating.

864
00:54:29.801 --> 00:54:33.090
And I think it's a limitation that is determined by the publisher.
Yes,

865
00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:36.530
<v 2>it is.
And so I'll tell you why.
It hasn't happened to me much.</v>

866
00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.910
It happens to me occasionally,
but that's a DRM saying digital,
sorry,

867
00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:44.880
listeners who don't like acronyms,
digital rights management,
uh,

868
00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:47.840
thing that has,
that is fairly new.

869
00:54:47.841 --> 00:54:52.100
So that is the case more recently published books,
right?
But if you read,

870
00:54:52.101 --> 00:54:55.130
you know,
the digitized version of say,
you know Alan Watts,

871
00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:58.310
it was published originally 40 years ago.

872
00:54:58.790 --> 00:55:03.110
There's no such problem unless the publisher now is like reclaiming rice and

873
00:55:03.111 --> 00:55:04.280
doing a whole new thing.

874
00:55:04.281 --> 00:55:09.281
But because I read so much less out of sort of newly published material,

875
00:55:11.331 --> 00:55:13.190
I don't run into it often,
but you know,

876
00:55:13.191 --> 00:55:17.720
there is a way to very laboriously,

877
00:55:17.721 --> 00:55:18.890
you know,
deal with it,

878
00:55:18.891 --> 00:55:23.891
which is you can still open that passage in your kindle app on desktop.

879
00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:29.520
So kindle for Mac for me and it will let you highlight and copy those passages,

880
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:33.530
paste them into your Evernote in between the missing courts.

881
00:55:33.531 --> 00:55:35.420
But it's obviously the Nazis.

882
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.930
<v 1>I have done that and it's so horrible because you also get the like excerpted</v>

883
00:55:40.931 --> 00:55:44.710
from Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
like three lines,
everyone.
So just publishers,

884
00:55:44.711 --> 00:55:45.850
if you're listening to this,

885
00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:49.870
you are making it harder for people like Maria.

886
00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:54.880
If 7 million uniques per month to share your stuff.

887
00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:58.540
So pleased up your threshold.
Uh,

888
00:55:59.180 --> 00:55:59.510
<v 2>okay.</v>

889
00:55:59.510 --> 00:56:04.130
<v 1>Do you have anybody helping you with brainpickings or is it just you?</v>

890
00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:08.020
<v 2>Um,
the actual reading and writing,
obviously it's just me,</v>

891
00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:11.770
but as of about 10 months ago,

892
00:56:11.771 --> 00:56:13.660
I have an assistant Lisa,

893
00:56:13.661 --> 00:56:18.220
who's absolutely wonderful when she just helps me with admin stuff that has to

894
00:56:18.221 --> 00:56:23.221
do with my travel or email or scheduling things that I feel is weighing me down

895
00:56:27.221 --> 00:56:27.791
so much.

896
00:56:27.791 --> 00:56:32.070
I operate so much out of a sense of guilt for sort of letting people down or,

897
00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.610
and as you know,

898
00:56:33.611 --> 00:56:38.611
I'm sure when you get to a point where the demands are just incomparable with

899
00:56:39.281 --> 00:56:41.530
what you can even look at,

900
00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:46.510
then you kind of need to have help in order to not to either go insane or live

901
00:56:46.511 --> 00:56:49.680
with a constant guilt over not addressing things.
So,

902
00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:51.970
<v 1>and was there a particular,</v>

903
00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:54.580
<v 2>oh,
and I also have a copy editor.</v>

904
00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:59.380
This wonderful older lady I hired to do my proofreading.
Um,

905
00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:03.400
she's great.
I am,
that's all I can say.
I think proofreading is really,

906
00:57:03.401 --> 00:57:07.930
really important and I'm constantly embarrassed if I have a Typo,
which you know,

907
00:57:07.931 --> 00:57:10.930
as you know,
as a writer you cannot prove your own work.

908
00:57:11.070 --> 00:57:12.750
Just your brain just does not see any

909
00:57:12.830 --> 00:57:17.690
<v 1>errors that we've made in the first place.
What were the majority of them?
And so</v>

910
00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:19.820
<v 2>people are kind of mercy,
Lowe's,</v>

911
00:57:19.830 --> 00:57:24.830
they think somehow that a typo makes you lazy or I hadn't even know.

912
00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:31.860
There's no kind of compassion for the humanity that produces something as human

913
00:57:31.861 --> 00:57:35.340
as a Typo.
Right.
Despite how mechanical the term itself seems,

914
00:57:35.341 --> 00:57:37.770
which is sort of ironic,
but in any case,
so yes,

915
00:57:37.771 --> 00:57:42.270
I have my assistant for Admin and my copy editor for just proofing

916
00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:47.430
<v 1>and what,
what platform is,
is uh,
bring takings,
uh,
onto the moment.
What does it,</v>

917
00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:50.310
what's the technology pond is?
I knew that,
uh,

918
00:57:51.090 --> 00:57:54.750
I've heard you mentioned wordpress before.
Is it on,
is it still on wordpress?

919
00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:56.570
<v 2>Uh,
it is on wordpress.</v>

920
00:57:56.571 --> 00:58:00.450
I was going to make a joke about how the technology is called Corpus callosum

921
00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.113
technology.

922
00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:11.250
<v 1>Yeah.
Very Sam Harris,
a friendly joke.</v>

923
00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:14.970
Um,
the,
uh,
the,

924
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:19.440
so when you're working with say a,
your copy editor,
uh,

925
00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:25.070
do you give your copy editor admin access to wordpress and she'll go in

926
00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:32.390
proofread it and then schedule or publish,
what's the process?
It's,

927
00:58:32.410 --> 00:58:36.210
<v 2>it's a very,
again,
the pursuit of hacked together process,</v>

928
00:58:36.211 --> 00:58:41.211
which is every night I emailed her the articles from the preview page on

929
00:58:42.211 --> 00:58:42.870
wordpress.

930
00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:46.920
I just copy that and paste it into a body email and I send it to her and then

931
00:58:46.921 --> 00:58:50.940
she sends me the correction to your email.
Got It.
I mean like I said,

932
00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:55.770
she's not very,
I would say tech savvy.

933
00:58:55.771 --> 00:59:00.690
I mean I'm sure she's a wonderful learner so I'm sure she would totally learn

934
00:59:00.691 --> 00:59:02.610
how to do it if I gave her admin access.

935
00:59:02.611 --> 00:59:06.150
But between that and the fact that I write in html,

936
00:59:06.151 --> 00:59:09.410
so I really don't like the wiziwig.
I hate it actually.

937
00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:13.560
I think it's just easier to do it via email because then she can like highlight

938
00:59:13.561 --> 00:59:17.640
the word and sometimes she would make suggestions that are more stylistic.
And I,

939
00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:23.210
I would like to have the final say in cause it's very often I want to keep it

940
00:59:23.211 --> 00:59:26.540
the way that I have it because that's just my voice.
Um,

941
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:29.480
so I find email works just fine.

942
00:59:30.450 --> 00:59:31.790
<v 1>Got It.
Okay.
No,
I'm,</v>

943
00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:35.550
I'm always fascinated because I will use while when I was,

944
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:39.270
when I was hosting wordpress elsewhere,
I'm also in wordpress.

945
00:59:39.271 --> 00:59:44.130
I would use the share a draft plugin to share drafts with people.

946
00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:48.240
Uh,
I'm,
I'm now on wordpress VIP,
which has a,

947
00:59:49.170 --> 00:59:54.170
it has a sharing function where people can leave feedback in a sidebar that runs

948
00:59:54.211 --> 00:59:57.330
alongside the article itself,
which is pretty cool.

949
00:59:58.130 --> 01:00:01.130
<v 2>Well,
I should,
I should look into that.
I think that's what I have to their work.</v>

950
01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:03.420
Presby I see the wordpress hosted for press.

951
01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:06.980
I don't even know what the function is.
So I,
I'm kind of,

952
01:00:06.981 --> 01:00:11.180
I mean for somebody who writes on the web,
I'm,
I don't really,

953
01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.260
yeah,
I sometimes only learn about things through friends.

954
01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:20.240
<v 1>Well,
I think,
yeah,
that's,
that's how I learned about a lot of this stuff.
And the,</v>

955
01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:23.740
the other option that I've used quite a lot is,

956
01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:26.830
and as much as I hate word and I really do,

957
01:00:27.130 --> 01:00:32.130
I love the track changes feature and I just find it more user friendly for a lot

958
01:00:32.561 --> 01:00:37.561
of folks and then having them use something that's cloud based like a Google

959
01:00:37.931 --> 01:00:42.460
docs just because I operate so much offline to try to get anything done.

960
01:00:44.130 --> 01:00:47.570
<v 2>Yeah,
I mean that's what a lot of people suggesting what Chi my appropriate or</v>

961
01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:48.810
actually asked originally,

962
01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:52.800
but I do not own Microsoft products on principle.

963
01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:57.270
<v 1>Cool.
And I just said I'm not gonna deal with it.
Okay.
No that makes sense.</v>

964
01:00:57.330 --> 01:01:00.540
And your assistant,
what was,
what was the,

965
01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:04.590
the the sort of defining moment,

966
01:01:04.591 --> 01:01:07.410
the straw that broke the camel's back when you were like,
you know what?

967
01:01:07.411 --> 01:01:10.920
Like what was the day where you just like fucking enough of this,

968
01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:14.070
I need to get somebody's stat.
I mean,
what,

969
01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.110
when did you actually make the decision?

970
01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:21.440
<v 2>It wasn't so much that I made the decision and the decision was very</v>

971
01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:24.770
strongly,
lovingly,

972
01:01:24.771 --> 01:01:29.771
but strongly sort of pushed on me by my partner who one day said you are using

973
01:01:30.321 --> 01:01:34.700
so much time on things that are just so menial and you should not cause I was

974
01:01:34.701 --> 01:01:38.720
really stressing to a point of just driving myself crazy.

975
01:01:38.721 --> 01:01:43.190
And I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that I'm always have been very

976
01:01:43.191 --> 01:01:43.971
independent.

977
01:01:43.971 --> 01:01:48.830
I moved away from my parents house when I was 18 pray my way through school,

978
01:01:48.831 --> 01:01:52.700
lived always by myself and it just had this Emerson like,
you know,

979
01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:57.720
sad self sufficiency and self reliance that to a point of pathology where it was

980
01:01:58.971 --> 01:02:00.230
to my own detriment.

981
01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:04.760
And the notion about sourcing felt to me on some level,

982
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:10.340
um,
almost like an admission of weakness.
It's ridiculous.

983
01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:12.890
<v 1>I feel,
I feel like people though,
I know.</v>

984
01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:14.420
<v 2>And,
and it's the strange thing,</v>

985
01:02:14.421 --> 01:02:17.660
the disorienting thing is that I think we intellectually know that's not the

986
01:02:17.661 --> 01:02:18.494
case,

987
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:23.770
that actually a lot of strength to be able to delegate and just sort of divvy up

988
01:02:25.111 --> 01:02:27.300
control according to a hierarchy of priorities.

989
01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:31.740
But on some sort of cycle emotional level,
it is just death to,

990
01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:36.150
to consider that you cannot do something on your own anymore.
And of course,

991
01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:40.640
I mean it's interesting in terms of how Branco things of all would.

992
01:02:40.641 --> 01:02:45.030
She has always been very organic.
So the,
the sort of,
you know,

993
01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:48.540
eight year thing that has happened,

994
01:02:49.290 --> 01:02:53.850
it went from being a little newsletter that contains five links,
no texts,

995
01:02:53.851 --> 01:02:58.740
like five links to five things that I found very interesting.
Um,

996
01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:03.980
and then it went to sort of five links with a little paragraph about each about

997
01:03:04.141 --> 01:03:07.340
why this thing is interesting and important.
And then it was,
you know,
not,

998
01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:10.140
not a little paragraph but a little like one page piece.

999
01:03:10.141 --> 01:03:14.280
And then it became not one,
not five things every Friday,

1000
01:03:14.281 --> 01:03:16.590
but three things every day of the week.

1001
01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.560
Pretty long form in the thousands of words,
you know,

1002
01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:24.930
and I foolishly and they easily dog that I could just have the same sort of

1003
01:03:25.891 --> 01:03:30.891
operational framework despite the enormous swelling of,

1004
01:03:30.901 --> 01:03:34.800
of just the volume of the writing.
And that's unreasonable.

1005
01:03:34.801 --> 01:03:36.670
It's completely unreasonable.
Um,

1006
01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:41.690
so at one point last fall as the sort of seventh birthday of brainpickings was

1007
01:03:41.971 --> 01:03:45.140
approaching,
my partner was just like,
eat pleased.

1008
01:03:45.141 --> 01:03:49.410
It's like consider and uh,
yeah.

1009
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:54.640
<v 1>Hi,
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to cut you off.
I was just,
I'm always curious to ask,</v>

1010
01:03:54.641 --> 01:03:59.050
how did you,
how did you find this,
the assistant that you ended up with?

1011
01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:01.220
<v 2>Uh,
well,
she's wonderful.</v>

1012
01:04:01.221 --> 01:04:05.740
She's a professional sort of personal assistant that's had this type of jobs or

1013
01:04:05.741 --> 01:04:10.320
that 20 years.
Uh,
she's just a wonderfully warm and,

1014
01:04:10.321 --> 01:04:12.830
and just generous person,

1015
01:04:12.831 --> 01:04:17.420
but also has such doggedness about things and just work ethic.

1016
01:04:17.421 --> 01:04:18.530
It's unbelievable.

1017
01:04:18.531 --> 01:04:23.531
And you always have the sense that she's looking out for your best interest in,

1018
01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:27.620
in the most magnanimous kind of way towards you,

1019
01:04:27.621 --> 01:04:32.621
but also the most warmly non no bullshit way outwardly towards the world

1020
01:04:33.021 --> 01:04:37.070
demanding things from you and having this buffer.
It's really,

1021
01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:38.810
really great.
Yeah.

1022
01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:42.520
<v 1>And did,
uh,
was she,
how did you track her down?</v>

1023
01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:44.230
How did the two of you get connected?

1024
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:47.780
<v 2>Uh,
just a recommendation she's been working for,
um,</v>

1025
01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:52.460
somebody who is a very trusted dear person for a long time.

1026
01:04:52.461 --> 01:04:53.860
So now she works in both of us.

1027
01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.130
<v 1>And did that person reach out to you?
Did you reach out to her?</v>

1028
01:04:57.131 --> 01:05:01.270
I'm always curious about the specifics because of the way that I found one of my

1029
01:05:01.271 --> 01:05:06.100
first assistants and we worked together for many years was anytime I had a

1030
01:05:06.101 --> 01:05:10.090
really fantastic interaction with someone's assistant,
I would say,
Hey,

1031
01:05:10.091 --> 01:05:13.420
I know this is off topic,
but you've been awesome to deal with.
Do you have,

1032
01:05:13.421 --> 01:05:15.250
you know,
a twin brother,
twin sister,

1033
01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:20.400
somebody who does what you as well as you do at that you could recommend to me

1034
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:23.830
cause I need some help.
And I just did that over and over again.

1035
01:05:23.831 --> 01:05:24.730
And eventually one of the said,

1036
01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:27.580
well actually I worked for multiple clients so we can talk about it.

1037
01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:31.480
And that's how we ended up working together.
Uh,
but what,
what was the,

1038
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:36.240
<v 2>the introduction was made by the person.
So we,</v>

1039
01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:39.180
I had met her,
at least in my assistant,

1040
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:41.820
had met her just socially many times before.

1041
01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:46.010
And so eventually when the time came for me to consider,
um,

1042
01:05:46.830 --> 01:05:49.410
like she just like we set up a meeting,

1043
01:05:49.411 --> 01:05:53.340
we talked and she was really into it and she had been reading brain pickings and

1044
01:05:53.341 --> 01:05:56.190
uh,
um,
I asked,

1045
01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:59.280
made sure it wouldn't be too much on her plate.
Cause she's also,
I mean,

1046
01:05:59.281 --> 01:06:03.090
she's super woman,
Lisa superwoman.
She is the mother of two kids,

1047
01:06:03.091 --> 01:06:07.560
one of whom is now her first year in high school and the other one his first

1048
01:06:07.561 --> 01:06:12.530
year in college.
So I see that on her plate too.
And uh,
uh,

1049
01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:16.860
but she's very,
like I said,
very dogged,
very sort of dedicated.
And she was like,

1050
01:06:16.861 --> 01:06:21.240
I can get it and uh,
I'd like to do it.
And I was like,
great.
Let's roll

1051
01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:25.480
<v 1>onward with,
uh,
with your assistant.</v>

1052
01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:30.610
If you were to do in 80,
20 analysis of to the,
the,

1053
01:06:30.611 --> 01:06:35.200
you know,
the 20% of tasks that take up 80% of her time.

1054
01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:38.680
What,
what are the types,
what would those look like?

1055
01:06:39.790 --> 01:06:41.650
What does the vast majority of her time spent on?

1056
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:51.310
<v 2>A lot of it is I guess coordinating travel and things,</v>

1057
01:06:51.311 --> 01:06:52.990
but I'm trying to really,

1058
01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:58.020
I mean I have this new ish commitment to really not do any speaking at

1059
01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:00.250
commercial conferences anymore,

1060
01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:04.730
but to speak to students because I think it's important and um,

1061
01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:07.150
what it takes out of me,

1062
01:07:07.151 --> 01:07:10.690
which is a lot speaking takes out a lot of me because I'm a writer and I also

1063
01:07:10.691 --> 01:07:13.030
don't really recycle talks.
Um,

1064
01:07:13.031 --> 01:07:16.800
I like to write something original and when it's a commercial conference,

1065
01:07:16.801 --> 01:07:19.120
it just doesn't add up for me what I get out of it.

1066
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:22.480
Cause I usually donate my commissions due to the local public library and

1067
01:07:22.481 --> 01:07:26.890
whatnot.
But with students,
it is worth my time.
If I this way,

1068
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:31.950
even one journalism student from going into buzzworthy lands,

1069
01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:36.520
you know,
after graduation,
that's worth it to me.

1070
01:07:36.521 --> 01:07:40.180
And so even though I've scaled back on the speaking,
speaking,

1071
01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:43.420
I now getting like all these college requests.

1072
01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:45.490
And so that takes too much time,

1073
01:07:45.491 --> 01:07:49.390
especially coordinating because a lot of them are organized by sort of student

1074
01:07:49.391 --> 01:07:54.160
volunteers and they're kind of still learning what it means to,
you know,

1075
01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:57.100
schedules and deadlines and advanced notice.

1076
01:07:57.101 --> 01:08:01.330
And so it releases sort of wrangling that.
And another big part,

1077
01:08:01.450 --> 01:08:05.740
and I should also mention that the evolution of what I've been able to delegate

1078
01:08:05.741 --> 01:08:08.780
has been,
has sort of organically happens.

1079
01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.230
Originally I just really didn't know what to give her.

1080
01:08:11.231 --> 01:08:15.170
I felt like I had to do all of it cause I didn't know how to explain it to her

1081
01:08:15.171 --> 01:08:19.160
to do.
And,
but she's a great learner and I'm learning to delegate more.

1082
01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:23.270
But another thing,
because my site runs on donations,

1083
01:08:24.170 --> 01:08:26.300
I want to,

1084
01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:30.740
I sort of make an effort to send a handwritten thank you cards to just at this

1085
01:08:30.741 --> 01:08:35.060
point randomly picked donors every month.
Um,

1086
01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:41.080
and so I have her sort of export those names and emails for me and just give me

1087
01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:44.550
like,
just prepare envelopes and all those types of things.

1088
01:08:44.551 --> 01:08:48.800
The deck is not spend too much time on the actual admin of the mailing.

1089
01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:50.750
<v 1>And do you operate,</v>

1090
01:08:50.751 --> 01:08:54.860
do you communicate exclusively via email or do you use a soft other types of

1091
01:08:54.861 --> 01:08:55.510
software?

1092
01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:57.070
<v 2>Oh,
email,
email and text,</v>

1093
01:08:57.550 --> 01:09:01.690
<v 1>email and text.
So no project management software at this point?
No.</v>

1094
01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:03.790
Sort of base camp or a sauna or anything like that?

1095
01:09:04.330 --> 01:09:05.290
<v 2>No,
I don't.
I,</v>

1096
01:09:05.291 --> 01:09:10.240
that would make me feel like I'm some sort of commercial organization,

1097
01:09:10.241 --> 01:09:10.720
you know,

1098
01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:14.200
I still have so much resistance to the fact that even have to deal with these

1099
01:09:14.201 --> 01:09:18.650
things,
that Fascia,
that Oscar Wilde,
hypocrisy audience,

1100
01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:21.130
humanity,
I guess at the tension.

1101
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:25.930
<v 1>Uh,
what's,
um,
a couple of,
a couple of quick ones.</v>

1102
01:09:25.931 --> 01:09:29.740
So the first is when you,
when you lift,
do you tend to have the same workout?

1103
01:09:29.741 --> 01:09:31.870
What do you,
what is your,
what is your weightlifting look like

1104
01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:36.280
<v 2>changed a lot in the last year and a half?</v>

1105
01:09:36.281 --> 01:09:41.050
I've prioritize bodyweight stuff heavily,
no pun intended.

1106
01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:45.130
That was actually total inadvertent.
This how language,
how we think in language.

1107
01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:49.510
That's so funny.
Uh,
but,
uh,
I,
I prioritize bodyweight stuff and so I do pull ups,

1108
01:09:49.511 --> 01:09:52.100
pushups and that sort of thing.
Um,

1109
01:09:52.330 --> 01:09:57.310
it also depends on where I do my work.
Had My gym,
has my building,

1110
01:09:57.311 --> 01:10:01.810
has a sort of gym,
like,
uh,
you know,
one of those residential gyms.
Uh,

1111
01:10:01.811 --> 01:10:04.360
but I also have a membership at a larger,
um,

1112
01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.770
probably I think the best gym in New York.
I love it,

1113
01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.630
but I'm only there a few days a week.

1114
01:10:10.631 --> 01:10:12.790
So it just depends on where I do it and what I do.

1115
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:16.900
<v 1>If you had to pick one besides the elliptical,</v>

1116
01:10:16.901 --> 01:10:20.740
if you had to pick one body weight exercise to hold you over,

1117
01:10:20.741 --> 01:10:22.000
let's say you're traveling for a few months,

1118
01:10:22.001 --> 01:10:24.100
you can only pick one body weight exercise,
what would it be?

1119
01:10:25.710 --> 01:10:29.410
<v 2>Well,
it wouldn't be pull up,
but you can't always find a place to do it.</v>

1120
01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:33.190
So I just do usually elevated pushups,

1121
01:10:33.191 --> 01:10:38.191
so my feet on a bench or bed or some like a step or something and just push ups.

1122
01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:38.791
<v 1>Cool.</v>

1123
01:10:38.791 --> 01:10:43.791
A great little hack for pulling motions while traveling is putting your feet on

1124
01:10:44.581 --> 01:10:49.581
a chair and going underneath a table to do basically inverted bent rows,

1125
01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:54.480
uh,
to,
you know,
it's actually very helpful for traveling is a plyometrics,

1126
01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:59.250
plyometrics and a TRX is actually quite handy.
There's a sort of system

1127
01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:01.570
<v 2>for some reason it just not my thing.</v>

1128
01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:03.440
<v 1>You can't get into it.
Yeah.</v>

1129
01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:06.080
<v 2>The thing is,
here's the thing.</v>

1130
01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:10.400
So if I am forced by circumstances to do a workout,

1131
01:11:10.401 --> 01:11:11.750
that is not my preference.

1132
01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:15.630
I very much like to be able to do something else while doing it,

1133
01:11:15.631 --> 01:11:17.130
such as listening to podcasts,

1134
01:11:17.131 --> 01:11:21.210
which is what I do well while I do weights at the gym anyway.
Um,

1135
01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:24.750
and there are certain types of movements that it's just a hassle to have the

1136
01:11:24.751 --> 01:11:29.120
headphones and it was just like not great.
Sure.
So I actually carry a,

1137
01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:33.800
um,
waited jump rope with me when I travel in case there's no,

1138
01:11:33.801 --> 01:11:38.280
or to do sprints,
which is my plan B for Cardio.

1139
01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:42.870
And then plan C is just jumping,
skipping rope.
Yeah.

1140
01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:47.280
<v 1>You're intense.
I love it.
The,
uh,
I remember the,
the,
uh,
you know,
I wanted to,</v>

1141
01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:48.990
every time I meet,
and this is so silly,

1142
01:11:48.991 --> 01:11:53.991
but I was so obsessed with a Bulgarian Olympic weightlifters for very long time,

1143
01:11:54.031 --> 01:11:57.780
that whenever I meet Bulgarians are people who in at any point have lived in

1144
01:11:57.781 --> 01:12:01.260
Bulgaria.
I want to talk about Olympic weight lifting,
but it's not,

1145
01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:03.060
I know nothing about them.

1146
01:12:03.061 --> 01:12:07.640
I don't know exactly your wait staff when I was living area.
No,

1147
01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:11.220
exactly.
It's kind of like,
uh,
uh,
you know,
like,
Oh,
you're from Switzerland,

1148
01:12:11.221 --> 01:12:13.800
let me talk to you about the guys in the Rico look commercial.
They're like,
no,

1149
01:12:13.801 --> 01:12:15.090
we don't talk about that stuff.
Um,

1150
01:12:15.810 --> 01:12:17.330
<v 2>yeah.
Is that guy your cousin?</v>

1151
01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:21.580
<v 1>Yeah.
Right,
right.
You must know like,
no,
I actually don't like,</v>

1152
01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:24.040
I know I went to the x,
Y and z college,

1153
01:12:24.041 --> 01:12:28.540
but there are 5,000 people per year.
It doesn't,

1154
01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.520
it doesn't always work out.
You mentioned the donations.

1155
01:12:30.521 --> 01:12:34.980
I want to talk about the site.
So
it appears,
and I,

1156
01:12:34.981 --> 01:12:35.980
and I dug around a bit,

1157
01:12:35.981 --> 01:12:39.220
but it appears that you have no comments or dates on your posts.

1158
01:12:39.250 --> 01:12:40.083
Is that accurate?

1159
01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:43.910
<v 2>I don't have comments.
I do have dates there.
And then you're out.</v>

1160
01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:48.380
<v 1>Oh,
they're in the URL.
But they're not in the post there in the URL structure,</v>

1161
01:12:48.381 --> 01:12:50.480
but they're not in the displayed post itself.

1162
01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:51.281
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1163
01:12:51.281 --> 01:12:56.281
So the reason for that is because I do think we living in enormously news

1164
01:12:59.411 --> 01:13:00.820
fetishistic culture.

1165
01:13:00.821 --> 01:13:05.821
And the reason I do what I do is precisely to decondition that because we think

1166
01:13:06.971 --> 01:13:10.930
that if something is not news and it's not at the top of the search results or

1167
01:13:10.931 --> 01:13:13.990
the top of the feed because all feeds or reverse chronology,

1168
01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:17.650
then you know there's an implicit hierarchy of importance to that.

1169
01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.860
We think if it's not at the top,
it's not important.
And you know,

1170
01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:23.590
you would understand,
you know,
writing about Seneca,

1171
01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:26.710
it really doesn't matter with a date stamp on it is.

1172
01:13:26.711 --> 01:13:31.711
But I think that this culture conditions is so much people when they see a date

1173
01:13:31.901 --> 01:13:36.220
stamp,
they sort of think,
oh,
this was like two years old.

1174
01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:38.620
Oh and it's really,
you know,
2000 years old.

1175
01:13:39.550 --> 01:13:41.210
<v 1>But because a lot of backlash</v>

1176
01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:46.250
<v 2>[inaudible] actually use brain pickings to reference.
So I constantly get things,</v>

1177
01:13:46.251 --> 01:13:49.610
this is another thing that leaves to deals with like request from textbooks or

1178
01:13:49.611 --> 01:13:53.810
citations or you know,
whatnot.
And those people actually need the dates.

1179
01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:56.630
So I've made it so that if you actually look,

1180
01:13:56.660 --> 01:14:00.290
it's kind of easy to to see or I can just tell them it's when they rights and

1181
01:14:00.291 --> 01:14:02.300
asked me what the date is,
look in the URL,

1182
01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:05.690
but it's just not one of those immediate things that slaps you over the head,

1183
01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:07.850
like a newspaper front page.
You know?

1184
01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:08.821
<v 1>Definitely.</v>

1185
01:14:08.821 --> 01:14:13.821
I actually have done the same thing for quite a few years and if you,

1186
01:14:15.911 --> 01:14:17.990
if you go to any permalinks so if you go,

1187
01:14:17.991 --> 01:14:20.980
if you get linked to any of my posts directly on the blog,

1188
01:14:20.981 --> 01:14:24.940
the date is there in the URL,
but also,
uh,

1189
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:29.830
at the very bottom of the post after the related links.
So for the same reason,

1190
01:14:29.831 --> 01:14:32.830
because there's so much bias against older material.

1191
01:14:32.831 --> 01:14:34.780
And I think some of my older stuff is,

1192
01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:39.010
I mean it depends on the person obviously in the context,
but,
um,
it's,

1193
01:14:39.011 --> 01:14:43.420
it's an easy way to have a high sort of abandonment rate is to,

1194
01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.160
to timestamp the comments.

1195
01:14:45.161 --> 01:14:47.450
Did you ever have comments or have you never had comments?

1196
01:14:48.810 --> 01:14:53.060
<v 2>And then I was like,
you know what,
I kind of feel like Herzog does.</v>

1197
01:14:53.061 --> 01:14:55.930
I don't really care to hear.
I mean,
I do write for me,
I'm,

1198
01:14:55.931 --> 01:14:59.930
I'm very gladdened by people who are in any way moved or touched a,

1199
01:14:59.931 --> 01:15:02.210
but the comments I was getting,
I was,

1200
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:04.860
I've been fortunate enough not to really get any,
you know,

1201
01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:06.410
trolling or anything like that,

1202
01:15:06.650 --> 01:15:11.600
but they were kind of bacon or people trying to plug their own thing or spam and

1203
01:15:11.601 --> 01:15:13.580
it was taking more of my time that was worth.

1204
01:15:13.581 --> 01:15:18.560
And so instead of made my contact information very easily accessible.

1205
01:15:18.561 --> 01:15:22.490
So if someone has something of substance and urgency to say,

1206
01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:26.390
which is I think that two things that compel people to reach out,
uh,

1207
01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:31.460
they'll do it via email,
behind their own name and not anonymously.
And then,

1208
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:35.660
I mean I do get a lot of,
a lot of emails from readers,
um,

1209
01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:40.430
and those are valuable,
you know,
but I don't really care for comments.

1210
01:15:40.431 --> 01:15:45.431
Now the flip side of that is that now that I have the Facebook page having

1211
01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:49.790
something mysterious happened with the brain pickings Faisal page last fall

1212
01:15:49.791 --> 01:15:53.270
where it just started growing so fast.
I've no idea why

1213
01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:55.590
<v 1>I was going to ask you about that because if you,</v>

1214
01:15:55.591 --> 01:15:59.160
if you look at say that your Twitter follower growth versus your Facebook
groups,

1215
01:15:59.161 --> 01:16:01.080
the Facebook just kind of took off.

1216
01:16:01.450 --> 01:16:01.781
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1217
01:16:01.781 --> 01:16:06.781
it was in about October of last year and it went from 250,002 now I think,

1218
01:16:06.971 --> 01:16:07.271
I don't know,

1219
01:16:07.271 --> 01:16:12.271
I think it's close to three maybe so more than 10 fold in less than a year.

1220
01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:15.520
I have no idea why I've done nothing differently.
I'm very,

1221
01:16:15.521 --> 01:16:16.840
I don't really enjoy Facebook.

1222
01:16:16.841 --> 01:16:21.520
I do it reluctantly because I know I get a lot of emails from readers,

1223
01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:26.470
um,
elsewhere in the world who actually use Facebook as their primary thing and

1224
01:16:26.471 --> 01:16:27.940
they're such sweet notes,
you know,

1225
01:16:27.941 --> 01:16:32.680
people who just are stimulated and inspired and moved in a way that perhaps they

1226
01:16:32.681 --> 01:16:36.430
wouldn't be if they hadn't read that piece about some random thing that I read

1227
01:16:36.431 --> 01:16:37.010
and wrote about.

1228
01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:41.950
And I think it would be selfish of me to just sort of disabled Facebook because

1229
01:16:41.951 --> 01:16:46.660
I hate it.
But the,
the point of it is that you can't,
you have comments on there.

1230
01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:49.030
And Lisa,
my assistant,
actually,

1231
01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.190
that's something I delegated her a few months ago.
Uh,

1232
01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:56.670
just to completely deal with them.
I can't,
I can't deal with them.
I can't.
And,

1233
01:16:56.671 --> 01:17:01.671
and not for any other reason that I have complete allergy to people pronouncing

1234
01:17:05.161 --> 01:17:09.320
their so called opinions without having actually digested or even engaged with

1235
01:17:09.321 --> 01:17:09.591
the thing.

1236
01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:14.591
So people would comment on the basis of like a thumbnail image or the title make

1237
01:17:14.781 --> 01:17:17.780
really outrageously inaccurate comments.

1238
01:17:17.781 --> 01:17:22.781
Clearly not having read the piece and this kind of snap reaction thing that I

1239
01:17:25.311 --> 01:17:29.290
think social media to a large extent perpetuate.
I can deal with it.
It just,
it,

1240
01:17:29.370 --> 01:17:33.340
it's like a psychic drain.
Like I can't even explain it.
Just,
I can't.

1241
01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:37.610
<v 1>So anyway,
so that would explain,
that would answer one of my questions,</v>

1242
01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:40.760
which is in your header picture on,
uh,

1243
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:42.770
Facebook you have,

1244
01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.530
this should be a cardinal rule of the internet and of being human.

1245
01:17:45.531 --> 01:17:48.380
If you don't have the patience to read something,
don't have the Hubris to come.

1246
01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:51.053
Yeah,

1247
01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:56.160
<v 2>care if it's a town like bitsy or anything,
the point,
I mean,</v>

1248
01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:56.760
you know,

1249
01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:01.320
it's interesting because I think a lot about criticism and the notion of

1250
01:18:01.321 --> 01:18:05.790
criticism and,
and why it's so hard for anybody and I,

1251
01:18:05.791 --> 01:18:10.791
I don't think that people have a hard time with criticism because another

1252
01:18:11.131 --> 01:18:15.690
person,
this agrees with or dislikes what they're saying,

1253
01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:19.110
they really have a hard time when they feel misunderstood.

1254
01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:23.580
Like the other person does not understand who they are or what they stand for in

1255
01:18:23.581 --> 01:18:26.100
the world.
900% of the time.

1256
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:29.080
And you actually touch on this in your conversation with Sam Harris will just

1257
01:18:29.081 --> 01:18:33.540
say that his ideas are not as controversial as people think when they don't

1258
01:18:33.541 --> 01:18:35.160
actually understand what they are.
Right?

1259
01:18:35.190 --> 01:18:40.190
But the main source of anguish is not being seen for who you are,

1260
01:18:41.671 --> 01:18:42.750
not being understood.

1261
01:18:43.050 --> 01:18:48.050
And this kind of reactive culture where people comment without taking the care

1262
01:18:48.481 --> 01:18:51.240
to understand what you're expressing,
who you are,
what you stand for.

1263
01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:56.850
It is so toxic.
It is so toxic to readers,
to writers,
to us as a culture.

1264
01:18:57.150 --> 01:19:02.150
And I just don't know how to get around it other than just having instructed

1265
01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:07.380
Elisa to be just merciless about banning people and deleting comments that are

1266
01:19:07.381 --> 01:19:12.270
just not,
there's no humanity,
there's no patients,

1267
01:19:12.271 --> 01:19:15.630
there's no thinking in them.
So I mean,
he,
you know,

1268
01:19:15.690 --> 01:19:18.000
anybody who writes online,

1269
01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:21.720
I think feel similarly that this is kind of my home.

1270
01:19:21.721 --> 01:19:24.510
And if that's what people come and be idiots in it,

1271
01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:26.850
then they're not welcome there.
So

1272
01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:31.210
<v 1>yeah,
no,
I actually used the exact same analogy.
I say,
look,
I've,
you might,</v>

1273
01:19:31.211 --> 01:19:34.270
especially on my blog,
I've used the comments is my living room.

1274
01:19:34.271 --> 01:19:37.330
And if you come into my house for the first time and get raging drunk and like

1275
01:19:37.930 --> 01:19:40.490
take your sh,
you know,
put your feet up on my table with your shoes,

1276
01:19:41.890 --> 01:19:45.680
you're not going to be invited back.
You're gone,
you know?
Um,
so is,

1277
01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:49.450
is your assistant's job as it relates to Facebook then primarily calling the

1278
01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:51.220
herd and just removing the,

1279
01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:56.260
the idiots or does she have it?
What are,
what are other instructions,

1280
01:19:56.261 --> 01:19:58.570
if any?
Are there things that she passes to you?

1281
01:19:58.571 --> 01:20:00.250
Are there things that she responds to?

1282
01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:05.180
<v 2>No,
I don't.
I don't really care what people say.</v>

1283
01:20:05.181 --> 01:20:08.220
Again,
to the point that if people have something substance and urgency,

1284
01:20:08.221 --> 01:20:09.360
they will reach out.

1285
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:13.560
And I'm then very happy to hear from actual humans and engage in a human

1286
01:20:13.561 --> 01:20:16.410
dialogue,
which I do,
but I don't really care about,
you know,

1287
01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:17.370
the comments on Facebook.

1288
01:20:17.371 --> 01:20:22.260
I just don't want them depressing me when I go on the page because I put my own

1289
01:20:22.261 --> 01:20:23.400
thing.
You know,

1290
01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:28.560
Lisa doesn't put the actual postings and I also don't want them creating a

1291
01:20:29.041 --> 01:20:33.630
culture that is antithetical to the very reason why I do what I do,

1292
01:20:33.631 --> 01:20:37.650
which is a kind of faith in the human spirit.
I mean that's where I come from.

1293
01:20:37.651 --> 01:20:40.910
I am a cautious one sometimes,

1294
01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:45.920
but an optimist about the so called human condition and anybody who craps on

1295
01:20:46.681 --> 01:20:50.880
that without having him and given a chance to the thoughts that,

1296
01:20:51.090 --> 01:20:53.220
that speak to the,
the to those ideals,

1297
01:20:53.221 --> 01:20:58.050
which is what my articles or record at then I will want them gone,
you know?

1298
01:20:58.050 --> 01:21:00.150
And so her instructions or just,
you know,

1299
01:21:00.151 --> 01:21:05.100
band people who are offensive to others sort of in a vicious way as opposed to

1300
01:21:05.101 --> 01:21:08.790
just having rational discourse of disagreement,
a band,

1301
01:21:08.791 --> 01:21:10.750
people who are ignorant and,

1302
01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:15.830
and have not read the thing and have some very scandalous or anything,

1303
01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:20.640
not even scandalous sort of contrarian sensation was take on it.

1304
01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:25.940
Clearly not understanding the nuance because I mean a culture of news is I say

1305
01:21:26.761 --> 01:21:31.470
often a culture without nuance then um,
yeah.

1306
01:21:31.530 --> 01:21:35.490
So that that's basically,
it helped me stay sane when I look at them.
That's her,

1307
01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:37.510
that's her task,
not fake.

1308
01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:42.740
You lose my mind over exasperations when people was impatient.

1309
01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:47.540
<v 1>No.
And I,
you know,
I really respect that because,
uh,
another reason that I read,</v>

1310
01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:48.853
uh,

1311
01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:53.600
brain pickings as opposed to other sites and I feel comfortable going there is

1312
01:21:53.601 --> 01:21:57.830
that I feel it is sort of a stronghold of positivity and optimism,

1313
01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:01.100
uh,
in,
in a lot of respects.
So kudos.

1314
01:22:01.970 --> 01:22:06.800
The email,
uh,
actually before we get the email,

1315
01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:10.430
I've read that you schedule your Twitter and Facebook,

1316
01:22:10.431 --> 01:22:14.090
which would make sense because you're prolific.
Uh,
if that,

1317
01:22:14.091 --> 01:22:17.780
if that's still the case,
what do you use to schedule that social media?

1318
01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:22.060
<v 2>I use buffer for,
um,
uh,</v>

1319
01:22:22.150 --> 01:22:26.410
Twitter and I use my hands for Facebook.
Yeah.
Um,

1320
01:22:27.550 --> 01:22:28.181
but again,

1321
01:22:28.181 --> 01:22:33.181
I mean this goes back to the same inner struggle of I do want to be reading and

1322
01:22:33.971 --> 01:22:34.960
writing for myself.

1323
01:22:34.961 --> 01:22:38.620
So why do I have the compulsion to put so much of it out there?

1324
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:44.310
And I just sell flagellate over that because on some level it does seem like a

1325
01:22:45.671 --> 01:22:46.570
form of hypocrisy.

1326
01:22:46.571 --> 01:22:51.280
But then I do think about the people that email me from India and Pakistan and

1327
01:22:51.281 --> 01:22:56.200
South Africa and Korea and we're wherever,
that actually,
that's how they connect.

1328
01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:02.260
And I think if I'm putting in the amount of time that I do into,
into what I do,

1329
01:23:02.590 --> 01:23:04.060
even if I do it for myself,

1330
01:23:04.090 --> 01:23:08.500
I might as well just harness that time anyway if it benefits somebody else's

1331
01:23:08.501 --> 01:23:12.220
journey,
you know?
And so I do it because of that mostly.

1332
01:23:13.150 --> 01:23:17.140
<v 1>Definitely.
And I think that while it's fun to write for yourself,</v>

1333
01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:18.513
if you,

1334
01:23:18.730 --> 01:23:23.730
if you keep the value of what you write to yourself when it could benefit a lot

1335
01:23:24.791 --> 01:23:26.590
of other people,
then I think that's actually,

1336
01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:30.490
it could be viewed as a selfish act.
Right?
So the,
I think,
yeah,

1337
01:23:30.670 --> 01:23:31.650
I think that there's,

1338
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:35.470
particularly when you're curating and the way that you do and you're saving

1339
01:23:35.471 --> 01:23:40.471
people thousands of hours of searching by distilling a lot of these concepts.

1340
01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:41.743
Um,

1341
01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:46.940
<v 2>well I would argue that the benefit,
the value is not even,</v>

1342
01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:50.120
I mean,
what I do is kind of the antithesis of search.

1343
01:23:50.121 --> 01:23:55.121
It's a discovery of things that ideally one would not have come across within

1344
01:23:56.151 --> 01:23:59.480
the usual parameters of once filter bubble.
Right.

1345
01:23:59.481 --> 01:24:03.910
So sort of a lot of the people that that I hear from,

1346
01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:07.070
for example,
you know,
just this week two two's the Seneca example.

1347
01:24:07.071 --> 01:24:11.690
Actually just this week I heard from this guy who was an it person,

1348
01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:16.370
trained as a physicist,
end up doing it and said the Seneca,

1349
01:24:16.371 --> 01:24:19.910
the shortness of life piece really,
really put everything in perspective.

1350
01:24:19.911 --> 01:24:22.700
I've never really read philosophy,
never been interested in it,

1351
01:24:22.701 --> 01:24:23.540
never looked for it,

1352
01:24:23.541 --> 01:24:27.770
but it's just cut in the middle of what I'm struggling with right now in my own

1353
01:24:27.771 --> 01:24:32.360
life,
you know,
and it's kind of,
it gives me pause to hear that from people.

1354
01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:36.840
<v 1>Definitely agreed.
Uh,
on a,</v>

1355
01:24:36.850 --> 01:24:38.510
on email the,

1356
01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:42.880
if you go to your contact page,

1357
01:24:42.881 --> 01:24:47.881
you recommend email charter.org and I'm very curious to hear if people actually

1358
01:24:50.471 --> 01:24:54.630
follow the email charter e liquid.
Would you,

1359
01:24:55.330 --> 01:24:59.160
in terms of the,
the email that you receive,
um,

1360
01:24:59.350 --> 01:25:01.460
do people actually pay attention to that and for,

1361
01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:06.130
<v 2>yeah,
they do.
And I'm so grateful and I mean,
but the majority of them do,</v>

1362
01:25:06.131 --> 01:25:06.964
you know,

1363
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:12.030
some people who reach out with the intention of self promoting there.

1364
01:25:12.231 --> 01:25:13.210
There's usually,
you know,

1365
01:25:13.211 --> 01:25:17.260
laziness to people who self promote for the sake thereof,
you know,

1366
01:25:17.650 --> 01:25:20.530
so they don't,
they don't usually,
um,
follow.

1367
01:25:20.531 --> 01:25:25.531
But people who actually care to have a conversation and to engage are very

1368
01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:30.610
courteous and very sort of mindful of what I've asked,

1369
01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:32.590
except for publicists who are never.

1370
01:25:33.690 --> 01:25:34.780
<v 1>Yeah,
right.
Well,
I mean,</v>

1371
01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:39.240
I suppose if they're flying on autopilot and just blasting out a template,

1372
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:43.800
do your blow,
dear blogger.
Oh yeah.
I love it.
It's the deer blogger.
Yeah.

1373
01:25:44.730 --> 01:25:45.250
Yeah.

1374
01:25:45.250 --> 01:25:49.750
<v 2>You know what I did very often,
which I think is actually hilarious,
uh,</v>

1375
01:25:50.170 --> 01:25:54.400
people who don't even bother to read the name of the site,
so they address me,

1376
01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:55.610
dear Brian,

1377
01:25:57.210 --> 01:25:58.043
<v 1>right.</v>

1378
01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:03.080
<v 2>Pinnacle of this was when last year,</v>

1379
01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:07.100
at one point I opened my physical mailbox in my building,

1380
01:26:07.101 --> 01:26:12.101
my home and I found this bundle from the USPSA like with an elastic band around

1381
01:26:13.401 --> 01:26:13.630
it,

1382
01:26:13.630 --> 01:26:18.630
of mail for somebody named Brian Pekins who lives in Long Beach ca or

1383
01:26:21.730 --> 01:26:22.563
<v 1>do I get</v>

1384
01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:28.290
<v 2>some how that stuff got forwarded to me because I guess the guy either moved and</v>

1385
01:26:28.291 --> 01:26:32.640
the you sps,
like somehow look things up.
I didn't even know.

1386
01:26:32.641 --> 01:26:36.850
It was such a sort of mystery and metaphor for what I deal with that.

1387
01:26:37.730 --> 01:26:38.563
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1388
01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:41.320
<v 2>you don't have good public first.
Not Too.</v>

1389
01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:46.520
<v 1>So I used to have a company ages ago called brain quicken,
a</v>

1390
01:26:48.670 --> 01:26:53.340
telemarketing call when evening.
And uh,
guy goes,

1391
01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:58.240
hi,
sorry if I'm interrupting,
is this Brian?
And I go,
excuse me?
And he goes,
Brian,

1392
01:26:58.270 --> 01:27:01.390
Brian Chicken.
And I'm like,
I'm Brian Chicken.

1393
01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:08.370
I was like,
Eh,
no.
And take me off your list to goodbye.
Uh,
the,

1394
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:12.790
um,
oh God.
So on the,
on the,
uh,

1395
01:27:13.210 --> 01:27:16.480
on the email in pitching side of things or just on the pitching side of things,

1396
01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:19.660
how on earth do you deal with,

1397
01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:22.630
not just cold inquiries,

1398
01:27:22.631 --> 01:27:26.690
but how do you deal with writer friends or acquaintances who are writers that

1399
01:27:26.691 --> 01:27:29.560
you don't want to be rude to,
who want you to read their books?

1400
01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:34.150
How do you polite decline that stuff and maybe maybe you don't get a lot of it.

1401
01:27:34.151 --> 01:27:38.060
I get a ton of it.
And the fact of the matter is like not everyone is,

1402
01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:42.910
is able to put the time or effort into writing a good book.

1403
01:27:42.911 --> 01:27:47.911
So inevitably if I get 10 books from decent or good friends,

1404
01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:52.090
some of them are going to be terrible and I don't have the time to certainly or

1405
01:27:52.091 --> 01:27:55.810
the inclination to read them all.
How do you deal with that type of situation?

1406
01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:57.140
<v 2>Well,</v>

1407
01:27:57.140 --> 01:28:02.140
I guess the deal first and foremost by controlling not the outcome but the,

1408
01:28:03.291 --> 01:28:07.850
the cause,
which is your circle of friends and acquaintances.

1409
01:28:07.851 --> 01:28:12.590
I'm very selective about the people I surround myself with.
And,
um,

1410
01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:16.520
I like to think friendly to pretty much everybody that I need.

1411
01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:21.350
But my circle of actual friends is really close and really tight and people who

1412
01:28:21.351 --> 01:28:22.520
are just,
you know,

1413
01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:26.360
when the sky crumbles are going to be there and we're there for each other.

1414
01:28:26.361 --> 01:28:27.920
And so with that in mind,

1415
01:28:27.921 --> 01:28:32.921
I think there is a certain boundary they have to put up beforehand to to,

1416
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:39.380
to I guess manage social expectations in a way.
Um,
and so for those people,

1417
01:28:39.381 --> 01:28:41.660
my friend friends in large part,

1418
01:28:41.661 --> 01:28:44.030
I mean I should mention that the majority of my close friends,

1419
01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:48.230
including my partner to,
or people that I've met just through what I do.

1420
01:28:48.230 --> 01:28:53.230
So there's already the self selection of sensibility and ideals and you know,

1421
01:28:54.010 --> 01:28:59.010
I think would become a centripetal force for the kinds of people we want to be

1422
01:28:59.391 --> 01:29:01.710
in,
surround ourselves with those types of people.

1423
01:29:01.711 --> 01:29:04.770
William Gibson has a wonderful word for it.
He calls it personnel.

1424
01:29:04.771 --> 01:29:09.030
Microculture uh,
and even when you said early on the kinship of spirit,

1425
01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:10.740
I think that's so important.
So,

1426
01:29:10.741 --> 01:29:15.741
which is the long winded way to say that when and if those inner circle people

1427
01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:21.120
put a book out,
it's a guarantee that I will like it because of who they are.

1428
01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:24.090
And so then I'm more than happy to support it.
I mean the,

1429
01:29:24.330 --> 01:29:29.220
the book that we started with the scratch and sniff guide to whine when d the

1430
01:29:29.221 --> 01:29:31.800
illustrator is precisely that type of person.

1431
01:29:31.801 --> 01:29:35.430
Somebody who I met through what each of us does and she's now one of my closest

1432
01:29:35.431 --> 01:29:38.400
human beings,
you know?
And so of course I'm going to support her work,

1433
01:29:38.401 --> 01:29:41.940
but not because I'm being um,
nepotistic about it,

1434
01:29:41.941 --> 01:29:46.941
but because that's the pre requirement that I am moved by her work and respect

1435
01:29:47.241 --> 01:29:49.530
it and love it.
And that's how we became friends.

1436
01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:53.760
But outside of that inner circle,
I don't,

1437
01:29:54.450 --> 01:29:59.450
I think acquaintances know that there's no such expectation and when I do get

1438
01:30:00.571 --> 01:30:02.550
such requests,
it's a matter of,
well,

1439
01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:07.710
did the person do their homework and knowing what I actually think and write

1440
01:30:07.711 --> 01:30:11.010
about,
because very often I'm sure he had that to get pitched.

1441
01:30:11.011 --> 01:30:14.430
Things that are just so outside of what you do,

1442
01:30:14.431 --> 01:30:17.550
in which case I don't even feel compelled to respond because if they didn't put

1443
01:30:17.551 --> 01:30:20.250
in the time to understand what I'm interested in,

1444
01:30:20.251 --> 01:30:23.400
why should I put in the time to explain to them why this is not a fit?

1445
01:30:23.630 --> 01:30:26.330
<v 1>Yeah,
that's a great way to put it.
I need to embrace that more.</v>

1446
01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:30.830
I think that's an area where I carry a lot of guilt.
Guilt.
Yeah.

1447
01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:32.633
<v 2>Guilt.</v>

1448
01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:36.750
It's interesting because guilt is kind of the flip side of prestige and they're

1449
01:30:36.751 --> 01:30:39.960
both horrible reasons to do things.

1450
01:30:39.961 --> 01:30:42.030
So often we would agree as humans,

1451
01:30:42.031 --> 01:30:45.810
not just you and me or just anybody would agree to do things because they sound

1452
01:30:45.811 --> 01:30:48.870
prestigious is in some way,
you know,
and,

1453
01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:54.270
and equally avoid things because of the guilt thing or do things because guilt

1454
01:30:54.271 --> 01:30:54.481
thing.

1455
01:30:54.481 --> 01:30:59.280
But sort of the whole Buddhist thing about a version of,

1456
01:30:59.281 --> 01:31:04.080
you know,
avoidance and aversion and making decisions based out of either fear,

1457
01:31:04.081 --> 01:31:05.130
which is what guilt is.

1458
01:31:05.131 --> 01:31:08.490
It's the fear of disappointing somebody and then feeling disappointed in

1459
01:31:08.491 --> 01:31:11.100
yourself or out of,
um,

1460
01:31:11.370 --> 01:31:15.480
sort of grasping for approval or a claim,

1461
01:31:15.481 --> 01:31:17.200
which is what doing things for prestige is.

1462
01:31:17.201 --> 01:31:22.201
I think either of those are really bad reasons to do things and yet they

1463
01:31:23.130 --> 01:31:27.120
motivate us a lot or at least they sort of lurk in the back of the mind

1464
01:31:27.150 --> 01:31:30.810
constantly in it.
And it is a real practice to try to decondition that.

1465
01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:35.760
<v 1>Definitely.
No,
I like,
I like,
I like what you said about,
uh,</v>

1466
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:38.820
why put in the effort to explain why it's not a fit if they haven't done the

1467
01:31:38.821 --> 01:31:42.770
homework to determine if it is a fit.
I think that's a great way to put it.
Um,

1468
01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:47.700
I want to ask,
uh,
and I know we don't have too much time left,

1469
01:31:47.701 --> 01:31:51.420
so hopefully sometime someday we can do a follow up part two.

1470
01:31:51.421 --> 01:31:54.780
I think that'd be a blast.
I'll bring some mall back if you actually,

1471
01:31:56.290 --> 01:31:59.530
I can introduce you to at firsthand,
but the,
the donations,

1472
01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:03.100
I'm very fascinated by,
uh,
the,

1473
01:32:03.310 --> 01:32:07.840
the ad free donation approach and uh,

1474
01:32:07.950 --> 01:32:12.370
just just to,
to keep it simple.
If you had to choose,

1475
01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:17.410
um,
say 20% of the options you're currently offering,

1476
01:32:18.010 --> 01:32:21.400
which would you choose and why?
In other words,
you have people do that.

1477
01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:22.020
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1478
01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:24.540
<v 1>no,
no.
So I'll,
I'll explain.
Or two or three.
So you,</v>

1479
01:32:24.541 --> 01:32:28.800
so people can make one time offer,
they can make a one time single contribution.

1480
01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:33.450
Uh,
they can,
uh,
let me simplify that question.

1481
01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:38.280
Or they can become a member and donate,
you know,
seven,

1482
01:32:38.281 --> 01:32:41.520
three,
10 or $25 a month.
Um,

1483
01:32:41.730 --> 01:32:46.730
what I'm trying to ask without being improprieties or making you feel

1484
01:32:47.281 --> 01:32:50.980
uncomfortable is what is working best.
Uh,

1485
01:32:51.090 --> 01:32:54.090
and when you're asking people for donations,
you know,
assuming that it's working,

1486
01:32:54.730 --> 01:32:55.470
uh,

1487
01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:59.340
if someone were to offer one or two options instead of four options per month,

1488
01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:00.820
or the,

1489
01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:04.320
the single contribution versus the membership or the membership versus the

1490
01:33:04.410 --> 01:33:06.900
single contribution,
what would your advice be to people?

1491
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:08.300
<v 2>Hmm.
Well,</v>

1492
01:33:08.301 --> 01:33:12.890
I will preface this with a caveat that I use paypal for donations and I can't,

1493
01:33:12.891 --> 01:33:16.010
for the life of me figure out how to actually like,

1494
01:33:16.011 --> 01:33:20.900
look at the data and get any sort of real reason.
All of it.
It's so antiquated,

1495
01:33:20.901 --> 01:33:25.100
their export tools and such.
And I'm not that interested in,
I would slicing,

1496
01:33:25.101 --> 01:33:26.930
you know,
days into looking into it.

1497
01:33:26.931 --> 01:33:29.940
So I can tell you sort of my intuitive interpretation is yeah,
great.

1498
01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:34.850
And by the way,
the only reason these options are as they are also,

1499
01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:38.660
it is also the reason why I don't have an ad supported site,

1500
01:33:38.661 --> 01:33:42.890
which is I just asked myself,
what would I like to read as a reader?
Well,

1501
01:33:42.891 --> 01:33:47.000
I would like an ad free site and how would I like to support that?
Well,

1502
01:33:47.001 --> 01:33:51.110
I'd like to have a few options,
you know,
just because I don't want to,
you know,

1503
01:33:51.111 --> 01:33:52.520
being sort of confined to something.

1504
01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:57.520
And so I just just pull it out of the hat basically with these tears and I've

1505
01:33:57.771 --> 01:34:00.740
just left them on since they put them on.
They seem to work,
you know,
whatever.

1506
01:34:00.741 --> 01:34:01.810
And um,

1507
01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:07.360
originally my sense was that the one time donation is accounted for much more,

1508
01:34:08.930 --> 01:34:13.930
but I'd never actually analyze it because I think I see the alerts that come

1509
01:34:14.271 --> 01:34:18.270
from paypal and sometimes people would send really large one time donations.

1510
01:34:18.271 --> 01:34:21.530
Like things that are totally humbling and enormously generous.

1511
01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:26.480
And I think those kind of you,
you kind of weighed them somehow.

1512
01:34:26.481 --> 01:34:31.370
It's more,
um,
then the cumulative,
some of the smaller donations.

1513
01:34:31.550 --> 01:34:34.790
So I thought the one-timers work much more,
but then,

1514
01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:39.710
and I'm pretty sure that must have been the case earlier high,
right?

1515
01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:43.760
Uh,
but,
and I've had the recurring ones,

1516
01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:47.720
I found a onetime donation for as long as I can remember for as long as they

1517
01:34:47.721 --> 01:34:51.830
basically need it to start making money for the site.
Because by the way,

1518
01:34:51.890 --> 01:34:55.190
running the site cost me several times my rent,

1519
01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:58.850
like all the costs associated with it,
it's like crazy.

1520
01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:01.970
So at one point I got to a point where I had to make money.
I said,

1521
01:35:01.971 --> 01:35:04.970
I don't want to do ads.
I don't believe in that.
I'll have just donations.

1522
01:35:04.971 --> 01:35:08.090
And I didn't even think of recurring ones at the time.
That was years ago.

1523
01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:10.190
And then,
um,

1524
01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:15.320
my friend Max Linsky who runs longform.org or having tea and he said,

1525
01:35:15.321 --> 01:35:17.510
well why didn't you like push the recurring ones more?

1526
01:35:17.511 --> 01:35:21.020
Cause it's working really great for us.
And at that point I had the option,

1527
01:35:21.021 --> 01:35:25.580
but it was buried somewhere on my donation about page or something.

1528
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.781
And so I was like,
okay.

1529
01:35:26.781 --> 01:35:31.670
So I put it in the sidebar and that was the one to say maybe 2011.

1530
01:35:32.210 --> 01:35:34.910
Um,
and it started,
uh,
crying slowly.

1531
01:35:34.911 --> 01:35:37.730
And so this past year when I did my taxes,

1532
01:35:37.731 --> 01:35:42.731
I very reluctantly went to deal with all the paypal tools to get the data out.

1533
01:35:43.061 --> 01:35:47.150
It's basically,
and I actually had Lisa pull all the excels and whatnot,

1534
01:35:47.151 --> 01:35:51.860
and then I did the tally to see,
and to my surprise,
the recurring ones,

1535
01:35:51.861 --> 01:35:54.680
which are very small individual amounts.

1536
01:35:55.190 --> 01:35:58.940
Actually we're two to one ratio to the one time donation.

1537
01:35:59.160 --> 01:35:59.960
<v 1>Wow.</v>

1538
01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:02.390
<v 2>And I don't know at what point it tipped over,</v>

1539
01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:07.820
but I think because of the scale and just how many people have these tiny,

1540
01:36:07.821 --> 01:36:10.730
tiny donations that they contribute every month.

1541
01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:13.640
I mean that's such an active commitment and it's so generous,
you know,

1542
01:36:13.641 --> 01:36:18.530
that they add up and I,
my guess is that as time goes on,

1543
01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:22.460
because the recurring ones have only been available for the last like two and a

1544
01:36:22.461 --> 01:36:23.271
half,
three years,

1545
01:36:23.271 --> 01:36:28.271
whatever they would become by far the larger sort of,

1546
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:32.210
uh,
financial support compared to the single ones.

1547
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:36.430
<v 1>Sure.
No,
that makes sense.
Uh,
the,
if you had to choose,</v>

1548
01:36:36.490 --> 01:36:37.840
and of course this is hypothetical,

1549
01:36:37.841 --> 01:36:40.720
but if you had to choose two of the amounts to leave in the dropdown,

1550
01:36:40.721 --> 01:36:43.840
so you've $7 a month,
$3,
$10,
25.

1551
01:36:43.841 --> 01:36:46.900
If you had to choose two of those to leave up,
which would you choose?

1552
01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:52.410
<v 2>Oh,
I have no idea.
I'm probably just the mathematical,</v>

1553
01:36:52.411 --> 01:36:56.220
logical choice.
The two middle ones,
it,
they're the three and 10.

1554
01:36:56.970 --> 01:37:01.560
<v 1>Okay.
Cool.
No,
just very curious about this kind of thing.
I think,
uh,</v>

1555
01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:06.620
think you've approached the blog in a very authentic way with the content and I

1556
01:37:07.801 --> 01:37:09.630
can't emphasize strongly,

1557
01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:14.220
strongly enough what you just said,
which is you,

1558
01:37:14.370 --> 01:37:19.370
you base what you do on what you would like or dislike as a reader.

1559
01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:22.320
In the case of the,
you know,
something with,
with texts,

1560
01:37:22.321 --> 01:37:24.420
it doesn't have to be super complicated.

1561
01:37:24.421 --> 01:37:27.630
It doesn't have to be doing tons of analytics for months before you make a

1562
01:37:27.631 --> 01:37:30.930
decision.
Just ask yourself,
would this annoy the shit out of me?
If so,

1563
01:37:30.931 --> 01:37:35.120
don't do it.
What?
I love this if,
so try it out.
And

1564
01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:37.980
<v 2>every decision too has been that way.</v>

1565
01:37:37.981 --> 01:37:42.000
And actually in the last couple of years I've been getting really annoyed.

1566
01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:46.560
I mean brainpickings is a pretty sort of low fi site as you can see it just
very,

1567
01:37:46.561 --> 01:37:47.670
super simple,
basic.

1568
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:51.840
But I've been getting annoyed that it doesn't load very well on my iPhone when I

1569
01:37:51.841 --> 01:37:54.990
want to look at something or pull something up to reference or,

1570
01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:58.890
and my friend Scott Belsky who runs the hands,

1571
01:37:58.891 --> 01:38:02.310
he's a great guy and he's been sort of a very generous donor,

1572
01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:07.200
just supporting and you know,
and one time,
uh,
he pulls me aside.

1573
01:38:07.201 --> 01:38:09.120
There was like a thing in February and March and she was like,

1574
01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:11.760
you know how much I love brain pickings but like

1575
01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:14.720
<v 5>the site sucks.
She didn't say it in that way,
but</v>

1576
01:38:15.670 --> 01:38:16.211
<v 2>sweet about it.</v>

1577
01:38:16.211 --> 01:38:20.680
And the key offered to connect me with this guy that he knew that I could hire

1578
01:38:20.681 --> 01:38:22.030
to do a responsive design.

1579
01:38:22.031 --> 01:38:25.750
And I always have this resistance to making these sort of technological

1580
01:38:25.751 --> 01:38:29.890
improvements because then I feel like I don't want to be a media company,

1581
01:38:29.891 --> 01:38:31.570
like I don't want to be a buzzfeed,

1582
01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:37.440
but at the end of the day I as a reader and as a sort of engage or would that

1583
01:38:38.021 --> 01:38:40.210
experience with being annoyed by it myself.

1584
01:38:40.211 --> 01:38:44.770
So now I'm in the middle of releasing like a simple responsive site that is

1585
01:38:44.771 --> 01:38:48.580
actually easy to read on your phone.
And so yeah.

1586
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:53.320
<v 5>Is this fair and frustration prevail?
Again,
innovation</v>

1587
01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:57.040
<v 1>so,
so worth it.
It took me,
let's see,</v>

1588
01:38:57.041 --> 01:39:01.990
it only took me three Oh god,
seven years to get a,

1589
01:39:01.991 --> 01:39:04.930
uh,
a mobile version of the site ready to go,

1590
01:39:05.290 --> 01:39:09.790
which I just launched a month or two ago.
So better late than never,
I suppose.
Uh,

1591
01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:13.300
well Maria,
this has been a blast.
I,
uh,

1592
01:39:13.390 --> 01:39:15.560
I really appreciate you taking the time.
Uh,

1593
01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:20.780
if someone were to want to explore brainpickings uh,

1594
01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:25.090
what,
what are a few articles you might suggest that they start with?
Um,

1595
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:28.340
oh,
a few posts.

1596
01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:31.120
<v 2>Well,
since we talked about it so much,</v>

1597
01:39:31.150 --> 01:39:35.810
it's the Seneca peace about the shortness of life.
It's fairly short team.

1598
01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:39.740
Um,
there's a piece I did a couple of years ago which was less about,

1599
01:39:39.860 --> 01:39:41.480
it was not about a specific book,

1600
01:39:41.481 --> 01:39:44.780
just sort of things that I've been thinking about for a long time.

1601
01:39:45.170 --> 01:39:50.170
This disconnect between purpose and prestige and why we do things right.

1602
01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:53.240
Um,
I forget what it's called.

1603
01:39:53.241 --> 01:39:56.390
I think it's called how to do what you love or some other,

1604
01:39:56.630 --> 01:39:58.490
how to find your purpose and do what you love.

1605
01:39:58.491 --> 01:40:02.120
And it was sort of an assemblage of thoughts on that from various sources as

1606
01:40:02.121 --> 01:40:02.954
well as my own.

1607
01:40:03.170 --> 01:40:08.170
And perhaps most of all a piece that I wrote last fall as on the seventh,

1608
01:40:08.311 --> 01:40:10.530
the seventh birthday really at the site were,

1609
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.810
which was about seven things that I learned in those seven years of reading,

1610
01:40:14.811 --> 01:40:16.100
writing and living,

1611
01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:20.730
<v 1>which is a great article and I didn't want to replicate everything in here.
So I,</v>

1612
01:40:20.731 --> 01:40:24.950
I sort of,
uh,
bobbed and weaved around some of these subjects a little bit,

1613
01:40:24.951 --> 01:40:27.920
but just to reiterate something that you mentioned does,

1614
01:40:27.930 --> 01:40:32.090
and that's doing nothing for prestige or status or money or approval alone.

1615
01:40:32.150 --> 01:40:35.210
And I just want to quote Paul Graham here,
which you included,

1616
01:40:35.211 --> 01:40:35.991
which is prestigious,

1617
01:40:35.991 --> 01:40:39.020
like a powerful magnet that warps even your beliefs about what you enjoy.

1618
01:40:39.021 --> 01:40:42.560
It causes you to work,
not on what you like,
but what you'd like to like,

1619
01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:47.420
which I think is so astute.
And,
um,
in closing

1620
01:40:47.810 --> 01:40:52.810
<v 2>and also I should just interject and say any Alan Watts piece a nod.</v>

1621
01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:57.400
My writing about it is so great or it's not coming from a place of checked me

1622
01:40:57.401 --> 01:41:01.000
out.
It's coming from a place of check him out.
Alan Watts has changed my life.

1623
01:41:01.001 --> 01:41:02.770
I had written about him quite a bit.
Uh,

1624
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:05.020
so highly recommend any of those articles.

1625
01:41:05.310 --> 01:41:10.070
<v 1>Cool.
All right.
brainpickings.org is the site guys,
check it out.
Um,</v>

1626
01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:14.960
Maria,
any parting advice for,
for this,
uh,

1627
01:41:14.970 --> 01:41:18.300
episode,
this portion of our conversation?
But before we,

1628
01:41:18.301 --> 01:41:22.290
before we check out any advice to the people listening out there?
Thoughts,

1629
01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:23.310
parting comments?

1630
01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:28.840
<v 2>No advice per se.
Just I guess a comment and an,
an and a hope,</v>

1631
01:41:28.841 --> 01:41:32.680
which is that,
you know,
thank you so much now just for having me,

1632
01:41:32.681 --> 01:41:37.120
but for having this show and for doing everything that you do and I really hope

1633
01:41:37.121 --> 01:41:41.950
we have more people who operate out of such a place of just,

1634
01:41:42.130 --> 01:41:46.720
I guess for lack of better word,
idealism and conviction and um,

1635
01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:50.410
yeah,
thank you for setting any samples that way.

1636
01:41:50.610 --> 01:41:54.420
<v 1>Oh,
well that means a lot coming from you and I think,</v>

1637
01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:56.970
I think you're a tremendous force for good out there in the world.

1638
01:41:56.971 --> 01:41:59.130
So I hope people check out your work.

1639
01:41:59.131 --> 01:42:01.980
I hope you continue to do what you're doing.

1640
01:42:01.981 --> 01:42:05.640
I hope you continue to add repetitions to your pull ups

1641
01:42:07.350 --> 01:42:10.080
and uh,
we will,
uh,
we will talk again soon.
Sank.
