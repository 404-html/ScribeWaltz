1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.290
That's cool.
So if,
if you were going to taste some of these chocolates,

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.050
how,
how would we go about doing it or what's,

3
00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:08.790
what's the next step down is experiment.

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.700
There's a lot of different ways to taste chocolate.

5
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:14.850
The most important thing is just to sort of take your time and,

6
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.780
and really pay attention to what is going on in your,
in your mouth.
Okay.
Um,

7
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.390
and every time I put a piece of chocolate in my mouth,
really try to just,

8
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.810
just pay attention.
Okay.
So that's,
that's really the most important thing.
And um,

9
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.390
and there's,
you can sort of go either way.
You can,

10
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:36.660
you can go from dark to light.
When you can go from Mike and dark.

11
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.120
I tend to prefer to go dark to light.
So why don't we start with the a 82% extra.

12
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.110
Okay.
All right.

13
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:48.111
So you'd have the cheesier same time or do you put this in a particular place in

14
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:49.254
your mouth?

15
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.090
I Asia for a little bit and then a and I just sort of left the,
uh,

16
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.710
the flavors,
put my tongue and then breed.
Um,

17
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.480
and just try to throw up through my mouth.
Um,
but,
you know,

18
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.970
just sort of just finding friends,
sort of what works for you.

19
00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:09.060
Everyone has sort of a different technique that maximizes their,

20
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.180
their ability to be that since the flavor.
But I want to be,
see,

21
00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:13.540
I can pretend to be a one stop.

22
00:01:13.541 --> 00:01:16.770
Now I'm working on my repertoire for being a chocolate.

23
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.050
I'm missing the vocabulary.
So how would you describe this?
Well,

24
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.030
I like to look at eating chocolate as a,
as a very temporal thing.
And I'll,
I'll,

25
00:01:29.031 --> 00:01:32.580
I'll flavor it really is,
whether it be wine or cheese or chocolate.

26
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.960
So in the beginning of his flavor experience,
uh,
for me,

27
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.270
I noticed that right on the onset there's,

28
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:40.860
there's a lot of sort of three flavors.

29
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.290
It's sort of a dark brown almost.

30
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.400
There's a little bit of a tobacco note in there,
sort of a sweet note.

31
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.510
And it really evolves into a sort of a slight astringency,

32
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.860
um,
a little bit about why note this is definitely a chocolate for it's very

33
00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:05.170
complex,
some of our best means,
um,

34
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.690
and it,
it really has a lingering finish.

35
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.580
Oftentimes tasting a piece of chocolate.

36
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.270
I might want to even leave two or three minutes.
We won't,
we won't do that today.

37
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.520
They really take your take,
take your time to finish.

38
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.200
The finish can really change and,
and more,

39
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.140
even long after you've sort of have it out of your mouth,

40
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.760
like a good Scotch Janell,

41
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:32.970
or help the men on the camera knows this Glidden limit.

42
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.030
I may have to punish them for introducing a good scotch,

43
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:40.620
but it's good in moderation again.
Uh,
so let's,
let's,

44
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:42.540
if you don't mind because I've,
I've had

45
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.900
vast quantities of 70% because I love it.
Yeah.
Let's try something on,

46
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.010
on this scale.
I've never had 75.
I'd actually be curious.
It's just not,

47
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.300
let's try this.
This is also unique.
It's a,

48
00:02:56.301 --> 00:03:00.120
it's a very different blend than any of her other.
Okay.

49
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.230
So now did you travel to each of these countries yourself in,

50
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.030
in the process of sourcing these beans?
MMM,
we asked,
yes.

51
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:23.020
Trinidad Grenada in Dominican.
Republican coastal Venezuela.

52
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.090
Yeah.
Over what period of time,
with the exception of Grenada,

53
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.290
coworker went there.
Well,
this is great.
Now,

54
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.080
how would you contrast that to the 82?
Well,

55
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.180
there are similarities and then it has a 14 us.
Um,

56
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.710
but the,
yeah,
until this bar I really pick up the more of a right flavor.

57
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.510
Um,
it's not as,
it's not as much of a drive.

58
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.010
This is more,
it has,
uh,
some citrus notes.

59
00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.710
If I were going to contrast it to wine,

60
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.890
it seems like that would have more tenants or is this really hot?
It's uh,

61
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.220
and,
and part of that is the hardest part about is the sugar level.
Um,
but,

62
00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.480
but the majority of that difference really lives in the variation between the

63
00:04:14.481 --> 00:04:18.200
beans and beans can be very,
very different.

64
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.070
So if you have,
for example,
a coffee,
right?

65
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.070
So I also liked coffee.

66
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:28.690
We're talking about this before about sourcing coffee and I've been to to coffee

67
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:33.210
plants and
factories and similar in Costa Rica,
Rican,

68
00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:36.820
other places.
So depending on how long you were subbing for,

69
00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:38.200
it can really change the flavor.

70
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.310
So you have these billions that have their own characteristics from each country

71
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.520
and each,
I suppose latitude and so forth.

72
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.900
How important is the duration of roasting or all their beans roasted for roughly

73
00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:54.610
the same amount of time.
Now everything has its own unique profile.

74
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.380
So I've been from Ghana for instance,

75
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.400
it's going to have a different voice time that had been from Madagascar and then

76
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.520
from Java to Venezuela,
Costa Rica.

77
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.360
So each one is very unique and needs to be really looked at.

78
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.230
Okay,
cool.
So do you want to,
what would be your next pic of this month?

79
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.150
Well,
why don't we,
I have to ask you of these.
Yeah.

80
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.630
You had to choose your personal favorites,
of course,
put you on the spot.
Which,

81
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.460
which one would it be?
And understanding that each has its own place.
Sure.

82
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.420
Just like a glass of wine.
Depends on if it's after dinner,
dessert,

83
00:05:31.421 --> 00:05:35.860
wine or whatever.
But what would be your in general,
your indulgence of chose?

84
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.220
Well,
I think I probably,
I probably picked the Antilles.
I really loved the,

85
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.620
it's good.
That's my first time trying it.
That's really,
I mean that just,

86
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.250
I really love that sugar level.
Then when you say 75% okay.

87
00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:53.470
So if it's 75%,
right,

88
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.340
it's a 25% of my volume is roughly,
uh,
if I wait,
I wait.
Yeah.

89
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.440
Okay.
Got It.
And do you,

90
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.900
you mentioned the WHO's luster unless it,

91
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.640
is that an emulsifier?
So what is,
so maybe like a,
you're a chocolate.
Oh,

92
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.230
so what,
what is less than used for,
maybe you could explain what,

93
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.110
what an emulsifier actually does.
An emulsifier in for,

94
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.370
for our purposes is really,
there's a lot of different,

95
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.220
there's a lot of different ingredients that go into chocolate.
Well,

96
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.660
especially when you're looking at,
um,

97
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.380
well in short,

98
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.140
chocolate has fat.
There's also sugar.
Um,

99
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:44.410
and so to really allow those to combine well and it requires an extensive

100
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.510
writing process and also the process known as conscious.
Okay.
Yeah.

101
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.220
And so adding soy lecithin really enables the chocolate.

102
00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.100
How much smoother it allows it to have a better mouthfeel.
Right.
Um,

103
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.850
well it makes sense.
So it's like a,
if you imagine oil and water.
Yeah.

104
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.990
Getting those two mixed properly.
The process of emulsification conscious.

105
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.550
Very cool.
Do you want to try one of these?
Yeah,
let's try the,

106
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.770
let's try the 62 and then we'll to the number and what's a semi sweet.

107
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.650
Sweet is sort of a,

108
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.280
it's a very broadly used term as it's bitter sweet.

109
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.400
So what would those two,
if somebody goes into the store and they say,
okay,

110
00:07:28.401 --> 00:07:31.940
well I know what dark means.
I know milk chocolate means bittersweet.

111
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:36.080
Semisweet no idea.
Yeah.
Well I think,
uh,
I'm going to get a headstart.
Yeah,

112
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:37.510
please send,

113
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.810
my suite is really semi sweet and bitter sweet are very wearable.

114
00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:44.660
It's terms and there are some legal definitions,

115
00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:48.800
but they don't really apply in a lot of ways to some of the,

116
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.870
some of the chocolate that we're looking at here today.
Um,
in,
in reality,

117
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.450
it's really one of the reasons why people are starting to use these percentages

118
00:07:58.451 --> 00:08:02.600
of cocoa is because it really helps people understand exactly how dark chocolate

119
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.300
and,
and,
um,
and so,
uh,

120
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:10.460
semisweet can really run the range from anywhere from 40% cocoa content all the

121
00:08:11.871 --> 00:08:16.400
way to maybe 62
more.

122
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.520
And then a bittersweet can also range from 35 and 40% all the way to 85%.

123
00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:26.370
Wow.
Um,
there's sort of an antiquated term,

124
00:08:26.371 --> 00:08:29.990
so now sort of less than,
it has its own health benefits.
Also,

125
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:34.820
just as an additional excuse for me to continue to eat chocolate.
