00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.850
Optimal at this altitude.

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:06.990
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.
No else.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.920
You posting a question?

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.430
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

5
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.270
<v 1>This podcast is brought to you by four sigmatic.</v>

6
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.680
I reached out to these Finnish folks,
young entrepreneurs for talented.

7
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.700
After a acrobat introduced me to one of their products,

8
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.020
which is mushroom coffee.

9
00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:41.021
This specific one includes Chaga and lion's mane and it knocked my socks off.

10
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:45.230
I highly recommend if you try it,
you start with half a packet.

11
00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:49.580
It's very strong and lights you up like a Christmas tree in the best way

12
00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:50.414
possible.

13
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.740
People are always asking me what I use for cognitive enhancement and for right

14
00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:59.420
now this is the answer.
I try to force this on all of my house guests.

15
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.770
It is a hell of a thing.

16
00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:04.520
If I have employees or people come over who are working on projects with me,

17
00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:08.390
I always try to feed it to them because I'm going to get the limitless effect

18
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.070
and get a lot more out of them.

19
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.080
The first time I mentioned this product and four sigmatic on the podcast,

20
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.270
their products sold out in less than a week,

21
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.490
so you may want to check them out soon.

22
00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:22.790
If you're listening to this and the coffee tastes like coffee,

23
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.520
it takes just seconds to prepare with hot water.

24
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.690
And oddly enough,
only includes 40 milligrams of caffeine.

25
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:33.540
So it has less than half of what you would get in a regular cup of coffee.

26
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.920
I don't get any jitters,
acid reflux or any stomach burn,
any of that.

27
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.290
It's very unusual and very,
very cool.

28
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.060
So if you don't like caffeine,
they also offer very strong,

29
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:48.690
but caffeine free mushroom elixirs,
which I will sometimes have in the evening.

30
00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:52.110
I find Chaga specifically to be very,
very grounding and earthy.

31
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.720
So that is another option.
And I have a cupboard full of their products,
uh,

32
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.470
at the moment,
which is right around the corner of my kitchen.

33
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.860
You can try something,
you can try a sample pack,
which is great.

34
00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:06.300

38
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.020
If you are in the experimental mindset,
I do not think you'll be disappointed,

39
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.003
so try them.

40
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.530
This episode is brought to you by audible,
which I've used for many,
many years.

41
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.160
I absolutely love audio books in there.

42
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.290
One of my favorite ways to pass the time when I travel,

43
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.580
I'm on the road all the time and audible allows me to consume many more books

44
00:02:39.581 --> 00:02:41.410
than I possibly could otherwise.

45
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.140
I've two audio books to recommend right off the bat.

46
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.890
The first is perhaps my favorite audio book of all time and it's the only

47
00:02:47.891 --> 00:02:50.470
audiobook I've wanted to listen to twice in a row.

48
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.970
The graveyard book by Neil Gaiman.
It's amazing and you will thank me.

49
00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.890
There are a few different versions.

50
00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.950
I like the version that Neil narrates himself,

51
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.500
one of the most soothing voices of all time.

52
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.480
The second book is vagabonding by Rolf Potts,
p,
O,
t,
t,
s,

53
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:11.020
which had a huge impact on my life and formed the basis for a lot of what would

54
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:13.060
later become the four hour workweek.

55
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.010
So go to audible.com forward slash Tim and you can choose one of these two books

56
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.570
or any of many,
many other options that could be books,
magazines,

57
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.510
and much more.

Hey,
hello ladies and germs.

65
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:52.780
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

66
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:56.770
My dog Molly is staring me directly in the face from three feet away,

67
00:03:56.771 --> 00:04:01.060
but that is not relevant to this particular introduction.
The Tim Ferriss show.

68
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.200
What is it?
Well.

69
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.490
My job is every episode to deconstruct world class performers,

70
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:10.960
people who are the best at what they do to give you tactics,
routines,

71
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:15.670
habits,
Cetera that you can apply immediately in test in your own lives.

72
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.620
This particular episode has been requested in requested and requested.

73
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.420
People ask me,
Tim,

74
00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:25.390
why aren't you talking about relationships when you're going to talk about

75
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:27.640
relationships?
Why are you so private?

76
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:29.920
Why are you dodging the questions will no longer.
Folks,

77
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.640
I am going to speak with Esther Perel.

78
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:38.641
I've wanted to speak with this particular psychotherapist for many years and for

79
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:39.754
good reason.

80
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.920
She has been called the most important game changer in sexuality and relational

81
00:04:44.921 --> 00:04:49.921
health since Doctor Ruth by the New York Times who featured her in a cover

82
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:51.310
story,
her ted talks,

83
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.900
one of which she actually basically winged off the cuff,

84
00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:56.890
which is amazing to me.

85
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.780
Her talks on maintaining desire and rethinking infidelity of more than 17

86
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.740
million views and she's tested and been exposed to everything imaginable in 34

87
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:10.270
years of running her private therapy practice in New York City.
In this episode,

88
00:05:10.271 --> 00:05:13.840
we explore everything imaginable.
We talk about her life story,

89
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.170
how to find and convinced mentors who can change your life.
For instance,

90
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.570
what she's learned from Holocaust survivors,

91
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.840
but then we get into what she is very much known for.

92
00:05:22.841 --> 00:05:26.320
We discuss topics like polyamory and in all of its close cousins.

93
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.330
Is there such a thing as too much honesty in relationships we answered or

94
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:33.850
attempt to answer questions like,
can we want what we already have?

95
00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:37.330
Why do happy people cheat and much,
much more.
She has many,

96
00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:41.560
many case studies because she's been practicing this in the real world and messy

97
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:42.910
reality for so long.

98
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:46.930
A little bit of background on Esther who have had a chance to spend time with in

99
00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:51.910
personnel and is just more impressive.
The more time I spend with her.

100
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.710
She's the author of the international bestseller mating in captivity.

101
00:05:56.711 --> 00:06:00.110
Many of you have heard of this.
It's been translated into 26 languages.

102
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.330
She is fluent in nine of them.

103
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.170
I've heard her in person do this in a crowded room going from person to person

104
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:08.840
in different languages.
It blows my mind,
has a language nut.

105
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.610
This Belgian native now brings her multicultural pulse to a new book,

106
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.240
the state of affairs and subtitle,
rethinking infidelity,

107
00:06:18.241 --> 00:06:23.040
which is out October,
2017 through Harper Collins.
Right now though,

108
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:28.070
what you can check out of hers and you should check out is a brand new audible

109
00:06:29.051 --> 00:06:31.780
original audio series.
Where should we begin?

110
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:37.130
And she's cocreating this and hosting it,
uh,
with audible.

111
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.190
And this looks at specific couples and walks you through their issues and how

112
00:06:42.261 --> 00:06:46.280
she would recommend they address them.
So check that out.
Where should we begin?

113
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.230
You can say hello to her on the socials at Facebook for instance,
dot com,

114
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.300
forward slash S.
Dot.
Parell p.
E.
R.
E.
L.
But I had a blast with this.

115
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.290
It's going to ax expose my,
my sensitive,

116
00:07:01.291 --> 00:07:04.020
vulnerable underbelly for those people who have been asking for all this

117
00:07:04.021 --> 00:07:08.040
relationship stuff.
So feel free to ridicule me on the Internet.

118
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.840
Usually don't even have to ask.

119
00:07:09.841 --> 00:07:12.480
That just comes with this job that I've created for myself.

120
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.250
So without further ado,

121
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.550
please enjoy this wide ranging conversation with as their parole,

122
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.390
as they're welcome to the show.

123
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:28.130
I am thrilled to finally have connected with you and you have one of the hottest

124
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.670
possible areas of expertise imaginable.

125
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.510
And there's so many questions that I would like to ask and so many questions

126
00:07:36.511 --> 00:07:38.040
that my fans would like to ask.

127
00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:42.360
But I thought we could start with a bit of background and if you could tell us

128
00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:47.361
just a bit about where you grew up and what your childhood was like.

129
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.150
I think that'd be good as context to get us started.

130
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.120
<v 2>So,
um,
I grew up in Antwerp in Belgium mostly,</v>

131
00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:00.250
um,
and two of his,
the Flemish part of Belgium.
Um,

132
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.660
and I was there til I finished high school.
I grew up with,

133
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:09.600
I have a big brother who is 12 years older than me,
so I was the,

134
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:14.930
the young girl and my parents who were actually Polish refugees who came to

135
00:08:15.491 --> 00:08:18.970
Belgium after the war.
I'm from Belgium,

136
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.190
a move to Jerusalem.

137
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:26.820
And I studied at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and I lived there for almost

138
00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:31.660
six years.
And then I came to Cambridge,

139
00:08:31.661 --> 00:08:35.320
Massachusetts to finish my master's degree.
And,
um,

140
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.860
and I really thought I was coming for one year to America.

141
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:43.240
Um,
but that one year became two years in Cambridge.

142
00:08:43.241 --> 00:08:46.900
And then after that I came to New York and I thought I would do that for one

143
00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:51.820
year because I wanted to have the New York experience and I never used my return

144
00:08:51.821 --> 00:08:53.170
ticket.
Here I am.

145
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.290
<v 1>You're still having the New York.
I'm still heading the York fans.</v>

146
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:02.300
Exactly to you as I understand it grew up among Holocaust survivors and,

147
00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:10.260
and I would love to hear you elaborate on that experience and what it was like,

148
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:18.420
what you,
what you learned from it.
And uh,
and then we can talk about,

149
00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:19.620
I'd like to talk about Jerusalem,

150
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.800
but I am am very interested as many people are in the history of the Holocaust.

151
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:30.150
But even more than that,
the,
the personal experience,

152
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:34.230
the lived experience and there's a book called if this is a man and there's

153
00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:36.960
another book called the truce,
both the written by Primo Levy,

154
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:41.220
which was recommended to me by the illusionist David Blaine,

155
00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:42.360
who actually has primo levies,

156
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.520
inmate number or prisoner number tattooed on his forum.

157
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.640
And it was one of the most impactful books I would say I've read in the last 10

158
00:09:50.641 --> 00:09:55.620
years,
but I have no direct experience with Holocaust survivors.

159
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.080
What was that?
What was that like and what did you learn?

160
00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.670
<v 2>Hmm,
so interesting that we're starting from there.</v>

161
00:10:01.671 --> 00:10:04.070
So I think that if this was a man by Kramer,

162
00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:08.780
Lavey is one of the most powerful books a one ought to read.

163
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.220
I think it's a,
it's a unique,
unique,
a testament.

164
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.130
So it's very simple.

165
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.540
There were 60,000 Jews in Belgium before the war.
Uh,

166
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.130
the vast majority of them were decimated,
uh,

167
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:27.170
throughout the war and in camps.

168
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:32.470
And so after the war in group of Eastern European Jews basically came to Belgium

169
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.510
for two.
All kinds of means.
That's kind of where they arrived.

170
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.900
And my parents who were both the sole survivors of their entire family,

171
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.690
which means 200 people lost,
I guess on every side.

172
00:10:47.691 --> 00:10:49.910
They were both the youngest in their families.

173
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.180
My mother was in the camps from 18 to 22,

174
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.720
and my father from a 25 to 31 actually because the worst started very early for

175
00:10:59.631 --> 00:11:01.310
them.
So they,
the,

176
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:06.380
they came with nothing to buy,
to be there for three months.

177
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:10.520
They were illegal refugees.
No,
they were illegal refugees for three months.

178
00:11:10.521 --> 00:11:14.540
We're meant to continue from there to other countries where they had been given

179
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.870
refugee status,
but they didn't,
they chose not to leave.

180
00:11:17.871 --> 00:11:22.370
And so they stayed for another five years as,
as illegal refugees in Belgium,

181
00:11:22.371 --> 00:11:27.260
which is very telling for me right now with what's going on in our country here.

182
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:32.630
Um,
and I'm born later.
So when I am born in 58,

183
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.870
they already found a way to legalize themselves,

184
00:11:35.871 --> 00:11:38.840
to become a Belgian citizens.
And,
um,

185
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.390
and I grew up in a different environment,

186
00:11:41.391 --> 00:11:46.391
but I am growing up in a community of 20,000 Jews that are all Holocaust

187
00:11:46.521 --> 00:11:50.060
survivors.
That's basically all we knew in the Jewish community.

188
00:11:50.061 --> 00:11:54.250
Of course there was the larger Belgian community around.
Um,

189
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.090
and you know,
you saw numbers,
you asked,

190
00:11:58.091 --> 00:12:02.710
why don't we have grandparents?
You asked whether these numbers you,
you,

191
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:07.210
um,
you know,
they,
it was kind of in the,
in,
in,

192
00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.320
he'd came with mother's milk is the best way I could say it.

193
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:15.040
It was so ever present.
We spoke Yiddish,
German,
Polish,

194
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.030
French and Flemish in my home.
Uh,

195
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.790
depending on the subject matter we changed and depending on who we're speaking

196
00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:25.660
to whom the language change,
but they were,
they were five vibrant,

197
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:29.080
interchangeable languages going on the whole time.

198
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.830
And if you can imagine that the language is a door to a world,

199
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:37.180
then you can imagine how many words were coexisting at the same time.

200
00:12:37.181 --> 00:12:40.480
That had nothing to do with each other.
Actually.
Um,

201
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.930
I grew up above the store in a,

202
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.560
because most of the Jews of Antwerp,
we're actually are in the diamond business.

203
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.770
Uh,
my family was among the 2% that were not.

204
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.910
And so they had clothing stores and I grew up in the neighborhood where they

205
00:12:54.911 --> 00:12:56.500
were two Jewish families.

206
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.120
So it's like the Deli store with the foreigner in the neighborhood,
you know,

207
00:13:01.121 --> 00:13:04.270
and you know who they are,
the two foreigners and they have an accent.

208
00:13:04.271 --> 00:13:08.870
And they look different and the whole thing.
And I lived above the store and,

209
00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:13.690
and in this very popular,
um,
neighborhoods,
um,

210
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.660
lower middle class neighborhood.
Um,

211
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:21.130
and where we spoke actually not even just Flemish,
but we spoke dialect,

212
00:13:21.131 --> 00:13:22.270
Flemish from the street,

213
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:26.380
like from the hood and the equivalent of the hood basically.

214
00:13:26.381 --> 00:13:30.500
And I would straddle back and forth.
You know,
the,

215
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.450
one of the ways I can describe it is my father,
when he turned 50,

216
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:36.070
he had two birthday parties.

217
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:41.110
One birthday party was for his Jewish survivor friends that took place in

218
00:13:41.111 --> 00:13:43.420
Yiddish and in Polish.
And with a lot of vodka,

219
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:49.030
one birthday party was with his Flemish friends.
And that was in dialect.

220
00:13:49.031 --> 00:13:53.800
And with a lot of beer
and by the code,

221
00:13:53.801 --> 00:13:54.760
by the drinks,

222
00:13:54.761 --> 00:13:58.990
you knew exactly which words you were traveling in and how,

223
00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.390
how you had to behave and,
uh,

224
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:06.130
how much you could show that side of you versus the other side of you.
Um,

225
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:10.840
and you know,
and there was a sense I think maybe more than anything,

226
00:14:10.841 --> 00:14:12.940
when you grow up in that kind of a community,
you,

227
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:18.630
you grew up with the notion of impermanence that what is today could disappear

228
00:14:19.341 --> 00:14:23.680
at any moment.
I think that's probably one of the strongest experiences.

229
00:14:23.681 --> 00:14:28.450
You don't ever think that there is a notion of,
uh,
you know,

230
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.180
what is now will be there tomorrow.
You'd never know.

231
00:14:31.181 --> 00:14:35.500
And so you learn to adapt to that notion of impermanence,

232
00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:40.590
of insecurity if you want.
And,
um,
and my parents were,

233
00:14:40.591 --> 00:14:44.230
were both evolved.
You know,
they loved life.
They didn't survive for nothing.

234
00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:49.210
They were going to enjoy at best.
And,
uh,
um,
as I have often said,

235
00:14:49.211 --> 00:14:51.250
they understood the erotic as an antidote.

236
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.600
Death as in they knew how to keep themselves alive and,

237
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.360
and then enjoy.
They were not,
everybody was like that.

238
00:14:59.361 --> 00:15:02.900
You had very different kind of moods.
They were storytellers.

239
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.830
So people would come from everywhere and they would tell about their life and

240
00:15:06.831 --> 00:15:09.170
their experiences and they were good story tellers,

241
00:15:09.171 --> 00:15:11.120
which means that they knew how to screen out.

242
00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:15.470
And two could make you laugh and they didn't make you completely tense when you

243
00:15:15.471 --> 00:15:18.590
would listen.
And everybody wanted to know their stories.

244
00:15:18.591 --> 00:15:23.020
They were amazing,
amazing,
amazing stories of,
of,

245
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.220
of survival,
of,
uh,
of subversion of,
you know,
my dad was illiterate,

246
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.260
he spoke five languages,

247
00:15:30.261 --> 00:15:34.040
but he was basically illiterate and he was a grand grand,

248
00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:36.050
a human being,
you know,

249
00:15:36.051 --> 00:15:41.051
who had done a lot and had saved quantities of people because yeah,

250
00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:46.220
I would say maybe the best,
the strongest value,
uh,

251
00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:50.350
in that,
in,
in,
in that community or not the strongest.

252
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.710
We're one of the very strong values.
One was definitely decency,
you know,

253
00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:57.500
how you behave towards your fellow other people.

254
00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:00.510
And the other one was,
uh,
um,

255
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:05.340
how would you say that in English to manage sweet,
smart to be street smart,

256
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.050
you know,
to know,

257
00:16:07.051 --> 00:16:12.051
to survive basically to find your way out of situations and to be able to,

258
00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.201
to survive.

259
00:16:13.201 --> 00:16:18.201
Survival was the central organizing experience of all these people.

260
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.960
And then the second experience was revival.

261
00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:25.000
<v 1>So many different directions that I would love to take this.</v>

262
00:16:25.001 --> 00:16:29.660
So I'll try to do it one at a time.
Dialect,
Flemish from the hood.

263
00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:34.690
Could you give us any example of what street Flemish sounds like?

264
00:16:35.621 --> 00:16:36.454
Correct.

265
00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:38.550
<v 2>Well,
I think that is efficacy man's vibes.</v>

266
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.250
<v 1>What so what did you just say?</v>

267
00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:46.140
<v 2>Yes,
dude.
Do you want me to say this in Antwon,
in Antrop dialect?</v>

268
00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.660
<v 1>How would you say?
How are you in like what's up?</v>

269
00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.230
Say that one more time.
Who called it?
Oh boy,
yes,
I'll,

270
00:16:56.231 --> 00:16:59.830
I'll save my embarrassing rehearsal for when we meet in person.

271
00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:01.563
<v 2>Did that element</v>

272
00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.510
and that can cook Alamo Vincent's Fifth Element and they're going to get tokens

273
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.080
in dangles efficacy.

274
00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.410
<v 1>I think you might've just insulted my ancestors,</v>

275
00:17:12.411 --> 00:17:13.700
but I'm not sure what just happened.

276
00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:18.240
<v 2>I said I could say all of this in Antrop dialect,</v>

277
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.880
but in order to be sure we all understand it,

278
00:17:20.881 --> 00:17:22.800
I'm going to tell my stories in English.

279
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:26.360
<v 1>That is a fantastic idea,
so thank you for that.
I love languages,</v>

280
00:17:26.361 --> 00:17:29.150
so I just wanted to hear something that I had never heard before.

281
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:34.280
You mentioned that your parents were sole survivors in their families.

282
00:17:34.281 --> 00:17:38.550
If I heard you correctly,
when you look at your parents,

283
00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.660
uh,
and I,
I don't know if it was simply because of their age,
uh,

284
00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.230
or or other factors,
but when you look at your parents,

285
00:17:46.231 --> 00:17:50.640
so that would be the primary focus,
but at end at other soul survivors,

286
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:56.010
<v 2>what did they credit the survival too?
Oh,
that is a great question.</v>

287
00:17:56.011 --> 00:18:00.600
I did go to,
I did get to ask them this question.
So mmm.

288
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:01.890
My mother,

289
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:07.010
she first spent one year in the woods at 18 running from farm to farm hiding in

290
00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:09.280
the woods of Poland.

291
00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:14.340
And then she was so terrified that she actually surrendered by herself to a

292
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:16.680
camp,
to a labor camp,

293
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:22.160
to a man's camp because she thought if I am in a camp at least probably will put

294
00:18:22.741 --> 00:18:26.820
me in the kitchens or in the laundry and I could at least wake up every morning

295
00:18:26.821 --> 00:18:31.470
in the same place.
My mother ended up going to nine different labor camps now,

296
00:18:31.471 --> 00:18:35.040
labor camps where generally next door to the concentration camps and as long as

297
00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:36.850
you could work,
you were in labor camp.

298
00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:41.490
If you were not selected that morning for transport then you could continue
work.

299
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:44.700
But the distinction is often a very narrow distinction.

300
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:48.870
And my father was in 14 camps,
um,

301
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:54.080
and my mother definitely so the rest of their families was either a guest in

302
00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:00.810
Treblinka or in um,
honestly it's basically his family in Auschwitz,

303
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.230
her family and Treblinka.
And um,

304
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:08.590
my mother would say it was a company,
nation of premonition dreams.

305
00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.640
She was very,

306
00:19:09.641 --> 00:19:14.530
very superstitious and she really believed her dreams that would tell her

307
00:19:14.531 --> 00:19:18.790
tomorrow,
don't go there tomorrow,
be a little bit late there tomorrow.

308
00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:22.540
Make sure to have an extra layer of newspaper on your feet because it's going to

309
00:19:22.541 --> 00:19:23.800
be really,
really cold.

310
00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.790
She had all these premonitions dreams of her father talking to her and things

311
00:19:27.791 --> 00:19:31.810
like that.
And she will always say chance came first.

312
00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:32.951
My father too.

313
00:19:32.951 --> 00:19:37.720
I think ultimately both of them said chance came first and then there was what

314
00:19:37.721 --> 00:19:41.380
you did with the chance that was given to you.
Right.

315
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:42.730
Um,

316
00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:46.840
and so there was always a mixture between choice and coincidence,

317
00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.930
choice and chance.
And um,

318
00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:54.040
my mother said she always made sure that she was clean,

319
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:57.520
that she was groomed,
that she was mending her socks,

320
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.250
that she maintained her humanity,

321
00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:05.670
that she didn't allow herself to become the humanized and degraded the way that

322
00:20:05.831 --> 00:20:09.770
she was being treated by the night.
And my father,

323
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.230
um,
my father,
when we were,

324
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:16.160
we went to visit Auschwitz actually ended up telling me a story of,

325
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.790
of a Dutch convoy that arrived of women.

326
00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:25.100
And he somehow picked a woman out of the crowd and he decided that he would help

327
00:20:25.101 --> 00:20:29.450
this woman and basically the next day they were shaven.

328
00:20:29.451 --> 00:20:32.780
And so he couldn't even recognize her.
So he asked the capable,

329
00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.980
who is the other woman that he had mentioned notice the day before?

330
00:20:36.981 --> 00:20:38.900
And they began some correspondence,

331
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:41.720
which I have no idea how he wrote because he couldn't write.

332
00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.210
And I never bothered asking him who wrote for you?

333
00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:49.540
But he fell in love with this woman and he just decided that they were certain

334
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:54.130
things that,
that the Germans can take away from him.
Um,

335
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.930
and that had to do with feelings and we'd love in the most dire of
circumstances.

336
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:00.340
Um,

337
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:05.050
and then he basically developed this black market in one of the camps where he

338
00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:08.170
was with his best friend,
where they were for almost a year and a half,

339
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:13.620
where he ended up feeding 60 young men who would otherwise not have had enough

340
00:21:13.811 --> 00:21:16.540
to eat and therefore to work and therefore to survive.

341
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.480
And he ended up feeding the Nazis too.

342
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.870
So when he got caught with those letters,

343
00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:27.280
one of the Germans basically sent him back to the factories and said,

344
00:21:27.281 --> 00:21:30.120
you're not staying in here.
You can factories manager,

345
00:21:30.121 --> 00:21:33.610
do you have one week to live?
Basically.
And uh,

346
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.910
but he had been feeding the German guy so well that the guy said,

347
00:21:36.911 --> 00:21:40.480
I eat better when you work in the kitchens and he put him back in the kitchen.

348
00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:46.970
And so you always said it was a combination of chance and ingenuity streetsmart

349
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:52.330
what he would call.
Um,
and,
and doing for others,

350
00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:58.290
doing for others give you a purpose to stay alive and to wake up in the morning.

351
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.240
If you look at then the survivors,

352
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:08.860
whether by chance first like you mentioned choice,

353
00:22:08.861 --> 00:22:13.861
some combination of those factors and others you mentioned survival and revival.

354
00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:21.150
When you look at the survivors who ended up being able to revive themselves and

355
00:22:24.071 --> 00:22:25.330
to,
and who did not.

356
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:31.210
So the third reason my mother always said is that she always thought that they

357
00:22:31.211 --> 00:22:34.870
wanted her to stay alive because if the others were not going to be make it,

358
00:22:34.871 --> 00:22:37.330
they needed to be at least someone from the family.

359
00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:41.080
And she always thought that she would somehow be reunited with somebody.

360
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:46.340
So she maintained this very deep connection inside of her,
um,

361
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.770
that they were waiting for her somewhere.
Um,

362
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.590
then they realize that there was nobody.
So I,
you know,

363
00:22:53.591 --> 00:22:57.670
it's an interesting question that I organized in my mind like this.

364
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:03.340
And I organized it when I was actually writing,
meeting,
uh,
my first book,

365
00:23:03.341 --> 00:23:04.450
mating in captivity.

366
00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:09.530
I the time I had a conversation with my husband and I who was working with

367
00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.380
survivors of torture and political violence,
and I would ask him,

368
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:19.470
when do you know that people come back and what does it mean to come back?

369
00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.400
Right?
Come back from,

370
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:24.280
from different war zones to come back from having been kidnapped,

371
00:23:24.281 --> 00:23:28.870
to come back from solitary confinement and w and what does it mean to come back

372
00:23:28.871 --> 00:23:32.290
to life.
And then as we were talking,
you know,

373
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:35.740
it became very clear that when you reconnect with life,

374
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.950
not just when you are surviving,
but when you are living,

375
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.250
it means that you once again able to take risks,

376
00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:46.400
able to broach out,
go into the world,

377
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:51.380
able to play because you cannot play if you are in a constant state of vigilance

378
00:23:51.381 --> 00:23:54.380
and guardedness and able to trust.

379
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:57.920
And then I thought to myself,
oh my God,

380
00:23:57.921 --> 00:24:00.890
this is so much what I saw in Antwerp.
You know,

381
00:24:00.891 --> 00:24:05.660
I remember since my entire classroom where children of similar families that

382
00:24:05.661 --> 00:24:09.110
they were always two groups of families in my community.

383
00:24:09.111 --> 00:24:11.300
And then I decided that I would call this,

384
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:16.810
there was one group that did not die and one group that came back to life and

385
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:21.500
the did not die.
You could feel it when you went to their houses.
You know,

386
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:24.620
they often had plastics over the,
the couches and the,

387
00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.600
the curtains were pulled down.
It was more bit,
it was just,
you know,
you,

388
00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.450
you're not dead but you not celebrating yet.

389
00:24:32.451 --> 00:24:35.590
Life you certainly are not enjoying because if you enjoy,

390
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:40.550
then you are not being careful and you have guilt.
You often have survivor guilt.

391
00:24:40.551 --> 00:24:43.850
Why am I here?
And none of the others made it.
Um,

392
00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:48.020
and you are way too down in the world is a dangerous place and you are not to

393
00:24:48.021 --> 00:24:50.870
trust anyone outside the family.
And all of that.

394
00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.010
And then I taught there is those who came back to life.
And that's,

395
00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.840
that's what led me actually to really want to explore what is erotic racism?

396
00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:00.410
What is this antidote to that?

397
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:05.411
How in the face of adversity do you continue to imagine yourself and you know,

398
00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:11.190
rising above it,
connected to joy,
to love,
to pleasure,
uh,

399
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:15.350
to beauty,
to adventure,
to mystery,
to all of that.

400
00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.850
And um,
and that,
those people,
you know,
it was very interesting,

401
00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:23.240
you had people who came together because they were the survivors of this camp

402
00:25:23.241 --> 00:25:24.530
and the survivors of that cap.

403
00:25:24.531 --> 00:25:28.850
And then you had people who came together for this kind of holiday or that kind

404
00:25:28.851 --> 00:25:33.530
of celebration.
And they never discussed their experiences.
It was all implicit,

405
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:39.020
but they were together.
Andy,
they were charging ahead at life.

406
00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.780
You know,
the first thing they did when they would come out of the camps,

407
00:25:41.781 --> 00:25:46.490
by the way,
is have a child because I'm alone.
You're alone.
I have nothing.

408
00:25:46.491 --> 00:25:49.040
You have nothing.
Let's get married and let's have children.

409
00:25:49.041 --> 00:25:52.550
Because if we have a child and we know that we are still human,

410
00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:57.140
we are able to procreate and we create legacy and they didn't kill everything

411
00:25:57.141 --> 00:26:00.080
off.
And so my parents,
you know,

412
00:26:00.081 --> 00:26:03.110
they planted trees in all kinds of places in the world.

413
00:26:03.111 --> 00:26:06.950
They put plaques on in the memory of all the other people have their families.
