Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:06.060
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.560
I'm a cybernetic organism.

4
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.790
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by 99 designs,</v>

5
00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:29.060
your one stop shop for all things graphic design related.

6
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.120
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers including

7
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.790
sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

8
00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:41.780
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

9
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.630
the brainstorming.

10
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.950
A lot of it took place with designers from around the world and here's how it

11
00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:49.220
works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,

12
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.730
a website and APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

13
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.450
you submit that project and designers from around the world.

14
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.090
We'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

15
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.780
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

16
00:01:02.781 --> 00:01:03.440
money back.

17
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.220
It's that straightforward and many of you who are listening have already used it

18
00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:09.710
and created some amazing things that I'll be sharing in the future.

19
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.350
But in the meantime,
if you want to see some of my competitions,

20
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.430

21
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.370
goto 99 designs.com forward slash Tim,

22
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.490

<v 0>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.940
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.
I get asked all the time,</v>

25
00:01:28.941 --> 00:01:31.130
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

26
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.040
And my answer is inevitably Athletic Greens,

27
00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:36.530
it is your all in one nutritional insurance.

28
00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:38.270
I recommended it in the four hour body,

29
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.290
did not get paid for that and I travel with it to avoid getting sick.

30
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.320
I take it in the mornings to ensure optimal performance.

31
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.790
It just covers all my basis.

32
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.810
If I can't get what I need through whole food meals throughout the rest of the

33
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.640
day,
and you can get 50 oh my God,
50% off.
Yes,
50% off.

34
00:01:55.641 --> 00:02:00.641

37
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.220

takes a load off my mind,

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.820
Hello my frisky little kittens.

40
00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:25.790
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

41
00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:30.320
it is my job to deconstruct world class performers to tease out through teens

42
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.221
the habits,

43
00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:35.660
the influences such as favorite books and so on that have made them good at what

44
00:02:35.661 --> 00:02:36.320
they do.

45
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.060
And the intention of course is to unearth the things that you can borrow that

46
00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:42.620
you can replicate in your own life.

47
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.790
A [inaudible] and the guests range from chess prodigies to hedge fund managers

48
00:02:47.841 --> 00:02:51.950
to celebs to fill in the blank.
And this time we have a fill in the blank,

49
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:55.430
which is a worldclass entrepreneur,
builder and investor.

50
00:02:55.431 --> 00:02:57.320
His name is naval Ravikant.

51
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.780
Naval is the CEO Cofounder of Angel List.
He is a close friend,

52
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:06.100
has become an even closer friend because I am now an advisor to angel list.

53
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.420
He previously cofounded Epinions which went public as part of shopping.com and

54
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.800
vast.com also,

55
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.030
he has a very active angel investor and not surprisingly and has invested more

56
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:20.470
than 100 companies,
including more than a handful of Unicorn,

57
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.090
so called Unicorn Mega,
mega,
mega,
Mega I think on the sat.
Again,
mega successes,

58
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.540
his deals include Twitter,
Uber,
Yammer,
Postmates,
wish,

59
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.850
thumbtack and open DNS,

60
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.090
which Cisco just bought for 635 million in cash.

61
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.590
There are many more and you can find many examples on his angel list page,

62
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.390
which is just angel.co forward slash novel if you want to see mine.

63
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.420
It is a angel.co forward slash Tim and Angel List is one of the most incredible

64
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.040
tools for investing matching opportunities and investors that I've ever,

65
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.830
I've ever seen.
And it's very,
very disruptive to the venture capital space.
Uh,

66
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.580
there were I think around 10 people who were introduced to Uber Way back in the

67
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.510
day as investors.
And given the opportunity on angel list,
this was around 2010.

68
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.740
Uh,
I have led a couple of deals including ship,
s,
h y p.

69
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:19.360
You can check them out at [inaudible] dot com which is I think around 40 x up in

70
00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:23.530
its valuation from the first time that I put it on Angel List and made it

71
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:27.340
available to people like yourselves,
uh,
uh,
who are accredited investors.

72
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.720
So you can check out all of my startup deals at angel.co/tim but let's talk

73
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:35.770
about Nepal and why he's on the podcast now falls on the podcast because he is a

74
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:40.771
very deep thinker who is very good at asking questions and testing.

75
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.543
In other words,

76
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.970
questioning the obvious and that practice and the practice of being hyper

77
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:53.080
rational and other people are emotional,

78
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.010
has allowed him to be very successful in the world of investing.

79
00:04:57.011 --> 00:05:00.910
But it translates to many other sectors of life and business.

80
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:05.710
And that is why even if you have no interest in early stage investing,
I highly,

81
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:09.880
highly encourage you to listen to this.
Much like the Chris Saka episode,
uh,

82
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.800
Novalis had a huge impact on my own thinking about the world and startups and

83
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:17.740
investing.
But not only money,
my time,
my energy,

84
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.820
and he's been very much a mentor in that capacity in many others.

85
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.030
So I hope that my enthusiasm and enjoyment in this interview translates to the

86
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:28.534
same for you.

87
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.190
He is a treasure trove of many recommendations and a there you will probably

88
00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:35.070
take down a lot of notes,
uh,

89
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.460
but you can find the links to the books and so on in the show notes.

90
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:42.880
And the show notes are@fourhourworkweek.com forward slash podcast,

91
00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:46.990
all spelled out,
four hour work week.com forward slash podcast.

92
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.790
And without further ado,
please enjoy Deval Ravi con

93
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.010
neval welcome to the show.
Thanks for having me,
Tim.

94
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.400
I have really been looking forward to this because I always enjoy sitting down

95
00:06:02.891 --> 00:06:07.060
in this somewhat artificial,
formal setting to talk with close friends.
