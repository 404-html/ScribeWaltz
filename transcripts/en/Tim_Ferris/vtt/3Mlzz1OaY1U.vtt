1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.860
I'm asked quite a bit these days.
What should I follow up?

2
00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:08.910
Meaning the person asking the question,
slow carb diet or Ketogenic Diet.

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.990
And I've talked a lot about ketosis and the Ketogenic Diet in tools of titans on

4
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:16.050
the podcast when people like dom D'Agostino,

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.770
Dominic D'Agostino among others and various scientists and mds.

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.230
Here's the answer.
I think that for 90 plus percent of the people out there,

7
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:26.820
the slow carb diet is the way to go.

8
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.820
Slow carb diet is still what I primarily follow.

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.370
When should you use the Ketogenic Diet?

10
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.170
I found the ketogenic diet most helpful when a,

11
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.470
I was suffering from severe symptoms of Lyme disease,

12
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:44.470
which was diagnosed on long island where I had removed six embedded tech.

13
00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:45.960
So it was not psychosomatic.

14
00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:50.700
It wasn't misdiagnosed and that was the only thing after around,

15
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.740
of course,
proper antibiotic treatment in this case,
I think it was Doxycyclin

16
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.480
that help to,
uh,

17
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.610
mitigate and remove largely the cognitive decline or effectively dementia that I

18
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:07.110
felt as well as joint pain.

19
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.390
Ketones and the ketones and Ketogenic Diet in general have very strong

20
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.080
antiinflammatory effect.
And for even some conditions like say Alzheimer's.

21
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.400
There are people who believe if you look at Alzheimer's as say type three

22
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:23.130
diabetes or brain diabetes is some people do that.

23
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:28.131
When you offer ketones as an alternate fuel source to a brain that can no longer

24
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.750
metabolize or utilize glucose properly,

25
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.810
you can address many of the symptoms,

26
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.870
so ketogenic diet for me is when I have a medical condition or a problem I

27
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:42.240
cannot seem to fix via other means.

28
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.690
I will very frequently get into a state of Ketosis,

29
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.310
not through diet per se in terms of ingesting different foods,

30
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.030
but actually fasting and I talk about fascinating at length and different ways

31
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:57.540
to approach it in tools of titans.
I'm not going to be Labor that here.

32
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.800
The problem with the ketogenic diet is that if you don't get it perfectly right,

33
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.030
it is the worst possible diet you could follow.
What do I mean by that?

34
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.830
The goal of a ketogenetic diet is to get into a state of ketosis.

35
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.700
This means that your carbohydrate and protein consumption is low enough,

36
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.590
effectively zero in the case of carbohydrates and your fat intake is high
enough.

37
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.220
So we're talking about 75 plus percent of your calories from fat that your body

38
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:29.370
switches into.

39
00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:34.320
Effectively a starvation mode where it says we're not getting the carbohydrates

40
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.100
and nutrients we need to produce glucose for the body,

41
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:42.270
for the brain and everything else.
So we're going to start converting fat.

42
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.170
That includes stored fat.
That's why you store fat,
uh,

43
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.080
into these alternate fuel source called ketones.

44
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.220
Okay?
This is a very,
very binary thing.

45
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.320
So you are either in Ketosis are you are not and we can measure it with safe.

46
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.000
A fingerprint device called the precision Xtra,

47
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.700
x t r a by Abbott labs.

48
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.070
And if you are not say at 0.5 millimolar.

49
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:11.440
So that's how the concentration is measured.
That's the number readout.

50
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.150
If you're not at 0.5 or higher and if you're in Ketosis,

51
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:20.230
generally people would consider the feeling that euphoria and the clarity that

52
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:23.620
you feel at say one millimolar or higher.

53
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.580
For some people it's even 1.5 or two.
You are in Ketosis,

54
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.420
but a low a lot of people,
and when I say a lot,
I would say,
uh,

55
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.350
more than 60% of the people who attempt to do this will fail because they will

56
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.640
miss things like some type of sugar that's in the mustard they use.

57
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.510
Or they will have some type of,
uh,

58
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.430
even say non-nutritive artificial sweetener that for whatever reason provokes an

59
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:54.610
insulin response or a glucose response.
Uh,

60
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.770
or this is a trickier one.

61
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.720
They aren't consuming a bunch of carbohydrates.
They followed that,

62
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:03.130
but they're eating too much protein.

63
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.350
And then the liver turns the extra amino acids,
uh,

64
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.890
via something called Gluconeogenesis into fuck,
oop,

65
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:15.010
pardon my French,
a glucose and then you're screwed again.

66
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.470
So there are many ways to mess up the cater to Hank Diet.

67
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:21.760
And if you think you're in Ketosis,
so you're eating 70,

68
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:25.390
80% of your calories from fat,
but you're actually using glucose,

69
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.120
that is arguably the worst possible diet.

70
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:30.310
You could follow your blood lipid profiles.

71
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.920
All of these blood markers are going to go way out of whack.

72
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.060
So you either get it really,
really right or it's a terrible diet.

73
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.760
So for people who are very,
very meticulous,

74
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:44.761
very perhaps OCD like I am and detail oriented and can really suffer through the

75
00:04:46.331 --> 00:04:48.370
monotony of that diet,
it's great.

76
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:52.780
And in extreme cases also there are many people who think that it can benefit

77
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.640
certain cancer treatments,
uh,
whether it's chemo or radiation,
etc.

78
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.870
As an adjunct to supplement with say,
fasting and or the Ketogenic Diet.

79
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.100
Uh,
typically I recommend slow carb diet because slow carb,

80
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.540
I would say there is an 80% based on tracking.

81
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.160
Say now at this point,

82
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.630
closely tracking more than 2,500 people and certainly observing tens of

83
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.290
thousands of people following this diet,
it probably has an 80% compliance rate,

84
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:22.320
meaning over the first,
the,

85
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.350
the percentage of people who can stick with it for a month is certainly in the

86
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:32.530
70 to 80% range ketosis and the ketogenic diet,

87
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.890
I would say the percentage of people who can stick with a real strict buy

88
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:43.000
necessities,
it's binary.
Ketogenic diet is going to be less than 10%.

89
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.190
Okay.
So less than 10% pass rate on doing the ketogenic diet for a month.

90
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.930
I think that is very fair.
It is really,
really boring diet to do properly.

91
00:05:52.931 --> 00:05:54.560
Unfortunately.
Uh,

92
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.660
now I get the benefits of Ketosis in a number of other ways.

93
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.740
Sometimes on days like today where I've consumed a very,

94
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:08.120
very low carbohydrate small meal,
I'll have something like this.

95
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.360
This is coffee with some exotic in his ketones in it,

96
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.310
exogenous meaning outside of the body,

97
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.340
so you can think exoskeleton Ekso outside exogenous or endogenous produced in

98
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:22.250
the body.
Exogenous ketones is a liquid that I pour in here.

99
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.810
It's called Keto force.

100
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:26.760
There are different types and it is Beta hydroxy butyrate.

101
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.220
It's the same thing that you measuring your blood with a finger prick when you

102
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:34.340
are say testing to see if you're in ketosis or not.

103
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.820
And that allows me to jack up my ketone levels.

104
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.620
This I think can be misused also more frequently,
at least once a month.

105
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:46.400
I'm doing say a three day fast and you want to do this with medical supervision

106
00:06:46.401 --> 00:06:49.610
folks.
Don't be an amateur doctor.
I'm not a doctor.

107
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.210
Don't play one on the Internet,
but say from Thursday dinner to Sunday dinner,

108
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.280
that's enough time to get into ketosis briefly.

109
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:58.520
And I think there are other benefits to fasting that might be related,

110
00:06:58.521 --> 00:07:03.470
such as triggering autophagy and deactivating or at least not activating

111
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.220
something called m Tor,
which talked,
uh,

112
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.700
with at length on the podcast with a guy,
a guy,

113
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.450
a very world class scientist who was shortlisted for the Nobel Prize,
uh,

114
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.920
named David Sabatini,
but you guys can listen to.
So,
uh,

115
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.670
I think there are benefits that can be derived incredible benefits from

116
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.500
intermittent ketosis.

117
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.220
That doesn't necessarily mean that you need to use a ketogenic diet.

118
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.350
Fasting exogenous ketones,

119
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.750
maybe a combination of intermittent fasting plus exogenous ketones,
et Cetera,
uh,

120
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.270
is very valuable as different tools in the arsenal.

121
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.670
But for the short answer,

122
00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:44.870
and I said this top of this long winded explanation as well,

123
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.850
is that if I take a hundred people and I just selected at random from the

124
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:52.130
population,
I tell them to do a slow carb diet,

125
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.720
I would bet on at least 70% succeeding for a period of two to four weeks.

126
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.440
And in that period of time,
people who have a fair amount of fat to lose,

127
00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:02.630
for instance,
very common.
If it's,

128
00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:06.200
say someone who weighs more than let's call,

129
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.960
call it 200 pounds and more than 15% body fat,

130
00:08:08.961 --> 00:08:12.740
that they can lose up to 20 pounds of fat.
This is very,
very common.

131
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.270
It's not always the case,
but very common.
Then you take another hundred people,

132
00:08:17.271 --> 00:08:19.910
you put them on the ketogenetic diet and it's strict,

133
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.940
and then they have to self enforce.
You're not making food for them.

134
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:23.870
They have to figure it out.

135
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:29.150
I would say you're going to be looking at maximum 20% who are going to make it a

136
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.860
month,
and in my experience,

137
00:08:30.861 --> 00:08:35.861
I've actually lost more body fat on the slow carb Diet than I have in Ketosis.

138
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.591
Oddly enough,

139
00:08:39.591 --> 00:08:42.020
because you would think that you'd be pulling from all of your body fat stores.

140
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.940
Fantastic.
Well,
I've done a nine day fast,
deep,
Deep Ketosis,
right,

141
00:08:46.941 --> 00:08:49.070
which is already going to be highly muscle sparing,

142
00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:53.030
surprisingly and lost very little fat.
Why would that be?

143
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.060
Well because each pound of fat is something along the lines of 9,000 calories.

144
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.390
So even if you're very,
very lean,
your 5% body fat,
you have plenty of fat,

145
00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:07.080
keep you alive for a week to three weeks and uh,

146
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.980
it's a slow burn for whatever reason.
And it could be microbiome related,

147
00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:14.910
I suspect it is that when you're eating prebiotic foods on the slow carb diet

148
00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:16.530
like lentils,
legumes,
et Cetera,

149
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.750
and also getting the thermogenic effect of food for more protein intake.
Uh,

150
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.600
and it's a diet that's highly compatible with say,

151
00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:29.190
power training and resistance training,
different types.
For whatever reason,

152
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.240
I just see more fat loss on slow carbs.

153
00:09:32.241 --> 00:09:37.241
So that is not why I use the ketogenic diet is mainly as a means of improving

154
00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:40.470
cognitive performance and as a medical intervention.

155
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.420
So there you have it folks,
slow carb diet versus Ketogenic Diet.

156
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.950
Hope that clarifies things when in doubt,
slow carb.
That's it.

157
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.300
If you enjoy this video,
I want to propose you check out the podcast,

158
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:58.710
the Tim Ferriss show.
Why has it been number one on iTunes across all categories?

159
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.790
In some cases.
Number one in business.
Why does it have 70 million plus downloads?

160
00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:07.230
Because I interviewed world class performers from athletics business.

161
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.990
That includes billionaires from everything imaginable.

162
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:14.250
Entertainment to tease out the routines,
the habits,
the tools that you can use.

163
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.320
So check it out.
