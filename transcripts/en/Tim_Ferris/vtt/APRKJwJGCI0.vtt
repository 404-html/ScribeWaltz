1
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.540
[inaudible]

2
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.160
<v 1>so purchases of less than a hundred dollars that have most improved my life in</v>

3
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:22.740
recent memory because there are many purchases of less than a hundred dollars.

4
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:25.800
There are a few right off the bat.
Sneak preview here,
there.
Okay.

5
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.880
So number one is this hat.

6
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.020
This is the Sitka Dakota beanie and it's Cammo just so people don't see your

7
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:40.740
head when you're walking around and you look like the headless horseman and your

8
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:41.574
Turquoise Shirt.

9
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.290
But a extremely comfortable hat that for whatever reason I can't properly

10
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:50.520
explain this.
I can wear say in warmer temperatures like 60,

11
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.020
just because I don't have much coverage.

12
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.740
I can also wear it subfreezing and uh,

13
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.660
it works in both environments.

14
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.660
I first got exposed to the sick as a hunting brand.

15
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.210
It's kind of like the Lulu Lemon,

16
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.350
the most comfortable clothing in the hunting world,
really high quality gear.

17
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.900
When I was in Colorado and I traveled with this everywhere.

18
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.250
I also use it as a murse man purse.

19
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.630
So I'll stick say a piece of recording equipment into this hat to protect it

20
00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:25.770
because it's semi padded.
So this travels with me constantly.
That's number one.

21
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.510
Might as well show you this.
Number two,
which is a spray zinc.

22
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.430
This is there is zinc spray,
which is the zinc gluconate.

23
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.400
And I use this for immune support.

24
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:43.401
So this travels in the side of my backpack and I will spray tank like banal,

25
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.140
but five or six sprays around the mouth.

26
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.220
And I will do this two or three times probably per day when I'm traveling.

27
00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:52.680
And I've found it as it appears,

28
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:56.280
at least to me to make a substantial difference if there are a lot of people

29
00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:58.700
getting sick and continuing to get sick,
coughing and so on,

30
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:03.330
on a trip or on a plane,
uh,
this helps me not to succumb.

31
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.650
So this is always with me.

32
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.080
The next one that is always with me and all these items travel with me,

33
00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:12.690
24,
seven,
effectively,
they live in my backpack.

34
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.320
This is the rubs device and no,

35
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:20.730
it is not a massage parlor with black windows.
It is what it looks like,

36
00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:25.370
a golf ball and it has these little nubs on it.
It was gifted to me.
Uh,

37
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.340
this is very,
very cheap.

38
00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:29.640
It's like $6 gifted to me by Amelia Boone's thank you Amelia,

39
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
who is a four time world champion in obstacle course racing and you roll out

40
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:41.001
your feet or your hands or your forearms in my case with this device and it is

41
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:46.680
incredible how much it relieves pain throughout the body if you just roll out

42
00:02:46.681 --> 00:02:49.980
your feet properly,
which is something I picked up.
Uh,

43
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.630
not only from Amelia Boone but from Ed Coan who's the most successful legendary

44
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:57.080
power lifter in the history of the world.
Uh,

45
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.570
I think he did looked at 901 at two 20 or something insane like that.

46
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.640
And a lot of back pain,

47
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.330
leg pain in my experience goes away when you just rub out your feet.

48
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:10.810
So if I landed a hotel or when I wake up after a bunch of travel,

49
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.790
I use this on the feet.
Next up we have this device.

50
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.710
This isn't the most interesting angle though.
That is the most interesting angle.

51
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.070
This is the logic tech keys to go keyboard and it holds a charge for very,

52
00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:32.440
very long time.
And I stick this in the laptop pocket.
Why?

53
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.060
Because I like to work in say restaurants.
I like to type,

54
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:38.260
I like to brainstorm and restaurants,

55
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:42.580
but I don't want to have a laptop out or if my laptop has a problem and I can't

56
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:47.020
use it,
I still want to be able to type and not poke at my iPhone screen.

57
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.140
So I will take my iPhone,
lean it against,

58
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:53.650
say a glass of ice tea or wine or whatever,

59
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.200
and then I will pair it to this keyboard and I can type an entire chapter out.

60
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.590
It's really cool and people don't even notice necessarily that I'm working.

61
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:06.010
They just think I'm a crack head staring at my ice tea for two hours straight.

62
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.660
All right,
the last up,

63
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.110
and this is increasingly important as I travel to louder and louder cities,

64
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:20.350
let's say in some cases,
is the following,
Max pillow,

65
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:24.820
soft silicone [inaudible].
And this is what it looks like.

66
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.610
These are earplugs and they're not foam.

67
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.710
And what this allows you to do is sleep very,

68
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:39.870
very,
very well.
And that includes laying on your side.

69
00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:43.600
So what happens if you say roll up foam earplugs to come near your and then you

70
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:47.920
lay on your side,
you feel like you have a nerf icepick being jabbed into your,

71
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:50.110
your job,
which is not very comfortable.
Uh,

72
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:54.970
and I find these two also damp and sound more effectively than foam,
typically.

73
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.100
Fantastic.
So those are a handful of the purchases,

74
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:03.640
less than a hundred dollars that have most impacted my life and continue to,

75
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.940
they travel with me 24,
seven.
Hey guys,

76
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:09.580
if you're enjoying the tips and tactics and how to,

77
00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:14.050
on this channel or in the podcast,
the Tim Ferriss show,
I made this for you.

78
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.870
So I've had mentors,
short advice from the best in the world.

79
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.890
This is the book that I wanted to read.
So I went out and I put it together,

80
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.080
created a dream list of 130 of the best at what they do.

81
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:29.860
People who are icons,
legends,
and ask them all the same questions.

82
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:31.870
These are people in some cases I wanted to reach out to.

83
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:35.620
My whole life ranges from many,
many billionaires,

84
00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:38.350
cofounders of every company imaginable,

85
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.700
elite athletes ranging from surfing to tennis to power lifting.
Everything else,

86
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.830
country stars,
actors,
directors,
and you can spot the patterns.

87
00:05:47.831 --> 00:05:50.770
So some of my friends have said this is the easiest to read,

88
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.770
most useful book that I've put together yet.

89
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.240
So checking out tribe of mentors.com you can find sample chapters,

90
00:05:58.241 --> 00:06:01.450

everything traveled.
