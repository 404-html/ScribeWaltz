1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.880
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:06.090
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.100
You posting a question.

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.400
I'm a cybernetic organism,
living tissue.

5
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.630
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by Peloton and I'd heard about Peloton over and</v>

6
00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:33.100
over again,
but I ended up getting a Peloton bike in the whole system.

7
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.480
After I saw my buddy Kevin Rose,
I've known him forever,
some of you know,

8
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.510
and he showed up at my gate at my house a while back and he looked fantastic.

9
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.770
I asked him,
I said,
dude,
you look great.
What the hell have you been up to?

10
00:00:47.771 --> 00:00:49.900
Because he's always doing a weird diet or another,

11
00:00:49.901 --> 00:00:51.460
but it only lasts like a week or two.

12
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.270
So he always regresses to the mean after like 75 beers and he said,

13
00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:57.850
I've been doing Peloton five days a week now.

14
00:00:57.851 --> 00:01:02.530
That caught my attention because Kevin does nothing five days a week and you

15
00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:05.800
know,
I love you Kevin,
but it really peaked my curiosity,

16
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.830
ended up getting a system and it's become an integral part of my week.

17
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.730
I love it and I really didn't expect to love it at all because I find cycling

18
00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:17.410
really boring usually,

19
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.420
but peloton is an indoor cycling bike that brings live studio classes right into

20
00:01:22.421 --> 00:01:23.254
your home.

21
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.840
You don't have to worry about fitting classes into your schedule or making it to

22
00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:27.880
a studio with some type of commute,

23
00:01:27.881 --> 00:01:32.410
etc. New classes are added every day and this includes options led by elite New

24
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.880
York City instructors in your own living room.

25
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.900
You can even livestream studio classes taught by the world's best instructors or

26
00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:42.901
find your own favorite class on demand and in fact Kevin and I rarely do live

27
00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:46.720
classes and you can compete with your friends,
which is also fun.
Kevin,

28
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.950
I'm coming after you but we usually just use classes on demand.

29
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.520
I really like Matt Wilbur's and his iron,

30
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.530
high intensity training sessions that are shorter,

31
00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.560
like 20 minutes and I think Kevin's favorite is Alex and everyone seems to have

32
00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:06.730
their favorite instructor or you can select by music duration and so on.

33
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.740
Each Peloton bike includes a 22 inch HD touchscreen performance tracking

34
00:02:11.741 --> 00:02:12.251
metrics.

35
00:02:12.251 --> 00:02:16.540
I think that that along with the real time leaderboard are the main reasons that

36
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:21.220
this caught my attention when cycling never had caught my attention before.

37
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.730
It's really pretty stunning what they've done with the user interface to keep

38
00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:25.564
your attention.

39
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.650
The belt drive is quiet and it's smaller than you would expect so it can fit in

40
00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:33.640
a living room or an office.
I actually have it in a large closet,

41
00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:37.030
believe it or not,
and it fits with no problem.

42
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.040
So peloton is offering all of you guys,
listeners of the Tim Ferriss show,

43
00:02:42.041 --> 00:02:47.041
a special offer and it is actually special visit one Peloton that's o n e p e l

46
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.890
Now you say ma accessories,
wait,

47
00:03:00.891 --> 00:03:05.510
I don't need fancy towels or whatever other supplemental bits and pieces.

48
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.730
No,
the shoes you need,

49
00:03:07.731 --> 00:03:10.730
you need the clip in shoes and those are in the accessory category.

50
00:03:10.731 --> 00:03:14.660

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.193
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

60
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.920
<v 1>this episode is brought to you by wordpress.com I love wordpress.</v>

61
00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.950
I have used it for so many years.

62
00:03:58.951 --> 00:04:01.800
It's my go to platform for blogging and creating websites.

63
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.190
I use wordpress.com for everything every day.

64
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.420
My site tim.blog is built on it.
The websites for my books,

65
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.910
including tools of titans,
tribe of mentors.

66
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.630
It's all in wordpress.com and the founder Matt Mullenweg.

67
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.810
One of my close friends has appeared on the show many times.

68
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.890
Just search Matt Mullenweg,
Tequila Ferris for quite an exciting time.

69
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.480
Whether you're looking to create a personal blog,
a business site,
or both,

70
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.200
you can make a really big impact right out of the box when you build on

71
00:04:31.201 --> 00:04:35.910
wordpress.com and you'll be in good company.
It's used by the New Yorker,
Jay Z,

72
00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:39.000
Beyonce,
five 38 tech crunch,
Ted,
CNN,

73
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.460
and time just to name a handful.

74
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.880
And one of my friends@googlewhoshallremainnamelesshastoldmethatwordpress.com

75
00:04:48.211 --> 00:04:52.230
offers the quote best out of the box SEO imaginable end quote.

76
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.030
And it's one of the many reasons that nearly 30% of the Internet is run on

77
00:04:57.031 --> 00:04:57.864
wordpress.

78
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.710
You do not need experience or to hire someone that's perhaps the best part.

79
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.380
wordpress.com guide you through the entire experience.

80
00:05:04.381 --> 00:05:09.240
They have hundreds of designs and templates that you can use and it's easy to

81
00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:12.510
get started.
There's no need to worry about security upgrades,

82
00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:16.890
hosting any of that there for 24 seven support.
And they're very,

83
00:05:16.891 --> 00:05:19.320
very responsive.
If you have questions,
they get right back to you.

84
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.700
And this allows you to create the highest quality with the least amount of

85
00:05:23.701 --> 00:05:27.000
headache and friction.
So if you're building a website,
period,

86
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.140
when my friends come to me and ask what I use,

<v 3>Hello boys and girls,
ladies and germs.</v>

96
00:06:00.371 --> 00:06:03.730
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

97
00:06:03.731 --> 00:06:07.930
it is my job to deconstruct world class performers of all different types across

98
00:06:07.931 --> 00:06:10.870
all different industries and areas of expertise.

99
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.400
And this episode we have Jason Freed on Twitter at Jason Freed,

100
00:06:15.401 --> 00:06:20.380
F R I e d base camp.com.
He is the cofounder and CEO of base camp,

101
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.240
previously known as 37 signals,

102
00:06:22.241 --> 00:06:26.350
a Chicago based software from the company's flagship product base camp,

103
00:06:26.351 --> 00:06:27.190
which I've used for many,

104
00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:31.480
many years is a project management and team communication application trusted by

105
00:06:31.481 --> 00:06:36.100
millions.
He's also the coauthor of getting real subtitle,
the smarter,
faster,

106
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.340
easier way to build a successful web application which is available for

107
00:06:39.341 --> 00:06:42.610
free@gettingrealdotthirtysevensignals.com.

108
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.630
He's also the coauthor of the New York Times bestseller rework and remote

109
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.920
subtitle office not required.
There's also a new book coming soon.

110
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.750
It doesn't have to be crazy at work and you can actually thread those together

111
00:06:55.751 --> 00:06:57.580
to tell a lot of this story.

112
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.660
Jason writes a regular column for ink magazine and is a frequent contributor to

113
00:07:01.661 --> 00:07:04.870
base camps.
Popular blog.
Popular is an understatement.

114
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.640
Signal versus noise which offers quote strong opinions and share thoughts on

115
00:07:09.641 --> 00:07:12.130
design,
business and tech and quote.

116
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:14.990
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

117
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.780
<v 3>Jason,
welcome to the show.
Thanks for having me Tim.
And we have,</v>

118
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.500
we have treated so many email over the years and uh,
certainly met on a,

119
00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.580
on a handful of occasions and you have to be one of the most requested guests

120
00:07:29.061 --> 00:07:33.500
for this podcast.
So thrilled that you were able and willing to make the time.

121
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.120
So many thank you to everybody who wanted to hear me.
I don't know why,

122
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:39.810
but it's great to hear that I'm wanting,

123
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.910
well I think part of why people like to hear from you,

124
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.160
and maybe it's a love hate thing,

125
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:53.840
but I think that what you said to me before we started is indicative.

126
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:58.870
So one was in response to what I always say to guests and that is you have final

127
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:02.240
cut.
So it's better to kind of go a little over the edge and we can pare it back

128
00:08:02.241 --> 00:08:05.270
later.
And you said,
actually,
I don't want that much control,

129
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:11.060
whatever I say,
I should go out into the world in effect a is what you said.

130
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.980
And,
and you are known for being very raw and Contrarion,

131
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.910
uh,
which,
which I think has great appeal to a lot of people,

132
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.940
particularly in the current climate that we don't need to describe for everybody

133
00:08:25.251 --> 00:08:26.061
to understand.

134
00:08:26.061 --> 00:08:31.061
And I'll start given that with a quote from Jeff Bezos,

135
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.070
the trillionaire in the making behind Amazon quote,

136
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.630
Jason is immune to dogma and has much to teach in 37 signals.

137
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.830
He has built an elegant company with elegant products based on the idea that

138
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.780
less is more.
Now,
of course this is before we went from 37 signals to base camp.

139
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.860
But I,
I'd love to talk about this,

140
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.890
this immune to dogma component and we could certainly talk about less is more.

141
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.670
Jeff ended up investing in your company,

142
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.590
which is a whole separate story that we've,

143
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:06.540
we've covered in some respects with the conversation I had with uh,
your,

144
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.740
your partner in crime DHH separately.
So we won't dig into that.

145
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.770
But what I'm really curious to know is this immune to dogma ability to question

146
00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:19.764
assumptions.

147
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.110
How much of that is an innate skill versus an acquired skill?

148
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.540
<v 4>Um,
I guess it's hard for me to say from where I sit,</v>

149
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:33.950
but I think a big part of it is that I don't really pay attention to a lot of

150
00:09:33.951 --> 00:09:36.410
things actually.
So,
um,

151
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:41.390
maybe I have different points of view because I haven't heard the other ones or

152
00:09:41.391 --> 00:09:45.620
I,
I have different points of view because I haven't let,
you know,

153
00:09:45.621 --> 00:09:49.820
society's norms and the general point of view get into my head.

154
00:09:49.821 --> 00:09:53.240
So I have to come up with my own ideas.
I've always sort of,

155
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.400
I pay attention to some degree,
but I'm,

156
00:09:55.401 --> 00:09:58.130
I'm pretty oblivious to a lot of things intentionally cause I,

157
00:09:58.131 --> 00:09:59.750
I don't want to be influenced that much.

158
00:09:59.751 --> 00:10:03.200
And it's one of the reasons why I don't read industry news.

159
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.520
I read very little news in general,
but I definitely don't read industry news.

160
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.190
I don't want to know what everyone else is doing.
Um,

161
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:15.220
I find it's very easy to end up following and being like everybody else when

162
00:10:15.921 --> 00:10:18.410
you're constantly hearing what everyone else has on their mind,

163
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.840
it's very hard then to fight against that.

164
00:10:20.841 --> 00:10:24.080
So by not filling my mind with other people's ideas,

165
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.900
I have nowhere to go but to follow my own.

166
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:31.520
And I think that perhaps that's why I'm,
I'm immune to to dogmas.

167
00:10:31.521 --> 00:10:32.570
That's just don't even pay attention.

168
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.330
<v 3>You just don't have as much exposure on some attentional.
Yeah.
What are,</v>

169
00:10:37.331 --> 00:10:41.170
what are some of the parameters or rules for yourself,

170
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.150
structures,
systems,

171
00:10:43.151 --> 00:10:48.151
anything that you've put in place to find that sweet spot of deliberate,

172
00:10:50.381 --> 00:10:52.540
selective ignorance,
so to speak?

173
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:57.910
<v 4>Yeah.
Uh,
um,
a lot of it is just kind of going with the flow and not having,</v>

174
00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.450
I don't have a lot of structure,
for example.
Um,
I,

175
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.200
I don't have routines.
Uh,
I don't,
uh,

176
00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:09.060
I don't have any goals.
I've never had any goals.
Goals are not something that I,

177
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:12.850
I pay attention to.
Um,
I just sort of do a,

178
00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:16.990
what I feel like is the right thing to do in any given situation.

179
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.500
And I don't,
I don't look longterm at things other than I want to.

180
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.540
Like for example,
being in business over the long term,

181
00:11:22.541 --> 00:11:24.250
I'd like to live over the long term.

182
00:11:24.251 --> 00:11:27.310
I'd like to be nice and getting better over the long term,

183
00:11:27.311 --> 00:11:30.460
but I don't have the goalposts along the way.
Um,

184
00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.420
so because of that and because they don't have much of a,
of a routine,

185
00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:37.420
I sort of just take it as it comes.
And,
uh,

186
00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:41.830
I think that also perhaps allows me to sidestep a lot of the ways you're

187
00:11:41.831 --> 00:11:45.560
supposed to do things,
you know?
And because I don't plan to,

188
00:11:45.561 --> 00:11:50.190
because I don't think too far ahead on any individual one thing.
Um,
I,

189
00:11:50.191 --> 00:11:54.980
I just able to sort of go where I need to when I to,
uh,
and I know that's,

190
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.320
it's,
it's funny because I'll talk to a lot of people about this.
Uh,

191
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.840
and people would come on,
you must have some goals,
like,
you know,
this or that.

192
00:12:01.841 --> 00:12:05.440
And I really,
really don't have any,
I can't remember ever having one eye.

193
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:10.770
I just do the best I can in any given situation and that's the best I can do.

194
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:14.980
And however that ends up playing itself out over time is how it ends up playing

195
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:17.830
itself out over time.
I,
I don't want to measure up.
Uh,

196
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.000
one of my favorite quotes is,
um,
Gosh,
I forget now who it is.
Um,

197
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.090
maybe it's Mark Twain,
but you know,
he's probably said everything or

198
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.160
<v 3>everything's attributed to him,
but,
um,
it could,
it could have been,</v>

199
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.720
it could have been able Lincoln.
Yeah.
Reinstein one of them,
right.

200
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.870
<v 4>Um,
uh,
basically comparison is the death of joy.
And uh,</v>

201
00:12:36.871 --> 00:12:40.090
I love that quote because,
uh,
it,
it comes down to people,

202
00:12:40.091 --> 00:12:43.030
it comes down to situations and it also comes down to goals and setting goals.

203
00:12:43.031 --> 00:12:47.440
For me,
um,
I don't want to compare myself to an idea I had two years prior,

204
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.120
you know,
of where I wanted to be.

205
00:12:49.121 --> 00:12:50.740
I don't know where I'm going to want to be in two years.

206
00:12:50.741 --> 00:12:54.790
So to set a goal that's long term,
in some cases you're actually setting it for,

207
00:12:54.791 --> 00:12:58.330
you know who you are when you set it versus who you are when you're going to get

208
00:12:58.331 --> 00:12:58.990
there.

209
00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.810
And that's something that a friend of mine told me once and I thought that a guy

210
00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:04.240
named Jim Coudal who I thought was just,
it's a wonderful quote.

211
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.460
I don't know if it's his or someone else's,
but it really rang true.

212
00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:08.140
And so that's kind of how I,
how I go about the world.

213
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:09.701
<v 3>Well,
let's,</v>

214
00:13:09.701 --> 00:13:14.701
let's look at that in a real world example because this is,

215
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.540
this is something that is,
I'm sure you've experienced as you noted,

216
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.400
people react to with a certain level of disbelief,
right?

217
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.860
You have a s a profitable company,

218
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.790
17 out of 17 years or now what I read maybe out of date,

219
00:13:30.791 --> 00:13:34.930
but however many years out of however many years.
And,
uh,

220
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.460
you have an organization,
uh,

221
00:13:37.461 --> 00:13:42.461
you are successful certainly by almost any objective measure.

222
00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.160
What did the last week look like?
We're recording this on a Thursday afternoon,

223
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.320
so we're coming up to the tail end of what most people would consider a business

224
00:13:50.321 --> 00:13:54.220
week.
Uh,
and if you don't have goals,

225
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:59.250
you must have some means of making better decisions versus shitty decisions.

226
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.150
Uh,

227
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:06.150
so could you maybe walk us through what this week has looked like for you?

228
00:14:08.561 --> 00:14:11.320
How you've spent your time,
which I know is very broad,

229
00:14:11.321 --> 00:14:13.480
but we perhaps use that as a launching point.

230
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.440
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

231
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.420
this week is a little tricky cause I had some personal stuff I had to deal with

232
00:14:17.421 --> 00:14:18.111
in the beginning of the week,

233
00:14:18.111 --> 00:14:22.680
so it will take like a week before or something like that.
Perfect.
Um,

234
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:27.210
so,
you know,
at base camp we work in,
um,

235
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:31.940
what we call six weeks cycles.
So we are,
we don't work on anything.

236
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:34.790
Okay.
I'm generalizing,
but for the most part,

237
00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:38.960
we don't work on anything that takes longer than six weeks to do.
So,
um,

238
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.400
our goals technically are to deliver something great within six weeks,

239
00:14:43.401 --> 00:14:46.490
whatever we're building.
Um,
as a,
as an organization,

240
00:14:46.491 --> 00:14:49.880
that's sort of where our goals are,
but are,
I don't have personal goals.

241
00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:54.050
Like I don't have a goal.
Like,
if we,
I,
we don't set personal goals,

242
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.280
we don't say company wide goals in terms of uh,

243
00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:01.310
like this feature will be successful if or uh,
you know,

244
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.480
if it brings in this amount of money it'll be worth it or anything like that.
Um,

245
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.290
our,
our goal if you do want to use the word is just to do the best job we can.

246
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:14.450
So last week I met with a couple of teams who are doing some projects and kind

247
00:15:14.451 --> 00:15:17.030
of reviewed them with them and tried to help them through some problems,

248
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.860
work through some ideas.
We're just finalizing some,
some um,

249
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.570
some stuff on our books.
So I'm working on the book that we're,
we're finishing,

250
00:15:23.571 --> 00:15:27.950
our manuscript is due in a couple of weeks,
so I did some of that.
Um,
but,

251
00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:33.170
but really it's all about what we're actually doing at the moment versus sort of

252
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.940
the big picture as to why we're doing it other than we just want to do a good

253
00:15:37.941 --> 00:15:39.500
job.
We have an idea,
we've set out,

254
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.110
set out some work we're going to do over the next six weeks and just helping

255
00:15:42.111 --> 00:15:42.950
people get there.

256
00:15:42.951 --> 00:15:47.060
And do the best we can and also make decisions and cut things and say we can't

257
00:15:47.061 --> 00:15:49.580
do all these things we want to do.
What's the important part of this?

258
00:15:49.581 --> 00:15:53.570
So I love trying to get to what's the most important part of something versus

259
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:56.540
you know,
we don't have any,
for example,
we don't have any KPIs at base camp.

260
00:15:56.541 --> 00:15:59.480
We don't have key performance indicators.
Yeah,

261
00:15:59.481 --> 00:16:01.790
I didn't even know what that meant by the way until recently,

262
00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.640
cause I kinda heard everyone talking about them.
I'm like what do we have those?

263
00:16:04.641 --> 00:16:05.990
And they go,
oh no,
we don't have the,

264
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:11.180
<v 3>we don't.
Just to pause for a second.
So for people who are like what tps reports,</v>

265
00:16:11.181 --> 00:16:12.230
so Kpis,

266
00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:17.950
KPIs are referred to very often in startup vernacular,

267
00:16:18.471 --> 00:16:22.970
particularly in the tech world as key performance indicators,

268
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
which refer to the few or handful of metrics that are prized and most valued

269
00:16:30.771 --> 00:16:34.910
within your company.
And that that could be revenue per employee.

270
00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:39.911
It could be a monthly unique users or any number of other things.

271
00:16:40.551 --> 00:16:44.270
Week on week growth of x.
Who knows?
So sorry to direct,

272
00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:46.640
but just for people who don't come from that world,

273
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.730
she's so you don't have Cape Cape Kpis

274
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:53.500
<v 4>don't have that.
We don't have revenue growth number targets.
We don't have,</v>

275
00:16:53.501 --> 00:16:55.930
we don't want to talk.
Okay.
So we don't have goals that we don't have targets,

276
00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.770
we don't have KPIs,
we don't have um,

277
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.230
sort of those kinds of reasons for doing what we do every day.
Uh,

278
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.490
the reason we do what we do everyday is because we enjoy doing it and we want to

279
00:17:06.491 --> 00:17:09.130
make what we're working on better and we're making the thing that we're making

280
00:17:09.131 --> 00:17:11.050
for others.
We're also making for ourselves.

281
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:14.350
So we technically want to make our own tooling better because it helps us do

282
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.090
better job with what we do.

283
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:20.620
So it really is this day to day or week to week or every six weeks sort of

284
00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:24.190
rolling thing where you,
you,
you set out some stuff you want to do,

285
00:17:24.191 --> 00:17:26.650
you do it the best you can at the end of those six weeks.

286
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:30.760
We take a week or two off from scheduled work and we do other things at work.

287
00:17:30.761 --> 00:17:33.070
We roam around and have new ideas,
play with some stuff,

288
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.710
and then we pick another set of products that do over the next six weeks.

289
00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.730
And we just kind of go as we go and course correct as we go.

290
00:17:39.731 --> 00:17:41.850
And we just don't have any of these big,
big picture of things.

291
00:17:41.851 --> 00:17:44.220
So my weeks look like feedback,
my weeks look,

292
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.910
look like thinking they look like writing.

293
00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:51.000
Sometimes it requires me to debate things with people.
Um,

294
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:56.400
uh,
you know,
to,
to,
to lay out,
uh,
some,
some reasons for why we're doing things,

295
00:17:56.401 --> 00:17:58.840
but my week is,
is not,
uh,

296
00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:02.400
pointed in any one direction other than what we're really doing right now.

297
00:18:02.401 --> 00:18:07.020
So it is very much a day to day sort of existence.
Um,
which,

298
00:18:07.021 --> 00:18:11.070
which is why it's sort of an incompatible existence with goals,

299
00:18:11.071 --> 00:18:15.030
with longterm goals,
you know,
with,
with,
with figures and numbers and stuff.

300
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.150
I also,
I don't want to be upset about expectations.

301
00:18:18.151 --> 00:18:21.750
So another thing I don't have or any really any expectations.
Um,

302
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.740
I would hate to,
for example,
let's say,
let's say the company was,

303
00:18:25.741 --> 00:18:30.000
we were expected to grow 22%.
Next year,
I'm making up numbers here,
right?
Uh,

304
00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:35.020
and we grew 21 like that would be a reason it a lot of companies to be upset.

305
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.750
That is a ridiculous reason to be upset.
Everyone would be upset with that.

306
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:42.870
When you set off these numbers in these goalposts,

307
00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:46.370
in these goals and these expectations and you don't hit them,
then you're just,

308
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.010
then you're upset and once you've actually either hit them or not hit them,

309
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.700
then you come up with another set and you just keep moving these,
these,

310
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.090
these moments of um,

311
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:59.460
possible joy but most likely disappointment and a lot of cases and I just don't

312
00:18:59.461 --> 00:19:02.450
feel like setting those up for myself.
So I just ignore the whole thing.

313
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.590
<v 3>Okay.
Uh,
I've,
I've,</v>

314
00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:10.040
I have all of these various bits and pieces that I've gathered through research

315
00:19:10.041 --> 00:19:13.010
and I suspect that I'm just going to get hung up on a couple of things I really

316
00:19:13.011 --> 00:19:16.160
want to explore and that's just going to be the way it goes.
Let's go into it.

317
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:20.390
All right.
There are many people listening to,

318
00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:26.380
are familiar with base camp and the blog and so on.

319
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:27.440
And her saying,

320
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.640
I would love to have a company or a product is successful is base camp,

321
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:35.660
but I don't know how to go from where I am,

322
00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:38.750
which is goal oriented,
having Kpis,

323
00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:41.120
etc. To

324
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:46.250
perhaps the other end of the spectrum,
which is closer to Jason.

325
00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:51.251
So I suppose embedded into that is the question of should they even want to

326
00:19:52.581 --> 00:19:55.610
emulate that?
Uh,
but,
but secondly,
if someone said yes,

327
00:19:55.611 --> 00:19:57.770
I've decided I want to move more in that direction,

328
00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:03.280
what might be a step they could take or steps they could take to inch them a

329
00:20:04.191 --> 00:20:07.250
little bit closer to,
uh,

330
00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:12.410
where you are in a little further away from,
Oh my God,
I wanted to at 22 we,

331
00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.120
we hit 21 we're a failure,

332
00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.240
<v 4>right?
Well first off,</v>

333
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:20.500
I do want to make it really clear that this is simply what works for me in our

334
00:20:20.501 --> 00:20:24.820
organization.
So I am not suggesting this is the only way,
the best way,

335
00:20:24.821 --> 00:20:27.280
whatever this,
this works for us.
So,
if,

336
00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:31.870
if what works for you works for you and you're very goal oriented and KPI driven

337
00:20:31.871 --> 00:20:33.730
and you think,
you know,
you need to,

338
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:36.280
to the things you measure the thing or whatever it is,

339
00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.590
figure how that saying goes.
Um,
what you,

340
00:20:38.591 --> 00:20:40.480
what you measure is what you move or whatever.

341
00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:43.840
I don't know what gets measured gets managed.
That's the one,
right?
So,

342
00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:44.710
so if you're,

343
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:48.790
if you're like that and you think that are great for you and things are working

344
00:20:48.791 --> 00:20:53.050
well for you,
please do not even consider changing.
Like keep doing that.

345
00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:53.973
I think though,

346
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:59.250
if you're doing all of those things and you feel a sense of sort of the lack of

347
00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:03.130
fulfillment or you're maybe consistently disappointed or you're reaching for

348
00:21:03.131 --> 00:21:07.060
things that you can't seem to grab,
um,
I would suggest,
you know,

349
00:21:07.061 --> 00:21:09.910
trying a little bit,
trying some of the things I'm suggesting,

350
00:21:09.911 --> 00:21:12.880
which is pull back your expectations a bit.
Um,

351
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:16.380
just sort of tried to set out to do the best you can versus,
uh,

352
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:18.460
tried to measure up with a number that you've made up.

353
00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:22.420
And that's the other thing that I think is important here is that any projection

354
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:27.340
that you set out to to hit is a guests like your,
your,
you,

355
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:31.000
you personally are making or someone at your organization,
whatever it is,

356
00:21:31.001 --> 00:21:34.780
making a guess and they're picking a number and they're saying,

357
00:21:34.781 --> 00:21:39.730
this is where we think we should be because this is sort of what we did last

358
00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.260
year.
And because of that,
we want to do a little bit better this year,

359
00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:46.510
but all the stuff is still just manmade.
None of these things are,
are,

360
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:50.410
are inherent in existence.
They're all man made things.
These numbers,

361
00:21:50.411 --> 00:21:51.111
these goals is figure.

362
00:21:51.111 --> 00:21:54.310
So if you can begin to strip that back and sort of recognize that that's the

363
00:21:54.311 --> 00:21:58.030
case and say like,
what if I tried to function without setting any of these,

364
00:21:58.031 --> 00:22:01.090
but I just did the best work I can anyway because isn't that what I should be

365
00:22:01.091 --> 00:22:05.980
doing anyway,
no matter what.
So my suggestion would be,
as with anything,
um,

366
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:10.840
I'm not a big fan of,
of trying to massively change anything at once.
So I think,

367
00:22:10.841 --> 00:22:13.890
um,
my suggestion would be like whatever the next project you have that,

368
00:22:13.891 --> 00:22:15.470
that you're working on,
um,

369
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.550
if you would normally set out some goalposts are set out some,

370
00:22:18.551 --> 00:22:20.830
some figures to hit or whatever,
or measure this,

371
00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:23.020
just try not measuring one of those things.

372
00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:27.910
Just pick one little tiny thing that you can throw away and not worry about and

373
00:22:27.911 --> 00:22:30.210
see what happens.
And you'll probably find that,
that,

374
00:22:30.211 --> 00:22:34.180
that the sky isn't falling into businesses and car isn't crashing and people

375
00:22:34.181 --> 00:22:37.360
aren't running aimlessly around.
Not wondering what are wondering what to do.

376
00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.450
That actually,
in fact,
um,
people will,
if you,

377
00:22:40.451 --> 00:22:44.020
if you explain why you're doing it because you want to make this better because

378
00:22:44.021 --> 00:22:46.810
simply you want to make it better and you think it could be better or whatever.

379
00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:50.650
And you lay that out,
that people will be motivated enough by that,
that,
that,

380
00:22:50.651 --> 00:22:53.740
that the numbers and the figures don't necessarily,

381
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:55.900
they're not the things that are pulling you forward.

382
00:22:55.901 --> 00:22:58.720
What's pulling you forward hopefully is your intrinsic motivation in your,

383
00:22:58.721 --> 00:23:01.520
and your desire to do a better job at what you're doing.
And,

384
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:04.990
and the sort of appreciation of the craft and the respect of the work that

385
00:23:04.991 --> 00:23:08.320
you're doing and who you're doing it for and that that's kind of enough and that

386
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.390
everything else is sort of a side effect of that.
Um,
so anyway,

387
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.670
I'd say pick one little thing,
throw it away,

388
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.170
don't worry about it and see what happens.

389
00:23:17.171 --> 00:23:20.230
You'll probably find out that everything's just okay and then maybe you'll have

390
00:23:20.231 --> 00:23:22.960
the courage to try it with another little thing that you are measuring that you

391
00:23:22.961 --> 00:23:24.310
don't really care so much about.

392
00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.880
And I know I'm well aware that this flies in the face of a lot of people's

393
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.080
worldview and maybe even years.
I know you're big into measuring things,

394
00:23:32.081 --> 00:23:34.270
especially health wise and whatnot.
So again,

395
00:23:34.271 --> 00:23:38.050
I think it comes down to also most importantly knowing who you are and what

396
00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:40.930
matters to you and not trying to be like somebody else.

397
00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.170
There's a lot of people trying to be like other people and uh,

398
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.010
I don't want anyone to try and be like

399
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:46.600
<v 3>me.</v>

400
00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.330
You should be like yourself and if there's 5% of what I'm saying makes sense to

401
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:52.820
you,
then maybe you can pull that in and make that part of you too.

402
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:56.360
But I don't think you should be out there trying to be someone else cause that's

403
00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:00.860
a bit of an artificial,
a situation you made it.

404
00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:01.550
You've,

405
00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:06.550
you've mentioned directly and alluded to perhaps a few things I'd like to

406
00:24:07.461 --> 00:24:09.560
underscore just for folks listening.

407
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.820
The first is that you,
when you,

408
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:18.110
when one reads a quote or here's a quote,
like what gets measured,
gets managed,

409
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.600
uh,
it can often be taken to me and that you should manage everything in.

410
00:24:23.601 --> 00:24:25.190
Therefore,
you should measure everything.

411
00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.190
And that there is only upside in measuring,

412
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:33.890
but that's simply not the case.
Uh,
and for instance,

413
00:24:33.891 --> 00:24:37.190
whether it's the,
I remember Andy Grove,

414
00:24:37.191 --> 00:24:42.191
I believe it was an intimate talking about how for every metric that you track

415
00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.890
and hold people accountable for,
you have to include,

416
00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:50.920
identify and then also assess the perverse incentive you've created,

417
00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:55.580
uh,
by imposing that metric.
So if,
if,

418
00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:00.440
if people respond to incentives and you create a metric,
humans being humans,

419
00:25:00.441 --> 00:25:05.441
they will look for easier and easier ways to say goose that number up or chop

420
00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:11.171
that number down and you have to be aware of what that does to their behavior

421
00:25:11.631 --> 00:25:16.070
and so on within the company.
But secondly,
measurement there,

422
00:25:16.071 --> 00:25:21.071
there are things worth measuring and then there are things not worth measuring

423
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:26.390
that can become vanity metrics that people use just to feel productive,

424
00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:28.310
uh,
instead of being productive.

425
00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:33.290
And just to point to one thing that you,
you mentioned,

426
00:25:33.291 --> 00:25:36.110
which I think a lot of people uh,

427
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.700
would assume of me that that is,
I,
uh,

428
00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:44.810
I physically track a lot of things all the time and not say you assume that,
but,

429
00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:46.000
uh,

430
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.960
there is a point to my tracking which is identifying what works for say my

431
00:25:50.961 --> 00:25:54.650
physiology,
what harms me based on my genotype or whatever it might be.

432
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.991
And then I,

433
00:25:55.991 --> 00:26:00.620
and then I just stop the vast majority of measurement and do it very

434
00:26:00.621 --> 00:26:04.910
intermittently.
Right.
The,
uh,
the,

435
00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:09.020
the follow up to that,
but I'd love to ask for people,

436
00:26:09.021 --> 00:26:11.780
since you mentioned you don't read much,

437
00:26:11.781 --> 00:26:16.610
if any trade publications or news,
what do you read?

438
00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:17.630
What are you reading?

439
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:22.580
And maybe that's another opportunity for people to pare back on a,

440
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:25.070
I'm not going to say thoughtless,
it's too judgmental,

441
00:26:25.071 --> 00:26:30.071
but a habit that perhaps consumes a lot of time without adding much value.

442
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.080
Uh,
so what do you,
what do you are,
if not that kind of stuff,

443
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:36.620
what type of stuff do you read and what are you,

444
00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:40.190
what have you been reading recently or what are you reading?
Yeah,
I'll,
I'll,

445
00:26:40.191 --> 00:26:41.540
let me get to that in one second.

446
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:44.040
But I had a thought about the previous question or

447
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.690
<v 4>sort of the genesis of this for me is,
um,
I used to do a lot of jogging.</v>

448
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.430
I still do a little bit,
but,
um,

449
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:54.120
I kind of had some knee surgery while ago and so I've sort of not doing it as

450
00:26:54.121 --> 00:26:58.950
much,
but I remember I'm trying to hit certain times,

451
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.110
like I want to,
um,
you know,

452
00:27:01.111 --> 00:27:05.730
run a six and a half minute mile or whatever it was at the time.
And you know,

453
00:27:05.731 --> 00:27:10.410
I'd go out and I'd run a six minute mile and 42 seconds.

454
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.100
And I remember being disappointed by that and,
and

455
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.510
I remember feeling like White,
why should I be disappointed in that?

456
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:21.810
I'm not running a race,
I'm not competing against anybody,

457
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.780
I'm sort of competing as myself,
but I set that up for myself.

458
00:27:24.781 --> 00:27:29.610
That's not something I had to do.
Like I created that moment to be upset.

459
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.750
What if I just went out and ran because I enjoy running and just kind of run the

460
00:27:33.751 --> 00:27:38.220
best I can every time I run and,
and just do that.

461
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:41.820
And I found that I started doing that and I enjoyed it more and didn't mean I

462
00:27:41.821 --> 00:27:43.470
didn't run faster or slower.

463
00:27:43.471 --> 00:27:45.900
I didn't even necessarily know and it didn't really matter.

464
00:27:45.901 --> 00:27:49.650
I could feel whether or not,
like it was a good run,
like that was a good run.

465
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:54.300
I had a good run today was sort of a much better way to figure out my sort of

466
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:59.220
satisfaction then to measure it and say it was a six minute and 42 minute run

467
00:27:59.221 --> 00:28:02.370
versus a six minute 38 second run.
Uh,

468
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.500
and I think that that's kind of where it sort of came into play for me in

469
00:28:07.501 --> 00:28:07.981
business too.

470
00:28:07.981 --> 00:28:09.990
So I think I pulled it from that and I wanted to share that because I just

471
00:28:09.991 --> 00:28:12.150
remembered that,
that that was sort of a moment.

472
00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.900
And I don't remember how old I was when I did that was probably actually in high

473
00:28:15.901 --> 00:28:19.020
school or early in college or something where I started to think that way.

474
00:28:19.021 --> 00:28:21.930
And that's maybe where that,
where that came from too.
But anyway,

475
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:26.130
I wanted to get that in there.
Um,
uh,
reading,
what am I read?
Well,

476
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:30.930
um,
you know,
I started reading the paper more,
uh,

477
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.230
which is like the newspaper and not,
not,
not online news sources,

478
00:28:34.231 --> 00:28:37.830
but actually the newspaper.
And this happened because I was at a hotel,

479
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:40.260
there's a few years ago,
it was at a hotel and you know,

480
00:28:40.261 --> 00:28:42.750
you go to a hotel and they ask you check in,
they say,
you know,
Joe,

481
00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.400
would you like a newspaper?
And I used to always go,
no newspaper,
who,
who,

482
00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.380
who reads newspapers anymore.
Um,
you know,

483
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.630
cause I get all my news on the Internet,
which is instant all the time.

484
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:56.010
And the thing is most of that is not actually news,
it's entertainment.
Um,

485
00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:00.870
I think the news like once a day is actually a perfectly good pace for the news.

486
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:04.440
So if you get the news in the morning,
uh,

487
00:29:04.441 --> 00:29:07.890
you're basically getting all of yesterday's stuff that happened in the world.

488
00:29:07.891 --> 00:29:12.260
That was,
it's someone,
you know,
some editors decided was important and uh,
and,

489
00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:14.070
and they just said,
they put that in the news,
they print it,

490
00:29:14.071 --> 00:29:16.470
and the next morning you get it.
Um,

491
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:21.090
and then if you wait another full day to get the news again,
pretty good chance,

492
00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:26.220
uh,
that you didn't miss anything actually by paying attention to things all the

493
00:29:26.221 --> 00:29:27.000
time.

494
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.360
Very few things happen during the middle of the day that you really absolutely

495
00:29:30.361 --> 00:29:32.820
need to know that you can't wait for the next morning to know.

496
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:37.350
And so I've realized that the newspaper is actually a better way to get the news

497
00:29:37.351 --> 00:29:40.440
because it's better,
the pace is better.
Um,
it,

498
00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:45.450
it prevents you from searching and seeking out news that you don't need to know

499
00:29:45.821 --> 00:29:50.770
about necessarily.
It prevents you from,
um,
playing the sport.

500
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.920
I call it the sport of information,
like trying to,
to,

501
00:29:53.921 --> 00:29:56.350
to know more than everybody else and be like,

502
00:29:56.351 --> 00:29:59.020
be faster to the latest story than everybody else did it,

503
00:29:59.021 --> 00:30:02.860
this turning into a sport and in fact the news is presented.
If you watch any,

504
00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:05.170
any news channel,
now it's presented as a sport.
I mean,

505
00:30:05.171 --> 00:30:07.630
you've got these Chiron's going across the bottom,

506
00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:09.100
these graphics scrolling across,

507
00:30:09.101 --> 00:30:12.250
you've got talking heads that are sort of debating it.
You,

508
00:30:12.251 --> 00:30:15.640
you turn on ESPN or you can turn on CNN and,
and if you hit the logos,

509
00:30:15.641 --> 00:30:18.850
you wouldn't,
couldn't tell the difference really.
And,
um,
so,

510
00:30:18.851 --> 00:30:21.610
so news coverage has turned into sports coverage and vice versa.

511
00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:26.050
And I just would rather say like once a day is enough,
uh,
of,
uh,

512
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:27.660
of a general,
um,

513
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:32.700
interval for me to be relatively well informed about what's really going on in

514
00:30:33.401 --> 00:30:36.430
the world.
Also at the resolution that matters.

515
00:30:36.431 --> 00:30:38.890
I think the other problem I'm having,
and by the way,

516
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.280
I look at Twitter and I click on links here and there and I read some stuff that

517
00:30:42.281 --> 00:30:45.260
I like,
but,
but for the most part,
um,

518
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:48.340
I'm not trying to find out what happened in hour ago.

519
00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:53.970
And that to me is actually the real advantage to something like the newspaper

520
00:30:54.251 --> 00:30:57.550
where you simply cannot find out what happened an hour ago because what happened

521
00:30:57.551 --> 00:30:59.590
an hour ago in most cases,
doesn't matter.

522
00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:03.330
Now you could say what if there's a national disaster or a major tragedy your

523
00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:04.690
school shooting in your kids at the school?

524
00:31:04.691 --> 00:31:06.850
Like there's all sorts of moments of course,

525
00:31:06.851 --> 00:31:09.910
where realtime truly does matter,

526
00:31:09.911 --> 00:31:11.890
but for the most part it doesn't matter at all.

527
00:31:11.891 --> 00:31:16.600
And in fact it's worse because you become a it,
there's the fear of missing out.

528
00:31:16.601 --> 00:31:19.760
Like I,
I think of it as Joe Mo,
like the joy of it

529
00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:24.740
<v 3>missing out this out
on those things.</v>

530
00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:28.550
Is that,
what did you come up with that?
Yeah,
I mean that's in our new book,

531
00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:32.570
which is like,
it just,
it's great.

532
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.410
I don't need to know all this stuff all the time and,
and yeah,
again,
like look,

533
00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.050
if there's a,
if there's,
I'm in La Right now,

534
00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:42.940
if there's a mud slide like coming to my house,
like I should know about that.

535
00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:46.380
<v 4>Right.
Obviously.
But that's something that might happen every,
you know,</v>

536
00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.410
hopefully never in maybe once a decade.

537
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:52.070
And to say that I need to be informed a realtime about anything that could

538
00:31:52.071 --> 00:31:56.150
possibly happen anytime,
because that one thing might happen once,

539
00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:00.370
that's just a recipe for anxiety and I've tried to avoid that at all.
It all

540
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:03.400
<v 3>costs.
Definitely.
Yeah.
No,</v>

541
00:32:03.401 --> 00:32:06.670
I know you are a fan.

542
00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:11.700
To give one example of a book titled Seeking Wisdom From Darwin to Mongolia by

543
00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:17.260
Peter Bevel.
And uh,
could you describe,

544
00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:22.270
we're just explain why you like that book,
which is also one that I love.

545
00:32:22.271 --> 00:32:25.420
It was actually sent to me by Derek Sivers of all people.

546
00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:27.850
Folks can look him up.
Tim.
Dot.

547
00:32:27.851 --> 00:32:30.790
Blog forward slash Sivers if you want to learn more about him,

548
00:32:30.791 --> 00:32:33.580
but seeking wisdom from Darwin to monger by Peter Devlin.

549
00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.980
Great Book.

550
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:40.580
Can you explain why you liked that book and any books that,

551
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.550
<v 4>uh,
that you're also fond of?
Yeah,</v>

552
00:32:43.551 --> 00:32:47.180
so it's been a while since I've read that.
So book review would,

553
00:32:47.181 --> 00:32:51.020
would be really embarrassing,
but I'll tell you is this,
um,

554
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:56.350
I love Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet is what I love about those two guys.

555
00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:01.360
And of course this book is not written by them,
but it's sort of the,
the,

556
00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:05.960
the spirit of it,
which has this very clear direct,

557
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.100
no bullshit,

558
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:11.420
a way of writing this very sort of simple folksiness that you know,

559
00:33:11.421 --> 00:33:15.590
what life really necessarily,
I mean,
I know this is a broad generalization,

560
00:33:15.591 --> 00:33:19.100
but in most cases it's not that complicated.

561
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.670
We tend to make things very complicated and we tend to make things very hard on

562
00:33:22.671 --> 00:33:23.121
ourselves.

563
00:33:23.121 --> 00:33:26.570
But really there's some basic fundamentals of many things that if you kind of

564
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:27.650
understand those,

565
00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:30.560
you're in pretty good shape and you don't need to go much further than that.

566
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:34.790
And I love that kind of wisdom.
I love old people in general.

567
00:33:34.791 --> 00:33:36.500
So Warren Buffet and Charlie monger,

568
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:39.740
I think mongers in his nineties now and buffets in his eighties but they've

569
00:33:39.741 --> 00:33:40.910
always had this kind of wisdom,

570
00:33:40.911 --> 00:33:45.911
which is this old school almost farmer's Almanac style wisdom.

571
00:33:45.921 --> 00:33:50.921
And I've always been attracted to that because I think complexity is also become

572
00:33:51.741 --> 00:33:55.670
a sport where it's like the more complicated something is,

573
00:33:55.671 --> 00:33:59.090
the better you know,
the better you think you are at.

574
00:33:59.091 --> 00:34:02.390
It is like if you make it more complicated,
you're better at it or something.

575
00:34:02.391 --> 00:34:04.700
And I just think it's kind of the opposite.

576
00:34:04.701 --> 00:34:06.230
So I love those guys in that book to me,

577
00:34:06.231 --> 00:34:09.860
sort of highlighted a lot of that kind of thinking.
Um,

578
00:34:09.861 --> 00:34:11.660
and so anything that that mongers written,

579
00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:14.900
I love reading like Warren Buffett's letter to shareholders,
which I think is a,

580
00:34:14.901 --> 00:34:17.850
is a must read for anybody.
100% agree.
It's,
yeah,

581
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:22.040
forget even just business people.
Just if you want to read clear writing,
uh,

582
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:26.030
if you want to understand what it's like to communicate something at a high

583
00:34:26.031 --> 00:34:28.580
level,
you've got to read what he writes.

584
00:34:28.581 --> 00:34:30.890
So that's the kind of stuff I love the tree.
I love to read.

585
00:34:30.891 --> 00:34:34.070
I like Bayzos his shareholder letters as well for similar reasons.

586
00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.530
That's the kind of stuff I'm really interested in.
It.

587
00:34:36.531 --> 00:34:41.450
I don't read fiction at all.
Uh,
and maybe I'm missing out there,

588
00:34:41.451 --> 00:34:44.840
but I,
I just,
my argument is always that I feel like the,

589
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:48.740
the world is so interesting on its own,
uh,
that there's more than enough.

590
00:34:48.741 --> 00:34:50.060
I can read about real stuff.

591
00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:52.160
I know some people are going to just hate me for this and I,

592
00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:54.890
and I always get hate on it.
Um,
but I,

593
00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:58.190
I just would rather read biographies or I'd rather read about nature.

594
00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:01.670
I'd rather read about that stuff cause this,
the world is fascinating as it is.

595
00:35:01.671 --> 00:35:06.260
So those are the kinds of things I'm into these days.
Uh,
and I,
you know,

596
00:35:06.261 --> 00:35:08.090
I've been reading,
I know you're in deep into this now.

597
00:35:08.091 --> 00:35:11.120
I've been reading a lot about stoicism and been getting into that so that the,

598
00:35:11.121 --> 00:35:14.540
um,
uh,
the,
um,

599
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:19.270
is it the art of Joe Ancient Art of joy or someone said,
uh,
yeah,

600
00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:23.510
the art of Joy by William says on the wing or other,

601
00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.240
I'm blanking.
I'll put it in the show notes for everybody,

602
00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:30.530
which is a compilation of both,

603
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:32.570
I suppose,
excerpts and samples,

604
00:35:32.571 --> 00:35:36.980
but also interpretations and applications of Stoic Philosophy.
Love.

605
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:40.560
I want to say been William Irving.
Maybe that's it.
That's it.
Yeah.

606
00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.620
I think you're right.
I think that's it.
So I read that recently or last year.

607
00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:47.600
I really loved that.
I've been getting into a bit of that.
Um,
I don't know.

608
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:52.410
That's the kind of stuff I'm into these days.
Why is that?
Um,

609
00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:56.130
stoicism or just stoicism.
Yeah.
Um,

610
00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:59.880
it just resonates with me.
A few,
a few basic things.
By the way,

611
00:35:59.881 --> 00:36:01.380
I don't need to go that deep into it.
Again,

612
00:36:01.381 --> 00:36:04.860
it's not like I need to go super deep into the,
you know,
the whole,

613
00:36:04.861 --> 00:36:08.170
the whole world of it.
But basically things like,
you know,
you,

614
00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.850
you pretty much only have control over your reactions to things.

615
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:16.590
And I think that that is,
that in itself is enough.
I could stop there.

616
00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:18.690
Uh,
I,
I go further,

617
00:36:18.691 --> 00:36:23.100
but I could stop there and say that is extremely poignant.
Especially today.

618
00:36:23.101 --> 00:36:27.360
I see people,
you know,
getting so wound up,

619
00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:32.550
uh,
about what other people say and what are other people do.
And uh,
you know,

620
00:36:32.551 --> 00:36:32.970
when you,

621
00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:35.520
when you begin to see that what they're actually being wound up about is their

622
00:36:35.521 --> 00:36:39.140
own reaction to that thing,
not the thing itself,
the thing itself,
you know?
Yeah,

623
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:40.890
maybe it's terrible,
maybe it's great,
whatever it is,

624
00:36:40.891 --> 00:36:44.940
but it's how you sort of respond to it and how you allow it to,
to affect you.

625
00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.400
That's deep and really important.

626
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:50.370
And I think one of the best lessons I've learned in the past few years,

627
00:36:50.371 --> 00:36:51.204
so there's that.

628
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.720
Also just negative visualization I think is a really wonderful tool and they're

629
00:36:54.721 --> 00:36:56.550
paying a lot of attention to that and my life.

630
00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.890
Can you just for people who aren't familiar with that,

631
00:36:58.891 --> 00:37:01.950
would you mind describing that just in brief what that is?

632
00:37:01.951 --> 00:37:05.100
Negative visualization.
Yeah.
As far as I understand it,

633
00:37:05.101 --> 00:37:08.460
at least it's basically figuring out what the worst case scenario might be in

634
00:37:08.461 --> 00:37:09.420
any given situation.

635
00:37:09.421 --> 00:37:12.810
And coming to terms with that and sort of realizing that probably in many cases

636
00:37:12.811 --> 00:37:16.770
it won't be as bad as you think it could be.
So get,
get used to the worst thing,

637
00:37:16.771 --> 00:37:18.870
and David and I talk about this occasionally,
right?

638
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:22.770
So DHH and I talk about this in the business,
like what if we made some grave,

639
00:37:22.771 --> 00:37:23.920
grave,
horrible error.

640
00:37:23.921 --> 00:37:27.570
So the business has been in business for 18 years and what if like,

641
00:37:27.571 --> 00:37:29.790
or what if the competition destroys us or whatever.

642
00:37:29.791 --> 00:37:32.010
Like what if we actually go out of business in two years?

643
00:37:32.011 --> 00:37:34.770
Like what if that actually happens?
We don't want that to happen.
What if it did?

644
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.440
Like what's the worst thing that would happen?
Well,

645
00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:40.470
it would be terrible because a lot of people would lose their jobs and that

646
00:37:40.471 --> 00:37:41.010
would suck.

647
00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:43.980
But we think a lot of people work for us would have no problem finding other

648
00:37:43.981 --> 00:37:47.220
jobs.
So that would maybe be so bad.
Um,

649
00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:50.220
I would have no income and Dave would have no income.
That would suck.

650
00:37:50.221 --> 00:37:52.440
But we've done pretty well for ourselves.
So we can live,

651
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:56.940
we can live fine without that.
Um,
we couldn't do what we love doing every day.

652
00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:59.160
Well that would kind of suck,
but maybe we could still do it,

653
00:37:59.161 --> 00:38:03.240
just not in that capacity.
And you know what a 20 year run isn't so bad.

654
00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.720
Like if we only made it 20 years in business,
that wouldn't be so bad either.

655
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:09.930
So just thinking about like what would be the worst thing that could possibly

656
00:38:09.931 --> 00:38:12.930
happen and then,
you know,
recognizing that probably will not happen.

657
00:38:12.931 --> 00:38:15.850
It just helps you,
I think,
calm down about that.
Um,

658
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.710
and it sort of avoid this constant set of worries in some ways.

659
00:38:19.711 --> 00:38:23.610
You sort of get all the worrying out at once and then you go about your day and

660
00:38:23.611 --> 00:38:25.260
go,
well,
if that happens,
then it happens.

661
00:38:25.261 --> 00:38:28.170
At least I know what that's gonna feel like or what I think that might feel
like.

662
00:38:28.171 --> 00:38:31.070
It's not that it would eliminate all of the feelings and there certainly would

663
00:38:31.071 --> 00:38:32.550
be other negative feelings I may have missed.

664
00:38:32.551 --> 00:38:36.370
But for the most part I've thought it through and I feel like I can probably

665
00:38:36.371 --> 00:38:40.690
cope with it now if that actually happens versus having something surprise you,

666
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.630
um,
in the moment and having it be real,

667
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:46.660
that can be really traumatic and really difficult to handle.

668
00:38:46.661 --> 00:38:49.090
So that's my general understanding of that at least.

669
00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:53.390
<v 3>That's a great description.
Definitely.
I think it's a great description.</v>

670
00:38:53.391 --> 00:38:56.990
And just by analogy,
I was just thinking this,
uh,

671
00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:02.150
some sitting in this room where I do a lot of recording and I did an episode

672
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:05.800
like a former MMA fighter,
but also,
uh,

673
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:11.060
special forces sniper named Tim Kennedy.
And uh,

674
00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:15.020
he's a beast of a fighter and a fascinating guy.
But he was saying,

675
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:19.460
oh,
in my bag right now I have x,
y,
and z firearm.

676
00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:24.410
I have enough first aid that I could patch you in the videographer together.

677
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:26.180
If one of you had an arm chopped off,

678
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:30.420
I'm looking at how I could block the doorway in case of a,
B,
and c and he's,

679
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:35.390
he knows exactly how to assess the situation in specifics.

680
00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:38.930
And the reason that I bring that up is as you were describing this negative

681
00:39:38.931 --> 00:39:41.390
visualization,
I was thinking to myself,

682
00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:46.780
it's something akin metaphorically speaking,
to taking a fear.

683
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:51.020
Let's just say you have a semi nebulous fear of something going wrong.

684
00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:55.670
And let's say that fear is then embodied by a person and that person says,

685
00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:57.230
I'm going to destroy you.

686
00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:01.940
And then you run away and all day or all week you're thinking,
oh my God,

687
00:40:01.941 --> 00:40:04.070
that person's going to destroy me.
How are they going to destroy me?

688
00:40:04.071 --> 00:40:07.310
And there's this ambiguity that's really stress producing.

689
00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.470
But if you were to sit down with that person and say,
okay,

690
00:40:09.471 --> 00:40:10.400
I know you're going to just try me,

691
00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:13.130
but I want to know exactly how you're going to destroy me.
I was like,
well,

692
00:40:13.131 --> 00:40:18.131
first I'm going to ambush you at the corner of second and Colorado and uh,

693
00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:22.250
I'm going to try to hit you with this type of bat.
And you're like,
okay,

694
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:26.490
now I like know where I know what they're going to do.
I have,

695
00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.930
I can start planning a response,
right?
Or they say,
you know,

696
00:40:29.931 --> 00:40:32.270
I'm going to beat you to death with a nerf baseball bat.
And you're like,

697
00:40:32.271 --> 00:40:34.070
that's actually not going to beat me to death at all.

698
00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:39.700
And you start to realize how recoverable a lot of this is.

699
00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:45.500
Uh,
almost all of these fears are either completely unfounded or completely

700
00:40:45.501 --> 00:40:49.760
recoverable or preventable.
And,
uh,
it's,
it's really

701
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:56.470
arguably the most valuable thing I've learned from any type of reading of

702
00:40:56.781 --> 00:41:00.530
philosophy is this negative visualization,

703
00:41:00.531 --> 00:41:04.390
which I tend to do in written form,
uh,
a lot,
uh,

704
00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.440
in an exercise that I call fear setting,

705
00:41:06.441 --> 00:41:11.420
which people can Google and find for free everywhere.
Uh,
but,
uh,
I'll stop my,

706
00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:16.350
my,
my,
my soapbox speech at this point about the fear setting and negative

707
00:41:16.351 --> 00:41:20.600
distalization but it's extremely powerful and I think this is particularly true,

708
00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:23.420
at least in my experience,

709
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:27.320
if you come from a family as I did of warriors,

710
00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:32.380
people who spent a lot of time focused on the future with a high of anxiety and

711
00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:38.060
whether that is,
uh,

712
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.910
in eight to my code,

713
00:41:40.911 --> 00:41:45.911
to my DNA or simply an adopted set of behaviors and beliefs and thought

714
00:41:48.321 --> 00:41:52.700
patterns,
I don't know,
maybe it's a combination,
but it's really been hugely,

715
00:41:52.701 --> 00:41:53.570
hugely helpful.

716
00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:57.750
<v 4>Yeah.
You know,
I feel like that's similar.
Uh,
I,</v>

717
00:41:57.930 --> 00:41:59.730
I feel like I worried a lot and I still do.

718
00:41:59.731 --> 00:42:02.880
I still battle with this and I do kind of feel like it is a battle actually in a

719
00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:06.780
sense.
Um,
with worrying,
um,
[inaudible] I don't,

720
00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:10.260
I stopped worrying about myself,
but I,
I have a three and a half year old now,

721
00:42:10.261 --> 00:42:14.640
so I worry,
I worry about him and I find myself,
uh,

722
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.330
uh,

723
00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:19.740
realizing that like kids are actually really quite resilient and I shouldn't be

724
00:42:19.741 --> 00:42:22.380
worrying so much that that things are going to be just fine.

725
00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:25.840
And it's actually a really good practice for me too,
to use negative visual,

726
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:29.880
negative visualization.
Um,
when I'm worrying about things like,
oh,

727
00:42:29.881 --> 00:42:32.790
he's going to go go to school and get sick and then he's gonna have the flu and

728
00:42:32.791 --> 00:42:34.710
then I'm going to get the flu and if I get the flu then I can't do this.

729
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:36.990
And their whole house,
my wife's gonna get the flu and she's pregnant.

730
00:42:36.991 --> 00:42:40.050
And then like you go through all this stuff and it's like,
yeah,

731
00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.180
that could happen.
And you know,
I can't,
you can't stop it.

732
00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:45.930
I can't prevent kids go to school and they get sick and you might get sick and

733
00:42:45.931 --> 00:42:48.810
like,
okay,
but if you think about how bad it can be,

734
00:42:48.811 --> 00:42:52.590
you start to really ruminate on it versus like,
yeah that could happen.

735
00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:56.680
And if that happens it happens.
You just deal with it and live with it and,
and,

736
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:59.820
but I remember before I got into this negative visualization,

737
00:42:59.821 --> 00:43:02.220
I would actually worry a lot.

738
00:43:02.221 --> 00:43:05.070
And what's cool about negative visualization I think is that it clears the worry

739
00:43:05.071 --> 00:43:07.470
out of the room in a sense.
Like you give it a worry,

740
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:12.120
like you worry about it for a while and then it's,
and it's over.

741
00:43:12.121 --> 00:43:16.530
The worrying is over.
And I think that's the key insight for me in it,

742
00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.410
which is it gives me a moment to say,
yeah,
okay,

743
00:43:19.411 --> 00:43:21.690
I'm going to worry about this and I need to worry about it as bad as it could

744
00:43:21.691 --> 00:43:26.430
possibly be and think about how exactly horrible it could be and then I can then

745
00:43:26.431 --> 00:43:27.330
I'm done with that.

746
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:32.070
And that's the difference compared to consistent low grade,

747
00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:35.670
always on worry where you'd never have that moment where you can really confront

748
00:43:35.671 --> 00:43:38.670
it until it happens,
when it usually doesn't.
Definitely.

749
00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.390
<v 3>And I looked,
I looked up the,
the title of the book,</v>

750
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:44.990
The author is William B Irvine,
Irvine,
California.

751
00:43:44.991 --> 00:43:49.820
And the title is a joy.
Wow.
I can't even read it correctly.

752
00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:53.600
All right,
here we go.
They'd guide to the good life subtitle,

753
00:43:53.601 --> 00:43:55.670
the ancient art of stoic joy.

754
00:43:56.030 --> 00:44:01.030
And that's the one and it is a fantastic introduction to stoicism and by itself,

755
00:44:01.551 --> 00:44:05.610
if you never read another book on the subject.
Extremely,
extremely helpful.
Yeah.

756
00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:10.190
You mentioned,
you mentioned your,
uh,
your son,
right?

757
00:44:10.191 --> 00:44:14.630
You have a son.
And I'm curious if we,
if we turn back the clock,

758
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:19.640
do you remember the first time you got in trouble or any memorable early memory

759
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:22.490
of getting into trouble?

760
00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:26.430
<v 4>Oh my God,
I got into so much trouble when I was younger.
Um,</v>

761
00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:29.580
the first time though,
um,

762
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:36.360
I remember the first time I cried so hard that I almost couldn't breathe.

763
00:44:36.361 --> 00:44:39.460
You know,
that crying,
hyperventilating.

764
00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:44.820
I remember why it happened,
but I'm sure I did something really bad.
Uh,

765
00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.430
and,
and I think my,
my,
uh,

766
00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:50.310
my parents like reminded me how bad it was.

767
00:44:50.311 --> 00:44:52.200
There's something and I got really scared,
I think,

768
00:44:52.201 --> 00:44:56.580
I don't remember how old I was,
but I remember that moment.
Um,
I,

769
00:44:56.581 --> 00:45:00.600
but I,
I,
I've gotten a lot of trouble when I was younger.

770
00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.130
Probably should have gotten in more trouble.

771
00:45:02.131 --> 00:45:06.000
I probably got away with too many things as well.
Um,
but,
uh,
I got,

772
00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.820
I got into a lot of trouble with my parents who have to take me up at the police

773
00:45:08.821 --> 00:45:12.600
station when I was younger,
when I was younger.

774
00:45:12.601 --> 00:45:16.530
Like I'm talking like 15,
that's like that kind of thing.

775
00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:21.240
Or 14 junior,
actually junior high was bad.
Like what does that 13,

776
00:45:21.241 --> 00:45:24.870
14 something that similar kind of area?
Yeah,
I was,
I was really bad.

777
00:45:24.871 --> 00:45:27.360
I kind of got in with a,
with a bad crowd and,
and,

778
00:45:27.361 --> 00:45:32.230
and started doing some bad stuff.
Um,
although it wasn't so bad.
What type of,
what,

779
00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.800
what were the offenses?
Let's get specific.
Okay.

780
00:45:34.801 --> 00:45:37.320
So it's actually entrepreneurial stuff

781
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:42.960
<v 3>side by side.
Hustle right before it was called that.</v>

782
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:47.940
Oh,
continue.
Sorry,

783
00:45:47.941 --> 00:45:52.050
I'm just imagining the expression you just made like the winds as I,
as I said,

784
00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:55.470
well
go ahead.

785
00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:59.910
<v 4>I was,
um,
I don't know when the entrepreneurial bug bit me,</v>

786
00:45:59.911 --> 00:46:04.760
but it didn't even really,
and um,
I loved,
um,

787
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:10.410
knives and like throwing stars and like switch blades,

788
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:13.140
although I couldn't get those cause it was a real legal,
um,

789
00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:16.290
I just love that kind of stuff.
How I,
how old are you?

790
00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:20.850
So you don't mind me asking?
Um,
I'd probably today 43.

791
00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:23.920
<v 3>Okay.
So yeah,
we,
so we're of the same vintage,</v>

792
00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:29.150
so I had too much caffeine,
so I'm interrupting you.
But the uh,

793
00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:34.890
we grew up when like Ninjas and breakdancing were as cool as it could,

794
00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:37.750
as cool as you could possibly be.

795
00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:41.080
And there was a catalog called Asian world of martial arts.

796
00:46:41.081 --> 00:46:44.890
I don't remember this.
Awma yeah.
Anyway,
just to put some context.

797
00:46:44.891 --> 00:46:47.380
So at that time people like you and me,

798
00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:52.390
it was not infrequent that young guys,
definitely,

799
00:46:52.391 --> 00:46:56.830
mostly young guys would fantasize about throwing stars and climbing clause and

800
00:46:56.831 --> 00:47:01.790
grappling hooks.
So just on that,
just to set on stage,
please continue.
So

801
00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.010
<v 4>how,
I don't remember how this happened somehow.</v>

802
00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:08.250
Maybe it was my dad who got on this mailing list or I got on this,

803
00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:11.040
like we were starting to get these catalogs at home and one of them was that
one,

804
00:47:11.041 --> 00:47:13.500
another one is called sportsman's guide.
Um,

805
00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:17.880
there's a few other ones where it's kind of like army surplus sees stuff and I

806
00:47:17.881 --> 00:47:20.040
don't really remember exactly how it all happened,

807
00:47:20.041 --> 00:47:23.160
but I started looking through the pages and there were these cool knives and

808
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:26.280
throwing stars and like some ballistic nights,
like knives,

809
00:47:26.281 --> 00:47:30.460
you can actually shoot with a spring,
like crazy shit.
It's crazy stuff.

810
00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:34.590
And I just got into it and like tear gas and let's kind of weird shit.
So,

811
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:37.750
so as this,
I mean,
at 13 year old boy,

812
00:47:37.751 --> 00:47:40.150
for me it was just the coolest thing in the world,
right?
I don't know why,

813
00:47:40.151 --> 00:47:45.151
but I was so into it and for sure I started to take these catalogs and make

814
00:47:45.791 --> 00:47:50.791
xerox copies of these pages and then cut them out and then reassemble my own

815
00:47:51.611 --> 00:47:55.000
catalog.
Um,
and I would like re I would,

816
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:56.920
I would kind of scratch out the prices and,

817
00:47:56.921 --> 00:48:00.340
and like put new prices on them and then make catalogs,

818
00:48:00.341 --> 00:48:02.770
which I would then distribute to my friends,
my friends.

819
00:48:02.771 --> 00:48:07.300
Then I would buy these knives and stuff for me.

820
00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.160
Um,
I would then,

821
00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:12.460
so I'd take these orders and I would make an order form and everything and I

822
00:48:12.461 --> 00:48:17.320
would take these things,
and this is back in like 85.

823
00:48:17.321 --> 00:48:20.560
I remember I got my first Mac in [inaudible] 85 and so I was like using my Mac

824
00:48:20.561 --> 00:48:23.560
to like print stuff out and my image writer or whatever I had at the time.

825
00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.680
And I'd make these catalogs and these order forms and print the stuff out and

826
00:48:26.681 --> 00:48:29.650
distributed to some friends and they would like make orders.
I get the,

827
00:48:29.651 --> 00:48:30.940
I get the cash in them.
They,

828
00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:34.810
everyone had like part time jobs so they give me some cash.
I'd get the cash,

829
00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:38.650
I would place an order through these catalogs for this stuff.

830
00:48:38.651 --> 00:48:40.180
I'd order it cod because,

831
00:48:40.181 --> 00:48:42.730
which I don't know if they have that anymore called cash on delivery.

832
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:45.130
I don't think they have that anymore,
but I didn't have a credit card.

833
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:48.280
For those of you who are much younger and don't remember or don't know what this

834
00:48:48.281 --> 00:48:51.640
was,
ups could actually come to your tier house,

835
00:48:51.641 --> 00:48:55.230
bring a package and you would pay the ups driver,
the ups driver,

836
00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.990
then take that money and put an envelope and then send it back to the company.

837
00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:02.470
That's how you'd actually buy things sometimes.
So anyway,
I get cash,

838
00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:07.330
I'd order stuff,
cod,
I'd fake that I was sick that day and stay home from school.

839
00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:10.030
I knew when it was gonna be delivered,
the ups driver would come,

840
00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:13.150
I would give him the cash,
uh,

841
00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:16.450
and I get these things and I distribute them to my friends and I would make

842
00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:17.860
profit.
Um,

843
00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:21.550
and then I did that with like cigarettes and chewing tobacco and all sorts of

844
00:49:21.551 --> 00:49:26.050
stuff.
And so I kinda like that.
Then I had a bit of a reputation as a Pyro,

845
00:49:26.051 --> 00:49:30.160
cause I love fireworks and fire and stuff.
So I'd like,
Hey.
Anyway,
I got,

846
00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:32.260
I got into a lot of trouble eventually as you can imagine,

847
00:49:32.261 --> 00:49:37.261
selling contraband to a 15 year old boys in the suburbs of Chicago.

848
00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.940
Um,
and then like,
you know,

849
00:49:39.941 --> 00:49:43.750
I kinda got in with the wrong crowd and then like all sorts of weird things

850
00:49:43.751 --> 00:49:48.220
happen at some point.
But anyway,
um,
eventually got that out of my system.

851
00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:53.020
But I,
that's how I started getting into being an entrepreneur is,
is that,

852
00:49:53.021 --> 00:49:56.170
and I love the idea of carving up other people's catalogs and making my own.

853
00:49:56.171 --> 00:50:01.171
And then I got a resellers license somehow and got into electronics and started

854
00:50:01.310 --> 00:50:04.960
being able to buy things at like dealer costs from these big distributors.

855
00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.960
And then like for example,
radar detectors,
so people could,

856
00:50:07.961 --> 00:50:10.460
my friends could speed that,
you know,
16 so like,
let's go speed,

857
00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:13.190
let's go get it and returned,
tucked her in her car.
So I buy writer or to,

858
00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:16.420
or is it like costs doubled the price on and my friends cause they couldn't get

859
00:50:16.421 --> 00:50:21.160
them.
And telephone like cordless phones,
you know,
back then like,

860
00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:23.740
and then computer hard drives in the early days.

861
00:50:23.741 --> 00:50:28.190
And then computers and that's Kinda how I got into all this stuff.
But it was,

862
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:32.840
it was,
um,
it's funny cause like the way I think about business today,

863
00:50:32.841 --> 00:50:35.150
even the business I'm in today,
base camp,

864
00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:38.750
I just see it as a continuation of when I was 13 selling knives,
honestly,

865
00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:43.780
like it's all one business where I'm buying or making the thing that I want and

866
00:50:45.291 --> 00:50:47.210
then finding other people who want the same thing.

867
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:51.320
It's the same business as it ever was when I was at 13 and is today,
um,

868
00:50:51.321 --> 00:50:52.790
I'm not selling illegal stuff now,

869
00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:57.290
but then that same spirit and uh,
anyway,

870
00:50:57.291 --> 00:50:58.540
so I got in trouble.
I don't remember what,
you know,

871
00:50:58.610 --> 00:50:59.810
I got in trouble probably before that too,

872
00:50:59.811 --> 00:51:02.390
but my parents let me get away with a lot as an only child.

873
00:51:02.391 --> 00:51:06.830
So I think they'd let me get,
get away with extra,
an extra amount of stuff.
Um,

874
00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:12.140
but,
uh,
those early days I think paved the way for me to really learn,
uh,

875
00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:16.700
how to,
you know,
how to sell things,
how to market things,
how to promote things,

876
00:51:16.701 --> 00:51:20.510
how to package things,
how to mark things up,
and how to also charge for things,

877
00:51:20.511 --> 00:51:22.520
which is in a strange way,

878
00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:26.570
the thing that's so deficient about our industry today or the tech industry,

879
00:51:26.571 --> 00:51:27.960
which is like a lot of people don't,
they don't,

880
00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:29.210
a lot of companies don't charge for it.

881
00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:32.000
They give stuff away for free and then they have to live with all of these
other,

882
00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:35.090
um,
uh,
the negatives of that,

883
00:51:35.091 --> 00:51:38.840
which we're even seeing play out in the news now.
Um,
so anyway,

884
00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:41.300
I learned a lot of lessons from doing the wrong thing.
Let's say

885
00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:45.810
<v 3>you mentioned a bunch of weird things happened.
We're not,</v>

886
00:51:45.850 --> 00:51:47.140
we don't necessarily have to go into that,

887
00:51:47.141 --> 00:51:50.100
although I'm certainly happy to go into one of them.
Let's do it.

888
00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.110
And then you're like,
I got it out of my system.
I'm like,
well,

889
00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:55.630
for a lot of people,
they never quite get it out of their system.

890
00:51:55.631 --> 00:51:56.680
So there had to be,

891
00:51:56.950 --> 00:52:01.950
I would imagine catalyzing event or events or something that encouraged you to

892
00:52:03.611 --> 00:52:05.920
get her once.
So let's,
let's go into one.

893
00:52:06.370 --> 00:52:11.050
<v 4>There wasn't,
there weren't.
So first of all,
um,
I had this friend,</v>

894
00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:15.310
I won't mention his name,
but he was a bad influence on me.
Um,

895
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:19.170
my parents had spotted him,
immediately said,
this kid's no good.
We don't want to,

896
00:52:19.171 --> 00:52:21.910
we don't want you to be with this kid.
But anyway,
um,

897
00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:26.290
I still was cause he was cool and I wanted to be cool.
Um,
anyway,
uh,

898
00:52:26.291 --> 00:52:31.240
one day during lunch,
um,
we put a,
uh,
uh,
like a tic tac,
like a mint.

899
00:52:31.241 --> 00:52:34.840
It wasn't a tic TAC,
but as some sort of mint in this other kid's milk.
Okay.

900
00:52:34.841 --> 00:52:39.550
At school.
And,
um,
after he drank his milk,
we told them,
this is again,

901
00:52:39.551 --> 00:52:41.860
I'm so ashamed of this whole thing.
But anyway,
um,

902
00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:43.480
we told them that we poisoned him.

903
00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.960
<v 3>Right,
right.
Bad.
It's bad.</v>

904
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:52.590
And how old are you?
You're 15,
15 or something like pork.
This is kind of,
I mean,

905
00:52:52.591 --> 00:52:55.710
I hate to say it,
not to excuse it,
but sort of par for the course.

906
00:52:55.711 --> 00:52:57.030
15 year old boy behavior

907
00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:02.180
<v 4>shitty.
But I'm just being honest.
So we did that obviously didn't poison anybody,</v>

908
00:53:02.181 --> 00:53:06.350
but like we told them we did.
Okay.
And um,
and it's funny because we,

909
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:09.380
it wasn't a bullying thing is actually a friend of ours.
So it wasn't like,

910
00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:12.330
it wasn't like we were picking on anybody.
He's like a friend of ours and,

911
00:53:12.331 --> 00:53:17.331
and we did this anyway in math class later that day he passes out because he was

912
00:53:17.601 --> 00:53:20.090
probably anxious and thought we poisoned him.

913
00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:25.530
So he has to get his stomach pumped because he thought he told,

914
00:53:25.531 --> 00:53:26.364
he told them,

915
00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:29.610
it's like he told the teachers then they'd like the police got involved and he'd

916
00:53:29.611 --> 00:53:32.070
been poisoned and I had to go down to the police station.

917
00:53:32.071 --> 00:53:35.220
My parents had it like take me to the police station and all this shit.

918
00:53:35.221 --> 00:53:38.430
And it was like,
it was,
it was a mint,
you know,
but it was,
it was,

919
00:53:38.431 --> 00:53:41.760
we set this up in a way where he didn't think it was.
And so on.
Anyway,

920
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:43.380
that was some of the shit I got into.

921
00:53:43.381 --> 00:53:46.950
And eventually I got into that and a couple of the things.
Um,

922
00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:51.890
eventually my parents said,
hey,
look,
um,
enough,

923
00:53:52.210 --> 00:53:56.550
uh,
if you get in trouble again,
we're sending you off to boarding school.
Um,

924
00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:57.503
which means you're,
you're,

925
00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:00.450
you're away from all your friends and your way from us and the whole thing.

926
00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:04.470
And it was that statement alone that changed everything for me.

927
00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:08.220
I don't know why either.
I didn't even know what boarding school was.

928
00:54:08.221 --> 00:54:11.250
It probably sounded kind of cool.
Like I get to go away and sleep away.

929
00:54:11.251 --> 00:54:13.560
Like there's something kind of almost cool about it in a sense,

930
00:54:13.561 --> 00:54:15.090
like when you don't really know what it would be,

931
00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:18.630
but they said it in such a stern way that it was so clear that this was not

932
00:54:18.631 --> 00:54:21.060
where I want it to go and what I wanted to or I want it to be.
Right.

933
00:54:21.061 --> 00:54:23.700
The tone made it clear.
It was not desirable for you.
Yes.

934
00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:28.230
And that was the moment when I basically Aye.
Aye.
Aye.

935
00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:31.510
Went back to my old friends were awesome.
I never really left them,

936
00:54:31.511 --> 00:54:33.320
but I kinda sorta did and,

937
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:37.030
and they were very cool about it and they kind of welcomed me back basically.

938
00:54:37.031 --> 00:54:41.520
And I just stopped doing all that shit.
I just stopped it.
Um,

939
00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:44.290
and it sounds like how,
how could I have just stopped it?

940
00:54:44.291 --> 00:54:48.300
But it's probably because I wasn't really,
it was sort of this,

941
00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:52.990
this stunt that I was pulling and not really what I wanted to do was just kind

942
00:54:52.991 --> 00:54:56.200
of a fun thing when I realized that there were consequences and once I realized

943
00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:59.230
are true consequences,
I,
uh,

944
00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:04.120
I changed it and I think that was kind of the,
the thing for me is that,
um,

945
00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:08.880
especially when I was younger,
I would sort of do things I remember like,

946
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:13.930
so I went to Hebrew school like after school and I hated it,

947
00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:17.740
absolutely hated it because it was like two hours Tuesdays and Thursdays after

948
00:55:17.741 --> 00:55:21.730
school.
I wasn't religious.
My parents weren't really either,
but they sort of,

949
00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.980
it was just sort of something that everyone in the neighborhood did.

950
00:55:23.981 --> 00:55:24.791
And I kind of did.

951
00:55:24.791 --> 00:55:27.350
And it was out of respect for my grandparents who were more religious anyway.

952
00:55:27.351 --> 00:55:30.250
So I went to this thing like two days a week after school and I would,

953
00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:34.900
I remember,
I remember my dad telling me once it like,
um,
cause I was,

954
00:55:34.901 --> 00:55:37.780
I was kind of bad there too.
I was actually extra bad there.

955
00:55:38.050 --> 00:55:40.690
I would always like question the teacher's like,
well wait,
prove it.

956
00:55:40.691 --> 00:55:42.550
Can you prove that God again,
is this like stuff like that.

957
00:55:42.551 --> 00:55:43.890
I was just being an asshole,
you know,

958
00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:47.990
and cause like I was just pushing them cause I knew you couldn't prove it and

959
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.280
was just being,
and so that was just like,
uh,
being difficult anyway.
Um,

960
00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:57.100
I got in trouble and my dad would be surprising to hear.
Right.

961
00:55:57.970 --> 00:56:01.990
And so my dad,
my dad's like,
you know,
he's like,
you shouldn't do this,

962
00:56:01.991 --> 00:56:02.950
but I just want you to know,

963
00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:05.940
like none of this goes on your record in other record that you always,

964
00:56:05.941 --> 00:56:08.160
I don't know if you've ever threaten her.
Yeah,

965
00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:14.640
exactly.
Pristine record as a kid.
So I had the,

966
00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:18.090
the record and there is no record thing,

967
00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:21.480
but I didn't know what at the time until my dad's like,
so my dad's like,

968
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.691
you know,

969
00:56:21.691 --> 00:56:24.820
this isn't gonna go on your record and actually like made me do more bad shit.

970
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:28.410
Um,
and eventually I got kicked out of Hebrew school,
um,

971
00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:31.090
for like doing some other stuff,

972
00:56:31.091 --> 00:56:35.140
which I really don't go into gross insubordination.
Yeah.
Basically.

973
00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:38.860
And they just had enough of me and they knew I had enough of them and the whole

974
00:56:38.861 --> 00:56:41.800
thing and they let me like go through and do get my bar Mitzvah and they like,

975
00:56:41.801 --> 00:56:44.840
let me do that,
but they're like,
just don't come to school anymore.
Okay.
Um,

976
00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:47.050
<v 3>so that was creative differences.
Yeah.</v>

977
00:56:49.550 --> 00:56:53.060
<v 4>So anyway,
all those things,
like at some point I just,
I,</v>

978
00:56:53.130 --> 00:56:55.510
my parents kind of said boarding school or,
you know,

979
00:56:55.560 --> 00:57:00.510
stop or this and I stopped and,
um,
you know,
back then I,
I,
you know,

980
00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:06.270
as,
as high school kids,
do you drink a bit.
And I got that all on my system also.

981
00:57:06.271 --> 00:57:08.100
Like all that stuff.
I kind of get out of my system.

982
00:57:08.101 --> 00:57:11.130
And this comes from one of the reasons I didn't really like college cause in

983
00:57:11.131 --> 00:57:13.620
college everyone was experimenting with stuff for the first time.

984
00:57:13.621 --> 00:57:15.990
In a sense I feel like I'd already been through all that.

985
00:57:16.530 --> 00:57:19.020
And so the social experience in college was,

986
00:57:19.021 --> 00:57:21.090
was actually really boring for me and,

987
00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:24.840
and almost felt childish actually because I felt like I'd been through it when I

988
00:57:24.841 --> 00:57:27.300
was a child and now I see everyone else doing that.

989
00:57:27.301 --> 00:57:30.960
And so I didn't really enjoy college at all for that reason.
Um,

990
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:34.280
and I just sort of kind of muddled through and got it done.
Um,

991
00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:38.540
and then by that point I was already doing website design,
like freelance.

992
00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:41.790
I had a software business that I had already started on the side selling

993
00:57:41.791 --> 00:57:45.630
software that I've made to organize my own music collection and all this stuff I

994
00:57:45.631 --> 00:57:46.560
started sort of doing.

995
00:57:46.561 --> 00:57:49.110
And to me college was actually just getting in the way of me getting out there

996
00:57:49.111 --> 00:57:50.910
and doing the things that I really wanted to do.

997
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:56.500
<v 3>So you mentioned organizing your music collection and uh,</v>

998
00:57:56.530 --> 00:57:59.480
we,
we could dig into that.
I remember reading a story about it,

999
00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:03.410
people could send you in $20 uh,

1000
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:07.760
to get audio file right.
They'd be to upload to AOL.

1001
00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:11.450
And so I read the story of getting this,

1002
00:58:11.570 --> 00:58:14.690
you were getting this envelope from Germany or some other country,

1003
00:58:15.050 --> 00:58:18.650
the Air Mail envelope that I'm sure some people have seen with the red and blue

1004
00:58:18.651 --> 00:58:23.240
around the edges and uh,
Lo and behold,

1005
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:26.660
right order form $20 bill,
like big deal.

1006
00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:31.580
It was that the first time that you were like,

1007
00:58:31.581 --> 00:58:32.630
Holy Shit,

1008
00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:37.690
like I could do this or I'm an entrepreneur or I'm successful.

1009
00:58:38.151 --> 00:58:39.060
Like,
do you remember,
uh,

1010
00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:44.650
of these many entrepreneurial experiments and ventures that you've been involved

1011
00:58:44.871 --> 00:58:48.980
with was,
was there a particular incident that stands out?
Like,
wow,

1012
00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:52.520
holy shit like this.
This is something that I could actually make a living doing?

1013
00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:53.390
I could do this.

1014
00:58:53.850 --> 00:58:57.270
<v 4>Yeah.
The 20 well,
first of all,
I never thought about making a living really,</v>

1015
00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:00.090
but I thought about what was different about the,

1016
00:59:00.091 --> 00:59:04.010
the the software getting 20 bucks in the mail for software that I made was that

1017
00:59:04.011 --> 00:59:06.480
I was the first time I realized,
actually let me step back.
I,

1018
00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:08.520
I've been selling stuff before.
We talked about that,

1019
00:59:08.521 --> 00:59:13.260
like sort of throwing stars to that Shit.
I had to do work for that.

1020
00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:17.100
Like I had to work,
I had to make a sale each time I had to get inventory.

1021
00:59:17.101 --> 00:59:19.440
Each time I would sell inventory to have to get more inventory.

1022
00:59:19.441 --> 00:59:21.830
I have to go out and convince my friends to buy more shit.
Right.

1023
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.820
What was different about the software thing was that I could make this thing

1024
00:59:25.821 --> 00:59:26.654
once.

1025
00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:30.680
I could put it out there into the world and a lot of people could pay me for it

1026
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:34.070
and I could in a sense make money while I was sleeping.

1027
00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.680
I didn't think about it necessarily that way.

1028
00:59:36.681 --> 00:59:39.680
I do like I can look back on it now and say that's what I felt.

1029
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:40.580
I didn't feel it that way,

1030
00:59:40.581 --> 00:59:44.580
but what I did realize was that I could make something that I wanted.
Um,

1031
00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:49.100
I could put a lot of effort into it and put it out there and let it speak for

1032
00:59:49.101 --> 00:59:51.530
itself.
And if people liked it,

1033
00:59:51.590 --> 00:59:55.280
they'd be happy to pay for it and that people are happy to pay for things and

1034
00:59:55.281 --> 00:59:58.220
that like,
I don't have to go out and sell each one.

1035
00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:02.390
I could put it up and people could buy it from all over the world when they find

1036
01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:04.040
it on their own.
That was,

1037
01:00:04.041 --> 01:00:07.670
I think the distinctly different thing for me at that moment versus everything

1038
01:00:07.671 --> 01:00:12.380
else I'd done in the past was sort of one off sales,
including like,
you know,

1039
01:00:12.410 --> 01:00:15.620
eventually I was doing some logo design and website design,

1040
01:00:15.621 --> 01:00:18.470
which came a little bit later,
uh,
after,
well actually,

1041
01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:19.970
I'm not sure what the timeline was,

1042
01:00:19.971 --> 01:00:23.390
but even that you have to find a client every time and you a find someone new

1043
01:00:23.391 --> 01:00:27.800
every time and the whole thing,
um,
and,
and software was different.

1044
01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:32.030
And that's probably,
and that's what I do today cause I make software,

1045
01:00:32.031 --> 01:00:34.270
we put it out there and technically,

1046
01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:37.940
technically you're making money while you're sleeping because it's running and

1047
01:00:37.941 --> 01:00:40.700
people pay you on a monthly basis and,
uh,
you know,

1048
01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:43.520
you kind of make it once and put it out there versus,

1049
01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:45.020
although of course you're making it every day,

1050
01:00:45.021 --> 01:00:47.660
you're changing it and tweaking it,
but it's still the same spirit.

1051
01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:52.790
So that was the big change for me,
I think.
Um,
and then,
you know,
I,

1052
01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:57.640
I,
I realized that,
um,
the,
the deeper realization though,
again,
is that like,

1053
01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:01.040
I don't,
I can make this for myself.

1054
01:01:01.070 --> 01:01:06.070
I can satisfy myself and that then the next step is to find other people like

1055
01:01:07.251 --> 01:01:11.660
you versus trying to dominate an industry.

1056
01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:14.510
And I think this is a fundamental thing that we have today at base camp,

1057
01:01:14.511 --> 01:01:17.430
which is I have no interest Dj.
Should I talk about it?

1058
01:01:17.431 --> 01:01:22.040
That we have no interest in dominating anyone or any thing.
We don't land.

1059
01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.950
I'm not out for land grab.
I don't know what our market share is.

1060
01:01:24.951 --> 01:01:28.280
I could care less.
It doesn't matter to me.
Uh,
none of this stuff.

1061
01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:32.030
I'm not looking to put any competitors out of business.
I'm not looking to,
to,

1062
01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:35.600
to be number one.
None of that stuff matters.
What matters is,

1063
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:37.520
can I make something that I like?

1064
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:41.780
Can we put it out there to support our costs and make more money than we spend?

1065
01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:46.760
And if that means we have 1% market share or 0.1% market share,
fine with me.

1066
01:01:46.761 --> 01:01:49.700
I don't care if it means we have 50% market share found me.
I don't care.

1067
01:01:49.701 --> 01:01:52.390
None of that matters.
What matters is can I,
what,

1068
01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:56.690
can I build something I like and can it be sustainable and connect,
fund our,

1069
01:01:56.691 --> 01:02:01.550
our continued development and endeavors.
And that's also what the music thing,

1070
01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:02.510
cause I made it for myself.

1071
01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:07.540
I was loaning out my cds and tapes to friends and never getting them back.

1072
01:02:07.701 --> 01:02:10.940
And I forgot who I loved them too.
And so I'm like,

1073
01:02:10.941 --> 01:02:14.210
well what maybe if I organize this I could like have an inventory of all the

1074
01:02:14.211 --> 01:02:17.660
stuff.
I have bootlegs and cds and the whole thing.

1075
01:02:17.661 --> 01:02:18.950
And whenever I loaned out to someone,

1076
01:02:18.951 --> 01:02:23.100
I'll just like note the date and who it was.
And then I have the,

1077
01:02:23.101 --> 01:02:26.430
I'll build a system that will send me a reminder about that 30 days later and I

1078
01:02:26.431 --> 01:02:29.490
can go,
hey,
hey bill,
remember that CD that I led you have?

1079
01:02:29.491 --> 01:02:31.620
I said I need this weekend.
Like I still don't have it.

1080
01:02:31.621 --> 01:02:35.350
And then I would get all my stuff back.
And so,
you know,
that's kind of what,

1081
01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:38.580
what I've been doing ever since.
It says building stuff that,
that works for me.

1082
01:02:40.030 --> 01:02:45.030
<v 3>So I want to tell a story through your words about how the world welcomed you</v>

1083
01:02:47.741 --> 01:02:50.740
with open arms and immediately started buying everything that you have to sell.

1084
01:02:50.741 --> 01:02:55.220
So I'd like to read a bit of text here.
Okay.
Uh,

1085
01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:00.240
and I'm pretty sure this is not a misquote since you a typed it out and sent it

1086
01:03:00.791 --> 01:03:03.190
to me sometime ago.
Here we go.

1087
01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:05.890
Way Back in the 90s when I was getting started as web designer,

1088
01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:09.910
I sent my work into an award site called high five.com at the time it was the

1089
01:03:09.911 --> 01:03:12.490
shit,
if you were awarded a high five words,
you were recognized.

1090
01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:16.870
Now I sent my stuff in and then we leave his name out just so I don't have

1091
01:03:16.871 --> 01:03:20.020
anybody chasing me around.
The Guy who ran it emailed me back.

1092
01:03:20.110 --> 01:03:23.050
I don't have the original email anymore,
but basically he told me I sucked.

1093
01:03:23.110 --> 01:03:26.020
I had no business being in the web design business and that I should never email

1094
01:03:26.021 --> 01:03:30.820
him again.
That rejection filled me with so much fire,
not anger,
not resentment,

1095
01:03:30.821 --> 01:03:34.420
not disappointment,
but fire,
fire to kick ass and prove his impression wrong.

1096
01:03:34.450 --> 01:03:36.250
I love the rejection.
It made me,

1097
01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.520
and that was in response to a question I asked you,

1098
01:03:39.521 --> 01:03:43.000
which was how has a failure or apparent failure set you up to leave success?

1099
01:03:43.001 --> 01:03:47.590
That was in my last book,
tribe of mentors and my question about this,

1100
01:03:47.591 --> 01:03:51.070
and you can certainly take this anywhere you want if you want to elaborate,

1101
01:03:51.071 --> 01:03:55.210
correct.
Do anything else,
but my question,
uh,

1102
01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:59.290
speaking personally as someone who has struggled with anger,

1103
01:03:59.291 --> 01:04:02.140
I mean I spent so much of my childhood being bullied really badly.

1104
01:04:02.141 --> 01:04:03.370
I was born premature,
really,

1105
01:04:03.371 --> 01:04:08.371
really small and with a lot of health issues up until about sixth grade that I

1106
01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:13.920
built up this anger that I used as fuel to then later compete and fight and do

1107
01:04:16.751 --> 01:04:20.680
all of these things so that I wouldn't be taken advantage of it again.
Oh,

1108
01:04:20.681 --> 01:04:21.401
effectively,
right.

1109
01:04:21.401 --> 01:04:26.401
I mean there was just a coping mechanism and now I've realized that anger is

1110
01:04:28.481 --> 01:04:33.481
very often not helpful and that it is the acid that damages the vessel,

1111
01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:38.770
not that which it is poured upon.
Right.
So the,
the,
the line,
I'll read it again.

1112
01:04:38.771 --> 01:04:41.410
That rejection filled me with so much fire,
not anger,
not resentment,

1113
01:04:41.411 --> 01:04:42.730
not disciplined,
but fire.

1114
01:04:45.070 --> 01:04:50.070
How in what was the self talk that made it fire and not anger or resentment,

1115
01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:53.020
if that makes any sense.
Or how do you,

1116
01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:58.180
how you transmute what could be a negative response into something that's

1117
01:04:58.181 --> 01:05:00.310
actually helpful in a case like this?

1118
01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:03.960
<v 4>Yeah,
I remember that distinctly because um,</v>

1119
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:08.370
it was the first time I got enough courage up to sort of submit work to a d to a

1120
01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:13.371
award site thing and the rejection was so uh,

1121
01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:17.920
in your face,
like you suck,
basically don't do this.
Um,

1122
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:20.560
that it,
because it was so,

1123
01:05:21.370 --> 01:05:23.770
it was almost a caricature of a row of a rejection.

1124
01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:27.070
Like they're actually going to be like,
you suck.
Don't do this.

1125
01:05:27.071 --> 01:05:29.560
Like no one would ever say that.
But he did

1126
01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:37.030
that.
It almost made me laugh and be like,
I'm just going to prove you wrong.

1127
01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:40.120
It was that kind of energy that was the fire.

1128
01:05:40.121 --> 01:05:42.430
Like I have always in those cases,

1129
01:05:42.431 --> 01:05:46.730
I've always responded to those sorts of moments as,
as,
as,

1130
01:05:46.731 --> 01:05:51.731
as motivation to prove somebody wrong or to like prove myself.

1131
01:05:52.151 --> 01:05:56.590
Right.
Maybe,
uh,
and maybe that's sort of a bit of the flaw.

1132
01:05:56.590 --> 01:06:00.670
I still have to work out or one of those too,
but I just wanted to,
to say,

1133
01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:03.820
okay,
well fuck you.
I'm going to show you that I can do this.

1134
01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:06.790
And I don't even know.
I don't,
I shouldn't even care right now.

1135
01:06:06.791 --> 01:06:10.090
I realize that this is like my reaction to someone like,
Oh,

1136
01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:14.110
who cares about this guy?
Who cares what he thinks about my work?
Um,

1137
01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:18.800
it's also tied to the fact that like,
I just,
I know,
you know,
look,

1138
01:06:20.170 --> 01:06:23.860
um,
obviously I come from a position of privilege to say this whole thing,

1139
01:06:23.861 --> 01:06:27.160
but like,
I've just,
I don't let people offend me.

1140
01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.490
And I have been in situations where,
uh,
like for example,

1141
01:06:30.491 --> 01:06:31.660
I mentioned that I mentioned earlier,

1142
01:06:31.661 --> 01:06:34.570
I'm Jewish and I remember in college some people called me a Kike,

1143
01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:38.170
which is a fucking horrible slur.
And I,
I've,
I've had people,

1144
01:06:38.171 --> 01:06:40.880
like I've walked by a penny and they're like,
oh,
you should pick that up.
Like,
I,

1145
01:06:40.881 --> 01:06:45.070
I've had some of that shit.
Right.
Um,
and it's like,
it doesn't matter.

1146
01:06:45.071 --> 01:06:49.440
I don't care.
To me,
that kind of stuff.
Uh,
just,

1147
01:06:49.450 --> 01:06:52.780
there's never upset me cause it's cause it's like that's just a reflection on

1148
01:06:52.781 --> 01:06:56.140
the other person's ignorance or point of view.

1149
01:06:56.170 --> 01:06:58.360
I've never let that kind of stuff get to me.
And I think that,

1150
01:06:58.570 --> 01:07:02.620
is that something your parents instilled in you?
I mean,
that's not the norm.

1151
01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:06.130
That's not the most common reaction.
Yeah.
I don't know where it came from.

1152
01:07:06.131 --> 01:07:08.260
I don't know where that came from,
but I've just never,

1153
01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:13.620
I've never remembered ever feeling offended by anyone's sort of slight at me for

1154
01:07:14.501 --> 01:07:18.280
whatever reason.
And like,
look,
I,
I'm,
you know,
I'm five,
seven,

1155
01:07:18.281 --> 01:07:20.080
so I'm relatively short guy.

1156
01:07:20.081 --> 01:07:22.690
Like there's been those kinds of things that you have,

1157
01:07:22.691 --> 01:07:25.990
like there's all sorts of stuff that,
that,
that you get,
you know?
Um,

1158
01:07:25.991 --> 01:07:28.890
and I know a lot of people have a way fucking worse than I do.
So I,

1159
01:07:29.030 --> 01:07:31.510
I totally get all of that.
I'm just using like,

1160
01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:35.480
like all the only examples I have are my own right.
And so,
but I,

1161
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:38.470
I bet I've been in those situations where I could see someone flipping over it

1162
01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:41.320
and be like,
Whoa,
what the fuck?
That's the horrible thing to say and well,

1163
01:07:41.321 --> 01:07:44.500
how could you ever say it somebody?
And I've just never felt that way.
I'm like,

1164
01:07:44.501 --> 01:07:48.830
okay,
that's where you come from.
Fine,
that's fine.
Like,
I,

1165
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:53.680
I don't really even have the energy or the care to try and set you right or

1166
01:07:53.681 --> 01:07:58.180
whatever.
It's not my job.
I don't really want to do it.
Um,
I,
it is what it is.

1167
01:07:58.181 --> 01:08:01.870
It kind of disrupted,
bounces off me in a sense.
Um,
but one thing,

1168
01:08:01.871 --> 01:08:05.890
one reaction I have had is his motivation.
That's the thing that I've always had.

1169
01:08:05.891 --> 01:08:07.900
When someone says,
I can't do something or,

1170
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:12.310
or I'm not this enough or I'm not that enough,
it's motivation to prove,

1171
01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.010
prove that wrong.
Um,

1172
01:08:14.110 --> 01:08:17.570
and I don't know if it's the dark and dirty side of it is like,

1173
01:08:17.571 --> 01:08:19.880
is it actually revenge or is it motivation?

1174
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:23.600
And I'm not sure that I necessarily know,
uh,
what that is.

1175
01:08:23.601 --> 01:08:26.060
Maybe I think it's motivation,
but maybe it's more revenge,

1176
01:08:26.061 --> 01:08:30.790
which is a pretty crappy,
uh,
emotion or whatever that would be called.
Um,

1177
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:34.520
but,
um,
I never do it trying to hurt somebody.

1178
01:08:34.521 --> 01:08:39.200
So maybe it is motivation,
not revenge,
but I'm not totally sure to be honest.
Um,

1179
01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:43.100
but I don't know where it came from.
Uh,
but,
um,

1180
01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:46.430
I just never remember ever being angry about something that someone said about

1181
01:08:46.431 --> 01:08:49.070
me or how they've judged me or whatever.
I just never really cared.

1182
01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:55.370
<v 3>Well to maybe provide a contrast to that.</v>

1183
01:08:55.670 --> 01:08:56.503
It,
um,

1184
01:08:56.750 --> 01:09:01.430
it seems like you have an importance for the wasting time because it seems like

1185
01:09:01.431 --> 01:09:04.400
you have a strong dislike for wasting time.
And you've,

1186
01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:06.470
you've talked about this before,
written about it.

1187
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:11.930
What rules for yourself,
commandments,
systems,

1188
01:09:11.931 --> 01:09:15.560
anything do you have in place to help minimize time wasting?

1189
01:09:16.930 --> 01:09:18.730
<v 4>So something I,
I think I had mentioned,</v>

1190
01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:23.170
I wrote this up in your book actually as a response is sort of,
um,
first of all,

1191
01:09:23.171 --> 01:09:26.710
getting better at saying no is the critical thing to begin with.

1192
01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.560
And being honest about the things you really want to do and things you really

1193
01:09:29.561 --> 01:09:32.560
don't want to do and not sort of just doing things because you feel obligated

1194
01:09:32.561 --> 01:09:35.260
because it will make someone else feel good and like you who knows how someone

1195
01:09:35.261 --> 01:09:36.250
else is actually going to feel.

1196
01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:39.770
It's sort of presumptuous to suggest that I should do something because it'll

1197
01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.790
make someone else happy.
Uh,

1198
01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:45.790
it's actually kind of hard to know what makes people happy and,
and uh,
so I,

1199
01:09:45.791 --> 01:09:46.870
I try not to,

1200
01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:51.640
I try not to go down that road because I think you can find yourself in a

1201
01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:56.240
difficult spot and you know,
it's,

1202
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:57.640
it's really hard to do.
Um,

1203
01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:02.410
so I've just tried to get better at saying no and really recognizing the things

1204
01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:05.530
I like to do and I don't like to do,
I've kind of described my,

1205
01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:08.920
my life has a weird description of my life,

1206
01:10:08.921 --> 01:10:10.810
but partial description on my life is like,

1207
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:14.800
I just tried to do everything I can to avoid hassles.
I don't like hassles.

1208
01:10:14.801 --> 01:10:18.190
And to me a hassle is like something I don't want to do in the future.

1209
01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:20.860
It's almost never something I have to do now.

1210
01:10:20.861 --> 01:10:22.180
It's something you have to do in the future.

1211
01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:25.430
And so something I've been getting better and better at is,
is,

1212
01:10:25.530 --> 01:10:28.690
is basically just being honest with people who ask me to do things far,

1213
01:10:28.691 --> 01:10:33.610
far in advance and say I can't make commitments that far in advance.

1214
01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:35.560
I know that you need a commitment that far in advance.

1215
01:10:35.561 --> 01:10:39.220
They're planning an event or you're doing,
I totally understand that.
But I,
I,

1216
01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:43.030
I find that,
um,
I tend to,
um,

1217
01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:46.750
this is a strong word and it's not fair.

1218
01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:50.470
It's what other people are doing.
So it's gonna come off strange.

1219
01:10:50.471 --> 01:10:52.820
But I don't think of it in terms of that,

1220
01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.090
that what they're about to do isn't worth it.

1221
01:10:55.091 --> 01:11:00.091
But I tend to regret things that I say yes too far in advance because not

1222
01:11:00.401 --> 01:11:01.870
because of the thing itself,

1223
01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:05.620
but because it actually prevents me from having opportunities to,
to,

1224
01:11:05.621 --> 01:11:08.350
to explore other things in the moment when I get there,

1225
01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:12.880
then I might be more interested in doing so this comes back to the goal setting,

1226
01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:14.250
perhaps.
Maybe it's all the same thing,

1227
01:11:14.251 --> 01:11:19.230
which is that I don't know how I'm going to feel six months from now on Friday

1228
01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:21.570
night at four o'clock,
uh,
speaking,
uh,
you know,

1229
01:11:21.571 --> 01:11:22.920
where I'm scheduled to speak in an event.

1230
01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:25.410
Maybe I'd rather not be doing that six months from now.

1231
01:11:25.710 --> 01:11:28.860
The only way I'm going to know that is to basically wait until that moment and

1232
01:11:28.861 --> 01:11:30.300
decide whether or not I want to do that.

1233
01:11:30.301 --> 01:11:35.100
But of course I can't cancel on people if,
if I,
if I booked at events,
you know,

1234
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:39.720
so I've just,
I've just found in my life that the things I put on my calendar,

1235
01:11:39.721 --> 01:11:42.610
because it's so easy to put something foreign advanced on your calendar because

1236
01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:47.250
it costs nothing in a sense.
Um,
it doesn't take any of your time now.

1237
01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.220
It doesn't take any time next week.
It's like,
you know,
four months from now.

1238
01:11:50.221 --> 01:11:52.800
Sure I'll do that.
And then it comes up on that and I'm like,

1239
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:56.220
I wish I wouldn't have said yes to that.
Not because of the thing itself,

1240
01:11:56.221 --> 01:11:58.390
but because of the feeling of,

1241
01:11:58.391 --> 01:12:03.391
of being now obligated to do something they may not choose to want to have done

1242
01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:06.990
in that moment.
Had I had the choice then or now,

1243
01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:13.620
<v 3>can you give us some sample language or just a basic kind of template that you</v>

1244
01:12:14.231 --> 01:12:15.880
would use to polite.
Decline.

1245
01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:17.290
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1246
01:12:17.290 --> 01:12:19.540
<v 3>Politely declined something.
Somebody hits you up,</v>

1247
01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:22.480
let's just say you actually know them.
They're like,
hey,

1248
01:12:23.470 --> 01:12:26.380
six months from now on such and such a date,
we're having this event,

1249
01:12:27.490 --> 01:12:30.930
ABC impressive speakers are coming,
would let that blah,
blah blah.
Right.

1250
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.530
So then what is your response look like?
Well,
I mean sometimes it that will

1251
01:12:34.530 --> 01:12:39.240
<v 4>say yes,
but most of the time I'll say,
I'll say,
you know,
thanks for writing.</v>

1252
01:12:39.241 --> 01:12:40.710
I appreciate the invitation.
Um,

1253
01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.560
I can't book anything that far in advance right now.

1254
01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:47.010
I have a hard time filling my calendar six months ahead of time or something

1255
01:12:47.011 --> 01:12:49.770
like that.
I'll let me think about the language.
Basically.
I wouldn't say,

1256
01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:54.810
I would say,
uh,
um,
I,
I can't book anything that far in advance.

1257
01:12:55.290 --> 01:12:58.110
Um,
sometimes it's because I'll,
I'll be specific,

1258
01:12:58.111 --> 01:13:01.440
like my wife is pregnant and I can't like died that's too close.

1259
01:13:01.441 --> 01:13:03.450
So I can't do that.
But there's other times I'm just like,

1260
01:13:03.810 --> 01:13:06.240
I just can't book that far in advance.
Um,

1261
01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:10.720
if if there's an opening closer and you need someone like Lemmy know,
then,
um,

1262
01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:14.140
I'd be happy to do it or perhaps another time.
But six months from now is,

1263
01:13:14.141 --> 01:13:18.030
it's just too far off for me to book things is kind of what I'll say.
Um,

1264
01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:23.070
and you know,
uh,
I always try to,
first of all,

1265
01:13:23.071 --> 01:13:24.630
it's an honor to be invited to anything.

1266
01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:28.560
The fact that anyone wants to hear me talk is still surprises me.
Um,

1267
01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:30.420
and so I'm always,

1268
01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:33.390
I always appreciate it and I'm sure I always make sure to lead with that,

1269
01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:36.330
but then I just,
I,
I'm honest about it,

1270
01:13:36.331 --> 01:13:38.430
which is I can't put anything on my calendar that far in advance.

1271
01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:42.510
I can't book things that far in advance.
Um,
also another thing,
like for example,

1272
01:13:42.570 --> 01:13:47.460
um,
I've been asked a lot recently to speak internationally and,
and,

1273
01:13:47.461 --> 01:13:50.230
um,
and I'll just tell people which is true.

1274
01:13:50.231 --> 01:13:54.110
Like I just don't like to travel internationally for business.
Um,

1275
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:57.240
if I want to go somewhere,
I'd like to go somewhere because I,
you know,

1276
01:13:57.241 --> 01:14:00.280
for personal reasons,
but I,
I don't like to travel internationally for business,

1277
01:14:00.281 --> 01:14:01.410
so I'll just say like,
I,

1278
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:03.510
I'm just not traveling internationally for business right now.

1279
01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:06.360
It's not something I'm really doing.
So I appreciate the invitation.
Again,

1280
01:14:06.361 --> 01:14:09.750
if you ever have an event that you had states let me know that kind of stuff.
Um,

1281
01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:13.330
because I think if you make up stories,
it's just why,
why,

1282
01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:17.350
why not just be honest and clear about it and,
and you know,

1283
01:14:17.351 --> 01:14:21.970
people are very understanding actually.
They go,
I totally get that.
Um,
hey,

1284
01:14:21.971 --> 01:14:24.820
if we have an opening,
I'll let you know,
uh,
if not,
no big deal.

1285
01:14:24.821 --> 01:14:25.720
Maybe another time,

1286
01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:29.200
maybe there's some other thing we have coming up that's that sooner I said,
yeah,

1287
01:14:29.201 --> 01:14:31.360
of course.
Let me know if something sooner.
That'd be,
that'd be great.

1288
01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:34.270
So it kind of do it that way.
And by the way,
this,
this,
um,

1289
01:14:34.730 --> 01:14:37.570
I was sort of inspired by,
and I don't know if this is true,

1290
01:14:37.810 --> 01:14:41.680
I read somewhere that Warren buffet kind of does this with meetings.

1291
01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.950
I don't know if,
again,
I don't know if this is true.
I read it.
Um,

1292
01:14:45.250 --> 01:14:47.960
which is that if you want to meet with him,
uh,

1293
01:14:48.010 --> 01:14:52.390
you basically have to write his assistant or whatever the day before.

1294
01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:55.930
So if you,
if you,
if you write,
I'm sure there's exceptions to this rule,

1295
01:14:55.931 --> 01:14:59.440
but for most cases if you want to meet with him,
you can't say,
hey,

1296
01:15:00.190 --> 01:15:04.330
I'd like to meet with,
you know,
I'm going to be an Omaha in March,
uh,
March 22nd.

1297
01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:09.070
Uh,
can I,
can I meet up with Mr Buffet or something?
And uh,

1298
01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:11.980
the answer would be when you get an on the 21st,
uh,

1299
01:15:12.010 --> 01:15:14.380
email me then and if he has any openings the next day,

1300
01:15:14.650 --> 01:15:17.920
then he'd be happy to meet with you.
And now of course,

1301
01:15:17.921 --> 01:15:20.230
he's Warren Buffet people and I've written about this,
be like,
Oh,

1302
01:15:20.231 --> 01:15:23.500
he's Warren Buffet.
Like the thing is,
is that yeah,
he is Warren Buffet,

1303
01:15:23.501 --> 01:15:25.930
but you or you and your time is yours,

1304
01:15:25.931 --> 01:15:28.990
just like his is his and his attention is his and yours is yours.

1305
01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:32.380
And who cares how wealthy he is.
What does it have to do with any of this?

1306
01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:35.740
Who cares what position he's in.
I understand that.
Like,
yeah,
he,
he,

1307
01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:39.760
he is in a position where he can maybe say no more frequently than others,

1308
01:15:39.761 --> 01:15:41.350
but so can a lot of people,

1309
01:15:41.351 --> 01:15:44.770
I don't think people give themselves enough credit and give no enough credit and

1310
01:15:44.771 --> 01:15:49.270
defend their own attention and time as they,
as much as they should.
Um,

1311
01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:54.220
people will,
will protect money,
they'll protect all sorts of things,

1312
01:15:54.221 --> 01:15:57.220
but they won't protect their,
their attention and their time.
And,
and,
uh,

1313
01:15:57.221 --> 01:15:58.990
I think more people should get better at that.

1314
01:15:58.991 --> 01:16:01.960
So I've been practicing getting better at that and I was sort of inspired in

1315
01:16:01.961 --> 01:16:05.050
part by,
by hearing about if it's true or not,
I don't know.

1316
01:16:05.051 --> 01:16:09.120
But hearing about how buffet does that and how people respond to the

1317
01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:11.100
<v 3>boundaries that you set,</v>

1318
01:16:11.101 --> 01:16:16.101
particularly if you do so tactfully tells you quite a lot about the,

1319
01:16:19.041 --> 01:16:22.950
uh,
the,
the nature of your true relationship.

1320
01:16:24.150 --> 01:16:25.650
That's true too with these people.

1321
01:16:25.651 --> 01:16:30.651
I remember one time I was going through a very difficult period and was trying

1322
01:16:31.591 --> 01:16:36.591
to set up a number of different rules to simplify and clear my calendar and it

1323
01:16:38.341 --> 01:16:40.260
also just took me a long time to get back to people,

1324
01:16:40.261 --> 01:16:42.060
even people I carried quite a lot about.

1325
01:16:42.061 --> 01:16:45.600
But the people who are really close to me know that that is the case.
Who knows,

1326
01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:47.610
I could be lost in the Amazon jungle for three weeks.

1327
01:16:47.611 --> 01:16:51.120
Like they don't get too upset about things.
And uh,

1328
01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:56.280
at one point I got a,
got an angry text from this,

1329
01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:59.880
uh,
more of an acquaintance,
very powerful guy.

1330
01:16:59.970 --> 01:17:03.480
And he said he was like,
Tim,
Dude,
what the hell?

1331
01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:05.880
Like you're harder to get ahold of than the president.

1332
01:17:05.881 --> 01:17:07.920
I just talked to him last week or something like that.

1333
01:17:08.430 --> 01:17:12.470
And then we hopped on the phone and he was really upset.

1334
01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:15.860
And I said,
well,

1335
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:19.850
the president has a bigger team than I do.
And number one,

1336
01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:22.130
and number two,
like,
I hate to say it,

1337
01:17:22.131 --> 01:17:23.480
but you're being really aggressive right now.

1338
01:17:23.481 --> 01:17:28.040
Like of all the things on my list of priorities,
including my family and this,

1339
01:17:28.041 --> 01:17:30.200
and I mentioned a few things that were pretty heavy,

1340
01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:32.480
like you're kind of number 17 right now.

1341
01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:34.970
And that doesn't mean that you're unimportant to me,

1342
01:17:34.971 --> 01:17:37.370
but it means that you just have to wait until I'm done with the first 16.

1343
01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:41.210
So like if,
if you can't do that,
I get it,
I suppose,

1344
01:17:41.211 --> 01:17:45.650
but it's not gonna change.
And,
uh,
it's a,

1345
01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:49.160
it's definitely a learned skill.
Uh,
it means I've absolutely,

1346
01:17:49.190 --> 01:17:51.980
and you've maybe had this experience,
but when my first book came out,

1347
01:17:51.981 --> 01:17:56.981
I was so absolutely astonished that anyone would pay me anything to talk about

1348
01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:03.410
anything that I said yes to everything that came in.

1349
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:06.980
And then six months later I was like,
oh my God,

1350
01:18:06.981 --> 01:18:11.980
I feel like I'm in death of a salesman.
This is,
yeah,
this is awful.
And,
um,

1351
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:17.390
over time they become better at setting parameters.
You've mentioned,

1352
01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:22.130
uh,
since we're talking about Warren Buffet,
clear thinking and clear writing,

1353
01:18:22.730 --> 01:18:27.730
which you seem to value very highly and in doing a little bit of homework for

1354
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:30.760
this conversation,
uh,

1355
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:34.520
I've read and you can tell me if this is true or still the case,

1356
01:18:34.521 --> 01:18:39.521
but how one of your top hiring criteria is whether the person is a great writer,

1357
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.701
uh,

1358
01:18:40.701 --> 01:18:45.701
whether the person can communicate well in written form is I'd love for you to

1359
01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:51.620
say whether that is still the case or not and why that is the case.

1360
01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:56.690
<v 4>Yeah,
it's definitely the case.
It's sort of been the case for forever for us.
Um,</v>

1361
01:18:58.590 --> 01:19:02.780
it's the case because first of all,
most communication is written these days.
Uh,

1362
01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:05.180
and first of all,
let me step back.
Like we're remote company,

1363
01:19:05.181 --> 01:19:09.150
so especially most of the communication is written.
Uh,
if you're going to have,

1364
01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:11.880
if you're a local company and you're having meetings all the time,

1365
01:19:11.881 --> 01:19:14.700
sometimes verbals enough,
but for most,
in most cases,

1366
01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:18.240
people are writing more and more and more than they ever have before.
Um,

1367
01:19:18.690 --> 01:19:23.340
and one of the most costly and inefficient things is having to repeat yourself,

1368
01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:28.740
uh,
or answer questions about something that should have been clear in the first

1369
01:19:28.741 --> 01:19:30.380
place.
Eh,
it's,

1370
01:19:30.381 --> 01:19:34.650
it's re really quickly if you can't communicate clearly,

1371
01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:35.670
um,

1372
01:19:35.670 --> 01:19:39.600
you're communicating probably three or four times more frequently than you need

1373
01:19:39.601 --> 01:19:43.950
to.
Um,
and that can be really inefficient and really frustrating,

1374
01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:48.850
extremely frustrating.
So we've always looked at writing as clear writing as,

1375
01:19:48.851 --> 01:19:49.171
as a,

1376
01:19:49.171 --> 01:19:52.170
as a prerequisite for every position we have at the company because everybody's

1377
01:19:52.190 --> 01:19:53.610
supposed to communicate with themselves,

1378
01:19:53.611 --> 01:19:54.960
with the rest of the company and with their team.

1379
01:19:54.961 --> 01:19:57.900
And most of it's done done via the written word.

1380
01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:02.760
And we also,
for example,
the first,
by the way,
the first,

1381
01:20:02.761 --> 01:20:05.880
the first sort of gatekeeper of it is,
is the,
is the cover letter.

1382
01:20:05.881 --> 01:20:08.370
So when people apply for a,
if they don't,

1383
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:11.100
if they just like send a resume or whatever,
they're out instantly.

1384
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:13.140
That's not even something we look at.
Um,

1385
01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:17.910
I always read or I always want to see a cover letter of some sort.

1386
01:20:17.911 --> 01:20:19.630
It can,
it can just be an email of course with a,

1387
01:20:19.650 --> 01:20:23.040
with an attachment of the resume or whatever.
But,
um,
I want to see how you,

1388
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:26.220
how you open the conversation,
you know,

1389
01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:29.030
how do you describe yourself,
uh,
why,

1390
01:20:29.031 --> 01:20:31.740
why are you applying for this job and not just any job.

1391
01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:35.220
And you can tell very quickly if someone's going to,

1392
01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.290
if someone can explain themselves,

1393
01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:40.410
if someone can advocate for themselves and advocate for their ideas and their

1394
01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:44.220
position and who they are and why they should work here.
Um,
if,
if there,

1395
01:20:44.221 --> 01:20:46.110
if they're clear minded,
if they're friendly,

1396
01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:47.670
like all that stuff come through and writing.

1397
01:20:47.671 --> 01:20:51.060
I think if you pay enough attention to the words,
you can see a lot of that.
Um,

1398
01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:55.830
and uh,
um,
also for example,
when I hired designers,

1399
01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:59.800
I look at their design,
but I look at their writing almost a little bit more.
Um,

1400
01:20:59.850 --> 01:21:01.320
whenever we hire a designer,

1401
01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:05.040
when we get down to the last five candidates that we are really think could be

1402
01:21:05.041 --> 01:21:08.760
finalists,
we hire them to do a project for us,
um,

1403
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:10.230
1500 bucks for a week.

1404
01:21:10.231 --> 01:21:12.930
And they do a project for us so we can kind of see their actual work.

1405
01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:17.580
But even more importantly is we ask them to write up why they did what they did.

1406
01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:21.750
Um,
because there's a lot of great designers out there,

1407
01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:23.940
but people have to advocate for themselves.

1408
01:21:23.941 --> 01:21:25.520
And so I want to see why they do what they did.

1409
01:21:25.521 --> 01:21:28.260
I don't want to hear they're not here,
but read their,
their,

1410
01:21:28.530 --> 01:21:31.200
their point of view and their line of thinking and how they came up with the

1411
01:21:31.201 --> 01:21:32.034
solutions.
And,

1412
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:35.940
and that helps me when I read that helps me understand what would be like to

1413
01:21:35.941 --> 01:21:38.800
work with that person for real.
Um,
you know,

1414
01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:41.430
are they able to explain why they did what they did?

1415
01:21:41.431 --> 01:21:44.940
Are they glossing over a little details that actually matter?
Like what is it,

1416
01:21:44.941 --> 01:21:47.490
how do they,
how do they see their work and how do they write about it?

1417
01:21:47.850 --> 01:21:51.390
It's a very important part of,
of the job here at base camp.
So,
um,
yeah,

1418
01:21:51.391 --> 01:21:53.130
so writing is important in every position.

1419
01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:55.920
It doesn't matter what position you're in,
you still have to be a great writer.

1420
01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:58.820
We typically start by looking at the cover letter.
Um,
the,

1421
01:21:58.821 --> 01:22:03.780
the actual like work assignments to get hired here typically involve writing no

1422
01:22:03.781 --> 01:22:05.760
matter what,
what the position,
and I just think it's,

1423
01:22:05.761 --> 01:22:10.110
it's always proven in our case to be a really good indicator of someone's

1424
01:22:10.111 --> 01:22:14.880
success here whenever we've been,
so we hire someone where like,
ah,
I don't know,

1425
01:22:14.881 --> 01:22:16.890
there's just,
the writing wasn't quite right.

1426
01:22:17.370 --> 01:22:20.820
It almost always pans out that it turns out that they're not the right fit for

1427
01:22:20.821 --> 01:22:22.530
the company.
Even if their work was great,

1428
01:22:22.531 --> 01:22:26.610
but they're just unable to really convince people and persuade people based on

1429
01:22:26.611 --> 01:22:30.390
their sort of a,
a missing bit of,

1430
01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:33.520
it's not magic,
but I'll call it that in the writing or,

1431
01:22:33.610 --> 01:22:36.060
or where you read something about this is,
this is great.

1432
01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:42.100
<v 3>I'd love to dig a little deeper on the example you gave with the design</v>

1433
01:22:42.101 --> 01:22:44.200
finalists.
Let's say you're hiring for a position.

1434
01:22:44.201 --> 01:22:48.730
You have a handful of folks you've narrowed it down to and a,
you're paying,

1435
01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:52.480
you're going to pay each of them $1,500 for a one week project.

1436
01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:55.390
Do you assign them a project to give them a range of projects?

1437
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:58.920
Can I love a little bit more in terms of specifics and then when you ask them

1438
01:22:58.930 --> 01:23:01.750
like why did you do what you did,
what you ended up doing,

1439
01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:06.730
do you provide them with guidelines for how to that or you keep it totally open

1440
01:23:06.731 --> 01:23:07.120
ended?

1441
01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:12.040
I'd love for you just to walk us through a hypothetical or real example of what

1442
01:23:12.041 --> 01:23:15.760
the project could look like and how it unfolds from there.

1443
01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:17.200
<v 4>Yeah.
And the first,
first of all,</v>

1444
01:23:17.201 --> 01:23:22.201
the reason why we do that is because you basically can't trust anyone's design

1445
01:23:22.211 --> 01:23:23.650
work in the past.

1446
01:23:24.010 --> 01:23:29.010
And the reason why is because a lot of people work with other people and you

1447
01:23:29.501 --> 01:23:34.450
don't really,
really know what they did.
Like you'll,
we'll get,
we'll get,

1448
01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:37.900
you know,
resumes like I did nike.com it's like,
no,
you didn't.

1449
01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:44.380
<v 3>You worked on nike.com I can't tell what you did.
Exactly.</v>

1450
01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:45.673
Um,

1451
01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:47.080
<v 4>and so you'll see a lot of that.</v>

1452
01:23:47.081 --> 01:23:49.600
Or you'll see people share screenshots with you of things and you're like,

1453
01:23:49.601 --> 01:23:51.730
you know,
I just don't know the process that went into that.

1454
01:23:51.731 --> 01:23:53.100
So it's hard for me to judge it.

1455
01:23:53.130 --> 01:23:56.500
It's not that I don't think that works good or bad,
it's a none of that.

1456
01:23:56.501 --> 01:24:01.380
It's like I just don't know what I'm evaluating here.
So the idea is that,
um,

1457
01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:03.340
once we get down to the five finalists,

1458
01:24:03.341 --> 01:24:05.650
after looking at work and looking at writing and the whole thing,

1459
01:24:05.651 --> 01:24:08.950
we feel these five people could be great fit for this particular position.

1460
01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:11.740
We give them all the same assignment.

1461
01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:14.940
And the assignment is sometimes there's actually a,

1462
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.400
there's sometimes there is a choice like two or three different assignments,

1463
01:24:18.401 --> 01:24:22.270
but for the most part,
historically it's been one.
Lately we've been doing a few,

1464
01:24:22.271 --> 01:24:23.104
but it's been one

1465
01:24:24.630 --> 01:24:27.760
where everybody's who's applying for this job does the same project.

1466
01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:29.890
Everyone gets a week to do it.

1467
01:24:29.950 --> 01:24:32.060
They have to figure out how to fit that in and what their rest of their,

1468
01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:32.920
their day,

1469
01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:37.030
most people have jobs already so they've maybe have to work at night or whenever

1470
01:24:37.031 --> 01:24:39.250
they do it.
Um,
and we're,
we're,
you know,

1471
01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:41.800
I'm well aware of the fact that they don't have a lot of time,

1472
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:43.540
so I'm not expecting perfection.

1473
01:24:44.110 --> 01:24:46.780
This is part of the reason why I look at the writing and the explanation of the

1474
01:24:46.781 --> 01:24:50.770
work because I recognize that,
you know,
who knows,
maybe you have a full time job,

1475
01:24:50.771 --> 01:24:53.290
maybe you have kids at home,
maybe you don't make whatever it is,
whatever it is.

1476
01:24:53.291 --> 01:24:56.200
Maybe you only have an hour a day to do this on the side and you're already

1477
01:24:56.201 --> 01:25:00.040
tired.
I get all of that.
So I'm more interested in the,
in you know,

1478
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:03.130
how you approached the project and how you describe what you did and why you did

1479
01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:05.050
it.
Um,
so anyway,
they would do,
for example,

1480
01:25:05.051 --> 01:25:09.250
we take a screen from base camp and say,
um,
so to get really specific about this,

1481
01:25:09.251 --> 01:25:13.780
like,
uh,
here's the,
here's the way you add people to a base camp project.
Um,

1482
01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:17.410
what would you do to make this better?
Now you have no data.

1483
01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:21.190
You're not talking to anybody about it.
I just want to know what you would do.

1484
01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:22.270
Like,
what would,
what would you do?

1485
01:25:22.271 --> 01:25:25.450
Because a lot of the work at base camp is all based on what would you do?

1486
01:25:25.451 --> 01:25:29.000
We don't,
we don't do a lot of user testing.
We don't do,

1487
01:25:29.050 --> 01:25:32.920
we do use customer interviews and stuff,
but we don't get into a testing lab.

1488
01:25:32.921 --> 01:25:35.330
We don't watch people use our product.
We don't do any of that.

1489
01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:40.000
And we don't really look that much like usage data to really determine what

1490
01:25:40.001 --> 01:25:44.140
we're going to do.
So a lot of this is about gut and feel and what would you do?

1491
01:25:44.141 --> 01:25:46.150
What's wrong with the screen in your opinion?

1492
01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:48.370
And really interesting people's opinions.

1493
01:25:48.371 --> 01:25:50.710
I want people to have a point of view when I hire them.

1494
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:52.540
I don't want people to say,
well,

1495
01:25:52.541 --> 01:25:55.960
I need this data and that data to make decisions.
I go,
yeah,
yeah,
I get all that.

1496
01:25:55.961 --> 01:25:58.810
But what would you do?
I want to know what you,
I'm hiring you,
what would you do?

1497
01:25:58.811 --> 01:26:03.130
So anyway,
so they do the work and then,
um,
they,
they,
uh,

1498
01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:06.080
present it and I say,
I say,
present it any way you want.

1499
01:26:06.081 --> 01:26:10.160
So there are no guidelines.
Um,
I just say present it any way you want,

1500
01:26:10.161 --> 01:26:11.720
but what I guess the one guideline is like,

1501
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:14.090
I want to understand why you did what you did.

1502
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:17.690
So some people present this work is like an elaborate website with a bunch of

1503
01:26:17.691 --> 01:26:20.900
different screens.
Some people present it as a pdf,
a static pdf,

1504
01:26:20.901 --> 01:26:24.710
some people write something up and sort of tell a linear story with screenshots

1505
01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:27.290
interspersed.
There's a variety of different ways people do it.

1506
01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:30.920
But ultimately I'm looking at the explanation of the work and the and the,

1507
01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:35.120
and the sort of the,
the,
the thought behind the ideas that are presented.

1508
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:36.890
That's what I'm most curious about.

1509
01:26:36.891 --> 01:26:40.280
It's not necessarily whether or not the work is great because you're already a

1510
01:26:40.281 --> 01:26:43.610
finalist.
So I already know that you're capable of designing things.
Well,

1511
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:48.170
what I want to make sure I understand is,
is where the ideas are coming from,

1512
01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:49.730
how they're filtering through your head,

1513
01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:54.200
how they're filtering through your fingers into the design itself.
Um,
and,

1514
01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:57.260
and why you did what you did and can you defend it.

1515
01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:00.230
One of the things is even when I disagree,
even when I should say,

1516
01:27:00.231 --> 01:27:03.260
even when I agree with the,
the the solution,
I'm,

1517
01:27:03.290 --> 01:27:05.430
I'm always going to push back on it,
um,

1518
01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:09.890
in these kind of situations because I want to see how people take criticism as

1519
01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:11.300
well.
That's a big part of this,

1520
01:27:11.301 --> 01:27:15.110
which is like constructive criticism and critique.
I want to see that.

1521
01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:18.110
One of the things we don't do and we don't believe in at all or like these

1522
01:27:18.111 --> 01:27:22.700
riddles and this bullshit tests crap,
right?
The Mckinsey,

1523
01:27:22.701 --> 01:27:26.670
how many golf balls can you fit into?
Seven 47 type stuff.
I said,
yeah,

1524
01:27:26.890 --> 01:27:29.930
the all like everything we tried to do it at base camp is about real stuff.

1525
01:27:29.931 --> 01:27:32.690
So like this is actually a real project that we would take on and it's not

1526
01:27:32.691 --> 01:27:35.900
bullshit and it's real.
So that's the getting riddles and stuff.
Forget it.

1527
01:27:35.901 --> 01:27:39.140
So real work.
I want to see how you'd explain it,
what you do with it,

1528
01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:40.340
why you do what you do with it,

1529
01:27:40.341 --> 01:27:43.120
and then I'm going to push back on it and see how you respond on it or responded

1530
01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:47.240
with it.
And that says a lot.
Um,
one of the designers we hired recently,
um,

1531
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:51.370
for Ios,
Tara,
uh,
man is her name.
And,

1532
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:54.620
and one of the things I was really impressed with when she delivered her project

1533
01:27:54.621 --> 01:27:58.070
and we start talking about it,
was that when we were going through it,
she goes,

1534
01:27:58.071 --> 01:28:00.200
you know,
I don't even know if I like what I did here.

1535
01:28:00.770 --> 01:28:04.070
And I loved that because that shows,
first of all,

1536
01:28:04.071 --> 01:28:07.400
a real sense of confidence in like talking to an employer.

1537
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:09.140
And I don't even know if I liked what I did here.

1538
01:28:09.170 --> 01:28:11.900
Like that's most people are like,
this is the best thing in the world.

1539
01:28:11.901 --> 01:28:15.220
This isn't the best idea ever.
Like this is.
But then she's like,
you know,
I,

1540
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:16.940
I think I like it but I'm not totally sure.

1541
01:28:16.941 --> 01:28:19.190
And I liked that and we dug into that and then we got into like,

1542
01:28:19.191 --> 01:28:23.540
why she didn't think it was great.
And that was just a very real conversation.

1543
01:28:23.541 --> 01:28:27.710
And I felt like I could work with someone like this.
Absolutely.
Because they're,

1544
01:28:27.770 --> 01:28:30.320
they don't think that everything they do,
it's going to be great.
And there,

1545
01:28:30.321 --> 01:28:33.200
there are self aware enough to recognize that and we can talk it through and

1546
01:28:33.201 --> 01:28:37.100
figure it out.
And that was,
that was a great thing.
So,
um,
there could have been,

1547
01:28:37.101 --> 01:28:38.690
for example,
in this case there weren't,

1548
01:28:38.691 --> 01:28:42.440
but there could have been five designers who are better than her visually
anyway.

1549
01:28:42.441 --> 01:28:47.210
I still would've gone with her because of her sort of her approach to the work

1550
01:28:47.211 --> 01:28:49.250
and her honesty about it.
That's what I'm looking for.

1551
01:28:49.251 --> 01:28:50.990
When I talked to somebody who I'm about to hire,

1552
01:28:52.730 --> 01:28:55.820
what would be an example of pushing back?

1553
01:28:55.870 --> 01:29:00.870
But let's just create a hypothetical or a real example and then what would a

1554
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:02.401
trip,

1555
01:29:02.401 --> 01:29:07.401
the wire as far as red flags go or a positive indicators?

1556
01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:12.510
Sure.
So,
um,
I can't really,

1557
01:29:12.511 --> 01:29:15.810
it's hard to describe that particular project because we'd all have to be

1558
01:29:15.811 --> 01:29:18.880
looking at it to,
to point out that it could be anything.
I'm just wondering,

1559
01:29:19.410 --> 01:29:23.130
in other words,
this push back like,
wow,
I think this really sucks.
What say,

1560
01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:29.010
hmm.
Not sure how we feel about that,
or is it something else?
Yeah,
it's more,

1561
01:29:29.011 --> 01:29:32.490
it's more than obviously the latter.
I,
I remember say anything sucks.
Um,

1562
01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.350
I was using that just because of the rejection again.
Again.
Yeah,

1563
01:29:36.351 --> 01:29:40.470
you're totally right.
The,
the five five think,
dude,
it's more,
um,

1564
01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:44.690
you know,
I'm not sure that I see why,
you know,

1565
01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:49.560
you went down this road or um,
it doesn't,
this seem like a lot of steps or uh,

1566
01:29:49.570 --> 01:29:53.770
you know,
um,
this why,
you know,
this word save.

1567
01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:57.280
Maybe it should be preview.
Like why is it saved?
Like I kinda throw,

1568
01:29:57.370 --> 01:30:00.760
usually push backs with questions like I don't understand this or help me

1569
01:30:00.761 --> 01:30:03.790
understand this.
And that's kind of the,
the real one I like to use.

1570
01:30:03.791 --> 01:30:05.680
It was just like,
help.
I don't,
I'm not sure I get this.

1571
01:30:05.681 --> 01:30:07.470
Can you help me understand this?
Um,

1572
01:30:09.250 --> 01:30:13.840
but sometimes the red flags are very,
they're very clear.

1573
01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:18.070
It's the people hunched down into a defensive posture and,

1574
01:30:18.090 --> 01:30:22.630
and fight for their idea,
which is fine.
It's good to do that sometimes,

1575
01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:25.870
but not when it's like,
help me understand why,
you know,

1576
01:30:25.871 --> 01:30:28.010
why you went this direction.
It's like,
Oh,
you know,

1577
01:30:28.090 --> 01:30:30.610
I want the structure because I felt like it was the best possible thing.

1578
01:30:30.611 --> 01:30:33.340
Like there's some sort of what people get rushed about things.

1579
01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:37.210
I actually like when someone takes a pause and goes,
hmm,
let me think about that.

1580
01:30:37.211 --> 01:30:39.130
Well,
here's what I went through to get to here.

1581
01:30:39.130 --> 01:30:42.670
Like the reason I use the word say it was because,
uh,
you know,
this,

1582
01:30:42.671 --> 01:30:45.790
this reason or that reason or the reason I called it a draft and not a preview

1583
01:30:45.791 --> 01:30:49.690
is because of this and that I'm more interested in people retracing their steps

1584
01:30:49.930 --> 01:30:54.930
then then just sort of purely explaining there the outcome.

1585
01:30:56.500 --> 01:31:00.340
Um,
that's not really,
that's kind of a deeper thing,

1586
01:31:00.341 --> 01:31:01.850
but you'll see people in,

1587
01:31:01.851 --> 01:31:06.160
in designer views who get very defensive very quickly and they,
they,
they,

1588
01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:09.130
you can tell that they're not listening anymore.
They're just,
um,

1589
01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:14.380
they're telling you what they want you to listen to instead of listening to what

1590
01:31:14.381 --> 01:31:17.310
you have to say.
That's very obvious.
And designer views when that comes up,
it's,

1591
01:31:17.311 --> 01:31:21.700
it's very clear.
So it's,
it's that I just fundamentally,

1592
01:31:21.730 --> 01:31:23.440
I'm looking for,
uh,
uh,

1593
01:31:23.490 --> 01:31:28.270
a deep degree of introspection and in the work and an understanding of how they

1594
01:31:28.271 --> 01:31:32.920
ended up there.
It's kind of like if you think about,
uh,
back in school where you,

1595
01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:36.850
your teacher would ask you to show the work when he did a math problem,
um,

1596
01:31:37.090 --> 01:31:39.850
with they're basically looking for is they're looking to see if you understand

1597
01:31:39.851 --> 01:31:41.590
how you came out with the answer versus like,

1598
01:31:41.591 --> 01:31:43.830
did you somehow memorize this or guests,
it's like,

1599
01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:47.820
or was it lucky or did you actually understand how you arrive there?

1600
01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:50.200
It's kind of the same thing.
I want people to show their work basically.

1601
01:31:50.201 --> 01:31:55.201
And that doesn't mean showing like all the drafts of the design work necessary.

1602
01:31:55.931 --> 01:32:00.240
It's not like going through previous versions.
It's again,
coming down to the,

1603
01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:04.240
the path that they took to land where they landed.
That's what I'm looking for.

1604
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:09.220
<v 3>Yeah,
that makes perfect sense.
And this is also,
um,</v>

1605
01:32:10.930 --> 01:32:13.480
with the understanding that a

1606
01:32:15.190 --> 01:32:17.850
very different company from base camp,
but,
uh,

1607
01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:21.580
I've spent a lot of time with Matt Mullenweg of automatic,

1608
01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:24.340
which runs wordpress.com among other things.

1609
01:32:24.370 --> 01:32:29.370
And he values written communication exceptionally highly,

1610
01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:30.121
uh,
and,

1611
01:32:30.121 --> 01:32:35.100
and they do all their interviews via text and,
uh,

1612
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:36.430
also have every,

1613
01:32:36.431 --> 01:32:41.290
at least for a long period up until maybe I wanna say at least 50 or a hundred

1614
01:32:41.291 --> 01:32:46.291
employees had every prospective employee knew they would have to spend.

1615
01:32:47.891 --> 01:32:51.790
And I don't know if this is part of the vetting process or post hiring a week or

1616
01:32:51.791 --> 01:32:56.440
two handling customer service.
Yup.
Uh,
and which also,

1617
01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:59.280
and not to say it's perfect for every company,
certainly,
uh,

1618
01:32:59.350 --> 01:33:04.350
but also tells you a lot more than just how they handle a user error.

1619
01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:11.770
Yeah.
Customer service situation.
Right.
If they refuse to do that,

1620
01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:15.760
what does that tell you?
Right.
If they do as great,
what does it tell you?

1621
01:33:15.761 --> 01:33:20.050
There's a lot more than just the words that come out of them.

1622
01:33:20.650 --> 01:33:21.483
Yeah.
And you know,

1623
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.410
<v 4>at our company,
everybody works customer service also.
So,
um,</v>

1624
01:33:27.530 --> 01:33:28.760
no matter what position you're in,

1625
01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:31.850
every single person rotates one day through customer service,

1626
01:33:31.851 --> 01:33:35.000
every number of days.
Like we have 54 employees in the company,

1627
01:33:35.001 --> 01:33:38.900
about 15 or 16 on customer support.
So about 30 of us every 30 days.

1628
01:33:38.901 --> 01:33:41.690
We rotate through and do one day of customer service.

1629
01:33:41.691 --> 01:33:45.380
And that's the only reason why it's important for you to be able to write is

1630
01:33:45.381 --> 01:33:50.170
because,
um,
on that one day,
a month or one day every 40 days or whatever,
uh,

1631
01:33:50.290 --> 01:33:53.910
you are,
uh,
on the front lines,
speaking with customers and,

1632
01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:57.210
and empathizing with them,
understanding what,
what,
what,

1633
01:33:57.270 --> 01:34:00.800
what they're dealing with.
Helping them understand what they don't understand,

1634
01:34:00.801 --> 01:34:03.860
helping us understand what we don't understand all of that stuff,

1635
01:34:03.890 --> 01:34:06.230
which is what customer service is it really all about.
Of course,

1636
01:34:06.231 --> 01:34:09.050
it's also about like troubleshooting and solving immediate problems.

1637
01:34:09.050 --> 01:34:13.460
But a lot of it too is,
is it's getting to the real like what,

1638
01:34:13.461 --> 01:34:18.380
what are they really asking for and why?
Uh,
and what are we doing wrong and what,

1639
01:34:18.381 --> 01:34:20.390
where our blind spots to all that stuff.

1640
01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:23.360
And a lot of that comes down to having a conversation with the customer and all

1641
01:34:23.361 --> 01:34:27.680
of our customer service has done the email or or or or Twitter or or chat or

1642
01:34:27.681 --> 01:34:30.800
something.
So we don't have a phone,
although we do do some phone support,

1643
01:34:30.801 --> 01:34:33.470
but we don't have a phone number that you can call in,
for example.

1644
01:34:33.471 --> 01:34:34.310
So it's all written.

1645
01:34:34.490 --> 01:34:36.590
So we want to make sure that if we're going to put someone in front of
customers,

1646
01:34:36.591 --> 01:34:39.200
they know how to write as well.
So that that is a big part of it too.

1647
01:34:39.201 --> 01:34:42.770
I didn't know that automatic did that as part as their part of their hiring

1648
01:34:42.771 --> 01:34:44.330
process,
but I love the idea.

1649
01:34:45.270 --> 01:34:48.900
<v 3>Yeah,
it's a such a key,</v>

1650
01:34:48.930 --> 01:34:53.930
such a key skill for so many reasons for people to want to become better writers

1651
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:58.190
that are communicators.
Are there any books or resources,

1652
01:34:58.190 --> 01:34:59.870
<v 4>exercises that you would recommend?</v>

1653
01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:06.250
There is one of my favorite books is called revising prose and the cover is

1654
01:35:06.951 --> 01:35:11.390
horrible.
It's like,
ah,
that's how you can spot it,
right?
Yes.

1655
01:35:11.710 --> 01:35:15.140
It's like a CD rom and a pencil or something.
It's like,
what's,

1656
01:35:15.141 --> 01:35:18.620
I don't even understand how that happened.
Maybe they've revised it since,

1657
01:35:18.621 --> 01:35:20.510
but I think it's that bad still.

1658
01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:25.760
It's so horrible.
Anyway,
revising prose.
Thank God.

1659
01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:29.720
Thank God the title is so catchy.
Yeah,
exactly right.
Yeah.
Right.

1660
01:35:30.170 --> 01:35:33.200
But what's cool about it is that,
um,
and I forget the author and you,
you know,

1661
01:35:33.201 --> 01:35:35.210
you can look it up and put it the notes,
but um,

1662
01:35:35.690 --> 01:35:40.220
is that he dissects things one sentence at a time and his,

1663
01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:41.370
his ability to,

1664
01:35:41.730 --> 01:35:46.160
to take a sentence and cut it up and explain it and simplify it.

1665
01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:51.410
I think it's a wonderful skill and a great,
great book.
Uh,

1666
01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:56.010
so it's not really even about writing paragraphs or stories or how to organize

1667
01:35:56.011 --> 01:35:57.080
their an outline stuff.

1668
01:35:57.081 --> 01:36:01.100
It's like a sensor at a time and figuring how to structure things.
Love it.

1669
01:36:01.130 --> 01:36:02.900
Great Book.
And it's actually,
you know,

1670
01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:05.690
there's this class I've talked about before,

1671
01:36:05.691 --> 01:36:08.450
I've written a blog post about this class that I'd want to teach if I ever

1672
01:36:08.451 --> 01:36:13.100
taught a college class.
I think,
I think one of the biggest disservices that that,

1673
01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:17.960
that college does actually is that it doesn't teach people to write well.
Um,

1674
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:19.160
in fact the teaches a lot of people,

1675
01:36:19.161 --> 01:36:23.570
especially in MBA programs to write very poorly.
So true.
It's so true.

1676
01:36:23.571 --> 01:36:26.840
And a lot of it's based on length,
like write a 10 page thing and or you know,

1677
01:36:27.110 --> 01:36:27.943
or whatever.

1678
01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:31.730
So the class I have always wanted to teach if I was ever to teach would be a

1679
01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:34.670
writing class.
I don't care what the subject is.
It doesn't matter.

1680
01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:39.230
Pick a subject and want you to write like a five page version of that article.

1681
01:36:39.231 --> 01:36:41.420
I want you to write a one page version of it.

1682
01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:43.190
I want you to write a five paragraph version,

1683
01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:47.810
a five sentence version in a one sentence version.
Um,
that's the assignment.

1684
01:36:48.050 --> 01:36:51.710
And we would do that over and over and over and over with different topics.

1685
01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:53.450
I don't care the topic,
it doesn't matter.

1686
01:36:53.451 --> 01:36:57.120
I just want you to be at a right at different levels of resolution and continue

1687
01:36:57.121 --> 01:37:00.350
to clarify it as you cut things out to the point where you can run it in one

1688
01:37:00.351 --> 01:37:03.500
sentence.
And of course there'll be more detail in the,
in the,

1689
01:37:03.501 --> 01:37:05.960
in the five paragraph version nine maybe it was three pages,

1690
01:37:05.961 --> 01:37:08.570
one page through paragraphs,
one sentence,
whatever it is.
But this,

1691
01:37:08.571 --> 01:37:12.200
this idea of going from writing the long piece and then cutting it down and

1692
01:37:12.230 --> 01:37:15.830
editing.
Editing is something that's rarely taught and really getting,

1693
01:37:15.831 --> 01:37:18.800
trying to hone in on what it is and realize like the,

1694
01:37:18.850 --> 01:37:21.920
the big idea here is that you can realize that so much of the stuff that you put

1695
01:37:21.921 --> 01:37:24.620
in a five page version,
it doesn't really matter that much.

1696
01:37:24.890 --> 01:37:27.890
And actually the one page version is probably better.
And maybe the,

1697
01:37:27.891 --> 01:37:30.820
the three paragraph version is much better than the one page version and you,

1698
01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:33.890
there's probably a point where you,
you,
you kinda lose it,

1699
01:37:33.891 --> 01:37:35.820
but it's still a great exercise.
So I,

1700
01:37:35.821 --> 01:37:40.760
I'd love to see that kind of writing instruction versus length,

1701
01:37:40.761 --> 01:37:45.470
which scent,
like long,
long things.
And then not actually editing.

1702
01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:50.690
This is the other thing that blows me away about education.

1703
01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:51.771
Um,
it's funny,

1704
01:37:51.771 --> 01:37:56.771
I was talking to my son's preschool and I was talking to the head of the school

1705
01:37:56.851 --> 01:37:58.890
about,
about this.
Um,

1706
01:37:59.190 --> 01:38:04.020
and the thing that's not taught in schools is iteration and iteration is

1707
01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:08.760
everything outside of school.
Um,
where you,
you do something and then like you,

1708
01:38:08.761 --> 01:38:09.594
you,
you,
you know,

1709
01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:12.690
launch it or ship it whenever and then you're on to making a better version of

1710
01:38:12.691 --> 01:38:13.770
that thing pretty quickly.

1711
01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:17.430
In school we would always do something and sort of handed in and that assignment

1712
01:38:17.431 --> 01:38:20.010
would be done and then you go on and do another assignment.

1713
01:38:20.011 --> 01:38:23.520
You never get to revisit things.
Uh,
in the,

1714
01:38:23.521 --> 01:38:27.350
in the professional world you're revisiting things all the time.
And um,

1715
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:31.600
I would love to see,
you know,
you hand something like this,
like this one page to,

1716
01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:35.250
to,
to,
to,
you know,
or five page to one page to five paragraphs,
whatever.

1717
01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:38.300
That's a version of a short term version of like revisioning in a sense that

1718
01:38:38.301 --> 01:38:40.760
perhaps the better way of doing that would be you firsthand.

1719
01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:43.470
And the five page version,
you get it back with notes,

1720
01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:47.340
then you're required to write the one page version of that.
Um,
but anyway,

1721
01:38:47.341 --> 01:38:47.791
the point is,

1722
01:38:47.791 --> 01:38:52.260
is that field to revisit something that you did and make it better and handed in

1723
01:38:52.261 --> 01:38:55.500
and revise it again at hand and revise it again.
Um,

1724
01:38:55.650 --> 01:38:58.830
is something that you don't see often.
Sometimes you see that with drafts in a,

1725
01:38:58.831 --> 01:38:59.611
in a document,

1726
01:38:59.611 --> 01:39:04.140
but it's not really quite the same as being able to come back to the idea.

1727
01:39:04.141 --> 01:39:04.831
So for example,

1728
01:39:04.831 --> 01:39:07.650
if you're doing something in school and you're building something or you're

1729
01:39:07.651 --> 01:39:10.710
doing a science project or whatever and you,
you do it and you're done,

1730
01:39:10.711 --> 01:39:12.030
you present it and it's over.

1731
01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:14.640
Like maybe a month later you're going to have a better idea for something that

1732
01:39:14.641 --> 01:39:16.440
you did and you go,
I want to do that again,

1733
01:39:16.441 --> 01:39:19.060
but schools and give you a chance to do anything again.
Really,

1734
01:39:19.061 --> 01:39:19.980
unless you like Ms,

1735
01:39:19.981 --> 01:39:23.280
you're stupid and you're held back and they say you can't go for further.

1736
01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:27.480
You know,
of course not stupid,
that's the wrong word.
But like the is like you're,

1737
01:39:27.481 --> 01:39:30.000
you know,
you didn't,
you didn't hit the criteria,

1738
01:39:30.001 --> 01:39:33.210
so we're going to let you do it again.
Like in some ways of course,

1739
01:39:33.211 --> 01:39:36.000
there's a lot of other reasons why this probably isn't necessarily a good thing

1740
01:39:36.001 --> 01:39:40.380
for people,
for,
for kids.
Um,
but uh,
to get a chance to do it all over again,

1741
01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:44.070
maybe you see it better the second time.
Um,
so anyway,

1742
01:39:44.071 --> 01:39:48.060
I would love to see revision and iteration built into education and this is sort

1743
01:39:48.061 --> 01:39:50.050
of writing assignment as sort of a way to get it done.

1744
01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:54.180
<v 3>And I pulled up this book and the cover is truly awful.</v>

1745
01:39:55.370 --> 01:39:59.910
Like what is the CD even doing there?
Uh,
on top?
How'd that happen?

1746
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.030
Is it like clip art or something?
Like,

1747
01:40:02.031 --> 01:40:04.320
I don't even know how that happened that when they get to the bottom of that,

1748
01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:09.150
but revising prose Richard a Lanham.
Does that sound right?

1749
01:40:09.390 --> 01:40:10.680
I think so.
Yeah.
That's gotta be,

1750
01:40:10.681 --> 01:40:15.510
because the cover is this pen CD on top of a page with a bunch of markups on it.

1751
01:40:15.930 --> 01:40:18.930
Richard Aid,
Atlanta.
I'm another book that I found very helpful.

1752
01:40:18.931 --> 01:40:22.200
I haven't read it in a very long time,
but it's called simple and direct.

1753
01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:26.670
It should be fairly easy to write.
I don't remember the name of the author.
And,

1754
01:40:26.671 --> 01:40:29.220
uh,
I had the,
I had the great,

1755
01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:33.810
good fortune maybe to make too many modifiers on that,

1756
01:40:33.811 --> 01:40:38.811
but now that I'm thinking about writing the great good fortune of taking a class

1757
01:40:40.230 --> 01:40:43.500
in college,
I was at Princeton Undergrad with John McPhee,

1758
01:40:43.501 --> 01:40:45.000
who's a senior writer at the New Yorker.

1759
01:40:45.450 --> 01:40:47.430
It's one appeal to your or to at this point.

1760
01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:50.910
And the course was called the literature of fact.

1761
01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:54.250
It was about nonfiction writing,
creative nonfiction,
uh,

1762
01:40:54.251 --> 01:40:56.380
which doesn't mean making up 50%.

1763
01:40:56.410 --> 01:41:00.700
It means taking fact and leaving it into a narrative which John McPhee is

1764
01:41:00.701 --> 01:41:03.340
exceptionally good at.
And actually one book,

1765
01:41:03.460 --> 01:41:05.830
I think you would really enjoy this called draft number four,

1766
01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:07.330
which is about his writing process.

1767
01:41:07.331 --> 01:41:10.780
I think you'd be fascinated by it from a structural standpoint,

1768
01:41:11.410 --> 01:41:14.740
really fascinating.
And it gets into the weeds,
which is not for everybody,

1769
01:41:14.741 --> 01:41:18.810
but I think,
I think you'd appreciate it.
And,
uh,

1770
01:41:18.970 --> 01:41:21.580
I remember the first time it was,
uh,

1771
01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:25.150
the first time we had our writing assignments returned to us.

1772
01:41:25.170 --> 01:41:29.230
So every week we had a seminar,
a,

1773
01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:34.260
which was a 12 students or so we had to apply to get in a writing assignment and

1774
01:41:36.011 --> 01:41:40.990
then a one on one session with big fee to go over the writing assignment that he

1775
01:41:40.991 --> 01:41:42.610
had already marked up and given to us.

1776
01:41:42.670 --> 01:41:45.220
And I remember when he handed back the first writing assignment,

1777
01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:50.560
a man to all these students before he handed them out,
he said,
look,

1778
01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:54.790
he didn't say look,
cause that's not what he would say.
But he said,
he said,

1779
01:41:54.850 --> 01:41:58.960
I want you to know that you're all good writers.
You can,
all right,

1780
01:41:59.050 --> 01:42:01.970
so I don't want you to be intimidated by what I'm about to hand back and see.

1781
01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:05.730
It was a bad student by student.
The,

1782
01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:07.090
their faces drop.

1783
01:42:07.091 --> 01:42:12.091
And I got mine back and there was more red ink on the page then black ink.

1784
01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:13.540
But I typed out,

1785
01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:18.540
it really looked like there was more Reddick and it became so clear how

1786
01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:25.480
fuzzy.
So much of my thinking was how many unnecessary words there were,

1787
01:42:25.481 --> 01:42:29.250
how much gristle and fat there was in between the actual meat that was necessary

1788
01:42:29.251 --> 01:42:31.870
on the page.
And the reason I bring up this,
this,

1789
01:42:31.871 --> 01:42:36.220
this story is that over the course of the next few weeks,

1790
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:37.360
as we were learning more,

1791
01:42:37.361 --> 01:42:42.361
practicing more and honing the sharpness of our writing,

1792
01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:45.370
getting progressively less red ink,

1793
01:42:45.610 --> 01:42:50.110
ideally my grades in all of my other classes went up.

1794
01:42:51.070 --> 01:42:52.930
And there was a very clear,

1795
01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:57.960
super clear correlation between cleaning up my thinking and everything else

1796
01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:02.590
running more smoothly.
It was really,
it could not have been more obvious and uh,

1797
01:43:03.130 --> 01:43:05.440
such a,
such an incredibly valuable skill.

1798
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:06.371
<v 4>It is.
You know,</v>

1799
01:43:06.371 --> 01:43:11.371
something that I would also encourage people to do is to read Tom Petty lyrics.

1800
01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:15.850
Um,
it sounds,
but if you read Tom,

1801
01:43:15.851 --> 01:43:20.851
Tom Petty has such a wonderful efficiency in this storytelling and his lyrics

1802
01:43:21.250 --> 01:43:25.540
and um,
every word really counts and there's no filler.

1803
01:43:25.570 --> 01:43:26.560
It's any paints,

1804
01:43:26.561 --> 01:43:30.580
these really broad pictures with four or five words per,

1805
01:43:30.581 --> 01:43:34.750
per phrase and really,
truly is.
I thought one of the best,

1806
01:43:34.810 --> 01:43:37.240
I mean one of the best songwriters of course,
but really a great,

1807
01:43:37.241 --> 01:43:40.750
just a great writer in general when you read the lyrics.
So I would look at,

1808
01:43:40.751 --> 01:43:43.660
look at that and go look at the pictures he can paint and the emotions you can

1809
01:43:43.661 --> 01:43:47.980
evoke and the um,
the story he can tell with very few words.

1810
01:43:47.981 --> 01:43:51.810
He's extremely economical with his,
with his,
with his language or was,
and um,

1811
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:55.010
it's a great thing to read.
So just go like,
like a stone of his albums.
Go look,

1812
01:43:55.011 --> 01:43:57.850
go look up the lyrics online and don't even listen to the songs,

1813
01:43:57.860 --> 01:44:01.900
but just read them and you go,
I see where he's going with this.
And it,
it's,
it's,

1814
01:44:02.050 --> 01:44:04.490
I always enjoy doing that from time to time.
He's just such a,

1815
01:44:04.491 --> 01:44:05.420
he was so good at that.

1816
01:44:07.410 --> 01:44:09.210
<v 3>I will have to check that out.
Elmore Leonard,</v>

1817
01:44:09.211 --> 01:44:13.020
also another fantastic one for people to look up and it makes me think you were

1818
01:44:13.021 --> 01:44:17.970
talking about the,
uh,
the one page three,
four,
five paragraph three,
paragraph,
one,

1819
01:44:17.971 --> 01:44:22.380
paragraph,
one line.
It makes me think of the,
the Hemingway story in one line,

1820
01:44:22.381 --> 01:44:25.680
which I'm sure I'm going to get slightly wrong,
but it was something,
right?
The,

1821
01:44:25.681 --> 01:44:30.660
uh,
uh,
used baby shoes never worn or I fucked it up.

1822
01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:34.350
The baby,
the baby shoes for sale,
baby shoes for sale,

1823
01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:39.600
never worn a,
the sort of five or six word story.
Uh,
it's,

1824
01:44:39.601 --> 01:44:43.180
it's a really valuable exercise.
Uh,
and,
and it's,

1825
01:44:43.181 --> 01:44:47.250
it's not just for academic purposes as you pointed out,
translates to everything.

1826
01:44:47.730 --> 01:44:48.370
No doubt.

1827
01:44:48.370 --> 01:44:49.203
<v 5>Uh,</v>

1828
01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:54.420
<v 3>vintage watches.
God,
go,
tell me about,</v>

1829
01:44:54.450 --> 01:44:56.700
tell me about the vintage watches

1830
01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:01.640
<v 4>I'm into.
I'm into that.
Um,
I'm into vintage watches.</v>

1831
01:45:01.930 --> 01:45:05.180
Let's see why.
Well,
first of all,
I'm into watches.
Um,

1832
01:45:05.181 --> 01:45:09.980
I'm into a lot of things that seem like there can only be one way to do it,

1833
01:45:09.981 --> 01:45:12.290
but there turns out there's a lot of ways.
So for example,

1834
01:45:12.291 --> 01:45:16.760
I love a chair does like designing chairs.

1835
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:20.280
I don't design it myself and I love looking at chairs,
which are,
are,

1836
01:45:20.281 --> 01:45:22.040
are very simple things.
It's like,
you know,

1837
01:45:22.041 --> 01:45:24.620
you sit on them and that's what they do.
And you're like,
well,

1838
01:45:24.621 --> 01:45:26.090
there going to be a few ways to do a chair,

1839
01:45:26.091 --> 01:45:28.490
but turns out there's so many different ways to do a chair and it's really

1840
01:45:28.491 --> 01:45:30.580
interesting.
And watches are the same thing.

1841
01:45:30.690 --> 01:45:33.150
<v 3>Vintage.
Do you have any favorite chairs?
Just as a side note?</v>

1842
01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:37.260
<v 4>Uh,
I,
I like a lot of,
uh,
stuff that she,
uh,
um,</v>

1843
01:45:37.330 --> 01:45:41.590
his name is French so I'll probably get it wrong.
But gene,
Jean Pro Bay are,

1844
01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:46.160
uh,
from getting that right.
Um,
I love his designs,
his styles.
Um,

1845
01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:47.171
there's a bunch of others.

1846
01:45:47.171 --> 01:45:50.180
I'll maybe I'll send you an email afterwards to some of my favorite chair.

1847
01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:53.150
<v 3>I'll send you some like,
sure.
Um,</v>

1848
01:45:53.610 --> 01:45:55.890
<v 4>but um,
I,
uh,</v>

1849
01:45:55.891 --> 01:45:58.980
so watches are similar and that like a watch basically like,
look,

1850
01:45:58.981 --> 01:46:01.350
it's there to tell the time.
Some watches can do more than others,

1851
01:46:01.351 --> 01:46:03.570
but basically if they're wanting to tell the time and like,
okay,
there's,

1852
01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:06.300
you've got,
especially if you like an analog watches,

1853
01:46:06.301 --> 01:46:08.670
which is why one of the reasons I like vintage stuff cause it's like,
you know,

1854
01:46:08.850 --> 01:46:12.600
I ha a couple of hands,
three hands maybe or two hands and,

1855
01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:15.420
but there's so many different designs and so many different styles and so many

1856
01:46:15.421 --> 01:46:18.480
different elements and so many different approaches to it that there's an

1857
01:46:18.510 --> 01:46:21.730
endless amount of,
of curiosity in it for me.
Um,

1858
01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:26.250
and plus the cool thing about mechanical watches,
uh,
is that,
um,

1859
01:46:26.700 --> 01:46:30.390
they're such a,
it's a combination of all the things I like.
So it's design,

1860
01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:33.240
it's engineering,
it's materials,
it's,

1861
01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:37.920
it's like a Patina and like seeing age on things.
I love things that age well.

1862
01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:42.420
Um,
it's,
it's art,
it's science.
Like if you,

1863
01:46:42.421 --> 01:46:44.610
if you crack open one of these watches and look at the movement,

1864
01:46:44.611 --> 01:46:48.120
like there's serious engineering going on in there and some science,

1865
01:46:48.121 --> 01:46:51.600
material science and really fascinating stuff.
And like the idea that,

1866
01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:56.160
that mankind can capture time and tell it this way,
using springs.
And gears,

1867
01:46:56.161 --> 01:46:59.880
it's kind of an amazing thing and be that accurate.
So I've always sort of,

1868
01:47:00.090 --> 01:47:04.080
I haven't always been into them,
but my dad was into them still maybe still is.

1869
01:47:04.370 --> 01:47:05.460
I don't know if he collects stuff anymore,

1870
01:47:05.461 --> 01:47:09.300
but it used to when I was younger and I got into them.
Um,
and the vintage thing,

1871
01:47:09.301 --> 01:47:12.300
I'm actually kind of into vintage and modern these days,

1872
01:47:12.301 --> 01:47:15.960
but more so I find vintage and just more interesting because there's more

1873
01:47:15.961 --> 01:47:19.380
character in,
in,
in the objects because they have time on them.

1874
01:47:19.580 --> 01:47:20.520
It's actually have you know,

1875
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:22.680
age on them and that's kind of cool to see how things age.

1876
01:47:22.681 --> 01:47:24.440
And that's one of the reasons why,
um,

1877
01:47:24.540 --> 01:47:27.250
like I like a lot of natural materials in general now we're like,

1878
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:32.010
I'm branching into architecture discussion here,
but I like brick.
Uh,
I like wood.

1879
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:36.600
I like things that,
that pickup age over time versus like,
um,

1880
01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:40.080
a lot of modern materials,
I feel like,
uh,
they don't age very well.

1881
01:47:40.081 --> 01:47:42.840
They look great when you do the photo shoot right afterwards built and then they

1882
01:47:42.841 --> 01:47:46.830
just age poorly and they show their age in a way that's not flattering,

1883
01:47:46.831 --> 01:47:50.010
but in fact it takes it to tracks from,
from the quality of the object.

1884
01:47:50.011 --> 01:47:51.330
So it's cool to see.

1885
01:47:51.331 --> 01:47:54.120
The other thing is I'll say about vintage watches is that it's really cool to

1886
01:47:54.121 --> 01:47:55.800
get to look down on your wrist and go,

1887
01:47:56.160 --> 01:48:01.160
this thing I have in my wrist has been working for 50 years and if someone looks

1888
01:48:01.861 --> 01:48:06.240
after it five more times over the next 50 years,
the next hundred years,

1889
01:48:06.241 --> 01:48:07.200
it'll still work.

1890
01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:12.060
There's basically nothing that is being created today or that is true anymore

1891
01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:15.660
except really watches mechanical watches.

1892
01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:20.280
Most other things these days are disposable and so it's kind of a great reminder

1893
01:48:20.281 --> 01:48:22.800
that you can actually build things that last and you can look down your risks

1894
01:48:22.801 --> 01:48:22.981
and go.

1895
01:48:22.981 --> 01:48:25.620
Someone else 50 years ago was looking down at the wrist seeing the exact same

1896
01:48:25.621 --> 01:48:28.050
thing and it worked just as well.
In 50 years from now,

1897
01:48:28.051 --> 01:48:31.980
my kid can look down on his wrist or her wrist and see the same thing I looked

1898
01:48:31.981 --> 01:48:35.310
at to tell the same amount of time and it's going to work as well.

1899
01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:38.280
And I just kind of love that idea.
So anyway,
that's sort of why I'm into it.

1900
01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:40.651
<v 3>So a few things.</v>

1901
01:48:40.651 --> 01:48:45.651
The first is at some point I need to introduce you to a Peter Attia MD.

1902
01:48:46.531 --> 01:48:51.400
He was a close friend of mine and a,
an extreme watch nerd.
Okay,
good.

1903
01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:54.810
I think you guys would have a lot to talk about if you could only pick and I'd

1904
01:48:54.811 --> 01:48:58.530
have no idea how many watches you have.
You don't have to divulge that.

1905
01:48:58.531 --> 01:49:01.790
But if you could only choose one to three watches to keep.

1906
01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:03.713
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1907
01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:06.950
<v 3>Do any come to mind where you're like,
Yep,
these are definitely on the list?</v>

1908
01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:12.220
<v 4>Yes.
So,
uh,
I have a,
uh,
it's called a Rolex Milgauss six,</v>

1909
01:49:12.221 --> 01:49:14.890
five,
four one is the model number,

1910
01:49:14.891 --> 01:49:18.850
what they would call the reference number in the watch world.
It's from 1958.

1911
01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:19.460
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1912
01:49:19.460 --> 01:49:22.370
<v 4>And I just think it's the coolest fucking thing ever.</v>

1913
01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:26.390
So I just love the way it looks.
So cool looking.
It's,
it's,
it's awesome.

1914
01:49:26.391 --> 01:49:30.770
So anyway,
Rolex Milgauss six,
five,
four,
one from 1958.
Um,

1915
01:49:31.330 --> 01:49:33.350
that's,
that's definitely one keeper.
Um,

1916
01:49:33.351 --> 01:49:37.410
I have like an old protec Felipe,
uh,

1917
01:49:38.110 --> 01:49:42.290
blanking on the reference right now.
Um,
it's,
it was,

1918
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:46.730
it was built for,
um,
similar to this Milgauss I was telling you about.
Oh,

1919
01:49:46.731 --> 01:49:49.750
in Milgauss means 1000 gallons.
So it was a,
it was a,

1920
01:49:49.751 --> 01:49:54.490
it was a watch built for scientists who worked in high magnetic environments and

1921
01:49:55.060 --> 01:49:59.280
watches,
watches,
typically benches one,
especially now,

1922
01:49:59.300 --> 01:50:01.420
modern ones were a little bit different,
but,
um,

1923
01:50:01.630 --> 01:50:05.260
they don't work well in magnetic environments because the spring that's inside

1924
01:50:05.261 --> 01:50:08.870
them,
once it's magnetized,
it can't tell time properly anymore,
basically.
So,

1925
01:50:08.880 --> 01:50:13.750
so these watches were built for scientists to be a magnetic or anti magnetic.

1926
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:17.960
And so the Milgauss was one of them.
And then,
and then protec made one car.

1927
01:50:17.980 --> 01:50:20.290
I can't believe,
I can't remember the reference right now.
Anyway,

1928
01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:22.920
<v 3>you can say that.
You can send it with your links to the chairs.</v>

1929
01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:24.450
I'll send it exactly.

1930
01:50:25.410 --> 01:50:30.060
<v 4>Also an anti magnetic watch.
Um,
and it was sort of their answer to the Milgauss.</v>

1931
01:50:30.180 --> 01:50:33.990
So it's funny that like the two things come to mind immediately are like watches

1932
01:50:33.991 --> 01:50:38.820
for scientists,
which you know,
is just what a cool niche.

1933
01:50:39.190 --> 01:50:41.500
Um,
you know,
to make,

1934
01:50:41.700 --> 01:50:45.870
make a product for scientists in the fifties,
like how cool.

1935
01:50:45.871 --> 01:50:46.830
Like kind of,

1936
01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:50.130
if you can imagine scientists in the fifties what their white coats and like

1937
01:50:50.370 --> 01:50:54.150
learning all sorts of new things about physics in the world and biology,
uh,

1938
01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:57.160
and all sorts of really cool stuff happened back then.
Um,

1939
01:50:57.360 --> 01:51:00.870
that those are the two watches that immediately come to mind that I really,

1940
01:51:00.871 --> 01:51:05.520
really dig.
Um,
there,
there's another one,
um,
actually,
which is a,

1941
01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:09.020
I'm gonna get this name wrong too,
so I'm just going to call it,

1942
01:51:09.590 --> 01:51:13.590
it's [inaudible] cult or [inaudible] or something on that.
I can never,

1943
01:51:13.770 --> 01:51:17.820
I never exactly know what it is.
Um,
anyway,
uh,

1944
01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:21.720
it's called the Polaris from 1968.

1945
01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:26.310
It's a dive watch built for divers and it has an alarm on it.

1946
01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:30.660
I'm a mechanical alarm,
which is really cool and really unique and rare,

1947
01:51:30.661 --> 01:51:31.650
especially at the time,

1948
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:34.800
which I think is really beautiful and just a really neat complication for a

1949
01:51:34.830 --> 01:51:37.320
mechanical watch should have an alarm on it.
Um,

1950
01:51:37.321 --> 01:51:38.670
so you could say like for example,

1951
01:51:38.700 --> 01:51:41.400
at five o'clock I want this thing to buzz very loudly,

1952
01:51:41.401 --> 01:51:42.990
so I would know that it's five o'clock,

1953
01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:46.800
which of course it's so silly and easy to do with an iPhone or any digital
thing,

1954
01:51:46.801 --> 01:51:47.940
but mechanically it's actually,

1955
01:51:47.941 --> 01:51:51.540
it was quite a challenge and very few watches I've ever had a mechanical alarm.

1956
01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:53.220
I also like the way it looks.
So anyway,

1957
01:51:53.370 --> 01:51:55.680
there's some of that stuff that I'm in too.
There's other bunch of other things.

1958
01:51:56.130 --> 01:51:56.880
Um,

1959
01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:59.790
but those are the kind of the three that the initially come to mind as ones that

1960
01:51:59.791 --> 01:52:00.630
I'm really into.

1961
01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:06.300
<v 3>If you had to give a Ted talk on obsessions and it couldn't be related to your</v>

1962
01:52:07.451 --> 01:52:07.931
company,

1963
01:52:07.931 --> 01:52:12.700
it couldn't be related to watches this as these are personal obsessions,

1964
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:17.370
what,
what might you talk about that,
that a lot of people wouldn't know about?

1965
01:52:18.930 --> 01:52:20.580
<v 4>Well,
I don't know if I'd be able to talk about it.
Yeah.</v>

1966
01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:27.630
<v 3>Okay.
I'm imagining all of the,
the,
uh,
unacceptable,</v>

1967
01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:28.771
unacceptable,

1968
01:52:28.771 --> 01:52:32.220
socially awkward sexual fetishes that you wouldn't be able to talk about on the

1969
01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:33.270
Ted Stage,
but continue,

1970
01:52:33.810 --> 01:52:36.610
I guess I didn't finish the sentence and I said maybe I wouldn't be talk

1971
01:52:36.620 --> 01:52:39.250
<v 4>about it with authority,
let's say.
So let's say I'm,</v>

1972
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:44.690
one of the things that I'm really into strangely is,
is prairie restoration.

1973
01:52:45.290 --> 01:52:50.210
Okay.
So stand back here for a second.
Let me fill you in on this.
So I,

1974
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:55.270
maybe 10 years ago I bought a farm up in a rural Wisconsin about three hours

1975
01:52:55.761 --> 01:52:59.750
from Chicago where I live.
It's like 50 miles west of Madison,
Wisconsin.

1976
01:52:59.751 --> 01:53:04.751
For those who kind of know the geography and it's a very rural and it's kind of

1977
01:53:05.451 --> 01:53:08.990
hilly.
It's very beautiful.
I bought it.
And,
um,

1978
01:53:09.650 --> 01:53:11.660
I always wanted some land.
I love nature.

1979
01:53:11.661 --> 01:53:13.700
I love just getting out and walking in nature,

1980
01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:17.510
just to me the most refreshing thing you could ever do.
Um,

1981
01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:18.890
and uh,

1982
01:53:18.891 --> 01:53:22.850
so I bought this land and I looked at it and I thought it was just beautiful.

1983
01:53:22.851 --> 01:53:24.350
And amazing and it was,

1984
01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:28.190
but I learned a couple of years in that was full of weeds and invasive species

1985
01:53:28.191 --> 01:53:32.780
and like not really the way it should be a or shoot or was,

1986
01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:35.070
but modern farming and,
and,
and the,

1987
01:53:35.080 --> 01:53:38.000
the fact the land's been tilled a bunch of times and there's invasive species

1988
01:53:38.001 --> 01:53:41.210
and stuff.
It's sort of took over the land.
So I got on this kick to,
to,

1989
01:53:41.211 --> 01:53:43.250
to find a prairie restoration specialists,

1990
01:53:43.251 --> 01:53:45.470
which I learned that there's this thing called prairie restoration where you

1991
01:53:45.471 --> 01:53:48.440
could sort of bring the land back to the way it was to prairie in this

1992
01:53:48.441 --> 01:53:52.970
particular part of the country.
And the prairie is in fact the,
um,

1993
01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:56.570
the most endangered natural habitat in the United States.

1994
01:53:56.780 --> 01:54:00.470
There's only like something like a thousand or something acres left of it in the

1995
01:54:00.471 --> 01:54:01.670
entire United States.

1996
01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:04.430
So people talk about old growth forests being gone and stuff.

1997
01:54:04.431 --> 01:54:07.070
There's actually more old growth forest United States and there's prairie

1998
01:54:07.071 --> 01:54:09.720
prairie's gone basically.
But I,

1999
01:54:09.721 --> 01:54:12.640
I visited some actual prairies that have been restored and also some,

2000
01:54:12.641 --> 01:54:16.640
some that are still around and they're just,
you're due to agriculture I assume,

2001
01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:19.760
or farming.
Yeah,
like a peep,
you know,

2002
01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:24.590
all the land has been tilled basically for farmland.
Um,
and,
um,

2003
01:54:25.260 --> 01:54:29.240
and I visited some of these prayers and they just are the most beautiful thing,

2004
01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:33.960
uh,
hundreds of species of plants and flowers and,
and,
and,
and,
and,

2005
01:54:34.350 --> 01:54:38.840
and shrubs and insects and birds.
And it's just these,
this beautiful,
beautiful,

2006
01:54:38.841 --> 01:54:43.370
beautiful thing.
And so I have this land that's quite a bit of acreage.
And I,

2007
01:54:43.371 --> 01:54:46.350
and I started hiring,
I hired this guy to,
to help me restore it.

2008
01:54:46.351 --> 01:54:48.710
And we've been doing it for seven,
eight years now or something,

2009
01:54:48.711 --> 01:54:52.760
bringing the land back to the way it was like five acres at a time.
Um,

2010
01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:56.160
and planting native species and,
and uh,

2011
01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:59.090
and getting rid of all the invasives and also doing the same thing.

2012
01:54:59.450 --> 01:55:02.900
There's some force on the,
on the property.
And I'm doing oak savanna restoration.

2013
01:55:02.901 --> 01:55:07.790
So a lot of invasive trees have grown up around these big,
huge,

2014
01:55:07.791 --> 01:55:09.980
beautiful oak trees that are hundreds of years old,

2015
01:55:09.981 --> 01:55:12.170
but they've been crowded by these other trees are getting rid of some of the

2016
01:55:12.171 --> 01:55:14.000
other trees and letting the oak speed the way they were.

2017
01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.950
And then returning the fourth floor of the way it was.

2018
01:55:15.951 --> 01:55:20.360
And it's just such an incredibly rewarding but super slow process.

2019
01:55:20.361 --> 01:55:22.420
It takes like you see these prairies,

2020
01:55:22.421 --> 01:55:25.250
if first of all you have to like kind of get rid of everything that's there and

2021
01:55:25.251 --> 01:55:27.200
then weeds pop up.
You have to get rid of everything that's there.

2022
01:55:27.201 --> 01:55:29.420
Cause there's what's called a seed bank in the soil.

2023
01:55:29.930 --> 01:55:33.680
So the seed bank is basically hundreds of years worth of seeds that have just

2024
01:55:33.681 --> 01:55:36.350
been waiting to sprout.
And so you have to kind of like,

2025
01:55:36.351 --> 01:55:38.990
you clear out all the living stuff and then like there's all these seeds that

2026
01:55:38.991 --> 01:55:41.390
are then now we'll expose to the sunlight and then they sprout.

2027
01:55:41.391 --> 01:55:45.000
And you have to basically just kind of nuke all for a while until there's

2028
01:55:45.001 --> 01:55:48.960
nothing basic left in the soil.
Um,
or invasive species left in the soil,

2029
01:55:49.140 --> 01:55:53.160
and then he can go and get native species by actually doing seed gathering.

2030
01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:56.730
You can gather seeds,
it's certain prairie's or you can buy seeds,
native seeds.

2031
01:55:57.090 --> 01:56:01.440
You can also find individual prairie plants in what's called prayer remnants,

2032
01:56:01.441 --> 01:56:04.770
which are like small vestiges of old prairie that might still be on your

2033
01:56:04.771 --> 01:56:07.620
property and harvest the seeds from those as it's really,
really slow,

2034
01:56:07.621 --> 01:56:08.454
amazing thing.

2035
01:56:08.610 --> 01:56:11.970
Then you seed it and then it might take five or six years for a prayer to grow

2036
01:56:11.971 --> 01:56:15.660
because the prairie plants typically invested all their energy in the first few

2037
01:56:15.661 --> 01:56:18.900
years in the,
in the roots.
So you don't see anything growing.

2038
01:56:18.901 --> 01:56:19.740
It's really frustrating.

2039
01:56:19.741 --> 01:56:23.910
It looks like shit for a long time and all of a sudden it starts to come up and

2040
01:56:23.911 --> 01:56:28.790
then it's just so rewarding.
It's so wonderful to walk through.
And um,

2041
01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:33.130
so that's something that I'm really into in a deep way.
And uh,

2042
01:56:33.210 --> 01:56:35.490
probably most people don't know about it in general.

2043
01:56:35.490 --> 01:56:36.900
I didn't know about it until a few years ago,

2044
01:56:36.901 --> 01:56:41.901
but I love it so much and I'm kind of on this crusade now to like this anti corn

2045
01:56:42.241 --> 01:56:44.430
crusade.
You know,

2046
01:56:44.670 --> 01:56:48.330
I want to basically whenever land comes up next to my land,

2047
01:56:48.331 --> 01:56:53.130
I want to buy it because most of it's corn and corn is sort of at the root of a

2048
01:56:53.131 --> 01:56:56.370
lot of different problems.
Uh,
and I just want to like get rid of the corn.

2049
01:56:56.371 --> 01:57:00.000
It returned the land of the way it was and sort of create this patchwork of land

2050
01:57:00.001 --> 01:57:02.610
and then eventually put it in some sort of trust so it can never be touched in.

2051
01:57:02.611 --> 01:57:06.600
There can always be these,
these beautiful tracks of land forever.
Uh,

2052
01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:09.570
of course they'd have to be maintained and now to have to be how the trust would

2053
01:57:09.571 --> 01:57:12.990
have to be able to figure that out.
Maybe part of it is farm to,
to fund that.

2054
01:57:12.991 --> 01:57:15.780
But anyway,
that's something that I would probably love to talk about,

2055
01:57:15.781 --> 01:57:18.780
although I don't know enough about it to do.
You have a Ted talk,

2056
01:57:18.781 --> 01:57:21.960
but I can certainly talk someone's ear off for about an hour on all the little

2057
01:57:21.961 --> 01:57:22.800
details that I've learned.

2058
01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:24.810
<v 3>What a fantastic project.</v>

2059
01:57:25.050 --> 01:57:30.050
It's such a fun thing that sounds therapeutic to in in the sense that

2060
01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:36.900
having to embrace slowness in at least one compartment of your life seems to be

2061
01:57:41.201 --> 01:57:46.201
a nice counterbalance to potentially external or internal drives,

2062
01:57:46.901 --> 01:57:48.910
not necessarily in you,
but in a lot of people,

2063
01:57:48.911 --> 01:57:53.620
certainly myself included at times to do bigger things faster.
Right.

2064
01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:54.751
<v 4>No doubt.</v>

2065
01:57:54.751 --> 01:57:57.570
And the other thing about that I'll say is that you can't even speed this

2066
01:57:57.571 --> 01:58:01.350
process up if he wanted to.
And that's what's so awesome about it.
And by the way,

2067
01:58:01.351 --> 01:58:03.870
the process is multilevel,
multilayered in multi-tiered.

2068
01:58:03.930 --> 01:58:05.070
And probably by this point you're like,

2069
01:58:05.071 --> 01:58:09.450
I should never have asked him this question
anyway.
Uh,
real quick.
Um,

2070
01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:12.910
what's cool about it too is knowing to the plants,
like new plans come up and,

2071
01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:14.020
and all sorts of species blue,

2072
01:58:14.021 --> 01:58:17.700
but you start to see new insects and new insects come a few years later and
they,

2073
01:58:17.710 --> 01:58:19.500
they just,
somehow you're like,
where'd they come from?

2074
01:58:19.501 --> 01:58:22.290
And like they're still out there but they find it and they,
and they,

2075
01:58:22.710 --> 01:58:23.470
and they're there,

2076
01:58:23.470 --> 01:58:27.120
they're wired to proliferate and these environments and then you see new birds

2077
01:58:27.121 --> 01:58:30.120
and new bird species.
So there's like a hundred and something bird species.

2078
01:58:30.121 --> 01:58:32.700
Now on my property,
when originally there weren't,

2079
01:58:32.701 --> 01:58:35.010
there was like 40 and you're like where'd they come from?

2080
01:58:35.010 --> 01:58:35.761
And they just come from,

2081
01:58:35.761 --> 01:58:39.150
they find it somehow and they come in and then like here's the thing I've been

2082
01:58:39.151 --> 01:58:40.830
learning is if you build upon,
for example,

2083
01:58:40.831 --> 01:58:43.150
I don't have any pond but I have a river,
but if there's a pond,

2084
01:58:43.180 --> 01:58:47.200
if you just feel upon with water within a few years you will have fish.

2085
01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:51.250
And you're like,
what?
How does that happen?
Like how could that possibly be?

2086
01:58:51.610 --> 01:58:53.710
And it turns out like fish are,
you know,

2087
01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:57.510
a bird might be eating a fish and drop it before it's dead and it pops in the,

2088
01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:59.740
into there.
And that could have been a pregnant fish.
And before you know it,

2089
01:58:59.741 --> 01:59:04.330
like the whole thing is like life.
It's just waiting for souls.
Not Waiting,

2090
01:59:04.331 --> 01:59:08.020
it's everywhere.
But like,
if you restore property,
you restore some,
some,

2091
01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:11.350
some land and give it some space and let it do what it does.

2092
01:59:11.890 --> 01:59:13.120
Nature is so,

2093
01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:18.240
so resilient and just wants to thrive and it's so cool to watch it happen on its

2094
01:59:19.031 --> 01:59:22.780
own schedule and say nature is in never.
It's never in a hurry.

2095
01:59:23.410 --> 01:59:26.770
That's the thing that I love so much about it is that it's never in a hurry,

2096
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:28.420
but it accomplishes everything.

2097
01:59:28.690 --> 01:59:31.120
And that's a quote that I read somewhere and I don't know where I read it,

2098
01:59:31.121 --> 01:59:33.160
who said it,
but I love it and I always think about it,

2099
01:59:33.190 --> 01:59:36.610
which is that it'll take its time and it'll get it wherever it needs to get done

2100
01:59:36.611 --> 01:59:39.370
done.
And however long it takes,
it takes,
um,

2101
01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:43.840
which is such an analog or such an opposite in an analog and opposite to

2102
01:59:43.841 --> 01:59:48.370
humanity,
which is always rushing,
which is actually typically destroying,
um,

2103
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:51.280
and which is getting faster and faster and faster.

2104
01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:54.970
And I don't think it's the right path,
but it is what it is.

2105
01:59:56.480 --> 01:59:58.910
<v 3>Thank you for sharing.
I love that.</v>

2106
01:59:58.911 --> 02:00:03.911
It also makes me think about how much of life is setting the conditions for good

2107
02:00:04.581 --> 02:00:08.490
things to happen,
not trying to force good things.
And,
and uh,

2108
02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:11.330
to give another example that,
uh,

2109
02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:16.970
the kind of bio hacker slash nutrition crowd might be interested in is the

2110
02:00:17.300 --> 02:00:22.300
contrast between probiotics where you're say swallowing bacteria you hope will

2111
02:00:23.691 --> 02:00:26.180
take root in your gut among other things,
right?

2112
02:00:26.630 --> 02:00:29.960
Which often does not work very well.
Uh,

2113
02:00:30.090 --> 02:00:35.090
con contrasted with prebiotics where you're consuming different types of food

2114
02:00:35.641 --> 02:00:40.400
stuffs could be certain types of fiber,
Baobab route for instance,

2115
02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:43.730
which is effectively,
this is very simplified,

2116
02:00:43.731 --> 02:00:48.731
but restoring the soil conditions in your gut so that the types of bacteria you

2117
02:00:49.821 --> 02:00:53.150
want to grow naturally begin to take root and grow.

2118
02:00:53.870 --> 02:00:58.280
And you can't just take a handful of seeds and like drive them into the ground,

2119
02:00:58.820 --> 02:01:02.690
expecting them to pop out overnight.
It just doesn't,
it doesn't work that way.

2120
02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:06.140
And so thinking about setting the conditions is something I've been thinking a

2121
02:01:06.141 --> 02:01:11.141
lot about setting the conditions for positive emergent properties.

2122
02:01:12.650 --> 02:01:13.710
And then secondly,
you know,

2123
02:01:13.740 --> 02:01:17.120
it's just think about this today because I was watching a documentary last night

2124
02:01:17.121 --> 02:01:19.790
where this mother was giving her some advice and she said,

2125
02:01:19.791 --> 02:01:22.310
I just want you to learn patience.
You need to learn patience patients.
And you,

2126
02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:23.210
I've been seeing,

2127
02:01:23.210 --> 02:01:27.410
I thought over the years a lot about this word and whether I need more or less

2128
02:01:27.411 --> 02:01:28.160
patients.

2129
02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:33.160
And I was thinking today that it's maybe it's unproductive to think of it in

2130
02:01:34.881 --> 02:01:36.950
terms of more or less patients,

2131
02:01:37.010 --> 02:01:42.010
but rather in terms of developing the ability to discern between the things that

2132
02:01:44.421 --> 02:01:49.280
can and should be accelerated and the things that can't be accelerated.

2133
02:01:49.281 --> 02:01:51.800
And if you attempt to accelerate then we'll just do more damage.

2134
02:01:53.210 --> 02:01:56.180
<v 4>It's to that,
I mean,
I love this idea that you're bringing up about,</v>

2135
02:01:56.181 --> 02:01:58.280
about probiotics versus um,

2136
02:01:58.310 --> 02:02:02.690
prebiotics and creating the conditions for growth or creating conditions for

2137
02:02:02.691 --> 02:02:05.900
desired outcomes or whatever.
And I'm going to tie it all back.
I mean,

2138
02:02:05.930 --> 02:02:06.501
we're tying this,

2139
02:02:06.501 --> 02:02:10.790
like I'll let me tie like prairie restoration to business building,
which is,
um,

2140
02:02:11.300 --> 02:02:14.930
and,
and,
and gut building basically.
And,
and you know,
that gut health.

2141
02:02:14.931 --> 02:02:17.040
And the whole thing,
which is that part of the two is,

2142
02:02:17.041 --> 02:02:19.490
is not only creating the conditions for things to thrive,

2143
02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:24.290
but also not creating conditions for certain things to thrive.
So,
um,
something,

2144
02:02:24.291 --> 02:02:26.270
for example,
our business is self funded.
Yeah,

2145
02:02:26.271 --> 02:02:30.650
we did take money from Bayzos in 2006 but that was a personal founder shares.

2146
02:02:30.651 --> 02:02:32.390
None of that is money.
Everyone knew our business.

2147
02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:34.190
David and I took some money off the table.

2148
02:02:34.191 --> 02:02:38.000
So we've been 100% bootstrapped and funded by customers ever since day one,

2149
02:02:38.001 --> 02:02:42.050
which means we've created a situation where we don't have to answer to anybody,

2150
02:02:42.260 --> 02:02:44.790
we don't have to be in anyone else's timescale.
Um,

2151
02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:47.690
I don't have to build something that I know is going to have to be sold in seven

2152
02:02:47.691 --> 02:02:50.360
years because the fund is coming due and like they need their money out of it.

2153
02:02:50.690 --> 02:02:54.740
Or I also don't have to build something that grows at a certain rate because you

2154
02:02:54.741 --> 02:02:57.290
know,
you need to grow at a certain rate for a certain return.

2155
02:02:57.530 --> 02:03:02.530
We don't care about returns are the conditions we've set are not to have returns

2156
02:03:03.501 --> 02:03:06.680
thrive.
And,
and you know,
generally it turns for others.

2157
02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:11.030
But actually what we've tried to set up his profit conditions for profitability

2158
02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:15.410
and for sustainability because as long as we make more money than we spend,

2159
02:03:15.411 --> 02:03:19.820
we can exist for as long as we want.
There's no external,
um,
pressures,

2160
02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:22.910
artificial pressures that we've set up or conditions that we've created that

2161
02:03:22.911 --> 02:03:26.000
will force us to make a decision about when we have to sell the business at some

2162
02:03:26.001 --> 02:03:30.410
point.
So it's not only about creating conditions for thriving,

2163
02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:35.480
it's about like,
in fact putting up barriers for certain things not to happen.

2164
02:03:35.481 --> 02:03:38.450
And I've been thinking a lot personally about putting a lot of,

2165
02:03:38.451 --> 02:03:41.720
I've been putting a lot of energy into making sure certain things don't happen

2166
02:03:42.020 --> 02:03:46.010
versus putting energy in to make sure certain things do happen.
And,
uh,

2167
02:03:46.190 --> 02:03:50.060
I think if you can prevent a lot of things from happening by thinking about what

2168
02:03:50.061 --> 02:03:53.750
you don't want,
you do create the conditions then for other things to come in,

2169
02:03:53.751 --> 02:03:56.230
which are the things that you actually do want.
So,
um,
I,

2170
02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:59.810
I think there's a lot of similarities here between nature and business.
And,

2171
02:03:59.870 --> 02:04:02.210
and you know,
gut health is nature as well of course,

2172
02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:06.410
and and conditions and letting things sort of thrive and preventing other things

2173
02:04:06.411 --> 02:04:08.270
from happening.
I mean,
it's cool.
Like for example,

2174
02:04:08.271 --> 02:04:11.750
we have hundreds over a hundred species of birds now on the property.

2175
02:04:11.870 --> 02:04:14.870
We didn't put bird seed out.
Like,
you know,
you don't put bird seed out.

2176
02:04:14.900 --> 02:04:19.900
What you do is you put seed out that grows in the ground that then creates the

2177
02:04:20.241 --> 02:04:24.790
conditions or actually it grows seed.
So it does actually grow bird seed,
right?

2178
02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:26.180
It grows bird seed,

2179
02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:29.150
it just takes five years and then birds find it and they're like,

2180
02:04:29.151 --> 02:04:32.450
everything just happens the way it naturally should at the right pace and the

2181
02:04:32.451 --> 02:04:35.690
right scale.
And it's just very rewarding to to see that happening.

2182
02:04:35.691 --> 02:04:39.660
And I think it does color your impression of other things and sort of shows you

2183
02:04:39.661 --> 02:04:44.460
in many ways how sort of silly speed is in a lot of other things where it's

2184
02:04:44.461 --> 02:04:47.130
injected unnecessarily in,
in sort of the damage that it does.

2185
02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:50.770
<v 3>Absolutely.
Yeah,
absolutely.</v>

2186
02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:55.880
It's a topic we could go on and on with for for hours.

2187
02:04:56.091 --> 02:05:00.380
I'm sure.
So maybe we should do that at some point.
But,
uh,

2188
02:05:00.650 --> 02:05:04.910
let me wrap up with just a,
just a few more questions and one,

2189
02:05:04.911 --> 02:05:08.250
one of them I've asked you before,
uh,

2190
02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:10.410
and this will sound familiar and then I'll,

2191
02:05:10.411 --> 02:05:12.230
I'll pause for a second by little time.

2192
02:05:12.231 --> 02:05:15.500
But if you could have a giant billboard anywhere with anything on it,

2193
02:05:15.590 --> 02:05:17.990
what would it say and why?
Right.
It could be a quote,
could be a word,

2194
02:05:17.991 --> 02:05:20.210
could be a question,
could be anything.
It could be someone else's quote.

2195
02:05:20.540 --> 02:05:25.040
Now I asked you this question in tribe of mentors and you gay,

2196
02:05:25.050 --> 02:05:28.610
you see one of these quotes and you gave about out of 15 to 20,

2197
02:05:29.710 --> 02:05:33.890
maybe more,
25,
fantastic quotes.
I mean,
these are,
these are excellent quotes,

2198
02:05:33.891 --> 02:05:35.750
but right now in your life,

2199
02:05:35.751 --> 02:05:40.750
it doesn't have to relate to anything in the external,
wider world.
Uh,

2200
02:05:40.751 --> 02:05:43.400
uh,
let me,
let me read a few just to give people a taste.

2201
02:05:43.401 --> 02:05:47.840
And then I'd love to know which one you would pick.
Sure.
Right now in your life,

2202
02:05:47.841 --> 02:05:51.200
but,
well,
let me pick a few here.
If you think you're too small to be effective,

2203
02:05:51.201 --> 02:05:53.690
you've never been in the dark with a mosquito.
Betty Reese,

2204
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:56.360
every great Cosby begins as a movement,

2205
02:05:56.361 --> 02:06:00.770
becomes a business and eventually degenerates into a racket.
Eric Hoffer,
uh,

2206
02:06:00.860 --> 02:06:04.320
this one has proven very popular.
The fairest rules are those two,

2207
02:06:04.321 --> 02:06:07.370
which everyone would agree if they did not know how much power they would have.

2208
02:06:07.430 --> 02:06:08.750
John Rawls,
and I'll read,

2209
02:06:09.290 --> 02:06:12.610
I'll read one more since we've mentioned him a few times.
Prices.

2210
02:06:12.650 --> 02:06:17.270
What you pay value is what you get more in.
Lafitte.
Uh,
where,

2211
02:06:17.271 --> 02:06:21.230
where would you go at this point in your life with a message,
a word,
a quote,

2212
02:06:21.231 --> 02:06:25.220
a question,
anything on a gigantic billboard,
metaphorically of course,

2213
02:06:25.250 --> 02:06:27.710
getting a message out to millions or billions of people.

2214
02:06:28.190 --> 02:06:29.480
<v 4>Yeah.
Um,</v>

2215
02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:33.350
well I think it'd be fun just to say the word billboard on a billboard and just

2216
02:06:33.410 --> 02:06:36.650
leave.
Pay for it.
Pay for it for a hundred years.
And there it is,

2217
02:06:36.651 --> 02:06:41.050
it's called billboard,
but it would be kind of fun,
but also a gag.
Um,

2218
02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:45.390
I liked that,
that John Rawls quote so much,
which is a,

2219
02:06:45.391 --> 02:06:48.050
the Ferris rules are the ones you would,
I forget.

2220
02:06:48.180 --> 02:06:50.480
<v 3>Yeah,
agreed.
Yeah.
The Ferris rules of those two,</v>

2221
02:06:50.481 --> 02:06:53.750
which everyone would agree if they did not know how much power they would have.

2222
02:06:54.150 --> 02:06:54.640
<v 4>Yeah.
I,</v>

2223
02:06:54.640 --> 02:06:59.490
that to me is at the root of so many things.

2224
02:06:59.810 --> 02:07:03.190
Um,
we've been dealing with a little bit of this in our,
in our own business.
Uh,

2225
02:07:03.310 --> 02:07:04.650
it's a little bit slightly different,

2226
02:07:04.651 --> 02:07:08.310
but just like information asymmetry and recognizing that everybody has the same

2227
02:07:08.311 --> 02:07:08.911
information.

2228
02:07:08.911 --> 02:07:11.910
So they look at things through different lenses and it's very important to

2229
02:07:11.911 --> 02:07:16.020
recognize the fact that you can't just come at something one way because you

2230
02:07:16.021 --> 02:07:20.010
know it,
if someone else doesn't know it,
you can't assume that they knew that.

2231
02:07:20.250 --> 02:07:24.940
And you know,
there's,
it's the same sort of idea which is,
which is,
um,
uh,
you,
you,

2232
02:07:24.941 --> 02:07:27.120
you almost,
you can't be upset when someone has a PR,

2233
02:07:27.180 --> 02:07:29.940
a reaction to something when they just have a different set of information.

2234
02:07:29.941 --> 02:07:33.810
And similarly,
you know,
um,
uh,
you,

2235
02:07:34.020 --> 02:07:35.860
the rules are,
are,
you know,

2236
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:39.790
rules are based on like who has the power to make them basically today.

2237
02:07:39.790 --> 02:07:43.060
That's kind of how it is in almost everything.
Um,

2238
02:07:43.061 --> 02:07:45.610
and so it's a good reminder that um,

2239
02:07:46.010 --> 02:07:49.930
rules basically are the Ferris to those who make them unfortunately,

2240
02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:52.870
but they would be the fairest if no one knew who they applied to.

2241
02:07:53.230 --> 02:07:55.660
And it just a good reminder and a lot of different levels.

2242
02:07:55.690 --> 02:07:58.420
It's one of my favorite quotes and I think that's probably something I would put

2243
02:07:58.421 --> 02:08:01.420
up on a billboard.
It'd be hard to read at 70 miles an hour to speed by it,

2244
02:08:01.421 --> 02:08:04.840
which is why I still like billboard.
But um,
as a quote,

2245
02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:05.890
I think it's the most meaningful,

2246
02:08:05.891 --> 02:08:08.120
one of the most meaningful quotes and most important quotes to,

2247
02:08:08.121 --> 02:08:10.120
to keep in mind whatever it is that you do.

2248
02:08:10.650 --> 02:08:11.900
<v 3>Definitely.
And I'll read,</v>

2249
02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:16.440
I'll read one more just because actually every two more of your quotes because

2250
02:08:17.370 --> 02:08:18.840
there are many to choose from.
Uh,

2251
02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:21.990
here's one that applies certainly to a few things.

2252
02:08:21.991 --> 02:08:23.430
We've talked about the conversation quote,

2253
02:08:23.460 --> 02:08:27.000
not everything that can be counted counts and not everything that counts can be

2254
02:08:27.001 --> 02:08:31.200
counted.
William,
Bruce Cameron,
and then the next,

2255
02:08:31.201 --> 02:08:36.180
and the last one I'll read is by Albert Schweitzer in the hopes of reaching the

2256
02:08:36.181 --> 02:08:38.820
moon.
Men fail to see the flowers at Lawson at their feet.

2257
02:08:39.980 --> 02:08:42.660
<v 4>And I've got a story,</v>

2258
02:08:42.661 --> 02:08:47.520
but maybe for another time about that quote.
Well,
I can tell you now.
Let's do it.

2259
02:08:47.580 --> 02:08:50.460
Let's just get into it.
Sure.
So,
um,
I don't know.

2260
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:53.700
A number of years ago I was invited to,
to go to this,
uh,

2261
02:08:53.730 --> 02:08:57.510
John Maeda invited me to go to this thing,
um,
at the,

2262
02:08:57.511 --> 02:09:02.100
at the glass house in new Canaan,
Connecticut.
I think it is,
um,

2263
02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:03.240
the Philip Johnson Glass House.

2264
02:09:03.241 --> 02:09:08.241
And it was a like a summit on simplicity and there was I think 10 or 15 people

2265
02:09:08.311 --> 02:09:13.000
invited.
And um,
uh,
one of the people invited was,

2266
02:09:13.001 --> 02:09:15.240
it was this older man,
Japanese man,

2267
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:17.190
I think he was in his eighties or close to it.

2268
02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:21.150
Almost everyone else was as much younger,
much,
much younger.
20s and 30s.

2269
02:09:21.450 --> 02:09:25.710
Forties maybe.
Um,
and like I said earlier,
I love,

2270
02:09:25.711 --> 02:09:28.110
oh I love older people so I sort of gravitated to him.

2271
02:09:28.110 --> 02:09:32.040
He was really well dressed and just,
it seemed interesting and um,

2272
02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:34.550
I noticed that he was,
um,
whenever we were going.

2273
02:09:34.620 --> 02:09:36.300
So the Philip Johnson Glass House,

2274
02:09:36.301 --> 02:09:39.240
the whole campus I think is about 50 acres and there's maybe a dozen different

2275
02:09:39.241 --> 02:09:43.140
buildings and it's kind of a neat idea because Philip Johnson had this idea that

2276
02:09:43.141 --> 02:09:46.810
it's actually one building and the hallways or just outside,
um,

2277
02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:50.580
which is kind of a cool thought.
Um,
but really it's like 12 different buildings.

2278
02:09:51.180 --> 02:09:53.520
Like for example is all,
he has an office which was a separate building,

2279
02:09:53.521 --> 02:09:54.360
which doesn't have a bathroom,

2280
02:09:54.361 --> 02:09:57.060
doesn't have plumbing because he didn't need it cause it's like it's still part

2281
02:09:57.061 --> 02:09:59.910
of the house that has plumbing.
I just have to walk outside to get there.
Anyway,

2282
02:10:00.030 --> 02:10:02.860
we were walking between these houses and you have a 50 acre site,

2283
02:10:02.861 --> 02:10:05.550
so there's a bit of distance between these buildings.

2284
02:10:05.580 --> 02:10:10.580
And I noticed that this guy was always last in the line to walk and I kinda sat

2285
02:10:12.361 --> 02:10:17.220
back with him on,
on one of the walks and,
and,
you know,
but he was also like,

2286
02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:20.130
it wasn't because he was old and that would be the first thing you would think

2287
02:10:20.131 --> 02:10:24.480
that he's just older,
so he's going to walk slower.
But actually he's like,
no.

2288
02:10:24.530 --> 02:10:27.900
And I could tell that he was physically able to walk as fast as everybody else.

2289
02:10:27.901 --> 02:10:29.220
It wasn't that he goes,
you know,

2290
02:10:29.221 --> 02:10:32.880
everyone's just walking too fast and they're missing things as they go.
Um,

2291
02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:35.540
he was so,
he just kneel down and he looked,

2292
02:10:35.780 --> 02:10:40.190
he took like this square foot of ground.
And,
um,
uh,
and by the way,

2293
02:10:40.191 --> 02:10:42.650
I had noticed as he was walking,
he was looking down as well.

2294
02:10:42.651 --> 02:10:45.530
So he's walking slowly and looking down and he,
he just,

2295
02:10:45.770 --> 02:10:47.300
he kind of took the square foot of,
of,

2296
02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:51.680
of land and like pointed out some flowers and some insects and some shapes and

2297
02:10:51.681 --> 02:10:53.780
some stuff and says like,
this is beautiful.

2298
02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:56.390
People feel like they have to go all over the world to see something new.

2299
02:10:56.391 --> 02:10:58.740
All they have to do is look down.
Um,

2300
02:10:59.090 --> 02:11:03.560
and if you walk slowly and looked down like there's a world under your feet all

2301
02:11:03.561 --> 02:11:07.220
the time,
an interesting world.
And he goes,
these people ahead of me,

2302
02:11:07.850 --> 02:11:10.850
they're younger.
Yeah,
maybe they can walk a bit faster,

2303
02:11:10.851 --> 02:11:14.490
but look at everything they're missing.
Uh,
and I just,

2304
02:11:14.570 --> 02:11:19.370
that really just kind of totally smacked me in the face.
I love this point.
Like,

2305
02:11:19.371 --> 02:11:22.670
yeah,
they're going faster and they look like they're going somewhere but look at

2306
02:11:22.671 --> 02:11:26.870
everything and they're missing along the way.
And so,
uh,
that,
uh,

2307
02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:30.230
point about that other quote that you just brought up about going to the moon,

2308
02:11:30.260 --> 02:11:34.040
missing the flowers,
like that's sort of similar thing,
which is,
you know,

2309
02:11:34.041 --> 02:11:37.070
especially today where everyone's rushing all over the place trying to get

2310
02:11:37.071 --> 02:11:37.671
somewhere and you're like,

2311
02:11:37.671 --> 02:11:39.650
where are you actually going and what are you actually missing?

2312
02:11:39.650 --> 02:11:41.720
And I thought that that,
that moment,

2313
02:11:42.010 --> 02:11:45.110
this guy actually stopping and physically explain that to me and looking down

2314
02:11:45.111 --> 02:11:45.950
and pointing out some things.

2315
02:11:45.951 --> 02:11:48.320
It was a really poignant thing and it's something I always have always

2316
02:11:48.321 --> 02:11:53.030
remembered since then.
What a lovely story.
He's a lovely man.

2317
02:11:53.031 --> 02:11:53.841
I think he's still around.

2318
02:11:53.841 --> 02:11:58.610
I'm sure you that from my understanding is he's a Japanese garden expert.

2319
02:11:58.611 --> 02:12:01.910
He has an amazing Japanese garden apparently in his backyard somewhere in

2320
02:12:01.911 --> 02:12:03.440
northern California.
Uh,

2321
02:12:03.860 --> 02:12:06.560
and he's also like a wine connoisseur and supposed to be a really fascinating

2322
02:12:06.561 --> 02:12:09.540
guy.
I never really caught up with them afterwards.
I always meant to and I,

2323
02:12:09.541 --> 02:12:12.290
I missed that opportunity and I should probably figure out how to get touch with

2324
02:12:12.291 --> 02:12:13.520
them,
but wonderful man,

2325
02:12:13.521 --> 02:12:16.760
really interesting person and I appreciate the lesson he taught me there.

2326
02:12:17.870 --> 02:12:19.340
<v 3>Let me track him down and let me know.</v>

2327
02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:22.730
It sounds like maybe the type of person I got hot gas.
Yeah,

2328
02:12:23.270 --> 02:12:27.890
definitely someone who can really embrace the,
the joy of missing out.
Yeah.

2329
02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:32.960
Shit.
Uh,
Jason will,
this has been so much fun.

2330
02:12:32.990 --> 02:12:37.610
I really appreciate you taking the time today to chat with me and share your

2331
02:12:37.611 --> 02:12:38.930
stories with the world also.

2332
02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:40.920
<v 4>Well thanks for having me.
This is super fun.</v>

2333
02:12:40.921 --> 02:12:43.800
It's always fun to talk to you and thanks for giving me so much time to do that.

2334
02:12:44.100 --> 02:12:45.660
<v 3>My pleasure.
And is there,</v>

2335
02:12:45.661 --> 02:12:50.070
is there anything else before we wrap up that you would like to ask of the

2336
02:12:50.071 --> 02:12:54.630
audience,
suggest to the audience?
Any closing comments of any type?

2337
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:58.520
<v 4>Nope.
I don't have any,
actually.
I like answering questions so I don't,</v>

2338
02:12:58.521 --> 02:13:02.480
I don't have any proclamations or anything to,
to share,
so I don't,
um,

2339
02:13:02.690 --> 02:13:06.000
if anyone wants to,
to get in touch,
I think you'll have some of that stuff.

2340
02:13:06.001 --> 02:13:08.570
So feel free to hit me up on Twitter or wherever.
Oh,

2341
02:13:08.571 --> 02:13:10.030
the other thing actually I will mention,
um,

2342
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:13.280
David and id chase and I are doing this new a youtube channel,

2343
02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:16.250
which is kind of a,
something that people have been asking for for a while.

2344
02:13:16.251 --> 02:13:20.030
We're calling it getting real and we're basically showing what are like,

2345
02:13:20.031 --> 02:13:22.340
kind of like you asked me like,
what's your day like,
what do you,

2346
02:13:22.370 --> 02:13:24.890
people always like,
what's your morning like and what,
what,
what do you do?

2347
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:27.570
I'm like,
well,
why don't I just show you?
So,
um,

2348
02:13:27.710 --> 02:13:30.110
we're doing these videos of actually walking through code samples,

2349
02:13:30.111 --> 02:13:32.970
walking through design decisions through design reviews and making them all

2350
02:13:32.971 --> 02:13:35.090
public.
So I think it's kind of a neat thing to,

2351
02:13:35.490 --> 02:13:38.880
to check out if you're interested in sort of how we look at design and how we

2352
02:13:38.881 --> 02:13:40.230
look at Code and how we look at writing.

2353
02:13:40.260 --> 02:13:43.410
One of the things actually did was I wrote an article for ink recently and I

2354
02:13:43.411 --> 02:13:47.580
just recorded my screen and sort of talked out loud as I was writing it to sort

2355
02:13:47.581 --> 02:13:49.140
of show like here's how I read an article.

2356
02:13:49.141 --> 02:13:51.060
I don't start with an outline and you start with a blank sheet.

2357
02:13:51.061 --> 02:13:52.440
I got Kinda just right.

2358
02:13:52.441 --> 02:13:56.220
And then I was sort of doing the director's cut is I went and editing is editing

2359
02:13:56.221 --> 02:13:59.460
live as I wanted to know,
sort of a fun sort of thing.
Um,

2360
02:13:59.461 --> 02:14:01.350
so I'm doing some of that which should be kind of fun to follow.

2361
02:14:01.351 --> 02:14:04.620
People are interested in that.
Um,
other than that,
everything else to,
to share.

2362
02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:10.110
<v 3>You've written a lot and do you have many popular articles,
essays,</v>

2363
02:14:10.170 --> 02:14:12.390
blog posts,
et cetera,
online.

2364
02:14:13.170 --> 02:14:16.260
If someone wanted to start with one or two,

2365
02:14:16.410 --> 02:14:21.410
are there one or two that you could mention as a gateway drug into the mind of

2366
02:14:21.721 --> 02:14:22.554
Jason?

2367
02:14:23.260 --> 02:14:25.390
<v 4>Well speaking,
based on our conversation today,</v>

2368
02:14:25.391 --> 02:14:29.410
there was this article I wrote about like I've never had a goal a which should

2369
02:14:29.411 --> 02:14:32.260
be a good thing to start reading.
I think that would are a good place to read.

2370
02:14:32.261 --> 02:14:35.530
I think probably it's on,
it's on our blog signal versus noise,

2371
02:14:35.531 --> 02:14:36.460
which is on medium.

2372
02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:39.870
If you searched for my name on Google and say never had a goal,
you'll probably,

2373
02:14:39.871 --> 02:14:40.704
yeah,

2374
02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:42.160
<v 3>I try be a good</v>

2375
02:14:42.460 --> 02:14:47.080
<v 4>Jason freed.
Never had a goal,
they'd probably be a good one to read.
And then,
um,</v>

2376
02:14:48.010 --> 02:14:50.710
uh,
I also wrote one about not having expectations,

2377
02:14:50.711 --> 02:14:53.860
which might be another interesting thing to look at.
Um,

2378
02:14:54.220 --> 02:14:56.860
if there's any other ones,
I'll,
I'll,
uh,
I mean there,
there are some other ones,

2379
02:14:56.861 --> 02:14:58.630
but I'm not sure if they'd be good places to start,

2380
02:14:58.631 --> 02:15:00.100
but those might be a good place to start.

2381
02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:04.490
<v 3>Great.
And I'll,
uh,
I'll include chairs,</v>

2382
02:15:04.730 --> 02:15:08.510
maybe prairie restoration,
uh,
the Polaris Watch,

2383
02:15:09.270 --> 02:15:12.140
I'll send you all that stuff.
We'll include all of that in the show notes.

2384
02:15:12.141 --> 02:15:13.280
So for people listening,

2385
02:15:13.310 --> 02:15:18.310
you'll be able to find all of that at tim.blog/podcast and just search Jason and

2386
02:15:19.281 --> 02:15:23.450
it'll pop right up and you can find all of these links and more as well as every

2387
02:15:23.451 --> 02:15:26.660
other episode.
And,
uh,
Jason at some point,

2388
02:15:26.661 --> 02:15:29.510
maybe we'll do a round two and it'd be lovely to see you in person sometime.

2389
02:15:29.930 --> 02:15:34.520
<v 4>Yeah.
You're down.
Where are you now?
I'm in Austin,
Texas.
Austin.
Okay.
Well,
uh,</v>

2390
02:15:34.820 --> 02:15:36.470
at some point,
yeah,
we'll run into each other again,

2391
02:15:36.471 --> 02:15:38.450
but I'd love to do it again and if we want to do it in person,

2392
02:15:38.451 --> 02:15:40.250
that'd be even better.
So let me know.
I'm around.

2393
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:43.610
<v 3>Definitely.
Yeah.
You know,
Austin,
Texas,
it's the third coast as they say.</v>

2394
02:15:44.490 --> 02:15:47.970
He said that about Chicago,
I think every,
every other places.

2395
02:15:47.980 --> 02:15:52.880
This is the third coast.
Yeah.
Fantastic.
Need water to be a coast.
I mean,

2396
02:15:52.881 --> 02:15:56.670
at least we have lakes.
We do have some creaks.
Uh,

2397
02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:01.580
we're not returning entirely dry.
There are rivers,
so we do what we do have that.

2398
02:16:01.670 --> 02:16:02.180
Uh,

2399
02:16:02.180 --> 02:16:07.180
but to be continued and to everyone out there on the interwebs and beyond.

2400
02:16:09.530 --> 02:16:14.220
As always,
thank you for listening.
Be Safe or not and

2401
02:16:14.660 --> 02:16:17.930
<v 0>pay attention to what's under your feet.
Until next time,
thanks for listening.</v>

2402
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:22.820
Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.

2403
02:16:23.180 --> 02:16:25.790
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

2404
02:16:26.090 --> 02:16:29.090
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2405
02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:31.690
You enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday.

2406
02:16:32.140 --> 02:16:36.220
That provides a little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet

2407
02:16:36.221 --> 02:16:40.840
Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that

2408
02:16:40.841 --> 02:16:42.430
I've been pondering over the week.

2409
02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:45.430
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

2410
02:16:45.431 --> 02:16:48.880
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2411
02:16:48.881 --> 02:16:53.200
somehow dug up in the other world of the esoteric as I do.

2412
02:16:53.470 --> 02:16:58.470
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

2413
02:16:59.111 --> 02:17:01.840
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

2414
02:17:01.930 --> 02:17:06.910
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend,

2415
02:17:06.970 --> 02:17:09.160
so if you want to receive that,
check it out.

2416
02:17:09.430 --> 02:17:14.080
Just go to a four hour work week.com that's four hour work week.com all spelled

2417
02:17:14.081 --> 02:17:18.220
out and just drop in your email and you'll get the very next one and if you sign

2418
02:17:18.221 --> 02:17:19.360
up,
I hope you enjoyed.

2419
02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:24.940
This episode is brought to you by wordpress.com I love wordpress.

2420
02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:29.170
I have used it for so many years.
It's my goto platform,

2421
02:17:29.260 --> 02:17:34.180
blogging and creating websites.
I use wordpress.com for everything every day.

2422
02:17:34.330 --> 02:17:38.440
My site tim.blog is built on it.
The websites for my books,

2423
02:17:38.600 --> 02:17:40.930
including tools of titans,
tribe of mentors,

2424
02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:45.610
all in wordpress.com and the founder Matt Mullenweg wouldn't have close friends,

2425
02:17:45.611 --> 02:17:48.400
has appeared on this show many times.
The search,

2426
02:17:48.460 --> 02:17:51.960
Matt Mullenweg Tequila Ferris for quite an exciting time.

2427
02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:56.530
Whether you're looking to create a personal blog,
a business site,
or both,

2428
02:17:56.830 --> 02:18:00.250
you can make a really big impact right out of the box when you build on

2429
02:18:00.251 --> 02:18:04.960
wordpress.com and you'll be in good company.
It's used by the New Yorker,
Jay Z,

2430
02:18:04.961 --> 02:18:07.990
Beyonce,
five 38 tech crunch,
Ted,
CNN,

2431
02:18:08.100 --> 02:18:10.390
and time just to name a handful,

2432
02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:14.680
and one of my friends at Google shall remain nameless,

2433
02:18:14.980 --> 02:18:19.980
has told me that wordpress.com offers the best out of the box SEO imaginable

2434
02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:21.600
input.

2435
02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:26.560
It's one of the many reasons that nearly 30% of the Internet is run on
wordpress.

2436
02:18:27.220 --> 02:18:30.700
You do not need experience or to hire someone that's perhaps the best part.

2437
02:18:31.150 --> 02:18:33.420
wordpress.com guide you through the entire experience.

2438
02:18:33.450 --> 02:18:36.280
They have hundreds of designs and templates that you can use,

2439
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:41.560
and it's easy to get started.
There's no need to worry about security upgrades,

2440
02:18:41.561 --> 02:18:45.940
posting any of that debt for 24 seven support.
And they're very,

2441
02:18:45.941 --> 02:18:48.310
very responsive questions to here,
right back to you.

2442
02:18:48.730 --> 02:18:52.780
And this allows you to create the highest quality with the least amount of

2443
02:18:52.781 --> 02:18:56.020
headache and friction.
So if you're building a website period,

2444
02:18:56.310 --> 02:19:00.130
and my friends come to me and ask what I use,
what I recommend they use,

2445
02:19:00.460 --> 02:19:03.850

What's check it out.

2452
02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:28.850
This episode is brought to you by Peloton and I'd heard about Peloton over and

2453
02:19:28.851 --> 02:19:29.660
over again,

2454
02:19:29.660 --> 02:19:34.550
but I ended up getting a Peloton bike and the whole system after I saw my buddy

2455
02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:37.670
Kevin Rose,
I've known him forever,
some of you know,

2456
02:19:37.730 --> 02:19:42.730
and he showed up at my gate at my house a while back and he looked fantastic.

2457
02:19:45.170 --> 02:19:47.960
I asked him as a dude,
you look great.
What the hell have you been up to?

2458
02:19:47.961 --> 02:19:50.120
Because he's always doing a weird diet or another,

2459
02:19:50.121 --> 02:19:51.620
but it only lasts like a week or two.

2460
02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:55.490
So he always regresses to the mean after like 75 beers and he said,

2461
02:19:55.491 --> 02:19:57.650
I've been doing peloton five days a week.

2462
02:19:57.830 --> 02:20:02.750
Now that caught my attention because Kevin does nothing five days a week and you

2463
02:20:02.751 --> 02:20:05.990
know,
I love you Kevin,
but it really peaked my curiosity.

2464
02:20:06.050 --> 02:20:11.050
Ended up getting a system and it's become an integral part of my week.

2465
02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:15.950
I love it and I really didn't expect to love it at all because I find cycling

2466
02:20:15.951 --> 02:20:17.570
really boring usually,

2467
02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:22.640
but peloton is an indoor cycling bike that brings live studio classes right into

2468
02:20:22.641 --> 02:20:23.474
your home.

2469
02:20:23.570 --> 02:20:26.030
You don't have to worry about fitting classes into your schedule or making it to

2470
02:20:26.031 --> 02:20:28.470
a studio with some type of commute,
etc.

2471
02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:32.600
New classes are added every day and this includes options led by elite New York

2472
02:20:32.601 --> 02:20:34.040
City instructors in your own living room.

2473
02:20:34.430 --> 02:20:38.090
You can even livestream studio classes taught by the world's best instructors or

2474
02:20:38.091 --> 02:20:43.091
find her own favorite class on demand and in fact Kevin and I rarely do live

2475
02:20:43.281 --> 02:20:46.940
classes and you can compete with your friends which is also fun.
Kevin,

2476
02:20:46.941 --> 02:20:51.080
I'm coming after you but we usually just use classes on demand.

2477
02:20:51.230 --> 02:20:53.720
I really like not Wilbur's and his iron,

2478
02:20:53.750 --> 02:20:58.750
high intensity training sessions that are shorter like 20 minutes and I think

2479
02:20:59.870 --> 02:21:04.610
Kevin's favorite is Alex and everyone seems to have their favorite instructor or

2480
02:21:04.611 --> 02:21:06.890
you can select by music duration and so on.

2481
02:21:07.460 --> 02:21:12.440
Each Peloton bike includes a 22 inch HD touchscreen performance tracking
metrics.

2482
02:21:12.441 --> 02:21:16.760
I think that that along with the realtime leaderboard are the main reasons that

2483
02:21:16.761 --> 02:21:21.440
this caught my attention when cycling never had caught my attention before.

2484
02:21:21.470 --> 02:21:24.950
It's really pretty stunning what they've done with the user interface to keep

2485
02:21:24.951 --> 02:21:25.784
your attention.

2486
02:21:25.940 --> 02:21:29.900
The belt drive is quiet and it's smaller than you'd expect so it can fit in a

2487
02:21:29.901 --> 02:21:31.250
living room or an office.

2488
02:21:31.280 --> 02:21:36.280
I actually have it in a large closet and believe it or not and it fits with no

2489
02:21:36.861 --> 02:21:40.310
problem.
So peloton is offering all of you guys,

2490
02:21:40.430 --> 02:21:42.260

2491
