00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.540
Welcome to another edition of the Tim Ferriss show.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.890
I would like to start this very special episode with two things.
First,

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.770
a quote and that is quote,

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.960
be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and

5
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:20.961
those who matter don't mind and quote from none other than Dr Seuss.

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.670
Love that quote.
Second,

7
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.110
just a little bit of trivia since the coauthor of what I learned,

8
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.210
losing $1 million is our guest today.

9
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.830
I thought I would look at the number 1 million,
the denomination,
1 million.

10
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:37.800
It's a big deal in the U S and a lot of western culture,

11
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.810
but perhaps you didn't know that the number 10,000 is a very big deal in for

12
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:43.380
instance,

13
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.380
Japan and when they say Bonzai Bonzai when they throw their arms up in the air,

14
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.110
that is button or like Iti Bong been 10,000 years,

15
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.640
Xy Bonzai 10,000 years,
10,000 years.
So there you have it,

16
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.730
a quote and a random piece of trivia that you can play with this episode.

17
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.130
We have Brendan Moynahan with us.

18
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.240
Brennan Moyninhan is a managing director at market field asset management,

19
00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:15.420
which has $20 billion or so of assets under management.

20
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.010
He's also the senior advisor to the editor and chief of Bloomberg News.

21
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.640
He's an adjunct professor at Vanderbilt University where he teaches both

22
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:25.800
international finance investment analysis.

23
00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:29.430
And previous to all of that he spent more than 20 years on Wall Street as a

24
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:32.970
trader and risk manager.
He's written a whole slew of books,

25
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.940
mostly on finance and investing.

26
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:40.320
But the one that I want to highlight today is what I learned losing $1 million.

27
00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:41.730
And as you'll hear in the interview,

28
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
this is one of the few books in existence that has been praised by Nassim Taleb

29
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:51.360
who is author of the Black Swan or is author of the Black Swan among others.

30
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.670
And uh,
it was labeled by him,

31
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.990
one of the rare non Sharla tannic books and finance.
What does that mean?
Well,

32
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.050
I chase down this book when it wasn't in print and read it and had a huge impact

33
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:04.110
on me.

34
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.110
So much so that it is one of the few books in the Tim Ferriss Book Club.

35
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.541
I,

36
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:14.250
it is the newest book in the Tim Ferriss Book Club and there are 1,000,001 ways

37
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:19.251
to make money and as a result there are a million in one way is to publish books

38
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.190
about varying methods of success,
making money and so on.

39
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.870
As it turns out,

40
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.930
it's perhaps a much smarter approach to look at the few ways in which people

41
00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:35.460
consistently lose money consistently make big trading mistakes,

42
00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:39.060
investment mistakes,
business mistakes that cost them money.

43
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.710
So if you can identify the principle ways that people lose money and in this

44
00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:48.711
case the other coauthor Jim Paul had us a really dramatic story of losing more

45
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.270
than a million dollars that you can then define rules for yourself that allow

46
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:56.100
you to be a better investor,

47
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.520
a better business person and in general succeed better in life.

48
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.150
Pretty fascinating stuff.
So Brendan is our guest today.

49
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.730
I hope you enjoy it.
As always,

50
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.770
this podcast is supported by you guys.
If you like these podcasts,

51
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:14.200
both the short inbetween Assos,
the longer interviews,

52
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.890
please take a look at the Tim Ferriss Book Club.
Just go to four hour work,

53
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:19.750
week.com all spelled out,

54
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:23.560
four hour workweek.com forward slash books you will find about a half dozen

55
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:28.180
books that have had a huge impact on my life,
including this book,
what I learned,

56
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:31.660
losing $1 million.
And if you click on those,
it'll take you through to Amazon.

57
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.400
And that keeps this podcast going because it does take a lot of time and some

58
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:39.220
capital to put together.
So without further ado,

59
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.490
I introduce you to Brendan Monaghan.
Enjoy

60
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.520
<v 1>at this altitude.
I can flat out hands start shaking.</v>

61
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.193
You posted a question.

62
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.230
I'm a cybernetic organism living this show.
Well,

63
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.160
welcome everyone

64
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.330
<v 0>[inaudible] to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show and I'm very excited to</v>

65
00:04:09.331 --> 00:04:13.170
have Brendan Moynahan with us today.
Brendan,
how are you

66
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.620
doing?

67
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.620
Extremely well and I am thrilled to be chatting with you because of course I was

68
00:04:21.351 --> 00:04:23.990
introduced to your work first through what I learned,

69
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.110
losing $1 million and I remember being introduced to it by an intolerable

70
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.770
naissant Taleb who wrote of course antifragile then before that,

71
00:04:33.771 --> 00:04:35.810
the Black Swan and then fooled by randomness.

72
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.880
And one of the lines that stuck out in his most recent book about what I learned

73
00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:45.881
losing $1 million was that it was one of the rare non Charlotte tannic if that's

74
00:04:46.401 --> 00:04:48.890
the correct pronunciation,
books and finance.

75
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.060
And I was hoping before we jump into all sorts of other questions that I'd like

76
00:04:53.061 --> 00:04:55.460
to ask,
why do you think he said that?

77
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.590
Why do you think he used that particular adjective?

78
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.720
<v 2>I had never met him when he puts the title of my book,</v>

79
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.240
the Black Swan and at that time he said it was the best non Shawl Atlantic

80
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.630
finance book you've ever read.

81
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.960
And it was actually that mention that cause a little bit of a struggle with

82
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.680
email for me to reprint the book.

83
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:17.020
So we put in the book based on what happened in the Black Swan.

84
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.560
And then a few years later he was at an interview with a desert as a journalist

85
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.530
at Bloomberg News.

86
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.970
And I happened to be a consultant there at the time and they invited me to sit

87
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:31.450
in on a lunch and he recognized my name when I was introduced just because he

88
00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:34.630
had put it in his book.
So I never really queried him about,

89
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.000
I mean I was thankful that he did it because he's not known for handing out

90
00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:39.834
compliment.

91
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.230
<v 0>So
happy to</v>

92
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.840
<v 2>have had it and I wasn't going to jinx it,</v>

93
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.260
but we had a vigorous discussion while we were in that room and it turns out

94
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:49.120
that he's read a lot of the same things that I've read.

95
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:51.970
And so it was sort of a dialogue between him and me while the reporters were

96
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:54.850
kind of taking notes,
which is very interesting.
So I don't know why he did that,

97
00:05:54.851 --> 00:05:59.060
but when I think that it's because was an opposite tact and that there's so many

98
00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:02.390
books out there on how I made $1 million in the stock market last year before

99
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:04.640
breakfast.
And in the million dollar book that I wrote,

100
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:06.710
I even go back and try to find out how old is this?

101
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:11.420
And there's a book from like 1881 I think by James Briskin called the beef

102
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:12.670
bonanza,
how to get rich on [inaudible]

103
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.600
<v 0>place.
It wasn't the stock market,
livestock,</v>

104
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.690
<v 2>the market,
but people have been forever.
Like,</v>

105
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.720
I'm going to tell you my secrets of how I got rich.
I don't understand that.

106
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.530
So I titled this book,
What I learned,
losing $1 million with my coauthor.
Again,

107
00:06:25.531 --> 00:06:28.110
Jim lost the money,
not me.
I want to be clear about that.

108
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.530
But why would somebody revealed their secrets to making it?

109
00:06:31.531 --> 00:06:33.330
Why don't we examine what goes wrong?

110
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.540
And then if somebody is willing to bare their soul about that and share the

111
00:06:36.541 --> 00:06:38.970
mistakes,
then as a parable,

112
00:06:38.971 --> 00:06:42.960
it might have more resonance with people about what not to do rather than what

113
00:06:42.961 --> 00:06:45.240
to do.
And I think there's a,
I'll get into it later,

114
00:06:45.241 --> 00:06:48.240
but he was a real premise for why it's essential to know the downside rather

115
00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:50.220
than all the different ways to make it on the upside.

116
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.220
<v 0>Well,
I think it's funny.</v>
