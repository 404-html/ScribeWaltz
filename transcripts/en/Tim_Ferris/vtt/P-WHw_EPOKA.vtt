00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.810
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.811 --> 00:00:06.020
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.480
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

4
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.550
<v 2>This episode is brought to you by audible,
which I've used for years.</v>

5
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.450
I love audiobooks and I've two to recommend right off the bat.

6
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.780
Number one is press my favorite audio book of all time,

7
00:00:34.781 --> 00:00:37.510
and that is the graveyard book by Neil Gaiman.

8
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.770
The only audiobook I've wanted to immediately listen to a second time.

9
00:00:41.771 --> 00:00:46.150
As soon as I finished.
It's amazing.
You will thank me.
The graveyard book.

10
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.880
The second is vagabonding by Rolf Potts,

11
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.500
which had a huge impact on my life and formed the basis for a lot of what became

12
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.580
the four hour workweek.

13

19
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.760
This episode is brought to you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor.

20
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.530
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way,
set it and forget it.

21
00:01:32.531 --> 00:01:36.910
Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous

22
00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:37.630
investors.

23
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.350
It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than

24
00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:44.350
two and a half billion dollars under management.
In fact,

25
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.730
some of my very good friends,

26
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.940
investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront.

27
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.000
So the question is why?
Why is it so popular?
Why is it unique?

28
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.290
Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

29
00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:58.270
pay pennies on the dollar for them.

30
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.020
And this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations,

31
00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:04.750
bloated sales teams,
et cetera.
And I'll come back to that in a second.

32
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.500
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim,

33
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.660
take the risk assessment quiz,

34
00:02:10.661 --> 00:02:13.660
which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for free.

35
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.990
Exactly the portfolio they'd put you in and if you just want to take their

36
00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:20.890
advice,
run with it,
do it yourself,
you can do that or as I would,

37
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:22.780
you can set it and forget it and here's why.

38
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.100
The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that

39
00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:30.490
investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't.

40
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.190
Great investing is a marathon,
not a sprint,

41
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.850
and little things that you may or may not be familiar with like automatic tax

42
00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:39.010
loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

43
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.480
cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large

44
00:02:43.481 --> 00:02:47.200
amounts of money over longer periods of time.
Wealthfront,
as I mentioned,

45
00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:49.810
since it's using software instead of retail locations,

46
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.980
etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely

47
00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:55.480
impossible right off the bat,

48
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.030
you never pay commissions or account fees for everything.

49
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.030
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for

50
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:05.710
free.
If you use my link,

51
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.060
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim that is less than $5 a month to invest a

52
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:12.490
$30,000 account for instance.
Now,

53
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:16.030
normally when I have a sponsor on this show is because I use them and recommend

54
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:17.680
them.
In this case,
it's a little different.

55
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.000
I don't use wealth front yet because I'm not allowed to.
Here's the deal.

56
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.260
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of SCC regulations,

57
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.920
companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials.

58
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:32.740
So I couldn't be a user and have them on the podcast,

59
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.850
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant

60
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:40.690
amount of my own money,
at least for me,
uh,
in the team and the company itself.

61
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.810
So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client.

62
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.320
Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

63
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:51.190
you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account.

64
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.220
But just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you.

65
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.390
Take two minutes,
fill out their questionnaire@wealthfront.com forward slash.
Tim,

66
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.410
it's fast,
it's free.
There's no downside that I can think of.
Walk,

67
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.250
walk,
a walk.
I use Sochi savages.

68
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:09.070
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

69
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:11.890
it is my job to deconstruct world class performers,

70
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:15.370
whether they are from the worlds of chess,
entertainment,
military politics,

71
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.480
athletics,
business or otherwise.
And this episode is a fun one.

72
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.690
It took place in my home on my couch with tea and it involves lessons from

73
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:32.521
Tinker's geniuses and billionaires and the interviewee is Chris Young and we

74
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:37.210
talk about quite a few things,
what he's learned from people like Bill Gates,

75
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.080
Nathan Myhrvold and perhaps a name you don't recognize,

76
00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:46.081
but in many ways the most impressive to me self made billionaire Gabe Newell and

77
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:47.410
if you don't know who he is,

78
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.590
you should learn all about it and we will get into it.
Neal Stephenson,

79
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.480
the science fiction author,

80
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:55.750
although saying it that way doesn't do justice to the work that he puts out,

81
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:59.470
which is incredible snow crash and so on.

82
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.310
We'll touch on that and questions above all,

83
00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:05.410
we focus on good questions.

84
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.060
We focus on better thinking and we focus on,
for instance,

85
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.660
how geniuses and people who run,
for instance,

86
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:17.620
the number one ranked restaurant in the world,
express disappointment,

87
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:20.770
how do they express disappointment and ensure that you correct yourself.

88
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.640
How has Chris managed to get jobs working for some of these people who are the

89
00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:29.110
best in the world despite no credentials at the time that he got the jobs and

90
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:32.800
how do you of course create apocalyptic barbecue is very important.
Question.

91
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.470
We'll get into that and a risk having the entire neighborhood burned down.

92
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.510
I don't recommend you do that.
Of course.
I would never suggest such a thing,

93
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.810
but the story makes for a good time and we're going to get into it.

94
00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:48.811
So please enjoy this wide ranging conversation with Chris Young and we'll take

95
00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:53.140
you from extreme aviation and world record goals to mathematics,

96
00:05:53.141 --> 00:05:58.120
biochemistry and everything in between.
So fuck it.

97
00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.370
I left myself with no out on this one.
Enjoy.

98
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.900
Christopher,
welcome to the show.
Thanks Tim.
Excited to be here.
Yeah,
man.
Cool.

99
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.260
It's been a not too,
too long since we've hung out.

100
00:06:10.261 --> 00:06:15.210
I mean we saw each other in Seattle and uh,
that was sands.

101
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.140
Matt Mullenweg.
Yes.
I'm actually impress you remember any of that?

102
00:06:19.141 --> 00:06:24.130
There was a bit of drinking,
well not to,
uh,
not to point fingers,

103
00:06:24.131 --> 00:06:27.250
but I'd say whenever we hang out there's always some form of drinking.

104
00:06:27.251 --> 00:06:31.060
This seems to sneak in.
It might be a chef thing,
might be a chef thing.

105
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.690
But before we get to the chef thing,
and I suppose this is related,

106
00:06:34.691 --> 00:06:39.691
but you have a myriad of obsessions that that strikes me as interesting and

107
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:40.851
we're going to get to this.

108
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:45.320
But since we were talking about the drinking and Seattle one,

109
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.860
that particular incident that I thought was very telling of your personality and

110
00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:53.861
kind of Hilarious was this dinner that we had for a few people who had won

111
00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:58.010
prizes to be brought to Seattle to have this incredible dinner.

112
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.030
And there was a family with a bunch of kids and the mom was talking about making

113
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:06.130
smoothies.
And uh,
just as before we started recording,
I said,

114
00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:09.070
you don't need to feel that.
You have to censor yourself.

115
00:07:09.071 --> 00:07:10.480
Not that that's what you do anyway.

116
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.270
And I just remember after she had finished this,
like heartfelt,

117
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.000
a description of her,
her smoothies,
vegetable smoothies,
you said,
well,
you know,

118
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.410
vegetables are trying to kill you.

119
00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:25.900
And you went into this diatribe about,
uh,
vegetables.

120
00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:28.990
Can you elaborate on why,
why that is the case?

121
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.550
<v 3>Sure.
Um,
so the,
the idea,
I think I probably said something to the effect of,</v>

122
00:07:34.551 --> 00:07:37.890
you know,
uh,
salads,
a silent killer,
which salads,
right?

123
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.350
Which is actually not originally my idea.
It's uh,
the,
the great food writer,

124
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:45.720
Jeffrey Steingarten had a,
had a brilliant article about this.
Um,

125
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.210
but anybody who has sort of a biology background,

126
00:07:49.211 --> 00:07:50.980
this makes some intuitive sense.

127
00:07:50.981 --> 00:07:55.640
It's just one of these things we don't stop to think about.
If you're a plant,

128
00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:01.350
like you're not looking to get eaten.
Like that's not a good outcome for you.

129
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.810
Uh,
and so you,
you can't run.

130
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.650
So you do all sorts of things to evolve some protection against all these

131
00:08:07.651 --> 00:08:09.420
predators running around trying to eat you.

132
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.930
So it turns out if you're stuck in the ground and you can't run,

133
00:08:12.931 --> 00:08:17.040
you're going to evolve this really elaborate chemical weapons system that when a

134
00:08:17.041 --> 00:08:22.041
pass or a disease or a critter basically starts to gnaw on your routes are non

135
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.510
your stocks or non your leaves,

136
00:08:24.511 --> 00:08:27.060
none of which are the part that you want to have eaten,

137
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.670
you're going to try to poison them.
Um,

138
00:08:29.671 --> 00:08:33.810
and so a whole bunch of things like fava beans,
you know,
if you eat them raw,

139
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.770
people die every year from eating too many raw fava beans.
Uh,

140
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:40.710
apple seeds have trace amounts of,
of cyanide,

141
00:08:40.711 --> 00:08:44.010
not enough to be an issue for a human,
but for Pash.
Sure.

142
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:48.170
Even when a fruit bruises and it sort of turns that unsightly brown,

143
00:08:48.171 --> 00:08:52.970
that's a cascading enzymatic chemical reaction designed to create a bunch of

144
00:08:52.971 --> 00:08:55.380
molecular compounds that prevent spoilage.

145
00:08:55.381 --> 00:09:00.210
So there's all these people that think eating raw vegetables is like this

146
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:04.890
inherently healthy,
somehow more pure act of eating.
And it's like,
no,

147
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:09.090
you're eating mostly a bunch of toxins and poisons and things that they may not

148
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.940
affect you because you're a pretty large mammal.

149
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.130
But mostly they're not that great for you.

150
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:18.420
Like spinach I think was the example I use that people think of pop by and that

151
00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:21.780
you get all this iron from spinach.
Like it's part myth.

152
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:25.350
There's just not that much iron in spinach compared to many other plant foods.

153
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.370
But also raw spinach contains a ton of oxalic acid,

154
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:32.730
which actually binds iron.
So people eat a lot of raw spinach,

155
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:37.220
they end up with an iron deficiency.
And that's what produces that sort of a,

156
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:41.430
not cotton mouth feel.
But that's um,
you know,

157
00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:46.230
Spanish is very mild in this.
But,
uh,
a sorrel,
which is a,
is a relative.

158
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.130
It has this,
this prickly,
uh,
if you've ever eaten rhubarb,

159
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.500
rhubarb is very high in it.
And if you raw rhubarb,

160
00:09:52.501 --> 00:09:55.380
that hasn't been cooked down in a bunch of sugar with a bunch of jammy

161
00:09:55.381 --> 00:10:00.240
strawberries,
um,
it's a pleasant vegetable,
but it's,

162
00:10:00.241 --> 00:10:02.670
it's not as amazing as people think it is.

163
00:10:02.671 --> 00:10:06.200
And it also can leave you with this cottony mouth,
especially if you'd at Rha,

164
00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.540
which,
which I remember doing as a kid and it wasn't,
wasn't that great.

165
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.360
Now imagine in the same bucket you have,
uh,

166
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.770
now some of these might be from lagoons or otherwise,
but,
uh,
fight,

167
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:20.810
fighting acid and sapping pins and all these various kidney beans are another

168
00:10:22.141 --> 00:10:25.380
thing where you really need to cook them in an actually your best throwing out

169
00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:28.320
the water.
You Cook them in one,
you know,

170
00:10:28.321 --> 00:10:32.040
you're gonna Fart a bunch less because you're basically diluting down a lot of

171
00:10:32.041 --> 00:10:34.080
the illegal saccharides rides that you can't digest.

172
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.400
But also you're tending to a dispense with,
uh,

173
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.300
some of the more water soluble compounds that aren't very good for us.

174
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.230
So the science,
you bring a lot of science to the table.

175
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.100
Take me through getting to math and biochemistry.

176
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.830
Uh,
did that come before or after food and cooking?

177
00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.910
It certainly came well before professionally doing it.
Um,

178
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.120
the cooking thing was something I always did as a kid.

179
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.380
It was just not the kind of thing that somebody growing up in the seventies and

180
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.640
eighties was like,
oh,
that's a good career choice.
Like,
no,

181
00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:13.170
like growing up in the like aspirational,
middle,
middle class,

182
00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:15.720
like becoming a chef was not a good career choice.

183
00:11:15.721 --> 00:11:17.460
You were not encouraged in that direction.

184
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.720
And like late 1980s heartland America science I think was always interesting to

185
00:11:23.281 --> 00:11:25.950
me.
Um,
it was stuff that I gravitated towards,

186
00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:30.330
but it wasn't the kind of thing that I had a natural aptitude to be quite
honest.

187
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.330
Taking math for example,
um,

188
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.860
the highest grade I think I got in a mathematics class all the way up through

189
00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:42.861
high school was a c minus I think partly because I had a chip on my shoulder

190
00:11:43.351 --> 00:11:44.090
about it.
And,

191
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:49.080
and partly because mathematics as it existed at the university level,

192
00:11:49.081 --> 00:11:53.410
once you got beyond like the weed out classes like that bear no resemblance to

193
00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:58.411
what I had seen throughout high school and junior high and elementary school.

194
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.310
Uh,
and so I think I partly got the degree to be able to say,
see,

195
00:12:03.311 --> 00:12:05.110
it really was the teacher's not me.

196
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.080
And partly because I actually discovered it was,

197
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.800
it was actually really elegant and fun and interesting because you were sort of

198
00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:16.330
playing these mental games of like what would the world be like if volume no

199
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:19.640
longer has a physical meaning and stuff like that.
Uh,

200
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:24.660
so I sort of took university in a very indirect approach where I just took

201
00:12:25.341 --> 00:12:28.250
things that were interesting to me or I took them because their particular

202
00:12:28.251 --> 00:12:31.850
professor was teaching them and that that person was always interesting in doing

203
00:12:31.851 --> 00:12:36.080
cool as shit.
It happened to be that like after seven years.

204
00:12:36.081 --> 00:12:37.220
And I kind of looked around and said like,

205
00:12:37.221 --> 00:12:39.140
what do I have enough to have a degree?
And it was like,

206
00:12:39.141 --> 00:12:42.770
oh well I kind of have enough to have a degree in pure mathematics and I kind of

207
00:12:42.771 --> 00:12:47.420
have enough to have a degree in biochemistry and I kind of have enough to sort

208
00:12:47.421 --> 00:12:49.130
of have a degree in history.
And so I

209
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.660
<v 2>maybe I should apply for those historical mathematical biochemistry,</v>

210
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:56.920
something like that.
What was your first Gig out of college?

211
00:12:56.921 --> 00:13:00.160
And it always strikes me when I'm having these conversations with friends.

212
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.180
It gives me an excuse to ask like the 20 questions.

213
00:13:03.181 --> 00:13:07.590
It would seem utterly weird and creepy if I did it in like a normal conversation

214
00:13:07.591 --> 00:13:12.090
over wine.
But I have no idea.
Like what was your first job out of college cook?

215
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:17.030
<v 3>So how like that that happened,
how's that happen?
Um,</v>

216
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:19.760
so this goes back to to,
you know,

217
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:25.010
the year 2000 and I was starting to pursue a phd and what I or what I hoped

218
00:13:27.351 --> 00:13:31.290
would turn into a phd in an area called bio molecular structure and design.

219
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:36.360
So specifically it's sort of tied together mathematics and Physical Chemistry

220
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.230
and cancer research and computers in a,

221
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:43.050
in a whole bunch of stuff I was kind of sort of interested in.
Um,

222
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.370
but I also sort of,

223
00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:49.450
I had like a whole bunch of chaos going on in my life with crazy girlfriends,
uh,

224
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.030
one in particular.
So like,
you know,

225
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.510
academically I was getting burned out and in the meantime,

226
00:13:54.511 --> 00:13:59.511
my personal life was sort of cratering in a super awkward and painful kind of

227
00:13:59.641 --> 00:14:00.474
way.

228
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:05.030
And I remember somewhere around September,

229
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.570
October,
2001,
so after September 11th,

230
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.720
I just remember like my life totally imploded,

231
00:14:11.721 --> 00:14:15.410
like in the course of about a week where like things were going really poorly

232
00:14:15.411 --> 00:14:19.190
for my research.
Um,
my,
the,
the,
uh,

233
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.970
the principal investigator on the project it was at was really like,

234
00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.680
just pleased with my work.
And part of that was I,

235
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.920
I'd made some bad choices about the project and part of it was like I was

236
00:14:29.921 --> 00:14:32.980
completely distracted about what was imploding in my personal life.

237
00:14:32.981 --> 00:14:36.870
And so it was just sort of one of these,
fuck it,
I'm going to walk away from it,

238
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.770
um,
with no clear idea of what the hell I'm going to do.

239
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.550
And I'd always cooked.

240
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.430
Like I enjoyed cooking and I was reading a bunch of,
uh,

241
00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:51.500
I was actually cooking my way through the French laundry cookbook and I was

242
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:56.300
diving into Harold McGee,
both of which I discovered around that time in a while.

243
00:14:56.301 --> 00:14:59.870
That's the science of cooking.
No,
yeah.
Uh,
the,
the,
the,
uh,

244
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:03.050
and food in cooking the science and lower of the kitchen on food.

245
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.350
And so like that book was fascinating to me.
It was just like,

246
00:15:06.351 --> 00:15:08.360
this stuff is so awesome.
How did,
you know?

247
00:15:08.361 --> 00:15:11.480
And I was one of those books I just discovered randomly browsing at Barnes and

248
00:15:11.481 --> 00:15:14.390
noble and it was like find,
yeah,
it was just like this thing is cool.

249
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.480
And just as a quick pause for people who've seen the four hour chef video,

250
00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:23.870
like the book trailer,
the movie trailer,
we shot it at chef steps,

251
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:28.310
which is in Seattle,
uh,
which,
which uh,
which Chris has is certainly a strong,

252
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.320
heavily involved with this.
At least we'll get into it.

253
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.980
But the placeholder that we used for the four hour chef book,

254
00:15:33.981 --> 00:15:37.640
because we put it in in post production was Harold's book.
Harold's book.
Yup.

255
00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.800
It's about the right size.
Yeah.
It was perfect science.

256
00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:42.980
So like all of this stuff was going on and it was like,

257
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:47.780
I have no idea what I'm going to do.
I'm basically walking away from my,

258
00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.700
from my,

259
00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:53.690
my grant funding and like I've got to get my head back together because of a bad

260
00:15:53.691 --> 00:15:54.440
relationship.

261
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:59.390
And so I just decided like I enjoy cooking so I'm going to get a job as a chef

262
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.850
while I figured out what the Hell I'm going to do with my life.

263
00:16:01.851 --> 00:16:05.150
Like that was kind of as far as the master plan went at that point.

264
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:10.730
And so like I wrote letters to all of these chefs that had restaurants that as

265
00:16:10.731 --> 00:16:14.600
far as I could tell were kind of important restaurants in Seattle with like my

266
00:16:14.601 --> 00:16:18.080
academic CV being like,
I am looking for a job.

267
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:23.210
And remarkably like some of them actually called me back,
I think mostly to see,

268
00:16:23.211 --> 00:16:27.620
like if I was having a laugh,
um,
which of my friends is pranking me,

269
00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:32.810
basically,
it was like,
Ooh,
this ought to be good for a laugh.
And um,
it was,

270
00:16:32.811 --> 00:16:33.644
uh,

271
00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:38.780
it was a chef named Tim Kelly at the painted table who called me up on a Friday

272
00:16:39.201 --> 00:16:42.560
and he was like,
I got your letter and you know,

273
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:45.350
now is not really a good time for you to come work for me at the painting table.

274
00:16:45.351 --> 00:16:48.590
Like he quit the next day,
but I have this friend,

275
00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:53.190
a bill Bilikiss he cooked for David Boulay.
He with your science background,

276
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.350
you and him would probably get on great.

277
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.860
You should call him up and tell him that I sent you and don't take no for a

278
00:16:57.861 --> 00:17:01.460
fucking answer.
Just show up with your knives and start uh,
start cooking for him.

279
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.870
So like I called William Blake or something like a Tim Kelly said,

280
00:17:05.871 --> 00:17:10.820
I should call you and definitely come work with you.
And I,
he's like,

281
00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.250
this was a Friday.
He's like,
great,
when can you be here?

282
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:16.430
This was when I really realized like he just needed anyone who was willing to

283
00:17:16.431 --> 00:17:20.870
work for free.
Um,
so I showed up at three o'clock with,

284
00:17:20.871 --> 00:17:22.640
with like I had gotten a knife bag,

285
00:17:22.641 --> 00:17:27.440
I had a couple of knives at that point they were like reasonably sharp and like

286
00:17:27.441 --> 00:17:31.160
they immediately put me to work doing some really menial like pick a bunch of

287
00:17:31.161 --> 00:17:31.994
time,

288
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:36.830
cut down some shard and like I apparently did it mostly right.

289
00:17:36.831 --> 00:17:41.470
I was just incredibly slow and at the end of service,
like,

290
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.870
you know,
William was really gracious.
He sat down with me in the dining room.

291
00:17:44.871 --> 00:17:48.260
He had a glass of wine,
he offered me a glass of wine and he's like,
you know,

292
00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:52.830
now's probably not really a great time.
Not sure I have all the work for you.

293
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.700
And like being very earnest.
Um,
I was,
I was like,

294
00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.050
I totally understand.

295
00:17:59.051 --> 00:18:01.900
Is there anybody in town you'd recommend would be a good place for me to work?

296
00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.060
I'm really,
I'm really like committed to doing this.

297
00:18:04.061 --> 00:18:05.320
I really want to see what it's about.

298
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.540
And what I didn't realize at the time was like,

299
00:18:07.541 --> 00:18:10.360
that was probably the perfect thing to have said to William because William had

300
00:18:10.361 --> 00:18:14.320
an enormous ego and he was just not going to be capable of bringing himself to

301
00:18:14.321 --> 00:18:18.100
say anybody else in town was any good at all.
And so he,

302
00:18:18.101 --> 00:18:22.860
you could just see him sort of sputtering and well,
yeah.
Really,

303
00:18:22.861 --> 00:18:26.370
there's no one like,
I think I'm probably the right person to teach you,

304
00:18:26.371 --> 00:18:31.371
so why don't you come back on Tuesday and an accidental Jedi mind trick.

305
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.590
Yeah,
that was the,
that was the accidental Jedi mind trick.

306
00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:35.610
And then it was just like,

307
00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:40.410
I showed up and I kept showing up and like I didn't get paid for while,

308
00:18:40.411 --> 00:18:45.000
so my credit card was getting obliterated.
But that's how I got into it.

309
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.570
And I discovered that professional cooking is really a mental illness.

310
00:18:48.571 --> 00:18:53.450
You either have it or you don't.
And like within months I was like,

311
00:18:53.451 --> 00:18:56.120
I have to do this.
There isn't really a choice.

312
00:18:56.121 --> 00:18:58.370
And that we were off to the races you're gonna have.

313
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.250
That's like the coping mechanism.
That was totally my coping mechanism.

314
00:19:01.251 --> 00:19:06.230
It like trip played into all of my introverted antisocial behaviors to basically

315
00:19:06.231 --> 00:19:09.860
like lock myself up on a Friday and a Saturday and the kitchen because like,

316
00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.990
I could feel like I was out and socializing,

317
00:19:11.991 --> 00:19:15.530
but I didn't actually have to be out in socializing.
So it was great.

318
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:19.340
And like that,
the next eight years,
we're a cultural black hole for me.

319
00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:22.270
<v 2>So we're going to,</v>

320
00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:26.450
we're going to jump around as is my want to sort of create a podcast.

321
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.800
It's hard to follow as Momento.
Uh,

322
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.540
I want to talk about just paint,

323
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:37.340
paint a visual picture for people because we flash forward quite,
uh,
quite a,
uh,

324
00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:38.743
quite a long ways.

325
00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:43.740
Talk to me about the massive pigs rotating around a fire.
No,

326
00:19:43.741 --> 00:19:47.000
it's fire rotating around a pig.
Can you explain the spectacle?

327
00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:51.900
The people please just provide some and,
and how that came to be.
So,

328
00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.110
<v 3>uh,
I'll try to explain the spectacle and then I'll try to give the,</v>

329
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.450
why do we do these shenanigans?

330
00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:01.790
So essentially there's the concept of like rotating meet and usually you rotate

331
00:20:01.791 --> 00:20:06.160
the animal in front of the fire and what you're doing is actually solving a very

332
00:20:06.161 --> 00:20:07.330
pragmatic problem,

333
00:20:07.331 --> 00:20:12.331
which is you have this big giant pig shaped object and the fire can bring heat

334
00:20:12.821 --> 00:20:15.790
to the surface much,
much faster than that.

335
00:20:15.791 --> 00:20:18.550
Heat can diffuse and percolate through the meat itself.

336
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.710
And every sort of weekend warrior bad cook has experienced this problem at some

337
00:20:23.711 --> 00:20:26.680
point where like you char the outside and the inside is still raw,

338
00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.620
black and blue.
And if you do something the size of a large animal,

339
00:20:29.621 --> 00:20:32.950
like that phenomenon is exacerbated exponentially.

340
00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:37.620
And so by rotating in at what you do is you bring a bunch of fire to one side

341
00:20:37.621 --> 00:20:40.530
and it starts heating up and then before it overcooked you rotate it into the

342
00:20:40.531 --> 00:20:44.160
shadows where it rests and the heat diffuses through an over sort of this dizzy

343
00:20:44.161 --> 00:20:47.590
number of cycles.
You sort of time average the temperature.

344
00:20:47.591 --> 00:20:50.890
So you get a crispy surface and an edge to edge evenly cooked animal.

345
00:20:50.891 --> 00:20:52.290
And we call this like rotisserie.

346
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:55.690
It turns out the physics are totally symmetrical,

347
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.910
that you can rotate the animal in front of fire,

348
00:20:57.911 --> 00:21:00.460
but you could also rotate the fire around the animal.

349
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:05.770
And aside from the idea that that's just sort of appealing on its own merits,

350
00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:10.180
it actually solves some practical purposes that like by forcing wood or coal

351
00:21:10.181 --> 00:21:11.560
around really,
really rapidly,

352
00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:14.860
you're forcing a bunch of air through it and air drives the combustion faster.

353
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.770
And so the coals get hotter and the hotter they get,

354
00:21:17.771 --> 00:21:18.970
the more intense like they glow.

355
00:21:18.971 --> 00:21:22.990
And because you're dealing with radiant heat and radiant heat sort of goes by

356
00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:25.870
the fourth power of the temperature.
The hotter you can get it,

357
00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:30.580
like the more intense the seer and the more just radiate a radiant energy you're

358
00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:33.310
dumping out and everybody gets a Suntan and it's just awesome.

359
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:38.650
And you're flinging coal everywhere and bits of fire and like dogs are hiding

360
00:21:38.651 --> 00:21:40.810
and children are like running around and it,

361
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:43.570
it's this post apocalyptic wasteland,

362
00:21:43.571 --> 00:21:48.250
kind of like Mad Max just came through and charged some animals.
So like,

363
00:21:48.251 --> 00:21:52.750
why wouldn't you do this?
And is there a name for this?

364
00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:57.070
What does a well,
so this was the inverted rotisserie spit.
Um,

365
00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.130
and how much space does this,
well,
the first one,

366
00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.870
which I think is the one you've seen some of the photos of had these two columns

367
00:22:04.871 --> 00:22:08.940
that were eight feet tall stuffed with anthracite coal that we,

368
00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:14.050
that's a whole story in itself of how you get anthracite coal.
And you know,

369
00:22:14.051 --> 00:22:19.051
they were spinning around at about 36 RPM on a cement mixer base around a pig

370
00:22:19.841 --> 00:22:21.610
that was sort of vertically suspended.

371
00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.880
It had been spatchcocked in half and was vertically suspended.

372
00:22:24.881 --> 00:22:27.770
And so it's sort of a great word.
That one his spatchcock yeah,

373
00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:32.530
it's just flayed open on this sort of medieval like torture device and we're

374
00:22:32.531 --> 00:22:36.800
spinning this fire around it at,
um,
kind of looks like a dissected pig.
Yeah.

375
00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:38.830
I'm not a pig.
Well that's definitely,
it doesn't look a pig,

376
00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:43.620
but dissect what's your frog like sort of split open and less flat and,

377
00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.890
and you've got the fire rotating around it really rapidly.
Um,

378
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:51.070
that was actually my friend Neil Stevenson's backyard.

379
00:22:51.071 --> 00:22:54.490
And this is the annual tradition and I'll come back cause there's the origin

380
00:22:54.491 --> 00:22:57.580
story part to this.
So footnote,
yeah.

381
00:22:57.581 --> 00:23:02.581
Later Reference Neal Stephenson of snow crash cryptonomic on Seveneves a whole

382
00:23:03.791 --> 00:23:06.580
bunch of other stuff that I haven't read.
Yeah.
Um,

383
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.430
so if I read more of his stuff than you have,

384
00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:12.760
I've only read one of his book and it's his most recent one because gliding

385
00:23:12.761 --> 00:23:16.360
features in it and I'm the reason how it,
okay,
we'll come back to that.
So,
okay.

386
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.850
Can,
anyway,
that's also how I met Gabe Newell.
Um,

387
00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:22.510
well this is the second time I met Gabe.
I'd Cook a dinner for gay,

388
00:23:22.511 --> 00:23:26.920
but that was kind of it.
And Gay was at that party,
saw this spectacle and goes,

389
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:31.860
well that's fucking awesome.
So we totally need to do that at my house,
um,

390
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:35.800
for our Christmas solstice party.
But can you make it bigger?

391
00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:40.000
And so for Gabes House,
we scaled it up.
Um,
two stories tall.

392
00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:43.330
We had a chain of Hams and pineapples hanging off this,
uh,

393
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.600
this giant IBM and Gantry Crane and I think it was about 20 foot tall columns

394
00:23:49.581 --> 00:23:53.690
that were spinning around this thing and that was called the tornado of fire.

395
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:56.530
So,
all right.

396
00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.280
I've decided that this podcast is more like the movie snatch than Memento.

397
00:24:01.281 --> 00:24:04.610
All right,
so like the cast of characters.
Uh,

398
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.930
so we have voiced the bullet dodged.
All right.
So Gabe Newell.
Yep.

399
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.300
Gabe is man of few words,

400
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:15.750
self made billionaire collection of thousands of knives.
I believe it.

401
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.490
It's an enormous collection.
I don't know how Mary,

402
00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:22.970
we'll we'll get back to Gabe later because I want to leave that as a teaser.

403
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:27.410
So origin.
Yeah.
So I met Neal Stephenson,

404
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:31.430
uh,
when I was working with Nathan Myhrvold at his invention lab intellectual

405
00:24:31.431 --> 00:24:33.560
ventures.
That's where we were writing modernist cuisine.

406
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:38.270
And Nathan had just founded a lab that was supposed to like invent cool shit.

407
00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:42.800
And so like this Guy Neal Stephenson showed up who apparently is really famous,

408
00:24:42.801 --> 00:24:46.490
but I had no idea who he was and I would like sit next to him.

409
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:50.300
And I remember coming by being like,
cause I was,

410
00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.000
this was like the first book I was running,

411
00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.020
I was trying to figure out how to be like a writer.

412
00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:56.390
And so I remember coming up to him and be like,

413
00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.520
I understand you're a writer or something.
He's like,

414
00:24:58.521 --> 00:25:00.410
I understand you're a chef or something.

415
00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:05.440
And that was kind of the basis for our friendship is like neither of us cared

416
00:25:05.691 --> 00:25:08.300
about it.
I'm like our background.
And so,

417
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:11.360
but we did enjoy drinking a bunch of of English Ale and we,

418
00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:16.160
I'd sit over at his house and,
and just chat with him.
And he had bought,
uh,

419
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:17.870
just had bought a new house.

420
00:25:17.871 --> 00:25:22.100
It was like this sort of mock tutor mansion that sits on Lake Washington.

421
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.780
And every summer,
the first weekend in August in Seattle,
we have seafair weekend,

422
00:25:26.781 --> 00:25:27.500
we're like,

423
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:31.040
it's fleet week and there's a bunch of jet boat races in the blue angels come

424
00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:34.550
down.
And this basically all happens right over Neal's house.

425
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:39.320
And Neil's this very quiet,
introverted likes things,

426
00:25:39.321 --> 00:25:42.140
very mellow kind of guy.
And he's like,
well,

427
00:25:42.141 --> 00:25:46.250
since basically the entire neighborhood is going to be terrorized for a weekend,

428
00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:49.100
we might as well just make a party out of that.
And so he,

429
00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:54.340
he coined the idea of having an annual loudness fest and that year he was

430
00:25:55.131 --> 00:25:58.040
redoing his backyard.
So it,
his backyard sorta looked like this,

431
00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.980
looked like Beirut after like a,

432
00:25:59.981 --> 00:26:02.750
a surgical airstrike had just happened to his yard.

433
00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:08.290
So it wasn't like a big deal that we dug a six foot by six foot by six foot deep

434
00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:13.270
pit in his backyard and turned it into a Jacuzzi to,
to,
to sue.

435
00:26:13.271 --> 00:26:18.271
We'd cook a 300 pound pig and like each year after that for the next five years,

436
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.180
like each year had to be like more over the top,
more outlandish,

437
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:25.760
more ludicrously dangerous,
um,

438
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.760
dangerous in the sense of maybe the neighbor's houses will burn down.

439
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.880
Maybe somebody will be killed by spalling concrete.

440
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:35.780
Maybe somebody will just be burned as centers because like we're cooking with

441
00:26:35.781 --> 00:26:38.480
magma.
Um,
that kind of thing.

442
00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:42.750
Neil is a surprisingly fit dude.
I mean,
because you think writer,

443
00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:46.200
you think entry but true,

444
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:50.320
true or false till actually,
no,
I'll let you tell the story.
So,

445
00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:52.830
and I have to have him on the blog at some point,

446
00:26:52.831 --> 00:26:56.040
but he does Victorian era exercises.

447
00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:00.720
That is what I have.
He does that.
And he does,
uh,

448
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:04.950
various forms of what he calls Western martial arts involving sword fighting

449
00:27:04.951 --> 00:27:08.640
where they really try to accurately recreate the way it was,

450
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:13.670
would have been done on what I understand is fairly limited information.

451
00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:16.050
And so,
uh,

452
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:20.430
yeah know Neil I think takes physical fitness like absurdly seriously.

453
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.080
Um,
and so it,
it's,

454
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:26.520
it's one of the things that makes him like just awesome and interesting as a

455
00:27:26.521 --> 00:27:28.500
person to hang around with.
Have you,

456
00:27:28.501 --> 00:27:33.420
would think of him as this overly nerdy Scifi writer and like that's totally

457
00:27:33.421 --> 00:27:35.850
true.
He's a huge nerd.
Um,

458
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:40.050
but he's also fascinated by all of these physical activities.

459
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:45.620
What did your path look like from the cooking job that you last described to

460
00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:51.690
Heston Blumenthal?
That was a very,
very short hop,
um,
and a very lucky one.

461
00:27:51.691 --> 00:27:55.470
But what is an appreciate is when I started working for Heston,

462
00:27:55.471 --> 00:27:59.700
nobody had really heard of Heston.
Um,
so can you paint a picture of sure.

463
00:27:59.701 --> 00:28:03.710
Test and maybe at that,
I dunno if it's today,
um,

464
00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:08.220
you know,
Heston is a world famous chef and rightly so,

465
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.840
more famous outside of the u s I think that inside the u s but,
um,

466
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:17.940
he's arguably the most famous chef except for maybe Gordon Ramsey or Jamie

467
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.690
Oliver,
but certainly at that same level in the United Kingdom and Australia,

468
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:25.950
there would be no modernist cuisine without Heston.
There would be,

469
00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:28.380
frankly no noma without Heston.

470
00:28:28.381 --> 00:28:32.220
Heston was really the Oma considered the best Freshdesk the world on the day.
So,

471
00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:34.950
you know,
there's this,
uh,
you know,

472
00:28:34.951 --> 00:28:39.690
the fat duck is basically that restaurant between Elbulli in the early two

473
00:28:39.691 --> 00:28:43.890
thousands and,
and noma a really starting in the,
in the,

474
00:28:43.891 --> 00:28:46.350
in the last six or seven years.
In fact,

475
00:28:46.351 --> 00:28:50.010
Renee went to through the fat duck kitchens and the El Bulli kitchens.
Um,

476
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.240
so the,
the path for me was,
was actually a pretty straight forward,

477
00:28:54.241 --> 00:28:57.330
I think after about nine months of cooking in Seattle,

478
00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:02.220
it was a very small,
a high end restaurant.
Not terribly busy,

479
00:29:02.221 --> 00:29:04.260
but it was small in the sense of very few people on staff.

480
00:29:04.261 --> 00:29:05.520
There's about four or five of us.

481
00:29:05.521 --> 00:29:08.040
And so the good news was like you had to do everything,

482
00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:12.630
which is fantastic when you are trying to learn to be a cook because I had no

483
00:29:12.631 --> 00:29:13.321
formal training.

484
00:29:13.321 --> 00:29:16.760
It was like it was all on the job and in a bigger restaurant you,

485
00:29:16.761 --> 00:29:20.010
you sort of compartmentalize down and you can spend a year just doing the same

486
00:29:20.011 --> 00:29:24.690
stuff over and over.
Um,
it's like any startup.
Right,
right.
And so,

487
00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.520
you know,
by being a small,

488
00:29:26.521 --> 00:29:29.280
a small restaurant that was just trying to stay afloat,

489
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:31.740
like you did everything and there wasn't time to think of,

490
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:33.960
for anyone to think about whether you should be doing that.

491
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:37.590
But by the end of nine or maybe 10 months,

492
00:29:37.591 --> 00:29:42.330
I had realized I was really not going to learn anything more.
Here I,

493
00:29:42.331 --> 00:29:47.331
I'd sort of maxed out the learning curve and around that time my goal,

494
00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.530
you know,
you'd maxed out the learning curve.

495
00:29:50.531 --> 00:29:52.630
What were the symptoms of that boredom?

496
00:29:52.631 --> 00:29:57.520
I think on a certain level of I was doing,
I was finding myself repetitive.

497
00:29:57.521 --> 00:30:01.480
I was finding like I'd set little tasks for myself at that time,

498
00:30:01.481 --> 00:30:03.360
like if it was shallots,
um,

499
00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:07.360
and I had to get through a bunch of Bruin and had to get a box of five very fine

500
00:30:07.361 --> 00:30:11.170
dice.
If I had to get that done,
I would try to time it.
It,
you know,

501
00:30:11.171 --> 00:30:15.400
be able to do a shallot is flawless as I could and say 10 seconds,

502
00:30:15.401 --> 00:30:17.620
a salad or a whole box in 15 minutes or,

503
00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:21.940
and I realized like those games weren't really that interested anymore because I

504
00:30:21.941 --> 00:30:26.520
wasn't able to advance and it was about as fast as I was going to get.
Um,

505
00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:31.150
or I was repeating them over and over and there weren't new challenges.
Um,

506
00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:36.070
and I also found myself struggling with,
with,
uh,

507
00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:36.851
with,

508
00:30:36.851 --> 00:30:40.600
with William because I was wanting to push to do more or to try new things on

509
00:30:40.601 --> 00:30:44.560
the menu.
And you know,
he was really pushing back in,
in retrospect,

510
00:30:44.561 --> 00:30:48.010
I realized those were the,
those were actually just the limits of that business.

511
00:30:48.011 --> 00:30:49.810
They couldn't take more on,

512
00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:54.580
they couldn't afford to do necessarily more ambitious things.
Um,
you know,

513
00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:59.050
his job was to keep the lights on and make sure he was,
was balancing the bills.

514
00:30:59.051 --> 00:31:02.230
And that's a very,
really hard challenge in any restaurant.

515
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:06.970
And so that was sort of,
to me,
the signal of I need to move on somewhere.

516
00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:11.410
There was a bunch of other stuff going on.
I think in the background of I,

517
00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:15.190
I'd gotten a book from Michelle Brock called essential cuisine that came out

518
00:31:15.191 --> 00:31:19.460
that year and in English essential essential cuisine,
Michel Bra,

519
00:31:19.461 --> 00:31:22.510
who was a three star chef in Europe.

520
00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:25.900
And I think if you talked to a lot of chefs that came up in the early two

521
00:31:25.901 --> 00:31:28.720
thousands will all point to that,
especially at the high end.

522
00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.830
We'll all point to that book is being like,
Holy Fuck,
what was this like?

523
00:31:32.831 --> 00:31:36.760
Nobody had seen Phil the last be Ras,
the Ras,

524
00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:40.270
and you just,
I remember looking at it being like,

525
00:31:40.271 --> 00:31:42.970
I don't know anybody in Seattle doing food that looks anything.

526
00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:46.120
I don't know if anybody anywhere doing food that looks like this,
you know?

527
00:31:46.121 --> 00:31:49.840
And I thought about wanting to go cook at that restaurant,
but a,

528
00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:52.900
I didn't think I was remotely good enough.
And B,

529
00:31:52.901 --> 00:31:55.990
I didn't speak any French so that wasn't going to make it any easier.

530
00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.840
But it had me thinking about I needed to move on,

531
00:31:58.841 --> 00:32:01.420
I needed to see more and I knew I wasn't seeing this,

532
00:32:01.421 --> 00:32:02.760
this kind of stuff here and,
and,

533
00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:07.030
and so how did I know it was time to leave there was realizing that I wasn't

534
00:32:07.031 --> 00:32:10.390
really getting any better learning new skills in the restaurant,

535
00:32:10.391 --> 00:32:14.170
but also because I was like all of my disposable income was going into buying

536
00:32:14.171 --> 00:32:16.540
more cookbooks.
I was realizing what I wasn't seeing.

537
00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:20.050
You're seeing the give me the big,
the big hedge on text of the world.

538
00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.560
And so about that time for Christmas,

539
00:32:23.561 --> 00:32:25.660
actually my girlfriend,

540
00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:30.720
her mother gave me an anthology of food writing in 2002 and there was an article

541
00:32:31.481 --> 00:32:36.481
and it called the gastro naughts and it was talking about this conference in

542
00:32:36.551 --> 00:32:40.670
Italy that chefs and scientists got together and we're collaborating to try to

543
00:32:40.671 --> 00:32:43.580
invent the future of cooking.
And in particular,

544
00:32:43.581 --> 00:32:47.420
they had Harold McGee talking about the chef with a name that nobody had heard

545
00:32:47.421 --> 00:32:49.880
of from England called Heston Blumenthal,

546
00:32:49.881 --> 00:32:54.140
who is really trying to apply science in his kitchen to do better food,

547
00:32:54.141 --> 00:32:56.840
to do more delicious food,
to understand the why's of cooking.

548
00:32:56.841 --> 00:33:00.920
And I was like that,
that sounds perfect.
So I wrote a letter,

549
00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:06.350
I mean,
is,
is,
is sort of antiquated as it sounds.
I wrote a letter and I,

550
00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:11.030
and I,
um,
I actually faxed it to them,
um,
and said like,

551
00:33:11.031 --> 00:33:14.540
I've heard about your restaurant.
I'm a,
I'm a chef cooking in Seattle.

552
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:18.260
I'd love to come over to eat and stodge uh,

553
00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.560
basically apprentice for the weekend in your kitchen,
just just to see.

554
00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:24.590
And they said,
sure.
Um,

555
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.220
so I flew myself over shortly after Valentine's Day,

556
00:33:28.221 --> 00:33:31.760
2003 is it typical that a restaurant just says sure.

557
00:33:31.761 --> 00:33:35.270
To request list that actually surprisingly common if you ask in the right way.

558
00:33:35.271 --> 00:33:38.040
Now,
if you go to a restaurant that's oversubscribed,

559
00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.770
if you go to like the hottest restaurant,

560
00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:44.390
there's a line of people they can choose from and they're going to choose the

561
00:33:44.391 --> 00:33:48.170
best because that's their recruiting ground.
Um,
but in retrospect,

562
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.440
I don't even think it's a good decision as a chef to go there unless you're

563
00:33:51.441 --> 00:33:52.340
already established.

564
00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:57.320
Because by the time a restaurant gets that famous where there's a line of stodgy

565
00:33:57.321 --> 00:34:01.220
shares out the door,
it's a machine.
It has to be,
everybody's coming,

566
00:34:01.221 --> 00:34:04.190
they're expecting to get the greatest hits,
get the experience.

567
00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:08.630
And so it's very risky for a restaurant to basically allow a stodge here.

568
00:34:08.631 --> 00:34:10.850
Much freedom at all the,

569
00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:14.990
so what turned out to be perfect was the fat duck had just become a two.

570
00:34:14.991 --> 00:34:17.090
I actually thought it was a one star when I apply,

571
00:34:17.091 --> 00:34:19.100
but it had just gotten it second star.

572
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:22.880
I don't know that I would've had the guts to apply if I'd known they were a two

573
00:34:22.881 --> 00:34:27.320
star and they,
you know,
they didn't have that many customers.

574
00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.950
And so I didn't really feel like I was overreaching.

575
00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:33.350
And that was the bit of luck.
Is it,

576
00:34:33.351 --> 00:34:37.160
it turned out this was about to become one of the best restaurants in the world.

577
00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.470
It was a,
there was some dumb luck and timing here,

578
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.140
but to sort of finish the story,

579
00:34:42.141 --> 00:34:46.220
I flew myself over by myself cause that was all I could afford.

580
00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:50.450
And I remember being very confused about like the geography of England because

581
00:34:50.451 --> 00:34:54.890
the fat duck is actually west of London Heathrow near a town called Maidenhead.

582
00:34:54.891 --> 00:34:59.510
It's,
it's actually a tiny little town in the Thames River called Bray.
Uh,

583
00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:04.520
so I booked myself in a hotel and like west London stupidly,

584
00:35:04.521 --> 00:35:07.370
and I'm like jet lag and I get to the hotel and they check in and then by that

585
00:35:07.371 --> 00:35:09.800
time I need to drive right out to the,
to the restaurant.

586
00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:14.060
And this is like my first experience driving on the wrong side of the road.
And,

587
00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:16.370
uh,
I think the statute of limitations,
right?

588
00:35:16.371 --> 00:35:19.290
Because I also had to drive myself back that night after a lot of wine.

589
00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:23.510
And that also inadvisable it advisable in the wheel,

590
00:35:23.511 --> 00:35:25.270
did not look better for it.
Um,

591
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:30.810
but I got out to the restaurant and I see they sat me at a table of one under a

592
00:35:30.811 --> 00:35:33.110
stairwell and the restaurant is the 600 year old pub.

593
00:35:33.111 --> 00:35:36.530
The ceilings are about seven feet tall,
very unassuming,

594
00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:39.270
not what you'd expect for this,
this,
this finite room.

595
00:35:39.271 --> 00:35:40.800
It was like you're in someone's living room.

596
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:46.510
And I think the best way I could describe the meal that night starts with the,

597
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:49.170
the,
the dish that it actually starts with to this day.

598
00:35:49.171 --> 00:35:52.590
The first issue get is the liquid nitrogen poach green tea sour.

599
00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.980
And so I'm sitting at this very minimalist white linen table.

600
00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:59.490
Nothing else is sitting on it.
And before they take your order,

601
00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:02.750
before anything else,
the waiter wheels over a year,

602
00:36:02.751 --> 00:36:07.050
a don one of those trolleys up to your table has a cauldron,

603
00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:12.000
a technically a dewar ball of liquid nitrogen boiling away at 200 degrees below

604
00:36:12.001 --> 00:36:16.710
zero Celsius.
And he picks up,
uh,
a whipping siphon,

605
00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:21.330
um,
and dispense has what looks like a dollop of shaving mousse onto the end of a

606
00:36:21.331 --> 00:36:25.390
spoon and then knocks it into that,
that cauldron of liquid nitrogen.

607
00:36:25.391 --> 00:36:30.330
And turns it over and base it for exactly eight seconds and then strains it out

608
00:36:30.331 --> 00:36:31.770
and dust it with some green tea,

609
00:36:31.771 --> 00:36:34.440
matcha powder and hands it over to you on a little,

610
00:36:34.441 --> 00:36:38.490
a little a chilled plate and asked you to pick it up and eat it all in one bite.

611
00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:43.770
And it looks like this little Marangu and when you bite into it,

612
00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:45.120
or at least for me,

613
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:50.840
I was just fantastic that the shell sort of shatters crisply like glass and then

614
00:36:50.911 --> 00:36:51.750
it gives away this,

615
00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:56.670
this luscious moose that's racing with the acidity of lime juice and the

616
00:36:56.671 --> 00:36:58.860
astringency of a bit of green tea.

617
00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:02.970
But the coolest part is you get this puff of smoke out your nose,

618
00:37:02.971 --> 00:37:06.480
so you look like a smoking dragon.
There's a video of,

619
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:11.310
of me experiencing that for the first time in your lab.
Yes.
Uh,

620
00:37:11.311 --> 00:37:15.180
if you search Tim Ferriss chef steps,
I'm sure it'll pop up somewhere.

621
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:20.610
And so like it sort of,
you know,
twist your mind like what is this?

622
00:37:20.611 --> 00:37:25.500
But you know,
the purpose was actually,
it turned out totally reasoned out.
It was,

623
00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:28.530
if you've ever had orange juice in the morning after brushing your teeth,

624
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:30.570
it tastes awful.

625
00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:34.020
And it's not because the orange juice changes because your mouth changed.

626
00:37:34.021 --> 00:37:38.070
And and flavor is this idea that's actually constructed by your brain from all

627
00:37:38.071 --> 00:37:42.090
these sensory inputs.
And so if you take orange juice and you,

628
00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.810
which is acidic and you drink it after you've had a mouthful of alkaline

629
00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:49.260
toothpaste,
it neutralizes that acidity.
It tastes awful.

630
00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.690
And if you're trying to be the best wrestler in the world,

631
00:37:51.691 --> 00:37:53.190
you kind of want a level playing field.

632
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:57.120
So the lime juice in that green tea sour is designed to neutralize any

633
00:37:57.121 --> 00:37:58.350
toothpastes residue.

634
00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:02.610
And the green tea provides these astringent polyphenols to clean it,

635
00:38:02.611 --> 00:38:05.400
cleanse all the soft tissue because maybe you had a cigarette,

636
00:38:05.401 --> 00:38:08.130
maybe you had a packet of chips or something before you came to the restaurant.

637
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:12.690
So it's basically mouthwash that's this surprising entertaining delight and the

638
00:38:12.691 --> 00:38:13.680
rest of the meal,

639
00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:17.400
like totally did my head in and just blew me away because not only was

640
00:38:17.401 --> 00:38:21.060
everything whimsical and fun and gorgeous to look at,

641
00:38:21.061 --> 00:38:23.970
but everything was delicious.
And so at the end of that night,

642
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.380
I walked back in there,
I was like,

643
00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:28.380
I will work for free for as long as you will let me work here.

644
00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:32.730
And what I didn't know is at the time they had no money where they were going

645
00:38:32.731 --> 00:38:37.690
bankrupt and so they,
they were like sure.
You said the magic words.

646
00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:38.290
Yes.

647
00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:42.050
So I got back to the hotel that night and I called my girlfriend back in radio

648
00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:45.950
APP.
Exactly.
I said,
great news,
Dawn.
Um,

649
00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:48.250
I've just accepted a job at the fat duck.

650
00:38:48.251 --> 00:38:51.700
I'm coming home and a couple of days I need to pack and I'm back here in a month

651
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:56.260
and all I got was,
I can't talk about this right now.
Click.
Um,

652
00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:59.410
and she's my wife now,
so it didn't work out that badly.

653
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:02.620
But you can kind of imagine how the wind,

654
00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:08.140
she's high tolerance,
high built in tolerance for,

655
00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:12.160
for Chris Young traits,
I guess.
Uh,
it's a,
it's a job requirement.

656
00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:15.980
Uh,
what,

657
00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:19.600
what do you learn at the fat duck or from Heston?

658
00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:23.620
Everything Heston Heston really became,
my mentor is as a chef.

659
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:25.940
I worked for him for five years.
Um,

660
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:30.700
I initially worked for him as an unpaid stodge air and this was like back in the

661
00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:35.410
day when some of the chefs were like just out of prison and things like that and

662
00:39:35.411 --> 00:39:38.200
uh,
uh,
it was transitional.
Like we are moving.

663
00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:41.110
Definitely most of the chefs were way above,
above that,

664
00:39:41.111 --> 00:39:44.710
but there was a few chefs that were still flaky and so I remember literally a

665
00:39:44.711 --> 00:39:48.370
chef just,
they'd hired him and he didn't show up for work and they're like,

666
00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:51.100
somebody has got to be on that station,
so congratulations.
You're,

667
00:39:51.101 --> 00:39:52.660
you're running that section now.

668
00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:57.460
And that was like getting promoted for me like I am,
it was at that time,

669
00:39:57.461 --> 00:40:02.170
like at best sort of a farm team getting promoted to the majors.

670
00:40:02.171 --> 00:40:03.100
It's like have fun.

671
00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:08.110
I got my ass handed to me every day for the next three months.

672
00:40:08.111 --> 00:40:11.800
I remember I was the first to arrive at the restaurant at six 30 in the morning

673
00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:16.540
or seven it depending on the day and the wait staff,

674
00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:18.070
the chefs had all left the kitchen.

675
00:40:18.071 --> 00:40:20.470
The wait staff was having to throw me out at the end of the night because I was

676
00:40:20.471 --> 00:40:21.820
trying to get ahead of my prep,

677
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.340
not because like I was like this really diligent guy,

678
00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:28.990
but because I needed every bit of extra time because I sucked compared to

679
00:40:28.991 --> 00:40:31.510
everyone else.
I didn't know how to be fast enough yet.

680
00:40:31.511 --> 00:40:35.830
I didn't know how to organize my Misa applause list to do things these and plus

681
00:40:35.831 --> 00:40:38.750
getting everything,
getting everything in the right place.
You have this cramped,

682
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.470
ginormous clipboard of all the things you have to get done that day.

683
00:40:41.471 --> 00:40:44.080
And if you don't put that puzzle in just the right order,

684
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:48.400
you're not going to get the job done in time.
And then you're going to have,

685
00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.120
you're going to go down bad and potentially pull everybody else down with you.

686
00:40:52.121 --> 00:40:56.110
And so you will be hated.
Um,
and so it was like,

687
00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.960
I didn't want to be like that.
Hated you.
Don't want to be the private,

688
00:40:58.961 --> 00:41:02.350
like I was already the American,
so I was already at a total disadvantage.

689
00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:05.380
You don't want to be the private pile from full metal jacket.
Totally that.

690
00:41:05.381 --> 00:41:07.900
And so like it was put in the extra effort.

691
00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.450
But that's one of the things I really learned was

692
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:17.170
people see that and if you are busting your ass and if you're not slacking and

693
00:41:17.171 --> 00:41:20.530
if you're just not totally incompetent,
people are going to build you up.

694
00:41:20.531 --> 00:41:23.500
At least if you're in a good place,
if you're not in that kind of place,

695
00:41:23.501 --> 00:41:25.150
you should probably leave.
Um,

696
00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:29.020
but people built me up over time and by the end of those three months,

697
00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:34.760
Heston,
I had not become anything close to the best line cook.
Not even,

698
00:41:34.761 --> 00:41:35.900
not even at the same caliber,

699
00:41:35.901 --> 00:41:39.830
but I did have a knack for solving problems that nobody else could solve.

700
00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:42.410
And that's when Heston was like,
you know,

701
00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:45.530
I've always wanted to have a kitchen that works on the new ideas.

702
00:41:45.531 --> 00:41:48.530
I've always wanted to have a place that's away from the pressures of service,

703
00:41:48.531 --> 00:41:50.420
where we develop the things we experiment,

704
00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:53.990
where we can afford to fail without affecting the customers.

705
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:55.130
And with your science background,

706
00:41:55.131 --> 00:41:59.120
why don't you move to England fulltime Chris and build that up.
And that was,

707
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.360
that was my opportunity.
So it was like walk through that door,
right?

708
00:42:02.361 --> 00:42:06.770
This wasn't that hard.
What types of problems were you able to solve?

709
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:11.270
Well that led him to,
so there were,
there are two things.

710
00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.790
So one was our stock,
um,

711
00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:18.880
we made an unbelievable number of different stock and Heston was kind of this no

712
00:42:19.701 --> 00:42:22.490
holds barred.
We're going to go for the last point,

713
00:42:22.491 --> 00:42:24.650
1% of perfection on everything.

714
00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:30.200
And stocks come from meat and meat is really expensive.

715
00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:35.000
And we were doing things like roasting down entire legs of animals to canteen

716
00:42:35.001 --> 00:42:38.900
off the juices as they accumulated,
create these unbelievable decadent,
rich,

717
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:42.650
a Jew to go with the,
the Vera for the various sauces.

718
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:45.650
And not only was that time consuming and labor intensive,

719
00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:49.640
but like it was ludicrously expensive,
like just totally insane.

720
00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.550
Like you could take to talk to most Michelin Star chefs and they'd be like,

721
00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:56.570
that's crazy talk.
Like nobody does that.
Well we did.

722
00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.840
And I remember being like,
what would that,
so just just to,

723
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:03.440
just to try to put a fine point that it's,
when you say absurdly expensive,

724
00:43:03.441 --> 00:43:06.290
like what do we w w would,
uh,
something like that look like,
oh,

725
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:09.800
thousands of pounds a week for a restaurant that really couldn't afford to be

726
00:43:09.801 --> 00:43:11.900
doing that because we didn't have enough customers.
Got It.

727
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:13.190
Even if you did have enough customers,

728
00:43:13.191 --> 00:43:16.370
it's still nuts because you don't have that kind of margin do that.
But we did,

729
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:18.470
uh,
like because it was better,

730
00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:22.790
like we would do it and I remember we would serve the pieces of meat for family

731
00:43:22.791 --> 00:43:23.960
meal and guess what?

732
00:43:23.961 --> 00:43:27.650
Like the lamb still tasted like lamb and the beef still tasted like beef and,

733
00:43:27.651 --> 00:43:32.060
and the veal still tasted like veal.
And like my chemist brain kicks in is like,

734
00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.490
we haven't gotten everything out.
Like,

735
00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:40.040
as nice as it is to have like the lamb stew,
uh,
for,
for staff meal,

736
00:43:40.041 --> 00:43:42.110
which,
which made the Irish contingent happy.

737
00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.620
Like that's not a good thing for the restaurant.
And so I was like,
you know,

738
00:43:45.621 --> 00:43:50.270
I think we can do a better job here by grinding the meat up to increase the

739
00:43:50.271 --> 00:43:54.140
surface area to volume and let's use a pressure cooker because increase the

740
00:43:54.141 --> 00:43:55.880
temperature,
we can extract more.

741
00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:01.300
And so I did a bunch of experiments like in between service and I was creating

742
00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:06.320
some of the stocks that Heston was like these rival anything we're doing and I'm

743
00:44:06.321 --> 00:44:07.580
doing it with a fraction of the meet.

744
00:44:07.581 --> 00:44:12.581
So as a restaurant we ended up buying a $36,000 pressure Brat Pan that was like

745
00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.280
big giant scale,
a commercial,

746
00:44:16.281 --> 00:44:21.281
a pressure cooker and are a chef that just did that full time for all our stocks

747
00:44:22.131 --> 00:44:22.580
and sauces.

748
00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:27.380
And we paid it back I think within the first six months in terms of the savings.

749
00:44:27.381 --> 00:44:29.420
And we shifted all of the production over.

750
00:44:29.421 --> 00:44:33.810
So like that was one thing that was a very process or anything.

751
00:44:33.811 --> 00:44:37.320
It was very transparent to the customers.
But about the same time,

752
00:44:37.321 --> 00:44:41.670
Heston was starting to spend time with front Adrion Albert Adria from Elbulli

753
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:45.510
and they were just starting to do something they would become famous for.

754
00:44:45.511 --> 00:44:48.480
And about a year,
these caviar,
um,

755
00:44:48.481 --> 00:44:52.260
these little edible caviar that they were making from Mellon and the way they

756
00:44:52.261 --> 00:44:55.320
were doing it as they were taking a seaweed based hydrocolloid,

757
00:44:55.321 --> 00:44:58.950
technically algenate and they were mixing that,

758
00:44:58.951 --> 00:45:01.380
that hydrocolloid into melon juice,

759
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.920
dripping it into a calcium back that caused it to set up.

760
00:45:04.921 --> 00:45:07.770
And it was like little folk caviar that tasted like melon.

761
00:45:07.771 --> 00:45:12.690
And so this I think went on the 2004 Elbulli menu and Heston to seen it and they

762
00:45:12.691 --> 00:45:13.740
were very secretive about it.
Like,

763
00:45:13.741 --> 00:45:17.970
well you take product x and you mix it with product y and this is what you get.

764
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:21.690
So Heston came back,
he was like,
you know,
how is that done?

765
00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:24.740
And I sort of reverse engineered it and figured it out.

766
00:45:24.741 --> 00:45:28.360
And so those were the kinds of little things that I started kind of getting it

767
00:45:28.361 --> 00:45:31.070
reputation for even though I was like in many other regards,

768
00:45:31.071 --> 00:45:34.940
like nowhere near the caliber of the other chefs in terms of like raw technical,

769
00:45:34.941 --> 00:45:39.080
a Rah Rah cooking abilities.
And so that Kinda gave me my opening.

770
00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:40.441
<v 2>Now you,</v>

771
00:45:40.441 --> 00:45:45.441
you are one of only a few friends that I enjoy asking seemingly innocuous

772
00:45:46.071 --> 00:45:51.071
questions of because I get pretty much the same pattern and,

773
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:56.720
and I see this,
uh,
with you.
I see it with a number of friends,

774
00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:01.220
like Matt Mullenweg,
another mutual friend.
And then we have,
uh,

775
00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:05.060
Eric Cressey who does trains a lot of professional baseball players and whatnot.

776
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:09.050
If I ask him about deadlifts or any type of tear I might have on the inside of

777
00:46:09.051 --> 00:46:10.730
my leg.
So I just want to,

778
00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.670
I'm not going to read the whole thing because it's like a mini novella.

779
00:46:13.671 --> 00:46:15.970
But this is usually how it works is I'll,

780
00:46:15.971 --> 00:46:19.600
I'll send you a text and it will be something like,
Hey,

781
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:24.870
if I wanted to cool down the water in my bath tub to 50 degrees Fahrenheit or 45

782
00:46:26.981 --> 00:46:30.580
degrees,
I'm looking at this,
this and this option,
what would you do?

783
00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:35.120
And usually the response is along the lines of,
let me think about that.

784
00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:37.070
I might think about a or B.

785
00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:41.480
And then I remember it went radio silent and then day later I got this email,

786
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:46.990
ice baths and such as the subject line and I'm just going to read part of it.

787
00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.840
So I did a little bit of thinking about this and some quick math to confirm my

788
00:46:50.841 --> 00:46:53.360
intuition.
Tldr by a small ice maker,

789
00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:56.900
he didn't clean water as a pain because the water has the highest specific heat

790
00:46:56.901 --> 00:46:59.960
amount of energy required to change the temperature of one gram by one degree

791
00:46:59.961 --> 00:47:03.890
Celsius of any common substance.
Your bathtub holds something like 50 gallons.

792
00:47:03.891 --> 00:47:05.090
Assuming you're cold tap water,

793
00:47:05.091 --> 00:47:07.880
it comes out at 50 degrees Fahrenheit and you would like about that 40 degrees

794
00:47:07.881 --> 00:47:08.630
Fahrenheit.

795
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:12.410
Then you need to pull about 4.4 4 million joules of heat energy out of the water

796
00:47:12.411 --> 00:47:15.230
to drop the temperature.
Adding ice is by far the fastest,

797
00:47:15.231 --> 00:47:17.960
most efficient way to do the job without resorting to any kind of nonsense.

798
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:21.600
Direct injection of liquid nitrogen would be fun.
29 pounds of ice would,

799
00:47:21.601 --> 00:47:24.360
you should do the job nicely.
Better yet,
if the ice is cubed,

800
00:47:24.361 --> 00:47:26.600
it'll melt quickly and chill your bath within 10 minutes or so.

801
00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:30.490
Kind of the similar surface area approach that you would use for the uh,

802
00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:33.700
the joke.
You could go high tech and get an immersion Schiller of some kind.

803
00:47:33.701 --> 00:47:36.110
They'll do the job eventually,
but it's going to take a wall.
Then this is,

804
00:47:36.111 --> 00:47:38.920
this is the part that I like and just goes on and on.

805
00:47:38.921 --> 00:47:41.470
Your typical domestic electrical outlet is limited to 15 amps,

806
00:47:41.471 --> 00:47:43.410
which works out to about 1800 watts of power.

807
00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:46.600
Drawing any more in the fuse is going to blow physics being the bitch that it
is.

808
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:49.420
Immersion chillers only about 40% energy efficient at best.

809
00:47:49.421 --> 00:47:52.450
This means that even a $4,000 1800 watt laboratory,

810
00:47:52.451 --> 00:47:54.250
it goes on and on and on and on.

811
00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:59.510
So have you always had this degree of OCD doc?

812
00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:04.190
Nauseousness I like it because you've harnessed it for the,
for powers of good.

813
00:48:04.610 --> 00:48:08.600
Uh,
and let me know I'm not working on evil.
That's true.
Well I not,

814
00:48:08.601 --> 00:48:13.220
not usually a forces of evil and I'm going to retrieve,
I have uh,

815
00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:18.580
a Yak milk bone that my dog is chewing and making a lot of noise with Molly.

816
00:48:18.831 --> 00:48:23.390
I'll give you one of these later.
Uh,
so I'm going to retrieve that.
But has this,

817
00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:27.350
has this been a trait present since you were a little kid or,

818
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:28.400
or when did that start?

819
00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:31.580
<v 3>I think on some level,
yeah,
I,</v>

820
00:48:32.090 --> 00:48:37.090
I am terrible at things that I am not interested in if I'm interested in it.

821
00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:43.450
It's one of these things where I will devote almost all my tie,

822
00:48:43.451 --> 00:48:47.310
no completely obsess about it.
And I actually don't have a very good off switch,

823
00:48:47.311 --> 00:48:50.670
which can make me pretty difficult to deal with sometimes.

824
00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:55.980
And as I think back,
like in elementary school,
junior high,

825
00:48:55.981 --> 00:49:00.360
high school things that I was interested about in like high school was a great

826
00:49:00.361 --> 00:49:04.050
example.
It was super into desktop publishing in Zenes and like,

827
00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:08.460
like reading Ray Gun and early early issues of wired and be like,

828
00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:09.750
I want to do stuff like that.

829
00:49:09.751 --> 00:49:13.410
Like I obsessed about it and learned everything about it and knew who was doing

830
00:49:13.411 --> 00:49:17.400
what.
But like math at the time who gives a rat's ass and like,

831
00:49:17.401 --> 00:49:21.300
even though it was like super bad for my college admissions process,

832
00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.780
like that didn't motivate me.
So I think I've always had the,

833
00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:30.470
I like to obsess on stuff where I can just keep going deeper and deeper and,

834
00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:35.600
and on some level mastering or at least understanding what mastery is about in

835
00:49:35.701 --> 00:49:36.720
that,
in that area.

836
00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:41.370
But it's totally driven by whatever's interesting me at that time.

837
00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:45.030
How did you get converted to being interested in math?

838
00:49:45.031 --> 00:49:49.140
Like it was at a particular teacher?
Yeah,
I think it was a combination of that.

839
00:49:49.141 --> 00:49:52.680
So I was briefly at the University of Vermont.

840
00:49:52.681 --> 00:49:54.060
It's not where I finished my degree,

841
00:49:54.061 --> 00:49:59.061
but I started there mostly because it was very far from New Mexico where a Wa

842
00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:02.820
where high school was and I wanted to get the hell out.
And um,

843
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:05.650
also because their admissions policy was basically,

844
00:50:05.651 --> 00:50:08.290
do you have a for an out of state,
like do you have a pulse?

845
00:50:08.291 --> 00:50:10.960
Like can you pay out of state tuition?
Yeah.
So,
okay,
welcome.

846
00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:16.020
I took a a whole bunch of classes but somehow I ended up signing up for calculus

847
00:50:16.021 --> 00:50:19.200
one,
which was like in retrospect,
like totally insane.

848
00:50:19.201 --> 00:50:22.650
There was no reason to believe that was a good choice at all.

849
00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.260
But there was a particularly good,
uh,

850
00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:29.690
it was actually a Grad student teaching it and somehow it made sense.

851
00:50:29.691 --> 00:50:33.260
A lot of it was a lot of its thinking.
Uh,
you know,

852
00:50:33.261 --> 00:50:36.740
calculus is often about a can be thought of in terms of the math of motion and

853
00:50:36.741 --> 00:50:41.030
stuff.
And so I found I had this knack for being able to think things through and

854
00:50:41.031 --> 00:50:45.950
visualize stuff very well in terms of the movement or process or I can

855
00:50:45.951 --> 00:50:49.250
manipulate three dimensional objects really well in my head.
Um,

856
00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:54.590
and that like at that,
that naturally makes you like,
well qualified for Calculus.

857
00:50:54.591 --> 00:50:59.591
But somehow that my unique background made it work for me and I was,

858
00:50:59.811 --> 00:51:04.070
I just remember being shocked.
Like I got an a,
which was like super weird.

859
00:51:04.071 --> 00:51:06.800
I was like,
wow,
I have no idea how he did that.

860
00:51:07.310 --> 00:51:09.590
But it was enough that I kind of wanted to keep going.

861
00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:13.070
And the further I got in it,
the more interesting it got.

862
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:16.910
And the more I discovered there was really interesting creative problems that I

863
00:51:16.911 --> 00:51:21.860
could solve with those kinds of tools.
And now it started to make sense for me.

864
00:51:21.861 --> 00:51:26.240
It's like it wasn't for its own sake,
it was the fact that Oh,

865
00:51:26.241 --> 00:51:29.870
these are tools that allow me to solve and do these other interesting things.

866
00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.220
And so it was like,
okay,

867
00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:34.130
I want to learn this because I want to be able to do those kinds of things.

868
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.830
And this is like the stuff you need to know to be able to go do that.

869
00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:41.750
What books,
if any,
have you gifted the most to other people?

870
00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:44.780
So I think a lot of them will probably be in the cooking space.

871
00:51:44.781 --> 00:51:48.800
I've definitely maybe on food and cooking.
I have gifted that a lot there.

872
00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:53.930
I mean my career starts with that book in many ways.
And um,
uh,

873
00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:55.940
you know,
there would be,

874
00:51:56.540 --> 00:52:00.380
there wouldn't be any of this modern cooking movement without Harold's book.

875
00:52:00.381 --> 00:52:03.230
I don't think.
And there's certainly wouldn't be modernist cuisine that,

876
00:52:03.231 --> 00:52:07.130
that made a big,
uh,
made a big role in my career without that book.

877
00:52:07.131 --> 00:52:10.460
So I've gifted a lot because I think it's relevant and I think for a certain

878
00:52:10.461 --> 00:52:14.180
type of individual,
it's this kind of book that every time you open it up,

879
00:52:14.181 --> 00:52:16.100
you see something,
you're like,
oh,
I didn't even know that was there.

880
00:52:16.101 --> 00:52:18.170
That's super cool.
And,
and you read something and go,
well,

881
00:52:18.171 --> 00:52:21.890
that's the world's like way more interesting than I thought.
Um,

882
00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:26.330
I think I've gifted a Michel Bras essential cuisine quite a bit,

883
00:52:26.331 --> 00:52:28.910
although it's hard to do now because I think it's out of print in English and

884
00:52:28.911 --> 00:52:29.780
quite expensive.

885
00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:35.440
The other book I've found myself gifting a lot lately is a out of print book on

886
00:52:37.011 --> 00:52:41.080
thermodynamics called the second law and it was written by uh,

887
00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:45.830
an Oxford physical chemistry professor named uh,
PW Atkins.

888
00:52:46.610 --> 00:52:51.610
And that book is just a phenomenal casual infographic in read on how the world

889
00:52:54.591 --> 00:52:56.390
works from an energy perspective.

890
00:52:56.420 --> 00:53:01.420
And I've found that so incredibly useful in trying to understand how to do

891
00:53:01.851 --> 00:53:04.460
something,
how to make something work,
whether something that's even possible.

892
00:53:04.461 --> 00:53:09.200
It's frequently my bullshit detector when somebody's trying to convince me some

893
00:53:09.201 --> 00:53:11.120
technology or some idea has merit.

894
00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:15.890
I very quickly come back to just sketching out the kind of thing I did for that

895
00:53:15.891 --> 00:53:19.790
email where it's like,
let me just see with knowing nothing about the subject,

896
00:53:19.791 --> 00:53:23.930
if I can just sketch out the basic ideas of the energy of how much energy is

897
00:53:23.931 --> 00:53:28.260
going to be involved or,
or like if I assume limitless capacities,

898
00:53:28.261 --> 00:53:32.760
does this make any sense?
Ever.
And so many things that sound good,

899
00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:36.720
like just don't pass muster.
As soon as you start looking at the world that way,

900
00:53:36.721 --> 00:53:36.931
you're like,

901
00:53:36.931 --> 00:53:41.460
well that's clearly just a waste of everybody's time and we should just stop and

902
00:53:41.461 --> 00:53:42.870
go do this,
this thing over here.

903
00:53:42.871 --> 00:53:46.260
Which like at least you're not having to invent new physics or violate the laws

904
00:53:46.261 --> 00:53:47.460
of physics to go do it.

905
00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:52.640
How much mathematics background do you need or physics background do you need

906
00:53:53.071 --> 00:53:56.840
for that book to be readable?
None.
None.
Great.
You know,

907
00:53:57.330 --> 00:53:59.460
like you've got to be interested in curious in it.

908
00:53:59.461 --> 00:54:02.400
So some people's eyes will glaze over,
but it's meant to be a popular site.

909
00:54:02.401 --> 00:54:06.570
Like I did like the hardcore math laden,
um,

910
00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:08.430
physical chemistry,
but uh,

911
00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:12.510
very like I have to go look up the math for some of that stuff now.
Very,

912
00:54:12.511 --> 00:54:16.050
I'm very rarely doing math.
That's much fancier than like division.

913
00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:20.250
It's the concepts in just basically saying like,
okay,

914
00:54:20.251 --> 00:54:23.930
like energy's got to be conserved.
Or efficiency is like,

915
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.720
what is the maximum theoretical efficiency this could ever work at?

916
00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:31.800
So it is like the idea of a 100 mile per gallon car even make sense on the face

917
00:54:31.801 --> 00:54:36.060
of it.
It's like,
no,
that's never going to happen unless we get rid of air.
Um,

918
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:39.930
so those kinds of things,
you don't actually need that much fancy math,

919
00:54:39.931 --> 00:54:44.931
but it's useful just to have the concepts of thinking about this as how this

920
00:54:46.921 --> 00:54:50.790
weird thing we call energy actually works and what's possible in this world and

921
00:54:50.791 --> 00:54:54.940
what's not possible.
Do you read any fiction?
I do though.

922
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.700
It comes in and goes in phases.

923
00:54:56.701 --> 00:55:01.701
So like I think most recently I read Neil Stevenson's Seveneves and like mostly

924
00:55:04.651 --> 00:55:07.140
because,
uh,
I made a very,

925
00:55:07.141 --> 00:55:11.550
very minor contribution to a sub theme in that book.
And I found like,

926
00:55:11.551 --> 00:55:16.350
I actually enjoyed that a lot,
but mostly because it was like competence porn.

927
00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.320
Uh,
what does that mean?

928
00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:23.090
So Neil likes to go on these big rats on a,

929
00:55:23.091 --> 00:55:27.090
about how some aspect of technology works.
And if you know Neil,

930
00:55:27.091 --> 00:55:31.620
it's usually because like he fell into that hole and dug pretty deep and then

931
00:55:31.621 --> 00:55:34.140
came back with all that because he knew all these experts with this

932
00:55:34.141 --> 00:55:34.974
understanding.

933
00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:38.850
And so he'll go on for pages and pages and pages explaining like how you would

934
00:55:38.851 --> 00:55:43.650
actually attach nuclear reactor to a comment and you're like,

935
00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:46.800
it's basically engineering porn.
It's like,
oh this is how you would do it.

936
00:55:46.801 --> 00:55:49.740
So like if I'm ever in that situation,
now I know.

937
00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:54.600
Well yeah he did that in a coop denomic on with some of the tunneling passages.

938
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:55.170
Right?

939
00:55:55.170 --> 00:56:00.120
And which I loved because I think you and I and a lot of our mutual friends are

940
00:56:00.121 --> 00:56:04.980
hardwired to get a crack hit from that type of detail.

941
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.220
We,
we like knowing how to do something and get stuff done.

942
00:56:08.221 --> 00:56:12.750
Because I suppose at some of what I liked about cooking and what I like about

943
00:56:12.751 --> 00:56:17.700
engineering and the types of stuff I do now,
you're like changing the world.

944
00:56:17.701 --> 00:56:20.820
You're making something happen and it's not very abstract.

945
00:56:20.821 --> 00:56:22.080
Like it's very concrete.

946
00:56:22.081 --> 00:56:27.081
And that's for like my brain somehow that like that's just really satisfying.

947
00:56:27.701 --> 00:56:30.910
And so books that tap into that competence porn.

948
00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:36.770
<v 2>I was looking at,
uh,
the Facebook feed of,
I got him,</v>

949
00:56:36.771 --> 00:56:39.890
Alex Honnold.
So he,
I interviewed him for the podcast.

950
00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:43.670
I'm not sure if it will have been published yet when people hear this probably.

951
00:56:43.671 --> 00:56:48.590
So he's the most famous free solo climber in the world and has many,

952
00:56:48.591 --> 00:56:51.650
many speed records.
Uh,
and uh,

953
00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:56.680
there was a post he put up about stress and anxiety and the point he makes is

954
00:56:57.211 --> 00:56:59.190
one of the things I love about climbing and being in the mountains,

955
00:56:59.191 --> 00:57:02.130
it's an immediate return environment.
You make decisions,
you have an impact,

956
00:57:02.131 --> 00:57:05.490
you reevaluate,
you make more decisions,
et cetera.
In other words,

957
00:57:05.491 --> 00:57:09.580
the sort of delayed return environment being tied to anxiety.
So it,

958
00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:10.890
it strikes me that

959
00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:15.110
<v 3>uh,
on a very human level it would be fulfilling</v>

960
00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:19.800
<v 2>to have that type of immediate feedback and ability to iterate that you have an</v>

961
00:57:19.801 --> 00:57:21.180
engineering or cooking.

962
00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:25.460
<v 3>I,
I,
I tend to gravitate towards things where</v>

963
00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:31.100
it's,
it's actually weird,
like the day to day provides very tangible feedback.

964
00:57:31.101 --> 00:57:34.280
The goals can actually take years to accomplish,

965
00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:39.670
but I find it don't have the staying power for projects where there isn't a

966
00:57:39.671 --> 00:57:44.650
fairly fast feedback loop running on some level that tells me if I'm even going

967
00:57:44.651 --> 00:57:49.590
in a good direction.
Um,
if it's just totally ambiguous or,

968
00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:54.030
or you just can't know,
uh,
I really struggle with that.
That's hard.

969
00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:58.590
<v 2>See,
you talked about writing the letter to Hesston,
uh,</v>

970
00:57:58.830 --> 00:58:02.340
and then your Jedi mind trick on the gent earlier.

971
00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:07.050
You've also worked with Nathan Myhrvold as we mentioned,
uh,

972
00:58:07.110 --> 00:58:11.480
later directly with Bill Gates.
How do you end up working for these people?

973
00:58:11.481 --> 00:58:15.950
I mean,
if you had to try to tidy other,
some kind of pattern,
is there one?

974
00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:20.920
<v 3>Well,
so food,
um,
definitely ties together.
I mean it quite explicitly.</v>

975
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:25.090
I met Nathan because he was a guest at the fat duck and uh,

976
00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:28.550
Seattle is home for him and Seattle was kind of sort of home for me before the

977
00:58:28.551 --> 00:58:31.480
fat duck guy,
I w I ended up going to university of Washington.

978
00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:34.640
That's where I did my degrees and it's,
it was this home as anywhere.

979
00:58:35.330 --> 00:58:38.820
So Nathan was fascinated by cooking.

980
00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:41.800
He was particularly fascinated by the science behind cooking and that was a

981
00:58:41.801 --> 00:58:44.140
shared passion and we struck up a friendship over that.

982
00:58:44.141 --> 00:58:46.600
So who is Nathan for be blue on it?
Ah,

983
00:58:46.601 --> 00:58:50.320
so Nathan has many things depending on who you ask.
But uh,

984
00:58:50.321 --> 00:58:53.770
the definition I would give is,
uh,
Nathan was my coauthor on modernist cuisine.

985
00:58:53.771 --> 00:58:57.280
Nathan was,
uh,
you know,
there would be no modernist cuisine without Nathan.

986
00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:01.810
He's most famous I think for being the first chief technology officer of

987
00:59:01.811 --> 00:59:03.520
Microsoft.
Um,

988
00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:08.140
he's more controversial today for being the founder and CEO of intellectual

989
00:59:08.141 --> 00:59:09.040
ventures.
Um,

990
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:14.160
and in mentioned company to saw a giant patent troll to others.
The,
uh,

991
00:59:14.161 --> 00:59:19.060
I think the truth is somewhere much more in the middle.
And let's look

992
00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:23.300
<v 2>the lessons learned.
I mean,
you can pick and choose from whether it's Nathan,</v>

993
00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:25.970
Bill,
Gates,
Heston.

994
00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:31.420
Are there any lessons or expressions that really stuck with you that come to

995
00:59:31.611 --> 00:59:34.080
mind?
And I'll buy you some time just by giving a personal example.

996
00:59:34.081 --> 00:59:37.680
Like I had a professor at Princeton who had a huge impact on me and there,

997
00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:42.290
there were really only a few who did at that university despite the,

998
00:59:42.291 --> 00:59:46.760
the abundance of riches that they have.
But uh,
Edge Shao,
Z,
s,

999
00:59:46.761 --> 00:59:50.210
c h a u who,
who taught high tech entrepreneurship,

1000
00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:53.760
I believe he was the first one of the first computer science professors,
uh,

1001
00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:55.310
ever at Stanford.

1002
00:59:55.311 --> 00:59:59.570
Partially because just like that cook didn't show up effectively the same thing

1003
00:59:59.571 --> 01:00:02.810
happened.
And they're like,
can any of you guys teach?
What does this computer,

1004
01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.150
computer science,
we don't know that is,
who can teach us?
And he's like,

1005
01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:09.200
I'll teach it.
Sure.
And that's,
that's how I got the Gig.
And uh,

1006
01:00:09.201 --> 01:00:12.720
went on to take a number of companies public,
become a congressman.

1007
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:17.210
He was a competitive figure skater,
like fascinating guy.

1008
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:20.380
But at one point,
I remember I was trying to get into his class.

1009
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:23.810
It was already full.
It was oversubscribed.
And I said,
I'll do anything.

1010
01:00:23.811 --> 01:00:28.280
I kind of sent the,
the similar letter,
but I,
it was a letter,
I sent him a letter.

1011
01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:33.110
I guess it was an email through some basic terminal that we had at the time.

1012
01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:37.340
And I said,
I'll do anything.
I'll clean the erasers and inbetween classes,

1013
01:00:37.341 --> 01:00:40.280
whatever it takes.
I just,
I'll sit on the floor,
don't even need a chair,

1014
01:00:40.281 --> 01:00:42.260
et cetera.
And at one point,
you know,

1015
01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.710
I actually did like clean up afterwards and he said to me,
he goes,
Tim,
he's like,

1016
01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:50.060
don't get too good at the menial stuff.
Yeah.
Keep doing it.

1017
01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.320
And I was like,
oh,
that's actually pretty profound.
So anyway,

1018
01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:59.380
<v 3>I was,
yeah,
no,
that's,
there are definitely some.
So I've been really,
really lucky.</v>

1019
01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:03.330
It's more intentional now than it was then.

1020
01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:07.890
But to have ended up with some profound mentors in my life,
um,
my father was,

1021
01:01:07.891 --> 01:01:12.470
was absolutely my first one.
Um,
I grew up in a family business.
I think,
you know,

1022
01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:14.340
today that gives,
like,

1023
01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.930
I am so glad for having had a lot of visibility into that at a young age because

1024
01:01:18.931 --> 01:01:23.760
now like I need to do that.
Um,
and everyone's looking to me for that.

1025
01:01:23.761 --> 01:01:28.350
So what was the business?
Oh,
his was advertising research.
Um,
and,

1026
01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:30.650
uh,
that,
you know,
that also has,

1027
01:01:30.651 --> 01:01:34.650
has proved fortuitous of just having really thought about how advertising

1028
01:01:34.651 --> 01:01:38.040
actually works.
Um,
how brands are built.
Um,

1029
01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:40.650
what's good advertising and what's bad to advertising,

1030
01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:43.870
how marketing has put together these kinds of things.
Um,

1031
01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:49.220
that's like enormously practical when you're running a company because it's a

1032
01:01:49.501 --> 01:01:52.860
big part of like your job.
Even if you're not doing the work,
you,

1033
01:01:52.861 --> 01:01:57.220
if you're the CEO,
you need to have some sense of like what this is all about.
Um,

1034
01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:01.540
so that there was any other aspects.
My Dad was a mentor,

1035
01:02:01.541 --> 01:02:06.220
but certainly giving me visibility at a very young age and to just how he thinks

1036
01:02:06.221 --> 01:02:09.000
about running his business was helpful with Heston.

1037
01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:12.900
<v 2>Were there any specifics that your dad gave you or any particular thing that he</v>

1038
01:02:12.901 --> 01:02:13.980
showed you that stuck with you?

1039
01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:18.530
<v 3>Uh,
I think there's two things.
So one,
I remember something he said to me,</v>

1040
01:02:18.531 --> 01:02:22.330
I probably was a g a freshman or a sophomore in high school.

1041
01:02:22.331 --> 01:02:23.730
I would have been an Albuquerque,
New Mexico.

1042
01:02:23.731 --> 01:02:26.010
And I distinctly remember him saying,
you know,

1043
01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.610
not needing to worry about what I was going to do because the job I was going to

1044
01:02:29.611 --> 01:02:33.600
do hadn't even been invented yet.
That's a great thing to say.

1045
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:36.240
And it's like totally true.
My career,

1046
01:02:36.241 --> 01:02:40.650
like there was never a job description for what I did.
I made it up and got some,

1047
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:45.710
somebody agreed that that was a thing of the thing which I remember for like a

1048
01:02:46.231 --> 01:02:49.310
long time I was like super freaked out that people are going to realize like,
no,

1049
01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:52.170
wait,
this isn't a thing at all.
Why are we paying you?

1050
01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:57.060
Like we're just going to stop.
I'm like,
and you know,

1051
01:02:57.930 --> 01:03:01.680
the interesting jobs are the ones that you make up.
Um,
I think,

1052
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:04.500
and that's something I certainly hope to instill in my son is like,

1053
01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:08.640
don't worry about what your job is going to do.
Things that you're interested in.

1054
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:13.410
And if you do them really well,
you're going to find a way to temper them with,

1055
01:03:13.411 --> 01:03:15.240
with some good business opportunity.

1056
01:03:15.241 --> 01:03:18.780
And that was the other thing he taught me was at some point he,

1057
01:03:18.781 --> 01:03:20.970
for as much value as you're trying to create in the world,

1058
01:03:20.971 --> 01:03:24.180
you need to capture some of that value tube so that you can do more of that.

1059
01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:29.190
And you know,
I,
I suppose today I'm just trying to strive for that.

1060
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:34.620
Um,
so he gave me a lot of freedom to,
uh,
you know,
it was absolutely,

1061
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:39.780
he gave me the ability to take risks that seem totally nuts.

1062
01:03:39.781 --> 01:03:41.490
Like the fact that I,
I gave up,

1063
01:03:41.491 --> 01:03:46.200
what do most people look like giving up on nearly nine years of advanced

1064
01:03:46.201 --> 01:03:50.370
education,
um,
to go become a cook.
Like to most people,

1065
01:03:50.371 --> 01:03:54.810
like I had gone insane.
Like that made zero sense whatsoever.
Like,

1066
01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:58.560
you're going to throw away all your degrees,
your phd track to go be a cook.

1067
01:03:58.561 --> 01:04:02.310
Like what,
what the Hell is wrong with you?
And he's like,
go do it.

1068
01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:07.140
Like totally reasonable thing to go do.
There was never that judgment on the tee.

1069
01:04:07.141 --> 01:04:11.580
Also have an atypical career path.
Um,
somewhat.
Yeah.

1070
01:04:11.610 --> 01:04:16.590
Pretty Atypical.
I mean,
uh,
so like there's stories of my parents.

1071
01:04:16.591 --> 01:04:20.250
My parents met when my dad was in the peace corps and my mom was teaching in a

1072
01:04:20.251 --> 01:04:23.940
convent school in Grenada.
She was no longer a nun,
but you know,

1073
01:04:23.970 --> 01:04:27.540
jokes and sue here,
she'd been in none for seven years.
Um,

1074
01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:31.610
and of course like being a nun in Grenada,
not a bad gig.
So you know,

1075
01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:36.570
that was formative for him.
And you know,
he came from,

1076
01:04:36.690 --> 01:04:39.750
I mean I've literally seen the house he was born in,
which had a dirt floor.

1077
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:43.290
Like he was the alien in the family who had a perfect sat,

1078
01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:47.340
which got him into university Chicago and a free ride.
And like,
you know,

1079
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:52.080
I think he was always striving to make that pay off.

1080
01:04:52.110 --> 01:04:54.400
And interestingly,

1081
01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:57.360
he never really took the traditional path all the way to,

1082
01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:01.860
he founded his own business doing research for,
came out of the ad world.

1083
01:05:01.861 --> 01:05:06.000
And so he started doing research for fortune 100 brands globally and he founded

1084
01:05:06.001 --> 01:05:09.090
his business and Albuquerque,
New Mexico and made that work.

1085
01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:11.820
And it was only possible because by 1990,
you know,

1086
01:05:11.821 --> 01:05:15.510
a fax machine and a million miles a year on American Airlines made such a thing

1087
01:05:15.511 --> 01:05:18.530
possible.
But it worked and it gave us,
you know,

1088
01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:23.540
I wish that my mom working as a nurse paid the bills all the way through the 90s

1089
01:05:23.801 --> 01:05:28.270
and gave us the opportunity to take a few more risks,
um,
as,

1090
01:05:28.271 --> 01:05:32.440
as I got into college and beyond.
How did your mom respond?
Also supportive.

1091
01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:33.850
That was by my parents.

1092
01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:38.110
I think my parents had a pretty good sense of who I was and you know,

1093
01:05:38.290 --> 01:05:41.620
stubborn obs,
I think they knew that saying,
you know,
yeah.

1094
01:05:42.110 --> 01:05:44.650
Like I'm going to do it either way,

1095
01:05:44.651 --> 01:05:49.030
so they might as well be supportive of it because like,
I've got to go do this.

1096
01:05:49.031 --> 01:05:52.570
I think they kind of thought it would have been a phase.

1097
01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:57.760
I don't think they were.
Maybe it is just a really,
it could be.
Um,

1098
01:05:58.050 --> 01:06:01.420
um,
I'm nearly 40.
I had to grow up,
um,
pretty soon,

1099
01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:06.610
but they,
uh,
they actually were reasonably encouraging it,
but they're like,

1100
01:06:06.611 --> 01:06:09.310
you know,
you're going to learn a lot.
This will be interesting.

1101
01:06:09.311 --> 01:06:12.910
And I think what was really good and from their perspectives are good.

1102
01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:14.410
They couldn't help me in that area.

1103
01:06:14.411 --> 01:06:17.950
There wasn't like they could be supportive as parents.
Um,

1104
01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:21.130
they helped pay the credit card bill sometimes when it was getting outlandish

1105
01:06:21.131 --> 01:06:23.980
and I was totally burning a hole in the ground.
Um,

1106
01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:28.150
but beyond that they had no influence in whether I did well is that there was,

1107
01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:29.770
there was no net there,
there was no,

1108
01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:33.370
my parents had no influence in that world or couldn't pull any strings.

1109
01:06:33.371 --> 01:06:36.400
So it was all self earned,
which I think they felt was really good for me.

1110
01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:37.780
And I think it was,

1111
01:06:37.781 --> 01:06:41.890
I think it was like incredibly helpful to have those be your own achievements

1112
01:06:41.891 --> 01:06:44.740
and not welded.
My parents make this possible for me.

1113
01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:48.730
What are some of the lessons that,
uh,
that you took from,

1114
01:06:48.731 --> 01:06:53.470
or things you learned from Heston?
I mean any specific instances?
A few things,

1115
01:06:53.471 --> 01:06:53.791
but the,

1116
01:06:53.791 --> 01:06:58.791
the biggest thing by far was Heston taught me what the standard of excellence

1117
01:06:58.811 --> 01:07:03.730
really is.
He always was pushing for the,
the last bit of,

1118
01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:07.840
of,
of effort,
always a saying,
no,
we can move the goalpost,
we can do better.

1119
01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:12.130
And he kept raising the bar on the team,
on the recipes,
on everything.

1120
01:07:12.131 --> 01:07:16.480
And it was never,
he wasn't,
by the time I got there,
I'd heard in the early days,

1121
01:07:16.610 --> 01:07:19.180
uh,
you know,
there was,
there was quite a bit of a temper about it,

1122
01:07:19.181 --> 01:07:22.930
but by the time I got there,
he didn't yell.
Um,

1123
01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:28.630
and you know,
he signaled disappointment in other ways,
but he really pushed you,

1124
01:07:28.631 --> 01:07:33.250
the team,
everyone else to strive for excellence all the time.

1125
01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:36.970
How did he signaled disappointment and other way?
While I can,
I can give you my,

1126
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.760
my one canonical example,
which was,

1127
01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:44.590
I remember I was on Garmin,
Jay,
I was doing,

1128
01:07:44.591 --> 01:07:47.530
sending out one of the Hedy,
explain what that is.
That's a,

1129
01:07:47.531 --> 01:07:50.920
it's the section called section in traditional kitchen parlance,

1130
01:07:50.921 --> 01:07:54.490
but I was responsible for sending out several of the first courses that people

1131
01:07:54.491 --> 01:07:59.320
got.
So the red cabbage Gazpacho,
the famous quail jelly with,
with,
uh,

1132
01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:03.310
truffle toast.
I'm forgetting now.

1133
01:08:03.311 --> 01:08:06.250
Some of the things that were on the section,
I would send out the pre desserts.

1134
01:08:06.330 --> 01:08:08.290
Um,
and there was a few things on the,

1135
01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:12.100
on the Allah cart menu that the fat duck had at the time because I had the deep

1136
01:08:12.101 --> 01:08:16.460
fryer,
I would have to do that pig's head terrain,
I would do the radish.
Uh,
and,

1137
01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.151
and some of these,

1138
01:08:17.151 --> 01:08:20.750
it was actually a plus prepare the stocks and a whole bunch of other stuff.

1139
01:08:20.751 --> 01:08:24.410
It was,
uh,
it was,
uh,
wasn't the most technically demanding section,

1140
01:08:24.411 --> 01:08:26.810
but is it Easton?
He was grand central station.

1141
01:08:26.811 --> 01:08:28.580
And so there was a beast of a job in that regard.

1142
01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:34.150
So I remember this would have been 2003,

1143
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:37.010
early when I was actually still stodgy.

1144
01:08:37.011 --> 01:08:40.700
And it was before I had founded the fat tech experimental kitchen and had sort

1145
01:08:40.701 --> 01:08:42.740
of earned the right to,
to fuck up a little.

1146
01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:48.130
I sent out a quail jelly that was for Swania VIP guest and I'd remembered I'd

1147
01:08:50.691 --> 01:08:54.740
gotten the orders in early during the afternoon that we were going to have some

1148
01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:59.570
VIP days in and I needed to prepare some of our VIP versions of the Quail Jelly.

1149
01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:03.590
And so I prepared them.
But it was actually,

1150
01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.390
I didn't get to it in time,

1151
01:09:05.391 --> 01:09:08.540
so I think I probably started doing it like three in the afternoon for like a

1152
01:09:08.541 --> 01:09:12.230
seven 30 scene.
Well,
it hadn't set up.
So there's a,
the,

1153
01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:14.360
essentially the dish has a,
uh,

1154
01:09:14.361 --> 01:09:18.320
a pea puree very smooth on the bottom that that sets a little firm.

1155
01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:21.980
And then we set the cubes of truffle and a baby turnip into it.

1156
01:09:21.981 --> 01:09:26.080
And then there was an intense quail stock that's cat that poured over it and

1157
01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:26.923
allowed to set.

1158
01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:30.260
And then we put a langoustine cream on top and we chase them truffles and it's

1159
01:09:30.261 --> 01:09:33.920
served with a little tiny bit of toast with truffle butter on it,

1160
01:09:33.921 --> 01:09:38.840
black truffles and some radishes.
And the order came on for it.

1161
01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:42.800
And I saw that they weren't fully set up and I tried to float the langoustine

1162
01:09:42.801 --> 01:09:46.310
cream on top anyway and I sent them out to the past knowing that they,

1163
01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:50.150
they weren't perfect.
Those things came back like a boomerang.

1164
01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:53.990
Heston just came around the corner holding them in his hand and just goes,
Chris,

1165
01:09:54.330 --> 01:09:57.830
he's like looking at me and then he's looking at the dish and he's looking at me

1166
01:09:57.831 --> 01:10:01.910
and he's looking at the dish and just not a chance.
Puts it back.

1167
01:10:01.911 --> 01:10:04.910
And as you remember,
the withering look like if I ever did that again,

1168
01:10:04.911 --> 01:10:09.260
don't show up again.
Like,
and I remember the lesson because he's like,
we like,

1169
01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:12.380
we can do something else.
Like if it's not ready,

1170
01:10:12.381 --> 01:10:16.400
we're not going to send it out and just hope they don't notice that it's not

1171
01:10:16.401 --> 01:10:19.220
that good.
Like,
we'll fix it,
we'll do something else,

1172
01:10:19.221 --> 01:10:23.420
but don't try to slip by something that you know is below the standard.

1173
01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:26.660
And it was like,
you only need that lesson once that it's like,

1174
01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:31.400
that wasn't the standard.
And you know what the standard is,
hold the standard,
um,

1175
01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:35.990
you know,
ask for help.
Fix it.
Do whatever's necessary but,
but don't cheat.

1176
01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:37.970
That should be your tee shirt.
Hold the standard.

1177
01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:44.150
I don't know that I need to be encouraged and Kylie and that behavior.
Um,

1178
01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:44.991
because there's,

1179
01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:47.780
there's another side to it where you just become a tyrant about it.

1180
01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.430
You try to push a team too far,

1181
01:10:49.431 --> 01:10:54.110
you try to raise the standards too fast and then you just end up like you turned

1182
01:10:54.111 --> 01:10:56.210
into an asshole basically if you go too far.

1183
01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:00.230
So you're managing people now and what we'll get to that but just to,

1184
01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:03.590
just to give people maybe a foreshadowing or a taste of things to come.

1185
01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.910
This is something I struggle with a lot.
How do you manage that fine line?

1186
01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:12.590
Because I would like to think,
and I do think that I have very,

1187
01:11:12.591 --> 01:11:14.370
very high standards sometimes.

1188
01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:16.980
<v 2>I think they're so exacting that they drive people insane.</v>

1189
01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:21.030
And to the extent that in the publishing world I am considered a,

1190
01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:24.330
a problem author as they would say,
just because I don't,

1191
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:27.620
if something comes to the version of my pass,
like,
okay,

1192
01:11:27.621 --> 01:11:30.320
we're going to put this on the cover or this on the back flap or this and this

1193
01:11:30.321 --> 01:11:34.540
and it's not to my standards.
I just,
I don't,
I cannot allow it.

1194
01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:39.400
Um,
but when I'm managing people,
I,
some people can handle it,

1195
01:11:39.401 --> 01:11:40.151
some people can't.

1196
01:11:40.151 --> 01:11:45.151
But I do think there's a lot of onus on me also to decide how far is too far and

1197
01:11:45.161 --> 01:11:48.790
how far is not enough.
How do you,
how do you think about managing that?

1198
01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:51.690
<v 3>I think I'm still trying to think about it and figure it out.
Um,</v>

1199
01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:55.600
on my good days I think I manage it okay.

1200
01:11:55.900 --> 01:12:00.430
On my bad days.
Like I sort of feel like I had a personal failure,

1201
01:12:00.431 --> 01:12:04.420
that I didn't manage it all that well.
Um,
when it's,

1202
01:12:04.421 --> 01:12:09.421
especially when it's in the context of you're trying to do something really hard

1203
01:12:09.490 --> 01:12:14.490
and you've got the whole company leveraged out on this working and you have as a

1204
01:12:15.531 --> 01:12:19.060
CEO or as,
as you,
in case of your personal brand,

1205
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:22.110
you have total visibility into everything.

1206
01:12:22.111 --> 01:12:25.680
And so that's the first thing is I tried on a good day,

1207
01:12:25.681 --> 01:12:29.910
I will try to step back and say like,
what context does this person even have?

1208
01:12:30.210 --> 01:12:33.510
And if I have provided appropriate context,
if I approach,

1209
01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:38.600
if I provided appropriate context and they knew that context and they made a bad

1210
01:12:38.731 --> 01:12:39.564
decision,

1211
01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:43.230
it's an open question of whether you need to have a discussion of whether that

1212
01:12:43.231 --> 01:12:47.220
was a bad decision or,
you know,
actually it's a bad decision,

1213
01:12:47.221 --> 01:12:49.140
but given all the context they had,

1214
01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:52.740
maybe I would've made the same decision or I could have imagined somebody else.

1215
01:12:52.770 --> 01:12:57.750
Um,
so increasingly I tried to find myself thinking about what context and

1216
01:12:57.751 --> 01:13:00.290
visibility do I have and what do they have and do a,

1217
01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:04.830
am I basically being unfair because I'm operating from a greater set of

1218
01:13:04.831 --> 01:13:06.940
information,
right?
Um,

1219
01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:13.400
that's still like means I screw up more often than not because I have a strong

1220
01:13:14.071 --> 01:13:16.260
bias towards let's fix the problem right now.

1221
01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:21.320
And that also usually can be quite ham handed where all I'm really training them

1222
01:13:21.781 --> 01:13:24.300
to do is read my mind to try to guess what I want.

1223
01:13:24.301 --> 01:13:28.380
And that's not going to work very well in terms of how we run the company or the

1224
01:13:28.381 --> 01:13:33.270
types of products we need to do.
Where Aye
work with elite people.

1225
01:13:33.271 --> 01:13:36.660
I work with people who are experienced in among the very best at what they do

1226
01:13:36.661 --> 01:13:38.340
and I will do a much better job in the team,

1227
01:13:38.341 --> 01:13:42.420
will much do a better job if we can take the time to set context and to

1228
01:13:42.421 --> 01:13:44.360
basically,
if there's a problem,

1229
01:13:44.361 --> 01:13:48.320
say let's look at how we can solve that differently rather than me just saying

1230
01:13:48.321 --> 01:13:50.210
we're going to do x.
That said,

1231
01:13:50.211 --> 01:13:53.470
there are times where like you need to take the scissors away.
Um,

1232
01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:57.500
because we're all running really fast and like we do not need to impale

1233
01:13:57.501 --> 01:13:59.060
ourselves out of stupidity.

1234
01:13:59.061 --> 01:14:03.620
So it's a dynamic thing and I'm still trying to figure that out quite honestly.

1235
01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:09.020
<v 2>So you're holding the standard holding oneself and others to a high standard.</v>

1236
01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:13.000
That's one thing that you got from,
from Huston.
What else comes to mind?

1237
01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:16.170
Asking why?
Asking questions?
Um,

1238
01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.450
<v 3>challenging,
perceived or conventional wisdom?
Uh,</v>

1239
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:25.700
I've never seen somebody as curious about him who could talk to just about

1240
01:14:25.730 --> 01:14:30.320
anyone else,
about whatever it was they did,
what they were an expert,

1241
01:14:30.321 --> 01:14:35.300
whether they were a psychologist or a sports trainer or an athlete or another

1242
01:14:35.301 --> 01:14:39.890
chef or uh,
uh,
some,
some food expert of some sort or,

1243
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:40.820
or a writer.

1244
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:45.590
He had this unbelievable ability to sort of ask them incredible questions and

1245
01:14:45.591 --> 01:14:49.540
then sort of process it through his brain to have ideas that like,

1246
01:14:49.541 --> 01:14:52.450
I literally couldn't imagine having ever had that idea.

1247
01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:56.670
And so I think that really put me on a path towards being,

1248
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:58.560
just really being curious,

1249
01:14:58.561 --> 01:15:03.080
wanting to understand what all these things were about and then using those as

1250
01:15:03.081 --> 01:15:07.250
creative tools of how do I take those kinds of ideas and apply them in my world.

1251
01:15:07.890 --> 01:15:12.360
<v 2>What are,
do any specific examples come to mind of,</v>

1252
01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:16.530
uh,
a question he used?

1253
01:15:16.590 --> 01:15:21.590
A lot or just a particular commonly held assumption that,

1254
01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:25.250
that he tested and I am of course,

1255
01:15:25.251 --> 01:15:29.030
thinking of the TV show where he did this quite a bit,
uh,

1256
01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:32.600
which I I enjoyed tremendously.
We might chat about that,
but anything,

1257
01:15:32.601 --> 01:15:35.000
anything in particular come to mind?
I mean,
and,
and the reason I ask,

1258
01:15:35.001 --> 01:15:39.140
so I'll give just as context.
Uh,
so for instance,

1259
01:15:39.141 --> 01:15:42.260
there are questions that some people are very well known for.
Uh,
but these are,

1260
01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:45.110
these are quite public facing,
like Peter Teal,
right?
And you know,
what,

1261
01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:46.400
why can't you,

1262
01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:49.700
why can't you hit your 10 year goals in the next six months in to these kind of

1263
01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:53.930
absurd forcing function type questions,
uh,
in what is something,

1264
01:15:53.931 --> 01:15:54.920
and I'm paraphrasing here,
but like,

1265
01:15:54.921 --> 01:15:58.280
what is something that you believe that other people think is insane,
you know,

1266
01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:00.720
roughly that type of stuff.
Um,

1267
01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:05.760
question that I ask of experts very often is,
you know,
who is good at this?

1268
01:16:05.761 --> 01:16:06.770
Who shouldn't be.
Okay.

1269
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.330
Who doesn't have the attributes say of like a Michael Phelps who nonetheless as

1270
01:16:10.331 --> 01:16:13.180
an incredible sweater,
whatever that might be.
Any,

1271
01:16:13.181 --> 01:16:16.210
any kind of long held truth that you saw him test or,

1272
01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:19.340
or questions that come to mind?
Well,
so there,
you know,
there's certain

1273
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:22.680
<v 3>me,
a lot of culinary Laura,
I know he challenged in that influenced the,</v>

1274
01:16:22.681 --> 01:16:26.510
the techniques.
Um,
I think the more interesting things were,

1275
01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:28.980
I don't remember a specific question.

1276
01:16:28.981 --> 01:16:33.981
What I do remember what were two specific things where Heston was remarkable.

1277
01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:39.300
It asking people in different ways but getting to the same end result of like

1278
01:16:39.301 --> 01:16:43.890
what interesting thing are you working on?
Like why is that interesting to you?

1279
01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:48.570
What surprising about that is anybody else thinking about this?

1280
01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:50.870
He had just this unbelievable ability to do anything.

1281
01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:55.260
I can give a specific example.
Um,
there was a psychologist at Oxford,

1282
01:16:55.261 --> 01:17:00.261
Charles Spence that Heston had a conversation with who had done some interesting

1283
01:17:01.081 --> 01:17:03.810
sensory research on juxtaposing temperatures.

1284
01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:08.620
Like Charles had created this a little tool,

1285
01:17:08.621 --> 01:17:12.590
this little instrument that was basically like a,
like a radiator,

1286
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:15.500
like a home radiator.
But uniquely what it did is it,

1287
01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:19.910
it was about hand sized and it would juxtapose hot and cold temperature right

1288
01:17:19.911 --> 01:17:23.180
next to each other.
And you would think that like,
oh,

1289
01:17:23.181 --> 01:17:26.570
you feel hot and cold kind of next to each other,
you sort of get warm.
Right?

1290
01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:30.620
But like under certain circumstances,
like no,
that's,
that's not what you get.

1291
01:17:30.621 --> 01:17:34.880
You get really weird sensations because the brain is not equipped to process

1292
01:17:34.881 --> 01:17:37.520
this contrast in temperature so closely placed together.

1293
01:17:37.521 --> 01:17:41.750
And that was like what Charles was doing research on somehow.

1294
01:17:41.751 --> 01:17:45.170
And so Heston dug into that.
Why is that interesting?
Why is that surprising?

1295
01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:48.080
And then what?
I don't know how he,
he did,

1296
01:17:48.081 --> 01:17:52.400
I think that's what makes him uniquely Heston was he came back with like,

1297
01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:54.770
oh well when that be really interesting.
If somehow we could,

1298
01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:56.510
we could do that in a dish.
What if,

1299
01:17:56.810 --> 01:18:01.810
what if we could juxtapose two temperatures together somehow in a drink?

1300
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:06.560
And I remember him,
this was right when I started working on a,

1301
01:18:06.561 --> 01:18:11.120
a on new dishes nominally as the fat tech experimental kitchen.

1302
01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:13.970
Um,
in fact,
I don't even think we named it that yet.

1303
01:18:13.971 --> 01:18:15.800
I think it was just Chris did experiments in a,

1304
01:18:15.801 --> 01:18:18.130
in a little shed in the back garden of the restaurant.

1305
01:18:18.150 --> 01:18:22.790
I think that's what it was.
And that dish became,
it was one of these things,

1306
01:18:22.791 --> 01:18:23.151
I'm like,
Hey,

1307
01:18:23.151 --> 01:18:25.940
I have this idea that we could make a drink somehow that would put hot and cold

1308
01:18:25.941 --> 01:18:27.950
together.
Like go do something with that.

1309
01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:33.200
And like that was a super weird idea and I'm going to be like,
you know,
like,

1310
01:18:33.201 --> 01:18:36.410
do you mean layered like you know,
cold on bottom,
half the time he's like,
no,
no,

1311
01:18:36.411 --> 01:18:39.890
no.
They have to be vertical.
Like they have to be vertically juxtapose on like,

1312
01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:43.790
how the hell am I supposed to,
like,
like what am I supposed to do with that?

1313
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:45.103
But at the end result,

1314
01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:49.700
I actually developed hot and cold tea and using a technology called fluid gels.

1315
01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:52.020
And I juxtaposed uh,
uh,

1316
01:18:52.110 --> 01:18:55.790
hot Earl grey tea of first it was t and then has to came in and it's going to be

1317
01:18:55.791 --> 01:18:57.530
ice tea and it's going to be Earl grey tea.

1318
01:18:57.531 --> 01:19:00.330
And these are the flavor notes we need to get and this is,

1319
01:19:00.970 --> 01:19:03.410
and essentially I'd shown that we could,

1320
01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:06.620
we could basically put a divider and a cop and we could pour this hot liquid on

1321
01:19:06.621 --> 01:19:07.011
one time,

1322
01:19:07.011 --> 01:19:10.130
this cold liquid and the other and because of the unique properties of this

1323
01:19:10.131 --> 01:19:10.821
fluid gel,

1324
01:19:10.821 --> 01:19:14.480
I could pull the divider out and if you whisked it to the table in a few
minutes,

1325
01:19:14.690 --> 01:19:18.650
the person could sip it and all the t on the right side of their mouth would be

1326
01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:22.970
piping hot Earl grey tea and all the t on the left side of their mouth would be

1327
01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:25.880
ice cold and you'd get that effect.

1328
01:19:25.881 --> 01:19:29.330
You'd get this like your hair would kind of stand back up and like the side of

1329
01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:33.200
your face that had the cold liquid in it felt like as heavy as concrete and the

1330
01:19:33.201 --> 01:19:35.660
side of your face with the hot liquid just felt like it disappeared.

1331
01:19:35.890 --> 01:19:37.670
It's like a super weird effect.

1332
01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:41.090
So like perfect one or for like you're having a stroke but don't have the time.

1333
01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:44.540
Basically I have,
I have some fat dot cotton gold tea.

1334
01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:48.260
But it was just that thought process of you can have this conversation with a

1335
01:19:48.261 --> 01:19:52.820
psychologist and have this inspiration for a dish where I might have had that

1336
01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:55.040
same conversation and been like,
oh,
that's an interesting effect.

1337
01:19:55.041 --> 01:20:00.041
But like I di I w I don't think I would have drawn that path of here's the idea,

1338
01:20:00.201 --> 01:20:03.620
here's what we can do with that.
And he had this ability to talk to anyone in,

1339
01:20:03.621 --> 01:20:06.140
pull those ideas out in the little,
you know,
a lot of them failed.

1340
01:20:06.141 --> 01:20:09.300
A lot of them went nowhere,
but enough of them hit that.
You're like,
wow,

1341
01:20:09.301 --> 01:20:12.730
that's like actually super impressive.
Um,

1342
01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:16.260
I don't see anybody else doing that.
I see a lot of people copying.

1343
01:20:16.530 --> 01:20:20.730
I don't see a lot of people finding those original sources for inspiration and

1344
01:20:20.731 --> 01:20:21.570
doing something unique.

1345
01:20:21.571 --> 01:20:24.660
And I think that really stuck with me and it's something I strive for in my work

1346
01:20:24.661 --> 01:20:29.150
of,
you know,
how do we challenge that?
How do we question and,
and,

1347
01:20:29.151 --> 01:20:32.670
and do something that isn't copying,
that's novel.
And that's inventive.

1348
01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:36.330
Let's flash forward to chef steps.

1349
01:20:36.930 --> 01:20:41.930
How has shift steps changed over time and what are some of the novel decisions

1350
01:20:42.930 --> 01:20:47.790
that you've made?
And could you describe what it is?
So chef steps is a,
uh,

1351
01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:49.410
a cooking technology company.

1352
01:20:49.411 --> 01:20:54.411
Specifically we make kitchen hardware that is controlled with mobile devices,

1353
01:20:54.961 --> 01:20:56.010
but really the,

1354
01:20:56.910 --> 01:21:01.500
the way we think about it is we're building devices that allow us to augment

1355
01:21:01.501 --> 01:21:04.290
people's intuitions in the kitchen to make them more successful.

1356
01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:09.660
There's so many things in the kitchen where you're sort of thwarted in terms of

1357
01:21:09.661 --> 01:21:12.150
getting the outcome you want because the technology sucks.

1358
01:21:12.150 --> 01:21:13.110
So if you think about it,

1359
01:21:13.111 --> 01:21:17.690
like you use your oven and should I set the oven at three 50 or four 15?

1360
01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:20.610
Is it going to be an hour or is it going to be 30 minutes?
Um,

1361
01:21:20.611 --> 01:21:25.320
and like why does it work in this one of them,
but not in this other oven.

1362
01:21:25.410 --> 01:21:28.560
And the answer's like,
ovens totally suck as a technology.

1363
01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:32.970
You're not even controlling the variables that really matter and what really

1364
01:21:32.971 --> 01:21:34.050
sucks about them.
And frankly,

1365
01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:38.220
every other tool we have in the kitchen is that we have to translate our human

1366
01:21:38.221 --> 01:21:41.730
desires into engineering parameters that we don't necessarily understand.

1367
01:21:41.970 --> 01:21:43.770
Even though that's not what we care about.
We care about,

1368
01:21:43.771 --> 01:21:46.880
I want a great roast chicken to have with my family,
or I want to have this,

1369
01:21:46.881 --> 01:21:51.881
this unbelievable experience of 72 hour short rib or I want to cook some amazing

1370
01:21:52.471 --> 01:21:53.304
vegetables.

1371
01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:58.820
And it's like sort of mind blowing to me that technology sucks that bad in in

1372
01:21:59.371 --> 01:22:03.900
2016 so chef steps as a company that's trying to solve those problems and we

1373
01:22:03.901 --> 01:22:06.480
sort of realized that nobody else was going to do it.

1374
01:22:06.481 --> 01:22:07.890
So we were going to have to build a hardware,

1375
01:22:07.891 --> 01:22:10.230
we were going to have to do artificial intelligence work,

1376
01:22:10.231 --> 01:22:11.620
we were going to have to build mobile app,

1377
01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:14.040
we are going to have to combine it with content and we were going to have to

1378
01:22:14.041 --> 01:22:16.530
combine it with community because that was the only way we were gonna be able to

1379
01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:19.650
bring it to market because nobody else in the world knows how to sell a device

1380
01:22:19.651 --> 01:22:24.240
like this.
So like,
I don't know that we fully understood that in 2012,

1381
01:22:24.241 --> 01:22:28.950
but we sort of knew that we had to go on our own unique journey and we knew we

1382
01:22:28.951 --> 01:22:32.340
needed a lot of independence and not a lot of outside people telling us how

1383
01:22:32.341 --> 01:22:36.030
we're supposed to build a company.
And you know,

1384
01:22:36.031 --> 01:22:39.740
so I think Matt Mullenweg said it best when he,
you know,
we first got to know,
uh,

1385
01:22:39.810 --> 01:22:41.930
I first got to know him and he,
you know,

1386
01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:43.440
got to know a little bit about chefs and he's like,

1387
01:22:43.441 --> 01:22:46.140
chefs test makes no sense to me.
You know,
I,

1388
01:22:46.150 --> 01:22:49.430
I sort of felt like I was making progress when about a year and a half ago.
Man.

1389
01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:51.960
It's like,
well,
that makes half cents now.
Um,

1390
01:22:52.410 --> 01:22:57.090
I think in 2016 we now actually know how it makes sense and how we'll do the

1391
01:22:57.091 --> 01:22:58.470
other job of running a business,

1392
01:22:58.471 --> 01:23:00.750
of making sure we make money and we can keep growing.

1393
01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:05.620
But it was this wandering path towards if we create a place in a culture where

1394
01:23:05.621 --> 01:23:08.770
we can put people who are passionate about cooking and passionate about

1395
01:23:08.771 --> 01:23:11.290
technology and passionate about inventing the future,
but who,

1396
01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:15.070
who are disciplined and experience and have a track record of getting shit done

1397
01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:19.300
and we create a culture that doesn't fuck them up or put them under a bunch of

1398
01:23:19.301 --> 01:23:21.010
managers who don't know what the fuck they're doing,

1399
01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:24.730
then we can create a company that nobody else could build.
And that was really,

1400
01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.810
we've evolved over the,

1401
01:23:25.811 --> 01:23:29.410
over the years we started out mostly as a bunch of guys putting shit on Youtube

1402
01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:33.760
and now you know the beautiful videos,
that beautiful videos,
but like,
okay,

1403
01:23:33.761 --> 01:23:36.160
how are we going to monetize that?
Well we're not going to monetize the videos,

1404
01:23:36.161 --> 01:23:40.540
but they built us a community and that community steered us in the direction of

1405
01:23:40.541 --> 01:23:42.550
what are the types of problems we can solve.

1406
01:23:42.850 --> 01:23:45.730
And we sort of looked around and originally said,
well,

1407
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.460
maybe we'll just do the software and let's see if we can get some hardware

1408
01:23:48.461 --> 01:23:52.120
companies that get this vision and could do the hardware side of things.

1409
01:23:52.121 --> 01:23:56.380
And that was just beating our head against a wall.
So we're like,
well screw it,

1410
01:23:56.381 --> 01:24:00.670
we're going to do the hardware to,
um,
there's a lot of Hubris along the way.
Well,

1411
01:24:00.671 --> 01:24:04.030
you know,
there's that fine line between the necessary,
uh,

1412
01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:08.740
irrational exuberance and confidence and needed to actually kind of step off the

1413
01:24:08.741 --> 01:24:11.940
cliff and build the wings on the way down and really good and Hubris that all

1414
01:24:11.950 --> 01:24:14.120
make you self implode.
The,

1415
01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:19.770
the question I had was Q stage left reappearance of Gabe Newell.
Yeah.
Uh,

1416
01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:24.810
how has he influenced the trajectory or you and the company and who,

1417
01:24:25.871 --> 01:24:27.190
who is he?
Maybe we could start,
well,

1418
01:24:27.191 --> 01:24:32.191
so Gabe Newell is the founder and I think he calls himself CEO,

1419
01:24:32.291 --> 01:24:36.550
managing director of something or other valve.
Um,
I mean to us,
gave just gay,

1420
01:24:36.551 --> 01:24:41.350
but what is valve valve is the biggest soft,
well,
so electric car,

1421
01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:43.510
I think electronic arts is actually the biggest software company,

1422
01:24:43.511 --> 01:24:48.130
but valve essentially is by far the most unique company in the video game space.

1423
01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:52.870
A string of huge hits that redefined what video games could be.

1424
01:24:53.410 --> 01:24:56.980
They then basically realize they needed a better way of distributing games to

1425
01:24:56.981 --> 01:25:01.540
get there,
get control of their intellectual property back from like publishers,

1426
01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:05.410
uh,
in,
in the early two thousands.
And they built steam.
And steam is I believe,

1427
01:25:05.411 --> 01:25:07.720
the biggest online marketplace for video games.

1428
01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:11.590
And that's what's really made valve a,
a force to be reckoned with.

1429
01:25:11.591 --> 01:25:13.150
So it was like the iTunes of yoga.

1430
01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:16.530
It was really the iTunes before there was an iTunes for video games.
Um,

1431
01:25:16.810 --> 01:25:21.040
but valve was really a company that has gamers at its heart and focuses on

1432
01:25:21.041 --> 01:25:25.000
solving problems for,
for video gamers or people that create video games.

1433
01:25:25.001 --> 01:25:28.690
And they built an,
uh,
uh,
an entirely private,
um,

1434
01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:30.900
unbelievable business.
Um,

1435
01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:34.560
that has some very unorthodox ways of operating where,
you know,

1436
01:25:34.670 --> 01:25:37.120
nobody's your boss,
nobody tells you what to work on,

1437
01:25:37.121 --> 01:25:41.400
you've got to figure that out for yourself and,
and sort of self organize.
Um,

1438
01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:45.160
and now they're doing unbelievable work in the hardware space,

1439
01:25:45.161 --> 01:25:49.000
particularly in virtual reality with uh,
the HTC vive,

1440
01:25:49.001 --> 01:25:51.130
which was really technology developed by valve.

1441
01:25:51.131 --> 01:25:54.280
And so I think what Gabe did for us,

1442
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:58.510
aside from being incredibly hands off,
was two things.
One,

1443
01:25:59.160 --> 01:25:59.650
um,

1444
01:25:59.650 --> 01:26:04.650
he gave us access to capital and a very unusual way that allowed us to be in

1445
01:26:05.631 --> 01:26:09.170
control of our own destiny.
And he did very,

1446
01:26:09.171 --> 01:26:13.490
very little beyond that except occasionally asking us questions about what types

1447
01:26:13.491 --> 01:26:16.820
of problems we are solving,
how we might think about a certain problem,

1448
01:26:16.821 --> 01:26:19.950
but this would be very,
very general.
Um,

1449
01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:23.420
and based on the types of things we would feed back of we're thinking about this

1450
01:26:23.421 --> 01:26:24.470
or we're trying to solve this problem,

1451
01:26:24.530 --> 01:26:28.430
he kind of made a decision of whether he was going to keep extending a capital.

1452
01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:30.830
And we've kind of,
he's kind of gone on this journey with us,

1453
01:26:30.831 --> 01:26:34.940
but we see Gabe in a business capacity once or twice a year,

1454
01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:38.210
we usually have a talk for 15,
20 minutes and he might ask a question like,

1455
01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.990
how are you thinking about hiring people?
Like,
how do you hire people?

1456
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:44.900
Or how do you interview people?
Or like,

1457
01:26:44.901 --> 01:26:48.740
what's the role of content creators in the kitchen?
Like how does that work?

1458
01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:49.910
And he'll just ask questions.

1459
01:26:49.911 --> 01:26:52.540
Like in the early days it would totally randomize us.
We'd be like,

1460
01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:56.420
does gave mean like we should be doing virtual reality for the kitchen?
Like,
no,

1461
01:26:56.421 --> 01:26:59.480
he didn't mean that.
It's usually whatever he's thinking about.

1462
01:26:59.481 --> 01:27:02.210
And he's just kind of seeing like,
how is our team thinking about this?

1463
01:27:02.211 --> 01:27:05.990
What are the types of problems we're solving?
And,
you know,

1464
01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:07.160
do they make sense to him?

1465
01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:11.030
Can you talk about the unusual way in which he's giving you capital or is that

1466
01:27:11.210 --> 01:27:14.100
not something I can simply say he's a,
you know,

1467
01:27:14.150 --> 01:27:18.500
he's described himself as acting as a bank.
Gabe does not own any of chef steps.

1468
01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:21.080
Um,
he does not control how we run the company.

1469
01:27:21.081 --> 01:27:24.350
Chef steps is 100% owned by chef steps.
Um,

1470
01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:28.790
he's made it possible for us to,
to make some pretty big bets,

1471
01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:33.380
but he's also basically made it po,
you know,
kept us hungry.
So essentially he's,

1472
01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:34.910
he's provided us a very,

1473
01:27:34.911 --> 01:27:39.500
very favorable loan that we're welcome to payback when,
whenever we want.

1474
01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:43.160
And that,
uh,
doesn't have any terms that sort of turned it into,

1475
01:27:43.161 --> 01:27:44.780
I'm secretly going to control your company.

1476
01:27:44.781 --> 01:27:46.790
Like I think it was always clear you guys have to own your work.

1477
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:51.530
So Gabe has infinite levels of opportunities in front of them.

1478
01:27:51.710 --> 01:27:55.700
So why,
why would he,
why would he take the,
the time,
energy,

1479
01:27:55.701 --> 01:27:56.870
just bandwidth to do that?

1480
01:27:57.050 --> 01:28:01.670
So I really wish there was like some super awesome answer I could give you here.

1481
01:28:01.671 --> 01:28:04.340
I will tell you how I know gave and how this all went down.

1482
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.560
I first met Gabe because I auctioned off a Denver that I would,

1483
01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:11.910
I would cook at a whole dinner.
Yeah.

1484
01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:16.430
I auctioned off at dinner at a charity called friends of the children and gave

1485
01:28:16.431 --> 01:28:20.480
his wife Lisa,
uh,
purchase that dinner.
And uh,

1486
01:28:20.690 --> 01:28:24.410
so myself and a couple of colleagues from modernist cuisine at the time,

1487
01:28:24.411 --> 01:28:26.060
cause that's where I was working then,
uh,

1488
01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:30.980
we could get dinner at house and like apparently the dinner according to gave

1489
01:28:30.981 --> 01:28:34.400
the dinner was awesome and fun and we had liquid nitrogen and he's like,

1490
01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:38.540
this is like the one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.

1491
01:28:38.930 --> 01:28:42.380
And I know a lot of people in the world of food and lots of things.

1492
01:28:42.381 --> 01:28:45.290
I don't know anybody that talks and thinks about food the way you guys do.

1493
01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:48.560
And as he said,
like,
that was kind of like,

1494
01:28:48.561 --> 01:28:50.950
I didn't see gay for a very long time after there.
He thought,

1495
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:54.230
I thought it was just pretty nice.
I didn't really know who gave,

1496
01:28:54.231 --> 01:28:56.480
was actually I had no idea who it was and it wasn't,

1497
01:28:56.540 --> 01:29:00.860
it seems to work out well for you.
It wasn't a particularly like insane,

1498
01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:03.290
like it was a nice home,
but like it didn't,
you know,

1499
01:29:03.330 --> 01:29:07.530
suggest anything other than Gabe was a reasonably wealthy guy who was pretty

1500
01:29:07.531 --> 01:29:12.210
interesting and unusual and uh,
and low key.

1501
01:29:12.211 --> 01:29:16.280
And then I met him again because he's also friends with Neil Stevenson and,

1502
01:29:16.281 --> 01:29:18.300
and so I did that,
that event.

1503
01:29:18.301 --> 01:29:22.800
And so those were my two meetings with gay prior to the third meeting where

1504
01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:26.340
grant Crilly for modern cuisine,
Ryan,
Matthew Smith,

1505
01:29:26.370 --> 01:29:30.810
who was the photographer on modernist cuisine and myself plus a college friend

1506
01:29:30.811 --> 01:29:31.950
of mine,
Ed starboard,

1507
01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:36.240
we'd sort of started up a company called Dell that was a consulting company that

1508
01:29:36.241 --> 01:29:39.900
went on to become a,
the company it is today,
which is chef steps.

1509
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:41.700
And like,

1510
01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:45.660
we were self funding this and like rapidly running out of the,

1511
01:29:45.661 --> 01:29:50.500
not a lot of money we had.
And so we were going to do I a,

1512
01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:54.180
uh,
a cookbook and because of modernist cuisine,

1513
01:29:54.181 --> 01:29:57.390
a lot of publishers wanted to talk to us and we sort of went,
well,
we'll,

1514
01:29:57.391 --> 01:29:58.560
we'll give them the physical book,

1515
01:29:58.561 --> 01:30:00.480
but we want to do stuff with the digital stuff.

1516
01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:05.340
And we kept hitting this roadblock of like publishers were smart enough to say

1517
01:30:05.341 --> 01:30:06.660
we want the digital rights,

1518
01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:09.540
but like they had no idea what they wanted to do with it.

1519
01:30:09.541 --> 01:30:11.400
They were just smart enough and greedy enough to like,

1520
01:30:11.401 --> 01:30:14.190
we should totally ask for them.
So we're like,

1521
01:30:14.191 --> 01:30:17.730
well Gabe does a lot of stuff in and like digital video game publisher,

1522
01:30:17.731 --> 01:30:19.560
we should ask him like how he approached us.

1523
01:30:19.561 --> 01:30:23.040
And so we just asked to meet with him and we went over to valve and we're like,

1524
01:30:23.070 --> 01:30:25.650
we're doing this,
we're trying to do this book deal.

1525
01:30:25.651 --> 01:30:28.380
And we're like getting hung up on the digital publishing rights and how would

1526
01:30:28.381 --> 01:30:31.590
you like suggest we might think about this?
And he goes,

1527
01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:33.990
well I don't know anything about the book publishing world,

1528
01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:36.750
but I do know a lot about the video game publishing world.

1529
01:30:36.751 --> 01:30:40.140
And it's a terrible idea for creators to give their intellectual property away.

1530
01:30:40.410 --> 01:30:44.580
Why would you do that?
And we're like,
because we need the money.
He's like,

1531
01:30:45.330 --> 01:30:49.350
what if I gave you a quarter of $1 million right now?
And we're like,

1532
01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:51.330
and he's like,
no,
I'm serious.

1533
01:30:51.331 --> 01:30:53.490
And he pulls out his iPad and he students me an email right there,

1534
01:30:53.491 --> 01:30:58.491
says I will give you $250,000 Gabe and the money showed up the next day.

1535
01:30:59.131 --> 01:31:04.110
And we're like,
okay,
well I guess we're not doing the book.
Um,
and that was it.

1536
01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:06.660
And so it sort of incrementally came from there.

1537
01:31:07.230 --> 01:31:09.990
But it wasn't like games like you know,
the only,

1538
01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:14.660
and so a month or so later I think we had dinner and,

1539
01:31:14.890 --> 01:31:19.130
and this was like how naive we were.
We had dinner at Canlis in Seattle,
the,

1540
01:31:19.170 --> 01:31:22.230
because it was like super good at the time.
And Jason Friday was,

1541
01:31:22.231 --> 01:31:25.050
was the chef there and we're like,
we should go there.
And Games,

1542
01:31:25.090 --> 01:31:27.990
like I thought catalysts sucked and we're like,
no,
no,
it's,
it's really good now.

1543
01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:31.440
So we took him to cannolis and we're chatting,

1544
01:31:31.441 --> 01:31:34.200
we're chatting about the culinary world and he's just sort of trying to

1545
01:31:34.201 --> 01:31:37.770
understand how our world works and asking us questions like how we're thinking

1546
01:31:37.771 --> 01:31:42.720
about our business.
And so Gabe goes,
if I give you $100 million,

1547
01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:45.690
what would you guys go build that by building it?

1548
01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:50.520
Like there's no value for anyone copying you.
Like I'll give you an example.

1549
01:31:50.521 --> 01:31:53.670
Like Intel,
like when they go build a new chip Fab,

1550
01:31:53.671 --> 01:31:56.580
it's like billions and billions of dollars and there's no value in anybody else

1551
01:31:56.581 --> 01:32:00.070
copying it because not only do they have to spend like even more billions to

1552
01:32:00.071 --> 01:32:04.110
catch up,
but like that's been way more billions,
uh,

1553
01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:07.210
to basically learn everything else and tell knows about this and then they have

1554
01:32:07.211 --> 01:32:10.450
to be like 10 x better for anyone wanting to switch.
So it's like,

1555
01:32:10.451 --> 01:32:11.920
it's just a waste of everyone's time.

1556
01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:16.990
I sort of laughed that off at the time because like I had no serious answer to

1557
01:32:16.991 --> 01:32:19.780
it.
And really over the next two and a half,
three years,

1558
01:32:19.781 --> 01:32:21.250
that was us answering that question of like,

1559
01:32:21.251 --> 01:32:24.490
what's worth spending $100 million on in the kitchen space?
I mean,
the kitchens,

1560
01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:29.740
crazy,
valuable,
cooking's crazy valuable.
What can we go do that,
that like,

1561
01:32:29.770 --> 01:32:32.100
that makes sense.
And,
uh,
he,

1562
01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:35.980
he was patient enough for us to go on that journey before we're finally like,

1563
01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:37.810
okay,
we totally know how to answer that question.

1564
01:32:37.811 --> 01:32:40.840
Now we're going to go do this kind of stuff.
And he's like,
well,
that makes sense.

1565
01:32:40.841 --> 01:32:44.620
I'm on this train.
Seems like he's also,
I mean I've,
I've only sat in on one sure.

1566
01:32:44.621 --> 01:32:45.610
Meeting you guys had,

1567
01:32:45.611 --> 01:32:50.440
and this is anything confidential but seems very good at asking questions that

1568
01:32:50.441 --> 01:32:55.390
force you to hone in on what you are uniquely capable of doing as opposed to

1569
01:32:55.391 --> 01:32:59.950
trying to do two,
three,
four,
five different things simultaneously.

1570
01:32:59.950 --> 01:33:04.170
One of which is say cashflow motivated.
Yeah,
no,

1571
01:33:04.180 --> 01:33:07.690
he's never asked anything like that.
Um,
in fact,

1572
01:33:07.691 --> 01:33:11.410
he very strongly advised against premature monetization like that we would just

1573
01:33:11.411 --> 01:33:12.430
go do stupid shit.

1574
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:15.760
And he also sort of advised against running around raising a bunch of money

1575
01:33:15.761 --> 01:33:20.360
because it's a really low value use of our creative energies.
Um,
but,
but I'll,

1576
01:33:20.361 --> 01:33:23.260
I'll,
I'll rephrase your question.
What gives really good at like,
yes,

1577
01:33:23.261 --> 01:33:23.890
that's all to know.

1578
01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:27.130
What he's really good at is asking a question where you realize that the way you

1579
01:33:27.131 --> 01:33:29.330
answered it,
you are an imbecile.
Like,

1580
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:35.070
like I've just gotten used to basically feeling like I am a complete moron and

1581
01:33:35.171 --> 01:33:40.090
like I can't believe I just said that.
That makes no sense.
I'm like,

1582
01:33:40.210 --> 01:33:43.390
I moderately feel good now where I feel like I came out of a meeting and like,

1583
01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:47.960
like,
like gave isn't like mentally rolling his eyes from like the,
the,

1584
01:33:47.961 --> 01:33:51.040
the idiocy that I like that came out of my mouth.

1585
01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:56.800
And does that come about because he will question or ask questions to try to

1586
01:33:57.521 --> 01:34:00.730
clarify assumptions and then by speaking it out loud,
you're like,

1587
01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:02.620
that makes no fucking sense at all.
What I just said,

1588
01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:07.210
basically that it's his ability to sort of surface what the real issue is and be

1589
01:34:07.211 --> 01:34:09.970
like,
you weren't even looking at the real issue.
The real issue is this,

1590
01:34:09.971 --> 01:34:13.570
you don't look as good at that.
I mean,
I dunno,
uh,
you've,

1591
01:34:13.571 --> 01:34:15.970
you've spent a fair amount of time with Matt Mullenweg.

1592
01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:17.380
I think that's also very good at that.

1593
01:34:17.381 --> 01:34:21.030
And that's another person where I basically feel like a complete idiot.
Um,

1594
01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:25.690
I also think like,
I look to Matt and go,
I don't know how you know that.

1595
01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:29.200
Like I think Matt might be one of the best people I know at running a company

1596
01:34:29.201 --> 01:34:33.490
and how he,
how he builds people up.
I,
I aspire to be that good someday.
He a,

1597
01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:37.170
I remember Matt asked me at one point were a flying around,

1598
01:34:37.190 --> 01:34:40.750
we went to a few word camps together cause I use wordpress and uh,

1599
01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:42.820
you don't have since become an advisor to automatic.

1600
01:34:42.821 --> 01:34:44.020
But that's relatively recent.

1601
01:34:44.170 --> 01:34:49.170
And I was really worked up into a tizzy because there were a bunch of sites

1602
01:34:49.841 --> 01:34:52.460
sharing PDFs of the four hour workweek.
It's,

1603
01:34:52.490 --> 01:34:56.650
this must have been really early in my career as such,

1604
01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:58.010
like 2008 or so.
It was

1605
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:01.640
<v 2>like rapid,
what the hell was it?
Rapid share I guess are a number of these sites.</v>

1606
01:35:02.450 --> 01:35:03.171
And a,

1607
01:35:03.171 --> 01:35:05.840
I was trying to talk to Matt about it and get his thoughts because of course

1608
01:35:05.841 --> 01:35:09.920
he's missions open source,
but he has a for profit company also.
Uh,

1609
01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:14.510
so it's a very interesting set of full philosophical decisions and business

1610
01:35:14.511 --> 01:35:16.760
decisions.
I was like,
how should I think about this?
And he's like,

1611
01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:20.510
ultimately it came down to talking through it and be like,
oh,

1612
01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:21.860
you're totally fucking right.

1613
01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:26.210
Like the people who are going to download a Shitty pdf version of this work,

1614
01:35:26.211 --> 01:35:28.760
my customers in the first place,
they're never going to buy the book.

1615
01:35:28.761 --> 01:35:31.550
It's not like they would have bought the book but then found it for free.

1616
01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:35.030
And at the same time I'm just getting free marketing dollars and maybe at some

1617
01:35:35.031 --> 01:35:35.510
point they'll,

1618
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:40.130
there'll be converted over to wanting to sort of exchange value for the value

1619
01:35:40.131 --> 01:35:41.960
that I'm putting out there into the world.

1620
01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:43.250
And he was totally right and I was like,
okay,

1621
01:35:43.251 --> 01:35:47.630
rendered all of this angst and all of these time consuming potential avenues.

1622
01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:51.530
Irrelevant.
I was like,
wow.
Well that's a load off my mind.
Uh,
the,

1623
01:35:51.531 --> 01:35:55.550
the meeting with gay reminded me of a expression that you hear a lot here in

1624
01:35:55.551 --> 01:35:59.510
silicon valley,
which is a,
if you want money,

1625
01:35:59.511 --> 01:36:04.490
ask for advice and if you want advice,
ask for money.
Yeah,
it seems to,

1626
01:36:04.491 --> 01:36:08.420
it seems to have worked out a valve.
Hmm.
Uh,

1627
01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:09.900
the only thing,

1628
01:36:09.930 --> 01:36:14.250
the only familiarity I really have with valve is their employee handbook does a

1629
01:36:14.251 --> 01:36:16.410
pdf that's floated around for quite a few years,

1630
01:36:16.411 --> 01:36:20.310
which I thought was genius really.
And it sounds so boring,
but if,

1631
01:36:20.311 --> 01:36:22.050
if people look it up and I'll put it in the show notes,

1632
01:36:22.210 --> 01:36:25.300
<v 3>only HR document you will ever knowingly want to read.</v>

1633
01:36:25.410 --> 01:36:29.670
<v 2>Yeah.
It's fascinating.
How has that affected or how his,</v>

1634
01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:34.560
how do you think about building your company?
So how,
how,
how is it different?

1635
01:36:34.830 --> 01:36:38.220
<v 3>I think we're now getting to the point,
how is it different?
Um,</v>

1636
01:36:38.730 --> 01:36:42.550
I think early on there were,
I'll say it this way,

1637
01:36:42.610 --> 01:36:47.610
I tend to think that valve as a culture is Gabes personal reaction to everything

1638
01:36:47.831 --> 01:36:50.290
he really didn't like about the Microsoft culture.

1639
01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:54.520
And Gay was a very early and an important employee at Microsoft.
Um,

1640
01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:57.790
so valve was sort of like,
these are all the things that I think are,

1641
01:36:57.791 --> 01:37:01.660
why Microsoft is not going to do well in the long term and we're going to get

1642
01:37:01.661 --> 01:37:06.550
them right here.
And he built valve that way.
And and uh,
valve employee,

1643
01:37:06.551 --> 01:37:07.450
Joe Ludwig.

1644
01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:12.660
I remember asking me like how much of chef steps culture that we copy from valve

1645
01:37:13.361 --> 01:37:16.820
just because that's what like Gabe told us to.
And I'm like,

1646
01:37:16.821 --> 01:37:19.400
well Gabe never told us to copy valves called tree.

1647
01:37:19.401 --> 01:37:21.890
Never particularly encouraged that.

1648
01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:26.710
He did encourage us to think in certain ways that I think are going to bring you

1649
01:37:26.711 --> 01:37:27.790
to those decisions.

1650
01:37:28.330 --> 01:37:32.920
But in a sense Microsoft culture came from bill and Nathan and I worked for

1651
01:37:32.921 --> 01:37:36.880
Nathan for five years and I worked on projects that reported to Nathan and bill,

1652
01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:39.940
um,
for another year after modernist cuisine was done in,

1653
01:37:39.941 --> 01:37:42.040
I can tell you in my estimation,

1654
01:37:42.041 --> 01:37:47.041
the Microsoft culture came from those guys and I was just as primed when I was

1655
01:37:48.501 --> 01:37:51.740
starting chef steps to have a reaction to everything I didn't like about those

1656
01:37:51.741 --> 01:37:55.130
cultural sensibilities of running a business.
And so chef steps,

1657
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:56.820
much like valves,

1658
01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:59.810
partially a reaction to those are the things that I didn't think,
uh,

1659
01:38:00.090 --> 01:38:04.260
worked very well for running a company that's supposed to get the best,

1660
01:38:04.290 --> 01:38:06.870
most innovative,
most interesting work out of people.

1661
01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:10.740
What are the things that don't work,
at least for you?
For me,
I,

1662
01:38:11.190 --> 01:38:15.570
so especially when you're in the invention or innovation phases,

1663
01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:20.960
traditional goal oriented management is not incredibly helpful.

1664
01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:22.830
You're basically in 19,

1665
01:38:22.831 --> 01:38:26.130
this class of people whose job it is to tell these incredibly creative people

1666
01:38:26.131 --> 01:38:29.610
what they should and shouldn't be doing and trying to judge them by some

1667
01:38:29.611 --> 01:38:30.600
arbitrary metric.

1668
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:34.500
Like that's a waste of everybody's time and anybody who's really good isn't

1669
01:38:34.501 --> 01:38:38.490
going to tolerate it for very long and we'll leave.
Um,
now conversely,

1670
01:38:38.491 --> 01:38:39.301
you can get really,

1671
01:38:39.301 --> 01:38:43.080
really flaky creative people who never get anything done and like you'll tear

1672
01:38:43.081 --> 01:38:44.640
your hair out.
Well,
don't hire those people.

1673
01:38:45.210 --> 01:38:48.930
We pretty much exclusively learn to hire people that are,

1674
01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:52.080
have a demonstrated track record of doing incredibly creative,

1675
01:38:52.081 --> 01:38:55.680
innovative things in whatever domain was relevant to their job.

1676
01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:59.400
And they had a proven track record of they've shipped stuff.

1677
01:38:59.490 --> 01:39:03.780
They've got stuff done and we're like,
well that's like highly predictive.

1678
01:39:03.781 --> 01:39:07.650
We think of like you'll be able to do the same here and if we have people like

1679
01:39:07.651 --> 01:39:09.050
you,
we don't need to manage you.

1680
01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:12.000
Like you know how to use your time better than we do.

1681
01:39:12.001 --> 01:39:14.250
So it's your choice how you spend your time,

1682
01:39:14.670 --> 01:39:18.420
you're free to make good choices and you're free to make terrible choices and if

1683
01:39:18.421 --> 01:39:19.620
you make enough terrible choices,

1684
01:39:19.621 --> 01:39:23.940
like your team may ask you to leave because nobody wants to work with you and if

1685
01:39:23.941 --> 01:39:25.110
you make lots of good choices,

1686
01:39:25.111 --> 01:39:26.940
we're going to trust you to make more good choices.

1687
01:39:26.941 --> 01:39:30.420
And so that sort of leads you down the road of of flatness.

1688
01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:36.070
Where you run into some challenges is when you're working on a shorter timeframe

1689
01:39:36.090 --> 01:39:39.600
because you don't have infinite amounts of money or when you have to sort of

1690
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:43.590
really align everyone pretty tightly towards a common goal that we need to ship.

1691
01:39:43.591 --> 01:39:48.210
We need to pull six teams together to make this product ship and to monetize it

1692
01:39:48.211 --> 01:39:50.520
and,
and not flub the lodge.
That's where we're,

1693
01:39:50.521 --> 01:39:55.020
we're definitely seeing there are struggles with flatness one approach.
One,

1694
01:39:55.050 --> 01:39:59.670
the conventional wisdom is we should basically uh,
create a hierarchy to do this.

1695
01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:05.010
I'm kind of fighting that right now because I think that's a short term gain and

1696
01:40:05.011 --> 01:40:09.060
a longterm disaster.
I totally agree.
There needs to be structure,

1697
01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:13.380
we need to have people that get that they can clearly signal that they're being

1698
01:40:13.381 --> 01:40:15.870
trusted to lead,
but we don't want to make that permanent.

1699
01:40:16.650 --> 01:40:18.840
And I think this is another thing we've learned from,
from,

1700
01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:21.210
from valve that I think is fundamentally a pretty good lesson,

1701
01:40:21.211 --> 01:40:25.260
which is people tend to want to keep working on the things that made them

1702
01:40:25.261 --> 01:40:30.140
successful in the first place.
That's antithetical to invent it.

1703
01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:31.350
Innovation invention.

1704
01:40:31.351 --> 01:40:35.970
And if you're a small startup company where like your advantage is speed towards

1705
01:40:35.971 --> 01:40:37.920
doing something nobody else is doing,

1706
01:40:38.490 --> 01:40:42.670
that's not a very good structure for finding those opportunities.
And,

1707
01:40:42.671 --> 01:40:46.950
and I tend to believe that for the type of business we are over the coming
years,

1708
01:40:46.951 --> 01:40:49.440
we're going to constantly have to reinvent ourselves in the people that are

1709
01:40:49.441 --> 01:40:50.071
really important.

1710
01:40:50.071 --> 01:40:53.950
Today may not be the most important people to the company in five years when we

1711
01:40:53.951 --> 01:40:55.630
might be about something totally different.

1712
01:40:56.380 --> 01:41:01.060
The problem is if we anoint those people as special senior managers,
leaders,

1713
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:04.180
those people will tend to want to keep working on the things that got them in

1714
01:41:04.181 --> 01:41:06.220
that position.
And that's not in the interest of the company.

1715
01:41:06.221 --> 01:41:07.240
It's in the interest of them.

1716
01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:11.500
And pretty quickly you have rent seeking behavior and and power politics and

1717
01:41:11.501 --> 01:41:15.340
fiefdoms where the only solution for the company is to periodically come and

1718
01:41:15.341 --> 01:41:18.610
just do this wholesale house cleaning of firing a bunch of people who used to be

1719
01:41:18.611 --> 01:41:21.610
good because they've actually gotten in the way of the company.

1720
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:24.430
So we sort of took the attitude of like,

1721
01:41:24.431 --> 01:41:26.530
let's just not create that structure in the first place.

1722
01:41:26.531 --> 01:41:29.200
And that's why even though we have the tension now,

1723
01:41:29.201 --> 01:41:32.380
we're pushing out a very complex product where we have to hit a lot of things

1724
01:41:32.381 --> 01:41:36.040
right?
And there's a real emphasis on disciplined execution,

1725
01:41:36.730 --> 01:41:40.030
taking the short term easy way out of let's create a bunch of people who are

1726
01:41:40.031 --> 01:41:42.520
managers of this process.
Like,

1727
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:45.430
I'm totally convinced that that will fuck us up in a couple of years.

1728
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Are there any books or people who have most influenced how you make business

1729
01:41:52.931 --> 01:41:56.310
decisions?
I think there's a law,
quite a few people.
I'm,

1730
01:41:56.311 --> 01:41:58.120
I'm always looking for perspective.

1731
01:41:58.121 --> 01:42:00.670
I think Matt actually has influenced me a lot.

1732
01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:04.670
I think there's people within chef steps,
uh,
Michael Napkin who's,
you know,

1733
01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:08.570
sort of as close as we get to something like a CTO.
Um,

1734
01:42:08.830 --> 01:42:12.220
he certainly influenced me a lot on how to think about some of the technical

1735
01:42:12.221 --> 01:42:16.870
decisions we make.
In terms of other people that come,
come to mind.

1736
01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:22.390
Uh,
absolutely Gabe and people like Yan Bernay over at valve have influenced my

1737
01:42:22.391 --> 01:42:24.280
thinking a lot.
My father's influenced my thinking a lot.

1738
01:42:24.670 --> 01:42:28.470
I read lots of business articles.
There's,
there's some stuff there,

1739
01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:31.420
stuff that I think a lot of people in the valley read that certainly I pay

1740
01:42:31.421 --> 01:42:35.110
attention to it and I think about it and some of it I think is pretty right on.

1741
01:42:35.530 --> 01:42:37.790
And I think other stuff is like super wrong headed.

1742
01:42:38.170 --> 01:42:41.320
So I don't know that there's like any one person,
I'm looking to.
The,

1743
01:42:41.370 --> 01:42:46.370
the other thing I come back to is I try to look at the data and I really try to,

1744
01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:52.720
I'm sort of prone to changing my mind a lot and it's,
it can feel random,

1745
01:42:52.721 --> 01:42:57.280
but it's almost always because I'm seeing something in the data that,

1746
01:42:57.370 --> 01:43:00.070
that I thought was true,
but the data is saying it's not true.

1747
01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:03.430
And so I have new information and I think the only rational thing to do,

1748
01:43:03.431 --> 01:43:07.030
and I have new information has changed my mind that can actually feel pretty

1749
01:43:07.031 --> 01:43:11.740
randomizing to a team.
So I'm,
I'm trying to find ways to buffer that.

1750
01:43:11.970 --> 01:43:12.400
Um,

1751
01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:15.610
or to at least help them reach the point where they're changing their minds to

1752
01:43:15.611 --> 01:43:18.300
without it just,
you know,
basically Chris has changed his mind.
That's,

1753
01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:19.690
that's not a good outcome.

1754
01:43:20.110 --> 01:43:24.370
So we tend to buy us towards people who are pretty quantitative in their

1755
01:43:24.371 --> 01:43:27.490
decisions,
especially on the business side where we say,
well,
like,

1756
01:43:27.491 --> 01:43:29.890
let's listen to our customers.
What does the data really telling us?

1757
01:43:29.891 --> 01:43:31.000
What are they really telling us?

1758
01:43:31.001 --> 01:43:35.810
And let's make sure we're not fooling ourselves with anecdotes.
Yeah.
You know,
I,

1759
01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:40.240
uh,
I've done two books,
very helpful for that as someone who is,

1760
01:43:40.770 --> 01:43:44.800
I wouldn't say particularly mathematically inclined or who got derailed by a bad

1761
01:43:44.801 --> 01:43:48.560
teacher in 10th grade.
And if I want to point fingers,
uh,

1762
01:43:49.330 --> 01:43:51.860
the I support finger pointing

1763
01:43:53.380 --> 01:43:53.831
<v 2>one,</v>

1764
01:43:53.831 --> 01:43:57.280
which I want to actually go back and reread or listened to and I believe it's

1765
01:43:57.610 --> 01:44:02.320
available for free and audio is high output management by Andy Grove.
Uh,

1766
01:44:02.590 --> 01:44:03.970
and uh,
the other,

1767
01:44:03.971 --> 01:44:08.971
which I think is helpful for conditioning oneself or others if it's kind of

1768
01:44:09.731 --> 01:44:14.731
prescribed as reading for spotting cognitive biases and learning to try to trust

1769
01:44:16.461 --> 01:44:20.900
the data is,
um,
it's a fun way to predictably irrational by Dan Arielli.

1770
01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:25.340
So to shift gears just a little bit,
I want to talk about goal setting.

1771
01:44:25.341 --> 01:44:29.030
Of course that's maybe an underlying layer upon which many other things are

1772
01:44:29.031 --> 01:44:33.320
built almost by definition,
but could we start with gliding?

1773
01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:36.680
What does,
what does competitive gliding and what are some of your goals there?

1774
01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:42.020
<v 3>So competitive gliding is,
uh,
there's different ways of doing it,</v>

1775
01:44:42.021 --> 01:44:46.430
but as I usually practice it,
uh,
we're in gliders.
These are big 15,

1776
01:44:46.431 --> 01:44:51.320
20 meters,
15 to 20 meter sail planes,
um,
made from carbon fiber,

1777
01:44:51.321 --> 01:44:52.520
fiberglass composites,

1778
01:44:53.210 --> 01:44:57.920
and we're usually basically racing the sun.
Uh,

1779
01:44:58.010 --> 01:45:02.380
you know,
we get all of our energy for a competition out of,
uh,

1780
01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:03.620
the fact that the sun heats,

1781
01:45:03.621 --> 01:45:07.460
the atmosphere of that causes differ differential heating and you get thermals,

1782
01:45:07.850 --> 01:45:12.650
which you see birds circling in and puffy clouds at the top of you get sheer

1783
01:45:12.651 --> 01:45:15.280
where you get wins that basically may be lifted up,
uh,

1784
01:45:15.290 --> 01:45:17.000
over mountains that create lift.

1785
01:45:17.330 --> 01:45:20.840
We'll get mountain wave where the atmosphere actually starts to oscillate.

1786
01:45:20.841 --> 01:45:23.870
And we can surf that for hundreds,
if not thousands of miles

1787
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:25.320
<v 2>soup,
no propeller.</v>

1788
01:45:26.010 --> 01:45:27.780
<v 3>We get towed up into this end of this guy,</v>

1789
01:45:27.781 --> 01:45:30.750
a couple thousand feet by another plane.
And once we come off that tow rope,

1790
01:45:30.751 --> 01:45:33.810
it's ours to go find energy.
So it's like big wave surfing,

1791
01:45:33.811 --> 01:45:37.200
except you're on air and you can't see it and you'd have to look at the
telltale.

1792
01:45:37.201 --> 01:45:40.530
So our job is to basically read where the atmosphere is giving up free energy.

1793
01:45:41.190 --> 01:45:45.450
The way a race will work is we'll call usually turn points.
And so we might call,

1794
01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:47.790
they might be a city,
they might be an airfield,

1795
01:45:47.791 --> 01:45:51.960
they might be a geographic feature and these can be uh,

1796
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:55.320
a hundred miles apart,
more,
maybe a little bit less.

1797
01:45:55.321 --> 01:45:58.350
And there's cylinders around them.
Usually it turns cylinders we call them,

1798
01:45:58.351 --> 01:46:03.351
where you can sort of imagine these imaginary cylinders in the sky that are

1799
01:46:04.110 --> 01:46:08.160
anywhere from five miles to maybe 20 miles around a turn point.

1800
01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:12.480
And our job is to basically decide when to turn on those,
um,

1801
01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:15.150
and get back to our,
our home airfield.

1802
01:46:15.180 --> 01:46:18.390
But the challenge is you're given a minimum time on course.

1803
01:46:18.630 --> 01:46:23.190
So we have to be out for say three or four hours.
And if you come back early,

1804
01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:26.400
whatever distance you flew gets divided by the minimum time,

1805
01:46:26.401 --> 01:46:30.660
which obliterate your average speed.
Um,
and if you come way over,

1806
01:46:30.690 --> 01:46:33.570
you might've covered more distance,
but your average speed also goes down.

1807
01:46:33.571 --> 01:46:35.760
And so the very best pilots,

1808
01:46:36.210 --> 01:46:40.380
we'll usually time it pretty well to get back within a couple minutes of that

1809
01:46:40.381 --> 01:46:41.800
time.
Um,

1810
01:46:41.850 --> 01:46:46.470
over a four hour race that might cover anywhere from three to 500 kilometers.

1811
01:46:47.140 --> 01:46:48.880
And what you're really,

1812
01:46:48.910 --> 01:46:53.040
you're enough of the landscape where the sky's going to change on you.

1813
01:46:53.041 --> 01:46:54.720
You've got to decide when to start that.

1814
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:57.510
That's one of the other secrets is you get to,

1815
01:46:57.740 --> 01:47:01.080
they opened a a start gate but you get to choose when to start.

1816
01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:05.130
And so there's a whole strategy and game theory behind when to do that.

1817
01:47:05.131 --> 01:47:08.550
And the top pilots are all very good at this as we call it start gate roulette

1818
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:10.440
where like the top pilots,
we'll,

1819
01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:12.600
we'll go out and be seen to go out in a bunch of,

1820
01:47:12.601 --> 01:47:15.660
the lesser pilots will follow them and then they'll try to duck behind a cloud,

1821
01:47:15.870 --> 01:47:16.740
get lost,

1822
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:20.310
come back and restart and then follow all of those people who are essentially

1823
01:47:20.311 --> 01:47:23.590
acting as markers out on course of where there's energy and where there's clear

1824
01:47:23.591 --> 01:47:26.640
like the canaries in the coalmine or totally the canaries.
Um,

1825
01:47:26.860 --> 01:47:30.240
I have been that can area when I was not more experience where I was like,

1826
01:47:30.270 --> 01:47:33.630
oh look,
he's going,
I should just follow that.
I just follow that person.

1827
01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:35.730
I know I was being suckered.

1828
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:40.670
And what's really interesting about it is it's physically demanding.
Um,

1829
01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:43.350
it's actually,
you're getting a lot of sun.
You're pulling,

1830
01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:46.590
we might spend upwards of 30% of the time circling,

1831
01:47:46.591 --> 01:47:51.591
but those circles are anywhere from 1.2 to 1.35.

1832
01:47:52.150 --> 01:47:54.570
Oh I'm sorry,
1.75 g forces.

1833
01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:57.300
Maybe occasionally you'll pull two GS.

1834
01:47:57.780 --> 01:48:00.590
You can actually pull a lot more to glider,
but that's atypical and erase.

1835
01:48:00.690 --> 01:48:04.290
But you might be pulling those g forces of,
of,
you know,

1836
01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:07.800
one and a half g's for 30 minutes or more when you're dehydrated,

1837
01:48:07.801 --> 01:48:10.890
when you're getting a lot of sense.
So it's very,
and you're changing altitude,

1838
01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:14.790
which constricts and expand your capillary systems.
Here,

1839
01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:18.240
you're always having to pee or you're always dehydrated depending on whether

1840
01:48:18.241 --> 01:48:19.410
you're going up or going down.

1841
01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:22.890
So there's this big part of it where you have to manage your physiology for

1842
01:48:22.891 --> 01:48:23.730
several hours.

1843
01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:27.450
You have to be very disciplined in your decision making because the difference

1844
01:48:27.451 --> 01:48:32.370
between first and second or third might only be one,

1845
01:48:32.371 --> 01:48:33.570
one and a half minutes.

1846
01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:38.600
That's usually only three extra circles during a four hour race where you might

1847
01:48:38.911 --> 01:48:41.520
actually do hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of circles.

1848
01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:46.130
So it's all about efficiency.
It's do I bay?
It's,

1849
01:48:46.170 --> 01:48:49.550
it's do I need to make this turn or should I be going and what do,

1850
01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:52.140
what do I think the atmosphere is going to be doing in 10 minutes?

1851
01:48:52.141 --> 01:48:54.210
And where do I think it's going to be good?
And where do we think it's bad?

1852
01:48:54.211 --> 01:48:56.850
So it's,
it's extremely strategic.

1853
01:48:57.450 --> 01:49:00.810
It's also extremely tactical because you're still having to fly the airplane.

1854
01:49:00.811 --> 01:49:04.680
And so you're flipping constantly back and forth between the fly the airplane,

1855
01:49:04.681 --> 01:49:08.880
because I might be in a climb with 10 other airplanes,
a fraction of a wingspan.

1856
01:49:08.881 --> 01:49:10.980
We're all circling together within inches.

1857
01:49:10.981 --> 01:49:13.830
And so it's a highly coordinated formation flying where it's like the rule is

1858
01:49:13.831 --> 01:49:16.680
don't crash into the other guy.
Um,

1859
01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:20.580
but we're also having to do all the mental calculations of wins at time to go,

1860
01:49:20.581 --> 01:49:21.840
where am I going next?

1861
01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:24.150
And you're always trying to think well ahead of the airplane.

1862
01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:28.230
And so I find that it's incredibly focusing and you're like,

1863
01:49:28.231 --> 01:49:32.200
you have no choice but to be totally in the moment.
Um,

1864
01:49:32.230 --> 01:49:36.180
and to be extremely focused on what you're feeling,

1865
01:49:36.210 --> 01:49:40.400
the way the airplane's feeling,
what other,
what,
what the right strategy is.

1866
01:49:40.401 --> 01:49:44.400
And I just find that incredibly addicted in the fact that you can take this

1867
01:49:44.401 --> 01:49:49.210
technology and just by reading the telltales of the sky around us,

1868
01:49:49.211 --> 01:49:54.010
find enough free energy to go fly at a average speeds that,
uh,

1869
01:49:54.011 --> 01:49:59.011
approach a hundred miles an hour and cover hundreds of miles of distance over

1870
01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:03.310
beautiful mountains or desert floors where if you land,

1871
01:50:03.311 --> 01:50:07.870
it's like you're going to be walking a very long time to the nearest road.
I,

1872
01:50:07.871 --> 01:50:11.260
it's just,
it's amazing.
This is going to seem unrelated,
but do you,

1873
01:50:11.261 --> 01:50:13.180
how well do you typically sleep?

1874
01:50:13.210 --> 01:50:16.830
Do you have trouble getting to sleep most of the time?
Yes.
Okay.

1875
01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:22.210
The reason I ask is that I am doing a lot better now for a host of reasons for

1876
01:50:22.211 --> 01:50:25.360
another,
then I can save for another time.
But I've always had onset insomnia.

1877
01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:29.980
And so I've been attracted to activities like that where you cannot let,

1878
01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:31.330
there's a huge penalty.

1879
01:50:31.331 --> 01:50:35.500
You can do it if you let your mind wander or obsess on other things.

1880
01:50:35.890 --> 01:50:37.270
There's an enormous penalty.

1881
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:41.530
And so I just find it to be a huge sort of stress release valve.

1882
01:50:41.531 --> 01:50:45.280
It's almost like meditating to engage in an activity like that.
For me,
it's,

1883
01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:46.630
that's a big part of it.

1884
01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:51.040
It's one of the few things that if I go off to a glider competition for a couple

1885
01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:54.940
of weeks,
or if or I go to go flying in,
in southern New Zealand,

1886
01:50:55.090 --> 01:50:58.090
which I do every couple of years,
I was there,
I was there in November and it's,

1887
01:50:58.330 --> 01:51:01.900
it's as amazing as you would think.
Um,
it's all consuming.

1888
01:51:01.901 --> 01:51:04.690
My entire schedule starts revolving around flying.

1889
01:51:04.691 --> 01:51:07.750
And because competitions are usually held over multiple days too.

1890
01:51:07.751 --> 01:51:09.820
So it's about consistency.
You know,

1891
01:51:09.821 --> 01:51:12.740
if you're in first the only place to go as backwards.
Um,

1892
01:51:12.741 --> 01:51:15.850
and so it's all about low risk.
Whereas if you're in fifth,
it's,

1893
01:51:15.851 --> 01:51:18.520
you've got to be better the next day and take risks,

1894
01:51:18.521 --> 01:51:21.340
but you might blow up a new horrible,
it's,

1895
01:51:21.670 --> 01:51:24.790
it's the counterpoint to the rest of my life where it's very unstructured,

1896
01:51:24.791 --> 01:51:27.040
can be very chaotic and that's just part of how it works.

1897
01:51:27.041 --> 01:51:29.560
Whereas this is sort of extremely structured,

1898
01:51:29.561 --> 01:51:32.770
extremely focusing in highly rewarding.
So what is your current,

1899
01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:36.460
what are your current goals are biggest goal in gliding?
Uh,

1900
01:51:36.461 --> 01:51:41.430
so the biggest goal is setting a distance,
record a world distance records.

1901
01:51:41.431 --> 01:51:45.940
So these days,
the world record I think is over 3000 kilometers.

1902
01:51:45.941 --> 01:51:50.620
So about a 3009,
I think.
And it was set in the Andes.

1903
01:51:50.700 --> 01:51:55.630
Um,
and really that's the only place left to set a record that big because what

1904
01:51:55.631 --> 01:52:00.631
happens is the prevailing winds flow from west to east and they,

1905
01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:04.180
there is a pig long mountain chain that runs up South America called the Andes.

1906
01:52:04.420 --> 01:52:08.990
Those winds slam into and as they rise over it,
um,

1907
01:52:09.070 --> 01:52:11.290
they rise to a level where they become unstable.

1908
01:52:11.291 --> 01:52:14.350
So they start to fall and it overdoes it in each direction.

1909
01:52:14.351 --> 01:52:17.350
And so it starts to oscillate and the whole atmosphere starts are,

1910
01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:22.540
and where you can climb into what we call a mountain wave and you can climb up,

1911
01:52:22.601 --> 01:52:26.950
I think the records over 50,000 feet and there's people attempting for a hundred

1912
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:28.870
thousand feet.
But once you get in that wave,
you can surf it,

1913
01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:32.510
you can run it parallel to the mountains,
you may have to jump where the mount,

1914
01:52:32.511 --> 01:52:35.170
where the mountain range zigs and Zags.
You've got to read what's going on.
It's,

1915
01:52:35.171 --> 01:52:37.240
it's not as simple as just put the nose down,

1916
01:52:37.690 --> 01:52:39.880
but you're flying at the red line of the airplane.

1917
01:52:39.881 --> 01:52:44.200
Like you fly even a nod or two faster and the whole wings get,
you know,

1918
01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:48.290
we'll basically explode,
which is bad.
Well,

1919
01:52:48.530 --> 01:52:50.360
you're doing that at this point.

1920
01:52:50.361 --> 01:52:54.380
They're now doing that up the length of the Andes and back down where they're

1921
01:52:54.381 --> 01:52:58.190
racing against daylight because the records have to be set 30 minutes before

1922
01:52:58.191 --> 01:53:00.890
legal sunrise to 30 minutes after legal sunset.

1923
01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:02.150
That's the time you have allotted.

1924
01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:04.220
And if you're flying at the very limits of the airplane,

1925
01:53:04.221 --> 01:53:05.660
you're limited by the speed of the airplane.

1926
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:11.450
So I commissioned an airplane called the Duck Hawkin DNX built by this

1927
01:53:11.660 --> 01:53:14.870
incredible genius.
Greg Kohl in bend,
Oregon.

1928
01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:17.300
And Greg was applying new technologies,

1929
01:53:17.301 --> 01:53:22.301
new manufacturing techniques to build an airplane that's about 40% faster than

1930
01:53:22.371 --> 01:53:23.300
any other slider.

1931
01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:27.940
That's a significant jump in as possible because he wasn't true.

1932
01:53:28.130 --> 01:53:31.490
He was trying to optimize for a very specific problem and who is willing to use

1933
01:53:31.491 --> 01:53:35.690
new technologies and try things that most people thought were a bit crazy and

1934
01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:39.050
either I'm crazy or,
or,
or not.

1935
01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:43.600
And if it's the not case,
then Greg's built an incredible airplane,
the at,

1936
01:53:43.670 --> 01:53:44.930
um,
uh,

1937
01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:48.710
that is capable of doing what no other airplane is capable of doing.

1938
01:53:48.711 --> 01:53:52.120
And so this is going to take several seasons of training.
Um,

1939
01:53:52.190 --> 01:53:55.190
this kind of flying is highly technical.
You've,

1940
01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:57.260
you really have to manage your physiology.

1941
01:53:57.261 --> 01:54:01.010
You can go hypoxic cause you're usually operating at 20 to 30,000 feet.

1942
01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:04.880
So you're on oxygen.
Um,
your solo in an airplane,

1943
01:54:04.910 --> 01:54:09.910
it's minus 80 degrees Celsius outside and you're dealing with wins.

1944
01:54:10.221 --> 01:54:13.100
That could be a hundred plus Maya nots.

1945
01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:17.600
And how much spaces around you,
uh,
in the airplane?
Yeah,

1946
01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:20.930
I wear it is the best way to describe it.
It's very snug.

1947
01:54:20.931 --> 01:54:24.230
You feel the flex of the wings,
you feel uh,

1948
01:54:24.231 --> 01:54:28.650
what the atmosphere is doing and you want to do that.
And uh,
so the,
the,

1949
01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:32.540
the plan is in a few years to,
is to start spending seasons down there.

1950
01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:37.840
I'm trying to do these big record flights and there's both the air frame and

1951
01:54:38.031 --> 01:54:42.650
then there's the possibility of sensorized in the airplane so that the airplane

1952
01:54:42.651 --> 01:54:47.651
in certain respects can respond faster than a human can by automating the flaps,

1953
01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:51.430
um,
based on what various,
uh,

1954
01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:54.170
accelerometers and memes gyros are doing.

1955
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:59.060
So this is where people at chef steps are like totally freaked out because I've

1956
01:54:59.061 --> 01:55:03.900
been writing my own firmware for controlling my automated flaps now.

1957
01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:08.630
All right,
so we were talking about like confidence versus Hubris.
What,

1958
01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:11.270
what is compelling you to do that?
Are there not other,

1959
01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:16.520
because from what I've gathered,
you're not a software engineer,
no coders.

1960
01:55:17.090 --> 01:55:21.140
So do you have like such and such for dummies and you were just putting together

1961
01:55:21.141 --> 01:55:26.000
the firmware or why would you do it yourself versus two?
Twofold.
So one,

1962
01:55:26.001 --> 01:55:28.850
I'm lucky to be surrounded by a bunch of people who are in fact very good

1963
01:55:28.851 --> 01:55:32.930
engineers and I absolutely ask them for advice and in fact I even asked them for

1964
01:55:32.931 --> 01:55:36.050
code reviews now because like this is a little bit bonkers.

1965
01:55:36.590 --> 01:55:40.490
The other part of it though is twofold.
One,
I like to know how things work.

1966
01:55:40.491 --> 01:55:45.120
I like to know how they're built and while I expect I will need the help and

1967
01:55:45.121 --> 01:55:48.330
assistance of other people to fully implement what I want to do,

1968
01:55:49.120 --> 01:55:50.320
I want to be part of doing that.

1969
01:55:50.321 --> 01:55:53.740
I want to know why various choices were made or what the trade offs are.

1970
01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:57.550
Partially,
it gives me confidence.
Like I'm used to working on my airplane.

1971
01:55:57.551 --> 01:56:00.070
I'm used to understanding everything about how it's built.

1972
01:56:00.850 --> 01:56:04.870
I'm relying on the software to do a lot of things to augment my abilities.

1973
01:56:05.230 --> 01:56:08.100
I want to know how it's built.
I want to know when it's going to do bat,

1974
01:56:08.110 --> 01:56:11.020
might do bad things and when it basically can't do bad things.

1975
01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:12.033
<v 2>It's a good answer.</v>

1976
01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:17.520
You're talking about the structure and required level of detail in gliding

1977
01:56:19.570 --> 01:56:24.370
versus a lot of the rest of your life at least let's just say in a professional

1978
01:56:24.371 --> 01:56:25.690
sense which is unstructured.

1979
01:56:26.110 --> 01:56:30.940
So add a note to talk to you about the value of a less structured day and I was

1980
01:56:30.941 --> 01:56:34.480
hoping you could just elaborate on that because

1981
01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:38.560
<v 3>you seem to have both in your life.
I you need both.</v>

1982
01:56:38.561 --> 01:56:42.950
I think I'm more at least I suppose I need both to do some of the things I want

1983
01:56:42.951 --> 01:56:45.340
to accomplish.
In other words,
absolutely no structure.

1984
01:56:45.341 --> 01:56:47.500
There are certain types of things I'd never be able to accomplish.

1985
01:56:47.501 --> 01:56:48.340
Gliding is one of them,

1986
01:56:48.341 --> 01:56:51.100
but actually running a company requires a certain amount of structure.

1987
01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:52.780
On the other hand,

1988
01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:57.900
I spend a lot of my time venting and I don't think inventing is something that

1989
01:56:58.521 --> 01:57:00.560
is very amenable to mean structured.

1990
01:57:01.010 --> 01:57:05.440
I think inventing 10 it's a bit like writing where some days you're prolific,

1991
01:57:05.690 --> 01:57:07.580
some days nothing's coming,

1992
01:57:07.581 --> 01:57:10.760
sometimes weeks nothing is coming in and you start to get super nervous about

1993
01:57:10.761 --> 01:57:14.510
deadlines that have come and gone and like you're avoiding your email and your

1994
01:57:14.511 --> 01:57:16.460
cell phone because people are angry at you.

1995
01:57:17.210 --> 01:57:22.210
But to those types of activities they take the time they take and I have

1996
01:57:23.601 --> 01:57:27.240
basically found that I need to build part of my life
highly unstructured.

1997
01:57:27.241 --> 01:57:28.530
If I wake up,
when I wake up,

1998
01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:31.510
I stay up til three in the morning reading something,

1999
01:57:31.540 --> 01:57:34.620
working on something that's all sort of grist for the mill that's just

2000
01:57:34.621 --> 01:57:38.160
percolating there and in ways I can't predict,

2001
01:57:38.161 --> 01:57:42.930
but I've come to learn will come at a certain rate that has,

2002
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:45.950
I've found in my career allowed me to make certain leaps,

2003
01:57:45.951 --> 01:57:49.220
figure certain things out or come up with something where if I tried to force it

2004
01:57:49.221 --> 01:57:52.610
or structure it,
I would have taken a very predictable path because it was like,

2005
01:57:52.611 --> 01:57:56.120
oh well we just need to solve this,
this problem and this is how you do it.

2006
01:57:56.121 --> 01:57:59.860
Versus you have this flashes of brilliance where like,
oh,

2007
01:57:59.861 --> 01:58:04.030
this is what we need to do and that I just don't believe that kind of creativity

2008
01:58:04.031 --> 01:58:07.060
is very amenable destruction.
So I try to have part of my life,

2009
01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:10.550
even though it can be kind of insane for everyone else where like if I want to

2010
01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:14.200
stay up all night,
if I going to get up late,
if I have a meeting,

2011
01:58:14.201 --> 01:58:17.110
it's going to get canceled.
It's just like I'm not structuring my time.

2012
01:58:17.111 --> 01:58:21.400
It's my time to do whatever I want with it.
Whatever rate feels right that day.

2013
01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:26.730
And I've started to find,
I need to basically carve out very big chunks.

2014
01:58:26.731 --> 01:58:31.731
The minimum chunk seems to be about half a day where like don't expect me to be

2015
01:58:31.771 --> 01:58:34.050
doing anything else because I'm not going to guarantee you it'll happen.

2016
01:58:34.130 --> 01:58:36.570
I'm just busy letting myself enjoy life.

2017
01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:38.710
<v 2>So what does that look like?</v>

2018
01:58:38.711 --> 01:58:42.760
Or what do you hope it will look like on say a basis?
So one of the,

2019
01:58:42.850 --> 01:58:47.850
the really epiphany's but realizations I had a few years ago is that many of my

2020
01:58:48.851 --> 01:58:53.851
friends who are highly effective human beings thought of batching certain

2021
01:58:56.501 --> 01:58:59.080
activities on specific days of the week.
In other words,

2022
01:58:59.350 --> 01:59:03.040
it wasn't that they would check email,
have meetings,
set goals,

2023
01:59:03.041 --> 01:59:06.640
brainstorm and journal and 15 other activities each day.

2024
01:59:07.210 --> 01:59:12.090
They would batch certain types of tasks or unstructured time.
Right?

2025
01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:15.840
And so for me,
that means generally speaking,

2026
01:59:15.841 --> 01:59:19.940
batch recording audio on Mondays and Fridays,
uh,

2027
01:59:20.050 --> 01:59:22.950
unstructured time for just creation.

2028
01:59:22.951 --> 01:59:27.180
Whenever that happens to mean in a given week on Wednesdays from like 9:00 AM to

2029
01:59:27.181 --> 01:59:29.880
1:00 PM.
So,
even if I am,

2030
01:59:29.881 --> 01:59:33.150
my goal is to have sort of room to think and space.

2031
01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:35.070
If I don't create that space in my calendar,

2032
01:59:35.071 --> 01:59:39.300
it's very likely that it'll get overrun with other stuff.
Uh,
how do you,

2033
01:59:39.390 --> 01:59:43.850
how do you think about that?
Or are there certain rules?
Like if then,

2034
01:59:43.851 --> 01:59:45.500
like you just said,
like if I stay up late,

2035
01:59:45.530 --> 01:59:49.580
then I will clear the decks and like send an email before I go to bed saying,

2036
01:59:49.581 --> 01:59:52.550
hey,
like wipe the decks up until this point in time.

2037
01:59:53.160 --> 01:59:56.250
<v 3>So there's some of that.
Um,</v>

2038
01:59:56.370 --> 01:59:59.860
I haven't found that totally effective for myself,

2039
02:00:00.710 --> 02:00:01.690
although I have to do so.

2040
02:00:01.691 --> 02:00:04.520
I love it because I have a responsibility of running a company and they have,
uh,

2041
02:00:04.521 --> 02:00:04.970
you know,

2042
02:00:04.970 --> 02:00:08.720
I need to be available to certain people or it's just not being fair or it's

2043
02:00:08.721 --> 02:00:11.720
impeding their effectiveness and their productivity.

2044
02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:14.780
And I have definitely surrounded myself with types of people that are very

2045
02:00:14.781 --> 02:00:19.220
complimentary to me of people who are more focused on organization and being

2046
02:00:19.221 --> 02:00:23.090
productive and a very specific kind of way.
I tend to find that,

2047
02:00:23.091 --> 02:00:28.091
especially when I'm getting into something where I'm trying to solve a very

2048
02:00:28.601 --> 02:00:30.550
specific problem,
but it's open ended.
In fact,

2049
02:00:30.551 --> 02:00:33.310
I'm not even totally sure I can define what the problem is.

2050
02:00:33.790 --> 02:00:38.680
Like I might need to carve out weeks where like the majority of my time is going

2051
02:00:38.681 --> 02:00:41.920
to be going into this activity that may or may not be productive and may or may

2052
02:00:41.921 --> 02:00:44.020
not be a terribly good use of my time.

2053
02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:47.110
It's just this rabbit hole that I kind of need to dig in.

2054
02:00:47.111 --> 02:00:52.111
And so that tends to be one where increasingly I'm trying to find chunks of my

2055
02:00:52.871 --> 02:00:54.280
life where I can literally carve out,

2056
02:00:54.281 --> 02:00:59.100
like I'm going to commit 20% of my time to basically attending to some of the

2057
02:00:59.101 --> 02:01:03.030
details of,
you know,
being married and have a family running a company.

2058
02:01:03.031 --> 02:01:05.720
But I'm also going to allocate a huge amount of my,

2059
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:10.560
my free time or I'm going to create a huge amount of free time to spend hours in

2060
02:01:10.561 --> 02:01:10.921
days.

2061
02:01:10.921 --> 02:01:14.610
And even in some cases more than a week just chugging away on this to see where

2062
02:01:14.611 --> 02:01:19.140
it gets.
Um,
and sometimes,
uh,
you know,
I come up at a zero,

2063
02:01:19.141 --> 02:01:20.550
like that was a waste of time,

2064
02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:25.870
but I've found over the last decade or so that those periods of time have turned

2065
02:01:26.271 --> 02:01:31.250
out to be incredibly important for finding something that's insanely valuable.

2066
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:32.660
<v 2>Well,
I,
you know,
I,</v>

2067
02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:37.610
this is maybe it's just rationalizing so that I don't go totally insane,

2068
02:01:37.611 --> 02:01:39.770
but I've,
I remember a

2069
02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:43.940
<v 3>coming to a similar conclusion related to writing because I became very</v>

2070
02:01:43.941 --> 02:01:48.941
frustrated once at a draft of a chapter where it was something like 10 pages in

2071
02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:53.840
nine and a half pages were just garbage.
I mean,
complete garbage.

2072
02:01:53.841 --> 02:01:55.040
But there was a colonel,

2073
02:01:55.550 --> 02:02:00.550
unlike the ninth page of a few paragraphs that ended up becoming the beginning

2074
02:02:00.711 --> 02:02:02.510
of a really strong chapter.
And I was like,
wow,

2075
02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:05.720
that was a really big fucking waste of time.
I can't believe that.

2076
02:02:05.721 --> 02:02:08.990
I only got a few paragraphs out of that.
And the,
uh,

2077
02:02:09.260 --> 02:02:12.920
one of my friends who I guess you could view as a mentor of sorts of very

2078
02:02:12.921 --> 02:02:15.770
seasoned,
successful writers said,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
You're missing the point.

2079
02:02:15.771 --> 02:02:20.060
Like you needed those first nine and a half shitty pages to get to the good

2080
02:02:20.061 --> 02:02:23.090
stuff.
You couldn't have started there.
And I was like,
oh,
okay,

2081
02:02:23.130 --> 02:02:24.980
that's at least a healthy way to look at it.

2082
02:02:25.850 --> 02:02:29.750
I basically totally agree with that.
If there's no shortcuts,

2083
02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:34.780
like I can look back on the evolution chef steps has gone through since 2012 or

2084
02:02:35.331 --> 02:02:37.300
the evolution I've gone through since,
uh,

2085
02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:41.420
99 2000 and I can see all of these periods where it was like,
oh,

2086
02:02:41.421 --> 02:02:44.510
that wasn't super productive or I didn't accomplish what I had hoped to

2087
02:02:44.511 --> 02:02:47.420
accomplish with that.
It's easy in hindsight to say,
well,

2088
02:02:47.421 --> 02:02:50.360
maybe you could have cut that out or maybe you could have shortened this

2089
02:02:50.361 --> 02:02:52.700
timescale in the market or something like that.
And it's like,
I don't,

2090
02:02:53.180 --> 02:02:53.901
I don't think so.

2091
02:02:53.901 --> 02:02:56.780
I don't think we would have had the thoughts or reach as a comment a certain

2092
02:02:56.781 --> 02:02:59.900
rate.
And all of those things in some way tend to lead into the,

2093
02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:04.160
into that solution.
There's so much,
uh,
of the,

2094
02:03:04.180 --> 02:03:08.600
so many people I read that it's focused on efficacy and being effective in

2095
02:03:08.601 --> 02:03:12.590
managing your time.
And doing these things as if there's anybody,

2096
02:03:12.860 --> 02:03:17.860
anybody like that sitting in this room that is about how to basically get there

2097
02:03:17.961 --> 02:03:18.381
faster.

2098
02:03:18.381 --> 02:03:22.310
And there are absolutely things in life that are amenable to going faster.

2099
02:03:22.311 --> 02:03:27.140
But the really interesting stuff,
the stuff where like nobody else is doing it,

2100
02:03:27.170 --> 02:03:30.460
it really is a breakthrough or it is an invention or is an innovation or it's

2101
02:03:30.461 --> 02:03:32.300
just a new piece of art or whatever it is.

2102
02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:35.750
It takes the time it takes and you can't force it.
Well,
there's also,

2103
02:03:35.751 --> 02:03:36.321
I mean another way to,

2104
02:03:36.321 --> 02:03:39.020
sorry to interrupt with like another way to look at it is like to optimize the

2105
02:03:39.021 --> 02:03:39.531
process.

2106
02:03:39.531 --> 02:03:43.760
There has to be a process and if you're trying to connect dots that have never

2107
02:03:43.761 --> 02:03:45.860
been connected before or create the dots,

2108
02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:49.700
there is no algorithm to tweak yet.
I mean,

2109
02:03:49.740 --> 02:03:53.450
but other people might argue differently and I think there are some tools that I

2110
02:03:53.451 --> 02:03:56.600
found helpful like the Edward de Bono six thinking hats type of stuff.

2111
02:03:56.600 --> 02:04:00.110
But generally you're just sitting there fucking staring at your navel a lot.

2112
02:04:00.210 --> 02:04:04.820
Yeah.
And waiting for an apple then totally useless.

2113
02:04:05.190 --> 02:04:08.910
Um,
I'm working really hard.
Trust me.
I actually okay with that.

2114
02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:12.810
I people and like thankfully you haven't asked us because I,

2115
02:04:12.811 --> 02:04:15.500
I have no good answer of like,
what's your creative process?
I have no idea.

2116
02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:18.800
Like I like I could make something up.

2117
02:04:18.830 --> 02:04:21.890
I don't actually spend a lot of time thinking about my creative process.

2118
02:04:21.891 --> 02:04:26.240
I mostly focused on the what are the interesting ideas that I'm having right now

2119
02:04:26.241 --> 02:04:31.241
that seem worth pursuing and for whatever reason one may win out over another,

2120
02:04:32.001 --> 02:04:36.020
it pulls on me more strongly and I just follow that and that has like served me

2121
02:04:36.021 --> 02:04:38.310
super well.
It's like you keep meeting these people,

2122
02:04:38.311 --> 02:04:39.630
you keep you eating these things and it's,

2123
02:04:39.631 --> 02:04:42.510
I've just pulled on threads and follow where they go.

2124
02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:46.410
I want to hit you with some rapid fire questions.
Number one,

2125
02:04:46.411 --> 02:04:48.250
what is your creative process?
No,

2126
02:04:49.170 --> 02:04:51.540
please describe for the next 10 minutes your creative process.

2127
02:04:52.650 --> 02:04:54.360
What do you think of the word successful?

2128
02:04:54.570 --> 02:04:58.020
Who's the first person who comes to mind and why?

2129
02:04:58.650 --> 02:05:03.650
My father and because I think he's actually had a pretty happy life.

2130
02:05:03.870 --> 02:05:06.690
He has a family around him.

2131
02:05:06.691 --> 02:05:11.691
He's achieved some business success and he's done a lot of things that he's

2132
02:05:12.331 --> 02:05:13.770
created a lot of meaning for people.

2133
02:05:13.771 --> 02:05:17.790
And so I admire that the fact that he has created a lot of meaning for people in

2134
02:05:17.791 --> 02:05:22.080
his house.
So what type of meaning?
Um,
I suppose I would answer it by,

2135
02:05:22.081 --> 02:05:26.610
it depends on who we're talking about.
I think in,
I think in,
in,

2136
02:05:26.611 --> 02:05:28.860
in the world of,
of his employees,

2137
02:05:28.861 --> 02:05:32.700
a lot of the employees have been there for as long as the business of around and

2138
02:05:32.701 --> 02:05:36.780
they find value in it.
They find a and a meaningful thing to do with,

2139
02:05:36.781 --> 02:05:38.040
with their lives.

2140
02:05:38.041 --> 02:05:41.670
And the fact that there's been that loyalty to them and they've,
and they've,

2141
02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:46.380
they've clearly felt that it was a valuable use of their time,
uh,

2142
02:05:46.410 --> 02:05:49.320
that was meaningful for his family.
It's the fact that,
um,

2143
02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:52.500
we're still a family and that he's created meaning for me and meaning for my

2144
02:05:52.501 --> 02:05:57.180
brother and my mother.
And more broadly speaking,
our extended family,
we had,

2145
02:05:57.330 --> 02:06:01.440
we had lots of exchange students growing up,
especially through high school.

2146
02:06:01.830 --> 02:06:04.710
And they still come back and visit and they're coming back with their families

2147
02:06:04.711 --> 02:06:08.310
now and they really attach a lot of importance and meaning to their time with my

2148
02:06:08.311 --> 02:06:12.240
family.
And,
uh,
and that was really created for my father and my mother as well.

2149
02:06:12.270 --> 02:06:17.100
Um,
so how did they create that bond?
Or what were the,
what were the ways?

2150
02:06:17.130 --> 02:06:20.050
Because that's in my jeans.
That's unusual,
right?
It's,
it's atypical.
I mean,

2151
02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:24.360
I guess I never thought it was that atypical,
but um,

2152
02:06:24.390 --> 02:06:29.230
because I think they were very inclusive and supportive of,
of these people and,

2153
02:06:29.231 --> 02:06:34.180
and made sure they had a memorable year and that they,
um,

2154
02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:38.940
got to do fun things,
fun things as a family felt included in our family.

2155
02:06:39.150 --> 02:06:42.030
And even after they'd left,
you know,
we'd stay in touch,

2156
02:06:42.031 --> 02:06:45.480
we'd go on trip to Europe and we'd see them.
And so,
you know,
I think that,

2157
02:06:46.060 --> 02:06:49.240
you know,
even 20 years later now,
we're still having reunions and,

2158
02:06:49.250 --> 02:06:53.250
and I think that's created a lot of meaning for people in their life other than

2159
02:06:53.251 --> 02:06:57.810
your dad.
If you had to pick a second person,
dead or alive,
doesn't matter.

2160
02:06:58.320 --> 02:07:02.490
Fictional or nonfictional?
Winston Churchill.
Winston Churchill.
Okay.

2161
02:07:02.780 --> 02:07:07.710
W why Winston?
So I think this,
I,
there's,
there's a great series of,
of,

2162
02:07:07.711 --> 02:07:08.700
of books,

2163
02:07:09.210 --> 02:07:14.210
the last lion by William Manchester on Winston Churchill and the f the third

2164
02:07:14.461 --> 02:07:18.420
volume actually just came out a few years ago posthumously,
but the first two,

2165
02:07:18.421 --> 02:07:22.140
which really only got up to his life at the outbreak of world war two,

2166
02:07:22.141 --> 02:07:25.140
like it didn't even touch on the,
everything that happened afterward to started.

2167
02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:29.580
Like I just remember being like,
he was a bestselling author by 20,

2168
02:07:29.581 --> 02:07:32.850
he'd fought in wars,
he was,
you know,
uh,

2169
02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:36.850
one of the highest paid writers.
He an important member of parliament,

2170
02:07:36.851 --> 02:07:40.240
all of these things.
And it's like he's a fascinating individual.

2171
02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:44.190
And I remember reading these and I was probably in my early twenties being this

2172
02:07:44.200 --> 02:07:47.860
like,
man,
I suck compared to this.
I am way behind.

2173
02:07:47.861 --> 02:07:49.600
So I think on some level it was like,

2174
02:07:50.380 --> 02:07:53.580
that's what historic level of success looks like.
And,

2175
02:07:53.581 --> 02:07:57.220
and like as a history professor pointed out to me,

2176
02:07:57.760 --> 02:08:01.030
you weren't born into the British aristocracy of say you're working with a

2177
02:08:01.031 --> 02:08:03.730
deficit to begin with,
which like fair enough.

2178
02:08:04.180 --> 02:08:06.250
But I think I've always looked at it,

2179
02:08:06.730 --> 02:08:10.740
things like that as as being like of lasting significance and,

2180
02:08:10.741 --> 02:08:12.460
and I suppose that drives me on some level.

2181
02:08:12.850 --> 02:08:16.330
That description makes me want to see a celebrity death match.

2182
02:08:16.420 --> 02:08:20.560
Claymation of Winston Churchill versus Ben Franklin.
Oh,

2183
02:08:20.561 --> 02:08:22.490
Churchill is totally taken frank down and he was a,

2184
02:08:22.491 --> 02:08:26.010
he was a crippled and Churchill has them en masse by at least five x.

2185
02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:30.370
He's like,
he's drunk.
He was a big unit.
Yeah.
And he could hold his liquor.

2186
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:32.740
Do you have any superstitions?

2187
02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:37.950
And the reason I ask is that I find it in a way a stress reduction for me to

2188
02:08:41.020 --> 02:08:45.790
prize a handful of superstitions because I tried to be so hyper analytical and

2189
02:08:45.791 --> 02:08:48.640
other areas like I don't like using red pens for instance,

2190
02:08:48.641 --> 02:08:50.680
which I think I picked up an Asia somewhere.

2191
02:08:50.681 --> 02:08:53.200
They don't like using red ink for a handful of things.

2192
02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:55.690
Cheersing with water don't like it.

2193
02:08:55.900 --> 02:08:58.960
I don't know if this qualifies as a superstition,

2194
02:08:59.110 --> 02:09:02.350
but as much as I said like I'm about lack of structure and stuff,

2195
02:09:02.380 --> 02:09:07.380
I certainly found as a writer that it was incredibly important for me to have

2196
02:09:10.151 --> 02:09:12.550
certain things.
Just so with writing,

2197
02:09:12.910 --> 02:09:17.650
I would have a very specific ritual about driving to a very specific coffee shop

2198
02:09:17.651 --> 02:09:21.010
and I had to have sort of one or two very specific tables.
If,

2199
02:09:21.130 --> 02:09:22.240
if they were like filled,

2200
02:09:22.570 --> 02:09:27.250
like I'd sit there with my coffee just sort of like leering at them.
I'm like,

2201
02:09:27.251 --> 02:09:29.560
you are taking my table,
don't you know,

2202
02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:32.980
like that I'm trying to finish a manuscript.
Excuse me.
So dude,

2203
02:09:33.010 --> 02:09:36.790
do you know who I am?
It was like,
I come here so much,

2204
02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:38.850
this should be my table.
Um,

2205
02:09:39.640 --> 02:09:43.090
so that's one of these things where like I actually really,

2206
02:09:43.091 --> 02:09:46.660
really struggled to write if I broke that pattern.
So,

2207
02:09:46.661 --> 02:09:48.550
I don't know if it qualifies as a superstition,

2208
02:09:48.551 --> 02:09:52.300
but I certainly found like having the,
the,
the,
you know,

2209
02:09:52.301 --> 02:09:57.100
it's almost sort of like you need to like walk in a circle three times and you

2210
02:09:57.101 --> 02:10:00.580
know,
have this particular mug or none of the magic will work.

2211
02:10:00.700 --> 02:10:03.850
It's totally one of those.
And so if like something would go missing,

2212
02:10:04.420 --> 02:10:08.090
like it was total freak out.
Like I have to have that or I'm doomed.
So.

2213
02:10:08.380 --> 02:10:10.410
So you drive to the coffee shop?
Yeah.

2214
02:10:10.750 --> 02:10:13.330
What were the characteristics of the table that made it the right table?

2215
02:10:13.510 --> 02:10:15.700
It was in a window.
It was a two person table.

2216
02:10:15.710 --> 02:10:20.350
It's sat in such a way that people weren't terribly intrusive when they were

2217
02:10:20.351 --> 02:10:22.720
coming or going like you weren't constantly getting bumped,

2218
02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:26.710
but there was a bit of activity behind it that sort of provided just this white

2219
02:10:26.711 --> 02:10:30.790
noise that allowed me to focus.
So it was,
you know,

2220
02:10:30.791 --> 02:10:31.990
it wasn't that table per se,

2221
02:10:31.991 --> 02:10:36.890
it was that table in that particular coffee shop like worked where it was just

2222
02:10:36.891 --> 02:10:40.100
the right balance between feelings among people,

2223
02:10:40.490 --> 02:10:44.720
but without the distraction of people.
Do you listen to music when you write?

2224
02:10:44.930 --> 02:10:49.830
I will and usually some pretty,
a lot of techno,

2225
02:10:49.860 --> 02:10:52.910
a lot of late nineties techno.
I'm logically,

2226
02:10:52.980 --> 02:10:56.790
I might listen to like Paul Oakenfold live at the Ro Jan in Shanghai.

2227
02:10:56.791 --> 02:10:58.470
It's an essential mix and it's like,

2228
02:10:58.680 --> 02:11:00.840
to this day when I'm doing certain kinds of work,

2229
02:11:00.870 --> 02:11:03.390
it's put the headphones on and you know,

2230
02:11:03.391 --> 02:11:06.660
at soundcloud and it's old essential mixes with Pete Tong.

2231
02:11:06.810 --> 02:11:11.810
<v 2>How many pages of text that you were involved with in some capacity?</v>

2232
02:11:12.770 --> 02:11:16.310
We're in modernist cuisine roughly of the pages I wrote.

2233
02:11:16.311 --> 02:11:19.760
I think I wrote around 300,000 words.

2234
02:11:20.690 --> 02:11:23.570
So how many,
uh,
what does that break down too?
I mean,
that's like

2235
02:11:25.550 --> 02:11:28.160
pictures and full bloods outside to six

2236
02:11:28.470 --> 02:11:31.990
<v 3>full length book was,
it was a million over a slightly over a million words,
uh,</v>

2237
02:11:32.010 --> 02:11:35.430
for the,
for the final book.
And uh,
you know,
it was 20,

2238
02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.900
I think it was 2,400 pages.
It's long enough now I'm starting to forget,

2239
02:11:40.020 --> 02:11:42.150
but it 50 pounds of book

2240
02:11:42.240 --> 02:11:44.490
<v 2>when you did first drafts,</v>

2241
02:11:44.970 --> 02:11:49.260
was that on a computer by hand on a computer?
On a computer?
What program was it?

2242
02:11:49.261 --> 02:11:52.340
Just standard word.
They was worried at the time.
Yeah.
Um,

2243
02:11:53.110 --> 02:11:55.440
I experiment of some other things.
Um,

2244
02:11:56.380 --> 02:11:57.770
<v 3>I actually write,</v>

2245
02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:03.360
I write a lot with a program called AIAA writer because it sort of blank.

2246
02:12:03.660 --> 02:12:08.070
<v 2>It's everything out and a writer and I enjoy that.</v>

2247
02:12:08.071 --> 02:12:11.520
I think there's like cooler,
better stuff that I haven't even heard of yet,

2248
02:12:11.521 --> 02:12:14.370
but another one called Hemingway than a lot of folks have mentioned.

2249
02:12:14.490 --> 02:12:17.700
It's like I find something that works and just leave it alone.
Yeah.

2250
02:12:17.701 --> 02:12:21.240
There's one called scrivener that I've used for my last few books that I really

2251
02:12:21.241 --> 02:12:21.880
enjoy.

2252
02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:26.880
It's the reason I like it is that you can lay out all of your chapters within a

2253
02:12:27.841 --> 02:12:30.430
single window on the left hand side,
like a,

2254
02:12:30.431 --> 02:12:35.120
like a vertical scroll and you can move them around dragging and dropping into

2255
02:12:35.310 --> 02:12:40.260
say sections and then you can have a split pane on the right side showing the

2256
02:12:40.261 --> 02:12:44.220
texts that you're working on and then have your research notes below it,

2257
02:12:44.670 --> 02:12:48.090
which I just found so incredibly helpful for the last two books.

2258
02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:50.250
How do you edit when you,

2259
02:12:50.251 --> 02:12:53.850
when you have say your first brain dump of stuff,

2260
02:12:54.960 --> 02:12:57.690
how would you,
what is your editing process?

2261
02:12:58.860 --> 02:13:02.790
<v 3>There's like what does my good editing process and then like what is the battle</v>

2262
02:13:02.791 --> 02:13:03.630
I must fight?

2263
02:13:04.860 --> 02:13:09.860
My tendency is to actually edit myself as I write and do a lot of polishing that

2264
02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:14.730
really would be better served after I got the words out.

2265
02:13:15.150 --> 02:13:20.150
My preferred approach and what tends to be best for me is I do my writing in the

2266
02:13:21.161 --> 02:13:25.050
uh,
uh,
the evenings and I do my editing in the morning.
I like it.

2267
02:13:25.051 --> 02:13:28.180
I will usually wake up after having like written until three in the morning and

2268
02:13:28.181 --> 02:13:31.320
then I'll wake up at like nine,
nine 30 or 10 or whatever.
And I go back and like,

2269
02:13:31.321 --> 02:13:35.430
oh my God,
this was incredibly indulgent.
But you know,
there's 9,000 words,

2270
02:13:35.431 --> 02:13:38.160
so I'm going to be able to find some good nuggets here and I can start iterating

2271
02:13:38.161 --> 02:13:40.470
on it pretty quickly that,
that works well.

2272
02:13:41.070 --> 02:13:45.960
Would you kick out 9,000 words a session?
Uh,
I'm the sometimes,

2273
02:13:45.961 --> 02:13:50.310
yes.
Holy Shit.
That was usually all that would usually get paired down,

2274
02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:52.820
which three you tick is a lot.

2275
02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:56.970
I don't even remember that could end up in that.
That might end up,

2276
02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:01.170
it's something like 1500 words when it's done,
it's a,
it'll be a lot of slop.

2277
02:14:01.230 --> 02:14:04.560
Sometimes it'll be whole sections where it's just like I'll leave it there and,

2278
02:14:04.950 --> 02:14:08.220
and just,
uh,
picked up again.
So it's a total mess at that point.

2279
02:14:08.221 --> 02:14:09.780
But there's ideas to work with.

2280
02:14:09.781 --> 02:14:14.781
I got the ideas down more typical session would probably be 750 to 2000 words

2281
02:14:15.841 --> 02:14:18.750
depending on the closer it was to seven 50 the user,

2282
02:14:18.780 --> 02:14:21.600
the usually the less work I had to do on editing,

2283
02:14:21.601 --> 02:14:26.601
but often it would take three times as long as if I just barfed out 300 or less

2284
02:14:27.091 --> 02:14:29.700
grist for the mill to work with in the first place.

2285
02:14:30.630 --> 02:14:34.320
What is your favorite documentary or movie or any favorites that come to mind?

2286
02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:39.930
So like right now I think I'm going through like a,
an eighties nostalgia Benj.

2287
02:14:39.990 --> 02:14:44.130
Uh,
I've been watching some John Hughes movies lately that I've enjoyed.
I,

2288
02:14:44.410 --> 02:14:49.380
I can't really do like a c what does the saving was Doubtfire or no,
no,

2289
02:14:49.381 --> 02:14:54.210
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's like Ferris Bueller's Day off and,
and uh,
stuff like that.
Um,

2290
02:14:54.690 --> 02:14:59.400
uh,
and old John Cusack movies that I've really,
really loved.

2291
02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:01.860
Pulp Fiction was like super.

2292
02:15:01.861 --> 02:15:04.620
So I was living in Germany at the time as an exchange student.

2293
02:15:05.190 --> 02:15:10.170
I was homesick and pulp fiction came out and I remember seeing it in German

2294
02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:13.440
because everything was dubbed there.
And Samuel L.

2295
02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:17.070
Jackson sounds horrible as a German,
I'm not a funny,

2296
02:15:17.430 --> 02:15:19.230
not Samuel L.
Jackson.

2297
02:15:19.231 --> 02:15:23.150
So I was lucky enough that I lived in oak right by the hall,
uh,
the,

2298
02:15:23.151 --> 02:15:25.140
the border between Holland,
Belgium and Germany.

2299
02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:29.340
So I remember driving to a town called hair Lynn and seen it in English and it

2300
02:15:29.341 --> 02:15:34.341
was like so great to basically just see some this movie in English after I had

2301
02:15:35.161 --> 02:15:37.440
been like hearing nothing but German and was super homesick.

2302
02:15:37.441 --> 02:15:40.350
So I like that movie still stands out as a movie.
I love documentaries.

2303
02:15:40.351 --> 02:15:44.370
Any documentaries?
Oh,
so this one sort of between,
I'd call this docu drama.

2304
02:15:44.371 --> 02:15:48.330
It's partly documentary and it's partly a not entirely true the right stuff.

2305
02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:53.430
I'm a pilot.
I love flying in that movie was just like,
I got to do this.

2306
02:15:53.460 --> 02:15:57.230
Like where do I sign up to get one of these rides?
So I need to see.

2307
02:15:57.270 --> 02:15:59.790
That's a great movie.
I haven't seen that film in ages.

2308
02:16:00.510 --> 02:16:05.510
What purchase of $100 or less has most positively impacted your life in recent

2309
02:16:06.691 --> 02:16:10.890
memory?
So I'll,
I'll,
I'll give two answers.
I bought a new electric tea kettle.

2310
02:16:10.891 --> 02:16:13.200
I used to do,
I used to have all the stove top kettles.

2311
02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:16.770
Like even though I knew that it was vastly better,

2312
02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:20.970
I underestimated how much better my life would be by having an electric tea

2313
02:16:20.971 --> 02:16:25.380
kettle so that I can have like tea actually quickly and more or less on demand

2314
02:16:25.381 --> 02:16:28.200
with very little fuss.
So like I think I paid,

2315
02:16:28.620 --> 02:16:31.960
I think I have an oxo clear a one button,

2316
02:16:32.170 --> 02:16:34.930
nothing fancy tea kettle and it's flipping awesome.

2317
02:16:34.931 --> 02:16:38.140
So much so that I've liked now bought them at work too so I can just have them

2318
02:16:38.141 --> 02:16:42.790
everywhere.
So that was great.
And I don't remember exactly what the price is,

2319
02:16:42.791 --> 02:16:45.970
but I'm going to go with it.
Anyway.
I bought,
I bought,

2320
02:16:45.971 --> 02:16:50.971
bought the we a DJ hero for my nine year old son and me and it's awesome because

2321
02:16:52.331 --> 02:16:56.950
one,
he loves it and loves doing it,
but,
but to I totally won't let him win.

2322
02:16:57.010 --> 02:17:01.510
I used a brief Dj,
um,
back with some techniques and,
and,

2323
02:17:01.511 --> 02:17:02.740
and a college,

2324
02:17:02.741 --> 02:17:06.610
it was like my way of going to a fraternity party without having to go to the

2325
02:17:06.611 --> 02:17:09.220
fraternity party.
Like I get paid to go DJ and do them.

2326
02:17:09.580 --> 02:17:13.270
And so like when we get to like the scratching competitions and stuff with Jack,

2327
02:17:13.271 --> 02:17:16.030
like I totally can't let him win,
but we have so much fun with that.

2328
02:17:16.031 --> 02:17:18.190
So I think that might've been just over the threshold.

2329
02:17:18.460 --> 02:17:21.730
But in terms of like make my life awesome and time to spend with my son,

2330
02:17:21.731 --> 02:17:22.564
it's great.

2331
02:17:23.170 --> 02:17:27.880
If you were to teach a ninth or 10th grade class,

2332
02:17:28.210 --> 02:17:31.960
what would you focus on?
What would you teach?
Tough call.

2333
02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:37.200
It's a tossup between Shakespeare or I'd be really interested in doing a history

2334
02:17:38.351 --> 02:17:42.910
of science class history of science.
Why Shakespeare?

2335
02:17:43.450 --> 02:17:44.860
I had a phenomenal,

2336
02:17:44.861 --> 02:17:47.980
a teacher in high school that taught me to write John Fitzpatrick.

2337
02:17:47.980 --> 02:17:49.810
I think he passed away about a year ago,

2338
02:17:49.811 --> 02:17:52.690
which is a bummer because I haven't seen him in probably two decades,

2339
02:17:52.691 --> 02:17:55.690
but he taught a whole year of Shakespeare and I,

2340
02:17:55.700 --> 02:17:58.480
and I signed up for it because as a senior,

2341
02:17:59.140 --> 02:18:03.460
because I'd had him as a sophomore English teacher and right when like every

2342
02:18:03.461 --> 02:18:07.300
other teacher hated me or like just,
I was a pain in their butt.

2343
02:18:07.750 --> 02:18:12.750
Like he sort of mentored me and put up with a lot of my shenanigans or my

2344
02:18:14.171 --> 02:18:18.940
laziness of turning stuff in.
And he really pushed me to,
to,
to right.
I mean,

2345
02:18:18.941 --> 02:18:20.710
as a sophomore I think I was right having to write five,

2346
02:18:20.711 --> 02:18:24.910
eight page like real papers where and where you're really exploring literature.

2347
02:18:25.210 --> 02:18:29.050
So I signed up for him when he taught a year of Shakespeare in my senior year.

2348
02:18:29.051 --> 02:18:33.010
And I particularly remember the comedies of just the discussions we had around

2349
02:18:33.011 --> 02:18:38.011
it and the ideas and how actually funny they were and how humorous they were

2350
02:18:38.741 --> 02:18:41.590
and,
and,
and how great some of the themes were.

2351
02:18:42.430 --> 02:18:45.610
Totally blew my mind because like up until then,
Shakespeare's like this really,

2352
02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:50.020
um,
uh,
poncy English literature kind of thing to go do.

2353
02:18:50.021 --> 02:18:53.680
And actually it was hysterical and they were a blast to read them.
So I would,

2354
02:18:54.490 --> 02:18:56.320
I'd want other people to experience that.

2355
02:18:56.590 --> 02:18:59.770
I don't know if I could do it justice in the history of science would be option

2356
02:18:59.771 --> 02:19:04.660
number two.
Yeah,
I think,
uh,
you know,
I,
I suppose I do.

2357
02:19:04.661 --> 02:19:08.230
I don't know that I do science.
I do engineering now.
I think a lot about science,

2358
02:19:08.231 --> 02:19:12.780
but I love the ideas.
I love the inevitable inevitable ness of the ideas.

2359
02:19:12.790 --> 02:19:14.890
I like the how one idea belt on another.

2360
02:19:14.891 --> 02:19:18.850
And when you really have a great history of science teacher who sort of tells

2361
02:19:18.851 --> 02:19:21.730
the story of how these things shaped culture shaped the world.

2362
02:19:22.270 --> 02:19:27.010
It makes science something more than just the formulas are the equations or

2363
02:19:27.140 --> 02:19:31.040
theorems or the idea is that you learn in a fairly dry science textbook,

2364
02:19:31.460 --> 02:19:35.860
no matter how much they've made an artsy with sidebars in,
in,
in,

2365
02:19:35.870 --> 02:19:39.500
in graphics,
it's,
there were fact that there were people involved in,

2366
02:19:39.501 --> 02:19:40.640
it wasn't at all.

2367
02:19:40.641 --> 02:19:45.120
Like at the time they might've been hugely controversial ideas and it wasn't so

2368
02:19:45.300 --> 02:19:47.640
obvious at the time that like,
you know,

2369
02:19:48.990 --> 02:19:51.460
the calculus was right or that,
you know,

2370
02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:56.250
air was a thing or that germs were a thing and how much controversy and how much

2371
02:19:56.251 --> 02:19:58.710
human nests that were around these ideas.

2372
02:19:59.430 --> 02:20:04.020
I love that because I think I sort of see it on a day to day basis when you're

2373
02:20:04.021 --> 02:20:07.590
inventing stuff,
it feels totally nuts at the time and you're like,

2374
02:20:07.591 --> 02:20:10.110
is anybody going to like think this was was worthwhile?

2375
02:20:10.930 --> 02:20:11.170
<v 2>Well,</v>

2376
02:20:11.170 --> 02:20:16.090
it also makes me think of a dinner I just had last week,

2377
02:20:16.240 --> 02:20:18.970
which was an incredible,
rare opportunity.

2378
02:20:18.971 --> 02:20:23.080
But I had a chance to go to a small group dinner with Jim Watson and Watson and

2379
02:20:23.081 --> 02:20:27.420
crick and I mean,
he's gotta be,

2380
02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:32.130
I don't know exactly,
late eighties,
maybe,
uh,
maybe nine,

2381
02:20:32.131 --> 02:20:36.910
maybe nineties,
and completely lucid.
And I was two chairs away,
you know,

2382
02:20:36.911 --> 02:20:39.880
so that was one person's separated from him.
Uh,

2383
02:20:39.990 --> 02:20:43.530
so co-discoverer of the Double Helix and,
uh,
you know,

2384
02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:45.450
turns out I didn't realize this,

2385
02:20:45.570 --> 02:20:50.570
but he has probably a half a dozen other discoveries that would have been anyone

2386
02:20:50.701 --> 02:20:54.780
else's life work.
And he has a collection of them.
And I,

2387
02:20:54.840 --> 02:20:55.910
but I remember having a,

2388
02:20:56.020 --> 02:21:00.480
I had a number of short conversations with him and also overheard a lot of,

2389
02:21:00.481 --> 02:21:04.530
is fascinating conversations with other folks.
I remember thinking,
you know,

2390
02:21:04.540 --> 02:21:06.190
if this were 25 years ago,

2391
02:21:06.310 --> 02:21:11.310
I could totally see this one encounter veering me off into becoming a scientist

2392
02:21:13.121 --> 02:21:13.600
of some type.

2393
02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:17.950
I mean just that one encounter could totally see it by sort of meeting someone

2394
02:21:17.951 --> 02:21:22.690
who embodies all the things that felt irrelevant when they're being thrown up by

2395
02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:25.690
someone who is far lesser,

2396
02:21:25.900 --> 02:21:29.500
far lesser and just not passionate or particularly interested in conveying it to

2397
02:21:29.501 --> 02:21:33.070
me in an in a compelling way.
What are your morning rituals?

2398
02:21:33.570 --> 02:21:35.460
What does the first students,
60 minutes of your day?

2399
02:21:35.690 --> 02:21:37.340
<v 3>Uh,
first 60 minutes of the day.</v>

2400
02:21:37.341 --> 02:21:40.370
So I'm not human if I don't have a shower that's like super,

2401
02:21:40.371 --> 02:21:42.530
super important to me.
What time do you usually wake up?

2402
02:21:42.531 --> 02:21:44.690
I know it sounds like it moves that moves a lot.

2403
02:21:44.691 --> 02:21:47.840
So I given my own devices,

2404
02:21:47.841 --> 02:21:52.580
I probably naturally we'll wake up between nine and 10 most days.

2405
02:21:53.060 --> 02:21:57.350
I would naturally usually work till three or four in the morning.
Um,
I'm,

2406
02:21:57.940 --> 02:22:01.840
I actually experimented with like Bi phasic sleep in college and I would totally

2407
02:22:01.841 --> 02:22:05.950
do that still if it didn't make me so unbelievably antisocial.

2408
02:22:06.010 --> 02:22:08.420
So what kind of biophysics?
Sleeping?
Uh,

2409
02:22:08.450 --> 02:22:13.450
I would basically sleep from 4:00 PM til 8:00 PM and I would work from 8:00 PM

2410
02:22:14.351 --> 02:22:15.760
till two or three in the morning.

2411
02:22:15.761 --> 02:22:18.580
And then I would sleep from two or three in the morning until usually around

2412
02:22:18.581 --> 02:22:19.414
eight or 9:00 AM.

2413
02:22:20.030 --> 02:22:23.670
<v 2>Yeah.
It sounds like the Argentines schedule.
I was wondering how they survived.</v>

2414
02:22:23.671 --> 02:22:26.040
I was in Argentina and they would stay out four in the morning,
then go

2415
02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:29.280
<v 3>to work in the morning and,
and I tried to match that.
Now it's just like,</v>

2416
02:22:29.281 --> 02:22:32.460
how are these fuckers is surviving?
I don't get it.
And then it's like,
oh no,
no,

2417
02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:35.700
no.
Those were,
everybody disappeared.
Yeah,
they have like a two hour lunch,

2418
02:22:35.701 --> 02:22:38.130
then they go home at four 30 and sleep until eight o'clock.

2419
02:22:38.180 --> 02:22:42.360
So I should move to Argentina to go fly gliders is what I think the conclusion

2420
02:22:42.361 --> 02:22:46.560
is I have here.
Um,
it's socially acceptable there.
So you take a shower,

2421
02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:48.170
the shower,
I,

2422
02:22:48.560 --> 02:22:53.340
I will usually eat something if I'm not feeling totally rushed for time.

2423
02:22:53.700 --> 02:22:56.130
It's bacon and eggs.
I'm particularly right now,

2424
02:22:56.131 --> 02:22:58.710
there's a recipe on chest ups called the Emoji egg,

2425
02:22:59.010 --> 02:23:01.320
which is basically an egg cracked into a nonstick pan.

2426
02:23:01.321 --> 02:23:05.310
He did very slowly until it looks like the perfect Emoji of a sunny side up egg

2427
02:23:05.640 --> 02:23:09.420
like that.
Maybe a piece of toast and Bacon is great,

2428
02:23:11.070 --> 02:23:14.970
but there's a 50,
50 chance that I'm just going out the door at that point.

2429
02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:19.200
And the very next stop is a espresso.

2430
02:23:19.950 --> 02:23:22.710
We have very nice espresso machines,

2431
02:23:22.740 --> 02:23:25.490
courtesy of La Marzocco at chef steps and uh,

2432
02:23:25.500 --> 02:23:30.180
we keep the entire company caffeinated.
We keep a world Barista on the team.

2433
02:23:30.510 --> 02:23:32.280
Everybody like our,
our,

2434
02:23:32.281 --> 02:23:35.730
our job training is if this whole thing doesn't work out with the company,

2435
02:23:35.731 --> 02:23:39.210
everybody at chef steps is capable of being a Barista.
Um,

2436
02:23:39.211 --> 02:23:41.580
so I get through with the right town for it.
Totally.

2437
02:23:42.100 --> 02:23:45.990
I have a lot of stiff competition.
We've got to raise the bar.
But uh,
uh,

2438
02:23:45.991 --> 02:23:50.700
so I start the day like many people at that point I will have a latte at work,

2439
02:23:50.701 --> 02:23:54.180
usually a more traditional size of five or a six ounce latte.

2440
02:23:54.181 --> 02:23:57.960
I don't like a ton of milk,
but it's like,
that's kind of the ritual of okay,

2441
02:23:57.961 --> 02:24:00.840
now I can start dealing with whatever I need to do.

2442
02:24:01.020 --> 02:24:06.020
If you did not have machines to help you make espresso,

2443
02:24:07.350 --> 02:24:11.100
how would you make a good cup of coffee?
I'd bet you make a tea.
Yeah.

2444
02:24:11.280 --> 02:24:13.350
So you wouldn't use a chemist or press any of the,

2445
02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:17.580
I have all that and I don't mind it but it's,
if somebody else wants it,

2446
02:24:17.610 --> 02:24:18.210
I'll do it.

2447
02:24:18.210 --> 02:24:23.210
It's a bit fussy but I gotta be kind of like during my time at the fat duck we

2448
02:24:23.521 --> 02:24:26.220
had builders,
tea,
um,
tp tips,

2449
02:24:26.221 --> 02:24:31.140
just like you came in a giant garbage bag basically stuffed with like really

2450
02:24:31.141 --> 02:24:36.120
crappy like tea dust and that with a bunch of milk is just like milky tea.

2451
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:40.430
It's really satisfying in some sort of cringe worthy way.
And,

2452
02:24:40.431 --> 02:24:42.930
and I have nicer t than that at home,

2453
02:24:42.931 --> 02:24:45.960
but it's still something about the ritual of make some tea.
I steep it,

2454
02:24:45.961 --> 02:24:47.830
I like a little bit of milk and,

2455
02:24:48.310 --> 02:24:51.870
and if I'm writing or something I can drink gallons of that and not feel guilty.

2456
02:24:51.870 --> 02:24:53.970
Like I only need to go to the bathroom a lot,

2457
02:24:54.780 --> 02:24:58.650
but it's really satisfying and it just like that's my break every 50 minutes or

2458
02:24:58.651 --> 02:25:02.720
so I needed to make another big of that builder's tea builder's tea.
It's,

2459
02:25:02.930 --> 02:25:04.650
it's a British a saying of like,

2460
02:25:04.680 --> 02:25:08.580
so like the builders on a job site at some point they all get around and make a

2461
02:25:08.581 --> 02:25:11.400
cup of tea and this was like the cheap ass,

2462
02:25:11.990 --> 02:25:14.220
like cheapest bulk tea you could buy.

2463
02:25:14.610 --> 02:25:17.610
And because like the fat duck was a three Michelin Star Restaurant,

2464
02:25:17.611 --> 02:25:22.110
which meant we made no money.
Right.
That was what we had.
That's,

2465
02:25:22.140 --> 02:25:25.240
that's something that as a the customers we had much nicer.
That's,

2466
02:25:25.241 --> 02:25:28.600
that's something that surprised me when I was in the midst of working on the

2467
02:25:28.601 --> 02:25:30.460
four hour chef,
which of course you were involved with.

2468
02:25:30.461 --> 02:25:33.010
And realizing that in effect,

2469
02:25:33.100 --> 02:25:37.990
the higher the quality of the food and drink,

2470
02:25:38.230 --> 02:25:40.810
well the food especially served at a restaurant,

2471
02:25:40.811 --> 02:25:43.870
the lower the margins appear to be.
It's like the more expensive,

2472
02:25:43.871 --> 02:25:47.590
the better the food,
the harder it is to run as a business in effect.

2473
02:25:48.130 --> 02:25:51.640
I guess I didn't tell the story of,
of nearly going bankrupt at the fat duck.

2474
02:25:51.641 --> 02:25:55.360
I mean I,
I was,
uh,
I was there so I,
you know,
it's not really,

2475
02:25:55.361 --> 02:25:56.740
my story has Heston story but,

2476
02:25:57.100 --> 02:25:59.440
but I'll tell it because it gives some context to this.

2477
02:25:59.950 --> 02:26:02.140
So we were a two star restaurant in a,

2478
02:26:02.141 --> 02:26:05.680
in most to star restaurants are really just a three star restaurant that's going

2479
02:26:05.681 --> 02:26:09.640
out of business.
This was January of 2004.

2480
02:26:09.670 --> 02:26:11.050
We were at Madrid fusion,

2481
02:26:11.051 --> 02:26:16.051
which at the time was like the biggest chef conference in the world and we were

2482
02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:21.220
unknown and like frosted ray was the biggest chef in the world at the time.

2483
02:26:21.970 --> 02:26:23.590
Jay Jockey,
James Petri,

2484
02:26:23.591 --> 02:26:27.610
who is our pastry chef and I were basically prepping backstage all week for our

2485
02:26:27.611 --> 02:26:31.810
demo and all these chefs from all these restaurants in Madrid and around Spain.

2486
02:26:32.110 --> 02:26:34.810
We're coming around watching what we were doing because like we were basically

2487
02:26:34.811 --> 02:26:36.820
doing crazy stuff.
We had liquid nitrogen,

2488
02:26:36.821 --> 02:26:41.020
nobody had seen that we were doing stuff with pressure cookers and vacuum pumps

2489
02:26:41.021 --> 02:26:45.160
and all sorts of crazy stuff.
And like in the background of all this,

2490
02:26:45.161 --> 02:26:49.330
like Heston couldn't make payroll on Friday and so there's like a ton of stress

2491
02:26:49.331 --> 02:26:52.900
on his,
uh,
from him about that and like,
you know,

2492
02:26:52.901 --> 02:26:56.050
we are at this really lavish event and we are super well taken care of.

2493
02:26:56.051 --> 02:26:57.040
Meanwhile,
back in,

2494
02:26:57.041 --> 02:27:02.041
in in Bray like couldn't pay the bills because there were no customers are not

2495
02:27:02.081 --> 02:27:02.980
enough customers.

2496
02:27:03.010 --> 02:27:08.010
And I remember we were out for lunch with Nick Lander from the Financial Times

2497
02:27:08.711 --> 02:27:09.011
he was there,

2498
02:27:09.011 --> 02:27:14.011
food cracky taken us out to lunch and we were coming back to the conference and

2499
02:27:14.141 --> 02:27:18.100
we were slotted like last slot in the day.
Everybody's usually gone by then,

2500
02:27:18.101 --> 02:27:21.580
but because of all the craziness people had been seen us do all week,

2501
02:27:21.581 --> 02:27:23.530
there was a buzz going around.
I'm like,
you've got to stay for this,

2502
02:27:23.531 --> 02:27:28.070
you've got to stay for this.
So Heston Gay,
um,

2503
02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:30.310
got the order out a little bit.

2504
02:27:30.311 --> 02:27:34.060
We basically give that presentation at like the 6:30 PM slot,

2505
02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:38.500
get a standing ovation from like the 800 chefs and attention for Andrea jumps up

2506
02:27:38.501 --> 02:27:40.900
on stage,
throws his arm around.
Hasnin says like,

2507
02:27:40.901 --> 02:27:45.100
this is the most important chef cooking today.
And we're like,
like,

2508
02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:46.750
what just happened?
This is amazing.

2509
02:27:47.020 --> 02:27:50.530
Well next day we go to lunch and it's,
you know,

2510
02:27:50.531 --> 02:27:52.570
we're chatting with nick and all this and we come back and like,

2511
02:27:53.350 --> 02:27:54.880
we think the restaurant is going to be done.

2512
02:27:55.480 --> 02:28:00.100
Well Heston gets a call from machine,
his assistant and she's like,
you know,

2513
02:28:00.101 --> 02:28:02.740
I just got a very strange call from the telegraph saying,

2514
02:28:03.130 --> 02:28:06.700
what does it feel like to be the third chef in the UK to get their third

2515
02:28:06.701 --> 02:28:10.900
Michelin Star?
And had it has things like,
well the guide is not out yet.

2516
02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:14.020
Not out yet,
so somebody must be pulling your leg.
And she's like,
well,

2517
02:28:14.021 --> 02:28:14.531
I thought that.

2518
02:28:14.531 --> 02:28:17.440
So I hung up and I'd call the paper back and they confirmed a journalist was

2519
02:28:17.441 --> 02:28:18.370
working on this story.

2520
02:28:18.610 --> 02:28:21.010
So we're all kind of sitting in the car looking at trying to like,

2521
02:28:21.020 --> 02:28:24.200
well this can't be true.
And Nick just goes,
you know,
if it's true,

2522
02:28:24.201 --> 02:28:26.000
let me be the first to congratulate you.

2523
02:28:26.420 --> 02:28:28.970
And then right after Heston hangs up Rasheen Derek Balmer,

2524
02:28:28.971 --> 02:28:32.210
who is the head of the Michelin Guide Calls Heston cell phone is like,
you know,

2525
02:28:32.270 --> 02:28:35.330
I understand you're in Madrid,
we usually like to come in and tell you in person,

2526
02:28:35.331 --> 02:28:37.580
but congratulations,
you've earned your third star.

2527
02:28:38.270 --> 02:28:42.170
And so we're all gobsmacked and what nobody knew that night is we had zero

2528
02:28:42.171 --> 02:28:43.004
customers.

2529
02:28:43.680 --> 02:28:47.220
The next day the phone was ringing off the hook and three months later we were

2530
02:28:47.221 --> 02:28:50.250
voted best restaurant in the world.
And that was actually um,

2531
02:28:50.490 --> 02:28:54.600
really how close it came to basic total implosion.

2532
02:28:55.200 --> 02:28:58.320
It was also I think a real lesson for me of one,

2533
02:28:58.590 --> 02:29:01.020
you don't do this for the money like this.

2534
02:29:01.440 --> 02:29:04.430
The fame and the celebrity and the TV shows and the books and all that in,

2535
02:29:04.431 --> 02:29:08.430
in future restaurants did eventually grown into a sizable empire for Huston.

2536
02:29:08.670 --> 02:29:10.500
But that wasn't what motivated him.

2537
02:29:10.501 --> 02:29:13.350
And I think that was really a big impression on me as well.
It's like,

2538
02:29:13.470 --> 02:29:17.340
this isn't why you choose to do things and it is going to get to be a knife edge

2539
02:29:17.341 --> 02:29:19.260
like at this,
at some point you have to have faith that it,

2540
02:29:19.330 --> 02:29:23.250
<v 2>it's going to work through under the other side.
I have no idea where that,
no,
no,</v>

2541
02:29:23.260 --> 02:29:23.951
it's a great story.

2542
02:29:23.951 --> 02:29:28.480
It also makes you wonder how many people who would have been the best in the

2543
02:29:28.481 --> 02:29:32.920
world are recognized.
Just missed it by that razor's edge,
you know,

2544
02:29:32.921 --> 02:29:34.210
like they one day,
right?

2545
02:29:34.211 --> 02:29:37.450
Like the demo came a week after they already missed payroll and that was it.

2546
02:29:37.500 --> 02:29:39.760
Like they couldn't do it.
Uh,

2547
02:29:39.761 --> 02:29:44.680
which is why I think one of the dangers and a place like silicon valley is you

2548
02:29:44.681 --> 02:29:49.630
see these exceptional successes lionized on magazine covers.

2549
02:29:49.960 --> 02:29:54.250
But it's a lot like the survivorship bias you might see in like a Barron's or

2550
02:29:54.251 --> 02:29:56.830
something where it's like you have all these amazing mutual funds that are

2551
02:29:56.831 --> 02:29:59.980
advertising how well I've done for the last five or six years.
And it's like,

2552
02:29:59.981 --> 02:30:00.221
well,

2553
02:30:00.221 --> 02:30:05.221
those are like the five out of a thousand who managed the gear are gone by skill

2554
02:30:05.861 --> 02:30:09.220
or luck.
And you don't know,
uh,
and uh,

2555
02:30:09.230 --> 02:30:13.750
it's easy to get sucked in to that sort of fallacy when you don't see the
bodies.

2556
02:30:14.140 --> 02:30:15.640
But I guess on that note,

2557
02:30:15.641 --> 02:30:20.170
just in terms of these lessons learned and looking at advice that you would give

2558
02:30:20.200 --> 02:30:21.520
others then in turn,

2559
02:30:21.790 --> 02:30:26.740
what advice would you give your,
uh,

2560
02:30:26.840 --> 02:30:31.780
let's say 25 year old self?
If you could place us where you were,

2561
02:30:31.781 --> 02:30:36.070
what you were doing or you could choose when you were graduating from a,

2562
02:30:36.650 --> 02:30:39.950
<v 3>from college.
Graduating college is a very diffuse thing for me.</v>

2563
02:30:39.951 --> 02:30:44.120
I think it was actually in 2003 I actually applied for my degrees because I

2564
02:30:44.121 --> 02:30:46.640
needed them to get my British work permit.
It was one of those,

2565
02:30:46.641 --> 02:30:50.270
I'll leave the backdoor open because I'm technically just on sabbatical.

2566
02:30:50.271 --> 02:30:54.800
I could always come back.
Um,
even though I stopped going by,
uh,

2567
02:30:54.880 --> 02:30:59.260
2001,
I think the,
so,
so I don't know that like when you graduate,

2568
02:30:59.270 --> 02:31:02.780
graduate colleges is all that,
all that relevant to me.

2569
02:31:02.990 --> 02:31:06.290
I think the more interesting question is what would I basically tell myself in

2570
02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:08.000
my later twenties?

2571
02:31:08.810 --> 02:31:13.630
I think the advice I would try to give myself is to dispense with a lot more of

2572
02:31:13.631 --> 02:31:15.590
the ego and Hubris.
I'd ended up in a,

2573
02:31:15.591 --> 02:31:20.310
in a very influential position at a very famous place that felt like you were on

2574
02:31:20.311 --> 02:31:23.490
top of the world.
And that does go to your head to have that success,

2575
02:31:23.580 --> 02:31:25.850
that quickly,
that early,
um,

2576
02:31:25.920 --> 02:31:29.460
to be recognized for it and then to have a string of other great things happen.

2577
02:31:29.820 --> 02:31:30.630
You know,

2578
02:31:30.630 --> 02:31:35.500
you're surrounded by people that are telling you you're doing great stuff,
how,

2579
02:31:35.501 --> 02:31:37.830
how valuable this is,
how important you are.

2580
02:31:38.190 --> 02:31:41.520
And most of those people won't be around when that,
that,
that period is over.

2581
02:31:42.180 --> 02:31:46.050
But it becomes very seductive and you sort of keep aspiring to take that next

2582
02:31:46.051 --> 02:31:50.100
step up.
The Ziggurat,
it's totally irrelevant.
It's a total waste of time,

2583
02:31:50.101 --> 02:31:53.280
but it will make you a giant asshole.

2584
02:31:53.640 --> 02:31:57.270
I think that was something that it really took over the course of modernist and

2585
02:31:57.271 --> 02:32:00.000
subsequent to monitors and the actually even founding chef steps for me to

2586
02:32:00.001 --> 02:32:05.001
really grapple with and find comfort in the fact that I'm not really that

2587
02:32:05.071 --> 02:32:08.850
interested in celebrity or uh,

2588
02:32:08.890 --> 02:32:11.310
those kinds of accolades.
They're nice to get there.

2589
02:32:11.311 --> 02:32:13.410
No longer motivating for me at all.

2590
02:32:13.890 --> 02:32:17.310
And chasing those actually really made me a jerk because it'd be,

2591
02:32:17.311 --> 02:32:22.080
it got me very focused on who is getting credit for what,
how did you,

2592
02:32:22.110 --> 02:32:23.250
how'd you make that leap?
I mean,

2593
02:32:23.251 --> 02:32:28.251
a lot of people would prefer to be in that were of that mindset,

2594
02:32:28.980 --> 02:32:32.230
right?
And not be seduced by the celebrity,
et Cetera.
I mean,

2595
02:32:32.280 --> 02:32:36.630
what was the cause it had to be incredibly destructive,
you know,
for,
for me,

2596
02:32:37.110 --> 02:32:38.640
I spent five years at the fat duck.

2597
02:32:38.641 --> 02:32:42.300
I did a bunch of of work I'm incredibly proud of and there's many people I can

2598
02:32:42.301 --> 02:32:43.800
still consider strong friends,

2599
02:32:43.801 --> 02:32:47.520
but it was also realizing that I had created a future.

2600
02:32:47.521 --> 02:32:52.330
It wasn't tenable for me to stay for much longer because I was so har hardheaded

2601
02:32:52.350 --> 02:32:56.040
and so obstinate that it created a lot of friction between me and other senior

2602
02:32:56.041 --> 02:32:59.250
members of staff because I was pushing for something that I was convinced was

2603
02:32:59.251 --> 02:33:03.060
right.
But it basically made me very difficult to work with.

2604
02:33:03.090 --> 02:33:04.920
And just because you're right,

2605
02:33:05.820 --> 02:33:08.130
you're only going to go to get away with that so many times.

2606
02:33:08.131 --> 02:33:12.840
And so that was sort of the realization that a restaurant like that is built on

2607
02:33:12.841 --> 02:33:17.490
teamwork.
And yes,
some people can be doing really valuable work and yes,

2608
02:33:17.491 --> 02:33:19.590
some people can be exceptional,

2609
02:33:19.591 --> 02:33:22.530
are special and they do get certain amounts of dispensation.

2610
02:33:22.531 --> 02:33:23.730
But if that gets abused,

2611
02:33:24.090 --> 02:33:28.710
you're not going to be in a tenable position as soon as basically you've

2612
02:33:28.740 --> 02:33:31.950
delivered your value.
People aren't gonna want to work with you for much longer.

2613
02:33:32.340 --> 02:33:33.600
Working with people at modernists,

2614
02:33:33.601 --> 02:33:38.490
there was a lot of people on that team were very talented,
um,

2615
02:33:38.970 --> 02:33:43.500
exceptionally talented,
very difficult people to work with.
Um,
you know,

2616
02:33:43.890 --> 02:33:47.640
everyone involved in that project was accomplished with skillful,
um,

2617
02:33:47.710 --> 02:33:51.210
and had a pretty big ego to match and was pushing to do something exceptional.

2618
02:33:51.780 --> 02:33:54.210
We all got the work done at the end of it.

2619
02:33:54.211 --> 02:33:57.210
Nobody really wanted to do that again together.
Um,

2620
02:33:57.240 --> 02:34:01.050
I was actually lucky enough that like grant and Ryan and I still wanted to work

2621
02:34:01.051 --> 02:34:03.720
together after that.
But if you look at most of the team,

2622
02:34:03.721 --> 02:34:06.720
we sort of a scattered to the wind.
It was like,
okay,
the book's done.

2623
02:34:07.260 --> 02:34:08.280
We don't want to work as a team.

2624
02:34:08.281 --> 02:34:12.450
Was Chef steps one of the things that's really become clear to me as I work with

2625
02:34:12.451 --> 02:34:15.150
50 of the most exceptional people I've ever worked with,

2626
02:34:15.930 --> 02:34:18.670
I'm amazed at what do and what they accomplish.

2627
02:34:18.910 --> 02:34:22.010
The worst thing in the world for me would not be,
uh,

2628
02:34:22.020 --> 02:34:25.530
able to not being able to work with those people and see the types of things

2629
02:34:25.531 --> 02:34:26.364
they can do.

2630
02:34:26.550 --> 02:34:30.990
So I've really found a lot of my satisfaction is how do I enable other teams of

2631
02:34:30.991 --> 02:34:34.740
people?
How do we enable other people to do their best work?
That's on a good day.

2632
02:34:34.741 --> 02:34:35.551
How I feel about that.

2633
02:34:35.551 --> 02:34:39.660
I mean I have the same tension and struggles I think anyone does.

2634
02:34:39.990 --> 02:34:42.840
It's not like you suddenly flip a switch and you're perfect.
It's more,

2635
02:34:43.200 --> 02:34:45.330
I have seen how teams get blown up.

2636
02:34:45.690 --> 02:34:50.690
I've been a participant in that and that's really a longterm destructive pathway

2637
02:34:52.561 --> 02:34:55.470
to be on.
And at some point in my mid thirties,
it was like,

2638
02:34:55.471 --> 02:34:57.780
do you want to stay on this pathway or do you want to be able to do big,

2639
02:34:57.781 --> 02:35:00.000
ambitious things that take talented teams of people?

2640
02:35:00.001 --> 02:35:05.001
Because if so you've got to learn to basically check your ego so there's room

2641
02:35:05.071 --> 02:35:06.810
for other people to do their best work.

2642
02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:08.160
<v 2>Yeah.
And something,
I mean I've,</v>

2643
02:35:08.370 --> 02:35:13.320
I've struggled with this as well as also the shifting your focus from and of

2644
02:35:13.321 --> 02:35:17.880
course not always getting it right,
but from,
from being right to being effective,

2645
02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:23.610
uh,
and choosing the battles really carefully.
I was chatting with a,
uh,

2646
02:35:24.850 --> 02:35:27.480
I'm pretty well known political advisor,

2647
02:35:27.740 --> 02:35:30.420
not because I have any political aspirations,
but he,

2648
02:35:30.450 --> 02:35:31.450
he's become a friend of mine.

2649
02:35:31.550 --> 02:35:33.800
<v 3>I think there might be an opening for you this season</v>

2650
02:35:37.830 --> 02:35:38.330
too late.

2651
02:35:38.330 --> 02:35:42.650
<v 2>Oh God.
Yeah.
Who knows.
Know that's a whole separate wine,
uh,</v>

2652
02:35:42.800 --> 02:35:45.900
necessitating conversation.
But the,
um,

2653
02:35:47.110 --> 02:35:51.580
his advice to me at one point we were having wine and eating pizza and she did

2654
02:35:51.581 --> 02:35:55.180
was great.
This was in Venice,
California and Italy.

2655
02:35:55.210 --> 02:36:00.090
And I was telling him about the number of the multitude of places where I want

2656
02:36:00.091 --> 02:36:05.050
it to
start.
Initiatives have an impact.
And he just said to me,
he's like,

2657
02:36:05.051 --> 02:36:09.430
you know,
you should,
you should kind of think of this like a six shooter.

2658
02:36:09.431 --> 02:36:12.790
He's like,
you have six bullets.
And he's like,
you get to,

2659
02:36:12.890 --> 02:36:17.090
you get six bullets each year,
maybe every two years.
And he's like,

2660
02:36:17.091 --> 02:36:18.050
what are you going to use them on?

2661
02:36:18.710 --> 02:36:23.660
And that's how I've started to think a lot about kind of conflict resolution or

2662
02:36:23.661 --> 02:36:24.650
just conflict in general.

2663
02:36:24.651 --> 02:36:28.940
Like is this the fight if I only get to have six fights,
is this one of the sex,

2664
02:36:29.270 --> 02:36:33.350
am I going to spend a bullet on this?
And uh,
it's tough.

2665
02:36:33.380 --> 02:36:35.210
It's tough to follow your own advice when it comes to that stuff.

2666
02:36:35.211 --> 02:36:38.270
When you've been rewarded for so long for being a stubborn ass.

2667
02:36:39.740 --> 02:36:44.490
<v 3>That is actually exactly the problem is when you are talented,</v>

2668
02:36:44.491 --> 02:36:48.980
when you are good at what you do,
people will tolerate a lot of stuff.

2669
02:36:48.981 --> 02:36:53.750
As long as it serves their purposes,
as long as it's useful,
but you will get,
uh,

2670
02:36:53.840 --> 02:36:57.470
you will get no runway as soon as that,
that,
that's over.

2671
02:36:57.770 --> 02:37:00.920
And that's unfortunate because we're all going to hit rough patches.

2672
02:37:00.921 --> 02:37:05.090
We're all going to hit patches where you need people to basically cut you some

2673
02:37:05.091 --> 02:37:07.850
slack because you're not firing on all cylinders.

2674
02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:11.770
If you're basically insistent on being right all the time and,
and,

2675
02:37:11.771 --> 02:37:15.470
and controlling everything,
you're not going to get that slack.

2676
02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:18.110
If you could have one billboard anywhere with anything on it,

2677
02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:20.180
what would you put on that billboard?

2678
02:37:21.050 --> 02:37:25.030
I think it would probably have to erect it outside of my high school.
Okay.

2679
02:37:25.910 --> 02:37:30.440
Um,
I think I might have to erect at outside of my high school and uh,

2680
02:37:30.890 --> 02:37:34.640
and it,
I think,
I don't know exactly how I would art direct this,

2681
02:37:34.641 --> 02:37:38.600
but it's going to be something to the effect of it all worked out anyway.

2682
02:37:43.900 --> 02:37:45.860
[inaudible] was not a great time for me.

2683
02:37:49.910 --> 02:37:51.080
<v 0>I love it.
Uh,</v>

2684
02:37:52.050 --> 02:37:55.140
<v 3>and uh,
just,
just uh,
this is the last question.</v>

2685
02:37:55.141 --> 02:37:58.660
Any ask or request of the people listening,

2686
02:37:58.661 --> 02:38:01.220
anything they should ponder,
consider,

2687
02:38:01.221 --> 02:38:05.330
do or otherwise and then then we'll get to where they can find you and

2688
02:38:05.331 --> 02:38:08.180
everything you're up to.
Of course I have to,
uh,

2689
02:38:08.181 --> 02:38:11.660
I guess we'll call the call to actions.
So one,
if you're into cooking,

2690
02:38:11.661 --> 02:38:13.970
if you're curious about how cooking works,

2691
02:38:14.270 --> 02:38:16.070
come check out what we're doing at chef steps.

2692
02:38:16.071 --> 02:38:19.940
If you are interested in new tools,
things like that.

2693
02:38:19.941 --> 02:38:23.890
We have them also,
if you're essentially an awesome engineer,

2694
02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:27.040
whether a software engineer or a physical hardware engineer or you just amazing

2695
02:38:27.041 --> 02:38:29.560
at something and you,
it,
you can relate it to cooking it all.

2696
02:38:29.830 --> 02:38:30.760
We want to hear from you.

2697
02:38:31.150 --> 02:38:33.910
We want to work with more people who are passionate about cooking.

2698
02:38:33.911 --> 02:38:37.600
And have skills worth adding to the kitchen.
So that's,
that's the,

2699
02:38:37.601 --> 02:38:39.850
where would they find,
they can go to chef steps stuff.
You've got a chef,

2700
02:38:39.851 --> 02:38:43.360
steps.com.
There's a jobs link at the bottom.
If you don't see anything on there,

2701
02:38:43.390 --> 02:38:44.440
uh,
you know,

2702
02:38:45.090 --> 02:38:48.780
roll your own job description and tell us why we should basically take a serious

2703
02:38:48.781 --> 02:38:53.160
look at you.
We're,
we're,
we've,
we've hired applied mathematicians,

2704
02:38:53.430 --> 02:38:55.530
we've hired musicians,

2705
02:38:55.531 --> 02:38:59.340
we've hired a lot of unusual people that have found ways to add incredible value

2706
02:38:59.341 --> 02:39:02.220
at chef steps.
So we're pretty open minded there.
Um,

2707
02:39:02.510 --> 02:39:07.040
and if you just want to basically find some awesome cooking content or

2708
02:39:07.041 --> 02:39:11.420
inspiration for the kitchen or by some pretty damn cool tools,
uh,

2709
02:39:11.630 --> 02:39:15.960
that's another good reason to check it out.
Uh,
the other thing gliding,
um,

2710
02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:19.020
I have tried to introduce several people,
the gliding,
I haven't,

2711
02:39:19.050 --> 02:39:23.940
I haven't yet to take you up,
Mr Ferris.
I'm,
but I've taken Matt up.

2712
02:39:23.970 --> 02:39:28.320
I've taken quite a few and I've got a pretty good hit record of turning people

2713
02:39:28.321 --> 02:39:33.180
into glider pilots.
This sport could use more people.
It's awesome.
It's a blast.

2714
02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:38.180
Um,
you,
it,
it is incredibly compelling.
So check out,
uh,

2715
02:39:38.270 --> 02:39:42.540
the Soarian Society of America.
And if you're,
I dunno,
in the Bay area,
uh,

2716
02:39:42.541 --> 02:39:45.510
William Sorane and is a phenomenal place to learn.

2717
02:39:45.511 --> 02:39:48.990
There's a bunch of your leaves,
William Soaring.
Uh,
it's up near Sacramento,

2718
02:39:48.991 --> 02:39:51.660
but there's a bunch of other good clubs around here.

2719
02:39:51.850 --> 02:39:54.550
But I would encourage a lot of your listeners to check out.

2720
02:39:54.551 --> 02:39:58.770
Gliding it is a hell of a thing.
And it is a inc incredibly welcoming sport.

2721
02:39:59.020 --> 02:40:03.300
S what was it?
The soaring society of Soarian Society of America.
Ssa.

2722
02:40:03.710 --> 02:40:06.670
All right.
And there you have it.
So where can people,

2723
02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:10.860
if anywhere say hello on the social media and whatnot,

2724
02:40:10.890 --> 02:40:14.040
do you participate in such an entity?
So you can chef steps

2725
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:18.870
<v 2>on Twitter,
Facebook,
Youtube,
chef steps.com.
Of course.</v>

2726
02:40:18.900 --> 02:40:23.850
And there's an APP and there's probably a bunch of social channels like

2727
02:40:23.851 --> 02:40:27.630
Instagram and others that I don't even know about yet.
Perfect.

2728
02:40:28.230 --> 02:40:31.650
Well cause it's always fun to hang and a,

2729
02:40:31.651 --> 02:40:36.600
we will have more adult beverages in Seattle and elsewhere soon.
I am sure.

2730
02:40:37.170 --> 02:40:39.270
But I appreciate you taking the time.
Thanks Tim.

2731
02:40:39.510 --> 02:40:41.910
It was fun and for everybody listening,

2732
02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:44.970
you can get links to everything that we talked about,

2733
02:40:44.971 --> 02:40:48.350
all the goodies in the show notes at four hour work,

2734
02:40:48.351 --> 02:40:52.770
week.com forward slash podcast as well as all the past episodes.

2735
02:40:52.771 --> 02:40:54.450
If you want to hear my chat,

2736
02:40:54.451 --> 02:40:57.420
which involves some Tequila with Matt Mullenweg for instance,

2737
02:40:57.421 --> 02:41:01.620
then you can find that episode there as well.
And until next time,

2738
02:41:02.010 --> 02:41:03.900
as always,
thank you for listening.

2739
02:41:06.820 --> 02:41:10.210
<v 4>Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

2740
02:41:10.540 --> 02:41:13.210
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

2741
02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:16.480
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2742
02:41:16.481 --> 02:41:20.620
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

2743
02:41:20.621 --> 02:41:24.160
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

2744
02:41:24.161 --> 02:41:28.510
short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

2745
02:41:28.511 --> 02:41:29.830
pondering over the week.

2746
02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:32.800
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

2747
02:41:32.801 --> 02:41:36.250
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2748
02:41:36.251 --> 02:41:40.570
somehow dug up in the,
uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

2749
02:41:40.870 --> 02:41:45.870
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

2750
02:41:46.540 --> 02:41:49.240
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

2751
02:41:49.300 --> 02:41:54.300
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

2752
02:41:54.370 --> 02:41:56.530
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

2753
02:41:56.800 --> 02:42:00.100
Just go to four hour workweek.com that's four hour work,

2754
02:42:00.101 --> 02:42:04.180
week.com all spelled out and just drop in your email and you will get the very

2755
02:42:04.181 --> 02:42:06.700
next one.
And if you sign up,
I hope you enjoyed,

2756
02:42:07.570 --> 02:42:11.620
this episode is brought to you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor.

2757
02:42:11.980 --> 02:42:16.390
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way,
set it and forget it.

2758
02:42:16.391 --> 02:42:20.740
Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous

2759
02:42:20.741 --> 02:42:21.490
investors.

2760
02:42:21.490 --> 02:42:25.210
It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than

2761
02:42:25.211 --> 02:42:28.210
two and a half billion dollars under management.
In fact,

2762
02:42:28.240 --> 02:42:29.590
some of my very good friends,

2763
02:42:29.620 --> 02:42:32.770
investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront.

2764
02:42:33.130 --> 02:42:35.830
So the question is why?
Why is it so popular?
Why is it unique?

2765
02:42:36.130 --> 02:42:39.670
Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy.

2766
02:42:39.670 --> 02:42:42.130
But only pay pennies on the dollar for them.

2767
02:42:42.610 --> 02:42:45.850
And this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations,

2768
02:42:45.851 --> 02:42:48.580
bloated sales teams,
et cetera.
And I'll come back to that in a second.

2769
02:42:49.090 --> 02:42:53.770
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk

2770
02:42:53.771 --> 02:42:54.491
assessment quiz,

2771
02:42:54.491 --> 02:42:58.390
which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for free exactly the

2772
02:42:58.391 --> 02:43:01.330
portfolio they'd put you in.
And if you just want to take their advice,

2773
02:43:01.570 --> 02:43:04.720
run with it,
do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

2774
02:43:04.721 --> 02:43:06.640
you can set it and forget it.
And here's why.

2775
02:43:06.940 --> 02:43:10.930
The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that

2776
02:43:11.560 --> 02:43:15.580
should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't great investing is a

2777
02:43:15.581 --> 02:43:17.020
marathon,
not a sprint,

2778
02:43:17.110 --> 02:43:19.360
and little things that you may or may not be familiar with.

2779
02:43:19.361 --> 02:43:22.810
Like automatic tax loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

2780
02:43:22.990 --> 02:43:27.340
cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large

2781
02:43:27.341 --> 02:43:31.060
amounts of money over longer periods of time.
Wealthfront,
as I mentioned,

2782
02:43:31.061 --> 02:43:33.670
since it's using software instead of retail locations,

2783
02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:37.840
etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely

2784
02:43:37.841 --> 02:43:39.340
impossible.
Right off the bat.

2785
02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:41.890
You never pay commissions or account fees for everything.

2786
02:43:41.891 --> 02:43:46.891
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for

2787
02:43:47.531 --> 02:43:51.220
free.
If you use my link,
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim,

2788
02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:56.350
that is less than $5 a month to invest a $30,000 account for instance.
Now,

2789
02:43:56.351 --> 02:43:57.970
normally when I have a sponsor on this show,

2790
02:43:57.971 --> 02:44:01.510
it's because I use them and recommend them.
In this case,
it's a little different.

2791
02:44:01.870 --> 02:44:05.830
I don't use wealth front yet because I'm not allowed to.
Here's the deal.

2792
02:44:06.040 --> 02:44:10.090
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of sec regulations,

2793
02:44:10.270 --> 02:44:13.750
companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials.

2794
02:44:13.751 --> 02:44:16.570
So I couldn't be a user and have them on the podcast,

2795
02:44:17.050 --> 02:44:20.680
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant

2796
02:44:20.681 --> 02:44:24.520
amount of my own money,
at least for me,
uh,
in the team and the company itself.

2797
02:44:24.550 --> 02:44:27.610
So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client.

2798
02:44:27.820 --> 02:44:31.180
Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

2799
02:44:31.270 --> 02:44:35.050
you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account,

2800
02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:38.010
but just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you.

2801
02:44:38.100 --> 02:44:42.220
Take two minutes,
fill out their questionnaire@wealthfront.com forward slash.
Tim.

2802
02:44:42.550 --> 02:44:45.370
It's fast,
it's free.
There's no downside that I can think of.

2803
02:44:45.640 --> 02:44:49.240
This episode is brought to you by audible,
which I've used for years.

2804
02:44:49.270 --> 02:44:53.140
I love audiobooks and I've two to recommend right off the bat.

2805
02:44:53.500 --> 02:44:57.130
Number one is perhaps my favorite audio book of all time and that is the

2806
02:44:57.131 --> 02:44:59.170
graveyard book by Neil Gaiman.

2807
02:44:59.260 --> 02:45:03.460
The only audiobook I've wanted to immediately listen to a second time.

2808
02:45:03.461 --> 02:45:07.840
As soon as I finished.
It's amazing.
You will thank me.
The graveyard book.

2809
02:45:07.870 --> 02:45:10.570
The second is vagabonding by Rolf Potts,
