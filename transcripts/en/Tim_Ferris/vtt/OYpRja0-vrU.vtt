Find out how you can work a lot less and enjoy life more.
Authored.

3
00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:15.730
Timothy Ferriss explains how to escape the nine to five grind and work just four

4
00:00:15.731 --> 00:00:16.600
hours a week.

5
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.110
<v 0>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.140
<v 1>Life doesn't have to be so hard.</v>

7
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.580
It really doesn't know.
If you had told me that three years ago,

8
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:33.090
I wouldn't have believed you,
but most people like pass off included.

9
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.740
I resigned themselves to nine to five grind and exchange for sometimes,

10
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.660
although increasingly less and less relaxing weekends and the occasional one

11
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:45.060
week,
certainly no more than two week vacation,

12
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.580
I came to realize that income really has no practical value without time.

13
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.410
Here are a few simple steps you can take to escape the rat race entirely,

14
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.670
not just when it,

15
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.520
one of the first steps is the process of elimination.

16
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.250
So to start,

17
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.480
you need to consider something called Pereda Islam more commonly known as the 80

18
00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:12.770
20 principle because in order to work less,
not have everything fall apart,

19
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.900
you'll have to quantify the 20% of activities that are producing 80% of your

20
00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:18.770
desired outcomes.

21
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.180
Also take that time to determine the 20% of activities and people who are

22
00:01:23.181 --> 00:01:27.890
consuming 80% of your time.
Use this principle for everything customers,

23
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.250
work tasks,
but also for personal chores,
even for friends.

24
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.190
The goal here is two fold.
Number one,

25
00:01:34.191 --> 00:01:37.820
to find your inefficiencies in order to eliminate them,
and then secondly,

26
00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:41.600
and this is just as important to find your strengths and those critical few

27
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.240
tasks so you can multiply your output.

28
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.750
Working every hour,

29
00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:51.710
every minute from nine to five with some type of fidget isn't the goal.

30
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.870
It's simply the structure most people use.

31
00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:57.200
It's actually a legacy from a time that's already been obsolescence

32
00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.840
in a knowledge economy.

33
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.530
The more important thing is to shift from presence to performance,

34
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.040
cut out the static,
all the principals to time and income out,

35
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:10.460
contributing back and focus on the critical few.

36
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.730
You'll find that very few things matter.

37
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.990
Another critical step and a real compliment to elimination is what I call the

38
00:02:19.361 --> 00:02:23.230
low inflammation diet or cultivating selective ignorance.

39
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.050
Keeping abreast of all the new developments in any field will consume all of

40
00:02:29.051 --> 00:02:31.570
your time.
It'll be all input and no output.

41
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.690
You can't possibly digest all that information.

42
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.870
So more effective approach is to try to catch up when need be as opposed to

43
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.470
keeping up at all times.

44
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.480
A big part of selective ignorance is learning to let things wait.
For example,

45
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.883
email.

46
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.980
So email is the single largest acceptable interruption in modern life and it's a

47
00:02:53.891 --> 00:02:57.250
very convenient way of simulating forward motion without accomplishing anything.

48
00:02:57.251 --> 00:02:58.840
It shouldn't be a workspace.
It's a,

49
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.280
and one of the easiest methods I've seen for controlling email and one that's

50
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:07.150
become quite popular in silicon valley is setting up a simple autoresponder,

51
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.160
much like a vacation auto response that says something like the following.
Dear,

52
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:15.850
all in an effort to actually get work done,
I'm testing a new email policy.

53
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.770
I'm checking and responding to email only twice a day at 11:00 AM and 4:00 PM

54
00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:23.500
Pacific Time or whatever your time zone happens to be.

55
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.430
If you need a response before one of these,
two times for anything urgent,

56
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.720
please call me on my cell phone.

57
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.050
Thanks for understanding this move to greater effectiveness and efficiency.

58
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.950
Whatever your name is,
this gives you the breathing room.

59
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.980
Finally to single task and focus on completing the mission critical tasks,

60
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.280
the critical few from start to finish without interruption.

61
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.280
The third important tool I'd like to mention in one of my personal favorites is

62
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.120
outsourcing live.
To get started though,

63
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.000
we first need to replace the very obsolete concept of annual income.

64
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.790
Does a very deceptive metric with hourly in jumps,

65
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.530
and people are generally extremely hesitant to delegate or outsource because

66
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:12.880
they feel they can do something free themselves.
This is very inaccurate,

67
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.280
so let's start with the very basic calculation of hourly time.
If you make,

68
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:20.140
let's say $50,000 per year,

69
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.670
cut off the last three Zeros lives just 50 and you divide that in half and you

70
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:27.100
get 25 cc,
make $25 an hour.

71
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:30.310
This is assuming you get two weeks off per year and you're working 40 hours per

72
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:31.144
week.

73
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.130
So let's just say on the very high end that you can hire a personal assistant at

74
00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:39.760
$30 per hour.
The handle,
one work day of eight hours,

75
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.390
so your cost per hours and $5 so his or her 30 minus your 25 that means $40 per

76
00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:50.080
full eight hour day of freedom.

77
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.520
This also means that you can take a three day weekend every week and it will

78
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:56.200
cost you $40 per week.

79
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.010
I hire virtual assistants around the world,

80
00:05:00.011 --> 00:05:05.011
which only takes a few hours to help me with just about everything from business

81
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:07.390
research to reading,
email,

82
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.170
cutting hundreds of email down to four or five that I actually have to deal with

83
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.610
to travel,
product development,
purchasing,
planning parties,

84
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.420
even online dating.
There are a lot of unorthodox and creative uses.

85
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.830
Personal outsourcing is only limited by your imagination and return on

86
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:25.180
investment is astounding.

87
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.890
400 500% even for someone who makes 30 $40,000 a year,

88
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.130
it's smart to focus on getting things done,

89
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.700
but it's only possible when you actually set your not to do list.

90
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.110
So once we remove the constant static and the distraction and focus on the

91
00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:43.810
critical few,
and they're really just aren't that many.

92
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.100
So I hope you enjoyed the book and just remember that outside of the law and

93
00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:51.850
science,
all the rules,
we follow our rules,
we set ourselves.

94
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.420
So set yourself up to win and choose your own roles.
