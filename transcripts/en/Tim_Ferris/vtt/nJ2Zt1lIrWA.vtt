1
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.150
Hey,
what's up guys?
This is Tim.

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.240
I've taken off that disgusting Muskrat on my face and I am drinking some wine.

3
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:13.480
This is day four of the Vlog if this even counts.
And uh,

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.340
I am drinking this delicious wine.
It's really nice.

5
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.510
This is a chocolate up.
He known who are from Patagonia.

6
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.840
I had not had an Argentine peanut who are before.

7
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.640
So another long day and night of writing.

8
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.500
It is almost midnight and a had a very full day of writing today.

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.960
I've been working on archery also specifically blank bail practice,

10
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:44.961
which is not like dry firing with a handgun or any gun for that matter.

11
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.920
Uh,
all right,
so let's see some questions.
Waffles or pancakes.

12
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:50.611
Waffles,

13
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:55.611
preferably with fried chicken on a cheat day and with some Bourbon in South

14
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.770
Carolina.
Uh,
what does my favorite color favorite color is?
Green.

15
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.480
All right.
Do I recommend a multivitamin?
No,
I don't take multivitamins.
Uh,

16
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.470
I think that they generally include things I don't want to take like iron.

17
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.630
All right.
Uh,
Matthew,
what am I writing?

18
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:20.130
I'm writing a new book,
which is related to all of the best lessons,
tools,

19
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:23.070
and tricks that I've learned from all of the podcast guests,

20
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:25.350
both in the podcast and outside of the podcast.

21
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.660
A right morning supplements to take on a settlement on empty stomach.

22
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.460
Uh,
I take [inaudible],
I take,
uh,

23
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.060
let's see here.
What else do I take?
Msm.

24
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.690
I take fish oil or Krill oil,

25
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.640
a whole handful of things.
I mean,
literally a handful of things.
All right,

26
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.590
10,000 steps per day.
My take on this,
I don't think it's necessary.

27
00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:55.500
It depends on what you want to do.
For some people that's very motivating,

28
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:58.560
but I'm happy to just do kettlebell swings three times a week and watch my diet

29
00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:03.390
a little bit.
And,
uh,
sorry,

30
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:06.870
I'm seeing multiple questions at once and trying a monkey mind.

31
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:09.000
Have you ever started monkey mind to find you had nothing?

32
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:13.170
I have no idea what that means.
Which brand of bone?
I'm using a PSE,

33
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.800
carbon air,
carbon,
air,
air.
Um,

34
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.510
very expensive.
I also would like to use recurve,

35
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:25.160
but for my purposes right now,
I need a compound,
uh,

36
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.430
isle au Haut it whole life insurance,

37
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.760
not educated enough.
I don't have any thoughts.
Do you have any tattoos?
No,

38
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:33.990
I don't.
Why or why not?

39
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.740
Haven't found anything I want to permanently put in my body at this point.

40
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.060
I'm not averse to it.
I actually think,
uh,
for instance on women,

41
00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:46.510
tattoos can sometimes be super hot,
but um,
yeah,
so I'm fine.

42
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.580
Anything I want to put on my body permanently,
Molly is doing much better.

43
00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:52.800
Thank you for asking.
There she is.

44
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.310
I took off the cone of shame and I have a bit of a kind of sort of soc impromptu

45
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.950
macgyver thing that I've done in her foot,
which is working just fine.
Uh,

46
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.270
can I do have log with Seth,
which Seth are we talking about?

47
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:10.960
Seth Rogen a favorite place in South America to visit.
You know,

48
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:14.560
Patagonia is very high on the list.
I would say Columbia is great.

49
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.600
Chili's great for skiing.
Um,
how'd I get into archery?

50
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:21.220
I have always been interested in it,

51
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:25.960
but I'm going on my first elk hunt in Colorado in about six weeks,

52
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.770
so I need to get as good as possible between now and then.

53
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.100
And uh,

54
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.580
for those people who get all up in arms about hunting as I was for decades,

55
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.510
read the four hour chef.
Uh,
and uh,
that'll make more sense.

56
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.360
All right.
What's the deal with Poo air?

57
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:48.361
It's a great black tea that helps with fat loss and alertness.

58
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.700
So I use that in the mornings almost all the time.

59
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:55.150
Safest Way to lose 20 pounds fast is to read my article,

60
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.800
how to lose 20 pounds in one month.

61
00:03:56.801 --> 00:04:01.090
That any exercise that's like exactly how to do it and it's free,

62
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.130
uh,
are right.
Uh,

63
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.780
as we learn a new language in short time,

64
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:10.210
just search language learning and Tim Ferriss honestly,

65
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.190
and you'll find a shit ton of articles.
Uh,
all right.

66
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.660
What's the wine?
I'll show you guys again.
It's really nice.

67
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:22.750
I'm very happy with this Chakra.

68
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.550
Peanut Anwar 2011 from a [inaudible] you those,

69
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.000
so 32,
whatever that means.
Patagonia,
Argentina

70
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.620
hadn't ever had peanut from Argentina.
That's very nice.

71
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.800
All right.
Uh,
did I get a refresher from Raul from Paris?

72
00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:45.400
I did.
I did deed.
And we're also so good dude.
That's Ralph pots,

73
00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:49.360
the author of vagabonding who has a writing workshop in Paris every July.

74
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.530
Uh,
should I get into meditating or working out first,
uh,

75
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.550
working out a right stranded island?

76
00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:01.990
One book,
which one?

77
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.310
Probably the more letters to Luca alias.

78
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.100
She can find as a letters from a stoic or Zorba the Greek,

79
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.670
I dunno,
those are the first two that come to mind.
Uh,

80
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.960
BPC one 57.
Yes,
I have had experience,
interesting stuff.

81
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.790
Um,
but I've not seen a persistence of effects,

82
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.970
so seem to be massively effective and uh,

83
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.730
the issues have returned shortly thereafter,
so I'm not sure how to evaluate it.

84
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.160
Uh,
starting a podcast.
Any advice?
Yes.
Uh,

85
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.190
look up how I built a number one podcast in my name and you'll find it,

86
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.720
uh,
probably like 10,000 words on exactly what I recommend.
A UNC,

87
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.130
Yay.
Tokyo Osaka activity recommendations going next week.

88
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.140
Check out a blog post.
This is what I have to do on this kind of format.
Guys,
uh,

89
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.150
called how to cock Tokyo for less than New York City,

90
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.710
something like that.
And,
uh,

91
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.650
all sorts of good stuff in there.

92
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.330
All right.

93
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.040
I am going to answer a couple of more questions that I'm going to get out of

94
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:18.110
here.
Uh,

95
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.490
where would I do a bachelor party somewhere in the woods in the Pacific

96
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:25.490
northwest?
Probably.
Uh,

97
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.760
I want to sell everything and walk across America says Brandon,
then,
uh,

98
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.920
maybe you should do that.
Sounds like a great adventure.
Uh,

99
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.890
alright.
Beatles or the stones.
Beatles.

100
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.920
<v 1>Uh,</v>

101
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.430
<v 0>what do I think about clenn and BNP?
Okay.
So for people who know,</v>

102
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.320
I think Clenbuterol you can,
uh,
really,
um,

103
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.900
Bernet your system easily with that DMP.
You can kill yourself.

104
00:06:54.901 --> 00:06:58.650
So I have no interest in it.
Very dangerous stuff.

105
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.130
Oh,
Rad.
Add draft a draft.

106
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.090
[inaudible] had a couple of questions about this.
Yeah,
I've never used it.

107
00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:07.050
Don't have any thoughts on him.

108
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.050
Whatever we would I rather be blind or deaf.
Deaf.
Uh,

109
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:19.170
best tip for staying injury proof from training is do gymnastic strength

110
00:07:19.171 --> 00:07:21.270
training and mobility work.

111
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.890
It seems to really bulletproof on most of your body.

112
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.010
Uh Oh right.
Um,

113
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.370
ah,
calligraphy thought so loved calligraphy.

114
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.910
My grandfather was a calligrapher and I did a clariphy in Japan,

115
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.030
in Japanese for a long time.
I love calligraphy.

116
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.240
I think it's a great way of developing the mind body connection with fine motor

117
00:07:47.821 --> 00:07:48.654
control.

118
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.633
<v 1>Okay.</v>

119
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:56.170
<v 0>DMT question mark.
We need a more detailed map,
but yeah.</v>

120
00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:00.610
Dimethyltryptamine interesting stuff.
Not for kids.

121
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:03.463
Uh,

122
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:11.080
any chance of for our investor book?
Probably not because it's so personalized.

123
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.250
I think Tony Robbins book,
uh,
what is it?
Money.
The game.

124
00:08:15.251 --> 00:08:19.600
Something like that is,
is actually a very good one to pick up.

125
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.830
It's so highly individualized.
It's,

126
00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:24.700
it's hard to write a book for the general public on investing.

127
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:30.490
Uh,
have I ever done meditation retreat?
Yes,

128
00:08:30.491 --> 00:08:31.420
I have for three days.

129
00:08:31.421 --> 00:08:35.830
I'm doing a 10 day silent retreat in the not too distant future.

130
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.953
<v 1>All right.</v>

131
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.730
<v 0>Hello?
From Brazil one nudge.</v>

132
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.790
It must be a,
actually,

133
00:08:44.791 --> 00:08:49.410
I guess it's about the same time as it is here about midnight.
So I've goodnight,

134
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.180
<v 1>uh,</v>

135
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:57.410
<v 0>if I had 200 pounds to lose,
where would I start?
David?
I would,</v>

136
00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.620
uh,
look up how to lose a hundred pounds on the slow carb diet,

137
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.270
which has a couple of real examples of people who have lost 140,
150 yet,

138
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.600
and I've met people who've lost 200 pounds.
So that's where I would start.

139
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.960
Where should I go eat dinner in SF right now?
Brooke,

140
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.290
you should go to central kitchen,
uh,

141
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.250
where you could go if you want to be really fancy,
go to [inaudible].

142
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.820
That's expensive.
You may not get a table.

143
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.280
Do I still hang out with Neil?
Yes they do.
If we're talking about Neil Strauss,

144
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:30.840
uh,
one possible,
he's got a new kid,
so he's a busy,
busy,
busy man.

145
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.170
Uh,
how,
Yay.

146
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.980
<v 1>Okay.</v>

147
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.190
<v 0>I want to quit the job I hate and do something else but scared that if I feel it</v>

148
00:09:39.191 --> 00:09:43.030
will push me further back.
Any advice in 27 years old?
Yes.

149
00:09:43.031 --> 00:09:45.850
Get the four hour workweek.
Buy It on kindle.
It's like nine bucks,

150
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.200
maybe less and read.
I think it's chapter two.
Fear setting.

151
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.600
That is what you need to do.
All right.

152
00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.120
Uh,

153
00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.990
bear with me.
Bear with me.

154
00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:08.410
What am I most grateful for my life right now?

155
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:13.530
Right now it's a chance to talk to you guys and the incredibly comfortable bed

156
00:10:13.811 --> 00:10:16.750
that is waiting for me and my pooch.

157
00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.760
After I send off an email and finish my boss one.

158
00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.960
So on that point I'm gonna let you guys go,
but um,

159
00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.020

160
00:10:29.021 --> 00:10:32.500

161
00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:37.360
So thanks for hanging out guys.
Hope you enjoy and I'll talk to you soon.
