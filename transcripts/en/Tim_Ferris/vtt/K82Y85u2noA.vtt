00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.250
Marcella was one of the most,

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.420
well he's the most kinesthetically overdeveloped person they ever met.

3
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.110
And of course over development under development tend to come hand in hand

4
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.830
conceptually,
um,

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.980
of overdevelopment own development

6
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.263
<v 1>to</v>

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.800
<v 0>his physical intelligence is mind boggling.
You know,</v>

8
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.040
you throw him on a standup paddleboard in three foot shop and everyone just

9
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:31.680
flies off of paddle boards when they should just stand up on them.

10
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:34.640
And he's just beautiful.
I'm just,
you just find the balance points,

11
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.490
but I've ever seen one soon someone learn so quickly how to handle um,

12
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.190
waves,
boats and fishing lines being,
you know,

13
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.240
free diving,
being on riding waves on paddle boards.
You know,
when you,

14
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.300
when you're in the marsh.
I've been a stand up fighter for many years.

15
00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:53.610
I mean throwing is my core,
my core art.

16
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:55.680
When I'm doing standup training with Marcel,

17
00:00:55.681 --> 00:01:00.300
I caught him with most of the throws and my repertoire one time.

18
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.790
I don't think I've ever caught him with a throw twice.

19
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.803
<v 1>Wow.</v>

20
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.090
<v 0>And as we're world class,
while I was training with,
you know,</v>

21
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.480
catch them thousands of times.
So this is a guy,
he,
he just,

22
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.500
you almost never see Marcello get caught more than once with something.

23
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.023
Um,

24
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.440
and it's amazing to see how he relates to the world through is kinesthetic

25
00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:22.900
intelligence.
So for example,
if you're looking,

26
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.830
when we were looking for spaces for our school,

27
00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:28.460
we'd walk into a big room and I did thinking about the dimensions,
you know,

28
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.380
square footage where this would be,

29
00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:33.080
where that will be more so it would know if it felt good or felt bad.

30
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.251
If he meets you,

31
00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:37.700
he's going to know whether he feels good about you or he feels bad about you and

32
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.220
his intuition is incredibly dead on.
But he,

33
00:01:40.221 --> 00:01:42.530
he navigates the world through this Kevin Static intelligence.

34
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.430
And it's been a really fascinating having a school with him and diving deep with

35
00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:47.360
them.
Um,

36
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.780
because we've been having conceptual dialogue these three and a half years or
so,

37
00:01:50.781 --> 00:01:53.210
and he's really deepened conceptually.

38
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.360
But I've learned even more deeply in the importance of the lesson that there are

39
00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:03.110
many paths to greatness and to take a guy like Marcello and to try to fit him

40
00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:05.630
into a chess players.
You know,

41
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.490
hyper conceptual mold would be terrible because you'd be killing this shine.

42
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.120
And he is so great because of his just unbelievable commitment to doing it his

43
00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:19.460
way.
And he's done things in extraordinary ways.
I mean,
for example,

44
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.990
you know how in these competitive arts,

45
00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:23.890
everyone's very secretive about the repertoires.
Um,
well,

46
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.100
we have this program which you know well called mg inaction,

47
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.680
where people just two guys from around the world log in to watch all of our

48
00:02:30.681 --> 00:02:34.490
souls training sessions.
His sparring sessions is lessons.
Everything.

49
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.580
When he was competing in Abu Dhabi submission grappling world championship,

50
00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:39.860
and when jaws,
which is the Brazilian Jujitsu world championships,

51
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.300
we were spoiled.
We were streaming is sparring sessions every night.

52
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.900
So he was basically showing these competitors what he was about to say,

53
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.640
<v 1>two weeks in,
three weeks,
four weeks.</v>

54
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.290
<v 0>That's,
that's it about this,
which is completely unique,</v>

55
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.920
is if you're studying my game,
you're entering my game and I'll be better at.
