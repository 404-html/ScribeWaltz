1
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.590
I wanted to start with talking about modeling and,

2
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.660
uh,
there are lots of beautiful people on the,

3
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.650
on this planet and there are many people who go into modeling and they're very,

4
00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:23.980
very few who get to where you are.

5
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.260
And it strikes me that there are some,
it would seem success cases of,

6
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.250
uh,
in this case,

7
00:00:30.251 --> 00:00:34.570
women who have gone off to build incredible businesses like Kathy Ireland.

8
00:00:34.571 --> 00:00:35.870
And there are others.
So,

9
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.760
wanted to start with asking you if you had,

10
00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:42.160
when you were getting started or even now,

11
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.320
any role models among women who,
or men who have,

12
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.750
have gone from modeling to do other things.

13
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.010
<v 2>I mean,
you,
you certainly mentioned one,
Kathy Ireland.
Um,</v>

14
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.730
there's a long list,
you know,
Cindy Crawford,
Christy Turlington,

15
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.980
just allow many women who are in the industry and have used their platform or

16
00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:07.370
voice or,
or experiences,
uh,

17
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.680
to build businesses or to make meaningful impact in the world in whatever way

18
00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:16.580
they're passionate about.
And like for me,
that is,
that is success.
And,

19
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.240
and I,
I dunno,
yeah,

20
00:01:19.241 --> 00:01:23.410
I did not anticipate working in fashion or being a model,

21
00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:27.250
but I recognize somewhere along the line that there's so much more you can do

22
00:01:27.251 --> 00:01:31.450
with it.
And the women who have come before me,
uh,
certainly have proved that

23
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:32.300
<v 1>it's,</v>

24
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.960
it seems like from the outside looking in that much like say entertainment,

25
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.883
uh,

26
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.570
the machinery of fashion and beauty and so on probably has a lot of casualties.

27
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:49.430
Meaning it just chews up and spits out a lot of people.
There's really high,

28
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.250
it would seem to be turnover.
A lot of turnover.
Yeah.

29
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.900
What were some of the key decisions that you and,

30
00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:02.901
or your family or people like managers made that helped you to navigate,

31
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.130
to avoid some of the most common pitfalls?

32
00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:08.220
Maybe you could just start with like what are some of the most common mistakes

33
00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:09.054
and pitfalls?

34
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.100
<v 2>Sure.
I mean,
honestly,
Tim,</v>

35
00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:15.780
I feel like I'm living my own version of a Cinderella story or an American
dream.

36
00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:16.170
I mean,

37
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.170
I have been able to travel the world and have been able to learn from the most

38
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:24.990
extraordinary people.
I'm sitting here with you talking,
I mean,
this is,

39
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.310
I feel like I'm,
I'm living a dream every day and,
and you know,

40
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.200
I certainly did not anticipate going into fashion or being a model.
I,

41
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.630
I had a very different kind of career path in mind and I had this opportunity

42
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:41.780
and I,
and I took it.
Yeah,

43
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.710
<v 1>that was the,
what was the opportunity?
So I was,</v>

44
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.600
so you grew up in the Midwest?

45
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.200
<v 2>I grew up in the Midwest and my father's a doctor.</v>

46
00:02:50.201 --> 00:02:51.850
He's an emergency room physician,

47
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.690
one of the most hardworking people you'll ever meet.
And so selfless.

48
00:02:55.691 --> 00:02:58.990
And I have three sisters and my mom's an artist,

49
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.110
so I just like grew up in this amazing Midwestern picturesque kind of childhood.

50
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:11.071
And at 13 I was stopped in a mall and asked if I would be interested in walking

51
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:13.990
in a fashion show at the time.

52
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:18.430
Not only did I not care about,
uh,
it was,

53
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.970
it just wasn't my life.
Fashion.
I mean,
I didn't even subscribe to magazines.
I,

54
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.390
I was focusing on school.
I was focusing on ballet,

55
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:28.930
academics and sports and,
and so anyway,

56
00:03:28.931 --> 00:03:33.430
this idea of modeling was like totally not even in my,
in my,

57
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.360
um,
in my mind.
And so I didn't,

58
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.220
I didn't enter this,
uh,

59
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.880
with the ambition of building a career in modeling.

60
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.920
I was stopped in a mall at 13,

61
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.950
walked in a local charity fashion show to raise money for a local family who's

62
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.740
my friend's father.
Her had,
her dad had cancer.
So it was this charity benefit.

63
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.150
And I was,
I was,

64
00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.130
there were scouts there from real agencies and they took my name and said,

65
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:02.470
let's stay in touch.
I grew a couple inches.

66
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.590
Fast forward to when I'm 15 and I 15.

67
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.100
Oh my God,
Tim.
I was 15 years old and five 11.

68
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.260
It's painful being,
look,

69
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.920
I believe in you.
I've really been,
you know.
Um,
and so anyway,
he said,

70
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.570
I was 15 years old and I got this opportunity to go to New York for the weekend

71
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.680
and,
uh,
meet the designers of cast of Calvin Klein.

72
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.630
And,

73
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.410
and they booked me and I walked in their fashion show and it completely kind of

74
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.220
put me on the map as a new up and coming model.

75
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.860
And I,
and it just was,

76
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.080
it's been a wild ride ever since.
Ever since that,

77
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.790
that day in the mall when I was,
um,
stopped.
