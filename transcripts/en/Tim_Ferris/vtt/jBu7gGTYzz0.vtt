Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:06.000
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.530
I'm a cybernetic organism.

4
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.880
<v 1>Zip Code is brought to you by me undies.
If I'm not going commando,</v>

5
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:28.160
I'm in Biondi is,

6
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.220
I have been testing these underwear for three to four months now pretty much

7
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:37.221
every day and in fact throughout bunch of my other underwear this morning and on

8
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:42.360
the road in the house,
they are extremely comfortable.
They look good,
feel good.

9
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.310
They are made of micro modal,

10
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.090
two times softer than cotton as scientifically tested using the call method.

11
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.130
Sounds very fancy of course,

12
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.030
and I get a lot of compliments from ladies for these.
You don't get diaper butt,

13
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.950
you don't get the tired elastic band.

14
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.900
They look great and they have underwear for both men and women.

15
00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:04.610
Check out [inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim and you can see everything that

16
00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:07.770
I've been wearing.
They're ridiculous to the sublime.
Everything in between,

17
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.380
including my favorite,
which is called out.

18
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.890
And I would be remiss if I didn't mention their lounge pants.

19
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.640
This is a new thing and I've been wearing their lounge pants when I record

20
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:18.450
podcast.

21
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.720
I've been wearing them out and about when I'm walking the dog meeting people for

22
00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:25.560
coffee and they are extremely comfortable though.

23
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.540
They're made from the same material as the underwear,

24
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.490
but some of them like the blue ones,

25
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:34.491
I have have pockets so you can walk about without seeming like you're off of

26
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:38.340
your meds and completely crazy.
So that is awesome.

27
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.920
And if you're not happy with the first pair you try on,

28
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:42.270
I assume that the first of the underwear,

29
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.090
they'll refund you completely and you can keep the pair you tried on for free.

30
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.320
But if you're that kind of person,

31
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.990
you should be ashamed because that's disgusting.
Uh,

32
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.960
Mandy's dot com four slash Tim,
check it out.

33
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.620
This episode is brought to you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor.

34
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.390
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way.
Set it and forget it.

35
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:07.740
Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous

36
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:08.490
investors.

37
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.210
It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than

38
00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:15.240
two and a half billion dollars under management.
In fact,

39
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.590
some of my very good friends,

40
00:02:16.591 --> 00:02:19.800
investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront.

41
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.860
So the question is why?
Why is it so popular?
Why is it unique?

42
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.150
Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

43
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:29.130
pay pennies on the dollar for them.

44
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.850
And this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations,

45
00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:35.610
bloated sales teams,
et cetera.
And I'll come back to that in a second.

46
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.770
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk

47
00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:41.491
assessment quiz,

48
00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:45.420
which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for free exactly the

49
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:48.360
portfolio they'd put you in.
And if you just want to take their advice,

50
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.750
run with it,
do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

51
00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:53.640
you can set it and forget it.
And here's why.

52
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.930
The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that

53
00:02:57.931 --> 00:03:01.330
investors should using on a regular basis but normally aren't.

54
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.030
Great investing is a marathon,
not a sprint,

55
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.720
and little things that you may or may not be familiar with like automatic tax

56
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:09.850
loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

57
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.320
cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large

58
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:18.040
amounts of money over longer periods of time.
Wealthfront,
as I mentioned,

59
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:20.650
since it's using software instead of retail locations,

60
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:24.850
etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely

61
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:26.350
impossible right off the bat,

62
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.870
you never pay commissions or account fees for everything.

63
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:33.871
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for

64
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:36.550
free.
If you use my link,

65
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.930
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim that is less than $5 a month to invest a

66
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:43.360
$30,000 account,
for instance.
Now,

67
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:46.900
normally when I have a sponsor on this show is because I use them and recommend

68
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:48.520
them.
In this case,
it's a little different.

69
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.840
I don't use Wealthfront yet because I'm not allowed to.
Here's the deal,

70
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.100
they wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of sec regulations,

71
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.760
companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials.

72
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:03.580
So I couldn't be a user end have them on the podcast,

73
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.690
but I've been so impressed by wealth front that I've invested a significant

74
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:11.530
amount of my own money,
at least for me,
uh,
in the team and the company itself.

75
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.680
So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client.

76
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.160
Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

77
00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:22.060
you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account,

78
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.090
but just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you.

There's no downside that I can think of.

81
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.910

82
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.210

85
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:48.550
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

86
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:49.121
each episode,

87
00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:53.860
it is my job to deconstruct world class performers from many different worlds,

88
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:58.660
whether they come from military entertainment,
sports or otherwise,

89
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.840
to dissect and to collect the patterns for you that you can use to tease out the

90
00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:07.180
routines,
habits,
thought processes,
et Cetera,

91
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:09.910
that you can apply immediately in test in your own life.

92
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.550
And this episode is a really fun one.

93
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.520
Ever since episode two of the podcast,

94
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:20.521
we're probably around 140 or 150 now you've been asking for around two a follow

95
00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:23.650
up with Josh Waitzkin and this is it.

96
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.670
Josh Waitzkin was the basis for the book and movie searching for Bobby Fischer.

97
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.800
He is considered a chess prodigy,

98
00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:34.120
although we'll discuss why that term doesn't necessarily apply to him because he

99
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:38.170
has perfected learning strategies that can be applied to anything including his

100
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:39.730
loves of Brazilian Jujitsu.

101
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.650
He's a black belt under the fee nom nine time world champion Marcella Garcia or

102
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:47.470
Tai Chi,
push hands.
He's a world champion these days.

103
00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:51.240
He spends his time coaching the world's top performers,
whether mark,
Messier,

104
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.821
cal Ripken,

105
00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:56.821
jr or investors whose names you'd recognize or whose assets under management

106
00:05:57.411 --> 00:06:00.710
would blow your mind.
And,
uh,
it's context.

107
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:03.800
I initially met Josh through his incredible book,
the art of learning,

108
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:06.200
which I love so much that I helped produce the audio book.

109
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.330
You can find that as part of my book club,

110
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.980
audible.com forward slash Tim's books in this episode is deep.

111
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:17.660
Josh has always deep and he walks the talk in the best way possible.

112
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:18.800
I hope it will blow your mind.

113
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:23.270
We talk about flow achieving flow states near death experiences,

114
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.100
use of slack,
line training,
elite performers,
cultivating sensitivity.

115
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.160
And I don't mean that in the,
the,
uh,

116
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.390
the most woo way imaginable,
rather the most practical way imaginable,

117
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.470
using heart rate variability training,
high intensity interval training,

118
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:42.080
breath awareness,
et Cetera,
uh,

119
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.510
intuition and its applications to investing.

120
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.150
And it just goes on and on and on.

121
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.510
So please enjoy my conversation with Josh Waitzkin.

122
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:58.340
Joshua.
Yes,
Timbo.
Welcome back buddy.
I'm so happy to be here.

123
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.800
I'm thrilled you're here,
man.
Hang in with you.

124
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.420
And I thought we could maybe start just with a complete non sequitur,

125
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:08.000
which is a book you just mentioned to me that I know nothing about,

126
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.710
which is dreaming yourself awake.

127
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.200
<v 2>Can you talk about this?
Oh,
he's in the,
we're going to begin here.</v>

128
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.180
It's a book that I explored a couple of years ago.
Uh,

129
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.760
20 years ago I started studying Tibetan Dream Yoga and lucid dreaming,

130
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.940
not deeply,
but exploring.
Um,

131
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.630
and this was during the period where I was first getting involved with my study

132
00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:30.880
of East Asian philosophy.
Um,

133
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.080
and then a dear friend of mine recommended this book.
Um,

134
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.270
it's actually funny because it was a,
it was a,

135
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.370
we kind of made a mistake together.

136
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:42.070
I recommended another book that he texted back confirming that it was the name.

137
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.540
He texts me back that name that I didn't intend,

138
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.670
but then I picked up and read and it was extraordinary.

139
00:07:48.671 --> 00:07:51.220
It's just a phenomenal discussion.
Um,

140
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.500
very systematic discussion of the art of lucid dreaming,
um,

141
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:58.660
in this way that fuses East Asian,
um,

142
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.880
philosophy with western science.

143
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.290
When you were competing then at the time or were you not compete?
You were,

144
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.980
you were in the midst of competition two years ago you mean?
Oh,
oh,

145
00:08:08.981 --> 00:08:11.410
this was two years ago.
20 years ago.

146
00:08:11.411 --> 00:08:14.530
20 years ago was when I started studying he station.
Yeah,
philosophy.

147
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.410
I got it and I was competing in chess then.
And then the martial arts.

148
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.590
I need a little more caffeine.
You've had a rough night

149
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.050
<v 1>and I want to thank you.
I'm just,</v>

150
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.920
this is like 10 stream of consciousness podcast intro,
the,

151
00:08:27.921 --> 00:08:32.730
we're looking at a slack line.
This is an indoor gibbon.
Classic.
Slack is,

152
00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:36.590
it's about 12.
Uh,
no,
not even 10 feet long.
Maybe.

153
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.530
We have it surrounded by kettlebells.

154
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.650
Endo Board and they trust Sarah tops,

155
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:47.870
which I don't think is yours.
Got the Bosu ball there and the Bosu ball and that.

156
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.860
I wanted to thank you for actually getting me to bite the bullet and grab a

157
00:08:51.861 --> 00:08:55.070
slackline,
which I set up on long island.
Yeah,
absolutely.
I've loved,

158
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.120
I've had some fun on,

159
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:59.360
<v 2>on your slack line on long island too.
I love all right now I'm,</v>

160
00:08:59.361 --> 00:09:00.450
I'm in the period,

161
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.170
I kind of oscillate between these and my son Jack was four and a half.

162
00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:06.600
We have a great time.
I'm on the Endo Board,
rock [inaudible].

163
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.180
He's on the Bosu Ball.
We're having a catch back and forth while on these things.

164
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:14.181
We're always integrating these interesting kinds of physiological awareness

165
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:17.010
training.
Speaking of which,

166
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:22.060
I feel like maybe we should throw a cautionary tale into this followup podcasts.

167
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.420
So we obviously trade stories and findings all the time.

168
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.480
Would you like to talk about your recent experience with Wim Hoff and breathing

169
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:39.480
training?
Wow.
Yeah.
Well I had an extremely scary experience.
Um,

170
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.260
so I'm a lifetime meditator and kind of

171
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:48.840
experimental subject like yourself around all these things.
Uh,
when you,

172
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.380
you tend to have better self preservation instinct into all the way that a lot

173
00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:57.320
of close calls in life.
Well,
I had,
uh,
I,
when I heard you speak to,
um,

174
00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.313
whim,

175
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.490
I was extremely intrigued actually when I heard someone mentioned him to you on

176
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:05.130
your podcast and then we spoke about it.
Then you spoke to him.

177
00:10:05.131 --> 00:10:09.030
I thought he sounded like a fascinating guy.
I started digging into his work.
I,

178
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:13.110
um,
so powerful and I started doing,

179
00:10:13.111 --> 00:10:15.810
he's going through his course is online course.
I loved it.

180
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.280
I mean the energetic feeling.
Um,
the electric surging through the body.
Uh,

181
00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:22.710
I'm also a lifetime free diver since I was four or five years old.

182
00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:25.890
I've been free diving and so breath hold,
just put that in perspective.

183
00:10:25.891 --> 00:10:29.250
And you spend about a month,
a year,
yeah.
In the water.
Used to be,

184
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.750
it used to be three months when I was younger.
Um,
now it's about,
well yeah,

185
00:10:33.751 --> 00:10:36.150
free dive dive in usually about a month of the year,

186
00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:39.960
but I spent a lot of time now as we know,
you know,
Surfing Santa Paddle surfing,

187
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.990
swimming,
diving.
I mean the ocean's a huge part of my life.

188
00:10:42.991 --> 00:10:45.150
We got to talk about our standup paddle adventure skill levels are pretty

189
00:10:45.151 --> 00:10:45.661
hilarious.

190
00:10:45.661 --> 00:10:48.780
Definitely come to that demo and I have been having some fun with that.
Um,

191
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:53.730
but I started playing with the Wim Hoff method and I thought it was incredibly

192
00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:54.840
powerful.
The,

193
00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:59.340
the intensity that you're experiencing internally.

194
00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:04.080
It's very similar to training and touchy,
Touchy Twan moving meditation for 10,

195
00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:04.471
15,

196
00:11:04.471 --> 00:11:08.910
20 years and then being an hour long into a session and you have this feeling of

197
00:11:08.911 --> 00:11:12.310
energetic flow inside your body with the Wim Hoff,
you'd do,
you know,

198
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.460
a few rounds of his breath method and you're experiencing these things.

199
00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:17.010
And it was incredible that the gain and strength were mind boggling.

200
00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:20.010
The length of the breath holds were fascinating.
Um,

201
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.760
but then I made a big technical error.
I ignored all the signs,
um,

202
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.280
on women's site and that you spoke about,
don't do not do this in water,

203
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:32.390
which is they were all over the place.
But I thought,
you know,

204
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.260
free diving is a way of life for me.
No problem.

205
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.840
And the major technical error was not realizing,

206
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.210
which is absurd after a lifetime of free diving,

207
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.060
that it's carbon dioxide built up that gives you the urge to breathe and not

208
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.780
oxygen deprivation.
Um,
hugely important thing.

209
00:11:45.781 --> 00:11:48.810
Please everyone burn that in its CEO to build up that makes you want to breathe.

210
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:54.190
And so I did the after a long swim at the Nyu pool if he wants to go.

211
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.730
<v 3>I started doing,
um,
I when breathing and did a series of underwater swims.</v>

212
00:11:57.731 --> 00:12:02.731
I did about eight 25 meter swims and I think I was on my fourth 50 and I

213
00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:04.870
underwater and I um,

214
00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:09.430
this was after a long workout and I went from this ecstatic state to

215
00:12:09.431 --> 00:12:12.610
unconsciousness and I was actually on the bottom of the pool after blacking out

216
00:12:12.611 --> 00:12:15.910
from shallow water blackout for three minutes before someone pulled me out.

217
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:21.430
And you know,
the doctors had told me,
usually it's 40 seconds to a minute to um,

218
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.160
perhaps permanent brain damage,
death.

219
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.430
I got very lucky my body saved my life and they said that if I hadn't been off

220
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.050
all the training I've done for so many years,

221
00:12:29.051 --> 00:12:32.020
I would have been gone in more specifically.

222
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:36.970
You correct me if I'm wrong,
you didn't in,
this strikes me as so odd.

223
00:12:36.971 --> 00:12:41.710
You didn't have the reflexive inhalation of water,

224
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.680
is that right?
Yeah,
I didn't take it and take any water into my lungs,

225
00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:48.760
which is hugely fortunate because fresh water in the lungs can be,

226
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.920
can be terrible.
Um,

227
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.950
so my lungs had no water in it pretty much after they pulled me out,

228
00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:55.390
I was unconscious for 25 minutes.

229
00:12:55.391 --> 00:12:58.990
I have started reading on my own though when it came to 25 minutes later and I

230
00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:00.940
was blue everywhere else.
My body sent all my,

231
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:05.040
all the blood to my brain and my heart saved my life and I'm here.
Um,

232
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:08.440
and it's been,
it was a life changer and a lot of levels,
you know,

233
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:11.680
the idea of my four year old boy,
four blocks away,

234
00:13:11.681 --> 00:13:15.040
sitting on the rug waiting for daddy to come home and me on unconscious in the

235
00:13:15.041 --> 00:13:19.780
bottom of a pool blue.
Just that's the kind of experience that I'm shattering.

236
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.330
How did that change how you think about training in these types of experiments

237
00:13:25.331 --> 00:13:29.980
or life in general?
I know it's a very broad question,
but I,
I've been,
I've been,

238
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.750
how does it change your decision making?
Because,
yeah.
Well,
first of all,

239
00:13:34.751 --> 00:13:37.390
how it's influenced my life in general is I've,

240
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:42.430
I've never lived with such a consistent sense of gratitude,
beauty,

241
00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:44.380
and love in my,
in my life.

242
00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:48.460
It's just flowing through my body presence to the exquisite little ripples of

243
00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:52.600
beauty in everything I do.
Um,
and a sense of gratitude for the little things.

244
00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:57.910
It sounds Cliche,
but it's embodied and I really feel it.
Um,
and in terms of,

245
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.740
and,
and that's,
uh,
that's,
uh,
something I'm really grateful for.
It's exquisite.

246
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:07.450
I've,
uh,
you know,
my little boy,
my wife is pregnant with,
we have another,

247
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.810
another sun coming in June.
Um,

248
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.700
and it's made me rethink this questions of risk
and it,
but on the other hand,

249
00:14:15.701 --> 00:14:17.560
it's very important,
not that oversteer I mean,

250
00:14:17.561 --> 00:14:21.580
one of the most important learning lessons that I've learned for myself and the

251
00:14:21.581 --> 00:14:26.470
training elite mental performer is,
is,
is people oversee all the time.

252
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.500
They over calibrate.
And so,
um,

253
00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.290
I've been very careful to sit with this and try to draw the right lessons out of

254
00:14:32.291 --> 00:14:36.880
it.
Not The wrong,
um,
and not too big a lesson and not too small lesson.
So,

255
00:14:36.881 --> 00:14:39.310
for example,
this was a huge technical oversight I had.

256
00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:40.630
I didn't realize I was taking a big risk here.

257
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:44.560
If a lot of big risks that I've taken in life,
um,
it's,
I'm with you.

258
00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:51.010
Um,
and I think I'm actually pretty good at navigating those of,
but em,

259
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.700
but I've been thinking about them quite a bit and of course,

260
00:14:52.701 --> 00:14:55.430
cognizant of the level of danger,
right?
Risk,
right?

261
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.200
But of course it's very important for me to be cognizant,

262
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.470
like in a group risk as we've discussed,
it's important to be presence,

263
00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:03.260
your own level and the level of everyone else around you.
Um,

264
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.890
we can get into some of those towels,
get into that.
Um,

265
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:11.440
but I've been really sitting with this,
you know,

266
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.930
since I was a really young boy,
I started playing chess when I was six years old.

267
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.170
By the time I was seven,
I was the top ranked player.
So I had in the country.

268
00:15:18.171 --> 00:15:23.171
So I had all this pressure on me and a big part of the way that I found my

269
00:15:23.361 --> 00:15:27.110
therapy was flow.
Can you expand that?
Yeah.

270
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:31.520
Like when I was under huge pressure,
external pressure for a little boy,
you know,

271
00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:34.820
my style is a chess player,
was to create chaos.
I love the game.

272
00:15:34.821 --> 00:15:39.470
I love the battle of chest attacking chess,
right,
right.
Attacking chest,
uh,
and,

273
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.080
and most players w you know,

274
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.070
when they have a lot of pressure on them in the scholastic chess world,

275
00:15:43.071 --> 00:15:44.300
for example,
in the shoe,
in many fields,

276
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.330
they learn how to memorize their way to victory,
right?

277
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:51.020
And they find shortcuts to getting good fast and be controlling the game all the

278
00:15:51.021 --> 00:15:52.880
way.
I think about reading points to think about rankings.

279
00:15:52.881 --> 00:15:56.000
They think about winning.
They have parental pressures,
they have,
you know,

280
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:59.750
school pressures.
They have sometimes publicity pressures if they're doing well.

281
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:02.420
So they want to control their way.
I had a different approach.

282
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:04.370
I like to mix it up.
I like to,
to,
you know,

283
00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:08.080
I grew up playing in Washington square park with the hustlers who taught me to,

284
00:16:08.081 --> 00:16:11.450
to battle.
It fit my personality.
And it was,
you know,

285
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.590
a core part of my competitive style to create chaos and find hidden harmonies

286
00:16:15.591 --> 00:16:19.520
and find flow in chaos.
And as I've reflected on this in recent years,

287
00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:24.521
a big part of how I've dealt with stresses has been to put myself into a flow

288
00:16:27.621 --> 00:16:30.890
state.
Um,
and this is a really an element of risk that I've been,

289
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.920
I've been thinking about it.
It's,

290
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.150
it's different when you're 20 and 25 and 30 years old as a professional

291
00:16:35.151 --> 00:16:39.080
competitor or professional fighter.
Um,
and then,
you know,

292
00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:42.410
now I'm 39 years old dad,

293
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.420
which is the most important thing I've ever done in my life,

294
00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:47.330
being a father and I'm so committed to it.
Um,

295
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:51.650
so I have to be quite cognizant of,
of the distinction.
For example,

296
00:16:51.651 --> 00:16:56.120
between between risk competitively and risk.
Mortally,

297
00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.120
when you're playing chess,
it feels like life and death.

298
00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.370
It really does feel like life and death.
When you lose a chess game,

299
00:17:01.371 --> 00:17:03.410
it feels like you've been shattered on the most fundamental level.

300
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.310
And so I was quite comfortable mixing it up,
um,

301
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:11.030
profoundly creating chaos and,
and I'd be willing to take those risks,

302
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.670
but actually it isn't life and death.
Right.

303
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:18.010
And then when you're a professional fighter or martial artist,
you are,
you,

304
00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.210
you know,
you can break arms and legs in a second if you're,

305
00:17:20.211 --> 00:17:23.720
if you're not in deep focus or you can break your neck.
But again,

306
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.160
the stakes are,
it's you out there,
right?
And then when you're a dad,

307
00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:29.390
it's a little bit different,
right?

308
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.390
Then like when you're surfing or when you're rock climbing or whatever,

309
00:17:32.391 --> 00:17:34.460
you're doing it to an extreme state.
Um,

310
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:39.520
so it's very important for me to be clear about the distinction between what

311
00:17:39.831 --> 00:17:42.250
felt like life and death is a chess player and what actually is life and death

312
00:17:42.251 --> 00:17:46.890
and f Oracle and literal.
Right.
And then there's the state of being,
um,

313
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.710
someone who's found deep flow as the ultimate therapy.

314
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:54.330
How do you,

315
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.500
there are number of different questions I want to ask for later to everything

316
00:17:58.501 --> 00:17:58.921
you just said.

317
00:17:58.921 --> 00:18:03.921
The first is how do you initiate or facilitate a flow state and how would you

318
00:18:04.201 --> 00:18:06.750
describe it?
Maybe we could hit that first.

319
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.310
Well,
I've had a lot of different ways of playing this over the years for me.

320
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:15.870
So I mean,
I can relate.

321
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.410
I can describe it in terms of myself and I can then we can go into how when I

322
00:18:19.411 --> 00:18:22.800
train people how I'd work with them.
Great.
Um,

323
00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.600
for me love has been a huge part of flow.
You know,

324
00:18:27.601 --> 00:18:32.601
I fell in love with chess and I found flow in the self expression of,

325
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:35.880
um,
through an art form that I,
that I absolutely loved.

326
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:38.780
And I think this is really important with children,
right?
To,

327
00:18:38.781 --> 00:18:43.230
to find something that they feel just connected to and that they can express

328
00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:43.771
themselves through.

329
00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:46.770
They can bring out the essence of their being through some art.
Um,

330
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.550
and then there was a tremendous competitive intensity.
And of course,

331
00:18:50.551 --> 00:18:53.280
stretching yourself to your limit is a huge part of it.

332
00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:55.620
It's a very important precondition to,
to flow.

333
00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:58.400
And I was always playing as people who were at my level or above.
And so I was,

334
00:18:58.401 --> 00:19:03.120
I was stretched,
right?
Um,
and then I was integrating in,
in my teenage years,

335
00:19:03.121 --> 00:19:05.790
start integrating meditation into my practice,
right?
So I got very good at,

336
00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:09.780
at increasing my somatic awareness,
my physiological,
introspective sensitivity.

337
00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.960
I began to feel the subtle ripples of quality in my process.

338
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:16.260
I could feel when I moved from a nine or a 10 out of 10 down to back down to a

339
00:19:16.261 --> 00:19:18.630
nine or an eight.
You're talking about in the meditation itself,

340
00:19:18.631 --> 00:19:21.330
that was only in like through my meditation practice,

341
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:26.390
you became more tactically sensitive when doing push hands or some other type of

342
00:19:26.911 --> 00:19:29.850
practice,
chess initially chest and then into push hands.
Right.

343
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.900
Why is the tactile component important in chess?

344
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:41.670
I think it's hugely important,
um,
in mental disciplines.
So for example,
you know,

345
00:19:41.671 --> 00:19:44.600
in chess and today a lot of what I do today is,

346
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.500
is have this laboratory of training.

347
00:19:46.501 --> 00:19:51.120
Elite mental performer is largely in finance investors and I'm a huge part of

348
00:19:51.121 --> 00:19:54.280
the training is in their physiological introspective sensitivity.
It's,

349
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:58.050
that's the sematic awareness.
That's the foundational training.
Why?

350
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.500
Well,
first of all,
you know,
we can't just separate our mind in our body.
Totally.

351
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.580
Um,
I mean,
you heart tesion duality,
right?
I mean,

352
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.630
this is your way of life as well,

353
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:16.820
but we intuitively can feel things way before we are consciously aware of them.

354
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.160
All right,
the chess player always senses danger before he sees it.

355
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.360
Just like you know,

356
00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.960
the hunter will sense the shark with the Jaguar before you'll see it,
right?

357
00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.013
Then he'll look for it.

358
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:29.520
So the chess players processes often to be studying a position to sense

359
00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:32.940
opportunity or danger and then to start looking for it,
right?

360
00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.670
Deconstruct what it is and then find what it probably is and that's our

361
00:20:35.671 --> 00:20:36.720
calculating,
right?

362
00:20:36.721 --> 00:20:39.560
But that sends comes before or if you're a great decision maker,

363
00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:43.260
if you're an investor,
you can sense danger,
right?
You can sense opportunity,

364
00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:48.450
but you need to have stilled your waters internally to feel the,

365
00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:50.560
<v 2>like the subtle changes inside of you.</v>

366
00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:54.390
That would be opportunity or the crystallization of complex ideas,
um,

367
00:20:54.391 --> 00:20:57.040
or danger or onset of a cognitive bias,
for example,

368
00:20:57.041 --> 00:21:00.220
which is hugely important as a chess player or as an investor or is anything

369
00:21:00.221 --> 00:21:04.690
else you,
you know,
this is one of the areas where I,

370
00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:07.880
we've had this ongoing dialogue and our friendship around what I call armchair

371
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.920
professors,
right?
Um,
Velocify ologists right?
Philosophy.
Politics.
Yes.

372
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.880
So the people,
this is a philosophy,
soldiers is a term of um,

373
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.620
Robert Pirsig is the author of Zen in the art of motorcycle maintenance is one

374
00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:21.460
of my favorite books and thinkers,
friend of mine.
Um,

375
00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:23.030
<v 4>okay.</v>

376
00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:25.390
<v 2>You know the difference between the philosopher and the philosophy.
I'll just,</v>

377
00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.830
is what Tim is referring to.
Um,

378
00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:31.900
or the writer and the literary critic or the man in the arena and the arms or

379
00:21:33.081 --> 00:21:33.760
professor

380
00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.960
<v 1>or Remy from Ratatouille and Antonio.
Okay.
I don't know that one.
Food critic.</v>

381
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:42.130
Okay.
Yeah,
there it is.
Good.
Yes,
there it is.

382
00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:46.590
<v 2>And so when we think about for example,
cognitive biases,
the people,
the,
the,</v>

383
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.850
the academics who study cognitive biases who speak about them in mind

384
00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:53.540
<v 1>and just for people who have no context on cognitive biases and example to like</v>

385
00:21:53.541 --> 00:21:56.210
the sunk cost fallacy,
right?
I've spent this amount,

386
00:21:56.211 --> 00:21:59.180
therefore I should put good money after bad because I feel like I have,

387
00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:04.490
I need to somehow try to salvage this money that I've put into a given position.

388
00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:08.180
Right?
I just wanted to give people some examples.
Who,
who,
um,

389
00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:12.980
we've had a number of meals with them.
Uh,
there's a gent wouldn't think twice.

390
00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.930
What was the author's name again?
Do you recall?
Mabou son?
Yeah.

391
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:18.890
Michael Bovis in is or your thing isn't there?
We are for people interested.

392
00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:19.740
Sorry to interrupt.

393
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.600
<v 2>Yup.
Um,</v>

394
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.550
and so one of the interesting things about,
about the dialogue,

395
00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.870
the academic dialogue of cognitive biases is that there's the idea that the eye,

396
00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:35.530
the biases have to operate completely separately from the intuitive process,

397
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.220
right?

398
00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.790
As if we have an intuitive process and then we have to go through a checklist of

399
00:22:39.791 --> 00:22:41.980
cognitive biases.
In my experience,

400
00:22:41.981 --> 00:22:45.220
really high level thinkers have integrated cognitive biases or an awareness of

401
00:22:45.221 --> 00:22:47.410
cognitive bias.
He's into their,
into intuitive process,
right?

402
00:22:47.411 --> 00:22:49.480
So this is constant process.
We discussed this,

403
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:52.500
we just got this a couple years ago actually.
Um,
yeah,

404
00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:59.000
where you're,
you're deconstructing technical awareness into something that,

405
00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.150
and so this process,
for example,
of,
of building a pyramid of knowledge,

406
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.120
we have a certain technical foundation.
We have a high level intuitive leap.

407
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.600
We can then deconstruct the intuitive leap into something that we can understand

408
00:23:08.601 --> 00:23:11.450
technically and replicate technically and then we are raising our foundation of

409
00:23:11.451 --> 00:23:14.540
higher and higher level intuitive leaps,
right?
This is this pyramid of knowledge,

410
00:23:14.541 --> 00:23:14.991
which in my,

411
00:23:14.991 --> 00:23:19.730
in my process is built upon by the intuitive leaps are what's guiding it.

412
00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:20.593
Similarly,

413
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:25.280
we can learn how to take technical material and integrate it into our intuitive

414
00:23:25.281 --> 00:23:29.360
understanding,
but we aren't going to intuit the cognitive bias.

415
00:23:29.361 --> 00:23:33.980
We're going to intuit the feeling then that corresponds the corresponds with a

416
00:23:33.981 --> 00:23:36.620
bias being present.
And so we think about this relative to the language.
Again,

417
00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:40.280
Robert Pirsig,
I liked the language of dynamic versus static quality,
right?

418
00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:40.980
When you're,

419
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:45.830
if you think about the timeline in a competitive state for in a chess game,

420
00:23:45.831 --> 00:23:48.320
there's a certain objective truth to a chest position.

421
00:23:48.321 --> 00:23:51.140
If we go that is a timeline which is moving,
um,
which is moving,

422
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.350
I think our a six term of being at the front of the freight train of reality,

423
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:54.591
right?

424
00:23:54.591 --> 00:23:57.560
Freight train is pushing through dynamic qualities right at the front of that

425
00:23:57.561 --> 00:24:00.710
freight train,
right?
Think about that as a timeline and then the,

426
00:24:00.711 --> 00:24:03.440
those are the chess,
the chess players mind studying the position.

427
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.100
When the chess players present to the position,
it's continuing,
right?
You're,

428
00:24:07.101 --> 00:24:10.070
you're,
you're just running parallel to the truth of the position to,

429
00:24:10.071 --> 00:24:13.700
they didn't have the quality of the position,
but if let's say something changes,

430
00:24:13.701 --> 00:24:14.780
you make a slight mistake,

431
00:24:14.781 --> 00:24:16.910
you move from having a slight advantage to us like disadvantage,

432
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:21.890
but you are emotionally still connected,
attached to having a slight advantage.

433
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:25.140
Then what's going to happen is that you are sort of stopping your dinette,

434
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:27.830
your dynamic qualities becoming a static,
but the timeline of the suspicions,

435
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:30.490
continuing the Games continuing.
But what's going to happen then is it,

436
00:24:30.491 --> 00:24:33.890
you're going to subtly reject positions that you should accept and you're going

437
00:24:33.891 --> 00:24:35.480
to stretch for positions that you can't,

438
00:24:35.481 --> 00:24:39.200
for evaluations that you can't really reach and you're going to fall into a

439
00:24:39.201 --> 00:24:42.490
downward spiral.
So that's,
that's the onset of a cognitive bias.
In that case,

440
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:43.370
the cognitive bias would,

441
00:24:43.371 --> 00:24:47.570
would relate to to the emotional clinging to a past evaluation.

442
00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:49.360
<v 1>But if you had the present state awareness,</v>

443
00:24:49.361 --> 00:24:53.230
which you had trained through different tools and approaches that you use with

444
00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:56.470
easily performers,
for instance,
you would,
you would have,

445
00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.580
you would sense the feeling of that cognitive dissonance and not get caught up

446
00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.320
in sort of the slipstream of that

447
00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:03.940
<v 2>dislocation.
Exactly.</v>

448
00:25:03.941 --> 00:25:08.620
And the way that you would sense that in this case is that you would feel the

449
00:25:08.621 --> 00:25:11.980
slip away from dynamic quality.
Right?
And so,

450
00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.710
and then you would deconstruct that feeling and then you would see what the

451
00:25:14.711 --> 00:25:18.790
biases at setting it.
So this is,
this is really important to to to say,
right?

452
00:25:18.791 --> 00:25:21.730
It's not that we're going to intuitively develop the ability to know exactly

453
00:25:21.731 --> 00:25:23.290
what bias might be setting in in the moment,

454
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:26.530
but we're going to cultivate the ability to have presence.
Right?

455
00:25:26.531 --> 00:25:28.780
I think about they'd have cultivating qualities,
a way of life,

456
00:25:28.781 --> 00:25:31.870
cultivating presence as a way of life in little moments and small and we're

457
00:25:31.871 --> 00:25:33.520
holding our babies when we're reading a book,

458
00:25:33.521 --> 00:25:36.070
when we're having a conversation with a friend when we're meditating.

459
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:36.830
How do you help

460
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:41.830
<v 1>people to identify what that feeling to become more sensitized to it?</v>

461
00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:46.160
And just as a,
as a,
maybe not a counter example,

462
00:25:46.161 --> 00:25:51.161
but an example of not listening to intuition or instinct.

463
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:55.080
So we were both in Costa Rica recently and doing paddle boarding last week,

464
00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.970
last meal of the trip,
uh,
we,
we go out to celebrate,

465
00:25:58.971 --> 00:26:03.200
we go to this seafood restaurant,
food comes out,
it's a Sunday.

466
00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:08.680
And I leaned over the plate and smelled the food and immediately knew that it

467
00:26:11.331 --> 00:26:13.970
was something I shouldn't eat.
And despite that,
you know,

468
00:26:13.971 --> 00:26:17.300
everybody's ordering drinks,
everybody's celebrating,
went into the food.

469
00:26:17.301 --> 00:26:20.810
And about a third of the way through I stopped and I just push the plate away.

470
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.910
And then lo and behold,

471
00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:27.940
everybody gets severe severe food poisoning except for the two people who,

472
00:26:28.011 --> 00:26:32.090
I guess we tried to narrow it down to whether it was the garlic dip or any

473
00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:33.980
number of other things.
But yeah,
we were,

474
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:36.990
we were on the toilet each like every five minutes for,

475
00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:38.930
for the next 12 hours minimum.

476
00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:42.150
<v 2>And the great part of it is you and I were,
we were joining veterans.</v>

477
00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.980
We were sharing the same toilet.
So that was a hell of

478
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.170
<v 3>a night and we never saw each other.
It was amazing.</v>

479
00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:48.570
But I heard that flushing happening,
taking turns.
That was,

480
00:26:48.571 --> 00:26:51.900
that was a brutal experience.
I remember watching you sniffing,

481
00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:54.870
you had this like expression of concern come over you at the dinner table.

482
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.970
And like I saw that moment,
maybe I wasn't present enough to you and you didn't.

483
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:03.330
It's a great example of you didn't fully trust your gut,

484
00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.090
but you were right on is amazing.

485
00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:10.140
Before I've felt a sort of social pressure to conform and not rock the boat.

486
00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:15.600
So how do you help someone say in the world of investing just as an example,

487
00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:20.680
develop,
not only develop the sensitivity to,

488
00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:26.040
to separate that signal from the noise,
but also to actually listen to it,
right?

489
00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:31.560
Uh,
yeah,
these are,
these are two,
two different points,
right?

490
00:27:31.561 --> 00:27:34.650
So,
right.
So let's talk about developing it and let's talk about listening to it,

491
00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:37.740
right?
Because there's both.
So hugely important.

492
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.360
And I'd frame them both thematically,
um,
in,
in different ways.

493
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:45.330
And I'd build training systems around them,
both.
It would be quite different.

494
00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:49.770
So when we're thinking about,
about cultivating the awareness,

495
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:55.460
I mean I think that a lot of this relates to a return to a more natural state,

496
00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.110
right?
The,

497
00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:03.540
this isn't so much about learning as unlearning agreed to getting out of our own

498
00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:04.830
way.
Releasing obstructions.

499
00:28:04.831 --> 00:28:07.240
I think about the training process is the movement would unobstructed self

500
00:28:07.241 --> 00:28:09.980
expression,
right?
Obstructed Nis.
Um,

501
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.960
we have so many habits that are fundamentally blocking us right from the phone.

502
00:28:12.961 --> 00:28:15.600
Addictions.
Um,
people are constantly distracted.

503
00:28:15.601 --> 00:28:18.270
People don't have the ability to sit in empty space anymore.

504
00:28:18.271 --> 00:28:20.190
People are bombarded by inputs all the time.

505
00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.990
They're in a constantly reactive state.

506
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:26.340
So one way that you could frame this out as is cultivating a way of life,

507
00:28:26.341 --> 00:28:28.260
which is fundamentally proactive,
right?

508
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:31.770
In little things and big and you can build day architectures that are

509
00:28:31.771 --> 00:28:34.770
fundamentally proactive.
But then getting into the,
the,
the,

510
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.270
the weeds a little bit more.

511
00:28:36.271 --> 00:28:41.271
I think it's most foundational to develop a mindfulness practice to cultivate

512
00:28:42.151 --> 00:28:45.990
the ability to sense the most subtle ripples of human experience.
Now,

513
00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:49.260
I've been trying to onboard people in specifically in the,
in the finance space,

514
00:28:49.261 --> 00:28:52.020
for example,
in the meditation for a bit over eight years.
Now.

515
00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.300
Initially I would just try to get up guys to meditate and look at me like I was

516
00:28:54.301 --> 00:28:58.140
crazy.
Then what I realized,
I had this breakthrough,

517
00:28:58.141 --> 00:29:01.590
which was that if I had them start doing stress and recovery interval training,

518
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:07.950
then when,
so oscillating heart rate between one seventies and one 40 say,

519
00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:09.120
um,

520
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.790
so let's say someone does a six or eight or 10 minute warm up and then they're

521
00:29:11.791 --> 00:29:14.250
on a heart rate interval doing some kind of cardio bike or whatever,

522
00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:16.240
moving their heart rate up a number two,

523
00:29:16.241 --> 00:29:21.241
one 71 41 to become aware of the quality of their focus on their breath during

524
00:29:21.661 --> 00:29:23.490
the recovery intervals,
um,

525
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:27.330
enhancing their ability to lower their heart rate more quickly and they start to

526
00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:29.990
feel their heart rates listened to it.
When that awareness we're kicking,

527
00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:33.690
I'd start,
I'd layer and meditation and the onramp was just much more successful.

528
00:29:33.691 --> 00:29:37.410
People would just,
and then what I started to refine that with is is biofeedback,

529
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.140
so now what I'll do is I'll have them do the stress recovery interval training.

530
00:29:40.141 --> 00:29:43.780
Then I'll have them do some form of biofeedback often with for example,

531
00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:47.470
heart variability through heart math and working with a specialist and then when

532
00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:52.530
they begin to have a certain kind of consistency of their ability to observe,

533
00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:58.240
to enhance their emotional regulation to observe these subtle ripples between

534
00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:02.830
stress and coherence and you can see their biometric data.

535
00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.000
Then you layer in meditation and then the,

536
00:30:05.001 --> 00:30:08.440
the onramp is even more powerful and so then they embedded layer in a meditation

537
00:30:08.441 --> 00:30:08.801
practice.

538
00:30:08.801 --> 00:30:13.330
I think headspace is a wonderful tool for Larry and repetition and I think for a

539
00:30:13.331 --> 00:30:13.810
lot of people.

540
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:18.810
Also starting with headspace before bed is another kind of gateway drug approach

541
00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:24.580
to then building into our leading into the morning meditation,

542
00:30:24.581 --> 00:30:27.490
which a lot of people have trouble with because they wake up,
they feel rushed.

543
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.360
It's another thing to layer in on top of the brushing the teeth and getting the

544
00:30:31.361 --> 00:30:34.080
kids ready,
et cetera.
And so sometimes the evening approached,

545
00:30:34.081 --> 00:30:37.870
but I agreed that had spaces really useful.
And I think it's really important,

546
00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.340
I think.
I think you're absolutely right there.

547
00:30:39.341 --> 00:30:43.810
And I think it's really important to have a core meditation practice,

548
00:30:43.811 --> 00:30:46.540
which is at least in the beginning,

549
00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:51.610
in case in the conditions in your life that are most conducive to deep focus and

550
00:30:51.611 --> 00:30:53.410
to not be distracted later in life.

551
00:30:53.411 --> 00:30:57.190
We wanna be able to tap our meditation under complete and in chaos,

552
00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:01.350
but we want to cultivate it initially in the most peaceful time possible.

553
00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:05.050
If you have kids waking up before the kids,
um,
are up or in the evening,

554
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:08.230
once they're asleep or if you don't have kids,
then life is much simpler.

555
00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:09.850
Or during your commute.

556
00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:16.210
I've found a lot of people who will just like throw on headspace or some song

557
00:31:16.211 --> 00:31:18.720
that they meditate too and they know they have 20 minutes on the subway.

558
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.850
It's like,
all right,
that's my 20 minutes.
Right?
Um,
yeah,

559
00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.330
I enjoy meditating on the commute a lot.
Personally,

560
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:28.510
W W you've been meditating for a long time.
I mean,
what,

561
00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:29.560
I'm not sure how you feel about this.

562
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:32.110
I find that if people can have the first two,

563
00:31:32.111 --> 00:31:34.630
three months of meditation practice in a quiet room,

564
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:38.880
then if they start doing it in their commute,
it's a much,
and they've,

565
00:31:38.881 --> 00:31:42.350
they've sort of built the foundation of it in this really quiet space.
I think.

566
00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.890
I think that,
from what I can tell,

567
00:31:44.891 --> 00:31:48.550
it appears to depend a lot on what type of concentrator you are.

568
00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.970
And what I mean by that is if you look at writers,
for instance,

569
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:57.390
there's some writers who want to be in a quiet environment in order to hear

570
00:31:58.931 --> 00:32:02.350
whatever the Muse is whispering,
and they'll go to a library,

571
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.260
they'll go to someplace like that.
I can't do that for whatever reason.

572
00:32:05.261 --> 00:32:08.650
I thrive in noisy environments because if I have the noise,

573
00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:14.320
I feel like it focuses me.
It forces me to focus inward.
So for me,

574
00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.970
uh,
studying languages,
even in a loud environment,

575
00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.070
writing in a loud environment,
uh,

576
00:32:21.071 --> 00:32:23.200
for whatever reason is a forcing function for me.

577
00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:28.260
But I can definitely see why for even perhaps a majority of people it would be,

578
00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:32.470
I think it's partially due to the fact that,
for instance,

579
00:32:32.471 --> 00:32:36.010
I'm looking at your wall right now and the fact that that picture is tilted like

580
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.930
five degrees to the right is making me totally bonkers.
You think we should fix,

581
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:44.780
we fix it.
This is training for the rest of the time was always your therapy.

582
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:48.020
But the,
the,
the,
the same is true.
Auditorially.

583
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:53.080
So if I have a controlled noise like music or the,

584
00:32:53.121 --> 00:32:57.170
the Chica to Dick Jackets of the,
of the car in the subway,

585
00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.080
I can focus on that repetitive noise.

586
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:04.970
But if I'm sitting in a space that I want to be quiet and I have that

587
00:33:04.971 --> 00:33:08.300
controlling aspect of my personality trying to impose itself on something I

588
00:33:08.301 --> 00:33:09.134
can't control.

589
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:13.940
And then there's like somebody's hitting reverse in a truck and I can hear that

590
00:33:13.941 --> 00:33:17.090
outside.
It will drive you nuts.
Uh,

591
00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:21.230
long observation to a short comment.
But,
uh,

592
00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:25.760
I do think that if you can drop in,

593
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:29.960
in a quiet environment,
the point being,
as you said,

594
00:33:29.961 --> 00:33:31.640
I think to stack the deck in the beginning.
Yeah.

595
00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:36.700
Like learn how to do this in a controlled unstressful environment and then you

596
00:33:38.391 --> 00:33:42.460
can ratchet up over time to when you can use it in the most stressful of

597
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:43.820
environments,
right?

598
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.300
Because we don't ultimately want to be meditating and flower garden.

599
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:50.750
We want to be able to meditate and have a meditative state throughout our life

600
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:54.990
in a hurricane and a thunder storm.
Um,
you know,

601
00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:58.980
and when sharks are attacking you at any moment,
cause that's paddleboarding.

602
00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:04.850
When you paddle boarding the last day on a first trip and Josh his leg,

603
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:09.260
you'll be fine.
And then three leashes snap and all hell breaks loose.

604
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.500
That's a long story.
It killers that comes in.

605
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.630
So that's just a little context here.

606
00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.890
Timbo and I have been on this great adventure.
Um,
the stand up paddle surfing,

607
00:34:18.891 --> 00:34:20.780
taking it on together.
And we found this,

608
00:34:20.781 --> 00:34:23.500
we've got a great friend down in Costa Rica,
Eric Anderson,

609
00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.850
who I'm actually as the,
the other other podcasts other than yours.

610
00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:30.110
They listened to him.
I have the paddle Luca potato paddle.
Eric's awesome.

611
00:34:30.111 --> 00:34:33.790
He's a great dude.
You're on the blue zones up.
He's a brilliant teacher.
Um,

612
00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:38.000
really fascinating mind deconstructing standup paddle surfing on increasingly

613
00:34:38.001 --> 00:34:39.050
small boards for us.

614
00:34:39.051 --> 00:34:41.700
And we've been going out there and we've had some hilarious close calls.

615
00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:45.050
The last trip a couple of weeks ago,
we almost,
we almost,
we had,

616
00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.660
we almost destroyed each other.
Yeah.

617
00:34:47.661 --> 00:34:52.070
We had this one like witching hour where the g the Juju is really weird.

618
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:57.550
Almost everybody either getting to capitated impaled by a board or just head on

619
00:34:58.761 --> 00:35:02.410
Justin collision,
which is what,
but the point that you bring up,
I think is,

620
00:35:02.411 --> 00:35:04.610
is right on about meditation.
That,
that,
you know,

621
00:35:04.611 --> 00:35:07.430
when you're building training programs for elite mental performers,

622
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:11.450
the most important thing is to understand them so deeply and build programs that

623
00:35:11.451 --> 00:35:14.570
are unique to their,
to their funk,
embraced their funk.
Um,

624
00:35:14.571 --> 00:35:18.770
that's a term my buddy Graham,
who's a,
who's a dear friend of ours,

625
00:35:18.771 --> 00:35:22.640
who's comes on our surf adventures with us.
Um,
he said,
brilliant thought partner.

626
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:27.170
Um,
embrace the funk.
Could you explain that?
Yeah.
We have to embrace our funk.

627
00:35:27.171 --> 00:35:30.440
We have to figure out what,
you know,
you think about the,

628
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:34.010
the entanglement of genius and madness,
right?
Or Brilliance and eccentricity.

629
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:38.450
Understanding that entanglement is always a precursor working with anybody who's

630
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.210
trying to be world class at something because that entanglement is fundamental

631
00:35:42.211 --> 00:35:45.930
to their being.
And they have to ultimately embraced,
embraced their funk,

632
00:35:45.931 --> 00:35:50.570
embrace their eccentricity,
embrace what makes them different,
um,

633
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:54.030
and then build on it,
right?
And we shall,
we think about self expression.

634
00:35:54.031 --> 00:35:56.490
It's not trying to take everyone and put them into the same mold as trying to

635
00:35:56.491 --> 00:36:00.480
understand someone very deeply in build a training program,
a way of life.
Um,

636
00:36:00.481 --> 00:36:03.390
that helps them bring out the essence of their being through their art,

637
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.700
whatever their art is.
I mean,

638
00:36:04.701 --> 00:36:08.790
then that's how I relate to the path to excellence in chess and martial arts,
in,

639
00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:12.900
in different arts,
in,
in,
in very actively.
In the investing space.

640
00:36:12.901 --> 00:36:16.740
When I work in education with children,
um,
through a nonprofit,
it's,

641
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:21.630
it's again that the movement,
um,
set to unobstructed self expression,
but,

642
00:36:21.631 --> 00:36:24.180
but the problem is that teachers don't listen.
They don't know how to listen,

643
00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:25.081
right?

644
00:36:25.081 --> 00:36:29.010
They don't know how to sit or parents to sit in an empty space and observe the

645
00:36:29.011 --> 00:36:32.460
nuance of their child's mind where their students Mont and then build a way of

646
00:36:32.461 --> 00:36:34.020
life around that.
They,
they,
they,

647
00:36:34.021 --> 00:36:35.550
people are used to teach them the way they learned.

648
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:38.130
They got martial arts instructors,

649
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:41.610
almost all of them trained a certain way and then teach that way,

650
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.460
which alienates 65,
70% of the students.
By definition.

651
00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:49.230
It's very rare that you have someone who can take the time to,

652
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:52.920
and it takes a lot of time to know someone deeply enough to build a training

653
00:36:52.921 --> 00:36:55.140
program in a way of life around who they are.
I mean,

654
00:36:55.141 --> 00:36:56.700
for me and what I only work with,

655
00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:01.850
with eight teams and I don't take on new clients,
very seldom.

656
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.720
I take on a new client and I won't work with more than eight people.

657
00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.300
You also don't do a lot of PR for everybody listening.

658
00:37:06.301 --> 00:37:10.410
I always get these emails and texts like,
Hey,

659
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:14.340
could you intro me to Josh of my show?
And I'm like,
he's not,

660
00:37:14.341 --> 00:37:18.450
he's not going to do it.
Jim,
you're the only person once a year or two,

661
00:37:18.451 --> 00:37:20.610
I either one guy who brings me out of my,
her medicaid,

662
00:37:20.611 --> 00:37:24.740
if I live a bit of a strange life because I'm not on a strict,

663
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:26.460
doesn't feel strange to me.
It feels completely natural.

664
00:37:26.461 --> 00:37:30.210
But I am not on Facebook or Twitter or Instagram or any of these things.

665
00:37:30.211 --> 00:37:32.910
I don't even know the names of most of them.
I have an email account though.

666
00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:36.360
Do you have that?
Um,
bought straight.

667
00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:42.120
I cultivate empty space as a way of life for,
for um,

668
00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:44.220
for the creative process.
So Timbo,

669
00:37:44.221 --> 00:37:46.290
you're the one guy who brings me out of the cave where we had a lot of fun

670
00:37:46.291 --> 00:37:47.124
together.

671
00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:51.330
You're talking about these top performers and getting to know them on a very

672
00:37:51.331 --> 00:37:52.164
deep,

673
00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:57.570
subtle level so that you can help them express that,

674
00:37:57.571 --> 00:38:01.680
the combination of their madness and genius or at least embrace it among other

675
00:38:01.681 --> 00:38:05.910
things.
How do you think about parenting?
Yeah,

676
00:38:05.911 --> 00:38:09.730
let's dig into this one.
Um,
all right,
so,
and then let's look,
remember loop,

677
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:12.990
bag after this cause we to finish this discussion of,

678
00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:15.930
first of all we were talking about how to cultivate the sematic awareness and

679
00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:20.400
then how to listen to it.
Let's go back to that.
A train to listen to it.
Um,
okay.

680
00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.620
Parenting Jack.
Well,
Jack's the love of my life.

681
00:38:22.621 --> 00:38:25.770
I mean this kid is such an awesome dude and I parenting has,
um,

682
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:31.740
has been the most fantastic learning experience I've ever gone through.

683
00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:35.830
So from when he was born I,

684
00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.480
<v 2>I tried very hard not to go in with a,</v>

685
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:41.680
with a lot of preconceived ideas and to be attuned to him,

686
00:38:41.681 --> 00:38:45.610
to listen to him from when he was just days,
weeks old.
He was teaching me,

687
00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.810
you know,
you talk about teaching presence,
W W we,

688
00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:51.460
our eyes would be connected and if I would think about something else,
he would,

689
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:54.680
his eyes would pull me back if he,
if there was any distraction and said,

690
00:38:54.681 --> 00:38:56.830
and he would pull me back and he's got a little older,

691
00:38:56.831 --> 00:39:00.790
he would just take your face in my face and pull it back,
um,
in the sweetest way.

692
00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:03.280
And so the depth of connection,
you know,

693
00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:08.610
being deeply attuned to a young spirit that hasn't become blocked,

694
00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.080
that isn't that state of unobstructed self expression,

695
00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:16.750
that is just this unbelievably game learner,

696
00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:18.940
unblocked learner.
And Jack is the game.

697
00:39:18.941 --> 00:39:23.890
This little person I've ever known in my life.
Um,
and so,
but,

698
00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:24.071
but I,

699
00:39:24.071 --> 00:39:27.820
of course I have been thinking about learning and education for lot of years and

700
00:39:27.821 --> 00:39:32.170
so I had some,
some thoughts.
And so for example,

701
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:37.180
I think that control is the need for control is something that inhibits people

702
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:41.170
in life.
The need to have external conditions be just so,

703
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:45.320
and in order for them to be able to,
um,
Timo is pointing at the,

704
00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:48.460
at my grandmother's painting,
that was my grandma's painting.
It's a beauty,
right?

705
00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:52.570
That's great.
Stella,
Stella Waitzkin chess.
That's,
that's her self portrait.
Okay.

706
00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.630
We're going to leave it messed up.
We're working on control.
So like from one,

707
00:39:55.631 --> 00:39:56.740
a young age for me I,

708
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:59.510
but when I started playing chess I would create the cast and the board like I

709
00:39:59.511 --> 00:40:00.880
described and then I would play in,

710
00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.760
in chess shops with people blowing smoke and playing music.

711
00:40:03.761 --> 00:40:07.000
And I'd play chess with like loud butoh monk chance bursting into,
you know,

712
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.520
in my head from speakers I would,

713
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:12.130
when I play cards I would never plan things you normally,

714
00:40:12.131 --> 00:40:14.560
I'd always keep the melds out of order so that again,

715
00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:18.490
when I would play cards I parents like a on card card game playing like Gin

716
00:40:18.491 --> 00:40:23.200
rummy.
I would never organize my hand.
I'd always keep it Usaf Meld.
Yeah.

717
00:40:23.201 --> 00:40:28.060
Like if you have like three sevens,
right?
Or like,
all right,
Jack Queen,

718
00:40:28.061 --> 00:40:32.110
Jacqueline,
queen of [inaudible].
I would keep everything out of order,

719
00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.840
so I'd have to reorganize it in my mind.
I'd keep my room messy.

720
00:40:34.841 --> 00:40:36.820
So you wouldn't gather your IC,
you wouldn't,

721
00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:39.850
you wouldn't move your cards around to organized.
Right.

722
00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:44.530
I was creating chaos everywhere to train at being able to be at peace in chaos

723
00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:46.460
and organize things in it.

724
00:40:46.461 --> 00:40:50.110
That was kind of part of my way of life and I found it to be a huge advantage

725
00:40:50.111 --> 00:40:52.180
that I had competitively.
And so one thing,

726
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:56.080
one of the biggest mistakes that I observed in the first year of Jack's life,

727
00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:59.200
we are two objective that I observed with parents is that they do have this

728
00:40:59.201 --> 00:41:03.460
language around weather,
whether being good or bad.
And whenever the weather,

729
00:41:03.461 --> 00:41:05.800
when it was raining,
they'd be like,
it's bad weather you here.
You know,

730
00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:07.960
mom's babysitters.
Dad's talking about if it's bad weather,

731
00:41:07.961 --> 00:41:09.820
we can't go out or it's good weather we can go out.

732
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:13.060
And so that means that somehow we're externally reliant on conditions being

733
00:41:13.061 --> 00:41:14.710
perfect in order to be able to go out and have a good time.

734
00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:18.310
So Jack and I never missed a single storm.
Every rainstorm.
I don't think we,

735
00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:20.800
I don't think we've missed one storm

736
00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:25.030
other than maybe one when he was sick,
but we,
I don't think we've,

737
00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.020
I don't think we've missed a single storm rain or snow going outside and romping

738
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:32.110
it.
And we've developed this language around how beautiful it was.
And so when,

739
00:41:32.111 --> 00:41:33.800
now whenever there's a rainy day,
Jack says,
look,

740
00:41:33.801 --> 00:41:36.080
that adds such a beautiful rainy day and we go out and we play in it.

741
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:40.820
And you know,
I wanted him to have this internal locus of control,
right,

742
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.540
to not be reliant on external conditions being just so,

743
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.850
and then that kind of has,
now he's four,

744
00:41:46.851 --> 00:41:48.500
he's getting older as we've been playing with these things,

745
00:41:48.501 --> 00:41:53.501
we began meditating together when he was a little over a year just doing breath

746
00:41:53.791 --> 00:41:54.081
work.

747
00:41:54.081 --> 00:41:59.081
Initially we started doing meditation work when he was in that kind of most pure

748
00:41:59.601 --> 00:42:02.480
state.
So when he'd be taking a warm bath and he was lying on his back and being

749
00:42:02.481 --> 00:42:06.050
completely relaxed,
blissed out,
we would just naturally breathe together.

750
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:09.860
I wanted the habit to be formed in something that was the initial experience to

751
00:42:09.861 --> 00:42:14.570
be in conditions that are most conducive to just natural piece.
Um,

752
00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:20.350
and then we have in recent months been taking it to an interesting funky place.

753
00:42:22.461 --> 00:42:25.790
So,
so he was watching me do the Wim Hoff training and I'd be putting my hands in

754
00:42:25.791 --> 00:42:29.630
ice buckets and doing this interesting breathwork through cold water and he

755
00:42:29.631 --> 00:42:31.440
would initially watching to come over to stick his finger in,

756
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:33.980
put his hand in two.
This is a great moment.

757
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:37.850
A couple months ago we were out romping in this huge snow storm and Jack about

758
00:42:37.851 --> 00:42:38.750
10 minutes into it,

759
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:41.870
we just gone this long search for the right carrot to put on it to make a

760
00:42:41.871 --> 00:42:46.040
snowman with.
We found that the nose,
we found it and then Jack got,

761
00:42:46.041 --> 00:42:49.220
he was in this huge drift and he got his boots just load it up with snow and he

762
00:42:49.221 --> 00:42:51.470
looked at me and he said,
Dad,
dad,
my,
my feet are cold,

763
00:42:51.471 --> 00:42:53.300
they're filled with my boots are filled with snow.
But that's okay.

764
00:42:53.301 --> 00:42:57.980
I'll just do the Wim Hoff and make them warm.
And has looked at him and then he,

765
00:42:57.981 --> 00:42:58.491
for an hour and a half,

766
00:42:58.491 --> 00:43:01.400
we played after that feet just covered with snow and he was completely fine.

767
00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:04.670
Never mentioned it again.
And then he got increasingly interested in,

768
00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:09.110
in this internal terrain and we would take hot baths together.

769
00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:11.900
We take a bath together every night and then he would want to turn on the cold

770
00:43:11.901 --> 00:43:15.980
shower and get in it.
And he would,
we'd play what we call the,
it's a good game.

771
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:20.840
And so we kind of reframe this thing,
you know,
I,
I have this,
you know,

772
00:43:20.841 --> 00:43:23.720
people tend to bounce off of discomfort,
whether it's mental or physical.

773
00:43:23.721 --> 00:43:26.210
And so they run up at whether,
if they're running to internal resistance,

774
00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.850
whether it's a meditation training or someone exposing a weakness,

775
00:43:28.851 --> 00:43:31.640
or if there are training and someone might be better than them,
whatever,

776
00:43:31.641 --> 00:43:34.430
whatever it is,
they bounce away from things that might expose them,

777
00:43:34.431 --> 00:43:38.060
they're repelled from it.
Right,
right.
And,
but you know,

778
00:43:38.061 --> 00:43:41.250
the flip side of this is to learn the way I,

779
00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.340
you I talk about living on the other side of pain,

780
00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:46.580
pain being like mental or physical discomfort,
right?

781
00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.880
And much of life that's so rich comes from then the other side of it.
Um,

782
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:55.010
the other set of challenge,
internal or external challenge.
And I,

783
00:43:55.011 --> 00:43:56.570
with Jack of course I'm not using that,

784
00:43:57.650 --> 00:44:00.160
but it's a little child's embodiment of it.
We,

785
00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:03.890
we started to play with turning on the cold water and he would say it's so good

786
00:44:03.891 --> 00:44:06.380
that day and we'd kind of be in a hot bath and play in the cold.

787
00:44:06.381 --> 00:44:10.610
And he would say,
it's so good.
It's so good.
And he began to have this gorgeous,

788
00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:14.930
blissful smile,
meditating through it.
He would,
and you know,
he would say,

789
00:44:14.931 --> 00:44:18.350
I'm meditating through it.
It's so good.
And we were reframing.

790
00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:22.760
Cold cold was as a metaphor from something that uses you bounce away from,

791
00:44:22.761 --> 00:44:24.470
to something that you can learn to sit with,

792
00:44:24.471 --> 00:44:28.760
to be neutral and to find pleasure in just like the weather.

793
00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:31.980
And then we had this experience of the day where he said to me,
um,
you know,

794
00:44:31.981 --> 00:44:36.150
daddy will,
you tickled me slowly.
And I always took,
let me laughs.

795
00:44:36.151 --> 00:44:38.760
Uproariously but we were lying in bed and I was tickling me.
I'm very slowly,

796
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:41.940
and he was going to do my meditation.
He would meditate.
And then he said to me,

797
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.490
then the next day's a day that will,
you tickled me slowly.
And I did it.

798
00:44:44.491 --> 00:44:48.060
And he's like to pick up a little bit faster.
And I didn't suggest as the him,

799
00:44:48.061 --> 00:44:49.200
he said just it to me.

800
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.320
And then we played this game where we say one to 10 and I would tickle him

801
00:44:52.321 --> 00:44:56.790
slowly.
So doing his meditation and we move it from one,
two and we'd go up to,

802
00:44:56.791 --> 00:45:00.270
he would like we doing his meditation and finally I'd be full tilt tickling and

803
00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:04.600
you'd normally be in hysterics.
And he was just sitting there meditating,
um,

804
00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:05.693
and not laughing.

805
00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:09.030
And he found this so interesting and he's now guiding the process in this,

806
00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:12.870
in this beautiful way.
And now we're turning into talking about,
you know,

807
00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:14.310
question just to interject.

808
00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:19.311
Did you at any point condition him to be proactive in that way or was it just an

809
00:45:20.131 --> 00:45:22.720
organic,
now I'm in the driver's seat.

810
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:25.140
I encouraged them to grab the wheel all the time.
I mean,

811
00:45:25.141 --> 00:45:27.450
a huge part of my relationship to parenting,

812
00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:30.810
and this is from my mom and I watched my mom with Jack and I think this is maybe

813
00:45:30.811 --> 00:45:33.960
the greatest gift that my mom gave me is just having a sense of agency in the

814
00:45:33.961 --> 00:45:36.570
world.
You know,
the idea that,
you know,

815
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:41.280
the having a sense that I can impact the world,
right?

816
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:45.450
And that my,
that my compass really matters.
Or it's when I grew up,
I was,

817
00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:49.060
I wasn't seen but not heard.
I was familiar routes five and six years old.

818
00:45:49.061 --> 00:45:51.960
They're having adult conversations with friends and are,
and I was,

819
00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:55.080
I was part of it.
They wanted to hear my ideas and I felt that they mattered.

820
00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:58.650
And that's a big part of how I believe in my wife and I believe in raising
check.

821
00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:03.300
And so
he,
he,
um,

822
00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.420
he plays a really active role in everything that we do.

823
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:09.990
And so it was sort of a natural thing and it was all fun and play.

824
00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.270
I wasn't pushing any of these things on him at all.

825
00:46:12.271 --> 00:46:15.180
This is stuff that he wanted to do,
but then he,
him naturally,
I've been,

826
00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:19.110
I've been kind of blown away by how he's been transferring this stuff over.

827
00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:21.240
I mean lateral thinking or thematic thinking,

828
00:46:21.241 --> 00:46:23.730
the ability to take a lesson from one thing and transferred over to another.

829
00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:26.790
I think it was one of the most important disciplines that any of us can

830
00:46:26.791 --> 00:46:28.380
cultivate or,
or ways of being.

831
00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:31.410
And it's something that Jack and I have from a really young age.

832
00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:34.890
We began to cultivate this from when he was really smaller on this principle of

833
00:46:34.891 --> 00:46:39.480
goal around,
um,
we,
we,
we would,
we would initially,

834
00:46:39.481 --> 00:46:41.760
it was like the first thing that time happened is that he was trying,

835
00:46:41.761 --> 00:46:43.350
he was really tiny.
He was trying to get in.

836
00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:48.270
We're in a little cottage sing little cottage in,
uh,
in,
in,
um,

837
00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:51.210
on Martha's vineyard,
tiny little cottage in a big field.

838
00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:54.000
And he was trying to get in one door and he couldn't,

839
00:46:54.001 --> 00:46:56.640
but he could get in the other door.
And I said,
Jack,
go around.

840
00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:59.610
And he looked at me and then he went around and then go around,

841
00:46:59.611 --> 00:47:01.230
became a language for us physically.

842
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:02.700
If you can't go one way you go around another way.

843
00:47:02.701 --> 00:47:05.880
But then it became a language for us in terms of solving puzzles and in terms of

844
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:06.930
any way me,

845
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:09.900
you are running an obstacle goal around and then working with the metaphor of

846
00:47:09.901 --> 00:47:13.710
goal around opened up this way that we would just have dialogue around

847
00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:15.720
connecting things,
right?

848
00:47:15.721 --> 00:47:19.140
Taking away of a principal from one thing and applying it to something else.

849
00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:21.710
And we've had a lot of fun with that.
And so it's,

850
00:47:21.711 --> 00:47:24.060
it's fascinating to see you this game little dude,

851
00:47:24.061 --> 00:47:26.310
if you have this dramatic dialogue,

852
00:47:26.311 --> 00:47:29.950
principal driven dialogue and we're where I'm cultivating sematic awareness,

853
00:47:29.951 --> 00:47:30.310
cultivating

854
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:33.010
<v 3>the ability to feel these little ripples inside him.</v>

855
00:47:33.011 --> 00:47:37.180
And Jack's telling me his dreams in this beautiful way.
He tells me,
you know,

856
00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:40.540
how his emotions feel in his body.
Um,

857
00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:43.540
it's a great journey.
I'm learning so much from him.

858
00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:46.690
There's a book you've mentioned to me a number of times,

859
00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:48.700
or at the very least a researcher,

860
00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:53.680
and I'm probably going to mask or this name as well as the Carol Dweck,

861
00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:57.130
getting that right mindset,
Carol Dweck mindset.
Yeah,
yeah.

862
00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:00.850
Fixed an entity like fixed or entity theories of intelligence versus incremental

863
00:48:00.851 --> 00:48:02.480
or growth mindset.
It,
Carol Dweck,

864
00:48:02.481 --> 00:48:06.160
it's one of the most important foundational developmental psychologist I think

865
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:11.190
around around this distinction of a fixed perspective on how good somebody is.

866
00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.460
You know,
let's,
let's frame it like this.

867
00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:20.730
Most children unfortunately are educated to believe that they have a certain

868
00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:25.120
ingrained level of ability in things.
You are smart,
you are dumb,
you are average,

869
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:26.470
right?
And they're told,

870
00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:29.710
and the sad thing is that when they are [inaudible] w when even when they're

871
00:48:29.711 --> 00:48:33.580
praised,
they're told how smart they are,
right?
Or you're such a good writer,

872
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.760
right?
You're such a,
you're so good at math or,
and the kids will say,

873
00:48:36.761 --> 00:48:39.160
I'm smart at this or I'm dumb at that.
Right?
And so,

874
00:48:39.161 --> 00:48:43.150
but if you're a very smart at one thing,
then that means that if you fail,

875
00:48:43.151 --> 00:48:47.920
then you must be dumb at it.
And so it becomes very static,

876
00:48:48.130 --> 00:48:52.030
right?
W and the kids are often quite brittle when they have a fixed mindset,

877
00:48:52.031 --> 00:48:53.860
right?
Or an entity theory of intelligence.
Well,

878
00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.760
a growth mindset or mastery oriented mindset is one where we understand that our

879
00:48:57.850 --> 00:48:58.683
are,

880
00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:03.970
the path to mastery involves incremental growth,

881
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:08.320
right?
We were not,
we don't have an end grain level of ability.

882
00:49:08.321 --> 00:49:11.170
It's something we're going to have successes and failures.

883
00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:15.420
We're going to work at things.
And it's,
it's,
it's,
it's work,
it's practice.
Um,

884
00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:18.730
and it's an open mindedness to life experiences that makes us succeed.

885
00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.320
How would the praise differ?

886
00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:24.730
You would praise a kid for the process versus the outcome.
And so you would say,

887
00:49:24.731 --> 00:49:28.900
I'm so proud of how hard you worked at your math.
Not,
you're so smart at math.

888
00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.130
Right?
Or if someone,
if someone has a failure,
the other side of it is,

889
00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:35.950
is not to say that don't worry about it.
You're just not good at math.

890
00:49:35.951 --> 00:49:37.330
You'd lose something else.
It's to say,
well,

891
00:49:37.331 --> 00:49:39.220
how can we practice it this to get better?

892
00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:41.950
And so we're focusing on the process and not the outcome.

893
00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:47.200
That's the fundamental principle.
And it's so easy to,
um,
to say it,
but it's,

894
00:49:47.201 --> 00:49:49.600
it's very hard for people to,
to live it as parents,

895
00:49:49.601 --> 00:49:51.130
especially if they don't embody it themselves.

896
00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:55.090
What you see often with kids and parents is that the,
um,

897
00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.230
the parents are fundamentally fixed.

898
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:02.530
They have an entity theory of intelligence themselves.
They're fixed,

899
00:50:02.531 --> 00:50:03.310
they're stuck,

900
00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:07.030
but they've read the material of Carol Dweck or somebody else and they want to

901
00:50:07.031 --> 00:50:10.600
parent their kids around a growth mindset.
But the kids see what they embodied,

902
00:50:10.601 --> 00:50:12.940
not what they say.
So we have to embody it.
I mean,

903
00:50:12.941 --> 00:50:15.280
one of the most important things that we do,

904
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:18.790
I think that we do with my foundation,
um,
and our work with schools,

905
00:50:18.791 --> 00:50:21.970
with programs around the world is that we,
when we're working with teachers,

906
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.490
it's not just this is the material you should teach your students.

907
00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:27.920
It's working with these core principles and embodying it themselves first.

908
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:30.890
<v 2>And then,
um,
through that embodied intelligence,</v>

909
00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:34.340
working with the kids and how they can embody it,
you have to walk the talk.

910
00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:38.300
So let's,
let's go back to what you said.
She go back to at some point,

911
00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:40.250
which is somatic sensitivity,

912
00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:45.440
those sort of dimples of light in the darkness that most people overlook.

913
00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:50.900
Uh,
how do you train that?
Well,

914
00:50:50.901 --> 00:50:51.471
thematically,

915
00:50:51.471 --> 00:50:54.650
the first thing I would say is that is that we need to think about cultivating

916
00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:58.040
an internal locus of control or an internal orientation versus an external one,

917
00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:02.090
right?
So as an artist or performer,
we have all these external pressures on us.

918
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:03.560
Let's say for example,
again,

919
00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:07.220
let's talk about investors again or just say an investor is running,
uh,

920
00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:11.540
a $1 billion investment vehicle and they have partners,

921
00:51:11.541 --> 00:51:13.040
they have people who invest in that,
right?

922
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:15.620
And they have to write investment letters.
Um,

923
00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:19.370
they have all the partners say they have 30 or 40 or 50 partners who are

924
00:51:19.371 --> 00:51:22.580
institutions,
maybe endowments,
educational dominance,
charities,
whatever,

925
00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.970
who have put their money into this investment vehicle.

926
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:29.630
And maybe that person has zone money as well.

927
00:51:29.631 --> 00:51:33.500
Her own money in this investment vehicle.
Well,
for them to be successful,

928
00:51:33.501 --> 00:51:35.120
they have to operate from the inside out.

929
00:51:35.121 --> 00:51:38.440
They have to bring out the essence of who they are as a performer like we do.

930
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:42.470
We're discussing,
um,
or as a human being is to bring that up through their art.

931
00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:47.780
But if they are constantly feeling pressured by what others expect from them,

932
00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:51.560
what others want from them,
how they'll be perceived,
right.
Or you know,

933
00:51:51.561 --> 00:51:55.100
how people are looking at their Facebook post or how their tweet is being

934
00:51:55.101 --> 00:51:57.440
responded to.
Right.
It's tweet.
That's what it is.

935
00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:02.360
I mean,
it's so interesting for me,

936
00:52:02.361 --> 00:52:05.420
I like watching people watch their Instagram accounts,
right?

937
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:09.350
I see it with buddies with all the time.
It's natural.
It's,
it's completely human.

938
00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:13.220
But,
but then we're,
we're aware of how we're perceived.
Right.

939
00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:16.400
One of the major way reasons that I stay away from these things is because I can

940
00:52:16.401 --> 00:52:18.770
feel how susceptible I am to this stuff,
right?

941
00:52:18.771 --> 00:52:20.210
You publish a book and it's on Amazon.

942
00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:23.960
It's so hard not to go look at the Amazon numbers,
right?

943
00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:25.580
And then the bill comes out and you're tracking them.

944
00:52:25.581 --> 00:52:28.160
Even if you know it's ridiculous and you shouldn't be doing it now,

945
00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:31.630
someone like you,
you're still worldclass.
Um,

946
00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:35.420
and you've so systematically trained at and cultivated the ability to market

947
00:52:35.421 --> 00:52:37.970
these things.
This is actually a very important scientific input for you.

948
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:41.030
It's not for most authors.
Most authors is an addiction,
right?

949
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:42.620
So that's completely different point in my opinion.

950
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:45.750
You're actually gathering data and using it.
Most people are just,

951
00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:50.480
just constantly feeling,
um,
tapping the vein,
right?

952
00:52:50.481 --> 00:52:53.390
Tapping the vein.
So with investors with as often relates to as PNL,

953
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:55.400
checking profit and loss,
Chong.
Sure.
Right?

954
00:52:55.401 --> 00:52:58.940
So most investors check P and l hundreds of times a day.
In fact,

955
00:52:58.941 --> 00:53:00.890
it's constantly because it's on their screen all the time.

956
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:04.130
And so having these like little adrenal hits all the time,
right?

957
00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.800
Whether it's dopamine or cortisol,
whether they're making money or losing money,

958
00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:08.720
they're constantly bouncing off of these things.

959
00:53:08.721 --> 00:53:12.890
That's the ultimate external external orientation,
right?

960
00:53:12.891 --> 00:53:17.891
So if you think about about internal plus proactive versus external plus

961
00:53:18.441 --> 00:53:20.990
reactive,
this is how I would tend to frame this out.

962
00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:25.980
We want to build a proactive way of life that's fundamentally moved from the

963
00:53:25.981 --> 00:53:28.080
inside out versus a reactive way of light.

964
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.780
We're co lead for constantly reacting to all of these inputs,

965
00:53:30.781 --> 00:53:34.320
which we may or may not want.
Um,
and we're,

966
00:53:34.321 --> 00:53:37.350
we're constantly beleaguered by or oppressed by a sense of,

967
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:41.340
of how we're going to be perceived social pressures,
right?

968
00:53:41.341 --> 00:53:45.270
And so then you're talking about a really high level artist who might have a

969
00:53:45.271 --> 00:53:47.690
really subtle intuition about something,
um,

970
00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:50.340
and they should listen to that intuition or they should at least deconstructed

971
00:53:50.341 --> 00:53:53.670
intuition and investigate it and see if it's the right way to go.

972
00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:58.880
But they're aware that that intuition might not be perceived as impressive by

973
00:53:59.071 --> 00:54:02.880
others.
The problem is that the others usually aren't world class artists.

974
00:54:02.881 --> 00:54:04.950
They're the arms,
your professors there,
the philosophy ologists.

975
00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:09.810
And so you have the man in the arena whose compromised by a census of

976
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:14.010
consciousness of what the critics are going,

977
00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:16.200
how the critics are going to perceive him or her,

978
00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:21.030
which is ridiculous because it's like an a player thinking about how the

979
00:54:21.031 --> 00:54:24.660
approval of a c player and that's disastrous.
That's external orientation.

980
00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:26.610
That's like looking at,
you know,

981
00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:30.810
I mean s thinking that we have,

982
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:33.420
we're going to get food poisoning from something and something's off and I'm

983
00:54:33.421 --> 00:54:36.600
thinking and then dismissing it because of,
I mean,
first of all,

984
00:54:36.601 --> 00:54:41.310
there's the incredibly subtle sense is how strongly intuition is,
right?
I mean,

985
00:54:41.311 --> 00:54:44.240
I that no one else had that table there and we had some pretty high level dudes

986
00:54:44.241 --> 00:54:47.010
who on the table it had that feeling that that we,
we're about to eat something.

987
00:54:47.011 --> 00:54:49.920
I had food poisoning,
right?
So it's very subtle.
You had a very subtle sense.

988
00:54:49.921 --> 00:54:51.930
It wasn't bang you over the head.
Right.

989
00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.560
And then there's the feeling of the social pressures and everything,
right?

990
00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:59.400
It's a very interesting subtle example.
Yeah.
Right.
But it's the subtle pressures,

991
00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:02.040
pressures were louder in that case.

992
00:55:02.041 --> 00:55:04.230
And then like the really subtle intuition that you had.

993
00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:09.930
And then there's having the attitude of,
I don't care about the social pressures,

994
00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:11.790
but that's really hard.
Right.

995
00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:15.750
Which I was able to do a third of the way through it,
but not before.
Right.

996
00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:20.670
I think you're actually really,
you know,
and my observation,

997
00:55:20.671 --> 00:55:25.250
you were really evolved with this.
I mean,
w w w I mean,
I,

998
00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:28.920
um,
I mean you have so much external

999
00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:33.420
pressure and external awareness on you.

1000
00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:38.400
I'm consistently find it stunning and impressive how you're able to embrace your

1001
00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:42.030
funk had to live a life that is attuned to your kind of inner inner ripples.

1002
00:55:42.031 --> 00:55:43.950
I mean,
I think it's actually rather unique.

1003
00:55:43.951 --> 00:55:45.530
It's think it's a core strength of yours in my opinion.

1004
00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:51.350
<v 1>I think that one element that's been very helpful in trying to mitigate the</v>

1005
00:55:52.531 --> 00:55:56.490
risks and dangers in that,

1006
00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:04.740
in the sort of paradox of trying to be introspective while having a very public

1007
00:56:04.741 --> 00:56:08.460
facing life is stoicism.
And,
uh,

1008
00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:11.220
and I remember reading at one point,

1009
00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:16.590
I want to say it was Cato who is considered by his contemporaries and his

1010
00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:21.510
successors in a sort of stoic thought leadership to be the perfect stoic and a

1011
00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:25.390
lot of respects,
and I'm going to get the colors wrong here,
but he,

1012
00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:26.750
he would deliberately wait,

1013
00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:32.070
I think it was a Ballou tunic as opposed to a purple tunic to encourage people

1014
00:56:34.961 --> 00:56:38.650
to ridicule him because he wanted to be embarrassed about only those things

1015
00:56:38.651 --> 00:56:43.120
worth being embarrassed about.
So training himself not to be overly

1016
00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:48.790
sensitized to the critiques of the c players around him.

1017
00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:54.040
And so I constantly,
I remember for instance,
this is such a silly example,

1018
00:56:54.041 --> 00:56:56.240
but I was just in Montana,
uh,

1019
00:56:56.710 --> 00:57:00.280
and I went into the ski shop to get some,
some,

1020
00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:03.490
some light gloves just for walking around,
not for skiing.

1021
00:57:04.330 --> 00:57:07.150
And I looked at the whole rack and I'm like,
Ooh,
I like these.

1022
00:57:07.151 --> 00:57:09.460
And they were like the most ridiculous Dr Seuss,

1023
00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:12.400
like striped nonsense gloves you've ever seen.

1024
00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:15.550
Just like they will not match with anything.
Just ludicrous looking.

1025
00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:18.040
And I asked the woman at the front desk,
I'm like,

1026
00:57:18.041 --> 00:57:20.380
what do you think of these or should I get a different one?
She was like,
Nah,

1027
00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:23.320
I think you just get the black ones.
And I thought about it,
like I sat there,

1028
00:57:23.321 --> 00:57:25.640
I thought about it.
I was like,
Nope,
I'm getting the Dr Seuss clothes.

1029
00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:27.280
And so I got the top Sue's class.

1030
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:32.380
And that expresses itself for me in a lot of different places because I will for

1031
00:57:32.381 --> 00:57:36.340
instance,
to do,
and this is not something I recommend to everybody.
Uh,

1032
00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:38.560
so caveat emptor,
you can't be,
you know,

1033
00:57:38.590 --> 00:57:43.510
you're in control of your whole life on life.
Uh,
so if,
if you,

1034
00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:45.730
if you do this,
you can face some dire consequences,

1035
00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:50.940
but I'll do a drunk Q and A's on Facebook and I'll have a bunch of booze and

1036
00:57:51.461 --> 00:57:55.660
I'll go on and I'll do a Q and a.
Something will come out that will embarrass me,

1037
00:57:55.661 --> 00:57:57.640
but it's not going to be life destroying,

1038
00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:04.870
magically create an environment in which I feel like I don't have a reputation

1039
00:58:04.871 --> 00:58:08.210
to protect,
which is another reason why I talk about,
you know,

1040
00:58:08.211 --> 00:58:12.580
the psychedelics and I'll talk very openly about,
uh,
you know,

1041
00:58:12.581 --> 00:58:14.170
monogamy versus non monogamy.

1042
00:58:14.171 --> 00:58:17.260
And I'll throw these things out here to basically ensure a,

1043
00:58:17.261 --> 00:58:19.780
that I never became a politician and B,

1044
00:58:19.781 --> 00:58:24.550
that I don't feel like I have a fixed identity to cling to that I need to

1045
00:58:24.551 --> 00:58:29.410
protect because I see how disastrous that can be.
Yeah,

1046
00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.000
that's really,
that's really powerful.
And the,
you know,

1047
00:58:31.001 --> 00:58:34.150
the fire of competition plays that role as well.
I mean,

1048
00:58:34.151 --> 00:58:37.750
you look at people who compete.
Let's talk about martial artists.
So,

1049
00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:40.390
so I own a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu school as Marcelo Garcia.

1050
00:58:40.391 --> 00:58:44.860
We've discussed Marcel a lot.
Definitely.
And you'd just as mentioned,
uh,

1051
00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:50.130
creating chaos and train yourself to operate optimally in chaos compared to

1052
00:58:51.341 --> 00:58:54.640
others.
And of course,
Marcello is what,
10 time nighttime,

1053
00:58:54.641 --> 00:58:58.750
nine time world champion is the scramble.
Yeah.

1054
00:58:58.751 --> 00:59:00.940
They call him the king of the scrambled egg on the screen.
I mean he's the,

1055
00:59:00.941 --> 00:59:05.290
he's the greatest transitional player in the history of sport.
Maybe.
Um,

1056
00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:10.210
he's incredible.
I mean is,
is the essence of his game is to not hold,

1057
00:59:10.450 --> 00:59:15.450
to allow people to move and to again embrace the chaos and get their first,

1058
00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:16.900
his,
his,

1059
00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:21.410
he just has cultivated the transition so systematically that he has 10 in

1060
00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:22.130
transition where

1061
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:24.500
<v 2>somebody else will just be moving from one position to the next.</v>

1062
00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:27.710
Does that transition itself is something which is like,
that's his ocean.

1063
00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:30.290
It's a beautiful thing to see.
But if you look at the school,

1064
00:59:30.291 --> 00:59:33.630
Marcel runs a school so beautifully and we've got at this point,
um,

1065
00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:34.970
a lot of world class competitors,

1066
00:59:34.971 --> 00:59:37.950
a lot of school tends to win pretty much all the tournaments.

1067
00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:39.830
A lot of the guys who you've trained with,
um,

1068
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.940
<v 1>with the Tim Ferriss experiment,
that was hilarious.
Oh my God was awesome.</v>

1069
00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:46.020
We got day one.
I'm like,
okay,
I think I broke my ribs.

1070
00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:52.620
He did great man.
You did great.
That was Pratty.
Um,
yeah,
that you guys,

1071
00:59:52.621 --> 00:59:54.720
you just check that out.
That was pretty pretty.
The TV show.

1072
00:59:54.721 --> 00:59:57.150
If you want to see me get my ass handed to me,
uh,

1073
00:59:57.180 --> 01:00:00.720
and have a great time training with guys like John Tava,

1074
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:04.630
who's an incredible athlete and teacher John is fantastic.

1075
01:00:04.631 --> 01:00:06.710
It's a TV show where checking out but I'm not,

1076
01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.950
<v 2>well,
if you look at the learning curve of the people in the school,</v>

1077
01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:12.880
the ones who put themselves in the line as a way of life just learn much faster

1078
01:00:12.881 --> 01:00:16.000
than the ones who are protecting their egos,
right?
Most schools,

1079
01:00:16.001 --> 01:00:21.001
what happens if someone gets good and then they have to win to PR to protect

1080
01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:26.050
their status as being very good or dominant usually happens with martial arts

1081
01:00:26.051 --> 01:00:30.550
instructors,
which is that they reach a certain level.
Um,
they opened a school,

1082
01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:34.450
they get a little bit older,
you know,
they get a little fatter.
Um,

1083
01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.291
they have a reputation,

1084
01:00:35.291 --> 01:00:37.540
so they stopped trainings that ought to be exposed by the young students who are

1085
01:00:37.541 --> 01:00:39.760
coming up and they sit in the sideline,

1086
01:00:39.790 --> 01:00:44.440
but they'd get their egos get increasingly large,
but riddled with insecurity.

1087
01:00:44.441 --> 01:00:48.580
And this Brittleness tends to then splay down to the students in the whole

1088
01:00:48.581 --> 01:00:51.490
school becomes a joke,
right?
Versus,
you know,
Marcello,

1089
01:00:51.491 --> 01:00:53.560
the way Marcella runs our school is so magnificent.

1090
01:00:53.561 --> 01:00:57.250
Everyone's in the mat training so hard as a way of life.
Um,

1091
01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:58.840
everyone's on a worldclass growth curve.

1092
01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:03.820
And it's very interesting to observe who the top competitors pick out when

1093
01:01:03.821 --> 01:01:07.150
they're five rounds into the sparring sessions.
And they're completely gassed.

1094
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:10.000
The ones who are in the CBEST growth curve,
look for the hardest guy.

1095
01:01:10.001 --> 01:01:12.160
They're the one who beat him up,
who,

1096
01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:14.830
who might beat him up while others will look for someone that can take a break

1097
01:01:14.831 --> 01:01:19.270
on.
Right?
And so there's that constant search for exposure.

1098
01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:20.591
And if you,
and that's,

1099
01:01:20.591 --> 01:01:23.200
that's kind of a parallel to what you're describing in terms of not having an

1100
01:01:23.201 --> 01:01:26.440
ego to protect your or,
or a or a,
um,

1101
01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:32.050
you said not having,
uh,
yeah,
reputation to protect fixed identity,

1102
01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.640
to protect,
right.
So this is the way,

1103
01:01:33.641 --> 01:01:36.190
as a competitor to constantly put yourself into the fire.

1104
01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:40.810
<v 1>Here's a question I have for you because I feel like particularly in Jujitsu,</v>

1105
01:01:40.811 --> 01:01:41.680
I can get better at this.

1106
01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:46.000
You remember when we did that one day we'd had the key on and you're like,
Timbo,

1107
01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:49.150
your lips were purple.
I thought it was going to die.

1108
01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:54.430
I thought I was gonna have a heat stroke and have to be carted off.
But the,
uh,

1109
01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:58.810
do the guys,
so is it correlation or causation?

1110
01:01:58.811 --> 01:02:03.550
Meaning are the guys who,
who on round five pick the hardest guy in the room,

1111
01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:09.330
have they already self selected by coming to this school in a sense or have the,

1112
01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.850
did they start off perhaps when they walked in the door,

1113
01:02:12.851 --> 01:02:17.260
the guy who would pick the easiest person in the room at round five and have

1114
01:02:17.261 --> 01:02:19.770
been converted into the guy

1115
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:24.180
<v 2>who will pick the hardest person to both.
You see the boats in the latter case.</v>

1116
01:02:25.050 --> 01:02:28.440
How do they cultivate that transition?

1117
01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.410
I think that Marcella was a great role model.
I think it's a good,
I mean,

1118
01:02:31.411 --> 01:02:33.960
that's a fantastic metaphor for life,
right?
I mean this is,

1119
01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:37.270
you need lists everywhere.
Hundred percent.
I mean,
I think that,
you know,

1120
01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:39.430
we think about this,
this principle of cultivating qualities,

1121
01:02:39.431 --> 01:02:41.910
the way of life and the big things and little things and you,

1122
01:02:41.911 --> 01:02:45.390
you look at the way Marcello runs that,
that training environment is,

1123
01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:46.970
is pretty exceptional.
I mean,

1124
01:02:46.971 --> 01:02:49.500
if people don't have the police on his ass on the line all the time,

1125
01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:53.370
his ass is on the line all the time.
Um,
and he's,
you know,

1126
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.980
he's getting a little bit older.
He's,
um,

1127
01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:59.900
he has two kids and he's a wonderful dad.
Um,

1128
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.860
is life is not just 100% should sue anymore.
Um,
he has all of these,

1129
01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:08.070
you know,
young 20s at this point.

1130
01:03:08.071 --> 01:03:10.710
Worldclass students who want to go at it hard with him and he goes out of

1131
01:03:10.711 --> 01:03:13.920
hardwood them and he wants to,
he doesn't mind getting exposed to you,
brings it.

1132
01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:16.080
He doesn't,
he's,
he's living it.

1133
01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.140
But he's also creating an environment where people are present to quality in

1134
01:03:19.141 --> 01:03:22.350
little things.
If someone is,
it doesn't have their [inaudible] on straight.

1135
01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.560
If they haven't tied their belt,
if they're sitting in a way that sloppy,

1136
01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:28.990
what happens does he tells them to straighten their game?
I love that.

1137
01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:32.300
I love that when people are running,
are doing the warmup.

1138
01:03:32.310 --> 01:03:35.070
If they're cutting the corner a little bit,
he tells him to run the full circle.

1139
01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:38.930
If people are doing a certain drill in a sloppy way,
he refines it.
So it's the,

1140
01:03:38.931 --> 01:03:40.830
it's,
it's the little things,
right?

1141
01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:43.320
And so as you watch Marcello doing the warm up,

1142
01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:46.170
there was a way that he'll have his hand and just brush against the mat as he

1143
01:03:46.171 --> 01:03:50.940
passes it.
Like you can feel him engaging his tactile feeling for the room.
Right.

1144
01:03:51.590 --> 01:03:52.500
You know,
when you,

1145
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:56.610
he's someone who embodies and teaches qualities way of life.

1146
01:03:56.611 --> 01:03:59.730
So if you're in your fourth and fifth round and you are looking for a way out,

1147
01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:02.850
you feel that you're fundamentally violating this principle,

1148
01:04:02.851 --> 01:04:07.770
which you've been cultivating a tentative the school.
Right?
And,

1149
01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:09.330
and you know,
this is,
this is so important.

1150
01:04:09.331 --> 01:04:14.331
We think about a core part of how I train people is around the interplay of

1151
01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:17.980
themes or principles and habits,
right?

1152
01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.640
The habits are what we can actually train at that,
the principles,

1153
01:04:20.641 --> 01:04:21.510
what we're trying to embody.

1154
01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.870
And so we'll train it two or three or four or five habits,

1155
01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:27.030
which are the embodiment of a core principle.

1156
01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:29.430
But the idea is to burn the principal into the hundreds of manifestations of

1157
01:04:29.431 --> 01:04:32.520
that principle become our way of life.
Right?
And so in this case,

1158
01:04:32.521 --> 01:04:36.390
we're talking about Marcella talking about or embodying the principle of quality

1159
01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.480
in all these little ways,
these little ways you could say don't matter,

1160
01:04:39.481 --> 01:04:42.360
but they add up to,
to matter hugely.
Oh,

1161
01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:44.450
I think the little things are the big things.
Yeah.

1162
01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:47.070
Because there are a reflection,
I mean,
this might sound cliche,

1163
01:04:47.071 --> 01:04:50.150
but it's like how you do anything is how you do everything.
Right.
And,
uh,

1164
01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:54.330
it's such a,
it's such a beautiful and critical principle and,
and we don't,

1165
01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:58.380
most people think they can wait around for the big moments to turn it on,

1166
01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:01.200
but if you don't cultivate turning it on as a way of life,

1167
01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:02.160
the little moments there's,

1168
01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:06.390
and there's hundreds of times more little moments than big and there's no chance

1169
01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:07.980
in the big moments that,
okay,

1170
01:05:07.981 --> 01:05:11.370
so if people listening don't take anything else from this interview,

1171
01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:15.010
I think that's so key to who you are.

1172
01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:17.680
It's so key to why you've been good at what been good at.

1173
01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:22.080
<v 1>That's it right there.
And,
uh,
there's a,
I'm going to hear,</v>

1174
01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:25.060
let me mangle another name since that seems to be one of our themes for the
show.

1175
01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.780
This episode is,
I think it's archaeal locusts are kilocalories.

1176
01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:33.580
Perhaps I'm going to get this wrong,
but it was a quote gotta be a Roman,

1177
01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:39.040
maybe a Greek,
who knows,
uh,
who said,
we do not raise the level of our hopes.

1178
01:05:39.041 --> 01:05:41.200
We fall to the level of our training.
Yeah.

1179
01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:47.040
And if you can't just do one every five years waiting for the big event,

1180
01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:50.730
you're not going to have the training necessary.
Essentially

1181
01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:54.180
<v 2>it,
you know,
as a principal that I've been thinking about a lot around parenting,</v>

1182
01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:55.920
you know,
we,

1183
01:05:55.970 --> 01:06:00.970
you see so often people with their second child are not as present right now.

1184
01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:04.560
Unfortunately in today's world,

1185
01:06:04.561 --> 01:06:07.080
people are often not present with their first child either.
I was,

1186
01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:12.140
I was taking a walk yesterday with a dear friend of mine in central park and at

1187
01:06:12.301 --> 01:06:14.100
dusk we were just talking about other ideas we've been,

1188
01:06:14.130 --> 01:06:17.520
we've been thinking about and we walked past this woman who was,

1189
01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:19.680
had three children in,

1190
01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:24.870
in a stroller and was walking her dog and the children were all talking to her

1191
01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:29.520
and she was on the cell phone having a conversation with a friend.
Um,

1192
01:06:29.550 --> 01:06:30.510
and it wasn't like a quick,

1193
01:06:30.511 --> 01:06:33.810
it was like a long gossipy conversation and I was just watching this exquisite

1194
01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:36.690
external environment,
like the embodiment of distraction,

1195
01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:41.280
three children and a dog.
Like the children,
like looking,
trying to pull her,

1196
01:06:41.281 --> 01:06:42.960
but she was just in this other world,
right?

1197
01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:46.680
We think what the distraction of parenting and then you think about what often

1198
01:06:46.681 --> 01:06:51.070
happens with parents,
with the first child,
they're completely tapped in.
Um,

1199
01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:54.840
cause this is all new.
They're present.
And the second child they just,
um,

1200
01:06:55.890 --> 01:06:58.560
well relatively neglect.
We see that all the time.
Right.

1201
01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.070
I'm thinking of this luck as it were about to have our second child.
And so I'm,

1202
01:07:01.071 --> 01:07:01.710
I'm,

1203
01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:05.550
I'm thinking about like how important it is to not take for granted the things

1204
01:07:05.551 --> 01:07:08.800
that you've done right.
And think they'll just be there.
Um,

1205
01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:12.660
because they're not going to be there as in this your present,
equally present.

1206
01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:13.740
Right.
We think about,

1207
01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:18.210
and we see this in the martial arts as someone who trains twice a day,
you know,

1208
01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.780
as a way of life for 10 years,
you know,

1209
01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:24.180
training until they drop and doing external training as well with strength and

1210
01:07:24.181 --> 01:07:25.920
conditioning and stretching everything else.

1211
01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:29.520
And then they get to a place where they're consistently winning and then they

1212
01:07:29.521 --> 01:07:33.120
think they can train,
you know,
seven times a week instead of 10.

1213
01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:37.470
And it'll be the same.
It's not the same like that slip.

1214
01:07:37.471 --> 01:07:38.330
It shows there's something,

1215
01:07:38.331 --> 01:07:41.790
there's something incredible about going into competition knowing that there's

1216
01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:46.710
no way that anyone else trained as hard or as good as you as smart.

1217
01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:50.150
Right.
So one other than what training quantitatively,

1218
01:07:50.151 --> 01:07:54.360
but they were trained training qualitatively.
Right.
Um,

1219
01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:57.900
the confidence that comes out of knowing whether in any discipline that your

1220
01:07:57.901 --> 01:08:00.990
head that you gave it your all,
yeah,
when I work with someone I say that,

1221
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:01.470
you know,

1222
01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:05.910
one of my many filters is looking at someone in the eye and saying that working

1223
01:08:05.911 --> 01:08:06.690
with me is,

1224
01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:10.440
is living as if you're training qualitatively as if in a world champion training

1225
01:08:10.441 --> 01:08:12.690
camp,
I'm qualitatively,

1226
01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.820
but I look at them in the eye and some people you see a fear,

1227
01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:18.980
you see the fear of exposure.
Other people you see a lean in an eagerness,
a game,

1228
01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:23.270
a hunger for what that exposure will lead to,
right.
As are two very,

1229
01:08:23.271 --> 01:08:25.460
very different paths.
Um,

1230
01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:31.070
maintaining presence to,
to that quality.
Right?
Even after we've,

1231
01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:33.080
we've assumed that we've got it now.
Right.

1232
01:08:33.081 --> 01:08:35.750
You see this with people or on presence.
Right.
You see,

1233
01:08:35.751 --> 01:08:39.860
there's so much bullshit in the meditation world,
for example,

1234
01:08:39.861 --> 01:08:43.220
last so much bullshit because people might have meditated wonderfully for four

1235
01:08:43.221 --> 01:08:45.140
or five years or six years or eight years and years,

1236
01:08:45.141 --> 01:08:48.290
but then they get ego involved with it and then they put together their schools

1237
01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:52.130
and they're,
you know,
they're not embodying it anymore.
Right.

1238
01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:56.100
And then it becomes hollow and,
um,
they've,

1239
01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:59.660
they kind of slipped from the philosophers of the philosopher Ologists um,

1240
01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:02.810
without even knowing that it happened.
They weren't even present to the question

1241
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:09.200
firewalking process.
Yeah.
That's important.

1242
01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:11.930
What is the firewalking process?
This is new to me too.

1243
01:09:11.931 --> 01:09:14.780
I'm not sure I've heard you discuss this.
Yeah.

1244
01:09:14.781 --> 01:09:18.770
This is something I've been really for the last year and a half or so developing

1245
01:09:18.771 --> 01:09:22.250
intensely.
I think it's been a core part of my process for a long time,

1246
01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:24.170
but training people,
I've been,

1247
01:09:24.230 --> 01:09:26.600
I've been on this really intense learning curve and how to work with people on

1248
01:09:26.601 --> 01:09:29.720
this.
So the,
the core to the principle is that,

1249
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:34.990
that people tend to learn from their own experiences with much more potency than

1250
01:09:36.351 --> 01:09:38.210
they learned from other people's experiences.
Right?

1251
01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:42.210
And the firewalking processes is it,
that's what I call as,

1252
01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:47.250
that's my term for a gateway to cultivating the ability to learn with the same

1253
01:09:48.981 --> 01:09:51.950
physiological intensity from other people's experiences as,

1254
01:09:51.951 --> 01:09:53.360
as we learned from our own.
So for example,

1255
01:09:53.361 --> 01:09:58.340
if you're a Jujitsu fighter and you slightly overextend your arm and you get

1256
01:09:58.341 --> 01:10:01.070
onboard and let's say wound jawless in the world championships,
right?

1257
01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:03.370
Your arm is being separated from your body,
right?
You're,

1258
01:10:03.371 --> 01:10:05.900
you feel like your shoulders disconnecting,
your arms breaking.
If you don't tap,

1259
01:10:05.901 --> 01:10:06.351
you're going to break.

1260
01:10:06.351 --> 01:10:09.050
So you have the cup combination and oftentimes we'll fight it,
right?

1261
01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:12.290
They won't want to tap into the world.
So the combination of,

1262
01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:17.450
of huge disappointment,
all the,

1263
01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:22.720
the adrenal reactions to being caught and having been wounded and maybe torn

1264
01:10:23.511 --> 01:10:24.770
ligaments or tendons,
right?

1265
01:10:24.771 --> 01:10:28.580
Depending on how the injury sets in or maybe a bone and they will burn that

1266
01:10:28.581 --> 01:10:30.980
lesson to themselves and they will not over extend their arm that way again.

1267
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:33.920
Right?
That's been burned in on an animalistic level.

1268
01:10:34.190 --> 01:10:37.060
But if they watch somebody fighting and then watch them over extending,

1269
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:38.450
get cotton on bar,
that's just like nothing.

1270
01:10:38.451 --> 01:10:41.000
That's an intellectual knowledge that that has no impact on whether or not

1271
01:10:41.001 --> 01:10:41.834
they'll over extent.

1272
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:45.770
But if we can cultivate the ability to learn from other people's errors or

1273
01:10:45.771 --> 01:10:50.270
experiences with the same intensity as we can learn from our own,

1274
01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.580
it's unbelievable how that can step in the learning learning curve.

1275
01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:58.090
What would be an example of that beyond Jujitsu?
Well,
for example,

1276
01:10:58.091 --> 01:11:01.010
a really interesting live example that I'm playing with,
um,

1277
01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:05.750
today is that we were working actively with investors.

1278
01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:08.870
Um,
is that,
you know,
we are

1279
01:11:10.650 --> 01:11:14.920
a brilliant investor.
Um,
recently used the term,
um,

1280
01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:19.020
the Pavlovian impact or the Pavlo Pavlovian influences have grown up in a bull

1281
01:11:19.021 --> 01:11:23.100
market,
right?
So most investors,
most relatively young investors,

1282
01:11:23.101 --> 01:11:27.570
grew up in a post 2008 world.
So all of their subtle,

1283
01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:32.040
you know,
responses have come from growing up in a bull market.

1284
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:34.140
So for the most part,
they've been,

1285
01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:36.960
they've experienced pleasure when they put the foot on the gas and they've

1286
01:11:36.961 --> 01:11:39.570
experienced pain when the taking the foot off the gas for the most part,

1287
01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:41.730
it's oversimplified.
Um,

1288
01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:45.930
it's really interesting to sit down and think about all of the cognitive biases.

1289
01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:48.780
They,
all of the subtle associations that come with growing up in a bull market.

1290
01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:51.840
Now traditionally what people will say is you have to live through certain

1291
01:11:51.841 --> 01:11:54.150
business cycles.
You have to,
you have to the school of hard knocks,
right?

1292
01:11:54.151 --> 01:11:56.280
We have to learn from the pain of the other side.

1293
01:11:56.850 --> 01:12:01.850
But can you take a relatively highly talented young investor who has grown up in

1294
01:12:01.981 --> 01:12:06.730
a bull market and give them the wisdom that you think about the journey from pre

1295
01:12:06.731 --> 01:12:09.510
consciousness to post consciousness competitor around a certain theme,

1296
01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:14.190
give them the wisdom of living through many market cycles when they haven't,

1297
01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:15.181
right?

1298
01:12:15.181 --> 01:12:19.260
So then you can deconstruct systematically what does a bear market look like?

1299
01:12:19.261 --> 01:12:21.330
Now,
I'm not sure where for in the beginning of a bear market now,

1300
01:12:21.331 --> 01:12:23.370
but let's just say that we are,

1301
01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:26.790
we are maybe in the first or second inning of a bear market.

1302
01:12:26.791 --> 01:12:31.200
Now maybe we're in the tail like the eighth or ninth innings of a bull market.

1303
01:12:31.530 --> 01:12:34.020
Maybe we're in the ninth inning of a bull market and we're going to see some

1304
01:12:34.021 --> 01:12:36.990
huge round of intervention and we're going to go into extra innings of the bull

1305
01:12:36.991 --> 01:12:40.440
market,
right?
No one really knows.
Maybe there's some other dynamic at play.
Um,

1306
01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:44.160
you know,
even the great macroeconomic economists don't know,
but we,

1307
01:12:44.161 --> 01:12:48.300
they have a sense through deep study of either macroeconomics or valuation.
Um,

1308
01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:51.360
but we are at one point some day relatively soon,

1309
01:12:51.361 --> 01:12:53.850
we'll probably enter a bear market.
So it's going to be very important,
right?

1310
01:12:54.150 --> 01:12:55.230
And so we haven't lived through on,

1311
01:12:55.290 --> 01:12:59.010
one thing you can do is you can deconstruct what a bear market looks like and

1312
01:12:59.011 --> 01:13:02.640
you can have them firewalk it.
And so what that means is,
is suddenly all of the,

1313
01:13:03.190 --> 01:13:05.490
um,
and a bear market doesn't just mean going down.

1314
01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:10.460
It actually means the subtle undulation of going is often going down,
you know,

1315
01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:14.130
for three weeks and then a really steep two week rally and then going down again

1316
01:13:14.131 --> 01:13:15.120
for three weeks and two weeks ago.

1317
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:19.440
So people often even bear people who are bettering think the market will go
down,

1318
01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:22.390
get really hurt and bear markets,
right?
Because it's violent.
It's,

1319
01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:24.780
it's there's a volatility to all facilities.
Yeah.
Right?

1320
01:13:25.170 --> 01:13:27.990
And so the question is how can,
in this case,

1321
01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:32.340
an investor who's grown up in a post 2008 world,
um,

1322
01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:36.030
firewalk market cycles so that he can burn that wisdom into himself or herself.

1323
01:13:36.690 --> 01:13:38.760
And then the,
the question is how you do this,
right?

1324
01:13:38.761 --> 01:13:41.820
And so there's a lot of the things that we discussed,
um,

1325
01:13:43.050 --> 01:13:47.310
around,
around,
um,

1326
01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:50.790
physiological awareness,
right?
Somatic awareness,

1327
01:13:50.791 --> 01:13:53.550
cultivating the sensitivity that what's happening inside of us,
right?

1328
01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:58.500
What comes with that is the ability to switch state emotionally adrenally.

1329
01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:03.110
And so if we visualize something very painful to us,
we can have the physio.

1330
01:14:03.230 --> 01:14:04.890
If visualize with tremendous potency,

1331
01:14:04.891 --> 01:14:07.740
we can have a physiological response to that.
Right?
True.

1332
01:14:07.741 --> 01:14:12.130
Even of exercise training people who say take a 10 meditation

1333
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:16.920
<v 1>visualization session in lieu of,
Oh,
there we go.
All right.
I mean it's,</v>

1334
01:14:16.921 --> 01:14:18.790
we have to go pick up Jack.
We just gonna go pick up Jack,

1335
01:14:18.791 --> 01:14:23.791
but they can get the benefits of the exercise in large part just from the

1336
01:14:23.831 --> 01:14:25.150
visualization over 10 minutes.

1337
01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.660
But we have to go grab Jack and well to be continued to be continued.
Awesome.

1338
01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:35.020
Okay.
So we're back.
We were back,

1339
01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:39.220
reclaimed the boy from school eight,

1340
01:14:39.221 --> 01:14:44.221
some Japanese food talked about life and now here we are for the continuation

1341
01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:50.140
firewalking digitalization.
We're going to talk about casts.

1342
01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.380
Let's continue with firewalking.

1343
01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:58.010
<v 3>Yes,
you were just bringing up the,
um,</v>

1344
01:14:58.310 --> 01:15:03.310
the physical dynamics that are possible with intense visualization.

1345
01:15:03.710 --> 01:15:07.730
Right.
I had this,
this formative experience I wrote about years ago where I

1346
01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:14.100
broke my hand seven weeks before national championship when I was training in

1347
01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:19.110
Chinese martial arts,
um,
push hands and I was in a cast for six weeks,
um,

1348
01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:23.060
up until I think three days before the nationals.

1349
01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:26.510
And the DOC said I couldn't compete in everything.
Everything's be atrophied.

1350
01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:26.890
But I,

1351
01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:29.750
but I was committed to doing it and it was really interesting cause I was just

1352
01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:34.130
doing all of my training one handed and visualizing the weight work that I was

1353
01:15:34.131 --> 01:15:37.430
doing on the one side passing over to the other,
the weight work,

1354
01:15:37.490 --> 01:15:39.470
late work assistance trading.
Yeah.
I was doing some work.
I was,

1355
01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:41.310
I was doing my martial arts training one handed,

1356
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:44.090
which was fascinating on its own to just work on being able to do with one hand

1357
01:15:44.091 --> 01:15:45.380
what you can do it too.
That was tremendous.

1358
01:15:45.381 --> 01:15:50.240
But I was also visualizing the steroid resistance training I was doing on one

1359
01:15:50.241 --> 01:15:54.110
side passing over to the other and um,
but really intense visualization,

1360
01:15:54.111 --> 01:15:55.850
not just like thinking it but burning it in.

1361
01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:58.700
It's kind of when I explained my firewalking the distinction between the kind of

1362
01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:03.350
thinking about intellectually sort of trying to visualize it and then or versus

1363
01:16:03.351 --> 01:16:07.610
burning it in with every sort of sensory stimulation.
Yeah.

1364
01:16:07.611 --> 01:16:11.530
Like with your whole like spirit burning it in deeply.
Um,

1365
01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:12.460
and it was fascinating to see when,

1366
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:16.210
when I took off the cast I had basically not atrophied and I competed the next

1367
01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:18.890
two,
two days,
three days later in one of the doctors.

1368
01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:20.360
I mean they were pretty surprised by it.

1369
01:16:20.570 --> 01:16:24.110
A lot of western medicine is pretty sure rise by close minded about these kinds

1370
01:16:24.111 --> 01:16:25.190
of things.
What

1371
01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:31.600
<v 1>would you do to translate that to something less?</v>

1372
01:16:31.601 --> 01:16:32.740
Obviously physical,

1373
01:16:32.770 --> 01:16:36.130
like we were talking about training people who've never been through bear
market,

1374
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.761
right?

1375
01:16:36.761 --> 01:16:41.761
To have the wisdom or the lessons learned of those who have been through.

1376
01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:44.860
So pragmatically,
how do you stimulate that?

1377
01:16:44.861 --> 01:16:48.580
Do you have them interview someone who's gone through it and then try to relive

1378
01:16:48.581 --> 01:16:52.510
those stories through visualization or what would the pro the process

1379
01:16:52.511 --> 01:16:54.870
potentially look like?
Yeah.
So you just,
so

1380
01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:58.700
<v 3>cultivation of empathy to be able to do what you just described very deeply is</v>

1381
01:16:58.701 --> 01:17:00.710
one thing to be able to,
oh,
you know,
to,

1382
01:17:00.711 --> 01:17:04.280
to live someone else's experience profoundly.
Um,
first of all,

1383
01:17:04.281 --> 01:17:07.730
we have to really be clear about the distinction between intellectual knowledge

1384
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:09.410
and somatic knowledge.
Right?

1385
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:14.750
When we've having something burned in,
there's an adrenal response,
right?

1386
01:17:14.751 --> 01:17:17.270
So there's a physiology to having an experience very intensely.

1387
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:20.850
We have to learn how to create that physiology,
right?
So I had an unjust,

1388
01:17:20.851 --> 01:17:23.270
so we can do biofeedback training,
um,

1389
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:27.590
undulating between states of physiological coherence in states of extreme stress

1390
01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:30.330
so that we,
we build up the ability to,

1391
01:17:30.331 --> 01:17:34.600
to kind of move between them at will and then when we're studying,
um,

1392
01:17:36.230 --> 01:17:36.711
for example,

1393
01:17:36.711 --> 01:17:41.711
the experience of somebody getting burned extremely intensely time and again in

1394
01:17:41.781 --> 01:17:46.580
a bull market,
I'm in a bear market,
um,
during the volatility,

1395
01:17:46.581 --> 01:17:49.100
the ups and downs of a bear market,
right?
You,
you can,

1396
01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:52.610
you can look at it and it can feel like,
um,
you know,

1397
01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:56.270
just like a chart or you can experience the anxiety that comes with it.

1398
01:17:56.660 --> 01:17:57.560
The pain that comes with it,

1399
01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.460
the like the shattering of your previous conceptual scheme,
right?

1400
01:18:01.670 --> 01:18:06.670
You can almost be almost firewalk the experience of the Pavlov Pavlovian

1401
01:18:07.011 --> 01:18:09.950
influence of growing up in a bull market.
And then having that shattered,

1402
01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:13.790
you could fire walk that shattering and then open your mind to the path to the

1403
01:18:13.791 --> 01:18:17.390
reality of the broader cyclicality over the long term.
Um,

1404
01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:21.320
and there's a lot of,
I mean,
in terms of how you do it.
Well,

1405
01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:23.960
I mean this is the foundation is in a lot of things we've been discussing,
right?

1406
01:18:23.961 --> 01:18:26.210
Intense Meditation Training,
um,

1407
01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:29.570
ways of becoming increasingly attuned to the subtle ripples inside your body,

1408
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:33.170
stilling your waters,
having a lifestyle which is less reactive,

1409
01:18:33.171 --> 01:18:35.210
less input addicted,
um,

1410
01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:40.700
being really aware of how we fill space addictively in life.

1411
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:43.040
Um,
whenever there's empty space,

1412
01:18:43.041 --> 01:18:44.990
we just fill it as opposed to maintaining the emptiness.

1413
01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:49.220
And the emptiness is where we have the clarity of mind and the perception of,

1414
01:18:49.221 --> 01:18:53.420
of these little micro ripples inside of us.
Um,
cultivating the ability to,

1415
01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:58.760
to observe in us and others like the subtlest undulations of quality or a

1416
01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:04.740
physiology.
Will you and I talk a lot about maintaining slack?
Yeah.

1417
01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:05.370
Trying to

1418
01:19:05.370 --> 01:19:10.080
<v 1>build slack into the system.
And how important that is.</v>

1419
01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:13.770
And I was told by someone I respect a lot recently.

1420
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:16.390
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1421
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:19.090
<v 1>Find the silence because you have to listen from the silence.</v>

1422
01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:24.940
And that might sound very uh,
vague,

1423
01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:28.830
but I found that if you really meditate on it and immutable,

1424
01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:30.580
it can apply to just about anything.
I mean,

1425
01:19:30.581 --> 01:19:32.650
if you really want to separate the signal from the noise,

1426
01:19:32.651 --> 01:19:35.410
you need the space to do that.

1427
01:19:38.430 --> 01:19:39.263
<v 4>Right.</v>

1428
01:19:39.710 --> 01:19:42.680
<v 3>It's such an important principle.
All right,</v>

1429
01:19:42.681 --> 01:19:45.650
we're going to take a baby town.

1430
01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:48.380
Jack is up from his nap

1431
01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:54.500
and her back to your regular programming.
Joshua,

1432
01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:00.710
we're talking about slack while this lack is expiring in the system here,

1433
01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:07.010
very impassioned to cries from upstairs.

1434
01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:13.260
Yeah.
Our,
our aim today was to do this in the morning while I'm at,
well,

1435
01:20:13.290 --> 01:20:18.000
Jack was in school.
I'm
fortunate.

1436
01:20:18.001 --> 01:20:22.410
Intervened.
Yeah.
Shutterfly plans.
Yes.
You know,
this,
this principle of slack,

1437
01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:25.500
um,
is a,
is is so interesting.

1438
01:20:25.501 --> 01:20:30.390
I mean for me a lot of it relates to the empty space for the learning process,

1439
01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:34.050
right?
Like in my,
in my way of life,
I'm,
I mean,

1440
01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:38.940
I've built a life around having empty space for the development of my ideas for

1441
01:20:38.941 --> 01:20:42.720
the creative process and for the cultivation of a physiological state,

1442
01:20:42.721 --> 01:20:45.570
which is receptive enough to,
to attune,
to tune in very,

1443
01:20:45.571 --> 01:20:50.490
very deeply to people,
right?
The people I work with.
Um,

1444
01:20:50.970 --> 01:20:52.470
and so like,
I can see how I could,

1445
01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:55.440
I could triple the amount of people that I work with,
um,

1446
01:20:55.650 --> 01:21:00.000
very easily with the systems that I have,
but my growth curve would get much.

1447
01:21:00.210 --> 01:21:04.560
Um,
I mean,
it would,
it would change fundamentally.
Um,

1448
01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:09.060
and my internal physiological training would,
would take a hit,
right?

1449
01:21:09.061 --> 01:21:11.940
I wouldn't have enough time for meditation,
for reflection afterwards,

1450
01:21:11.941 --> 01:21:13.740
for developments of,
of the,

1451
01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:17.900
kind of the thematic takeaways of every session that I have.
Um,

1452
01:21:18.510 --> 01:21:21.060
and the creative process.
It's so easy to,
to,
to,

1453
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:26.040
to drive for efficiency and take for granted,
um,

1454
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:29.370
the really subtle internal work that it takes to

1455
01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:32.800
<v 1>play on that razor's edge.
I think in part it comes back to the</v>

1456
01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:38.240
limiting of inputs and selective ignorance that you've talked about,
Ryan,

1457
01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:41.230
because if you triple the number of clients you have in a high tech,

1458
01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:43.900
high tech and high touch business,

1459
01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:49.480
you're going to have to juggle 17 chainsaws instead of two chainsaws,
right?

1460
01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:53.100
<v 3>Then I'm reacting,
I'm,
I'm not,
I'm not,</v>

1461
01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:56.850
I'm embodying the core principles that we're working on.
And so much of of,

1462
01:21:56.851 --> 01:22:01.110
I find really high level training is kind of sort of sematic transmission.

1463
01:22:01.770 --> 01:22:04.380
You're embodying a certain state and then you're,

1464
01:22:04.770 --> 01:22:06.690
you're helping someone embody that state

1465
01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:10.020
<v 1>as well.
Totally agree.
And I think that if you want a good example of that,</v>

1466
01:22:10.021 --> 01:22:12.780
just as a relatively new dog owner or as an adult,

1467
01:22:12.810 --> 01:22:17.810
you can look at dogs or children who are fundamentally unblocked and that

1468
01:22:18.181 --> 01:22:23.050
sematic
read reading ability.

1469
01:22:23.530 --> 01:22:26.710
And you can see just as you said,

1470
01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:31.690
as a parent transmits their state of being to their child despite,

1471
01:22:31.870 --> 01:22:36.340
despite or with the assistance of whatever they might say.
Uh,

1472
01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:39.370
similarly,
if you're interacting adult to adult,

1473
01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:43.490
you need to sort of return to that state to be maximally effective.

1474
01:22:43.491 --> 01:22:45.520
And what you do in particular,
right?

1475
01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:50.720
<v 3>Right.
And then when we're talking about sort of dancing on the razor's edge,</v>

1476
01:22:50.721 --> 01:22:53.150
right?
So when you're,
when you're in,

1477
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:57.110
when you're moving up the growth curve in it,
certain discipline,

1478
01:22:57.950 --> 01:23:00.240
there's a lot of things that you can do to reach the first,
you know,

1479
01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:02.830
80th or 90th or 95th percentile something.

1480
01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:06.190
When you're talking about the last point,
zero zero 1% you're talking

1481
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:10.720
<v 2>about this,
these arenas where,
where the greatest insight,</v>

1482
01:23:10.721 --> 01:23:13.660
we'll be right next to the greatest blunder.
And,
and it's,

1483
01:23:13.661 --> 01:23:17.350
you have to be willing to go just to write on that razor's edge.
Right?

1484
01:23:17.351 --> 01:23:19.090
As you think about like of the,

1485
01:23:19.150 --> 01:23:22.360
I was having this great conversation with the sports psychologist Michael

1486
01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:24.670
Surveys a couple of weeks ago and he made that he had talked to uses language of

1487
01:23:24.671 --> 01:23:27.950
thrusting into big waves,
right?
The experience he had to go into,

1488
01:23:27.970 --> 01:23:32.500
like to push himself as a surfer to thrust into,
I'm big waves.
I love that.

1489
01:23:32.501 --> 01:23:34.870
I love that expression.
Right?
It's like,

1490
01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:36.880
but of course if you're thrusting into big waves,

1491
01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:39.190
then you can easily push yourself into the wave.
You shouldn't take,

1492
01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:43.990
I so big wave surfers have to be able to navigate that just the most fine.

1493
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:47.860
Finally tuned
in the moment.

1494
01:23:47.861 --> 01:23:52.861
Just intuitive decision making process of whether the moment is just right or

1495
01:23:53.411 --> 01:23:55.720
whether it's a moment that will kill you.
Right?

1496
01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:58.750
And then if you're working with people as a coach or as a trainer,
right,

1497
01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:01.000
of people who are,
who are navigating that terrain,

1498
01:24:01.450 --> 01:24:03.790
you have to be in a state where you can have a good,
that's right.

1499
01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:06.970
You have to have an embodied state there.
And I think that's a,
that's a,

1500
01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:09.250
that's a mistake that a lot of people make and everything that they do,

1501
01:24:09.290 --> 01:24:12.820
they just scale.
They scale in the Lou quality.
Um,

1502
01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:14.350
and when they look quality,

1503
01:24:14.351 --> 01:24:16.540
you lose the ability to successfully navigate the razor's edge.

1504
01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:17.860
And then by definition you're,

1505
01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:20.770
you're probably more destructive than you are productive than you are helpful.

1506
01:24:21.530 --> 01:24:25.120
And so like when I think about training people who are in that place,

1507
01:24:25.121 --> 01:24:29.590
it's like 99.9% listening.
And ideally you can,

1508
01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:33.250
you can make the most potent suggestions with the lightest touch,
feasible.

1509
01:24:34.830 --> 01:24:38.370
<v 1>The notes,
I took some notes beforehand.</v>

1510
01:24:38.371 --> 01:24:43.371
Here are borrowed some notes beforehand and one of them touches on the principle

1511
01:24:43.741 --> 01:24:48.330
of scarcity
in a habit creation,

1512
01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:51.450
be the learning process,
see the creative process.

1513
01:24:51.451 --> 01:24:54.420
I don't know if we'll have time to get all of these right now,

1514
01:24:54.450 --> 01:24:57.750
but could you just elaborate on the principle of scarcity?

1515
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:05.780
<v 2>So if we think about the,
the idea of subtraction or essentialism or scarcity,</v>

1516
01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:10.760
right?
Um,
I mean,
you,
you,
you frankly are as good as it gets in my opinion,

1517
01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:15.260
that at harnessing the principle of scarcity,
right?
In your learning process,

1518
01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:17.720
learning how to deconstruct something,

1519
01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:22.580
focusing on what's absolutely most essential,
right,
and zone in on it,

1520
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:23.833
right?

1521
01:25:24.230 --> 01:25:28.940
As opposed to just throwing huge amounts of resources of things and um,

1522
01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:33.740
just having a diluted quality of approach.

1523
01:25:34.490 --> 01:25:37.010
Most people when they,
when they become successful,

1524
01:25:37.011 --> 01:25:39.380
they have the opportunity to have more resources and they keep on layering more

1525
01:25:39.381 --> 01:25:40.380
and more resources on things.

1526
01:25:40.381 --> 01:25:43.130
And so they're not very potent and how they go about things.
If you,

1527
01:25:43.250 --> 01:25:45.320
if you cut those resources down 99%,

1528
01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.960
then you find yourself just zoning in on what's most essential.

1529
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:52.280
And then if you can learn to add resources incrementally maintaining that

1530
01:25:52.281 --> 01:25:54.020
potency,
it's incredible.
You can do,

1531
01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:56.660
but it takes a lot of discipline to maintain that principle of scarcity.

1532
01:25:57.230 --> 01:26:01.610
So in habit creation,
taking on,
um,
the right amount,
not too much,

1533
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.010
not too little,
but not too much.
People tend to

1534
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:07.370
<v 3>think about layering on and they get excited when they realized if I could go</v>

1535
01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:08.830
through a diagnostic process was,
and then we,
we,

1536
01:26:08.890 --> 01:26:10.600
we realize that there's 10 areas they could take on.

1537
01:26:10.601 --> 01:26:12.830
They want to take on all of them at once.
Right?

1538
01:26:12.831 --> 01:26:15.530
You can really take on one or two things at once.
Um,

1539
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:19.100
ideally one on one theme with you take on two or three manifestations,

1540
01:26:19.101 --> 01:26:22.880
that theme to burn that theme on and you keep on layering.
Right?
Um,

1541
01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:27.410
in the creative process,
I mean,
you talk about limiting inputs,
right?

1542
01:26:27.411 --> 01:26:30.470
We've been talking about Lynn positive constraints.
Yeah.
Positive constraints.

1543
01:26:30.471 --> 01:26:33.140
I mean you,
can you listen me,
speaking about this principle to you,
I mean you,

1544
01:26:33.141 --> 01:26:36.110
you embody this principle profound that,
what are your thoughts on it?

1545
01:26:38.730 --> 01:26:39.061
<v 1>Well,</v>

1546
01:26:39.061 --> 01:26:44.061
the few things I need just to maybe add a couple of anecdotes to what you just

1547
01:26:45.001 --> 01:26:49.410
said.
The first thing that came to mind was a quote,

1548
01:26:49.411 --> 01:26:53.640
and I'm going to butcher this,
but it's from Jack Ma of Alibaba who said,

1549
01:26:53.641 --> 01:26:55.890
you know,
in the beginning we had an advantage.
We had no experience,

1550
01:26:55.891 --> 01:26:57.330
no business plan and no money.

1551
01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:00.900
So it forced us to make all of our decisions very carefully.

1552
01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:06.240
And I do think that people tend to,

1553
01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:07.500
and I'm also borrowing this,

1554
01:27:07.501 --> 01:27:11.070
but overestimate what they can accomplish in a week and underestimate what they

1555
01:27:11.071 --> 01:27:13.770
can accomplish in a year,
which leads to

1556
01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:20.160
theoretically appealing decisions like trying to adopt 10 new behaviors at once

1557
01:27:20.610 --> 01:27:24.030
that are kind of,
uh,

1558
01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:29.710
our wise.
And you're foolish,
right,
in the sense that they're,

1559
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:32.820
they're doomed to fail from the outset in many respects.

1560
01:27:32.910 --> 01:27:36.310
And the tea,

1561
01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:38.670
to your point also about scaling.

1562
01:27:39.130 --> 01:27:43.170
You know I have friends that call this the s word because it's romanticized kind

1563
01:27:43.171 --> 01:27:48.120
of
worships notion and Silicon Valley scale,
scale,
scale.

1564
01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:49.260
You've got to be bigger,
higher,

1565
01:27:49.261 --> 01:27:54.261
more people ship more product and if you are looking to kind of optimize your

1566
01:27:56.191 --> 01:28:00.330
craft,
your art that may or may not be the right path to doing that.

1567
01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:04.150
And to my mind,
you know,

1568
01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:08.900
you can look at exemplars or you can look at examples of people who have scaled.

1569
01:28:08.901 --> 01:28:13.290
We're still critics of scaling in the sense that Bill Gates I believe said,

1570
01:28:13.291 --> 01:28:16.530
you know,
if you add people to an inefficient process,

1571
01:28:16.531 --> 01:28:19.490
it just makes the problem worse.
You have to add people to it,

1572
01:28:19.491 --> 01:28:23.310
an efficient process.
And to that end,

1573
01:28:23.311 --> 01:28:27.450
like whether you are looking to build a,
for instance,

1574
01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:28.710
lifestyle business,

1575
01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:33.060
like a healthy cashflow based business that represents in some way your craft.

1576
01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:34.730
Let's just say you make a,

1577
01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:39.740
this is a real example actually like 20 customized rifles a year.

1578
01:28:40.710 --> 01:28:41.640
That's all you do.

1579
01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:46.700
And you sell to the top like 0.001% of marksman marksman in the United States.

1580
01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:51.180
You never ship more than that.
That's the constraint that you apply.

1581
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:54.420
Whether you're trying to do that or build Microsoft,

1582
01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:58.000
that lesson can apply,
uh,

1583
01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:02.730
whether it's adding one person or adding the next thousand people.
So for me,

1584
01:29:03.690 --> 01:29:06.450
I think it's very easy to create a false dichotomy in your mind.

1585
01:29:06.451 --> 01:29:11.451
When you look at say a small still small scale craftsmen whose perhaps like

1586
01:29:12.361 --> 01:29:16.320
making,
uh,
let's just say

1587
01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:23.750
oil paintings and in rural Alaska versus a startup in Silicon Valley with a

1588
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:28.200
thousand employees.
And to think of them as totally different,
but in fact,

1589
01:29:28.201 --> 01:29:32.820
if you look at the,
the top performers in either environment,

1590
01:29:32.821 --> 01:29:34.680
they'll have a lot in common with each other.

1591
01:29:34.710 --> 01:29:38.070
And I think one of those commonalities is applying a lot of positive constraints

1592
01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:40.950
even when you have an embarrassment of resources available.

1593
01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:45.140
<v 3>When we think about this in terms of the creative process,
you know,</v>

1594
01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:49.370
maybe one of the most important it's a train is the ability to ask the right

1595
01:29:49.371 --> 01:29:52.630
question to know where to look right.
And if you look at people in,

1596
01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:56.210
in most creative fields who are extremely high level of versus and granted lower

1597
01:29:56.211 --> 01:30:00.770
fields,
it's knowing what the most critical area is for,

1598
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:04.430
um,
for thinking.
Let's pause for two minutes and then we'll continue.

1599
01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:05.051
I kind of want to,

1600
01:30:05.051 --> 01:30:08.420
Jack said to say hi to everybody is a kind of magic jack saying hi to everybody.

1601
01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:10.760
He's thinking we're going to get jack playing with something and then we're

1602
01:30:10.761 --> 01:30:12.530
gonna finish it up.
Okay.
To be continued.

1603
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:16.620
<v 1>Yeah,
we are,</v>

1604
01:30:16.621 --> 01:30:21.600
we have dinosaur train plan for the little one dinosaur train creators.

1605
01:30:21.601 --> 01:30:22.820
That one's on me.
Okay.

1606
01:30:24.610 --> 01:30:28.650
<v 3>And Josh has a continuation.
Yeah.
Thinking about this principle of,</v>

1607
01:30:28.730 --> 01:30:33.590
of scarcity.
Um,
one of the,
the ways that I,

1608
01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:35.810
I have myself trained at this,

1609
01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:40.700
I'm in the creative process or harness the principle of scarcity is,
is,

1610
01:30:40.850 --> 01:30:45.850
and I have everyone who I work with live in this routine is forcing yourself to

1611
01:30:46.731 --> 01:30:48.080
end of each day.

1612
01:30:48.290 --> 01:30:52.010
Think about what the most important question is in what you're working.

1613
01:30:52.011 --> 01:30:54.440
We discussed this last time.
Um,

1614
01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:57.290
it's really interesting cause you're studying complexity all the time and if

1615
01:30:57.291 --> 01:30:58.130
you're a really high level thinking,

1616
01:30:58.131 --> 01:30:59.660
you're slicing through most of it like butter.

1617
01:30:59.661 --> 01:31:03.770
But then there's usually one or two or three years of stuckness and most people

1618
01:31:03.771 --> 01:31:06.530
I find tend to live in the creative process by they kind of surfacing,

1619
01:31:06.531 --> 01:31:07.400
deciding where they want to go,

1620
01:31:07.401 --> 01:31:10.310
putting their head down and just grinding their way toward it and then surfacing

1621
01:31:10.311 --> 01:31:14.180
later on they don't surface enough to reflect on what's the most potent

1622
01:31:14.181 --> 01:31:14.810
direction to go.

1623
01:31:14.810 --> 01:31:18.470
You think about like the human versus a computer playing chess 10 years ago now

1624
01:31:18.471 --> 01:31:21.620
that computers are getting really good at knowing where to look.
But you know,

1625
01:31:21.621 --> 01:31:22.920
10 years ago the,

1626
01:31:23.210 --> 01:31:27.290
the human knew that one of these two or three directions was the right essential

1627
01:31:27.291 --> 01:31:29.060
direction.
Intuitively we sense that,
right?

1628
01:31:29.061 --> 01:31:31.150
And we cultivate the ability to know where to look.
The computer.

1629
01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:33.470
I'd look at everything.
If we're looking at everything,

1630
01:31:33.471 --> 01:31:35.690
then we're just operating like really,
really bad computers.

1631
01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:39.830
But if we cultivate the ability to ask the most potent question,
um,

1632
01:31:40.610 --> 01:31:42.800
systematically,
right?
So how do we do this?
Well,

1633
01:31:42.801 --> 01:31:46.520
we have a routine where we end each workday thinking what's the most important

1634
01:31:46.521 --> 01:31:49.400
question,
um,
in what I'm doing right now.
Pose the question for the,

1635
01:31:49.401 --> 01:31:51.710
to the unconscious and the wake up first and the morning and brainstorm on it.

1636
01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:54.950
Do you have them pose it again?
No,

1637
01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:57.950
actually I think it's pretty important not to do that because then we're kind of

1638
01:31:57.951 --> 01:31:59.770
consciously ruminating on,
I have them,

1639
01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:02.830
hopefully they haven't thought about it for a few hours before they go to bed.

1640
01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:03.281
This is going to,

1641
01:32:03.281 --> 01:32:06.820
Hemingway wrote about in his crew and his writing process really beautiful.
Um,

1642
01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:11.470
the Hemingway would stop writing mid sentence.
Right.

1643
01:32:11.770 --> 01:32:15.760
And provide a foothold for continuing the next day.
Right.

1644
01:32:15.890 --> 01:32:18.610
Which we could also look at it from the framing of that internal versus external

1645
01:32:18.611 --> 01:32:20.050
framing.
Right.
If you're,

1646
01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:23.260
if you're kind of held by a sense of guilt whenever you're not working,

1647
01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:25.870
then you're going to feel like you have to write everything you have to,
right?

1648
01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:28.750
But if you're nurturing from the inside out your creative process,

1649
01:32:28.751 --> 01:32:30.610
you're going to be comfortable stopping with a sense of direction.

1650
01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:32.920
Even when you're mid sentence or mid paragraph.
Right.

1651
01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:36.910
When I've talked to people who have started journaling successfully for the

1652
01:32:36.911 --> 01:32:38.980
first time,
the can,

1653
01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:44.020
most consistent pattern that I see is I write less than I feel I can each day.

1654
01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:47.170
Yeah.
They're new.

1655
01:32:47.230 --> 01:32:52.230
They're never pushing to max capacity or feeling like they're pushing the Max.

1656
01:32:53.230 --> 01:32:57.280
They always write less than they feel they should.
Right,
right.

1657
01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:59.260
That's very interesting.
That's very interesting.

1658
01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:02.140
And if we think about taking this and then,

1659
01:33:02.170 --> 01:33:07.170
and then turning it into a systematic training of the ability to be potent in

1660
01:33:07.211 --> 01:33:08.950
the creative process,
if we're,

1661
01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:12.280
if we're reflecting of working on a given project and reflecting on what's the

1662
01:33:12.281 --> 01:33:15.030
most important question here,
and we're journaling on it,

1663
01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:17.770
the brains in the brainstorm in the morning and we're doing a lot of things,

1664
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:20.080
you know,
we're opening the channels systematically between the conscious and the

1665
01:33:20.081 --> 01:33:22.720
unconscious mind.
We're waking up in the morning at the beginning.

1666
01:33:22.721 --> 01:33:26.260
Are they proactively,
all of these things which we discussed in the past.

1667
01:33:26.650 --> 01:33:30.640
But then if you sit back after,
say a month and you look back at your,

1668
01:33:30.641 --> 01:33:32.380
say three or four or five journals,

1669
01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:37.360
brainstorms Q and A's or on a given subject and you think about,

1670
01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:40.330
okay,
so in the moment this is what I thought was most potent,

1671
01:33:40.331 --> 01:33:43.510
but now I realize that this in fact would have been most potent.
What's the gap?

1672
01:33:44.230 --> 01:33:48.310
Deconstruct the gap between your understanding then your understanding now and

1673
01:33:48.311 --> 01:33:52.660
then design your training process around,
um,
deconstructing that gap,

1674
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:55.660
right under and training at what that gap revealed.

1675
01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:57.940
It's a really powerful way for an angels.

1676
01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.660
What assumptions underlied that gap,
right?

1677
01:34:01.661 --> 01:34:03.700
The Krishna they cap or that blind spot,

1678
01:34:03.730 --> 01:34:06.610
that misperception about what was most important,
right?
Right.

1679
01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:10.850
And so you're training yourself day in and day out like water,
right?
To,
um,

1680
01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:15.970
be an increasingly potent thinker and that this is manifesting scarcity and that

1681
01:34:15.971 --> 01:34:17.710
we are for forcing ourselves.

1682
01:34:17.711 --> 01:34:21.970
No matter how many resources we have to think about what is the most important

1683
01:34:21.971 --> 01:34:24.370
question.
And when I'm working on right now.

1684
01:34:24.970 --> 01:34:29.440
Do you journal every day?
Yes.

1685
01:34:29.890 --> 01:34:33.610
When do you journal?
I journal.
Um,

1686
01:34:34.010 --> 01:34:39.010
well I general throughout.
So I was like,
I'll wake up in the morning,

1687
01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:43.120
meditate,
take a take a cold than hot,
cold undulation,
shower,

1688
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:47.710
and then meditate.
And then I will journal.

1689
01:34:48.730 --> 01:34:51.310
Um,
I've had periods where I've just moved.
Right.

1690
01:34:51.311 --> 01:34:53.380
And especially when I was working in lucid dream where I moved straight from

1691
01:34:53.381 --> 01:34:56.710
sleep into and,
but that's my rhythm today.
Um,

1692
01:34:56.770 --> 01:34:58.670
and then when I have insights throughout the day,

1693
01:34:58.671 --> 01:35:01.160
I'll do quick journals about them.
Um,

1694
01:35:01.190 --> 01:35:04.340
and then after I have sessions with clients,

1695
01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:06.800
I'll do a journaling session on the most important takeaways.

1696
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:10.670
Do you do that in a notebook or do you do digitally?
I do it on Evernote.

1697
01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:13.700
And then I tagged everything thematically,
which is hugely important for me.

1698
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:17.330
I have all of my journals and all of the resources,
um,
every,
you know,

1699
01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:22.360
that I find valuable tagged thematically and through habits in the language of

1700
01:35:23.151 --> 01:35:23.960
my training process.

1701
01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:28.340
And so this is incredibly powerful for being able to give people resources.

1702
01:35:28.341 --> 01:35:32.330
For me reviewing the ideas without having recency bias impede.
Um,

1703
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:35.300
now how I communicate.
Can you say that one more time?
Give.

1704
01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:38.720
So if I have a client who I think has to work on a certain theme and I want to

1705
01:35:38.721 --> 01:35:40.130
give them resources they can read on it,

1706
01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:43.910
I can just click on the tag on Evernote and all of the resources,

1707
01:35:43.911 --> 01:35:47.420
things that I've written and things that I've read circling that theme are right

1708
01:35:47.421 --> 01:35:49.760
there and is also really powerful because you know,

1709
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:53.240
it's really hard to overcome recency without recency bias,
right?

1710
01:35:53.241 --> 01:35:55.130
Meaning like the primacy and recency effect.

1711
01:35:55.131 --> 01:35:57.440
So you're recalling what it is you read most recently,

1712
01:35:57.441 --> 01:35:59.280
not necessarily the best resource,
right?

1713
01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:02.810
And not necessarily the foundation of my relationship to the,
to,
to the theme.

1714
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:05.420
Understand you want to communicate it from someone's learned from the foundation

1715
01:36:05.421 --> 01:36:08.600
up.
So really powerful.
The tagging,
I mean I find on,

1716
01:36:09.170 --> 01:36:12.560
I'm sure Evernote isn't the unknown,
not a big tech wizard as you know,
but just,

1717
01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:15.530
just to put this in perspective.
So we were looking for,
when we,

1718
01:36:15.531 --> 01:36:19.280
I'm using the royal,
we,
Josh was looking for dinosaur train for like 10 minutes,

1719
01:36:19.281 --> 01:36:21.770
and then he's like,
you know what,
I think I'm going to search this thing.

1720
01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:25.340
And I was like,
and you say you're not going to attack.

1721
01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:30.530
It was a good showing.
Oh,
thanks man.
That was a big discovery.

1722
01:36:32.170 --> 01:36:37.130
And then the like there is done this amazing how this search function works.

1723
01:36:37.670 --> 01:36:41.300
Uh,
should we talk about thematic interconnectedness?

1724
01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:44.000
Yes.
Let's talk about it.

1725
01:36:44.001 --> 01:36:46.910
I'd love to talk about in the context of education a little bit.
Um,

1726
01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:49.480
this is one of the,
I mean,
thematic interconnectedness is one of,

1727
01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:52.120
maybe that's the essence of my relationship to,

1728
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:56.210
to the world or beyond.
Um,
I think it's,
I mean,

1729
01:36:56.211 --> 01:37:01.211
you and I have as [inaudible] are eccentric conversations all over the world on

1730
01:37:01.670 --> 01:37:04.550
surfboards and wherever else.
This has been a big topic for us,
right?
Yeah.

1731
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:08.810
Constant topic in various states.
Um,
and

1732
01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:13.010
it's been a huge part of how I've approached learning,
you know,

1733
01:37:13.011 --> 01:37:17.570
from my foundation and in looking at the relationships between chess and life,

1734
01:37:17.571 --> 01:37:21.060
learning about life through chess than in transferring level over from chess

1735
01:37:21.061 --> 01:37:23.870
into the martial arts and then first Chinese martial arts,

1736
01:37:23.871 --> 01:37:28.310
then into Brazilian Jujitsu.
And then when I work with people,
um,

1737
01:37:28.610 --> 01:37:32.480
it's really how I learn and it's how I've found it's really powerful to help

1738
01:37:32.481 --> 01:37:33.680
people amplify their growth curves,

1739
01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:37.690
to teach them to be able to learn the many from the few or from the one,
right?

1740
01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:39.460
Learning the macro from the micro,
um,

1741
01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:43.250
break down the boundaries between disparate pursuits or disparate parts of life,

1742
01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:45.950
but between the personal and the professional,

1743
01:37:45.951 --> 01:37:49.310
the technical and the psychological.
Right.
Um,

1744
01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:51.680
and if we have an experience where,
you know,

1745
01:37:51.710 --> 01:37:54.370
we're on surfboards and we have some little,
you know,

1746
01:37:55.290 --> 01:37:57.990
thematic breakthrough and we can apply it to every other aspect of our life,

1747
01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:00.990
it's really interesting what can happen because we're pretty well calloused over

1748
01:38:00.991 --> 01:38:01.980
in our areas of strength.

1749
01:38:01.981 --> 01:38:06.690
But in areas where we're like less advanced W W we can be more raw and we might

1750
01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:08.450
be more conducive to break through sometimes.

1751
01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:09.280
<v 1>Oh,
100%.</v>

1752
01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:13.750
I mean you can see things with beginner's mind because you have no other choice,

1753
01:38:14.370 --> 01:38:15.700
right?
You don't have to,

1754
01:38:16.420 --> 01:38:20.380
you don't have to try to simulate beginner's mind because you are a beginner.

1755
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:23.800
It was like the race to the bottom right.
A experience.

1756
01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:26.820
So for those who are wondering what the hell that means,
uh,

1757
01:38:26.860 --> 01:38:31.330
the race to the bottom is an expression that Eric,
uh,
of paddle will,

1758
01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:36.360
our Surf Paddle surfing instructor uses to refer to constantly dropping in board

1759
01:38:39.161 --> 01:38:43.630
size,
uh,
often measured in liters for buoyancy purposes.

1760
01:38:44.230 --> 01:38:49.230
And Josh and I and everyone who was there really very quickly realize that you

1761
01:38:50.981 --> 01:38:55.780
are,
to use your expression kind of dancing the razor's edge and trying to find a

1762
01:38:55.781 --> 01:38:57.640
balance between the race to the bottom,

1763
01:38:57.641 --> 01:39:02.140
but also maintaining motivation so you're not just slipping on banana peels for

1764
01:39:02.141 --> 01:39:03.070
five hours straight.

1765
01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:08.890
And to what extent do you focus on the board size and the race to the bottom

1766
01:39:08.891 --> 01:39:09.670
versus,

1767
01:39:09.670 --> 01:39:14.670
which gives you more maneuverability in surfing versus actually working on say

1768
01:39:15.281 --> 01:39:18.640
the footwork and the other technical aspects of the game on a board that you can

1769
01:39:18.641 --> 01:39:20.530
manage a,

1770
01:39:21.330 --> 01:39:23.370
<v 3>and it's very jarring to think about this theme of the race to the bottom</v>

1771
01:39:23.371 --> 01:39:28.090
combined with this other wonderful principal that I,
that Eric,
um,

1772
01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:32.700
and that we were all talking about with Eric,
um,
which is,

1773
01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:35.670
which is swap the swapping of boards between.

1774
01:39:35.671 --> 01:39:38.880
So he had these camps where they think the 18 top stand up paddle surfers in the

1775
01:39:38.881 --> 01:39:41.970
world together with them all riding these ridiculously small boards that are

1776
01:39:41.971 --> 01:39:43.580
deep underwater when you're standing on them.

1777
01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:45.660
And I mean it's incredibly hard to balance in these things.

1778
01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:49.080
So they've internalized this race to the bottom theme so deeply,
um,

1779
01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:52.770
which we are working on.
And um,

1780
01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:54.690
and then they're also,

1781
01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:59.550
they had this experience where they were all together and initially it was sort

1782
01:39:59.551 --> 01:40:00.384
of competitive,

1783
01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:02.950
but then it became much more collaborative and they were just sharing ideas and

1784
01:40:02.970 --> 01:40:04.050
they began to swap boards.

1785
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:07.620
And they began to have this interesting experience where,
you know,

1786
01:40:07.621 --> 01:40:10.170
every surfboard,
kind of a,
of his own lines,
right?

1787
01:40:10.171 --> 01:40:11.610
There's the practitioner who carves his lines,

1788
01:40:11.611 --> 01:40:14.100
but then there's also the board that has,
you know,
unique rocker,

1789
01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:15.820
we'll find new law,
new lines in the wave.

1790
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:18.270
And with these guys would find is that if they swap boards,

1791
01:40:18.330 --> 01:40:21.270
they could see new lines in the wave because if they listened to the board,

1792
01:40:21.271 --> 01:40:25.500
some guys would swap boards and try to force the new boards to carve their
lines.

1793
01:40:25.530 --> 01:40:29.760
Others would sort of be open to what this new board could do and then they would

1794
01:40:29.761 --> 01:40:32.520
learn from it and then they'd go back to their board and their minds and open up

1795
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:33.270
these there.

1796
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:35.580
That's another way of thinking about this idea of the beginner's mind,
right?

1797
01:40:35.581 --> 01:40:36.750
The new board forced them,

1798
01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:41.960
help them see new lines if they are open minded enough.
Right?
So anyway,
but the,

1799
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:44.250
this is the kind of,
this is an example of dramatic interconnectedness,
right?

1800
01:40:44.251 --> 01:40:45.990
So when I came back from that,
this was our last,

1801
01:40:46.050 --> 01:40:49.890
our previous trip where we were talking about the swapping boards theme.

1802
01:40:49.891 --> 01:40:54.010
When I came back and I was red hot on fire with how to apply this theme in the

1803
01:40:54.011 --> 01:40:55.930
investment process with my guys,
right?

1804
01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:59.320
So you have these teams that are so private and there are so magnificent in what

1805
01:40:59.321 --> 01:41:01.450
they do,
but if you could get teams to mix,

1806
01:41:01.451 --> 01:41:05.380
to share ideas with a sense of abundance,
right?
Um,
like for example,

1807
01:41:05.381 --> 01:41:09.530
if a world class portfolio managers could swap analysts with another pm for um,

1808
01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:13.390
a week or two or three,
would it be interesting if they were both like,
okay,

1809
01:41:13.391 --> 01:41:16.130
if they were truly everyone was sharing openly the,

1810
01:41:16.131 --> 01:41:18.850
you'd see new you'd be to do doing equivalent swapping board seeing new lions,

1811
01:41:18.851 --> 01:41:21.550
right?
It's forcing a beginner's mind,
but forcing the beginner's mind,

1812
01:41:21.551 --> 01:41:22.660
not only with an open mind in this,

1813
01:41:22.661 --> 01:41:27.661
but also it w tapping somebody who is truly exceptional at a very different

1814
01:41:28.451 --> 01:41:30.100
style of what you do,
right?

1815
01:41:30.101 --> 01:41:33.100
So there's an example of just having experience in surfing and applying it to

1816
01:41:33.101 --> 01:41:37.780
something else,
right?
And converting it potentially into a simple question,
right?

1817
01:41:37.781 --> 01:41:41.410
Like where can,
where can I swap boards?
Right?
Right,
right.

1818
01:41:41.411 --> 01:41:43.810
Be something that is used for fodder

1819
01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:47.700
<v 1>for people listening in a journaling exercise.
Right?
And wake up,</v>

1820
01:41:47.730 --> 01:41:50.490
have your coffee or I was going to say,
have your coffee than meditate.

1821
01:41:50.491 --> 01:41:54.460
Probably not the right order.
Have you coffee,
sit down,
you know,

1822
01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:58.390
<v 3>drop that question at the top and just,
we're going to swap boards.
Beautiful.</v>

1823
01:41:58.391 --> 01:42:01.300
Exactly that.
This isn't it.
Magnificent journaling,

1824
01:42:01.330 --> 01:42:04.180
like brainstorm question to riff on.
I love it.
I love it.

1825
01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:08.080
So how do you apply that to education?
So this dramatic interconnectedness,

1826
01:42:08.081 --> 01:42:09.040
I mean the way,
the way,

1827
01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:14.100
I don't think that we can do much more important work with children then,

1828
01:42:14.470 --> 01:42:17.500
um,
help them love learning,

1829
01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:20.140
help them learn to bring out the essence of who they are and the learning

1830
01:42:20.141 --> 01:42:23.020
process,
right?
So the express the core of who they are through learning,

1831
01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:27.610
which obviously will help them love learning and then help them discover the

1832
01:42:27.630 --> 01:42:31.990
magic interconnectedness.
How,
um,
the world is interconnected via principles,

1833
01:42:31.991 --> 01:42:36.130
themes,
people are,
are really,
um,
siloed right now.

1834
01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:40.960
People think about disciplines in,
in an increasingly data driven,
um,

1835
01:42:42.430 --> 01:42:45.370
segregated way,
segregated way in a closed minded way.

1836
01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:48.360
And it's kind of heartbreaking.
And so,
you know,
I have this nonprofit,

1837
01:42:48.370 --> 01:42:50.590
I've been running for a lot of years.
Um,

1838
01:42:51.190 --> 01:42:55.360
and a huge amount of what we do.
So we,
all of our work is in education.

1839
01:42:55.361 --> 01:42:57.760
We've got hundreds of programs around the world,
mostly in the US,

1840
01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:02.560
but international as well.
The Art of learning project.org is our,
is our website.

1841
01:43:03.070 --> 01:43:05.750
Um,
and the,

1842
01:43:05.850 --> 01:43:09.610
the programs that are most exciting to me are the ones where we really are

1843
01:43:09.611 --> 01:43:13.510
systematically working with schools to help children experience the magic

1844
01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:16.450
interconnectedness.
And so the way we'll do this for example,

1845
01:43:16.451 --> 01:43:20.030
is that we'll be working with five teachers in um,

1846
01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:23.080
five different subject matters or four or five or six or three,

1847
01:43:23.081 --> 01:43:26.280
whatever the number is in,
in,
in the same age group.
What are you smiling at Man?

1848
01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:28.900
<v 1>So you think it was great looking at your face?</v>

1849
01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:32.193
Sorry guys.

1850
01:43:32.590 --> 01:43:36.940
I was just looking@theurlsistheartoflearningproject.org and I was laughing cause

1851
01:43:36.941 --> 01:43:41.140
I remembered when we were filming the TV show and we were walking up the stairs

1852
01:43:41.141 --> 01:43:44.770
to the Jujitsu,
the Marcel,
I go see it Jim.

1853
01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:49.110
And you kept on saying towel this towel that and I thought you were saying Talla

1854
01:43:49.111 --> 01:43:52.940
t o w e l and I'm like what fuck is Howell?
And you're like,

1855
01:43:53.330 --> 01:43:55.460
it's my God damn book and you've got all upset

1856
01:43:57.230 --> 01:44:00.470
the art of learning.
I'm like,
how did you expect me to piece that together?

1857
01:44:00.471 --> 01:44:03.630
Anyway,
that's why I was smirking.
Sorry.
Right

1858
01:44:07.490 --> 01:44:11.480
now I know the acronym and I won't anger Josh any further and angry me.

1859
01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:14.990
I know it is about value with you.
So anyway,
the,

1860
01:44:15.150 --> 01:44:18.180
<v 3>the um,
I don't remember that conversation</v>

1861
01:44:18.270 --> 01:44:21.570
<v 1>trying to put this up.
It was great.
Towel,
towel,</v>

1862
01:44:21.571 --> 01:44:24.780
towel for like five flights of stairs.
I'm like what the fuck he talking about?

1863
01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:26.153
Anyway,
my bad.

1864
01:44:26.830 --> 01:44:30.340
<v 3>So the way that we,
we do this is that we have,
for example,</v>

1865
01:44:30.341 --> 01:44:34.980
five sub teachers in different subject matters working,
uh,

1866
01:44:35.110 --> 01:44:35.943
with our,
with,

1867
01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:41.020
with my team to weave the same principle of learning into,

1868
01:44:41.890 --> 01:44:46.660
for example,
math,
English,
history,
social studies,
volleyball,

1869
01:44:46.661 --> 01:44:47.980
soccer at the same time.

1870
01:44:48.040 --> 01:44:50.470
And so you'll have kids who are studying their subject matter,
but they're,

1871
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:53.230
they're studying also the way a certain principle of learning or the creative

1872
01:44:53.231 --> 01:44:54.310
process of performance.
I called you,

1873
01:44:54.311 --> 01:44:57.250
manifests in each of these disciplines at the same time.
And so they're,

1874
01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:59.920
they're by definition,
breaking down the walls between these different pursuits.

1875
01:44:59.921 --> 01:45:02.740
And it's a really interesting systematic way of doing this,
right?

1876
01:45:02.741 --> 01:45:05.980
So there'll be studying the same principle in math and they moved to the next

1877
01:45:05.981 --> 01:45:07.210
subject and there's,
they're,
they're,

1878
01:45:07.330 --> 01:45:10.240
they're experiencing it through another lens and then through another lens and

1879
01:45:10.241 --> 01:45:11.170
they're experiencing it in sport.

1880
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:15.730
Are these borrowed from the art of learning book in so much as you're talking

1881
01:45:15.731 --> 01:45:18.040
about smaller and smaller circles or you're starting,

1882
01:45:18.190 --> 01:45:21.020
you're talking about learning the macro from the micro,
et Cetera?
Yes.
Yeah.

1883
01:45:21.140 --> 01:45:24.970
The root of these are in our core themes of learning creativity and performance

1884
01:45:24.971 --> 01:45:27.490
psychology that I wrote about in my book and that I've developed since.
Yeah,

1885
01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:30.700
absolutely.
And we've spoken about a lot of them together.
Um,

1886
01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:35.590
and so it's a kind of a combination of individualized self expression.
Um,

1887
01:45:37.120 --> 01:45:42.120
well a lot of these themes that we've been discussing today and last time and so

1888
01:45:42.730 --> 01:45:47.350
can people learn more about this@theartoflearningproject.org.
They can.
Um,

1889
01:45:47.590 --> 01:45:50.770
so we invite every,
everybody please come check out the site.

1890
01:45:50.771 --> 01:45:52.860
We've got some really wonderful programs around the world and it's,

1891
01:45:52.861 --> 01:45:56.410
it's a good timing for this right now because I'd love it if any educators out

1892
01:45:56.411 --> 01:46:00.910
there.
We're on the,
on the verge of launching,
um,

1893
01:46:01.090 --> 01:46:04.630
about 10 really high level programs is what we want to launch all thematically

1894
01:46:04.631 --> 01:46:09.130
driven right now,
the,
in the next,
in the next,
preparing them in the next month.

1895
01:46:09.490 --> 01:46:13.090
And so anyone who is in the educational world who would love to like to touch

1896
01:46:13.091 --> 01:46:16.930
base with us about,
um,
applying for this kind of program.

1897
01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:22.260
Katie on my team is can be reached@ktktyatjwufoundation.com.

1898
01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:28.540
I'm Jay debris foundation is the name of my nonprofit that,
that um,

1899
01:46:28.541 --> 01:46:32.470
houses the art of learning project.
So katie@atjtwoeefoundation.com.

1900
01:46:32.710 --> 01:46:37.420
Katie k a t y at JW is and Josh Waitzkin Foundation.
I'll come.

1901
01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:39.590
Yes.
Um,
and,

1902
01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:43.660
and she worked type of educators should check this out,

1903
01:46:43.661 --> 01:46:45.010
an email her teachers,

1904
01:46:45.011 --> 01:46:48.820
teachers or people running schools or school systems and the minimum number of

1905
01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:49.980
students or

1906
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:50.910
<v 1>any other parameters.</v>

1907
01:46:51.180 --> 01:46:54.270
<v 2>Well,
the essence of these of these programs would be,</v>

1908
01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:59.460
it would be a school system that's open minded around,
for example,
engaging,

1909
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.060
like I described teachers in different disciplines,

1910
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:06.360
working at the same time in a collaborative way.
Um,

1911
01:47:06.630 --> 01:47:09.030
so that the kids can be embodying the same principle in,

1912
01:47:09.031 --> 01:47:11.460
in multiple disciplines at the same time.
I mean,
that's the essence of it.

1913
01:47:11.461 --> 01:47:12.630
There's a bit of a coordinated program.

1914
01:47:12.631 --> 01:47:15.810
We've had wonderful success doing this and it's what really excites me in,

1915
01:47:15.930 --> 01:47:16.830
when I think about education,

1916
01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:21.840
how to build systematic training in creativity through thematic

1917
01:47:21.841 --> 01:47:25.110
interconnectedness into the way kids learn these days.

1918
01:47:25.111 --> 01:47:27.120
Because kids get so excited when they can see connections.
I mean,

1919
01:47:27.121 --> 01:47:31.380
this is a big part of what I'm experiencing as a dad with Jack is how red hot he

1920
01:47:31.381 --> 01:47:34.890
gets when he can learn something,
then apply it to many other things.

1921
01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:37.290
This is a core part of,
of my approach to learning.
I think it's been a,

1922
01:47:37.670 --> 01:47:42.510
I mean it's maybe my biggest strength is the ability to find hidden harmony's

1923
01:47:42.511 --> 01:47:47.040
between disparate parts of life.
Seemingly desperate.
Yeah,
seemingly.
Right.

1924
01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:50.600
<v 1>Well,
Josh,
this is,
uh,</v>

1925
01:47:51.140 --> 01:47:55.430
this is always so much fun to drag you kicking and screaming out of your cage.

1926
01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:58.000
You did it.
Okay.
Or Cave.

1927
01:48:00.490 --> 01:48:04.760
I like cave more early,
cave more.
I don't know why I was thinking cage,
I guess.

1928
01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:08.300
I guess that's just my inner primary coming out,
but the,
uh,

1929
01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:14.420
people have asked me often a ballot education following my ted talk.

1930
01:48:14.450 --> 01:48:15.350
We're at the end,

1931
01:48:15.351 --> 01:48:20.060
I close out talking about tackling different facets of education and I feel like

1932
01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:23.840
your approach and principle based

1933
01:48:25.460 --> 01:48:30.460
Lens through which you can not only spot but teach interconnectedness is just so

1934
01:48:31.311 --> 01:48:32.960
incredibly valuable.
Like you said,

1935
01:48:33.410 --> 01:48:38.410
in an educational system where fields are increasingly siloed and viewed as

1936
01:48:39.561 --> 01:48:43.490
separate and you have political turf wars between departments and whatnot,

1937
01:48:43.491 --> 01:48:45.110
which only exacerbates that problem.

1938
01:48:45.111 --> 01:48:49.430
And I feel like this is a massively powerful step in the right direction.

1939
01:48:49.431 --> 01:48:50.001
So number one,

1940
01:48:50.001 --> 01:48:54.020
thank you for that and number two educators listening to this or if you're just

1941
01:48:54.021 --> 01:48:56.210
curious to check it out and it might be able to help in some way,

1942
01:48:56.630 --> 01:49:01.630
the art of learning project.org and then if you get a taste of that and it seems

1943
01:49:02.511 --> 01:49:05.930
compelling and you want to try to apply or jumped into the fray,

1944
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:10.610
then Katie k t why@jwfoundation.com that Org.

1945
01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:12.370
Oh,
I'm sorry.
No about my bad.
You're right.

1946
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:16.640
The order of learning project.org and I'll put this in the show notes for

1947
01:49:16.641 --> 01:49:19.940
everybody listening.
These will be,
and many of others,
uh,

1948
01:49:19.970 --> 01:49:22.250
many of the other things that we've mentioned will be in the show notes at a

1949
01:49:22.251 --> 01:49:25.220
four hour work,
week.com forward slash podcast.
But Josh,

1950
01:49:25.310 --> 01:49:28.310
I would usually ask where can people find you online?
But they can't find you.

1951
01:49:29.450 --> 01:49:30.500
So I won't ask that.

1952
01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:35.000
Is there any thing that you would like people to,

1953
01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:38.150
besides visiting the resources we just mentioned,

1954
01:49:38.151 --> 01:49:42.440
anything that you'd like people to take away,
consider,
do any action,

1955
01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:46.430
anything that comes to mind you'd like people to,
to walk away with?

1956
01:49:46.490 --> 01:49:48.100
Just as a closing comment

1957
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:48.933
<v 3>or question?</v>

1958
01:49:52.820 --> 01:49:54.980
It's a big question.
Yes,
absolutely.

1959
01:49:58.090 --> 01:49:58.923
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1960
01:49:58.930 --> 01:50:02.110
<v 3>It's funny,
as I,
as I sit with this now for so many years,</v>

1961
01:50:02.111 --> 01:50:05.380
my primary identity was as a fighter,
a competitor.

1962
01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:10.150
And I've,
I've transitioned in recent years and I find my,

1963
01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:14.080
my primary identity now is a self identity.

1964
01:50:14.081 --> 01:50:19.081
The way I experienced myself is as a nurturer of,

1965
01:50:20.410 --> 01:50:24.140
of people.
Um,
my family,
um,

1966
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:27.580
the people that work very closely with and um,

1967
01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:29.950
children as I work more broadly in education.

1968
01:50:31.450 --> 01:50:33.370
And when I think about it through the context of,

1969
01:50:33.490 --> 01:50:36.930
of nurturing people and nurturing ourselves,
I think that,

1970
01:50:36.931 --> 01:50:41.440
that we're living in a world of so much noise and so much distraction out of the

1971
01:50:41.441 --> 01:50:42.880
space being constantly filled,

1972
01:50:45.750 --> 01:50:46.583
<v 4>that,
that</v>

1973
01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:52.080
<v 3>it's rather remarkable what can happen if we cultivate a mindfulness,</v>

1974
01:50:52.740 --> 01:50:55.470
a stillness of the waters as a way of life.

1975
01:50:55.471 --> 01:50:59.480
And we find the beauty in that there's so much cuter than come from silence.
Um,

1976
01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:04.250
we can learn so much by,
by feeling the ripples of our internal experience,
um,

1977
01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:07.680
and his parents embodying what we want our children to him,
buddy living it,

1978
01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:11.760
right?
Walking the talk,
putting away our phones,
um,

1979
01:51:12.270 --> 01:51:15.840
living a life of deep presence with our,
with our children,
with our students,

1980
01:51:15.841 --> 01:51:20.140
with the people we work with,
cultivating empathy,
cultivating compassion,
um,

1981
01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:23.070
scares the hell out of me.
How,

1982
01:51:23.490 --> 01:51:26.250
how powerfully I see the world moving in another direction from this.

1983
01:51:26.490 --> 01:51:28.680
And there's so much that we can,
that we can learn from,

1984
01:51:29.070 --> 01:51:32.920
from the speed of what computers can do of where AI is headed,
uh,
of,

1985
01:51:32.930 --> 01:51:36.690
of what big data can reveal it.
It's thrilling to me.
Um,

1986
01:51:36.750 --> 01:51:41.300
as long as we stay in touch with the,
the essential parts of our humanity.
Um,

1987
01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:49.980
and when I experience what happens working with people,

1988
01:51:50.021 --> 01:51:51.220
with adults or with children,

1989
01:51:51.730 --> 01:51:56.350
when we're just completely present and we cultivate that presence as a way of

1990
01:51:56.351 --> 01:51:58.120
life,
it's incredible what can happen between people.

1991
01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:03.610
And when I experienced the scars in children that I see everywhere they come

1992
01:52:03.611 --> 01:52:07.450
from the anxiety that comes from the lack of attachment,
secure attachment,

1993
01:52:07.870 --> 01:52:09.340
the lack of the attunement of the parent,

1994
01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:12.940
the lack of the embodiment of the parent or the teacher and these things that

1995
01:52:12.941 --> 01:52:15.220
are spoken about.
It's,
it's heartbreaking.

1996
01:52:18.230 --> 01:52:22.400
So maybe I'm,
maybe I'm really,
really old school,

1997
01:52:22.970 --> 01:52:24.620
but there's something about,

1998
01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:29.420
about the cultivation of deep presence and quality's a way of life,

1999
01:52:29.450 --> 01:52:32.270
which just brings all through me.
And I honestly,

2000
01:52:32.271 --> 01:52:35.150
the other thing I'll say is that after having the experience I had a few months

2001
01:52:35.150 --> 01:52:39.230
ago coming as close as you can have the dying,
um,
as you can basically,
I mean,

2002
01:52:39.770 --> 01:52:44.350
first of all,
on a tactical level,
please,
you know,
if,

2003
01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:48.170
if anyone's with different forms of breath hold work,
like the Wim Hoff method,

2004
01:52:48.171 --> 01:52:49.970
which I think is very interesting and quite powerful,

2005
01:52:50.090 --> 01:52:53.240
please don't do it in any water,
even an inch of water.
Because if you go out,

2006
01:52:53.930 --> 01:52:57.080
you don't want to be in water.
Um,
and then

2007
01:52:58.550 --> 01:53:02.120
<v 1>I should say,
if you practice this stuff enough and your type a personality,</v>

2008
01:53:02.121 --> 01:53:06.290
you aren't going to go out.
And there's a,
it's,
it's not just a high probability,

2009
01:53:06.291 --> 01:53:10.550
it's almost a certainty that you're going to go out and to think otherwise is

2010
01:53:10.580 --> 01:53:12.890
really courting disaster.
So do not do it

2011
01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:17.990
<v 3>in or near water.
Yeah.
And when we talk about fire walking,
right?</v>

2012
01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:18.680
But living,

2013
01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:21.320
learning from other people's experiences with the same physiological intensity

2014
01:53:21.321 --> 01:53:26.240
that you can learn from your own.
There's something about when you,
when you come,

2015
01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:28.310
like when you go over that edge,
over that cliff,

2016
01:53:29.690 --> 01:53:31.880
if I could take the experience of love,

2017
01:53:31.881 --> 01:53:35.510
gratitude and beauty that I've been living with ever since I had that experience

2018
01:53:36.290 --> 01:53:40.040
and I could give it to my brothers and sisters,
you know,

2019
01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:44.480
holy smokes.
I mean,
what a beautiful thing.
I,
um,

2020
01:53:45.650 --> 01:53:50.420
and so that any way that we can,
we can just live with that,

2021
01:53:50.450 --> 01:53:54.500
with that deep sense of beauty.
There's a rich place,
Huh?

2022
01:53:54.610 --> 01:53:57.490
<v 1>To find the stillness,
the cultivate,
not just fine,</v>

2023
01:53:57.491 --> 01:54:01.890
but create that stillness and practice.
Like you said,

2024
01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:05.350
the calming of the waters I think is,

2025
01:54:06.060 --> 01:54:09.450
<v 3>it's underestimated because of its</v>

2026
01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:15.570
<v 1>Percy simplicity and uh,</v>

2027
01:54:15.670 --> 01:54:18.490
just as not all things that are simple,

2028
01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:23.290
our EEZ not all things that are simple are low in value,

2029
01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:23.830
right?

2030
01:54:23.830 --> 01:54:27.340
It's sometimes what's right in front of you within grasp that is most important

2031
01:54:27.341 --> 01:54:29.650
to grasp onto and make use of.
Yeah.

2032
01:54:29.710 --> 01:54:33.640
It doesn't have to be extremely esoteric and it's so easy to think we've got it

2033
01:54:33.641 --> 01:54:35.320
nailed.
You know,
like we can meditate

2034
01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:37.330
<v 3>10 years and think we've got presence nailed.</v>

2035
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:40.750
And then we start meditating and then six months pass and we're distracted.

2036
01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:45.010
You know,
it,
it's,
it's just uh,
it's,
there's a constancy to it,
right?
Yup.

2037
01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:47.980
And a presence to the sense of the reels into danger that it can slip.

2038
01:54:48.570 --> 01:54:50.620
<v 1>And speaking for me personally,</v>

2039
01:54:50.650 --> 01:54:53.770
it's also building it in as a habit,

2040
01:54:53.771 --> 01:54:58.270
just like brushing your teeth for those people who brush your teeth.
Uh,

2041
01:54:58.930 --> 01:55:02.980
in so much as
for me,

2042
01:55:03.070 --> 01:55:06.850
and I know this is true for,
for many of my friends,
you can't,

2043
01:55:06.870 --> 01:55:11.140
it meditation doesn't really work well as a batched process.
In other words,

2044
01:55:11.141 --> 01:55:16.141
like meditating 10 minutes a day for 10 days is much more valuable than

2045
01:55:16.511 --> 01:55:20.110
meditating once in 10 days for a hundred minutes at.

2046
01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:22.970
And for most people it would be less painful to,
uh,

2047
01:55:23.230 --> 01:55:28.230
once you get into that habit and it becomes a ingrained part of your being in

2048
01:55:29.111 --> 01:55:30.760
your practice,
you will see the value,

2049
01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:35.560
particularly once you have a critical mass of,

2050
01:55:35.561 --> 01:55:38.110
for me it's typically five to seven days and then I'm just like,

2051
01:55:38.770 --> 01:55:40.540
I cannot believe I wasn't doing this.

2052
01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:44.010
I can't believe I stopped for four weeks or whatever it is.
It's

2053
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:47.940
<v 5>incredibly valuable and a brother Josh.
Thanks brother.
This was a blast man.</v>

2054
01:55:47.970 --> 01:55:48.803
Thanks buddy.

2055
01:55:50.890 --> 01:55:51.723
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2056
01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:57.770
<v 5>Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

2057
01:55:58.130 --> 01:56:00.740
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

2058
01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:04.040
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2059
01:56:04.041 --> 01:56:08.180
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

2060
01:56:08.181 --> 01:56:11.720
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

2061
01:56:11.721 --> 01:56:16.070
short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

2062
01:56:16.071 --> 01:56:17.390
pondering over the week.

2063
01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:20.360
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

2064
01:56:20.361 --> 01:56:23.810
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2065
01:56:23.811 --> 01:56:28.130
somehow dug up in the the world of the esoteric as I do.

2066
01:56:28.430 --> 01:56:33.430
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

2067
01:56:34.101 --> 01:56:36.800
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

2068
01:56:36.890 --> 01:56:41.870
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend,

2069
01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:44.090
so if you want to receive that,
check it out.

2070
01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:49.310
Just go to four hour work week.com that's four hour workweek.com all spelled out

2071
01:56:49.370 --> 01:56:52.220
and just drop in your email and you will get the very next one.

2072
01:56:52.460 --> 01:56:54.260
And if you sign up,
I hope you enjoy it.

2073
01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:02.200
This episode is brought to you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor.

2074
01:57:02.620 --> 01:57:07.000
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way,
set it and forget it.

2075
01:57:07.001 --> 01:57:11.380
Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous

2076
01:57:11.381 --> 01:57:12.130
investors.

2077
01:57:12.130 --> 01:57:15.820
It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than

2078
01:57:15.821 --> 01:57:18.820
two and a half billion dollars under management.
In fact,

2079
01:57:18.850 --> 01:57:20.170
some of my very good friends,

2080
01:57:20.230 --> 01:57:23.380
investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront.

2081
01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:26.470
So the question is why?
Why is it so popular?
Why is it unique?

2082
01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:30.760
Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

2083
01:57:30.761 --> 01:57:32.710
pay pennies on the dollar for them.

2084
01:57:33.250 --> 01:57:36.460
And this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations,

2085
01:57:36.461 --> 01:57:39.220
bloated sales teams,
et cetera.
And I'll come back to that in a second.

2086
01:57:39.730 --> 01:57:44.380
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk

2087
01:57:44.381 --> 01:57:47.650
assessment quiz which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for

2088
01:57:47.651 --> 01:57:51.460
free exactly the portfolio they'd put you in and if you just want to take their

2089
01:57:51.461 --> 01:57:55.360
advice,
run with it,
do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

2090
01:57:55.361 --> 01:57:57.220
you can set it and forget it.
Here's why.

2091
01:57:57.580 --> 01:58:01.570
The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that

2092
01:58:01.571 --> 01:58:04.960
investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't.

2093
01:58:05.350 --> 01:58:07.630
Great investing is a marathon,
not a sprint,

2094
01:58:07.690 --> 01:58:11.320
and little things that you may or may not be familiar with like automatic tax

2095
01:58:11.321 --> 01:58:13.450
loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

2096
01:58:13.630 --> 01:58:17.950
cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large

2097
01:58:17.951 --> 01:58:21.670
amounts of money over longer periods of time.
Wealthfront,
as I mentioned,

2098
01:58:21.671 --> 01:58:24.280
since it's using software instead of retail locations,

2099
01:58:24.281 --> 01:58:28.450
etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely

2100
01:58:28.451 --> 01:58:29.980
impossible right off the bat,

2101
01:58:30.130 --> 01:58:32.500
you never pay commissions or account fees for everything.

2102
01:58:32.501 --> 01:58:37.501
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for

2103
01:58:38.141 --> 01:58:40.150
free.
If you use my link,

2104
01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:45.180
wealthfront.com/tim that is less than $5 a month to invest a $30,000 account for

2105
01:58:45.851 --> 01:58:46.960
instance.
Now,

2106
01:58:46.961 --> 01:58:50.530
normally when I have a sponsor on this show is because I use them and recommend

2107
01:58:50.531 --> 01:58:52.120
them.
In this case,
it's a little different.

2108
01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:56.440
I don't use Wealthfront yet because I'm not allowed to.
Here's the deal.

2109
01:58:56.680 --> 01:59:00.700
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of sec regulations,

2110
01:59:00.910 --> 01:59:04.390
companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials.

2111
01:59:04.391 --> 01:59:07.180
So I couldn't be a user end have them on the podcast,

2112
01:59:07.690 --> 01:59:11.320
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant

2113
01:59:11.321 --> 01:59:15.160
amount of my own money,
at least for me,
uh,
in the team and the company itself.

2114
01:59:15.190 --> 01:59:18.220
So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client.

2115
01:59:18.430 --> 01:59:21.820
Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

2116
01:59:21.850 --> 01:59:25.660
you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account.

2117
01:59:26.050 --> 01:59:28.660
But just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you.

2118
01:59:28.720 --> 01:59:32.500
Take two minutes,
fill out their questionnaire@wealthfront.com forward slash.

2119
01:59:32.501 --> 01:59:35.980
Tim It's fast,
it's free.
There's no downside that I can think of.

2120
01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:37.480
Just take a look,

2121
01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:40.840
see what portfolio they would create for you and you can use that information

2122
01:59:40.841 --> 01:59:44.020
however you want.

Tim

2123
01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:50.500
this episode is brought to you by me undies.
If I'm not going commando,

2124
01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:51.820
I'm in the Andes.

2125
01:59:51.821 --> 01:59:55.870
I have been testing these underwear for three to four months now pretty much

2126
01:59:55.871 --> 02:00:00.871
every day and in fact throughout bunch of my other underwear this morning and on

2127
02:00:01.121 --> 02:00:06.040
the road in the house,
they are extremely comfortable.
They look good,
feel good.

2128
02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:10.090
They are made of micro model two times softer than cotton and scientifically

2129
02:00:10.091 --> 02:00:13.810
tested using the call.
Bottom method sounds very fancy of course,

2130
02:00:14.140 --> 02:00:17.710
and I get a lot of compliments from ladies for these.
You don't get diaper butt,

2131
02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:19.570
you don't get the tired elastic band.

2132
02:00:19.870 --> 02:00:24.580
They look great and they have underwear for both men and women.

2133
02:00:24.581 --> 02:00:28.290
Check out [inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim and you can see everything that

2134
02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:31.450
I've been wearing.
They're ridiculous to the sublime.
Everything in between,

2135
02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:34.030
including my favorite,
which is called out.

2136
02:00:34.300 --> 02:00:37.570
And I would be remiss if I didn't mention their lounge pants.

2137
02:00:37.571 --> 02:00:38.830
This is a new thing,

2138
02:00:38.890 --> 02:00:41.890
and I've been wearing their lounge pants when I record podcast.

2139
02:00:42.130 --> 02:00:45.400
I've been wearing them out and about when I'm walking the dog meeting people for

2140
02:00:45.401 --> 02:00:49.270
coffee.
And they are extremely comfortable.

2141
02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:52.540
They're made from the same material as the underwear,
but some of them,

2142
02:00:52.541 --> 02:00:54.520
like the blue ones,
I have have pockets.

2143
02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:59.290
So you can walk about without seeming like you're off of your meds and

2144
02:00:59.291 --> 02:01:04.000
completely crazy.
So that is awesome.
And if you're not happy with the first pair,

2145
02:01:04.001 --> 02:01:07.180
you try on ice in that first of the underwear,
they'll refund you completely.

2146
02:01:07.181 --> 02:01:08.770
And you can keep the pair you tried on for free.

2147
02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:10.000
But if you're that kind of person,

2148
02:01:10.180 --> 02:01:12.650
you should be ashamed because that's disgusting.
Uh,

2149
02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:17.050
Mandy's dot com forward slash Tim,
check it out.
And until next time,

2150
02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:18.310
thank you for listening.

2151
02:01:24.590 --> 02:01:24.640
<v 0>Yeah.</v>
