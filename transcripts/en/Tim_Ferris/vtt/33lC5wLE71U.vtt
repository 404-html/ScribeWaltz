25
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.190
Hello ladies,
gents.

26
00:01:45.191 --> 00:01:49.540
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

27
00:01:49.541 --> 00:01:54.490
I deconstruct world class performers to figure out what makes them tick.

28
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.480
And Moreover,
what are the tools,
tricks,
tactics,

29
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.610
routines,
books,

30
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.770
whatever secret snacks that you can replicate that you can actually use in your

31
00:02:05.771 --> 00:02:10.771
daily life or in your career or in your personal endeavors and your journey into

32
00:02:10.991 --> 00:02:14.290
life itself.
Wow,
that was profound.
Anyway,

33
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.330
my guest for this episode is just a tremendous,
a tremendous man.

34
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.980
Uh,
he is an actor,
writer,
director,
and producer.
His name is Jon Favreau.

35
00:02:23.981 --> 00:02:28.360
I've been hugely impressed by John and we've had an opportunity to spend some

36
00:02:28.361 --> 00:02:30.640
time together.
He is a man of many talents.

37
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.490
He burst onto the acting scene with his role in Rudy.

38
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.900
Then he established himself as a writer with the iconic cult hit swingers in

39
00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:40.180
which you starred and many of you have seen it.

40
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.460
We have a lot of stories about swingers,

41
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.790
which I was surprised by and I had done a lot of homework.

42
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.630
Then Fabro made his feature film directorial debut with made,

43
00:02:49.631 --> 00:02:54.480
which you also wrote and produced his other directing credits include Ironman,

44
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.690
Ironman to cowboys and Aliens Elf.
And that was a real turning point for him.

45
00:02:58.691 --> 00:03:02.630
So we into that.
And I did not know that he was involved with Alf,
uh,

46
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.780
before I really dug into it as a threat.
And Chef,
which he wrote,
produced,

47
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:12.490
directed and starred in.
And the way he approached making chef was very,

48
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:13.420
very fascinating.

49
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:17.950
And as someone who's trying to create myself in more than one way,

50
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:22.951
I suppose I'm creating books and podcasts and now TV shows and I have news

51
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:25.540
coming related to that.
I was very,

52
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:28.450
very interested in how he approached doing chef,

53
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.140
which I fell in love with and that that's actually how I ended up connecting.

54
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.880
It was through chef and I went on Twitter and then we connected,
had a,

55
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.520
a sh a short exchange on Twitter.

56
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:43.360
And we also ended up investing in a couple of startup companies together.
Okay.

57
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:45.880
So lots of commas.
This guy does everything.

58
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.870
Some of his recent acting credits include the wolf of Wall Street and identity

59
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:53.290
thief and he's done much,
much more.
Uh,

60
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.320
he is currently directing the live action feature film that I'm dying to see

61
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:03.400
because I'm obsessed with the jungle book.
This is Disney's adaptation,

62
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.720
which is set to be released in April,
2016.

63
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:12.450
So without further ado,
I invite you into the mind and story,
uh,

64
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.050
some of which are very funny.
The stories of John [inaudible].

65
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.140
John,
welcome to the show.
Thank you.
Thank you so much for taking the time.

66
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.140
I've really been looking forward to this.
Okay.

67
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.420
And I suppose we could start perhaps at the beginning and one of these questions

68
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:36.691
that I like to sometimes ask is what albums or bands you listen to in high

69
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:40.840
school?
What were your go to?
What was her going to music?

70
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.550
<v 2>Uh,
let's see.
I liked the earliest music I listened to</v>

71
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.370
that I can remember actually having like an album of was I remember the animal

72
00:04:53.371 --> 00:04:57.840
house soundtrack,
all the old music,
like the 60s sure.
Music.

73
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.820
And then,
um,
Billy Joel,
I grew up in New York,
so Billy Joel,

74
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.470
uh,
and my first rock album I ever bought was a,
was led Zeppelin,

75
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.880
was led Zeppelin.
I was in housing,
I was in high school already.
And then I was,

76
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.200
I was in high school in the 80s.

77
00:05:13.201 --> 00:05:16.860
So then you had like the Ramones around in New York and Queens where I'm from.

78
00:05:16.861 --> 00:05:20.870
So it was,
uh,
it was an interesting time.
And then I,
you know,

79
00:05:20.871 --> 00:05:24.180
there's a little bit of overlap with CBGBS as I got older in high school,

80
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.050
but that was more for the scene because it was cool rather than the music
itself,

81
00:05:28.051 --> 00:05:29.790
which I don't find myself listening to too much.

82
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.170
<v 1>I ended up getting into Billy Joel Myself.
I was always in Metallica,</v>

83
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.011
sort of heavy metal head,

84
00:05:35.011 --> 00:05:39.060
and I got him to Billy Joel because I was a busboy and waited on him at 1.0

85
00:05:39.061 --> 00:05:43.170
really?
On Long Island.
And he was the coolest.
Oh,
that's nice guy I'd ever met.

86
00:05:43.171 --> 00:05:45.930
He would buy a cup of coffee and give me a 20 as a tip,

87
00:05:45.931 --> 00:05:48.540
which was a lot of moments me at the time.
That's a big,

88
00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:51.240
that's a good thing to remember.
It was a big deal either way.

89
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.680
<v 2>Yeah,
that's,
that's pretty good.
That's not an,
you know,</v>

90
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.810
in the greater scheme of things,
you could probably afford it,

91
00:05:56.811 --> 00:05:58.070
but made it made a big

92
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.740
<v 1>difference.
Look at that.
Look at each impression made you made a fan of you.</v>

93
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.580
I still,
I still remember it because it's,

94
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.550
that gets you remember how now when a we,

95
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.650
we may not have the same exact frame of reference.
What are you,
um,

96
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.880
I'm 48 years old,
so I'm a 10 behind roughly.
I'm 37 right now.

97
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.660
So that was a golden oldie.
Uh,
you were listening to me old ways.
Right,
right.

98
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.160
I was,
he was still recording when I was,
uh,
when I was listening to him.
Yeah.

99
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.640
He was still,
I mean everyone there,

100
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.640
the hush came over all the wait staff when he came in.
Yes.

101
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.200
And Long Island especially kinda absolutely up in Montauk.
And the,

102
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:28.880
I remember the weeders named Gavin,

103
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.980
he was supposed to wait the table and he said,
all right,

104
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.540
I'm going to do you a favor today.
Ferris.

105
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.260
I'm going to give you that table because he knew you get brought out so hard.

106
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:40.700
Yeah,
exactly.
What was your experience in,
in high school?

107
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.350
What was it like?
Can you paint a picture?

108
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.610
<v 2>Um,
let's see.
I was,</v>

109
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:51.370
I had just gone to a Bronx High School of science,

110
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.960
which was a,

111
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.040
a public school that you have to take a test for in New York who's a very good

112
00:06:57.041 --> 00:07:00.680
school.
It had been around for awhile and uh,

113
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.320
and the New York public school system,
uh,
was,
was very good at the time.

114
00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:09.220
I think it still is,
if you're,
if you do well that you,

115
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.650
you will never outgrow this the public school system.

116
00:07:11.651 --> 00:07:15.960
There's always room for people who are,
who are,
uh,
you know,
have,

117
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:20.620
you know,
who required different education needs on,
in every way.

118
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.640
And I know my,
my dad was a public school teacher.
Um,
and,
and you know,

119
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.080
I feel pretty strongly about that system and,
uh,

120
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.350
especially having lived in other cities too.
Uh,
I really grew to appreciate it.

121
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.090
And the Bronx High School of science was,
was one of the flagship schools for,

122
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.500
uh,
the,
the,
is that Stuyvesant Brooklyn Tech,
uh,
you know,

123
00:07:41.501 --> 00:07:43.090
all of these free schools.
Uh,

124
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.120
but I did have to commute all the way from Queens to the Bronx.

125
00:07:46.121 --> 00:07:47.440
It was about an hour and a half each way.

126
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.610
But I was around other people who were more academically inclined,

127
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.910
but I also met people from every different borough and all different walks of

128
00:07:54.911 --> 00:07:56.460
life because the,
you know,
the,

129
00:07:56.461 --> 00:08:01.180
the one thing that unifies us was that we all pass this test.
Uh,

130
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:06.640
and,
and you'd have a lot of different socioeconomic backgrounds because again,

131
00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:07.570
it was a free school.

132
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:13.200
And so I had the good fortune of meeting the brightest from every community to

133
00:08:14.381 --> 00:08:16.560
everybody that I met.
If I'm met a kid from Harlem,
he was the,

134
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.530
he was a really smart kid from Harlan find myself from Brooklyn,
from Riverdale,

135
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.350
you know,
so you really had all walks of life.

136
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.720
I didn't realize it at the time cause I grew up in New York.

137
00:08:25.721 --> 00:08:28.180
So diversity was just something you grew up with,

138
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.330
especially as you traveled through different boroughs.
You know,

139
00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:34.390
you just knew people from all over the place or if you worked in the city,

140
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:39.160
you met people from everywhere.
Uh,
and,
and you know,
that was a,

141
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.190
I think that was a good experience too.
You learn a little bit.
I know you're,
you,

142
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.100
you would like to speak a lot of languages.

143
00:08:45.101 --> 00:08:48.220
You get to know how to curse in every language and usually you pick up first

144
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:54.550
Greek and uh,
it,
uh,
in,
in Spanish.
And so,

145
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.890
but it was seeing that a lot of great kids,
but they were kind of nerdy kids.

146
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.670
There weren't big on sports teams,
things like that.
The long commute time,

147
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:06.380
lot of a lot of homework.
Um,
so I,

148
00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.690
I early on the,

149
00:09:07.691 --> 00:09:10.860
the first thing from high school that I got into through that crowd was dungeons

150
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:11.490
and dragons.

151
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:16.490
That was something I was really into a then I kind of outgrew that a bit more

152
00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:18.870
socially than anything.
But I always like fantasy.

153
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:23.490
I always liked that swords and sorcery stuff and science fiction.
And then it,

154
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.460
then I moved more into,
cause remember I graduated in 84,

155
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.830
so it was the early eighties.
That's when also punk rock was,

156
00:09:30.831 --> 00:09:32.850
was kind of in its heyday and,

157
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.810
and there were a lot of clubs downtown that we're going strong that you could go

158
00:09:36.811 --> 00:09:39.180
to.
So,
and,
and we were from all the different boroughs.

159
00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:40.890
So we very comfortable going into Manhattan.

160
00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:43.320
That was kind of the central point for this was still in high school,

161
00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:48.090
still in high school.
Um,
never really was,
uh,
the,
the kids from the city,

162
00:09:48.091 --> 00:09:49.160
from Manhattan.
We're more the,

163
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:53.990
a little bit more socially advanced and can actually get into these year.
Yeah.

164
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.150
You know,
we're,
we're from the,
you know,
we're the bridge and tunnel crowd,

165
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.920
so we didn't really end up in the nightlife too much.
Uh,
but,

166
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.280
but you were exposed to it and you were going down to Greenwich village and

167
00:10:05.281 --> 00:10:07.510
hanging out in Washington square park and,
and,

168
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.820
and also that was a lot of when I got introduced to cinema because it was pre

169
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.440
VCR.
Uh,
the only way you'd see a movie as it was in a movie theater if it was on

170
00:10:16.441 --> 00:10:17.274
television.

171
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:22.640
And so I remember going to a lot of the revival houses first with my dad when I

172
00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:25.860
was younger and then,
and then,
you know,

173
00:10:25.861 --> 00:10:29.820
when I was in high school going on my own down to like the cinema village,
uh,

174
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.250
all around,
all around Nyu down there,

175
00:10:32.251 --> 00:10:36.630
there were a lot of great revival houses and seeing the films of like Kurosawa

176
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.030
Scorsese and,
um,

177
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.640
just being introduced to a lot of stuff I would not otherwise have access to.

178
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:46.700
Was there any particular film that was the inflection point for you wanting to

179
00:10:48.121 --> 00:10:52.650
focus on that craft herself?
I didn't want to do it till much later.

180
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.610
It was never a realistic option for me.
So all the way through high school,

181
00:10:56.611 --> 00:10:58.800
college,
it was never something that I thought I would do.

182
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.900
It wasn't until I was 22 that I actually decided to try and earnest to,

183
00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.380
to get into entertainment,
but I always enjoyed acting and I would love movies.

184
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.640
Uh,
and I was an usher actually during high school at an old,
uh,

185
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:16.410
x Vaudeville House,
the Rko,
Keith's and flushing.
And,
and as,
uh,
as an usher,

186
00:11:16.411 --> 00:11:19.140
you got to see movies over and over again.

187
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:23.400
And it was still the architecture,
the projection room,

188
00:11:23.401 --> 00:11:26.130
all of it really felt like something out of a time machine.

189
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.530
So I was exposed to that side of the movie business first.
And,
uh,

190
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:34.980
and it was,
you know,
it was really cool.
I liked it.
I like movies.

191
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:38.260
It was an old rundown theater.
It's not there anymore.
Uh,

192
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.840
but it was really wonderful seeing the kind of could see the history of it if

193
00:11:42.841 --> 00:11:43.890
you look behind the curtain,

194
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:47.820
because first it was an old Vaudeville palace and then it started showing films

195
00:11:47.821 --> 00:11:51.390
and then,
and then eventually it got broken up into a triplex.

196
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.570
So you had this beautiful,
elegant,
Morrish style,

197
00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.910
uh,
just,
you know,
again,
the movie palaces of,
of,
of the,

198
00:12:00.911 --> 00:12:04.170
of the Vaudeville era and the postwar Avalara,
uh,

199
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.170
broken down into the multiplexes that didn't have a lot of personality back in

200
00:12:08.171 --> 00:12:11.320
the,
in the 80s,
I guess the 70s started that.

201
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:16.210
But it still had some of the gloss of it and some of the beauty and,

202
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.261
but you know,

203
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:19.920
of course they were still the dressing rooms from the Vaudeville days and there

204
00:12:19.921 --> 00:12:24.730
were sub basements and he went behind the screen and the big theater and you
saw,

205
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:29.530
you know,
all the ropes and rigging from it's,
it's live theater days.

206
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.520
So it was Kinda,
it was Kinda nice and there was a sense of nostalgia,

207
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:37.730
but it was also just overrun by mice and it wasn't just,

208
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.630
it wasn't well maintained.
So there was a sadness to it.

209
00:12:40.631 --> 00:12:44.050
So those I haven't nostalgic field towards the movie business even from,

210
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.430
you know,
even from before I was around because I was exposed to all that stuff.

211
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:52.460
And of course all the movies keep,
keep the legacy alive as well.
And,

212
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.300
and that was part of the fun part about coming out here.

213
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.150
Even when I was just auditioning for the first time,

214
00:12:58.151 --> 00:13:01.870
for forbid parts you would audition on the lot,
you would go,

215
00:13:01.871 --> 00:13:04.900
you'd get a drive on and then you'd be walking around like the Fox lot and see

216
00:13:04.901 --> 00:13:08.440
the New York streets or Warner brothers and see all the backlots as you're

217
00:13:08.441 --> 00:13:12.700
walking from your parking to the appointment and you just felt so lucky to be in

218
00:13:12.701 --> 00:13:16.210
the business,
you know,
you were like,
um,
um,
you know,
um,

219
00:13:16.211 --> 00:13:17.830
somehow connected to this industry.

220
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.830
And even though we were just like the guy sweeping up after the parade,

221
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.100
we still were,
you know,
what,
give up show Biz,
you know,

222
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.890
even the guy shoveling after the elephant,
it feels like he's part of the show.

223
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.210
And I,
and I was that guy.
And you uh,
you dropped out of college,
is that right?

224
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.900
I did,
yeah.
It was well a misleading cause I took a,
I took a,

225
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.800
you took to go to,
I got a job offer,

226
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.250
we got a job offer to work on Wall Street.
Got It.

227
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.430
For our friend's dad who need to hire an assistant.

228
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.210
And I worked there for a year and a,
it wasn't a great fit for me,

229
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:52.300
but I had not been a great student in college.

230
00:13:52.301 --> 00:13:57.301
I had gone to a very academically oriented high school as I said.

231
00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.430
And then I was on the waiting list for Cooper Union to go to school for

232
00:14:00.431 --> 00:14:04.970
engineering.
Cooper Union is a great school in Greenwich Village that is,
uh,

233
00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.000
it's all scholarship.
It would have been a great,

234
00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:12.370
would have been a great fit for me.
And again,
my family was,
you know,

235
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.520
my,
my dad was a teacher,
so there wasn't a lot.

236
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:19.330
We have a lot of dough for a private education,
but the idea of Cooper Union,

237
00:14:19.331 --> 00:14:23.650
I would've gotten a great,
a great opportunity,
a waiting list,

238
00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.920
never got called up.
I ended up going to Queens College,
which was a city school,

239
00:14:26.921 --> 00:14:31.660
good school too.
Um,
and,
but never really found my footing.

240
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.650
What I wanted to do was more interested in the,
uh,

241
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:39.190
what was going on socially at school rather than academically.

242
00:14:39.191 --> 00:14:43.210
I didn't really have a major,
I didn't find myself excelling.
I got by,

243
00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.430
but um,
but I didn't excel.

244
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.550
And then after I'd worked for a year and went back to school,

245
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.650
then I got dean's list,
straight A's because that,

246
00:14:50.651 --> 00:14:52.130
that year of working in the real

247
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.160
<v 3>world really a seasoned me a bit.
And,</v>

248
00:14:55.161 --> 00:14:58.910
and I got me a,
I think matured me a bit.
And then,

249
00:14:58.911 --> 00:15:01.700
and then after I was back in school and back on the Dean's list,

250
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.480
that's when I went cross country and that's when I discovered,
uh,

251
00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:10.070
people doing improvisation in Chicago and decided I wanted to join that circus

252
00:15:10.071 --> 00:15:12.470
and that's when I dropped out.
Got It.
And the,

253
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.620
when you came back and were more seasoned and hit the Dean's list,

254
00:15:15.621 --> 00:15:20.180
was that because of the structure of working in the adult world or was it

255
00:15:20.181 --> 00:15:25.181
because you saw the benefits of focus rewarded and say,

256
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:30.410
uh,
accompany or uh,
well,
kind of the opposite of that.
I felt that,
that you,

257
00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:34.040
you,
it at school,
if you worked at all,
you got it,
you got recognized.

258
00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.400
There's every once in a while an asshole teacher that,
uh,
you know,

259
00:15:37.401 --> 00:15:39.470
busting my ass and the guy's still giving me bad grades.
Like,

260
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.110
but that's like a rarity usually if you are working,

261
00:15:42.111 --> 00:15:45.050
usually if you're not doing good in school,
you don't like the teacher.

262
00:15:45.051 --> 00:15:47.900
You're not,
you're not coming halfway,
you're not doing your job.

263
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:52.070
But if you do your work,
you'll get an a and there's something real,
you know,

264
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.490
really gala Terrian about that.
Whereas in the workspace you,

265
00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.170
you're expected to bust your ass and rarely do you get recognized for the work

266
00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:01.790
you do because somebody else's,

267
00:16:01.791 --> 00:16:05.480
either they are either oblivious because they're so hung up on what they're

268
00:16:05.481 --> 00:16:08.870
dealing with,
your boss or somebody else's,
the the,
you know,

269
00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:12.230
there's weird office politics or your just,

270
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:17.030
it's just expected of you to do your work.
So it,
it felt like a,

271
00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.530
a whiff of reality of the real world where it's not revolving around you.

272
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.770
Whereas in school,
even if you're part of a big lecture hall,

273
00:16:24.771 --> 00:16:27.950
at the end of the day it's about you.
You're the,
you're paying money to be there,

274
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.160
they're going to give you a grade based on the work you do.

275
00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:36.190
And it's focused around how you absorb and fit the work and how you fit into the

276
00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:39.650
system.
In the workplace workspace,

277
00:16:39.651 --> 00:16:44.300
you're a cog and you can figure out how to move your way up,

278
00:16:44.301 --> 00:16:48.410
but it's not incumbent upon them to recognize you.
You have to make your own way.

279
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.990
So it felt like a very,
a much,

280
00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.230
it felt like I was going back to a kinder,

281
00:16:54.231 --> 00:16:57.770
gentler situation when I went back to school where I put in the same work I

282
00:16:57.771 --> 00:17:01.610
would have,
uh,
at,
at,
you know,
on Wall Street.

283
00:17:01.611 --> 00:17:06.190
And then I was getting straight A's.
So it felt good,
but I also felt in,

284
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:10.970
in another way that it let some of the air out of the balloon that I got a whiff

285
00:17:10.971 --> 00:17:13.390
of what real life was,
what was waiting in the wings.

286
00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.870
It was kind of scary that it was like,
okay,

287
00:17:14.871 --> 00:17:19.520
now I'm going to work 50 weeks a year to get two weeks off and I'm going to live

288
00:17:19.521 --> 00:17:23.510
in those two weeks because pretty much everything happening during the week,

289
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:28.310
year,
either recovering over the weekends or your or your or your,
you know,

290
00:17:28.311 --> 00:17:32.480
you just,
everything's about getting ready for work.
I just came home from work,

291
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:38.360
uh,
uh,
decompressing and just getting back on the horse the next day.

292
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.670
And especially in Manhattan where you're,
you know,

293
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.330
I was commuting from the boroughs also.
Um,
and,
and,

294
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:49.260
and then I had gone cross country and seeing how everybody was living and I had

295
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.200
what sparked that cross country trip.
I think it was,

296
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:59.210
I think it was that I had worked for a year.
Right.
Um,

297
00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:04.220
and I'd save up enough money for a motorcycle and that was sort of a fantasy to

298
00:18:04.221 --> 00:18:08.930
go.
Yeah.
You watched like easy,
easy rider.
Why did,
that's the thing.
Oh man,

299
00:18:08.931 --> 00:18:12.770
you know.
Uh,
and so I went cross country and I was,
there was a,

300
00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:14.600
a motorcycle rally in Sturgis,

301
00:18:14.601 --> 00:18:19.280
South Dakota that happened to be lining up with when I wasn't in school or

302
00:18:19.281 --> 00:18:21.320
something.
I don't even remember.
I was still,
it was in school,

303
00:18:21.321 --> 00:18:24.890
it's going back many years now in the 80s.

304
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.870
But I remember saying,
Oh,
let me go check this out.

305
00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.090
And then once I was all the way in South Dakota,

306
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:36.970
I'm a girl I was dating at the time,
was in San Francisco and I,

307
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.690
it looked close on the map and I was like,

308
00:18:38.691 --> 00:18:43.220
let me just hear like it's only three and a half inches.
I'll never be closer.

309
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.580
Um,
and that's back when I was just thinking about the other day,

310
00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.950
it was back before you could just go online and get a map.

311
00:18:48.951 --> 00:18:52.820
Like you had to belong to like the AAA and trip tick something where they would

312
00:18:52.821 --> 00:18:55.640
send you maps with highlighters,
showing you the roots.

313
00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.150
So you had this map that was like folded up and your in your,

314
00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:03.320
in your saddlebag and you would look at it.
It really was like the old west.
And,

315
00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.440
you know,
you're like a,
an on horseback going cross country.

316
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:09.470
And it was such a long harrowing trip.

317
00:19:09.471 --> 00:19:14.471
And I remember how many people in the country look like they weren't enjoying

318
00:19:18.111 --> 00:19:22.010
themselves the way they live the way.
And some people were having a great time,

319
00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:25.010
but like there's,
there seem to be a lot of,
um,

320
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:30.370
variety in the way people lived and the lifestyles people had.

321
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:36.230
And I think also having grown up in a big city,
I didn't realize what,

322
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:40.360
what rural America was like and really how big the country was and how,

323
00:19:40.361 --> 00:19:45.220
how much variety there was.
And,
and also the other thing was how,
how,
uh,

324
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.480
personable people are.
And I,
you know,
here I was on a motorcycle.
Well,

325
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:53.520
I was young and I wasn't,
you know,
I,
I was not user friendly.
I didn't have the,

326
00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:57.470
you know,
Buckminster Fuller banker,
look,
I was,
you know,

327
00:19:57.471 --> 00:20:02.471
a guy climbing all covered with dust and young and New York plates on my bike.

328
00:20:02.571 --> 00:20:05.810
And,
and people were really cool to me.
Like people really,

329
00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:11.030
when if I broke down,
people help me out.
I helped other people out.
You know,

330
00:20:11.031 --> 00:20:14.930
you sort of develop a sense of how you fit into the world and how it's not about

331
00:20:14.931 --> 00:20:15.291
you.

332
00:20:15.291 --> 00:20:20.240
You're one little piece of the whole thing and you start to appreciate how big

333
00:20:20.241 --> 00:20:23.750
the world is and that you have to figure out how to fit into that.

334
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:27.110
Whereas I think your whole life,
especially where I was brought up,

335
00:20:27.111 --> 00:20:30.200
it's more about how does it fit into my world.

336
00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.350
So it's that perspective that,
you know,

337
00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.480
I think we all continue to struggle with as we get older.

338
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:39.020
How we fit into this whole thing,
how this whole,
it's not fair.

339
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.720
<v 4>Okay.</v>

340
00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.553
<v 3>Feeling is,</v>

341
00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.790
is one that you feel a lot more when you're young and when you're older there's

342
00:20:45.791 --> 00:20:49.450
something magical that motorcycles to being part of the environment as opposed

343
00:20:49.451 --> 00:20:54.451
to inside the bubble that is the chassis of the car would not recommend it by

344
00:20:55.751 --> 00:20:58.420
the way.
Very dangerous.
I W W I'm not,

345
00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:03.850
my buddy is in a wheelchair now who introduced me to it.
Uh,

346
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:04.691
it's,
it,

347
00:21:04.691 --> 00:21:09.220
it fits in really well with your sense of invulnerability that comes at that
age.

348
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.780
Uh,
not something I,
I would do.
I would thought if I could afford,
when I would,

349
00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:15.730
so let me just say to the people listening out there,

350
00:21:15.731 --> 00:21:19.750
I don't want to turn this into something where a proselytizing for it because

351
00:21:19.751 --> 00:21:24.040
it's not,
it's not something that I do anymore,
but it,
but it was definitely a,

352
00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:28.210
a bit of a,
a transcendent experience that you're flying and you're,

353
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:32.890
you are so vulnerable and so much,
uh,
you know,

354
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:37.240
they're there.
You're just,
you're just taking it in,
in a much different way.
It's,

355
00:21:37.241 --> 00:21:42.010
it's,
it's like a ride.
So I'm going to love to ask you about Chicago,

356
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.220
uh,
motorcycle.
Also,
just as a side note for folks,

357
00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:49.390
I totaled the bike and at that point sold it because I had a friend,

358
00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:54.010
gets a fantastic writer,
had a car,
run a red light,

359
00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.850
hit him at an intersection,
cutoff one of his legs and a,

360
00:21:57.851 --> 00:21:59.290
when your body is the bumper,

361
00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:03.820
my mom actually calls motorcycles donor cycles because she's been a PT for his

362
00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.900
30 plus years in injuries with perfect organs.
So,
uh,
and it's not the,

363
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.750
it's not the writer,
it's the people around you and,
and,
um,

364
00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.490
and under the right circumstances it's great.

365
00:22:12.491 --> 00:22:17.220
But the way I'm very fortunate that,
that I made it out,
uh,

366
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:21.010
intact because it's,
it's,
um,
bad odds.
You plant your plant,

367
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.820
your plants slots at the,
it's not,
it's not the best game.

368
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.620
That has nothing to do with how good you are as a writer,
like you said.

369
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.530
So dialing back the clock a little ways.
So,

370
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:31.360
and I won't spend too much time on this,

371
00:22:31.361 --> 00:22:33.520
but I was a runner up until about sixth grade,

372
00:22:33.521 --> 00:22:37.390
got the living hell beat out of me all the time and d and d was my refuge.

373
00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:42.620
So I still have all of my modules.
Um,
I'm one of those guys.
Uh,

374
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.940
now I'm completely self conscious about the fact that I played.
It's like,

375
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.880
it takes a lot for me to talk freely like this about it,

376
00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:53.740
but I feel like weird shame.
Why reason?
Why do you feel shame about it?

377
00:22:53.741 --> 00:22:55.090
I don't know.
I feel this,

378
00:22:55.091 --> 00:22:59.260
I kind of wear it as a badge of honor in a way because I run into so many people

379
00:22:59.261 --> 00:23:02.410
who,
who also had that shared experience.
Well,

380
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.470
I think I've grown into it like I think I'm accepting of it now,

381
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.050
but it was such a way I had been deaf,

382
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:11.710
defined myself for the first few years,

383
00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:15.610
like for like a freshman and sophomore year in high school.
And that was like,

384
00:23:15.611 --> 00:23:19.270
what?
And then when I didn't do it anymore.
You're so quick to say why,

385
00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:22.420
because I find that there's nothing more embarrassing than whatever the last

386
00:23:22.421 --> 00:23:26.600
phase you just went through was,
I continue to feel that way.
Yeah.
You know,

387
00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.620
thank God my life is not,
you know,
all the things that you have,

388
00:23:29.621 --> 00:23:31.780
ways you embarrass yourself,
all the haircuts you've had,

389
00:23:31.781 --> 00:23:33.730
the ways that you've addressed the music you listened to.

390
00:23:33.731 --> 00:23:37.930
I used to have a rat tail.
Exactly.
Years and now I'm of the age where,
you know,

391
00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.570
for,
for the,
the children's generation of this age,

392
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.170
that's all going to be well documented and very hard to escape.
Right.
Uh,

393
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:49.670
every single Facebook,
you know,
picture you put up will be there on some level.

394
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.140
Uh,
so,
but,
uh,
but I,
you know,
you're right.

395
00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:58.730
I think that there was,
um,
tremendous value in it.
I have an affection for it.

396
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.090
I remember too much of it.
Um,
you know,

397
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:06.380
it really took up a lot of my brain space,
uh,
when I was,

398
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.610
when I was around that age,
whatever,
15 or 14,
I forget what age I was playing.

399
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.280
Um,
but it also created

400
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:17.760
a set of skills,
I think.

401
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:22.760
I think it encouraged a set of skills that is not that on like,

402
00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.793
um,

403
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:29.400
a filmmaking because you're telling a story and the people who are experiencing

404
00:24:30.081 --> 00:24:31.790
that story,
especially if you're like a dungeon master,

405
00:24:31.791 --> 00:24:34.070
you're telling the story in a way that,
um,

406
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.040
where the people who are participating,

407
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:41.060
who've signed on are experiencing in a very subjective way,

408
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:45.680
and there appears to be a certain level of spontaneity or freewill and there is

409
00:24:45.681 --> 00:24:46.514
built into it.

410
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.680
But you're creating a context in a world and experience that's very,
uh,

411
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:52.100
specifically curated.

412
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.300
So you're guaranteeing a sort of experience regardless of what they do within
it.

413
00:24:56.301 --> 00:24:59.810
And I think when you're watching movies,
the,
the,
um,

414
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.250
the illusion is that your,
you,
you're,

415
00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.710
you're subjectively experiencing the film as an individual and your kind of

416
00:25:07.711 --> 00:25:12.711
making those decisions in a defacto way through the character that you're

417
00:25:12.871 --> 00:25:14.010
following the film through.

418
00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:18.690
If a character in a film ever makes a decision that the audience doesn't feel

419
00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:21.540
that they agree with it,
it changes the experience.

420
00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:24.600
It becomes like a horror movie where don't go in that room,
you know,

421
00:25:24.601 --> 00:25:27.630
it becomes a much different type of experience.
Or you're,

422
00:25:27.631 --> 00:25:30.520
or if you're watching a character that's,
um,

423
00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.560
that's not,
you know,
that you're watching because they're,

424
00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:40.100
they're an anti hero.
You know,
when you're watching Travis Bickle is,

425
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:43.060
is a different experience than most films because most films,

426
00:25:43.061 --> 00:25:46.630
you're going to walk through it,
experience the things that the characters do.

427
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:48.730
They're going to do a smarter version.

428
00:25:48.731 --> 00:25:52.150
Usually if something you would have done and they're going to be facing a lot of

429
00:25:52.151 --> 00:25:55.570
consequences and you're rooting for them because you and them or kind of writing

430
00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:59.080
next year you're,
you're the copilot of the,
of the protagonist.

431
00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:04.300
And in role playing games,
it's a similar experience but,

432
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:05.650
but a different medium.

433
00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.500
<v 1>Were you,
did you have a particular,</v>

434
00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.750
a race of preference where you a dwarf I uh,
on alcohol,

435
00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.850
those I didn't like the l so much.
I liked the dwarves,
like the hobbits.

436
00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.280
I was always a grail.
That makes sense for you.

437
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.660
I don't remember what's the gray is a great difference.
I just,

438
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.200
I like the wood ones.
Yeah.
They're also dro.

439
00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:29.380
I think the Dro Elf,
those were the dark elves,
the dark ones.
They were the,

440
00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.120
I remember more from the Tolkien stuff.

441
00:26:31.121 --> 00:26:33.490
Now it's sort of replaced it because I was in grade eight.

442
00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.310
They do blend together.
We do well,
yeah,
we're very close.

443
00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.590
But I liked the hobbits cause I read the book,
the Hobbit,

444
00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.890
and before I ever played

445
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.160
<v 3>the game,
it was an important book to me.
And I always liked,</v>

446
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:46.050
I kind of relate to the,
to,

447
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:50.790
to that character because he just wants to be comfortable and living in like the

448
00:26:50.791 --> 00:26:53.850
nice environment,
but then has drawn out into the adventure and then returns.

449
00:26:53.851 --> 00:26:58.650
It's very Joseph Campbell,
um,
that,
that reluctant hero.

450
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:03.030
And I think that that's a good metaphor for what I've experienced.
Is that the,

451
00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:07.100
you know,
I've never jumped into the stuff,
uh,

452
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:08.580
you know,

453
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:12.000
I guess I guess it may be there's been a little bit of boredom or unrest and

454
00:27:12.001 --> 00:27:15.930
earlier in my life,
but,
but generally I kind of like,

455
00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:20.310
I like some kind of things kind of boring,

456
00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.880
but then every once in a while I just,
there's a little bit of that,

457
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.810
that adventure blood in me that forces me out of it.

458
00:27:27.811 --> 00:27:30.330
I think we're different people from reading,

459
00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:35.040
knowing you have more self preservation instinct I think is worth complacency or

460
00:27:35.041 --> 00:27:39.300
something.
But I do it kind of in spite of who I am as opposed to,

461
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:43.500
because I'm,
I have this wanderlust and I,
and I can't sit still.

462
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:48.660
I just get bored sometimes and I want variety or I get,
um,

463
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.250
something,
uh,

464
00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:57.100
captures my fancy and I get really curious and want to try something new.
Uh,

465
00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:00.600
I'm an only child.
Uh,
I tend to do it more for me,

466
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.990
I find than to show other people.
I tend to be very,

467
00:28:03.991 --> 00:28:07.680
what does the itch that you're scratching would that,
that,

468
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:12.060
that novelty satisfies,
do you think?
Oh,
no.
You know,
uh,

469
00:28:12.061 --> 00:28:14.760
I think it's different as I get older because now it becomes about what

470
00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:18.630
impressions I had from younger in life and things,
you know,
on that checklist of,

471
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:22.680
you know,
how people buy the car that they never could afford.
Sure.
Later.
Or they,

472
00:28:22.681 --> 00:28:25.530
you know,
where they date the girl they couldn't date.
You know,

473
00:28:25.531 --> 00:28:29.160
there's a sense of,
of,
of,
uh,
somehow,
you know,

474
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:33.900
working on your scorecard.
But for me it's like,
um,
like I want,

475
00:28:33.901 --> 00:28:38.790
as I get older,
especially,
it's like I wanted to try to sculpt and I,

476
00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:43.050
and I started scrolling literally.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Literally like sculpting.

477
00:28:43.051 --> 00:28:46.650
And I'm lucky that I work with such talented people of all different diverse

478
00:28:46.651 --> 00:28:49.550
skillsets in the movie business.
Then when I want to sculpt,

479
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.840
I talked to somebody who's an expert sculptor,
sculptor,
and they,

480
00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.860
and they put together a little package from me of an analyst of tools I need.

481
00:28:55.861 --> 00:28:59.850
And,
and next thing you know,
without a lot of wasted time,

482
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.910
um,
I'm sculpting,
I always drew.
Yeah.

483
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.610
And I always would sculpt a little bit here and there,
whatever,

484
00:29:05.611 --> 00:29:10.080
if I was in like a class or playing with the kids play Doh and daddy was always

485
00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:13.230
good at,
at,
at making simplest step aside kid,

486
00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:17.550
I wish I had done a lot of,
you get a lot of,
you know,

487
00:29:17.551 --> 00:29:19.200
when you go to parent teacher day or whatever,

488
00:29:19.201 --> 00:29:21.540
the kids would bring that to school,
whatever that thing is.

489
00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:25.620
When daddy could make something cool out of playdough you get,
you get,
you know,

490
00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.840
restrict around the street cred.
Yeah.
Yeah.

491
00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:32.130
So what material were you or are you using on now?

492
00:29:32.131 --> 00:29:34.710
Chavon something called a shuttle launch is one of those.
Um,

493
00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:37.650
I think it's petroleum based or wax based,
uh,

494
00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:42.190
clays that doesn't dry and um,

495
00:29:42.191 --> 00:29:43.400
you have to heat up to get it.

496
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:46.840
You get these little blocks that look kind of like plastic explosives,
I guess.

497
00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.540
Kinda,
I know what you're talking about.
Yeah.
And uh,

498
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.320
it was developed I think for the automotive industry,

499
00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:53.350
so you get some really nice textures out of it and uh,

500
00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.110
it's just fun to do because you,
you're doing better than you thought.

501
00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.400
You could know why sculpture as opposed to I want it to be a comic book.

502
00:30:00.401 --> 00:30:04.380
Penciler for about 10 years.
A lot of illustration.
Why,
uh,

503
00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:09.550
why sculpture as opposed to something else?
Like water colors or,

504
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:13.540
oh,
I don't know.
There's something fun.
I did it

505
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:19.570
because you could,
uh,
give it to people.
Yeah.
Okay.
It's like a thing,

506
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.320
it's like a substantial thing that you have or you could display or you could

507
00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:28.120
give or,
or cast into a metal or,
I don't know.

508
00:30:28.121 --> 00:30:31.330
It just seemed kind of cool.
Uh,
I was,
I was messing around on the,

509
00:30:31.331 --> 00:30:33.920
on the set of jungle book with a,

510
00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:37.750
we had blocks of wax because there's a sequence where that we have a beat,

511
00:30:37.751 --> 00:30:42.250
big beehives that we had to cast and we had to cast it out of whack so it

512
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.920
interacted in a way that was realistic.

513
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.590
And so we had blocks and blocks of bees wax around.

514
00:30:47.591 --> 00:30:50.620
And so while I was on the set,
on the many hours sitting at the,

515
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:54.880
in the director's chair,
I had a block of wax sitting there for about a month.

516
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:59.250
And then next thing you know,
I,
I asked for something to carve it with it,

517
00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:00.790
it carve it with,

518
00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.910
and I got like some little carving tools and next thing you know,

519
00:31:03.911 --> 00:31:07.170
I was carving a bear.
And next thing you know,
it's like I pull over the,

520
00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:10.410
all these artists that are working on that.
So,
well,
what's,
how should I do?
Well,

521
00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.760
the bear,
the ears are a little far back.
Move this a little fun.

522
00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:16.020
And so I was getting pointers in everybody who had passed by.
Oh,

523
00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:18.070
it looks like a bear.
Yeah,
it's um,

524
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:22.600
a little bit of what a good boy am I and something have to see at this age.

525
00:31:22.601 --> 00:31:26.740
Honestly,
it's like,
um,
I'm very happy to be working in the field than I am.

526
00:31:26.741 --> 00:31:30.160
I feel like I'm learning constantly,
but I understand why.

527
00:31:30.161 --> 00:31:34.390
I think like nick naulty I heard like loves glassblowing.
Like I get it.

528
00:31:34.391 --> 00:31:38.800
I get why that's exactly the type of thing to be doing.
And I did actually,

529
00:31:38.801 --> 00:31:42.250
my experience was with cooking with you.
I've read your book,
by the way.

530
00:31:42.251 --> 00:31:45.190
I know we've told you this,
but let me tell you this on the,
I appreciate it.

531
00:31:45.191 --> 00:31:49.810
That task,
uh,
the f four hour chef,
uh,
when I was preparing to do chef,

532
00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:53.170
uh,
I always liked watching,
which blew my mind.
I've said,

533
00:31:53.171 --> 00:31:56.860
it's you and I've said it's on the Internet,
but I'm,

534
00:31:56.861 --> 00:31:59.470
we're going to dig into that.
Okay.
But we lovely moving.
Thank you.

535
00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:04.630
It was a great movie and important film for me cause it,
it,
it just,
you know,

536
00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:08.920
it allowed me to deal with themes that I felt were important,
but,

537
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:13.960
but also it gave me the excuse to learn from great chefs and work in the

538
00:32:13.961 --> 00:32:18.370
kitchens of great chefs to prepare for the acting in,
in,
in the film.

539
00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:23.200
And I loved cooking and I loved,
and I never,
Roy Choi the,
the,

540
00:32:23.201 --> 00:32:26.900
the chef who really was,
was my partner in this,
um,

541
00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.260
as he was preparing me when,
when we first started,
he said,
you'll,

542
00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:33.790
you'll a chef when a shop,
because he's telling me these things to teach me,

543
00:32:33.791 --> 00:32:38.230
but also to understand insight as I told the story to make the film one that he

544
00:32:38.231 --> 00:32:41.900
and the community would like.
He said,
when a chef sees a bag of shallots,

545
00:32:41.901 --> 00:32:46.040
they get excited because they're going to get to peel all the shallots and,
and,

546
00:32:46.041 --> 00:32:49.250
um,
which I thought was,
it was confusing at first.

547
00:32:49.251 --> 00:32:52.580
But then after going through the culinary training and everything,
there's some,

548
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:56.780
it's true.
There's something very meditative about preparing your meals.

549
00:32:56.781 --> 00:32:58.670
And plus because you,

550
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000
you're dealing with sharp implements and you have to get it perfect and you

551
00:33:04.311 --> 00:33:08.180
can't hurt yourself and you can't really do anything but this thing.

552
00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:11.600
But it doesn't require all of your brain at the same time.

553
00:33:11.601 --> 00:33:15.170
And so you get into this really cool zone where you,

554
00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:17.420
everything so thoughtful that you're doing,

555
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.950
and by the time you actually prepare a meal with all of this means that you

556
00:33:21.951 --> 00:33:23.540
prepare,
that you,
that you get ready.

557
00:33:23.541 --> 00:33:28.541
There's a tendency to be very tuned into what you're tasting or what you're

558
00:33:28.671 --> 00:33:33.440
presenting to your guests because they know the work they've been watching.

559
00:33:33.441 --> 00:33:38.000
You put work into it.
And so the mindfulness,
uh,

560
00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:42.650
that it implies and,
and,
and demands and its preparation,

561
00:33:42.651 --> 00:33:46.700
but it also asks of the people,
um,
who,

562
00:33:46.701 --> 00:33:50.720
who you're sharing it with.
Uh,
it,
it creates a,
um,

563
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:54.770
a nexus point of all the people where you're all sharing a common experience at

564
00:33:54.771 --> 00:33:59.210
one moment,
which,
uh,
is something I've grown to appreciate and,

565
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:04.130
and is a very elusive dynamic as,
as a dad.
It's,

566
00:34:04.131 --> 00:34:09.110
it's very,
you know,
being very,
very present as,
as you,
um,

567
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.940
you know,
spend time with your kids,

568
00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.600
making sure you're not checking your emails when you're tucking the kids in.

569
00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:17.280
You know,
it's,
and,
and with friends and,

570
00:34:17.281 --> 00:34:20.030
and as a husband there's a,

571
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:24.680
it's not something I did effortlessly a decade ago and it's something that I've

572
00:34:24.681 --> 00:34:28.820
grown into and I find that people as they mature,
they start to value that more.

573
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:32.240
And so everything that I looked to do,
whether it's sculpture or,
you know,

574
00:34:32.241 --> 00:34:34.670
I would be a glass blower.
I would love to play with that.

575
00:34:34.671 --> 00:34:36.920
It seems fascinating or,
uh,
you know,

576
00:34:36.921 --> 00:34:41.921
any of these hobby type things for the cooking is all about being very present

577
00:34:43.761 --> 00:34:46.970
in that moment.
And,
um,
and it's a good,

578
00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:53.320
it's a good counterbalance to the intensity with which I approached my,

579
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:54.600
the work

580
00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.940
<v 1>that I do.
I think the,</v>

581
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.480
the word mindfulness is so appropriate for cooking.

582
00:35:00.481 --> 00:35:04.950
And I found the what used to create so much stress,

583
00:35:04.951 --> 00:35:08.400
a such a stretch responds to me,
which was preparing food is now become,

584
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:09.511
like you said,

585
00:35:09.511 --> 00:35:13.710
almost this meditative practice where I could meditate in the mornings and I

586
00:35:13.711 --> 00:35:17.640
tend to do that.
But I also find that if I just make food,

587
00:35:17.641 --> 00:35:20.490
make dinner two or three times a week and you have these knives,

588
00:35:20.491 --> 00:35:22.950
so you have to be present,
state aware.
It's,

589
00:35:22.951 --> 00:35:26.220
it has a tremendous decompressing effect.
Um,

590
00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:30.150
are there any particular ingredients that you're playing with these days or

591
00:35:30.151 --> 00:35:30.940
anything?

592
00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:34.240
<v 3>Ever since I made chef and met Aaron Franklin down in Austin,</v>

593
00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:39.090
I've been over and over again refining,
uh,
my smoke brisket,

594
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:44.010
the central Texas south smoked brisket.
And to me that's like alchemy.
You know,

595
00:35:44.011 --> 00:35:45.040
it's,
it's,
there's tea,

596
00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:50.090
there's a certain amount of technique and the trimming and in the way you that,

597
00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:53.670
but mostly it's about leaving it alone.
It's almost like baking in that way.

598
00:35:53.671 --> 00:35:57.990
Like it's,
it's,
it's,
it's chemistry and changing little factors,

599
00:35:57.991 --> 00:36:01.260
but it's taking whatever it is,
14 hours to see how it turns out.

600
00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:04.020
There's something really rewarding about that.

601
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:06.690
And it's also a flavor that people don't get anywhere else.

602
00:36:06.691 --> 00:36:10.140
So when you do it right and people get to taste it,
it's,
it's kind of a fun,

603
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.870
it's kind of a fun thing to share because it's special and it's only,

604
00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:16.530
it's only good for a short amount of time to,
yeah,
it's,
you know,

605
00:36:16.531 --> 00:36:20.790
it's like a coffee and then it kind of goes away.
Uh,

606
00:36:20.791 --> 00:36:23.540
and then I like that.
I like,
um,

607
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:28.350
simple pasta dishes,
very simple ones.
You know,
like there's a,

608
00:36:28.351 --> 00:36:33.351
there's a pasta Scarpetta the restaurant Scarpetta mics are really good pasta.

609
00:36:34.051 --> 00:36:37.930
That's just in a tomato sauce that you could find online the recipe for.
But,

610
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:42.270
but making the pasta from scratch,
infusing the oil,
uh,

611
00:36:42.271 --> 00:36:47.271
starting the tomato sauce from Roma tomatoes that you blanch and peel and slow

612
00:36:47.911 --> 00:36:52.911
cook and mashed down into a sauce and then mixing it with the infused olive oil

613
00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:57.750
and then cooking that with the pasta water and getting the right texture.

614
00:36:57.751 --> 00:37:02.620
And again,
it's amazing,
but it's only good for just a few minutes.
And,

615
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:04.620
and then,
and there with the pasta dishes is great cause you,

616
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.460
you pulled together a group of people who are interested in doing it.

617
00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:10.460
It's a great thing to do.
Uh,

618
00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:14.130
if the family's all vacation someplace or you're over at a relative's house,

619
00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:17.260
especially because I have less and less things to talk about.
Cause my,

620
00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:21.450
my context is so different from everybody else's that,
you know,

621
00:37:21.451 --> 00:37:23.740
if we talk about movies it's not,
you know,
I'm,

622
00:37:23.741 --> 00:37:26.520
I'm thinking about other things than the people talking to me.

623
00:37:26.521 --> 00:37:29.100
We're thinking about,
uh,
and you know,
it's,

624
00:37:29.101 --> 00:37:33.840
there's so little overlap with most people that I meet that cooking is great

625
00:37:33.841 --> 00:37:38.841
because it creates this context where everybody is on equal footing and

626
00:37:38.911 --> 00:37:43.580
everybody has a different skillset and it becomes a real,
a,

627
00:37:43.581 --> 00:37:48.110
a task that you have to be,
you're interdependent with.
And,
and it,
it,

628
00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:53.100
I find I have an endless patience to spend time with people that I don't know

629
00:37:53.101 --> 00:37:56.940
very well if you're working on a really exciting cooking project.

630
00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:00.030
And then at the end we all serve it together and we really feel like we fought a

631
00:38:00.031 --> 00:38:02.670
war together.
Oh,
it's a,
it's a great,
it's a great bonding thing.

632
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:06.990
I'm working on a kitchen at my and my house that's geared towards having like

633
00:38:06.991 --> 00:38:10.550
groups of people cook that feels more like a restaurant style.
Big Table tops.

634
00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:15.750
Yeah.
On all like open shelving and you know,
everything that you'd see,

635
00:38:15.751 --> 00:38:19.680
you know,
beautiful in a way of restaurants.
Beautiful.
Not Beautiful for a house,

636
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:23.340
but,
but,
uh,
the people who like to cook,
it's like the perfect,
like a,

637
00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:28.320
like a lab and uh,
it's,
it's fun because you know,
you're all gathered around and,

638
00:38:28.321 --> 00:38:33.120
and uh,
uh,
I did it.
My experience,
I,
the first time I did it like that was at the,

639
00:38:33.121 --> 00:38:36.040
uh,
at the Skywalker ranch,
which is where we,

640
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:39.700
we mix the sound for a few movies.

641
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:42.670
I've been working with them I think since ironman.
Uh,

642
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.650
but for those of you who don't know,
it's,
it's a,

643
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:49.080
it's a 5,000 Acre ranch,
uh,

644
00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:50.860
in northern California,
in,
in,

645
00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:55.150
in Morin that George Lucas,
uh,

646
00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.480
put together and,
and,
and oversaw the architecture for.

647
00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:02.410
And it's a started off as just a sound facility.
Very high.
It's very,

648
00:39:02.411 --> 00:39:05.710
it looks very low tech.
It looks like a winery almost,
but beautiful.

649
00:39:05.711 --> 00:39:07.690
Rolling hills with cattle grazing,

650
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:11.080
a Victorian House on the hill that he's,

651
00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:14.130
where he does his editing and where he,
he,

652
00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:18.610
he uses his own base and other technical buildings that have cropped up around

653
00:39:18.611 --> 00:39:21.220
it.
And it's state of the art mixing facility.

654
00:39:21.221 --> 00:39:24.520
Sound facility are recording stages.
Um,

655
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:28.660
so it's this very strange and in a bunk house,
uh,

656
00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:31.930
with themed rooms for the people who,

657
00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:33.880
who work there because you,

658
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:38.230
you stay there when you work there because it's so remote.
And so each,

659
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:42.400
a room is themed for either a director or a writer and a,

660
00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:44.860
so you have like the John Ford Room,
that's western theme,

661
00:39:44.861 --> 00:39:47.380
the Akira Kurosawa Room,
Dorothy Parker Room.

662
00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:51.040
And so you stay there and during the day there are restaurants that are open on

663
00:39:51.041 --> 00:39:53.170
the facility at night.
Everything closes down,

664
00:39:53.171 --> 00:39:57.940
but there's a commercial kitchen in the common area and a walk in a walk in

665
00:39:57.941 --> 00:40:00.550
fridge.
And so as we were making chef,
you know,

666
00:40:00.551 --> 00:40:02.100
you're looking at these scenes over and over again,

667
00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:04.480
listening to the crackling of the,
you know,

668
00:40:04.481 --> 00:40:08.580
the frying food and the pasta and the olive oil and the,
the,

669
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:12.520
the garlic simmering and your,
your mouth watering all day.

670
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:16.990
And each night we would pick another,
a recipe from the movie and all of us,

671
00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:19.660
me and the editors,
the sound crew,
uh,

672
00:40:19.661 --> 00:40:24.550
we'd all get together and we cook together at night and we cook all the dishes

673
00:40:24.551 --> 00:40:29.020
from the movie.
And it was so much fun,
uh,
because here we're in the middle of,

674
00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:32.980
you know,
in the middle of nowhere,
really in a very remote spot.
And,

675
00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:35.830
and just together,
you know,
the fireplace gone,

676
00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:39.070
all of us cooking together and he'd sit down for the meal and you sleep good.

677
00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.680
And then we hit it the next morning and we would do the next real,

678
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:45.120
I like a hell of a hell of a routine that he was amazing.

679
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:46.210
It was really wonderful.

680
00:40:46.211 --> 00:40:48.640
So that's what I want to try to see if I could capture some of that at home.

681
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.730
Yeah.
The,
uh,
the,
uh,

682
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:54.610
the one thing that's always struck me about a well designed kitchen,

683
00:40:54.611 --> 00:40:59.170
it's just the elegance and the economy of movement that it provides for a chef.

684
00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:04.540
A where they're,
they're,
they're never reaching too far for anything.
Everything.

685
00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.150
I mean,
you have everything in its place or at the meet some plastic.
Right.

686
00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:12.450
And how quickly a good line cook or chef can work if they have all their items

687
00:41:13.511 --> 00:41:16.910
in the right place.
Yeah,
it's true.
It's,
uh,
it's interesting because I did it.

688
00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:19.690
Part of the training I did was working first.

689
00:41:19.691 --> 00:41:24.310
First I went to some pretty accelerated culinary training that Roy sent me to

690
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:26.350
off with a French chef,
uh,

691
00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:30.730
to get a context before I ever entered a professional kitchen.

692
00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:33.860
And so I went through all my mother sauces,
my knife cuts,

693
00:41:33.861 --> 00:41:38.180
and basically an overview of what the first year culinary students would deal

694
00:41:38.181 --> 00:41:41.020
with.
Then I got to come into his kitchen.

695
00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.430
He has a few different restaurants and food trucks too.

696
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.750
And I spent time a floating from restaurant to restaurant first they let me like

697
00:41:47.751 --> 00:41:51.980
prep cook.
So I was picking Parsley.
You know what I mean?
I've done that.

698
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:55.990
Micro Basil.
Yeah.
They're like your whole number station.
Ferris.
I'm like,
Oh God.

699
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:59.510
Because it's all about trust you with and it's so like labor intensive.

700
00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:03.890
And so you finally do that.
And then,
uh,

701
00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:08.630
then eventually I worked my way up to the hotline and on the hotline.

702
00:42:08.631 --> 00:42:12.530
Then I started working and then,
and then I worked the pretty,

703
00:42:12.531 --> 00:42:15.980
but midway through I started working on one of his Kogi trucks and it reminded

704
00:42:15.981 --> 00:42:16.250
me,

705
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:19.940
cause there you're in tight quarters to you reminded me very much a bartending,

706
00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:22.650
which is what I did,
uh,
to make a living,
uh,

707
00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:26.180
in college and after college when I moved to Chicago as a bartender.

708
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:30.620
And you know,
there's that dynamic of,
of getting in the weeds.

709
00:42:30.621 --> 00:42:33.500
It's kind of halfway between being a chef and being,
uh,
uh,

710
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:36.200
a server because you're preparing things,

711
00:42:36.201 --> 00:42:38.480
but you're also dealing with the public and you're not doing anything that

712
00:42:38.481 --> 00:42:42.980
complicated.
So you don't have the,
um,
there's not the elegance of,

713
00:42:42.981 --> 00:42:46.970
of being a chef,
at least the type of bartender I was.
I wasn't like a mixologist.

714
00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:50.990
Uh,
like you see now,
but uh,
but there is this,

715
00:42:50.991 --> 00:42:55.040
you do get into the weeds and you have to do this dance with the people in a

716
00:42:55.041 --> 00:42:56.240
very small space.

717
00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:00.050
And I found that that rhythm was coming back to me as I was working,

718
00:43:00.051 --> 00:43:03.530
especially on that truck.
We know how to get out of the way.
You pop in,

719
00:43:03.531 --> 00:43:07.550
you pop out,
you reach around,
uh,
on somebody who's left on there,
right?

720
00:43:07.551 --> 00:43:08.384
You're behind them,

721
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:11.630
you're not crashing into each other and you're helping each other out and you

722
00:43:11.631 --> 00:43:15.650
become like this big octopus together.
And when you're working on the hotline,

723
00:43:15.651 --> 00:43:18.980
it's even more that way because there's,
you know,
behind you,
you know,

724
00:43:18.981 --> 00:43:21.800
there's like hot food coming through.
People are speaking different languages.

725
00:43:21.801 --> 00:43:25.580
You're,
um,
you're being asked to do things,
you're being instructed to.

726
00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:26.510
That's the other weird thing.

727
00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:29.360
It's not like they prepare you ahead of time and say,

728
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:31.670
here's how you make everything.
Let's train.

729
00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.220
Maybe when you first open a restaurant,
it's that way.

730
00:43:34.221 --> 00:43:36.410
But when you're working in a,
in an established kitchen,

731
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:41.750
they basically just throw you on the line and then the rush comes and then they

732
00:43:41.751 --> 00:43:44.750
show you once how to do something and then you just copy them and maybe they

733
00:43:44.751 --> 00:43:48.530
show it to you again.
And then the chefs watching you from a distance and saying,

734
00:43:48.531 --> 00:43:52.070
hey,
you only put Mayo on one side of the bond that goes on both,
you know,

735
00:43:52.071 --> 00:43:55.700
there's a certain quality control aspect that the chefs,

736
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:57.010
that's really what the chef's job is,

737
00:43:57.011 --> 00:44:00.350
is overseeing other people doing the work and keeping the standards to a certain

738
00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:06.080
consistency.
And so there was,
you know,
working and little by little,
you know,

739
00:44:06.081 --> 00:44:06.621
first it's,

740
00:44:06.621 --> 00:44:11.510
I'm just doing the popcorn at a frame and then then I'm next seen on pulling the

741
00:44:11.511 --> 00:44:13.370
burgers out or doing the,
you know,

742
00:44:13.371 --> 00:44:15.740
assembling some sandwiches and next thing you know,
and plating.

743
00:44:15.741 --> 00:44:19.190
And so by the end of the Saturday dinner rush,
you know,

744
00:44:19.191 --> 00:44:21.780
there's a half dozen played,

745
00:44:21.781 --> 00:44:25.610
some helping with and you start to appreciate how good these other people are.

746
00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.300
You know,
the people who work the broiler or the Saute Cook,

747
00:44:29.301 --> 00:44:32.280
you know who the grill station is,
just nailing them.
You know,

748
00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:35.850
it was making it perfect and timing it just right.
And then,

749
00:44:35.851 --> 00:44:39.540
and then the one that I remarked at the most was the,
was the,

750
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.630
was the bus boy who knows,
just went to walk up to you with that,

751
00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.850
with that Deli container full of ice water and like that's the best water you've

752
00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:49.230
ever had.
Like I didn't even know I was thirsty.

753
00:44:49.231 --> 00:44:53.330
And then this guy hands me this like 16 hours,
you know,
the court size,
you know,

754
00:44:53.331 --> 00:44:55.830
like you'd get wonton soup in that clear container.

755
00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.700
So those are all over kitchens,
right?
Those,
the Deli containers and they,

756
00:44:59.701 --> 00:45:03.630
they'll give you one full ice water and you'll drink it in like one sip and it's

757
00:45:03.631 --> 00:45:07.560
the best thing you've ever had in your life.
And,
um,

758
00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:11.040
and as I was mentioning that to Roy,
he says,
yeah,
you're ready to make the movie.

759
00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:15.210
That's not how you found that,
that experience is what,
how,
I know you're ready.

760
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:17.970
So speaking of,
of moments,
uh,

761
00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:22.440
when did you decide to write chef?

762
00:45:22.441 --> 00:45:26.020
I'd love to talk a little bit about the writing process.
Chef chef was okay,

763
00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:30.050
now remember,
I,
you know,
it's Kinda hard out of context with,

764
00:45:30.051 --> 00:45:33.500
with what the swingers experience was kind of weaker.
Well,

765
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:37.110
let's talk about both what swingers it was,
um,
that I had,

766
00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:41.660
I had not known I was going to be a writer.
I had received from my dad,
uh,
um,

767
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:42.510
final draft,

768
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:47.510
which was a program that is pretty user friendly and formats you're writing to

769
00:45:47.851 --> 00:45:50.040
look like a screenplay.
And,
and,

770
00:45:50.041 --> 00:45:54.480
and for people who are writers or want to be writers,

771
00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:56.760
a lot of it is,
um,

772
00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:00.720
there are subtle things that once like a,

773
00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:02.820
let's say a job like a resume for a job,

774
00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:06.300
there are certain standards by how you're going to put that together so that

775
00:46:06.301 --> 00:46:09.570
when somebody receives that resume,
it looks professional.
The formatting,

776
00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:14.280
the formatting,
all that stuff.
I don't know that much about just regular jobs,

777
00:46:14.281 --> 00:46:16.830
but,
but I know like a lot of effort goes into the resume,

778
00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:20.970
a headshot for an actor for a screenplay.
As people received the script,

779
00:46:20.971 --> 00:46:24.810
they're making a lot of little subconscious calculations and decisions about you

780
00:46:24.811 --> 00:46:27.860
based on what they're seeing.
And,
uh,

781
00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:31.440
the screenplay that's not formatted properly is something that's completely

782
00:46:31.441 --> 00:46:34.620
dismissed.
Uh,
and what was fun was when I received the program,

783
00:46:34.621 --> 00:46:36.060
I just typed a little bit.
Next thing I know,

784
00:46:36.061 --> 00:46:39.240
it looked just like a real screenplay and I've read enough of them for being an

785
00:46:39.241 --> 00:46:43.680
actor.
And this was after I had already done Rudy.
I had moved to Los Angeles.

786
00:46:43.681 --> 00:46:45.150
I thought that was going to be my big break,

787
00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:47.760
but things weren't really popping for me.

788
00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:51.470
But I had read enough scripts and knew enough about acting to um,

789
00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:56.240
feel comfortable tapping away the screenplay.
Never thinking it was going to,

790
00:46:56.250 --> 00:47:00.190
anything was gonna happen with it more to show my friends and you know,
you type,

791
00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:02.820
you type for half hour an hour,
two hours,

792
00:47:02.821 --> 00:47:07.620
next thing you know you've got like a stack of eight pages and it feels like

793
00:47:07.621 --> 00:47:10.560
you've got a piece of a screenplay there.
And so then it becomes like,

794
00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:13.420
I just want to try this.
You know,

795
00:47:13.421 --> 00:47:16.380
it kind of goes back to the earlier conversation we're having about why,

796
00:47:16.381 --> 00:47:20.700
why do you,
why do you do things,
you know,
uh,
for you,

797
00:47:20.701 --> 00:47:22.640
it's that you can't sit still and you're,

798
00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.730
it's part of it and you're super curious and you've got a lot of energy and you,

799
00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.040
you kind of hunger for it.
I think with me it's,
it's,

800
00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:30.010
it's a little bit more erratic than

801
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.210
<v 2>that where I just get,</v>

802
00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:35.380
I just get some bites me in the ass and I want to try something.

803
00:47:35.381 --> 00:47:39.580
Like I'm just curious about something if I could do something,
but it's,
um,

804
00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:45.400
it's much subtler and I just tap away at it and peck away at it and then it

805
00:47:45.401 --> 00:47:49.450
starts to look good.
And as it looks better,
you start to build up.
Um,

806
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:53.160
like with doing sculpture,
like messing around a little bit.
Next thing you know,

807
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:55.450
it kind of looks like a bear.
Well let me carve it a little bit better.

808
00:47:55.451 --> 00:47:58.630
Let me try a little bit more.
Let's see how far I could take this thing.
And,

809
00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:02.650
and so with the screenplay,
it was kind of like that and uh,
showed it,

810
00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:03.180
some friends

811
00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.410
<v 3>showed it to the acting agent.</v>

812
00:48:04.411 --> 00:48:07.860
I had people felt good about the swingers screenplay and then we,

813
00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:11.130
how long did it take you to get it to a first draft?

814
00:48:11.131 --> 00:48:13.590
Let's just say very fast because there was no pressure.

815
00:48:13.591 --> 00:48:15.690
I didn't have any an have any,
I wouldn't,

816
00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.030
I would outline maybe a few pages ahead of where I was.

817
00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:20.550
I came from an Improv background from Chicago,

818
00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:23.370
so it was really just characters talking to each other.

819
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:27.720
The improv that I did was something called the Herald,
which was a del close.

820
00:48:27.721 --> 00:48:28.380
It invented,

821
00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:33.180
it was a great improv teacher and she'll herald the herald like the name.
Okay.

822
00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:36.210
Got It.
And it was one of those things like what do you call it,
Harold?
You know,

823
00:48:36.211 --> 00:48:39.810
it was one of those,
that's how it got its name.
I like the Beatles haircut.

824
00:48:39.811 --> 00:48:44.430
I think I got it.
Had a name,
I forget what the name was.
Uh,
but,

825
00:48:44.431 --> 00:48:47.130
but there's uh,
it's long form.

826
00:48:47.131 --> 00:48:52.131
So you would start off and take one suggestion and do three different scenes

827
00:48:52.771 --> 00:48:54.660
with different characters that were unrelated,

828
00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:57.570
all inspired by this one suggestion.

829
00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:01.500
And then you would have three beats of those scenes and by the end they would

830
00:49:01.501 --> 00:49:06.501
all interweave and connect and come to some greater statement about the,

831
00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:13.020
the um,
the suggestion.
Then just a short form joke,
uh,

832
00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:15.600
oriented improvisational skit wood.

833
00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:21.170
So it's looking to bring Improv into revealing it as a higher form to reveal

834
00:49:22.771 --> 00:49:27.000
greater truths about,
about the suggestion by forming group mind with a,

835
00:49:27.001 --> 00:49:29.910
a team of improvisors who are used to working with one another.

836
00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:34.380
And that was the aspiration for that.
But it did give me a,
a set of skills.

837
00:49:34.381 --> 00:49:37.650
Having done that in Chicago for a while,
that you know,
your self editing,
your,

838
00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:41.970
you knowing what each scene should end,
you're bringing the next scene to begin,

839
00:49:41.971 --> 00:49:45.960
maybe after some time has passed or with a plot point that had occurred.

840
00:49:45.961 --> 00:49:48.810
And you know,
you're,
you're learning story,
you're learning story,

841
00:49:48.811 --> 00:49:52.830
the hardware you're learning story in front of a bar full of people who paid $4

842
00:49:52.831 --> 00:49:55.650
to be in there and they want to be entertained and laugh.

843
00:49:55.890 --> 00:50:00.000
But the laughter doesn't last if there's no story stories,

844
00:50:00.001 --> 00:50:02.280
the king and you know,
you think it's about the last.

845
00:50:02.281 --> 00:50:07.070
But really it's about investing in the story being drawn in.
And um,
and so I,

846
00:50:07.071 --> 00:50:11.310
I guess I had enough skills from that and also read enough screenplays and maybe

847
00:50:11.311 --> 00:50:12.630
the dungeon and dragons and stuff,

848
00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:17.820
<v 2>storyteller,
knowing how to create a little bit of a world that,
uh,</v>

849
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:21.280
<v 3>you know,
here,
here I was,
uh,</v>

850
00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:25.110
unfolding the story about this group of friends in Hollywood,

851
00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:27.980
a set in the same world.
I lived in a,

852
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:32.060
I had broken up or have been broken up with at the time about a year earlier.

853
00:50:32.061 --> 00:50:35.660
So I was still,
that was fresh in my mind.
So that was one of the characters,

854
00:50:35.661 --> 00:50:39.680
dilemmas.
And although it wasn't really a autobiographical,

855
00:50:39.681 --> 00:50:42.470
there were enough things that I could draw from.
You know,

856
00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:45.410
what's the expression from Glengarry Glen Ross?
Always tell the truth.

857
00:50:45.411 --> 00:50:48.050
That's the easiest thing to remember.
Yeah.
Draw upon,
you know,

858
00:50:48.051 --> 00:50:49.030
if you're gonna talk about neighborhood,

859
00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.930
talking about the neighborhood you grew up and talk about the neighborhood,

860
00:50:50.931 --> 00:50:52.280
you know,
even if it's not you,

861
00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:55.160
but you're going to have a more consistent world that you're developing,

862
00:50:55.161 --> 00:50:59.960
then if you're putting them on Mars and you don't understand Mars.
Uh,
so,

863
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:04.110
you know,
a lot of things got slugged in and,
and I wrote it,
um,

864
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:07.310
pretty fairly quickly,
about two weeks,
two weeks.
He was very quick.

865
00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:11.660
And it didn't change really that much after that did not change.
It did not.

866
00:51:11.661 --> 00:51:15.470
But I had,
remember I had written my sketches and things.
Did you write it?

867
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:17.000
Start to,
do you read it?

868
00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:19.280
You wrote it from the beginning to the end of the beginning of the end,

869
00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:23.930
if you think's changed?
Not much.
10%.
Got It over time.

870
00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:28.430
Um,
and that was in final draft.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was a good,

871
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:31.610
was shut at the same way that did it start to finish.
So chef,
I didn't,
you know,

872
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.650
I'd written made after that few years later and then I had been hired as a

873
00:51:36.651 --> 00:51:40.460
writer based on swingers to do script doctoring and things.

874
00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:44.270
And that's where it gets tough because when you start getting paid to do

875
00:51:44.271 --> 00:51:47.540
something that used to do for fun,
you don't want to do it for fun as much.
And,

876
00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:51.440
and um,
what was nice about it is that you can,

877
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:53.720
you can make a living enough to,
you know,

878
00:51:53.721 --> 00:51:58.721
for a single dude to be able to buy a house over a few years and you know,

879
00:51:59.841 --> 00:52:02.000
drive a new car,
you know,

880
00:52:02.001 --> 00:52:06.380
or newish car but you can make a living just being a writer for hire because

881
00:52:06.381 --> 00:52:10.100
they're always looking for people with fresh takes and new ideas in the writing

882
00:52:10.101 --> 00:52:13.130
area.
Cause the very established writers are all,
you know,
they're busy.
You know,

883
00:52:13.131 --> 00:52:15.530
you get hired to do one thing that could keep you busy for a year.

884
00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:20.690
So there's always room for another rider.
Once you kind of make that list,

885
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:23.180
uh,
unfortunate.
If you're not on the list,

886
00:52:23.181 --> 00:52:25.670
you can't get an a door and swingers put you on the list.

887
00:52:25.671 --> 00:52:26.780
Swingers put me on that list.

888
00:52:26.781 --> 00:52:29.690
So I went from an actor and also people kind of knew me from my acting from

889
00:52:29.691 --> 00:52:30.524
Rooney.

890
00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:35.150
And so there's a bit of a novelty of being an actor that they recognize and know

891
00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:37.850
when you're already used to being in those rooms.
You're already,

892
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:41.510
people know who you are,
you knew who they are,
you already have representation.

893
00:52:41.511 --> 00:52:46.390
So it's easier to get into that system.
So,
uh,
that was uh,
uh,

894
00:52:46.391 --> 00:52:50.090
a bit of a,
I wouldn't say it's a life hack but uh,

895
00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:55.340
but it's um,
my using that term properly I think and know,

896
00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:59.390
I think,
I think that a,
you kind of sound like I fit on your podcast here.
Oh,

897
00:52:59.391 --> 00:53:02.450
you're already fit on the podcast.
You're doing great.
The,
I think the uh,

898
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:08.170
the f it seems like you gave yourself sort of more tickets in the raffle,

899
00:53:08.691 --> 00:53:12.240
so to speak,
than a lot of people get,
cause you had the writing,
acting,
directing.

900
00:53:12.241 --> 00:53:15.670
Well,
irons in the fire.
Not,
not all necessarily,
that's not financially,

901
00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:17.000
but in the beginning,
remember,

902
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:21.860
I'm trying to break into another field,
right?

903
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:22.221
Right.

904
00:53:22.221 --> 00:53:26.880
So I'm like seeing how far I could take this thing and the acting thing got me

905
00:53:26.881 --> 00:53:29.630
more raffle tickets in that sense.
Um,

906
00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:34.770
but it was an interesting way into writing and much like how acting was a really

907
00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:37.950
interesting way into directing because in directing,

908
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:43.280
one of the disadvantages that most people other than me had was that if you're

909
00:53:43.531 --> 00:53:48.300
going to direct,
the only way you can show people,
your director is by directing.

910
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:52.200
There's no apprenticeship per se and directing,

911
00:53:52.201 --> 00:53:54.780
it's not like assistant directors.
There's an apprenticeship.

912
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:58.890
You could work your way up from way up from a PA,
work your way up to second,

913
00:53:58.891 --> 00:54:01.900
second,
second a d two first aid.

914
00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:06.480
You will hit the top of the food chain in and by learning from other people who

915
00:54:06.481 --> 00:54:09.900
are better than you,
there's no room on the set for another,

916
00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:14.250
the director's assistant.
There's not another director,
the director's assistant.

917
00:54:14.251 --> 00:54:17.490
And as somebody who lives at PA,
somebody who worked in development,

918
00:54:17.491 --> 00:54:19.560
somebody who's,
you know,
uh,

919
00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:22.230
most I don't think I've ever met a director who's assistant was,

920
00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:26.160
was a director and training.
Uh,
and even then you're not getting that experience.

921
00:54:26.161 --> 00:54:28.320
But as an actor,
I got to

922
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:33.930
have front row seats for every director that I worked with.

923
00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:37.650
So the time I ever directed,
I already,
you know,

924
00:54:37.651 --> 00:54:40.550
there were a half a dozen directors that I thought were great and half a dozen

925
00:54:40.551 --> 00:54:43.890
and I thought weren't great and I emulated the ones that were great.

926
00:54:43.891 --> 00:54:44.701
And being an actor,

927
00:54:44.701 --> 00:54:49.701
you're kind of modeling yourself imitating what the people you respect do.

928
00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.300
And that's kind of what musicians do too,
right?
If you,
you know,
you,

929
00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:59.250
everybody practices Hendricks licks first and then they come up with their own

930
00:54:59.251 --> 00:55:03.030
style,
but there is,
uh,
there is,
uh,
this,

931
00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:07.140
uh,
mimicking phase of learning and,

932
00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:12.530
and it's tough to get those 10,000 hours under your belt just by going to film

933
00:55:12.541 --> 00:55:16.620
school.
Now maybe it's different because now people can literally take a camera,

934
00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:20.670
go out,
film something,
edit it,
put it up,
get feedback.

935
00:55:20.671 --> 00:55:24.390
See if people like it or they don't,
and they could hit the drawing board again.

936
00:55:24.391 --> 00:55:28.080
It does not cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Uh,
they can,

937
00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:32.630
they can do that thanks to technology.
But Tom,
I was coming up,
that wasn't,

938
00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:33.600
that wasn't even an option.

939
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:37.590
Swingers was done as cheaply as you possibly could for that quality of a film.

940
00:55:37.591 --> 00:55:38.424
And that was,
uh,

941
00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:42.330
almost $200,000 and clerks had been done even cheaper than the budget was

942
00:55:42.331 --> 00:55:45.560
$200,000.
175,
something like that.
Uh,

943
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:48.810
but the clerks had been done for I think 10,000 or something ridiculous like

944
00:55:48.811 --> 00:55:52.170
that.
And that's,
you know,
that's a feat.
Oh yeah.

945
00:55:52.171 --> 00:55:54.600
Because I haven't done it at a time when it wasn't quite that straightforward.

946
00:55:54.601 --> 00:55:57.330
It was very inspiring to us.
So it was before we had done it and we were like,

947
00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:59.790
why can't we just do it?
Because instead of trying to sell swingers,

948
00:55:59.791 --> 00:56:03.140
we ended up making ourselves.
Uh,
so by the time I had done chef,

949
00:56:03.141 --> 00:56:07.920
it was like I had been wanting to do something.
Everything I was developing,

950
00:56:07.921 --> 00:56:09.480
I was trying to work on as a chef into,

951
00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.420
because I want it to be something I wanted to learn about.

952
00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:16.980
So if I was working on a TV pilot or working on,
uh,
uh,

953
00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:20.310
developing something for is producing something for somebody else who was like,

954
00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:23.770
oh,
what about an in a restaurant?
What about Hsa?
Because it seemed,
it was a very,

955
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:28.240
uh,
from watching top chef and following chefs,
reading chefs biographies,

956
00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:31.690
reading kitchen confidential,
which was the first one that I read by Bordain.

957
00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:36.010
Great Book,
Great Book.
And it seemed like there's something here.
Uh,

958
00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:39.010
but it didn't seem like something that warranted its own.

959
00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.080
I couldn't see the way to make it into its own thing.

960
00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:43.810
So that was kind of bubbling around my head.

961
00:56:43.811 --> 00:56:47.750
And then something about doing something about being a dad,
being,
um,

962
00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:51.100
we were talking about mindfulness,
about mindfulness in parenting,

963
00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:54.010
about how a few simple,

964
00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:59.020
overseeing a few important things in your life over the course of many years can

965
00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:02.510
ruin your life if you don't invest enough into the,

966
00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:04.960
the things that are important but not pressing.

967
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:09.130
So if you put everything into your career and not into the things that won't,

968
00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:11.890
there's things that aren't the squeaky wheel but are important,

969
00:57:11.891 --> 00:57:13.600
but not in the short term.

970
00:57:13.601 --> 00:57:18.530
Over time you'll find yourself in a situation that you don't even understand how

971
00:57:18.531 --> 00:57:20.170
you got into,
you know,

972
00:57:20.171 --> 00:57:22.720
when you see it a lot in the chef world is still out in the movie world.

973
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:25.210
A lot of fail if families that where it doesn't work out.

974
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:29.470
And a lot of it's because the,
the career demands so much time,

975
00:57:29.471 --> 00:57:33.280
so much effort and creating that balance,
which,
which,
you know,

976
00:57:33.281 --> 00:57:37.990
fortunately I've done,
you know,
uh,
the,
the older I get,
the better I get at it.

977
00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:42.460
And,
and,
and now,
uh,
the things are,
you know,

978
00:57:42.461 --> 00:57:43.720
I think well balanced for me,

979
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:46.360
but I want to make something about somebody where they weren't well balanced.

980
00:57:46.361 --> 00:57:49.840
What if I had made different decisions in my life early on and,

981
00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:53.350
and then looking at it through the idea of the culinary world and,

982
00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:57.780
and having really,
the stories are about growth spurts.
It's about right.

983
00:57:57.790 --> 00:57:59.230
Coming of age.
I'm a big,

984
00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:03.940
I mentioned Joseph Campbell's monomyth yeah,
sorry.
Oh No,

985
00:58:03.941 --> 00:58:07.210
I was saying just the monomyth.
I finally made a,
just a motto,
Manon,

986
00:58:07.211 --> 00:58:08.430
we'll seat detox about,
I,

987
00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:13.240
I become fascinated by Joseph Campbell and the last few years,
uh,
also the,

988
00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:16.750
the how these archetypes,
right.
Uh,

989
00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:21.690
translate across all cultures and indigenous tribal here.

990
00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:23.280
1,000 physiology.
Exactly.
Yeah.

991
00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:26.890
You ever seen speaking of Skywalker that I think the first time that I saw the

992
00:58:26.891 --> 00:58:30.460
Skywalker ranch was on the power of meth with Jesu.

993
00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:34.210
Campbell's interviewed by Bill Moyers.
Oh,
I haven't seen that.
I haven't,

994
00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:37.720
that's one of the first,
uh,
when,
when video first came out,

995
00:58:37.721 --> 00:58:39.460
that was one of the first things that was,
uh,

996
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:43.600
available in that realm and it's still holds up.
It's great.

997
00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:47.140
I'm sure it's easy to get your hands on the power meth and he's being,

998
00:58:47.141 --> 00:58:51.100
he's in sending in the library at the Skywalker ranch being interviewed of

999
00:58:51.101 --> 00:58:53.290
everything back free now from Adam and even earlier,

1000
00:58:53.291 --> 00:58:54.610
all the way through star wars.

1001
00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:59.170
And it's like a four part or six part series from PBS,
I think.

1002
00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:02.650
And it was great.
That was my introduction to,
to Joseph Campbell.

1003
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:07.710
And then there's books about relating that archetype rise of the hero

1004
00:59:09.581 --> 00:59:13.950
storytelling,
two screenplays and how there's less variation than you,

1005
00:59:13.951 --> 00:59:18.040
you might think.
And the more you stick to it,
the better.

1006
00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:22.730
It just is.
It's,
it's,
those are great to fly with.
And with jungle book,

1007
00:59:22.731 --> 00:59:27.350
I really am,
you know,
going back and doubling down on that,
on,
on,

1008
00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:29.870
just going back to the,
to the old myths.

1009
00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:34.250
<v 1>And it works so well for,
for Lucas.
Oh yeah.
I mean it's,
uh,</v>

1010
00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:35.960
I've been,

1011
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:39.890
I'm fascinated by spy screenwriting and I haven't spent a lot of time looking at

1012
00:59:39.891 --> 00:59:40.281
the format,

1013
00:59:40.281 --> 00:59:44.690
but I took the story seminar by be key and have read a handful of books.

1014
00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:47.840
That's pretty intense.
And that is,
that is intense.

1015
00:59:47.841 --> 00:59:51.410
And that book is I've ever gotten all the way through.
I found it very dense.

1016
00:59:51.411 --> 00:59:53.660
I've had a difficult,
uh,
there,
there are a handful of others,

1017
00:59:53.661 --> 00:59:56.330
like saved the cat that I found very helpful for me personally,

1018
00:59:56.331 --> 01:00:01.130
just to think about the storytelling mechanisms.
There's one called,
uh,
if,
if,

1019
01:00:01.131 --> 01:00:04.250
if I may,
oh,
of course.
The writer's journey,
the writer's journey,

1020
01:00:04.251 --> 01:00:05.084
writer's journey.

1021
01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:06.190
<v 3>Um,
and I,</v>

1022
01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:10.270
<v 1>I'm sorry,
I'm a launch.
I could look it up while we're,
while we're talking.
Oh,</v>

1023
01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:12.380
I'll put it in the show notes as well.
Okay.
Hope you'll put it in.

1024
01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.073
Because what it does is it

1025
01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:19.100
<v 3>takes Joseph Campbell and refines it down from the perspective of somebody think</v>

1026
01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.880
it was a story executive at Disney and,
um,
and,

1027
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:26.880
and breaks what breaks apart,
what the,

1028
01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:31.410
what those archetypes are and how they apply to movies that you would have seen

1029
01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.890
breaking down movies using that.
And,

1030
01:00:33.891 --> 01:00:38.670
and also talking about three act structure as it is a,
as it

1031
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.780
pertains to the,

1032
01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:47.070
the mythic structure that Campbell talked about with the,

1033
01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:49.800
the calling,
the refusal of the call,

1034
01:00:49.801 --> 01:00:52.470
the entering into the extraordinary world,

1035
01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:57.960
the entering the inmost cave,
the
killing the dragon,

1036
01:00:57.961 --> 01:01:02.140
and taking the elixir,
going back and healing the land.
And,
um,

1037
01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:07.280
even back when I,
uh,
I even looked at,
I was,
I had

1038
01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:10.680
<v 1>already read the book by the time I had done swingers and looked at swingers.
Oh,</v>

1039
01:01:10.681 --> 01:01:12.850
the registry.
So it's been around,
it's been around for awhile.

1040
01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:14.730
And I remember reading that book

1041
01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:17.150
<v 3>and seeing if it,</v>

1042
01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:22.340
if I was structurally correct with swingers and,
and I was satisfied that I was.

1043
01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:27.800
But the trick I think is not to use it as a map too,
right?

1044
01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:31.940
Because you have to write,
I think you just have to brain dump when you write.

1045
01:01:31.941 --> 01:01:35.720
I don't think you could try to control your writing too much.

1046
01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:38.030
Um,
for me,

1047
01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:41.780
some people are very different people who come out of,
you know,

1048
01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:46.781
where they're creating series arcs for a television show it becomes,

1049
01:01:47.541 --> 01:01:47.841
you know,

1050
01:01:47.841 --> 01:01:51.560
you have to delve a group mind and you use the dry erase board and you plot

1051
01:01:51.561 --> 01:01:55.670
things out.
It may change but it's very well thought through.

1052
01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:59.120
And I find that people that have come from that background tend to like to

1053
01:01:59.121 --> 01:01:59.960
outline a lot.

1054
01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:03.650
And then there are other people who just come from pros and creative writing or

1055
01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:05.690
uh,
you know,
uh,
storage,
you know,

1056
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:09.500
short story writers that where they just want to,
you know,

1057
01:02:09.501 --> 01:02:13.550
the routine has more to do with
what time of day they write,

1058
01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:17.880
how much coffee they have before they do,
you know,
getting into that,
you know,
uh,

1059
01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:21.840
getting into the creative routine,
uh,
that's where their structure is.

1060
01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:22.920
There's always some form of structure.

1061
01:02:22.921 --> 01:02:25.740
Sometimes instructors in the writing seminars,
instructors in the writing,

1062
01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:31.470
the act of writing.
Um,
but I found,
I find that for me,
I like to do,

1063
01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:36.140
I like to outline a little bit.
I like to,
I first they do so,

1064
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:37.530
so here's what you're getting back to chef.

1065
01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:41.910
So with chef I those two thoughts of wanting to write something about the chef

1066
01:02:41.911 --> 01:02:44.730
world and wanting to do something about mindfulness in parenting,

1067
01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.760
both crashed into each other.

1068
01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:52.470
And I got the idea of the epiphany hit me that,
um,

1069
01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:56.220
that I,
this is,
this could all come together in a project.

1070
01:02:56.221 --> 01:02:59.010
Let me write this thing.
And I,
and I took out,
I like composition.

1071
01:02:59.011 --> 01:03:01.590
I know you like the minutia.
I do.
I love the minutiae.

1072
01:03:01.591 --> 01:03:03.750
So composition mean composition,
notebooks,

1073
01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:08.270
you know the black and white flecks cover cardboard.
Sure.
Someone's spine.

1074
01:03:08.490 --> 01:03:11.790
It looks kinda like a zebra.
The black and white on the cover.
Exactly.

1075
01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:16.560
I like those because I find,
um,
I think it's from my drawing days,

1076
01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:17.593
um,

1077
01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:22.640
when I used to get like a really nice leather bound drawing paper sketch book

1078
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:27.270
that'd be so reluctant to,
to defile it.
Yeah.

1079
01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.440
Like is this drawing good enough for my cause it was always felt like a show

1080
01:03:30.441 --> 01:03:34.730
piece,
whereas the,
the notebooks seemed like,
um,

1081
01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:38.070
because everybody grew up with them like as their first notebook that there's a

1082
01:03:38.071 --> 01:03:42.170
freedom and marking it up,
but you can't rip pages out.
Right.

1083
01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:46.080
So you can't self edit because if you do,
the book falls apart.

1084
01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:49.230
So it's not like a spiral.
He can't use a spot for me.
He can't use a spiral.

1085
01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:53.610
So I have,
for everything I've done and there's a lot of incomplete projects,

1086
01:03:53.611 --> 01:03:57.120
I'll,
I'll get a composition notebook,
I'll date it,
title it,

1087
01:03:57.630 --> 01:04:01.830
and then just start filling it with,
uh,
some string of consciousness,
sometimes,

1088
01:04:01.831 --> 01:04:06.750
um,
a list of movies that I want to look at that relate to this a book,
uh,

1089
01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:11.130
image something.
And it becomes my,
you know,

1090
01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.950
that's where we're just brain dump.
And so for,

1091
01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:16.470
for a chef that was actually meditating,

1092
01:04:16.471 --> 01:04:18.840
I was meditating and the two things hit each other.

1093
01:04:19.530 --> 01:04:23.910
And usually if I'm meditating,
uh,
which I try to do at least once a day,

1094
01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.460
um,
although I don't always,

1095
01:04:26.461 --> 01:04:31.190
but I find that in part of the distraction of meditating,
uh,

1096
01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:34.800
creative thoughts might pop into my head,
but that seems to be a distraction.

1097
01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:39.600
So I have to push past those.
It's,
it's Kinda like on the highway entrance.

1098
01:04:39.601 --> 01:04:42.450
First you have everything you're worried about,
hit you,

1099
01:04:43.110 --> 01:04:44.970
then you start to have

1100
01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:50.580
creative thoughts that are interesting and inspiring.
But those will,

1101
01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:53.730
those will trick you into not meditating too.

1102
01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:59.100
So like these are all obstacles that you have to kind of pass by.
Um,
and then,

1103
01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:02.550
and then you get into the,
the good part.
If there's such a thing,

1104
01:05:02.551 --> 01:05:05.580
I know you're not supposed to judge it or think about it any,
but,

1105
01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.950
but you get into that brain wave or whatever that thing is.

1106
01:05:07.951 --> 01:05:12.750
It seems to be the experience that,
that when you meditate that you,

1107
01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:18.350
that you seek,
um,
that kind of,
okay.

1108
01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:22.180
Thoughtless [inaudible] the full devoid of sort of loading in the void.

1109
01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:25.240
I don't know if I get as far as the void,
but for me that's how I feel.

1110
01:05:25.241 --> 01:05:28.030
But that's good.
I don't know if I'm that good.
How do you meditate?

1111
01:05:28.031 --> 01:05:32.020
What type of meditation?
Just,
you know,
um,
do you focus on your breath?

1112
01:05:32.021 --> 01:05:36.720
Do you focus on something else that,
that TM or breath or a,

1113
01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:41.130
I tried different things,
but now you know,
honestly it's like I don't even,
it's,

1114
01:05:41.131 --> 01:05:45.390
it's,
it's,
it's more of like an exercise now.
Like I know how to get to,
uh,

1115
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:48.400
I think it's,
it might be a brainwave pattern,
I don't know,

1116
01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:52.750
but it's a state of mind that I could hit without really tricks.

1117
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:56.800
I kinda just need to take me about five or six minutes and I could get there.

1118
01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:00.270
Do you sit in a chair with your feet on the floor or you like scolded different?

1119
01:06:00.271 --> 01:06:04.440
Tried to lay down cause you fall asleep.
Right.
Yeah.
Um,

1120
01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:08.900
but I tried to do that.
I used to do it.
Um,
I haven't found a place ever.

1121
01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.590
It's nice when you can do at the same time every day.

1122
01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:14.020
I just switched from production to post production on this,
so I don't,
I don't,

1123
01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:16.450
I haven't gotten into my routine.
I haven't been doing it as much as I should,

1124
01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:21.310
but otherwise I'd like to.
But,
but,
uh,
a in the middle of it,
I got the,

1125
01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:25.900
the idea for chef hit me and I let myself stop,
which I don't usually do.

1126
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:29.870
And I took out a pad and I just scribbled out at like eight pages of,
of,

1127
01:06:29.871 --> 01:06:32.190
of ideas and thoughts and um,

1128
01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:36.230
I left it alone and then write it.
And it had,
you know,

1129
01:06:36.231 --> 01:06:38.360
if I look back on it and read those pages,

1130
01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:43.130
it really had 80% of the heavy lifting done as far as what it was about,

1131
01:06:43.790 --> 01:06:48.320
who was in it,
who the characters were.
Um,
what other movies to look at,

1132
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:52.310
what the tone is,
what music I would have in it,

1133
01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:53.780
what type of food he was doing,

1134
01:06:53.781 --> 01:06:57.170
the idea of the food truck and then the Cuban sandwiches and Cuban music and,

1135
01:06:57.950 --> 01:07:01.010
and uh,
he's from Miami and um,

1136
01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.160
and so it all sort of grew out from that.

1137
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:08.210
And then I went ahead and I have enough half written screenplays that I just

1138
01:07:08.211 --> 01:07:12.420
forced myself to keep writing every day.
Uh,

1139
01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:15.620
and so this only took me a few weeks to,
to get the first draft,

1140
01:07:16.610 --> 01:07:19.310
but the big thing was I was so scared of,
of of,

1141
01:07:19.790 --> 01:07:22.880
it's like the Cube Lecan dream,

1142
01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:26.720
the poem Qube Lecan right.
It wasn't that the story that,
that,

1143
01:07:26.721 --> 01:07:29.990
that it was a dream and only part of it was written down cause he forgot it all.

1144
01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:34.160
Uh,
the poet,
I think I have that.
I think I have that right.

1145
01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:37.730
Going back to school,
I don't remember the details.
Right.

1146
01:07:37.731 --> 01:07:40.370
But the idea that sometimes you feel like when you're writing a story or a

1147
01:07:40.371 --> 01:07:41.090
screenplay,

1148
01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:45.440
if you let enough time pass in the first draft,

1149
01:07:45.441 --> 01:07:48.110
you get off of that,
that kind of,
um,

1150
01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:50.930
get out of the gate of the zone on your on.
Yeah.

1151
01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:52.640
Because I don't think it's something you control.

1152
01:07:52.641 --> 01:07:56.110
I think it's something you access and,
and um,
I don't think,
I'm not,

1153
01:07:56.120 --> 01:08:00.320
not to say it's from some other mystical place,
but whatever,

1154
01:08:00.321 --> 01:08:02.870
that part of your brain that it comes from is,
uh,

1155
01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:07.190
is not a part of your brain that you necessarily can force to do what you want.

1156
01:08:07.191 --> 01:08:09.290
It's not,
they're not fully domesticated.
Right?
Yeah.

1157
01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:13.960
You gotta Kinda to kind of trick it into doing its thing.
And when you did the,

1158
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:16.460
the brain dump down into the composition notebook,

1159
01:08:16.730 --> 01:08:20.750
<v 1>do you take then I'd imagine these are not necessarily in chronological order.</v>

1160
01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:24.740
It's just a full on brain dump.
Some of its chronological,

1161
01:08:24.741 --> 01:08:28.190
then you go back and hit another part of it and then run it through again.

1162
01:08:28.191 --> 01:08:31.370
And so it does,
it goes,
go on a little tears.
It's like a pitch session,

1163
01:08:31.371 --> 01:08:34.880
except you're alone.
And when you said tone,
what would be an example of,

1164
01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:39.380
of tone for a movie?
How would you sort of write that down or describe that?
Eat,

1165
01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:40.850
drink,
man.
Woman opening.

1166
01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:46.760
<v 3>Like that stuff.
Right.
Fantastic.
One big night.
Um,
you know,</v>

1167
01:08:46.761 --> 01:08:51.080
a lot of it's movies,
a lot of it is one of it's a social club soundtrack.

1168
01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:55.430
Um,
food truck,
food,
Cuban sandwiches,

1169
01:08:56.540 --> 01:09:00.470
Cuban sandwiches,
uh,
the sun,
the,
there's a divorce,

1170
01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:06.050
the,
they've been separated,
but they get along,
get along.

1171
01:09:06.051 --> 01:09:10.880
And he's with,
he's stuck.
He's with,
uh,
he's a,
there's a critic coming.

1172
01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:14.660
Yeah.
This is it.
That's there's Braca two.
It's the only,
so many,

1173
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:17.540
there's only so many cooking a restaurant.
Movies you can make.

1174
01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:20.750
And the guy is preparing the,

1175
01:09:20.751 --> 01:09:23.540
he's goes to the farmer's market and brings his kid with him.
Like,
so there's,

1176
01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:28.120
there's moments,
there's vignettes,
there's,
um,
images.
Um,

1177
01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.320
and some of them are sequences and some of them are movies.

1178
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.330
And sometimes it's movies that are in your memory.

1179
01:09:32.331 --> 01:09:33.890
And then when you see the movie,
it's not that,

1180
01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:38.870
but it's the version in your head from what you remember of a movie and then
you,

1181
01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:42.290
and then kitchen confidential.
I remember referencing that a lot and,

1182
01:09:43.330 --> 01:09:47.240
and who the characters are.
And I wanted a very,

1183
01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:50.640
a lot of,
uh,

1184
01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:55.850
Latino cast members because that's what was really kitchen confidential.

1185
01:09:55.851 --> 01:09:59.630
I remember like that's really what kitchens were and what I saw and what it was

1186
01:09:59.631 --> 01:10:03.980
and never what was depicted.
And how does that,
the,
the,

1187
01:10:05.210 --> 01:10:09.380
how does the vibrance of that culture with the music playing in the kitchen and

1188
01:10:09.381 --> 01:10:13.850
then they're cooking food that's not that.
And then in,
in being a re

1189
01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:20.510
inspired,
he's inspired by that.
Who,
the people that are surrounding him,

1190
01:10:20.511 --> 01:10:23.720
the music he's listening to and where he came from in Miami.

1191
01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:25.920
And maybe that's the type of food he used to cook it.

1192
01:10:25.921 --> 01:10:30.440
Now he's cooking very trendy,
you know,

1193
01:10:30.441 --> 01:10:33.720
a user friendly food that wasn't inspiring to him.
And,

1194
01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:37.940
and then being frustrated by not being inspired by his,

1195
01:10:37.941 --> 01:10:42.350
his art is no longer inspiring him and he's hit an impasse and they also at the

1196
01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:46.850
impasses affecting both his professional life,

1197
01:10:46.851 --> 01:10:50.090
but in a way he's not aware of his personal life too.
He's,

1198
01:10:50.091 --> 01:10:52.040
he's stuck spiritually stuck.
Okay.

1199
01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.740
<v 1>And on the,
on the show business side of things,</v>

1200
01:10:54.741 --> 01:10:57.980
this is something I know very little about,
but in terms of the,
the,

1201
01:10:58.210 --> 01:11:02.720
the actual making,
selling,
distributing of the film,
uh,

1202
01:11:02.721 --> 01:11:06.710
and feel free to correct me if I get this wrong,
when I've heard you refer to,

1203
01:11:06.711 --> 01:11:10.490
I think making chef has,
going back to basics.
Yes.
Uh,

1204
01:11:10.491 --> 01:11:12.710
and sort of constraining the size or the,

1205
01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:15.810
or budget so that you could do certain things like have the language you want it

1206
01:11:15.811 --> 01:11:20.490
to have in the movie,
for instance,
be authentic.
Uh,
how,

1207
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:25.470
how did you make this movie?
And I know that's a very novice question,
but,
uh,

1208
01:11:26.050 --> 01:11:28.010
I've,
I've talked to people sort of indirectly,

1209
01:11:28.011 --> 01:11:31.260
you've gone through the big studio process and have had a very rough time of it.

1210
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:36.130
What made chef different?
How did you,
uh,
or swingers you could comment on that?

1211
01:11:37.730 --> 01:11:38.360
Again,

1212
01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:41.720
<v 2>I think,
I think it's all a matter of,
um,</v>

1213
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:46.910
it's,
it's all a matter of adjusting to what the,
of,

1214
01:11:46.911 --> 01:11:51.911
what the environment is at any given moment and adjusting in art of war kind of

1215
01:11:52.401 --> 01:11:55.400
way.
I don't think about it in those terms but,

1216
01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:58.130
but acknowledge what the terrain is.

1217
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.760
And I think a lot of what seems like a,

1218
01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:07.780
in my career in general as though I've had this vision for how my career was

1219
01:12:08.451 --> 01:12:10.700
going to change and things I would try to do and,

1220
01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:13.700
and to get things accomplished was,

1221
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:16.790
was more a reaction to what the circumstances were.

1222
01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:19.760
So for example,
I thought swingers,

1223
01:12:19.761 --> 01:12:22.910
we opened a lot of doors for me acting wise it didn't,
uh,

1224
01:12:22.911 --> 01:12:25.400
I got to do a little bit of stuff here and there.
It was fun,

1225
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:30.980
but I was very sought after as a writer after that.

1226
01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:36.020
And so the writer door opened up,
the actor door was,
you know,

1227
01:12:36.021 --> 01:12:39.440
kind of more of a,
more of a small,
you know,

1228
01:12:39.450 --> 01:12:43.490
a little cracked open door.
That occasion I could poke my nose through.

1229
01:12:43.491 --> 01:12:47.750
But it wasn't receiving me,
but the,
but the writer door was wide open.

1230
01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:53.410
So I started to do that and I learned a lot about storytelling and interacting

1231
01:12:53.421 --> 01:12:58.040
with executives and what the system was by being involved with projects and none

1232
01:12:58.041 --> 01:13:00.980
of which that ever got actually produced with the versions that I wrote.

1233
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:05.600
But I was part of a chain of writers on,
on,
on certain projects.
Um,

1234
01:13:06.710 --> 01:13:08.620
so I would,
I was pretty good at,

1235
01:13:08.970 --> 01:13:13.970
at adjusting to what path was available to me and finding something interesting

1236
01:13:14.091 --> 01:13:18.290
about what was available,
but without ever feeling that I was compromising.

1237
01:13:18.291 --> 01:13:22.130
But just trying to check out something that could be cool and not getting in my

1238
01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:25.280
own way of saying,
why shouldn't I be a writer on this?
Why not pitch this

1239
01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.540
take on a movie even though I've never done a rewrite?
Why,

1240
01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:34.040
why not go in there and talk to them about this?
And,
and so I've had,

1241
01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:38.930
I think I've had enough confidence to not be scared to try something new,

1242
01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:41.270
which I think is something that gets in a lot of people's ways.

1243
01:13:41.271 --> 01:13:44.630
I think people get in their own way a lot and there are certain things that I'm,

1244
01:13:44.690 --> 01:13:46.400
you know,
that I have been scared of but,

1245
01:13:46.670 --> 01:13:50.480
but for some reason careerwise maybe it's my early upbringing.

1246
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:52.460
I don't know what,
but I,

1247
01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:57.461
I never feel intimidated when I'm in a room with people or if I'm on stage in

1248
01:14:00.081 --> 01:14:04.190
front of people.
Like I don't,
I don't get that.
My,

1249
01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:08.000
my heart doesn't,
doesn't race in those situations.

1250
01:14:08.001 --> 01:14:09.860
And those even before the Improv.
Yeah,

1251
01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:13.030
I've always been comfortable like getting in front of people and talking and

1252
01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:15.310
I've been a bit of a ham when I was little,

1253
01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:18.850
like loving the jump up in front of the family and put on shows.

1254
01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:21.810
I just think certain people wire now that I have three kids for sure,

1255
01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:26.710
you just kind of wired a certain way and certain people are,
you know,

1256
01:14:26.711 --> 01:14:28.180
kind of,
you know,

1257
01:14:28.181 --> 01:14:32.440
they kind of have certain things that they like and certain things that they're

1258
01:14:32.441 --> 01:14:34.630
good at and you could adjust them and change them,

1259
01:14:34.631 --> 01:14:38.900
but you're kind of kind of working with her,
you know,
you're kind of handed it.

1260
01:14:38.901 --> 01:14:40.970
It's like,
it's like poker.
You get a d,
You know,
you get,

1261
01:14:40.971 --> 01:14:45.400
you get dealt a hand and you could play those cards well or poorly,
but,

1262
01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:49.270
but you're definitely working from,
um,
you know,

1263
01:14:49.271 --> 01:14:53.170
you're definitely inheriting your properties in risk at the beginning of the

1264
01:14:53.171 --> 01:14:55.030
game.
You know what I mean?
You're,
you're,

1265
01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:59.350
you're starting from a certain vantage point and,
and then,
and then it's,

1266
01:14:59.351 --> 01:15:03.730
what do you do with that,
with,
with a movie like swingers for instance.
And again,

1267
01:15:03.731 --> 01:15:05.740
this is,
these are just things that I've heard quoted,

1268
01:15:05.741 --> 01:15:07.120
so feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

1269
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:10.000
It seems like everyone has seen swingers.
I mean,
it gets,

1270
01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:12.310
it gets quoted all the time.
Um,

1271
01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:16.690
the box office was around 6 million.
It was if that,

1272
01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:19.480
if that it was considered,
you know,
so.

1273
01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:23.680
So just to give you a perspective,
we,
you know,

1274
01:15:24.130 --> 01:15:26.350
trying to get it made for a year.
Nobody gives us the money.

1275
01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:31.450
Doug Liman is able to raise the money and we make it together.
What is his,

1276
01:15:31.451 --> 01:15:35.410
uh,
he's,
I guess director got the director of the film,
but when I had met him,

1277
01:15:35.411 --> 01:15:36.850
I was trying to set it up as a director.

1278
01:15:36.851 --> 01:15:39.970
I was trying to direct it and he had already done a film.
Uh,

1279
01:15:39.971 --> 01:15:42.810
he was just part of a circle of friends.
Did not very,
uh,

1280
01:15:42.850 --> 01:15:45.730
I wasn't very close with him,
but I knew him through somebody else.

1281
01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:49.390
And he was somebody who had directed.
And so I had bought him a cup of coffee.

1282
01:15:49.391 --> 01:15:52.420
He talked me through lenses and it was preparing me for when it was time for me

1283
01:15:52.421 --> 01:15:56.380
to direct.
And then in that process had said,
look,
I know you,
you,
you know,

1284
01:15:56.381 --> 01:15:59.560
hopefully you will get to put this thing together,
but um,

1285
01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:01.360
but I can raise the money.
And,

1286
01:16:01.361 --> 01:16:05.740
and so we agreed to creatively be partners on this thing and,

1287
01:16:05.741 --> 01:16:06.574
and um,

1288
01:16:07.090 --> 01:16:10.360
and we made it a much smaller budget and I thought it was possible this was the

1289
01:16:10.361 --> 01:16:14.650
200 [inaudible] 200 k that he was able to bring and figure out how to bring that

1290
01:16:14.651 --> 01:16:19.360
movie to the screen with that budget,
with the experience that he had had.
So,
uh,

1291
01:16:19.930 --> 01:16:24.250
so that it happened,
we tried to get into Sundance and not to interrupt,

1292
01:16:24.251 --> 01:16:29.110
but was he that financing from sort of independently wealthy individuals or was

1293
01:16:29.111 --> 01:16:32.140
it from companies are,
I think it was more like that.
Yeah,

1294
01:16:32.210 --> 01:16:35.170
I think it was more of the connections that he had had from growing up in town

1295
01:16:35.171 --> 01:16:37.730
and being involved with,
uh,
you know,
there were,

1296
01:16:37.731 --> 01:16:41.440
there were people that he knew that were willing to bet on him as some of it was

1297
01:16:41.441 --> 01:16:45.940
based on stuff he had done already.
And some of it was,
um,
you know,
uh,

1298
01:16:46.330 --> 01:16:50.080
that he,
you know,
had passionate about this thing,
but he was able to get the,

1299
01:16:50.081 --> 01:16:53.740
the secure the financing.
Got It.
So,
uh,
so the,

1300
01:16:53.741 --> 01:16:58.540
the first experience was that,
um,
then,

1301
01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:02.710
then we made it and that was real seat of the pants and then we didn't get into

1302
01:17:02.711 --> 01:17:05.830
Sundance,
which was our goal was to get in.

1303
01:17:05.890 --> 01:17:07.540
That was the be all and end all for us.

1304
01:17:07.570 --> 01:17:12.570
And I know if it was that it wasn't finished enough or we had just just pulled

1305
01:17:12.651 --> 01:17:12.970
it,
you know,

1306
01:17:12.970 --> 01:17:16.700
a cut together for them where it was screened on videotape versus a screening,

1307
01:17:16.701 --> 01:17:18.920
who knows what it was,
was incredibly disappointing us.

1308
01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:24.680
So it felt like all was lost.
Then we put up,
uh,
after Sundance,

1309
01:17:24.681 --> 01:17:28.370
that Sundance festival,
when everybody had gotten back,

1310
01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:33.320
we had done our own screening in Los Angeles for the cast and crew and invited

1311
01:17:33.321 --> 01:17:34.850
some distributors to it as well.

1312
01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:38.450
And it played extraordinary extraordinarily well there.

1313
01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:41.120
And then we had multiple buyers and you know,

1314
01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:44.120
you don't have to be in Hollywood to know what that means,
you know,

1315
01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:48.620
more than one person is interested.
It's a whole different dynamic.

1316
01:17:48.650 --> 01:17:51.080
And now there was a,
a bit of a bidding war over.

1317
01:17:51.081 --> 01:17:55.790
It ended up selling for $5 million and there's a distribution rights,

1318
01:17:55.791 --> 01:17:59.690
distribution rights.
And,
um,
and so we were,

1319
01:17:59.810 --> 01:18:04.070
we were riding high.
It was,
you know,
in all the,
all,

1320
01:18:04.071 --> 01:18:07.370
everybody wants to interview us and everybody wanted to feature us in their

1321
01:18:07.371 --> 01:18:11.390
magazines and we were like the next thing.
And,
and so when,

1322
01:18:11.391 --> 01:18:16.160
like the year between when it was a acquired and when it came out that we were

1323
01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:20.300
riding very high,
Vincent,
I think God cast in,
uh,

1324
01:18:20.301 --> 01:18:23.750
the SQL to Jurassic Park,
which is as bad as big as you can get.

1325
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:26.450
And everybody who was,

1326
01:18:26.451 --> 01:18:31.340
nobody was now had a seat at the table,
had another shot,
you know,

1327
01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:35.630
uh,
and,
and then by the time the movie came out,

1328
01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:38.480
it opened,
first weekend is in whatever,

1329
01:18:38.481 --> 01:18:41.810
two theaters for theaters who was huge box office.

1330
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:43.970
And then a few weeks later,

1331
01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:47.870
nobody cared and it made $5 million and,

1332
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:51.320
and it was considered a failure at the box office wise.

1333
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:52.461
Cause you've got to figure out,

1334
01:18:52.461 --> 01:18:55.910
one side of us was like Slingblade that made $100 million in one Oscars on the

1335
01:18:55.911 --> 01:18:59.390
other side was um,
goodwill hunting that won Oscars and made like $100 million.

1336
01:18:59.391 --> 01:19:04.190
So we were kind of a disappointing,
uh,
underperformer at Miramax at that point.

1337
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:09.140
And so all of it kind of ebbed away.
But again,
it was,

1338
01:19:09.141 --> 01:19:13.250
it was enough to get my foot in the door as a writer.
And,
uh,
I had already,

1339
01:19:13.670 --> 01:19:16.850
now I had not just been the guy who was in Rudy as a,
as a character actor,

1340
01:19:16.851 --> 01:19:21.700
but now I been in this movie that as you said,
everybody has seen.
So,
uh,

1341
01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:25.520
thanks to video and later DVD and the earlier on laser disk,

1342
01:19:25.521 --> 01:19:28.730
everybody had seen this film and it become part of our culture.

1343
01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.380
And that's what I kind of learned,

1344
01:19:30.381 --> 01:19:33.950
that it's not always the movie that does the best,

1345
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:35.510
that has the most impact.

1346
01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:38.570
Where's the most rewarding or does the most of your career for that matter?

1347
01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:39.980
Even though in the short term,

1348
01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:45.720
successes is celebrated here and failures on forgivable.
Uh,

1349
01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:50.720
but over time I think that it,
that shifts a bit.

1350
01:19:51.230 --> 01:19:52.430
And I know for example,

1351
01:19:52.431 --> 01:19:55.670
like Vince had gotten Jurassic Park on the heels of swingers.

1352
01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.650
He's far more recognized now from swingers that grossed one,
you know,

1353
01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:05.660
not even a 10th,
uh,
maybe a hundredth of what that movie made.

1354
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:10.680
But for some reason this one has had more impact on his career,

1355
01:20:11.190 --> 01:20:14.790
even though a far less people went to see it in the movie theater.

1356
01:20:15.390 --> 01:20:19.290
So you never know what's gonna.
And I,
and I find in my own career the same thing.

1357
01:20:19.291 --> 01:20:20.910
It's not always the things that make the most money.

1358
01:20:20.911 --> 01:20:25.911
It's the things that the performances or there's something about certain

1359
01:20:26.041 --> 01:20:27.840
projects that stick in people's memories more.

1360
01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:29.410
<v 1>Yeah,
the staying power.
And I was,</v>

1361
01:20:29.411 --> 01:20:32.740
I was astonished as I started studying film more and looking at movies that had

1362
01:20:32.741 --> 01:20:37.741
a huge impact on me or were these landmark iconic films among the high school

1363
01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:42.550
and college males who are the majority of my friends in fight club,
for instance.

1364
01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:46.830
And I was astonished that it wasn't some massive,
massive aging bull,
you know,

1365
01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:49.100
was,
you know,
all these movies that are sort of failures in the,

1366
01:20:49.150 --> 01:20:50.920
<v 3>and the,
in the,
uh,</v>

1367
01:20:51.790 --> 01:20:55.510
in the beginning and up or Rudy was my first experience with a movie coming out.

1368
01:20:55.511 --> 01:20:56.141
It didn't do well at,

1369
01:20:56.141 --> 01:21:00.310
I'll do a new number one at the box office was considered also an under

1370
01:21:00.311 --> 01:21:05.090
performer,
but now everybody knows it.
It's a cultural,
um,
you know,
it's,

1371
01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:09.220
it's,
it's a cultural point of reference.
Uh,
I hear the music everywhere.

1372
01:21:09.221 --> 01:21:11.560
I people refer to it constantly.

1373
01:21:11.561 --> 01:21:16.240
So like those are the ones where you make the ripple,
the cultural ripple.

1374
01:21:16.241 --> 01:21:19.150
And that's honestly the thing that is most exciting,

1375
01:21:19.151 --> 01:21:23.230
that that's the most appealing to me is how can you impact,

1376
01:21:24.010 --> 01:21:28.510
how can you make that kind of impact and affect people and either touch them,

1377
01:21:28.810 --> 01:21:33.670
entertain them,
make them laugh,
make them feel connected.
You know,

1378
01:21:33.671 --> 01:21:37.420
that's the,
that's the part that's the most rewarding at this point in my career.

1379
01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:40.670
<v 1>And,
uh,
I am keeping an eye on the time.
I know that,
uh,</v>

1380
01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:43.900
you've been very generous with your time and I'll only take a few more minutes.

1381
01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:44.500
Uh,

1382
01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:49.500
the W it would be remiss of me if I didn't mention that a number of my fans have

1383
01:21:49.601 --> 01:21:51.220
said to thank you for chef.

1384
01:21:51.221 --> 01:21:54.390
They've rented at five to 10 times just to show friends.
So I think that,
that,

1385
01:21:54.391 --> 01:21:56.050
that's all I think that's going to be one of the movies.

1386
01:21:56.051 --> 01:21:58.900
And I think that's really what,
that's was kind of a thing.

1387
01:21:58.901 --> 01:22:00.750
I know within like the,
the chef

1388
01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:04.460
<v 3>community,
they accepted it,
the ones that I've met.</v>

1389
01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:09.290
So that was a big scary part of it for me.
Cause if,
if everybody,

1390
01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:12.920
if people had liked to,
who didn't know about that world and,

1391
01:22:12.921 --> 01:22:15.350
but then the people who are in the world didn't like it,
it would have been

1392
01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:19.610
<v 2>a mixed,
it went to felt good to me.
Um,</v>

1393
01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:23.510
but the fact that people are seeing it now,
like I,

1394
01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:26.180
uh,

1395
01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:31.850
I'm spending more time with my son after seeing the movie or you know what?

1396
01:22:31.851 --> 01:22:35.540
I'm going to try to open up my own business that I've been putting off forever.

1397
01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:41.410
And that's when you feel really humbled and good and flattered because you feel

1398
01:22:41.571 --> 01:22:46.100
like you're connecting.
It's a selfishly,

1399
01:22:46.130 --> 01:22:50.030
just a very good feeling to know that,
that you're,

1400
01:22:50.630 --> 01:22:51.560
that you're,
uh,

1401
01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:56.600
you're me being on this planet has changed somebody else's experience,

1402
01:22:56.900 --> 01:23:00.080
like in a,
in a good way.
And it feels,
it feels,
um,

1403
01:23:01.190 --> 01:23:05.830
it feels,
you feel connected to people,
which I think is of part of the,

1404
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:10.240
<v 3>the trip here.
That's part it kind of part of the goal.
Oh,
for sure.
Well,</v>

1405
01:23:10.241 --> 01:23:13.510
I think anything with a basis and storytelling at some point,
I mean,

1406
01:23:13.511 --> 01:23:16.850
you're making a lot of connections through this.
Uh,
I think there's,

1407
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:18.160
we are hardwired for this,

1408
01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:23.270
this Joseph Campbell like experience even in our own lives.
Um,

1409
01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:27.250
I'd love to ask just a couple of rapid fire questions.
The first is,

1410
01:23:27.251 --> 01:23:31.390
when you hear the word successful,
who's the first person that comes to mind?
Wow.

1411
01:23:34.730 --> 01:23:39.500
<v 2>Oh,
I like listening to this on your show.
I don't like answering it.
Um,</v>

1412
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:43.050
let's see.
I guess

1413
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:50.160
just a straight knee jerk knee jerk gates.
Okay.
And not be,
you know why?

1414
01:23:50.161 --> 01:23:54.030
Because,
because I'm not because of the richest guy,

1415
01:23:54.031 --> 01:23:59.010
but because of his,
because of how he shifted his,
um,

1416
01:24:00.570 --> 01:24:05.570
his priorities because he's now making tremendous impact with the hand he's been

1417
01:24:07.021 --> 01:24:09.420
dealt or the,
the,
the pot that he's built up

1418
01:24:11.550 --> 01:24:13.240
that he's making a,

1419
01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:17.760
<v 3>that there's one,
there's like,
there's like the bill gates from,</v>

1420
01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:20.550
there's the Microsoft Bill Gates and there's the Post Microsoft Bill Gates.
And,

1421
01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:24.870
and to me there's something fascinating about that and that he was able to be

1422
01:24:24.871 --> 01:24:27.090
effective in what his goals were for the first

1423
01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:32.570
<v 2>chapter and then what his goals are now,
which are very different.</v>

1424
01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:36.920
So he was able to shift his entire
shift,

1425
01:24:36.921 --> 01:24:40.160
his entire
agenda

1426
01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:43.750
<v 3>and,
and,
and be effective.
He completely effective on this area.</v>

1427
01:24:43.751 --> 01:24:48.520
Similar metric driven,
hardcore approach.
And I don't know a lot about the,

1428
01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:53.370
honestly,
I bet this is purely layman's perspective of hey,
there's a lot of,

1429
01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:56.310
this is how many lives have been saved by this or this is the,

1430
01:24:57.090 --> 01:24:57.923
<v 2>mmm.</v>

1431
01:24:58.350 --> 01:25:02.070
<v 3>This many people have agreed to have charitable donations,
but it's just,
uh,</v>

1432
01:25:02.730 --> 01:25:05.880
there's something that,
that he's just the first name that popped into my head.

1433
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:09.770
Any particular director who comes to mind?
Director or writer?

1434
01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:13.930
There's a few,
you know,
and they're all different.
Like I worked with [inaudible],

1435
01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:17.430
um,
and I think that he's been,

1436
01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:21.630
<v 2>I think there's a certain,</v>

1437
01:25:22.710 --> 01:25:25.340
<v 3>it must be w when I came up and what he represented,</v>

1438
01:25:25.341 --> 01:25:27.320
and then I got to meet with him and see him work.

1439
01:25:27.321 --> 01:25:31.790
And so he's inspired me as far as what his body of working and who he is as a

1440
01:25:31.791 --> 01:25:33.420
person.
Uh,

1441
01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:36.950
but I also think of like the Cohen Brothers who've managed to

1442
01:25:38.910 --> 01:25:43.080
tickle their own fancy and enjoy everything they're doing and have tremendous

1443
01:25:43.081 --> 01:25:46.530
variety and entertain people as well,

1444
01:25:47.190 --> 01:25:52.140
but seem to have
maintained a certain balance,

1445
01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:56.860
a healthy balance between their work and,
and their private lives.
And they,

1446
01:25:57.130 --> 01:25:58.800
I haven't dealt with them that much,

1447
01:25:58.801 --> 01:26:03.030
but they see my genuinely like well adjusted normal nice people who happen to

1448
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:06.140
make really exciting,
cool movies.

1449
01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:09.590
And then Jim Cameron,
who's sort of the other end of the spectrum,

1450
01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:14.210
who's kind of the guy who's reinvented aspects of the industry over and over

1451
01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:18.290
again with tremendous,
uh,
uh,
enthusiasm and,

1452
01:26:19.130 --> 01:26:22.550
uh,
and uh,
and,
and also just

1453
01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:28.970
a sharp intellect that's into solving problems and changing the way we do the

1454
01:26:28.971 --> 01:26:33.470
magic tricks.
And,
and I'm sure I've certainly inherited a lot of what he,

1455
01:26:33.471 --> 01:26:36.620
of the ground that he broke with Avatar with jungle book.

1456
01:26:36.621 --> 01:26:38.930
A lot of the same technology allows the same people I'm working with.

1457
01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:44.150
So there's a,
you know,
a healthy respect.
And then Walt Disney is another one who,

1458
01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.553
um,

1459
01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:48.950
I had researched quite a bit back around the time of iron man too when we were

1460
01:26:48.951 --> 01:26:53.720
referencing him and,
uh,
in the stark expo and the stark,
the old stark archives.

1461
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:58.790
Uh,
but he was a bit of a techie at his time and a bit of a storyteller too.

1462
01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:03.620
And so he was doing the,
you know,
what he was doing at his time is like,

1463
01:27:03.650 --> 01:27:06.590
it seems like what Pixar is doing now.
It's like cutting edge technology,

1464
01:27:06.591 --> 01:27:09.260
great stories,
great emotion,
uh,

1465
01:27:10.190 --> 01:27:12.620
telling stories with a different set of tools and nobody ever had before.

1466
01:27:13.370 --> 01:27:15.660
And there's something,
there's something really,
uh,

1467
01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:21.230
<v 1>to me,
I think,
uh,
he was,
he's one of those key key figures.
Oh,</v>

1468
01:27:21.231 --> 01:27:22.390
it's total hacker.
Uh,
they,

1469
01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:27.040
they display a bunch of his old cobbled together macgyver like rigs at the

1470
01:27:27.190 --> 01:27:31.000
Disney family museum in San Francisco.
Presidio.
Yeah.
Which is amazing.

1471
01:27:31.810 --> 01:27:35.680
What is the book that you've gifted the most other people?
Um,

1472
01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:39.710
<v 3>actually the writer's journey was one of them.
I've given your book,</v>

1473
01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:43.550
I've given four hour body the people.
Thank you for that.
Given that,
uh,

1474
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:48.290
um,
those are the biggies.
I'm trying to think of it as anything else.

1475
01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:54.020
I did grow when I first started off in acting.

1476
01:27:54.021 --> 01:27:57.800
I gifted growed Ann's book to my family.
Uh,
his first book,

1477
01:27:57.801 --> 01:28:01.640
it would be so nice if you weren't here because it really told the story about

1478
01:28:01.670 --> 01:28:05.720
how difficult it is when you're first starting off trying to be an actor and he

1479
01:28:05.721 --> 01:28:08.850
had such a great voice.
Uh,
other than that,
I can't,

1480
01:28:08.851 --> 01:28:12.980
not none are jumping or jumping to mind.
That's three though.
Right?

1481
01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:16.900
<v 1>That's plenty.
That's plenty.
Uh,
last question.
Uh,</v>

1482
01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:19.180
actually the two,
they're pretty quick.

1483
01:28:19.181 --> 01:28:23.050
The first is what advice would you give to your 20 year old self?

1484
01:28:23.810 --> 01:28:28.220
<v 3>Wow.
Um,
uh,
he wouldn't listen.
30 year old self.</v>

1485
01:28:32.890 --> 01:28:37.250
MMM.
I think

1486
01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:39.993
<v 4>okay.</v>

1487
01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:41.560
<v 3>To not confuse</v>

1488
01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:47.770
how you feel about something with how that thing really is.

1489
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:51.520
I think you think you're being more objective than you really are.

1490
01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:57.360
And you were colored by emotion more than you think you are in,

1491
01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:00.880
in positive ways and negative ways.
But,
but it's um,

1492
01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:06.900
perspective is,
is,
um,
is much more subjective than you.
Thank you.

1493
01:29:06.901 --> 01:29:08.510
Think you're a lot more uh,

1494
01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:13.800
objective and then you are to me specifically at 30 and 20,

1495
01:29:13.801 --> 01:29:16.860
I don't even know how it wasn't even a human being.
What I would say,

1496
01:29:16.861 --> 01:29:21.150
it's funny because it's,
part of it is just the ignorance of,
of walking into,

1497
01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:22.080
you know,
the the,

1498
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:25.380
the forest and not knowing where I was going and whatever it was getting me

1499
01:29:25.381 --> 01:29:28.710
through it.
You know,
thank,
thankfully I had enough,

1500
01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:33.270
something in the back of my mind told me to just take that road and walk,

1501
01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:36.540
not knowing where it was going.
And so that was,
um,

1502
01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:42.180
so I'm very grateful.
I like where I am.
I like what the experience of my life is.

1503
01:29:42.690 --> 01:29:45.390
I'd like every year I like better.
I like who I am better.

1504
01:29:45.391 --> 01:29:49.740
I like what my life is better.
Um,
so,
uh,

1505
01:29:50.290 --> 01:29:54.000
it,
I'm very reluctant to interfere with the way things were,

1506
01:29:54.570 --> 01:29:58.820
but I think a lot of is how I feel about things and what I do too,
how I,

1507
01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:03.750
how I kind of balance things out,
um,
in a way that is,
is,

1508
01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:07.020
uh,
that I'm proud of that I like.
Well,

1509
01:30:07.021 --> 01:30:09.000
I love your work and thank you so much for the time.

1510
01:30:09.001 --> 01:30:13.380
Where can people find out more about you,
find you online?
He,
let's see.

1511
01:30:13.381 --> 01:30:15.070
I don't know.
I uh,
I'm on,
uh,

1512
01:30:15.150 --> 01:30:19.870
Twitter and Facebook at John Underscore Fabro uh,

1513
01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:24.900
on Twitter and then Facebook I think is just Jon Favreau and Instagram.

1514
01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:28.080
Jon Favreau.
It's pretty consistent.
I've been working.

1515
01:30:28.081 --> 01:30:32.100
So there's not a lot of stuff up there.
Uh,
you know,
I'm on there when we do like,

1516
01:30:32.101 --> 01:30:35.600
we do pop ups once in a while in Los Angeles.
Maybe we'll do one up north,
uh,

1517
01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:39.010
for the,
from the food from chef.
Oh,
that'd be great.
So we,

1518
01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:41.670
we've been doing that of design to have not only Cuban,

1519
01:30:41.671 --> 01:30:42.750
but the grilled cheese sandwich.

1520
01:30:42.751 --> 01:30:44.970
I'm sure you must hear about that a lot so I could cook them.

1521
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.210
I cook them for the crew at a movie.
I cook them for my kids.

1522
01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:51.580
I cook them here at the,
uh,
in the editing rooms.
Uh,

1523
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:54.790
but I enjoy cooking and we've cooked together.
I think we have,

1524
01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:59.220
I reveal that definitely.
I have a cooked,
cooked [inaudible].

1525
01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:02.550
That was an amazing experience for Superbowl.
Oh,
good.

1526
01:31:02.730 --> 01:31:05.310
You had never done that before.
I know it was.
That was what we're talking about.

1527
01:31:05.311 --> 01:31:08.940
Here we were,
we didn't really know each other that well.
I read your stuff,

1528
01:31:08.941 --> 01:31:11.370
you saw my stuff,
and then Lo and behold,
you put some,

1529
01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:16.210
some hot oil there and the focus is no longer.
I want an honor.

1530
01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:21.570
Thank you for your,
your,
uh,
fingers out scalded keeping all your fingers.
Well,

1531
01:31:21.571 --> 01:31:25.200
John,
thank you so much.
Uh,
there's,
there's tons more to explore.
Everybody.

1532
01:31:25.201 --> 01:31:27.000
I'll put links in the show notes too,

1533
01:31:27.001 --> 01:31:29.550
where you could find John and thanks so much for your [inaudible].
All right,

1534
01:31:29.551 --> 01:31:34.210
great.
And thank you too.
I love,
I love the podcast,
but I,
uh,
you've,
um,

1535
01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:37.480
I know this is about me,
not about you,
but I,
I,
I,

1536
01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:42.360
I got to know you through your writing and uh,
I was very,

1537
01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:47.490
you're very,
uh,
intriguing.
I get pulled into your work.

1538
01:31:47.491 --> 01:31:51.060
You make it very easy to read your stuff.
It had been recommended,

1539
01:31:51.061 --> 01:31:52.770
I think for our body was recommended to me.

1540
01:31:52.771 --> 01:31:55.170
And one of those things where you just pick a chapter here,
chapter there,

1541
01:31:55.180 --> 01:32:00.010
next thing you know,
you're reading the whole thing and your approach to,
uh,

1542
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:04.540
questioning things and curating research and fact based,

1543
01:32:05.170 --> 01:32:08.140
but not being,
you know,
it seems like there's always,

1544
01:32:08.410 --> 01:32:09.460
you always are either dealing with,

1545
01:32:09.461 --> 01:32:12.160
dealing with the scientific method where something has to have been through a

1546
01:32:12.161 --> 01:32:16.000
double blind study or at completely anecdotal.
There's,

1547
01:32:16.001 --> 01:32:17.980
there was no middle ground of what's interesting about,

1548
01:32:17.981 --> 01:32:21.100
about your stuff as you'll say,
hey look,
here's what I've experienced.

1549
01:32:21.250 --> 01:32:23.710
Here's the sample that I've seen this experience with.

1550
01:32:23.711 --> 01:32:26.140
It's not something that should be looked at scientifically,

1551
01:32:26.710 --> 01:32:31.210
but there are certain indications that this is worth looking into more.

1552
01:32:31.570 --> 01:32:33.370
And here's what I do and here's what I've done.

1553
01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:38.880
And it makes it much more inviting than either the very walled off world of

1554
01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:44.590
traditional academia and academia.
And then also this,
uh,

1555
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:48.520
I dunno,
science that's more based on,

1556
01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:53.530
on anecdotal information that doesn't take science into consideration as much.

1557
01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:57.910
But to acknowledge that science has an importance to it,
but also looking at how,

1558
01:32:58.530 --> 01:33:03.190
uh,
what has not yet gone through that machine might have some truth to it too.

1559
01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:08.410
And giving full disclosure of your context and why makes it not,

1560
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:12.160
um,
intellectually offensive.
You know,
it feels like you're,

1561
01:33:12.161 --> 01:33:16.250
it could be responsible intellectually,
not flying in the face of science,
but,

1562
01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:20.980
but you're also opening it up to new ways of thinking and,
and you know,

1563
01:33:20.981 --> 01:33:22.960
I think it relates to the way you,
your context,

1564
01:33:22.990 --> 01:33:27.880
the whole world that you're the whole northern California way of ethos of

1565
01:33:27.881 --> 01:33:32.830
looking at things and how to,
how,
how to be more effective and efficient in,

1566
01:33:32.831 --> 01:33:37.000
uh,
in approaching problems that we still face.
So,
uh,

1567
01:33:37.150 --> 01:33:39.520
I love looking at your stuff and like I said,
thank you.
The three,

1568
01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:44.700
the four hour chef was really was a great a counterbalance to the other chef,

1569
01:33:44.930 --> 01:33:49.320
um,
biographies that I was reading or autobiographies or,
uh,

1570
01:33:49.450 --> 01:33:54.280
cooking books and documentaries.
I was watching.
And then here was the,
uh,

1571
01:33:54.370 --> 01:33:59.140
a very concise version of a lot of the same information.
Um,

1572
01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:03.010
that was a really good,
a really good counterbalance.
Well,
I,
I,

1573
01:34:03.150 --> 01:34:06.220
I really appreciate it and I love watching your experiments.

1574
01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:09.820
I love watching you do the,
the huge blockbusters than do chef.

1575
01:34:09.821 --> 01:34:11.890
I can't wait to see what you do next.
Well,
I know,

1576
01:34:12.250 --> 01:34:15.170
I guess I'm waiting to see jungle book,
Jungle Book right here.

1577
01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:18.040
It's going to be amazing.
It's going to be something different and cool.

1578
01:34:18.041 --> 01:34:21.540
And you know,
just like everything else,
the doing,

1579
01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:25.390
doing one with this level of technology,
which I,
you know,

1580
01:34:25.391 --> 01:34:29.950
I got a taste of here and there with iron man,
but to really throw the,

1581
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:35.070
throw the whole thing into have the home movie rely on that magic trick working

1582
01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:39.070
is,
uh,
it's,
it's,
um,
exhilarating,

1583
01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:42.070
but if it all works as well as it looks like it will,
it's,
it's,

1584
01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:45.070
it'll be something nobody had seen before.
So it's,
it's exciting stuff.

1585
01:34:45.130 --> 01:34:47.410
I can't wait to see it and we'll John to be continued.

1586
01:34:47.411 --> 01:34:50.440
Thank you so much for the time.
Right.
My pleasure.
