00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.840
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:07.841
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking it now as a

3
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.420
like
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

4
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.500
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by four sigmatic.</v>

5
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.350
You might remember four sigmatic mushroom coffee,

6
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.520
which was created by those clever finished founders and when I first mentioned

7
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.960
that coffee on this podcast,

8
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.440
the product sold out in less than a week at lights you up like a Christmas tree,

9
00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:41.990
which can be really useful.
However,

10
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.400
recently I've been testing the opposite side of the spectrum and new product and

11
00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:51.230
that is their Reishi mushroom elixir to help me end my day to get to sleep.

12
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.140
As you guys may know,
longtime listeners,

13
00:00:54.141 --> 00:00:57.860
at least I struggled with insomnia for decades.
I have a largely fixed that,

14
00:00:57.861 --> 00:01:00.950
but still shutting off my monkey brain has never been easy,

15
00:01:00.951 --> 00:01:03.680
still isn't easy very often and I found Reishi,

16
00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:07.070
which I've been fascinated by for a few years now,
has been very,

17
00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:11.000
very effective and calming their old formula.
However,

18
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:15.890
forcing Maddix old formula included Stevia and I like to avoid sweeteners,

19
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.710
all sweeteners for a host of reasons,

20
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.730
and I then just ping them and asked,
hey guys,

21
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.440
I would love to experiment with this and maybe actually suggested,

22
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.900
but I'd like a version without sweeteners if you'd be open to it,

23
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.160
if too much of a headache,
don't worry.

24
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.330
And they are always game for experimentation.

25
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.050
So they created a special custom version without the Stevia,
without sweeteners.

26
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.600
Now it is part of my nightly routine.

27
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.720
Their ratio looks or comes in single serving packets,

28
00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:46.340
which are perfect for travel.
And in fact,

29
00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:49.190
I'm about to leave the country right now and I have a packet in front of me

30
00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:52.730
that's just going to sit in the end of my carry on bag.

31
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.690
You only need hot water and it mixes very,
very easily.

32
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.460
Here's some recommended copy that they put in the read,

33
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.240
so I'm going to read it and then I'll give you my take quote,
a warning.

34
00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:06.800
For those in the experimental mindset,

35
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.310
Reishi is strong and bitter in parentheses like any great medicine.

36
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.870
So if the bitterness is too much,

37
00:02:11.871 --> 00:02:16.200
I recommend trying it with honey end or nut milk such as almond milk and quote,

38
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.380
so I'm going to say no,

39
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.910
you should suck it up and you should drink the tea because it's not that bitter

40
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.110
and maybe should take the advice of all Chinese people when they're criticizing

41
00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:29.630
younguns.
When they say Boone,
I'm sure cool.

42
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.030
Which means you're not able to eat bitterness.

43
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.060
Bitter is in many cases and indication of things that help liver detoxification

44
00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:39.950
and so on.
Not saying that's the case here,

45
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:44.750
but I've tested this ratio lecture on family members,

46
00:02:44.751 --> 00:02:48.560
on friends.
Everybody has liked it.
It's a little bit earthy.
It's not that hard,

47
00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:51.050
so I would just say suck it up and no,

48
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.250
don't put in honey or milk or any of that shit.
Just drink the goddamn tea.

49
00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:58.340
It's delicious,
I think.
Right?
If you like poo air,
that kind of stuff,

50
00:02:58.341 --> 00:03:01.870
that type of tea,
you're going to dig it,
so just try it.
Okay.

51
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.980
Back to then my read.
If you'd like to naturally improve your sleep,

52
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.900
both onset and quality,

53
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:12.901
I think naturally you might just enjoy this ratio elixir without any sweeteners.

54
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.650
It has organic,
Reishi extract,
organic fueled to mint extract,

55
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:22.150
organic rose hips extract,
organic Tulsi extract,
and that's it.

56
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.280
No fancy stuff,
no artificial watching McCall at anything.
So check it out.

70
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.700
This episode is brought to you by we work.
I love,
we work.

71
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.420
I haven't had an office in many,
many,
many,
many,

72
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:33.421
many years since 2000 or so when I had my last real job I suppose and quotation

73
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:39.220
marks,
but when I moved from San Francisco to Austin,
not long guy decided,

74
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.110
you know what,
I'm tired of working at home.

75
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.090
I'm tired or we're going to coffee shops.

76
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.650
So one of the very first things I did was to get a space at we work.

77
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.440
I could not be happier with this change in my life.

78
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.030
We work is a global network of workspaces where companies and people grow

79
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:58.870
together.
The idea is really simple.
You focus on your business and we work,

80
00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:03.070
takes care of all of the rest,
including front desk service,
utilities,

81
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.750
refreshments and more.

82
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.430
I also often have things shipped from Amazon and elsewhere to my office that we

83
00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:10.780
work here in Austin.

84
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.070
I've been completely blown away by the members only events,

85
00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:16.300
special offers,

86
00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:20.410
and perhaps the best cold brew coffee on tap that I've ever had.

87
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.660
It's been amazing.
It's been a real,

88
00:05:22.661 --> 00:05:27.340
real change in my life and improve my quality of life and there are also dog

89
00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:31.000
friendly.
We work locations all over the place.
How Fun is that?

90
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.440
We work caters to everyone from entrepreneurs and freelancers to start ups and

91
00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:39.930
even large enterprises including Ge,
salesforce,
Microsoft,
mastercard,

92
00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:44.530
Samsung,
Spotify,
Pinterest,
and red bull among many others.
In fact,

93
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.250
more than 10% of fortune 500 companies currently use.

94
00:05:48.251 --> 00:05:51.340
We work and it's a rapidly growing group.
In other words,

95
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.020
it's not just solar printers and to ground level startups that use we work,

96
00:05:56.021 --> 00:06:01.021
but everything from that to the big companies who are seeing very huge benefits

97
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.863
as well.

98
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.140
We work believes that creating spaces where people can connect and create

99
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:08.600
meaning together,
right?
And after all,

100
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.530
if you are someone who has built a business modeled on the principles and the

101
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:15.080
four hour workweek or elsewhere,
it can be a lonely road.

102
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:17.750
Sometimes even though you're digitally connected,
it can feel very,

103
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:18.710
very isolating.

104
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.270
So in these spaces you can connect with real humans and uh,

105
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.260
all the while you space more efficiently and cost effectively,

106
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:30.980
which makes you and your business better equipped to face the challenges of

107
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:34.910
today and tomorrow.
We work now has more than 200 locations,

108

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.820
Dan,
welcome to the show.
Tim,
thanks for having me.

129
00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.620
It has been quite awhile since we allow years,
several years.

130
00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:06.450
And uh,
I know we were talking about all things Japanese most likely,
uh,

131
00:08:06.451 --> 00:08:10.770
at least in,
in one of our recent conversations based on one of your books.
Uh,

132
00:08:10.771 --> 00:08:15.030
and maybe you could tell people actually just as context a little bit about that

133
00:08:15.031 --> 00:08:19.200
book that we were chatting about in Monga format or Japanese comic format.

134
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.210
And we'll use that as a jumping off point.

135
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.470
<v 3>Yes,
indeed.
That was one of my best ideas.
That didn't go anywhere.</v>

136
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.890
<v 2>MMM.
MMM.
Um,</v>

137
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.800
<v 3>so I,
that was a book called the adventures of Johnny Bunko.
And,</v>

138
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:36.890
and as you say,
Tim,
it was written in the Japanese comic format known as Monga.

139
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.100
And as you know,
as a Japan of file in Japan,
Mongo,

140
00:08:41.101 --> 00:08:42.540
the comic format is,

141
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.650
is much more versatile and more widely used than it is here in the United
States.

142
00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:49.470
So,
uh,
so you grown ups who reading comics,

143
00:08:49.471 --> 00:08:53.160
and it can be things about financial advice,
things about love,
life,

144
00:08:53.161 --> 00:08:54.450
things about history.

145
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.190
And so I did a fellowship in Japan with my wife and our three kids where I

146
00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:02.880
studied the Monga industry and I came back and said,
you know what?

147
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:08.330
I think it's time for Monga to broaden its reach here in the United States of

148
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:09.301
America.

149
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:14.301
So I wrote a book called the adventures of Johnny Bunko and it's a,

150
00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.480
uh,
graphic novel in a Manga form,
uh,

151
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.430
that reveals the six essential lessons of any satisfying,

152
00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:28.110
productive career through the story of a hapless young accountant named Johnny

153
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.943
Bunko.

154
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:34.420
<v 2>That was a fantastically concise description.
And I wanted to also,</v>

155
00:09:34.421 --> 00:09:39.340
you said in the beginning that it was the best idea that didn't go anywhere or

156
00:09:39.341 --> 00:09:40.480
something along those lines.

157
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:45.400
And I wanted to bring up the book because it seems for those people,

158
00:09:45.401 --> 00:09:50.401
it struck a chord with it struck very deep cord and I believe it was Kevin

159
00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.850
Kelly,
arguably the most interesting man in the world who was on this yet.

160
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.690
And he mentioned that that book was at least at the time,

161
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.070
his most gifted book.

162
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:05.400
So I wanted to at least highlight the fact that if it's good enough for Kevin

163
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.630
Kelly,
it should be good enough for many,
many other people.

164
00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.500
<v 3>That's like,
that's exactly right.
Oh,
Kevin has.</v>

165
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.870
Kevin did say that and I actually think it's a good book.

166
00:10:12.871 --> 00:10:16.800
We did reasonably well with it.
It didn't blow off the doors.
I think I was,

167
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.580
you know,
and this is a,
this is a common,
uh,
thing that happens in,
in,

168
00:10:20.581 --> 00:10:25.440
in life and an investing in entrepreneurship and publishing and anything is that

169
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:29.490
you can be right too early.
I think that's what it was.

170
00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:34.690
That that I actually think that this format of graphic novels and comics having

171
00:10:34.691 --> 00:10:38.740
a more expansive region,
the United States is probably going to happen.
Uh,

172
00:10:38.741 --> 00:10:42.040
I might've been as they would say in my,
in,
in,
in the world of politics,

173
00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:43.600
I might've been a little ahead of the voters

174
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:49.040
<v 2>or using a surfing metaphor,
paddling a little too early for the wave,</v>

175
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.040
which take thing,

176
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.170
which sometimes means you don't catch a wave and investing at sometimes mean

177
00:10:54.171 --> 00:10:58.550
you'd paddle right into the impact zone and then get smashed that you mentioned,

178
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:03.190
you mentioned politics.
I wasn't going to go here right away.
Oh boy.
But,

179
00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.900
and I'm going to get there in two hops,

180
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.960
but so I'm looking at in front of me the Yale Law and policy review volume eight

181
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.040
number two 1990 and it says it like top,

182
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.910
<v 3>this is like a,
it's like a deposition exhibit a</v>

183
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.000
30 years ago that you're going to make me pay for.
Right now

184
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:30.440
<v 2>I'm auditioning indirectly I'll be at for my role on true TV as tell dad.</v>

185
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.210
But this won't go into any incriminating territory unless you volunteer or

186
00:11:36.211 --> 00:11:39.150
something along those lines.
Which I,
which I doubt will happen,

187
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.300
but it says on top of the editor and chief Daniel h pink.

188
00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:47.100
So how did fate intervene that you are not currently in the legal profession?

189
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:48.703
<v 3>Oh my God,</v>

190
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:53.980
this is the one area where I want to thank for or her grace and kindness.

191
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.640
Um,
here's the thing.
I,

192
00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:01.670
I went to law school and I went to law school largely because I was a middle

193
00:12:02.951 --> 00:12:07.630
class kid from the middle of America and that's kind of what you did.

194
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:13.200
And once I started saw the inside and it was a terrible decision and it actually

195
00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:16.960
helped me figure out how to make better decisions.
Um,

196
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:20.290
it gave me some were actually really good advice on how to make better
decisions.

197
00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:22.810
But I basically went to law school without knowing what lawyers did or even what

198
00:12:22.811 --> 00:12:23.644
law school was.

199
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.350
It was just something I did because that's what I was supposed to do.

200
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.570
I found out I didn't really like it very much.
And I,

201
00:12:28.571 --> 00:12:30.790
and once I found out what lawyers actually did,

202
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:32.560
and God bless the lawyers listening to this,

203
00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:37.540
but once I found out what lawyers actually did,
I was like,
Oh,

204
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:42.190
you,
you hire somebody else to do that.
You know,
it's like,
like,
you know,

205
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.410
it's like,
I mean,
it's like,
it takes like,

206
00:12:44.411 --> 00:12:48.880
it takes skill to like plunge a toilet or you know,
you know,
that kind of thing.

207
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.560
Um,
or you know,
uh,
uh,
mow a gigantic backyard.
I mean,

208
00:12:53.561 --> 00:12:56.830
it takes skill to do that.
It's just that,
you know what,
it's really not my thing.

209
00:12:56.831 --> 00:13:00.160
And so what I'd rather do is do something else and then pay someone else to do

210
00:13:00.161 --> 00:13:01.710
that kind of dirty work.
Um,

211
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.140
and yet I found myself stuck and because I was risk averse that I did leave for

212
00:13:05.141 --> 00:13:08.770
a little while.
Actually I dropped out for a little while,
but I came back.
Um,

213
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.670
and um,
and so I went to la,
so I went to law school.
It wasn't a,
you know,

214
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.780
Greg accumulated massive,
massive,
massive,
massive student loans.

215
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.560
But I was very fortunate in two dimensions in my law school trajectory.

216
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.210
One was that my school had a ve,
a very pro,

217
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:30.160
uh,
ahead of its time loan payback program,
uh,
t to salary.

218
00:13:30.161 --> 00:13:32.500
So if you made less than a certain amount,

219
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.530
they would offer assistance in repaying your student loans.

220
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.980
And that gave people much more,
nobody,
not many people took it,

221
00:13:38.981 --> 00:13:43.030
but that gave you theoretically more career flexibility if you decided not to

222
00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:46.840
practice law.
The other thing is that I met my wife in law school,
so it's,
it's,

223
00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:47.674
um,

224
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:52.120
it's a decision that ended up having a profound positive effect on my life.

225
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.960
How does it help you learn to make better decisions?

226
00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.810
The law going to law school,
he said,
well,
here's the thing.
Okay.
You know,

227
00:14:01.811 --> 00:14:04.030
here's what I did.
Here's what I did.
And here's the thing.
I,
okay,

228
00:14:04.031 --> 00:14:07.990
so there's this principle in social science.
It has a fancy name,

229
00:14:07.991 --> 00:14:11.920
but it is something that we all do and it's something that we should do is a

230
00:14:11.921 --> 00:14:15.700
principle of surrogation.
Okay.
How do you make decisions?

231
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:19.960
You use the principle of surrogation and surrogation basically means find

232
00:14:19.961 --> 00:14:24.250
someone like you who made this decision and see what happened to him or her.

233
00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.910
That is,
find out what it's really like.
It's a,
again,

234
00:14:27.911 --> 00:14:32.330
this is a totally fancified way of something that is very common sensical Wa,

235
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:36.910
you know,
should I go to this restaurant?
Well let me check the Yelp reviews up.

236
00:14:36.911 --> 00:14:40.490
47 other people who've gone through this restaurant and what I did.

237
00:14:40.491 --> 00:14:41.680
And it's amazing to me,
Tim,

238
00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:44.860
when I think about this and it's advice that I give to my own kids as well.

239
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:49.060
I went to law school,
literally having never spent a day,

240
00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.710
but not a day,
10 minutes talking to him lawyer.

241
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.250
But that's absolutely the case.

242
00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:02.110
I went to law school having never sat in on a law school class.
I mean,

243
00:15:02.111 --> 00:15:04.630
it's unbelievable to me in retrospect.
And,

244
00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:07.000
and so had I done those kinds of things,

245
00:15:07.001 --> 00:15:11.590
I might have approached it more skeptically.
Um,
but I didn't do those things.

246
00:15:11.591 --> 00:15:16.330
And so,
uh,
and,
and because that ended up being an incredibly expensive decision,

247
00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.170
even though it led to some pot,
you know,
it basically,
I mean,

248
00:15:20.171 --> 00:15:22.480
it led to the most positive thing in my life,
which is my wife,

249
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:25.590
even though it led to something positive,
it was a terrible decision.

250
00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:29.330
So now I'm Ma,
I'm sort of a,
um,
uh,

251
00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.730
a surrogation,
uh,
idealogue,
you know,

252
00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:36.840
it's like I believe in segregation for everything.
Um,

253
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.140
largely because I got bitten by that bad decision.

254
00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:45.110
<v 2>Could you give us an example of at some fork in the road or some perspective</v>

255
00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:48.380
decision where you've used surrogation or where you're planning on using it?

256
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.860
<v 3>Okay.
So I'll give you an example of it.
So,
um,
yeah,
it's,
you know,
again,</v>

257
00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:56.130
we're not talking rocket science here.
We're talking to like basically,
hey,

258
00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.660
act like a reasonably intelligent grownup is,
it is what it is,
you know,

259
00:16:00.661 --> 00:16:03.360
is basically what I'm when I'm doing here.
But let's go back to the,

260
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.420
let's go back to the Japan.
Uh,
I think I saw,

261
00:16:06.421 --> 00:16:09.360
I got a fellowship to go to Japan and I went with my wife and our,

262
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.030
and our kids as I mentioned.
But before I did that,

263
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:17.300
I talked to six different people who had the same fellowship before I accepted

264
00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.650
six different people who had the same fellowship,

265
00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.680
what it was like for their kids,
what would,
what the work was like,

266
00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:26.400
what the living was like before I made the decision.
Now again,

267
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.880
that is not a monumental intellectual breakthrough,

268
00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:34.500
but it's something that I didn't do when I was much younger.

269
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:39.550
<v 2>Well,
it's,
it's a best practice that can often get skipped,
right?</v>

270
00:16:39.551 --> 00:16:42.910
Whether that's something like this or something,

271
00:16:42.911 --> 00:16:45.310
it should be very straight forward.
If you look at say a tool,

272
00:16:45.311 --> 00:16:50.311
go on days work and the checklist manifesto in checking various things to avoid

273
00:16:50.501 --> 00:16:53.530
bacteria line infections in the hospital,
right?
It's very straightforward,

274
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:57.610
but if you neglect it over time,
bad things are gonna happen.

275
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.430
<v 3>But it's also the,
you know,
I think that as,</v>

276
00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:06.320
as I've gotten older and gotten more experience,
I've actually,

277
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.593
um,

278
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:12.410
become much more aware of the importance of intellectual humility.

279
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.350
And like what,
you know,
not always.
When I think of when I was younger,
I felt,

280
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.730
well I,
I know what it law schools like how do you know?

281
00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:22.230
I just know because I thought about it once.
And so I know,
uh,

282
00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:26.360
I know what lawyers do because like I met somebody who was a lawyer and I know

283
00:17:26.361 --> 00:17:27.194
what lawyers,
you know,

284
00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:30.320
and so there's a degree of arrogance in that I'm thinking that you know

285
00:17:30.321 --> 00:17:31.670
something when you actually don't.

286
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:35.600
And so if you approach all kinds of decisions with a degree of intellectual

287
00:17:35.601 --> 00:17:40.430
humility and ask yourself,
what don't I know about this,
where am I blind spots?

288
00:17:40.431 --> 00:17:42.260
And then I think you end up making better decisions.

289
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.810
<v 2>Definitely.
Speaking of blind spots,</v>

290
00:17:45.811 --> 00:17:50.120
I promised I would segue into politics and that is somewhere,
uh,

291
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.690
I have very,
very little confidence in any of my knowledge or expertise.

292
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:55.950
How did you,

293
00:17:56.130 --> 00:18:00.390
so it was looking at what I believe to be one of your first articles that
really,

294
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:04.710
I'm not going to say put you on the map.
That's too,
too much of an overstatement.

295
00:18:04.711 --> 00:18:08.340
But the,
the free agent nation article in Fast Company,

296
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.360
which was at the end of 1990.
Yeah,
1997.

297
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:17.930
And in the bio or the byline rather of that article it says until recently,

298
00:18:18.121 --> 00:18:21.060
chief speech writer to Vice President Al Gore.

299
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:26.150
So where did you go from law school or dropping out of law school for a period

300
00:18:27.121 --> 00:18:31.770
of time to speech writing for then Vice President Al Gore?

301
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.450
<v 3>Well,
when I graduated from law school,</v>

302
00:18:34.451 --> 00:18:36.880
I was actually very keenly interested in politics.

303
00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.940
It was probably my deepest interest at the time.
And I said,
you know what,

304
00:18:39.941 --> 00:18:41.860
I'm going to go where I'm going to work in politics.

305
00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.150
Why was it interesting to you at the time?
Uh,
but a couple of reasons.

306
00:18:46.151 --> 00:18:48.910
Number one is that I thought it'd be,
it was a venue for,

307
00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:51.940
for achieving something in the world and make a contribution to the world.

308
00:18:51.941 --> 00:18:56.110
The other thing is that I found the actual practice of it quite exciting and

309
00:18:56.111 --> 00:18:59.020
interesting and the way that sports is exciting and interesting.

310
00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:03.140
So it was a combo platter for me.
Um,
and,
uh,

311
00:19:03.141 --> 00:19:05.710
and I'd been interested in it for many,
many years and I said,
okay,
this is,

312
00:19:05.711 --> 00:19:07.090
this is what I,
this is what I want to do.

313
00:19:07.091 --> 00:19:10.270
So I got out of law school and I started working on political campaigns,

314
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:14.290
which at the time I liked because political campaigns are totally interesting.

315
00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.560
I mean,
again,
it's like a sport in that there's,
you know,

316
00:19:17.561 --> 00:19:21.400
there's a beginning and there's an end and there is a clear,
clear outcome.
Uh,

317
00:19:21.401 --> 00:19:25.450
and it's exciting and you're making decisions on the fly.

318
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:30.400
And I find political campaigns more than other kinds of organizations and

319
00:19:30.401 --> 00:19:34.540
institutions fairly meritocratic because there's so much going on.

320
00:19:34.541 --> 00:19:38.260
It's so much crazy stuff happening that if you can do something,

321
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.560
you will continue,
you'll,
you'll be asked to do it again.

322
00:19:41.561 --> 00:19:42.850
And that's pretty much what happened to me.

323
00:19:42.851 --> 00:19:46.420
And that someone at some point asked me to write a speech and I did it and it

324
00:19:46.421 --> 00:19:49.450
was okay.
And then they said,
hey,
that's okay.
You want to do it again?

325
00:19:49.451 --> 00:19:50.410
And I did it again.

326
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.240
And then I did it a third time and all of a sudden that was my job.
Um,
and,

327
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:59.440
and um,
and it ended up being something that I,
I had a certain affinity for.

328
00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:03.550
And um,
and it's something that a lot of other people did not.

329
00:20:03.551 --> 00:20:07.030
And so just in the supply and demand of who has to do what,

330
00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.520
that's what I ended up doing.
And I,
and I enjoyed it.

331
00:20:09.521 --> 00:20:11.170
I did it on political campaigns.

332
00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:16.410
I did it for a cabinet secretary and then I ended up doing it for the,

333
00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.500
I ended up doing it for the vice president.

334
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:25.600
And the trouble was is that when I had spent all these years in the belly of the

335
00:20:26.471 --> 00:20:29.260
beast,
you know,
it's sort of like,
wow,
I really want to work in politics.

336
00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:31.840
And all of a sudden and a pretty kind of half ass way.

337
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:36.700
I was at a pretty good gig in the belly of the beast.
Um,

338
00:20:36.701 --> 00:20:41.560
I realized,
Hey,
I'm not sure this is my thing.

339
00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:46.510
I thought this is my thing,
but I'm discovering that this is not my thing.

340
00:20:46.511 --> 00:20:51.310
And it was even is that if I project out even further,

341
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:52.620
um,
and look at,

342
00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.720
say what I'm going to be like or what I'm going to be doing in 10 years or 20

343
00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:56.080
years,

344
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.170
I really don't like that picture cause I see some of those people around me.

345
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:04.710
<v 2>Hmm.
Is there anything besides the projecting forward,</v>

346
00:21:04.711 --> 00:21:07.980
looking at the people who had been in the game,

347
00:21:07.981 --> 00:21:10.590
so to speak for a longer period of time and saying,
wow,

348
00:21:10.591 --> 00:21:14.310
I could see myself filling their shoes and I don't like what that looks like.

349
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:15.960
Was there anything else,

350
00:21:15.961 --> 00:21:19.320
any other indicators or moments that made you realize it wasn't for you?

351
00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.740
<v 3>There were a few things.
Um,
first of all,</v>

352
00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:29.770
the amount of bs that was involved was startling to me.

353
00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:33.230
I expected some,
but the,
if you do,

354
00:21:33.231 --> 00:21:38.231
if you do a pie chart of bs and not be as the BS slice coordinate,

355
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:40.370
it's extraordinarily large,

356
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:44.120
larger than larger than you would larger than you would imagine.

357
00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.610
I'm on a number of different dimensions.
And here's the thing,
Tim,

358
00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:50.900
I fricking lucked out to and who I was working for because my last two jobs I

359
00:21:50.901 --> 00:21:55.610
worked for Al Gore,
who was a very smart guy and a very good guy all around.

360
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.470
And the guy before that I worked for the then Labor secretary was a speech

361
00:22:00.471 --> 00:22:02.400
writer for the then Labor Secretary,

362
00:22:02.401 --> 00:22:05.870
a guy named Robert Reisch who's a very smart guy and a good guy.

363
00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:10.580
And so I had basically the best kinds of bosses you could possibly have.

364
00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:12.830
Um,
and so that was another indication,

365
00:22:12.831 --> 00:22:16.970
like I got the best bosses that you could possibly have.
And I still like,
hmm,

366
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.360
it's not the species of rice or Gore.
I don't like,

367
00:22:20.361 --> 00:22:24.680
it's the genus of politics that is actually bringing me down,
you know?

368
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:29.450
And so,
uh,
and so among the things that I did in like,
uh,
let's go back to the BS,

369
00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:30.020
uh,

370
00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:35.020
there was an enormous amount of enormous amount of time spent basically,

371
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.270
um,
um,
in the air,

372
00:22:38.271 --> 00:22:41.900
in almost everything that was going on within the boundaries of the law is

373
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:46.580
concerned for basically pandering and fundraising.
Um,

374
00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.920
it was really quite remarkable.

375
00:22:48.921 --> 00:22:53.720
The other thing is that I also felt like I let a lot of the people who are good

376
00:22:53.721 --> 00:22:54.554
people,

377
00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:58.190
that they were so interested and they were so absorbed in the mechanics of

378
00:22:58.191 --> 00:23:00.470
things that they,

379
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.310
I felt like I was losing sight over like what we were doing here in the first

380
00:23:04.311 --> 00:23:08.370
place.
What did we actually,
what do we actually believe in that the,
uh,

381
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:13.070
and there was so much short term ism,
so much short term,

382
00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.910
insane kind of posturing and,
and Ooh,

383
00:23:16.911 --> 00:23:21.890
let's get this slight advantage over the day.
Um,
and um,
and it was like,

384
00:23:21.891 --> 00:23:24.710
what's the point?
What's the point of all this?
I'm working really,

385
00:23:24.711 --> 00:23:27.980
really hard and I'm not sure this is,

386
00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.190
I'm not sure we're actually doing that much.
And here's the scary part is like,

387
00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:36.290
that was 20 years ago.
In retrospect,
those were the good old days,
right?
I mean,

388
00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:39.920
you,
you have,
I mean,
you,
you,
you know,
we were,
I mean,
I'm old enough.

389
00:23:39.921 --> 00:23:41.870
I did as long enough ago where I'd be,

390
00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:46.730
I'd be pumped when something I wrote made it onto the quote unquote evening

391
00:23:46.731 --> 00:23:51.710
news.
I haven't watched the evening news for 19 years,
you know,
um,
uh,

392
00:23:51.711 --> 00:23:55.640
we weren't dealing with social media.
The world was very,
very,

393
00:23:55.641 --> 00:23:59.300
very partisan then,
but nothing like the way it is now.

394
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:04.510
So I remember devoting a couple of days in my office to some subpoena that was

395
00:24:05.211 --> 00:24:09.290
given to Gore's office for finding some document about some nonsense thing and

396
00:24:09.291 --> 00:24:09.951
I'm like,
and I,

397
00:24:09.951 --> 00:24:12.950
and I'm like really concerned about that because I didn't do anything wrong,

398
00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:16.670
but it's like,
oh my God,
if I have an email that mentioned x,
y,

399
00:24:16.671 --> 00:24:19.910
orZ and I don't find it,
and then someone else finds it,

400
00:24:19.911 --> 00:24:23.510
like I'm going to have to hire a lawyer and I didn't sign up for this garbage.

401
00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:28.250
So,
um,
so I finally decided to,
I finally,
yeah.
So,
so again,

402
00:24:28.251 --> 00:24:30.410
this thing that I thought I was deeply,
deeply interested in,

403
00:24:30.411 --> 00:24:34.850
once I actually experienced it,
I found myself far less interested in it then.

404
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:36.380
Then I would have suspected,

405
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:40.460
if you had told me that when I left that job,

406
00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.380
if you had told me 10 years earlier,

407
00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.620
you're going to have this job and you're going to leave it because you're,

408
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:47.000
you're tired of politics,
I would have been very,
very surprised.

409
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:49.460
<v 0>Okay.</v>

410
00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.250
<v 2>If you look back at that experience,</v>

411
00:24:52.251 --> 00:24:56.600
the skills you either had natively or developed,
uh,

412
00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.510
<v 0>okay.</v>

413
00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:01.650
<v 2>How do you prepare your speeches now or,</v>

414
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:06.710
or maybe if we take an example of a speech that you've given that has received

415
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:12.640
very positive feedback or really from your perspective,

416
00:25:12.641 --> 00:25:14.830
engage the audience.
How do you prepare?

417
00:25:14.831 --> 00:25:19.690
How do you go about preparing a 30 minute,
60 minute speech?

418
00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.300
What does,
what does that look like?
Is there any example that you can give us?

419
00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.300
<v 3>Yeah,
I mean it,
it,
it depends.</v>

420
00:25:25.301 --> 00:25:28.750
I mean actually that experience writing speeches was actually extraordinarily

421
00:25:28.751 --> 00:25:31.510
useful in going out and,
you know,

422
00:25:31.511 --> 00:25:34.690
being a writer and then going out and talking about what I've written about.

423
00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:39.070
I mean,
it's extraordinarily useful.
I mean if,
if for one,
if for no other reason,

424
00:25:39.071 --> 00:25:43.350
Tim,
it was because,
you know,
I spent a lot of time as a speech writer,
um,

425
00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:46.810
watching audiences react,
seeing what worked and what,

426
00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.490
seeing what worked and what did it,

427
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:52.840
and that I think has that completely,

428
00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:57.280
uh,
left an imprint on me.
Um,
again,
I was able to,
uh,
you know,

429
00:25:57.281 --> 00:26:00.970
I had this before I went out on doing it myself.

430
00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:04.960
I spent as much time as any human being could have done,

431
00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:09.340
like watching speeches being given,
but I always would watch whenever,

432
00:26:09.341 --> 00:26:11.290
when any of my bosses would give a speech.

433
00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:16.210
I would actually watch the audience rather than my boss,
um,

434
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:20.350
to see,
because that's how I learned how to get better at it.
Hey,
that line works.

435
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:25.210
Hey,
that line's a dud.
Hey,
they're spacing out here.
Hey,
this,

436
00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:30.310
this person over here looks confused.
Um,
wow.
This went on too long.
Wow.

437
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.500
This could have gone on a little blue.
I've never had to experience that.

438
00:26:32.501 --> 00:26:36.970
Could've gone on longer,
but
seriously,

439
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.770
this could,
we could,
we could have,
we could have,
we could have cut it out there.

440
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:43.620
Um,
and so,
um,

441
00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:48.450
so seeing audiences react just gave me a,
I mean it's hard to,
it's almost like,

442
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.130
um,
we think of an analogy here.
Um,

443
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:57.390
okay.
I mean this is an imperfect analogy,
but it's almost like,
um,

444
00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:01.030
um,
I'm going to go,
um,

445
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:06.360
basically walk up and down the streets of Santiago,

446
00:27:06.361 --> 00:27:08.910
Chile for a couple of years.
I'm not going to do any talking,

447
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.090
but I'm going to listen to everybody else talking and it's like,
Whoa,

448
00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:14.370
you can learn some Spanish that way.
It's not going to be,

449
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.870
you're not going to be perfectly Spanish,

450
00:27:15.871 --> 00:27:20.280
but you have a huge advantage of someone if you do that and then go and say,
Hey,

451
00:27:20.281 --> 00:27:21.780
I'm think I'm going to learn how to speak Spanish.

452
00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:26.170
<v 2>It also makes me think of a,
a,</v>

453
00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:29.630
a very useful feature for potential speakers,

454
00:27:29.631 --> 00:27:34.010
although it's probably not worth the Labor for the Ted Organization would be to

455
00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:35.660
take the camera.
See,

456
00:27:35.661 --> 00:27:38.720
that's always pointed at the audience and give you the option of,

457
00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:43.520
of listening to Ted talks while watching the audience respond.

458
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:46.270
<v 3>That's an interesting idea.
That's an interesting idea.
I mean,
they,</v>

459
00:27:46.271 --> 00:27:48.610
they do cutaways on those kinds of things,

460
00:27:48.611 --> 00:27:52.990
but the cutaways don't show people being bored.
Right.
When exactly.

461
00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:57.910
That's actually,
that's actually more revealing than any than,

462
00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:58.780
than anything else.

463
00:27:58.781 --> 00:28:01.690
And I'll tell you like from the speech of givers point of view,

464
00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.420
and it's interesting you raise this Tim,

465
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:06.100
because I haven't really thought a huge amount about it myself,

466
00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:11.460
but one of the things that I enjoy most about giving talks is seeing the

467
00:28:12.311 --> 00:28:17.200
audience's reaction,
um,
and figuring out what's good and what isn't.

468
00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:19.510
So if I come up with a,
hey,
I got this killer line,

469
00:28:19.511 --> 00:28:22.870
I just thought of this is going to totally rule and then I deliver it and it's

470
00:28:22.871 --> 00:28:26.700
like,
Whoa,
that bombed.
Um,

471
00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.570
and in my head I don't feel like,
oh,
I'm so sad that it bombed.

472
00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:36.370
But in the back of my head I'm like,
ha,
that bomb.
That's so interesting.

473
00:28:36.371 --> 00:28:40.750
I got to make a note of that.
Like that one bomb,
you know?
Um,
and why is,

474
00:28:40.751 --> 00:28:45.090
why did that one bomb?
Do people not understand it?
Was it,
was it obnoxious?
Um,

475
00:28:45.091 --> 00:28:49.150
and so I love that part of it.
When you give speeches,

476
00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:51.370
when you do something in real time with people,

477
00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.110
there it really anything before an audience.

478
00:28:53.111 --> 00:28:56.650
So if you and I were talking before a live audience,

479
00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.990
we would be getting feedback on our conversation that I,

480
00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.620
that I think would be really useful and interesting.

481
00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.800
And when you do things that are asynchronous as we're doing now,

482
00:29:05.801 --> 00:29:09.250
we're writing a book which is asynchronous.
You get that feedback much later.

483
00:29:09.251 --> 00:29:13.650
And so the feedback is less is less meaningful.
So if I,
um,

484
00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:18.580
uh,
if I write something and someone says,
you wrote this passage here,

485
00:29:18.581 --> 00:29:20.560
I just don't get it.
Um,

486
00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:24.160
that's sort of a bummer for me because I don't have time to cure it.

487
00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:28.510
But if I say something before an audience and I get a bunch of blank looks,

488
00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:31.810
I immediately know.
Wow,
okay.
I didn't explain that very well.

489
00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.150
I got to go back next time around and get explained it better.

490
00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:36.600
<v 2>So I've,</v>

491
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:41.360
so many different questions I want to dig into related to what you just said.
Uh,

492
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.610
first is

493
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:48.910
actually connected to something we were talking about just before we hit record.

494
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.860
And that was,
uh,

495
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:55.570
you having listened to the interview I did with Brian Compliment the screen

496
00:29:55.571 --> 00:29:59.290
writer,
a filmmaker,
a cocreator of the,

497
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:04.320
the hit show billions among many other things and his pension to end

498
00:30:05.351 --> 00:30:10.351
recommendation for forensically studying film,

499
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:14.080
watching films with a notebook in hand and taking notes on what worked,

500
00:30:14.081 --> 00:30:15.970
what didn't his responses and so on.
And you,

501
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.620
you mentioned a number of different questions and cues that you might ask

502
00:30:20.621 --> 00:30:25.090
yourself while watching in your speech writer days,
the audience,

503
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:28.780
while you're this sensibly,
your boss is giving a talk.

504
00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:33.430
Would you be writing those things down?
Uh,
would it be,

505
00:30:33.431 --> 00:30:37.840
would you be sitting there kind of with a,
uh,
a notebook in hand recording this,

506
00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:38.733
this type of thing?

507
00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:44.150
<v 4>Um,
what I would be,
uh,
what I would often be doing would be,</v>

508
00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:47.630
um,
I would have,
okay,
so if I had a,

509
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.360
it was a speech where it had a written where there was a written text,

510
00:30:50.361 --> 00:30:54.710
which is not always the case in some cases for for lower key,

511
00:30:54.711 --> 00:30:57.920
for less significant things.
It would be say,
you know,

512
00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:00.950
conversation and some talking points and some things like that,
you know,

513
00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.580
but let's say for a speech that was actually delivered,

514
00:31:03.581 --> 00:31:08.060
that is a speech that was written out and then delivered,
um,

515
00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:09.920
you know,
behind a podium.

516
00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:14.540
I would almost always have the actual physical text of the speech and I would

517
00:31:14.541 --> 00:31:18.650
mark up that physical text of it.
So,
so,

518
00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:19.850
and in some cases,

519
00:31:19.851 --> 00:31:23.960
because it was helpful for me in terms of just relating to my own boss,

520
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:28.400
let's say that he skipped a paragraph.
I like,
hmm,

521
00:31:28.401 --> 00:31:29.840
I wonder why I skipped that paragraph.
You know,

522
00:31:29.841 --> 00:31:32.600
maybe ask him about that or maybe I could even figure out why you skipped that.

523
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:33.260
You know,
he skipped,

524
00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:37.190
he didn't even bother reading a paragraph where we skipped a line or he ad

525
00:31:37.191 --> 00:31:39.500
libbed a do a new version of the line.

526
00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:42.860
That was actually very helpful to me in terms of just dealing with my boss.

527
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:44.910
Because again,
what you're trying to do,

528
00:31:44.911 --> 00:31:48.510
and it's in writing a speech for somebody else,
is that you're,

529
00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:52.250
you're trying to make that person sound like the best version of him or herself.

530
00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:56.510
And so it could be that the way I phrased something didn't sound like him,

531
00:31:56.750 --> 00:32:00.050
but he knew what I meant.
And he was able to phrase it in his own words.

532
00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:03.860
And that actually was helpful for me in terms of doing the,
the,
the,
the,

533
00:32:03.861 --> 00:32:07.180
the tactical craft of my job.
Um,
but so I would have,

534
00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:10.070
I would have the text with me,
let's say there was a joke,
you know,

535
00:32:10.071 --> 00:32:13.300
I would say I'm at a,
basically it would like,
plus I'm serious,

536
00:32:13.301 --> 00:32:17.630
like plus and minus,
you know,
um,
and say,
hey,
that joke worked.

537
00:32:17.631 --> 00:32:21.630
That joke didn't work,
that line of work,
that,
that line,
that line didn't work.
Um,

538
00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:27.040
and one of the things that it taught me was also is that you don't go based on,

539
00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.200
uh,
I'm,
I'm getting in the weeds here a little bit,

540
00:32:30.201 --> 00:32:34.580
but you don't make permanent decisions based on one reaction.

541
00:32:34.581 --> 00:32:36.620
And I do that myself now in my own stuff.

542
00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:38.930
So if I say something and it doesn't work the first,

543
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.360
<v 3>I don't say I don't abandon it,</v>

544
00:32:41.361 --> 00:32:44.930
then I make a note of that and then I try it again because sometimes different

545
00:32:44.931 --> 00:32:49.790
audiences,
different contexts,
different things,
it can work.
But,
um,
so,

546
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.090
but,
but I,
yeah,
I would do that.
It was just sort of,
you know,
here's the thing.

547
00:32:53.091 --> 00:32:55.430
I don't want to make this sound like,
like,

548
00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:58.430
or use the word forensic that talk about what compliment is doing.

549
00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.090
Mine was less forensic,
it was more um,
hygienic.

550
00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:07.360
It was to me it's like that's just like good staff hygiene,
you know?
I,

551
00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:11.150
you know what I mean?
I wrote a speech and this dude is delivering it.

552
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:15.680
I should pay attention to like how it's going,
you know?
And if I do that,

553
00:33:15.681 --> 00:33:19.090
if I do that,
I'm going to do better next time and he's going to do better.
Exxon,

554
00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:25.210
<v 2>if I look at the my own writing,
the writing that I've done that has,</v>

555
00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:29.260
has received the best response it,
we'll just keep it broad.

556
00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:31.150
Nine Times out of 10,

557
00:33:31.151 --> 00:33:36.151
it's something that I have tested and honed in some speaking format,

558
00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:41.020
whether it's a presentation or a class or something else,

559
00:33:41.021 --> 00:33:42.750
which is part of the reason why if,

560
00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:46.120
if I'm giving a talk or doing an interview in front of a live audience,

561
00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:49.900
I always ask them to raise the house lights because for whatever reason,

562
00:33:49.901 --> 00:33:51.940
a lot of venues like,
sure,
really dumb it down,

563
00:33:51.941 --> 00:33:53.410
but then you can't see the response.

564
00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:56.980
So I always had a way to raise the house lights.

565
00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:02.250
When you are testing out a speech or an article or a chapter on someone else,

566
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.390
uh,
what types of questions,

567
00:34:07.391 --> 00:34:10.330
what are you looking for or what types of questions do you ask?

568
00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.720
You can pick any of those that you'd like,
but,

569
00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.850
but what type of question guys do you ask?

570
00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.600
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Let me take your simple question.
A complicated,
let's go.</v>

571
00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:25.640
Because I actually think that that speeches and written words are different

572
00:34:25.641 --> 00:34:29.120
things.
Okay.
Um,
and so,
uh,

573
00:34:29.121 --> 00:34:33.200
so the way that I would convey an idea in a speech is going to be different from

574
00:34:33.201 --> 00:34:37.850
the way that I would convey the similar same idea in a book.

575
00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:42.920
Um,
and so,
um,
so,
so,
so,

576
00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:47.440
so for me,
um,
like one of the most important,

577
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:50.870
like I,
I'd say it's a,
it's a simple question,
but,
uh,
and I,

578
00:34:50.871 --> 00:34:54.500
I find myself asking it all the time to people is this following question.

579
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:59.090
Does that make sense?
Does that make sense?
Um,

580
00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:04.330
or what I've sometimes found a easier way to rephrase that is this is actually,

581
00:35:04.401 --> 00:35:07.780
I think it's actually useful,
uh,
uh Ha,
uh,
writing I guess.

582
00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:13.010
What about that doesn't make sense.
Yeah.
I think that people,

583
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:16.500
I think that people are more likely to say,
does that make sense there?
You know,

584
00:35:16.501 --> 00:35:19.910
it's sort of out of politeness and also just out of self.
Oh,
of course.

585
00:35:19.911 --> 00:35:22.310
That makes sense.
Oh yeah.
You know,
but sort of what about that?

586
00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.470
So I converted a little bit.
What about that?

587
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.900
What about that doesn't make sense with when you give us,
when you,
when you,

588
00:35:27.901 --> 00:35:31.880
when you explain an idea to somebody or you're talking to an audience,

589
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:35.900
I really think,
I mean,
maybe I'm overestimating my own abilities,

590
00:35:35.901 --> 00:35:38.280
but I really think you can tell by the look on people's

591
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:41.850
<v 4>faces.
Um,
there are all other kinds of markers of that too.</v>

592
00:35:41.851 --> 00:35:45.210
So for instance,
um,
um,
you know,

593
00:35:45.211 --> 00:35:49.170
especially now if you have slides,
what are people taking pictures of?
All right,

594
00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:53.480
what slides are they taking pictures of?
What things are they writing down?
Um,

595
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:57.600
so I look at those kinds of cues in,
in,
in,
in,
in,
in talks.

596
00:35:57.601 --> 00:36:00.990
I think writing is more difficult.
And I'll tell you what I do in,
in writing,

597
00:36:00.991 --> 00:36:05.450
especially books.
And this is a little bit insane.
Uh,
or it's,
it's,

598
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:08.340
I mean,
it's insane in the sense that you were,
it requires,

599
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:13.700
it requires someone who is deeply devoted to you in a way that someone you truly

600
00:36:15.331 --> 00:36:20.070
love is devoted to you.
So here's the,
here's the thing about my books.
Um,

601
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.470
I,
even though I'm,

602
00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:28.920
even though I just said speeches and written words are different for me,

603
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:31.320
I actually improved my writing by listening to it.

604
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:35.310
Not because I listened to written words different from the way I listened to

605
00:36:35.311 --> 00:36:40.020
speeches,
if that makes any sense.
And so when I write books,

606
00:36:40.021 --> 00:36:44.820
so the latest book,
I mean,
you know,
latest book and all the previous books,
um,
I,

607
00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.630
I have an office here behind my house in Washington DC.

608
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.090
It's a garage refurbish garage and four,

609
00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:55.230
I will sit in my office and I'll give it,
let's talk about the latest book.
Okay.

610
00:36:55.231 --> 00:36:58.490
Just to give you an idea.
So this is a book,
I don't know,
it's like 280 pages,

611
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.000
something like that.
Um,

612
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:05.630
I read every word of that book out loud to my wife at various stages.

613
00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:11.370
What's,
what's more,
I read drafts,

614
00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:16.620
multiple drafts of chapters out loud to my wife in this office.

615
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.960
But wait,
there's more.
My,

616
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:24.770
my wife read every word of this book out loud to me,

617
00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:31.200
including drafts because for me,
that's how I,

618
00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.440
that's how I processed the,

619
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.560
that's how I processed the written word.
So for me,

620
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.160
I can tell what works in a speech because you have a large audience of people

621
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:46.430
behind,
you know,
reacting to it went in terms of written words like I,

622
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:49.350
I don't know,
it's just like I,
you know,

623
00:37:49.351 --> 00:37:53.700
after all these years I know what's good and what's not when it comes to the

624
00:37:53.701 --> 00:37:57.060
written word.
And I actually know what's not good really is what I know.

625
00:37:57.330 --> 00:38:01.230
And so I tried to remove all the not good stuff.
Um,

626
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:02.550
and uh,

627
00:38:02.551 --> 00:38:07.551
and the way I do that and is a very laborious way is to read aloud because that

628
00:38:09.331 --> 00:38:11.670
helps me look at the words a different way,

629
00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.710
but also to have them read aloud to me.

630
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:18.360
Now what's amazing to this and shows you just how incredible and awesome my wife

631
00:38:18.361 --> 00:38:18.571
is,

632
00:38:18.571 --> 00:38:23.370
is that I am the worst person on the planet to be read aloud too,

633
00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:26.430
because I'm a complete pain in the ass when it comes to,

634
00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:29.910
especially if you're reading my,
my words.
Oh,
come on.

635
00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.980
You got to read with more expression than that.
Oh,
come on.
No,

636
00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:37.000
the emphasis is on that word.
No.
MMM.
My safely might.

637
00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:40.640
Saintly wife has done this for several,
several,
several books now.

638
00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:44.620
<v 2>Wow.
She's a keeper.
Uh,
I,</v>

639
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:46.120
I've only,

640
00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:51.840
I suspect this is more common than either of us might expect,

641
00:38:53.071 --> 00:38:57.870
but,
uh,
John McPhee,
the nonfiction writer also writes,

642
00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:00.960
I think he still writes for the New Yorker.
Fascinating guy.

643
00:39:00.961 --> 00:39:05.961
But I took a seminar with him in Undergrad and he also explained how he reads

644
00:39:07.741 --> 00:39:10.920
all of his word.
I believe he reads not only his feature works,

645
00:39:10.921 --> 00:39:15.540
but his articles out loud to his wife.
Really?
I actually did not know that.

646
00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:17.930
Yup.
Yup.
So this is,
yeah.

647
00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:21.140
<v 4>Well,
I'm pretty good.
I'm in,
I'm in,
I'm in,
I'm in pretty good company.</v>

648
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:26.870
I started reading,
I started reading John Mcphee when I was like a,

649
00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:29.540
like a pretty,
you know,

650
00:39:29.541 --> 00:39:34.541
like a young teenager and one of the best McPhee books I've read was a book you

651
00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:37.270
might've read it called levels of the,

652
00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:42.630
<v 2>it's so good.
I get so,
so good.
Maybe you can just love that book.</v>

653
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:43.330
I read it

654
00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:46.750
<v 4>again.
I actually read it again,
uh,
about two years ago,
but I read it,</v>

655
00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:50.500
I read it as a kid.
Um,
you know I got it out of the library.

656
00:39:50.501 --> 00:39:55.030
I spent a lot of time in libraries when I was a kid and I don't know how some

657
00:39:55.031 --> 00:39:57.160
librarian or somebody told me about it cause there was a,

658
00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:00.070
because he has that famous book about Bill Bradley,
a sense of where you are.

659
00:40:00.071 --> 00:40:02.950
So I read that because I was a basketball fan and it's like,
oh,

660
00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:05.680
I was also a tennis fan.
It's like,
oh you read about tennis too.

661
00:40:05.681 --> 00:40:10.240
And I read that book and I,
you know,
it's time.
I guess I was,
I was saying,

662
00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:14.110
wow,
you can actually write about sports in a way that's kind of more interesting

663
00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:18.490
than just sports.
Um,
that's a remarkable book.
I mean,
I can explain it quick.

664
00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:18.911
So it's a,

665
00:40:18.911 --> 00:40:23.911
it's a story about a match between a single tennis match between Arthur Ashe,

666
00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:28.330
uh,
who would then was very young just out of Richmond and a guy named Clark

667
00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:31.570
Grabner,
who was from a,
a wealthier white guy,

668
00:40:31.571 --> 00:40:35.140
wealthier family in I think it was like suburban Cleveland.

669
00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:38.260
And what he does is he basically describes the match,

670
00:40:38.261 --> 00:40:41.260
but throughout he pulls back and tells each of their stories of how they

671
00:40:41.261 --> 00:40:45.550
actually got to the court that day.
I think it was the u s open a US Open match.

672
00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:49.630
And so he actually describes them playing a point and then he pulls back and

673
00:40:49.631 --> 00:40:53.950
talks about how Arthur ash got there and he pulls back and talks about how Clark

674
00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:57.550
Grabner got there.
And he does it with such elegance in such concision.

675
00:40:57.551 --> 00:40:59.890
It's just the,
that's,
uh,
it's a joy to behold.

676
00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:04.440
<v 2>It's,
it's truly spectacular.
And for those who haven't read Mixi,
you should,</v>

677
00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:09.540
if not for any other reason that he can take any subject matter you can imagine,

678
00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:14.550
uh,
and make a riveting book about said subject.

679
00:41:14.551 --> 00:41:19.410
It could be oranges,
Plymouth Rock,
uh,
origins book look as great.

680
00:41:19.411 --> 00:41:23.310
I read that one.
I was a kid to carve,
carve canoes,

681
00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:24.960
geology.
It just,

682
00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:29.940
you name the topic and he can turn it into a page Turner.
But levels,

683
00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:34.030
levels of the game is,
is just spectacular.
And one,

684
00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:38.040
one thing that mixed fee is very,
very good at is,

685
00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:42.210
and I think this is also shared territory with you,
is asking questions.

686
00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.260
It given the nature of his writing,
uh,

687
00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:50.040
a very significant portion of his time is spent interviewing.

688
00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:55.370
And what about that doesn't make sense is a really powerful tweak on the maybe

689
00:41:58.831 --> 00:42:01.950
alternative that you mentioned,
which is does this make sense?
Right.

690
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:06.180
What does this make sense or not?
And I,
I this,

691
00:42:06.181 --> 00:42:08.190
this may be digging too far into the weeds,

692
00:42:08.191 --> 00:42:13.191
but I was really fascinated to read about an approach that you've detailed in

693
00:42:13.831 --> 00:42:16.660
one of your books called motivational interviewing.
And I,

694
00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:20.650
and I hadn't heard of this before,
uh,
but the,

695
00:42:20.651 --> 00:42:24.480
the example that stuck out to me,
and you don't have to give this exact example,

696
00:42:24.481 --> 00:42:25.850
but was,
uh,

697
00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:31.620
asking a student who is seemingly struggling with Algebra,
uh,

698
00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:37.080
uh,
a a certain question and instead of others,
uh,
I don't want to butcher it,

699
00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:38.520
but I can certainly also,

700
00:42:38.521 --> 00:42:40.920
I have it in front of me so I can pull it up if need be.

701
00:42:40.921 --> 00:42:44.280
But can you explain for people what motivational interviewing is and maybe give

702
00:42:44.281 --> 00:42:45.114
an example?

703
00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:50.790
<v 4>Yeah.
So this is actually a,
it's a,
it's a therapeutic technique,</v>

704
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:53.640
uh,
that actually I think has wider applications.

705
00:42:53.641 --> 00:42:55.250
And I heard about it from a fellow named Mike Pent.

706
00:42:55.251 --> 00:43:00.210
Alondra is that at the Yale School of medicine who used it in,
in,

707
00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.840
uh,
I think,
uh,
addiction addiction treatment.
And it's basically like this.

708
00:43:03.841 --> 00:43:08.700
So let's say that,
um,
um,
let's say that you have,

709
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:09.090
uh,

710
00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:12.510
let me think of a good example here of something that somebody typically isn't

711
00:43:12.511 --> 00:43:17.020
that keen to do.
Um,
uh,

712
00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:20.310
lucky.
Let's let,
let,
let's,
let's,
let's,
let's,
let's go to Algebra.

713
00:43:20.311 --> 00:43:22.320
Let's say you have somebody,
let's say you're your parenting,

714
00:43:22.321 --> 00:43:27.170
you have a kid who's in eighth grade and I'm a is,
uh,

715
00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:30.380
has an Algebra test and doesn't want to study for the Algebra test is an intuit,

716
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:35.160
doesn't want to do it.
And so,
you know,
typical reaction from parents,

717
00:43:35.161 --> 00:43:38.580
from anybody in authority figures like what the Hell is wrong?
You know,
you know,

718
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:40.860
start thing.
Just sort of demanding,

719
00:43:40.861 --> 00:43:45.180
start demanding compliance and motivational interviewing is almost the reverse

720
00:43:45.181 --> 00:43:49.620
of that.
So it basically,
so let's say you have a kid named Bob,
you could say,

721
00:43:49.621 --> 00:43:52.500
you know,
um,
uh,
hey Bob,

722
00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:57.750
I see you're not studying for your Algebra test.
Um,
let me ask you a question.

723
00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.180
You know,
I see you have an Algebra test tomorrow on this.

724
00:44:00.181 --> 00:44:04.110
On a scale of one to 10,
how ready are you to study for your Algebra test?

725
00:44:04.111 --> 00:44:06.510
How ready you are to start studying for your Algebra test?
All right,

726
00:44:06.511 --> 00:44:08.370
how much do you want to start setting for your Algebra test?

727
00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:13.180
And Bob is totally unmotivated by Bob.
Might say,
I'm a three,
uh,

728
00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:17.580
three out of 10.
Now again,
our reaction,
his bosses as parents,

729
00:44:17.581 --> 00:44:20.010
as people in figures of authority is basically is to say,

730
00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:22.830
what do you mean you're a three?
You should be not,
you know,

731
00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:26.970
but instead you're more chill than that.
And you say,
okay,
you're a three,
uh,

732
00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:32.220
why did you pick a lower number?
And that that always wakes people out.

733
00:44:32.221 --> 00:44:35.610
So he says,
I'm a three out of 10 in terms of my desire to do this thing.

734
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:38.610
And you say,
instead of saying,
Yo,
oh my God,
you should be a nine.

735
00:44:38.611 --> 00:44:43.080
What are you crazy?
You Lazy Ass.
You say,
Oh,
why didn't you pick a lower number?

736
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:47.910
And what's interesting about that is that is what it does to Bob is that Bob has

737
00:44:47.911 --> 00:44:52.410
to now say why he's not a too.
And so he begins saying things like,

738
00:44:52.411 --> 00:44:55.510
well,
you know,
if I don't study for this test,
I'm,

739
00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.500
I'm probably going to bomb the next test.
If I don't master this material,

740
00:44:58.501 --> 00:45:02.280
it's going to be harder to go into later on.
If I don't do well on this test.

741
00:45:02.281 --> 00:45:04.560
You might have so may.
And so what happens is,

742
00:45:04.561 --> 00:45:08.340
is that Bob begins articulating his own autonomous,

743
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:10.440
intrinsically motivated reasons for doing something.

744
00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:13.820
And that's the key and what we know from a mountain of,

745
00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:17.100
of social science research is that when people have their own reasons for doing

746
00:45:17.101 --> 00:45:20.210
something,
they're more likely to endorse the behavior,

747
00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:21.750
the more likely to carry it out.

748
00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:25.690
And so this becomes a way to serve as Bob's own motivation for it,
um,

749
00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:29.310
through questions rather than through rather than through dictates.

750
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:33.120
And it can be a very,
very powerful technique.
You can also turn it inward.
Um,

751
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:36.030
you know,
you say,
well,
how,
how,
how,
how ready are you,
Dan,

752
00:45:36.031 --> 00:45:39.810
to finish this chapter of God?
You know,
I'm like a three.
Then you say,
well,
Dan,

753
00:45:39.811 --> 00:45:42.810
why aren't,
why aren't,
why aren't you a to uh,
you know,

754
00:45:42.811 --> 00:45:46.020
and so anything you can do to help people surface their own reasons for doing

755
00:45:46.021 --> 00:45:48.780
something makes them more likely to commit to the behavior,

756
00:45:48.781 --> 00:45:50.280
more likely to follow through on their behavior

757
00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:55.350
<v 2>that lasts.
Extension is really important.
I,</v>

758
00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:59.710
I had been prepping this and reading the background,
some of it,

759
00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:04.740
and it didn't even occur to me that you could apply it to yourself and use it

760
00:46:06.041 --> 00:46:11.041
for journaling or something like that to uncover or maybe a rediscover the

761
00:46:11.171 --> 00:46:13.810
motivation that drove you to start it in the first place,

762
00:46:13.811 --> 00:46:16.480
even though you lost sight of it or a petered out or whatever the hell it might

763
00:46:16.481 --> 00:46:16.890
be.

764
00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:19.710
<v 4>Yeah.
I mean,
you could use it for going to you.
You use it,</v>

765
00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:23.640
you could use it for you.
You could use it for going to the,
um,
you know,

766
00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:27.420
going to the gym or going to,
going to work out.
Like how,
like,
how ready are you,

767
00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:28.291
how,
you know,

768
00:46:28.291 --> 00:46:32.260
how excited are you about how motivated are you to work out right now?
I'm a two.

769
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:37.110
All right.
Well,
I said to myself,
well,
why aren't you a one?
Well,
you know,

770
00:46:37.111 --> 00:46:38.970
I know that probably I'll feel better if I work out,

771
00:46:38.971 --> 00:46:43.260
write on it if I don't work out.
I know that actually,
um,
um,

772
00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:48.240
if I don't do this aerobic exercise today,
I probably gonna,
you know,

773
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:49.470
might not have a chance to do it tomorrow,

774
00:46:49.471 --> 00:46:52.230
which means I'm going to feel like crap.
Um,
and so you can,

775
00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:56.100
you can turn it on yourself as well.
It's all about those surfacing,
you know,

776
00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:57.870
you know,

777
00:46:57.871 --> 00:47:01.290
one of the things that we've done and turned in management and parenting and all

778
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:06.120
in all other realms of life is that we have over,
we've overdosed on control.

779
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:12.230
And control is not an effective way to motivate people for important things.

780
00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:17.520
Um,
because human beings only have two responses to control.

781
00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:19.830
They comply or they defy.

782
00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:23.970
And that's a history of humankind is basically human beings either complying or

783
00:47:23.971 --> 00:47:27.320
defined with control.
Uh,
and so we get,

784
00:47:27.321 --> 00:47:30.100
we need to abandoned control as motivator and look

785
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:34.900
<v 3>for ways for people to summon their own autonomous motivation for doing things.</v>

786
00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:42.100
<v 2>So we talked at the very top of this interview about Johnny Bunko and how uh,</v>

787
00:47:42.711 --> 00:47:46.250
you were ahead of the voters in a sense.
It didn't quite catch,

788
00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:50.510
you might've been a bit early with the Monga format.
In contrast,

789
00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:55.780
a whole new mind seems to really have resonated strongly and it did catch.

790
00:47:56.570 --> 00:48:00.200
So I'd love to try to deconstruct why that was the case.

791
00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:02.180
And as one example,

792
00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:05.690
it's appealed so much to overwinter that she gifted,

793
00:48:05.691 --> 00:48:10.400
I want to say 4,500 copies to the Stanford graduating class of 2008 when she did

794
00:48:10.401 --> 00:48:13.010
her commencement speech there.
Why do you think that is?

795
00:48:13.011 --> 00:48:15.710
And the subtitle I should just mention,
so holding mind,
subtitle,

796
00:48:15.711 --> 00:48:19.460
why right brainers will rule the future.
Why did this one take?

797
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:25.580
<v 3>Yeah,
I mean it's,
it's,
it's hard to say.
I think the reason that it took,
uh,</v>

798
00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:30.290
is that it was,
um,
fairly original idea,
uh,

799
00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:35.030
uh,
conveyed in a way that was easy to understand and also had the advantage of

800
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:39.440
probably being more right than wrong.
Um,
so,
uh,

801
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:43.220
so the idea in that book is the following that I,
that I was arguing then,

802
00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:47.690
I still believe it today that the structure of our brain offers a metaphor for

803
00:48:47.691 --> 00:48:52.130
describing the future of work.
And,
um,
you know,

804
00:48:52.131 --> 00:48:54.860
all your listeners know there's been a lot of stuff written about left brain and

805
00:48:54.861 --> 00:48:59.330
right brain over the years.
Most of it's just total garbage.
But one of the,

806
00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:01.640
um,
one of,
uh,

807
00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:05.990
what we know about our brains is that they're actually somewhat efficient and

808
00:49:05.991 --> 00:49:06.860
then over time they've,

809
00:49:06.861 --> 00:49:10.400
they divided up tasks to the left hemisphere specializes in one set of tasks,

810
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:13.490
tasks that are logical,
linear,
sequential,
analytical.

811
00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:16.250
The right hemisphere specializes in a different set of tasks,

812
00:49:16.251 --> 00:49:21.170
tasks that are about understanding context,
about synthesis,
um,

813
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:25.640
and about,
um,
simultaneous processing.
And so,
um,

814
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:28.160
that division of Labor,
uh,

815
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:32.420
in the brain I think offers a very powerful metaphor for understanding what,

816
00:49:32.421 --> 00:49:32.810
what's,
what,

817
00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:35.690
what I thought was going on in the world of work and it continues to go on to

818
00:49:35.691 --> 00:49:36.524
the world of work.

819
00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:40.100
But actually to make sure I got the underlying lung science right in a tearing a

820
00:49:40.101 --> 00:49:41.510
page from the Tim Ferriss playbook,

821
00:49:41.511 --> 00:49:45.410
I actually went to the national institutes of Health to get my own brain
scanned,

822
00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:46.850
see my own brain and action,

823
00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:50.060
which ended up being profoundly disappointing experience.

824
00:49:50.061 --> 00:49:53.960
But that's another story for another day.
Um,
and so,
um,

825
00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:55.730
basically the idea here is this,

826
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:58.970
that the abilities that used to be the most valuable than the economy

827
00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:03.710
characteristic.
It's a metaphor characteristic of the left hemisphere,
logical,

828
00:50:03.711 --> 00:50:06.950
linear,
sequential,
analytical spreadsheet,
SAP abilities.

829
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:08.630
Those abilities are still necessary,

830
00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:11.180
but there are no longer sufficient and its abilities,

831
00:50:11.181 --> 00:50:14.750
more characteristic of the right hemisphere of the brain artistry,
empathy,

832
00:50:14.751 --> 00:50:16.490
inventiveness,
big picture thinking.

833
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:18.590
Those abilities are now the first among equals.

834
00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:23.620
And the reason for that is that is a very hardheaded reason that those kinds of

835
00:50:24.321 --> 00:50:29.190
abilities are easy to outsource,
easy to automate.
And the,

836
00:50:29.191 --> 00:50:31.280
the,
the,
the,
the left hand left them.
It's variability.
Sorry.

837
00:50:31.281 --> 00:50:32.420
The left time is for abilities.

838
00:50:32.421 --> 00:50:36.380
The sat spreadsheet abilities are easy to outsource,
easy to automate,

839
00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:41.010
and less valuable in iterating something new,
uh,

840
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:45.260
in dealing with the demands for new that comes from an abundant world.

841
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:48.910
And so,
um,
and so I actually,

842
00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:52.100
maybe another reason that took is that I basically came to a soft hard and

843
00:50:52.101 --> 00:50:53.660
conclusion in a hardheaded way.

844
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:57.500
There was a very clear economic argument for that.
You know,
the three A's,

845
00:50:57.501 --> 00:50:59.000
Asia automation,
abundance,

846
00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:02.420
we ducted left brain work can be done cheaper overseas.

847
00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:04.370
The other AI automation,

848
00:51:04.371 --> 00:51:07.880
it can be done faster by computers and now smart machines.

849
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:11.690
And then finally abundance that our material needs have been satisfied and

850
00:51:11.691 --> 00:51:13.100
oversight of that.

851
00:51:13.101 --> 00:51:17.060
There's a premium now in coming up with something utterly new and giving the

852
00:51:17.061 --> 00:51:19.430
world something it didn't know it was missing a,

853
00:51:19.431 --> 00:51:23.180
which is a very much of an artistic ability.
And so,
um,

854
00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:27.950
that's the argument in that book and it's an argument I think that people

855
00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:31.790
resonated too cause they were seeing inklings in their own life and they needed

856
00:51:31.791 --> 00:51:35.150
a way to describe it,
categorize it,
put words on it.

857
00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:39.230
<v 2>Well,
it seems like history is proven.</v>

858
00:51:39.231 --> 00:51:44.231
Your prediction or description very accurate at this point for sure.

859
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:49.100
And it also would,
uh,
also occurs to me that this is,

860
00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:53.690
this is another place,
uh,
Monga aside where you and Kevin Kelly,

861
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:57.860
the founding editor of wired magazine,
very much on the same page.
Uh,

862
00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:01.760
you mentioned something in passing though that I can't let go because I have to

863
00:52:01.761 --> 00:52:04.910
hear the separate story.
Why was your brain scan disappointing?

864
00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:09.250
<v 3>Oh,
because,
um,
it,
you know,
I looked at my brain,</v>

865
00:52:09.251 --> 00:52:11.410
I was thinking my brain would be special.
Some kind of,

866
00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.400
it looked like every other brand.

867
00:52:12.401 --> 00:52:16.950
I'd say like I couldn't pick my own brain out of a lineup.
Um,
so that,

868
00:52:16.951 --> 00:52:20.050
that's what it was.
I mean,
it's sort of,
I shouldn't say disappointing.
It's,

869
00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:24.130
it's humbling,
you know,
like the idea that here's the,
here's my,

870
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:28.660
I got this brain in my head.
All right.
And,
uh,
leaving aside the,

871
00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:30.970
leaving aside the,

872
00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:36.280
the thorny issue of where does the brain end in the mind begin or vice versa?
Um,

873
00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:40.990
my brain is,
uh,
is,
is largely responsible for who I am.

874
00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.820
And yet when I see a picture of it,

875
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:48.100
it's completely unremarkable and looks like every other brain that's being

876
00:52:48.101 --> 00:52:51.550
scanned that day.
There's something kind of weird and humbling about that.

877
00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:53.550
Disappointing too.
I don't know.

878
00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:55.450
I was expecting my brain would be cooler or something

879
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:56.343
<v 2>mean like</v>

880
00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:01.430
looking back at all of your books,

881
00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:06.820
what do you find any commonalities or patterns?

882
00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:12.440
And I mean,
we can also forage all sorts of spurious correlations.

883
00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:17.800
But looking at the books that seem to have struck a nerve and those that for

884
00:53:19.221 --> 00:53:22.430
whatever reason,
didn't perform up to your hopes.

885
00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:26.160
<v 3>Yeah.
Um,
I,
you know,
I don't know.</v>

886
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.910
<v 4>I mean,
I think that,
I think that when it comes to actual performance of things,</v>

887
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:33.990
um,
you know,
like how well the book does,
that's something that's not fully,

888
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:38.160
I mean,
you know,
this,
I mean,
that's not something that's fully in our control.

889
00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:40.920
And,
and I'm,
and I'm actually,

890
00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:44.490
I'm actually more or less okay on that.
I mean,
it's,

891
00:53:44.491 --> 00:53:48.540
it's disappointing when someone doesn't do as well as you want.
But to me,

892
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:53.520
my criteria,
my criteria is did I write the best book I possibly can.

893
00:53:53.521 --> 00:53:56.580
Right.
And then once you put it out there,
there's so many other variables.

894
00:53:56.581 --> 00:53:59.550
You just don't know whether it's going to take or whether it's not going to,

895
00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:03.510
whether it's not going to take.
Um,
so I mean,
I wrote a book,
you know,

896
00:54:03.511 --> 00:54:06.390
my first very first book was a book called free agent nation.
Uh,

897
00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:10.440
that was not a monumental,
that did.
Okay.
But it was not a monumental hit.

898
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:14.820
It should have been because I think I was right.
Um,
um,

899
00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:16.020
but for whatever reason,

900
00:54:16.021 --> 00:54:19.530
I think it came out like I think I think just came out at the raw,

901
00:54:19.531 --> 00:54:23.280
I think it came out at the wrong time.
It should've come out slightly earlier.
Um,

902
00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:27.810
and so,
so on that,
so,
so to me that the,
you know,
um,

903
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:31.200
how well a book done that's,
there's so much randomness in that.
I'm not,

904
00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:35.110
I try not to lose any sleep over it.
Um,
in terms of actual,
you know,

905
00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:38.140
is there a through line among all the books?
I,

906
00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:42.900
that's an interesting question and I can say from the creation point of view,

907
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:44.670
there's absolutely not a through line.

908
00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:48.840
There was no intentional through line throughout,
through these kinds of,

909
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:49.800
through these kinds of books.

910
00:54:49.801 --> 00:54:54.060
It's not as if I have mapped out somewhere on a whiteboard here in pink ink

911
00:54:54.061 --> 00:54:59.061
world headquarters and Washington see this like grand scheme to create the pink

912
00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:02.970
oof in a certain fashion,

913
00:55:02.971 --> 00:55:07.110
in a certain timetable with certain things covered like that far from it.

914
00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:09.450
I just go from one thing to another.

915
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:13.350
I just like figuring out what I'm going to do next.
And as you know,
Tim,

916
00:55:13.351 --> 00:55:15.600
I mean writing a book is so difficult.
It's so hard.

917
00:55:15.601 --> 00:55:18.630
It's so time consuming that if you're not in love with the idea,

918
00:55:18.631 --> 00:55:20.220
if you don't love working on it,
you're going to,

919
00:55:20.221 --> 00:55:22.030
it's going to be miserable for you.
So,

920
00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:25.830
so I just pick the next topic based on what I'm really interested in and what of

921
00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:30.030
what I want to spend a couple of years,
you know,
a few years working on.
Um,

922
00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:35.210
so I think it's possible that people can detect a through line that readers

923
00:55:35.431 --> 00:55:38.400
could detect the through line.
Maybe they're seeing something that I'm not,

924
00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:41.040
but if there's a through line,
it's visible only retrospectively.

925
00:55:41.041 --> 00:55:42.570
It's not something that was intentional.

926
00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:47.910
What was speaking of difficulty and writing process,

927
00:55:48.330 --> 00:55:51.840
what if there is a,
if you had to pick one,

928
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:54.750
what has been the most difficult book for you to write and why?

929
00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:57.360
I think it was this,
I think it was the last one,

930
00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:59.370
the last of the last book that I wrote.
Believe it or not,

931
00:55:59.371 --> 00:56:02.400
you would think it would get easier over time,
but it didn't.
Um,

932
00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:05.070
so this last book,
when about the science of Tommy,

933
00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:08.870
that was the most difficult book to write.
Um,
partly because I went to,

934
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.100
I went into that book,
um,
with,
so I went to,

935
00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:15.130
I started writing a whole new mind,
having done the research.

936
00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:16.350
They've done some research and saying,
Hey,

937
00:56:16.351 --> 00:56:19.980
I think there's something going on here.
Like I think we're moving to this world,

938
00:56:19.981 --> 00:56:23.160
you know,
and sort of,
I had a theory of the case with drive.

939
00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:27.940
I had a book about motivation.
I looked at a lot of the research in motivation.

940
00:56:27.941 --> 00:56:32.500
I said,
Whoa,
wait a second.
People are missing like a huge story here with when,

941
00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:37.510
um,
I went in totally with questions rather than with any kind of theory of the

942
00:56:37.511 --> 00:56:40.000
case.
I basically said,
hey,

943
00:56:40.001 --> 00:56:42.400
I'm making all kinds of timing decisions in my own life.

944
00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:46.810
I'm making them in a totally half ass way.
I like to make them in a better way.

945
00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.670
Could somebody please give me some guidance?

946
00:56:48.671 --> 00:56:51.250
And I started looking around for guidance and it didn't exist.

947
00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:54.340
And then I started looking at the research and I realized that across all of

948
00:56:54.341 --> 00:56:58.510
these domains of research,
literally dozens and dozens you from,

949
00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:03.310
from the hard sciences and molecular biology to endocrinology to the social

950
00:57:03.311 --> 00:57:07.720
sciences of economics and social psychology,
uh,
too many,
many domains.

951
00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:10.660
These scholars are asking very,
very similar questions.

952
00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:13.540
What's the effect of time of day on what we do and how we do it?

953
00:57:13.541 --> 00:57:14.710
How do beginnings affect us,

954
00:57:14.711 --> 00:57:18.400
how to mid points affect the side of endings affect us.
And so I went in saying,

955
00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:21.610
wow,
how do I make better timing decisions myself?

956
00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:23.200
But it didn't have a theory of the case.

957
00:57:23.201 --> 00:57:27.040
And so the volume of research for this one was so monumental.

958
00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:30.550
There are so many studies out there and there were so many different in so many

959
00:57:30.551 --> 00:57:34.630
different fields and fields like molecular biology is not a subject that is at

960
00:57:34.631 --> 00:57:37.570
my fingertips.
All right?
I had a,
I spent so much time,

961
00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:39.460
I mean it basically would read those papers.

962
00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:43.360
I would read them through and I would write down all the words that he didn't

963
00:57:43.361 --> 00:57:44.194
know the meaning of.

964
00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:48.040
And then I would look up those words and then I would read it again and I would

965
00:57:48.041 --> 00:57:50.960
read it a third time.
And so very painstaking.
Um,

966
00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:53.530
and then also because they didn't have a theory of the case,

967
00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:58.210
I just had questions rather than even kind of skeleton or a shape of what I

968
00:57:58.211 --> 00:58:02.950
wanted to write.
Um,
I had to figure that out.
So I probably did,
I don't know,

969
00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:08.050
17,
18 different outlines,
um,
of,
of that,
of that book.

970
00:58:08.051 --> 00:58:11.950
So that was that what,
you know,
you would think it would get easier,

971
00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:16.930
but it actually got hard.
It would actually got harder.
Teen outlines.

972
00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:18.970
What to what,
to what,

973
00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:22.900
what would such an outline look like?
How long is it,

974
00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:27.640
what's the format?
And when I say an outline,
it's relative,
relatively short,

975
00:58:27.641 --> 00:58:30.130
just like one or two pages.
Nothing,
nothing too comprehensive.

976
00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:34.420
I guess outline is outline is,
is,
um,
outline is,
well,

977
00:58:34.421 --> 00:58:36.430
it's partly the right word because I'm a,

978
00:58:36.450 --> 00:58:39.640
I'm a firm believer when it comes to speeches and when it comes to books,

979
00:58:39.641 --> 00:58:43.030
I'm a firm believer in structure and shape.
Um,

980
00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:45.670
I think that those are what makes some things work.

981
00:58:45.850 --> 00:58:49.240
I think it's stupid television shows.
I think it's true for podcasts.
Um,

982
00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:50.460
I think that structure,

983
00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:57.740
that structure and shape are very important.

984
00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:02.230
All right.
Um,
no.
So here's the thing,
Tim.
I think your podcast,

985
00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:04.930
they don't necessarily have a structure,
but they have a shape.

986
00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:08.440
There's no question they have a shape.
All right?
And so it's a,
you know,

987
00:59:08.441 --> 00:59:10.990
it's just,
it's a difference between,
you know,
we can have,

988
00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:12.310
you can have sculptures,

989
00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:15.970
beautiful sculptures that have right angles and you can have other beautiful

990
00:59:15.971 --> 00:59:19.450
sculptures like a Henry Moore sculpture that has no right angles at all,

991
00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:24.260
but it has a distinct and and identifiable shape.
Right?
So,
so,

992
00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:29.000
um,
but I'm a big believer in,
in,
in structure and shape.
And,

993
00:59:29.370 --> 00:59:31.070
um,
so what I'm doing there is that,

994
00:59:31.071 --> 00:59:35.510
that's basically just my search for how do you organize the ideas and what's the

995
00:59:35.511 --> 00:59:39.260
shape or the structure of the final product going to be.

996
00:59:39.261 --> 00:59:42.860
Because once I see the shape,
I've,
I can do a lot better work.

997
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:44.540
But for this other book,
you know,
it's like,

998
00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:48.620
like I'm reading through 700 studies on all this kinds of stuff,
and I'm like,

999
00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:51.050
good God,
how do I even make sense of this?

1000
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:54.080
What do I put where I started thinking about organizing it?

1001
00:59:54.081 --> 00:59:55.550
Do I organize this book about timing?

1002
00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:59.510
Do I organize it basically the way that we organize time?
So do I write about,

1003
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:04.490
you know,
the hour,
the day,
the week,
the week,
the month,

1004
01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:09.440
the year,
the lifetime,
and that's a really bad way to do it.

1005
01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:13.670
But I ended up why?
Why is that bad?

1006
01:00:13.671 --> 01:00:17.960
How did you decide that was a bad approach?
Because,
um,
um,

1007
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:20.270
for a couple of reasons.
Number one,

1008
01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:25.700
the material didn't organize itself cleanly in that way.
Now on number two,
uh,

1009
01:00:25.701 --> 01:00:29.930
that's,
that struck me more as a,
uh,
like a handbook,

1010
01:00:29.931 --> 01:00:32.540
like a farmer's Almanac rather than a,

1011
01:00:32.541 --> 01:00:36.560
an intelligent book of science journalism with takeaways.
Um,

1012
01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:41.150
and more important.
That's not a book I would want to read.
And you know,

1013
01:00:41.151 --> 01:00:44.060
and so,
so I,
so I abandoned that,
but I did it.

1014
01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:48.080
But did I really abandon it because I actually ended up writing a whole chapter

1015
01:00:48.081 --> 01:00:52.450
in this book about the day.
So I ended up cleaving off some of that and,

1016
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:57.680
and keeping it for anything,
keeping it for,
for other things.
And so,
um,

1017
01:00:57.740 --> 01:01:01.580
so it took me a long time too.
It took me a long time to find the shape.

1018
01:01:01.581 --> 01:01:05.540
And the way I find the shape is I basically write it down on either what I call

1019
01:01:05.541 --> 01:01:10.190
big ass stickies is giant post it notes or,
um,
or,

1020
01:01:10.191 --> 01:01:13.220
or on a whiteboard that I have in my office.
But I went through many,
many,

1021
01:01:13.221 --> 01:01:17.690
many iterations and on that I have a somewhat social view of,
of that.

1022
01:01:17.691 --> 01:01:21.920
And that what I'll do is I'll,
I'll run it past people to see what they think,
um,

1023
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:24.080
and say,
hey,
what do you think?
If I organize the book that way,

1024
01:01:24.081 --> 01:01:28.010
does that make any sense?
Or,
um,
or what about that doesn't make sense?

1025
01:01:28.011 --> 01:01:30.790
Or what am I missing here?
What's the weak spot there?
Uh,

1026
01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:32.810
but it took me a long time too.

1027
01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:37.250
It took me a long time to find the shape of a of this book.

1028
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:41.360
That coupled with the fact that the,
the amount of research was so massive.

1029
01:01:41.361 --> 01:01:43.580
It was,
it was actually,
it was actually,

1030
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:47.390
it was actually the hardest book I've had to write while you're doing the

1031
01:01:47.391 --> 01:01:51.080
research as you're writing the book,
right.
In effect,
it sounds like,

1032
01:01:51.081 --> 01:01:52.670
because you're coming into it with questions,

1033
01:01:52.671 --> 01:01:57.671
but then you're having to digest all of the information that might lead or might

1034
01:01:58.551 --> 01:02:03.260
not lead to answers while you're writing it.
Yeah,
exactly.
Exactly.
Very,
very hard.

1035
01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:06.440
So,
and that's hard to the,
right.
Exactly.
You're so right about that.

1036
01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.260
That's hard to do two and a lot of people,
I mean,
you know,
as a writer it's,
it's,

1037
01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:12.110
it's,
it's,
it's messier than that.

1038
01:02:12.111 --> 01:02:16.130
There's this notion that I'm going to do my research and then when my research

1039
01:02:16.131 --> 01:02:18.980
is done,
I'm going to do my writing.
All right.

1040
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:21.630
And so it never works that way.

1041
01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:26.310
But when you have more questions than you have when you don't know the shape yet

1042
01:02:26.311 --> 01:02:27.840
and you have still have a lot of questions,

1043
01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:30.270
what happens is I'm going to do the research.

1044
01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:33.780
Now I'm going to try to write down something about it.
Crap.
You know what?

1045
01:02:33.781 --> 01:02:34.501
Now that I ride it,

1046
01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:37.590
I realize I'm missing a whole thing here and I've got to do more research.

1047
01:02:37.591 --> 01:02:42.120
So let me go back and do that.
So it's less of this kind of,
you know,
um,
you know,

1048
01:02:42.121 --> 01:02:44.760
happy March from,
you know,
uh,

1049
01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:48.090
happy jumped from here is I'm going to go from this lily pad to that lily pad

1050
01:02:48.091 --> 01:02:51.630
and happily jumped from each one to another like a lighted frog.

1051
01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:53.860
<v 2>There's a lot of task switching.</v>

1052
01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:57.520
That's exactly why the four hour chef for me,

1053
01:02:57.521 --> 01:03:01.690
it was also by far the most difficult book among other reasons to write is that

1054
01:03:01.691 --> 01:03:06.691
I came into it intending to try all of these experiments,

1055
01:03:07.031 --> 01:03:12.031
ask all these questions and write the book somewhat chronologically as I'm

1056
01:03:12.491 --> 01:03:16.090
getting answers.
And,
uh,

1057
01:03:16.091 --> 01:03:19.180
that was a very punishing way to approach things.

1058
01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:23.800
But t two to look at the content.
So going past the structure and looking at the,

1059
01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:28.280
the content,
the findings of when,
uh,

1060
01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:33.920
I was looking at an NPR interview that you did and teasing out some potential

1061
01:03:35.621 --> 01:03:39.430
ways that I could apply the content from this book into my own life.

1062
01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:42.190
And I'm going to read a quote.
You can feel free to correct it,
but this is,

1063
01:03:42.191 --> 01:03:45.760
this is what I have is as one very clear example and I'd love to basically I'm

1064
01:03:45.761 --> 01:03:49.210
going to ask you what types of decisions have changed for you or easy ways that

1065
01:03:49.211 --> 01:03:53.650
people can think about making changes related to timing.

1066
01:03:53.890 --> 01:03:57.250
So here's one then I'm going to,
I'm going to truncate it a little bit,

1067
01:03:57.251 --> 01:03:59.020
but quote in a lot of this research and big data,

1068
01:03:59.021 --> 01:04:01.690
you see systematically poor performance in health care settings.

1069
01:04:01.691 --> 01:04:03.640
In the afternoon example,

1070
01:04:03.641 --> 01:04:06.700
the incidence of handwashing inside of hospitals dramatically drops in the

1071
01:04:06.701 --> 01:04:10.660
afternoon.
And that seems like a bad thing to me.
My voice,
not yours.

1072
01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:14.260
You look at colonoscopies endoscopists find half as many polyps and

1073
01:04:14.261 --> 01:04:17.230
colonoscopies in afternoon exams versus morning exams.

1074
01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:18.760
Even with the same population,

1075
01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:21.820
doctors are more likely to prescribe unnecessary antibiotics.

1076
01:04:21.821 --> 01:04:23.800
And the afternoon compared to the morning.

1077
01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:28.150
And this seems this is very,
very actionable,
right?

1078
01:04:28.151 --> 01:04:32.230
If we are to trust the data,
if the patterns,
if the correlations hold,

1079
01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:36.790
then you are certainly better off.
It would seem,
uh,

1080
01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:39.550
if you're,
if you want to Miss [inaudible],
uh,

1081
01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.980
I'm not sure that was English risk mitigate.

1082
01:04:41.981 --> 01:04:45.220
I think I swapped the first two letters that has a fancy psychological term.

1083
01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.290
<v 4>It's called a,
it's called an linguists.
They got a tip of this lung.</v>

1084
01:04:51.610 --> 01:04:56.380
<v 2>Exactly.
Uh,
and you,
you might come back to your undergrad and linguistics,
but,</v>

1085
01:04:57.070 --> 01:04:58.570
uh,
what,
what are,

1086
01:04:58.571 --> 01:05:02.470
what are other examples related to the,

1087
01:05:02.471 --> 01:05:05.740
when the timing that people can,
might be able to implement?

1088
01:05:06.310 --> 01:05:07.900
<v 4>Oh my gosh,
there's so much stuff.
I mean,</v>

1089
01:05:07.930 --> 01:05:12.640
the good news about that is that when I did finally a wrestle the research to

1090
01:05:12.641 --> 01:05:15.760
the ground and figure out how to structure it,
um,

1091
01:05:16.270 --> 01:05:21.100
it yielded many great,
great takeaways for readers.
So,
so,
so take,

1092
01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:21.761
take a step back.

1093
01:05:21.761 --> 01:05:24.760
What we know from a mountain of research took me a while to figure this out,

1094
01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:27.930
was um,
that we tend to move through the day in three stages,

1095
01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:31.900
a peak to trough a recovery peak trough of recovery.
Um,

1096
01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:35.980
now most of us move through the day in that order.
Um,
people who are night owls,

1097
01:05:35.981 --> 01:05:37.450
people who haven't even in chronotype,

1098
01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:40.240
they move through the day in the reverse order recovery trough peak.

1099
01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:43.590
But what we know is that,
um,
we,

1100
01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:46.990
we know a few things about human performance over the course of a day.

1101
01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:49.270
The most important thing,
and this is a,
this,

1102
01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:54.190
I wish somebody had told me this before I was 50 rather than once I was 50.

1103
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:55.000
All right.

1104
01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.770
Is that our cognitive abilities do not remain the same throughout the day.

1105
01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:03.460
Our cognitive abilities change during the day and they can change in some

1106
01:06:03.461 --> 01:06:07.060
dramatic ways and they can change it per day.
They change in predictable ways.

1107
01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:10.620
But how we performed depends on what we're doing.
All right?

1108
01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.790
So what we know about the peak,

1109
01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:16.570
which again for most of us is the morning for night owls.
It's later in the day.

1110
01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:19.990
What we know about the peak is that the peak is when we are most vigilant.

1111
01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:21.760
And what does vigilance made?

1112
01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:24.910
Vigilance means we're able to bat away distractions.
Um,

1113
01:06:24.970 --> 01:06:28.180
and so when we're vigilant and combat away distractions,

1114
01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:33.210
that makes it the best time for analytic work work that requires heads down,

1115
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:38.140
focus,
writing a report,
analyzing data,
that kind of work.
Um,

1116
01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.480
there's no piles of research.

1117
01:06:40.481 --> 01:06:45.250
Tell us that we should be doing our analytic work during the peak,
the trough,

1118
01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:48.880
that's the early afternoon and early to mid afternoon.

1119
01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.730
As you mentioned from the data on on healthcare,

1120
01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:54.670
a lot of bad stuff happened then.
I mean,

1121
01:06:54.671 --> 01:06:58.450
you have a standardized test scores for students go down in the afternoon.

1122
01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:03.490
You have,
um,
if you look at auto accidents,
once you control for cars on the road,

1123
01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:06.130
uh,
obviously is to be more accidents when the more cars on the road.

1124
01:07:06.131 --> 01:07:07.270
But once you control for that,

1125
01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:11.410
the most dangerous time to drive as four to 6:00 AM the second most dangerous

1126
01:07:11.411 --> 01:07:15.460
time is two to 4:00 PM.
During that midday trough.
Um,

1127
01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:18.880
we should be doing more of our,
uh,
administrative work.

1128
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:23.830
We should be answering our routine emails.
We should,
I mean you,
you,
you,
you,

1129
01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:25.960
you talk,
you've talked in the past him about batching.

1130
01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:30.970
We should be batching our routine emails and answering them during the trough.

1131
01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:33.070
We should be filling out our TPS report.

1132
01:07:33.071 --> 01:07:35.290
We should be filling out our expense report,
whatever,

1133
01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:39.130
that kind of stuff that we have to do during the course of a day that doesn't

1134
01:07:39.131 --> 01:07:43.090
require a lot of major cognitive power.
Now,

1135
01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:44.980
the recovery period,
again,

1136
01:07:44.981 --> 01:07:49.510
because this peak trough recovery is a pattern of mood that also is a pattern of

1137
01:07:49.511 --> 01:07:52.960
performance.
The recovery period is actually really,
really interesting.

1138
01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:56.200
During the recovery period,
we have elevated mood.

1139
01:07:56.201 --> 01:07:58.210
Our mood is better than during the trough,

1140
01:07:58.750 --> 01:08:01.180
but we're less vigilant then during the peak.

1141
01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:05.860
And so it's really important to think about that Combo platter here.

1142
01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:10.980
That is you have higher mood but less vigilance that makes it a good time for

1143
01:08:11.981 --> 01:08:16.250
things like brainstorming for first things like insight work where

1144
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:19.460
<v 3>if you're too locked down and focus,
you're not going to be that creative.</v>

1145
01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:24.650
And so that that degree of looseness coupled with the elevated mood makes that

1146
01:08:24.651 --> 01:08:29.600
recovery stage better for,
um,
uh,
what are called insight problems,

1147
01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:31.910
uh,
brainstorming things that require iteration.

1148
01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:35.420
And so what we see is that if you,

1149
01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:38.660
if we recognize that our cognitive abilities don't stay the same over the course

1150
01:08:38.661 --> 01:08:41.210
of a day,
that they change in predictable ways.

1151
01:08:41.211 --> 01:08:45.020
And then what we do that when we do something depends on what we're doing,

1152
01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:48.410
we should be moving our analytic work to the peak,

1153
01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:53.620
our administrative work to the trough and our insight and creative work to the

1154
01:08:54.951 --> 01:08:59.210
recovery.
And it's that simple.
And what the research tells us also is this,

1155
01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:04.240
I mean is that time of day explains about 20% of the variance in how people

1156
01:09:04.281 --> 01:09:08.840
perform on cognitive tasks.
So if you think about that,
that's a big deal.

1157
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:12.680
Like we can explain the very,
like if Fred,
you know,
if we have two people,

1158
01:09:12.681 --> 01:09:16.790
you know,
Maria and Sally and they perform differently on cognitive tasks,

1159
01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:19.460
how do we explain that?
All right.
We say,

1160
01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:23.160
how do we explain that variance in how people before you know,
Maria,
Sally,
and,

1161
01:09:23.170 --> 01:09:27.530
and you know,
18,000 other people perform on cognitive tasks.
We say,
Oh,

1162
01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:29.420
some people are smarter than other people.

1163
01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.790
Some people are more conscientious than other people.

1164
01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:34.460
Some people have more social advantage and other people.

1165
01:09:34.730 --> 01:09:38.960
But what the research is telling us,
a 20% of that variance is time of day.

1166
01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:43.460
Um,
and so and so.
So what we should be doing is,

1167
01:09:43.461 --> 01:09:47.780
and what we're not doing is we should be making our when decisions in a

1168
01:09:47.781 --> 01:09:52.730
strategic way rather than in the lazy hap hazard way with which we tend to make

1169
01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:55.880
our wind decisions.
And so,
and you see this most glaringly,

1170
01:09:55.881 --> 01:09:59.030
and this is my rant of the,
of the of the year,

1171
01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:04.380
is you see this most glaringly with meetings in organizations when we scheduled

1172
01:10:04.571 --> 01:10:09.380
meetings and organizations,
the only criteria we use is availability.

1173
01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:14.270
That's it.
Who's available.
We don't say what kind of meeting is this?

1174
01:10:14.271 --> 01:10:16.460
This is a meeting where people have to be analytical.

1175
01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:19.790
What kind of meeting is this?
Is this about travel voucher policies?

1176
01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:23.130
What kind of meeting is,
is,
are we brainstorming?
Who's going to be there?

1177
01:10:23.131 --> 01:10:24.260
Are they going to be morning people,

1178
01:10:24.261 --> 01:10:26.300
are they going to be intermediate people that can be evening people.

1179
01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.860
We don't even ask those questions.
We just say who's available and it's,

1180
01:10:30.861 --> 01:10:32.450
it's causing,
um,
it's,

1181
01:10:32.451 --> 01:10:35.960
it's one of the easiest things organizationally to fix and it's something that

1182
01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:37.610
at the unit of one,

1183
01:10:37.611 --> 01:10:41.690
individuals can be a lot more systematic and intentional about moving the right

1184
01:10:41.691 --> 01:10:43.040
work into the right time slots.

1185
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:47.690
<v 2>What,
what time of day do you generally wake up personally?</v>

1186
01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:51.410
<v 3>Um,
I,
I wake up a little after seven.</v>

1187
01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:57.020
<v 2>And what does,
what does the first two hours of your day look like?</v>

1188
01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:59.630
Do you,
do you have particular,
any particular routines?

1189
01:10:59.631 --> 01:11:00.930
Can you walk us through what that,

1190
01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:06.140
<v 3>yeah,
I don't,
I don't have the detailed routines that,
um,</v>

1191
01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:08.030
that you have that you have written about,

1192
01:11:08.031 --> 01:11:12.200
that you actually have experimented with and,
uh,
you know,
things like,

1193
01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:14.010
like a journaling and meditation or

1194
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:17.940
<v 4>anything like that.
Um,
here's what I do.
I wake up,
all right.
I,</v>

1195
01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:22.740
I take a shower,
I shower,
helps me wake up.
So I take a shower,
um,

1196
01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:27.270
I go downstairs and I feel better if I see a member of my family.

1197
01:11:27.271 --> 01:11:30.240
So whoever happens to be awake,
I mean my,
I have two kids in college now,

1198
01:11:30.241 --> 01:11:33.000
so I don't see them,
but I have another kid who still are still around.

1199
01:11:33.001 --> 01:11:34.060
So I see him,
uh,

1200
01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:38.730
I see my wife and I like to have some protein for breakfast.

1201
01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:42.090
Uh,
if that's a ritual and caffeine,
protein and caffeine are my,

1202
01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:46.590
is my preferred breakfast.
What's your goto protein?
A,
you know what,

1203
01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:48.290
I,
I'm a,

1204
01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:54.180
I probably eat more hard boiled eggs and almost any other person in America.

1205
01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:59.250
I am keeping the hard boiled egg industry in business.

1206
01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:03.870
I think I'm single handedly responsible for the advent of hardboiled eggs for

1207
01:12:03.871 --> 01:12:06.000
sale and individually wrapped packages in airports.

1208
01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:09.960
I really think so because once they,
once they introduced that,

1209
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:11.880
I bought them all and they go,
oh my God,

1210
01:12:11.881 --> 01:12:16.020
there's such demand for these hard boiled eggs.
Um,
so,
um,

1211
01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:20.800
I was just as actually to by what I eat.
So many eggs is ridiculous.
So,
um,

1212
01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:26.490
um,
so I don't have a cholesterol problem fortunately.
Um,
so,

1213
01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:30.990
um,
so,
uh,
hardboiled eggs or um,
or pour peanut butter.

1214
01:12:31.050 --> 01:12:34.650
And then,
um,
what I do is when I'm in my writing day,

1215
01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:37.480
and this is actually something I did better having read this book,
when,

1216
01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:40.920
when I'm on writing days,
um,
I will go to my office,

1217
01:12:40.921 --> 01:12:45.310
which again is behind my house and I will not bring my phone with me.
Uh,

1218
01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:49.680
I will not turn on my email and I will give myself a quota.

1219
01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:53.550
And that quota is usually is a word count.

1220
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:56.310
So call it 700 words.
I'm a fairly slow writer.

1221
01:12:56.311 --> 01:13:00.060
So you've got these people out there.
I write 3000 words a day and it's like,

1222
01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:04.940
I don't think I've ever done that.
Um,
um,
and so very,

1223
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:09.630
very slow.
I'm proud of,
I may be slower than you are even.
Yeah.
Well,
here's the,

1224
01:13:09.631 --> 01:13:14.130
I'm slowing basically,
I'm basically slow and every,
um,

1225
01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:18.420
in every domain of my life I'm like just such a,
as I'm a slow runner,

1226
01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:22.050
I'm a slow reader.
I'm a slow writer.
I like,

1227
01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:27.080
I really heavily scrutinize my 23 and me report to see if I had some kind of

1228
01:13:27.211 --> 01:13:32.190
like tortoise gene in me somewhere that somehow like one of my ancestors in

1229
01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:37.350
Latvia,
some home made mated with a tortoise at some point.
Um,
and so,
um,

1230
01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.850
and so,
um,
and so,
so,

1231
01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:42.960
but what I will do though is I will come in and get myself that quota and I

1232
01:13:42.961 --> 01:13:47.870
won't do anything until I hit that number.
Um,
and then,

1233
01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:51.060
then I'm free to do other kinds of things.
Um,
and then what I'll do is I always,

1234
01:13:51.150 --> 01:13:55.200
you know,
I'll have lunch and then I will,
um,
I like to do,

1235
01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:58.320
I have done a good job,
especially after this,

1236
01:13:58.321 --> 01:14:03.180
this book changed the way that I organize my day because I do my analytic work

1237
01:14:03.181 --> 01:14:04.860
better in the morning.
So this book,

1238
01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:09.510
this book impelled me to clear out my mornings to do that analytic work,

1239
01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:14.110
which for me is writing.
I stuffed the administrative stuff often to the,

1240
01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.240
um,
uh,
to the,

1241
01:14:16.241 --> 01:14:20.500
to the mid day and then bashed emails and that kind of garbage.

1242
01:14:20.530 --> 01:14:24.310
And then I like to do interviews.
Um,

1243
01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:27.400
especially when I'm interviewing,
like for booking interviews,

1244
01:14:27.401 --> 01:14:31.930
I like to do those later in the day because I'm a little bit more,

1245
01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:34.930
um,
I liked,
I liked the interviews to be a little bit more freewheeling.

1246
01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:39.820
I'm not doing,
I'm not an investigative reporter,
I'm not conducting a deposition.

1247
01:14:40.090 --> 01:14:43.420
I just,
you know,
want to hear people's stories and what they think about stuff.

1248
01:14:43.421 --> 01:14:44.254
And so

1249
01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:49.470
<v 5>Gail law and policy review volume and number two,
that's nine days.
No,
no,</v>

1250
01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:52.100
<v 4>no.
And so I'm not,
I'm not,
you know,</v>

1251
01:14:52.101 --> 01:14:54.440
so I want that to be a little bit more iterative.
And then I,

1252
01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:56.480
and then I actually ended up exercising later.

1253
01:14:56.481 --> 01:14:59.000
I ended up lecture realizing later in the day and in the early evening because I

1254
01:14:59.001 --> 01:15:00.410
find that that works best for me.

1255
01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:05.330
<v 5>You said on a writing day when you were on book downline,
how many,</v>

1256
01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:09.540
what does your week weekly structure tend to look like?
Do you do,

1257
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:13.190
is everyday a writing day
writing a book?

1258
01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:17.280
<v 4>Yeah,
cause I'm a,
I'm a,
I'm also,
I'm also a momentum player,
so,</v>

1259
01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:22.440
um,
so for me,
writing every day is hugely important.
Um,
when I'm,

1260
01:15:22.441 --> 01:15:24.700
when I'm working on a,
when I'm working on a,

1261
01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:28.020
when I'm working on a book or working on a blog article.
So I tried to do that.

1262
01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:31.260
I tried to do that every single day,
like,
like seven days a week.

1263
01:15:32.210 --> 01:15:36.560
<v 5>And do you have,
do you have set periods of time between books?</v>

1264
01:15:36.650 --> 01:15:37.850
Do you decide in advance?

1265
01:15:37.851 --> 01:15:42.590
I'm going to take x period of time until I investigate another book?

1266
01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:45.770
What is,
what is your match macro planning look like?

1267
01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:50.240
<v 4>Macro planning.
Boy,
my macro planning is neither macro Norco</v>

1268
01:15:50.330 --> 01:15:53.210
<v 5>land.
Um,</v>

1269
01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:58.320
I think that needs to be on a motivational calendar somewhere.

1270
01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:05.170
Like,
um,
I don't know.
It's uh,
uh,

1271
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:07.800
how to put it,
put it another way.
It's that question sucks,

1272
01:16:07.801 --> 01:16:11.100
which it might cause it's also making a bunch of assumptions.

1273
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.780
How do you decide when to take on new projects or new books,

1274
01:16:16.290 --> 01:16:17.490
if that's a better question.

1275
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:21.040
<v 4>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
So I,
I sort of go into,
I sort of go in cycles.</v>

1276
01:16:21.041 --> 01:16:22.550
So I'm actually heading to that cycle right now.

1277
01:16:22.551 --> 01:16:26.060
So I spent a lot of time writing this book and try to make it as good as good a

1278
01:16:26.061 --> 01:16:29.120
book as I can in terms of actually spreading the word about it.

1279
01:16:29.150 --> 01:16:31.700
I tried to do that with,
you know,
give the Cliche,

1280
01:16:31.701 --> 01:16:34.400
not leaving anything on the sidelines and doing everything I possibly can,

1281
01:16:34.401 --> 01:16:37.790
being everywhere,
being strategic about it,
all,
trying new stuff,

1282
01:16:37.791 --> 01:16:41.840
try and cool stuff.
Uh,
trying to get some momentum behind that behind the book.

1283
01:16:41.841 --> 01:16:46.340
And then,
you know,
when that,
and when that sort of white hot center dissipates,

1284
01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:51.350
um,
um,
and the book we hope has some momentum of its own,

1285
01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.750
uh,
then I'll go back and figure out the next project,

1286
01:16:53.751 --> 01:16:56.420
whatever that project might be.
And the way I do that is,

1287
01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:01.080
I know this will shock you,
Tim,
and they slow,
laborious way.
Uh,

1288
01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:06.650
um,
but what I do is,
is I,
um,

1289
01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:12.020
I have a,
I'm a sort of,
I use,
I'll give you my mechanisms here.

1290
01:17:12.021 --> 01:17:16.550
So I use the blue or not.
I use a lot of paper folders and I have a labeler.
Um,

1291
01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:20.820
I use paper folders and a labeler to label my folders.
Uh,
cause I,

1292
01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:24.840
I was like a getting things done guy before getting things done.
It was cool.
Um,

1293
01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:27.530
the,
uh,
I met,

1294
01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:32.330
I met David Island like in 1997.
Um,
and

1295
01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:37.160
<v 5>you know,
I bought a labeler like shortly after that I was going to ask if he's,</v>

1296
01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:41.570
if he's sending you your customer,
you know,
5% royalties for your,
uh,
the,

1297
01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:44.990
the brainpower,
you're like the guy who invented rollerblades or the Gal,

1298
01:17:44.991 --> 01:17:46.850
you know,
40 years before they became cool.

1299
01:17:47.710 --> 01:17:52.390
<v 4>Yeah,
no,
no.
I,
I'm a,
I'm a,
I'm a,
I'm a GTB Devo Tay.
I'm not,</v>

1300
01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:57.150
I'm not hardcore.
I'm not like,
you know,
Orthodox,
but I'm not,
I'm not performing,

1301
01:17:57.190 --> 01:18:02.110
I'm not reform either.
I'm sort of like in the middle.
And so,
um,
so,
uh,

1302
01:18:02.111 --> 01:18:04.210
so anyway,
I have these paper files with labels.

1303
01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:07.810
And so when I read stuff or make notes to myself,
I throw stuff in those,

1304
01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:11.890
those files.
I use Evernote and I,
you also use Dropbox.
Um,

1305
01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:15.280
and I just throw ideas in there.
And then what I do is every six months or so,

1306
01:18:15.281 --> 01:18:17.860
I go through those ideas,
uh,
of like,
hey,

1307
01:18:17.861 --> 01:18:19.930
this would be a cool shot television show to do.
Hey,

1308
01:18:19.931 --> 01:18:22.420
this would be a cool article or write,
hey,
this would be a cool book to write.

1309
01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:26.740
And as I look at those ideas,
maybe revisiting them every six months or so,

1310
01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.820
I realized that most of them are just God awful ideas.
Um,

1311
01:18:30.910 --> 01:18:35.910
one of my beliefs about the human brain is that where creativity is that in

1312
01:18:36.011 --> 01:18:38.860
order to have good ideas,
you have to have a lot of ideas.
Um,

1313
01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:40.720
and so I have a lot of bad ideas,

1314
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:44.320
which I think is the only way for me to surface any decent ideas.

1315
01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:48.850
So I'll revisit those ideas and then when it comes,
um,
and I'll,
I'll,
I'll,

1316
01:18:48.851 --> 01:18:49.684
I'll call.

1317
01:18:49.810 --> 01:18:54.160
And what often happens when I call is that a few ideas end up just staying there

1318
01:18:54.161 --> 01:18:56.290
over and over again,
every six months cycle.

1319
01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:58.900
And then when I get to this point now,

1320
01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:03.640
I will go back to all of those files and look more carefully and say,
Hey,

1321
01:19:03.641 --> 01:19:07.480
I sort of have in my mind's eye right now,
three possible projects.
And,

1322
01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:11.470
and so I'll then I'll more heavily vet those projects,

1323
01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:16.030
read a lot more,
talk to people,
bounce them,
bounce ideas off of people.

1324
01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:20.890
And,
um,
and I like bouncing ideas off of people about which more in a moment.
And,

1325
01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:23.200
um,
and then when it comes time to write a book,

1326
01:19:23.630 --> 01:19:27.350
I will actually write a book proposal.
Um,

1327
01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:30.880
even if I have the deal already done.
So like I have a two book deal,
I have to,

1328
01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:32.910
I have to write another book.
Um,

1329
01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:37.040
but I'll still write a proposal for this next book,
maybe 40 page proposal,
uh,

1330
01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:39.160
which allows me to figure out is there,
there,

1331
01:19:39.161 --> 01:19:43.720
there is this something I really want to work on?
Um,
you know,
uh,
I think,

1332
01:19:44.290 --> 01:19:47.290
I think a lot of things sound really good when you're just shooting the breeze.

1333
01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:51.970
Um,
it,
they sound less good if you have to say,
can I,
can I explain this?

1334
01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:56.650
I can explain this idea,
who's going to buy it,
why it's cool,
why its original,

1335
01:19:56.651 --> 01:19:58.250
why no one else is doing it.
Uh,

1336
01:19:58.390 --> 01:20:02.470
can I explain that in a coherent written document that's a tougher order.

1337
01:20:02.471 --> 01:20:04.510
And so not everything lends itself to that.

1338
01:20:04.511 --> 01:20:07.060
And I will bounce ideas off of people.
So I had,
so actually it's funny,

1339
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:09.070
mentioned Kevin at the beginning of the show.
Um,

1340
01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:13.320
I had just one idea where I went out and I went to,

1341
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:17.430
I made the pilgrimage to a,
what is it?
What did you call his town?

1342
01:20:17.431 --> 01:20:20.490
Pacifica Civica um,
yeah and um,

1343
01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.580
made the pilgrimage to Kevin's house and said,
I got an idea.

1344
01:20:23.581 --> 01:20:26.160
I want to run past you a for a book.

1345
01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:30.510
And Kevin was one of the people who said that's not a very good idea.

1346
01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:40.460
Fortunately he was not the only one who said that.
And um,

1347
01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:42.440
<v 2>or fortunately,
depending on how you look at it,</v>

1348
01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:45.910
<v 4>actually,
unfortunately you're right.
Fortunately he was,</v>

1349
01:20:45.911 --> 01:20:48.720
he was not the only one who said that.
So I abandoned,
I ended,

1350
01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:53.110
actually ended up abandoning that idea in part because he was another brick in

1351
01:20:53.111 --> 01:20:55.210
the wall of people saying,
no,
no,
no.

1352
01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:58.850
<v 2>Let's pause there for a quick second.
Do you mind sharing?</v>

1353
01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:03.880
I don't think Kevin would care at all what c or other people made his arguments

1354
01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:09.170
against you pursuing this idea and you can tell us what the idea was,

1355
01:21:09.171 --> 01:21:11.090
where you can,
yeah.
Were blurred.

1356
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:15.970
<v 4>I'm going to be,
I'm going to be skittish about the idea.
Um,
uh,</v>

1357
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:18.360
but let's say it had to do with morality.
All right.

1358
01:21:18.361 --> 01:21:22.170
I wanted to write a book dealing with morality.
Um,
and,
and,

1359
01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:26.630
and Kevin who is a person of religious faith who,
you know,

1360
01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:31.170
is extraordinarily well read and among people who are very well read and very

1361
01:21:31.171 --> 01:21:32.490
intelligent,
there are,

1362
01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:36.600
I think there were a dearth of people who have strong religious space,
um,

1363
01:21:36.690 --> 01:21:41.440
that just an observation.
It's not like a
judgment one way or the other.

1364
01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:45.300
And so I thought he would be just an especially good person to run this idea

1365
01:21:45.301 --> 01:21:49.470
past.
And,
um,
and,
um,

1366
01:21:49.770 --> 01:21:52.530
I guess he and others,
um,

1367
01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:55.680
the theory of [inaudible] theory of the case that I had,

1368
01:21:55.681 --> 01:21:59.790
he and others had to and stuff and they are not insignificant criticisms.

1369
01:21:59.791 --> 01:22:01.710
Tin The first criticism was,

1370
01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:07.660
<v 2>you're wrong,
all right to begin with.
Yes,</v>

1371
01:22:07.710 --> 01:22:08.543
you're wrong.

1372
01:22:08.710 --> 01:22:11.930
<v 4>All right.
And the second person,
the second criticism,
it was,</v>

1373
01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.870
you're right,
but it's not interesting.

1374
01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:20.090
So those are two pretty like,
that's,
those are like,

1375
01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:24.890
those are significant critiques.
Right?
Um,
so,
um,

1376
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:29.710
so,
so that's,
uh,
so that's how I,
that's,
that's,
that's generally it.

1377
01:22:29.711 --> 01:22:32.570
That's generally how I do things.
When I came up with this idea for when,
uh,

1378
01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:35.110
it was an idea that was kicking around there and one of the,

1379
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:38.840
one of the ways that I knew it was a good idea,
uh,
we're,
we're,
we're two things.

1380
01:22:38.841 --> 01:22:43.260
Number one is that,
um,
uh,
when I was writing the proposal,
when I,

1381
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.881
first of all,

1382
01:22:43.881 --> 01:22:47.120
I was looking at the research and I found myself wanting to do more research,

1383
01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:50.690
which is always a good sign.
It's like,
holy crap.
Is that true?
Well,

1384
01:22:50.691 --> 01:22:54.610
what about poverty?
Bob and I go look at Bobby Ball.
Oh my God,
Bobby deposit.

1385
01:22:54.630 --> 01:22:58.670
You know?
And so I find myself wanting to do more research.
Uh,
that was one thing.

1386
01:22:58.671 --> 01:23:02.600
And then when I started writing the proposal for that,
it was like,
for me,

1387
01:23:02.601 --> 01:23:03.710
it doesn't happen very often,

1388
01:23:03.711 --> 01:23:06.460
but there were portions of it that were like butter.

1389
01:23:06.490 --> 01:23:09.880
I could just explain it so clearly,
like,

1390
01:23:10.090 --> 01:23:12.880
here's what I'm going to try to find out and here's why it matters.

1391
01:23:12.881 --> 01:23:16.330
And it was like,
it was like that,
you know,
that,
um,

1392
01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:21.500
that's seen in,
in Jerry Maguire where he sort of writes all night,

1393
01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:27.190
<v 5>I'm taking the goldfish minus the goldfish.
Huh.</v>

1394
01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:32.250
<v 4>Uh,
I was,
I was doing handstands against the wall and everything like that.
So,
uh,</v>

1395
01:23:32.530 --> 01:23:34.890
and,
and that's some,
that's sometimes that's sometimes a good,

1396
01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:35.940
that's sometimes a good sign.

1397
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:39.680
<v 5>I think it's that lack of,</v>

1398
01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:44.681
or overabundance of energy I think is undervalued.

1399
01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:49.790
How much the project actually gives you more photo tank.

1400
01:23:50.730 --> 01:23:53.650
<v 4>And I think that the big,
you know,
here's the thing,
I think a lot of writers,</v>

1401
01:23:53.651 --> 01:23:56.590
I think a lot of people who come out as journalism and before I started writing

1402
01:23:56.591 --> 01:24:00.790
books,
you know,
I post speech writing sort of,
sort of as a,
you know,

1403
01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:04.300
even the first time those writing books,
I did a lot of magazine articles,

1404
01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:06.910
Leatherneck magazine writing,
long form magazine writing,
which I,
which I,

1405
01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:11.200
which I like.
And I found a lot of journalists who would write an article,

1406
01:24:11.201 --> 01:24:14.230
the article would do well and they would get a book offer and they would do,

1407
01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:17.530
they would,
they would not pop but they would not properly vetted,
um,

1408
01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:18.670
about whether they want it.

1409
01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:21.880
Cause there were a lot of ideas that you maybe want to go out on a few dates

1410
01:24:21.881 --> 01:24:25.690
with.
But there are very few ideas that you want to go steady with,

1411
01:24:25.691 --> 01:24:27.400
let alone marry and have kids.

1412
01:24:27.401 --> 01:24:31.210
And I think that books are basically you're marrying and having kids.
Um,

1413
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:33.700
and that's a very,
very,
very high bar.

1414
01:24:34.170 --> 01:24:34.700
<v 5>There are lot,</v>

1415
01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:38.960
there are a lot of great articles that should stay articles and to make all my

1416
01:24:38.961 --> 01:24:42.520
very mediocre books.
And uh,
you know,
that'd be a potentially,

1417
01:24:42.521 --> 01:24:46.250
I suppose not vice versa.
It's very rare that you go in the opposite direction,

1418
01:24:46.251 --> 01:24:47.084
but

1419
01:24:47.570 --> 01:24:52.400
<v 4>oh,
that's,
I it's so,
I mean it's so off I read,
I read,
um,</v>

1420
01:24:52.490 --> 01:24:55.960
I I want to say the name of it.
I read one of those,
this sentence for me,
a blurb.

1421
01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:59.930
I read one of those,
um,
uh,
this weekend where somebody had an article,

1422
01:24:59.931 --> 01:25:01.820
it did really well.
They got a book deal,

1423
01:25:01.821 --> 01:25:04.640
they turned it into a book and it's like,
okay,
you know what,
this art,

1424
01:25:04.670 --> 01:25:08.930
this thing has so much more impact as an article rather than as a book.

1425
01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.433
Um,

1426
01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:15.540
<v 5>I want to dig in a little bit on this tickler file that you review every six</v>

1427
01:25:17.041 --> 01:25:17.680
months.
Yeah.

1428
01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:22.680
Because one of the most frequent questions I am asked is how do you pick

1429
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:24.840
projects?
How do you vet projects?

1430
01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:30.330
And you mentioned revisiting every six months with a few mundane questions

1431
01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:31.261
within Evernote.

1432
01:25:31.261 --> 01:25:34.650
Do you have a specific notebook that is tickler file or something like that?

1433
01:25:34.651 --> 01:25:36.420
How do you keep track of all of these ideas?

1434
01:25:37.010 --> 01:25:40.160
<v 4>Um,
I,
um,
I,</v>

1435
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:45.500
I can actually look that up right now.
I could,
I want to do is I categorize them.

1436
01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:50.120
Um,
so,
uh,
so I have,
so what I have,

1437
01:25:50.121 --> 01:25:54.910
and I have a giant file called misc.
All right.
I'm just like,

1438
01:25:54.970 --> 01:25:57.880
sure.
It's okay.
But then I'll go through that and say,
Whoa,
wait a second.

1439
01:25:57.890 --> 01:26:02.840
Let me think of an example here.
Um,
wait,
um,
wait a second.

1440
01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:07.790
I,
I'm,
wow.
I'm collecting a lot of articles about,
um,
here's the book.

1441
01:26:07.791 --> 01:26:08.690
I'm not going to like,

1442
01:26:08.691 --> 01:26:10.970
it could be interesting because at one point it's like someone should write a

1443
01:26:10.971 --> 01:26:13.580
book about courage.
All right?
Like what about courage?

1444
01:26:13.581 --> 01:26:15.470
What do we know about courage?
All right,
I'm not going to do that.

1445
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:17.840
If one of your listeners wants to go out and do it,
God bless you.

1446
01:26:17.841 --> 01:26:19.910
I think it could be really interesting.
Um,

1447
01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:23.870
so I could go into the missing file and say,
Ooh,
the Miss Notebook,

1448
01:26:23.871 --> 01:26:28.300
I guess it's called,
um,
is uh,
what do we know about courage?
Uh,

1449
01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:30.320
and well,
good in Miss Notebook.
And I said,
wow,

1450
01:26:30.410 --> 01:26:33.560
I got a lot of articles about courage,
what that's going to,
they're going to,

1451
01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:36.490
that's going to birth a,
a separate notebook on courage,
uh,

1452
01:26:36.491 --> 01:26:40.250
and then it organize it that way.
Um,
so I'll have a,

1453
01:26:40.251 --> 01:26:43.550
I'll have notebooks of misc and I'll have notebooks of,

1454
01:26:43.610 --> 01:26:47.720
of particular ideas that,
um,
that,
that I have,

1455
01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:51.710
um,
that end up being full or because it's like,
Whoa,
this,

1456
01:26:51.711 --> 01:26:53.960
this one has stuck around for a little bit longer than others.

1457
01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:58.480
<v 2>And Do,
you mentioned during these reviews you might say,
oh,</v>

1458
01:26:58.481 --> 01:27:00.820
here's a cool idea for this,
a cool idea for that.
Oh,

1459
01:27:00.821 --> 01:27:02.950
this could be really interesting.
That could be really interesting.

1460
01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:07.980
I would imagine even after the second glance and noticing that some of these

1461
01:27:09.671 --> 01:27:12.250
ideas or coyote ugly and you're like,
Holy Shit,

1462
01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:17.240
how did I think that was a good idea.
Even after removing,
uh,
the,
the,

1463
01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:22.310
the flies in the soup,
you still,
you still like that I used to live.

1464
01:27:22.450 --> 01:27:27.450
You still have way you could drown under the weight of these kind of cool ideas

1465
01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:33.760
that you have.
Many things that could be interesting.
How do you then,

1466
01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:37.360
what are the parameters or sought processies questions?

1467
01:27:37.361 --> 01:27:41.320
Anything that help you to get down to the three finalists?

1468
01:27:42.630 --> 01:27:47.250
<v 4>Um,
okay,
so,
so what do we,
so,
um,
it would be,</v>

1469
01:27:47.310 --> 01:27:51.870
um,
uh,
what,
uh,
it's,
it's really like,

1470
01:27:51.871 --> 01:27:54.240
what would I want to spend a couple of years on?

1471
01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:57.780
And so if I really sort of like,

1472
01:27:58.090 --> 01:27:59.970
like maybe courage would be an example of that.
It's like,

1473
01:27:59.971 --> 01:28:03.750
I'm sort of interested in that.
Um,
but it'd be like,

1474
01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:07.230
I would,
I would rather read a good book about courage,

1475
01:28:07.231 --> 01:28:12.080
then write a book about courage.
I'm serious.
Like,
you know what I mean?
10.

1476
01:28:12.081 --> 01:28:12.930
It's like,
and so when you,

1477
01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:15.210
when you go face to face with that and you start saying,

1478
01:28:15.211 --> 01:28:19.650
do I really want to do this?
Then I think your,
your soul at some level tells you,

1479
01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:22.890
hey,
this is that you're into this.
You're not,
you're not.

1480
01:28:22.891 --> 01:28:27.030
So you're not so into that.
Um,
and so that,

1481
01:28:27.031 --> 01:28:29.670
I think that's the,
I think that that's the initial cut.
Um,

1482
01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:32.520
but it's also the one reason why I,

1483
01:28:32.521 --> 01:28:36.360
so to get to the three finalist is actually really kind of intuitive in a,
in a,

1484
01:28:36.450 --> 01:28:39.810
in a way,
and it,
and there's no magic number to three.
It could be for,
you know,

1485
01:28:40.050 --> 01:28:43.410
um,
and um,
and,
and so,

1486
01:28:43.411 --> 01:28:48.000
but this is one reason why I will write a book proposals,

1487
01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:52.500
um,
because it just forces me to,

1488
01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:57.800
it forces me to reckon with the idea and actually like make it real.

1489
01:29:00.181 --> 01:29:03.930
And,
and there's this principle that I learned in college.

1490
01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:06.630
I had a writing course in college,
um,

1491
01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:09.810
and I actually ended up giving a commencement speech around this idea.

1492
01:29:09.811 --> 01:29:12.480
I'll spare you that for now.
But the idea was the idea was filing,

1493
01:29:12.481 --> 01:29:16.200
it was a revelation to me when I was,
whatever,
21 years old.
So I had this,

1494
01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:18.690
so it was his writing,
his essay writing course,

1495
01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:20.490
sort of higher level essay writing course.

1496
01:29:21.150 --> 01:29:22.690
And I had a draft of an essay or something like that.

1497
01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:24.690
I went into the professor's name is Charlie yarn off you still?

1498
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:29.130
I went to Northwestern.
He still teaches at Northwestern.
And um,
so Charlie,

1499
01:29:29.190 --> 01:29:33.180
um,
gave me some feedback and I said,
I was like all insistent,
okay,

1500
01:29:33.181 --> 01:29:35.580
I can fix this.
I can move this part over here.

1501
01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:39.120
Maybe I do another piece over here.
Maybe I knew another piece over here.

1502
01:29:39.121 --> 01:29:41.640
And he's like,
no,
no,
no,
no Dan,
that's not your problem here.

1503
01:29:41.850 --> 01:29:45.300
The problem is that you don't know what you think that that's what this essay

1504
01:29:45.301 --> 01:29:47.970
sucks.
This drafted the acid.
You don't know what you don't know what you think.

1505
01:29:47.971 --> 01:29:51.120
He didn't say stuck,
but that's why this essay,
that's why this essay,

1506
01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:54.150
that's why that says he stinks.
And then he said something to me and I,

1507
01:29:54.170 --> 01:29:54.990
and I don't want to,

1508
01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:59.700
I don't want it to sound glorified or sound like something that is confected

1509
01:29:59.701 --> 01:30:04.080
where a swell of music will come up behind me in this.
But what he said,
he said,

1510
01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:07.590
but it's words I've never forgotten.
Truly.
He said,

1511
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:10.380
sometimes you have to write to figure it out.

1512
01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:12.660
Sometimes you have to write to figure it out.

1513
01:30:13.050 --> 01:30:17.700
And that was a revelation to me because at the time I was in this mode,

1514
01:30:18.150 --> 01:30:21.990
very kind of traditional schooling mode where sort of like we were talking about

1515
01:30:21.991 --> 01:30:25.590
before you do your research,
then you're right,
you make your outline,

1516
01:30:25.770 --> 01:30:29.430
then you write.
And what he was saying to me is that,
you know,

1517
01:30:29.431 --> 01:30:31.980
the real writers are,
it's more dynamic than that.

1518
01:30:32.610 --> 01:30:36.360
Sometimes you have to write to figure it out.
And that was transformative for me.

1519
01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:40.800
And so,
um,
that sort of gave me permission to say,
Oh,
I don't know,

1520
01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:43.920
like I can change my mind and midway writing something,

1521
01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:47.370
I can start writing without knowing fully exactly what it is I'm going to say.

1522
01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:50.310
And to me that's the,
um,
that's,

1523
01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:53.330
that's why I write book proposals is that I write to figure it out.
And,

1524
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:58.350
and a lot of times what I figure out is this is not a book or this is not a book

1525
01:30:58.711 --> 01:30:59.544
I want to write.

1526
01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:03.750
So I had this one moment not met a few years ago where a while ago now,

1527
01:31:03.751 --> 01:31:07.590
actually 10 years ago,
even more where my,

1528
01:31:07.710 --> 01:31:12.060
my I sent,
it was like winter,
like late second half of December.

1529
01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:16.080
And I asked,
I said to my wife and I said,
hey,
why don't you just take our guys,

1530
01:31:16.110 --> 01:31:20.280
are kids,
three kids just go see your parents.
Just go for a week,
right?

1531
01:31:20.610 --> 01:31:23.550
A or two weeks or something like that,
you know,
go and like I just,

1532
01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:27.450
I got to get a book proposal done.
I just,
I'm distracted if like,
if you guys,

1533
01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:32.040
when you guys were my family leaves,
it's like I live like an animal,
you know?
Um,

1534
01:31:32.490 --> 01:31:37.050
I mean I eat,
I've got like a raccoon that got into the house.
No,
truly,

1535
01:31:37.051 --> 01:31:41.130
I mean it is raccoon like,
and that I literally eat out of containers,
you know,

1536
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:44.220
so like my,
my family leaves like eat out of containers,

1537
01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:48.360
don't shave and basically work around the clock.

1538
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:52.470
Except for a few ESPN breaks.
That's basically what I do when my family has gone.

1539
01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:57.200
And so I will,
um,
so I,
so I started,
so I said,

1540
01:31:57.230 --> 01:31:58.800
I'm going to write a proposal for this next book.

1541
01:31:58.830 --> 01:32:00.700
And after about seven or eight days,

1542
01:32:00.701 --> 01:32:02.920
I called Jessica at her parents' house and I said,
hey,

1543
01:32:02.921 --> 01:32:06.190
I got some good news and some bad news.
The good news is that you can come home.

1544
01:32:06.191 --> 01:32:10.510
Now the bad news is that I realize this is not a book,
um,
it,

1545
01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:13.450
but it was only writing to figure out that that allowed me to do that.

1546
01:32:13.451 --> 01:32:14.950
So I actually wrote a,

1547
01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:18.650
basically one and a half proposals before writing the wind proposal,
uh,

1548
01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:22.510
because I had a couple ideas and I said,
okay,
this is sort of interesting,

1549
01:32:22.630 --> 01:32:26.620
but let me write to figure it out.
And what I realized in,
in,
you know,

1550
01:32:26.621 --> 01:32:31.150
two very important things.
One,
it's not a book.
Maybe it's an article or two,

1551
01:32:31.151 --> 01:32:33.440
it's not a book that I want to write.
Um,

1552
01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:34.613
<v 2>there's,</v>

1553
01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:39.620
there he sings behavior aside that I want to follow up on.

1554
01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:45.570
Uh,
the first is just to highlight something for people listening.

1555
01:32:45.571 --> 01:32:50.571
And that is how liberating it is to think about writing as something you do,

1556
01:32:53.821 --> 01:32:56.070
not when you have your ideas ready,

1557
01:32:56.071 --> 01:32:59.640
but something you would do to figure out your ideas.
Absolutely.

1558
01:32:59.670 --> 01:33:04.350
Because it weighs you.
When did you learn that?
I,
it's been,

1559
01:33:04.770 --> 01:33:09.420
I would say reiterated,
it's something that is easy to forget,

1560
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:13.860
particularly if you have or something that you will willfully forget if you have

1561
01:33:13.861 --> 01:33:17.730
a perfectionist streak and a pension for procrastination.

1562
01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:21.120
So if you want to wait until all your ducks are in a row so you can go to the

1563
01:33:21.121 --> 01:33:26.040
debutante ball pristine and blow everybody's socks off,

1564
01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:31.140
uh,
it's easy to forget this,
but that sounds like,
uh,
you know,

1565
01:33:31.141 --> 01:33:33.420
the cat came back the very next day.
I don't think of the song,
but the,

1566
01:33:33.421 --> 01:33:38.320
Kevin Kelly needs to can't his name again.
He is a,

1567
01:33:38.321 --> 01:33:40.410
he emphasizes to me,
uh,
he's,

1568
01:33:40.411 --> 01:33:44.020
he's such a prolific writer and emphasize this to me,
uh,

1569
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:47.150
a number of years ago.
And,
uh,

1570
01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:52.220
I want to say it goes back probably to Mcphee who is also much like you obsessed

1571
01:33:53.341 --> 01:33:56.760
with structure and,
uh,
if there's a book,

1572
01:33:56.761 --> 01:34:00.930
I think it's called draft number four,
uh,
about his,
it's has some,

1573
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:04.800
some really fascinating explorations of this for those people who really want to

1574
01:34:04.801 --> 01:34:07.110
get into the weeds.
He'll also do it graphically.

1575
01:34:07.111 --> 01:34:10.920
He'll draw out diagrams of what the structure looks like,

1576
01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:14.640
which appeals to me.
But trying to stay on track here,

1577
01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:18.780
I would say Kevin is the most,
well you are the most recent person,

1578
01:34:18.781 --> 01:34:19.770
but a number of years ago,

1579
01:34:19.771 --> 01:34:24.600
Kevin emphasize that to me and probably before that make fee.

1580
01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:27.480
So it's,
it's really liberating number one,

1581
01:34:27.481 --> 01:34:31.950
to embrace that even if you're not fully convinced it's the case.
And,
uh,

1582
01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:36.180
I also want to give a little bit of context for people who may not be familiar

1583
01:34:36.181 --> 01:34:37.380
with book proposals.

1584
01:34:37.770 --> 01:34:42.090
So book proposals in the world of nonfiction books up.

1585
01:34:42.250 --> 01:34:46.080
I suppose I should take a further step back and say in the world of nonfiction,

1586
01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:49.410
so if you're,
if in novels and fiction are totally different,

1587
01:34:49.411 --> 01:34:50.490
in many cases you need to,

1588
01:34:50.491 --> 01:34:55.410
you need to finish that puppy before anyone will tell you if your baby is ugly

1589
01:34:55.411 --> 01:34:59.810
or not,
which is,
it has to terrifying.
Uh,
it must be in,

1590
01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:01.070
in nonfiction,

1591
01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:06.340
you create a book proposal before you write your book and the book proposal and

1592
01:35:08.091 --> 01:35:09.440
feel free to interject at any point.

1593
01:35:09.441 --> 01:35:14.441
But the book proposal is in effect a business plan and an overview slash

1594
01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:18.250
executive summary for your book.
And there's,

1595
01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:23.150
there's a lot you find with the best book proposals and the best startup
pitches,

1596
01:35:23.151 --> 01:35:26.300
which take the form of a deck,
say a PowerPoint or something like that.

1597
01:35:26.450 --> 01:35:27.560
Very often they're,

1598
01:35:27.970 --> 01:35:32.690
they're exceptionally similar.
The,
the,
the,

1599
01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:35.840
the ingredients that make a good startup pitch and the ingredients and making

1600
01:35:35.841 --> 01:35:40.760
good book proposal or very similar.
Uh,
but,
uh,
that that is,

1601
01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:44.780
and I'd love to actually know what the structure of your book proposals look

1602
01:35:44.781 --> 01:35:45.620
like.
I mean,

1603
01:35:45.621 --> 01:35:49.290
I know what ingredients I would potentially include in a book proposal.

1604
01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:53.570
What does the table of contents look like for one of your book proposals?

1605
01:35:54.370 --> 01:35:57.370
<v 3>Yeah.
Um,
I'd have to go back and look.
I think they vary a little bit,</v>

1606
01:35:57.371 --> 01:36:00.750
but they probably have some core design elements.
Uh,

1607
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:05.290
one of them is,
and it's a question that I want to ask myself,
which is,

1608
01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:10.030
um,
um,
uh,
what is this book?

1609
01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:15.310
What's it about?
Okay.
Pretty simple,
pretty simple question.
Um,
uh,

1610
01:36:15.311 --> 01:36:19.390
why is,
I think the more important question is why does it,

1611
01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:23.380
why does it fill a need that hasn't been filled yet?

1612
01:36:23.410 --> 01:36:24.640
Which is basically very similar.

1613
01:36:24.670 --> 01:36:28.600
I use the same business plan analogy that you do on book proposals,

1614
01:36:28.810 --> 01:36:32.800
but it's sort of like a business,
like why,
why is it providing,
uh,
uh,

1615
01:36:32.930 --> 01:36:36.600
why is it filling a need that hasn't otherwise been met?
Like,

1616
01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:40.600
like we're like basically if you draw a map in the marketplace,
um,

1617
01:36:40.930 --> 01:36:44.920
what part of the marketplace of ideas is,
does this,
uh,

1618
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:49.340
does this cover that hasn't been covered?
All right.
Is it this,
you know,
uh,

1619
01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:53.920
um,
so that,
so it's,
you know,
and I don't even mean it in,

1620
01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:56.830
I sometimes will use the high concept.
Um,

1621
01:36:57.130 --> 01:36:59.950
I sometimes will use the high concept pitch.
It's x meets Y,

1622
01:36:59.951 --> 01:37:03.310
which I actually think is actually a very useful heuristic and figuring out

1623
01:37:03.311 --> 01:37:07.300
ideas.
So for instance,
I pitched a whole new mind as um,

1624
01:37:08.130 --> 01:37:12.670
um,
uh,
future shock meets seven habits of highly effective people.

1625
01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:16.810
Um,
it was,
I thought it was pretty good pitch.
And so

1626
01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:20.910
<v 2>a very common in pitching films also just to,
yeah,
just to highlight,</v>

1627
01:37:22.490 --> 01:37:24.560
<v 3>it's a heuristic and it basically,
to me it says,</v>

1628
01:37:24.770 --> 01:37:26.450
if you think about a map of the territory,

1629
01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:29.160
if you think about a map of ideas out there,
um,

1630
01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:33.050
why does no one over here on this part of the map,
right?
Like,
Oh,
show me,

1631
01:37:33.051 --> 01:37:37.160
show me where,
show me,
show me where on the map you're idea is.
All right.

1632
01:37:37.161 --> 01:37:39.950
And let's make sure that someone hasn't gotten there first.
Uh,

1633
01:37:39.970 --> 01:37:44.090
and then tell me why someone hasn't gotten there first.
What are they missing?
Um,

1634
01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:47.300
and so when the case of when for instance,
I say,
well,
the reason they're missing,

1635
01:37:47.301 --> 01:37:51.170
cause everybody thinks science at timing is an art,
but it's actually a science.

1636
01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:55.880
Oh,
okay.
Got It.
That's why no one is there.
Um,
and um,

1637
01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:58.320
it's all talk about what's it about,
um,

1638
01:37:58.350 --> 01:38:02.220
where does it fit into the marketplace of ideas?
Uh,
why is it original?

1639
01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:06.710
And this is also really important.
Who is it for?
All right.
And,

1640
01:38:06.711 --> 01:38:09.330
and the big mistake that,
that everybody writing about,

1641
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:12.570
and if there's one takeaway from this conversation for prospective writers out

1642
01:38:12.571 --> 01:38:16.530
there,
it's this,
the mistake that writers make,

1643
01:38:16.531 --> 01:38:18.840
and I think business people make too,
and they're in their pitches,

1644
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:22.440
is when they say,
who's it for?
Who's the audience?
Who's the customer?

1645
01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:25.980
They always want to say everybody.
And it's not,

1646
01:38:26.430 --> 01:38:30.430
it's never everybody.
All right.
And,
and what I tried to do it,

1647
01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:34.500
I've included a section of who is,
who is not going to buy that book.

1648
01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:38.370
Like I will have you have a section on who isn't the customer,
right.

1649
01:38:38.490 --> 01:38:42.750
I was not who is not going to buy this book because I think that that's the only

1650
01:38:42.751 --> 01:38:46.650
way to think carefully about,
because books are not a mass medium.

1651
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:51.120
And even media products in general are no longer mass,
medium mass media.

1652
01:38:51.370 --> 01:38:53.850
They're no longer mass.
And it's like,
who is,

1653
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:57.660
and so I'll have bullets and they're saying,
who is not going to buy this book?

1654
01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:02.720
Um,
and um,
um,
and that,
and,
and,

1655
01:39:02.721 --> 01:39:06.600
and that helps.
And that helps define the audience too.
And also I try to,

1656
01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:10.470
you know,
and that that's all that,
you know,
that's really all that it is.
But if,

1657
01:39:10.471 --> 01:39:12.390
you know,
uh,
what the book is about,

1658
01:39:12.810 --> 01:39:15.990
where it fits into the marketplace of ideas of why it's different from anything

1659
01:39:15.991 --> 01:39:19.710
else that,
that came before it and why and who's and who it's for,

1660
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:24.450
I think those components are really essential.
But that fourth component is,

1661
01:39:24.451 --> 01:39:29.190
and I say this to writers too,
like I raised to tell me who the book is not for,

1662
01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:32.520
tell me who's not going to buy this book.
And people have a hard time saying,

1663
01:39:32.521 --> 01:39:33.960
well,
everybody will buy this book.

1664
01:39:34.290 --> 01:39:38.100
Somebody pitched to me and idea somebody came to me once with the idea of a book

1665
01:39:38.101 --> 01:39:42.870
about,
um,
uh,
uh,
s somebody was,
give me asking you advice on it.

1666
01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:45.330
It was a book about,
um,
I,
I hope I don't,
I don't,

1667
01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:49.190
I think the book might have gotten published.
I don't want to reveal the name.
Uh,

1668
01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:52.350
it was a book about the history of Yoga in America.
All right.

1669
01:39:52.351 --> 01:39:53.880
The history or remove the history of you.
Yeah,

1670
01:39:53.881 --> 01:39:57.150
I think it was a history of yoga and I was like,
oh,
okay,
that's cool.

1671
01:39:57.151 --> 01:40:00.840
So I think a lot of people,
um,
who do yoga might be interested in that.

1672
01:40:01.230 --> 01:40:03.570
And she said,
well,

1673
01:40:03.571 --> 01:40:06.240
I think people who don't do yoga are going to be interested in this.
And I said,

1674
01:40:06.450 --> 01:40:06.781
no,

1675
01:40:06.781 --> 01:40:11.780
they're not like people who don't do yoga don't care about the history of Yo.

1676
01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:14.440
All right,
you can,
there are a lot of their shoe,

1677
01:40:14.441 --> 01:40:16.250
a lot of people in America who do yoga.
I like,

1678
01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:18.540
that's a pretty good audience right there.
But don't tell the every,

1679
01:40:18.570 --> 01:40:23.160
you know what I mean?
And so,
um,
you know,
uh,
you know,
so,
so,
so,

1680
01:40:23.190 --> 01:40:26.250
so for me it's like,
you know,
for me it's like,
like my books.
Like,
okay,

1681
01:40:26.251 --> 01:40:30.480
I know that the,
um,
the,
um,

1682
01:40:30.570 --> 01:40:33.540
like this book about the science that this book about the science of timing,

1683
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:35.680
I know that um,

1684
01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:40.880
certain people in my neighborhood in northwest Washington DC who read or of a

1685
01:40:42.541 --> 01:40:46.400
certain age and read only,
um,
uh,

1686
01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:51.090
literary fiction and 700 page biography is a founding fathers.

1687
01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:53.820
They're not going to read this book.
They're not going to read it.

1688
01:40:53.821 --> 01:40:57.190
They might be my neighbors.
They're not going to read one of my books.
Um,

1689
01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:01.750
and so I think that's really,
really important about who is the book not for,

1690
01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:03.210
<v 2>well,</v>

1691
01:41:03.210 --> 01:41:08.210
it's also an indicator of focus and logical slash a rational thinking in a

1692
01:41:11.111 --> 01:41:13.570
sense,
right?
Because if you're,
for instance,
just to digress for a minute,

1693
01:41:13.571 --> 01:41:17.590
but if you're in the world of investing where I spent a long time with early

1694
01:41:17.591 --> 01:41:19.870
stage startups,
17 years or so,

1695
01:41:20.130 --> 01:41:22.660
if they say everyone is my customer,

1696
01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:27.700
there was a very real risk that if you give them x number of dollars,

1697
01:41:27.701 --> 01:41:32.560
you give them $1 million that they could be developing Dropbox for say early

1698
01:41:32.561 --> 01:41:35.050
tech adopters in the first wave and they,

1699
01:41:35.090 --> 01:41:37.660
they need to get from zero to 10,000 users.

1700
01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:43.020
And if there is a a a 80% off deal for something like shopping mall circulars or

1701
01:41:46.271 --> 01:41:50.110
something that they would jump on that and Piss,
piss away all their money.

1702
01:41:50.530 --> 01:41:53.370
And uh,
yeah,
we'd certainly,
I think books,

1703
01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:58.330
a lot of books fail and this is true presentations too from too much

1704
01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:03.310
miscellaneous information,
not too little a,
if that makes any sense.

1705
01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:07.230
<v 3>Absolutely.
It's a,
it's a matter of,
it's a,
it's,
it's really just a matter of,</v>

1706
01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:10.200
it's really just a matter of focus.
And I'm going back to the speech thing.

1707
01:42:10.201 --> 01:42:11.250
I mean,
one of the,

1708
01:42:11.850 --> 01:42:14.970
one of the pieces of advice to the extent that anybody ever asks me for advice

1709
01:42:15.330 --> 01:42:19.860
I'm giving,
I'm giving speeches and whatnot,
is,
um,
you know,

1710
01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:24.600
and it sounds a little like a,
it sounds like a Zen Koan ish sort of phrase,

1711
01:42:24.601 --> 01:42:26.460
but it basically,
my point is,
uh,

1712
01:42:26.610 --> 01:42:30.120
say something important rather than saying important things.
Um,

1713
01:42:30.210 --> 01:42:34.620
and like I find a lot of times people say something important rather than say

1714
01:42:34.621 --> 01:42:35.910
important things that,

1715
01:42:35.911 --> 01:42:38.790
cause I think a lot of times people like that sort of stuff within the skin,

1716
01:42:38.791 --> 01:42:39.900
all the things they found out,

1717
01:42:39.901 --> 01:42:43.260
all the things that they know and they ended up not saying anything important.

1718
01:42:43.890 --> 01:42:48.810
Um,
and so,
you know,
um,
I,
yeah.

1719
01:42:48.811 --> 01:42:53.520
So,
um,
uh,
so that's,
that's the reason for doing it.
That's so,
anyway,

1720
01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:56.950
<v 1>you get the idea.
Yeah.
No,
it isn't.
There are so many,</v>

1721
01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:01.910
<v 2>uh,
comparable examples.
Uh,
if,</v>

1722
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.670
if for instance,
you look for this,

1723
01:43:06.230 --> 01:43:10.460
this vetting of ideas by putting together a

1724
01:43:10.670 --> 01:43:15.050
<v 1>short synopsis of some type.
And there's one example,
for instance,</v>

1725
01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:17.480
and I believe this is true,
uh,
I've,

1726
01:43:17.481 --> 01:43:20.840
I've certainly heard it and read about it a few times and I know a fair number

1727
01:43:20.841 --> 01:43:23.060
of people who work at Amazon,
but they didn't have to confirm.

1728
01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:26.840
But I think Ian Mcallister,
who used to at least be a general manager at Amazon,

1729
01:43:26.841 --> 01:43:31.370
talked about this is working backwards and for,
for new,
for new initiatives,

1730
01:43:31.371 --> 01:43:35.030
the product manager who would be in charge of developing,
say a new product,

1731
01:43:35.031 --> 01:43:38.540
has to write an internal press release,
which announces the finished product,

1732
01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:43.180
right?
So that,
and that has to focus on effectively exactly what,

1733
01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:47.420
what you said.
And I'm quoting here from,
uh,
a medium piece,

1734
01:43:47.421 --> 01:43:50.780
but quotes centered around the customer problem,
how current solutions,

1735
01:43:51.170 --> 01:43:52.070
internal or external

1736
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:56.630
<v 5>fail and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.
And,
uh,</v>

1737
01:43:56.660 --> 01:44:00.530
it's the same thing.
It's the same thing.
If you can't write that press release,

1738
01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:05.560
like how on earth are you going to navigate the decision tree of getting to a

1739
01:44:07.850 --> 01:44:12.260
product that finds its feet?
I mean,
it could be very different,
difficult.

1740
01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:15.920
Not to say you don't iterate,
but,
uh,
it's,
it's a good idea.

1741
01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:20.750
It's a good filter through which you can at least catch the detritus that

1742
01:44:20.751 --> 01:44:23.160
shouldn't make it to step two.
Oh Man,

1743
01:44:23.190 --> 01:44:26.940
I have to say I am your Hallelujah chorus on that press release technique.
Uh,

1744
01:44:26.941 --> 01:44:30.950
I've,
I've literally done that,
uh,
working with,
uh,
working,
uh,

1745
01:44:30.951 --> 01:44:33.570
I think it's helpful for like nonprofit groups that I'm involved in.

1746
01:44:33.870 --> 01:44:38.250
So nonprofit group wants to do a big project,
but they're all over the place.

1747
01:44:38.251 --> 01:44:41.310
They don't know exactly what they want to do.
And I literally did this,
I said,

1748
01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:43.200
I'll tell you what,
here's what I think the project has.

1749
01:44:43.201 --> 01:44:46.890
Let me write a press release from two years from now and they'll send it around.

1750
01:44:46.950 --> 01:44:51.090
And it ended up being,
uh,
I got the idea from Amazon too.
It ended up being this,

1751
01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:54.170
it ended up being this thing that was really,
really focused.
So the,

1752
01:44:54.370 --> 01:44:59.010
the Blahbidy Blah,
uh,
group,
uh,
announced today that it was doing Bobby blabity,

1753
01:44:59.011 --> 01:45:01.140
blabity blah.
And it's like,
you know,

1754
01:45:01.141 --> 01:45:04.170
and then he had a quotes and things in it and it,
and it being this,

1755
01:45:04.171 --> 01:45:09.171
this focal point on for the whole organization on what are we actually trying to

1756
01:45:09.241 --> 01:45:13.690
accomplish here.
So I'm a,
I'm a I second that emotion there.
Big Time.

1757
01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:17.160
And just to return to another thing that you said,

1758
01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:20.370
which I'll paraphrase here as if everyone's your customer,

1759
01:45:20.371 --> 01:45:22.050
no one's your customer.
Uh,

1760
01:45:22.051 --> 01:45:26.040
another filter Yvette or question that I use or have used,

1761
01:45:26.041 --> 01:45:27.480
I'm not really in the startup game anymore,

1762
01:45:27.481 --> 01:45:29.820
but have used a lot with startups because they'll ask me,

1763
01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:35.080
you say a landing page and look at copy and messaging and so on and before I

1764
01:45:35.371 --> 01:45:38.010
will review it because I'll,
if,

1765
01:45:38.060 --> 01:45:42.210
if with no further information I have to review it based on my pair of eyes and

1766
01:45:42.211 --> 01:45:46.800
my perspective and my particular problems that I can try to empathize then put

1767
01:45:46.801 --> 01:45:50.640
myself in other people's shoes.
But I have to know whose shoes to put myself in.

1768
01:45:50.641 --> 01:45:54.690
And so I'll ask them,
if you could only have a thousand people sign up for this,

1769
01:45:55.530 --> 01:45:58.140
who would they be and why?
Like,
describe for me,

1770
01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:03.090
and this isn't a politically correct exercise,
like what is gender,
uh,

1771
01:46:03.150 --> 01:46:06.270
race,
if that matter is maybe it doesn't,
like where do they live?

1772
01:46:06.270 --> 01:46:11.220
What magazines or websites do they read?
Uh,
what is their household income?

1773
01:46:11.221 --> 01:46:15.690
Like really get granular about what these people have in common,
right?
Like,

1774
01:46:15.691 --> 01:46:17.400
do you want all the readers of people magazine?

1775
01:46:17.550 --> 01:46:21.750
Do you want the 2000 people who attend?
Ted?
Do you want something in between?

1776
01:46:21.751 --> 01:46:25.890
Like really described that for?
And only once that's been done,

1777
01:46:26.970 --> 01:46:31.970
can I actually give feedback on modifying any of the features or copy or

1778
01:46:32.011 --> 01:46:36.770
messaging on a particular page,
uh,
sets,
I mean it's,

1779
01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:41.190
it's these,
these principles really transferred to a lot of different areas.
Well,

1780
01:46:41.380 --> 01:46:41.850
I,

1781
01:46:41.850 --> 01:46:46.850
let me ask a a just a handful of additional questions and then maybe we can do

1782
01:46:47.251 --> 01:46:48.630
around two sometime.
But the,

1783
01:46:49.290 --> 01:46:53.130
we've been talking a lot about the decisions you've made,

1784
01:46:53.490 --> 01:46:58.170
the routines that you have.
And although you're very self effacing,

1785
01:46:58.171 --> 01:47:02.190
I mean someone could look at your bio and be very intimidated and assume that

1786
01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:06.500
you step up to the plate and hit home runs more often than not.
Uh,

1787
01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:11.220
could you tell us about
maybe a specific,

1788
01:47:11.221 --> 01:47:15.210
if you're open to it,
difficult period that you've gone through or a down period,

1789
01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:16.770
challenging period or failure,

1790
01:47:16.771 --> 01:47:21.771
it could be any of those things and what you did to get back on your feet or the

1791
01:47:23.131 --> 01:47:28.131
decisions you made that helped you then can get back on firm ground if a,

1792
01:47:28.381 --> 01:47:30.840
if anything comes to mind.
Sure,
sure,
sure.

1793
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:34.110
<v 4>There are all kinds of things.
Um,
so I mean,</v>

1794
01:47:34.111 --> 01:47:36.420
I hate to keep going back to the,

1795
01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:39.660
I hate to keep going back to the law school days,
but um,

1796
01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:43.630
but I,
um,
uh,

1797
01:47:43.670 --> 01:47:46.890
I did Lee law school after my first year.
Uh,

1798
01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:51.600
and I hated it so much that I went to India instead.
And,
um,

1799
01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:54.240
I traveled around,
I traveled around India,

1800
01:47:54.241 --> 01:47:58.140
which was a incredible life changing experience because I was a young guy,

1801
01:47:58.470 --> 01:48:02.290
you know,
whatever old I was like 25,
26 years old.
And you know,

1802
01:48:02.370 --> 01:48:04.770
at the time it was,
you know,
it was awhile ago,

1803
01:48:04.771 --> 01:48:08.040
so at the time India was even cheaper but much,
much cheaper than it was.

1804
01:48:08.041 --> 01:48:09.790
So if you're like,
uh,

1805
01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:14.310
a 25 year old dudes traveling on your own with a little tiny little bit of money

1806
01:48:14.311 --> 01:48:18.720
in her pocket and you can make it to go very,
very,
very,
very far.
And so,
um,

1807
01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:20.670
so at the time I guess I felt like,

1808
01:48:20.671 --> 01:48:23.970
because I didn't do very well in my initial foray into law school,

1809
01:48:24.150 --> 01:48:26.130
I didn't really like it.
I was pretty miserable.

1810
01:48:26.131 --> 01:48:30.720
I felt that had made a terrible decision and I s some level just tried to

1811
01:48:30.721 --> 01:48:35.340
escape.
And,
and the way I got back into it was,

1812
01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:39.240
um,
um,
essentially saying,
okay,

1813
01:48:39.241 --> 01:48:41.980
if I'm going to do this,
then,
um,

1814
01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:45.900
I'm going to try to figure out what are the one or two things that I can find

1815
01:48:45.901 --> 01:48:50.010
valuable and this experience and just try to power my way through.

1816
01:48:50.370 --> 01:48:52.980
And I guess that's all I get.
That's all that I get.
That's all that I,

1817
01:48:53.070 --> 01:48:55.350
I guess that's all that I did to do,
to overcome that.

1818
01:48:55.351 --> 01:48:58.530
But I felt pretty bad about how I didn't do very well.
I didn't,

1819
01:48:58.590 --> 01:49:00.210
I didn't really like it.
I thought I had made it.

1820
01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:03.060
Like I thought I had made like a ruinous decision about,

1821
01:49:03.090 --> 01:49:07.620
about how my life was going to go and when I sort of kind of woke up and matured

1822
01:49:07.621 --> 01:49:08.760
a little bit,
I said,
okay,

1823
01:49:08.970 --> 01:49:12.150
some people make like bad things actually happened to people.

1824
01:49:12.151 --> 01:49:16.110
And I think going to India was actually helpful in that regard too because like,

1825
01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:21.000
okay,
I'm not living in a tar paper shack with filthy water.
Right.
I'm just,

1826
01:49:21.610 --> 01:49:22.120
I'm not,

1827
01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:26.400
I'm not self actualizing fast enough for a 25 year old middle class person,

1828
01:49:26.401 --> 01:49:28.410
that's not a real problem.
Um,

1829
01:49:28.830 --> 01:49:33.450
and so I think that sort of putting the problems in perspective and just trying

1830
01:49:33.451 --> 01:49:36.050
to find some,
um,

1831
01:49:36.090 --> 01:49:39.210
some goodness in what you're doing next.

1832
01:49:39.450 --> 01:49:44.450
And also I just like really deriving specific lessons from these kinds of

1833
01:49:44.821 --> 01:49:45.450
failures.

1834
01:49:45.450 --> 01:49:50.230
And I think that's another part that's important to me is it rather than rather

1835
01:49:50.231 --> 01:49:54.790
than simply allow like sort of this hazy notion of what you learned.

1836
01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:59.110
I,
again,
I'm a big believer in writing things,
in writing things down.

1837
01:49:59.111 --> 01:50:02.200
I'll give you,
I'll give you a better,
I'll give you a better example of that.
Um,

1838
01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:04.210
uh,
and this is,
I don't want to call this like a,

1839
01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:08.410
a major failure cause it's not that,
that's not that significant.
But,
uh,

1840
01:50:08.411 --> 01:50:12.430
so I did a TV show for National Geographic and I worked with,
uh,
uh,
uh,

1841
01:50:12.490 --> 01:50:15.850
TV series and I worked with some really great people and we put on a really

1842
01:50:15.851 --> 01:50:20.170
fricking great show and it didn't get picked up for a second season.
And,

1843
01:50:20.590 --> 01:50:24.490
um,
and so it was disappointing,
but it's not like a massive failure.

1844
01:50:24.491 --> 01:50:28.780
It's not like anything real like in life.
But at that time what I did is I said,

1845
01:50:28.810 --> 01:50:31.060
you know,
I basically framed it a file and said,
okay,

1846
01:50:31.061 --> 01:50:32.450
here's what I learned from this experience.

1847
01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:34.360
Things that I learned from this experience.
Like,
one,

1848
01:50:34.690 --> 01:50:36.850
I like working with really talented people.

1849
01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:40.380
They are people who helped me perform better to um,

1850
01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:43.600
I don't like to be involved in projects that I don't have full control,

1851
01:50:43.630 --> 01:50:47.650
creative control over three.
Um,
um,

1852
01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:52.300
working with people in traditional television can be very perilous because

1853
01:50:52.301 --> 01:50:56.350
they're subject to all kinds of pressures that are out of their control.

1854
01:50:56.590 --> 01:51:00.850
And so you have this experience where things didn't go the way you want it to,

1855
01:51:01.060 --> 01:51:04.210
but if you actually literally right down the lessons,

1856
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:06.080
I think you can get something positive out of it.

1857
01:51:06.650 --> 01:51:09.400
And it was the writing down of these lessons,

1858
01:51:10.030 --> 01:51:14.290
more of a Cathartic exercise or these,

1859
01:51:14.291 --> 01:51:18.670
would you go back and revisit that?
You know what I like?

1860
01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:21.400
Like for me,
a lot of times what I will do is,

1861
01:51:21.401 --> 01:51:25.600
for me it's sometimes certain writing things down is simply the act of writing

1862
01:51:25.601 --> 01:51:28.060
it down is enough to solidify it.
Um,

1863
01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:32.200
so I'll do the kind of thing where before a talk or something like that,
I will,

1864
01:51:32.410 --> 01:51:36.520
um,
like write an outline.
Like,
like basically I'll,
I'll,

1865
01:51:36.530 --> 01:51:40.000
I'll know what I want to do and then I'll take notes and write an outline of the

1866
01:51:40.001 --> 01:51:40.361
speech.

1867
01:51:40.361 --> 01:51:44.260
And the points I want to hit and then I literally will not look at it like I

1868
01:51:44.261 --> 01:51:45.640
sometimes won't even bring it up with me.

1869
01:51:45.670 --> 01:51:49.720
I'll forget to bring it up with it because the act of the act of actually

1870
01:51:49.721 --> 01:51:54.460
memorializing it is really what gives it,
it's,
it's,
it's,
this is,
uh,

1871
01:51:54.850 --> 01:51:57.130
what,
what I don't want what I'm trying to say in a,
in a,

1872
01:51:57.131 --> 01:52:01.520
in a somewhat ham handed way is that like when you,

1873
01:52:01.521 --> 01:52:04.180
you want to,
um,

1874
01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:09.480
you don't want those kinds of lessons to be hazy too much.

1875
01:52:10.330 --> 01:52:11.860
Uh,
you want to actually like what,

1876
01:52:11.861 --> 01:52:16.840
like what specific thing that I actually derive from this.
Um,

1877
01:52:16.930 --> 01:52:19.210
and I think that's really useful.

1878
01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:21.940
There's also a great technique that Tina Seelig has used.

1879
01:52:22.130 --> 01:52:23.440
You can see like he was at Stanford has,

1880
01:52:23.441 --> 01:52:26.680
has used where she talks about she writes a failure resume,

1881
01:52:26.890 --> 01:52:29.050
so she has a resume of all of our failures.

1882
01:52:29.260 --> 01:52:31.060
And then with each one what she learned from it.

1883
01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:35.670
When would she use something like that?
Um,

1884
01:52:35.740 --> 01:52:37.420
I mean she keeps it for herself,

1885
01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:41.950
but she would use ongoing working document just like,
yeah,

1886
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:47.090
yeah.
Ongoing working document that basically,
so you can look at it and say,
okay,

1887
01:52:47.091 --> 01:52:49.040
what are the,
you know,
boy,
I made a lot of mistakes,

1888
01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:51.590
but here's what I learned from them and don't make the same mistake a second

1889
01:52:51.591 --> 01:52:52.970
time.
I don't mind making mistakes.

1890
01:52:53.210 --> 01:52:55.850
What I don't like is making the same mistake twice

1891
01:52:57.910 --> 01:53:02.380
<v 5>with the,
uh,
two questions on India.
Why India?</v>

1892
01:53:02.620 --> 01:53:03.940
And then second,

1893
01:53:04.690 --> 01:53:09.690
how did you decide to find the compelling,

1894
01:53:11.710 --> 01:53:12.543
I suppose,

1895
01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:17.920
benefits of continuing with law school versus changing course?

1896
01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:22.940
<v 4>Um,
let's see.
Um,</v>

1897
01:53:25.590 --> 01:53:27.960
uh,
you know what I think,
okay,
it's on the second one.

1898
01:53:27.961 --> 01:53:32.400
I think it was too risk averse to change course fully.
Um,
I think that the,

1899
01:53:32.410 --> 01:53:34.740
I think that would have been too much,
excuse me,

1900
01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:38.900
too much of like a narcissistic injury just to like leave all together.
Uh,

1901
01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:42.420
I probably would've,
I probably would've felt like an abject failure.

1902
01:53:42.421 --> 01:53:46.710
So I don't even think that was in the cards.
Um,
so on,
on the white India,

1903
01:53:46.711 --> 01:53:49.990
a couple of reasons I'd always been fascinated by it.
Um,
I knew that,

1904
01:53:49.991 --> 01:53:54.210
that I could get around,
um,
that,
that I,
that I,
uh,

1905
01:53:54.211 --> 01:53:59.010
the previous summer I had been to southern Africa and,
you know,

1906
01:53:59.250 --> 01:54:03.900
um,
and it was the first,
I had never been out of the country,
um,
uh,

1907
01:54:04.260 --> 01:54:06.770
until I was 23 years old.
Um,

1908
01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:12.140
and so the first time I left the country,
I went to southern Africa,
um,
on,
uh,
I,

1909
01:54:12.141 --> 01:54:15.700
I got a raise some money to,
to do this,
to do a project there.
And they were,

1910
01:54:15.701 --> 01:54:17.250
that was a revelation.
It's like,
holy crap,

1911
01:54:17.251 --> 01:54:18.810
this world is a lot bigger than I thought.

1912
01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:21.300
And so I wanted to go to someplace that wasn't,
you know,

1913
01:54:21.301 --> 01:54:24.750
Europe or someplace that was a little bit different from a little bit more

1914
01:54:24.751 --> 01:54:26.500
different from the United States.
Um,

1915
01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:29.010
and so in India was a place that always been fascinated by,

1916
01:54:29.011 --> 01:54:30.210
it spoke English and it was cheap.

1917
01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:31.980
<v 5>That's,</v>

1918
01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:35.980
that's a compelling combination for someone even in law school for a period.

1919
01:54:36.770 --> 01:54:40.740
<v 4>Yeah.
When you're 25 years old or however old I was,
and um,</v>

1920
01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:44.910
and you have like a little money in your pocket,
but you can go,

1921
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.500
you could go so far on so little money.
It was unbelievable to me,

1922
01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:51.860
you know,
especially if you're willing to like sleep over,

1923
01:54:51.900 --> 01:54:55.780
like take over night trains rather than pay for a place to stay.
Um,

1924
01:54:56.550 --> 01:54:58.560
or you know,
live in these,
you know,

1925
01:54:58.561 --> 01:55:01.590
go to sleep in these places where there's just a row of beds on a,

1926
01:55:02.010 --> 01:55:04.620
on a balcony and the mosquito nets over each one.

1927
01:55:06.710 --> 01:55:08.380
<v 5>So the,
uh,
I mean,</v>

1928
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:12.320
travel is one of those gifts that keeps on giving in a sense.
Uh,

1929
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:15.670
I would put books in that same category.
Yeah,
I agree.

1930
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:19.620
You've written a lot of books,
you've read even more books,
uh,

1931
01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:24.500
besides your own,
and I'll just get a segway into a couple of short questions.

1932
01:55:24.530 --> 01:55:25.820
What,
what books?

1933
01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:29.900
Are there any books that you've gifted often to other people or repeatedly out

1934
01:55:29.901 --> 01:55:30.734
of people?

1935
01:55:31.070 --> 01:55:35.570
<v 4>Oh,
yeah.
Um,
uh,
so,
uh,</v>

1936
01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:38.390
they're probably books that you're,
uh,
I,

1937
01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:41.900
I'm at a might've been books that you've covered in this,
in your show here.

1938
01:55:41.930 --> 01:55:44.010
So one of them is bird bird by Anne Lamott.

1939
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:47.710
So one of the greatest things ever.
Um,

1940
01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:51.600
I come back to that advice so many different times.
It's,
it's a saying,

1941
01:55:51.601 --> 01:55:54.180
even in the pink household,
uh,
were like,

1942
01:55:54.210 --> 01:55:58.710
we'll just say like one member of my family say to the other who's struggling.

1943
01:55:58.770 --> 01:56:02.550
Okay.
Bird by bird,
bird by bird.
Um,

1944
01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:07.830
and so,
um,
I am a huge,
and I stumbled into this book.

1945
01:56:07.950 --> 01:56:10.080
I remember I've got,
I remember where I got this next book.

1946
01:56:10.081 --> 01:56:13.710
I got it in the airport in San Francisco,
uh,
in,
in the,
uh,

1947
01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:17.820
the bookstore in the San Francisco Sfo.
Um,
and for some reason,
uh,

1948
01:56:17.860 --> 01:56:20.070
I picked it up because it had this really weird cover,

1949
01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:25.280
but one of the first additions of the war of art by Steven Pressfield had this

1950
01:56:26.850 --> 01:56:28.980
kind of silvery covered to it.

1951
01:56:29.610 --> 01:56:32.010
And I bought that book in the,

1952
01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:35.970
I think there's a compass bookstore in Sfo just because,
wow,
that's kind of cool.

1953
01:56:35.971 --> 01:56:38.760
It's silver cover.
And it's really short.
And I got it.
And it's like,
oh my God,

1954
01:56:38.761 --> 01:56:40.980
I can't believe how good this book is.
Um,

1955
01:56:41.010 --> 01:56:44.490
and so I even have a little sign on my desk here that says beat the resistance.

1956
01:56:44.491 --> 01:56:46.020
So I've given that book out a lot too.

1957
01:56:47.390 --> 01:56:50.400
So press field and Lamont and then,
um,

1958
01:56:51.570 --> 01:56:54.570
um,
man,
I have to say Victor Frankl,

1959
01:56:55.050 --> 01:56:59.450
man's search for meaning a is up to up to I,
it's less I give it to be,
I,

1960
01:56:59.451 --> 01:57:04.050
I've given out out less.
But uh,
that's a,
that's a hugely important book for me.

1961
01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:09.420
<v 5>Yeah,
that's,
that's one of those books I really need to reread.</v>

1962
01:57:09.770 --> 01:57:14.030
And I think you've,
you've actually spoken about,
uh,
let,

1963
01:57:14.050 --> 01:57:17.820
let me get this right.
I was about to say animal house,
but that is not right.

1964
01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:20.460
Animal farm or all that kind of simple form.
Is it?

1965
01:57:20.660 --> 01:57:22.400
<v 4>I out farm is one of the greatest books ever</v>

1966
01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:24.360
<v 5>and,
and how you,</v>

1967
01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:28.890
it's a completely different experience as a book at different points in your

1968
01:57:28.891 --> 01:57:31.140
life and absolutely.
Right.

1969
01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:34.800
And the last time I read man's search for meaning was probably,

1970
01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:37.110
I would say seven to 10 years ago.

1971
01:57:37.140 --> 01:57:40.290
And a lot of changes in my life in that period of time.

1972
01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:45.540
I think that that is worthy of a reread.
Uh,
and have you,

1973
01:57:45.541 --> 01:57:49.080
it sounds like you've re-read each of these books also bird by bird,

1974
01:57:49.081 --> 01:57:52.440
the war of art man.
Search for meaning yourself.
You've read these more.
Yeah,

1975
01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:57.470
I've read it more than one.
Yeah.
And uh,
but I'm not,
I'm not chronic

1976
01:57:57.470 --> 01:58:00.110
<v 4>reread or I'm like,
there are some people who are regularly re there.</v>

1977
01:58:00.140 --> 01:58:04.910
There were relatively few books that I have that I have re-read.
Um,

1978
01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:09.380
uh,
but,
but,
but those,
those,
uh,
uh,
those I absolutely have.

1979
01:58:09.410 --> 01:58:11.690
And once I had another experience in college,

1980
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:14.360
I guess the only thing I remember in college are shards of things that

1981
01:58:14.361 --> 01:58:17.270
professors said,
like basically one liners.
Uh,

1982
01:58:17.271 --> 01:58:20.540
but I had a professor once in college who in an American studies course,

1983
01:58:20.541 --> 01:58:24.570
he assigned us to read the adventures of Huckleberry Finn.
So you're at,

1984
01:58:24.620 --> 01:58:27.260
you're in college and your professors assigned you to read the adventures of

1985
01:58:27.261 --> 01:58:30.050
Huckleberry Finn.
People are like,
oh,
you know,

1986
01:58:30.060 --> 01:58:33.770
because like everybody read that book in high school and,
and he said something,

1987
01:58:33.771 --> 01:58:37.790
he said the following words,
he says,
I know you've read that book,

1988
01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:43.220
but you haven't read that book,
meaning the person you are today.
And,

1989
01:58:43.390 --> 01:58:46.700
and that ends up being,
but that ends up being true.
So when I've read,
uh,

1990
01:58:47.020 --> 01:58:51.330
I read animal farm at different points in my life,
um,
uh,
and,

1991
01:58:51.331 --> 01:58:55.030
and had different view on it.
I read great Gatsby at different points in my life.

1992
01:58:55.330 --> 01:58:58.450
Um,
I have seen the play a death of a salesman.

1993
01:58:59.270 --> 01:59:00.103
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1994
01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:04.170
<v 4>Perform,
I don't know,
probably seven times.</v>

1995
01:59:04.620 --> 01:59:06.960
And each one feels a little bit different to me.

1996
01:59:06.961 --> 01:59:10.200
I had a completely different view of death of a salesman once I became a father

1997
01:59:10.201 --> 01:59:14.460
versus before I became a father.
Um,
it can,
I had,
I had a,

1998
01:59:14.461 --> 01:59:18.180
another view of death of a salesman,
uh,
uh,

1999
01:59:18.210 --> 01:59:22.890
before I knew about,
uh,
uh,
you know,
new know had,

2000
01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:27.420
had read about psychopharmacology and mental illness and after I did.
Um,

2001
01:59:27.630 --> 01:59:30.530
and so,
you know,
I,
I think that that experience,

2002
01:59:30.540 --> 01:59:34.420
I think those kinds of experiences are really fascinating.
Animal Farm.

2003
01:59:34.421 --> 01:59:35.700
I was like,
oh,
it's really cool.

2004
01:59:35.701 --> 01:59:40.150
It's about the Soviet Union and power corrupts and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And,

2005
01:59:40.151 --> 01:59:41.850
and I,
and now I read the book,
it's like,
okay,

2006
01:59:41.851 --> 01:59:45.500
this book is basically about organizational dysfunction.
This book,

2007
01:59:45.540 --> 01:59:47.460
I would cares whether it's supposed to be at the Soviet Union.

2008
01:59:47.610 --> 01:59:51.180
This book is about the acne widget corporation and how screwed up human

2009
01:59:51.181 --> 01:59:52.840
organizations are like this.
I,

2010
01:59:52.841 --> 01:59:56.700
I think that animal farm should be in every organizational behavior class in an

2011
01:59:56.701 --> 01:59:57.534
MBA program.

2012
01:59:58.800 --> 02:00:01.380
<v 5>That's another one.
I need to reread.
Not a long book either.
I mean,</v>

2013
02:00:01.381 --> 02:00:05.070
I read that in sixth grade or something.
I mean,
come on,

2014
02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:10.990
<v 4>you'll see it completely.
You'll see it completely differently.
That's a,</v>

2015
02:00:10.991 --> 02:00:13.360
that's a great book.
I've written 19 before,
multiple times too.

2016
02:00:14.250 --> 02:00:18.520
<v 5>Also a very timely book.
Uh,
these days</v>

2017
02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:24.810
<v 4>on that front,
I,
I read,
uh,
uh,
uh,
the Handmaid's tale for the first time.</v>

2018
02:00:24.811 --> 02:00:28.300
I have sort of 30 years late to it that I read on.
I love that book.
Um,

2019
02:00:28.410 --> 02:00:30.000
I have a whole,
I'm not joking around.
I,

2020
02:00:30.010 --> 02:00:32.940
and if you want validation I'll send you a photograph of an eye.

2021
02:00:32.941 --> 02:00:35.940
I basically have a stack of books right here that,

2022
02:00:36.150 --> 02:00:41.150
that's basically dystopia books that includes Philip Roth,

2023
02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:45.870
the plot against America,
um,
and Octavia Butler book.

2024
02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:49.920
Um,
Sinclair Lewis.
It can't happen here.
Um,

2025
02:00:49.921 --> 02:00:53.640
another Saifai book called a Elliot Elliot Pepper called Cumulus and other one

2026
02:00:53.641 --> 02:00:57.810
called Infomart cracy by Monica older.
I have a whole,
um,
I'm basically,

2027
02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:02.010
I have a whole pile of dystopian works.
Why is that?
Why do you,

2028
02:01:02.070 --> 02:01:03.480
why do you really want to understand?

2029
02:01:03.481 --> 02:01:06.300
I want to understand that the current moment more,
more clearly.

2030
02:01:08.740 --> 02:01:13.000
<v 5>So,
well this might be,
just might be an appropriate next question.</v>

2031
02:01:13.001 --> 02:01:14.770
It doesn't have to be related to what you just said,

2032
02:01:14.771 --> 02:01:18.820
but if you could put a short message on a billboard,

2033
02:01:19.060 --> 02:01:23.320
metaphorically speaking,
to get a word,
a quote,

2034
02:01:24.070 --> 02:01:26.500
a question out to millions or billions of people,

2035
02:01:26.501 --> 02:01:28.150
what might you put on that billboard?

2036
02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:31.670
<v 4>Well,
it's interesting cause I think it is related to um,</v>

2037
02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:36.630
what we were just talking about or maybe the fact that you asked it in this

2038
02:01:36.631 --> 02:01:41.480
context made me relate it.
Um,
but one of the,
um,

2039
02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:44.390
one of the things that I would,

2040
02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:48.920
I would write would be assume positive intent that would fit very nicely on a

2041
02:01:48.921 --> 02:01:52.750
billboard assume,
assume positive intent.
Because I think,
and I,

2042
02:01:52.751 --> 02:01:54.460
and I've changed my view on this,
Tim.
Uh,

2043
02:01:54.600 --> 02:01:59.360
I've actually in some ways become,
um,

2044
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:01.730
I've sort of gone the reverse.
Like,

2045
02:02:01.731 --> 02:02:05.270
like basically the general view is that people are idealistic when they're young

2046
02:02:05.271 --> 02:02:06.350
and cynical when they're older.

2047
02:02:06.351 --> 02:02:10.130
And I've actually become less cynical as I've gotten older.
Uh,

2048
02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:14.720
and um,
the other thing is basically on,
on politics,
like,

2049
02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:18.410
you know,
there's this old line in politics like everybody dies a Republican,

2050
02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:23.780
you know,
cause like as you get older and you have something to conserve,

2051
02:02:23.781 --> 02:02:26.240
you become more conservative.
I found myself going actually the opposite,

2052
02:02:26.241 --> 02:02:29.420
the opposite direction as I understand more about the more about the world.

2053
02:02:29.421 --> 02:02:32.660
But the point is a point of all that and assume positive intent is that I think

2054
02:02:32.850 --> 02:02:37.490
it goes to our politics right now is that a lot of times I don't,

2055
02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:41.120
you know,
I just think like your default,
you know this already,

2056
02:02:41.330 --> 02:02:44.600
our default settings are so important in any realm of our life.

2057
02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:49.010
And I think a lot of times if your default setting is that people have,

2058
02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:52.820
everybody you deal with has negative intent that's going to lead you down one

2059
02:02:53.210 --> 02:02:56.600
pathway.
There's no question about it.
And,
and I,
and here's the thing,

2060
02:02:57.500 --> 02:02:59.510
I don't think that's true.
I really,

2061
02:02:59.511 --> 02:03:03.530
my experience as a human being is that some people obviously have negative

2062
02:03:03.531 --> 02:03:07.790
intent,
but most people do not.
Most people actually have positive intent.

2063
02:03:07.970 --> 02:03:12.970
So my view is that if you assume positive intent on the part of others and let

2064
02:03:13.251 --> 02:03:14.450
them disprove that,

2065
02:03:14.750 --> 02:03:18.830
that's a better way to go than to assume negative intent and say,

2066
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:23.060
I'm going to assume that you have negative intent timferriss until you prove

2067
02:03:23.061 --> 02:03:25.880
that you actually have positive intent.
Um,

2068
02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:29.070
I think just doing the reverse during the reverses better,

2069
02:03:29.071 --> 02:03:32.420
it's like assume positive intent.
That's it.
I don't,
I'm not Pollyanna here.

2070
02:03:32.421 --> 02:03:35.600
I don't think everybody has positive then,
but I think most people do.

2071
02:03:35.630 --> 02:03:37.700
And if you just just make that your default setting,

2072
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:40.250
you're going to have better interactions with people.
You're gonna learn,

2073
02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:41.240
you're gonna learn a lot more.

2074
02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:47.230
<v 5>The default setting default state as you put it in this case,</v>

2075
02:03:47.650 --> 02:03:52.400
creates a completely different experience of reality.
Uh,

2076
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:55.750
it was a little bit whether it's guilty until proven innocent as you look at

2077
02:03:55.810 --> 02:03:58.390
everyone in anything around you or innocent till proven guilty.

2078
02:03:58.391 --> 02:04:02.050
And I remember you're talking about these one liners,
these shards that,

2079
02:04:02.110 --> 02:04:05.380
that stick in the mind.
I remember,
I can't,

2080
02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:09.130
I can't recall who said this to me,

2081
02:04:09.190 --> 02:04:12.250
but they said if you go out one day,

2082
02:04:12.251 --> 02:04:16.060
you walk around and you meet an asshole,

2083
02:04:16.450 --> 02:04:17.740
that person is an asshole.

2084
02:04:18.010 --> 02:04:21.790
If on the other hand you go out and everyone you meet is an asshole,

2085
02:04:21.820 --> 02:04:25.450
you're the asshole.
And it,

2086
02:04:25.540 --> 02:04:27.970
if you assume that everyone has negative intent,

2087
02:04:28.150 --> 02:04:31.040
you yourself become that which you loath.

2088
02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:33.300
<v 4>Boy,
that's a really good point</v>

2089
02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:38.280
<v 5>and a very good point.
I love that.
Assume positive.
Well,</v>

2090
02:04:38.710 --> 02:04:39.543
uh,

2091
02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:41.260
<v 4>how's up?
It's on a billboard.
It does.</v>

2092
02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.830
I was actually taking that thing very literally.

2093
02:04:43.831 --> 02:04:47.130
It was like I literally picturing in my head like what would be,
what could,

2094
02:04:47.190 --> 02:04:50.460
what could,
what could fit on a,
what could,
what could fit on a billboard.

2095
02:04:51.470 --> 02:04:55.580
<v 5>Well,
I think that's,
I think that's a great place to wrap.
Uh,</v>

2096
02:04:55.670 --> 02:04:58.430
I mentioned a few things at the top of the show,
Dan,

2097
02:04:58.431 --> 02:05:02.870
pink.com at Daniel Pink on Twitter,
Facebook,
Daniel h pink.

2098
02:05:03.380 --> 02:05:08.380
Is there anything else that you would like to mention as closing comments and

2099
02:05:08.741 --> 02:05:11.870
requests and ask of the audience?
Anything else you would like to say?

2100
02:05:15.290 --> 02:05:16.120
No.
I mean we,

2101
02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:20.200
<v 4>you've covered a lot.
We've covered a lot of ground and you know,</v>

2102
02:05:20.201 --> 02:05:24.860
if people have listened this far,
God bless him.
I mean,
I can't,
I that's,

2103
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:27.120
I even,
I'm not that in grateful,
uh,

2104
02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:29.860
to ask for something more after this kind of indulgence.

2105
02:05:31.490 --> 02:05:36.290
<v 5>Well,
I,
I'm a big fan of your work.
I haven't been for a very long time and I,</v>

2106
02:05:36.380 --> 02:05:40.790
including Johnny Bunko,
which I still have to this day.

2107
02:05:40.791 --> 02:05:43.610
So you may recall ages ago,
lifetimes ago,

2108
02:05:43.611 --> 02:05:45.260
I think it was at south by southwest actually,

2109
02:05:45.261 --> 02:05:49.150
which is timely since I now live in Austin,
Texas.
You inscribed,
uh,

2110
02:05:49.250 --> 02:05:53.060
you signed a copy of that book for me,
which I still have.
I've carried it with,

2111
02:05:53.420 --> 02:05:57.170
I remember where we were sitting.
Yeah,
I do.

2112
02:05:57.200 --> 02:06:02.200
So I appreciate it and I still have the book and it's really been nice to

2113
02:06:02.811 --> 02:06:06.890
reconnect and catch up a bit.
Uh,
yeah.
Yeah,
it's been fun to,
you know,

2114
02:06:06.891 --> 02:06:07.480
obviously it's good

2115
02:06:07.480 --> 02:06:09.820
<v 4>fun to watch,
uh,
all the great things that,</v>

2116
02:06:09.880 --> 02:06:11.720
all the great things that you're doing and just how this,

2117
02:06:11.770 --> 02:06:16.330
this massive audience that you built in this,
you know,
I've gotten so much,

2118
02:06:16.331 --> 02:06:19.510
I have my dog eared.
I,
you know,
it's too bad we're not on video,

2119
02:06:19.511 --> 02:06:23.020
but I could show you my dog eared copy of,
um,
tools of titans,

2120
02:06:24.600 --> 02:06:27.810
<v 5>which is a,
would you,
they,
which is a great book title by the way,</v>

2121
02:06:28.820 --> 02:06:32.190
is the only book title that came easily and is the oil one.

2122
02:06:32.220 --> 02:06:36.180
All the other ones were agonizing,
agonizing,

2123
02:06:36.181 --> 02:06:41.181
agonizing sessions of brainstorming and picking one the of the titles among many

2124
02:06:44.041 --> 02:06:48.370
that I felt dissatisfied with,
tools of titans for whatever reason,
uh,

2125
02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:51.630
thanks to the universe or whatever powers that may be or,

2126
02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:55.570
or a reluctant may have happened upon me,
but that,

2127
02:06:55.571 --> 02:06:57.570
that is one that just kind of came and I was like,
oh yeah,
no,
that's,

2128
02:06:57.600 --> 02:06:59.350
that's the title.
And that was it.
I didn't,

2129
02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:01.440
I also didn't realize that you were in Austin.

2130
02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:05.150
How did you end up in Austin or why did you end up,
uh,
I,

2131
02:07:05.370 --> 02:07:09.390
I have felt a gravitational pull to Austin for a very long time.

2132
02:07:09.391 --> 02:07:12.060
I in fact wanted to move here right out of college,

2133
02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:17.420
but I didn't get the job at trilogy software that it made it to a final round of

2134
02:07:17.731 --> 02:07:21.960
interviews,
which brought me out to Austin,
really fell in love with the town.
Uh,

2135
02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:22.201
the,

2136
02:07:22.201 --> 02:07:27.201
the baseline of friendliness and warmth here of neighborly feel is higher than

2137
02:07:28.291 --> 02:07:30.390
just about any other place I've experienced.

2138
02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:35.620
And then instead of getting a job here,
he got a job in the bay area,

2139
02:07:35.621 --> 02:07:40.240
which took me to San Jose and mountain view and San Francisco for the better

2140
02:07:40.241 --> 02:07:44.530
part of nearly 20 years,
which I loved for that period of time.

2141
02:07:44.531 --> 02:07:46.270
But much like with books,

2142
02:07:46.300 --> 02:07:50.860
I think that you visit places and your experience of those places changes over

2143
02:07:50.861 --> 02:07:51.694
time.
And what,

2144
02:07:51.730 --> 02:07:56.730
what attracted me to the bay area I think has,

2145
02:07:56.860 --> 02:07:57.551
uh,
has,

2146
02:07:57.551 --> 02:08:02.551
has morphed into something else and I have also morphed into someone else.

2147
02:08:02.950 --> 02:08:04.190
And it felt good.

2148
02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:09.130
It felt like I felt like a good time for me to experiment with a new location.

2149
02:08:09.131 --> 02:08:09.581
Also,

2150
02:08:09.581 --> 02:08:14.581
I found myself within the very almost inescapable conversation of tech to,

2151
02:08:17.560 --> 02:08:18.010
uh,

2152
02:08:18.010 --> 02:08:23.010
be just drinking the Koolaid a little too heavily or repeated or believing my

2153
02:08:23.771 --> 02:08:26.560
own bullshit.
Maybe not,
not necessarily bullshit,

2154
02:08:26.590 --> 02:08:30.700
but getting caught up in a lot of platitudes that are thrown around so often in

2155
02:08:30.701 --> 02:08:34.240
silicon valley to have become part of the daily vernacular.

2156
02:08:34.241 --> 02:08:37.150
And that scared me quite frankly,
that I was like,
wait a second.

2157
02:08:37.151 --> 02:08:39.100
If I look back at the last five to six months,

2158
02:08:39.610 --> 02:08:44.000
how many conversations have I had that don't include the following 12 words or

2159
02:08:44.020 --> 02:08:47.680
four 12 expressions.
Oh yeah.
It was like,
wow,
I can actually count them on,

2160
02:08:47.890 --> 02:08:52.810
on both hands thing.
Interesting.
And uh,
what did you grow up?

2161
02:08:53.110 --> 02:08:57.660
I grew up at the very end of Long Island and uh,

2162
02:08:57.670 --> 02:09:01.690
was born a townie in the Hamptons,
which is a very odd thing

2163
02:09:03.310 --> 02:09:06.400
for anyone.
For anyone who's seen the affair.
I have not,

2164
02:09:06.401 --> 02:09:10.720
but I've heard that the affair,
this TV show that is apparently quite popular,

2165
02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:14.080
a lot of it takes place in this restaurant called the lobster roll,

2166
02:09:14.140 --> 02:09:18.910
which is in Montauk and I used to be a busboy at oh wow.

2167
02:09:19.180 --> 02:09:23.760
Nice.
Yeah.
So Long Island is,
is,
is where this,
this,

2168
02:09:23.761 --> 02:09:27.460
I do this whole weirdly,
I remember from

2169
02:09:29.810 --> 02:09:31.840
<v 4>four hour work week.
I think that,</v>

2170
02:09:32.430 --> 02:09:32.810
<v 0>okay.</v>

2171
02:09:32.810 --> 02:09:37.640
<v 4>You described yourself as a hellion.
Hell again,
a little hellion,</v>

2172
02:09:37.641 --> 02:09:42.440
good memory,
which is a great word.
I was just such a great word.
Yeah.
But I,

2173
02:09:42.530 --> 02:09:47.330
but I realized I didn't have any geographic sense of where you,
uh,
where you,

2174
02:09:47.660 --> 02:09:48.440
where you grew up.

2175
02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:49.221
<v 5>Yeah.
That's interesting.</v>

2176
02:09:49.221 --> 02:09:53.570
I think the use of [inaudible] is actually in the dedication to my parents and

2177
02:09:53.571 --> 02:09:55.860
my,
yeah.
Think that's right.
I think that's right.
You know why?

2178
02:09:56.090 --> 02:09:59.680
<v 4>One reason I remember that is that I listened to part,
uh,
uh,</v>

2179
02:09:59.690 --> 02:10:02.900
I got part of that book on audio book.
Um,

2180
02:10:02.990 --> 02:10:05.840
and I remember at the Biggie because you read that book,
I'm almost certain,
yeah,

2181
02:10:05.900 --> 02:10:07.600
it was ray porter who

2182
02:10:08.130 --> 02:10:10.770
<v 5>has,
has a voice that is easily</v>

2183
02:10:12.690 --> 02:10:14.250
mistaken for my,

2184
02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:18.840
my various mannerisms that I've developed now via podcasts.

2185
02:10:20.050 --> 02:10:22.020
So that was,
that was ray porter.
He did a great job.

2186
02:10:22.390 --> 02:10:24.550
<v 4>Oh yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I'm pretty sure that I,</v>

2187
02:10:24.660 --> 02:10:27.850
but I know it's just a great word.
It is a good word.
It is a good word.

2188
02:10:28.030 --> 02:10:30.410
It's great.
And,
uh,

2189
02:10:30.910 --> 02:10:33.040
I'm going to try to use it in the next 24 hours when I have,

2190
02:10:33.110 --> 02:10:34.010
when I come up with a good,
when

2191
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:35.200
<v 5>I hear a good word I try to use,</v>

2192
02:10:35.230 --> 02:10:40.230
I try to drop it in the next 24 hours just because it helps to reinforce it for

2193
02:10:40.311 --> 02:10:40.821
me.
Well,

2194
02:10:40.821 --> 02:10:45.110
I'm going to try to use surrogation and I'm going to try to eat more horrible

2195
02:10:45.111 --> 02:10:49.070
the eggs and the next 24 hours.
Uh,
you're,
you're golden.
It,

2196
02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:53.750
your life will change markedly if you start employing the principles surrogation

2197
02:10:53.930 --> 02:10:57.340
while eating our build eggs,
everything will,
you're there.
Every,

2198
02:10:57.350 --> 02:11:00.280
the sun will come shining up and the sun will,
will,

2199
02:11:00.281 --> 02:11:04.160
will burst out from behind the clouds and unit unicorns will scamper across your

2200
02:11:04.161 --> 02:11:08.970
front lawn.
Well,
my,
my dog will love that.
And uh,

2201
02:11:09.590 --> 02:11:12.650
then this has been,
this has been a lot of fun.
Thank you for having me.

2202
02:11:12.651 --> 02:11:15.830
I appreciate it.
It was a lot of really interesting and for everybody listening,

2203
02:11:15.831 --> 02:11:20.270
as always,
you can find links to everything and including,
uh,

2204
02:11:20.330 --> 02:11:23.540
dance,
social website,
the new book when,

2205
02:11:23.630 --> 02:11:28.610
and a much more in the show notes,
which you can find@tim.blog slash,

2206
02:11:28.670 --> 02:11:32.060
podcast.
And until next time,
thanks for listening.

2207
02:11:33.410 --> 02:11:36.800
<v 6>Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

2208
02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:39.740
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

2209
02:11:40.100 --> 02:11:43.040
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2210
02:11:43.070 --> 02:11:47.210
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

2211
02:11:47.211 --> 02:11:49.430
little more soul of fun before the weekend?

2212
02:11:49.490 --> 02:11:53.810
And five bullet Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things

2213
02:11:53.811 --> 02:11:56.390
I've found or that I've been pondering over the week.

2214
02:11:56.630 --> 02:11:59.390
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

2215
02:11:59.391 --> 02:12:02.870
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2216
02:12:02.871 --> 02:12:07.190
somehow dug up in the,
uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

2217
02:12:07.460 --> 02:12:12.460
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

2218
02:12:13.130 --> 02:12:15.830
close friends,
for instance.
And it's very short.

2219
02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:20.900
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

2220
02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:23.150
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

2221
02:12:23.420 --> 02:12:26.630
Just go to four hour workweek.com that's four hour work,

2222
02:12:26.631 --> 02:12:30.770
week.com all spelled out and just drop in your email and you'll get the very

2223
02:12:30.771 --> 02:12:33.320
next one.
And if you sign up,
I hope you enjoy it.

2224
02:12:34.700 --> 02:12:38.000
This episode is brought to you by we work.
I love,
we work.

2225
02:12:38.150 --> 02:12:41.810
I haven't had an office in many,
many,
many,
many,

2226
02:12:41.811 --> 02:12:46.700
many years since 2000 or so when I had my last real job,

2227
02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:48.080
I suppose in quotation marks,

2228
02:12:48.380 --> 02:12:52.650
but when I moved from San Francisco to Austin not long ago,
I decided to do,

2229
02:12:52.651 --> 02:12:55.290
you know what?
I'm tired of working at home.
I'm tired of,

2230
02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:56.450
we're going to coffee shops.

2231
02:12:56.870 --> 02:13:01.010
So one of the very first things I did was to get a space that we work.

2232
02:13:01.070 --> 02:13:03.770
I could not be happier with this change in my life.

2233
02:13:04.220 --> 02:13:08.380
We work is a global network of workspaces where companies and people grow

2234
02:13:08.510 --> 02:13:08.960
together.

2235
02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:13.460
The idea is really so you focus on your business and we work takes care of all

2236
02:13:13.461 --> 02:13:17.440
the rest including front desk service,
utilities,
refreshments,

2237
02:13:17.530 --> 02:13:22.530
and I also often have been shipped from Amazon and elsewhere to my office that

2238
02:13:22.731 --> 02:13:24.170
we weren't,
you're in Austin.

2239
02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:28.460
I've been completely blown away by the members only events,

2240
02:13:28.461 --> 02:13:33.461
special offers and perhaps the best brew coffee on tap than I've ever had.

2241
02:13:34.140 --> 02:13:36.060
It's been amazing.
It's been a real,

2242
02:13:36.061 --> 02:13:40.740
real change in my life and improved my quality of life and there are also dog

2243
02:13:40.741 --> 02:13:44.370
friendly.
We work locations all over the place.
How Fun is that?

2244
02:13:44.730 --> 02:13:48.840
We work caters to everyone from entrepreneurs and freelancers to start ups and

2245
02:13:48.841 --> 02:13:53.820
even large enterprises including Ge,
salesforce,
Microsoft,
mastercard,
Samsung,

2246
02:13:53.850 --> 02:13:57.870
Spotify,
Pinterest and red bull among many others.
In fact,

2247
02:13:58.380 --> 02:14:03.380
more than 10% of fortune 500 companies currently use work and it's a rapidly

2248
02:14:03.751 --> 02:14:04.680
growing group.
In other words,

2249
02:14:04.980 --> 02:14:09.330
it's not just solo printers and to ground level startups that loose we worked

2250
02:14:09.331 --> 02:14:09.440
with,

2251
02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:14.440
but everything from that to the big companies who are seeing very huge benefits

2252
02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:16.313
as well.

2253
02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:19.560
We work believes that creating spaces where people can connect and create

2254
02:14:19.561 --> 02:14:21.870
meaning together,
right after all,

2255
02:14:22.170 --> 02:14:26.070
if you are someone who's built a business model on the principles and the four

2256
02:14:26.071 --> 02:14:28.470
hour workweek or elsewhere,
it can be a lonely road.

2257
02:14:28.471 --> 02:14:31.890
Sometimes even though you're digitally connected,
it can feel very,
very isolated.

2258
02:14:32.490 --> 02:14:36.640
So in these spaces you could connect with real humans and uh,

2259
02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:40.680
all the while you space more efficiently and cost effectively,

2260
02:14:40.681 --> 02:14:44.370
which makes you and your business better equipped to face the challenges of

2261
02:14:44.371 --> 02:14:48.240
today.
Tomorrow we work now has more than 200 locations,

2262
02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:51.330
so you can find great spots all over the world.

2263
02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:56.540
So head over to [inaudible] dot co slash Tim that's [inaudible] Dot Cosio

2264

2265
02:15:01.950 --> 02:15:03.030
At the very least.

2266
02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:06.480
I encourage you to check out pictures of some of the locations around the world.

2267
02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:09.690
There are some incredible spots.
So check it out.

2268
02:15:09.900 --> 02:15:14.900
[inaudible] dot co slash Tim this episode is brought to you by four sigmatic.

2269
02:15:16.050 --> 02:15:18.870
You might remember four sigmatic for their mushroom coffee,

2270
02:15:18.930 --> 02:15:21.660
which was created by those clever finished founders.

2271
02:15:21.870 --> 02:15:24.450
And when I first mentioned that coffee on this podcast,

2272
02:15:24.850 --> 02:15:27.990
the product sold out in less than a week,
it lights you up like a Christmas tree,

2273
02:15:27.991 --> 02:15:30.510
which can be really useful.
However,

2274
02:15:30.810 --> 02:15:34.950
recently I've been testing the opposite side of the spectrum of new product and

2275
02:15:34.951 --> 02:15:39.750
that is their Reishi mushroom elixir to help me end my day to get to sleep.

2276
02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:42.690
As you guys may know,
longtime listeners,

2277
02:15:42.691 --> 02:15:46.350
at least I struggled with insomnia for decades.
I've a largely fixed that,

2278
02:15:46.380 --> 02:15:49.490
but still shutting off my monkey brain has never been easy.

2279
02:15:49.491 --> 02:15:52.200
It still isn't easy very often and I found Reishi,

2280
02:15:52.201 --> 02:15:55.620
which I've been fascinated by it for a few years now,
has been very,

2281
02:15:55.621 --> 02:15:59.520
very effective and calming their old formula.
However,

2282
02:15:59.521 --> 02:16:04.440
four sigmatic old formula included Stevia and I like to avoid sweeteners,

2283
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:09.470
all sweeteners for a host of reasons and I then just ping them and asked,

2284
02:16:10.710 --> 02:16:14.970
hey guys,
I would love to experiment with this and maybe actually suggested,

2285
02:16:15.060 --> 02:16:18.390
but I'd like a version without sweeteners if you'd be open to it,

2286
02:16:18.510 --> 02:16:19.680
if too much of a headache,
don't worry.

2287
02:16:20.130 --> 02:16:23.850
And they are always game for experimentation.

2288
02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:27.540
So they created a special custom version without the Stevie,
without sweeteners.

2289
02:16:27.870 --> 02:16:30.070
Now it is part of my nightly routine.

2290
02:16:30.610 --> 02:16:33.250
Their ratio elixir comes in single serving packets,

2291
02:16:33.251 --> 02:16:36.190
which are perfect for travel and in fact I'm about to leave the country right

2292
02:16:36.191 --> 02:16:40.030
now and I have a packet in front of me that's just going to sit in the end of my

2293
02:16:40.031 --> 02:16:44.560
carry on bag.
You only need hot water and it mixes very,

2294
02:16:44.561 --> 02:16:45.394
very easily.

2295
02:16:45.790 --> 02:16:49.990
Here's some recommended copies that they put in the read,

2296
02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:52.980
so I'm going to read it and I'll give you my take quote,

2297
02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:55.300
a warning for those in the experimental mindset,

2298
02:16:55.420 --> 02:16:58.840
Reishi is strong and bitter and parentheses like any great medicine.

2299
02:16:59.050 --> 02:17:00.400
So if the bitterness is too much,

2300
02:17:00.401 --> 02:17:04.770
I recommend trying it with honey end or nut milk such as almond milk and quote.

2301
02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:06.880
So I'm going to say no,

2302
02:17:06.940 --> 02:17:11.380
you should suck it up and you should drink the tea because it's not that bitter.

2303
02:17:11.830 --> 02:17:15.640
And maybe should take the advice of all Chinese people when they're criticizing

2304
02:17:15.641 --> 02:17:18.140
young ins when they say,
well,
I'm sure cool,

2305
02:17:18.190 --> 02:17:20.560
which means you're not able to eat bitterness.

2306
02:17:20.680 --> 02:17:25.680
Bitter is in many cases and indication of things that help liver detoxification.

2307
02:17:26.321 --> 02:17:28.510
It's on,
not saying that's the case here,

2308
02:17:28.511 --> 02:17:33.280
but I've tested this ratio lecture on family members,

2309
02:17:33.310 --> 02:17:35.740
on friends,
everybody has liked it.
It's a little bit,
or if the,

2310
02:17:35.741 --> 02:17:39.580
it's not that hard.
So I would just say suck it up and no,

2311
02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:43.750
don't put in honey or milk or any of that shit.
Just drink the goddamn tea.

2312
02:17:43.751 --> 02:17:46.840
It's delicious I think.
Right?
If you like poo air,
that kind of stuff,

2313
02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:50.410
that type of tea,
you're going to dig it.
So just try it.
Okay.

2314
02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:54.400
Back to them by read.
If you'd like to naturally improve your sleep,

2315
02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:56.440
both onset and quality,

2316
02:17:56.441 --> 02:18:01.441
