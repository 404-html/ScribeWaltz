1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.880
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:06.090
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:09.670
Now

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.350
I'm a cybernetic organism living this year.

5
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.920
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by Peloton and I'd heard about Peloton over and</v>

6
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:29.730
over again,

7
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.650
but I ended up getting a Peloton bike in the whole system after I saw my buddy

8
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.770
Kevin Rose,
I've known him forever,
some of you know,

9
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.830
and he showed up at my gate at my house a while back and he looked fantastic.

10
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.070
I asked him,
I said,
dude,
you look great.
What the hell have you been up to?

11
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.190
Because he's always doing a weird diet or another,

12
00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:51.750
but it only lasts like a week or two.

13
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.590
So he always regresses to the mean after like 75 beers.
And he said,

14
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:58.140
I've been doing Peloton five days a week now.

15
00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:02.820
That caught my attention because Kevin does nothing five days a week and you

16
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:06.090
know,
I love you Kevin.
But it really peaked my curiosity,

17
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.150
ended up getting a system and it's become an integral part of my week.

18
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.020
I love it and I really didn't expect to love it at all because I find cycling

19
00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:17.700
really boring usually,

20
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.710
but peloton is an indoor cycling bike that brings live studio classes right into

21
00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:23.544
your home.

22
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.190
You know if worry about fitting classes into your schedule or making it to a

23
00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:28.170
studio with some type of commute,

24
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.700
etc. New classes are added every day and this includes options led by elite New

25
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.170
York City instructors in your own living room.

26
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.190
You can even livestream studio classes taught by the world's best instructors or

27
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:41.220
find your own favorite class on demand and in fact,

28
00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:45.450
Kevin and I rarely do live classes and you can compete with your friends,

29
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.040
which is also fun.
Kevin,

30
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:51.240
I'm coming after you but we usually just use classes on demand.

31
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.800
I really like Matt Wilbur's and his iron,

32
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.820
high intensity training sessions that are shorter,

33
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.850
like 20 minutes and I think Kevin's favorite is Alex and everyone seems to have

34
00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:07.020
their favorite instructor or you can select by music duration and so on.

35
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.030
Each Peloton bike includes a 22 inch HD touchscreen performance tracking

36
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:12.541
metrics.

37
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:16.830
I think that that along with the real time leaderboard are the main reasons that

38
00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:21.510
this caught my attention when cycling never had caught my attention before.

39
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.020
It's really pretty stunning what they've done with the user interface to keep

40
00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:25.854
your attention.

41
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.940
The belt drive is quiet and it's smaller than you would expect so it can fit in

42
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:33.930
a living room or an office.
I actually have it in a large closet,

43
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:37.320
believe it or not and it fits with no problem.

44
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.330
So peloton is offering all of you guys,
listeners of the Tim Ferriss show,

45
00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:47.331
a special offer and it is actually special visit one Peloton that's o n e p e l

48
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.180
You might say man accessories,
wait,

49
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:05.800
I don't need fancy towels or whatever other supplemental bits and pieces.

50
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.400
No,
the shoes you need,
you need the clip in shoes.

51
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:11.050
And those are in the accessory category.

52
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:14.950

61
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.390
<v 2>Okay.</v>

62
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.230
<v 1>This episode is sponsored by Sotheby's and Sotheby's wine,</v>

63
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.190
which offers a selection of the world's best wines for every pallet and
occasion.

64
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.910
Many of you know I do like my wine.
I do love wine.

65
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.510
Must be the Malbec from Argentina when I was down there,

66
00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:09.570
or maybe it's a Zinfandel from California,
but I like it all.

67
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.610
I like lots and lots of wine.
Southerby's,
as many of you may know,

68
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.090
is a global auctioneer.
They auction off many,
many,

69
00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.350
many different types of things.

70
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.790
There are also a retailer of fine wine with locations in New York,
London,

71
00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:24.840
and Hong Kong.

72
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.290
The recently created an online store where you can buy wine directly.

73
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.050
You might think,
well that's for millionaires and billionaires.

74
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.190
I don't go to auction houses,

75
00:04:32.191 --> 00:04:37.191
but the wines that they sell range from $14 per bottle all the way up to 25,000

76
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.370
let's say Sotheby's allows you to sort it by region,

77
00:04:41.371 --> 00:04:44.910
great producer or you can search for a particular bottle or by your budget,

78
00:04:44.911 --> 00:04:48.060
which is probably where I would go if you're gifting wine southeast,

79
00:04:48.061 --> 00:04:52.110
suggest champagne,
red Bordeaux,
burgundy or Californian wines.

80
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.930
And if you want my opinion,
I would say,
you know,
tries Zinfandel.

81
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.080
If you haven't tried to Zinfandel from California,
but in any case,

82
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.160
just one restriction at this time a Sotheby's can only ship to New York,

83
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.760
California,
DC,
New Hampshire and Idaho.

84
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.670
So I'll say that one more time and I'll put it a different way.

85
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.930
If you are in or shipping to New York,
California,
DC,

86
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.280
New Hampshire or Idaho,

87
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.370
check it out because that's where the wine can currently be shipped.

88
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.060
So visit Sotheby's wine.com that's s o t h e B y s Sotheby's wine.com and use

89

92
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.403
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

93
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.730
<v 1>Why?
Hello there and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.</v>

94
00:05:46.731 --> 00:05:51.680
This is Tim Ferriss and it is typically my job to share the habits and routines

95
00:05:51.681 --> 00:05:55.130
of world class performers of all different types as well as try to spot the

96
00:05:55.131 --> 00:06:00.131
patterns amongst them and talk that this episode is a rare exception to the rule

97
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.020
and unlike my usual long form interviews,

98
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.890
this is a drunk dialing Q and a with you guys,
my listeners.

99
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.770
So what does that mean?
I've done this a few times in the past,

100
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.910
including for the celebration of the hundredth episode of this podcast.

101
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.670
We're at more than 300 now,
so it's been awhile and here's how it works.

102
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.440
In preparation for this episode.

103
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.920
I went on the social media and a point people to a Google form where they could

104
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.950
input their phone numbers and so on and those people,

105
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:30.260
our listeners wanted to receive a call from me.
Then I said,
hey,

106
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:34.340
from this time to this time I'm going to be making phone calls and I started

107
00:06:34.341 --> 00:06:35.540
drinking in dialing,

108
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.550
answering your questions and getting a little frisky along the way.
Tequila,

109
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.940
we'll do that and we covered a lot in this episode.

110
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:48.050
I cover all sorts of things including how Jocko Willink has made me more

111
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:48.884
disciplined.

112
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.060
My thoughts on sex as a doorway to higher perception.

113
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.090
That was not a topic I expect to get into.
And uh,

114
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.720
you name it,
we cover it.

115
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.810
I talk about a past addiction to stimulants that I've had and how I've weaned

116
00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:10.370
myself off of said stimulants or at least prioritized abstinence from
stimulants.

117
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.480
How I determine if a project is working or not put another way,

118
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:17.840
how do I decide when I should persevere,
were quit a project,

119
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.810
stop something and move on.
And after all,

120
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.820
the fastest way to complete something is to leave it undone forever.
Uh,

121
00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:30.620
so that is one topic that we dig into,
how I think about teaching and much,

122
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.250
much more.
So I'll leave it at that.
Without further ado,

123
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:39.280
please enjoy this Tequila fueled Q and a with you guys and thanks for being

124
00:07:39.591 --> 00:07:40.760
game.
Here we go.

125
00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:47.460
<v 3>Hello.
Hi,
is this Brendan?
Is this Tim Ferris?</v>

126
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.080
It is Tim Ferriss.
Good evening.
Why?
Oh my goodness.

127
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:58.120
Oh Man.
Where am I?
Where am I finding,
I'm doing great.
Where are you right now?

128
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.390
<v 4>Probably about three hours north of weight I assume you want,
I'm in Dallas,</v>

129
00:08:03.391 --> 00:08:04.000
Texas.

130
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.670
<v 1>Oh,
nice.
It's fine.
Towns.
I find town Dallas.
Okay.</v>

131
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.700
<v 4>Yeah.
Have you been through here march or no,</v>

132
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:13.590
<v 1>I've been here.
I've been here,
I've been there.
That's the alcohol talking.</v>

133
00:08:13.591 --> 00:08:17.880
Excuse me.
I have been there a handful of times as well as fort worth,

134
00:08:17.881 --> 00:08:22.620
but I've always spent more time in the Austin area.
Uh,
so,
uh,

135
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.260
<v 4>understandably so.
It's,
it's,
it's a fine,
fine community.</v>

136
00:08:26.261 --> 00:08:27.640
I was just actually down there yesterday.

137
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.460
<v 3>Very nice.
For south by or what were you down here for him?</v>

138
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:36.320
<v 4>I just went down to go to the academy and then to get a little workout in and</v>

139
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:38.270
synchronize synchronistically enough.

140
00:08:38.271 --> 00:08:40.280
You really set podcasts with Abi this yesterday.

141
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:46.450
<v 3>I listen to that on the tie back.
It's a great gym.
So I tell you what,</v>

142
00:08:46.451 --> 00:08:51.340
I've got a bunch of phone calls to make a bunch of booze to drink.
So how can I,

143
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.690
how can I attempt to help?
What type of questions might I

144
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:56.843
<v 1>take a stab at?</v>

145
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.020
<v 4>Good,
good,
good question because I know you collect them.</v>

146
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:03.660
So I actually took a little bit of time once I saw that sweets,

147
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.330
I was expecting this phone call.
So,
um,

148
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.930
an easy one that I just wanted to ask because it's been one of the biggest

149
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:13.020
things that you felt me with of all the people that you've introduced me to.

150
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.480
So all your worth is juggle willing.

151
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.660
So I wanted to know just from your perspective,

152
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:21.960
has having him around in your life made you more discipline?

153
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.920
<v 1>That is a fine question.
Yes.
So having Jocko</v>

154
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.790
in my life,
which I will say is also virtual,
even though I know Jocko very well,

155
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.890
I just spoke to him yesterday on the phone.

156
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.690
But simply knowing that Jocko exists in the universe,

157
00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:42.693
uh,

158
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:48.220
makes me feel like I have a very benevolent yet strict a guardian angel who will

159
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.430
most certainly give me an occasional pat on the back,

160
00:09:55.431 --> 00:09:59.000
but more often a kick in the ass to actually do it.
What needs being done?

161
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.720
So Jocko I think exemplifies,
for me at least

162
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:09.220
the importance of deciding to embody a given attribute as a means to developing

163
00:10:12.621 --> 00:10:13.171
that attribute.

164
00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:16.790
So of course Jocko is well known for saying if you want to be tougher,

165
00:10:16.791 --> 00:10:21.410
be tougher,
simply meeting in that context that if you want to be tougher,

166
00:10:21.411 --> 00:10:23.930
it's not a six month plan,
it's not a two year plan,

167
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.960
it's not a progression.
It is.

168
00:10:26.961 --> 00:10:31.850
Do I choose the stairs instead of the elevator when I get up from this table and

169
00:10:31.851 --> 00:10:36.070
I need to go to another floor?
And it can be a small decision,

170
00:10:36.071 --> 00:10:37.100
it can be a big decision,

171
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:41.480
but you want to immediately start making decisions that reflect the

172
00:10:41.481 --> 00:10:42.920
characteristic you want to develop.

173
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.910
And that that I think is very powerful and also quite frankly,

174
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:52.330
the simplicity of Jockos approach to many things including physical fitness and

175
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.660
training it which

176
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.270
<v 4>after listening to your podcast and</v>

177
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.770
stuff we put together.
But like,
you know,

178
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:09.030
difficult to execute with correct form and like advocate in that public cadence

179
00:11:09.031 --> 00:11:13.920
and everything like that is principal simple from

180
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:19.230
extreme ownership.
You know,
it's like just don't overcomplicate things.

181
00:11:19.231 --> 00:11:23.100
And I think that in a way simplicity is like expression on elegance.

182
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.100
<v 1>It is absolutely.</v>

183
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:30.190
And also the fact that Jocko does not accept excuses in his own life and

184
00:11:32.871 --> 00:11:36.860
certainly doesn't accept them from other people.
And as one example,

185
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.750
he,
if he's traveling and you know this from having read the last book,

186
00:11:41.751 --> 00:11:45.210
but if he's traveling and he wants to do pull ups and he doesn't have any pullup

187
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:50.210
bar nearby,
let's say in a hotel,
he will take a towel,
go to the parking garage,

188
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.320
find something from which you can hang using the towel,

189
00:11:54.321 --> 00:11:59.320
like throw it over a bar or something like that and he'll pull up.
Exactly right.

190
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:03.030
So,
uh,
in those,
for those of you who don't have the context,

191
00:12:03.031 --> 00:12:08.031
Jocko Willink is a legendary former or I should say retired navy seal commander.

192
00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:12.010
He was in charge of one point of all west coast training for navy seal teams,

193
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.120
which are certainly realistic,
hyper realistic.
One might even call psychotic.

194
00:12:16.121 --> 00:12:21.121
He's a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu and can do last I heard 67 strict pull

195
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:25.210
ups at a body weight of somewhere between two 15 and two 30.

196
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:27.220
So the guy is an absolute animal,

197
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.780
<v 4>he's a monster.
And then I can just a mental monster too,
you know</v>

198
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:38.140
like the different kind of like inspiration and motivation.

199
00:12:38.141 --> 00:12:42.970
It's like a really like examine and look at yourself and like just be realistic

200
00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:47.380
about how many hours you're willing to put in the day.
A lot of people,
if they,

201
00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:51.870
if they could be night owls and they might stay up til four 30 or you know,

202
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.960
so long as you're putting in work between midnight and 6:00 AM at some point

203
00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:00.430
you're still ahead of most people are before you go to sleep or right when you

204
00:13:00.431 --> 00:13:01.264
get up.

205
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.430
<v 1>Yup.</v>

206
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:07.430
So if you want to also see the most hilarious a Twitter Q and A's imaginable,

207
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:12.190
you can follow Jocko Jocko Willink on Twitter.
Okay.
So enough enough Jocko Jocko.

208
00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:12.840
But

209
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.870
<v 4>yeah,
I know,
I know.
I didn't want to just call again,</v>

210
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.130
but we've been one of the most,

211
00:13:17.131 --> 00:13:19.910
he's in one of the most influential of all the people you've introduced me to

212
00:13:19.911 --> 00:13:22.470
this.
I see.
I just wanted to wrap up with one thing.
Do you remember,

213
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:26.080
<v 1>Oh,
you know what I should say,
I apologize.
Just to interrupt.</v>

214
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.840
I will say if people want to get to know Jocko,

215
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:33.220
the very first interview he ever did publicly,
it was on my podcast.

216
00:13:33.221 --> 00:13:36.250
So you can just go to tim.blog forward slash Jocko.
And

217
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:43.430
<v 4>what's the video?
He came home and saw that just today or two days ago.</v>

218
00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:44.980
It's about the clock running out.

219
00:13:44.981 --> 00:13:47.810
Like people should check out his youtube channel.
It's like two,

220
00:13:47.811 --> 00:13:49.430
two and a half minutes or something.
It's amazing.

221
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:50.260
<v 1>Yup.</v>

222
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:55.260
So I've helped to create or I'd rather just really unleashed on the internet and

223
00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.410
a monster notice Jocko Willink.
So enjoy.
Okay.
So what's next?

224
00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:03.920
<v 4>Um,
one quick one.
What do you,
are you drinking all day?
What do you having?</v>

225
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:09.260
<v 1>I am drinking Casa that are going is sipping Tequila in this case 100% Butoh</v>

226
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:14.960
Algavia made and um,
it's,

227
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:19.950
it's from some McGill Dan day and it is Nikila Blanco.

228
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.310
It's nice stuff.

229
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:30.690
<v 4>Cool.
The last question is I like I see we met,
did you,</v>

230
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:35.870
do you remember that it was a club.
I got this la you did your,

231
00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:39.500
you did like a like,
like basically like a meet and greet.

232
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:42.320
I remember cross campus.
Yeah,

233
00:14:42.321 --> 00:14:47.321
so I flew up from Dallas actually that time and got to kind of interact with you

234
00:14:47.511 --> 00:14:48.344
a little bit.

235
00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:51.680
<v 1>I think I met you in this hallway space.</v>

236
00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:56.150
It was by the way in the back of the room behind the main stage kind of on my

237
00:14:56.151 --> 00:14:58.790
way to get a drink and go to the bathroom.
I think I actually,

238
00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:01.790
you kind of stepped in front of a few people and I met you there if I remember

239
00:15:01.791 --> 00:15:02.880
correctly.
Yeah,

240
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.430
<v 4>I remember the very beginning of it like yeah please.</v>

241
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.640
Like I'm not taking startup pitches right now.

242
00:15:11.641 --> 00:15:13.560
And it was just like as soon as there was a break for coffee,

243
00:15:13.561 --> 00:15:16.740
like you have to go for the coffee and it was just like swarmed with people

244
00:15:16.741 --> 00:15:18.620
asking him about like,
oh when you check this product

245
00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.940
it looks like all these people and they were just swimming you.

246
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.080
I got a second to talk to you and I was just like,

247
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.900
I just want to say thank you and I still do want to say thank you today man.

248
00:15:27.901 --> 00:15:31.740
I'm really grateful for everything that you've really led me towards in my life.

249
00:15:31.741 --> 00:15:33.360
Like I basically,

250
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:37.380
you're like one of the best decision making or content filtering algorithms that

251
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.470
I was ever found because if you vet something,

252
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.100
it's already like so much of the legwork is done and I just trust you on like,

253
00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:48.780
you know,
you're driven for research and helping people.
So

254
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:53.930
<v 1>thank you Brandon
hopes and never betray that trust.</v>

255
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.651
I mean,
I do,

256
00:15:54.651 --> 00:15:59.651
I really work hard to not succumb to the temptation to loosen that filter.

257
00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:07.640
Uh,
it's,
it's very,
it can be very challenging.
It's very expensive.
Uh,

258
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.270
but I,
uh,

259
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:15.320
I know how valuable that is to me.
I have friends who act as filters,
certainly,

260
00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:17.940
and it's,
it's,

261
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:23.170
it's largely thanks to the value that I've derived from them that I want to try

262
00:16:23.391 --> 00:16:27.940
to serve the same function for people in the wider world,
uh,

263
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:32.980
that I can hopefully try a thousand things and a lot of bullshit and distill the

264
00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:38.730
two or three that are actually worth a second look.
Uh,
anyway,

265
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.890
<v 4>well,
thank you so much for calling.
I don't,</v>

266
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:44.870
I don't want to be respectful of everybody else on your list to talk to you for.

267
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:48.703
Thank you so much.

268
00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:52.210
<v 1>My pleasure man.
Any,
any requests for the podcast types of people,</v>

269
00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:54.730
specific people or anything else?

270
00:16:55.730 --> 00:17:00.730
<v 4>What I want to do after like having been introduced to your work in 2011 um,</v>

271
00:17:01.731 --> 00:17:02.750
I was basically,

272
00:17:02.751 --> 00:17:07.751
I grew up in hospitality and I was a chef from many of the last years and was

273
00:17:07.971 --> 00:17:12.940
just unable to kind of sustain like a healthy lifestyle and like,

274
00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.980
you know,
there's no such thing as work life balance if you're like a true chef,

275
00:17:15.981 --> 00:17:19.910
cooking real food,
like in a high pressure,
fine dining environment,

276
00:17:19.911 --> 00:17:22.110
like what everything's made from scratch.
Like it's just,

277
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:24.560
I know you know that from your research and you know,

278
00:17:24.561 --> 00:17:25.940
going through with the four hour chef,

279
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:30.320
but like it's a pretty widespread like unknown issue in the states right now

280
00:17:30.321 --> 00:17:32.510
that there's not enough skilled labor in kitchens.

281
00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:36.410
I'm not just kitchens or restaurants in general.
So I don't know.

282
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.370
I mean I want to make a difference in that industry on like a bigger scale.
So,

283
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:44.150
I mean I want to put together like a website and like have like a ton of ideas

284
00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:47.670
in the realm of trying to help people in that specific genre of,

285
00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.030
well I should say niche of like the workplace,

286
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.680
but because I have so much experience,

287
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:57.060
like I grew up in a restaurant when my mom was like,
you know,
uh,
raising me,

288
00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.870
I was basically,
I was in a restaurant.
So,
and then coming down to Dallas,
Texas,

289
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:03.840
like there's just so much opportunity down here and I got a real sense for the

290
00:18:03.841 --> 00:18:07.660
labor market and kind of did some research and it's not just the Dallas living

291
00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:07.921
it.

292
00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:11.790
I'm sure you know any body listening in any city right now that has anything to

293
00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:14.290
do with restaurants can attest to the fact that do,

294
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:18.600
it helps harder to find than ever because the market's oversaturated and it's

295
00:18:18.601 --> 00:18:22.110
easier to get loans to open restaurants and whatever the case may be,

296
00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:24.780
macro economically.
But I just want to make a difference.

297
00:18:24.781 --> 00:18:26.130
So if anybody's interested,

298
00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.660
they can catch me on Twitter at [inaudible] 27 or however you want to.

299
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.740
I just want to start a bigger conversation around this and put out content to

300
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.180
help people and restaurants.
So,

301
00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.380
<v 3>all right,
you're here.
Well,</v>

302
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:44.220
good luck and I'll see you on the internet maybe in Texas.
Oh,
absolutely.

303
00:18:44.221 --> 00:18:45.390
Yeah.
Yeah,
I know.

304
00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.000
<v 4>I thought the Dallas just hit me up and I'll probably show you some,</v>

305
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:49.890
some parts of the city that you,
I didn't see.

306
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:54.750
<v 3>All right man.
Well I will,
I'll see you on the road and take it easy.</v>

307
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.890
Bye.
Hello?
Uh,
hi.
Is this Diana?

308
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.130
Yeah,
this is a [inaudible].
I was hoping I would get the pronunciation right.

309
00:19:04.131 --> 00:19:06.230
This is Tim Ferriss.
Good evening.
How are you?

310
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:09.600
<v 5>Hello?
Hello.
I can't believe I made it.</v>

311
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:13.640
<v 3>You made it.
You were the second person to fill the form out.
So you were very,</v>

312
00:19:13.641 --> 00:19:18.020
very fast on the draw and awesome.
Thank you for coming.

313
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:22.640
My pleasure.
What question or questions can I ask a question to tackle for?
Well,

314
00:19:22.641 --> 00:19:25.790
I have a,
I have a couple I want you to choose.

315
00:19:25.791 --> 00:19:29.000
Do you want to ECU question?
Do you want a hard question?

316
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:34.340
I want whichever question that you'd be most disappointed not to have asked.

317
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:36.163
Okay.

318
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:37.740
<v 5>So,
um,</v>

319
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:43.490
my biggest interest right now is what states have higher perception.

320
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:47.580
Can we call TV through training?
All right.

321
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:52.610
And what's coming to me is sex because sex seems to be a doorway in some

322
00:19:55.411 --> 00:19:59.880
cultures or some philosophies.
Like I'm thinking Tantra,

323
00:19:59.881 --> 00:20:03.960
I'm thinking towers them.
I'm thinking Kama Sutra and you know,

324
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:08.520
so I've,
I've heard this,
I'm,
and I'm trying to put them together,
for example,

325
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.040
um,
abstaining from sex,

326
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:16.070
like you were talking to Jack Cornfield's or withholding orgasm as a training or

327
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:23.520
multiple partners and have relationships.
And that's how a lot of sick guys,

328
00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:28.950
so way off learning how to deal with your internal stuff.

329
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:32.550
So I'm curious to know,
what is your experience,

330
00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:37.730
if I can assume that you've experimented with all of this and what do you think?

331
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:40.860
Is that a doorway to higher perception,

332
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.830
either of these techniques or all of them or what,

333
00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:47.920
<v 3>what do you think?
Yeah,
big question.
Let me</v>

334
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.210
<v 1>try to take a stab at it.</v>

335
00:20:49.211 --> 00:20:53.530
So there are many different components to that question.
I would say that,

336
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.220
uh,
in general,

337
00:20:57.221 --> 00:21:02.221
my experience has been whenever you take an act or a daily habit,

338
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.800
let's just say such as eating and you make previously automatic or subconscious

339
00:21:13.061 --> 00:21:18.061
decisions conscious that you can very deliberately change perception and that

340
00:21:20.221 --> 00:21:24.010
that can lead many interesting places that could take the form of,

341
00:21:24.011 --> 00:21:25.060
and I will get to sex,

342
00:21:25.061 --> 00:21:29.710
but that could take the form of intermittent fasting or fasting,

343
00:21:29.711 --> 00:21:34.060
in which case you notice how much of your day is structured around three

344
00:21:34.061 --> 00:21:34.841
scheduled meals,

345
00:21:34.841 --> 00:21:39.841
whether or not you are hungry and that brings to you a new appreciation of your

346
00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.200
automatic behaviors that may or may not be justified.

347
00:21:47.201 --> 00:21:51.280
And secondly gives you a greater appreciation for,
in this case,

348
00:21:51.281 --> 00:21:53.590
the thing he may abstain from for a certain period of time,

349
00:21:53.591 --> 00:21:57.290
which is food and sex is very similar.
Uh,

350
00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.520
I do think that,
uh,

351
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.850
and I don't know if this is physiological or psychological,

352
00:22:03.851 --> 00:22:08.851
but I have engaged in a number of different practices and schools of training

353
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.273
where

354
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:18.640
the accepted best practices involve abstaining from sex.

355
00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:22.990
And furthermore,
abstaining from orgasm or ejaculation for a period of time,

356
00:22:22.991 --> 00:22:27.490
whether that is two weeks or four weeks or a longer period of time.

357
00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:33.040
And when you remove any compulsive behavior,

358
00:22:33.041 --> 00:22:34.870
and I will just go out on a limb and say,

359
00:22:34.871 --> 00:22:39.700
I think that masturbation for men in particular can be a compulsive,

360
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.943
uh,

361
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:46.300
behavior and tool for procrastination,

362
00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.070
uh,
to,
to put,
to put it mildly.
Women may be also,

363
00:22:51.071 --> 00:22:56.071
but I think particularly men and that when you remove that as an option and you

364
00:22:58.301 --> 00:23:01.210
have a,
for instance,

365
00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:06.240
a trip plan where you're going to be engaging in some type of physical practice

366
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:09.760
or exposure to psychedelics or whatever it might be.

367
00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:14.350
And it is clearly,
it has been clearly expressed to you that your,

368
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:19.950
your gains will be three x four x five x greater if you abstain from this

369
00:23:22.571 --> 00:23:24.730
behavior,
uh,

370
00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.570
that is the petri dish,
the,

371
00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:33.310
the period of abstinence that can allow you to observe how you react to that.

372
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.340
Right.
And,
uh,

373
00:23:36.341 --> 00:23:41.050
observing the impulses and the resistance that surfaces,

374
00:23:41.051 --> 00:23:42.740
I think is really valuable.
Uh,

375
00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:47.910
so I do think that whether or not there is some type of physiological basis to

376
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.670
the regeneration of re circulation of chief,
for instance,

377
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.820
which may or may not be the case.
Right.
I'm very,

378
00:23:55.821 --> 00:24:00.680
very skeptical of a lot of this new age.
We will stuff,
even though I've read,

379
00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.920
you know,
the,
I believe it's the multiorgasmic man Mantak Chia,

380
00:24:03.921 --> 00:24:08.921
and I've looked at those exercises and I have experimented with a withholding or

381
00:24:10.431 --> 00:24:15.380
postponing ejaculation in some cases where you can use SAPE or have a partner

382
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:20.080
use fingers in the premium with pressure to prevent that from happening

383
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:25.370
mechanically,
which I don't actually think,
and this is subject great debate,

384
00:24:25.371 --> 00:24:30.200
but it doesn't strike me as the healthiest approach.
I mean,

385
00:24:30.201 --> 00:24:32.570
she was like sticking a potato and an exhaust pipe or something.

386
00:24:32.571 --> 00:24:37.460
It doesn't seem structurally.
Yeah,
it does.
It all.
Yeah,
exactly.

387
00:24:37.461 --> 00:24:41.450
And also,
it doesn't seem just very structurally prudent to do,

388
00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:46.280
uh,
that if you,
for instance,
as a male,
uh,

389
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:49.680
and I mean male and female physiology are of course very,
very different,
uh,

390
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.930
when it,
when it comes to sex in multiple respects.
But as a man,

391
00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:55.363
uh,

392
00:24:55.490 --> 00:25:00.490
certainly learning to develop a sensitivity to when you're about to ejaculate

393
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:03.200
and focusing on say,

394
00:25:03.201 --> 00:25:08.000
breathing patterns or visualization that let's do two allows you to extend the

395
00:25:08.001 --> 00:25:11.780
duration of intercourse or think is tremendously valuable.

396
00:25:11.781 --> 00:25:16.140
And it also transcends the bedroom.
I think it goes other places.
Right?
Uh,

397
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:21.430
<v 5>that's my question actually related to creativity and to see east there's a</v>

398
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:27.100
correlation between,
again,
I get the discipline and the,
the,

399
00:25:27.101 --> 00:25:30.290
the interrupts in north,
the habitual patterns.
I understand that,

400
00:25:30.291 --> 00:25:33.500
but I don't know,
I haven't experienced personally do,

401
00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.600
does that translate into,

402
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:41.200
okay then I'm more able to perceive nature or be more creative in my writing or

403
00:25:42.711 --> 00:25:47.711
be more aware of more present because I'm not giving my energy into this?

404
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:51.560
<v 1>Well,
no,
actually yeah,
I think it's energy.</v>

405
00:25:51.561 --> 00:25:55.210
I think it's also cognitive load.
Uh,
the,

406
00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.630
the degree to which any given activity is an interrupt of thought.

407
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:02.150
And when you remove something like that for a period of time,

408
00:26:02.151 --> 00:26:07.151
it ceases to be static in the mind and therefore your signal to noise ratio

409
00:26:08.571 --> 00:26:12.920
improves.
And ostensibly you should be able to,
in my experience is that you can,

410
00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:17.270
you can operate at a higher level when it comes to almost all of your other

411
00:26:17.271 --> 00:26:21.440
activities,
which is why very often when I'm abstaining from one thing,

412
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:24.500
for instance,
sex,
I'll also abstained from alcohol.

413
00:26:24.501 --> 00:26:29.360
I will also abstain from caffeine and I tend to layer those things on top of one

414
00:26:29.361 --> 00:26:29.910
another.
Yeah.

415
00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:30.743
<v 5>How,</v>

416
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.960
how long have you been able to abstain from all that stimulus that distract you

417
00:26:37.021 --> 00:26:38.120
from a certain,

418
00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:43.740
<v 1>yeah,
I did it earlier this year for almost eight weeks,
uh,
which is,</v>

419
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:47.400
which is a long,
which is a long time for me.
Uh,
me

420
00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.790
<v 5>mom did.
I'm like,
dude,
can I do this?</v>

421
00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.220
<v 1>Yeah,
it's a long time.
But I found it very,</v>

422
00:26:52.221 --> 00:26:56.810
very worthwhile and it proved to me also that I could do it.
And if you will,

423
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.840
and wonder whether or not you are addicted some to something,

424
00:26:59.841 --> 00:27:01.880
you should try to go without it and you will,

425
00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:06.910
you will potentially suffer physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms and

426
00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.900
your willingness to contend with that.

427
00:27:08.901 --> 00:27:13.460
We'll give you a very accurate read of how addicted you are to whatever it is

428
00:27:13.461 --> 00:27:16.870
you're abstaining from,
whether it's a thought,
whether it's,
let me just,

429
00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.910
<v 5>yeah.
And it's more about commitment.
It's like I been there,</v>

430
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.050
it was the undulation shower Sunday.
Yeah.
You know,

431
00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.150
waking up early in the morning and man,

432
00:27:25.151 --> 00:27:27.880
it's hard to commit to it every single day.

433
00:27:27.881 --> 00:27:31.990
It's more the discipline aspect that is exciting to make us my,

434
00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:36.550
I know that if I tackle that then I'll get a way bigger picture.

435
00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:38.680
<v 1>Yeah.
Well when I say addiction,</v>

436
00:27:38.681 --> 00:27:42.130
I'm not talking about addiction to nicotine or caffeine necessarily.

437
00:27:42.131 --> 00:27:46.900
I'm also talking about compulsive thought patterns.
Uh,
so for,
so for instance,

438
00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:47.320
I mean if,

439
00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:52.270
if you're interested in abstinence of any type or experimenting with that,

440
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:52.610
my,

441
00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:57.070
my recommendation would actually be if you really want to see very clear return

442
00:27:57.071 --> 00:28:01.780
on investment quickly,
uh,
I would just Google 21 day,
no complaint,

443
00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:06.670
experiment and look for a blog post that I wrote about a 21 day,
no complaint,

444
00:28:06.671 --> 00:28:07.151
experiment.

445
00:28:07.151 --> 00:28:12.151
And this translates very quickly to multiple domains when you remove certain

446
00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:19.300
patterns of freezing.
And not only speaking with therefore thinking,

447
00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:20.170
uh,

448
00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:24.160
the way that you relate to the world and the selection bias you use for seeing

449
00:28:24.161 --> 00:28:26.170
the good or seeing the bad changes very dramatically.

450
00:28:26.171 --> 00:28:30.190
So I would recommend taking a look at that as well.

451
00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:35.350
And that they can be very much right.
Yeah,
no problem.
APPS,
if you have,

452
00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.950
my dog is whining so I have to take Molly out to pee.
Uh,

453
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.810
but if you want to get me,
if you want to give me a quick question,

454
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:45.010
she's looking straight into gazing into my eyes as I record this.

455
00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.710
I have to get here,
I have to get her outside.
But what is,

456
00:28:47.711 --> 00:28:50.440
if you have one more question that I can potentially answer quickly,

457
00:28:50.441 --> 00:28:51.700
I'm happy to take a stab at it.

458
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:55.590
<v 5>I have a quick bite and I say it's a quick question but another,</v>

459
00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.690
another thing in my mind was I know that you are experimenting a lot with take

460
00:29:00.691 --> 00:29:04.530
an LX and in how they can,

461
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:09.180
they can be used to treat certain elements or,
or you know,

462
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.560
for healing.
And I'm just curious as a person,
you know,
I went,

463
00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:17.370
I went to college for anthropology and I work right now with individuals

464
00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:20.850
optimizing their performance through different tools.
Um,

465
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:27.290
and I'm thinking when is it a good time too to encourage somebody to tap into

466
00:29:28.711 --> 00:29:33.200
that and,
and,
and how can you guide them safely if,

467
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.720
if you don't have a personal experience of it?

468
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:39.920
<v 1>Well,
I can't recommend that you use psychedelics.</v>

469
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:45.190
You live in the states and currently the classical psychedelics are under

470
00:29:45.311 --> 00:29:47.230
schedule one,
which is in the same class as heroin.

471
00:29:47.231 --> 00:29:48.790
So if we're considering side effects,

472
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:52.570
you also have to consider the legal ramifications and potential side effects.

473
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:53.290
What I,

474
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:58.290
what I can suggest is that you investigate something called holotropic

475
00:29:59.561 --> 00:30:04.510
breathwork,
h o l o t r,
a PSA,
right?
So there are,

476
00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:09.730
psychedelics are one tool in the toolkit for creating an,

477
00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:14.970
a non ordinary state of consciousness that can provide insights and realizations

478
00:30:16.691 --> 00:30:20.890
and also reprogramming that can be applied to different domains,

479
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:25.360
uh,
really across the entire spectrum of human experience.

480
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:30.280
But it's not the only tool.
It just,
it just happens to be a very powerful tool.

481
00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:34.390
If you want to strap yourself or strap or encourage someone to strap themselves

482
00:30:34.391 --> 00:30:38.170
to the front of the icebreaker,
but they're not without risks.

483
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:43.170
They are exceptionally powerful and can be used irresponsibly.

484
00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:44.680
And uh,

485
00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:49.920
that is why I'm lobbying very strongly to a shepherd.

486
00:30:52.691 --> 00:30:57.691
These compounds specifically MTMA and siliciden through phase three trials,

487
00:30:57.911 --> 00:31:00.790
along with a handful of other people who were working very,

488
00:31:00.791 --> 00:31:05.791
very tirelessly on this so that they can be administered with medical

489
00:31:06.701 --> 00:31:11.560
supervision and trained therapists.
Uh,
I don't think that this is that far away.

490
00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:15.640
Uh,
if the stars align in,
in certain sense,

491
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:19.810
and if anybody wants to join me in supporting that,

492
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:24.070
they should check out a few organisations.
You,
sona,
Uso,

493
00:31:24.071 --> 00:31:25.480
Mna for Psilocybin,

494
00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:30.510
which is where I'm spending a lot of my own capital and attention maps,

495
00:31:31.151 --> 00:31:32.500
maps.org for MDA,

496
00:31:32.501 --> 00:31:36.700
which is effectively there from a funding perspective for phase three trials.
Uh,

497
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.550
and then if they want to really come to bat,
I'm actually,

498
00:31:39.551 --> 00:31:42.250
I haven't talked about this publicly,
but I'm going to be,

499
00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:46.480
I am committing $1 million of my own capital,
uh,

500
00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:48.670
to this over the next several years.

501
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:53.700
And we'll be really directing a lot of my attention at this field because I

502
00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:58.920
cannot recommend at this point that anyone pursue psychedelics with the legal

503
00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:04.660
ramifications that exist.
And also the difficulty in finding responsible,

504
00:32:04.661 --> 00:32:08.740
trained ethical,
uh,
therapists who can support this work.

505
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:10.790
It's just the,
the bend,

506
00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:15.840
the risk benefit ratio is really unappealing for most folks.

507
00:32:16.001 --> 00:32:19.570
But what I was going to say is if anybody wants to come to the table and

508
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:24.600
believes as I do based on both the data and experience that they have,

509
00:32:25.451 --> 00:32:27.790
the potential to change and even save lives,

510
00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:32.230
saying treatment resistant depression and other conditions that then people can

511
00:32:32.231 --> 00:32:35.700
go to Tim.
Dot.
Blog forward slash science.
Uh,
you know,
if,

512
00:32:35.701 --> 00:32:39.200
if you really have some capital that you'd like to bring to bear on this.
Um,

513
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.440
so I'll say that,
but at this point I would,

514
00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:47.000
I would explore other tools for helping shepherd people through the front.
Right.

515
00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.140
<v 5>That was totally,
sorry to interrupt,</v>

516
00:32:49.141 --> 00:32:52.800
but I was what I was looking for his word to go for,
to,

517
00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:57.540
to support this research because I don't just want to fall into the hands of

518
00:32:57.541 --> 00:33:01.290
whatever,
whoever,
you know what I mean?
Like,
like you just said,

519
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:05.100
it's hard to find responsible guidance.
Yup.

520
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:07.830
If you are an IDN in the yeah.
In the now,

521
00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:12.500
but I know that potential for healing and I totally get it,
um,

522
00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:16.260
that he's a work in progress and I totally support it and yeah,
you're right.

523
00:33:16.261 --> 00:33:19.170
The holotropic breathing is great.
It just taps into something,

524
00:33:19.171 --> 00:33:23.460
but you don't will be,
I haven't been able to fully,
fully,
um,

525
00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.900
get the same result and maybe some matter of just time and continues

526
00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:32.590
<v 1>practice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's okay.
You keep practicing and uh,
you know,</v>

527
00:33:32.591 --> 00:33:37.591
also don't forget the slow and steady reliable methods at your disposal,

528
00:33:40.061 --> 00:33:41.980
which would include,
for instance,
meditation.

529
00:33:41.981 --> 00:33:46.470
Sam Harris has a fantastic new APP which will be coming out shortly.
The,

530
00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.880
the waking up APP.
I would encourage people to take a look at that.

531
00:33:48.881 --> 00:33:50.590
There are other options like Coleman headspace,

532
00:33:50.591 --> 00:33:53.740
but when you start to layer these things on top of one another,

533
00:33:53.741 --> 00:33:58.741
you also very often see effects that are disproportionate and not additive.

534
00:33:59.801 --> 00:34:03.640
In other words,
you take meditation one unit,
Holotropic Breathwork,

535
00:34:03.641 --> 00:34:06.430
one unit and then say hot and cold work,

536
00:34:06.431 --> 00:34:09.190
say sauna and ice bath one unit,

537
00:34:09.191 --> 00:34:11.230
and you add those up and it's instead of being three,

538
00:34:11.231 --> 00:34:14.160
you get a five or six or seven.
So,
uh,

539
00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:18.610
I would encourage you to responsibly experiments.
Uh,
all right,
Diane,

540
00:34:18.611 --> 00:34:21.340
I got to run because I have a list of 20 people to call that I'm going to try to

541
00:34:21.341 --> 00:34:22.570
get through.
Oh,
go ahead

542
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:23.721
<v 5>so much.</v>

543
00:34:23.721 --> 00:34:28.430
I hope we can set a tempo and connect again and it was amazing to shatter these

544
00:34:28.431 --> 00:34:31.340
time and space with you and thank you so much for doing this and everything

545
00:34:31.341 --> 00:34:32.750
you're putting out there.
It's amazing.

546
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:37.870
<v 1>No problem.
My pleasure.
And I'll still uProxy man,</v>

547
00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:41.250
thanks for taking the time broke.
Broke.
Okay,
bye.
Bye.

548
00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:44.853
<v 5>This is Robin.</v>

549
00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:47.860
<v 1>Hey Robin,
this is Tim Ferriss.
How are you?</v>

550
00:34:48.650 --> 00:34:51.950
<v 5>Excellent.
I'm doing so well,
Tim,
how are you doing?</v>

551
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:54.080
<v 1>Oh,
splendid.
Couldn't be better.</v>

552
00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:58.190
And I am excited to be on the phone with you.

553
00:34:58.191 --> 00:35:01.430
So how might I help?
We'll see.

554
00:35:01.431 --> 00:35:04.700
I can fabricate an answer and an attempt to be helpful.

555
00:35:04.701 --> 00:35:08.600
I can't promise they'll be of any value,
but what's,
uh,
what's on your mind?

556
00:35:08.601 --> 00:35:10.730
What can I,
what can I potentially help with?

557
00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:16.690
<v 5>Yeah,
thank you.
Um,
a delight to be here.
Um,</v>

558
00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:22.430
I've admired for what,
10 years now your work and,

559
00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:27.500
and your sharing your work with people like us who sort of follow along in that

560
00:35:28.681 --> 00:35:32.200
same time.
I've built two somewhat successful businesses,

561
00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:35.040
a cafe in San Francisco and an annual conference.

562
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:40.670
But the thing you've done so successfully that I really am just kind of in awe

563
00:35:42.151 --> 00:35:47.151
of is continually hitting success after success in a way that appeals to the

564
00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:51.750
same target audience.
Um,
so I,

565
00:35:51.751 --> 00:35:55.480
I know you've talked about it not always being a successful,
uh,

566
00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:57.360
four hour chef for example,

567
00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:01.800
not doing quite as well if you'd wanted or even I remember what was it,

568
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:04.150
rust and iron?
The little,
yeah.

569
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:09.120
<v 1>You sounded that you did about others or multiple TV or multiple TV shows that</v>

570
00:36:09.121 --> 00:36:11.700
I've attempted on cable and elsewhere

571
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:16.360
<v 5>for sure.
Uh,
and yet you continually spring back.</v>

572
00:36:16.361 --> 00:36:19.450
So I look at four hour workweek through to this podcast.

573
00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:23.040
This appeals to people like me.
I'm a,
you know,

574
00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:27.970
white male living in the extended area actually just left same Cisco after 10

575
00:36:27.971 --> 00:36:32.650
years,
um,
but still in the extended Barea and 31.

576
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:37.240
Um,
and you're able to create content that appeals to that same audience and then

577
00:36:37.241 --> 00:36:40.370
seemingly grow that audience over time.
Um,

578
00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:45.880
I understand starting niche,
but personally and,

579
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:47.050
and in terms of,

580
00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:50.860
I guess professionally finding the next hit and then the next hit after that,

581
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:55.510
what do you think other than maybe luck has contributed to that sort of ongoing

582
00:36:55.511 --> 00:36:59.020
growing success of teaching?
Essentially people like you.

583
00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:02.910
<v 1>Cool.
Uh,
this is a good,</v>

584
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:08.060
this is a good topic to explore and hopefully my answer is an underwhelming.

585
00:37:09.271 --> 00:37:13.160
I'll try to fuel it with some more Tequila to make it more interesting.
Uh,

586
00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:17.160
let me,
uh,
let me ask a few clarifying questions.
If I could.
Uh,

587
00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.310
first of all,
I mean you have a shot here,
she might as well mention it.

588
00:37:20.311 --> 00:37:22.380
What is your cafe and what does the conference

589
00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:28.340
<v 5>thank you.
Yeah.
Uh,
it's by sounded it two years ago.
It's called Robin cafe,</v>

590
00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:32.100
that 17 gunshot shot wound in the mission in San Francisco.
Uh,

591
00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:36.110
and then the conference is about how we work in the 21st century called

592
00:37:36.111 --> 00:37:39.890
responsive contracts made and bounce back and forth every year between San

593
00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:40.530
Francisco and New York.

594
00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:45.440
It's responsive conference.com happening September 24th and 25th in New York

595
00:37:45.441 --> 00:37:46.274
this next year.

596
00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.840
<v 1>There we go.
All right,
cool.
And what,
uh,</v>

597
00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.480
this is,
this is all going somewhere,

598
00:37:52.481 --> 00:37:57.481
but how did you first come in to contact with me or any of the,

599
00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:03.610
the,
the content that I've put together,
whether it be writing,
audio or otherwise?

600
00:38:03.611 --> 00:38:05.200
How did,
how did you find your way to that?

601
00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:11.120
<v 5>Totally.
I think I would have come to it eventually regardless.
Um,</v>

602
00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:14.470
whether it's through four hour workweek or maybe when I came into contact with

603
00:38:14.471 --> 00:38:19.300
your material originally has to get with time just after you had published a

604
00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:20.890
four hour body.
Um,

605
00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.170
but like I've come to know Jenny's our client is a dear friend,

606
00:38:24.171 --> 00:38:24.970
the cofounder of Apple

607
00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:26.690
<v 1>Yoga.
Yeah,
she's great.</v>

608
00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:30.630
<v 5>You've done a little bit.
Um,
Chris Fussell,</v>

609
00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:33.470
the coauthor of team of teams was one of my speakers.
So like I,

610
00:38:33.471 --> 00:38:34.920
I've been peripheral to your work,

611
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:38.710
maybe very peripheral but sort of circling around for a lot of years.

612
00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:43.900
I think the first thing of yours I saw that really hooked me was early on in the

613
00:38:43.901 --> 00:38:45.310
Shopify competitions.

614
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:49.150
You had a little video about building online businesses and at the time I was

615
00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:51.940
dabbling with Shopify,
uh,

616
00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:56.880
trying to sell a digital content for parents of kids with autism,
which was a,

617
00:38:56.881 --> 00:39:00.910
a career of about five years that I had there.
Uh,
and,

618
00:39:00.911 --> 00:39:03.130
and something about your authenticity,
the,

619
00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:06.310
a video that then led me to your first ted talk.

620
00:39:06.311 --> 00:39:10.240
That then funnily enough led me four hour work week and I really been following

621
00:39:10.241 --> 00:39:11.074
along some fat.

622
00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:15.350
<v 1>Very cool.
I appreciate the context.
All right,</v>

623
00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:21.060
so let me try to tackle this and uh,

624
00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:24.740
I'll,
I'll edge into it a few different ways.
So the first,

625
00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:29.980
the first thing I would say as a caveat is that even if I make a very overt

626
00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:38.720
attempt to talk about my failures and missteps and so on,

627
00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:44.290
the ratio of successes to failures that make their way onto the internet or my

628
00:39:45.291 --> 00:39:50.291
podcast or into the books still presents a very skewed perception that I succeed

629
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:59.510
a disproportionate amount of the time.
Uh,
and

630
00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.410
what that does not mean,
however,

631
00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:07.190
that I am continually failing.

632
00:40:07.191 --> 00:40:10.970
And then just highlighting the one or two successes.
What it means,

633
00:40:10.971 --> 00:40:14.420
I think if I'm trying to look at it as an observer,

634
00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:16.460
is that number one,

635
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:23.500
I increased the likelihood of success by doing one thing very reliably.

636
00:40:26.601 --> 00:40:27.800
I'm not even gonna say,
well,

637
00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:33.370
but one thing very reliably and that is try to support and create products or

638
00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:42.350
chapters that scratch an itch I have.

639
00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:46.100
So it's a very simplistic model.

640
00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.320
It doesn't always work,

641
00:40:48.321 --> 00:40:53.321
but I assume that if something really grabs my attention that it will grab the

642
00:40:54.261 --> 00:40:59.261
attention of at least 10,000 other people on the planet who speak English and

643
00:41:00.471 --> 00:41:05.060
uh,
uh,
that,
that you start really narrow.

644
00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.440
And for me,

645
00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:11.830
I stick with what I know and what I know is my daily experience of the things I

646
00:41:11.841 --> 00:41:15.260
want,
the daily experience of the things that bother me.

647
00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:20.350
The daily experience of things that are a huge pain in my ass is the simple path

648
00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:25.450
I have found to be most reliable for reaching 10 million people.

649
00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:31.120
Reaching 100 million people is starting with the thing that you fucking know the

650
00:41:31.551 --> 00:41:32.330
best.

651
00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:37.330
And that is daily experience of pain or desire for pleasure or problems or

652
00:41:38.781 --> 00:41:43.781
solutions and sharing that and really not fucking yourself by overthinking it

653
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:46.130
and getting too sophisticated.

654
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:51.220
Really focus on what you know as an individual and identify the primary pain

655
00:41:52.041 --> 00:41:56.580
points and if you can find solutions to those for yourself,
uh,

656
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:57.590
generally speaking,

657
00:41:57.591 --> 00:42:02.591
that will really transcend any type of category that you fit neatly into and

658
00:42:04.341 --> 00:42:07.020
will affect a lot of people.
That's been my experience.
So it's a very,

659
00:42:07.021 --> 00:42:09.770
a can't believe how fucking along that was.
Oh my God.
So hopefully,
yeah,

660
00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:13.040
hopefully that's helpful in some capacity.

661
00:42:13.041 --> 00:42:18.041
But the reason that I've had the success I've had in say investing is because I,

662
00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.670
I have set very strict roles,

663
00:42:22.671 --> 00:42:25.850
which I sometimes violate to my detriment.

664
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:29.570
But for the most part I've stuck with very,

665
00:42:29.571 --> 00:42:34.571
very simple rules for investing in things that fix a personal problem that I am

666
00:42:35.151 --> 00:42:38.480
willing to pay money to fix.
Right?

667
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:44.200
And that excludes a lot of companies that have done spectacularly well that I

668
00:42:44.571 --> 00:42:49.070
have missed.
And it doesn't matter because you,
it's not about how many you miss,

669
00:42:49.071 --> 00:42:51.350
it's about how many you actually get.
Right.

670
00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:55.250
And that's true for entrepreneurship as it is for investing.

671
00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:59.660
And I've just tried very,

672
00:42:59.661 --> 00:43:02.330
very hard not to outsmart myself.

673
00:43:02.331 --> 00:43:05.270
And it makes me think of a quote from Charlie Munger who's the right hand

674
00:43:05.271 --> 00:43:07.100
investing partner of Warren Buffet.

675
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:12.350
And it is something along the lines of,
you know,

676
00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:17.380
it's incredible how far you can go by trying to not be consistently stupid.

677
00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.560
So you're not trying to outsmart everyone,

678
00:43:21.561 --> 00:43:23.660
you're just trying not to be consistently stupid.

679
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:28.160
And what I would put into the consistently stupid category is,

680
00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:32.750
is really trying to project and hypothesize too much when it comes to

681
00:43:32.751 --> 00:43:33.980
entrepreneurship or investing,

682
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:37.670
like focus on what's right in front of you and it can take you really far,

683
00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:41.330
so apologize for how long that took.
But uh,

684
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:46.220
this is something that I feel very strongly about because the results are so

685
00:43:46.221 --> 00:43:50.490
clear to me when people pay attention to it.
Uh,
so,

686
00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:51.493
so there you have it.

687
00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:53.200
<v 5>Yeah.
Nice.</v>

688
00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:57.640
And he reminded of what I think it was Warren Buffet who told you,
uh,

689
00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:02.380
at a shareholder meeting,
I was like,
if you have money to invest,
uh,

690
00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:04.240
invested in the stock market can get back to work.

691
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:08.350
<v 1>Yeah.
Invest in the s and p 500 and get back to where it was like the most</v>

692
00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:12.010
disappointing answer from a hero ever.

693
00:44:12.011 --> 00:44:16.180
But in retrospect it made a lot of sense.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey,

694
00:44:16.181 --> 00:44:19.930
if this isn't your game,
yeah.
If this isn't your stock picking game,

695
00:44:19.931 --> 00:44:21.700
then you shouldn't play.
So you get your face ripped off.

696
00:44:21.701 --> 00:44:24.160
So it's like put your money in the s and p 500 and get back to work.

697
00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:29.180
<v 5>Yeah.
Uh,
and then psychographic.
Um,</v>

698
00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:34.080
so regardless of what a person looks like or sounds like or where they live,

699
00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:35.340
uh,

700
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:40.020
the focus on specific problems that I as an individual have.

701
00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:44.190
Um,
and,
and who do I want to help those people like me to come,

702
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:46.710
whether they look like near not,
uh,

703
00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:50.460
doing that consistently in showing up again and again and getting back to work.

704
00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:51.910
<v 1>Yeah,
totally.
Let me ask,</v>

705
00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:56.940
let me add a few things also because I don't want this to seem too high concept

706
00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:00.580
30,000 feet
and that is,

707
00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:06.120
I avoid a lot of big failures by failing quickly with a lot of low cost tests.

708
00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:14.020
And that means for instance,

709
00:45:14.021 --> 00:45:17.380
Rustin iron you mentioned,
which is this it and who knows,

710
00:45:17.381 --> 00:45:18.760
maybe it will be resurrected,

711
00:45:18.761 --> 00:45:23.560
but it didn't get nearly the kind of attention that I would have hoped given how

712
00:45:23.561 --> 00:45:28.110
excited I was about it.
Right.
So some of these don't work.
And the,

713
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:30.670
for those who don't know,
this was a very short video series.

714
00:45:30.671 --> 00:45:32.260
I put up a few of them on Youtube,

715
00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:36.790
so youtube.com forward slash timferriss which were uh,

716
00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:41.130
tours of Jim's think.
So think cribs for gyms,

717
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.260
right?
Endlessly fascinating to me.

718
00:45:44.261 --> 00:45:48.890
Turns out most of the world doesn't give a single shit about it.
Uh,

719
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.980
and I did a few of these and uh,
they were,
uh,
you know,

720
00:45:53.981 --> 00:45:57.730
I filled them on actually one of them was just with an iPhone with Kelly Starr

721
00:45:57.731 --> 00:46:01.090
ad and then a handful of others with Mark Bell and so on.

722
00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:03.640
We're with much nicer cameras,

723
00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:08.500
but those experiments cost a few hundred dollars a piece maybe a little bit
more.

724
00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:14.130
And I decided for myself what the Max allowable cost was.

725
00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:20.130
So how much am I willing to sink into this to arrive at a decision as to whether

726
00:46:20.411 --> 00:46:23.800
to continue or not?
And he's like,
okay,
a few thousand bucks,

727
00:46:23.801 --> 00:46:24.940
I'm willing to put that in.

728
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.790
And depending on where you are in your entrepreneurial journey,

729
00:46:27.791 --> 00:46:32.080
that might be 80 bucks.
It might be $0 million.
It might be if you're,

730
00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:35.710
if you have much more to play with in terms of capital,
it might be $1 million.

731
00:46:35.711 --> 00:46:38.860
But in this case I was like,
you know what?
This isn't a revenue driver.

732
00:46:38.861 --> 00:46:42.010
It's really just for fucking shits and giggles to see if people respond to it.

733
00:46:42.011 --> 00:46:42.844
Well or not.

734
00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:47.620
I'm going to put in a few thousand bucks over a period of two months and see

735
00:46:47.621 --> 00:46:51.190
what happens.
And what happened was fucking crickets and I was like,
okay,

736
00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:54.160
well we're not going to do any more of those in less.

737
00:46:54.161 --> 00:46:58.840
I receive some type of information that directly and powerfully in some

738
00:46:58.841 --> 00:47:03.340
meaningful way contradicts this like f plus grade that I just got this

739
00:47:03.341 --> 00:47:04.174
experiment.

740
00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:07.910
<v 5>So,
so if you don't mind going into the specifics,</v>

741
00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:12.410
how do you determine like I just launched a tiny little podcast called Xander's

742
00:47:12.411 --> 00:47:15.560
strong,
my last name being Zander,
and again it was crickets,

743
00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:20.210
but like I know I could ask everyone I know to leave a review on iTunes for that

744
00:47:20.211 --> 00:47:21.560
project,
right?

745
00:47:21.561 --> 00:47:24.500
If you direct your audience again and again towards a couple of videos,

746
00:47:24.501 --> 00:47:26.990
those videos that will explode.
If you wanted to get sponsorship,

747
00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:28.310
I think you probably could.

748
00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:32.500
So do you determine crickets and that your audience,

749
00:47:32.501 --> 00:47:35.260
your psychographic was not interested in Rustin iron.

750
00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:39.910
<v 1>Yeah.
So there's,
all right.
So if we're looking at,</v>

751
00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:44.290
just to digress but not really digress into a related topic,

752
00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:49.800
if you look at investment pitches from startups as a venture capitalist or angel

753
00:47:51.941 --> 00:47:56.920
investor,
you will surprise,
surprise,
see the same graph and a lot of them,

754
00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:01.270
wow,
it looks like a hockey stick up until the right.
Fantastic.

755
00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:06.810
And the question that any investor should ask among others is what percentage of

756
00:48:08.651 --> 00:48:12.550
this growth is represented through organic growth in what percentage of this

757
00:48:12.551 --> 00:48:14.800
growth is represented through paid acquisition?

758
00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:19.240
Because founders being incentivized as they are,

759
00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:23.820
we'll very often go into the dark arts and uh,

760
00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:28.570
take some of their preexisting funding or whatever money they might have a

761
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:33.190
through cashflow or other means and invest it in artificially boosting the

762
00:48:33.191 --> 00:48:34.780
numbers.
Right.

763
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:40.470
And you can do this in an attempt to trick yourself as well.

764
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:45.640
And I think it's Richard [inaudible],
Richard Fineman,
who said,
physicist,

765
00:48:45.641 --> 00:48:48.250
anyone who wants to read a fantastic book should read.

766
00:48:48.251 --> 00:48:53.080
Surely I think surely you're joking.
Mr Fiman,
one of my favorites.
In any case,

767
00:48:53.081 --> 00:48:56.380
he said,
uh,
you know,
rule number,
and I'm paraphrasing all of these,

768
00:48:56.381 --> 00:49:00.370
but rule number one is you must not fool yourself and you're the easiest person

769
00:49:00.371 --> 00:49:01.204
to fool.

770
00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:06.210
So I really try to a focus on real metrics versus vanity metrics.

771
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.170
And I would put in vanity metrics.

772
00:49:11.171 --> 00:49:16.171
Almost every fucking buzzword does your that you can imagine like engagement.

773
00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:20.930
I think it just does not fucking matter for the most part.
I will look at the,

774
00:49:20.931 --> 00:49:22.870
and I cannot say this applies to everyone.

775
00:49:22.871 --> 00:49:27.640
I can tell you how I will evaluate these things.
Okay.
So I'll look at the,

776
00:49:27.641 --> 00:49:28.780
I will look at the,

777
00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:34.890
and it's partially to determine whether something is dead on arrival with no

778
00:49:35.351 --> 00:49:37.120
hope of revival.

779
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:41.860
Or if I'm performing an experiment and it's 10% off,

780
00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:47.080
and if I tweak that 10% it could explode,
which is sometimes the case.

781
00:49:47.081 --> 00:49:49.390
So if we look at Rustin ironed specifically,

782
00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:51.520
I'm not just looking at the view count,

783
00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:55.450
I'm looking at the comments and this is a subjective,

784
00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:57.580
not even going to say science art,

785
00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:01.270
but it's a bit of a gestalt pattern matching type of process that I'll go

786
00:50:01.271 --> 00:50:04.420
through where I will look for intensity of feedback.

787
00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:07.390
So if I look at the 30 copies,

788
00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:08.720
<v 5>love it,
people who hate it,</v>

789
00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:09.340
<v 1>right?</v>

790
00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:12.430
I will look at the 30 and I'll primarily look at the people who love it because

791
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:15.010
it doesn't matter how many people don't get it.

792
00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:17.380
It matters how many people do get it,
right?

793
00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:22.381
You can have 90% of the people in a given city hate your fucking business more

794
00:50:24.641 --> 00:50:29.300
than anything on the planet,
but if 10 of San Francisco loves your cafe,

795
00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:33.770
you are fucking set.
You know what I mean?
Like you are set,

796
00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:35.220
it doesn't matter like you,

797
00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:38.690
you are going to have a super mega home run on your hands.

798
00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:40.790
It doesn't matter how many people don't get it.

799
00:50:40.791 --> 00:50:41.960
It matters how many people do get it.

800
00:50:41.961 --> 00:50:46.961
So I'll pay attention to the positive feedback and if the positive feedback is

801
00:50:47.421 --> 00:50:49.100
along the lines of,
Oh my God,

802
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:54.080
this would be the best thing I've ever seen in my life.
I really loved a,
B and c,

803
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:57.500
but it'd be great to have this and this.

804
00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:00.410
If I see that type of feedback over and over again,

805
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:03.170
I will test again if I,

806
00:51:03.171 --> 00:51:07.550
and this is also related to my editing process for books,
when I edit books,

807
00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:12.140
I will ask people,
which for instance,

808
00:51:12.141 --> 00:51:15.170
and these are almost always friends of mine who are writers that I asked to do

809
00:51:15.171 --> 00:51:15.351
this.

810
00:51:15.351 --> 00:51:18.740
All the lawyers are very good at editing cause they can find sloppy thinking and

811
00:51:18.741 --> 00:51:21.440
words that shouldn't be there,
uh,

812
00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.050
or ambiguous wording and thinking.

813
00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:29.300
I will ask them to identify the 10% they would absolutely keep if I had to cut

814
00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:32.480
everything else and the 10% they would cut no matter what.

815
00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:36.620
Or The 10% that would cut if they had to write.
And

816
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:43.690
if so it takes only one person to love something more than the other 90% for me

817
00:51:45.291 --> 00:51:46.160
to keep it in the book.

818
00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:50.870
But it takes more of a consensus for me to cut something.

819
00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:55.130
Does that make sense?
If somebody absolutely loves something,

820
00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:56.600
even if nobody else mentions it,

821
00:51:56.601 --> 00:52:00.620
it stays in because my assumption is they're at least 10,000 more people who

822
00:52:00.621 --> 00:52:01.454
care about that.

823
00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:06.820
And I don't want to live in the comfortable middle ground,

824
00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:12.470
which is the gray of,
I like this because that is where you die.

825
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:17.420
And,
uh,
if you make something you think everyone will like,

826
00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:19.460
you're going to make something no one will love.

827
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:24.970
And I try very hard then to straddle that and not deliberately create things

828
00:52:25.791 --> 00:52:26.600
that people will hate.

829
00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:31.100
But in the process of selecting for things that people love,

830
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:35.190
the side effect will be that,
uh,

831
00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:36.940
in this pendulum of public opinion,

832
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:41.060
you will have people who hate it almost by definition.
Uh,
so,

833
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:44.930
so that is how I would look at something like rust and iron.

834
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:49.990
And I didn't have a overwhelmingly strong response even from a minority.

835
00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.230
Uh,
they,
they did not offer,

836
00:52:54.231 --> 00:52:59.231
and this is an indicator of a liking something and feel like I invested,

837
00:52:59.751 --> 00:53:04.100
I did not get a lot of quality constructive feedback.
In other words,
hey,

838
00:53:04.101 --> 00:53:06.230
this car is fantastic,
it's a Ferrari,

839
00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:10.970
but the front suspension is fucked if you fix that,
it would be a home run.

840
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.750
I didn't get that type of feedback and that's part of the reason why I shelved

841
00:53:14.751 --> 00:53:16.100
it.
It's not dead forever,

842
00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:19.770
but it might be a,

843
00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.730
whereas in the podcast case,
and here's,

844
00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:24.650
here's another layer that I would add to it,

845
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:30.690
it's not just what other people think.
In other words,

846
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:31.980
with the podcast,

847
00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:37.080
I was willing to slog through some fucking awful first episodes and they were

848
00:53:37.081 --> 00:53:40.290
all terrible,
but some of them were,
let's be honest,
I mean I've done 300 now.

849
00:53:40.291 --> 00:53:42.390
Hopefully it's better,
but some of the,

850
00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:46.380
some of the original episodes are really rough and I slogged through it.

851
00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:48.120
Why?

852
00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:53.120
Because I was developing additional skill sets,

853
00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:57.090
the ability to ask more questions,
right?

854
00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:01.320
I was developing additional skill sets,
the ability to let silence do the work,

855
00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:03.930
the ability to ask follow up questions,

856
00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:09.420
which default followup questions yield a lot of fruit such as how did that make

857
00:54:09.421 --> 00:54:13.830
you feel?
What did you learn from that?
How have you implemented that later,

858
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:18.950
etc. As well as developing deeper relationships with people I knew as well as

859
00:54:20.341 --> 00:54:23.850
people I didn't know as well,
acquaintances or even strangers,

860
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:28.440
if you want to have a really funny,
uh,
slash frustrating experience,

861
00:54:28.441 --> 00:54:32.570
you can listen to my first ever podcast interview with a stranger or someone I'd

862
00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:35.760
never spoken to before that point in time,
which is Ed Catmull,

863
00:54:35.761 --> 00:54:39.120
the president of Pixar.
I was really,
really nervous and I went,

864
00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:43.620
mm hmm.
Like a thousand fucking times.
That drove people nuts.

865
00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:45.960
Anyway,
I was,

866
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:50.130
I was developing skills and relationships or deepen relationships that would

867
00:54:50.131 --> 00:54:52.890
transcend that given project.

868
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:58.190
So I cared less about where I waited less weighed,

869
00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.900
maybe waited,
weighed less.

870
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:05.130
The public opinion of those early episodes.
Does that make sense?

871
00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:08.970
Uh,
because unlike say,

872
00:55:08.971 --> 00:55:13.380
Rustin iron where I was producing new content but not really developing new

873
00:55:13.381 --> 00:55:14.340
skills,

874
00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:19.230
there was a value to the practice of the podcast in and of itself.

875
00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:23.100
And that is true of a lot of what I do.

876
00:55:23.101 --> 00:55:28.101
I really try to select whenever possible for what will help me to develop skills

877
00:55:28.201 --> 00:55:33.201
and relationships that will Trin transcend that project in part because I can

878
00:55:33.301 --> 00:55:37.670
really effectively ignore the early feedback and I don't ignore it,
but I,

879
00:55:37.671 --> 00:55:41.780
I it is 10% of my consideration,
uh,

880
00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:46.080
feedback to determine the success of the project.
Right.

881
00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:51.440
And that's another litmus test perhaps,

882
00:55:52.441 --> 00:55:57.441
or another set of criteria that I've used consistently to increase the odds of

883
00:56:00.271 --> 00:56:03.900
each subsequent project success.
Uh,

884
00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:05.540
but it's,

885
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:10.750
it's in some ways laughably simplistic and uh,

886
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.150
uh,
it's really hard to keep something simplistic.

887
00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:19.410
It's intellectually difficult to keep something simplistic because you want to

888
00:56:19.411 --> 00:56:21.630
demonstrate to yourself that you're so fucking smart.

889
00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:26.050
You start to add additional criteria and use spreadsheets and all this stuff.

890
00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:28.810
And it's not to say that that stuff isn't warranted,

891
00:56:28.811 --> 00:56:30.850
but if you meet with a founder and you're like,
fuck,

892
00:56:30.851 --> 00:56:34.540
this guy gives me the Heebie jeebies it doesn't matter how good your God Damn

893
00:56:34.541 --> 00:56:39.250
spreadsheet is,
that you should listen to that very primitive intuition.

894
00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:43.660
It's probably telling you something that over millions of years of evolution is

895
00:56:43.661 --> 00:56:47.460
more sophisticated than whatever you put into excel that afternoon.
Right.
I,

896
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:50.110
I've tried to really,
really,
really,

897
00:56:50.111 --> 00:56:54.700
really revert to the simple and if you want to give it a nicer name,

898
00:56:54.701 --> 00:56:58.930
the elegant then the sophisticated or complex,

899
00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:04.170
which is not to say there isn't a place for the complex and the sophisticated.

900
00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:07.600
If you're doing,
if you're a,
uh,

901
00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:12.190
a growth stage or late stage private equity investor and you're thinking about

902
00:57:12.191 --> 00:57:17.140
taking over a company and replacing the management and improving operational

903
00:57:17.141 --> 00:57:19.540
efficiencies,
will you better really know your numbers.

904
00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:22.810
But that's not the game that I play.
That is not my power zone.

905
00:57:22.811 --> 00:57:26.620
And I will get a Nyli did if I try to compete against people who are good in

906
00:57:26.621 --> 00:57:30.580
those spaces,
just not my sandbox.
Uh,
so for me,

907
00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:35.970
I really try to target areas where I have a really,

908
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:43.030
really basic advantage and that is that I can stick to comply.

909
00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:48.090
I can stick to simplicity rather and a real pared down set of criteria when

910
00:57:51.731 --> 00:57:56.731
other people are tempted to go to complexity and succumb to complexity and I

911
00:57:57.611 --> 00:57:59.050
don't have many advantages.

912
00:57:59.051 --> 00:58:03.040
None of us I really want to go as far as to say none of us have that many

913
00:58:03.041 --> 00:58:04.180
fucking advantages,

914
00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:09.600
so figure out what is easy for you that is hard for a lot of your friends and

915
00:58:12.101 --> 00:58:15.070
start there and then look at your personal pains,

916
00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:20.230
look at your personal desires and use that as a starting point.

917
00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:23.800
If you're trying to create content or products that you hope will ultimately

918
00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:26.050
impact billions of people and guess what?

919
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:28.810
A lot of these products like dual lingo,
right?

920
00:58:28.811 --> 00:58:33.430
I was in there first as a as as best I can recall their first round of financing

921
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:39.150
at the time because it was the first language learning software that made sense

922
00:58:39.641 --> 00:58:43.570
to me.
That solved a lot of pain points for me personally as a language learning

923
00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:46.870
student.
And now as best I know,

924
00:58:46.871 --> 00:58:51.871
it is the most widely used free language learning software on the planet.

925
00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:54.580
Right.
Hundred million plus users.

926
00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:59.020
But it didn't start by thinking about what those hundred million people needed.

927
00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:01.750
It started with asking myself,

928
00:59:02.110 --> 00:59:05.530
does this or does this not scratch the itch,

929
00:59:05.531 --> 00:59:07.600
solve the pain that I experienced myself.

930
00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:11.470
So I hope that helps,
but that's,

931
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:13.780
that's partially how I think about this kind of thing.

932
00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:20.000
Now I really appreciate your time and taking the time.
Yeah.

933
00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:21.770
Hopefully that wasn't too drunk.

934
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.370
<v 6>Uh,
cool.</v>

935
00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:28.550
Well good luck with everything and uh,

936
00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:31.940
if I ever make my way back to the bay area,
I will check out your cafe.

937
00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:37.190
Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.

938
00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:40.160
Number one.
This is five bullet Friday.

939
00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:43.430
Do you want to get a short email from me?

940
00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:46.070
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday?

941
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:50.600
That provides a little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet

942
00:59:50.601 --> 00:59:55.220
Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I found or that

943
00:59:55.221 --> 00:59:56.780
I've been pondering over the week.

944
00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:59.780
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

945
00:59:59.781 --> 01:00:03.260
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

946
01:00:03.261 --> 01:00:07.550
somehow dug up in the,
uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

947
01:00:07.850 --> 01:00:12.850
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

948
01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:16.220
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

949
01:00:16.310 --> 01:00:21.290
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

950
01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:23.510
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

951
01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:28.460
Just go to four hour work week.com that's four hour work week.com all spelled

952
01:00:28.461 --> 01:00:31.610
out and just drop in your email and you will get the very next one.

953
01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:33.710
And if you sign up,
I hope you enjoy it.

954
01:00:34.610 --> 01:00:38.390
This episode is sponsored by Sotheby's and Sotheby's wine,

955
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:42.350
which offers a selection of the world's best wines for every pallet and
occasion.

956
01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:46.070
Many of you know,
I do like my one,
I do love wine,

957
01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:50.210
must be the Malbec from Argentina when I was down there and maybe it's a

958
01:00:50.211 --> 01:00:55.100
Zinfandel from California,
but I like it all.
I like lots and lots of wine.

959
01:00:55.310 --> 01:00:56.143
Sotheby's,

960
01:00:56.180 --> 01:01:01.040
as many of you may know is a global auction where they auction off many,

961
01:01:01.041 --> 01:01:02.540
many,
many different types of things.

962
01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:06.980
They're also a retailer of fine wine with locations in New York,
London,

963
01:01:06.981 --> 01:01:08.000
and Hong Kong.

964
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:11.450
The recently created an online store where you can buy wine directly.

965
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:14.210
You might think,
well that's for millionaires and billionaires.

966
01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:15.380
I don't go to auction houses,

967
01:01:15.381 --> 01:01:20.381
but the wines that they sell range from $14 per bottle all the way up to 25,000

968
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:25.340
let's say Sotheby's allows you to sort it by region,
great producer,

969
01:01:25.341 --> 01:01:28.100
or you can search for a particular bottle or by your budget,

970
01:01:28.101 --> 01:01:31.220
which is probably where I would go.
If you're gifting wine Sotheby's,

971
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:35.270
suggest champagne,
red Bordeaux,
burgundy or Californian wines,

972
01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:38.090
and if you want my opinion,
I would say,
you know,
try and Zinfandel.

973
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:41.180
If you haven't tried to Zinfandel from California,
but in any case,

974
01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:45.320
just one restriction at this time,
south of east can only ship to New York,

975
01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:50.360
California,
DC,
New Hampshire,
and Idaho.
So I'll say that one more time.

976
01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:55.520
Now.
Put it a different way.
If you are in or shipping to New York,
California,

977
01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.440
DC,
New Hampshire or Idaho,

978
01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:00.560
check it out because that's where the wine can currently be shipped.

979
01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:06.250
So visit Sotheby's wine.com that's s o t h e B o y s Sotheby's wine.com and use

983
01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:29.310
This episode is brought to you by Peloton and I'd heard about Peloton over and

984
01:02:29.311 --> 01:02:30.120
over again,

985
01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:35.010
but I ended up getting a Peloton bike in the whole system after I saw my buddy

986
01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:38.160
Kevin Rose,
I've known him forever,
some of you know,

987
01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:43.220
and he showed up at my gate at my house a while back and he looked fantastic.

988
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:48.480
I asked him as a dude,
you look great.
What the hell have you been up to?

989
01:02:48.481 --> 01:02:50.610
Because he's always doing a weird diet or another,

990
01:02:50.611 --> 01:02:52.110
but it only lasts like a week or two.

991
01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:55.980
So he always regresses to the mean after like 75 beers and he said,

992
01:02:55.981 --> 01:02:58.530
I've been doing peloton five days a week.
Now.

993
01:02:58.531 --> 01:03:03.240
That caught my attention because Kevin does nothing five days a week and you

994
01:03:03.241 --> 01:03:06.450
know,
I love you Kevin,
but it really peaked my curiosity.

995
01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:11.540
Ended up getting a system and it's become an integral part of my week.

996
01:03:11.850 --> 01:03:16.440
I love it and I really didn't expect to love it at all because I find cycling

997
01:03:16.441 --> 01:03:18.030
really boring usually.

998
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:23.130
But peloton is an indoor cycling bike that brings live studio classes right into

999
01:03:23.131 --> 01:03:23.964
your home.

1000
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.460
You don't have to worry about fitting classes into your schedule and making it

1001
01:03:26.461 --> 01:03:29.010
to a studio with some type of commute,
etc.

1002
01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:33.090
New classes are added every day and this includes options led by elite New York

1003
01:03:33.091 --> 01:03:34.530
City instructors in your own living room.

1004
01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:38.580
You can even livestream studio classes taught by the world's best instructors or

1005
01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:41.580
find your own favorite class on demand.
And in fact,

1006
01:03:41.581 --> 01:03:45.840
Kevin and I rarely do live classes and you can compete with your friends,

1007
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:48.270
which is also fun.
Kevin,
I'm coming after you,

1008
01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:51.600
but we usually just use classes on demand.

1009
01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:54.200
I really like not Wilbur's and his iron,

1010
01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:58.110
high intensity training sessions that are shorter,
like 20 minutes.

1011
01:03:58.770 --> 01:04:03.660
And I think Kevin's favorite is Alex and everyone seems to have their favorite

1012
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:07.380
instructor or you can select by music duration and so on.

1013
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:12.450
Each Peloton bike includes a 22 inch HD touchscreen performance tracking

1014
01:04:12.451 --> 01:04:12.990
metrics.

1015
01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:17.250
I think that that along with the realtime leaderboard are the main reasons that

1016
01:04:17.251 --> 01:04:21.900
this caught my attention when cycling never had caught my attention before.

1017
01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:25.440
It's really pretty stunning what they've done with the user interface to keep

1018
01:04:25.441 --> 01:04:29.730
your attention.
The belt drive is quiet and it's smaller than you would expect,

1019
01:04:29.731 --> 01:04:31.710
so it can fit in the living room or an office.

1020
01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:35.040
I actually have it in a large closet,
believe it or not,

1021
01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.710
and it fits with no problem.

1022
01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:42.720
So peloton is offering all of you guys the snares of the Tim Ferriss show,

1023
01:04:42.721 --> 01:04:44.040

Wait,

1028

1029
01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.430
No,
the shoes you need,

1030
