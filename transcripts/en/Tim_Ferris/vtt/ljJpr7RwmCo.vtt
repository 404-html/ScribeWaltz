00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.860
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.861 --> 00:00:06.890
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking one else.

3
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.440
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

4
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.270
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by audible,</v>

5
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.330
which has the largest selection of audio books on the planet.

6
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.140
I've used audible for many years and I've several audio books to recommend right

7
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.890
off the bat.
If you're looking for a new one ready player,
one by Ernest Cline,

8
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.620
you may have heard of it.
The Tao of Seneca by Seneca.

9
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.550
If you want to hear my favorite collection of letters of all time as well as the

10
00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:45.320
graveyard book by Neil Gaiman,

11
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.350
which is a fiction book I used to reintroduce nonfiction purists to the beauty

12
00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:55.190
and truth and enjoyment,
affection,
the graveyard book.

13
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.460
It is incredible and I like the version that Neil reads himself,

14
00:00:58.461 --> 00:01:01.760
but the entire ensemble cast is also fun.

15
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.380
Audible members get a credit every month,
good for any audio book in the store,

16
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.590
regardless of price and unused credits roll over to the next month.

17
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.800
So if you didn't like your audio book,
no problem.
You can exchange it.

18
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.910
No questions asked.
Plus your books are yours to keep with audible.

19
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.660
You can go back and relisten anytime,
even if you cancel your membership.

20
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.190
And for some books,
again,
graveyard book by Neil Gaiman,
I've listened to many,

21
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:28.250
many times.
She may even just start over as soon as you finish it the first time.

22
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.030
Audible also helps you to listen to more books by letting you switch seamlessly

23
00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:34.730
between devices.
Picking up exactly where you left off,

24
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.890
whether it's on your phone,
through your car,

25
00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:39.890
from a tablet or at home on an Amazon Echo,
whatever.

26
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.000
You can get through tons of books,
hands in ice free while doing almost anything.

27
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.220
So that is part of the beauty of audio.

28
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.220
It is a secondary activity when you're walking the dog cooking,

29
00:01:49.221 --> 00:01:50.054
whatever it might be.

30
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.420

This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

74
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:33.070
it is my job to interview in deconstruct world class performers of all different

75

habits,

I was so impressed from start to finish.

81
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.090
His name is George Raveling and I do owe a debt of gratitude to Ryan holiday for

82
00:04:57.341 --> 00:05:00.550
making this introduction.
George Raveling on Twitter,

83
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.410
Facebook and Instagram at George Raveling,
r a.
V e L.
I n G.

84
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.740
Coach George raveling.com is an 80 year old living legend and Nike's former

85
00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:15.160
director of international basketball coach Rav,
as he's often called,

86
00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:19.270
was the first African American basketball coach in the pack eight pack 12 and is

87
00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:24.160
often referred to as the human Google for reasons that become abundantly clear.

88
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.060
In this interview,
he has held head coaching jobs at Washington state,

89
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.590
the University of Iowa and USC.
Following a prolific basketball coaching career.

90
00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:36.550
He joined Nike at the request to Phil Knight where he played an integral role in

91
00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:40.690
signing a reluctant,
not many people know that story.
Michael Jordan,

92
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.640
he's also been inducted in the Nice Smith Memorial Basketball Hall of fame as

93
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:47.890
well as the college basketball hall of fame.

94
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.090
We cover a lot in this wide ranging conversation and Austin,
Texas.

95
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.770
We cover how he was given the original copy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's.

96
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.770
I have a dream speech,

97
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.290
which was not the name by the way originally how his practice team ended up

98
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:09.890
beating the 1984 US Olympic Dream Team in basketball.

99
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.890
What the story of getting Michael Jordan,
the signs Nike.

100
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.210
Why coach Rav has been nicknamed the human Google his veracious reading habit

101
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:19.850
and how he picks books and takes notes.

102
00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:23.390
We had a huge nerd out over how to take notes in books,

103
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.490
the wisdom of his grandmother and other mentors and much,
much,
much more.

104
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.520
I really walked out of this conversation floating on there and reflecting on and

105
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.660
thinking about so much of what he shared.

106
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.300
He's an incredibly impressive human being.

107
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:43.790
I hope you enjoy this even half as much as I did,

108
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:47.210
which would mean it's probably going to be one of your favorite episodes that

109
00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:49.370
I've done.
So without further ado,

110
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.350
please enjoy the ever impressive George Raveling

111
00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.540
coach.
Welcome to the show.
Thank you

112
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.100
<v 2>very much.
It's a pleasure to be part of your world.</v>

113
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.660
<v 1>I have been looking forward to this conversation ever since.</v>

114
00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:11.690
Our mutual friend Ryan holiday gave me a teaser of your life story and when I

115
00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:15.840
started doing homework and prep,
I started thinking to myself,

116
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.710
I should try to get coach to spend the next two days with me.

117
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.760
I should cancel my flights because we are going to barely scratch the surface.

118
00:07:23.761 --> 00:07:27.260
In the time that we have today.
And,
uh,

119
00:07:27.261 --> 00:07:32.261
I struggled with where to start because I have pages and pages of notes of my

120
00:07:33.121 --> 00:07:36.030
own,
and you also sent me,

121
00:07:36.031 --> 00:07:38.610
I will give you credit where credit is due,
the,

122
00:07:38.611 --> 00:07:42.960
the absolute best exploratory bullets at any guests out of 300 plus gasses

123
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.570
setting.
And,
uh,

124
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:51.150
we're going to start somewhere that I think may surprise people.

125
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.800
And,
uh,
that is the,
I have a dream speech.
So could you,

126
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.830
could you tell us about your relationship with that,
please?

127
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.650
<v 2>Well,
it's,
it's,
uh,
uh,</v>

128
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.490
one of those stories about being in the right place at the right time.

129
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.840
Um,
it was a Thursday night and,

130
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.770
and Claymont Delaware and I was having dinner at my best friend's home.

131
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.090
And his doctors are very,

132
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.260
his dad was a very prominent dentists and Wilmington.

133
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.920
And so in the background as we ate dinner in those days,

134
00:08:23.921 --> 00:08:28.840
everyone ate dinner as a family.
And so in the background the television was on,

135
00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:30.640
in the news,
uh,
was,
uh,

136
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.270
commentary was about the forthcoming march on Washington.

137
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.960
And so my friend was,
his name Warren Wilson is dead,

138
00:08:37.961 --> 00:08:41.170
was Dr. Woodrow Wilson.
Uh,

139
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.410
and so he asks a question of us,

140
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.330
are you boys are going to go to the march on Washington?
And we said,
no.

141
00:08:49.331 --> 00:08:52.710
And he asked us why not?
And we gave him some,
the,
uh,

142
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:57.720
you full a excuse.
We didn't have any money or way to get there.

143
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.130
And so he said,
well,
I have a feeling this is going to be a historic event.

144
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.690
It could be the largest gathering of black people in the history of American one

145
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:10.680
place.
And so he said,
and I think the two of you should be there.
He said,

146
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:12.660
so what I'm going to do,
he had two cars.
He said,

147
00:09:12.661 --> 00:09:17.150
I'm going to give me a one of the cars and money and you guys should attend.

148
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.740
And so,
uh,
the next day we,

149
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.100
we took off for Washington DC on Friday.

150
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.480
And at that time there was one main thoroughfare into Washington.

151
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:30.600
DC was route one.
And so when you come in,

152
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.520
you come in off in New York Avenue.

153
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:36.750
And so there were a lot of what we call motels in those days along there.

154
00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:39.700
And we found one that was suitable to our,
uh,

155
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.940
economics and we got a room.

156
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:47.270
And so we decided that we would go down to the monument grounds just to get a

157
00:09:47.431 --> 00:09:50.580
feel for the best way to get there and what it was going to look like.

158
00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:55.290
And so as we were walking around,
we encountered a gentleman and he asked us,

159
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.410
I'm sixth floor and Warren,
six four.

160
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.700
So he asked us if we were coming to the march the next day.
And we said,

161
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:07.200
absolutely.
And so he said,
would you want to volunteer?
And so we said,
for what?

162
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:11.730
And he said to be security guards.
So we said,
sure,
we'll volunteer.
And he said,

163
00:10:11.731 --> 00:10:16.590
well,
we're expecting twice the attendance that the papers are predicting.

164
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.360
And so we,
we have to add a additional security.
So he said,
well,

165
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:26.310
meet you down there the next morning at eight 15.
And so we got there early.

166
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.740
Uh,
we woke up,
we were all excited.

167
00:10:28.741 --> 00:10:32.700
So we get down there and we find him and he said,
wow,
you guys are really early.

168
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.580
And so he looks at how tall we are.
And he says,
well,

169
00:10:35.581 --> 00:10:40.500
we've decided we're going to put extra security up on the podium and so we're

170
00:10:40.501 --> 00:10:43.830
going to sign you guys to the podium.
And um,

171
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.860
and so they had these little white hats,
which uh,

172
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:53.370
maybe like a sailor hat,
but their cardboard that the wear for identification.

173
00:10:53.371 --> 00:10:58.170
So we were stationed at the podium where all those speakers we're going to.

174
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.250
Uh,
so to give you some backdrop on it,

175
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.240
that all the speakers and they start at nine o'clock in the morning.

176
00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:07.410
If I remember correctly,

177
00:11:07.411 --> 00:11:10.710
John Lewis was the first speaker and then there was a series of speakers

178
00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:14.970
throughout the day concluding with Martin Luther King as the last speaker.

179
00:11:14.971 --> 00:11:18.480
Some people would suggest that it was,
he was a keynote speaker,

180
00:11:18.481 --> 00:11:19.440
but he really wasn't.

181
00:11:19.441 --> 00:11:22.320
They put king last because they knew he would hold the crowd.

182
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:28.340
So part of the stipulation was each speaker had to submit in writing his speech

183
00:11:29.491 --> 00:11:33.870
that he was going to give.
And that could or could not exceed five minutes.

184
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.150
There was a hard and fast rule on this.

185
00:11:36.151 --> 00:11:41.151
And what was interesting about it was that James Baldwin submitted his speech

186
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.660
and he,
and,
uh,
they felt it was too exclamatory.
They,

187
00:11:45.661 --> 00:11:50.130
they were worried about getting the crowd to excited and maybe having a

188
00:11:50.131 --> 00:11:51.910
demonstration.
And,

189
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.800
and Baldwin speech was over five minutes and so they wouldn't accept it.

190
00:11:56.801 --> 00:11:59.200
So Baldwin [inaudible] refused to speak,

191
00:11:59.201 --> 00:12:01.660
but he was originally to be one of the speakers.

192
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.040
So as the day goes on,
it's a hot and humid day.
And,

193
00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:09.340
and as you look out from the Lincoln Memorial,

194
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.880
you look out to what they call a reflecting pool all the way back to the

195
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:17.620
Washington monument.
And as the longer the day when the hotter it became,

196
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.160
uh,
the more energized people were.
Uh,

197
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:25.800
and so we finally get to that point,
uh,
of the,

198
00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:29.470
the end of the day,
and Martin Luther King comes on to speak.

199
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:33.960
And so as history,
we'll,
we'll,

200
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:38.830
we'll show a kink speaks.

201
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:39.911
Uh,

202
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:44.911
he's speaking from prepared notes and he gets to about a one paragraph left.

203
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.640
And then as he's speaking to crowds,
as,
as it's just mesmerized by him,
he,

204
00:12:51.641 --> 00:12:56.641
he has captured every single ounce of attention in each human being.

205
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:58.330
And,
uh,

206
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:03.390
and he had a cadence about the way spoke that he would say how long?

207
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:08.620
And he had these,
what I call drum beats,
and he had a way of,

208
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:13.780
of raising and lowering his voice to,
to manipulate you as a listener.

209
00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:19.160
And,
and so he's just about toward the end of this,

210
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:24.250
uh,
the last,
uh,
going to the last paragraph and you hear a voice.

211
00:13:24.251 --> 00:13:27.730
And today with technology,
you could certainly do it.
Uh,

212
00:13:27.731 --> 00:13:31.300
but the female voice front seated behind the podium says,

213
00:13:31.301 --> 00:13:35.020
tell them about the dream Martin.
Tell them about the dream.
Well,

214
00:13:35.021 --> 00:13:37.240
the voice was that of Mahalia Jackson,

215
00:13:37.241 --> 00:13:39.730
who most people would say is the greatest Gospel,

216
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.930
Black Gospel singers of all time,
maybe the greatest gospel singer of all time.

217
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:49.180
She had worked on previous,
uh,
uh,

218
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.060
demonstrations and gatherings with Martin Luther King.

219
00:13:52.061 --> 00:13:55.090
So she had heard Martin Luther King tell the,

220
00:13:55.091 --> 00:13:58.720
I have a dream part in Selma and,
and Detroit.

221
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.680
And so if you look at the original speech,

222
00:14:02.681 --> 00:14:06.190
it was not part of the original speech.
And second,

223
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.980
he's the only speaker who exceeded five minutes.

224
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.350
And so at that point,

225
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:16.310
the crowd is just mesmerized by him and saw him and he ad libs in the,

226
00:14:16.311 --> 00:14:19.060
I have a dream speech and then he,

227
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:24.070
and then at the conclusion he goes back and closes out with the prepared,
uh,

228
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.830
closing.
So when it's over for,
uh,
we,

229
00:14:28.831 --> 00:14:33.831
we were told to form of v around the podium and help the usher him out.

230
00:14:34.091 --> 00:14:36.950
So it justice,
he finishes,
uh,

231
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.750
I s the most frequently asked question is,

232
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.680
is why did you ask him for the speech?
I have no idea.
It's just impulse.

233
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:49.150
So I say to him,
to Dr. King as he's falling the speech,
I said,

234
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.110
Dr. King could have had that copy of the speech and,
and just as he's folding,

235
00:14:54.111 --> 00:14:57.500
and he instinctively hands it to me,
and,

236
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.180
and then a rabbi who's doing the Benediction says,
Dr. King Nuts,

237
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.710
a great speech that I am so inspired.

238
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.550
So as the attention shifted away from me to the rabbi.

239
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:12.800
And so,
uh,
we,
we,
when the Rab,
I finished a benediction.

240
00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:17.040
I actually,
CBS went through the archives of Johnson and Johnson,

241
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.740
Ebony magazine and they found a picture of me standing right beside him at the

242
00:15:21.741 --> 00:15:22.574
podium.
So I,

243
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:27.820
I actually have a picture that verifies that I was there and CBS was able to

244
00:15:28.281 --> 00:15:32.600
find some footage where he was folding this,
that's the speech.

245
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.020
And they can see him hand in that,
but,
but didn't show my hand.
And,

246
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:40.110
and so at any rate when it's over,
uh,

247
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:43.490
they go over to the White House and as they walk into the Oval Office,

248
00:15:43.491 --> 00:15:47.720
President Kennedy says,
Dr. King,
I loved your,
I have a dream speech.

249
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.793
Well,

250
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:53.150
so the media took that and ran with it because if you see the original speech,

251
00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.800
the speech had no title.

252
00:15:55.250 --> 00:16:00.200
And so little did I know at that time that this was going to take on the

253
00:16:00.201 --> 00:16:05.201
historic significance that it did actually took 50 years for it to really find

254
00:16:05.751 --> 00:16:07.370
its rightful place in history.

255
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:12.020
It's makes me mindful of something that heard Malcolm x say one time,

256
00:16:12.021 --> 00:16:15.170
then history is best situated to record all man's deeds.

257
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:19.790
So my interpretation of that is history and historians ultimately we'll put

258
00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:24.080
things in their rightful place.
And so it took 50 years.

259
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.240
Well,
so,
uh,

260
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.790
I had no idea at that point when I had the speech that it,

261
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:34.760
that it was going to become a,
uh,
a,

262
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.550
a valuable historic document.

263
00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.300
So when I got back home,

264
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:46.130
I put it inside of a book,
uh,
that I had from uh,
that uh,

265
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.180
President Harry Truman gaming.
So my senior year at Villanova,

266
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.690
I played in East West All star game and it was in Kansas City.

267
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:57.200
And one of the things that they did is they took us out to independence,

268
00:16:57.201 --> 00:17:01.700
Missouri to meet President Truman.
So,

269
00:17:01.701 --> 00:17:03.260
and when we went out to meet him,

270
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:08.261
his office at his home was a replica of the Oval Office and soy as we walked in,

271
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:16.040
each of us noticed there was two huge tables to the right with books stacked up

272
00:17:16.041 --> 00:17:20.070
on them.
Well at the end after President Truman had talked with the,

273
00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:25.010
with all the team and,
and the coaching staff and trainers,
he on the way out,

274
00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:29.730
he gave each of us a two volume book of,
of,
of uh,

275
00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.210
uh,
that he wrote on his presidency.

276
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:36.950
And so in the book and which I still have both of them now,
both books say,

277
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:42.230
uh,
to George Raveling from Harry s Truman best wishes and it has the date.

278
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.840
So I put the speech inside of one of,

279
00:17:44.841 --> 00:17:48.710
those were a couple of reasons I would remember where it was in to,

280
00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.110
I knew I'd never throw those books away because how many people can say they

281
00:17:52.111 --> 00:17:55.950
have an autographed book by the President of the United States personally to
you.

282
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.720
So it stayed there for years and years.
And I never thought about it.

283
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.670
I actually,
my wife didn't even know I had cause.

284
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:10.130
And so I go to the University of Iowa's head basketball coach.

285
00:18:10.231 --> 00:18:14.040
And of course I'm the first black coach during first in the big 10.

286
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.360
And so this,
there's much to do about this.
At that time,

287
00:18:18.361 --> 00:18:21.390
all the local newspapers,
big newspapers,

288
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:24.840
had a Sunday magazine section,
uh,
on.
Uh,

289
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:29.250
and so the cover story on the Cedar Rapids Gazette paper was going to end.

290
00:18:29.251 --> 00:18:32.840
This magazine section was going to be about me taking the,
the,
uh,

291
00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.880
University of Iowa had basketball coaching job.

292
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:39.660
So as he was asking questions,
he,

293
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.150
what I call a throwaway question,
he said,
coach,

294
00:18:42.151 --> 00:18:46.120
were you ever involved in the civil rights movement?
And I said,
well,
Kinda.

295
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.330
And he says,
what does that mean?
I said,
well,
I went,

296
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:53.040
I attended the march on Washington.
I was a security guard and a,

297
00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:57.840
and I was able to secure that,
the speech.
And at that point,

298
00:18:57.841 --> 00:19:02.200
if I've ever seen a person just physically decomposers,

299
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:06.590
I mean,
he was,
he just,
he didn't know,
he was so much more,

300
00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:11.080
I couldn't figure out why it was so excited.
And so he says,
oh my God,
are you?

301
00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.910
And he said,
where is it?
I,
I had only been there about six weeks,

302
00:19:14.911 --> 00:19:17.910
so I hadn't unpacked all the boxes down in the basement.
So I said,

303
00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.880
it's in a box down in the basement.
He said,
can we call it look for it?

304
00:19:20.881 --> 00:19:23.340
And so we'd go down and not figured out what's box it was.

305
00:19:23.341 --> 00:19:27.900
And I pulled it out and he was literally shaking.
And,
and so he said,

306
00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:31.890
oh my God.
He said,
can I call my editor?
Can we take a picture of this?

307
00:19:31.891 --> 00:19:34.860
And so I said,
sure.
So little did I,

308
00:19:34.861 --> 00:19:38.580
that was the first public notice that I had to speak.
So,

309
00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:43.740
so the story kind of now starts to split between rattling being the head

310
00:19:44.161 --> 00:19:46.620
basketball coach unraveling have in this speech.

311
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:52.200
And so from that point on it,
it took a,
it took on a little,
uh,

312
00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.450
a different significance,

313
00:19:54.451 --> 00:19:58.680
but it's still time had not placed in,
in its rightful place.

314
00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.820
And so over the years it became more,

315
00:20:02.821 --> 00:20:07.440
and I literally,
uh,
one of the miracles,
Tim,

316
00:20:07.441 --> 00:20:12.441
is that for 50 years I had this and nothing had no flood a house does it catch

317
00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:18.720
on fire,
somebody that's doesn't steal a book,
whatever.

318
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:24.110
And if you saw the actual speech now have it in a vault in La for the speech to

319
00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:29.070
survive this,
this long.
And,
and,
and,

320
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:33.720
and the quality of the paper,
it's type written.
You can see little,

321
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.590
little typos in there and so forth.
And,
um,

322
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:43.220
I had a friend of mine who graduated with me from Villanova who was with the FBI

323
00:20:43.221 --> 00:20:46.020
and,
and so one time we were talking about it and he said,
well,

324
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:49.570
if you ever get in a situation where someone doubts that,

325
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.770
that you really have the speech or that it was good,
he said,

326
00:20:53.771 --> 00:20:56.200
we can lift the fingerprints off of there.
He said,

327
00:20:56.201 --> 00:20:58.390
your fingerprints are on there and so's kings.

328
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:03.900
So it was an interesting circumstance that what became the focal part of the

329
00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:10.210
speech was something they never really intended to use.

330
00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:15.130
And only through the motivation of Mahalia Jackson did he ad libbed the,
the,

331
00:21:15.131 --> 00:21:16.780
I have a dream piece in.

332
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:21.480
So as the years went on it,
it took on a,
a,

333
00:21:21.481 --> 00:21:26.450
a unique value.
And so at one point,
my,
uh,

334
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.060
uh,
Turner sports does it,
a documentary on it.

335
00:21:31.061 --> 00:21:35.290
And so my wife goes to work,
people are talk,
oh,

336
00:21:35.291 --> 00:21:37.270
I didn't know about your husband having to speed.

337
00:21:37.271 --> 00:21:41.380
So my wife comes home one evening,
she says,
Hey,
we got to have a talk.
I said,

338
00:21:41.381 --> 00:21:45.190
okay.
She says,
the speech has got to get out of this house right away.
She said,

339
00:21:45.191 --> 00:21:49.000
you traveled too much,
somebody's going to break in the house and,
and,

340
00:21:49.001 --> 00:21:52.780
and I might get killed over to speech.
So she said,
you gotta get it Outta here.

341
00:21:52.781 --> 00:21:57.100
So we put it in another ball and as naturally would happen,

342
00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:02.140
uh,
various people tried to buy it from me.

343
00:22:02.141 --> 00:22:06.940
But I never felt that I had total ownership of it.

344
00:22:06.941 --> 00:22:11.941
I kind of felt like I was the guardian of something historic and I became so

345
00:22:12.761 --> 00:22:16.240
sensitive about it that,
uh,
I stopped.

346
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.740
I would on black history month,
I'd get many invitations to come,

347
00:22:20.741 --> 00:22:23.020
bring the speech,
talk about it.
But I,

348
00:22:23.021 --> 00:22:26.620
I was so self conscious that I stopped doing it because I never wanted anybody

349
00:22:26.621 --> 00:22:28.960
to think that was profiting off of this.
Uh,

350
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:32.890
an I never entertained NDT offers this to sell it.

351
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:37.080
And when I was growing up as a little boy in DC,

352
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:41.200
my grandma used to always say that money's the root of all evil.

353
00:22:41.201 --> 00:22:45.820
Don't build your life around money.
And so it wasn't,
you know,

354
00:22:45.821 --> 00:22:46.631
I wasn't rich,

355
00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:51.210
but I wasn't poor and I wasn't desperate to make money or,

356
00:22:51.211 --> 00:22:55.990
or headlines on it.
The headlines of,
of,
uh,
crude because,
uh,

357
00:22:55.991 --> 00:23:00.390
of,
uh,
people's curiosity about having it.
But I,

358
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:05.320
I look back on it now and it was a classic example of being in the right place

359
00:23:05.321 --> 00:23:09.190
at the right time and which has happened so much in my life.

360
00:23:09.191 --> 00:23:11.770
Getting good adult advice.

361
00:23:11.771 --> 00:23:14.460
If Dr. Wilson doesn't say,
Hey,

362
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:19.090
you two need to go and I'll provide the opportunity for you,

363
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.040
then I would have missed out on,
on a piece of,
uh,

364
00:23:22.041 --> 00:23:27.041
of history that put an indelible mark on my life on incredible story.

365
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:32.950
When incredible experience,
you think about the,
how the stars aligned to happen.

366
00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.490
And,
uh,
from that point on,

367
00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:43.050
I learned a good lesson that you don't have to have a relationship with a person

368
00:23:43.931 --> 00:23:46.970
for them to your,
your mentor.

369
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.390
And so in those days,
I,

370
00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.170
I don't even know if I knew the connotation mentor,

371
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:58.760
but I looked at king more as,
as someone,

372
00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.220
as a teacher,
someone that could learn from.

373
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.040
So as we fast forward,

374
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:07.610
and I'm now working at Nike and in my office,

375
00:24:07.611 --> 00:24:12.611
I had had this picture in my office and it was a headshot of Martin Luther King,

376
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:19.100
James Baldwin in Malcolm X.
And so when people would come into my office,

377
00:24:19.101 --> 00:24:23.480
they would look at the things on the wall and they would always be drawn to
that,

378
00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:28.010
the portrait.
And so they,
what was interesting,

379
00:24:28.011 --> 00:24:32.210
most people,
uh,
I would say 99% of the people could,

380
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.990
could not tell you all three of them.
A lot of people would get king,

381
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.650
some would get James Baldwin,
very few Malcolm X.
But,
uh,

382
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:42.590
it was rare to anyone got all three of them.

383
00:24:42.591 --> 00:24:46.510
So they would ask me why I had it up there.
And I said,
uh,
they're,

384
00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:49.130
they're my mentors during my inspiration.

385
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:51.600
They're the people that I,

386
00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.630
whose lives I look to when I'm trying to figure out something complex.

387
00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:01.460
And so while I didn't have a day to day relationship with,

388
00:25:01.461 --> 00:25:06.080
with Dr. King,
I had a mental uh,

389
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:09.020
day to day relationship month to month,
week to week,

390
00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:12.890
year to year because there was so much that I wanted to learn from him.

391
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:18.370
And one thing while it's in my mind I'd like to share with you and I don't know

392
00:25:18.561 --> 00:25:23.240
if the vast majority of people that follow King Nudist,

393
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:27.560
I just found out this past week and reading a book review in The New York Times

394
00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:32.650
Book Review Section that when Dr. King was in seminary at Crozier,

395
00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:35.330
which is in Chester,
Pennsylvania,
that's where he,
he,

396
00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.910
he took his practice to become a preacher a that dot.

397
00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:44.840
They had a basketball team and Dr. King was on the team.
And so that,

398
00:25:44.841 --> 00:25:48.020
that delighted me to no end to discover that he,
that he,

399
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.290
he played basketball during the time and the,

400
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:55.520
the person who wrote the book actually found in the Archives of box score from

401
00:25:55.521 --> 00:25:56.990
one of their games and hunt.

402
00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:01.610
Fortunately they got wax one 24 to 41.
So,

403
00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:07.130
but I was so pleased to find out that there was an athletic side to him and I

404
00:26:07.131 --> 00:26:11.720
don't know,
uh,
it and all that I've read about king over the years.

405
00:26:11.721 --> 00:26:15.780
I had never known that he participated in athletics.
So I was there was,
uh,

406
00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:20.780
an immediate joy the find out that he,
and particularly they play basketball.

407
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.950
And when you say you had a relationship with say,

408
00:26:24.951 --> 00:26:29.690
Dr. King in the sense that you viewed him as a mentor or role model and you

409
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.890
revisited that,

410
00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.760
and would you find yourself in specific situations and ask yourself,
you know,

411
00:26:34.761 --> 00:26:39.380
what would Dr. King do or how did,
how did that fit in your life,

412
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.860
uh,
from a mentorship standpoint?

413
00:26:42.861 --> 00:26:46.170
Was just putting yourself in their shoes to make hard decisions?

414
00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:50.130
Or how did you think,
I think one thing that,
that,
uh,

415
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:55.160
became quickly apparent to me was that the value in and of words and,

416
00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:03.360
and,
and the spoken word is such a,
a powerful tool,

417
00:27:03.361 --> 00:27:08.110
perhaps,
maybe more powerful than the atom bomb in many ways.
Uh,

418
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.580
the fact that,
uh,
that he had a vision,

419
00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:14.580
it was the whole,
I have a dream.

420
00:27:14.581 --> 00:27:17.220
So all great leaders I believe,

421
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.670
share a vision and then they,
they then,
uh,

422
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:26.330
then they have a journey.
And so he talked about the division,

423
00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.850
the journey,
uh,
the completion of the dream and,
and,

424
00:27:29.851 --> 00:27:34.170
and the conquering of injustice.
But to me,
king was,

425
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.500
was so many things.
He was a preacher,

426
00:27:37.501 --> 00:27:41.910
he was a messenger area visionary.
He was a,
a precursor,

427
00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:44.330
a leader.
He,
he,

428
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:49.170
he was a man for all seasons and all reasons in,
in,
in many ways.

429
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:54.420
And so many times I,
I reflect back on something that he,

430
00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:59.310
he said that when not when I'm in a tough spot and I think about giving up,

431
00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.280
uh,
you said to yourself this,
uh,

432
00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.850
what kind of sacrifices this is going to be.

433
00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.780
And one thing I remember Dr. King saying,
there's,

434
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:13.140
if a man or a woman hasn't found something in life that they're willing to die

435
00:28:13.141 --> 00:28:15.900
for,
then perhaps they're not fit to live.

436
00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:19.560
And so he lives out that,
that,

437
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:24.590
that a reality that he became so deeply immersed in.

438
00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:25.310
And,

439
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:30.120
and this mission that he ultimately had to give us his,

440
00:28:30.121 --> 00:28:31.110
his life for it.

441
00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:36.560
And I watched a number of documentaries over the years and on the sit ins and

442
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:41.340
doing the,
the depth of segregation.

443
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:46.910
And one was the night before that they were going to sit at the lunch counters.

444
00:28:47.761 --> 00:28:49.170
And,
and,
uh,
the,

445
00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:53.610
the person who was leading the demonstration as they were planning out at

446
00:28:53.611 --> 00:28:57.150
strategically at the end,
he said to them,
he said,

447
00:28:57.151 --> 00:29:01.830
I want everybody in the room to look around at each other and shake hands

448
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:04.650
because tomorrow night when we have this meeting,

449
00:29:04.651 --> 00:29:09.180
some of you are not going to be here.
And I thought to myself,
oh my God,

450
00:29:09.181 --> 00:29:14.181
would I have the courage of commitment to know that if I were part of this

451
00:29:15.061 --> 00:29:18.240
demonstration tomorrow night,
I might get,

452
00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:20.280
I have to put my life on the line.

453
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:24.120
I might not be back if I'm sitting in that room.
I have to say to myself,

454
00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:29.220
are you willing to sacrifice your life for this cause?
And,

455
00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:30.540
and to me,

456
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:35.750
a lot of the untold stories about segregation and,

457
00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.450
and,

458
00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:42.370
and the injustices that black people have faced most of our lives is those

459
00:29:42.371 --> 00:29:46.660
people who died so that we can enjoy,
uh,

460
00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:52.180
the things that we enjoy in society today.
And,
and,
uh,

461
00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:54.710
so to me,
uh,

462
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.170
whenever I have any questions about the depth of commitment,

463
00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.930
I go back and I say to myself,

464
00:30:01.931 --> 00:30:06.520
do you feel so strong about this that you'd be willing to give your life?

465
00:30:06.521 --> 00:30:08.380
What do you feel this strong about it?

466
00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.970
That you would be willing to risk getting fired?
And,
and over the years,

467
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:14.410
especially when I was at Nike,

468
00:30:14.411 --> 00:30:19.411
sometimes I had a depth of belief and conviction that what I was suggesting was

469
00:30:19.721 --> 00:30:23.950
right and I was willing to fight right down to the end.

470
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.980
And if it meant I got fired,
then I got fired.

471
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:32.250
But I never allowed the position or to threaten me to be less than what I should

472
00:30:35.561 --> 00:30:36.550
be as a person.

473
00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:42.030
You mentioned your grandmother in passing and she seems to have been a very

474
00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:46.010
important figure in,
in your life.
Uh,

475
00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:51.060
how did that come to be the case?
Well,
my grandma was,

476
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:55.470
it was basically a,
if I can borrow a religious,
uh,

477
00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:59.530
concept,
my grandmother was the pope,
her word was infallible.

478
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:01.540
And what was interesting,

479
00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:06.400
my grandma's a product of a Blackfoot Indian tribe.

480
00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:11.350
And on both sides of our family,
we really are,
are descendants of,
of,

481
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.450
of a American Indian tribes.

482
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:18.940
And which I find interesting sometime because of the,
we now I've gone through,

483
00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:23.290
uh,
these,
these connotations,
uh,
when I was,

484
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:27.020
when I was a a firstborn,

485
00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.840
which you'll find interesting.
I was born in a segregated hospital in Washington,

486
00:31:31.841 --> 00:31:36.310
DC,
Garfield Hospital.
And there are four floors for whites and one for,

487
00:31:36.311 --> 00:31:37.240
for black.
So,

488
00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:42.100
so I came into the world and in a segregated world.
But,

489
00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:46.780
um,
so as,
as,
as I was growing up,

490
00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:50.050
um,
when I was nine,

491
00:31:50.051 --> 00:31:52.810
my dad died and when I was 13,

492
00:31:52.811 --> 00:31:57.640
my mom had a nervous breakdown and she was institutionalized the rest of her

493
00:31:57.641 --> 00:32:00.800
life.
In those days,
uh,
the,

494
00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:06.160
the economy was,
was in poor shape.
So you got rations from the government,

495
00:32:06.161 --> 00:32:10.030
you got like flour,
sugar,
milk,
so forth.

496
00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:15.130
And so I come home one day and my mom standing at the sink and she's got the

497
00:32:15.131 --> 00:32:19.480
water running and she's pouring this big bag of sugar into the sink and just

498
00:32:19.481 --> 00:32:24.370
letting the sugar go down.
And so I,
I grabbed it in,
turned it off,
and I,

499
00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:29.290
and,
uh,
I said,
mom,
what's going on?
She wasn't,
she just,
she was incoherent.

500
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:33.970
So anyway,
my mom ended up being institutionalized.
So now here,

501
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.940
here's George at 13 years old and uh,
uh,
no,

502
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.550
I was 12 and in,
so what do you do with George?
He has no,
he has,

503
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:48.200
he has no parental supervision.
Dad's dead.
Mom's in a mental institution.

504
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.870
And she spent most of the rest of her life there.

505
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:56.120
And so my grandma worked for this white family and Georgetown.

506
00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:00.740
And so she was sharing with the lady to house this dilemma.

507
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:05.690
And so she,
and she was sent,
I don't know,
I don't know what,
what I'm going to do,

508
00:33:05.691 --> 00:33:07.760
but I have to do something for them.

509
00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:10.820
And so the lady said to her daughter was,

510
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:15.880
was ahead of Catholic charities and DC and she would mention it to her.

511
00:33:16.521 --> 00:33:20.310
Maybe her daughter could suit,
do something.
So Lo and behold,

512
00:33:20.311 --> 00:33:23.600
the daughter decides to what she,
she's going to help.

513
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.590
And so she found the school,
a boarding school for me,

514
00:33:27.591 --> 00:33:31.430
a Catholic boarding school in Pennsylvania was called Saint Michael's school for

515
00:33:31.431 --> 00:33:35.090
boys.
It was,
and so you,
you,
uh,

516
00:33:35.091 --> 00:33:37.770
she was able to get me into the school.
There.
You,

517
00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.280
you stayed there year round as a resident.

518
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.590
And so I went off to St Michael's and,
uh,
the structure where priests were,

519
00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:46.880
we're at,
uh,

520
00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:51.970
ran the institution and the teaching and the service part.

521
00:33:52.131 --> 00:33:55.820
We're done all by nuns.
And so,
uh,

522
00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.120
over the course of the time I was there,

523
00:33:59.121 --> 00:34:03.560
I did everything from Bale Hay to pick apples,
a clean chicken coops,

524
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:08.840
uh,
to work in the kitchen,
the scrub,
the floors in the chapel to make,

525
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:13.700
to make beds,
you had to do a chore to help,
uh,
uh,

526
00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.250
offset your,
your presence there.

527
00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:21.670
And so the classes were very strict and rigorous that the classes were small.

528
00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:26.870
So we got a lot of individual attention and um,

529
00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:31.340
it was,
it was just a stroke of,
of,
of,

530
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:36.430
of a miracle that my grandma was able to get me into this situation.

531
00:34:38.091 --> 00:34:42.950
And she,
my grandma never graduated from high school.

532
00:34:42.951 --> 00:34:47.030
In fact,
no one in my family,
uh,
my mom and dad finished high school,

533
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:53.050
but she knew that there had to be a better way for me and she did everything

534
00:34:54.831 --> 00:34:59.090
that she could to help me grow as a person.

535
00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:02.030
I remember one one one time Tim,

536
00:35:02.031 --> 00:35:06.950
my grandma took myself and my brother out and uh,
and she said,
uh,

537
00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:11.000
we're going to go outside.
I want to teach you some,
some manners and lessons.

538
00:35:11.001 --> 00:35:15.470
And so my,
my grandma takes him,
my brother and I out on the street and she says,

539
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:20.060
I'm going to start to teach you how to treat women.
Women are to be respected.

540
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:24.560
And so she's,
she says,
when you walked down the street,

541
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:29.780
you always walk on the outside.
A woman always walks on the inside.
When you,

542
00:35:29.781 --> 00:35:32.900
when you,
when you get to the corner,

543
00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.840
you make sure you check the traffic in both ways.

544
00:35:35.841 --> 00:35:40.260
Before and then walk as more as a guard.
Uh,
if,

545
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:44.460
if a woman's getting a new car,
you always open the door for them first.

546
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:47.230
If you sit down at a table for the meal though,

547
00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:50.370
you hold the cheer and help them.

548
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:55.560
And so long before feminists,
uh,
a movement was,

549
00:35:55.810 --> 00:36:00.330
was even thought of,
my grandmother was teaching us social graces.

550
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:05.580
Um,
yes sir.
No,
sir.
I go on a flight now and,

551
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:09.880
and it's just part of my DNA.
Uh,

552
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:14.820
when people say some store to says something,
I say,
yes ma'am.
No ma'am,
no ma'am.

553
00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:19.350
Yes sir.
No Sir.
And I'm 80 years old and I still do that.
But so,

554
00:36:19.351 --> 00:36:20.340
and verbally,

555
00:36:20.341 --> 00:36:24.660
what will happen on the flight is either during the flight or at the end,

556
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:28.740
the stewardess will say to me,
it,
can I ask you a question now?
Say yes,

557
00:36:28.741 --> 00:36:33.720
and I know it's coming.
And they'll say,
are you,
uh,
are you,
uh,
from the military?

558
00:36:33.721 --> 00:36:38.250
And I say,
well,
I was in the military,
but,
but no,
I'm not in the military now.
And,

559
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.820
and they said,
why are you from the south?
And I said,
no.
And so I said,

560
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.760
why do you ask?
And they say,
well,
because you're so polite.

561
00:36:44.761 --> 00:36:48.620
No one says yes ma'am and no sir.
And I have a lot of people now who,

562
00:36:48.621 --> 00:36:51.780
who find it uncomfortable.
If I say yes sir,

563
00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.000
at 80 years old and they're younger than me,

564
00:36:54.001 --> 00:36:58.240
but it's just the way I was born,
my grandma was,

565
00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:01.500
was huge on manners.
And if we went somewhere,

566
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.460
and there were adults there in those days,
if you were a child,

567
00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.830
kids where to be seen and not heard.
And so it,
if,

568
00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:12.210
if there was a conversation going on again with the adults,

569
00:37:12.211 --> 00:37:14.610
you just listen and,
but if,

570
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:18.690
if someone asks me a question and I didn't say yes ma'am and no ma'am,

571
00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:22.520
when I got home,
my grandma would say,
I heard Mr. Jenkins asked you that and you,

572
00:37:22.521 --> 00:37:26.400
you,
you just said yeah.
And she said,
Ben Dover and she,
she whipped me.

573
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:31.140
And so,
and my greatest quote for my grandma was,

574
00:37:31.141 --> 00:37:33.330
she told me one time,
she said,

575
00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:38.120
there's more horses asses in the world and there are horses now.
That's all.

576
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:39.550
That's been my favorite grandma.

577
00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:44.040
She's a good teacher and good enforcer.

578
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:47.783
Well,

579
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:53.990
were there any other mentors during that or teachers or people who had a strong

580
00:37:54.691 --> 00:37:59.190
impact on you over that stay in that Catholic school?
Yeah,

581
00:37:59.191 --> 00:38:03.630
it was sister that was a nun who took a liking to me,
named sister Dolores.

582
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:08.110
She,
she lived to be 87,
but she,
she,

583
00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:13.140
for some reason,
she saw something in me I never saw in myself.

584
00:38:13.141 --> 00:38:18.141
And she would always say positive things to me.

585
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:22.140
At the time I didn't realize the value of them,

586
00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:26.820
but she'd always say to me,
George,
you can be special.
Or,

587
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:27.900
uh,

588
00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:32.490
or if I wasn't working up to my potential in whatever area it was,

589
00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:36.140
she would say,
and that's not being special and you were,
you,

590
00:38:36.141 --> 00:38:39.490
you're on earth to be special and night to me.

591
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.770
I'd never had anybody look at me and,
and,
and,
and,

592
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:47.100
and make me think I could be anything other than,
than average.
But she,

593
00:38:47.101 --> 00:38:52.101
she constantly preached that to me and she would watch the basketball games and,

594
00:38:52.621 --> 00:38:57.400
and,
and after she would come up,
or the next day in class,
she would say,
well,

595
00:38:57.401 --> 00:39:00.100
you know,
in the third quarter,
you,
you,
you,
you really,

596
00:39:00.101 --> 00:39:01.700
you really were loafing out there.

597
00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:08.060
But she always found a way to,
to,
uh,
uh,

598
00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:13.000
I write a paper and she'd read it and she'd say,
this is really good,

599
00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:15.520
but this is not your best stuff.
You can do better than.

600
00:39:15.521 --> 00:39:19.320
So she always kind of created this contest of,
uh,

601
00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:22.420
having me compete,
compete against myself.

602
00:39:22.421 --> 00:39:27.370
It was never competing against the other students as always me competing against

603
00:39:27.371 --> 00:39:28.930
myself.
So she,

604
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:33.900
she taught me that the power of,
of,
of,

605
00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:39.080
of positive have a positive attitude and she would never allow me to think

606
00:39:39.161 --> 00:39:43.360
negatively.
And then the other person was my college.
Oh,
was my high school coach.

607
00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:44.533
Uh,

608
00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:49.620
he taught me so many lessons about life at our school.

609
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:54.310
They were forced sports,
boxing,
baseball,
basketball,
and football.

610
00:39:54.311 --> 00:39:58.120
And so one of the things that you learned,
if you wanted to get off campus,

611
00:39:58.121 --> 00:40:01.060
some you,
you,
you,
you,
you participate in sports.

612
00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:06.090
And so I actually participated in every one and the one that probably gets a

613
00:40:06.491 --> 00:40:10.480
zero attention because a lot of people just don't know what's boxing.

614
00:40:10.481 --> 00:40:14.020
I actually box golden glove really years.
Yeah.
I,

615
00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:19.290
I know you were Chinese foot boxing so you can probably identify with that,

616
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:23.980
but I wouldn't want to deal with your reach.
And so I actually,

617
00:40:23.981 --> 00:40:25.870
somewhere in one of my high school scrapbooks,

618
00:40:25.871 --> 00:40:30.080
I have a picture of me and a ring in those days you wear the head gear and he

619
00:40:30.081 --> 00:40:35.020
had a big laugh,
big gloves.
And so I fought in my weight class.

620
00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:39.910
Oh,
it's at that time I wish I was a under 200 pounds now.
But,

621
00:40:39.911 --> 00:40:42.690
uh,
so I,
I actually won my,

622
00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:46.780
my senior year I won the golden glove event.
And so,
uh,

623
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.880
and then I played baseball.

624
00:40:48.881 --> 00:40:53.881
I played first base and pitched and in football I played in all except the last

625
00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:58.600
year.
And then,
uh,
we didn't have a good quarterback.

626
00:40:58.601 --> 00:41:03.390
So my coach put me at quarterback,
but I was,
believe me,
uh,
uh,

627
00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:07.360
the,
uh,
my talents word,
I wouldn't even have gotten a walk on offer,

628
00:41:07.361 --> 00:41:08.560
but I was the quarterback.

629
00:41:08.561 --> 00:41:13.561
And then what happened was basketball between my eighth grade year and ninth

630
00:41:14.891 --> 00:41:19.300
grade year,
I grew four inches.
So I went from six foot to six,

631
00:41:19.301 --> 00:41:20.440
four and one year.

632
00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:25.510
And so obviously the height advantage prove beneficial to me early on in

633
00:41:25.511 --> 00:41:28.630
basketball.
And so over the course of the four years,

634
00:41:28.631 --> 00:41:31.930
I got better and better and land looked back on it.

635
00:41:31.931 --> 00:41:36.290
Now a lot of it was sistered the Lorac encourage me,
kept telling me,
Oh,

636
00:41:36.291 --> 00:41:38.890
you're getting better,
or,
and,
and you.

637
00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.990
And so she kept me motivated all the time.

638
00:41:41.991 --> 00:41:46.640
So my senior year I ended up being the second leading scorer in the state of

639
00:41:46.641 --> 00:41:49.010
Pennsylvania.
And,
um,

640
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:54.980
so at this point,
uh,
let's just step back real quick.

641
00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:58.040
So at the end of my junior year,
I'm waiting.

642
00:41:58.041 --> 00:42:01.680
I'm waiting for to take the Greyhound bus back to DC for,

643
00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.980
I get a week vacation back in DC.

644
00:42:03.981 --> 00:42:08.480
So I'm sitting there waiting for the bus to come by.
And Tim,
I can remember,

645
00:42:08.481 --> 00:42:10.970
it was like yesterday,
I thought to myself,
God,

646
00:42:10.971 --> 00:42:15.140
if I can just graduate and become a pilot in the air force,
I'll have it made.

647
00:42:15.141 --> 00:42:19.160
I had no idea anything about basketball was going to take me and get me a

648
00:42:19.161 --> 00:42:19.791
scholarship.

649
00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:24.140
So the following year I ended up the second leading scorer in the state.

650
00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:29.210
And so we're playing at saint rose in Carbondale.
And after the game,

651
00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:34.130
when I come out of the locker room,
a gentleman comes up to me and he says,
hi,

652
00:42:34.131 --> 00:42:38.090
my name's Jack Ramsey.
I'm the coach at at Saint Joe College.

653
00:42:38.091 --> 00:42:41.920
And he hands me a a card of course,
Jack Ramsey in his,

654
00:42:41.921 --> 00:42:44.210
in the basketball hall of fame.
Great coach.

655
00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:48.740
And so he said that I like the way you play,

656
00:42:48.741 --> 00:42:51.560
we'd like to offer you a scholarship.
And I said,
yes sir.

657
00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:54.830
Every time he'd say something,
I just say yes sir.

658
00:42:54.831 --> 00:42:56.180
Cause I didn't know what else to say.

659
00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:01.430
And so on the school bus ride back to the school,

660
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:05.840
my,
uh,
coach says,
who's that man you're talking to outside the locker room?

661
00:43:05.841 --> 00:43:09.080
And I said he was a coach and I hand them to the card.
And so my coaches,
well,

662
00:43:09.081 --> 00:43:11.330
what did he tell you?
And I said,

663
00:43:11.331 --> 00:43:16.100
he said that he wanted to offer me a scholarship.
And so I said,
coach,

664
00:43:16.101 --> 00:43:19.640
what's the scholarship?
Because I had no idea what that you could,

665
00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:24.950
that they would pay for your education and return you participated in
basketball.

666
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:28.250
So then by over the course of the remainders season,

667
00:43:28.251 --> 00:43:32.240
I had an offer from a Michigan state,
Villanova and uh,

668
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:34.580
and Gettysburg and a bunch of those schools.

669
00:43:34.581 --> 00:43:39.470
But I add Gettysburg because their coach did the best job of recruiting me.

670
00:43:39.471 --> 00:43:42.740
He'd write me hand written letters,

671
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:47.180
four and five pages on what it was going to mean to go to Gettysburg and so

672
00:43:47.181 --> 00:43:50.630
forth.
He drive up to games.
He was so persistent.

673
00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:55.970
But at the end of the day to reality was just as far as the nuns and the priests

674
00:43:55.971 --> 00:43:59.850
were concern would,
it would've been,
it would've been heresy to go to,

675
00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:03.020
to a state institution.
I was going to a Catholic school.

676
00:44:03.021 --> 00:44:06.640
So then it basically came down to Saint Joseph,

677
00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:11.690
Villanova and I went down for the visit and vote at Villanova and why I was

678
00:44:12.171 --> 00:44:16.430
there.
They gave me admissions exam.
He didn't have PSA and act then.

679
00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:20.480
And so I took the admissions exam the first day I was there.

680
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:25.550
And once again,
amazing insight by sister Delores sheet.

681
00:44:25.551 --> 00:44:28.670
When she found out I was going to get scholarships offers,

682
00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:33.050
she started to make me stay after school every day and work on,

683
00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:37.760
on the entrance exams.
So,
uh,
so I was prepared and,
and I,

684
00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:42.390
and so the Sunday before we left the drive back up to hope and heights,

685
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:47.670
uh,
the coach Al severance offered me a scholarship and,
and the,

686
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:50.840
we wanted to decision why we were there.
So basically my,

687
00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:54.960
my high school coach made the decision.
He thought that that's where I should go.

688
00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:57.850
And,
and,
uh,
little did I know that,

689
00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:02.870
that basketball was going to be this transformative force in my life that was

690
00:45:03.331 --> 00:45:06.210
going to take me someplace.
I'd never thought that I could go,

691
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:10.290
Tim never in my life.
And I don't mean this in a mean spirited way.

692
00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:14.550
Did anyone in my family ever say to me,
George,
when you grow up,

693
00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:18.870
I want you to go to college.
It was,
date was no reason for them to think that

694
00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:24.540
at that time it was a,
uh,
it wasn't,

695
00:45:24.541 --> 00:45:29.541
it wasn't even a dream or our thought because nobody had had received that type

696
00:45:30.631 --> 00:45:34.770
of education and go back to my grandma's.

697
00:45:34.771 --> 00:45:39.771
So I call my grandma and I tell her what's going on and then I'm going to get

698
00:45:40.981 --> 00:45:45.910
this scholarship.
And so I,
I tell her,
uh,
uh,

699
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:47.400
well,
how does it work?
I said,
okay,

700
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:52.020
so if I agree to play on the basketball team for the four years,

701
00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:55.070
they'll,
they'll pay for my education.
So my Gr,

702
00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:58.290
so all of a sudden there's utter silence on the phone.

703
00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:03.360
And I said,
grandma,
are you still there?
And she said,
yes.
I said,

704
00:46:03.361 --> 00:46:07.860
why you so quiet?
She says,
oh,
I just feel like a failure.
I said,
well,

705
00:46:07.861 --> 00:46:11.640
what do you mean?
And she said,
I thought I raised you better than that.

706
00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:16.770
And I said,
well,
grandma,
what did I do wrong?
And she said,
stupid.

707
00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:18.143
Don't white people going,

708
00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:22.890
going to give you a free education to play basketball?
You,

709
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:23.730
how can you go?

710
00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:28.080
How could you be so stupid to believe she could not comprehend that?

711
00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:33.110
That because of the racial situation that someone would pay for your education

712
00:46:33.691 --> 00:46:36.920
and all you had to do was play basketball.
And she,
she just,

713
00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:42.020
it took her over a year before she fully was able to even trust that this was

714
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:48.510
when I finally got on campus at Villanova and went to the first class then.

715
00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:51.250
Then she,
she kind of started to,

716
00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:55.590
to be a lot more trustful of the process.
But,

717
00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.610
uh,
it was,
uh,

718
00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:04.750
I look back on it now and it just shows you the depth and of a stain of,

719
00:47:05.561 --> 00:47:09.360
of racism and how things are,
uh,

720
00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:14.430
are implanted in your mind that you just,
you just can't there in comprehensible.

721
00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:18.540
So on that,
on that note,
when I was doing homework,

722
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:23.550
I read somewhere that you have a collection of racist,
momentous,
yes.

723
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:28.140
How you did do some research.
Could you I,
beyond that,

724
00:47:28.141 --> 00:47:29.070
I don't know the details,

725
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:32.710
but that just stuck in my mind and cause that's something I think that a lot of

726
00:47:32.711 --> 00:47:36.490
people would actively avoid.
So why do you have this collection?
Well,

727
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:41.290
first of all,
I,
uh,
you know,
no one's ever asked me that question,

728
00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:42.124
but I spent,

729
00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:47.250
I probably have over $100,000 worth of black collectibles for about eight or

730
00:47:48.881 --> 00:47:51.700
nine years.
It became an obsession with me.

731
00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:56.120
And so I would go to antique shows and,
and,
and,
and,

732
00:47:56.170 --> 00:48:00.100
and go to stores and hunt down all black memorabilia.

733
00:48:00.101 --> 00:48:05.101
I have things that date back before I actually have a first edition or uncle

734
00:48:05.261 --> 00:48:09.510
Tom's cabin.
So I started to collect books,
fingerings,

735
00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:15.010
and postcards,
postcards that was started with finger rings.

736
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:20.080
And so I,
um,
I,
I've,
a friend of mine told me about a,

737
00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:20.923
um,

738
00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:25.930
an antique store that was closing and the gentleman had a huge collection of

739
00:48:25.931 --> 00:48:30.770
black collectibles.
And so it was in San Pedro.
So I went down and I,

740
00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:34.960
and I paid him $35,000 for the collectables.
He had a war,

741
00:48:34.961 --> 00:48:35.830
a hundred pieces.

742
00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:40.090
And part of the deal was that he had the mark and write a little card.

743
00:48:40.091 --> 00:48:44.560
So I understand the historic significance of postcards.

744
00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:47.500
Tim,
I have him back before you had,

745
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:52.240
which this might surprise you that originally that you didn't have to put a

746
00:48:52.241 --> 00:48:55.630
stamp on,
on a postcard to send it out to mail.
So I have,

747
00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:59.600
I have them back in.
The earliest one I have is,

748
00:48:59.601 --> 00:49:01.430
is 1891.
Wow.

749
00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:06.570
But what was interesting about the black postcards was they always made blacks,

750
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:12.580
uh,
uh,
they pictured him in a derogatory term.

751
00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:17.750
One of the more frequent ones you see is a black person with,
uh,

752
00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:22.050
eating watermelon with a smile on his face.
Um,

753
00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:24.340
but there were all derogatory.

754
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:29.520
Now here's what's further interesting on we've now,

755
00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:31.780
um,
you put stamps on them.

756
00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:37.030
So I was able to read the messages on some of them.
And,
and,
uh,

757
00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:41.170
and so the one that I remembered the most is a ladies right into one of her

758
00:49:41.171 --> 00:49:45.040
girlfriends and we'll just make up the name.
She says,
Helen,

759
00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:48.700
we have a Nigga that works at our house that smells just like him.

760
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:51.490
And so in those days,

761
00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:56.180
to use the word nigger was commonplace.
Uh,
uh,

762
00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:59.670
and you just,
uh,

763
00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:02.530
I don't know that you ever learn to accept it,

764
00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.560
but it w it was something that was said commonplace.

765
00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:10.200
So I started to build this historic collection of,
of,

766
00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:15.260
of memorabilia so that I could have a legacy for my children and their children

767
00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:18.820
and I could,

768
00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:24.010
I have them on display at my home to remind me of,
uh,
of,

769
00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:27.830
of where we were and where we are today and,

770
00:50:27.831 --> 00:50:31.100
and the trials and tribulations that we've gone through.

771
00:50:31.101 --> 00:50:36.000
So I easily have postcards.
I,

772
00:50:36.001 --> 00:50:41.001
I probably have over 300 and postcards and I probably have about 500 of the,

773
00:50:42.171 --> 00:50:46.070
uh,
uh,
figurines.
I was just thinking me,
cause I have some,

774
00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:50.930
I have some original Angia Mama,
uh,
uh,
flower part,

775
00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:55.190
uh,
packs.
And that I,
once I got going,

776
00:50:55.191 --> 00:50:59.940
it was amazing that things that I was able to,
to collect.
And um,

777
00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:04.610
so I had so many of them that I couldn't put them all on display.

778
00:51:04.611 --> 00:51:09.020
So I have probably three quarters of them are boxed up in storage,
but,

779
00:51:09.021 --> 00:51:11.810
and then the others are,
are,
are around my house.

780
00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:16.280
Do you collect anything else or have you collected anything else?
Uh,

781
00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:21.140
books and friends.
Uh,
I,
uh,

782
00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:27.240
in my library at home I have well over 2,500 books and probably have another,

783
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:32.300
uh,
six or 700 [inaudible] that are,

784
00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:36.470
that are in storage because it just ran out of a space.
But I,

785
00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:41.330
I just couldn't tenue to,
uh,
buy books to read them.

786
00:51:41.331 --> 00:51:43.940
I have as you probably research,

787
00:51:43.941 --> 00:51:48.650
I have an unusual way of going about reading books,
but,
uh,
and,

788
00:51:48.651 --> 00:51:50.150
and,
and,
and friends,

789
00:51:50.151 --> 00:51:55.151
I don't have a strategy or anything for a friend's that most times people when I

790
00:51:57.050 --> 00:52:01.970
meet them or not,
who they ended up being,
whether it was Phil Knight,
Bob Knight,

791
00:52:01.971 --> 00:52:06.260
John Thompson,
Sonny Vaccaro,
I could tell you tons of people when I met him,

792
00:52:06.261 --> 00:52:08.150
they were not who they ended up being.

793
00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:13.720
But for some reason we were able to build an authentic and sustainable

794
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:16.460
relationship.

795
00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:21.350
And I've always looked upon relationships as a privileged,

796
00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:24.830
uh,
that you and,
and you,
at the end of the day,

797
00:52:24.831 --> 00:52:29.360
at the core of all relationships in my mind is trust and respect.

798
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:33.950
And so both of those have to be earned.
And so over the years,
uh,

799
00:52:33.951 --> 00:52:38.951
I've met people and unintentionally we've stayed in touch and there's been this

800
00:52:39.681 --> 00:52:42.360
level of trust that,
uh,

801
00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:46.970
that's allowed to the,
the relationship to endure.

802
00:52:46.971 --> 00:52:50.870
But it's something that slot like marriage.
You have to work at it.
You have to,

803
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:55.660
to,
to,
to understand that there's a balance in relationships.

804
00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:58.400
And with me,
I,

805
00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:03.410
I'm the number one thing that I asked myself continually is what can I do for,

806
00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:11.630
for you?
And,
uh,
your,
your good friend Ryan holiday.

807
00:53:11.631 --> 00:53:15.890
And I had dinner last night and one of the very last things I said to him,

808
00:53:15.891 --> 00:53:19.730
I said,
Ryan,
is there anything I can be doing for you in the next 30 days?

809
00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:24.530
I've always had this theory that if you help enough people get what they want,

810
00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.220
you'll always get what you want.

811
00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:31.550
And so I've never tried to enter a relationship based on selfish mode,

812
00:53:33.001 --> 00:53:37.940
is that if I notice person,
I'm going to get these benefits.
I saw,

813
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:41.700
I tried to find out what do we have in common as people,

814
00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:43.620
what is it that we can share?

815
00:53:43.621 --> 00:53:48.621
How can I help this person no matter how famous they are or how successful they

816
00:53:49.081 --> 00:53:49.800
are,

817
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:54.800
everyone has certain needs even if they're just psychological needs or,

818
00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:59.160
or we all need truth tellers in our life.
And so,
um,

819
00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:01.350
and building relationships,

820
00:54:01.351 --> 00:54:05.540
I try to make sure that I surround myself with people who,

821
00:54:05.541 --> 00:54:09.570
who want to see me become better and can help me become better,

822
00:54:09.571 --> 00:54:14.100
that I can learn from them and,
and then I can contribute to their lives.

823
00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:17.050
And so,
um,
most of the,

824
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:21.360
the friendships I have in life,
they,
they all started by,

825
00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:26.310
by mistake.
Uh,
you wanted a young men that,
that's here today,

826
00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:31.440
uh,
that is taught me almost all I know about technology.

827
00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:36.540
I spoke at a clinic and,
and,
and Orlando and I,
so,

828
00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:41.070
uh,
a friend of mine,
Kevin Eastman was running the clinic and,
uh,

829
00:54:41.071 --> 00:54:42.830
I said to him,
I said,
who's going to,

830
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:45.990
who's going to put my presentation up on the screen in that?

831
00:54:45.991 --> 00:54:50.790
Do you have a it guy?
And he said,
yes.
And so,
so I said,
well,

832
00:54:50.791 --> 00:54:53.610
introduce him to me because I want put my presentation up.

833
00:54:53.611 --> 00:54:58.140
I went to walk to the back of the room and make sure it's clear and so forth.
So,

834
00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:03.060
so,
uh,
I met Alex of Rca and,
and,
uh,

835
00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:07.500
during the time I was there,
uh,
we just hit it off.
And so when he,
I,

836
00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:11.360
I'm pretty sure he was taking me back to the airport and I asked him if he,

837
00:55:11.361 --> 00:55:15.210
if he would be interested in doing a website for me.
And he said yes.

838
00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:20.280
And so that's how it started.
And it's turned into a lifelong friendship.

839
00:55:20.281 --> 00:55:21.570
And,
um,

840
00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:27.830
and I think that was the start of me recognizing that I needed to be around more

841
00:55:29.581 --> 00:55:34.220
young people.
And so I,
I don't associate,
and I,

842
00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:37.950
maybe it's bad to say this,
but I don't hang out with many people my own age.

843
00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:42.980
Most of the people that I associate with are our younger people because I think

844
00:55:43.351 --> 00:55:45.180
they're the future.
They're smart.

845
00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:49.950
They're naive enough that they'll tell you the truth and,
and,
uh,

846
00:55:49.951 --> 00:55:52.800
and they're not afraid to tell you if they think you're wrong.

847
00:55:53.310 --> 00:55:55.530
And when I hang around people my own age,

848
00:55:55.531 --> 00:56:00.480
it tends to always revert back to the past.
And,
and so,

849
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:04.680
and I don't want to talk about coaching at Washington state of being the first

850
00:56:04.681 --> 00:56:08.120
black this or the first black.
That what I want to do is,

851
00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:12.780
is figure out at 80 years old,
what is it that I don't know,

852
00:56:12.781 --> 00:56:17.070
but need to know and how is this going to help me stay relevant in this ever

853
00:56:17.071 --> 00:56:18.150
changing world?

854
00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:23.480
And so I've tend to spend most of my time with younger people who inspire me,

855
00:56:24.671 --> 00:56:29.250
who,
who I can,
uh,
and have,
uh,
uh,
a partnership with.

856
00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:31.540
That's the other thing about relationships.

857
00:56:31.541 --> 00:56:36.040
I think relationships at their most authentic stage.
It,

858
00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:40.060
it's a partnership.
It's,
it's,
uh,
we,
we share,

859
00:56:40.061 --> 00:56:44.860
we share common vision,
common goals,
common objectives,
common strategy,

860
00:56:44.861 --> 00:56:49.180
common execution plan.
It's a we mentality.

861
00:56:49.181 --> 00:56:53.740
It's not a me went out mentality and it's a win win mentality.

862
00:56:53.741 --> 00:56:58.720
It's not I win,
you lose or you lose.
I win.
It's not about that.

863
00:56:58.721 --> 00:57:02.230
We would,
we were in this thing together and we're in the boat together.

864
00:57:02.231 --> 00:57:05.450
We're going to row in the same direction and we're going to take,

865
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:06.420
get the boat ashore.

866
00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.660
<v 1>You mentioned books and uh,</v>

867
00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:15.890
I want to make sure we give reading at least a few minutes because you are known

868
00:57:17.611 --> 00:57:19.740
as a voracious reader,

869
00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:22.710
the human Google one nickname,

870
00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:28.290
and you've read probably,
I'm sure,
thousands of books at this point.
Uh,

871
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:33.430
you were very kind when we first got here where we're recording this right now.

872
00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:36.180
You said,
I learned from the,
uh,
the wise men.

873
00:57:36.181 --> 00:57:38.730
It's always a good thing to bear gifts or something along those lines.

874
00:57:38.731 --> 00:57:42.720
And you gave me several books.
He's also gifted many,
many different books.
Uh,

875
00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:45.090
how did this love affair with books start?

876
00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:47.940
And could you tell us about how you read books?

877
00:57:47.941 --> 00:57:51.480
Because as you alluded to earlier,
you have a particular way of reading books.

878
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:56.280
Well,
as I look back on it now,
Tim,
uh,

879
00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:59.670
and the point of references so many times as we speak,

880
00:57:59.671 --> 00:58:04.110
is always going to be my grandma.
Well,
my grandma told me one time,

881
00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:09.670
<v 2>she used to s when she'd be in the Kitchen Cook and she tells me stories.</v>

882
00:58:09.671 --> 00:58:12.700
And one time my grandma told me,
she said,
George,
you know,

883
00:58:12.701 --> 00:58:16.230
back in the days of slavery to plantation owners use to,

884
00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:19.650
to put their money in books and,
and,
and hide them up on this,

885
00:58:19.810 --> 00:58:23.440
put them up on the bookshelves as because of their banking system,

886
00:58:23.441 --> 00:58:28.270
wasn't as sophisticated as it is today.
And so I said,
well,
grandma,
why,

887
00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:30.070
why did they do that?
And she said,

888
00:58:30.071 --> 00:58:34.600
because they didn't have to worry about the slave stealing the money because the

889
00:58:34.601 --> 00:58:38.530
slaves would never take the books off the shelf because they couldn't read.

890
00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:40.840
And so from that,

891
00:58:40.841 --> 00:58:45.841
I began to understand that as long as someone can control your mind,

892
00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:51.850
they can control who you are in your body.
And so I,

893
00:58:51.851 --> 00:58:56.851
I decided that I was never going to allow myself to be in a position where,

894
00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:00.330
uh,
someone can cook,

895
00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:05.360
control my mind and control my body because of my lack of information and

896
00:59:05.381 --> 00:59:06.214
knowledge.
And,

897
00:59:06.610 --> 00:59:11.610
and so I decided that I was going to try to reheat and learn as much as I

898
00:59:12.611 --> 00:59:17.520
possibly could on a continual basis because I,

899
00:59:17.550 --> 00:59:19.410
I believe that,
uh,

900
00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:24.650
people will have a greater respect for you if,

901
00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:28.210
if they respect you and electrically,

902
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:31.220
and I've often felt in life if,

903
00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:36.320
if I had the choice between Tim Liking me or Tim respected me,

904
00:59:37.251 --> 00:59:39.800
I'd far more hope that,

905
00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:44.780
that you respect me then like me and I figured the byproduct of you respected me

906
00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:47.270
will be that you'll,
you'll learn to like me.

907
00:59:47.271 --> 00:59:51.140
So I don't work at trying to get people to like me.
So I've,

908
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:53.330
I've been on this mission for,

909
00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:58.590
for a reading for years and years and years and it's become an obsession now

910
01:00:00.471 --> 01:00:02.620
with me.
I,
I,
I,

911
01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:08.320
I don't go anywhere without a book and a notebook.

912
01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:12.440
And so if I'm,
if I'm in line,
if I go to a doctor's office,

913
01:00:12.441 --> 01:00:16.520
like take a book with me.
If I'm in the,
I have a new system now,

914
01:00:16.521 --> 01:00:18.220
if I go to a bookstore and I'm,

915
01:00:18.221 --> 01:00:21.830
and Barnes and noble and align has got eight or nine people in it,

916
01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:26.480
rather than stand there,
uh,
for 10 minutes waiting,
I start,

917
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:30.500
I'll start reading the book right there in line and start underlining things.

918
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:32.360
And,
uh,

919
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:37.480
so I have all these quirks that I've acquired over the years with reading books.

920
01:00:38.121 --> 01:00:41.030
First of all,
um,
um,

921
01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:44.180
I divide the book into messages.
I don't think,

922
01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:49.720
I don't spend any time now trying to read a whole book because there's probably

923
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:51.470
most books,

924
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:56.450
there's probably maybe eight to 10 chapters that are really powerful and

925
01:00:56.451 --> 01:01:00.050
influential.
Uh,
and,
and the others I skimmed through.

926
01:01:00.051 --> 01:01:04.580
So I never start a book from the front and,
and,
and,
and go to the back.

927
01:01:04.581 --> 01:01:05.414
I just go,

928
01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:09.860
I'll open the index and I'll find what I believe is an interesting chapter.

929
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:12.980
And I start there.
And that's actually how I purchase a book.

930
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:17.830
When I'm in the bookstore,
I have this routine that I go through that and,
and,

931
01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:22.100
and if the,
if passes,
I buy the book.
And if it doesn't,
I don't buy the book.

932
01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:26.180
And uh,
what's your routine?
So,
so if I,

933
01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:28.340
let's say I'm going to envision this one.

934
01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:31.580
So our officers as an Elsa Gundo,

935
01:01:31.581 --> 01:01:35.150
which is a s a s outside of Los Angeles and,

936
01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:37.430
and so I go to a Barnes and noble layer.

937
01:01:37.431 --> 01:01:42.431
One thing I found out that because there's so many corporate offices within a

938
01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:47.540
two mile radius that they tend to house a really excellent,

939
01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:52.550
uh,
business books.
So I'll go in and soon as I go in,
I go,

940
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:57.530
I look at the books that are on reduction sale to see if there's some something

941
01:01:57.531 --> 01:02:01.310
there that might be a good buy.
Then I go to the new roof,

942
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:06.320
new releases,
nonfiction.
And uh,
by the way,

943
01:02:06.321 --> 01:02:10.010
I go to,
I go to a bookstore four to five days out of the week.

944
01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:13.820
I'm constantly going in and I just call it search and discovery.

945
01:02:13.821 --> 01:02:17.890
So I'll go to new releases in a nonfiction and I'll look through the books and

946
01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:22.230
there's usually 20 books on the table.
I'd say eight out of 10 times,

947
01:02:22.231 --> 01:02:26.430
I'm going to find a book that,
that I had never heard of before.

948
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:31.530
And so I'll pick the book up,
I go to the back,

949
01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:33.360
I read about the author,

950
01:02:33.361 --> 01:02:37.380
and then I go to the front part and I read the promos down this side.

951
01:02:37.381 --> 01:02:40.740
And then the next thing I do is I go to the,
uh,

952
01:02:40.741 --> 01:02:45.741
the chapters and I find a chapter and I'll open it up and I'll see,

953
01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:50.140
uh,
it,
uh,
the writer's style,

954
01:02:50.141 --> 01:02:51.510
I look at the style.

955
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:56.130
Is this someone that says a book filled with a lot of statistics or stories

956
01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:58.950
because I know what I'm looking for.

957
01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:04.280
The books that I've have had the most impact are the ones that make me change

958
01:03:04.621 --> 01:03:09.300
the way I think or act or behave.
Uh,
and uh,

959
01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:12.900
those are the books that ultimately end up being the best for me.

960
01:03:12.901 --> 01:03:14.800
So I'll go through the book,
Eh,

961
01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:20.460
and then once I find this one chapter,
I start to read some of it and now,

962
01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:25.290
and I can tell if this is going to be me or not.
And at that point,
uh,

963
01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:26.820
I'll purchase the book,

964
01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:30.600
but I just don't go in and buy a book based on,

965
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:34.110
on the top 10.
Not that there's anything wrong with that,

966
01:03:34.111 --> 01:03:38.310
it's just that I've had better success.
And then,
uh,

967
01:03:38.311 --> 01:03:41.160
so now here at 80 years old,

968
01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:46.360
two of my favorite authors are Ryan holiday and Walter Isaacson.
Uh,

969
01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:50.520
they've both taken me on interesting and intellectual Jew journeys.

970
01:03:50.521 --> 01:03:55.430
The first book I read by Walter Isaacson was Steve Jobs.
And,
uh,

971
01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.030
I was so blown away.

972
01:03:57.031 --> 01:04:01.510
I had underlined about three quarters of the book.
I was quoting,

973
01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:04.740
writing down quotes.
And as you notice,

974
01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.290
Steve Jobs book couldn't be anything you want it to be.

975
01:04:07.291 --> 01:04:11.880
It can be a thesis on leadership.
It was just utterly fascinating.

976
01:04:11.881 --> 01:04:14.940
I'd loved Walter Isaacson's writing style.

977
01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:18.540
So when I finished the book,
I looked,
I went back,
I said,
damn,

978
01:04:18.541 --> 01:04:21.030
I liked the way that he writes.

979
01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:24.810
So I go back and I looked to see what else he had written.
And so I didn't,

980
01:04:24.811 --> 01:04:29.370
I see he's on a book on Benjamin Franklin.
He's done a book on,
uh,

981
01:04:29.371 --> 01:04:34.290
on Einstein.
So at the,
and subsequently Kissinger and others.
Uh,

982
01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:35.760
so I,

983
01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:40.850
I go to the bookstore and I buy the Benjamin Franklin book and I am blown away

984
01:04:41.221 --> 01:04:44.880
and a little sad because I feel like God damn,

985
01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:46.680
I went to all his education.

986
01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:50.730
No one ever taught me any of this stuff other than the kite.
Uh,

987
01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:52.320
and so before that,

988
01:04:52.321 --> 01:04:57.321
I think if you'd ask me who was the most important American of all time,

989
01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:01.800
I think I would have probably tended to say Abraham Lincoln.

990
01:05:01.801 --> 01:05:05.100
But after I read Isaacson's book on Benjamin Franklin,

991
01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:09.650
there was a,
I would now feel,
I mean,
you know,

992
01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:14.820
it's a lottery system that,
uh,
the banking schools,
streets,

993
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:16.140
uh,
the guy,

994
01:05:16.410 --> 01:05:20.110
he did so many unbelievable things.

995
01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.620
And then from there I went to,
to,
uh,

996
01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:27.850
Einstein and anybody who can write a book on Einstein debt,

997
01:05:27.851 --> 01:05:32.290
an idiot like me can understand the,
the,
the,
the,
uh,

998
01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:36.910
physics.
And,
and it was,
it was absolutely,
uh,

999
01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:43.620
it was a miracle.
So in the book,
Tim,
I Read,
uh,

1000
01:05:43.650 --> 01:05:48.650
that Einstein was very active in what they would capture in those times as the

1001
01:05:49.691 --> 01:05:50.800
Negro movement.

1002
01:05:51.130 --> 01:05:56.130
And it says that he wrote a book on Einstein in a Negro movement.

1003
01:05:56.321 --> 01:05:57.760
Well,
I had never heard of this.

1004
01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:03.060
So I immediately stop reading and go Google Einstein on the Negro problem.

1005
01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:08.170
And Lo and behold,
it comes up.
So I,
I chased the book down.

1006
01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:09.423
And,
um,

1007
01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:14.880
so what I find that a lot of times in reading books and is a in,

1008
01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:19.370
in,
in,
in,
in your book,
tools of the Titan.
I'm reading and I,

1009
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:22.810
and I see this you mentioned in there about masterminds,

1010
01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:25.540
and I had never heard of mastermind.
So I,

1011
01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:30.120
I a circle it and I write Google behind it.
So I go back and I go online and I,

1012
01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:34.860
and I,
uh,
and I find out loud.

1013
01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:37.090
So I'm thinking to myself,
oh my God,
how do you did,

1014
01:06:37.091 --> 01:06:40.660
I didn't ever knew about this.
So how do I,
how do I become part of it?

1015
01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:45.850
So I sent some information to Ryan holiday about,
about this mastermind.

1016
01:06:45.851 --> 01:06:49.600
So he gets back to me,
he says,
Oh,
I'm surprised you didn't know about that.

1017
01:06:49.601 --> 01:06:53.680
He says,
you want to go?
I'll get you in.
So the next thing I know,

1018
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:58.710
I get this invite to go to two masterminds and Carmel Valley and,

1019
01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:02.260
and my eight years on earth,

1020
01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:07.160
that was the greatest collection of intellects that I'd ever been around in my,

1021
01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:10.630
in my life.
I was so intimidated.
And what was marvelous.

1022
01:07:10.631 --> 01:07:14.770
That was when I knew I was on the right path because every,
I'm 80 years old,

1023
01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:18.820
the next oldest person there is probably 49.
They're all young,

1024
01:07:18.821 --> 01:07:23.420
energetic people.
And I,
I was,
I was,
uh,

1025
01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:27.940
readily admit,
I was so intimidated.
I didn't think I was thinking to myself,
God,

1026
01:07:27.941 --> 01:07:29.320
how am I going to fit in?

1027
01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:34.030
And every night I went to bed with the worst headaches that ever had.

1028
01:07:34.210 --> 01:07:37.570
Cause I was,
I couldn't process all this stuff.
I felt,

1029
01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:42.310
I thought his second day I've already filled up a notebook of notes.

1030
01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:46.510
And,
um,
it was one of those life changing experiences.

1031
01:07:46.511 --> 01:07:49.810
So you,
you helped me,
uh,

1032
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:53.950
grow as a person just by what you mentioned in,
in,
in,
in,

1033
01:07:53.951 --> 01:07:58.290
in tools to the titan.
We'll thank you for reading it,
first of all.
And,
uh,

1034
01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:03.070
this is,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm sure that,
uh,
with all my notes here today,

1035
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.730
I'm going to have to figure out a way to have another conversation with you for

1036
01:08:06.731 --> 01:08:07.820
sure.
So I hope,

1037
01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:12.540
hopefully I won't blow it between now and the end of the interview,
but,
uh,

1038
01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:18.060
books that you've re-read the most yourself or gifted to other people the most,

1039
01:08:18.951 --> 01:08:23.450
are there any books that come to mind?
Well,

1040
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:28.490
I,
you know,
being 80 years old,
it's a long span of,
of,
uh,

1041
01:08:28.491 --> 01:08:31.040
of,
of,
uh,
reading,
uh,

1042
01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:36.130
to books that I've given out the most.
Uh,
rarely do I,
I mean,

1043
01:08:36.230 --> 01:08:38.360
I go to meet anyone and I don't,

1044
01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:42.980
I can't tell you the last time I met someone and I didn't bring him a book.

1045
01:08:42.981 --> 01:08:47.150
It's just become a habit now to bring the,
give them a book.

1046
01:08:47.151 --> 01:08:49.970
In most cases,
I'd give them two or three books.

1047
01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:55.000
But the books that I've given away the most lately are,
uh,

1048
01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:56.540
Ryan's two books,
opts,
uh,

1049
01:08:56.870 --> 01:09:01.870
obstacles and ego is the enemy and a 12 rules for life by Jordan Peterson who,

1050
01:09:03.490 --> 01:09:05.540
uh,
I actually,

1051
01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:09.620
that this was one where I happen to go into Barnes and noble.

1052
01:09:09.621 --> 01:09:13.940
The data book arrives and I go through it and it gets passed as my test.

1053
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:17.870
And so I get back to the,

1054
01:09:17.930 --> 01:09:21.380
to the hotel and I started reading a book.

1055
01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:25.200
And before I know it's 2:00 AM in the morning and I'm still,
I'm,

1056
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:26.930
the guys got me hooked already.

1057
01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:31.130
And so I started telling people,
uh,

1058
01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:35.330
all you got to get this book out and no one's ever heard his guy.
Although,

1059
01:09:35.331 --> 01:09:38.810
and Ken and I understand he's quite controversial.
He teaches,

1060
01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.030
he's a professor at the University of Toronto.

1061
01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:46.780
So then about three weeks go by and all of a sudden as an explosion,

1062
01:09:46.881 --> 01:09:49.850
it's now number two on the best sellers and so forth.

1063
01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:55.180
So I would say I probably have given away somewhere between 20 and 30 copies of

1064
01:09:56.751 --> 01:09:57.561
that to friends.

1065
01:09:57.561 --> 01:10:02.120
A S A s I'll get a note from someone every now and then saying,
hey,

1066
01:10:02.121 --> 01:10:07.040
tell me a good book to read that that's the one I recommend the most.

1067
01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:11.030
Uh,
I give Tim's,
uh,
I mean Ryan's books away a lot.

1068
01:10:11.031 --> 01:10:13.470
One thing that I like about Ryan's book,
it's,

1069
01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:18.580
it's easier to see the carry cause it's smaller.
So I can,
I can get a little,
uh,

1070
01:10:18.581 --> 01:10:21.110
a bag and I can put 12 of them in there.

1071
01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:26.470
Mine are not as user friendly from caring perspective.
No,
but,
but that's,

1072
01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:30.730
that's the one thing I found.
What your two books is,
it's,
uh,

1073
01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:34.190
I take them on as a personal challenge.
I said,
if he,

1074
01:10:34.670 --> 01:10:38.540
he spent this much time with this many pages,

1075
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:42.440
I am not going to allow to the length of the book to intimidate me.

1076
01:10:42.441 --> 01:10:46.980
I'm going to see this as an opportunity.
And so,
uh,
you,
you,
uh,

1077
01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:47.780
what,

1078
01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:52.780
what I did with tools of the Titan was I call that my China book.

1079
01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:55.090
So,
uh,
it's,

1080
01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:59.510
it's 13 hours to Shanghai or 13 hours to Hong Kong.

1081
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:04.360
13 coming back as 26 hours a minute.
So I can,
I can,
I can knock,

1082
01:11:04.361 --> 01:11:05.480
knock that sucker out.

1083
01:11:05.481 --> 01:11:10.481
I just some books you just have to find the right environment in which to read

1084
01:11:11.781 --> 01:11:14.220
them.
Totally.
So I'm going to actually

1085
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:16.290
<v 1>just pause for a minute.
We'll keep the recording going.</v>

1086
01:11:16.291 --> 01:11:19.320
I'm going to go grab the books that you brought from me cause I'd love to talk

1087
01:11:19.321 --> 01:11:21.840
about those.
I'll be right back.
Okay.

1088
01:11:21.841 --> 01:11:26.841
So here we have five bucks and I'll just read off the titles quickly and then

1089
01:11:27.781 --> 01:11:28.470
uh,

1090
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:33.470
I'd love to hear you explain your reasons for choosing a few of these perhaps.

1091
01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:37.620
So the first is life is so good,
George Dawson and Richard Globin.

1092
01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:40.580
The next is the true believer,
subtitle,

1093
01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:43.470
thoughts on the nature of mass movements by Eric Hoffer.

1094
01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:48.030
Next we have blue highways by William least heat,
Moon,

1095
01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:51.230
that's quite a name.
Then we have whiplash.

1096
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:56.100
How to survive are faster future Joi Ito and Jeff,
how actually no joy.

1097
01:11:56.130 --> 01:11:58.890
I have not read this book though.
So she put it on.

1098
01:11:58.891 --> 01:12:02.940
They enjoy the now they could assign a truth.

1099
01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.040
Hector Mcdonald's.
Uh,

1100
01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:10.600
I would love to hear you explain why you like,

1101
01:12:10.771 --> 01:12:12.570
or why you chose perhaps a few of these.

1102
01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:17.330
<v 2>I think.
Well,
my first goal was,
uh,</v>

1103
01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:22.200
as I said to you when I first entered the room is that,
uh,
the,

1104
01:12:22.201 --> 01:12:26.340
what I learned from the three wise men was they always came bearing gifts.

1105
01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:29.430
And so I felt that,
uh,

1106
01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:34.460
that I wanted to share something with you as you wish of values as you were

1107
01:12:34.681 --> 01:12:38.340
sharing something with me of value and allow me to be on your program.

1108
01:12:38.341 --> 01:12:43.290
So I thought long and hard about the types of books that,

1109
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:44.183
uh,

1110
01:12:44.370 --> 01:12:48.390
a Princeton graduate who would find interesting.

1111
01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:51.480
And so I went back through and I,
and I,
uh,

1112
01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:54.700
the first one is life is so good is about,

1113
01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.560
about a black young man who was a slave.

1114
01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:01.200
And that 98 years old,

1115
01:13:01.290 --> 01:13:05.220
he decides that he's going to teach himself to right.
Wow.

1116
01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:09.780
And then he subsequently goes back and gets his GED.
And,
uh,

1117
01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:12.780
it's a fascinating story about that.

1118
01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:15.990
He never allowed his environment to,

1119
01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:19.320
to imprison him.
He,
it,

1120
01:13:19.330 --> 01:13:22.140
it took them a while to realize that,

1121
01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:26.340
that he had the capabilities to still re.

1122
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:30.630
But what was more important was that he wanted to do it.
And so he,

1123
01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:34.140
he taught himself to Rady,
ended up going back to school.

1124
01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:37.860
And now one of the things in here was a,

1125
01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:43.040
they have a couple of letters that young kids who read the book.

1126
01:13:43.051 --> 01:13:47.100
And,
and so here's a cute,
when it says,
dear Mr. Dawson,

1127
01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:50.100
I'm in second grade,
I live in Wisconsin.

1128
01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.650
I'm glad that your brain still works.

1129
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:56.070
Happy 10th anniversary.

1130
01:13:56.730 --> 01:14:01.320
And then the one other one it says,
I'm happy that you can read now.

1131
01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:05.220
I'm glad you liked school.
I do too.
I'm in the fourth grade.

1132
01:14:05.221 --> 01:14:09.330
Your friend Alex.
So it just,
and uh,

1133
01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:14.170
this is to me is one of the true classics of all time.
This is a,

1134
01:14:14.171 --> 01:14:16.810
the true believer by Eric Coffer.

1135
01:14:16.811 --> 01:14:19.750
Coffer was a longshoreman in San Francisco.

1136
01:14:19.930 --> 01:14:24.870
He's self educated and in this book is about,
uh,
about,
uh,

1137
01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:29.940
fanatics and how the people become so engrossed in mass movements.

1138
01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:36.050
A lot of the backdrop for his rationale has to do with Hitler's rise to power in

1139
01:14:37.031 --> 01:14:40.720
Germany.
Uh,
and,
and,
uh,
this,
this,

1140
01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:44.640
I just want to remember,
I'm pretty sure the book came out in,

1141
01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:46.720
in 1951.
He wrote this.

1142
01:14:46.721 --> 01:14:51.160
And so it's every bit as a contemporary as in fact,

1143
01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:54.940
if there was one of these books that I would say that you should,

1144
01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:59.320
someone should pick up and read right now.
I would say it's so applicable,

1145
01:14:59.321 --> 01:15:03.280
even though it was written in 51,
uh,
on,
uh,
uh,
on,

1146
01:15:03.610 --> 01:15:06.010
is this the true believer by Eric Hoffer?

1147
01:15:06.011 --> 01:15:10.420
I don't think you can get it in hardback now,
but it's a marvelous book.

1148
01:15:11.050 --> 01:15:15.430
Blue High Waist is,
uh,
was one that I read twice.

1149
01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:19.680
And a William lease heat moon was the professor at,
uh,

1150
01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:22.810
an and English at the University of Missouri.

1151
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:28.350
And he arrived at a point where he was totally bored at being the professor,

1152
01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.210
and he makes a,
uh,

1153
01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:35.680
a unique decision to abandon his career,

1154
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:39.370
sell everything he has.
Yeah.
He has a,
a credit card.

1155
01:15:39.610 --> 01:15:43.630
He sells everything he has and he decides that he's gonna,

1156
01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:48.660
he's gonna travel the blue highways of life and he's going to go all around the

1157
01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:54.120
America and all he's going to do is going to small towns off of blue highways

1158
01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:58.750
and,
and take up residence there for a day,
two a week,

1159
01:15:58.751 --> 01:16:02.270
and just talk to the local inhabitants and going to restaurants and,

1160
01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.590
and learn other people's stories and,
and,
and,
and,

1161
01:16:05.591 --> 01:16:09.240
and the challenges and successes.
And so the,

1162
01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:11.830
the blue highway connotation,
uh,

1163
01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:16.560
and I noticed because I taught math reading when I was in the army is the,
the,

1164
01:16:16.561 --> 01:16:18.730
the,
the,
the,
the on a map.

1165
01:16:18.810 --> 01:16:23.800
The blue highways are our secondary therapy and,
and,
uh,

1166
01:16:23.801 --> 01:16:27.100
as the,
the major highways that are drawn in red.

1167
01:16:27.370 --> 01:16:32.200
And so he decided that I don't want to travel around America on the main

1168
01:16:32.201 --> 01:16:37.120
highways of life because the real stories are off the blue highways.
And it,

1169
01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:42.340
it's just an incredible story,
uh,
of,
of his journey.

1170
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:47.050
And it gives you a look at,
at,
at,
uh,
America,
uh,
from a,

1171
01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:51.790
a perspective that you,
you would normally,
uh,
and what you find out,

1172
01:16:51.791 --> 01:16:54.340
even in these little towns around America,

1173
01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.260
there's not a whole lot of different people.
They,
they,
they,

1174
01:16:59.290 --> 01:17:03.400
they have their anxiety,
does,
they have their joys,
they have the revisions.

1175
01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:08.230
But one thing I noticed was that people in the smaller towns tend to lead a much

1176
01:17:08.231 --> 01:17:11.120
simpler life and,
and uh,

1177
01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:15.870
and their values are,
are,
are,
are,
are lot more sustainable.

1178
01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:17.600
And what I mean by that,
they're the,

1179
01:17:17.850 --> 01:17:22.310
they have fixed values that they've grown up with from a child and they've never

1180
01:17:22.311 --> 01:17:26.240
compromised.
It's a great book.
I,
I,
uh,
once again,

1181
01:17:26.241 --> 01:17:30.200
I spend a good bit of time trying to figure out which ones I thought you would

1182
01:17:30.530 --> 01:17:31.890
like.
The,
the,

1183
01:17:31.930 --> 01:17:36.930
the actual next one is I bought at the University of Penn Bookstore,

1184
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:39.770
uh,
about five months ago.

1185
01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:43.630
I never go to Philadelphia and don't go to the pin bookstore and,

1186
01:17:43.631 --> 01:17:47.510
and they have an incredible collection of books.

1187
01:17:47.511 --> 01:17:52.010
And so at that time I was thinking to myself,
you know,
you need to change the,

1188
01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.900
the subjects matter a little bit.

1189
01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:59.240
The dominant conversation is Marcus,
is the future to future,

1190
01:17:59.241 --> 01:18:02.150
get to the future first,
what's the future going to be look like?

1191
01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:04.700
And so I started to realize,
you know,

1192
01:18:04.730 --> 01:18:07.700
you need to understand more about what it is,

1193
01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:11.300
the future and what it is and what the potential.
So I'm,

1194
01:18:11.301 --> 01:18:15.110
as I'm going through going to the bookstore,
I decide only books,

1195
01:18:15.111 --> 01:18:18.080
I'm going to buy our books that talk about the future.

1196
01:18:18.081 --> 01:18:22.240
So I ended up buying about six books.
And so I came across this as,

1197
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:26.510
as the good Lord,
help me discover this book and it's called whiplash.

1198
01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:30.740
How to survive our,
uh,
are faster future.

1199
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:34.580
And it's written by two professors at Mit.

1200
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.330
And the book is,
is,
is,
is incredible.

1201
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:42.390
And as you can I ideas,
drawing books.

1202
01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:46.080
You have a lot of underlines.
Do you mind if I take a quick look at it?
No,
no,
no.

1203
01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:49.420
I just want to,
I'm a bit of a note taking fanatics.

1204
01:18:49.421 --> 01:18:53.610
So always fascinated to see how people take notes.

1205
01:18:54.150 --> 01:18:56.400
So you have underlines,

1206
01:18:57.090 --> 01:19:01.470
you have things that are circled and I see Google here.

1207
01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:07.160
Then you have something that is circled and looks like it has spines around it.

1208
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:11.250
It's like almost like a cactus.
So is that a,

1209
01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:16.170
what do you reserve that for the ones which circle are,

1210
01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:21.270
I'm always looking for way new ways to explain things and to teach.

1211
01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:26.540
So those are words that I'll go back and I'll transfer into one of my journals

1212
01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:29.370
because I'm looking for new ways to explain things.

1213
01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:33.150
Sometimes a person will be mentioned and I,

1214
01:19:33.151 --> 01:19:36.000
and so I'll circle that.
I'll,
I'll write those down.

1215
01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:41.180
So every day I take about a half an hour on Google at Google People's names.

1216
01:19:41.581 --> 01:19:46.370
I Google as I,
as I said,
with masterminds.
And then I,

1217
01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:51.270
uh,
I'll have where you see the markings on the side of a paragraph.

1218
01:19:51.271 --> 01:19:56.160
That means when I go back that I want to reread that in its entirety.

1219
01:19:56.310 --> 01:20:00.510
And it's really in this market right here,
but it looks like just to,

1220
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:02.310
for people who are listening to this,

1221
01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:06.540
it's basically a bunch of horizontal lines stacked,

1222
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:11.340
uh,
in the margin from the beginning of say this paragraph to the bottom of the

1223
01:20:11.341 --> 01:20:15.420
paragraph.
So that's something that you will reread and make comments.

1224
01:20:15.421 --> 01:20:19.010
Like on this paragraph I wrote on unbelievable,
uh,

1225
01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:23.550
this was a quote that I wanted to,
to put it in my journal on quotes.
And,

1226
01:20:23.690 --> 01:20:28.200
and so this was a person that was mentioned that I want to,
I want,

1227
01:20:28.201 --> 01:20:30.930
I want a Google.
A lot of times what will happen,
Tim,

1228
01:20:30.931 --> 01:20:34.560
I go back and I Google a person and,
and uh,
and,

1229
01:20:34.890 --> 01:20:39.180
and then immediately I go to see if they have a Twitter account.
And if they do,

1230
01:20:39.181 --> 01:20:43.350
then I,
then I sign up for the Twitter account.
And so to me,

1231
01:20:43.351 --> 01:20:48.351
the handheld device has become my own personal library and my source of

1232
01:20:48.811 --> 01:20:51.690
information.
But we're,
we're,
uh,

1233
01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:54.330
I've discovered a growing problem is,

1234
01:20:54.690 --> 01:20:58.620
is there's this huge proliferation of information today.

1235
01:20:58.621 --> 01:21:01.580
We were overwhelmed with information.
Uh,

1236
01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:06.780
and so what I find out is that it,
for me,

1237
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:10.980
I have to ha have to segment the information.

1238
01:21:11.190 --> 01:21:13.140
So I have this little formula,

1239
01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:16.770
inflammation equals knowledge,

1240
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:21.270
knowledge equals wisdom,
wisdom and equals growth.
Growth,

1241
01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:25.610
growth allows me to share.
So,
so I take the,
the,
the,

1242
01:21:25.650 --> 01:21:30.650
the information and I segment an end to magazine reading blogs,

1243
01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:35.450
articles and books.
And what I found out,
uh,

1244
01:21:35.610 --> 01:21:40.610
is that I was devoting an inordinate amount of time to blogs,

1245
01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:45.870
articles and magazines and newspapers and,
and,

1246
01:21:45.871 --> 01:21:48.900
and it was,
it was compromising my book reading.

1247
01:21:48.901 --> 01:21:53.100
So what I had to do was to start to plan out my week.

1248
01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:57.410
And so I'll have,
I'll have a day where I say,
uh,

1249
01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:01.710
blogs,
magazines and newspapers,

1250
01:22:01.711 --> 01:22:06.700
and then I'll have a day where as book day.
So that day,
um,
I,

1251
01:22:06.701 --> 01:22:11.450
I,
I,
I'm not doing anything but reading,
reading my books,
the other,

1252
01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:16.460
what thing I have to do is try to figure out other ways to get book reading in.

1253
01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:18.760
So if I,
if I,
uh,

1254
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:23.760
hop on a flight from La to,
uh,
to Austin,

1255
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:24.440
I,

1256
01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:29.440
I put four books in and my book bag that I carry on the plane and I read four

1257
01:22:31.411 --> 01:22:35.350
books at a time.
I have a lot of crazy things they do.
For example,

1258
01:22:36.330 --> 01:22:38.520
this is one of them.
Yes.
Uh,

1259
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.680
so just for people wondering is,
I love how wide ranging this is.

1260
01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:45.600
The mind is the title.

1261
01:22:45.601 --> 01:22:49.860
It's projections and multiple facets by Yogi budge on Phd,

1262
01:22:49.861 --> 01:22:54.270
master of Kundalini Yoga with grew churn,
s Calsa Phd.

1263
01:22:54.450 --> 01:22:55.950
Amazing.
So,

1264
01:22:56.010 --> 01:23:01.010
so what I do is if I get bored when I'm reading a,

1265
01:23:02.530 --> 01:23:04.690
I'll just switch to another book or a,

1266
01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:09.520
know it until I get one that really captures my attention.

1267
01:23:09.850 --> 01:23:12.070
So when I get on the plane,
I'm going to,

1268
01:23:12.370 --> 01:23:16.510
I usually start off by reading the Wall Street in New York Times in the local

1269
01:23:16.511 --> 01:23:19.930
paper,
and then by the second half I'll go to my books.

1270
01:23:19.930 --> 01:23:24.880
And so I,
I,
like I said,
I just have all these crazy things.
So,

1271
01:23:24.881 --> 01:23:26.890
for example,
uh,
I've,

1272
01:23:26.891 --> 01:23:31.560
I've trained myself to understand that the,
the blank pages,

1273
01:23:31.561 --> 01:23:35.500
I'd made all of the blank pages in a book.
Uh,
a valuable cause.

1274
01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:40.440
I take every blank page and I write and I write a notes in there so I don't have

1275
01:23:40.441 --> 01:23:43.510
to,
to switch to my notebook real,
some more handy.

1276
01:23:43.511 --> 01:23:48.240
So as you can see under a lot of the blank pages and you're running on AI,

1277
01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:52.120
right?
And,
and,
and as I,
I,
I go or I skip around.

1278
01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:56.360
<v 1>Wow.
So hold on,
said,
and this spread,
you have three different highlighters.</v>

1279
01:23:56.420 --> 01:24:00.440
You have,
I suppose,
pink,
yellow,
and green.

1280
01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:05.530
And do you have some red emphasis at the top of that particular page?

1281
01:24:07.190 --> 01:24:08.480
<v 2>Well,
what,
what,
what I,</v>

1282
01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:13.510
what I do is it helps redirect my attention,

1283
01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:16.890
uh,
to what's important.
If,
if I,
uh,

1284
01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:20.000
if you saw a speech that I gave,
for example,

1285
01:24:20.001 --> 01:24:23.330
I was the graduation speaker a couple of years ago at Villanova,

1286
01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:28.640
and if you saw the,
the speech,
it's a,
it's,
it's,

1287
01:24:28.670 --> 01:24:31.770
it's just amaze of colors and I,

1288
01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:36.130
my brain is trained that the,
the colors we'll,
we'll,

1289
01:24:36.131 --> 01:24:40.550
we'll redirect my attention.
And so if it's all pink,

1290
01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:45.400
that in many ways it really wasn't any sense to underline it.

1291
01:24:45.710 --> 01:24:50.570
I mean to,
to color it.
So I,
I tend to go back once I read this a book,

1292
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:55.730
I go back now and I'll,
I'll,
I'll,
I'll reread the book and,
and,
and,

1293
01:24:55.731 --> 01:24:58.280
and,
and,
and,
and go with the underlining again.

1294
01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:02.000
And sometimes if it's really powerful enough,
I just do it right then.

1295
01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:03.980
<v 1>So on the,</v>

1296
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:08.090
the key phrases or words that you circle,

1297
01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:12.680
so my system is,
I put he h and the margin next to it,

1298
01:25:12.681 --> 01:25:15.800
which stands for phrase.
And then on the very beginning of the book,

1299
01:25:15.801 --> 01:25:19.340
I created an index of phrases.
So I'll have ph and then I'll put in the,

1300
01:25:19.890 --> 01:25:22.850
the book numbers.
And,
uh,

1301
01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:26.000
similarly you do these multiple passes.

1302
01:25:26.001 --> 01:25:29.330
So on all go through a book and I'll underline or highlight and then I'll go

1303
01:25:29.331 --> 01:25:30.530
through it a second time.

1304
01:25:30.531 --> 01:25:35.531
And the margin I'll put t two and a circle around it just for Tim to like second

1305
01:25:35.811 --> 01:25:38.720
pass for things I find really interesting.
And then if I read it a third time,

1306
01:25:38.721 --> 01:25:41.570
I'll go through and I'll do T3 and so I can,

1307
01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:46.250
I can not only see what was interesting me,

1308
01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:47.930
interesting to me at different times,

1309
01:25:47.931 --> 01:25:50.120
but also sometimes I'll get so excited reading a book.

1310
01:25:50.121 --> 01:25:52.670
I don't know if you'd do this,
but I'll,
I'll highlight so much of like,
okay,

1311
01:25:52.671 --> 01:25:54.980
well I might as well have not highlighted anything cause I highlighted

1312
01:25:54.981 --> 01:25:59.530
everything.
And uh,
then the second time around I'll be a little bit more,
uh,

1313
01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:04.130
precise maybe.
And uh,
so then I can go and I have my own table

1314
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:07.500
<v 2>of contents,
which it looks like is similar to what you do.
Yeah.</v>

1315
01:26:08.450 --> 01:26:13.450
What I found out is in reading books now is when I go back on the second passage

1316
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:18.280
of the book or reading it,
I find,
uh,

1317
01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:22.490
some pages that were,
where I didn't have anything underlying.

1318
01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:25.490
And so just my inquisitive self,

1319
01:26:25.491 --> 01:26:30.491
I'll go back and read that page and be three or four things that,

1320
01:26:31.041 --> 01:26:34.250
that,
that I want to underline or are one to ponder.

1321
01:26:34.251 --> 01:26:38.990
Ron and I and I can understand,
wow,
how did I miss this?

1322
01:26:39.230 --> 01:26:41.960
So the second reading for me is,

1323
01:26:42.170 --> 01:26:47.170
is revealing because I always find something that I missed that maybe my brain

1324
01:26:48.921 --> 01:26:50.330
just was,
uh,
was,

1325
01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:55.160
was functioning too fast or I was being distracted.
And so,

1326
01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:59.140
uh,
I've learned that as a second reading is,
is,

1327
01:26:59.141 --> 01:27:00.770
is vitally important.

1328
01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:05.600
And so then the last thing I would do is I would end up transferring these two

1329
01:27:05.601 --> 01:27:10.601
journals and I actually have book notes back to 1972 is when I started to,

1330
01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:15.590
to keep them in three ring binders.

1331
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:17.990
And what I would do is when I was done with a book,

1332
01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:21.230
I would just give the book to my,
uh,
those days it was secretary.

1333
01:27:21.231 --> 01:27:25.940
So I'd give it to my secretary and she would type out everything that I had

1334
01:27:25.941 --> 01:27:29.720
underlined in the book.
And then she created a cover page for it.

1335
01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:33.530
And so I have a three ring binders.

1336
01:27:33.531 --> 01:27:38.531
I probably have 12 or 15 from Washington state and I probably have,

1337
01:27:39.831 --> 01:27:44.810
I only stayed at Iowa for years,
but I'd say I probably have about eight from,
uh,

1338
01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.540
um,
Iowa and,

1339
01:27:47.630 --> 01:27:51.320
and probably maybe 15 or 20 from USC.

1340
01:27:51.321 --> 01:27:54.780
So I actually have,
um,
uh,
the,
my,
my,
uh,

1341
01:27:54.850 --> 01:27:59.850
saved my notes over the years and one thing that they've been a great source of,

1342
01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:03.500
of not only learning and reflection,
but I,
I can,

1343
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:08.590
I find information that I can utilize in speeches.

1344
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:13.370
And it's,
it's interesting also when you look back in the,

1345
01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:15.680
I think people,
uh,

1346
01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:21.940
50 years ago placed a greater importance on,

1347
01:28:22.210 --> 01:28:25.790
on,
on writing skills and word usage isn't,

1348
01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:30.000
it was it was an art form now.
And,
and,
and,

1349
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:35.370
and how people go about explaining themselves is,
uh,

1350
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:38.780
but most of the books I read,
I,
I,
uh,

1351
01:28:38.910 --> 01:28:43.280
there are very few of them that I don't come away and feel that I'm a better

1352
01:28:43.281 --> 01:28:48.110
person.
One of the things I like to ask myself at the close of every day is,

1353
01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:51.950
what did I do to make myself a better person than I was yesterday?

1354
01:28:51.951 --> 01:28:56.170
What did I learn today?
And,
and so,
uh,

1355
01:28:56.970 --> 01:28:58.580
from a talk that I do,

1356
01:28:58.581 --> 01:29:03.581
I say to every day is composed of 86,400 seconds of opportunities and how

1357
01:29:05.461 --> 01:29:10.461
shameful as it for me to at the close of my day to say that I didn't do anything

1358
01:29:11.251 --> 01:29:15.030
today to make myself a better person than I was yesterday,

1359
01:29:15.031 --> 01:29:20.031
then that's shame on me because I had 86,400 seconds of opportunities that do

1360
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:23.820
something.
Even if it's no more than that,

1361
01:29:23.821 --> 01:29:27.450
then a thank you or random smile,
a pat on the back.

1362
01:29:28.170 --> 01:29:29.190
Think about this,
Tim.

1363
01:29:29.191 --> 01:29:34.191
There are a lot of people in this country who go through 24 hours and never have

1364
01:29:34.321 --> 01:29:36.420
anyone say anything to him positive.

1365
01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:41.660
You might be the only person that day who said something to that person that was

1366
01:29:41.761 --> 01:29:46.761
positive or I know we're in a different culture now and I always think I'm

1367
01:29:49.231 --> 01:29:50.310
running a little risk,

1368
01:29:50.311 --> 01:29:55.311
but if I'm in a restaurant or somewhere and I didn't see and and in a person's

1369
01:29:55.441 --> 01:29:59.520
waiting on me and he or she has a great smile,

1370
01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:04.020
I invariably say,
hey,
you have a great smile.
I,

1371
01:30:04.021 --> 01:30:09.021
I sometimes I feel a little uneasy when I say it to a female because I don't

1372
01:30:09.181 --> 01:30:11.910
want,
you know,
someone might think of trying to come onto him,

1373
01:30:12.150 --> 01:30:14.610
but at the same time I'm willing to take that risk.

1374
01:30:14.611 --> 01:30:19.320
So earlier when we were leaving breakfast,
uh,
as we were leaving,

1375
01:30:19.321 --> 01:30:21.700
the two waitresses said,
thanks for coming.

1376
01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:25.130
And they had a big smile on their face.
So I said to both of them,
both you,

1377
01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:28.560
two of you have a great smile.
Well,
to me,

1378
01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:34.220
I like practicing random acts of kindness because so much today we're were cruel

1379
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:41.190
and unintentionally cruel,
but we,
we,
we,
we don't think,

1380
01:30:41.970 --> 01:30:46.690
uh,
what,
how valuable a little things are.
The thank you's,

1381
01:30:46.691 --> 01:30:51.410
the smiles that taking time to listen.
I had a situation,

1382
01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:54.130
I still grapple with this when people ask,

1383
01:30:54.131 --> 01:30:57.510
stop you on the street and asked for money.
So we were,

1384
01:30:57.570 --> 01:31:02.010
we were having lunch yesterday and a lady came up and she asked if she could

1385
01:31:02.011 --> 01:31:05.730
spare some money.
She wanted to get something to eat or drink.

1386
01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:09.720
So I gave her $5 and I said,

1387
01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:14.190
now I hope you used a $5 on what you said you were going to do.

1388
01:31:14.610 --> 01:31:17.220
So she points in is a little grocery store,

1389
01:31:17.250 --> 01:31:21.450
a few store doors down.
She comes back,

1390
01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:26.110
shows me to drink and to $3 change.
And so wow.

1391
01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:29.500
So we,
it was a win for both of us.
But uh,

1392
01:31:30.050 --> 01:31:34.920
I grapple with this thing about do I give them some money and uh,
uh,

1393
01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:38.070
do I not.
But in this case,

1394
01:31:38.071 --> 01:31:42.420
I mean I really felt good that,
that I was able to do the,

1395
01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:47.010
do something for her and she did something for me cause she made me feel good

1396
01:31:47.250 --> 01:31:47.850
that,

1397
01:31:47.850 --> 01:31:52.850
that I could trust what she really did help fortify my mind that I should

1398
01:31:54.451 --> 01:31:57.780
probably be giving more instead of less.

1399
01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:00.280
We'll you've given a lot

1400
01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:03.930
<v 1>in a lot of ways in many years of your life and,</v>

1401
01:32:04.090 --> 01:32:08.250
and certainly one capacity is that a coach.
Uh,

1402
01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:09.250
and we were,

1403
01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:14.280
we're educator or teacher and we could spend days and hopefully we will,

1404
01:32:15.941 --> 01:32:18.490
hopefully we'll get to know each other even better and spend more time together.

1405
01:32:18.491 --> 01:32:23.491
But for now I thought we might jump forward at least from your childhood stories

1406
01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:28.900
to the Olympics,

1407
01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:31.810
1984 and

1408
01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:38.560
there are many different angles we could take to,
to get into this.
But,

1409
01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:43.200
uh,
I suppose where I want to start,
there's,

1410
01:32:43.201 --> 01:32:45.400
so it's so many different things that I want to touch on,

1411
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:50.110
but since we were talking about communicating and phrasing and words,

1412
01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:52.420
could you,
uh,

1413
01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:57.910
could you share the motivational quote that you came up with at that time?

1414
01:32:58.750 --> 01:32:59.680
And I think it's,

1415
01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:02.620
each one of us has a relative who gave his life for this country.

1416
01:33:02.621 --> 01:33:04.660
The least we can do is give 40 minutes of ourselves.

1417
01:33:04.830 --> 01:33:09.300
<v 2>Yes.
That was,
that's actually a Bob Knight quote.
Uh,
and,
um,</v>

1418
01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:15.770
<v 0>was</v>

1419
01:33:15.770 --> 01:33:18.110
<v 2>the motivating force because</v>

1420
01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:21.500
when you stop and think about it,

1421
01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:27.400
very seldom in our lifetime does our country ever come to us and say,

1422
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:33.140
we need you.
It's,
it's always the exact opposite that we,

1423
01:33:33.410 --> 01:33:36.590
that we're looking for something from the government.

1424
01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:40.540
But I felt that this was a unique opportunity,
uh,

1425
01:33:40.730 --> 01:33:45.730
that the country was basically saying to the team and the coaches that we need

1426
01:33:47.541 --> 01:33:51.740
you and we need you to bring back a gold medal force.
And so this,

1427
01:33:51.770 --> 01:33:55.820
this was a unique opportunity for us to serve our country.

1428
01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:01.480
And I can remember vividly in the months leading up to the 84 Olympics in Los

1429
01:34:03.410 --> 01:34:03.740
Angeles,

1430
01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:07.790
I would envision that we going to win the gold medal and we were going to be

1431
01:34:07.791 --> 01:34:10.220
standing there and,
and,
uh,

1432
01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:15.240
and the hear the national anthem play and to be at attention and look at the

1433
01:34:15.981 --> 01:34:20.060
American flag.
I know that w we're in a different era now in a different time,

1434
01:34:20.061 --> 01:34:23.360
but the reality was this is how I felt.

1435
01:34:23.630 --> 01:34:25.070
And so I,

1436
01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:30.620
I grew up in an era where where my grandma taught,
uh,

1437
01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:35.690
America,
right or wrong America,
whatever the problems are,
we'll work them out.

1438
01:34:35.691 --> 01:34:39.980
But,
but at the end of the day,
we're an American.
And so I,

1439
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.180
I envision,

1440
01:34:41.181 --> 01:34:45.020
what was it going to be like when we stood there and received a gold medal and,

1441
01:34:45.021 --> 01:34:46.990
and,
and,
um,

1442
01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:51.860
heard the national anthem played in you and you had the satisfaction of saying

1443
01:34:51.861 --> 01:34:56.570
to yourself a mission accomplished.
And it was,

1444
01:34:56.950 --> 01:35:01.950
it was one of the most unique experiences I've ever had in my life to,

1445
01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:08.520
to be in a position where you could represent your country and you could,

1446
01:35:09.081 --> 01:35:12.770
uh,
uh,
feel,
uh,

1447
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:15.460
have a good feeling about it.
I,
I,

1448
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:20.470
I'm sure there'll be a lot of people who will question why I felt that way,

1449
01:35:20.571 --> 01:35:22.670
but that's the truth of the matter.

1450
01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:28.610
And I was chatting with a Ryan or texting with Ryan last night after he had

1451
01:35:28.611 --> 01:35:31.850
dinner with you.
And,
uh,
he was,

1452
01:35:31.851 --> 01:35:35.210
he was peppering me with suggested topics,

1453
01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:38.240
which of course we have an over abundance of.

1454
01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:43.720
But one of the bullets here in the notes in front of me is that refers to you

1455
01:35:44.931 --> 01:35:48.140
leading the practice team to beating the Dream Team.

1456
01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:53.090
Can you elaborate on this place?
And what happened was,
uh,

1457
01:35:53.450 --> 01:35:57.410
for the first time in the history of the Olympics,
uh,

1458
01:35:57.411 --> 01:36:01.220
the United States decided not to use college players anymore,

1459
01:36:01.221 --> 01:36:06.221
but to use professional players in so that year the Olympics were in Barcelona

1460
01:36:07.911 --> 01:36:11.870
and Chuck daily was the head coach of the u us team.

1461
01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:13.490
And of course you had a,

1462
01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:17.930
I think the only player on that Dream Team that's not in the basketball hall of

1463
01:36:17.931 --> 01:36:19.970
fame right now is Christian Laettner was,

1464
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:22.640
he was the only college player on the roster.
And you,

1465
01:36:22.641 --> 01:36:27.560
of course you had magic bird Barkley,
uh,
uh,
Jordan,

1466
01:36:27.650 --> 01:36:28.790
you name it was.

1467
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:35.470
So chuck and I had been lifelong friends back from when he was in his system

1468
01:36:35.691 --> 01:36:39.470
that Duke,
and that was an assistant at Villanova.
And,
um,

1469
01:36:39.770 --> 01:36:43.520
he was a Pennsylvania and,
uh,
go up pucks a tawny.

1470
01:36:43.521 --> 01:36:47.630
So we had longstanding,
a authentic relationship.
So,

1471
01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:48.650
uh,

1472
01:36:48.650 --> 01:36:53.650
chuck decided that they wanted to put together a group of college players that

1473
01:36:54.201 --> 01:36:58.940
would,
would a scrimmage the dream team twice a day in practice.

1474
01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:04.010
And so he suggested that I be the coach.
And so cm Newton,

1475
01:37:04.011 --> 01:37:08.060
who was head of USA basketball at the time call me and asked if I would,

1476
01:37:08.090 --> 01:37:11.870
would be the coach of a team.
And I said,
I'd love to do it.

1477
01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:16.760
So they picked the players and Bobby Hurley and uh,
uh,

1478
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:18.260
Chris Webber and a bunch of guys.

1479
01:37:18.261 --> 01:37:22.640
We only had eight players and Roy Williams and I coached the team together.

1480
01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:27.290
And so the first night that we had the scrimmage,
uh,

1481
01:37:27.291 --> 01:37:30.310
I think the NBA guys basically looked at it.
I says,

1482
01:37:30.610 --> 01:37:34.760
this is just a scrimmage in college guys.
And so they,
they,

1483
01:37:34.761 --> 01:37:38.590
they didn't really take it as serious as we did a college guys.
They were,
well,

1484
01:37:38.690 --> 01:37:41.090
we were all fired up.
This is a great opportunity.

1485
01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:44.510
So we scrimmaged for 37 minutes and,

1486
01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:48.790
and we actually beat them in the scrimmage.
And so,
uh,

1487
01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:53.270
the word got out and they were livid.
So one thing that happened,

1488
01:37:54.010 --> 01:37:54.843
um,

1489
01:37:54.860 --> 01:37:59.460
I picked one of my managers from USC to be a manager for our team.

1490
01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:04.650
And so when the,
when the practice ended,
Larry Burke came up to me and he said,

1491
01:38:04.651 --> 01:38:08.070
coach,
he said,
can you do me a favor?
I said,
sure.
What?
He says,

1492
01:38:08.071 --> 01:38:13.071
can you leave a van and the driver here or have somebody come back and pick me

1493
01:38:13.741 --> 01:38:16.500
up?
And so I,
so I'll leave.
One of the managers would have van.

1494
01:38:16.770 --> 01:38:21.060
So Larry hadn't shot the ball at well in the scrimmage,
so he stayed,

1495
01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:25.680
uh,
and,
and shot for an hour and 15 minutes straight.

1496
01:38:25.681 --> 01:38:30.330
And so I told them,
uh,
uh,
uh,
Dennis Johnson,

1497
01:38:30.331 --> 01:38:34.350
who was the manager,
I said,
when you get back,
let me know your back.

1498
01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:38.520
And so when he came to my room,
I said,
how'd it go?
He said,
coach,
he said,

1499
01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:43.650
it's unbelievable.
He said,
he just continually shot.

1500
01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:48.860
He said he only took one water break and he said he was drenched head to toe.

1501
01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:54.660
And he looked at me and he said,
coach,
if Larry Bird is doing this,

1502
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:58.280
what should the average guy be doing?
And it was,

1503
01:38:58.290 --> 01:39:03.030
it was just a great experience.
Uh,
uh,
I,
so the next,

1504
01:39:03.031 --> 01:39:07.080
not the time we scrimmaged uh,
they were,
they were fired.

1505
01:39:07.950 --> 01:39:10.470
So we doubled the,
I'm embarrassed to say this,

1506
01:39:10.471 --> 01:39:14.490
we didn't score a field goal for the first night in minutes.
I mean,

1507
01:39:14.491 --> 01:39:17.450
they were on us like white on rice and they were,
they said,
oh,

1508
01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:20.730
you guys think you're hot as you know,
we're going to show you.

1509
01:39:20.910 --> 01:39:25.680
And Jordan was leading the pack and so they would determine,
okay,

1510
01:39:25.681 --> 01:39:28.920
you guys think you're good,
we're going to show you what,
what good is.

1511
01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:30.913
<v 1>Uh,</v>

1512
01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:36.100
so I want to talk about coaching a team.
Uh,

1513
01:39:36.101 --> 01:39:37.990
and I,
I think the way I'd like to get into this,

1514
01:39:37.991 --> 01:39:42.991
I is by asking if you could maybe mention just one coach that you have been

1515
01:39:45.851 --> 01:39:50.380
impressed by,
alive or dead past,
present,
it doesn't matter.

1516
01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:52.930
And what impressed you about them?

1517
01:39:55.790 --> 01:40:00.050
<v 2>Oh,
I would say to coaches who are,</v>

1518
01:40:00.051 --> 01:40:02.000
I don't actually have to say three,

1519
01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:07.300
three coaches who have had an immense impact on me as a person,

1520
01:40:07.431 --> 01:40:11.510
as a coach.
My life would be a Bob Knight,

1521
01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:14.880
John Thompson and Lefty Jersey,
lefty Zell.

1522
01:40:14.930 --> 01:40:18.950
I was his assistant at the University of Maryland.
Uh,

1523
01:40:19.010 --> 01:40:22.510
he was the one who taught me,
uh,
who,

1524
01:40:22.530 --> 01:40:27.530
who fuel my passion for reading.
He was the one who,
who taught,

1525
01:40:27.650 --> 01:40:31.580
taught me that,
uh,
that you don't just read the sports section.

1526
01:40:31.581 --> 01:40:36.581
He actually got me into a system that I still a use when I go to the newspaper.

1527
01:40:36.951 --> 01:40:39.140
Now,
the last section of the newspaper,

1528
01:40:39.141 --> 01:40:43.580
I read his sports and that's something that started back with him.

1529
01:40:43.581 --> 01:40:48.581
He also told me the importance of reading the editorial page every day.

1530
01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:53.290
And He,
and then the other thing was he,
he,

1531
01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:57.130
he wanted us to be the best dressed staff in the ACC.

1532
01:40:57.130 --> 01:41:01.640
So I picked up a lot of habits,
uh,
from lefty,
uh,

1533
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:05.650
that,
that I have to,
to this day,
John Thompson,

1534
01:41:05.651 --> 01:41:09.360
I grew up in the same neighborhood in Washington DC.
Um,

1535
01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:11.050
he had,

1536
01:41:11.050 --> 01:41:15.850
he's had so much influence on the way I think the w the way I act.

1537
01:41:15.851 --> 01:41:18.910
What I believe.
Um,
uh,

1538
01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:23.380
w the one thing I learned with John is when you're around John,

1539
01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:28.570
you're talk to listen ratio.
You're listen ratio should be 90%,

1540
01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:32.830
and the talk should be 10.
Because if it's any other way you've,
you,

1541
01:41:32.890 --> 01:41:37.810
you've lost a great opportunity to,
to learn and,
and to be taught.

1542
01:41:38.110 --> 01:41:42.180
Cause he's,
he's um,
he was,
John is a maverick thinker in the,

1543
01:41:42.220 --> 01:41:47.220
and he was a maverick thinker before the connotation even existed and the other

1544
01:41:48.431 --> 01:41:52.070
person,
Bob Knight
to sad,

1545
01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:57.180
absolutely amazing impact on why was that a summer league game as an assistant

1546
01:41:57.521 --> 01:41:59.130
coach at Villanova and halftime,

1547
01:41:59.170 --> 01:42:03.160
I go down to look at the scoreboard and the guy taps me on the back end and I

1548
01:42:03.161 --> 01:42:05.140
turned in,
he says,
hi,
my name's Bob Knight.

1549
01:42:05.140 --> 01:42:08.380
Assistant at West Coach was point and I say,

1550
01:42:08.381 --> 01:42:10.420
Hi George Raveling assistant at Villanova.

1551
01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:15.480
And from that moment on we had a lifelong friendship and that's how I ended up

1552
01:42:16.001 --> 01:42:19.780
being the assistant coach on the 84 Olympic team.

1553
01:42:20.170 --> 01:42:25.170
But maybe Bob's greatest gift to me was that he saw something that end made it I

1554
01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:31.570
never saw in myself.
And he was relentless to,

1555
01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:36.670
to make sure that I achieved that.
He,
he said to me,
George,

1556
01:42:37.330 --> 01:42:39.310
if we're going to survive in this profession,

1557
01:42:39.311 --> 01:42:44.311
we have to become an expert in some phase of the gate and you need to make

1558
01:42:44.531 --> 01:42:48.130
yourself an expert in some phase of the game.
Bob's was defense.

1559
01:42:48.131 --> 01:42:50.680
And so he said to me,
he said,

1560
01:42:50.681 --> 01:42:54.160
I know you speak a lot at clinics on rebounding.
That's your niche.

1561
01:42:54.161 --> 01:42:59.161
You've got to make yourself the foremost authority on the globe on rebounding.

1562
01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:02.890
And then he stayed after me on a phony call me one night.
He said,
hey,
I,

1563
01:43:02.891 --> 01:43:06.130
I looked it up in the,
in the,
uh,
library of Congress.

1564
01:43:06.131 --> 01:43:09.130
There's no book in the Library of Congress on rebounding.

1565
01:43:09.131 --> 01:43:11.050
So you've got a unique opportunity.

1566
01:43:11.470 --> 01:43:15.460
And so I still didn't believe that I could actually write a book.

1567
01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:21.340
And so he,
he,
Bob just stayed after me.
So finally he said,
write it,

1568
01:43:21.620 --> 01:43:24.520
write an outline and send it to me.
And then of course,

1569
01:43:24.521 --> 01:43:27.940
we didn't have a technology.
We did it.
So I wrote an outline and send it to them.

1570
01:43:28.090 --> 01:43:32.140
So little did I know he was setting me up before,
is the,
walk me through this.

1571
01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:37.090
And so the moral of this story is I ended up writing a book called,

1572
01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:38.590
uh,
uh,

1573
01:43:39.310 --> 01:43:43.720
one I work was a Rebounderz workshop and the,
and the,

1574
01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:46.040
and the other one's called war on the boards.

1575
01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:50.980
That was the thesis in the manuscript for the art of rebounding.

1576
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:52.070
And I,
I've,

1577
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:57.070
I've probably sold 100,000 copies over the years of the book,

1578
01:43:57.890 --> 01:44:02.890
but without Bob staying on me and being relentless and never accepting no,

1579
01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:08.860
he helped me find s something inside of me that I would have never in my life

1580
01:44:09.501 --> 01:44:13.910
ever thought I would have written a book and,
or even had the talent to do.

1581
01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:18.320
But he,
he saw something in me that other people didn't see in me.

1582
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:21.910
And that's been a lot of,
uh,
of,
uh,

1583
01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:26.300
of the relevance for this magical carpet ride I've had in life.

1584
01:44:26.301 --> 01:44:30.050
People seeing something in me that I didn't see in myself,

1585
01:44:30.051 --> 01:44:34.480
my grandma's see and something that means sister Delores in something to me.
Uh,

1586
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:38.270
my high school coach seeing something in me,
my co,
my,
uh,

1587
01:44:38.750 --> 01:44:42.180
my college coach Al Severance,
he said something Tim that out,

1588
01:44:42.230 --> 01:44:46.310
never ever forget one time he was talking to us and he said,

1589
01:44:46.311 --> 01:44:50.900
the first sign of intelligence is to admit that you don't know something.

1590
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:56.340
And,
and,
uh,
here I am eight years old and,
and I,

1591
01:44:56.341 --> 01:45:01.060
I still remember him telling me this,
that it,
and,

1592
01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:06.070
and so I've learned so much everyone that including yourself have touched my

1593
01:45:07.071 --> 01:45:11.910
life and in a productive way.
If I don't read tools to the tight,

1594
01:45:11.911 --> 01:45:15.200
and I don't know her in about mastermind,
if I don't learn about mastermind,

1595
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:20.000
I killed myself in 20 different relationships.
I,
uh,
I,

1596
01:45:20.170 --> 01:45:24.410
I learned things about people that I didn't know.
So,

1597
01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:25.730
uh,

1598
01:45:26.090 --> 01:45:31.090
it's just been a blessing journey that you meet people who are willing to help

1599
01:45:32.031 --> 01:45:36.200
you continue to grow,
especially at 80 years.
Oh,

1600
01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:41.160
well now he,
you think Tim from s at 60 years old,

1601
01:45:41.210 --> 01:45:44.360
the thought process in America was you retire,

1602
01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:49.220
you get a gold watch and you live happily ever after.

1603
01:45:49.490 --> 01:45:54.490
But between 60 and 80 is it might be the most productive years of my life.

1604
01:45:54.530 --> 01:45:56.050
I've grown so much.
I'm,

1605
01:45:56.540 --> 01:46:00.700
I was 63 years old and I get appointed global,
uh,

1606
01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:04.670
director of sports marketing at Nike at 63 years old.

1607
01:46:04.671 --> 01:46:09.140
So how does you defied the odds?
Ex basketball coach,
black,

1608
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:11.660
no business background and you're running,

1609
01:46:11.690 --> 01:46:16.450
you're running a fortune 500 category.
And,
uh,

1610
01:46:18.210 --> 01:46:21.860
and I can remember many times thinking that,
uh,

1611
01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:24.710
all of the four years I spent at Villanova,
uh,

1612
01:46:24.711 --> 01:46:27.890
I was an econ major in economics maybe.
And at that time,

1613
01:46:27.891 --> 01:46:28.820
they didn't call it this,

1614
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:31.850
a business school called the school of Commerce and finance.

1615
01:46:31.851 --> 01:46:36.460
So I graduated with a degree in economics and I used to think,
God,

1616
01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:39.890
this is a waste of time.
I learned all this.
I'm never going to use it.

1617
01:46:40.250 --> 01:46:44.030
And little did I know that at 63 years old,

1618
01:46:44.031 --> 01:46:46.460
all this was going to come back to fruition and,

1619
01:46:46.461 --> 01:46:51.020
and it was going to be necessary.
And,
um,
so it,
it,
it,

1620
01:46:51.021 --> 01:46:55.710
it did pay off.
And,
uh,
as I understand it,
the,

1621
01:46:55.711 --> 01:46:59.950
um,
the job offer a,

1622
01:47:00.210 --> 01:47:01.890
or at least you're beginning with Nike,

1623
01:47:01.891 --> 01:47:06.891
came through what seemed like a prank call from a Phil Knight.

1624
01:47:08.191 --> 01:47:09.560
At least that's what I read.

1625
01:47:10.250 --> 01:47:13.950
You started long before that when I went,

1626
01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:16.860
went to work full time for them.

1627
01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:20.950
I get this call and then we'll go back to the origin.
Uh,

1628
01:47:20.951 --> 01:47:24.660
I get a call one night and I answered the phone and the voice says,

1629
01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:26.010
this is Philip Knight.

1630
01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:30.480
And that's basically how filled always addresses it to this day.
If he calls,

1631
01:47:30.490 --> 01:47:35.300
he's going to say,
this is Philip Knight.
And so I for a moment,

1632
01:47:35.310 --> 01:47:39.600
Turley is somebody put me on.
So then I said,
uh,
uh,

1633
01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:44.040
is it really easy and it's full night?
And I said,
what's going on?
And he said,
uh,

1634
01:47:44.490 --> 01:47:44.671
uh,

1635
01:47:44.671 --> 01:47:48.720
just called to see if you'd be interested in coming to work for Nike full time.

1636
01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:52.770
And so we talked it through and I said,
well,
what do you want me to do?

1637
01:47:52.771 --> 01:47:56.750
And he said,
I want you to come.
And at that time,
like he had this,

1638
01:47:56.780 --> 01:48:01.400
this camp call the all American camp.
And he said,
I want you to upgrade it,

1639
01:48:01.470 --> 01:48:05.490
but I want,
I want to figure out how we can reach a younger kids.

1640
01:48:06.030 --> 01:48:09.220
And so I still have somewhere in storage,

1641
01:48:09.221 --> 01:48:13.860
the original presentation that I made to him to start a grassroots program.

1642
01:48:13.861 --> 01:48:17.610
At that time,
there was no such thing as a grass roots program.
And,

1643
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.660
and so that was started me working full time.

1644
01:48:21.661 --> 01:48:26.640
But I actually started at Nike and,
and in 1978,

1645
01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:31.260
the Nike decides they're going to get college coaches to endorse their product

1646
01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:36.360
and they fly 11 of us to Los Vegas.
And,
uh,
uh,
Jerry talk,

1647
01:48:36.361 --> 01:48:39.420
Caney was one,
Jimmy Valvano and so forth.

1648
01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:44.420
And so John slusher Sr and Phil came and made the presentation to us and

1649
01:48:45.661 --> 01:48:50.661
essentially they would give you a compensation and all the product for you and

1650
01:48:50.771 --> 01:48:54.690
your,
your team.
And this is in [inaudible] 78.
And so,

1651
01:48:55.310 --> 01:48:59.970
um,
I was sitting beside Bill Foster,
who was coaching at Clemson at the time.

1652
01:48:59.971 --> 01:49:04.680
And so the,
the second day we had to make a decision.

1653
01:49:04.681 --> 01:49:07.950
And so part of it was they give you the compensation.

1654
01:49:07.951 --> 01:49:12.240
The compensation was 5,000 in cash or 5,000 in stock.

1655
01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:17.040
That the impediment,
it really wasn't as it turned out,

1656
01:49:17.190 --> 01:49:21.060
was if he took the stock,
he couldn't catch the stock for five years.

1657
01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:23.460
And at that time the stock was about six bucks.

1658
01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:27.930
And so bill foster leans over to me and he says,
George,
take to stock,

1659
01:49:27.931 --> 01:49:30.180
take the stock out.
I'll explain to you later.
He said,

1660
01:49:30.181 --> 01:49:32.100
all these [inaudible] going to take the cash.

1661
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.380
And so the five year thing ended up being a disciplinary,

1662
01:49:37.530 --> 01:49:41.190
a factor,
because even if you wanted to,
you couldn't cash it.
So,

1663
01:49:41.670 --> 01:49:44.550
so then when the five years passed,

1664
01:49:44.551 --> 01:49:48.040
bill called me about six months before the due date,
and he said,

1665
01:49:49.090 --> 01:49:52.090
listen to me again,
don't cash the sock,
don't cash the stock.

1666
01:49:52.091 --> 01:49:55.150
Just let it roll over.
You got this far without,
you can get the rest of the way.

1667
01:49:55.720 --> 01:50:00.070
So anyway,
uh,
by the time I finally sold the stock,

1668
01:50:00.071 --> 01:50:03.860
it Wa it was up to 46 bucks and,
and,

1669
01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:08.770
and it's split.
And so,
but to go back,
I,
so that year in 78,

1670
01:50:08.771 --> 01:50:13.060
Nike,
since Bill Foster,
myself and Eddie Sutton to,
uh,

1671
01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:18.010
to China for a month to do clinics.
And so we went to a,

1672
01:50:18.390 --> 01:50:23.080
to peak king Shanghai in Guang Jo.
So at that time,

1673
01:50:23.170 --> 01:50:27.610
Beijing did not exist.
Subsequently,
Beijing,
it was peaking,

1674
01:50:27.730 --> 01:50:32.290
was replaced with Beijing,
but at that time,
uh,
it was called Peking.

1675
01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:36.640
And so we went and did these clinics in China.

1676
01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:42.820
And at that time it was highly communistic.
Everybody dressed the same,

1677
01:50:42.821 --> 01:50:46.990
the women dressed white blouse and olive green slacks and,

1678
01:50:47.290 --> 01:50:51.250
and the men had these little,
a Nehru jackets at olive green,

1679
01:50:51.610 --> 01:50:56.110
and they had a cap with the red star on it that could speak no English.

1680
01:50:56.111 --> 01:51:01.111
And so one day we're in Tenement Square and bill Foster's wife had a Polaroid

1681
01:51:02.111 --> 01:51:04.060
camera and she was taking pictures.

1682
01:51:04.061 --> 01:51:08.290
And so she took a picture of a group of Chinese people standing together,

1683
01:51:08.291 --> 01:51:12.880
conversating.
And so when,
then when we developed,

1684
01:51:12.881 --> 01:51:15.340
she showed it to him and they were,
it was like,

1685
01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:18.710
we might as well been from the moon day was so we couldn't tell what they're

1686
01:51:18.730 --> 01:51:19.540
saying.
But anyway,

1687
01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:24.540
there were so excited pointing and then more people came and they had no idea,

1688
01:51:25.270 --> 01:51:29.590
uh,
how this was transpiring.
So here's,

1689
01:51:29.620 --> 01:51:32.230
here's a,
an interesting story,
Tim.

1690
01:51:32.590 --> 01:51:37.140
So a Chinese gentleman steps out of the crowd and he comes up to me and he,

1691
01:51:37.170 --> 01:51:41.950
and he,
and he picks my hand up and he rubs my hand,
looks at his fingers.

1692
01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:44.140
And so it was a parent,

1693
01:51:44.141 --> 01:51:47.830
he had never seen a black person before in his life and he thought it was paint.

1694
01:51:47.950 --> 01:51:51.610
Wow.
And so he was rubbing to see if the paint,
cause he couldn't figure it out.

1695
01:51:51.611 --> 01:51:55.030
He'd never seen a black person before.
And it's just,
it's,

1696
01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:59.620
it's a story that's left an indelible mark on my,
my,
uh,
stay.

1697
01:51:59.621 --> 01:52:03.610
But it,
that was maybe one of the great trips of,
of all time.

1698
01:52:03.611 --> 01:52:07.240
I tell you one other quick story.
We're doing the clinic and in Shanghai and the,

1699
01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:11.290
and a interpreter comes up to me at the end of my lecture and he says,
coach,

1700
01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:12.870
he says,
uh,

1701
01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:17.170
this coach would like the bar you're rebounding book and he'll bring it back in

1702
01:52:17.171 --> 01:52:19.360
the morning.
So I thought he just wanted to take it home and read it.

1703
01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:21.790
So the next morning and comes back.
Sure enough,

1704
01:52:21.791 --> 01:52:26.300
it gives me the book and he's got 25 copies of it overnight.

1705
01:52:26.570 --> 01:52:30.990
The 25 guys in a book and it gave me mine back.
Welcome to China.

1706
01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:37.990
See you started working full time at Nike.
It's at age 63.

1707
01:52:38.170 --> 01:52:42.550
Is that right?
Well,
no,
I actually,
I took the global,

1708
01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:45.440
uh,
sports marketing job at 63.

1709
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:49.550
I actually had put in about eight years in,

1710
01:52:49.551 --> 01:52:54.170
in developing this grassroots,
uh,
program at Nike.

1711
01:52:54.590 --> 01:52:59.570
And then subsequently I got this opportunity to,
to,
to be the global director.

1712
01:52:59.930 --> 01:53:03.020
And you mentioned a familiar name to a lot of people.

1713
01:53:03.021 --> 01:53:05.270
Michael Jordan earlier from the Dream Team.

1714
01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:10.040
And I've seen a photograph of you with a very young Michael Jordan,
uh,

1715
01:53:10.660 --> 01:53:15.260
sub read that you're the one who actually convinced Michael Jordan does signed

1716
01:53:15.261 --> 01:53:19.430
with Nike,
uh,
or certainly one of the driving factors there.
Can you do,

1717
01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:22.850
could you share that story?
I don't know if I would go that far,

1718
01:53:22.851 --> 01:53:26.370
but I was a cotton doing,
uh,
so early,
Eh,

1719
01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:29.720
at the Olympic trials,
uh,
sunny Vic Carroll,

1720
01:53:29.721 --> 01:53:34.721
who was then a heading up Nike basketball and Phil had came to me and they said,

1721
01:53:35.661 --> 01:53:39.050
hey,
can you see if you can get Michael to visit with us?

1722
01:53:39.650 --> 01:53:44.330
And so,
uh,
we were still training in Bloomington.

1723
01:53:44.331 --> 01:53:48.590
So I,
I brought the subject up with Michael.
What happened was,
uh,

1724
01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:53.510
I don't know exactly how this happened,
but Vern Fleming,

1725
01:53:53.511 --> 01:53:57.440
who was on a team from Georgia,
Patrick Ewing,
myself and Michael,

1726
01:53:57.441 --> 01:54:00.050
we were inseparable.
The whole and Olympic experience.

1727
01:54:00.230 --> 01:54:04.220
We went everywhere together.
We,
and we were like the four Amigos.

1728
01:54:04.221 --> 01:54:07.870
We'd go to Mcdonald's,
we go to the movies,
a shopping mall,

1729
01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:10.370
wherever we did was always the four of us.
And,

1730
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:16.030
and so I developed a really a unique relationship with Michael.

1731
01:54:16.621 --> 01:54:20.300
So from time to time I would bring it up to him about the Nike thing without

1732
01:54:20.301 --> 01:54:24.200
being overbearing.
And in the very beginning said,
coach,
he says,

1733
01:54:24.410 --> 01:54:28.420
I have no interest in Nike.
I'm an Adidas guy.
I'm going to go to a date as a,

1734
01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:30.260
I don't even like their product.

1735
01:54:30.710 --> 01:54:35.570
And so every now and then I would bring it up and he would say,
coach,

1736
01:54:35.571 --> 01:54:39.110
I'm telling you,
man,
it's a waste of time.
I'm going to be an Adidas guy.

1737
01:54:39.590 --> 01:54:41.970
So now we get through the,
uh,

1738
01:54:42.030 --> 01:54:46.220
we're at the Olympics and we get through pool play and we have a day off.

1739
01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:51.110
And so Sonny Vaccaro calls and he says,
Hey,
can you bring Michael,

1740
01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:55.280
get him to come over and meet,
meet me at Tony Roma's in Santa Monica.

1741
01:54:55.281 --> 01:55:00.260
So I bring it up to Mike and I think just out of frustration to get rid of me,

1742
01:55:00.261 --> 01:55:04.490
he just said,
okay,
I'll go.
So we're going over in the car and that he said,

1743
01:55:04.491 --> 01:55:08.400
coaches,
so I'm only doing this for you.
He said that,
uh,

1744
01:55:08.450 --> 01:55:11.990
it's a waste of time or whatever a Nike offers me,

1745
01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:15.470
I'm going to take it to a date as significant data.
Some matches it.
That's it.

1746
01:55:15.471 --> 01:55:19.940
That's who I want to be.
So to fast forward,

1747
01:55:19.941 --> 01:55:20.774
he ends up,

1748
01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:25.130
him and his mom and dad and David Fall come up to Nike for a visit.

1749
01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:28.400
And the meeting is as successful,

1750
01:55:28.401 --> 01:55:32.810
but it didn't move the needle because Michael was still convinced that he should

1751
01:55:32.811 --> 01:55:37.700
go with,
uh,
under Armour.
But part of the Nike,
Adidas,
I mean,
I'm sorry,

1752
01:55:37.701 --> 01:55:41.690
w w w was the Datas.
And so part of the deal was,

1753
01:55:41.691 --> 01:55:44.660
at that time there was no such thing as a signature shoe.

1754
01:55:44.661 --> 01:55:48.060
And so David Falk came up with this idea of Air Jordan.

1755
01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:50.730
And so,
uh,

1756
01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:55.620
and Nike would make a signature shoe that would be marketed under this,

1757
01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:57.600
this logo of Air Jordan.

1758
01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:03.440
And so when the meeting goes,

1759
01:56:03.511 --> 01:56:07.050
well,
we think we got a shot.
And so tutors,

1760
01:56:07.051 --> 01:56:08.850
word Michael took the deal back,

1761
01:56:08.851 --> 01:56:13.770
or David took the deal back to Adidas and Adidas passed on it because of the

1762
01:56:13.771 --> 01:56:17.920
signature shoe thing,
because they didn't feel there was any market for it and,

1763
01:56:18.270 --> 01:56:22.840
and uh,
and they still made him an offer,
but,
but they,

1764
01:56:22.841 --> 01:56:27.090
they wouldn't go on the signature shooting.
And,
and I,
I,
if I remember correctly,

1765
01:56:27.091 --> 01:56:31.890
Michael was getting 5 cents a,
a royalty on the shoe.
So at any rate,

1766
01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:34.890
uh,
Michael ended up accepting the,
uh,

1767
01:56:35.490 --> 01:56:40.230
the offer from Nike and as they say on television,
the restless history.

1768
01:56:40.231 --> 01:56:44.700
But here we are today and,
and Jordan brand is,

1769
01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:47.640
is a business of it.
So and so,

1770
01:56:47.790 --> 01:56:51.690
so like there's Nike Inc and then you have these subsets at Hurley,

1771
01:56:51.870 --> 01:56:53.850
converse,
Jordan brand.

1772
01:56:53.851 --> 01:56:58.851
So Jordan brand is the second biggest seller of basketball shoes in the world.

1773
01:56:59.821 --> 01:57:03.000
Basketball shoes,
other than Nike Inc and a,

1774
01:57:03.010 --> 01:57:07.230
they sell more basketball shoes and under Armour or,
or Adidas.

1775
01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:12.480
And so here you go,
back to 84 in here today.

1776
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:13.170
Uh,

1777
01:57:13.170 --> 01:57:18.170
he sits at the head of one of the most profitable sport sports footwear

1778
01:57:18.331 --> 01:57:22.260
companies in,
in the world.
And what's interesting,

1779
01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:27.440
which historians will put in their rightful place one day is Nike was the first

1780
01:57:27.841 --> 01:57:32.841
fortune 500 company to take a black male and make them the face of their

1781
01:57:33.201 --> 01:57:34.230
company.
And then you,

1782
01:57:34.231 --> 01:57:38.550
I'm sure you're familiar with the spike Lee ads and all those things like that.

1783
01:57:38.970 --> 01:57:43.320
And so there was a huge a risk in some ways.

1784
01:57:43.321 --> 01:57:47.730
But one time I mentioned to Michael About Nike taken a risk.

1785
01:57:47.790 --> 01:57:52.020
And so he quickly came back to me,
he says,
Nike took a risk.
Hey,

1786
01:57:52.021 --> 01:57:52.854
I took a risk.

1787
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:58.550
<v 1>I see you,
you spent so much time</v>

1788
01:58:00.470 --> 01:58:05.470
teaching and guiding and cultivating players and uh,

1789
01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:12.110
people who work for you and the people around you.
Uh,

1790
01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:17.540
I had read,
and please feel free to correct this,
but that,
um,

1791
01:58:18.290 --> 01:58:21.380
you've said the most important conversation is the one you have with yourself.

1792
01:58:22.670 --> 01:58:27.310
Yeah.
So could you,
could you elaborate on that please?
Because I,
I,
I,
I've,

1793
01:58:27.590 --> 01:58:30.830
I think that self talk is,

1794
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:34.520
and I'm not sure that's what you're referring to,
but so,
so terribly important.

1795
01:58:34.860 --> 01:58:37.400
Uh,
so I'd love,
love to hear you just elaborate on that

1796
01:58:37.980 --> 01:58:41.680
<v 2>or I've gotten,
the more I've come to</v>

1797
01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:47.230
the conclusion that the,
the,

1798
01:58:47.260 --> 01:58:52.260
that the conversation that you have every day with yourself as you characterize

1799
01:58:53.141 --> 01:58:55.960
itself talk is so vital.

1800
01:58:55.961 --> 01:58:59.950
It's far more important than the conversations you have with those around you.

1801
01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:05.410
And the best part about the conversation with yourself is you're in total

1802
01:59:05.411 --> 01:59:10.090
control of that conversation.
You can craft the conversation any way you want to.

1803
01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:15.480
And so I try to have at least 90% of the conversations that I have with myself,

1804
01:59:20.531 --> 01:59:25.531
which I have two or three times a day that it's a positive self talk.

1805
01:59:25.841 --> 01:59:30.841
If I start to linger on to something a negative,

1806
01:59:31.330 --> 01:59:35.920
then what I'll do is I'll deal with it and discounted.

1807
01:59:36.190 --> 01:59:40.990
Uh,
for example,
uh,
uh,
since I'm Catholic,
I'll make this confession.

1808
01:59:41.170 --> 01:59:46.170
So this morning when I got up your reputation so impeccable that I was,

1809
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:51.040
I was,
uh,
I got up at five.
I'm really nervous.
I'm thinking to myself,
God,

1810
01:59:51.041 --> 01:59:54.340
what if I,
if I do a bad job,
I'll be so embarrassed.

1811
01:59:54.580 --> 01:59:58.410
And so the minute I started thinking that I said,
nope,
that's not it.

1812
01:59:58.450 --> 02:00:02.050
Get fired up man.
You're going to do it.
And I'm so I'm in,
I'm in,

1813
02:00:02.110 --> 02:00:04.480
I'm in the bathroom and I'm,
I'm,

1814
02:00:04.510 --> 02:00:09.510
I'm doing this motivational talk for myself to eradicate any doubt that I have.

1815
02:00:10.150 --> 02:00:13.420
And,
and,
and I keep saying to myself,
you got to go in here.

1816
02:00:13.421 --> 02:00:15.550
You got to give me your best shot.
You can do it.

1817
02:00:15.850 --> 02:00:19.990
So I'm getting myself fired up for it.
And this is out loud.
Yeah,

1818
02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:22.490
I'm in because uh,
uh,

1819
02:00:22.540 --> 02:00:27.540
I really spend as much time as probably at least I wouldn't say probably once a

1820
02:00:30.011 --> 02:00:35.011
day I'll find an hour to just go someplace and sit by myself.

1821
02:00:35.530 --> 02:00:40.530
And all I do is take a notebook and is putting in a pen in front of me and not

1822
02:00:41.171 --> 02:00:43.900
just sit there and think whatever comes into my mind.

1823
02:00:44.110 --> 02:00:47.140
And then I start to fixate on those things and,

1824
02:00:47.680 --> 02:00:52.680
or I'll write down notes as a result of something that I think or are write out

1825
02:00:53.201 --> 02:00:56.290
a strategy.
For example,

1826
02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:01.120
the way I govern my day,
Tim is,
is,
uh,

1827
02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:06.100
I get up in the morning and I put my two feet beside the bed and I say to

1828
02:01:06.101 --> 02:01:09.400
myself,
okay,
George,
you only have two choices today.

1829
02:01:09.401 --> 02:01:13.180
These are the only two choices that you have.
And you got to make one.

1830
02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:17.470
And the two choices are to be happy or to be very happy and the,

1831
02:01:17.471 --> 02:01:18.850
and there is no other choice.

1832
02:01:18.910 --> 02:01:23.910
And so then I start to plan a plan out my day and I'm on.

1833
02:01:23.980 --> 02:01:28.410
And so I have these,
these points of focus energy,
uh,

1834
02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:33.310
a time and energy management,
time management,
environmental management,

1835
02:01:33.311 --> 02:01:37.240
productivity.
And to me,
productivity is a byproduct of the other three.

1836
02:01:37.570 --> 02:01:42.200
So how do I manage my,
my energy every day sorted?

1837
02:01:42.230 --> 02:01:44.900
I can,
I can be at maximum efficiency.

1838
02:01:45.260 --> 02:01:48.500
So one of the things I try to do is declutter my mind.

1839
02:01:48.501 --> 02:01:52.970
I won't do any more than four things a day.
And it,
it,

1840
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:56.480
it reverts back to something,
one of the presidents at Nike,

1841
02:01:56.481 --> 02:01:59.420
Charlie Denson said one time in a leadership meeting,
he said,

1842
02:01:59.421 --> 02:02:00.710
let me ask you guys this,

1843
02:02:01.010 --> 02:02:06.010
would we be better off doing 25 things good or will we be better off doing six

1844
02:02:08.211 --> 02:02:10.880
things?
Great.
And so to me,

1845
02:02:10.881 --> 02:02:13.610
to make simplify my day,

1846
02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:17.860
I will not do more than four things.
I,
I,

1847
02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:22.190
I tried to limit to meetings to two.
And if it's too,

1848
02:02:22.191 --> 02:02:27.110
one of them is usually a breakfast meeting.
When I go into the office I have,

1849
02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:32.200
I have a total commitment once I get into the office to be totally focused on,

1850
02:02:33.770 --> 02:02:37.990
on business matters,
try to be as disciplined as I can,

1851
02:02:37.991 --> 02:02:42.890
not to get on the telephone and,
and also to meet with,

1852
02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:45.080
with the two people that work with me.

1853
02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:50.080
We meet every single day and we talk as a team because I want us to function as

1854
02:02:51.921 --> 02:02:55.280
a team.
I want each person's opinion to be valued.

1855
02:02:55.550 --> 02:03:00.500
If one person happens to be 50 years younger than me,
so what their,

1856
02:03:00.501 --> 02:03:03.320
their,
their uh,
their opinion is valuable to me.

1857
02:03:03.590 --> 02:03:07.640
I respect everyone's knowledge and I think to myself,

1858
02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:10.760
they know something that I don't know.
And so I,

1859
02:03:10.761 --> 02:03:14.000
I want it valued our opinions.
So,
uh,

1860
02:03:14.060 --> 02:03:18.830
we meet every day as a staff.
We talk about things and,
and uh,

1861
02:03:18.860 --> 02:03:23.690
it helps me grow and,
and it keeps my day simplified.
I try to clean,

1862
02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:28.740
uh,
try to once a week have a,
a personal audit.
I,

1863
02:03:28.741 --> 02:03:33.370
I go back through the week and an audit my week and,
and,
and,

1864
02:03:33.380 --> 02:03:36.230
and make course corrections along the way.

1865
02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:40.670
So that's when I really get into the self talk part is having these little

1866
02:03:40.671 --> 02:03:45.230
mental audits that my life is just not going on.
And on and on.
I,

1867
02:03:45.290 --> 02:03:49.820
I try to evaluate am I making progress?
What am I doing that's good?

1868
02:03:49.821 --> 02:03:54.200
What am I doing that's not working?
And then make those course corrections.

1869
02:03:54.201 --> 02:03:56.600
And at 80 years old,

1870
02:03:56.601 --> 02:04:00.710
I tried to hold myself to the most severe standards.
Uh,

1871
02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:02.240
and,
and I,

1872
02:04:02.300 --> 02:04:06.740
I just despise the idea of retirement.

1873
02:04:06.741 --> 02:04:07.890
And I think that it's,

1874
02:04:08.130 --> 02:04:13.130
it's the biggest farce that's ever been predicated on us is this idea of

1875
02:04:13.191 --> 02:04:16.550
retirement.
Cause the first thing that happens to you when you retire,

1876
02:04:16.551 --> 02:04:20.400
you're physically and then you retire mentally and then you're,
you're,

1877
02:04:20.450 --> 02:04:23.900
you just taken up residence in,
in,
in,
in,
in society.

1878
02:04:24.290 --> 02:04:28.280
And I don't ever want to be a resident of society.

1879
02:04:28.281 --> 02:04:31.940
I want to be a contributor to society.
When you,

1880
02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:36.980
you seem like you're just getting warmed up.
Uh,
we have lots of energy.

1881
02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:43.660
What are you most excited about,
uh,
these days in working on?
Well,

1882
02:04:43.710 --> 02:04:46.890
what I get most excited about is just waiting.
When you're 80 years old,

1883
02:04:46.891 --> 02:04:51.180
you gave you damn sure better be excited that you wake up the next morning and

1884
02:04:51.181 --> 02:04:53.340
you have a growth opportunity.

1885
02:04:53.730 --> 02:04:58.380
I'm still trying to understand like most of us,

1886
02:04:58.580 --> 02:05:01.800
what the,
what the future is an a be like,

1887
02:05:01.801 --> 02:05:06.240
and how can I get to the future first and what's the future gonna be like?

1888
02:05:06.241 --> 02:05:10.590
But I read a lot of books and talk to a lot of people,
but,
uh,

1889
02:05:10.860 --> 02:05:15.180
I don't know if anybody can really tell you what the world's going to be like

1890
02:05:15.181 --> 02:05:19.920
five years from now,
not 10 years from now,
but five years from now.

1891
02:05:20.340 --> 02:05:22.140
Uh,
we're,
we're,

1892
02:05:22.141 --> 02:05:25.760
we're in a society where it'd be,

1893
02:05:25.770 --> 02:05:28.290
who's all of us to be comfortable with,

1894
02:05:28.300 --> 02:05:31.470
with change and to be comfortable with being uncomfortable.

1895
02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:36.090
If you could,
metaphorically speaking,
put

1896
02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:42.180
anything on a billboard,
not commercial,
but a message,
a quote,

1897
02:05:42.210 --> 02:05:43.650
a word,
a question.

1898
02:05:43.710 --> 02:05:48.710
Somebody else's quote could be anything to get out to millions or billions of

1899
02:05:48.961 --> 02:05:53.400
people.
What,
what type of message or word or quit or anything might,

1900
02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:54.750
might you put on that billboard?

1901
02:05:57.420 --> 02:06:01.650
I would say if I could put up a billboard,
the,

1902
02:06:02.180 --> 02:06:05.880
and the message to people,
the quote would be,
if it is to be,

1903
02:06:05.881 --> 02:06:10.380
it's up to me because at the end of the day,
uh,

1904
02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:15.800
each of us have an individual responsibility to ourselves and to,

1905
02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:17.870
to our society,
to,

1906
02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:21.810
to figure out ways to be positive difference makers.
And,

1907
02:06:21.950 --> 02:06:25.060
and it all starts in life.
Uh,
uh,

1908
02:06:25.110 --> 02:06:29.230
I'm fondest reminding myself that nobody's going to row your boat for you,

1909
02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:29.811
but you,

1910
02:06:29.811 --> 02:06:33.120
you got to get in and you got to roll your boat to the other side of the,

1911
02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:34.313
the late.

1912
02:06:34.410 --> 02:06:38.580
And so I would remind people,

1913
02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:43.590
as I said,
if it is to be,
it's up to me.
And that's something that,
uh,

1914
02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:47.490
I had on my office door,
I had a big sign at Washington state,

1915
02:06:47.491 --> 02:06:51.510
I had it on my office door.
It's something that I've tried to,

1916
02:06:51.630 --> 02:06:56.630
to make an indelible mark on my brain that it's up to me if changes about the

1917
02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:01.110
best,
the most authentic change takes place

1918
02:07:02.820 --> 02:07:07.680
within yourself.
And so a,
B,
and oftentimes in life,

1919
02:07:07.681 --> 02:07:12.180
Tim,
as you know,
the most important person you ever get to lead is yourself.

1920
02:07:12.181 --> 02:07:15.090
And if you can't lead yourself,
how are you going to lead other people?

1921
02:07:15.091 --> 02:07:19.440
And so I would like to challenge people to,

1922
02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:20.440
to,

1923
02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:25.440
to start to look within before they look out is to look within and,

1924
02:07:26.421 --> 02:07:31.240
and w and what are,
what are the things that I can do to,
to,
to,

1925
02:07:31.241 --> 02:07:32.074
uh,

1926
02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:37.300
to be a positive change in Mike maker in my life and in the life of others.

1927
02:07:37.301 --> 02:07:40.030
So when we talk about being a positive change maker,

1928
02:07:40.300 --> 02:07:44.740
the thought process is this is about trying to change society.

1929
02:07:44.980 --> 02:07:49.390
But when I hear people all say to something that had changed a world,
what would,

1930
02:07:49.420 --> 02:07:53.230
if you want to do something that's going to change the world,
you change first.

1931
02:07:53.260 --> 02:07:56.650
And that's going to,
that's it.
And if everybody started to feel that way,

1932
02:07:56.651 --> 02:08:00.490
we'd have this huge movement of change that would be authentic

1933
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:05.180
<v 1>here.
Here,
I'm getting all fired up and get it that coach.</v>

1934
02:08:05.410 --> 02:08:08.630
Uh,
I want to be respectful of your time.

1935
02:08:09.320 --> 02:08:11.810
So I think we're going to wrap up shortly here,

1936
02:08:11.811 --> 02:08:15.050
but is there anything else you'd like to share?
Any other parting words?

1937
02:08:15.410 --> 02:08:19.640
Certainly people can find you at George Raveling on Twitter,
Instagram,
Facebook,

1938
02:08:19.641 --> 02:08:22.370
linkedin website,
coach George raveling.com.

1939
02:08:22.371 --> 02:08:25.280
I encourage everybody to check it out,
but is there,

1940
02:08:25.281 --> 02:08:27.650
is there anything else that you'd like to mention?
Yes.
He

1941
02:08:27.650 --> 02:08:32.420
<v 2>pulled me off the hook because all my Alma,
you full advisors said,
coach,</v>

1942
02:08:32.421 --> 02:08:35.720
make sure you tell people how to,
how to stay in touch with you.

1943
02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:41.200
But it's all technology has helped me be,

1944
02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:48.770
uh,
create a platform of sharing the,
try to share one thing.

1945
02:08:48.771 --> 02:08:51.620
My grandma's,
she said to me one time,
she was correcting me and,

1946
02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:56.540
and I also will smart Aleke.
And so she looked at me in a stern way and she said,

1947
02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:59.060
she said,
boy,
let me tell you something.

1948
02:08:59.061 --> 02:09:02.570
I know where the potholes are in life and maybe if you listen to me,

1949
02:09:02.571 --> 02:09:06.450
I can help you avoid stepping into them.
So at 80 years old,
I,

1950
02:09:06.650 --> 02:09:09.300
I think of my grandma and I say,
Hey,

1951
02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:13.610
I know where a lot of the potholes are in life and maybe I can tell you where

1952
02:09:13.611 --> 02:09:16.320
they are and share my life experiences what you,

1953
02:09:16.321 --> 02:09:19.330
so that you don't have to step into those potholes.

1954
02:09:19.340 --> 02:09:23.780
And so that's what I try to do is,
is to,
to share.

1955
02:09:24.090 --> 02:09:25.640
A old guy told me one time,

1956
02:09:25.641 --> 02:09:29.900
nothing in life is of any value unless you can share it with other people.

1957
02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:33.440
And so that is the essence of me at 80 years old.

1958
02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:38.000
What is it that I have that I can share with others and what can I give away?

1959
02:09:38.660 --> 02:09:42.420
I,
Eh,
I don't even know if I said this to my wife yet.
So you,

1960
02:09:42.500 --> 02:09:45.740
you're going to be the beneficiary of,
of,
of,
of a movement.

1961
02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:50.900
I now have committed that I'm going to try to give away most of my personal

1962
02:09:50.901 --> 02:09:54.890
belongings and I'm going to give away all my clothes and my books.
I'm alone.

1963
02:09:55.130 --> 02:09:59.210
I'm trying to give away as much stuff as I can to simplify my life.

1964
02:09:59.510 --> 02:10:02.990
I can only wear one pair of shoes.
I can only wear one pair of underwear.

1965
02:10:02.990 --> 02:10:04.370
I don't need all these things.

1966
02:10:04.371 --> 02:10:08.270
And so I'm going to rid myself of all these,

1967
02:10:08.540 --> 02:10:13.540
these material things that I thought were important that at eight years old,

1968
02:10:14.060 --> 02:10:17.960
the money's not that I learned.
Money's not that important.
Uh,

1969
02:10:18.020 --> 02:10:22.280
collecting things are not that important.
Uh,
how you dress.

1970
02:10:22.940 --> 02:10:27.230
All those things become a us,
what I call surrender.

1971
02:10:27.231 --> 02:10:30.500
Someone tells you what time they get up in the morning,
what time they go to bed,

1972
02:10:30.501 --> 02:10:32.990
what to eat,
what the dress or how to.

1973
02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:37.590
And so we ended up being prisoners of someone else's expectations.

1974
02:10:37.591 --> 02:10:41.960
So I want to live to whatever time I have left and I want to,

1975
02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:46.580
as Martin Luther King said,
free at last,
free at last.
Thank God Almighty,

1976
02:10:46.581 --> 02:10:51.560
we are free at last.
I just want to be free of all these,
these,

1977
02:10:51.590 --> 02:10:56.590
these fences that society's put up around me and I want to try to find out where

1978
02:10:57.651 --> 02:11:01.460
are my outer limits.
And once you take down the fences,

1979
02:11:01.670 --> 02:11:04.340
you allow a person to seek their outer limits.

1980
02:11:04.341 --> 02:11:07.820
And that's what I'm trying to do at eight years old is to figure out where my

1981
02:11:07.821 --> 02:11:10.360
outer limits are and to keep reaching for.

1982
02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:16.850
<v 1>Well coach I hope to have many more conversations with you.
So,</v>

1983
02:11:16.990 --> 02:11:21.160
uh,
thanks so much sir.
Thank you.
And uh,

1984
02:11:21.740 --> 02:11:24.620
may you,
may you be around for at least another 80,

1985
02:11:25.340 --> 02:11:30.230
and what a gift of the conversation.
Thank you.
Thank you.

1986
02:11:30.231 --> 02:11:35.231
I appreciate you giving me the time and for everybody listening for links to

1987
02:11:36.021 --> 02:11:37.070
everything we talked about,

1988
02:11:37.071 --> 02:11:42.071
certainly where you can find coach Raveling online and learn what he's up to in

1989
02:11:42.171 --> 02:11:46.460
addition to the books that we discussed and everything else you can find all of

1990
02:11:46.461 --> 02:11:51.461

Until next time.

1992
02:11:57.110 --> 02:11:58.370
Thank you for listening.

1993
02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:09.270
<v 3>Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

1994
02:12:09.690 --> 02:12:12.300
Number one.
This is five bullet Friday.

1995
02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:15.600
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1996
02:12:15.601 --> 02:12:19.740
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

1997
02:12:19.741 --> 02:12:23.730
little morsel of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very short

1998
02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:28.260
email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been pondering

1999
02:12:28.261 --> 02:12:31.950
over the week.
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

2000
02:12:31.951 --> 02:12:35.400
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2001
02:12:35.401 --> 02:12:39.690
somehow dug up in the,
uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

2002
02:12:39.990 --> 02:12:44.990
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

2003
02:12:45.690 --> 02:12:48.390
close friends.
For instance,
it's very short.

2004
02:12:48.450 --> 02:12:53.430
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

2005

So if you want to receive that,

which is a fiction book I used to reintroduce nonfiction purists to the beauty

2048
02:15:22.051 --> 02:15:25.290
and truth and enjoyment,
affection graveyard book.

2049
02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:28.590
It is incredible and I like the version that Neil reads himself,

2050
02:15:28.620 --> 02:15:31.860
but the entire ensemble cast is also fun.
