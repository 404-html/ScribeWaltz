00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.870
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.871 --> 00:00:06.220
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.280
No one else will be posting a question.
Now

4
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.460
I'm a cybernetic organism living.

5
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.230
<v 2>This episode is brought to you by fresh books,
man.
Oh Man.</v>

6
00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:31.730
Do a lot of listeners to this podcast and readers of mine love fresh books to

7
00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:35.360
the extent that I ended up meeting with the CEO not very long ago.

8
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.490
Why are they so popular?
Well,

9
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.750
they are the number one cloud accounting software designed exclusively for self

10
00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:43.100
employed professionals.

11
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.860
That's many of you and used by more than 10 million people.

12
00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:49.850
You can send invoices,
track your time,
and get paid very,
very quickly,

13
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.440
which suits the needs of a lot of freelancers,
a lots of Antoine vose and beyond.

14
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.720
You can't take pictures of receipts.

15
00:00:56.721 --> 00:00:58.190
You can link your credit card and debit card,

16
00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:03.170
so all the things you buy automatically appear in your fresh books in the right

17
00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:06.770
category,
so on and so forth.
Makes taxes easy,
makes invoices easy.

18
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:11.450
It makes your life easier.
And also in fact,
I'd recommend a pdf.

19
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.370
Uh,
they didn't ask me to read this part by the way.

20
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.230
They'd put the other pdf awhile back called breaking the time barrier subtitle,

21
00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:21.260
how to unlock your true earning potential so you can search for breaking the

22
00:01:21.261 --> 00:01:23.510
time barrier.
A lot of people ask me,

23
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.100
how can I get a four hour work week with a service business and the story in

24
00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:31.700
that Ebook,
it's pdf is the short answer is really,
really good.

25
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.490
So I think you should also check that out.

This episode is brought to you by me undies.

33
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.170
I've spent the last few years wearing underwear from these guys,

34
00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:16.720
24 seven or close to it outside of showers and sexy time and swimming and they

35
00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:20.300
are the most comfortable and colorful underwear I've ever owned.

36
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.360
You just check out the camouflage boxer briefs.
I'm a big fan.

37
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.580
Me undies are designed in La and made from sustainably sourced micro Madell.

38
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.360
What's that?
It is a fabric of three times softer than cotton.
Trust me.

39
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.240
Try it out.
You'll understand why I wear these so much.

40
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.980
If underwear isn't your thing though,

41
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.620
like I would imagine everyone wears underwear,
but if it isn't your thing,

42
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.180
Mandy is also makes socks.
Their socks are spun from premium material,

43
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.070
making them just as comfortable as the underwear.

This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

56
00:03:31.671 --> 00:03:36.530
each episode is my job to deconstruct world class performers from all different

57
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.290
spheres of life,
arenas of competition.

58
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.590
This time around it is entrepreneurship business in just general awesomeness.

59
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.970
We have Arianna Huffington.

60
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.200
You can find her on Twitter at Ariana hough and elsewhere.

61
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.920

She has been named to time magazines,

62
00:03:54.921 --> 00:03:58.250
list of the world's 100 most influential people in Forbes.

63
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.610
Most powerful women list originally from Greece.

64
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.170
She moved to England when she was 16 and graduated from Cambridge with an Emmy

65
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.380

In May,
2005 she launched the Huffington Post,

66
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.490
a news and blog side.

67
00:04:10.491 --> 00:04:14.750
They quickly became one of the most widely read linked to and frequently cited

68
00:04:14.751 --> 00:04:16.100
media brands on the Internet.

And in 2012 won a Pulitzer Prize for national reporting in August,

70

transforming your life one night at a time.

79
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.030
This is a very wide ranging conversation.
We get into plenty of tactics.

80
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.500
She has a any,
an expert storyteller and very,
very funny to boot.

So I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.
So without further ado,

82
00:05:07.431 --> 00:05:10.730
here is my conversation with Arianna Huffington.

83
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.800
Ariana,
welcome to the show.
Thank you team.
Uh,

84
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.820
I love your podcast and I'm really happy to be part of it.

85
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.831
Well,

86
00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:27.831
I have had so much fun interacting with you over the years and also observing

87
00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:31.860
you in environments where you get to ask a lot of questions.

88
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.630
So I'm happy to have the chance to turn the tables and actually dig into your

89
00:05:36.631 --> 00:05:39.300
story because you're always highlighting people around you.

90
00:05:39.301 --> 00:05:44.301
And now it's my chance to turn it around and dig into a lot of the background

91
00:05:44.551 --> 00:05:45.361
that I haven't heard.

92
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:49.620
But I wanted to start with a question about breakfast because we did it as a

93
00:05:49.621 --> 00:05:52.800
sound check.
I think people will enjoy it.

94
00:05:52.801 --> 00:05:56.200
So what did you have for breakfast this morning?
So,
um,

95
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.370
every morning I have coffee,

96
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.360
<v 3>bulletproof coffee for breakfast,
which is basically as you know,</v>

97
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.130
eh coffee who is the um,
organic butter.

98
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.730
And then I don't really like breakfast in terms of food.

99
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.040
Um,
I,
I was brought up in Greece and people don't have breakfast,

100
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.500
they have coffee and I'm so like a good Greek peasant girl.

101
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.860
I don't really eat until lunch time.

102
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.290
And if you want to know what's my favorite food at lunchtime,
it's breakfast

103
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.430
at lunch.
What is your go to?

104
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.060
My go to lunch is poached eggs.

105
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:46.210
Scrambled eggs are boiled eggs or any kind of breakfast food.

106
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:49.970
<v 2>You,
you have,</v>

107
00:06:49.971 --> 00:06:53.480
we're going to come back to all of your experimentation because you seem to have

108
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:57.710
tried just about everything,
but I want to give people just a taste perhaps.

109
00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.901
I mean,

110
00:06:57.901 --> 00:07:02.901
you've tried firewalking list-making journal keeping infrared Saunas at your

111
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:07.250
very game to experiment.

112
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.640
And I'm curious to know if there are any particular practices like those that

113
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.560
have,
have stuck with you,

114
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.970
that you've found continually valuable for you.

115
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:25.640
And it could be part of your daily routine or it could be some type of object.

116
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:26.474
Could be anything.

117
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.160
<v 3>So the bottom of my daily routine that actually started when I was 13 and which</v>

118
00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:36.510
is 3000 years ago.
And I,

119
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.570
I can't say I've done it consistently every day since,

120
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.470
but I have,
um,
in the last few years done,

121
00:07:44.471 --> 00:07:46.480
it consistently is meditating.

122
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:51.040
So I tried to do it right after I wake up,

123
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.720
before I engage in my day.
And,

124
00:07:55.721 --> 00:08:00.530
um,
and it's been absolutely amazing in terms of,
um,

125
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:04.690
how much peace and strength and joy,

126
00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:09.310
it's a broad me,
um,
as I go through my day,

127
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.530
no matter what the challenges and problems and,
um,

128
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:19.950
I've tried other things which I do intermittently but not every day like a

129
00:08:23.051 --> 00:08:24.760
writing down my dreams.

130
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:30.910
There are periods in my life when I wrote down my dreams every day and I have

131
00:08:30.911 --> 00:08:33.400
like,
um,

132
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.620
massive notebooks with my dreams.
Um,

133
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.910
and now I do it,
um,
sporadically,

134
00:08:42.911 --> 00:08:45.400
but I still keep a pen by my bed.

135
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:47.740
That's one of those bands that light in the night.

136
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:52.210
So you don't have to turn on the light because as you know,
um,

137
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:56.310
the less,
um,
intrusion of outside life,

138
00:08:56.311 --> 00:08:59.310
you have the more details of your dream,
you remember.

139
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.510
<v 2>So you have a pen that has a light on the front of it?
Yeah.</v>

140
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.700
<v 3>Yes.
I've never,
I'm amazed that I've never seen such a thing.
Okay.</v>

141
00:09:06.701 --> 00:09:07.870
I'm sending you one.

142
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.360
<v 2>Okay.
I will.
I will definitely try that.</v>

143
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:15.980
And I want to dig into the details of the meditation practice for a second.

144
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:20.630
What type of meditation do you practice or what does a session look like for
you?

145
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:26.420
<v 3>So I have tried every kind of meditation as you,</v>

146
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.160
as you kind of already announced.
You know,
I love experimenting.

147
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:36.390
So at first when I was 13,
I was,
believe it or not,

148
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:37.950
um,

149
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.980
initiated into transcendental meditation by Maharishi himself who happened to be

150
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:48.050
nothing's Greece.
And I was this 13 year old girl Maya,

151
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:53.120
who is very eccentric mother who was doing yoga and meditating and had convinced

152
00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:59.250
my sister and me that it will meditated.
We will be better at school.

153
00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:03.330
And since I was determined to get great grades,

154
00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:04.590
I thought this would help me.

155
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.420
<v 2>That is incredible.
I had no idea.</v>

156
00:10:08.421 --> 00:10:12.080
So you've called your mother a hero before.

157
00:10:12.081 --> 00:10:17.081
I've heard this and how we were going to dig into some of the lessons that you

158
00:10:18.591 --> 00:10:21.530
learned for from her.
I'd like to hear about that,
but how,

159
00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:26.620
how did you end up getting in front of Maharishi and being inducted in that way?

160
00:10:28.161 --> 00:10:29.330
How did that come together?

161
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.320
<v 3>Oh,
she sounded shame.
She was kind of amazing.
She,</v>

162
00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:36.950
she could make anything happen.
And,
um,

163
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.040
I don't know how she found out what he would be and how she got her daughter's

164
00:10:42.831 --> 00:10:46.160
there and,
but that's what happened.
And at that time,

165
00:10:46.161 --> 00:10:48.140
I didn't frankly think it was a big deal.

166
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:53.620
I have seen some also together with my two daughters who are now 26 and 28,

167
00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:01.460
been reintroduced a transcendental meditation by Bob Roth,

168
00:11:01.671 --> 00:11:05.000
who is at a fabulous teacher here in New York.

169
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.280
But also in the meantime,
I have practiced many other kinds of,

170
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:14.810
um,
many other kinds of meditation,
you know,
Buddhist Meditation,

171
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.830
compassion,
Meditation,
and also meditation,

172
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.800
um,
taught by John Roger,
you know,

173
00:11:21.801 --> 00:11:24.800
who started the movement for spiritual inner awareness.

174
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.680
So I am,

175
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.520
I basically date with a tone,

176
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.390
but focusing very much on my breath.
You know,
the,

177
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:41.420
the inhalation and exhalation is just a big part of my meditation.

178
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:42.283
And

179
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.410
on an everyday basis I do half an hour,
but over the weekend or whatever,

180
00:11:48.411 --> 00:11:52.370
I can,
uh,
I made one hour,
I may do two hours.

181
00:11:52.371 --> 00:11:56.770
And the other thing that is great team is that if I wake up in the middle of the

182
00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:00.550
night for whatever reason and I have trouble going back to sleep,

183
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:05.730
let Sam particularly stressed overthinking something,
I'm on a plane,

184
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.360
I'm jet lagged,
whatever.

185
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:13.060
I just never worry about it anymore.
I just say,
this is amazing.

186
00:12:13.061 --> 00:12:15.100
I have unlimited time to meditate.

187
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.840
<v 2>Right?
You were,
you were gifted,</v>

188
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.030
gifted tire or whatever it might be.

189
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.310
<v 3>Yes,
and normally you know when,
when it happens,</v>

190
00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:30.200
it's like three in the morning or which is a calling to the Dalai Lama,

191
00:12:30.201 --> 00:12:33.680
the optimal time to meditate.
I think,
hey,

192
00:12:33.681 --> 00:12:38.681
the Dalai Lama and I are meditating now and it's very clear,

193
00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:43.830
you know,
all the new science on sleep shows that Eh,

194
00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.770
something which an experiment,
which they call paradoxical intention,

195
00:12:48.771 --> 00:12:52.760
that if you take two groups of people and you tell one group to try and go back

196
00:12:52.761 --> 00:12:55.460
to sleep and another group to stay awake,

197
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.340
the group that you do,

198
00:12:58.341 --> 00:13:01.340
whom you said stairway falls asleep faster.

199
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.670
<v 2>That's funny.
Right?
It's like,</v>

200
00:13:03.671 --> 00:13:08.550
it's just one of those things where the key is to try it less,
not to try it.

201
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:09.221
<v 3>Exactly.</v>

202
00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:14.221
Especially around sleep because sleep is about surrender and trying to Saranda

203
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:15.400
is really hard.

204
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.270
<v 2>It is hard.
I think it's especially,
especially hard for type a personalities.</v>

205
00:13:19.271 --> 00:13:23.320
But you mentioned that your mother could make anything happen and you also

206
00:13:23.321 --> 00:13:24.640
mentioned that you were,

207
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.560
seemed at least driven to get very good grades.
Uh,

208
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:33.640
where did that,
where did that desire to get good grades come from?

209
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.930
<v 3>Um,
I don't really know where that came from,
but I,</v>

210
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.290
I was a venture of awkward kid.

211
00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:48.830
I was ridiculously tall for a Greek girl and I was literally five feet 10 when I

212
00:13:51.631 --> 00:13:56.631
was 13 years old and that they must of my classmates were five feet,

213
00:13:59.011 --> 00:14:03.990
nothing.
So I was literally tiring all over them.
I was in a girls' school.

214
00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:09.260
And um,
just to give you an idea of how bad that was,
eh,

215
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.270
I was excluded from the school parade

216
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:14.853
<v 2>cheese.</v>

217
00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.200
<v 3>Well,
they had the,
you know,</v>

218
00:14:18.201 --> 00:14:23.201
the tallest girls because I was too tall and I would stick out too much.

219
00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:29.930
So I also had very frizzy hair and wore glasses.

220
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:35.500
And so I just really spent a lot of time just reading and studying.

221
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.850
Um,
rather than having a lot of friends and being social.

222
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.830
<v 2>Okay,
well we're going to bounce around on the timeline a bit.</v>

223
00:14:46.831 --> 00:14:48.810
So that's just how my mind works.

224
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:54.530
I'm surprised to hear that because you are one of the most,

225
00:14:56.181 --> 00:14:59.750
if not the most socially adept person I've ever seen live.

226
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.450
I mean it's really like watching,
you know,

227
00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:07.700
Tom Brady playing football or something to watch you navigate and manage a room.

228
00:15:08.421 --> 00:15:10.310
I'm not kidding.
It's really impressive.
I mean,

229
00:15:10.311 --> 00:15:13.520
when I've been at say dinners with you,

230
00:15:13.521 --> 00:15:18.521
just observing how you weave everyone together is as enjoyable to me as the

231
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:23.180
conversations that I have.
So how did you learn to be social?

232
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:28.790
<v 3>Well,
Tim,
it's kind of interesting because I know it's hard to believe,
but I'm,</v>

233
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.780
I am an introvert and there isn't,

234
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:36.790
I know that is that I have experienced every emotion in my life,

235
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:42.740
including rage and fear and disappointment,
one and everything you can imagine.

236
00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:45.140
But I have never experienced loneliness.

237
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.130
I need time alone.

238
00:15:49.131 --> 00:15:54.131
And I long for time alone and I've never said that this is too much time alone.

239
00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:01.520
So I think that's a pretty good indication that I'm fundamentally an introvert

240
00:16:01.521 --> 00:16:04.340
who loves people.
Um,

241
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.940
provided I have enough time to refuel by myself.

242
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.800
And if I do,
then I love,
I love bringing people together.

243
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.810
I think that's one of the things I most love is kind of introducing my friends

244
00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:22.400
to each other and making sure that connecting,
um,

245
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:25.310
setting people are

246
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.450
numerous ways to really,
um,

247
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:35.620
make sure that people I care about are connected to each other.

248
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:40.570
<v 2>Okay.
So I want to be putting the pieces together slowly.</v>

249
00:16:40.571 --> 00:16:43.780
Kind of like the movie memento,
if anybody listening gets that.

250
00:16:43.781 --> 00:16:47.830
But what took you,
I know that we're,
we're jumping around,

251
00:16:47.831 --> 00:16:50.470
but I'm sort of following the scent as we go.
Uh,

252
00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:54.400
what led you to move to the UK?

253
00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.700
<v 3>So again,
um,</v>

254
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.880
that's another mother's story because I saw in a magazine at picture of

255
00:17:04.311 --> 00:17:05.930
Cambridge University

256
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:12.470
and I absolutely fell in love with it.
I have no idea why.

257
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:17.660
And I said to my mother with absolute conviction,
I want to go there.

258
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.310
And everybody else.
I said that to my dad.

259
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:26.780
My friends said,
don't be ridiculous.
You can't go there.

260
00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:31.550
Um,
how old were you at the time?
I was,
um,

261
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:35.320
14.
Okay.
Got It.
And,
um,

262
00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:40.220
um,
they all said you have no,
you don't speak English.

263
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:46.400
We have now my name and it's hard even for English girls to get into Cambridge.

264
00:17:46.401 --> 00:17:50.280
So forget about that.
And My mother said,
okay,

265
00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:52.320
let's find out how you can get to Canberra,

266
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:54.180
which I'm sure we can make that happen.

267
00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.560
And uh,
so she found out that I could take my,

268
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.820
what they call gcs,
general certificate of education,

269
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:08.330
which you needed to get at.
And I've,

270
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:12.300
you still do to get into English universities from the British Council,

271
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:17.940
but then I would have to take a special Cambridge exam that I could apply for a

272
00:18:17.941 --> 00:18:21.200
scholarship.
And,
um,

273
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.700
of course I immediately started learning English.

274
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:27.550
Up until then I had learned French because in,
uh,

275
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.850
in Greece a French was the official language at the time,

276
00:18:32.851 --> 00:18:34.710
the official foreign language.

277
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.550
So I had learned French at school,

278
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:43.290
immediately started learning English.
And,
um,
to cut a long story short,

279
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:48.850
I got a scholarship into Cambridge and definitely that would never have happened

280
00:18:49.531 --> 00:18:52.230
without my mother saying,
let's make that happen.

281
00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:56.120
She even said to me one day,
you know,

282
00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:01.160
God has this really cheap tickets and we can go and see Cambridge,

283
00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:04.530
not see anybody at Cadbury's,
just go see it.

284
00:19:04.531 --> 00:19:07.350
It was like an early form of visualization.

285
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:12.030
So she and I,
she and I was really flew to London,

286
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:16.320
took a train to Cambridge and just walked around and made it real for me.

287
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.840
And,
um,
and that was her,
that was how she was.
And uh,

288
00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.190
<v 2>so let me just make sure I understand this.</v>

289
00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:28.070
She took you to Cambridge so you could walk around Cambridge feeling like you

290
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:29.020
already part of it.

291
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:34.680
<v 3>Is that the exemption?
Exactly.
Wow.
I did.</v>

292
00:19:34.681 --> 00:19:38.040
Do you find that helpful for you?
I did.
It just made it,

293
00:19:38.041 --> 00:19:43.041
very rarely took it from a magazine picture to every El Place where we walked

294
00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:48.240
around for hours and,

295
00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:53.790
and saw the different colleges and had 'em coffee in the coffee shop.

296
00:19:54.121 --> 00:19:56.310
And so the river and,

297
00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:00.750
and of course by the end of it I wanted to go to Cambridge more than ever.

298
00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.060
<v 2>Hmm.
Is,</v>

299
00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:08.340
are there any particular parenting approaches or sayings that you use with your

300
00:20:10.331 --> 00:20:13.540
daughters that your mother used with you?
Has It,

301
00:20:13.541 --> 00:20:16.830
has her parenting style influenced how you parent

302
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:22.410
<v 3>completely?
Um,
my parenting style is identical except um,</v>

303
00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:27.400
I'm perpetually guilty because I'm definitely not as good as she was.

304
00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.940
And you know,
in any case,

305
00:20:30.941 --> 00:20:35.560
I think most mothers are guilty about something,
especially working mothers.

306
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:38.890
They say you take the baby out and they put the guilt in.

307
00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.450
But for me,

308
00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:47.170
I think the heart of it is unconditional.

309
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:49.263
Um,

310
00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:54.130
that was really her biggest gift to love you unconditionally while at the same

311
00:20:54.131 --> 00:20:58.750
time making you believe that you could do anything you wanted to try,

312
00:20:58.751 --> 00:21:03.730
but that if you failed,
not a problem because as she used to say,

313
00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:08.260
that was one of her favorite sayings.
Failure is not the opposite of success.

314
00:21:08.261 --> 00:21:10.180
It's a stepping stone to success.

315
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:16.320
So she made my sister and me feel very comfortable with failing.

316
00:21:16.781 --> 00:21:18.220
It does not a big deal.

317
00:21:18.221 --> 00:21:22.150
Taking risks was part of life and,

318
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:24.580
and failing was part of life.
And,

319
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:30.570
and then she was very funny and she used to say angels fly because they take

320
00:21:31.091 --> 00:21:35.920
themselves seriously and um,
and whatever happened,

321
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:40.390
bad things happening.
She just literally bad things or bad,

322
00:21:40.391 --> 00:21:41.530
bad things,
bad,

323
00:21:41.531 --> 00:21:46.531
bad things like my file father being a philanderer and her ending ending up

324
00:21:48.791 --> 00:21:53.540
separating from him,
they never actually got divorced.
Um,

325
00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:58.620
how she turned that around and still managed to create an amazingly warm loving

326
00:22:01.121 --> 00:22:02.200
home for us.

327
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:07.680
Or little things like our favorite thing for our birthdays was to go with her to

328
00:22:10.061 --> 00:22:13.660
two movies and a play and a,

329
00:22:13.661 --> 00:22:18.661
so we're ready to leave our apartment with my sister and we locked our keys in

330
00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:24.660
so every other mother would have just kind of dropped the program and try to get

331
00:22:26.201 --> 00:22:29.470
the keys,
et cetera.
My mother said,
okay,
no problem,

332
00:22:29.471 --> 00:22:32.680
lets us God with the movies and go to the play.

333
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.450
Let's keep to our schedule and we'll figure it out.
And,

334
00:22:37.451 --> 00:22:38.284
um,

335
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.790
of course by the time we are opposite the fire station.

336
00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:47.200
So when we got back she went to the fire station and asked if they could help
us.

337
00:22:47.201 --> 00:22:49.240
And because she was always such a giver,

338
00:22:49.241 --> 00:22:52.500
she would always bring everybody food and uh,

339
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:54.490
help them with anything they wanted.

340
00:22:55.030 --> 00:23:00.030
The firefighters put up a ladder up and let us in through the window.

341
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.440
<v 2>So it seems like I'd be just by watching your mother and experiencing that,</v>

342
00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:13.910
that over time you'd,
you'd feel like you could figure out just about anything.

343
00:23:13.911 --> 00:23:18.470
I mean,
just seeing someone being that adaptable I would think would,

344
00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.810
would really impact you.
I mean the,

345
00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:26.910
the question that I've been wanting to ask also about a few of these things.

346
00:23:27.681 --> 00:23:31.060
You mentioned the,
the failure as a stepping stone and so on.
You,

347
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:35.780
you talked about not speaking when you saw this picture of Cambridge in a

348
00:23:35.781 --> 00:23:36.614
magazine,

349
00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:41.860
but I read that you became really determined to excel in the debate society at

350
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:48.650
Cambridge.
I don't know if that's accurate or not,
but if it is,
can you,

351
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:54.290
can you walk us through your decision to do that and what you were thinking at

352
00:23:54.291 --> 00:23:57.410
the time?
Because I would imagine that would be very intimidating.

353
00:23:58.820 --> 00:23:59.191
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

354
00:23:59.191 --> 00:24:04.191
So actually what happened is that I was absolutely fascinated by debates at

355
00:24:06.171 --> 00:24:09.410
Cambridge.
I love them more than anything at Cambridge.

356
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:13.220
And I was determined to learn,
to speak,
you know,

357
00:24:13.221 --> 00:24:18.050
to learn to speak publicly.
And so I would literally

358
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:24.350
stay at every debate until the bitter end.
Um,

359
00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:29.380
and I would wait my turn to be called on to speak because they would have the

360
00:24:30.261 --> 00:24:33.620
main speakers and then anybody could,
could speak.

361
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.750
But I was terrible and I had a very heavy accent,
even heavier than now.

362
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:43.490
And so I was normally big glass,
like on a midnight,
but it didn't matter.

363
00:24:43.491 --> 00:24:48.020
I just sat there and made notes.
I learned.
And,
um,

364
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:53.950
but I hadn't really thought of a competing too to be elected to an office at the

365
00:24:55.161 --> 00:24:58.290
union that seemed like,
um,

366
00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:03.920
not something I could ever achieve.
So what happened is that one weekend,

367
00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:07.910
um,
when I was in London,

368
00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:13.310
a friend of mine put me down for the election to the standing committee,

369
00:25:13.311 --> 00:25:17.320
which was like the first step before you became a secretary and the vice braised

370
00:25:17.321 --> 00:25:20.780
and then the price then.
And um,

371
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:23.210
I was deeply embarrassed when I found out.

372
00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:27.380
I thought I would be humiliated and I tried to get my name off it,

373
00:25:27.381 --> 00:25:29.730
but it was too late.
The balance and be brilliant.

374
00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.450
And then do my m man surprise.
Aye.
Aye.

375
00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.073
Aye.

376
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:42.190
I was elected to the top of the standing committee who just a complete surprise.

377
00:25:42.201 --> 00:25:45.620
I would really never ever,
ever have guessed that this would happen.

378
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:50.380
But that's how I ended up,
you know,

379
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:55.040
then being elected secretary and vice,
but vice president and then president.

380
00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:00.680
So the,
the decision to learn to speak was very,

381
00:26:00.681 --> 00:26:04.130
very deliberate.
Them the five got,

382
00:26:04.131 --> 00:26:06.380
I ended up becoming president of the union,

383
00:26:06.381 --> 00:26:11.381
which conceptually it was a defining moment in terms of my career was completely

384
00:26:11.961 --> 00:26:15.380
accidental and dependent on,

385
00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:19.400
on this friend of mine who took matters into her own hands.

386
00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:25.400
Why was it a defining moment for you?
Why do you think that's a defining moment?

387
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.150
Because,
um,
it's hard to,

388
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:32.240
to understand how much at that time it meant to be elected president of the

389
00:26:32.241 --> 00:26:36.710
union.
Uh,
there was this kind of mythical,
um,

390
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:41.660
place that the Oxford and Cambridge Uni,
I'm just have a in,

391
00:26:41.661 --> 00:26:43.620
in the history of England,
you know,

392
00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:47.920
<v 2>that's a big deal.
I visited campus once and walked through the hallways.</v>

393
00:26:47.921 --> 00:26:49.780
It's a very,
very big deal.
And you were the,

394
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:53.650
I guess the first foreign and only the third female,
is that right?
Yeah.

395
00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.170
<v 3>Yes.
And,
um,</v>

396
00:26:55.740 --> 00:27:00.150
and so what happened is that when I was elected,
it was,

397
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:04.830
it was like front page news.
It's hard to,
it's hard to,

398
00:27:04.831 --> 00:27:07.500
we live in,
but like the times and the Guardian,

399
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:12.280
they had front page pictures of me on them.
There's this thrown that,

400
00:27:12.281 --> 00:27:15.990
the price and sits on.
And um,

401
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:20.850
and I was invited to do every show you can imagine.
And,

402
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.030
and that's,
uh,

403
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:28.280
when in the course of one of the debates that I was speaking at as president,

404
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:33.120
and we just televised because a lot of the debates were televised,

405
00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.753
um,

406
00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:40.320
a publisher and saw that he obeyed and asked me to write a book based on the

407
00:27:40.651 --> 00:27:42.330
views are expressed in the debates.

408
00:27:42.331 --> 00:27:46.200
So truly was defining because I had no intention of being a writer.

409
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:51.000
Sounds like everything that happened to me was not in,
uh,

410
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.660
but,
uh,
so I,

411
00:27:55.050 --> 00:28:00.050
I got this letter from Raj Davis Point and we're just actually published Germain

412
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.060
Greer's book,
the female eunuch.

413
00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.820
And he asked me if I would write a book expressing the views that I had

414
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:12.900
expressed in the,
in the debate.

415
00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:17.310
And I wrote back and I said,
I can't write.
And he said,
can you have lunch?

416
00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:18.673
And,

417
00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:25.970
and he took me to lunch and offered me a modest advance and he said,

418
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.930
if you,
if it turns out you can't write or I'll have lost,

419
00:28:30.931 --> 00:28:35.190
I think it was 6,000 pounds for a year.
So,
um,

420
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:39.660
if,
and otherwise,
he said,
I will publish the book.

421
00:28:39.661 --> 00:28:41.880
And that was my first book.

422
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:47.750
It changed the trajectory of my career because I had just gotten into the

423
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:53.190
Kennedy School of government to do a postgraduate degree there,
which I,

424
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:57.150
um,
I dropped in order to,
to write the book.

425
00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:00.510
<v 2>What was,
what was that first book?
What was the title?</v>

426
00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:05.680
<v 3>The title was the female woman and um,</v>

427
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:10.340
the message of the book,
what was really,
um,

428
00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:13.550
very matter of fact now because it was the fact,

429
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:18.440
my believe that women should be given equal respect for whatever they choose to

430
00:29:18.441 --> 00:29:21.710
do in their lives.
If they choose to have a career,

431
00:29:21.711 --> 00:29:23.360
everything should be open to them.

432
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:27.890
If they choose to be mothers and they can afford to do so and not have a career,

433
00:29:27.891 --> 00:29:30.170
they should be given equal respect for that.

434
00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.200
Now that now seems like no big deal.

435
00:29:33.201 --> 00:29:38.201
At the time it was very controversial because it was at the eras published in

436
00:29:38.721 --> 00:29:39.890
1973.

437
00:29:39.891 --> 00:29:44.891
I was 23 years and at the time it was at the moment,

438
00:29:46.411 --> 00:29:51.310
at the height of what was known as the Women's Liberation Movement when only

439
00:29:51.311 --> 00:29:52.450
career women

440
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.060
were respected.
You know,

441
00:29:57.070 --> 00:30:01.690
if you chose and you are able to financially,
um,

442
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:04.000
not to have a career,
uh,

443
00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:09.220
you are kind of dismissed as I'm having succumb to social conditioning or the

444
00:30:09.821 --> 00:30:12.910
patriarchy.
And,
um,

445
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:18.150
and I interviewed a lot of women who made a lot of difficult choices.

446
00:30:19.661 --> 00:30:22.180
Like they decide when I remember a woman saying,

447
00:30:22.181 --> 00:30:26.320
I haven't had a new code for,
um,
three years,

448
00:30:26.321 --> 00:30:30.820
but I want to bring up my children myself and then I can get back into the

449
00:30:30.821 --> 00:30:34.480
workplace.
So I wasn't saying that one choice was better than another,

450
00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:39.900
but that part of equality was equal respect for whatever choices women made.

451
00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:47.730
<v 2>You've had so many opportunities to interact with so many people who you could</v>

452
00:30:51.021 --> 00:30:52.990
potentially guide or mentor.

453
00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:56.840
And just given that we're somewhat on the subject,
I mean,

454
00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:00.590
if you were looking at one piece of that equation,
so you're looking at the,

455
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.800
the professional choice going into the business world.
Is,

456
00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:09.920
is the advice you would give a young man or young woman the same or is there

457
00:31:12.381 --> 00:31:17.000
different advice that you would give to young women who are considering really

458
00:31:17.001 --> 00:31:21.410
focusing on,
uh,
charging headfirst into the business world world?

459
00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:27.380
<v 3>Oh,
I'm absolutely,
I'm the same advice.</v>

460
00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:28.983
Um,

461
00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:35.800
the only thing that's different for women if they want to have children is,

462
00:31:36.111 --> 00:31:38.840
um,
do be aware of that.
I mean,

463
00:31:38.841 --> 00:31:41.120
now of course women can freeze the rags,

464
00:31:41.121 --> 00:31:46.121
so it gives them a longer timeline for becoming mothers or they can choose to

465
00:31:46.941 --> 00:31:48.860
adopt.
Um,

466
00:31:48.861 --> 00:31:53.480
so that's great because it gives women more flexibility.
But,

467
00:31:53.481 --> 00:31:54.314
um,

468
00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:59.890
I think the most important thing is to do really be honest with yourself.

469
00:32:00.081 --> 00:32:04.820
I mean,
I would not have been happy if I had not had,
um,

470
00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:05.720
my work.

471
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:11.230
I knew that was very important to me and I actually have never not worked.

472
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:18.020
Um,
and also would not have been happy if I had not had children.

473
00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:21.320
But I have many friends of mine who,
um,

474
00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.640
don't want children and they're perfectly happy.
So I,

475
00:32:25.641 --> 00:32:30.500
that's why I'm saying this is very individual and all that matters is to be

476
00:32:30.501 --> 00:32:33.170
ruthlessly honest with ourselves and,

477
00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:38.530
and basically making sure that the life we're following is the life we are for

478
00:32:39.681 --> 00:32:44.540
ourselves rather than the life that,
um,
has been,
uh,

479
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:48.770
chosen for us by society,

480
00:32:48.771 --> 00:32:50.720
our parents and friends.

481
00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.553
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

482
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:58.590
<v 2>Nike.
Now you have told us about one defining moment,</v>

483
00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:01.320
which was this,
uh,

484
00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:06.380
this appointment I guess on the throne and everything that came out of that.

485
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:10.400
If,
if we then look forward after that,
what,

486
00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.490
what would you consider the next sort of defining moment or defining decision,

487
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:18.690
uh,
in your life or the next that comes to mind for you?

488
00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:21.151
<v 3>Oh,</v>

489
00:33:21.151 --> 00:33:26.151
I could say then Max defining decision was deciding to leave this man that I was

490
00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:34.620
very much in love with that,
eh,
because he didn't want to have children.

491
00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:37.380
And by then I was 30.

492
00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:42.000
I had been with him since I was 23 for seven years.

493
00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:47.430
He was twice my age and half my size.

494
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:54.350
Uh,
he was,
uh,
an amazing writer.

495
00:33:54.351 --> 00:33:56.360
His name is Bernard Levin,

496
00:33:56.361 --> 00:34:00.830
and he was a great column raised for the London Times.

497
00:34:00.831 --> 00:34:05.720
And I'm also very much a writing mentor to me.

498
00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:11.120
Um,
but him,
he kept saying,
I don't want to have kids.

499
00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:14.680
I only want to have cats.
And,
um,

500
00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:18.650
and he was perfectly happy to be with me for the rest of his life,

501
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:22.490
but without children.
And I was very clear that I wanted to have children.

502
00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.470
Um,

503
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:29.470
so I made the decision to leave him and because I didn't trust myself not to go

504
00:34:30.741 --> 00:34:33.350
back to him if I had stayed in London,

505
00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:36.830
I left London and moved to New York.

506
00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:44.690
So everything that happened to me after that,
um,

507
00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:49.070
my,
the rest of my work,

508
00:34:49.071 --> 00:34:53.330
I'm launching the Huffington post to having my two daughters.

509
00:34:53.331 --> 00:34:57.350
All of it team happened because a man wouldn't marry me and have children with

510
00:34:57.351 --> 00:35:00.320
me.
So that's good.
Very [inaudible] that

511
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.250
<v 2>well,
it's kind of like if you have insomnia at three in the morning,
right?
Maybe,</v>

512
00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:08.960
maybe it's a,
it's sort of a hard,
a hard moment,
uh,

513
00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:13.010
an opportunity or a gift disguised as a very hard moment.

514
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:15.870
And,
uh,
the,
for those people who don't know,

515
00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:21.010
how did the Huffington Post's come to Bsu land in New York?
How,

516
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:23.810
how did the Huffington post come to be?

517
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:28.000
<v 3>Oh,
that's,
um,
the haven't been bossed is,
um,
many,</v>

518
00:35:28.001 --> 00:35:31.800
many years after I land in New York.
So I was born in 1950,

519
00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:33.550
so I'm 67.

520
00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:39.120
I left London and in 1980 when I was 30 and moved to New York and then continued

521
00:35:44.281 --> 00:35:46.410
writing,
you know,
written 15 books.

522
00:35:46.411 --> 00:35:49.740
And after the book that he would discuss the female woman,

523
00:35:49.741 --> 00:35:53.700
I wrote a book on political leadership called after reason,

524
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:57.570
which nobody wanted to buy.
But that's another story.

525
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
And then I wrote biographies of Maria Callas and later Babbo Picasa.

526
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.600
So when I came to New York,

527
00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:10.320
I had just published my biography of Maria Callas,

528
00:36:10.321 --> 00:36:12.750
who is an opera singer,

529
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:18.450
best known among people who don't love opera as the woman who was

530
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:24.130
very much in love with Aristotle Onassis.
But our nurses,

531
00:36:24.131 --> 00:36:27.790
laughter do married Jackie Kennedy.
Um,

532
00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:30.380
just to put in context and,
uh,

533
00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:35.680
so when I came to New York,
um,
my book and Maria Karla said,

534
00:36:35.681 --> 00:36:37.790
just been published.
And,
uh,

535
00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:41.950
so I was um,

536
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:46.030
which made it easier to move to New York because I was,
um,

537
00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:51.940
I was here,
um,
publicizing my book the book down.

538
00:36:51.941 --> 00:36:56.560
That would be a big best seller.
And um,

539
00:36:56.710 --> 00:37:01.180
any glad to eh,
my doing journalists,

540
00:37:01.181 --> 00:37:02.770
men writing more books.

541
00:37:02.771 --> 00:37:06.520
Why buy now moving and living in New York,

542
00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.390
<v 2>how 15 books is a lot of books.</v>

543
00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:15.780
What is your writing process or what helps you to be so prolific?

544
00:37:17.021 --> 00:37:21.190
I'm always impressed and have been impressed when I've considered how many books

545
00:37:21.191 --> 00:37:23.410
you've written,
uh,
what,

546
00:37:23.411 --> 00:37:27.680
what helps you to achieve that type of volume?
Okay.

547
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.140
<v 3>So my am writing process changed dramatically.</v>

548
00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:35.560
Um,
at the beginning,
um,

549
00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:40.590
my writing process was painstaking and incredibly slow because,

550
00:37:40.811 --> 00:37:41.644
um,

551
00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:46.860
I had this sort of inner Sansar so I would write a sentence and then they enter

552
00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:52.240
sensor would step in and say,
that's not the right word.
And I would,

553
00:37:52.241 --> 00:37:52.930
um,

554
00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:57.760
spend a long time arguing with myself about what the right word was.

555
00:37:58.930 --> 00:37:59.950
And then

556
00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:06.620
gradually I realized that I was able to speak without notes for an hour longer

557
00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:13.700
and that I should use that skill to create first drafts.

558
00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.080
So I started,
um,

559
00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:23.420
dictating my first draft idea lead to somebody I work with that I,

560
00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:28.740
because I like having that kind of response from someone.

561
00:38:28.741 --> 00:38:33.440
If you're in the same room and you are speaking and they're typing,
um,
but you,

562
00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:38.450
you kind of this mylar Gfo or they they show whether they liked or didn't like

563
00:38:39.731 --> 00:38:42.520
something.
And um,

564
00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:47.580
and that has dramatically accelerated my writing process because it's so much

565
00:38:49.901 --> 00:38:50.830
easier as you know,

566
00:38:50.831 --> 00:38:55.831
team to add it a first draft and edited extensively and go through multiple

567
00:38:57.581 --> 00:39:02.200
editing,
editing processes than it is to write a first draft.

568
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:03.971
<v 2>And is the,</v>

569
00:39:03.971 --> 00:39:08.830
is the person your speaking to interacting with you or asking you questions or

570
00:39:08.831 --> 00:39:10.720
are they just listening and transfers?

571
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.470
<v 3>Just listening.
I mean,</v>

572
00:39:12.471 --> 00:39:16.580
you know that that baffling free to interrupt and say anything,

573
00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:21.200
but largely it's just listening,
but just kind of,
you know how people listen,

574
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:23.840
but they,
they show you if they get,

575
00:39:23.841 --> 00:39:28.250
if they agree or if they liked something or they didn't get it.
It's like it's,

576
00:39:28.251 --> 00:39:30.350
it's very sad.
Low but obvious.

577
00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.930
<v 2>Oh,
for sure.
I mean,
you can see that's,</v>

578
00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:39.000
that's one thing I always pay attention to when I have proofreaders reading my

579
00:39:39.001 --> 00:39:42.840
material.
I like to be there when they read it because if they laugh,

580
00:39:42.841 --> 00:39:46.530
I always say,
okay,
what was that?
And they'll say,
oh no,
it was nothing.

581
00:39:46.531 --> 00:39:48.330
And I'm like,
no,
no,
no.
What was it?
What made you laugh?

582
00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:52.410
I always want to know what provokes the response.
Yes,

583
00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.190
no,
I asked about the,
the interaction,

584
00:39:56.191 --> 00:39:59.880
because I remember with the four hour work week in particular,

585
00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:04.170
I hit a point where I was really stuck and I was stuck,
not for a day,

586
00:40:04.171 --> 00:40:07.920
but for about two weeks and I didn't know how to tackle this chapter.

587
00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:09.630
So I decided to,

588
00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:14.700
I had the intention of having someone interview me so they could ghost write a

589
00:40:14.701 --> 00:40:18.530
first draft that I could then use as a jumping off point.
But I,

590
00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:23.930
I learned as they interviewed me over the course of about 90 minutes that they

591
00:40:25.231 --> 00:40:29.250
had actually helped me figure out how to fix the chapter just by interviewing me

592
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:32.000
because I was too close to the material.
Some.

593
00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:37.010
I'm really fascinated by using those types of tools to a jumpstart or like you

594
00:40:41.461 --> 00:40:45.090
said,
to get a first draft out because that is so difficult at times.

595
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.910
<v 3>Right.
I'm glad to hear that you,
you have a kind of similar process.</v>

596
00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:50.691
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

597
00:40:50.691 --> 00:40:55.691
The interviewing I find is a great way to take a step back from the material I

598
00:40:56.781 --> 00:40:59.240
never give.
If I need someone to interview me to,

599
00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:03.430
to figure out a given chapter or aspect of a book,
I,

600
00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:07.730
I never give them any background because I want them to come in fresh,

601
00:41:07.731 --> 00:41:12.650
like a reader who just picked it up off the shelf without any type of any type

602
00:41:12.651 --> 00:41:14.960
of context.
Uh,
so the,

603
00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.750
you're writing in working on all these books,

604
00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:23.330
when was the decision made to turn the Huffington post into a company or to

605
00:41:23.331 --> 00:41:24.380
create that company?

606
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:28.610
<v 3>So,
um,
by 2000,</v>

607
00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:33.020
I started seeing that a lot,

608
00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:38.140
very rich conversation was moving online and that a lot of the people I loved

609
00:41:39.441 --> 00:41:40.400
and admired,

610
00:41:40.401 --> 00:41:44.720
we're not going to be part of it because they were never going to start a blog.

611
00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:49.400
And because,
um,
um,
at the time,
you know,

612
00:41:49.401 --> 00:41:53.660
bloggers were seen as people who couldn't get a job and we're blogging,

613
00:41:53.661 --> 00:41:58.100
remember the cliche from their parents' basement.
Right,
right.

614
00:41:59.120 --> 00:41:59.870
And,
uh,

615
00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:04.610
so I started writing in my column.

616
00:42:04.611 --> 00:42:09.290
I had a call and we syndicated column at the time about bloggers and,
um,

617
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:10.910
and uh,

618
00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:15.720
I just really loved this,
uh,

619
00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:20.600
um,
what blogging was,
which just being more conversational,

620
00:42:20.601 --> 00:42:24.470
being Marty demand,
responding to your readers,

621
00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:28.160
they're respond back,
the whole interactive nature.

622
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.100
So I,
um,

623
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:36.130
decided together with my cofounder candy lab to launch the haven't done passed

624
00:42:37.311 --> 00:42:40.210
in 2005,
um,

625
00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:45.620
who I see as two things.
One was a collection of,

626
00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:47.870
and bloggers.

627
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:53.470
I'm commenting on anything from the events of the day to food,

628
00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:57.530
to a movies,
anything at all.
I mean,

629
00:42:57.531 --> 00:43:00.200
one of I was saying was if you have something to say,

630
00:43:00.201 --> 00:43:01.940
say it on the Huffington Post.

631
00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:08.080
And I'm also a journalistic enterprise where we practiced conventional

632
00:43:08.871 --> 00:43:13.040
journalism,
investigative journalism.
At the beginning,

633
00:43:13.041 --> 00:43:18.041
the blogging part was the dominant part until we started raising,

634
00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:22.970
raising and making money to be able to hire journalists.

635
00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:28.580
And,
uh,
the first day we launched it,
well,

636
00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:32.810
it's kind of a new day for blogging because suddenly we had,

637
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:38.110
we had on our front page and people like Nora Ephron and Walter Cronkite and

638
00:43:39.321 --> 00:43:44.321
John Cusack and Larry David and people were never blogged before.

639
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:49.070
And it began the process of elevating blogging,

640
00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.340
do something that of course,
now we all do.

641
00:43:52.341 --> 00:43:55.880
There's no journalist who isn't blogging at the same time.

642
00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:57.920
And,
um,

643
00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:03.730
and gradually we started adding journalists who ended up winning a Pulitzer for

644
00:44:03.801 --> 00:44:07.880
investigative journalists.
Men from the beginning,

645
00:44:07.881 --> 00:44:12.881
I saw huffpost as a combination of the best of the old and the best of the new.

646
00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:17.340
<v 2>How did you get all of those,
uh,</v>

647
00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:22.400
known names to participate during the lunch?

648
00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:25.620
What did you,
what did you say to them or how did you convince,

649
00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:26.910
how did you convince them to do that?

650
00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:32.350
<v 3>So what kind of people I had met and I wrote to them and basically my peach was,</v>

651
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:38.310
you wake up in the morning and you have something to say.

652
00:44:38.311 --> 00:44:41.280
I know you do about the events of the day,

653
00:44:41.281 --> 00:44:45.480
about a movie you saw last night about anything and,

654
00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:50.580
but you're busy.
You have a book to write.
Do you have a company to run?
Um,

655
00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:54.300
and you know,
sure you could write it for the New York Times,

656
00:44:54.301 --> 00:44:59.301
but you have to deal with editors and processes and you don't really bother.

657
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:05.510
Just send it to us and put it in an email and send it to me and we'll publish it

658
00:45:07.231 --> 00:45:09.240
exactly as you sent it to us.

659
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:13.080
And you will have entered the cultural bloodstream.

660
00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:17.160
You'll have entered the conversation and you don't have to do anything else.

661
00:45:17.161 --> 00:45:21.330
Then people can come and react,
take it to the next level.

662
00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:25.530
And it was amazing.
That's exactly what happened.
I remember,

663
00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.700
um,
I remember when,
um,

664
00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:33.540
the day that it was revealed who deep throat was,

665
00:45:33.541 --> 00:45:36.720
I don't know if you remember that team or if you were still in kindergarten.

666
00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.940
<v 2>So yeah,
I'm aware of it,</v>

667
00:45:40.941 --> 00:45:43.640
but I don't want to say I remember it because maybe I wasn't kindergarten,

668
00:45:43.641 --> 00:45:44.474
but I'm not sure.

669
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:48.910
<v 3>He does actually in 2005.</v>

670
00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:52.070
<v 2>Yeah,
there we go.
Then I was a few years after kindergarten,</v>

671
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.110
<v 3>so,
um,
and Nora Ephron called me and said,
listen,</v>

672
00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:59.840
everybody wants me to comment on that.

673
00:45:59.841 --> 00:46:02.030
The New York Times asked me to write about it.

674
00:46:02.031 --> 00:46:07.031
CNN wants me to go speak about it because she was at the time married to Carl

675
00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:12.050
Bernstein and everybody wanted to know,
did she know,
why did she think,

676
00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:14.480
etc. But she said,
you know what,

677
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:17.720
I'm instead going to write it for the Huffington Post.

678
00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:23.060
And she did.
It was a big moment for us.
Why did she choose to do that?

679
00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:27.170
Um,
she and I were friends.

680
00:46:27.171 --> 00:46:31.580
She believed in what I was doing and um,

681
00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:35.330
and she was Nora Ephron and she wanted to try new things.

682
00:46:35.331 --> 00:46:39.290
And as she said,
I don't want to put makeup on and go to CNN

683
00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:42.561
and a,

684
00:46:42.561 --> 00:46:46.640
and I'm writing another book and I don't want to spend time arguing with New

685
00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.040
York Times editors about a sentence,
right?

686
00:46:49.041 --> 00:46:53.330
I want to spend 20 minutes write this down and you publish it.

687
00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:55.790
And,

688
00:46:55.790 --> 00:47:00.790
but what was amazing team was what happened afterwards because Nora Ephron's

689
00:47:01.251 --> 00:47:02.900
piece was everywhere.

690
00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:07.010
It was in the New York Times and it was on CNN.

691
00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:11.780
And suddenly people began to realize I did no longer mattered.

692
00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.090
Whoever you wrote something,

693
00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:19.860
if it was interesting or newsworthy or important in some way or another,

694
00:47:20.541 --> 00:47:22.040
it would be everywhere.

695
00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:27.600
<v 2>So I want to,
I'm going to pick that up in a second,</v>

696
00:47:27.601 --> 00:47:28.680
but you see,

697
00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:33.800
as you were recalling the rough pitch that you gave to these people and you

698
00:47:34.001 --> 00:47:36.670
mentioned entering the cultural bloodstream.

699
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:41.500
So I've seen you in action talking to people,
brainstorming ideas,

700
00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:46.000
suggesting ideas,
and you're a,
you're a very,

701
00:47:46.001 --> 00:47:49.150
very good at pitching and persuading.

702
00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:53.680
Where did you pick that up?
Is that from debate or is it from something else?

703
00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:57.280
Are there other ways that you developed that skill because you're very good at

704
00:47:57.281 --> 00:47:58.114
it?

705
00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.800
<v 3>I think for me,
Eh,</v>

706
00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:06.840
persuasion is about seeing what does the other person want.

707
00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:12.250
Um,
I mean,
you remember you are now we're at the dinner,
um,

708
00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:16.760
a month ago and um,
there was,
um,

709
00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:19.990
famous designer that we will not mention his name.

710
00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:23.050
And um,
as you know,

711
00:48:23.051 --> 00:48:27.880
I believe that it's great if people were dedicated sleep wow.

712
00:48:27.881 --> 00:48:28.900
When they go to sleep,

713
00:48:28.901 --> 00:48:33.901
unless they like to sleep naked because it kind of rekindles the romance with

714
00:48:34.091 --> 00:48:38.950
sleep and it makes it clear to their brains and they're going to sleep.

715
00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:43.120
So I thought it would be great to get a,

716
00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:47.140
a big designer designing not just clothes but sleepwear.

717
00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:51.850
But he had already told me that he liked breaking rules and doing things

718
00:48:51.851 --> 00:48:54.580
differently.
And so for me,

719
00:48:54.581 --> 00:48:57.790
when I pitch the idea of designing sleepwear,

720
00:48:58.390 --> 00:49:00.670
I knew what the opening was that he,

721
00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:05.850
that he liked to break conventions and do things differently and that he was

722
00:49:06.071 --> 00:49:08.170
asking his team to do the same.

723
00:49:08.171 --> 00:49:11.740
So then that would be a really fun conversation.

724
00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:16.180
And we are talking about him designing sleepwear,
but for me,

725
00:49:16.181 --> 00:49:21.181
the keys to find out what is the common point of what I'd like to see happen and

726
00:49:21.971 --> 00:49:24.310
what the other person would like to see happen.

727
00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:28.470
<v 2>So if you,
if you,</v>

728
00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:33.090
I mean do you have a very good portfolio of skills for many of the things that

729
00:49:33.091 --> 00:49:37.680
you've ended up building?
And if you were,
for instance,

730
00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:40.440
teaching a wet,
you can choose the year,

731
00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:45.150
let's just call it either freshman year in college or senior year in college,

732
00:49:45.151 --> 00:49:49.140
you're teaching a seminar and it's a small group of students,

733
00:49:49.141 --> 00:49:54.141
let's call it 20 students and you're trying to get them ready for professional

734
00:49:55.171 --> 00:50:00.030
life or business life.
What would you focus on teaching them in this seminar?

735
00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:03.540
Let's just say it's once per week.
You've two to three hours with them.

736
00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:07.410
For us for a single semester.
What would you,
what would you teach?

737
00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:08.280
What would you focus on?

738
00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:10.041
<v 3>Oh,</v>

739
00:50:10.041 --> 00:50:15.041
right now I would absolutely focus on them prioritizing their own human capital.

740
00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:23.050
A lot of people think that success is about what we get from the outside,

741
00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:29.650
but the truth is that success is so based on what we can create,

742
00:50:32.590 --> 00:50:33.510
um,

743
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:38.560
from what we have inside us and how we can access that place of creativity and

744
00:50:39.531 --> 00:50:42.950
resilience and peace inside us.

745
00:50:42.951 --> 00:50:47.060
I'm so convinced of that now and um,

746
00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:52.800
and it's getting harder and harder because the distractions,
um,

747
00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:56.180
the invasiveness of technology are so overwhelming.

748
00:50:56.540 --> 00:51:00.050
So I don't think there's anything more important.
Um,

749
00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:02.480
it helps you come up with the best ideas.

750
00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:05.120
It helps you not burn out,

751
00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:10.550
which makes you more resilient in terms of facing knows and failure.

752
00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:13.340
So that would definitely be my seminar.

753
00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:15.090
<v 2>And what,</v>

754
00:51:15.090 --> 00:51:20.090
what tools or suggestions or practices would you try to impart to these

755
00:51:23.011 --> 00:51:26.040
students?
Because let's just say if we're talking about Cambridge,
they've,

756
00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:31.200
they've almost pre qualify.
It already is type a personalities probably,

757
00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:35.360
right?
I mean,
these are very ambitious kids.
Uh,

758
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:36.900
so what would you,

759
00:51:36.901 --> 00:51:41.901
are there any particular tools or philosophies or books or anything that you

760
00:51:43.411 --> 00:51:46.200
would recommend to them to,
uh,

761
00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:50.880
armed them away for defending against burnout later?

762
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:53.460
<v 3>Yes.
I,</v>

763
00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:59.380
I would recommend that they read the latest science around the importance of

764
00:51:59.931 --> 00:52:04.931
sleep and pauses in the course of our day because we claim to be data driven,

765
00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:06.590
eh,

766
00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:11.590
but in fact we're living our lives ignoring the data and the prep,

767
00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:16.420
the prevailing culture still believes that,
uh,

768
00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:21.380
um,
being always on is the way to succeed.

769
00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:23.600
Um,
that,
uh,

770
00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:27.320
cutting down on sleep means we are more productive because,

771
00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:29.450
because we have more time available.

772
00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:34.840
So I would show them the latest science and then I would bring together new role

773
00:52:36.021 --> 00:52:39.950
models,
people in the arena that they admire.

774
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:42.980
And if they admire business people,

775
00:52:42.981 --> 00:52:46.490
people like Jeff Bezos who wrote on thrive global,

776
00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:50.810
why he gets eight hours of sleep a night as he put it,

777
00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:56.390
it's good for Amazon shareholders because,
and he broke it down.

778
00:52:56.391 --> 00:52:58.130
He said,
when I get six hours,

779
00:52:58.131 --> 00:53:02.720
my decision making is five to 20% less good.

780
00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:08.530
Then when I've had eight hours and my value is entirely dependent on the quality

781
00:53:11.001 --> 00:53:12.140
of my decisions.

782
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:17.530
Now that's entirely based on science and not his personal observation of how he

783
00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:23.980
makes decisions or if people are more likely to be swayed by cultural icons.

784
00:53:27.331 --> 00:53:31.650
I would a quad Selena Gomez who wrote for us,

785
00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:36.980
why is she does a regular digital detox because as she put it,

786
00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:40.530
when she does a digital detox,

787
00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:45.860
she reconnects with herself and is much more present in everything she's doing

788
00:53:47.341 --> 00:53:48.210
in her life.

789
00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:53.470
<v 2>What does a digital detox look like for her or for anyone else who might want to</v>

790
00:53:53.471 --> 00:53:54.304
try it?

791
00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:58.460
<v 3>Well,
people can pick their own way of doing it,</v>

792
00:53:58.490 --> 00:54:03.350
but it's basically taking,
it could be anything from a day and we can.

793
00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:08.730
Um,
and now I away from our phones.
Um,

794
00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:13.550
Thich Nhat Hanh said it's never easier to run away from ourselves.

795
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:15.230
Um,

796
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:20.030
the human attention span is now shorter than the hue.

797
00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:24.080
Then the attention span of the Goldfish,
it's down to eight seconds.

798
00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:29.860
So anything we can do that,
um,
um,

799
00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:34.610
helps us disconnect from the distractions,
reconnect with ourselves,

800
00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:38.750
whatever form it takes.
I'm a big believer in micro steps.

801
00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:43.430
Like if the idea of a one day digital detox is overwhelming,

802
00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:48.080
just try it out,
try half an hour,
whatever.
Um,

803
00:54:48.110 --> 00:54:51.200
whatever your entry point is,
just take it.

804
00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:57.110
<v 2>So what out of mentioned a few maybe micro steps that I've found helpful for</v>

805
00:54:59.611 --> 00:55:00.031
myself,

806
00:55:00.031 --> 00:55:04.640
then I'd love to hear some of yours because I've noticed for myself at least at

807
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:09.530
that I always put my phone on airplane mode,
uh,

808
00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:14.610
after typically after dinner and it stays in airplane mode until I've meditated

809
00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:17.530
the next morning.
Uh,
that is what

810
00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:20.450
<v 3>one practice
and I've</v>

811
00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:23.970
<v 2>been doing that for probably two years now.
Uh,</v>

812
00:55:24.050 --> 00:55:28.520
because I've noticed that if,
if I do not have it on airplane mode,

813
00:55:28.521 --> 00:55:33.290
number one,
there will be lights and so on in my bedroom,
which is not ideal.

814
00:55:33.291 --> 00:55:35.360
And I,
I know that you have quite a bit to say on that.

815
00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:39.620
And I also find that if,

816
00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:44.750
if I am barraged by any type of inputs in the morning before doing my
meditation,

817
00:55:44.751 --> 00:55:48.970
the meditation is of a very,
very low quality.
And,
uh,

818
00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:53.810
the second thing that I do on a weekly basis is I try to take what I would call,

819
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:56.480
what I do call a screen free Saturdays.

820
00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:59.840
And it doesn't mean that I'm totally avoiding electronics because I will,

821
00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:04.930
I don't own a car currently and I'll use my phone for say Uber or Google maps

822
00:56:05.181 --> 00:56:06.014
and so on.

823
00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:10.940
But otherwise I'm not using a laptop and I'm not using social media of any type.

824
00:56:10.941 --> 00:56:15.890
So on Saturdays that is a weekly sort of Sabbath,

825
00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:18.530
uh,
away from a lot of the distractions.

826
00:56:18.531 --> 00:56:22.130
Are there any other micro steps that you might recommend to people or that you

827
00:56:22.131 --> 00:56:24.490
found personally?
That's fantastic

828
00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:29.230
<v 3>and I know how many people have been influenced by you doing that.</v>

829
00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:32.090
Um,
for me,
uh,

830
00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:37.240
another little micro step is not charging our phone by a bed.

831
00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:43.080
And the reason for that is that we are all slightly addicted to our phones and

832
00:56:43.601 --> 00:56:45.610
even with the best intentions,

833
00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:49.960
if we wake up in the middle of the night and we can't easily go back to sleep

834
00:56:49.961 --> 00:56:52.090
and our phone is right by her bed,

835
00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:57.600
we are going to be tempted to pick up the phone and um,

836
00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:01.190
and look at our tech.

837
00:57:01.191 --> 00:57:06.191
So look at Instagram and that will dramatically interfere who is the,

838
00:57:07.241 --> 00:57:12.010
our ability to go back to sleep and to recharge.
So,

839
00:57:12.011 --> 00:57:16.610
um,
that's one little micro step.
Um,

840
00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:20.080
and other micro step for me,
um,

841
00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:23.950
which is similar to yours is never rushing into my phone.

842
00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:28.660
Um,
at the beginning of the of the morning,

843
00:57:28.661 --> 00:57:32.410
the first thing I do but have my own ritual,

844
00:57:32.411 --> 00:57:37.300
which includes meditation,
um,
and which includes,

845
00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:41.890
uh,
setting my intention for the day before I get on my phone.

846
00:57:41.891 --> 00:57:45.400
And when I get on,
I love doing my stationary bike in the morning.

847
00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:50.850
I'm perfectly fine being on my phone and answering emails while on the bike.

848
00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:54.910
<v 2>What is a black sheep?</v>

849
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.390
I'm going to ask you about your morning routine and then I'm going to come back

850
00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:02.710
to why all of this became so important to you.

851
00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:07.720
But what is your morning look like?
Do you have any particular routines that,

852
00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:12.220
could you walk us through the first say 90 minutes of your day when you wake up

853
00:58:12.221 --> 00:58:13.720
and then what happens after that?

854
00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:19.270
<v 3>So,
um,
first of all,
I just wanted to say that the,
I,</v>

855
00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:21.930
I don believe,
uh,

856
00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:26.960
in having at the same time to go to sleep at night and the same time to wake up

857
00:58:28.011 --> 00:58:32.120
in the morning kind of my life doesn't work like that and I don't like setting

858
00:58:32.121 --> 00:58:35.330
up rules,
which I'm going to break every day.

859
00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:38.180
So I,

860
00:58:38.181 --> 00:58:43.181
my goal now is to wake up eight hours after I went to sleep.

861
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:48.750
And because I have found out that eight hours is what I need to operate on

862
00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:54.170
optimally.
And,
um,
also it happens to be,

863
00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:59.240
um,
quite a lot of people in need.
You know,

864
00:58:59.241 --> 00:59:03.050
the most scientists have told us that unless you have a genetic mutation and

865
00:59:03.051 --> 00:59:07.760
which case you can do great on three or four hours and about one and a half

866
00:59:07.761 --> 00:59:12.761
percent of the population has that the rest of us need seven to nine hours to,

867
00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:17.300
um,
to have a fully restorative sleep.

868
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:20.990
So that's kind of my,
my ground rule to myself.

869
00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:25.440
And 95% of the time I do it.
I,
I'm,

870
00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:30.560
I don't do anything perfectly and I'm a work in progress,

871
00:59:30.590 --> 00:59:33.620
but I think 95% is pretty good.

872
00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:36.460
<v 2>So you wake up eight hours,</v>

873
00:59:36.461 --> 00:59:40.890
let's say after you've gone to bed and then what happens after that?

874
00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:44.360
<v 3>And then I am,</v>

875
00:59:45.620 --> 00:59:50.620
the first thing I do is sort of meditate and said,

876
00:59:50.901 --> 00:59:55.490
and then after my meditation,
I said my denture for the day.

877
00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:57.980
Like,
what,
what,
uh,
what is,

878
00:59:58.010 --> 01:00:03.010
what do I want out of that day in terms of my work or my being or my family?

879
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:09.410
And the reason why I think it's so important is because I used to just go

880
01:00:09.411 --> 01:00:13.430
straight to my phone or my laptop.
And,
uh,

881
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.850
that's what the world wants of us,
right?

882
01:00:16.851 --> 01:00:20.210
It's every male and every text.
And,

883
01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:25.850
and I feel it's very important for us to be clear about what we want because you

884
01:00:25.851 --> 01:00:28.550
can't really run your life from your inbox.

885
01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:33.510
<v 2>No.
Well,
as a friend of mine who actually,</v>

886
01:00:35.730 --> 01:00:40.470
he put this to me and he learned it from someone else who's a billionaire who

887
01:00:40.471 --> 01:00:44.280
said to him,
you know,
that your inbox is everyone else's agenda for your time.

888
01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.393
I love that.

889
01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:51.630
And that's a very good way to think about it because it's extremely reactive.

890
01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:54.740
Uh,
and uh,

891
01:00:55.140 --> 01:01:00.140
you seem to have very proactive programming in a way.

892
01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:06.180
And,
uh,
you do seem to have certain routines or rituals.

893
01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:08.330
I'd love to talk about.
Uh,

894
01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:15.900
and this,
this will tie into a lot of what we're talking about walking.
Could you,

895
01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:21.070
because I've read in doing research for our conversation that one of your

896
01:01:22.471 --> 01:01:23.340
favorite phrases,

897
01:01:23.341 --> 01:01:26.650
and I'm going to mess this up because this looks like Latin is sold,

898
01:01:26.651 --> 01:01:31.230
the tour [inaudible] it,
which means it is solved by walking.

899
01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:36.350
Could you please talk about walking and what role it has in your life?

900
01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:42.830
<v 3>So,
um,
you know,
I lived in Los Angeles for many years.
I,
um,</v>

901
01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:47.860
my two daughters went to school there and then I lived in Brentwood and it's

902
01:01:49.281 --> 01:01:52.790
kind of amazing hikes everywhere.

903
01:01:52.791 --> 01:01:56.660
Literally five minutes in the car from my home.

904
01:01:56.661 --> 01:01:58.460
They're the most beautiful hikes,

905
01:01:58.461 --> 01:02:02.240
the Mandeville Canyon Chi hike and they cantor hike.

906
01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:07.900
And so I got into the habit of having all my meetings.

907
01:02:10.521 --> 01:02:13.240
I'm quote unquote lunches,

908
01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:15.670
etc. With friends during hikes.

909
01:02:15.671 --> 01:02:20.460
So instead of going for a lunch or a meeting with friends,

910
01:02:20.461 --> 01:02:24.270
we would go on a hike and a,
the one was in better shape.

911
01:02:24.271 --> 01:02:27.210
We'll talk on the way up and they,
one was in worse shape.

912
01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:30.780
We'll talk on the way down.
And um,

913
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:36.180
some of the best things happened on these hikes.
Um,

914
01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:41.280
I remember telling all my girlfriends about,
um,

915
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.380
my idea of launching the Huffington post and Laurie David,

916
01:02:46.381 --> 01:02:51.060
who at the time was married to Larry David immediately said,
I'll invest.

917
01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:55.980
In fact,
Laurie and Laurie invested together and then when they got divorced,

918
01:02:55.981 --> 01:02:57.200
they split the investment.

919
01:02:59.930 --> 01:03:04.290
And um,
and Kimberly Brooks became my first,
um,

920
01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.510
art editor.

921
01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:10.280
And it was just like a great way to just talk about everything,

922
01:03:10.281 --> 01:03:14.260
whether it was work or personal life.
Um,

923
01:03:14.890 --> 01:03:19.190
there was something about being in nature that made us all more willing to be

924
01:03:19.191 --> 01:03:23.210
authentic and vulnerable.
And I'm still,

925
01:03:23.211 --> 01:03:25.520
now when I get to La,
I,

926
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:31.630
I see my friends on hikes or walks around the block or whatever we have time

927
01:03:33.681 --> 01:03:37.010
for.
But I love it.
And of course now being in New York,

928
01:03:37.011 --> 01:03:40.460
it's fantastic because I can walk everywhere.

929
01:03:41.290 --> 01:03:44.980
<v 2>It's a great walking city.
New York is really a fantastic walking city.</v>

930
01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:48.700
And I've,
I've noticed a number of my,

931
01:03:49.210 --> 01:03:51.280
what I would consider most productive friends,

932
01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:55.930
which is saying a lot because a lot of productive friends,

933
01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:57.720
but for instance,
uh,

934
01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:02.760
naval Ravikant who's really a very soulful and intelligent person who's been on

935
01:04:05.291 --> 01:04:09.010
this podcast before,
uh,
does walk and talk meetings.

936
01:04:09.070 --> 01:04:12.070
So he'll have someone come and meet him.

937
01:04:12.071 --> 01:04:16.210
This isn't San Francisco and it might just be a walk around several blocks and

938
01:04:16.211 --> 01:04:20.040
doing a few laps of that route.
But,
uh,

939
01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.180
he will do walk and talk in that way.

940
01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:27.660
And I've also noticed that a few of my friends who I would also put in that top

941
01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:32.320
performing category,
they'll do walk and talks,
but they'll do it with video,

942
01:04:32.321 --> 01:04:36.220
facetime,
uh,
so that they can look at the other person as they're walking,

943
01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.280
which I thought was quite clever.
Uh,

944
01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:45.920
<v 3>well actually walking meetings is another great thing to do and we do a lot of</v>

945
01:04:45.921 --> 01:04:50.000
it here at thrive,
especially if it's one on one,

946
01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:55.030
it gets harder navigating the streets of New York if it's more than two people,

947
01:04:56.590 --> 01:04:59.480
but you can do it up to three and then it gets really hard.

948
01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:03.620
<v 2>What,
uh,
what,
if you don't mind,</v>

949
01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:08.150
and this will perhaps lead us into thrive,
but what were,

950
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:14.230
could you talk about one of the harder or darker periods during the,

951
01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:20.320
the,
the Huffington Post,
Huffington,
yours,
and what helped you to get out of it?

952
01:05:20.370 --> 01:05:21.203
Uh,

953
01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:25.660
and just walk us through maybe a story of one of those times because I think

954
01:05:25.661 --> 01:05:29.710
that it's very easy for people listening to this podcast to put the people being

955
01:05:29.711 --> 01:05:32.710
interviewed on a pedestal and assume they've always had everything figured out

956
01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:35.770
and they just step up to the plate and always hit home runs.

957
01:05:35.771 --> 01:05:40.771
But is there any particular tough period or time at Huffington Post that you

958
01:05:41.501 --> 01:05:46.501
could tell us about and what helped you to get through it or get out of it?

959
01:05:47.151 --> 01:05:47.984
Yeah.

960
01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:49.520
<v 3>Yes,
absolutely.</v>

961
01:05:49.521 --> 01:05:54.320
And I'm so glad you're focusing on that because the worst thing we can do is

962
01:05:54.321 --> 01:05:57.560
give people the delusion that,
uh,
um,

963
01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:02.390
everything has been plain sailing for me.

964
01:06:02.391 --> 01:06:07.391
The hardest time was that two years into building half-past when,

965
01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:12.590
um,
I was,
I'm literally working around the clock.

966
01:06:12.591 --> 01:06:17.591
I also had two daughters who at the time we're teenagers and,

967
01:06:19.161 --> 01:06:23.840
um,
that's probably the hardest time for a mother and her teenage daughters.

968
01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.220
And,
uh,

969
01:06:25.221 --> 01:06:30.221
I was divorced so I was bringing them up on my own and my oldest daughter was,

970
01:06:31.161 --> 01:06:32.720
um,
um,

971
01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:38.210
at the time when we did the college tours to decide what college she was going

972
01:06:38.211 --> 01:06:42.380
to go.
Um,
and basically what would happen,

973
01:06:42.381 --> 01:06:46.220
she had made that rule who just very legitimate,
no blackberries.

974
01:06:46.221 --> 01:06:50.210
It was blackberry time and when we're together.

975
01:06:50.211 --> 01:06:54.100
So she and I would be together going from college to college during the day and

976
01:06:54.101 --> 01:06:55.940
then at night to check into a hotel,

977
01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:58.550
she would go to sleep and I would start working.

978
01:06:59.090 --> 01:07:04.090
So I got back to Los Angeles and I was completely exhausted without even

979
01:07:06.951 --> 01:07:11.951
realizing I was completely exhausted and running on empty until I got up from my

980
01:07:12.021 --> 01:07:15.230
desk that first morning back.
Yeah.

981
01:07:15.231 --> 01:07:20.231
Because I was feeling called to get a sweater and I collapsed and he had my head

982
01:07:20.451 --> 01:07:25.400
on my desk,
broke my cheekbone,
that first teachers on my ride or die.

983
01:07:25.401 --> 01:07:30.401
And that was the beginning of the journey that led to the thrive book and the

984
01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:35.250
Sleep Revolution Book and the Thrive Company.
Um,

985
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:40.220
at the time it was a very dark time.
Um,

986
01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.230
because first of all,

987
01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:47.440
when something like that happens and nobody knows what's wrong with you,

988
01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:52.040
do you have a brain tumor?
Um,
do you have a hard problem?

989
01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:57.340
So does literally two weeks of going from doctor to doctor from Mri to

990
01:07:57.411 --> 01:08:01.310
electrocardiogram to check what was wrong with me.

991
01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:06.520
And at the end of this two weeks,
um,
I,
I feel it,

992
01:08:06.521 --> 01:08:11.521
this was a movie I would have had all the doctors in one room in the white

993
01:08:11.991 --> 01:08:16.550
coats,
basically give me the diagnosis is,
Ariana,

994
01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:19.790
you are suffering from civilization's disease,

995
01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:23.570
burnout and there's nothing we can do for you.

996
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:28.970
You have to change your life.
And um,

997
01:08:30.290 --> 01:08:35.290
and it really took that painful wake up call for me to realize that I had to

998
01:08:38.001 --> 01:08:41.900
change my life.
And that's why now I'm,

999
01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:48.580
I feel such an evangelist about this topic because I feel people can make

1000
01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:54.460
incremental changes in their lives before they hit the proverbial wall.

1001
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:59.870
And what is finally Tim,
is that if you had asked me that morning,

1002
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:01.610
Arianna,
how are you?

1003
01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:06.620
I would have said fine because I had forgotten what being fine really was.

1004
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:09.463
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1005
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:11.000
<v 3>You get it,
you know,</v>

1006
01:09:11.001 --> 01:09:16.001
being like perpetually tired had become the new normal and um,

1007
01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:21.900
and I had literally forgotten it so much so that,
uh,

1008
01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:26.940
I wasn't even aware of the fact that I was running on empty.

1009
01:09:28.890 --> 01:09:33.890
<v 2>So I'm really glad we're talking about this and I just want to reflect on one</v>

1010
01:09:35.031 --> 01:09:35.661
thing you said,

1011
01:09:35.661 --> 01:09:40.661
which is how you would've said you were fine because you'd forgotten what normal

1012
01:09:40.851 --> 01:09:42.670
actually was.
Uh,

1013
01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:47.980
I remember a few years ago I hit a point of,

1014
01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:53.960
of burnout,
complete burnout,
uh,
right after,
during,

1015
01:09:53.961 --> 01:09:57.980
and then right after the four hour chef for many reasons,

1016
01:09:57.981 --> 01:10:00.560
but I won't bore everybody with them right now.

1017
01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:05.380
And what I ended up doing after that as,

1018
01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:07.370
as part of my attempt to recover,

1019
01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:12.320
was agreeing to do my first meditation retreat of it was only two or three days.

1020
01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:14.000
And there were a number of rules.

1021
01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:18.050
Rule number one was you can't use an alarm clock and if you need to sleep and

1022
01:10:18.051 --> 01:10:20.060
that's all you do this weekend,
then that's what you do.

1023
01:10:20.150 --> 01:10:25.150
And I felt like that was going to be a huge waste because I knew I was tired,

1024
01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.080
but that was part one.

1025
01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:32.080
And part two was they recommended that everyone cut back on caffeine intake,

1026
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:38.330
which,
uh,
is my,
I suppose one of my,
uh,
compounds of choice.

1027
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:40.520
Fortunately,
I'm not drawn to opiates,

1028
01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:45.590
but a stimulants are,
uh,
unfortunately,

1029
01:10:45.670 --> 01:10:47.000
uh,
something that has,
have,

1030
01:10:47.001 --> 01:10:51.440
have often been right at my side and my body just seems to crave and respond to

1031
01:10:51.441 --> 01:10:52.730
that with a certain degree of addiction.

1032
01:10:52.731 --> 01:10:57.731
So I had been in my normal routine for months prior to that going to a Thai

1033
01:10:59.001 --> 01:11:03.800
restaurant that would let me sit down and work on my book and they would give me

1034
01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:07.130
the unending cup or glass of ice tea.

1035
01:11:07.131 --> 01:11:12.131
So it ended up drinking two or three gallons probably of ice tea and that,

1036
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:16.920
and that was my normal,
right.
So that's just what I assumed baseline felt like.

1037
01:11:16.921 --> 01:11:20.130
And then for the first time in probably six months,

1038
01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:25.020
I went completely off of caffeine in preparation for this retreat.
Uh,

1039
01:11:25.021 --> 01:11:29.190
proceeded to sleep almost the entire weekend and,
uh,
I felt rejuvenated.

1040
01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:33.900
No gadgets or devices.
Then I went back to,

1041
01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:38.700
in this case,
San Francisco where I used to live and what did I do?

1042
01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.150
I went back into my routine and I went to the Thai restaurant and then I

1043
01:11:42.151 --> 01:11:47.151
remember after maybe two or three glasses of ice tea and keeping in mind that

1044
01:11:49.621 --> 01:11:54.621
before that I was drinking 2030 not feeling anything that was just status quo

1045
01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:59.660
and I had maybe three glasses and I felt so agitated and so unpleasant that I

1046
01:12:00.931 --> 01:12:02.670
realized,
oh my God,

1047
01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:08.060
like this times 10 was what I assumed was normal just a week or two ago.

1048
01:12:08.850 --> 01:12:12.270
And it was just mind boggling.
I mean it was,

1049
01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:15.030
it was such a wake up call for me.
Uh,

1050
01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:18.390
but if I feel like I'm giving a confessional,
I just wanted to share that.

1051
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:23.510
But what were some of the first things that you did after you hit your head?

1052
01:12:25.890 --> 01:12:27.090
Saw these doctors,

1053
01:12:27.091 --> 01:12:31.110
they say you need to change your life in the say week that followed.

1054
01:12:31.111 --> 01:12:31.944
What did you do?

1055
01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:33.680
<v 3>Well,
first of all,</v>

1056
01:12:33.681 --> 01:12:38.681
I love your story because it's the same message that we,

1057
01:12:38.721 --> 01:12:40.490
we both want to impart,

1058
01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:45.520
which is how often we're not even aware of what we're doing to ourselves.

1059
01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:50.420
And that's why by listening to each other's stories,

1060
01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:54.740
we can and increase our own awareness.

1061
01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:58.160
So for me that,
that first of all,

1062
01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:03.580
this past two weeks who I spent going to doctors and asking questions,

1063
01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:09.230
um,
you know,
I've always been drawn to philosophy.

1064
01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:12.980
I always loved

1065
01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:18.800
reading the Greeks and the Romans and everyone in between.

1066
01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:24.140
And the,
the one question that really every philosopher asks is,

1067
01:13:24.141 --> 01:13:25.490
what is a good life?

1068
01:13:26.450 --> 01:13:31.450
And I feel that what we've done is you reduce the answer to that question too.

1069
01:13:32.150 --> 01:13:34.460
What is,
um,
what is success?

1070
01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:38.420
And it will reduce the good life to a successful life.

1071
01:13:38.421 --> 01:13:43.421
And we reduced success down to money and power slash status.

1072
01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:49.310
So if kind of shrunk and the definition of a good life.
And,

1073
01:13:49.311 --> 01:13:50.144
um,

1074
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:55.630
and I found that during that time I went back to books I loved and had read

1075
01:13:55.881 --> 01:13:59.840
before.
So it's not as if there's just like a new journey for me.

1076
01:13:59.841 --> 01:14:04.310
I'd always been drawn
to that question,

1077
01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:09.580
but this was something that had a new urgency and I knew,

1078
01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:10.570
um,

1079
01:14:10.570 --> 01:14:15.570
determination to actually live differently and not just read great books.

1080
01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:22.690
<v 2>And were there any particular changes?
You,</v>

1081
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:26.080
were there any particular books you remember,
uh,

1082
01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:30.940
having a renewed impact on you and then were there any particular steps that you

1083
01:14:30.941 --> 01:14:31.774
took after that?

1084
01:14:32.670 --> 01:14:36.720
<v 3>Yes,
actually,
a book that I read that I had not read before,</v>

1085
01:14:37.210 --> 01:14:38.043
um,

1086
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:42.450
which was recommended by a friend was incredibly

1087
01:14:44.010 --> 01:14:49.010
powerful for me because it was written by a man who was in the arena and yet

1088
01:14:50.101 --> 01:14:54.690
lived life the way I wanted to live my life.

1089
01:14:54.691 --> 01:14:59.210
And that was mark was a realia
meditations.

1090
01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:01.100
Meditations.
Exactly.

1091
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:05.940
So he was the ambassador of row and that is a pretty big job.

1092
01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:12.990
He,
um,
he had faced,
um,

1093
01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:18.030
invasions and plagues and betray Alison,
an unfaithful wife.

1094
01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:23.720
And yet he was able to be imperturbable.

1095
01:15:23.730 --> 01:15:26.320
That was my favorite word at the time.
And,

1096
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:31.710
and be very connected to that centered place in himself from which he wrote this

1097
01:15:31.711 --> 01:15:35.350
amazing book called Meditations.
And,
um,

1098
01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:38.190
I love that because,
you know,

1099
01:15:38.191 --> 01:15:43.191
it's easy to read books by Buddhist monks and,

1100
01:15:43.661 --> 01:15:47.970
uh,
Miss Jan mistakes and,
and you want,

1101
01:15:47.971 --> 01:15:50.970
I wanted to hear from somebody who was in the arena,

1102
01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:51.911
<v 2>right?</v>

1103
01:15:51.911 --> 01:15:55.780
Someone who's on the front lines actually having to deal with the difficulties

1104
01:15:55.781 --> 01:15:57.460
and messiness of the real world.

1105
01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:00.140
<v 3>Yes.
And,
and,
uh,
I don't,</v>

1106
01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:05.240
I'm not suggesting that my life was anything like mark was a realtor says life.

1107
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:09.950
But nevertheless,
I was in the arena.
I,
I,

1108
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:14.980
I had to deal with the daily challenges of life and work and,

1109
01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:18.860
and,
uh,
there was one quote in fact,

1110
01:16:18.861 --> 01:16:23.861
which I have laminated and carry with me that I love so much in the book and it

1111
01:16:24.651 --> 01:16:29.570
goes as follows.
People look for it treats for themselves in the country,

1112
01:16:29.571 --> 01:16:31.640
by the coast or in the hills.

1113
01:16:32.090 --> 01:16:37.090
There is no way that a person can find a more peaceful and trouble free retreat

1114
01:16:37.551 --> 01:16:38.810
and in his own mind.

1115
01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:43.790
So constantly give yourself this retreat and renew yourself.

1116
01:16:44.490 --> 01:16:49.290
<v 2>That is a great quote.
That is a really,
really,
really great quote.
I don't think,</v>

1117
01:16:49.291 --> 01:16:50.880
I'm amazed we haven't talked about this.

1118
01:16:52.710 --> 01:16:54.610
There were only talking about Marcus really,

1119
01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:56.940
and I'm not going to go off on a crazy stoic

1120
01:16:59.870 --> 01:17:00.703
<v 3>sidetracked.</v>

1121
01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:06.820
<v 2>Oh,</v>

1122
01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:11.820
I also have a quote from meditations and I tend to be a Seneca guy,

1123
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:20.410
which is,
is controversial,
but he's a beautiful writer and,

1124
01:17:20.411 --> 01:17:22.880
and people very often when they are,

1125
01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:28.130
if they get bitten by the bug of stoic philosophy,
tend to go say to Marcus,

1126
01:17:28.131 --> 01:17:32.480
really a spore.
Seneca,
ah,
often liked both.
And then there's a,

1127
01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:36.440
I'd say maybe 10% who love epic,
tedious for any number of reasons,

1128
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:39.430
but there's,
there's this quote from an I,

1129
01:17:39.431 --> 01:17:42.500
I don't recall it exactly because it's actually on my refrigerator and I'm not

1130
01:17:42.501 --> 01:17:43.334
near my refrigerator.

1131
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:48.920
But in effect it says when you are taken away from the harmony,

1132
01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:54.480
you to do what you can to return to it as easily as possible or as effortlessly

1133
01:17:55.461 --> 01:18:00.260
as possible.
And it is,
it's to,
was a reminder to me that it's,

1134
01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:03.950
it's not so much the goal to never be off balance.

1135
01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.450
It's to regain your balance.

1136
01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:09.050
<v 3>Oh,
I love that.
I couldn't agree more.
In fact,</v>

1137
01:18:09.051 --> 01:18:12.770
it is impossible to always be in that centered place.

1138
01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:18.620
There's no human being on earth that I have ever met.
Um,

1139
01:18:18.650 --> 01:18:20.120
maybe there's some enlightened,

1140
01:18:20.121 --> 01:18:24.770
sane somewhere who can be in that centered place all the time.

1141
01:18:24.771 --> 01:18:29.180
So you're absolutely right.
It's all about how quickly can we course correct.

1142
01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:34.990
<v 2>Now you mentioned the arena and you have certainly been in the arena in many</v>

1143
01:18:34.991 --> 01:18:38.920
different ways,
uh,
in,
in the,
in your lifetime.

1144
01:18:38.921 --> 01:18:42.160
So far in a no doubt you will continue to be in the arena because I think you

1145
01:18:42.190 --> 01:18:45.370
enjoy the full contact sport of it.
Uh,

1146
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:50.530
I wanted to ask you a question about hiring at thrive and uh,

1147
01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:51.460
this,

1148
01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:56.020
what I'm about to read comes from a piece in ink magazine and I'd just love to

1149
01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:00.580
hear you either fact check it and just correct it or elaborate on it.

1150
01:19:00.581 --> 01:19:04.770
Because of course,
quotes are not always accurate on the Internet,
but,
uh,

1151
01:19:04.930 --> 01:19:08.020
sometimes they are.
So what it says is now during interviews,

1152
01:19:08.650 --> 01:19:12.630
there's a speech I give to everybody and this is quoting you.
And the,

1153
01:19:12.631 --> 01:19:16.900
the speech is something like this,
uh,
for potential new hires.

1154
01:19:17.290 --> 01:19:20.500
I give you full permission to walk into my office and scream at me.

1155
01:19:20.501 --> 01:19:22.840
But I want you to consider this as my last warning.

1156
01:19:22.930 --> 01:19:26.720
If you complain about any of your colleagues behind their backs,
uh,

1157
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:28.810
would be let go.
It does make,

1158
01:19:28.811 --> 01:19:31.660
and then you go on to comment on how it makes a difference.

1159
01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:33.460
When you tell people this,

1160
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:39.280
I had never known this,
but can you,
can you tell us more about,

1161
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:40.743
uh,

1162
01:19:40.930 --> 01:19:45.370
whether this is accurate and then what the speech is and why you give it.

1163
01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:47.990
<v 3>So,
um,</v>

1164
01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:54.060
I really believe that we are moving away from what is seen as traditional HR

1165
01:19:56.020 --> 01:20:00.070
practice,
which is you go and complain to HR about a colleague.

1166
01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.190
Hr goes to the colleague and says,

1167
01:20:03.191 --> 01:20:08.070
somebody's not naming who complained about them.
And,

1168
01:20:08.071 --> 01:20:08.730
uh,

1169
01:20:08.730 --> 01:20:13.730
and it becomes this like the kind of game shrouded in secrecy that creates a

1170
01:20:16.501 --> 01:20:18.330
very toxic environment.

1171
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:23.750
And I believe where HR is moving to now and suddenly this is what we both

1172
01:20:24.661 --> 01:20:26.920
practice and teach in a,

1173
01:20:26.930 --> 01:20:31.930
in the work we're doing with corporations is a authentic transparency.

1174
01:20:32.970 --> 01:20:34.170
And,
um,

1175
01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:39.600
I believe that people who trust themselves

1176
01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:46.710
and trust each other are willing to have difficult conversations.

1177
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:49.470
You know,
relationships are not easy.

1178
01:20:49.471 --> 01:20:53.970
Whether their work relationships or personal relationships or may upset each

1179
01:20:53.971 --> 01:20:58.140
other.
We may say something the other person takes the wrong way.

1180
01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:00.810
Who may do something that upset someone.

1181
01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:06.170
I give everybody complete permission started with me to come and tell me

1182
01:21:06.601 --> 01:21:10.680
directly that I did something that didn't,
like I said some they didn't like.

1183
01:21:10.681 --> 01:21:11.780
And when I say scream,

1184
01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:16.140
I want to make the point that say it in as Roy away as you want.

1185
01:21:16.170 --> 01:21:20.790
You don't have to figure it out.
How to say do you don't have to.

1186
01:21:20.791 --> 01:21:22.880
You can say it while you are angry,
don't have,

1187
01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:25.230
you don't have to wait to calm down,
whatever.

1188
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:28.770
But if you are incapable of doing that,

1189
01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:32.160
if you are only capable of passive aggressive behavior,

1190
01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:35.700
which is always being nice,
um,

1191
01:21:35.730 --> 01:21:40.560
do your managers or do your colleagues while bad mouthing them behind their

1192
01:21:40.561 --> 01:21:44.250
backs?
Consider this your last warning.

1193
01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:48.840
I mean if we say that as clearly as we have said it and not adjust I,

1194
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:53.220
but everybody here,
but you are,
but you can't do it,

1195
01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.500
then this is not the right place for you.

1196
01:21:56.790 --> 01:22:01.280
<v 2>I love that.
I wish more people did this.
Uh,
because I feel like,
and a,</v>

1197
01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:04.800
I don't want to,
I'm trying to hold myself back.
I've had too much caffeine maybe,

1198
01:22:04.810 --> 01:22:05.643
but,
uh,

1199
01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:11.240
I feel like the handling of everyone with kid gloves and the sort of

1200
01:22:11.851 --> 01:22:16.851
infantilizing of the workplace is in the short term the avoidance of pain,

1201
01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:23.780
but guaranteed to create much larger problems and much greater pain in the

1202
01:22:23.911 --> 01:22:27.120
longterm.
So this approach I think is just so refreshing.

1203
01:22:27.690 --> 01:22:31.490
And my question is how do you,
uh,

1204
01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:36.360
when you are hiring people,
and many of those hires I would imagine are younger,

1205
01:22:36.361 --> 01:22:37.470
perhaps they've been,

1206
01:22:37.650 --> 01:22:41.070
they've only known the environment where you would go to HR and report.

1207
01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:41.993
They're not true.

1208
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.480
They're not accustomed to having uncomfortable conversations with coworkers

1209
01:22:45.481 --> 01:22:48.060
where they tried to address things directly.
Do you,

1210
01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:52.320
do you try to in any way coach them or provide them with guidelines,

1211
01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:55.890
uh,
for how to have those conversations?

1212
01:22:56.610 --> 01:22:59.580
<v 3>Oh yes,
absolutely.
In fact,
actually team,
it's interesting.</v>

1213
01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:03.690
We hire a lot of people straight out of college and that's great.

1214
01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:07.880
It's so easy to tell them that and they get it.
And they practice it.

1215
01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:12.200
It's people who come to us from other companies,
um,

1216
01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:15.820
that need more coaching.
And,
um,

1217
01:23:16.570 --> 01:23:21.570
and I think we are able to do it by often having difficult conversations at our

1218
01:23:22.451 --> 01:23:23.890
leadership meetings.

1219
01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:28.210
I'm repeating that in our team meetings,

1220
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:31.480
m ever repeating that again and again.

1221
01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:34.600
And that we encourage people to have difficult conversations.

1222
01:23:34.601 --> 01:23:39.601
We encourage people to communicate when they are not happy with something.

1223
01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:42.640
I always prioritize that people know,

1224
01:23:42.641 --> 01:23:46.510
if anybody texts me or emails me and says,
I have a problem.

1225
01:23:46.511 --> 01:23:50.770
Something has happened,
I want to talk to you.
I drop everything to address it.

1226
01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:55.350
So people know there's always a follow,
um,

1227
01:23:56.290 --> 01:23:59.710
including with me who are,
they can address problems.

1228
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:02.260
And so I think we've,
um,

1229
01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:05.440
we've really created that,

1230
01:24:05.530 --> 01:24:08.410
that atmosphere and that space here.

1231
01:24:08.411 --> 01:24:11.560
And we also make it part of hiring.
So,

1232
01:24:11.710 --> 01:24:16.710
which helps hire people who are more comfortable having difficult conversations.

1233
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:22.250
<v 2>Now your,
your sister,
who else</v>

1234
01:24:25.170 --> 01:24:29.280
has said that you are like Athena?
I believe.
Uh,

1235
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.430
but,
uh,
on the flip side,

1236
01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:36.480
I've also read that your favorite Greek God is now,
I don't know if it's,

1237
01:24:36.510 --> 01:24:39.030
if you'd pronounce it Hermes or Air Maze,

1238
01:24:39.930 --> 01:24:43.650
is unless you want to refer to the scarves,
the scarves,
right?
It,

1239
01:24:43.651 --> 01:24:47.190
which confuses me as a long island boy with no culture.
So,
alright.
Hermes.

1240
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:50.880
So why does she think that you're like Athena?
And why is your favorite Greek?

1241
01:24:50.881 --> 01:24:51.714
God Hermes?

1242
01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:57.340
<v 3>Well,
first of all,
you know,
wrote a book on Greek gods and goddesses and,
um,</v>

1243
01:24:57.350 --> 01:25:01.200
the where I approached them as archetypes and,
um,

1244
01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:05.210
and I believe that we all carry all the gods and goddesses.

1245
01:25:05.211 --> 01:25:07.230
Inas um,

1246
01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:12.120
so the question is who is the most dominant God?
So I think that is,

1247
01:25:12.121 --> 01:25:15.860
um,
the goddess of wisdom.
And I'm,

1248
01:25:15.870 --> 01:25:19.830
I'm very Florida that my sister thinks that's my dominant goddess,

1249
01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:24.860
but I aspire to ham is being my dominant God because he's like my favorite God

1250
01:25:27.751 --> 01:25:32.460
of Greek mythology.
Um,
because he saw multifaceted.

1251
01:25:32.490 --> 01:25:36.750
He's both childlike and wise.
He's,

1252
01:25:36.751 --> 01:25:41.751
I'm a mystic and comfortable in the market place.

1253
01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:44.460
Um,
and,
uh,

1254
01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:50.240
he represents everything I love about our humanity in his very godlike way.

1255
01:25:54.690 --> 01:25:57.450
So he is my favorite.

1256
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:01.600
<v 2>And,
uh,
ab do you,</v>

1257
01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:05.510
you really have had struck me in all of our interactions and as I've observed

1258
01:26:05.511 --> 01:26:10.040
you as someone who's really made a conscious effort,

1259
01:26:10.041 --> 01:26:14.270
as you said,
to be honest with yourself and,
uh,

1260
01:26:15.230 --> 01:26:17.360
to see reality as it is.
But there's,

1261
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:21.170
there's one anecdote which I think falls into this category.

1262
01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:25.500
It's kind of related.
I think that,
uh,
I've never heard from you.
So again,
I,

1263
01:26:25.501 --> 01:26:28.100
I read a lot on the Internet and I have to be careful sometimes with that,

1264
01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:33.430
but did you have a conversation with Henry Kissinger about your accent at one

1265
01:26:33.891 --> 01:26:38.870
point and a,
and if so,
can you please tell the story

1266
01:26:39.550 --> 01:26:41.440
<v 3>so you're not my,
um,</v>

1267
01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:46.890
I've been very conscious of my accent for a long time and I am,

1268
01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:50.610
I did try to change it.
In fact,
um,

1269
01:26:51.130 --> 01:26:56.130
my ex husband gave me as a birthday gift,

1270
01:26:56.350 --> 01:26:59.920
which you may consider a very passive aggressive birthday gift,

1271
01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:06.240
a dialect coach for two weeks to follow me around and give me notes.

1272
01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:12.820
And it wasn't just any dialect coach.
She does Jessica Drake,

1273
01:27:13.330 --> 01:27:18.330
who is a very famous Hollywood dialect coach who coached forest Gump,

1274
01:27:23.890 --> 01:27:27.750
coach Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump.
And anyway,

1275
01:27:27.751 --> 01:27:31.810
so she literally followed me around at the time my children were young,

1276
01:27:31.811 --> 01:27:35.290
she would put this symbols on Dr Seuss books.

1277
01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:37.570
So when I was reading to my children,

1278
01:27:37.571 --> 01:27:42.140
I could practice and she would pull the lifesavers and my tongue,

1279
01:27:42.141 --> 01:27:46.810
so would pronounce my long like long these and my short,

1280
01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:51.430
it's like shards.
And by the end of it,
I was paralyzed.

1281
01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:55.270
I knew exactly what I was doing wrong,

1282
01:27:55.271 --> 01:27:59.410
but I could not really be inauthentic,

1283
01:28:00.430 --> 01:28:03.550
functioning,
human being and speak proper English.

1284
01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:09.550
So I gave up ever reluctant Lee,

1285
01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:14.770
um,
the harp of having pro speaking the Queen's English.

1286
01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:19.270
And soon after I gave up my husband though they do things aren't,

1287
01:28:19.271 --> 01:28:22.170
we're not related.
Um,

1288
01:28:22.570 --> 01:28:27.570
and then around that time I was talking to Henry Kissinger and I told him,

1289
01:28:28.151 --> 01:28:28.984
you know,

1290
01:28:29.050 --> 01:28:33.040
you're so comfortable with your accent and I've been so uncomfortable with it.

1291
01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:37.000
And he said,
Arianna,
give it up.
Uh,
in American public life,

1292
01:28:37.001 --> 01:28:41.020
you can never overestimate the advantages of complete and total

1293
01:28:41.021 --> 01:28:42.060
incomprehensibility.

1294
01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:47.170
<v 2>Okay.
So you,</v>

1295
01:28:47.171 --> 01:28:50.800
you learned to embrace it.
Was it,
was it easy?
I mean,
after that conversation,

1296
01:28:50.801 --> 01:28:51.960
was it easy or what was the,

1297
01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:54.810
<v 3>I think it was a combination of,
um,</v>

1298
01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:58.230
seeing how I could never speak.

1299
01:28:58.231 --> 01:29:03.060
Like Jessica Drake wanted me to speak unless I kind of measured every word and

1300
01:29:03.061 --> 01:29:06.600
lost all spontaneity.
And,
uh,

1301
01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:11.620
also the fact that Hendrick issues seem so completely comfortable with his heavy

1302
01:29:11.701 --> 01:29:15.330
German accent.
And now honestly,
I don't think about it,

1303
01:29:15.331 --> 01:29:18.930
but for a long time it really weighed on me.

1304
01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:24.440
<v 2>Well,
you know,
I wanted to hear you tell that story,
which I,</v>

1305
01:29:24.441 --> 01:29:26.870
I really only knew a tiny piece of it,

1306
01:29:26.871 --> 01:29:31.130
so I'm glad you told the full story and uh,

1307
01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:34.250
because I think you were very,

1308
01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:40.360
you live life very proactively and it's been inspiring to watch in our

1309
01:29:41.991 --> 01:29:46.280
interactions and also as I see you,
uh,

1310
01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:49.880
converse and interact and help other people.

1311
01:29:50.570 --> 01:29:55.570
So I really encourage people obviously to check out thrive global and uh,

1312
01:29:56.210 --> 01:29:56.421
I'll,

1313
01:29:56.421 --> 01:30:00.230
I'll mention in a second where they can find you on various social platforms.

1314
01:30:00.231 --> 01:30:02.540
But first and foremost,
I just wanted to thank you for,

1315
01:30:02.900 --> 01:30:07.900
for taking the time because this has been so fun and I'm sure we only

1316
01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:12.830
found the very tip of the iceberg in terms of the stories that you can tell.

1317
01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:17.030
Uh,
so maybe we'll do around two sometime,
but I,

1318
01:30:17.031 --> 01:30:20.300
I really appreciate you making the time to have the conversation.

1319
01:30:21.310 --> 01:30:25.270
<v 3>Oh,
team.
I absolutely loved it.
Loved it.
And um,</v>

1320
01:30:25.690 --> 01:30:30.580
I would love to invite your listeners to tell their own stories.

1321
01:30:30.581 --> 01:30:32.470

1325
01:30:50.501 --> 01:30:51.940
science and data.

1326
01:30:51.941 --> 01:30:56.941

and a half hours and he had his inbox explode to the point that it became very

difficult to manage.

1360
01:32:58.561 --> 01:33:01.740
Just a few more things before you take off.
Number one,

1361
01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:06.870
this is five bullet Friday.
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1362

Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday?

1363
01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:14.100
That provides a little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet

1364
01:33:14.101 --> 01:33:18.720
Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that

1365
01:33:18.721 --> 01:33:20.280
I've been pondering over the week.

1366
01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:23.280
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1367
01:33:23.281 --> 01:33:26.730
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1368
01:33:26.731 --> 01:33:31.050
somehow dug up in the other world of the esoteric as I do.

1369
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:36.350
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

1370
01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:39.720
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

1371
01:33:39.810 --> 01:33:44.790
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

They didn't ask me to read this part by the way.

1411
01:36:03.770 --> 01:36:08.360
They'd put the other pdf awhile back called breaking the time barrier.
