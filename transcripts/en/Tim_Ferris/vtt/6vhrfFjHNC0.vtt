Hello boys and girls McGuane gremlins.
This is Tim Ferriss.

2
00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:05.100
Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

3
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:10.020
If you're looking for perhaps some type of high brow intellectual long form

4
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:10.980
conversation,

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.490
you might want to go to tim.blog/podcast for one of my other long form

6
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:21.480
interviews.
Don't sell us short dude,
come on.
Hold on.

7
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.800
Kevin,
I haven't introduced yet,

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.680
but for those of you who enjoy the,

9
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.650
the random helter skelter,
is that a right word?
Yeah,
I think it is nature.

10
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.740
Well,
I'm going to run with it of the random show,

11
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.170
which we haven't had an episode of for a very,

12
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:41.130
very long time and does a conversation between yours truly and my good friend,

13
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.350
uh,
Kevin Rose number one on the Tim Ferriss show.
That's true.

14
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.650
You were guest number one,
the very first episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

15
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.020
And actually it's in my linkedin bio now.
That's my claim to fame.

16
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.950
It's in your Google plus bio and we have not done random show for a long time,

17
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:06.801
but I'll let you do if you want to do an introduction of the random show we need

18
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.760
to.
And even know what episode we're on.

19
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:11.400
Like for those that view they have heard the random,
she'll be four.

20
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:15.750
I think we've done probably if I had to guess I'd say maybe 25 episodes,

21
00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:17.940
something like that.
25 to seven episodes.

22
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.740
So episode 27 let's call it episode 27 and Kevin,

23
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:24.900
for people who don't know you,
what's your story?

24
00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:27.120
What would you like people to know about you?
What's the biggest question?

25
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.040
The speaker bio version of Kevin Rose?
I don't even know these days.
Uh,

26
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.480
no seriously.
Um,

27
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.460
I would say that I've been a longtime Internet entrepreneur.
Um,

28
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.670
I probably am best known for creating these social news website.

29
00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:43.840
Dig Back in 2004,
um,

30
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.960
that grew to become a pretty big entity,
um,
for a number of years.

31
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.990
And then I was at Google as an investor and now I'm at true ventures as an

32
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:55.530
investor.
Tim,

33
00:01:55.531 --> 00:01:59.550
you and I probably co-invested in maybe a dozen or so angel deals.
Yeah,

34
00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:04.170
at least Facebook together,
I think Twitter together,
Twitter together,

35
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:08.160
blue bottle coffee together,
a bunch of them.
Side Note.

36
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:13.161
You remember how ridiculed we all were when the consortium of techies and

37
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:16.500
non-techies invested in blue bottle coffee.

38
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:19.950
Do you remember how much shit we got on the Internet for that?
Absolutely.

39
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:23.700
They're like,
why would blue bottle need to raise money and,
but it's done.
Okay.

40
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.820
It had,
it had a great exit here just about a month ago.
It has done all right.

41
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.960
It was a what was a majority stake acquisition by Nestle for 700 million or so.

42
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.100
So it worked out.
Yeah,
it worked out.
So you've done very well as an investor,

43
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.690
you are obsessed with many things Japanese.
Yeah.

44
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.990
Who you have a new obsession,
it seems every few weeks.

45
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.330
And uh,
do you have anything new to add?
Actually,
you know what,

46
00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:48.370
I want that stuff.

47
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.010
I want to hear about the fast mimicking diet because this is something I thought

48
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.450
I would have put money on.

49
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:58.320
You never sticking with the fast moving diet and maybe you can explain for

50
00:02:58.321 --> 00:02:59.154
people what that,

51
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.940
but you've actually now done a number of scheduled five day.

52
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.620
Yeah,
that's great.
That's fine.
FMD.
So I'll,

53
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.770
I'll start back by saying that probably the reason why,
Tim,

54
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:14.940
you and I are friends.
I met you when you were launching your first book,
um,

55
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.890
on your boat party that you did.
You rented out a warship,

56
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.480
the San Francisco Bay and the ss Jeremiah where they recorded a lot of the

57
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.300
boiler room audio for the James Cameron movie titanic.

58
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.470
Oh,
crazy.
In fact,
that's awesome.
But um,
yeah,

59
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.040
we hit it off because we both love all kinds of,

60
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.850
of this idea of lifelong learning I think has been a theme that you and I both

61
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:42.040
enjoy.
And um,
you know,

62
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:46.390
I've certainly got really into biohacking in the last couple of years.

63
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.680
I've watched from afar.
Um,

64
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.700
you poke and prod yourself and squirt all kinds of different juices out of your

65
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:55.840
elbow.
You know,

66
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.470
this requires a little bit of explanation.
So this is so gross.
All right.

67
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.220
But now I have to explain it.
So I had a botched PRP injection,

68
00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:09.040
which is platelet rich plasma injection in my right elbow.

69
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.520
And people can look up PRP.
It actually has some fantastic applications,

70
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:17.521
but there was a botched injection which pushed effectively subcutaneous bacteria

71
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:20.110
into the elbow capsule itself.

72
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:24.820
And it turned into this horrible infection that required a bright moment and

73
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.590
surgery and so on.
But Kevin being the good friend that he is,

74
00:04:29.591 --> 00:04:34.090
came to visit me in the Er when I was having the,

75
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.610
uh,
I'm not sure if you'd call it synovial fluid,

76
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:39.520
the infection flu is the pos drained out of your ass,

77
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.440
drained out of my elbow with this gigantic syringe and uh,

78
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.890
being the mature adult that I am,

79
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.920
I thought it'd be funny to take this Turkey based or worth of elbow fluid out of

80
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.183
the,

81
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.810
the sharps container and squirt it at Kevin who is in the room.

82
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.730
I'm not proud of it,
but I don't regret it either.
So yes,
you've seen me do a lot,

83
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.061
uh,

84
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:08.890
and make a lot of short term decisions that haven't turned out very well in the

85
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:11.800
world of biohacking.
It's always entertaining though.

86
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.720
Got To say I had a lot of fun doing stupid shit together.
Um,
but yeah,

87
00:05:16.721 --> 00:05:20.560
speaking of,
of,
well probably not that dumb these days,
but,
uh,
fasting.

88
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.050
So I got into fascinating,
um,
here probably about three years ago,

89
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:29.920
two to three years ago,
um,
I started fasting at zero,
which is a,
a free,

90
00:05:29.921 --> 00:05:33.330
fascinating tracker.
Um,
and so that,
uh,

91
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.900
has really kind of blown up and taken off.
Um,
but then I started hearing about,

92
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.550
um,
the research from Delta Doctor Valter Longo.
And so,

93
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.090
um,
we actually was from a friend of mine,
uh,
you know,

94
00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:49.630
Mike Mays or a mutual friend of ours and Mike was diagnosed with stage four

95
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:50.750
cancer.
Um,

96
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.690
he went into chemotherapy treatment and he was one of the guys that said,

97
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:58.790
I'm just not going to,
you know,
um,
just take what they gave me,

98
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:01.310
but I'm going to go out and do my own research and see what else I can be doing

99
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:04.130
to help fight this in,
beat this down.

100
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.570
And one of the things that came up was this idea of doing these five day FMDs

101
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:11.720
and the FMD stands for fasting,
the medic diet.

102
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.810
And the idea is that,
um,

103
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.930
compliance of doing a standard five day fast is relatively low because it's,

104
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.390
it's an extremely difficult thing to do.
Um,
uh,
Tim,

105
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:26.540
have you ever done a five day water?
Only fast.
Have you tried?
Yeah,

106
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:29.900
I've done five,
seven and 10 day.
Okay.

107
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.670
So I've done a five day water only and I will tell you,
it is absolutely brutal.

108
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.110
I don't know what your experience was,

109
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.520
but like I had a really difficult time sleeping.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's a,

110
00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:45.290
I believe it's a coal energic effect that leads you to have rapid heartbeat

111
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.560
quite often.
Yes.
When you were trying to sleep,
it's not pleasant.

112
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.280
So you'll be arrested and you'll lay down in bed and you're,

113
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:56.330
you'll feel like you just ran a hundred meter sprint.
Uh,
in terms of heartbeat,

114
00:06:56.331 --> 00:07:00.650
it's very unpleasant.
It's kind of scary you like,
and,
and I get those.

115
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.640
I'm also one of those people that,
um,
get those,
uh,

116
00:07:03.641 --> 00:07:06.570
I get this little war early heartbeats,
you know,
where you'd like feel like your,

117
00:07:06.571 --> 00:07:09.950
your heart,
like kind of skip a beat a little bit.
They're completely benign.

118
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:12.110
And I've had it looked at and everything's fine,

119
00:07:12.111 --> 00:07:13.520
but I get those every once in a while.

120
00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:17.090
And those are those come more frequently when I'm in a fasted state.

121
00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:21.450
So long story short,
Mike does his five day fast.
Um,

122
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.210
he beats back cancer.
He's in full remission,
which is awesome.
Um,

123
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.390
but the idea with the,
the five day fast is that I interrupt you one more time.

124
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.230
The S and I think this,
I don't think Mike would mind this,

125
00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:35.900
but I remember you and I when we were talking about this and he,

126
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.110
did he do five or three?
I can't recall.
Sorry.
You're right.
He did three.

127
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:42.110
She did three.
But just,
just for those who are curious.

128
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.950
So I've had conversations with Dominic D'Agostino before on this podcast,

129
00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:47.630
very well published researcher.

130
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.320
And I was first introduced to the possibility that fasting prior to

131
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:56.410
chemotherapy,
uh,

132
00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.650
I believe and radiation could be either a,

133
00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:05.651
has the potential to increase the resilience of normal cells while increasing

134
00:08:06.531 --> 00:08:11.531
the susceptibility or weakness of cancer cells to facilitate this type of

135
00:08:12.321 --> 00:08:13.070
treatment,

136
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.420
but also to decrease the side effects that are commonly experienced.

137
00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:18.201
And so Mike,

138
00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:23.201
to my understanding would do say a three day fast before a session and while the

139
00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:26.210
other people in his cohort were laid out on the,

140
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.380
on the couch or in bed the next day,
he'd be running a 10 mile training run,

141
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.120
which is just insane.
Which is nuts.
Yeah.
And,
and so he originally,

142
00:08:35.121 --> 00:08:38.910
and when he got turned on to this,
um,
research by Doctor Longo is,
um,

143
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.100
he showed me this youtube video where they were giving rats chemotherapy and the

144
00:08:43.101 --> 00:08:46.130
one,
the rats that were fast,
they were just like running around the cage.

145
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:49.520
It looked like normal healthy rats and the ones that didn't fast where just like

146
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:52.700
you said,
like on their side,
all beat up and in a horrible state.

147
00:08:52.701 --> 00:08:55.290
And that's exactly what Mike experienced.
And Yeah,

148
00:08:55.291 --> 00:09:00.291
the idea is that I'm on the making the chemotherapy more effective is that,

149
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:05.640
you know,
you're depriving yourselves of the cancer cells have some nutrients,

150
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.860
certainly sugar,
less glucose,

151
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.400
and it makes them more susceptible to the chemotherapy treatments and the chemo

152
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.220
therapy is that much more effective.
So,
you know,

153
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.460
obviously we can't say for certain whether that's what put them into remission,

154
00:09:17.461 --> 00:09:21.030
but he's really happy that it did work and he is in remission and the evidence

155
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:24.040
looks pretty compelling,
um,
in humans.
Um,

156
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:28.290
and so they're also a extending this whole protocol to healthy individuals as a

157
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:32.190
way to potentially prevent cancer from even forming in the first place.

158
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:37.320
So I was turned on to,
um,
doctor Valter Longo,
his new book,

159
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:40.410
the longevity diet,
and I had him on my podcast.
If you've seen this book yet.

160
00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.920
I have seen that.
Yeah.
I haven't read it,
but I have seen it.
Yeah,

161
00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:45.210
it's pretty awesome.
So the,

162
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:49.460
there's a whole chapter on his FMD protocol in which you need to do to the,

163
00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.700
do these five day fast.
And so I guess getting into what it actually is.

164
00:09:53.701 --> 00:09:58.050
So how it differs from a water only fast is that you do have calories,

165
00:09:58.051 --> 00:10:01.560
so you have around 700 or so calories per day.
Um,

166
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.130
some people say that sounds like a lot.
Some people say it sounds like a little,

167
00:10:05.131 --> 00:10:06.810
it's actually not that much food.

168
00:10:06.811 --> 00:10:11.550
It's like a handful of small soups and some crackers and you know,

169
00:10:11.551 --> 00:10:13.680
the first day it's not so bad.
You're like,
oh,
I can do this.

170
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.130
Like some crackers and a little bit of soup and then day two and day three and

171
00:10:17.131 --> 00:10:20.850
you're like,
oh my God,
I'm dying.
Right.
But it's not nearly as bad as water only.

172
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.060
Um,
but the,
the,

173
00:10:22.061 --> 00:10:27.061
the idea is that you eat just enough food to still get into this fasted state.

174
00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:29.790
So all of your inflammation markers,
all of the things that,

175
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.280
the different markers that are looking at in your blood,

176
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.890
they look just like you're,

177
00:10:33.891 --> 00:10:37.290
you're doing a water only fast but with a minimal amount of food.

178
00:10:37.291 --> 00:10:39.540
So you have a little bit of,

179
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.750
not as much hunger and a little bit more energy.

180
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.640
And so the compliance is much higher.

181
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.450
Were you tracking when you do these FMDs,

182
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:50.400
have you tracked your ketone levels at all?

183
00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:54.240
Do you get into ketosis or does the small amount of carbohydrate and so on that

184
00:10:54.241 --> 00:10:58.530
you're consuming keep you out of Ketosis?
I get a mild,

185
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.560
I would say I get around 0.5 or so millimolars so it's like a very my own the

186
00:11:04.681 --> 00:11:07.040
edge,
right,
which is kind of brutal cause the,

187
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:11.790
you're kind of in the Keto flu symptom area and so you're not fully into
ketosis.

188
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.520
Well this is really interesting because um,
so uh,

189
00:11:14.521 --> 00:11:17.340
Tia Peter Attia who you've got on the show a few times,

190
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:21.810
he's my doctor and I know you work with them as well and we've kind of like

191
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.590
played around with this,
this protocol in that um,
uh,

192
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:30.540
Tia has put together an FMD diet that is a lot more ketogenic friendly,

193
00:11:30.541 --> 00:11:35.070
so a lot heavier on the fats and a lot less on the refined carbohydrates.

194
00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:35.791
So for example,

195
00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:39.360
when you're doing long goes version of this diet and he actually has a nonprofit

196
00:11:39.361 --> 00:11:41.610
called prolonged,
so you'd actually just ordered this kit.

197
00:11:41.611 --> 00:11:44.790
So I get a kid in the mail that has all the prepackaged food.

198
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.440
If you're watching the video version of this,

199
00:11:46.441 --> 00:11:50.190
this is what it looks like here as happened to have one of this is like day five

200
00:11:50.191 --> 00:11:52.410
or day five.
What do they do?

201
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.580
What does the nonprofit do with the money that they get?

202
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.280
Because it looks very research,
it goes back into research.
That's right.
And,

203
00:11:58.281 --> 00:12:01.090
and Longo doesn't receive any of the,
in any of the money at all.

204
00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.910
He doesn't take a salary.
Um,
and so,
you know,

205
00:12:03.911 --> 00:12:07.810
this is meant for people that want to create a little autophagy,

206
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.250
a little cell death,
um,
uh,
generate new stem cells,
which he has proven.

207
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:15.580
I'm actually happens via this five day method.

208
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:20.910
And so the thing that hooked me though is I have had and elevated cholesterol.

209
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:22.271
Uh,

210
00:12:22.271 --> 00:12:25.990
I'm on my whole father's side of the family and that's turned into heart disease

211
00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:28.180
with my dad and him passing away from a heart attack.

212
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:30.370
My grandpa passed away from a heart attack.

213
00:12:30.371 --> 00:12:33.800
My Grandma on my dad's side passed away from a heart attack.
So like it's,

214
00:12:33.801 --> 00:12:38.620
it's running deep.
Uh,
and it's a little bit scary,
you know,
now that I'm 40,

215
00:12:38.621 --> 00:12:43.020
I've got,
um,
these,
uh,
pretty bad numbers,
so,
so much so that,
uh,

216
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.630
a tia has put me on Crestor,
which is,
um,
you know,

217
00:12:46.631 --> 00:12:50.190
knocking back the bad cholesterol,
um,
with the Staten.

218
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:55.160
But obviously I'd prefer not to be on a statin.
Anyway,
long story short,
um,

219
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.270
I decided to,
because of his book,
the longevity diet,

220
00:12:58.271 --> 00:13:02.230
I was reading through it and he said that he was seeing people that did the five

221
00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:04.940
day fast,
they were improving their cholesterol numbers,
um,

222
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.650
and they were getting more good cholesterol and less bad cholesterol.

223
00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:10.150
So I was like,
oh,
that sounds interesting.
I might as well give this a shot.

224
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:12.910
But to give it a proper shot you're supposed to do.

225
00:13:12.911 --> 00:13:16.510
And I and I talked too long about this,
but three back to back,

226
00:13:16.511 --> 00:13:21.190
five day fasts of the over three months and then once a quarter.
Okay.

227
00:13:21.191 --> 00:13:23.800
So you do,
there's like a loading phase of fast.
That's right.

228
00:13:23.801 --> 00:13:28.801
You do whatever the first week of each month for three months and the king of

229
00:13:29.111 --> 00:13:31.700
fascinating.
Right.

230
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:36.490
And then you do maintenance once a quarter thereafter.
That's right.
Okay.
Yeah.

231
00:13:36.491 --> 00:13:40.240
So I did the first five day fast three months ago.
Um,

232
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:45.010
had my blood work drawn,
drawn pre and post,
um,
you know,
small,

233
00:13:45.011 --> 00:13:47.380
minor improvements,
second fast,
same thing.

234
00:13:47.381 --> 00:13:52.381
And then by the third we actually saw a dramatic drop on a few different fronts

235
00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:56.990
cholesterol wise and a tia was like when he called me up my uh,

236
00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.300
cause we do these like little,
you know,

237
00:13:58.301 --> 00:14:01.480
calls to go over my blood work and he was like,
Kevin,
you're going to,

238
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:04.840
you're going to live to 90 if you keep this up.
This is amazing.

239
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.380
So he was shocked and he was blown away.
And so,
um,

240
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.320
we're pretty happy with the results.
We'll see how long they stick.
Um,

241
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.440
and this is no dietary changes.
This is just,

242
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:18.340
I mean granted there's a dietary change during those five days,
but no,

243
00:14:18.341 --> 00:14:19.031
like long term,

244
00:14:19.031 --> 00:14:22.810
I'm still kind of sticking to the same diet that I've always been been sticking

245
00:14:22.811 --> 00:14:27.490
to.
I liked it.
He was so specific with 90,
that's lower than I would've expected.

246
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.120
So it must be all the way with it.

247
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.190
It must be all the math that you're doing that's going to kill you.
Yeah.

248
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.770
I mean I still do a dose of Methadone every now and then,
but no,

249
00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.160
actually speak at Meth,
dude.

250
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.620
I just did some lt and even for the first time today.
Yeah.
Yeah.

251
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:43.450
Have you tried this with coffee?
I,
it is very interesting stuff to be sure.

252
00:14:43.451 --> 00:14:46.660
My God,
dude,
I had never tried it before.
I took a pill of it.

253
00:14:46.661 --> 00:14:51.530
I took a 200 milligrams this morning and I was out with with a a mutual friend,

254
00:14:51.531 --> 00:14:52.101
Tony Conrad.

255
00:14:52.101 --> 00:14:56.330
We met for coffee and I gave him the pill too and we were like cracked out for

256
00:14:56.331 --> 00:14:57.620
like three hours,
man.

257
00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:00.601
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

258
00:15:00.601 --> 00:15:04.710
so this observing of the bio hacking is a mutual arrangement that Kevin and I

259
00:15:04.711 --> 00:15:09.540
have.
It's not just him watching be squirting fluid out of my elbow.

260
00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:13.620
I also observe things that you do now on the f on the FMD though,

261
00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:15.840
just to return to that for a second,

262
00:15:15.841 --> 00:15:20.841
you mentioned in passing that a tia had looked at the possibility of doing a

263
00:15:22.861 --> 00:15:26.770
lower carbohydrate,
higher fat yeah.

264
00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:30.810
<v 0>Protocol for that.
Yeah.
I'm sure he'd,
he'd give you the pdf if you,</v>

265
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.270
if you asked for it for the podcast notes.
Have you tried it?
I did,
yeah.

266
00:15:34.271 --> 00:15:37.310
I did that for the second one and it was,
I liked it.
Um,

267
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.350
actually I just happened to buy a three pack of the prolonged kids.

268
00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.150
I wanted to go through them and use them because they're not cheap.

269
00:15:43.151 --> 00:15:45.690
And so I just use that for the last one.
But I like it.

270
00:15:45.691 --> 00:15:48.790
Tias and that it's a little bit more work obviously because you're preparing

271
00:15:48.791 --> 00:15:49.624
your own food.

272
00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:54.220
But it's largely like his is different in that with ProLon you get these little

273
00:15:54.221 --> 00:15:57.130
tiny snacks throughout the entire day with his,

274
00:15:57.131 --> 00:16:00.790
it's one meal a day and it's a,
it's just a salad.

275
00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:02.950
It's like a Greens and like,
you know,

276
00:16:02.951 --> 00:16:07.540
three tablespoons or four tablespoons of olive oil and like six,
all of us.

277
00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:11.470
And you know,
like some sunflower seeds.
Like it's not,
it's not a whole lot,

278
00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:15.990
but it certainly is,
is,
um,
gives you,
it's not as refined.
And so you,
uh,

279
00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.910
I saw my ketone levels go up on his versus,
and I,

280
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.420
I think I had certainly more energy on his versus the prolonged.

281
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.650
<v 1>Got It.
Well,
I'll Ping Peter about that.</v>

282
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.720
It makes sense that you would on multiple levels that you would have higher

283
00:16:28.721 --> 00:16:29.311
ketone levels.

284
00:16:29.311 --> 00:16:33.770
And for people who are wondering how one would measure ketone levels,
uh,

285
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.010
think you and I still use the same device,

286
00:16:36.011 --> 00:16:40.230
which is the precision xtra x t r a by Abbott labs,

287
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:45.180
which does a sufficient job in measuring something called Bhb Beta

288
00:16:45.181 --> 00:16:48.450
hydroxybutyrate in the blood for,
uh,

289
00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.090
for a number of different reasons.

290
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:55.260
This is a much more precise and accurate,
well,

291
00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.230
let's just call it precise,
but consistently precise.
Maybe it's accurate,

292
00:16:58.231 --> 00:17:03.231
maybe it isn't a method of measuring ketones or whether the degree to which

293
00:17:03.931 --> 00:17:07.830
you're in Ketosis then peasticks because as your body becomes,

294
00:17:07.831 --> 00:17:12.670
or if you're already very efficient at using ketone bodies,
uh,

295
00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:15.660
you could show a false negative where you pee on this,
on the stick.

296
00:17:15.661 --> 00:17:18.910
It tells you you're not in Ketosis when in fact you are so the blood,

297
00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:23.010
the blood is just more accurate.
Uh,
well I'm glad you're going to live to 90.

298
00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:23.903
That makes me happy.

299
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.420
<v 0>Yeah,
I mean it was a,</v>

300
00:17:25.421 --> 00:17:29.650
it was a pretty cool experiment and certainly for someone that has heart disease

301
00:17:29.651 --> 00:17:32.260
running in their family,
um,
I'm going to keep it up.
I'm gonna,

302
00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.970
I'm gonna do another blood draw here next week to see where my levels are at and

303
00:17:36.971 --> 00:17:39.340
then I'm trying to do this quarterly that's in,

304
00:17:39.341 --> 00:17:42.070
hopefully if we can get it down to,
um,

305
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.260
where I won't be using Stanton's any longer,
that'd be great.

306
00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:49.430
<v 1>The last time we did a random show,
it was a very,
very long ago,</v>

307
00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:50.430
I believe

308
00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:51.541
<v 0>it was,</v>

309
00:17:51.541 --> 00:17:56.470
at least before you had a little monkey in your house.
And,

310
00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.630
uh,
a reason,
many reasons of course to stick around,

311
00:18:00.631 --> 00:18:03.180
but now a very compelling new reason.

312
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.570
So what is it w how would you describe,

313
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.280
since certainly I have no kids that I'm aware of at this point that's a good

314
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.170
claim or they're just,
you know,
that I,

315
00:18:15.171 --> 00:18:18.600
I don't have kids asterisks that I know of.
Uh,

316
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:24.350
what have been the biggest changes that you've felt or observed in yourself or

317
00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:26.410
otherwise?
How you view the world or anything like that?

318
00:18:26.411 --> 00:18:29.940
And now that you have a kid and what is your kid's name?

319
00:18:29.941 --> 00:18:31.710
I know you've Zelda.

320
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.980
She's four months old and she's named after the video game because,
um,

321
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:39.900
one of the first things that my wife and I bonded on a very early on in our

322
00:18:39.901 --> 00:18:42.180
relationship was our love for the game.
Zelda.

323
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:46.530
And actually the new Zelda game allows you to track your hours played.

324
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.360
They actually shows it in like the little settings menu.
And so Daria has,
um,

325
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.740
like over 200 hours play to the latest Zelda.
So she's,
she's hardcore.

326
00:18:55.741 --> 00:18:58.620
She played it a lot during your pregnancy is a true believer end.

327
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:03.270
When we were in Japan a long time ago,
uh,

328
00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:06.360
Daria was using some type of emulator,
I don't know what it,

329
00:19:06.361 --> 00:19:09.990
what device it was on exactly what she was playing Zelda on all of the trains

330
00:19:09.991 --> 00:19:14.430
when we were sitting down and chilling.
That's original.
Yeah.
Josh Cook was too.

331
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.080
Yeah,
that's right.
Yeah.
That's,

332
00:19:17.081 --> 00:19:20.520
it's fun to play the original ones with those old school emulators.
Um,
but yeah,

333
00:19:20.521 --> 00:19:23.580
so in,
in terms of her,
I mean it's,
it's hard for,

334
00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:28.230
I think a guy in that when you first have your first child,
it's,
it's like,
um,

335
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:33.360
there's not a whole lot to do.
There's just like a lot of crying.
And so it's,

336
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:36.720
you know,
I tried to help out where I can,
but it's really like,
you know,

337
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:41.190
on the hip of mom,
she was for the first several weeks and just,

338
00:19:41.191 --> 00:19:44.460
there's a lot of getting used to new things and then now it's just,

339
00:19:44.461 --> 00:19:47.340
it's just amazing to have you walk into a room and she lights up when she sees

340
00:19:47.341 --> 00:19:50.760
me for the first time,
she smiles and giggles and,
you know,

341
00:19:50.761 --> 00:19:55.440
it kind of changes the way that I want to approach life in terms of,

342
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:56.340
um,

343
00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:00.930
what things are important and trying to make more time to be a good father.

344
00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.460
And so,
uh,

345
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:07.090
for someone like myself and that has so many varying interests in,

346
00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.870
in certainly can get sucked into new things pretty easily.

347
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:14.700
I've been trying to be a little bit more thoughtful about where,
where,

348
00:20:14.701 --> 00:20:19.260
and when I spend my energy.
Um,
so that I can kind of dial back,
you know,

349
00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.490
so I've spent a good portion of this year trying to live a little bit more

350
00:20:23.491 --> 00:20:27.960
minimalist lifestyle.
What are some of the steps that you've taken to do that?

351
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.030
Well,
um,

352
00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.960
one of the things I feel like you and I have had this conversation every year

353
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:37.840
since we first met,
but now you actually have a,

354
00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:42.240
a gigantic incentive to follow through.
It's funny,

355
00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:46.080
every time I get together it's just like,
aw man,
I've got too many investments.

356
00:20:46.081 --> 00:20:48.190
I'm doing this.
There's many things going on.

357
00:20:48.191 --> 00:20:50.200
And I got into my time here and we're always like,

358
00:20:50.201 --> 00:20:53.320
come more or less complaining to each other of just like,

359
00:20:53.321 --> 00:20:57.640
just taking on too many things.
Um,
even it's so ridiculous.

360
00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:02.650
Um,
uh,
so I just been trying to

361
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.340
implement a few rules.

362
00:21:06.341 --> 00:21:11.260
So one of the things I did start in January 1st was to throw away or donate

363
00:21:11.261 --> 00:21:12.550
something every single day.

364
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:17.740
And so I have forced myself to go in.
And so for example,

365
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.120
um,
a few days ago I went in and I just like picked out all the clothes that I

366
00:21:22.121 --> 00:21:26.320
haven't touched in a year and I took them down the street.

367
00:21:26.321 --> 00:21:29.800
Like I had a half a block away is a donation place and I donated anything that I

368
00:21:29.801 --> 00:21:31.030
hadn't worn in a year.

369
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.800
And it really thins out your closet and I've been just announced it.

370
00:21:34.801 --> 00:21:37.630
Was that easy for you to do or do have an absolutely it was,

371
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:39.030
there was no resistance.
You are like,

372
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:44.020
but that's the sweater that my Auntie Jaynie gave me and no,

373
00:21:44.021 --> 00:21:48.340
I mean who's that lady you had in your podcast that wrote that book on repleting

374
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:52.180
called Marie Kondo.
Yes.
Will,
this isn't technically muddy on those,

375
00:21:52.181 --> 00:21:55.900
how they would say in Japanese,
but Marie Kondo.
Marie Kondo,
yeah.
She's awesome.

376
00:21:55.901 --> 00:21:59.650
So I listened to her audio book and one of the things that she says in her audio

377
00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:04.651
book is that the way that you can depart with something is to realize that it is

378
00:22:05.051 --> 00:22:06.730
already taught you it's lesson.

379
00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:10.810
And that lesson may be that it wasn't for you.
Right.

380
00:22:10.811 --> 00:22:14.320
So like if you have it hanging in your closet and you look at and you're like,

381
00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:15.400
oh,
but I have some day,

382
00:22:15.401 --> 00:22:19.210
I might know the lesson is that it spent its time with you.

383
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.990
It wasn't for you and it should go to a good home or it can be appreciated by

384
00:22:22.991 --> 00:22:26.870
someone else.
And so my lesson is not to buy it again.
And,
and,

385
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:31.300
and so I took that and I've applied that to thinning out pretty much everything

386
00:22:31.301 --> 00:22:34.750
in my life.
And so every single day,
and I think that a lot of people,

387
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.590
there's like this analysis paralysis thing where you think about cleaning out

388
00:22:38.591 --> 00:22:41.650
the garage.
Are you thinking about doing this massive overhaul in your life?

389
00:22:41.651 --> 00:22:44.590
And you're like,
oh,
you know,
I just,
the weekend I got to do this.

390
00:22:44.591 --> 00:22:47.200
And there's always something that jumps in front of it in terms of priorities.

391
00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:52.510
For me,
it's like I find that if I just say,
okay,
one thing a day,

392
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.410
like at the end of the year I'm going to,
I may not be to my goal,

393
00:22:56.411 --> 00:22:58.890
but after five years I certainly will.
Yeah.
You know,
it's,

394
00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.960
it's not like I have that much stuff,
but just really saying,

395
00:23:01.961 --> 00:23:06.961
do I need this in my life and is it bringing joy to my life I think is such a

396
00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:10.990
good forcing function to like get rid of a lot of stuff and everything that you

397
00:23:10.991 --> 00:23:15.550
get rid of is actually less of a mental load on you.
There was this,

398
00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:16.001
uh,

399
00:23:16.001 --> 00:23:20.260
old tea master that I'm at one time and Tim and I have done some crazy travels

400
00:23:20.261 --> 00:23:23.380
all throughout China,
um,
in,
in t lands,
but there was this,

401
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:27.310
there was this one guy I met the stories we could tell.
Yes,
seriously.

402
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.370
We've done some crazy stuff in the middle of the Yunan province,

403
00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:36.790
nothing sexual.
Um,
that was our friend.

404
00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:40.450
We gotta do something.

405
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:47.090
So a long story short,
um,
the,
the one thing that,
um,
this,

406
00:23:47.091 --> 00:23:51.290
this tea master showed me is he pulled out of his pocket one key and he showed

407
00:23:51.291 --> 00:23:54.590
me the one kid.
He goes,
Kevin,
do you know what this is?
And I,
as I get is,

408
00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:58.930
it's a key,
you know,
and he's like,
yeah,
it's,
it's the key to my house.
Like it,

409
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.460
this is,
this is my one key.
He's like,

410
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:06.410
I've worked my entire life to have one key because we can all have multiple

411
00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:09.290
keys.
You know,
you meaning like the things that you purchase,

412
00:24:09.291 --> 00:24:14.240
whether you have a key to your boat or your spare garage or another,
you know,

413
00:24:14.241 --> 00:24:16.190
a,
a motorcycle or whatever it may be.

414
00:24:16.191 --> 00:24:20.070
There's things in your life that you accumulate and the least amount of burden

415
00:24:20.071 --> 00:24:23.420
and the most happiness you can get is like having less stuff to worry about.

416
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.760
And so the,
I find that to be really true.

417
00:24:25.761 --> 00:24:27.500
And so that's what I've been trying to focus on is,

418
00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:30.670
is just having less and being happy with,
uh,

419
00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.750
a very handful of high quality things.

420
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:34.720
<v 1>I also want to mention that</v>

421
00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:41.290
it's possible to read a book like Marie Condo's book,

422
00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.070
which I can never remember the title of,

423
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:45.880
cause I want to say it's like the magic art of Japanese tidying up.

424
00:24:45.881 --> 00:24:47.290
Then it's like,
no,
it's something close.

425
00:24:47.291 --> 00:24:50.770
It's like the art of the joy of magic cleaning up.

426
00:24:50.771 --> 00:24:54.220
I can never remember the exact phrasing.
I don't know why,
but in any case,

427
00:24:54.221 --> 00:24:59.221
that coal following with her book leads some readers to think it's an all or

428
00:24:59.831 --> 00:25:02.200
nothing,
take it or leave it approach.

429
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:07.060
So you on the other hand have philosophically found bits and pieces of that book

430
00:25:07.061 --> 00:25:08.380
that are very useful to you,

431
00:25:08.381 --> 00:25:13.330
but her teacher tactically actually doing the opposite of what she recommends,

432
00:25:13.331 --> 00:25:13.991
but it works for you.

433
00:25:13.991 --> 00:25:18.991
So she recommends doing this like once in a lifetime tidying Superbowl basically

434
00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:22.660
where you black out two or three days of your life and that's what you do.

435
00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.540
And then the rest is maintenance.
It's kind of like the fast,

436
00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:30.730
the fast mimicking diet of Japanese tiding,
right?
You have this loading phase.

437
00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.130
And I've had this book,

438
00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:38.160
I actually am looking at it on my bookshelf right now for like two years and I'm

439
00:25:38.741 --> 00:25:42.160
just like,
man,
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to do it.

440
00:25:42.161 --> 00:25:44.770
And then I'm like two to three days,
I look at my calendar,
I'm like,
no,

441
00:25:44.771 --> 00:25:46.630
I'm not going to do it.
I'm just not going to do it.

442
00:25:46.631 --> 00:25:51.631
So I like the idea tactically of one at a time.

443
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:57.070
Uh,
one per day.
And also,
uh,
what's,
what's helped me because I do,

444
00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:00.850
I have actually been,
since I moved to Austin not too long ago,

445
00:26:00.851 --> 00:26:04.150
it's been a great opportunity after boxing everything up,
it's like,
okay,

446
00:26:04.151 --> 00:26:08.230
do I really want to unbox all this stuff or do I just want to donate a lot of

447
00:26:08.231 --> 00:26:08.560
this?

448
00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:13.560
Because it might be from a one to 10 scale of value,

449
00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.410
a two to me or maybe a one,
maybe a three,

450
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:22.680
but I could donate this very easily to goodwill or somewhere else to say a high

451
00:26:22.931 --> 00:26:24.850
school gym that needs equipment,

452
00:26:24.851 --> 00:26:29.020
which is something I've done in the past and it's an immediate eight,
nine or 10.

453
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:31.930
It's just a better,
it's,
it's an,
it's a,

454
00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:37.050
it's a nice karmic chess move to donate and you said to think of not what you're

455
00:26:38.111 --> 00:26:41.890
losing,
but also what you're giving to someone else in that respect.
Uh,

456
00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.390
which I find really helpful.
So you're giving away one item per day.

457
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:47.161
The other thing too,

458
00:26:47.161 --> 00:26:52.140
I will tell you along those lines is that if there is a purchase that I want to

459
00:26:52.141 --> 00:26:56.550
make,
um,
that is not just what I would consider to be a,
you know,

460
00:26:56.551 --> 00:27:00.240
a necessity like toilet paper or whatever it may be.
Um,

461
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:04.290
and it's something that is,
is,
is luxury or not luxury,

462
00:27:04.291 --> 00:27:05.670
but in the sense of like,
you know,

463
00:27:05.671 --> 00:27:08.310
it's going to cost you over a hundred dollars and I don't necessarily need it,

464
00:27:08.311 --> 00:27:11.640
but I kind of want to try it.
Um,
you can,

465
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.670
what I do is I save for later on Amazon's,

466
00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:16.590
you can add and say save for later and you know,

467
00:27:16.591 --> 00:27:21.591
set a reminder in your calender app for a week or two weeks later.

468
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.050
And almost 90% of the time I ended up not buying that thing.

469
00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.890
I still have one thing in there actually from you.
It's um,
uh,

470
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:32.970
that not NAC knock supplement.
Yeah.
Should I buy that?

471
00:27:32.971 --> 00:27:37.290
And it's not decided yet.
Well,
NEC,
uh,
so this is,

472
00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:42.860
I should say with all of this stuff that we're discussing because it bears

473
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:47.940
repeating,
we are not doctors,
we don't play them on the Internet.
So everybody,

474
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.650
everybody should assume that at least 50% of what we're saying is complete

475
00:27:52.651 --> 00:27:55.950
fucking nonsense and we're just not sure which 50% it is.

476
00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.980
So work with a qualified professional before you start taking course stopping

477
00:28:01.471 --> 00:28:04.770
any type of medication or supplement.
The NBC

478
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.830
came to me initially because I was,

479
00:28:08.831 --> 00:28:13.831
I was looking at at it as a means to accelerate recovery between workouts and

480
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.730
uh,
my understanding,
I might be getting this wrong,

481
00:28:17.731 --> 00:28:20.850
but is that it is a precursor to glutathione,

482
00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:23.130
which some people think of as this

483
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:29.820
master antioxidant or upstream antioxidant that has a host of beneficial
effects.

484
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:35.630
And what I noticed in taking the NAC is that I was over the period of a week to

485
00:28:38.911 --> 00:28:42.090
10 days,
perhaps seven,
eight days into it that I was,

486
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:46.620
I was more even keeled than tip than,
than was typical.

487
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.760
I felt very like the week had been very smooth and I hadn't changed anything

488
00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:53.160
else that I could identify.

489
00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:57.480
I had been either meditating or not meditating for a series of weeks.

490
00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:02.160
There were a lot of constants and when I went on to pub med and began to look at

491
00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:07.550
an Acetyl cystine and search for other terms like depression or bipolar and so

492
00:29:08.701 --> 00:29:09.534
on,

493
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:14.630
there were a number of search results that popped up that seemed to indicate to

494
00:29:14.851 --> 00:29:19.851
me that there was some promise in using NAC to mitigate the amplitude of the ups

495
00:29:21.151 --> 00:29:25.680
and downs that could be associated with say bipolar and that that's the primary

496
00:29:25.681 --> 00:29:30.660
reason that for for periods of time and I cycle off of all of these things,

497
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:33.810
I become very fascinated by NAC,

498
00:29:33.811 --> 00:29:38.460
which quite nicely does have potentially recovery benefits from an athletic

499
00:29:38.461 --> 00:29:38.940
standpoint.

500
00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:43.940
Although most of my athletic prowess has been focused on eating oatmeal cookies

501
00:29:44.321 --> 00:29:47.950
recently.
So I can't really claim that I'm doing a lot of,
uh,
killer workouts.

502
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.690
I got rhabdo from eating oatmeal cookies for you crossfitters out there.

503
00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.290
That's for you.
But,
uh,

504
00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.150
the other would be something you and I are both familiar with.
It's with a,

505
00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.600
which is a low dose lithium Orotate,
very,

506
00:30:01.601 --> 00:30:04.900
very low dose lithium Orotate five milligrams,

507
00:30:04.901 --> 00:30:08.170
which you can find on Amazon and elsewhere.
And uh,

508
00:30:08.171 --> 00:30:13.171
there's a great New York Times article which people can find very easily that is

509
00:30:13.451 --> 00:30:17.440
titled a long the lines of maybe we all just need a little bit of lithium and it

510
00:30:17.441 --> 00:30:22.060
talks about the inverse correlation of groundwater concentrations of lithium

511
00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:27.130
with,
I want to say at least reported suicide,

512
00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:30.730
homicide,
manic depression,
uh,
and so on.

513
00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:36.150
So those two for me function in tandem or at least appeal to me for very similar

514
00:30:38.621 --> 00:30:41.200
reasons.
So the NAC should you use it or not,

515
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.930
I think is a question of whether you feel you need it.

516
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:48.580
And for me at least currently,
uh,
I get asked all the time like,

517
00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:51.010
what are your top 10 supplements that you're using right now?

518
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.560
Because people have this impression after reading the four hour body and so on

519
00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:58.150
that I'm just like,
I walk around with a drip,

520
00:30:58.151 --> 00:31:03.070
ivy bag in my arm and have a thousand pills.
I'm taking the four times a day.

521
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:06.550
I've certainly seen you in that scene that no,
you have seen me in that mode,

522
00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:11.580
but my mode right now is to really ensure that I am using supplements as

523
00:31:12.641 --> 00:31:17.641
supplements and that I'm not using them to absolve me of the responsibility to

524
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:22.390
eat proper food,
for instance.
And it's like,
look,

525
00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:27.420
if you're drinking a lot and you're like compulsively watching porn and not

526
00:31:28.211 --> 00:31:32.260
exercising and like mainlining pixie sticks for your diet and you're like,
wow,

527
00:31:32.261 --> 00:31:34.720
I'm depressed,
maybe I should take 15 different supplements.
It's like,
no,

528
00:31:34.721 --> 00:31:37.620
you need to fucking fix the rest of your life.
Right,
right,
right.

529
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.530
And then see what your baseline is because you're creating so much static and

530
00:31:41.531 --> 00:31:46.370
noise and garbage inputs that you don't even know what your baseline is and
it's,

531
00:31:46.371 --> 00:31:49.270
it's so disguised with sort of the,

532
00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:52.580
the trauma and confusion of your inputs that you need to do.

533
00:31:52.581 --> 00:31:55.900
You track your baseline,
like do you log what you,

534
00:31:55.930 --> 00:32:00.100
what you consume and what you take.
I log,
you know,
my baseline.

535
00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:02.050
Is this going to sound so primitive?
And it is,

536
00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:06.790
but my baseline is really how do I feel when I wake up,
you know,
do I,

537
00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.580
do I want to stay in bed because I don't want to face the day?

538
00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:14.230
Am I anxious or those my first thoughts coming out of bed assuming that I'm not

539
00:32:14.231 --> 00:32:16.080
checking my phone.
Right.
Because,
um,
it,

540
00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:21.180
it's really my starting state out of the gate of wake,

541
00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:24.910
sleep to wakefulness and then at night,
how much trouble do I have sleeping,

542
00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:28.810
if any?
Or do I fall asleep easily?
How deep is my sleep?

543
00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:30.520
And so for deepness of sleep,

544
00:32:30.521 --> 00:32:34.780
you could certainly use something like an aura ring or an accelorometer.
I mean,

545
00:32:34.781 --> 00:32:37.960
there are different means by which you could try to assess the quality of your

546
00:32:37.961 --> 00:32:39.250
sleep.
But from me

547
00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:47.610
really looking at how consistently I feel good waking up and how long it takes

548
00:32:48.311 --> 00:32:52.600
me to get up to say first or second gear because it does,
it,
it,

549
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:57.400
it historically has taken me a long time to go from park to like second or third

550
00:32:57.401 --> 00:33:00.310
gear.
Some people wake up and you might be one of these people and they're like,

551
00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.120
fuck it world.
Here I am ready to party.
That's not me.

552
00:33:04.121 --> 00:33:06.460
It's like I have a real slow build and

553
00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:10.330
<v 0>in between you and that I am definitely not ready to party the second I wake up,</v>

554
00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.410
get him after coffee.

555
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.760
<v 1>I have a cup of coffee,
I'm ready party.
So I feel that way.
If for instance,</v>

556
00:33:14.761 --> 00:33:19.050
I'm in ketosis passed about two millimeters.
Hmm.
I need less sleep.

557
00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:22.260
So let's call it six versus eight hours.
And when I wake up,

558
00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:27.290
I'm awake versus feeling groggy for an hour or two hour and a half,

559
00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.620
uh,

560
00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:32.430
which can be remedied somewhat by the psychological advantage of exercising in

561
00:33:32.431 --> 00:33:36.540
the morning,
which is one thing I've been scheduling to do more of.
Uh,

562
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:37.800
Jocko Willink,

563
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:43.290
a retired navy seal commander and all around intense,

564
00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:47.070
intense,
intense,
accomplished guy.
Uh,
people can find him.
Tim.
Dot.

565
00:33:47.071 --> 00:33:50.790
Blog slash Jocko first ever public interview.
Uh,

566
00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:54.630
so I'm thrilled to have unleashed the giant white gorilla on the Internet.

567
00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.550
And,
uh,

568
00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.640
baseline though to return to your question is really something I try to keep as

569
00:34:01.641 --> 00:34:05.060
simple as possible.
Do I,
and have I measured all those other things?
Yes.

570
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.530
But I think that whether it's with your body or with a business

571
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:10.820
<v 2>yeah.</v>

572
00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.680
<v 1>Or any number of other things,</v>

573
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:17.480
it's really easy to become addicted to measuring things that don't matter very

574
00:34:17.481 --> 00:34:20.310
much.
Uh,
or,
uh,

575
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:24.980
we're still measuring things that will distract you from the things that do

576
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:29.630
matter.
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
Yeah,
that totally makes sense.
Yeah.

577
00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:33.150
<v 0>Um,
I,
I've,
I,
I've tried to kind of pair it down to the,</v>

578
00:34:33.151 --> 00:34:36.990
just the stuff I really care about.
I just sent you a link in our video chat,
um,

579
00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:41.800
to my dashboard for the things I measure every day.
Cool.
Um,
so for me,
you know,

580
00:34:41.801 --> 00:34:45.190
I'm really concerned about my glucose levels because they are a tiny bit hell of

581
00:34:45.191 --> 00:34:49.600
it elevated.
So I do Waking Glucose,
bedtime,
glucose.
I do,

582
00:34:49.601 --> 00:34:51.910
whether I meditated that day or not,
I do.

583
00:34:51.911 --> 00:34:54.490
How many hours I fasted the night prior.
I do,

584
00:34:54.491 --> 00:34:57.670
how many drinks I've had and then I do what type of workout,

585
00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:01.390
whether I had tea or coffee that day and then my food,
but food,

586
00:35:01.391 --> 00:35:06.160
not in terms of kind of a a bike by the calorie,
you know,

587
00:35:06.161 --> 00:35:07.800
super anal kind of breakdown,

588
00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:12.130
but really just typing out what I ate for that day as a way to hold myself

589
00:35:12.131 --> 00:35:16.060
accountable and just like look over the last few days at a glance and see if

590
00:35:16.061 --> 00:35:17.500
I've been behaving or not.

591
00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.430
So I find that just the act of writing it down makes me behave a little bit

592
00:35:21.431 --> 00:35:21.710
better.

593
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:22.311
<v 1>It does.
Okay.</v>

594
00:35:22.311 --> 00:35:27.311
That was going to be my question is how does that actually impact your behavior?

595
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:31.620
<v 0>I,
you know,
I,
this is a fascinating question.
I,
I've,</v>

596
00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.560
I didn't experiment here about,
um,

597
00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:39.740
three weeks ago with a group of five and I asked them all,

598
00:35:39.931 --> 00:35:43.980
I created this spreadsheet that we all logged into every single day.

599
00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:48.240
And what you do is you record the number of drinks you had the night before.

600
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.510
And I was thinking about turning this into an APP,

601
00:35:51.511 --> 00:35:52.590
although I'm not going to do it.

602
00:35:52.591 --> 00:35:57.591
But I was interested in trying to create social pressure to drink less,

603
00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.820
not to drink more,
but to drink less.

604
00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:05.180
And the thing that I found that was really interesting is that if you drink over

605
00:36:05.401 --> 00:36:09.330
two drinks in a night,
people have some shame and reporting that.

606
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:12.370
And so they will misreport.
So you know,

607
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.820
if you went out and you had like four or five drinks,
it's like,
ah,

608
00:36:14.821 --> 00:36:18.630
I don't want to be the guy that had the one that's on the spreadsheet.
Right,

609
00:36:18.631 --> 00:36:21.210
exactly.
So I changed it then.

610
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:26.040
So the spreadsheet would only say two plus.
And so that's the Max you could go.

611
00:36:26.041 --> 00:36:29.070
And then people were a lot more like open to being like,
yeah,

612
00:36:29.071 --> 00:36:31.980
I had two plus last night.
You know,
there were a lot more at ease.
Right.

613
00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:35.610
But it still created a little bit of social pressure and personal pressure.

614
00:36:35.611 --> 00:36:37.230
If you looked at your list and you're like,
Ooh,

615
00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:39.180
there's been four nights of two plus there,

616
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:41.340
I should probably do a night without drinking.
Right.

617
00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:45.990
So my idea was to create an app that would allow you just to say up to two plus

618
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.920
and see all of your friends in the same arena and then kind of hopefully

619
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:54.300
encourage you to be able to drink socially but not take it too far.
Yeah,

620
00:36:54.301 --> 00:36:59.301
the springs up all sorts of really fascinating and frustrating methodological

621
00:37:00.241 --> 00:37:03.870
questions in terms of designing this type of reporting.
Right.

622
00:37:03.871 --> 00:37:06.270
Because I was thinking to myself as you were saying this,
well,

623
00:37:06.271 --> 00:37:09.360
if you had a larger group,
say a group of 200 people,

624
00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:13.650
you would have one would expect you would have more people in that group

625
00:37:13.651 --> 00:37:18.090
reporting drinking two,
three,
four drinks on any given night.

626
00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:22.620
So the shame factor would be decreased.
But if you decrease the shame factor,

627
00:37:22.621 --> 00:37:27.621
that also decrease the incentive to actually behave.

628
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:27.901
Right?

629
00:37:27.901 --> 00:37:32.901
Because you can blend into this right perceived acceptability of being like,

630
00:37:34.531 --> 00:37:37.530
well,
there are the 10 other people out of 200 about four drinks last night.

631
00:37:37.531 --> 00:37:38.940
That's totally fine.
We're well,

632
00:37:38.941 --> 00:37:41.160
the question is like how well do you know the people want,

633
00:37:41.161 --> 00:37:43.720
so how tight are they are?
And you're like kind of social connections in your,

634
00:37:43.721 --> 00:37:47.160
your peer group.
And then also I think that there is,

635
00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:50.910
when I like Brennan Mulligan I'll call him out cause he's a friend of ours,

636
00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:55.440
he works at Google.
He like never drinks like he is like one drink,
one drink,

637
00:37:55.441 --> 00:37:57.180
you know like wondering every four days or whatever.

638
00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:00.600
And seeing him hit those streaks of like zero drinks,
zero drinks,

639
00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.970
that was also a pretty powerful thing.

640
00:38:02.971 --> 00:38:06.030
And I'm saying I need to be more like Brendan,
I need to dial it back.

641
00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.220
So it goes both ways.
Yeah,
that's true.

642
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:12.540
I suppose if you're seeing friends of yours doing well,
doing well,

643
00:38:12.541 --> 00:38:17.100
who have demanding jobs,
demanding relationships,

644
00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:22.160
you can't use that as your excuse when you have the data right in front of you

645
00:38:22.171 --> 00:38:26.490
showing that they're actually behaving.
So you,
you uh,

646
00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:30.330
you historically have been a nontrivial drinker,

647
00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:35.150
let's call it a a like a minor league,
all star of,

648
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.900
of boost consumption.
I used to drink a lot more to be honest,

649
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:39.303
my spreadsheet here.

650
00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:43.360
So what has helped you most to decrease the amount that you drink?

651
00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:48.070
Well I think there is fear.
Um,
you know,

652
00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:49.600
I've seen a bunch of studies.

653
00:38:49.601 --> 00:38:51.880
There was one that was just published here a couple of weeks ago.

654
00:38:51.881 --> 00:38:53.800
There's the said the number one.
Um,

655
00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:58.810
I the largest study ever around a dementia and alcohol abuse.
And um,

656
00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.500
they're very closely linked,
which is really frightening.
Um,

657
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:04.300
and I think just,
you know,

658
00:39:04.301 --> 00:39:07.060
wanting to live longer for my daughter's been another one back to the point that

659
00:39:07.061 --> 00:39:12.010
you had earlier about what has changed.
Um,
and just getting older,

660
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:16.180
you know,
hangovers get,
it happened at two and a half drinks these days.
It's so,

661
00:39:16.181 --> 00:39:20.690
it's like why,
why roll the dice?
And so for me it's,
um,
it,

662
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.760
it's finding,
uh,
to,

663
00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.170
to get to your question around what have I done differently.

664
00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:28.210
There's a couple things.
Um,

665
00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:33.220
one I've like kind of set aside time to learn at night,

666
00:39:33.221 --> 00:39:35.920
which I think is really important and you really can't drink and learn at the

667
00:39:35.921 --> 00:39:40.480
same time.
So,
um,
on a order,
remember what you attempt to learn.
Right.
Exactly.

668
00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:43.570
And the second thing that has been huge for me though has been the sauna.

669
00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:48.910
The sauna has been massive because it is like four drinks or three drinks just

670
00:39:48.911 --> 00:39:53.450
by going and doing a 30 minute high intense heat sauna session.
Um,

671
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:55.930
and you come home and you sleep like a baby and you know,

672
00:39:55.931 --> 00:39:59.650
if you don't have a sauna,
that can also be substituted with a really hot bath.

673
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:04.050
And just finding ways to,
it's like that.

674
00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:06.790
It's always been about,
I'm with my wife,

675
00:40:06.791 --> 00:40:10.000
I'm sitting down and we're going to crack open a bottle of wine and I'll have a

676
00:40:10.001 --> 00:40:12.670
couple of glasses of wine.
It's never been like,
Hey,
let's go party.

677
00:40:12.671 --> 00:40:17.460
Those days are long gone,
like,
you know,
a decade plus gone.
Um,
I've,

678
00:40:17.461 --> 00:40:22.300
I've,
no decade,
decade plus,
and if we're out traveling together,
Tim,

679
00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:24.760
I'm going to,
we're going to have fun.
Right.
Okay.

680
00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:28.570
So the only thing you and I hang,
it's like when we're traveling together,

681
00:40:28.571 --> 00:40:31.930
so you can't,
like,
you can't put that on me.
That's true.
All right.
All right.

682
00:40:31.931 --> 00:40:33.370
Fair enough.
We're in different cities now.

683
00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.910
I will say for those people who were like,
wait,
they can see each other.
Uh,

684
00:40:36.911 --> 00:40:39.690
we are doing a very intimate,
uh,

685
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:44.500
video chat on Skype that you,
you will be able to see on my youtube channel,

686
00:40:44.501 --> 00:40:47.410
just youtube.com forward slash timferriss two r's,
two s's.

687
00:40:47.411 --> 00:40:49.060
And Kevin is dressed for success.

688
00:40:49.061 --> 00:40:52.120
I will note he is at a partner meeting this morning,

689
00:40:52.121 --> 00:40:56.140
so we dress up a little bit.
I appreciate it.
I appreciate it.
So,

690
00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:00.850
uh,
so I gave you that look traveling's a bit of an exception.
Now,

691
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:02.470
how do you prevent yourself?

692
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:06.880
You like you have traveled a lot in some cases historically now that may change

693
00:41:06.881 --> 00:41:07.421
with your daughter,

694
00:41:07.421 --> 00:41:12.421
but how do you prevent that from becoming the excuse to drink that happens

695
00:41:16.841 --> 00:41:19.690
frequently?
Does that make sense?
Because this happens in all sorts of capacities,

696
00:41:19.691 --> 00:41:22.120
right?
Where people will say,
oh,
you're traveling.

697
00:41:22.121 --> 00:41:25.090
You should eat pizza every night.
Right?
I hear that.
And I'm like,
if I,

698
00:41:25.091 --> 00:41:28.890
if I followed that rule,
I'll be Jabba the Hutt because I,
I,

699
00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:32.530
I ended up traveling so much.
If I allowed myself that out,

700
00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:35.930
it would become a real problem.
Yeah,
yeah.
Traveling is,

701
00:41:35.931 --> 00:41:39.710
is difficult and especially when it's in kind of a,
a social setting,
you know,

702
00:41:39.711 --> 00:41:44.420
if you combine traveling with social,
like,
you know,
I'll be going to,
um,
to,

703
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:48.380
to Ted in a couple of weeks and I know that there's just going to be a lot of

704
00:41:48.381 --> 00:41:51.710
parties and a lot of events and a lot of drinking.
So,
um,

705
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.700
I think that's one of the things that I need to work on is that I have a hard

706
00:41:55.701 --> 00:41:59.090
time dealing with like large groups of people that I don't know.

707
00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:02.570
And as a social lubricant,
alcohol is amazing,
right?

708
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:05.990
So it's like what else can we do?
And,

709
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.320
and I think that that someone was telling me this,
that,
um,
you know,

710
00:42:09.321 --> 00:42:11.870
you never really strengthen that muscle.

711
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:14.660
Like if you're leaning on the crutch of alcohol,

712
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:19.040
so you're never going to become more comfortable with new humans and new

713
00:42:19.041 --> 00:42:22.940
interactions and new ways of kind of breaking the ice if you always just go to

714
00:42:22.941 --> 00:42:27.620
the booze,
right?
So I think of it as like,
okay,
this is my workout I'm going into.

715
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:31.160
And the other thing I do is I,
so I've got a couple of little hacks.

716
00:42:31.161 --> 00:42:34.940
One is to show up a little bit late,
so you then you skip a drink,
right?

717
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:39.260
And it's funny how if you skip a drink or two and you get there and people are

718
00:42:39.261 --> 00:42:40.400
already a little hammered.

719
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:44.720
How unattractive and unappealing drinking them becomes because you look at it

720
00:42:44.721 --> 00:42:46.370
and it was like,
hey,
it's good to see,
you know,

721
00:42:46.371 --> 00:42:49.340
and it's like a little bit sloppy and it's,
and you look at that and you're like,

722
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:52.820
okay,
they're relaxed.
They're not going to like,
you know,

723
00:42:52.821 --> 00:42:56.380
remember what I said anyway,
that Hammer.
But you know what I mean?
They're,

724
00:42:56.381 --> 00:42:57.440
they're in a relaxed state,

725
00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:01.220
so I can be a little bit more jokey and be myself and not have to worry about

726
00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:05.000
being hammered.
And so I think that that's a big piece of it.
Um,
you know,

727
00:43:05.001 --> 00:43:09.200
when I'm at home,
you're going to laugh at this.
But on Amazon I went in,

728
00:43:09.201 --> 00:43:11.170
I bought these,
um,
speaking,

729
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:14.330
buying more things and probably I'm going to throw away in a year.
Um,

730
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:18.590
I bought these measuring cups that measure out exactly one glass of wine.

731
00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:22.430
And so what I do there is like,
you know,
a,

732
00:43:22.431 --> 00:43:26.690
a bottle of wine we all know is like kind of like a half bottle of wine.

733
00:43:26.691 --> 00:43:29.090
It's like kind of two and a half maybe,
you know,
it's,

734
00:43:29.091 --> 00:43:32.180
it's up there and it's very easy.
Like,
like Daria,

735
00:43:32.181 --> 00:43:34.310
we'll just like have a little bit less than me and I'll say,
okay,

736
00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:36.890
well I'll just wait until he gets halfway and then I'll stop,
you know,

737
00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:40.140
just try and,
but you're actually drinking more than you think.
So,
yeah.

738
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:41.540
Plus with a wine glass,

739
00:43:41.541 --> 00:43:45.340
I mean if you have a large wine glass you can drink like a third of a bottle or

740
00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:48.320
supposed to have to know very easily.
Right,
exactly.

741
00:43:48.321 --> 00:43:52.670
So what I do now is I bought this measuring,
um,
glass off of Amazon.

742
00:43:52.671 --> 00:43:56.480
I feel that perfectly poured in,
get my second glass,

743
00:43:56.481 --> 00:44:00.080
Phillip perfectly import in.
And so that's all of my alcohol for the night.

744
00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:05.060
It stops me at two drinks and I,
I really take my time with it.

745
00:44:05.061 --> 00:44:08.240
Then,
you know,
I have dinner,
I slowly sit,
but I look at it,
you know,

746
00:44:08.241 --> 00:44:09.200
I go sit down,

747
00:44:09.201 --> 00:44:13.190
might watch a little John Oliver or something and then just like continue to sip

748
00:44:13.191 --> 00:44:17.210
on it.
And so that's my,
my way of locking.
And I know no more past that.

749
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:19.250
It's prevents any hangovers.
You know,

750
00:44:19.251 --> 00:44:23.750
my doctor says it's pretty good for you to have a glass or two a night.
So,
um,

751
00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:27.680
and then also do,
don't laugh.
It is good for you.

752
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:30.980
Okay,
I'll go with this

753
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:34.530
<v 1>now.
But then it's also just taking nights off all together.</v>

754
00:44:34.531 --> 00:44:39.090
I think that's the other big piece of it.
Yeah.
Yeah,
for sure.
Good for you man.

755
00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:41.910
I love it.
Now you mentioned one other thing,

756
00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:47.130
well actually a couple of other points cause I've been also cutting back on

757
00:44:47.131 --> 00:44:50.460
alcohol quite a bit.
I still enjoy alcohol.
Not going to lie.

758
00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:55.290
Like I do have booze on occasion.
I love you're drunk.
Like oh,
the drunk dials.

759
00:44:55.400 --> 00:45:00.150
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know,
I,
those are,
those are fun.
So for those who don't know,

760
00:45:00.151 --> 00:45:03.000
occasionally I do these drunk dial up so it's where I will,

761
00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:08.400
it's the laziest podcast format thought up I think to date perhaps,

762
00:45:09.031 --> 00:45:14.031
which is I have listeners fill out a Google form with their contact info and I

763
00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:22.700
set a time like a two hour window where I will call people via Skype and drink,

764
00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:29.180
start drinking at call one and drink all the way through to say call 10 and get

765
00:45:29.521 --> 00:45:32.850
progressively more inebriated as I answer questions so that that is fun.

766
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.670
I did one about a week ago,
it was a good time and then I thought,

767
00:45:35.671 --> 00:45:37.830
you know I should do another episode today.
And I was like,

768
00:45:37.831 --> 00:45:42.831
I just don't want to do two nights of sipping Tequila on Skype and a few things

769
00:45:44.551 --> 00:45:46.860
that have also helped me.
Number one is,

770
00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:50.520
and this is not an excuse everyone's going to be comfortable using,

771
00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:53.790
but if I go to a party and they're like,
hey man,
you're not drinking it,

772
00:45:53.791 --> 00:45:56.550
what the fuck?
Like [inaudible] I'll be like,
yeah,
I'm on a bunch of weird drugs.

773
00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:59.910
Like,
I just actually,
I'm not really interested post to take out,

774
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:01.230
I'm not supposed to drink alcohol right now,

775
00:46:01.231 --> 00:46:04.430
which that stops the conversation right there.
That's brilliant.
Yeah.

776
00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:06.630
Well it stops the push.
Right.

777
00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:10.090
And then it also starts another conversation,
which is,
well,

778
00:46:10.091 --> 00:46:14.190
what kind of weird shit are you on?
And if you,
at any given point,

779
00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:17.670
I think it's fair to say that I could answer in the affirmative to,

780
00:46:17.671 --> 00:46:21.800
are you on any weird shit?
Like I'm almost always doing something odd.
Uh,

781
00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:25.960
I might not be a lot of stuff,
but I'm probably trying something new and uh,

782
00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:29.430
that stops people cold if they're like,
oh wow.
I mean it could be Tylenol,

783
00:46:29.431 --> 00:46:33.150
like if you're taking Acetaminophen in any capacity,
people may not realize this,

784
00:46:33.151 --> 00:46:38.110
but some absurd percentage of emergency room visits and,
uh,

785
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.530
liver failures are associated with high dose Acetaminophen,

786
00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:44.190
which is not that much.

787
00:46:44.191 --> 00:46:49.191
It's something like two or three times the label allowable amount over 24 hours.

788
00:46:49.891 --> 00:46:53.880
It's really a potent and potentially dangerous drug.
Uh,

789
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:57.720
so that's one is like,
Hey,
I'm actually on this.
I mean on a,

790
00:46:57.721 --> 00:47:01.620
B and C or I'm on a bunch of weird stuff at the moment and I'm just not supposed

791
00:47:01.621 --> 00:47:03.900
to drink a works really well in second.

792
00:47:03.901 --> 00:47:08.730
This is actually advice that Richard Branson gave on this podcast is having club

793
00:47:08.731 --> 00:47:11.310
soda with a dash of cranberry juice or something like that.

794
00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:15.330
And just using that as your

795
00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:21.900
default go to.
And uh,
you know,
one thing that I do,

796
00:47:21.901 --> 00:47:24.900
which is going to sound really odd and it is odd,

797
00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:29.930
but I have a superstition about say cheersing

798
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:35.230
<v 0>right.
Clinking glasses when I don't have any alcohol in my glass.
So interesting.</v>

799
00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:39.160
Just your towel.
This is,
this is something,
well,
it's kind of a tell,

800
00:47:39.161 --> 00:47:42.790
but what I'll do is I will sometimes also go up to the bar and I'll say,

801
00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:46.150
just give me a tiny splash,
like,
uh,

802
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:50.500
like the equivalent amount that would be in a thimble or something like that.

803
00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:53.170
And then I'll,
then I'll cut myself off at that.

804
00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:55.270
And that's the amount that I allow myself.

805
00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.500
That's another approach that I take to cut back on,
on the,
on the booze.

806
00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:04.860
You mentioned though that you've been trying to learn at night and that the

807
00:48:05.111 --> 00:48:07.240
booze is not conducive to learning at night.

808
00:48:07.241 --> 00:48:08.680
What are you trying to learn at night?

809
00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:11.100
What types of things and what's the format?

810
00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:13.630
You reading a hundred a hundred pages a night or what does it honestly,

811
00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:17.920
have you heard of this Coursera course called learning how to learn?
I have not.

812
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:19.080
Who Teaches?
Oh,

813
00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:22.840
so it's done by a couple professors and I'm actually in the middle of that right

814
00:48:22.841 --> 00:48:27.120
now.
Um,
it was another kind of biohacker recommended it to me.
Yeah.

815
00:48:27.121 --> 00:48:30.670
Apparently it's the number one watched course on Coursera right now.

816
00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:35.170
And it's just been fascinating how they dig into the science of learning and

817
00:48:35.171 --> 00:48:36.370
like how,
um,

818
00:48:36.371 --> 00:48:40.240
you go in this kind of like focused or defused mode and how to really go in and

819
00:48:40.241 --> 00:48:44.050
concentrate on something and when the optimal time is to learn and it's all the

820
00:48:44.051 --> 00:48:48.070
science around learning.
What is that?
Oh,
sorry to interrupt.
Go ahead.

821
00:48:48.071 --> 00:48:49.830
And I'm just getting,
I'm just getting started with it.
So that's,

822
00:48:49.831 --> 00:48:52.720
that's what I've been diving into and kind of spending my nights watching those

823
00:48:52.721 --> 00:48:54.370
videos.
Um,

824
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:58.690
but it talks about the importance of actually getting away from your material.

825
00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:02.200
So like getting really focused and setting a timer for 25 minutes,

826
00:49:02.201 --> 00:49:04.580
maximum going really in depth on the,
the,

827
00:49:04.581 --> 00:49:08.440
the course material and then backing away and kind of going into this more

828
00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:12.930
relaxed mode.
Um,
they're talking about how,
uh,
was it,
um,

829
00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:14.320
Benjamin Franklin and Kimra,

830
00:49:14.321 --> 00:49:18.010
who was that used to hold a pair of keys in their hand and then Kinda in

831
00:49:18.011 --> 00:49:21.040
Salvador Dali to this as well actually hold a pair of keys in your hand.

832
00:49:21.041 --> 00:49:24.260
You kind of just go into this relaxed state thinking about,
um,

833
00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:27.580
what you want to learn and to where you almost fall asleep and when you drop the

834
00:49:27.581 --> 00:49:29.290
keys out of your hand and it wakes you up,

835
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.650
that's when you kind of go back and then you realize you were successful.

836
00:49:32.651 --> 00:49:35.920
Like getting that,
that relaxed and you'll retain and become more creative.

837
00:49:35.921 --> 00:49:37.930
And I don't know,
it's just fascinating stuff.

838
00:49:37.931 --> 00:49:42.760
And so I'm just getting started with the course.
It's free.
Very cool.
Yeah.
The,
uh,

839
00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:47.200
the intervals and the duration of intervals for learning along with break

840
00:49:47.201 --> 00:49:48.020
periods is,

841
00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:51.400
is something that I've experimented a lot with as it relates to language

842
00:49:51.401 --> 00:49:52.780
learning because it's so measurable.

843
00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:57.780
You can look at say your recall of foreign vocabulary,

844
00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:02.550
assuming you're controlling for a few different variables,
right?
So,
uh,

845
00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.350
adjectives are generally going to be harder than nouns for instance.

846
00:50:05.351 --> 00:50:08.140
But if you're controlling for that,

847
00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:10.690
you can look at what your retention is,

848
00:50:10.691 --> 00:50:15.220
say 48 hours later for a hundred words you attempted to learn in one session

849
00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:18.190
versus two sessions versus three sessions with different types of breaks.

850
00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:23.110
And I did that when I was looking at a few different languages specifically were

851
00:50:23.111 --> 00:50:25.720
2004,
2005.
Actually,
I've never shown you these notes.

852
00:50:25.721 --> 00:50:28.640
I have text edit documents

853
00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:32.720
<v 1>with all of my notes on language learning for about a year,
year long period,</v>

854
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:35.760
looking at all of this type of stuff.
And uh,

855
00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:41.920
there were some very clear patterns such as focusing on the material right

856
00:50:42.291 --> 00:50:45.150
before bed with no interruption.

857
00:50:45.151 --> 00:50:49.850
So much like how it's recommended by many names.

858
00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:53.780
Both you and I know that you meditate first thing in the morning before you

859
00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:56.750
brush your teeth,
before you check your phone before anything else.

860
00:50:56.751 --> 00:51:01.730
When you have this Tabula Rasa,
blank state of sorts,
uh,

861
00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:07.090
focusing on material that you want to consolidate and memory and recall later,

862
00:51:07.191 --> 00:51:11.900
right before bed,
uh,
at least in my experience,
dramatically improves recall.

863
00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:14.240
And then this is actually very important,
not just doing that,

864
00:51:14.241 --> 00:51:16.850
but when you wake up before doing anything else,

865
00:51:16.851 --> 00:51:19.160
which for me would override meditation,

866
00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:22.730
doing a recall exercise of some type.

867
00:51:22.731 --> 00:51:27.731
I tend to use flashcards to determine which of stuck in which have not.

868
00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:32.030
So those that have not,
since I'm looking at language,
I would usually,

869
00:51:32.031 --> 00:51:33.800
I would give myself like a quarter of a second.

870
00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:38.390
It couldn't be delayed because in speech you're not going to have the luxury of

871
00:51:38.391 --> 00:51:41.480
sitting there pause for long periods of time.

872
00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:46.370
It would go back into the rotation for review again throughout that day and

873
00:51:46.371 --> 00:51:50.300
later that night.
Uh,
but that's,
that is proven and really,
really helpful.

874
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:51.740
How about exercise?

875
00:51:51.741 --> 00:51:54.770
One of the things I mentioned in this course is this idea of doing

876
00:51:54.771 --> 00:51:56.330
cardiovascular exercise.

877
00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:59.840
I believe it's post learning something new.

878
00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:04.490
And apparently this science was saying that it just sticks.
I'm that much more,

879
00:52:04.491 --> 00:52:07.520
I don't have any numbers in front of me,
but it was,
it was something along.

880
00:52:07.521 --> 00:52:09.500
Have you heard anything about that?
Uh,
so I,

881
00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:13.440
I have in terms of a spacing or I'm sorry,
the,

882
00:52:13.441 --> 00:52:17.020
the timing of exercise.
Uh,
I,

883
00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.890
I have less clarity,

884
00:52:18.891 --> 00:52:22.410
but there's an entire book called spark that talks about the,
uh,

885
00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:23.301
among other things,

886
00:52:23.301 --> 00:52:28.301
the role of exercise in education and learning and would point to things like

887
00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:32.810
BDNF,
the release of brain drive neurotrophic factor,

888
00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:37.380
which can be elicited through different types of exercise.
And you know,

889
00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:41.540
part of me thinks that,
uh,
when one says,

890
00:52:41.541 --> 00:52:45.500
because these are the easiest to study or very often the easiest to study

891
00:52:45.501 --> 00:52:47.810
cardiovascular exercise,
uh,

892
00:52:47.811 --> 00:52:52.811
this is where it comes down to try to become literate with reading scientific

893
00:52:54.021 --> 00:52:58.910
studies or understanding how things typically work.
So as a couple of baselines,

894
00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:04.750
scientific studies usually use volunteer populations known as students.

895
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:09.950
And those students have 45 minute class blocks or 60 minute class blocks.

896
00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:13.370
So to keep those students busy,

897
00:53:13.371 --> 00:53:17.000
people are very often disincentivized from using shorter duration,

898
00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:21.560
say a high intensity training,
uh,
or or something like that.

899
00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:23.360
Weightlifting for instance,
resistance training.

900
00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:28.140
And if you want to as an experimenter,

901
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:32.070
designed something that requires as little monitoring as possible.
It's like,

902
00:53:32.071 --> 00:53:33.930
all right,
stick them on a stationary bike,
right?

903
00:53:33.931 --> 00:53:36.000
If you have people doing burpees or dead lifts,

904
00:53:36.001 --> 00:53:39.210
like you actually need to hate burpees,
you need to pay attention,
right?

905
00:53:39.211 --> 00:53:42.060
You need to pay attention if people are lifting weights and so on.

906
00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:46.110
There are more safety concerns.
So I think that just to point out,

907
00:53:46.111 --> 00:53:49.740
perhaps the obvious that weightlifting is actually one of the most

908
00:53:49.741 --> 00:53:54.240
cardiovascular activities you could possibly engage in.
Uh,

909
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:58.080
but I won't digress into that.
You can look at a book called body by science,
uh,

910
00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:00.180
for,
for all the details and why that is the case.

911
00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:04.950
But it would make sense to me that exercise could certainly play a role in

912
00:54:04.951 --> 00:54:06.180
increasing cognitive function.

913
00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:11.280
But one of the questions that I ask myself all the time,
uh,
when,

914
00:54:11.281 --> 00:54:14.490
and this is a good question for people to ask themselves when they see a

915
00:54:14.491 --> 00:54:19.491
headline that makes a scientific claim is what else could explain this?

916
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.750
Like what else might explain this?

917
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.360
So if you're looking at cardiovascular exercise,

918
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:29.390
right after some type of cramming with material,

919
00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:33.660
you could make the argument that perhaps it's not the exercise at all.

920
00:54:33.661 --> 00:54:38.661
It's the fact that they're going into a semi mindless or meditative repetition,

921
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:43.980
a repetitive period where they're,
they're able to,

922
00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:47.430
their subconscious somehow work on the material.
Right,
right.
Well,

923
00:54:47.431 --> 00:54:51.150
that's exactly what this,
this course teaches is how to get into those periods.

924
00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:53.710
Yeah.
100%.
Yeah.
So the,
uh,

925
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:59.270
I have certainly seem to observe that exercise in some capacity.

926
00:55:01.081 --> 00:55:01.381
For me,

927
00:55:01.381 --> 00:55:06.381
it's generally some type of resistance training does have a positive effect on,

928
00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:09.690
on learning.
So yet,
another reason to get off your ass,

929
00:55:09.691 --> 00:55:11.240
which is something I need to do more of.
I've,

930
00:55:11.241 --> 00:55:15.560
I've digressed a fallen off the train a little bit,
Kevin Rose,
I'll be honest.
Uh,

931
00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:20.190
but I shall get back on the train.
Uh,
yeah.

932
00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:23.580
So fortunately,
you know,
once you have a recipe that works,

933
00:55:23.581 --> 00:55:27.510
you have the confidence that you can get back on that.
That's the good news,

934
00:55:27.511 --> 00:55:30.230
right?
With say the fast mimicking diet,

935
00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:32.010
not that you should use that for body composition,

936
00:55:32.011 --> 00:55:34.560
but fast mimicking diet or intermittent fasting,

937
00:55:34.561 --> 00:55:39.561
which a lot of people use your app euro for a or a slow carb diet plus a handful

938
00:55:39.661 --> 00:55:40.950
of things like kettle bell swings.

939
00:55:40.951 --> 00:55:45.210
I just know this is why I'm not stressed out about being off the rails.

940
00:55:45.211 --> 00:55:49.170
I kind of make,
make fun of myself about it.
Uh,
because it's like,
look,

941
00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.750
if if I just follow the prescription,

942
00:55:51.751 --> 00:55:55.440
like follow the algorithm for three to four weeks,
there's no magic involved.

943
00:55:56.150 --> 00:56:00.810
Yeah.
It will work and I will have less like muffin top to grab one.

944
00:56:00.811 --> 00:56:02.910
I'm in the sauna,
which will be,
which will make me happy.

945
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:08.270
Muffin top of the sun is the word you that little layered as little.

946
00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:10.760
Yeah.
Well you also have like the,

947
00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:13.820
the glistening Cinnabon effect because you're sweating.
It's,

948
00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:16.410
it's a really unattractive look.
It's not a good look.

949
00:56:18.930 --> 00:56:20.190
One thing I did want to talk about it,

950
00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:23.050
which I think would be fun to chat about because we both done it.
Um,

951
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.250
real quick is the,
uh,

952
00:56:24.290 --> 00:56:28.930
<v 0>is Tony Robbins.
Yeah,
yeah.
Let's talk about it for sure.
So you recently had,</v>

953
00:56:28.931 --> 00:56:33.220
I've done two different Tony robins events,
a UPW unleash the power within,

954
00:56:33.221 --> 00:56:38.221
which was my first event and then more recently in December of this last year

955
00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:41.590
date with destiny,
which is a longer event.
Oh,
you did?
That?
I didn't know you did.

956
00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:45.760
They would designate.
Did I did.
So I've done two events and,

957
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:49.840
uh,
some people have had a bit of exposure to date with destiny through the,

958
00:56:49.841 --> 00:56:52.930
I am not your guru documentary,
which,
uh,
was,

959
00:56:52.931 --> 00:56:55.540
was coproduced in fact by someone who's been on this podcast.

960
00:56:55.541 --> 00:56:57.640
Brian Koppelman really accomplished filmmaker.

961
00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:01.810
But what was your experience like first Tony Robbins event?
Yeah,
I mean,

962
00:57:01.811 --> 00:57:05.090
it was kind of crazy.
I,
I've,
um,
thanks to you,
uh,

963
00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:07.870
I got hooked up with him and,
uh,

964
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:13.190
and went down and got a chance to meet him and hang out with them.
Um,

965
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:17.650
I,
you know,
I think that Tony is this,
this kind of,

966
00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:18.820
um,

967
00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:21.550
he's proven himself now that he's been doing this for so long and he's doing it

968
00:57:21.551 --> 00:57:25.750
for 40 plus years.
But I think that in,
in the back of my mind,

969
00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:30.520
I kind of remember when I was a little kid,
the kind of like audio tape version,

970
00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:32.470
infomercial version of Tony,
you know,

971
00:57:32.471 --> 00:57:35.770
so there's always this stigma in my mind that was like,
oh,

972
00:57:35.771 --> 00:57:38.890
is he trying to sell me something?
What's going on here?
You know,

973
00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:41.770
and I will also watch this documentary.
And I was like,
wow,

974
00:57:41.771 --> 00:57:43.370
this guy's clearly brilliant ease.

975
00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:46.390
It takes this stuff very seriously and he's truly breaking through to people and

976
00:57:46.391 --> 00:57:48.730
helping people change their lives.
And so it was like,
Hey,

977
00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:51.280
I want to be in the bay area.
You know,
you should come down.
And I was like,
okay,

978
00:57:51.281 --> 00:57:56.080
that sounds awesome.
It took a buddy of mine,
um,
that,
uh,

979
00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:59.860
it has a lot of anxiety and he shall go unnamed buddy.

980
00:57:59.861 --> 00:58:02.200
He wanted to go and he was like,
Kevin,
let's do this.
And I was like,
okay,

981
00:58:02.201 --> 00:58:03.550
let's do it.
Um,

982
00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:07.570
so went down for the three day event and I thought it was great.

983
00:58:07.690 --> 00:58:12.190
I got to tell you,
it's,
you walk into it and I was in an arena where there was,

984
00:58:12.191 --> 00:58:13.750
you know,
12,000 people.

985
00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:18.550
And so there is a lot of people there and everybody is coming there for a

986
00:58:18.551 --> 00:58:19.600
different reason.
Right?

987
00:58:19.601 --> 00:58:24.601
So I was sitting across from a guy that had lost his legs and was a previously a

988
00:58:25.151 --> 00:58:27.030
drug addict and I think he had some infection,

989
00:58:27.050 --> 00:58:29.850
his legs or something had to happen both amputated.
Um,

990
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:33.040
I was sitting next to someone that she was running her own social media business

991
00:58:33.041 --> 00:58:34.900
and just wanted to like,
uh,
you know,

992
00:58:34.901 --> 00:58:38.980
get better with our business and improve her finances.
And um,

993
00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:42.370
she was getting through a relationship that she had just ended and you know,

994
00:58:42.371 --> 00:58:44.650
so everyone had something to kind of come in and bring to the table.

995
00:58:44.651 --> 00:58:46.570
Of course we all do.
If we're honest with ourselves,

996
00:58:46.571 --> 00:58:50.510
everyone has the one that something that are trying to work on.
And so,
you know,

997
00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:53.380
I went in there and day one was awesome.
I mean,

998
00:58:53.381 --> 00:58:57.340
Tony got out there and he spoke for like,
uh,
I dunno,
12 hours.

999
00:58:57.370 --> 00:59:01.780
We were there until nine complete mutant.
Yeah.
It's,
it's unbelievable.

1000
00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:03.350
I don't even know when he pees.
Yeah.

1001
00:59:03.410 --> 00:59:07.300
I have no idea when it uses the bathroom or drinks water.
Yeah.
Just,
yeah,

1002
00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:11.380
it's just a machine.
The guys.
Um,
but uh,
you know,

1003
00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:15.140
I walked over the coals,
I'm with him and he,

1004
00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:17.440
he was like bring out some fresh Kohl's for Kevin.

1005
00:59:17.441 --> 00:59:19.870
And of course they put like fresh that you,
he walk,

1006
00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:23.310
you actually walk over coals the end of the night.
You've done this right?
I have,

1007
00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:25.340
yeah.
Did he bring out fresh goals for you?

1008
00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:28.490
I can't recall if he brought up fresh goals for me.

1009
00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:31.310
I think that might've been the,
the VIP treatment that you received.

1010
00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:36.540
It was a lot of fun and I think that the biggest takeaway for me was really,

1011
00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:40.180
um,
um,
a couple things.
Uh,

1012
00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:44.420
one was definitely this thing called the wheel of life.
Did you have to do that?

1013
00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:48.470
You feel like your wheel?
I'm sure I did.
I'm sure I did.

1014
00:59:49.450 --> 00:59:53.960
I should also point out that for the attendees at these events,

1015
00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:56.000
and I have a little bit more to say about this,

1016
00:59:56.001 --> 01:00:00.570
but the exercises that really,
and they,
they,

1017
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:03.410
there are a very tactical prescriptive exercises,

1018
01:00:03.411 --> 01:00:08.411
but that the exercises that change someone else's trajectory and give them

1019
01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:13.840
extremely concrete next steps that have an impact are very often completely

1020
01:00:14.391 --> 01:00:17.690
different exercises from those that affect the person right next to you.

1021
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:23.150
It's really something to behold,
but tell us about the,
the wheel of life.

1022
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:24.021
Yeah.

1023
01:00:24.021 --> 01:00:29.021
So the wheel of life was interesting in that basically he gives you these areas

1024
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:32.700
of your life and your to rank them,
um,

1025
01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:37.720
from zero to 10 on how far along and how kind of just happy you are with those

1026
01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:43.010
that,
those areas.
So for example,
a physical body,
right?
So for me I was like,

1027
01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:45.830
I got to give myself a four in this arena can be doing a lot better.

1028
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:48.410
And then there's emotions and meaning.

1029
01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:51.110
Another one is relationships and other one is time.

1030
01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:54.890
Another one is your career and your mission in life.
Um,

1031
01:00:54.891 --> 01:00:59.210
and then there's finances.
And then the last one,
um,
is how you contribute,

1032
01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:03.860
like how you give back,
how you celebrate and contribute.
And so you go from,

1033
01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:07.880
from kind of zero to 10 and you ranked these out and you'll see my wheel doesn't

1034
01:01:07.881 --> 01:01:12.600
actually look like a wheel.
It's like a kind of lopsided.
But that's by design.

1035
01:01:12.610 --> 01:01:15.560
That's by design.
By the time you,
you look at this,

1036
01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:18.050
it gives you a clear view of like,
okay,

1037
01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:21.470
I really need to step out how I contribute and give back.

1038
01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:25.640
And so that allowed me to go really deep in my own personal life and,
and say,

1039
01:01:25.641 --> 01:01:29.270
what does it mean to contribute and give back for me?
And like,
you know,

1040
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:32.720
you and I have both done,
um,
things in,

1041
01:01:32.721 --> 01:01:35.240
in terms of like going out and,
uh,
you know,

1042
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:39.290
charity water or the Tony Hawk Foundation and giving away money.
But like,

1043
01:01:39.291 --> 01:01:43.250
just supporting a cause and,
and writing a check.

1044
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:45.470
I don't know how you feel about this,

1045
01:01:45.471 --> 01:01:50.360
but for me it doesn't really mean it mean that I'm giving back.

1046
01:01:50.361 --> 01:01:53.420
I don't really feel like I'm contributing.
Yes,
I'm giving like cash,

1047
01:01:53.421 --> 01:01:56.930
but I'm not actually taking part in that process.

1048
01:01:56.990 --> 01:02:01.130
I'm not actually really helping out like anyone can write a check.
Um,

1049
01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.080
so what does it mean for me to contribute?

1050
01:02:03.081 --> 01:02:04.640
And the thing and the realization that I came to,

1051
01:02:04.641 --> 01:02:08.540
and actually there's some really powerful moments in this,

1052
01:02:08.541 --> 01:02:11.720
this conference where they turn out the lights and they like make you revisit

1053
01:02:11.721 --> 01:02:14.350
like certain times in your childhood and all these things.
And you know,

1054
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:18.200
I felt myself kind of tearing up because one of the things I realized that I was

1055
01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:21.420
not giving back and in contributing in a meaningful way.

1056
01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:26.450
And the thing that I came to him that I realized is that my mother was verbally

1057
01:02:27.481 --> 01:02:31.590
abused by my father for many,
many,
many years.
And um,
you know,

1058
01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:36.080
definitely abusive behavior.
I'm never physically harmed or,
but you know,

1059
01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:39.780
I would say that the mental harm was,
is,
is bad or if not worse than,

1060
01:02:39.810 --> 01:02:42.700
than some of the physical harm.
And,
and,
um,

1061
01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:46.920
I realized that I want to actually lean in and help out women that have been

1062
01:02:46.921 --> 01:02:49.890
abused and that are in currently in abusive relationships.

1063
01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:54.900
And so a goal of mine over the next couple of years is finding the best possible

1064
01:02:54.901 --> 01:02:58.110
way to contribute back to that.
Not just informs of another check,

1065
01:02:58.111 --> 01:03:00.930
but actually how I can get involved and what that means.

1066
01:03:00.931 --> 01:03:04.800
Helping them build their products and build a better website or mobile apps or

1067
01:03:04.801 --> 01:03:09.690
any way that I can enable and use my technology skills to help with their

1068
01:03:09.691 --> 01:03:12.900
business,
I think would be something that would mean a lot to me.
So that was,

1069
01:03:12.901 --> 01:03:15.930
that was a great experience to have and I wouldn't have that if it wasn't for

1070
01:03:15.931 --> 01:03:19.470
Tony and I and,
and that was just one of many things I got out of the weekend.

1071
01:03:19.471 --> 01:03:23.700
So I would say that,
you know,
he's,
he's a bad ass.
It was,
it was pretty awesome.

1072
01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:27.930
<v 1>Yeah.
He's a real master of his craft.</v>

1073
01:03:27.931 --> 01:03:32.931
And what I would say to folks who have a certain image of Tony is that when you

1074
01:03:34.261 --> 01:03:35.880
go to an event like this,

1075
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.760
I think the right away to approach it is to be skeptical,

1076
01:03:41.761 --> 01:03:46.761
but not cynical and open to trying all of the exercises he suggests and that

1077
01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:54.780
they're going to be components that may not agree with you in the sense that

1078
01:03:54.781 --> 01:03:57.540
there's a lot of jumping around.
There's a lot of music,

1079
01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:01.860
there's a lot of noise,
for lack of a better word,

1080
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:05.850
and a lot of those elements made me uncomfortable.

1081
01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.430
They're not things that I would seek out.
Oh my God,

1082
01:04:08.431 --> 01:04:12.240
I could not see you dancing and jumping around.
Right,
right.

1083
01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:14.700
It's just not my thing.
So,

1084
01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:19.980
but the filter that I used going into it,

1085
01:04:19.981 --> 01:04:21.870
or the lens through which I was looking at it was,

1086
01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.050
it was made easier because one of my,

1087
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:27.510
one of my very close friends I've known since college,

1088
01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:30.570
who's had multiple company exits,
is extremely,

1089
01:04:30.571 --> 01:04:35.220
extremely accomplished and he goes to unleash the power within every year as a

1090
01:04:35.221 --> 01:04:37.440
reset.
He's been 11 times,
maybe 12 now.

1091
01:04:37.441 --> 01:04:40.050
He's been to date with destiny six times and this,

1092
01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.390
and this guy is not a seminar junkie.

1093
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:47.630
He's not someone who avoids the work and goes to listen to a motivational speech

1094
01:04:48.841 --> 01:04:52.950
so that he can feel better on a sugar high for two days and not take any next

1095
01:04:52.951 --> 01:04:55.680
steps.
Like this is not that guy.
He is an operator.

1096
01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:59.400
So the fact that he had been so many times,
uh,

1097
01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:04.640
really led me to want to stick with the entire event and I'm not going to lie.

1098
01:05:04.771 --> 01:05:08.250
I had hard points and then I mentioned this to you and it may not be the

1099
01:05:08.251 --> 01:05:10.530
exercise that had a,
a large impact on you,

1100
01:05:10.531 --> 01:05:15.430
but the dickens process that I ended up along with Tony,
uh,

1101
01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:19.930
including in tools of titans,
one of my more recent books,

1102
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:21.310
because it had such a big impact,

1103
01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:25.060
made the entire event and easy.

1104
01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:29.410
I tend to 100 x return for me,
that was the last day too.
That's right.

1105
01:05:29.411 --> 01:05:34.411
So just that 30 to 60 minute exercise led me to dramatically improve my

1106
01:05:35.141 --> 01:05:36.700
relationship with my father,

1107
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:40.750
to take responsibility for certain things that I had been telling myself were

1108
01:05:40.751 --> 01:05:41.770
unchangeable,

1109
01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:47.100
to really buckle down and step into discomfort,

1110
01:05:47.561 --> 01:05:52.490
to make some meaningful changes.
And it ended the,
those are changes,
uh,

1111
01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:54.490
at least the power within.

1112
01:05:54.491 --> 01:05:59.491
I want to say I went to now it's gotta be three to five years ago.

1113
01:06:00.330 --> 01:06:01.660
Uh,
those changes,

1114
01:06:01.661 --> 01:06:06.661
the ripple effects of those changes that I made then are still very tangible now

1115
01:06:06.970 --> 01:06:09.280
and then date with destiny.
Very similar,

1116
01:06:09.281 --> 01:06:14.281
but to go into it expecting that if you step into it and accept some level of

1117
01:06:16.601 --> 01:06:19.480
discomfort and commit to trying everything,

1118
01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:23.350
this is just my view that at least 50%,

1119
01:06:23.410 --> 01:06:26.630
you're going to end up discarding probably 20%.

1120
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:29.380
You're going to find really uncomfortable and you're going to dislike actively.

1121
01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:34.060
And then I tend to 25%,
you're gonna go,
Holy Shit.

1122
01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:38.350
I can't believe how powerful that just was.
And it's not a lot of hand wavy,

1123
01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:42.700
woowoo ambiguity.
These exercises are really,
really,
really specific.

1124
01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:46.630
So you don't have to accept Tony as your one and only savior.

1125
01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:49.840
You don't have to believe that he is flawless because he is not.

1126
01:06:49.841 --> 01:06:51.760
He's just like everyone else.

1127
01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:55.960
He's a imperfect creature trying to do the best with the gifts and talents he's

1128
01:06:55.961 --> 01:07:00.070
developed.
Uh,
but the guy knows his shit and he actually,

1129
01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:03.850
he actually really cares.
And as I've gotten to know him over the last few years,

1130
01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:08.110
more and more so I've become more impressed with him,
not less impressed.

1131
01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.350
Uh,
and I,

1132
01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:13.840
that is at least if one were thinking of let's say,

1133
01:07:13.841 --> 01:07:15.250
attending one of these events and I have no,

1134
01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:19.470
I've zero vested interest and sending anyone to these events other than they,

1135
01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.750
they've had a material impact on my life.
That's why I was,

1136
01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:26.470
I was happy to see that you're going to attend,
uh,

1137
01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:32.070
that they go in with an open mind expecting that much like if you read any type

1138
01:07:32.981 --> 01:07:37.840
of book,
you're not expecting every line to be a life changing piece of gold.

1139
01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.480
You're hoping that net net,

1140
01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:44.620
it's going to be worth the time that you invested.
Yeah.
Right.

1141
01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:48.490
Yeah.
That's been my takeaway that it's absolutely been worth the time invested.

1142
01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:50.950
Yeah,
100% agree.
And I think that,

1143
01:07:50.951 --> 01:07:55.951
I'm like you going into this was a certainly a really uncomfortable thing for me

1144
01:07:57.881 --> 01:08:02.881
in terms of when they first start the music and people come out on stage and

1145
01:08:03.461 --> 01:08:06.370
they started dancing and like you can tell the people that have been there

1146
01:08:06.371 --> 01:08:09.640
before because they immediately like jump out of their seeds and like start like

1147
01:08:09.641 --> 01:08:11.320
kind of rocking out and throwing their hands in the air.

1148
01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:16.130
And I'm thinking to myself,
I hate dancing,
hate dancing.

1149
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:19.190
<v 0>I've never liked dancing with anyone,
my wife or anyone.</v>

1150
01:08:19.191 --> 01:08:21.800
I always feel so awkward when I'm doing it.
You know,

1151
01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:25.370
like I'm like a geek that likes to sit in front of my computer at night.

1152
01:08:25.730 --> 01:08:26.840
And so it's like,

1153
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:30.320
did I though it's something that another friend had told me that had gone and

1154
01:08:30.321 --> 01:08:33.470
said,
Hey Kevin,
like you just have to go with it.

1155
01:08:33.471 --> 01:08:35.180
Like if you want to get anything out of it,

1156
01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:39.440
you have to realize that he's doing this by designed to put you into a certain

1157
01:08:39.441 --> 01:08:43.310
state.
Right.
He wants to get to get you in the,
into an optimal state.

1158
01:08:43.311 --> 01:08:46.630
And the optimal that can mean like,
like wanting,
one example of,

1159
01:08:46.631 --> 01:08:51.290
of one thing that we did is we took something that was very serious to us,

1160
01:08:51.291 --> 01:08:54.350
like something like a limiting belief that you had held so seriously.

1161
01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:58.790
And you say it out loud in a very joking and like laughing way and everybody,

1162
01:08:58.791 --> 01:09:01.820
like 12,000 people are all doing this at the same time and you're like laughing

1163
01:09:01.821 --> 01:09:05.540
and saying it and it's kind of like breaking it down in your,

1164
01:09:05.690 --> 01:09:09.140
in your mind and letting you know that you don't have to take it so seriously

1165
01:09:09.141 --> 01:09:13.130
and you can joke about it and have fun with it because it's been forever since,

1166
01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:16.680
since,
um,
you know,
you've probably ever done that in your life.
Like you've the,

1167
01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:19.070
when was the last time you were to able to take something that you held so

1168
01:09:19.071 --> 01:09:22.820
seriously and so guarded and,
and have a good time with it.

1169
01:09:22.821 --> 01:09:25.700
And so he knows how to set up these little traps for you,
that,

1170
01:09:25.701 --> 01:09:28.610
that trick you into reframing things in your mind.

1171
01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:32.630
And it really does change your longterm perspective on things.

1172
01:09:32.631 --> 01:09:36.440
And Yeah,
I,
I'm doing,
I'm a fan.
I would definitely go back again.

1173
01:09:36.441 --> 01:09:40.430
I did the three day event,
the unleash the power within the same one as you.
Um,

1174
01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:43.580
but yeah,
I had had fun with it,
so,
so thanks for helping out with that.

1175
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.740
<v 1>Yeah,
man.
My pleasure.
I,</v>

1176
01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:51.770
I would suggest also that,
uh,

1177
01:09:51.771 --> 01:09:52.070
that's,

1178
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:56.030
that's Molly saying hello in the background for those people who can hear my dog

1179
01:09:56.031 --> 01:10:00.110
barking.
But that
is as a,

1180
01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:04.970
as a point of social proof.
And of course Tony is fully aware of,

1181
01:10:04.971 --> 01:10:09.500
of the sort of gravitas would bring,
but there are people,
for instance,

1182
01:10:09.501 --> 01:10:11.690
Mark Benioff of salesforce,

1183
01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:16.590
which I think has more than 10 billion in annual revenue.
Now,
uh,

1184
01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:21.470
who will point blank say that salesforce would probably not exist were it not

1185
01:10:21.471 --> 01:10:25.190
for Tony Robbins and still attends some of these events.
Uh,

1186
01:10:25.191 --> 01:10:29.950
he was right behind me at date with destiny.
I crazy.
Uh,
he's a big guy.
He's,

1187
01:10:29.970 --> 01:10:33.260
he,
he and Tony,
uh,
are,
are,
are very similar in size.

1188
01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:35.960
And then you have Paul Tudor Jones.

1189
01:10:35.961 --> 01:10:40.961
You have some of the most sophisticated traders and financial minds who have

1190
01:10:41.661 --> 01:10:43.730
worked with Tony for 10 to 20 years.

1191
01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:49.180
And that's on an ongoing coaching basis because he does have very discreet,

1192
01:10:51.711 --> 01:10:53.920
very tactical,
uh,

1193
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:59.290
exercises and tools that help you to find blind spots and fully leveraged things

1194
01:10:59.721 --> 01:11:04.340
that you're good at and so on.
So it's,
uh,
it's not easy.

1195
01:11:04.341 --> 01:11:08.000
It's not comfortable.
But,
uh,
certainly I've been,

1196
01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:09.860
I've been very,
uh,

1197
01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:13.070
benefited by the time that I've spent considering these things.

1198
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:15.200
I'm biased because,
uh,

1199
01:11:15.370 --> 01:11:19.890
in high school I read unlimited power by Tony,
which had an impact.

1200
01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:25.010
I then when I got out of college and had my first job and I was commuting in my

1201
01:11:25.411 --> 01:11:28.080
piece of shit minivan,
this the green machine,

1202
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:31.800
which was just I aid to complete disaster of car,

1203
01:11:31.801 --> 01:11:35.640
but I was trapped on one oh one in the bay area for people who know,

1204
01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:40.670
just bumper to bumper in rush hour to and from a mountain viewed as to San Jose

1205
01:11:40.741 --> 01:11:43.920
to work.
And I would listen to this used set.

1206
01:11:43.921 --> 01:11:47.520
I couldn't afford the full set a new copies.
So I had personal power too.

1207
01:11:47.521 --> 01:11:51.150
And cassette tape and listen to that,

1208
01:11:51.151 --> 01:11:55.460
which helped get me to the point where I started my first company.
And uh,

1209
01:11:55.470 --> 01:12:00.470
so Tony's made these appearances at very opportune moments in my life and you

1210
01:12:01.741 --> 01:12:05.400
know,
he's,
he's not,
he,
like I said,
I don't go to him for all things.

1211
01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:10.320
I don't think Tony as the answer to everything but with particular types of

1212
01:12:10.321 --> 01:12:15.321
selfimposed narratives and handicaps that you have built yourself or walls

1213
01:12:16.051 --> 01:12:20.370
around certain types of thinking or certain types of emotions that perhaps

1214
01:12:20.371 --> 01:12:22.590
served you very well in the past but no longer serve you.

1215
01:12:22.591 --> 01:12:27.330
He is exceptionally good at helping you work through all of that.
Yeah,

1216
01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:29.820
I just love that this whole genre,

1217
01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:33.840
like the self help genre is becoming like it,
it's not,

1218
01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:37.260
is frowned upon is it used to be like,
I don't know if you remember,

1219
01:12:37.261 --> 01:12:41.760
but probably you know 10 1520 years ago like if you went to that area of like

1220
01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:46.110
the bookstore,
you were like,
oh look at it.
Like who's in the self help section?

1221
01:12:46.111 --> 01:12:49.080
Like,
they must,
there must be something wrong with them and now,

1222
01:12:49.150 --> 01:12:50.400
now don't seriously,

1223
01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:54.900
they used to be the case and now it's like it's gone and he's probably at the

1224
01:12:54.901 --> 01:12:58.640
center of it.
But it's become this idea of not settling self help is,

1225
01:12:58.641 --> 01:13:02.610
is really is just like this idea that we're all on a journey of lifelong

1226
01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:07.410
learning and we all are done be asking ourselves and there's not a single person

1227
01:13:07.411 --> 01:13:08.820
that has all of life figured out.

1228
01:13:08.821 --> 01:13:13.110
So why don't we all actively openly work on this together and I think it's

1229
01:13:13.111 --> 01:13:17.460
awesome.
Yeah.
And I should also say that at one point,
as an example,

1230
01:13:17.461 --> 01:13:22.260
I was interviewed on the BBC and uh,
they wanted to talk about self,

1231
01:13:22.261 --> 01:13:26.450
this self help genre and I knew it was going to be a setup,
right?
I,

1232
01:13:26.451 --> 01:13:31.080
I knew that they wanted me to defend self help and they wanted to attack self

1233
01:13:31.081 --> 01:13:34.360
help,
right?
So and I knew this going in that this is what it was going to be.

1234
01:13:34.361 --> 01:13:37.050
Or I figured it out about an hour beforehand when I got some notes and I was

1235
01:13:37.051 --> 01:13:41.670
like,
oh,
I see where this is going.
So they,

1236
01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:46.650
they bring me out.
This is,
this is a television show and they say,

1237
01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:50.430
good evening,
Mr Ferris,
we just wanted to talk about Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
bio,
bio,

1238
01:13:50.431 --> 01:13:51.264
blah blah blah.

1239
01:13:51.330 --> 01:13:54.900
What is your general opinion of the self help genre or something along those

1240
01:13:54.901 --> 01:13:57.540
lines?
And in effect I said,

1241
01:13:57.570 --> 01:14:01.170
I think 99.9% of it is just horse shit.
And I said,
it's,

1242
01:14:01.171 --> 01:14:06.110
it pains me sometimes to be associated with the label self help,
uh,

1243
01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:09.210
for x,
Y and z reasons.
And then the,
they didn't have a leg to stand on,
right?

1244
01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:10.800
Because I'd taken their side of the argument,

1245
01:14:10.801 --> 01:14:14.020
which kind of hilarious and a and then I said,

1246
01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:19.050
but at the same time I think the label self help has in many cases and unfairly

1247
01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:25.840
negative connotation because a,

1248
01:14:25.841 --> 01:14:27.580
if you look at almost any type of reading,

1249
01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:31.600
whether it's a novel where people want to escape or it's nonfiction,

1250
01:14:31.601 --> 01:14:33.130
where they're hoping to learn more about,

1251
01:14:33.850 --> 01:14:38.530
let's just call it Andrew Carnegie or you name the figure there is,

1252
01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:42.490
there is some motive behind that that they hope to help them.

1253
01:14:42.490 --> 01:14:44.050
Whether it's a shift of emotion,

1254
01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:47.170
the gathering of knowledge they can impress people at a dinner party or

1255
01:14:47.171 --> 01:14:48.004
otherwise.

1256
01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:53.370
And that if I were to look at who I would say potentially emulate in the world

1257
01:14:54.551 --> 01:14:57.310
of self help,
it would probably be be someone like,

1258
01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:00.310
this is a name you brought up earlier,
Ben Franklin,
Ryan,

1259
01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:02.710
who most certainly uh,

1260
01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:07.000
wrote extensively about what we would consider today self help.

1261
01:15:07.001 --> 01:15:12.001
But he's not lumped into the category of say potential.

1262
01:15:12.521 --> 01:15:13.750
And these people do exist,

1263
01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:18.870
certainly charlatans who are just selling a bill of goods that doesn't deliver

1264
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:19.181
right.

1265
01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:24.181
There are plenty of people who have not walked the walk and talk extensively

1266
01:15:24.641 --> 01:15:27.700
about their expertise and make recommendations and prescriptions.

1267
01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:32.970
There are people all over the world in every possible discipline who do this.

1268
01:15:35.290 --> 01:15:38.470
And a lot of them tend to concentrate in this section of the bookstore called

1269
01:15:38.471 --> 01:15:41.620
self help,
unfortunately.
But it's,

1270
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:45.280
it's that alone isn't enough to disqualify something.

1271
01:15:45.281 --> 01:15:48.310
And certainly if we look at these,

1272
01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:51.550
the popularity of tutorials on Youtube for instance,

1273
01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:54.070
of any possible subject matter,

1274
01:15:54.370 --> 01:15:58.300
if you look at the popularity of the creative lives in the Coursera is and so
on,

1275
01:15:58.510 --> 01:15:59.430
sure.
Uh,

1276
01:15:59.470 --> 01:16:04.470
everyone now has access to expertise that even 10 years ago would have cost

1277
01:16:06.210 --> 01:16:10.390
hundreds of thousands of dollars to access if they had the ability at all.

1278
01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:15.020
You look at say,
Harvard,
Mit,
Stanford,
many of these schools that are putting,
uh,

1279
01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:19.030
their courses online in some cases for free access.

1280
01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:21.880
And I know people who have taught themselves to code in this way.

1281
01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:26.240
All of that is self help,
right?
Yeah.
So it's,

1282
01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:31.270
it's important I think that people not a disqualify exploring certain realms

1283
01:16:33.490 --> 01:16:38.490
because of a label that really represents a concept which may or may not apply

1284
01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:41.050
to what it is you're examining.
Yeah.
I mean,

1285
01:16:41.051 --> 01:16:44.410
there's going to be scammers in every genre too.
Yeah.
I love it.
I love how you,

1286
01:16:44.411 --> 01:16:46.690
Joe Rogan,
I don't know if you've seen these boats that he's done recently,

1287
01:16:46.691 --> 01:16:50.170
but he does videos of these martial,
the legitimate fuck.
Yeah,

1288
01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:56.350
yeah,
yeah.
Joe Rogan puts up these fake martial arts videos.
I mean,

1289
01:16:56.351 --> 01:16:56.920
they're not fake.

1290
01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:00.070
They're videos of people who actually believe that what's happening is
happening.

1291
01:17:00.370 --> 01:17:02.770
But yeah,
these,
these like martial arts masters,

1292
01:17:02.771 --> 01:17:07.480
self-described throwing people across the room with their ci explosions and so

1293
01:17:07.481 --> 01:17:07.870
on,

1294
01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:12.870
and his caption usually legit as fuck or Hashtag that shit is fucking good.

1295
01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:17.520
Yeah,
there's a lot of nonsense out there.
But,
uh,

1296
01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:20.780
it doesn't mean that everything within a certain category is nonsense.

1297
01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:25.400
And it doesn't mean you should spend your entire life filtering for the 1%.

1298
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:29.030
But also there are ways that you can assess the validity of different paths.

1299
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:33.020
And quite frankly,
I would recommend for those people who haven't,
well,

1300
01:17:33.021 --> 01:17:34.040
I'll give you two recommendations.

1301
01:17:34.041 --> 01:17:37.370
So one is you can look at the back of the four hour body if you already have it.

1302
01:17:37.371 --> 01:17:38.420
There's an appendix,

1303
01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:44.020
which is effectively how to spot bad science and it will help you to not trick

1304
01:17:44.391 --> 01:17:48.950
yourself and also to get better at,
uh,
avoiding being tricked.

1305
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:52.040
Uh,
so that's,
that's one recommendation.
And,

1306
01:17:52.041 --> 01:17:55.040
and not to seem like I'm selling my own book,

1307
01:17:55.070 --> 01:18:00.070
the excerpts for that appendix are from a book called bad science by a doctor

1308
01:18:00.411 --> 01:18:03.170
named Ben Goldacre,
which is absolutely fantastic.

1309
01:18:03.171 --> 01:18:07.400
So if you just want to be literate and better able,

1310
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:08.540
scientifically literate,

1311
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:12.530
or better able to separate the signal from the noise with the delusion of

1312
01:18:12.531 --> 01:18:15.560
information that we are assaulted by every day,

1313
01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:19.010
I would highly recommend that you check out one or two,

1314
01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:23.240
one or both of those resources.
You know,
I was going to ask you,
um,

1315
01:18:23.570 --> 01:18:24.920
tools of titans.
I mean,

1316
01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:29.360
obviously in your books there have been tons of book recommendations.
Yeah.

1317
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:34.070
And there was that one kid.
Do you remember the kid that took all and he,

1318
01:18:34.071 --> 01:18:38.750
he'd created out all the books out of your recommendations have been random,
uh,

1319
01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:42.480
Yay.
Ranked him or just organize them as thumbnails.
Yeah,
I do remember that.
Yeah.

1320
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:47.360
So the idea was that what is the most recommended book inside tool tools of

1321
01:18:47.361 --> 01:18:50.810
titans across the board?
Yeah.
All the people that were,

1322
01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:54.230
that were in that book and it kind of stack ranking them based on the votes.

1323
01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:56.060
Do you have that list anywhere?

1324
01:18:56.061 --> 01:18:59.270
Do you have a list of like the most recommended books by all of your guests?

1325
01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:01.220
Yeah,
I do actually.
And I'll pull it,

1326
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:04.680
I'll pull it up right now because I put it off.
I put it on the blog for,

1327
01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:07.880
for everybody.
It's a great way.
Yeah,
I put it up,

1328
01:19:07.890 --> 01:19:09.830
but that's a great way to cut through all the crap,
you know.
Yeah.

1329
01:19:09.831 --> 01:19:14.780
I put it up on the blog and if you give me a second,
I will find where it is.

1330
01:19:15.010 --> 01:19:18.920
Uh,
this might take a second.
So I'm looking at tribe of mentors,
the most recent,

1331
01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:23.960
uh,
but the one,
where would I find this?

1332
01:19:24.230 --> 01:19:29.230
If you go onto tim.blog and search like tools of titans books,

1333
01:19:29.690 --> 01:19:32.000
we can put a link in the show notes,
right?
Put a link in the show notes.

1334
01:19:32.001 --> 01:19:34.700
So if you want a link,
this will be the smarter way to do it.

1335
01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:40.120
If you want to see a page where the most commonly recommended books from tools

1336
01:19:40.311 --> 01:19:43.250
of titans and from tribe of mentors combined,

1337
01:19:43.251 --> 01:19:47.030
you're looking at about 500 different world class performers of all different

1338
01:19:47.031 --> 01:19:47.864
disciplines,

1339
01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:53.140
ranging from top professional athletes to chess prodigies to former generals,

1340
01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:57.550
uh,
certainly 12 plus billionaires.
Uh,

1341
01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:01.940
then you will get to see rank ordered in terms of frequency,

1342
01:20:01.941 --> 01:20:03.740
which books are most recommended.

1343
01:20:03.741 --> 01:20:07.380
So I will put those in the show notes and you guys can find that at Tim dot.

1344
01:20:07.381 --> 01:20:12.381
Blog slash podcast if you want to see of these people who are the best at what

1345
01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:15.870
they do,
which books across disciplines do they recommend?
Most often?

1346
01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:19.530
A few of them just off the bat for people who are curious,
uh,

1347
01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:21.930
man's search for meaning by Viktor Frankl,

1348
01:20:22.450 --> 01:20:27.450
a poor Charlie's Almanack by Charlie monger seeking wisdom by Peter beveling.

1349
01:20:28.530 --> 01:20:32.310
Uh,
and,
uh,
certainly atlas shrugged,

1350
01:20:32.311 --> 01:20:33.660
even though it's a controversial book,

1351
01:20:33.690 --> 01:20:38.690
but I in rand comes up a lot in terms of developing a sense of personal agency.

1352
01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:43.170
I think that has popped up quite a lot and many more.
But I'll,

1353
01:20:43.171 --> 01:20:47.820
I'll give you the full list because there are some that pop up quite frequently,

1354
01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:53.040
uh,
that you won't recognize it all.
And those are to me oftentimes the,

1355
01:20:53.041 --> 01:20:54.780
the,
the really fun ones to explore.

1356
01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:57.890
<v 0>Awesome.
Yeah,
I've got a bunch of audible credits waiting to be spent,</v>

you know,
Twitter at [inaudible].
Kevin Rose,
but like,</v>

1367
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:40.410
I don't know that I use it that much anymore.
I'm more newsletter guy.

1368
01:21:40.411 --> 01:21:42.390
If you go to my website,
if you sign up for my newsletter,

1369
01:21:42.391 --> 01:21:45.840
I do a once a month newsletter and that's,
that's kind of what I use.

1370
01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:49.140
<v 1>It's a good newsletter.
I subscribe to it,
which I can't say for many.
And yeah,</v>

1371
01:21:49.141 --> 01:21:53.490
Twitter's,
Twitter's turned into a bit of a nasty neighborhood,
uh,
on most days.

1372
01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:56.260
You just feel it,
your mind in your business whistling,
walking down the street,

1373
01:21:56.261 --> 01:21:59.370
and then you have people throwing potted plants at your head and then Facebook's

1374
01:21:59.371 --> 01:22:02.640
the whole shit show.
So it's like that's the worst kind of show

1375
01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:09.120
what to do.
Go back to the tried and true Instagram,
Instagram or email.
Yeah.

1376
01:22:09.190 --> 01:22:13.420
All right,
my man,
uh,
well there's so much for taking the time and uh,

1377
01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:16.470
hope to see you soon.
Come,
come,
come visit Austin.

1378
01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:21.730
Got a barrel sauna waiting for you.
Awesome.
All right,
man.
See Ya.
See Ya.

1379
01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:25.300
Everybody listening or watching on the Youtubes,
uh,

1380
01:22:25.470 --> 01:22:28.980
you can find links to everything that we've talked about in the show notes,
Tim.

1381
01:22:28.981 --> 01:22:33.570
Dot.
Blog,
forward,
slash,
podcast,
and until next time,
be safe.

1382
01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:36.810
Do not take math for fun.
Uh,

1383
01:22:36.930 --> 01:22:41.060
follow professional advice with anything medically related and,
uh,

1384
01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.600
live the examined life.

1385
01:22:42.990 --> 01:22:47.340
Just because it is self help doesn't mean it can't help you.

1386
01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:49.890
So I will leave with that.
