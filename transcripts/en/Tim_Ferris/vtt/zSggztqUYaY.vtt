1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.850
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:06.220
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking it.

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.110
I'm a cybernetic organism living.

4
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.700
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor.</v>

5
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.470
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way,
set it and forget it.

6
00:00:32.471 --> 00:00:36.820
Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous

7
00:00:36.821 --> 00:00:37.570
investors.

8
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.290
It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than

9
00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:44.290
two and a half billion dollars under management.
In fact,

10
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.640
some of my very good friends,

11
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.850
investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront.

12
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.940
So the question is why?
Why is it so popular?
Why is it unique?

13
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.230
Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

14
00:00:56.231 --> 00:00:58.210
pay pennies on the dollar for them.

15
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.930
And this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations,

16
00:01:01.931 --> 00:01:04.660
bloated sales teams,
et cetera.
And I'll come back to that in a second.

17
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.820
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk

18
00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:13.090
assessment quiz which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for

19
00:01:13.091 --> 00:01:16.900
free exactly the portfolio they'd put you in and if you just want to take their

20
00:01:16.901 --> 00:01:20.800
advice,
run with it,
do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

21
00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:22.720
you can set it and forget it and here's why.

22
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.010
The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that

23
00:01:27.011 --> 00:01:31.480
investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't great investing

24
00:01:31.481 --> 00:01:33.100
is a marathon,
not a sprint,

25
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.790
and little things that you may or may not be familiar with like automatic tax

26
00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:38.920
loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

27
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.420
cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large

28
00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:47.110
amounts of money over longer periods of time.
Wealthfront,
as I mentioned,

29
00:01:47.111 --> 00:01:49.720
since it's using software instead of retail locations,

30
00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:53.920
etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely

31
00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:55.390
impossible right off the bat,

32
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.940
you never pay commissions or account fees for everything.

33
00:01:57.941 --> 00:02:02.941
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for

34
00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:07.300
free.
If you use my link,
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim,

35
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.430
that is less than $5 a month to invest a $30,000 account for instance.
Now,

36
00:02:12.431 --> 00:02:14.020
normally when I have a sponsor on the show,

37
00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:17.590
it's because I use them and recommend them.
In this case,
it's a little different.

38
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.910
I don't use Wealthfront yet because I'm not allowed to.
Here's the deal.

39
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.170
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of sec regulations,

40
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.830
companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials.

41
00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:32.650
So I couldn't be a user end have them on the podcast,

42
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.760
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant

43
00:02:36.761 --> 00:02:40.600
amount of my own money,
at least for me,
uh,
in the team and the company itself.

44
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.750
So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client.

45
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.230
Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

46
00:02:47.231 --> 00:02:51.130
you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account.

47
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.160
But just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you.

48
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.300
Take two minutes,
fill out their questionnaire@wealthfront.com forward slash.
Tim,

49
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.390
it's fast free.
There's no downside that I can think of.

50
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.360
This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.

51
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.600
I've used athletic Greens for many,
many years and I'm asked all the time,

52
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:13.270
if you could use only one supplement,
what would it be?

53
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.030
My answer is inevitably athletic Greens.

54
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.960
It is my all in one nutritional insurance,
at least that's how I think about it.

55
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.760
It is much more than Greens.

56
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.350
It's a complete whole food supplement with 75 or so ingredients packed into one

57
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:28.750
tablespoon per day.
So when I travel,
for instance,

58
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.950
of course I would like to follow all of my regimens,
all of my pills,

59
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:34.720
all of my supplements,
all of my food to the tee.

60
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:39.721
But sometimes circumstances intervene and you're too busy or things are too

61
00:03:40.171 --> 00:03:41.004
hectic.

62
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.130
This helps me to mitigate the likelihood of getting sick and to perform

63
00:03:46.231 --> 00:03:49.770
optimally.
So if I go to say South America for an Acro Yoga intensive,

64
00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:50.880
which I did in Columbia,

65
00:03:50.881 --> 00:03:53.790
at one point I was running around like a chicken with its head cut off and I

66
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:56.550
took this every morning and it is extremely,

67
00:03:56.551 --> 00:04:00.390
extremely helpful and I usually travel with travel packets among other things,

68
00:04:00.391 --> 00:04:04.740
so you just try it out is the short version of this.

69
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.150
As listeners of the Tim Ferriss show,

70
00:04:06.151 --> 00:04:11.100
you can receive $100 worth of travel packs for free when you order.

71
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.550
That's 20 free additional individual travel pouches when you order,

72
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.630
simply go to athleticgreens.com forward slash Tim to check it out.

73
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.130
So take a look athletic greens.com forward slash Tim.

74
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.510
Hello my friend Lee lives in [inaudible].

75
00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:31.170
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

76
00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:34.680
it is typically my job to deconstruct world class performers.

77
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.710
This episode is a little indirect because the questions come from you.

78
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.500
Arnold Schwarzenegger is back for a round two on the podcast.

79
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:47.350
I could not be more excited in our first conversation,

80
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:50.720
which is episode 61 of my most popular of all time,

81
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.180
the former Mister Olympia terminator and governate or shared lessons learned

82
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.320
daily routines,
psychological warfare tactics,
which were amazing.

83
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.150
Favorite books,
early entrepreneurial ventures and tips.
For instance,

84
00:05:03.151 --> 00:05:07.050
how I made millions in real estate before he had his movie break meditation and

85
00:05:07.051 --> 00:05:09.750
many stories no one had heard before.
This time around,

86
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.920
the new host of the celebrity apprentice answered your most popular and upvoted

87
00:05:13.921 --> 00:05:17.250
questions including some controversial questions.

88
00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:20.820
He does not shy away from anything and this is no exception.

89
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:24.210
He does not mince words in this episode.
Among other things,

90
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.360
article talks about his recent Twitter battle with president elect.

91
00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:31.790
Donald Trump is investment strategies,
politics,
the state of bodybuilding,

92
00:05:31.791 --> 00:05:35.870
his sleep schedule,
and many more never before told stories.

93
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.600
He did,
however,
forget to plug his latest project.
So I will do it here.

94
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.460
Tune in to the new celebrity apprentice Mondays at 8:00 PM or watch it on the

95
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.680
NBC APP.

96
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.500
I hope you enjoy this incredible round two with Arnold Schwartzenegger.
Yeah,

97
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.720
I promise that it does not disappointed.

98
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.860
<v 2>Okay.</v>

99
00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.693
<v 1>Okay.</v>

100
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.230
<v 3>The first question comes from Tim Ferris.</v>

101
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.910
He wanted to lead off with a lot,

102
00:06:02.911 --> 00:06:05.820
has been written about the president elect's use of Twitter,

103
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.570
his tweets and move the stock market and define the news of the day.

104
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.900
You were recently on the receiving end of a couple of his tweets.

105
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.290
I think your response set it all.
So I don't want to reopen it,

106
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.820
but I would like to hear about the process.

107
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.960
How did you react when you heard he had tweeted about you and how did you

108
00:06:22.961 --> 00:06:25.120
formulate your mic drop response?

109
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.980
<v 4>Well,
first of all,
it's just kind of create the atmosphere here.</v>

110
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.040
You're sitting outside here or outside my house.

111
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.640
The fire is on outdoor fireplace.

112
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.080
I'm smoking my stove and we are having a great time.

113
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.470
That Jacuzzi is warming up slowly so that afterwards we can dig a Jacuzzi and so

114
00:06:44.471 --> 00:06:48.300
on.
So that's number one.
Number two,
that's good.
Now,
uh,

115
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.700
answer this very important question.
Tim had a great question.

116
00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.143
First of all,

117
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.260
it is important when you want to respond that you don't respond immediately.

118
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.130
Did you don't respond with a,

119
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.250
with your emotion because of course you go through various different stages in

120
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:11.200
other,
because if I would have responded right away,
I would have said,

121
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.090
don't go into the stinking Candace with a skunk.
But then a cinema said,
well,

122
00:07:16.091 --> 00:07:19.360
maybe there's not the right answer and it really doesn't say anything.

123
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.900
So we waited a little bit.
Then I said to myself,
wow,
you know,

124
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.060
I think actually I expect that,
that tweet,
because I tweeted out,
I did,

125
00:07:27.061 --> 00:07:28.950
I'm not going to vote for him and encouraged other people,

126
00:07:28.951 --> 00:07:32.100
not the boat for him says Emma's of,
you know,
being down with Trump.

127
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.730
And probably I would have done the same thing,
just,
you know,
tweet back.

128
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.660
So that was to be expected.
So now it was just an audio answer back.

129
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.560
And then slowly but surely,
no,
I started developing different answers,

130
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.900
different stages.
And I said to myself at one point,
you know,

131
00:07:46.901 --> 00:07:49.660
maybe I should just go back,
is to just a,
you know,

132
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.980
it his head against the table or something like that.

133
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:55.510
Then was another that this stupid,
uh,
okay,
let's get out of their way.

134
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.980
And so eventually I came up with something that was,

135
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.540
you know,
uh,
well I talk about,
look,

136
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.880
this is in a lot of energy that he put in there to,
to,

137
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:10.970
to compete about the ratings and boy,
who has better ratings.
Norris,

138
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:15.410
I hope that you put the same amount of energy into serving all the people of

139
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:20.411
America because it's a really important job to be the president and you have to

140
00:08:21.241 --> 00:08:26.241
be able to serve both Democrats and Republicans and declined to stay estate and

141
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.680
independence in everybody.
And so he should put the,
his energy into that.

142
00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:33.440
So that's how I came up with that,
basically.
It's great.

143
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.580
So Jan de weekend,
or maybe Jaan

144
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:38.581
<v 3>said,</v>

145
00:08:38.581 --> 00:08:42.720
what was the hardest choice in your life and what was the biggest sacrifice that

146
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.850
you've made while climbing the ladder of success?

147
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.040
<v 4>I think that there's no two ways about it.</v>

148
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:53.060
The toughest choice was who kid my bikini wax before Conan the barbarian.

149
00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:59.390
<v 5>No,
uh,
I think,
Eh,
you know,</v>

150
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:04.660
definitely the toughest choice was to run for governor because I really felt

151
00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:11.420
very passionate about becoming a public servant.
Yeah.

152
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:16.610
And it felt really strongly that I could do a better job then the politicians in

153
00:09:16.611 --> 00:09:20.450
Sacramento.
I felt that the politicians screwed up the state.

154
00:09:20.451 --> 00:09:25.200
That's why we had blackouts,
that why we had a huge debt and deficits and,
uh,

155
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.550
no one could get along.
Democrats and Republicans couldn't work together.

156
00:09:28.551 --> 00:09:32.180
And it was just a huge mess here.
And,
uh,

157
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.690
I felt that I could do a better job.
And so,
but at the same time,

158
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.520
I recognize the fact that I just finished terminator and Terminator three came

159
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:43.230
out and I,
this was,

160
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.670
I became the highest paid actor at that time in the world.

161
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:53.120
And so that meant that I was not going to be able to make two movies a year and

162
00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:55.460
make this kind of millions and billions of dollars.

163
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.400
So am I willing to go and walk away from all that money,

164
00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:03.850
potentially over $100 million over the next,
you know,
uh,
seven years.

165
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:09.250
And,
uh,
so,
um,
then there was the family question,
you know,

166
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.310
uh,
my wife was not very enthusiastic about it.

167
00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:16.630
She comes from a family that had politics,

168
00:10:16.631 --> 00:10:21.200
had a tremendous impact on death,
on a family and side effects.

169
00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.490
And so she felt like the same would happened to our family.

170
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.510
And so there were all of those debates.

171
00:10:26.511 --> 00:10:30.380
But eventually after long deliberation and thinking about the whole thing,

172
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.160
I did make up my mind and the decided to do it.

173
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.080
But it was a very,

174
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.720
very tough decision to make because I had to think about all of those different

175
00:10:40.721 --> 00:10:42.700
aspects and uh,

176
00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:46.030
but I went for it and if a very passionate and then after I made the decision,

177
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.120
I was 100% behind it and I felt like I had the neat,

178
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.350
the surf the people in to give back,
do great,

179
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.860
great country that gave me everything

180
00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.240
<v 6>Rachel or Rochelle wind holes asked,</v>

181
00:10:58.241 --> 00:11:02.980
what is the most important thing a woman needs to know if she wants to lead both

182
00:11:02.981 --> 00:11:04.600
men and women effectively?

183
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.630
<v 5>Well,
I think the first thing she needs to do is take out the,
as a woman,</v>

184
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.740
because if you want to be a leader,
you know,

185
00:11:12.741 --> 00:11:16.220
you got to think of yourself as a person,
as a human being.

186
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.680
And now there's a woman was a man,
but just,
you know,

187
00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:24.300
paint a great a vision of where you want to go,

188
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:29.070
what is your Gore and then did clear vision that you share with everyone,

189
00:11:29.071 --> 00:11:30.510
men and women around you.

190
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:35.070
We'll follow you because of the enthusiasm and because you have a very clear

191
00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:37.380
vision.
Yeah.
And it will inspire them.

192
00:11:37.381 --> 00:11:40.410
So being inspirational and then having a clear vision,

193
00:11:40.411 --> 00:11:43.290
having a clear goal and rally everyone behind you,

194
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.090
I think is the most important thing.

195
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:50.240
But don't think of yourself as a woman in this case because I tell you a Indira

196
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.490
Gandhi did not think of herself.
A woman mentioned led India.

197
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:58.660
I think that Mrs Thatcher,
who was successfully leading England,

198
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:01.210
did not think of herself as a woman and oh my God,

199
00:12:01.211 --> 00:12:04.660
what would it be like now's a woman to lead the England or something like that.

200
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.740
Mrs Skoda Mayo was one of the most extraordinary leaders of Israel and led to

201
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:15.060
this great country as through the 67 war against so many different countries,

202
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.600
was highly successful.
Did not think of herself.
I bet you any money as a woman,

203
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:20.230
uh,
you know,

204
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:24.490
Chancellor Merkel who was one of the greatest leaders in Germany right now who

205
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.970
has been a long island office,
I think than anyone else.

206
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.200
A very effective leader is a woman.
I don't think she sees herself as a woman.

207
00:12:32.201 --> 00:12:32.801
As a matter of fact,

208
00:12:32.801 --> 00:12:36.860
I remember when I met her several times during the time I was governor in,
no,

209
00:12:36.861 --> 00:12:37.960
she was a tough leader,

210
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.880
really good spot because smartbid history with politics and economics and when

211
00:12:42.881 --> 00:12:44.020
all of the different issues,

212
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:47.860
but it never even come up the subject though I'm a woman.

213
00:12:47.861 --> 00:12:50.170
And as a woman that did this and that and so on.

214
00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:53.650
Imagine Katherine did great when she led Russia.
I mean,

215
00:12:53.651 --> 00:12:56.780
do you think that she thought of herself as well?
So I,
you know,

216
00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:00.010
I think they that out,
uh,
completely,
uh,

217
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:04.900
the woman stuff and to see yourself as a person and as someone that is a great

218
00:13:04.901 --> 00:13:07.750
leader with a great vision and then rally around behind you.

219
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:08.901
<v 3>This reminds me of,</v>

220
00:13:08.901 --> 00:13:12.600
you've talked before about wanting to bring women's bodybuilding into the Arnold

221
00:13:12.601 --> 00:13:15.320
classic.
Is this the same philosophy

222
00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:19.580
<v 5>that you didn't want them to think of themselves as women?
Well,
it's a,</v>

223
00:13:19.581 --> 00:13:24.080
it's a little different because I think that there is still a tremendous

224
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:28.860
prejudice towards women and what women should not do.

225
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.083
Yeah.
And,
uh,

226
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:35.110
I feel that through sports I have learned they'd be all equal and that women

227
00:13:36.561 --> 00:13:40.490
should have the same,
right.
Uh,
to do the same sports as guys.

228
00:13:40.491 --> 00:13:43.330
Two guys should have the same ride to the same sports woman too.

229
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.470
And so I felt like a,

230
00:13:45.471 --> 00:13:50.471
who is to say that bodybuilding is a male a thing did know women can also build

231
00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:54.790
their bodies maybe differently,
but let them decide how they want to do it.

232
00:13:54.791 --> 00:13:58.240
But let women compete in bodybuilding competitions.

233
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:02.440
So we started with a herald.
Schneider,
I remember,
uh,
back east,

234
00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.210
we started a,
in Pennsylvania,

235
00:14:04.211 --> 00:14:08.480
we started the first Miss Olympia competition and then we moved to Columbus and

236
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.280
beer in Columbus,
Ohio.
Uh,
at our competition.

237
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.740
It combined with the Mr Olympia and Mister Universe,
uh,

238
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:19.760
that they've the Miss Olympia and then it became highly successful and now women

239
00:14:22.151 --> 00:14:26.890
bodybuilding and women fitness and training and that all of this stuff is as

240
00:14:26.891 --> 00:14:30.820
much a part of the international bodybuilding scene.
As for the male

241
00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.010
<v 3>bodybuilders,
Joseph Darell,</v>

242
00:14:34.011 --> 00:14:39.011
rod asked Arnold to have you always slept so sparingly or do you purposely sleep

243
00:14:39.321 --> 00:14:41.420
less to gain extra hours in your day?

244
00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:45.320
What's your current sleep schedule like and how do you keep high energy with

245
00:14:45.321 --> 00:14:47.650
little sleep?
Might make current

246
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.970
<v 5>sleeping is scheduled is pretty much the same.</v>

247
00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:52.970
It has been for the last few years.

248
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:58.080
<v 4>Uh,
but I get up early in the morning and then they go and,
uh,
uh,
work out,</v>

249
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:02.780
uh,
ride the bicycle for an hour and,
uh,
take a shower,

250
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:07.700
have breakfast,
you know,
feed my dog,
play with my dog,
uh,

251
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.710
call my kids,
tell them I love them and uh,

252
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:15.640
read a script or to read the papers in English and in German also in,

253
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:20.010
but that time it's around five o'clock in the morning.
Okay.

254
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.520
What's your actual morning routine

255
00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.720
before?
The bottom line is,

256
00:15:29.721 --> 00:15:34.721
is that I have slept nine hours a day when it was 19 years old because at that

257
00:15:37.071 --> 00:15:38.750
point,
Mina was younger,

258
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:44.150
I needed more sleep and I woke up nine hours later and it took me nine hours and

259
00:15:44.151 --> 00:15:49.070
go the full nine hours of sleep.
As time went on,
I needed less and less sleep.

260
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:54.550
And now it doesn't matter where am I wake up six hours after I go to sleep.

261
00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:03.390
It doesn't mean I'm six hours after they go to bed because there's a lot of

262
00:16:04.041 --> 00:16:06.020
people that have trouble getting to sleep.

263
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.930
And there's another secret that they use and that is,

264
00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:13.400
I don't have my iPhone or my iPad or anything in the bedroom.

265
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.240
I do not an hour before or two hours before getting into some heavy kind of

266
00:16:19.671 --> 00:16:23.900
debates about business and stuff like that or accept phone calls where those

267
00:16:23.901 --> 00:16:27.050
kinds of things can happen because I've seen that then.

268
00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.580
Then you go to bed and you mind keeps going and going and going and doesn't

269
00:16:31.581 --> 00:16:35.390
allow you to go to sleep.
So it's important to not do that.

270
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:40.100
There's other people that are very successful by not even watching TV and it

271
00:16:40.101 --> 00:16:42.890
just read a book or something like that and that puts him to sleep and dead

272
00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:47.480
standup that I watch TV because that does not kind of like bother me when they

273
00:16:47.481 --> 00:16:51.230
watch the news and so on,
or make me think about it for the next hour or so.

274
00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:55.220
So I cannot actually doze off watching TV or reading something.

275
00:16:55.221 --> 00:16:58.640
So the key thing for music stayed asleep until they wake up.

276
00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:03.020
And that is usually six hours,
five and a half hours,
sometimes five hours.

277
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.110
Some of them six and a half hours,
but it's an average of around six hours.

278
00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:10.640
It doesn't matter if I'm flying to Europe on the plane,
that is a 12 hour flight.

279
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:11.180
Uh,

280
00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:15.980
sometimes I also wake up six hours later if they'd go to sleep and in Europe

281
00:17:15.981 --> 00:17:20.390
with the time change,
I get up six hours later.
So it gives me an advantage.

282
00:17:20.391 --> 00:17:24.320
Of course they have an extra few hours then to do other things and the learn or

283
00:17:24.321 --> 00:17:28.640
the reader to do something.
Uh,
that is fun to do.
But I mean,
I think the people,

284
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:33.200
the key thing is for people not to get as obsessed about the sleep that you can

285
00:17:33.201 --> 00:17:34.520
carve out extra time,

286
00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:39.790
but to organize your day really well so that you can do a lot of things in the

287
00:17:40.221 --> 00:17:42.710
competition.
A lot of things,
rather than wasting the day,

288
00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.040
if that's what you want to do.
You know,
there's people that they'd say,
okay,

289
00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:46.874
I'm retired.

290
00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.740
I'm just going to play golf and I don't even pay any attention to being

291
00:17:49.741 --> 00:17:53.940
productive.
I have done this my whole life.
Others want to be productive then.

292
00:17:53.941 --> 00:17:56.220
Yeah,
I would just say,
okay.
He is why they get up.

293
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.940
The early risers usually are the most successful people I have.

294
00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.680
If it's the president of the United States,

295
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:05.700
if it is the pope or older leaders or the business leaders,

296
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.610
everyone always tells me that they get up at five o'clock good,

297
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.010
six o'clock they read the paper,
they get going,

298
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.260
they get organized in us that answering mail,

299
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.990
communicating with Europe and stuff like that.
So I think,
uh,

300
00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:22.170
organizing your day and having a very clear vision and program of what you want

301
00:18:22.171 --> 00:18:25.890
to accomplish and being Susie gastic I think that is the key thing.

302
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.600
Not just to worry about I got down to sleep six hours out of RSM losing too much

303
00:18:30.601 --> 00:18:33.390
time or something like that.
Health wise,

304
00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.760
the best thing is to get enough sleep that you need.

305
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.750
Everyone is a little bit different about that.
Perry read ass.

306
00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:44.220
What is something you believe that others might consider?
Totally crazy.

307
00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.270
I think the first thing that comes to my mind is,
um,

308
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:54.150
that you can't predict the environment and protect the economy at the same time.

309
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:59.400
And we have seen this in California,
how successful we have been.

310
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:01.960
When I was governor.
Uh,

311
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:07.040
I was very fortunate to lead a state that had a great history in protecting the

312
00:19:08.551 --> 00:19:13.520
environment,
but also the great history of,
you know,
being an economic powerhouse.

313
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:14.911
Uh,

314
00:19:14.911 --> 00:19:19.590
we have been consistently anywhere been in the fifth largest economy to the

315
00:19:19.591 --> 00:19:21.210
eighth largest economy in the world.

316
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.760
Now we can the fifth largest economy in the world.

317
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:29.030
And I think that just shows to you that having a great environmental protection

318
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:35.390
and laws in place in protecting the environment that you can do that

319
00:19:35.581 --> 00:19:39.030
successfully.
We have made a commitment to reducing greenhouse gases,

320
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.760
but 25% by the year 2020,

321
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
we made a commitment to have almost 50% of renewables by the year 2020 we have

322
00:19:47.281 --> 00:19:51.630
made a commitment to make our buildings more green and to have a,
you know,

323
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:56.960
to do things that really moves us in the direction of keeping our environment

324
00:19:57.361 --> 00:20:01.890
clean.
But at the same time,
we've also proven that our achieve DP for instance,

325
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.990
where the national GDP is a one and a half,
2% of growth,

326
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:11.040
uh,
we in California had a GDP growth last year for instance,

327
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:12.660
of 4.2%.

328
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:17.900
So as you can see that we are doubled as good as the nation is as an average,

329
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:19.830
and we have the strong,

330
00:20:19.831 --> 00:20:23.790
strongest and the toughest environmental laws at the same time.

331
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:28.530
So there's a huge misconception that going green means that you destroy the

332
00:20:28.531 --> 00:20:33.360
economy.
And we have,
as a matter of fact,
the green sector in California,
you know,

333
00:20:33.361 --> 00:20:37.770
a producer's 10 times more jobs now than any other sector in California.

334
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.800
So no matter which way you look,
you know,

335
00:20:40.801 --> 00:20:44.820
we have become a leader and we are the fifth largest economy in the world and be

336
00:20:44.821 --> 00:20:47.260
out doing the rest of the states in the United States.

337
00:20:47.261 --> 00:20:51.230
So I hope did the federal government thinks really close notice of what

338
00:20:51.231 --> 00:20:52.310
California is doing?

339
00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:54.360
<v 6>Patrick Chapman says,</v>

340
00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:58.590
I'm a musician taking auditions and competitions constantly.

341
00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:02.790
I'd love to hear your best tips for preparing mentally for competition.

342
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:03.731
<v 4>Well,</v>

343
00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:06.760
I think that it doesn't really matter if you are going to do an audition for

344
00:21:06.761 --> 00:21:11.761
music or for movies or TV or if you're competing on the stage in a bodybuilding

345
00:21:12.491 --> 00:21:17.491
competition or if you're doing a downhill race as a skier or via UFC fighter,

346
00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:22.080
uh,
or if you run a corporation,
it is mileage.

347
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.120
It is a reps that count.
The more often you do something.

348
00:21:27.121 --> 00:21:30.990
I am a big believer in practicing and practicing and practicing.
Why?

349
00:21:30.991 --> 00:21:32.640
Because the more you practice,

350
00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:36.840
the better you get and the more it becomes second nature and then slowly the

351
00:21:36.841 --> 00:21:41.490
fear goes away that you may not be able to remember your lines when you fogo for

352
00:21:41.491 --> 00:21:45.030
an audition or the fear that you may be a sound stupid and dead,

353
00:21:45.031 --> 00:21:48.740
you're not going to pull it off or whatever it is.
It is always the,

354
00:21:48.741 --> 00:21:50.520
the more you practice something,

355
00:21:50.521 --> 00:21:54.230
the more confidence you get and the better you're going to perform when you go

356
00:21:54.231 --> 00:21:58.440
to those auditions in the first place.
So reps,
reps,
reps,

357
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.280
and just keep practicing and practicing.
Uh,

358
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:06.060
we have a saying in German [inaudible] Martin Meister,
which means,
you know,

359
00:22:06.061 --> 00:22:07.990
the more you would practice something,

360
00:22:07.991 --> 00:22:11.530
the more you become the master of something.
And,
and so that,
that's a reality

361
00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.530
<v 6>is that why when you have a new speech,
you're practicing,
you're right.</v>

362
00:22:14.531 --> 00:22:15.550
The tallies on it.

363
00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:16.613
<v 4>Well that,</v>

364
00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.940
that Hal is a ride on it because that's comes from a body building and weight

365
00:22:19.941 --> 00:22:23.840
lifting background because we used to have a jock,
uh,

366
00:22:23.841 --> 00:22:27.000
in our weightlifting gym.
It'd be,
uh,
made,
uh,

367
00:22:27.001 --> 00:22:32.001
a line for each rep that we did so that I know an aunt when a look at it,

368
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:36.410
did a really do all my sets rather than cheating on yourself with the Reps.

369
00:22:36.411 --> 00:22:37.880
So we'd use said,
so with anything,

370
00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.780
we even wrote the weight on it next to it and compared it to the last weeks

371
00:22:41.781 --> 00:22:44.600
chart of how much we improved and await notice.

372
00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.960
So it is all about always do enough reps.

373
00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:51.780
And of course you'll learn this in sport.
This is why I always say,
you know,

374
00:22:51.781 --> 00:22:54.210
families should insist that the kids to sports,

375
00:22:54.211 --> 00:22:59.090
because in sports we'll learn the lessons.
There is no shortcut,
uh,

376
00:22:59.091 --> 00:23:03.300
and the only way you get confidence is doing reps and getting good at what

377
00:23:03.301 --> 00:23:05.790
you're doing.
And that's what gives you the confidence.

378
00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:10.530
Then you cut down the failures and on and on and on.
So just through the reps,

379
00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:14.400
<v 6>Marsha Peterson ass in Arnold's experience,</v>

380
00:23:14.401 --> 00:23:18.270
how does age and aging effect Diet and fitness,

381
00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:22.530
what adjustments do you recommend for those of us who are no longer a spring

382
00:23:22.531 --> 00:23:23.364
chicken?

383
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:28.680
<v 4>Well,
I think the first thing that comes to my mind is you got to really be very</v>

384
00:23:28.681 --> 00:23:32.520
adamant.
Do use,
uh,
when you get older,
uh,

385
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.790
organic gluten free botox.

386
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:42.060
I mean this is extremely important.
Um,
no,

387
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:46.100
in all seriousness,
I think that the most important thing really is,

388
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.360
<v 5>is that you recognize that your metabolism slows down.</v>

389
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:52.730
And uh,

390
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:58.480
let's say as a male they don't produce as much testosterone and it's a

391
00:23:58.481 --> 00:24:01.010
definitely you have to dig certain food supplements that a,

392
00:24:01.011 --> 00:24:06.011
that you can supplement than produce what testosterone and that you eat.

393
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.850
Uh,
did you watch,
uh,
the kind of food you eat?

394
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.680
Because what you get away with when you are 19 to 20 years old,

395
00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.720
you're not going to get away with.

396
00:24:17.721 --> 00:24:22.370
Now I remember that when I was competing in the Mr Olympia competition and that

397
00:24:22.371 --> 00:24:25.070
was at the height of my party,
Korea.
You know what,

398
00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:30.080
we worked at five hours a day and the body was a much faster metabolism.

399
00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:33.360
We would go even before a competition,

400
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:38.390
before the Mr Olympia competition to the house of pies and be,
we'd a Pi and uh,

401
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.080
the day I could not get away with that because you would immediately gained

402
00:24:42.081 --> 00:24:43.380
weight those days.

403
00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:46.920
It was before the competition and we still won the competition because your

404
00:24:46.921 --> 00:24:48.090
metabolism is different.

405
00:24:48.091 --> 00:24:51.960
So you have to recognize that you have to go and stay away from bread if to stay

406
00:24:51.961 --> 00:24:54.720
away from desserts,
maybe can have it every so often,

407
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.000
but don't think that is a daily routine.

408
00:24:57.001 --> 00:24:59.710
Beecher's keep eating bread and pasta and a,

409
00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.040
your desserts and ice cream and all the kinds of things.

410
00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:06.990
And I'd have to tell you that this is very torturous for me because I am

411
00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:11.380
Austrian and then generally grow up in Austria with beautiful,

412
00:25:11.381 --> 00:25:13.060
wonderful desserts.
I mean,

413
00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:18.090
if [inaudible] toward [inaudible] apple strudel from strudel labor knut a

414
00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:19.910
minute.

415
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:24.390
There's so many different things that we have that are fattening and they got to

416
00:25:24.391 --> 00:25:29.391
get off all of those things and just really no eat much lighter.

417
00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.160
I ate smaller meals now at night.

418
00:25:32.161 --> 00:25:35.320
Many times it just have soup and Nadine anything.
Yeah.

419
00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.790
In order to really stay trim,
it is a real battle.

420
00:25:37.791 --> 00:25:40.460
And I think that I'm not the only one that goes through the battle.

421
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:44.090
I think everyone in the gym and I go to Gold's gym,
it's a,
it,

422
00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.600
everyone tells me the same story they'd done as soon as they get to be passed
40,

423
00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.750
you know,
uh,
they have a tendency of getting easier,
overweight and fat.

424
00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.870
And now of course it's a good time because it's new year.

425
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:59.320
So you can make a new year's resolution and say,
I want to lose 10 pounds.

426
00:25:59.321 --> 00:26:00.580
So I wanted to lose 20 pounds.

427
00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:03.850
And he is the Diet that I'm going to be on and dense exactly what I would

428
00:26:03.851 --> 00:26:04.684
recommend.

429
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:10.950
<v 6>Mike Unix says you have a great history combating climate change and you've</v>

430
00:26:10.951 --> 00:26:15.780
recently taken on trying to get people to eat less meat as animal agriculture as

431
00:26:15.781 --> 00:26:18.150
a major source of greenhouse gas emissions.

432
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.170
What are your future plans to keep spreading this message and reach more people?

433
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.651
<v 5>Well,</v>

434
00:26:22.651 --> 00:26:27.651
I think that the most upsetting thing to me is that we have so many really

435
00:26:30.631 --> 00:26:32.490
passionate environmentalist.

436
00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:37.740
It really is serious about helping earth be healthy.
Yeah.
And uh,

437
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:42.070
reducing pollution,
but their communication skills allows you,

438
00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:45.960
uh,
because they always keep talking about climate change.

439
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:51.110
It doesn't matter what speech did you listen to if it is president Obama's

440
00:26:51.111 --> 00:26:54.750
speech or if it is some senators,
speech chauvinism,
environmentalist speech,

441
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:59.960
they talk about climate change and it doesn't mean anything due to the mass in

442
00:27:00.961 --> 00:27:03.090
the world that goes right over their head.

443
00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.770
And they talk about something that happens in,

444
00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:09.540
in 10 years from now that talk about what happens in 20 years from now and the

445
00:27:09.541 --> 00:27:12.490
sea level's rising in 50 years from now.
And that the,

446
00:27:12.491 --> 00:27:17.010
that the human mind is not equipped to think down the line,

447
00:27:17.011 --> 00:27:19.860
what happens down the line.
They want to know what's happening today,

448
00:27:19.861 --> 00:27:24.861
what's happening right now and what's happening right now is disastrous because

449
00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.100
Belushi,
and that's what environmental is,
should be talking about.

450
00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:34.410
Pollution is killing 7 million people a year that is happening right now.

451
00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:36.960
And they never talk about it.

452
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.330
I said that most of what is going on with this guys,

453
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.080
why are they so obsessed about,
uh,
you know,

454
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:48.210
climate change and not about the amount of people that are dying every year

455
00:27:48.211 --> 00:27:51.510
because of pollution.
I mean,
the amount 7 million that I'm talking about,

456
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:55.900
that's much more than all the traffic accidents.
That's much more than that.

457
00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:00.780
The wars that kill people,
uh,
oh that isis that we are worried about,

458
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.090
or suicides or homicides.

459
00:28:03.091 --> 00:28:08.091
So all of these things together is not even close to that amount of 7 million

460
00:28:08.551 --> 00:28:12.540
people.
So pollution is the biggest killer.

461
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.230
And they're not talking about it.
They kind of throw it away.
Yeah.

462
00:28:16.231 --> 00:28:17.700
And as the this climate change.

463
00:28:17.701 --> 00:28:20.940
And then it also that health aspect of it that's very,
you know,

464
00:28:20.941 --> 00:28:23.180
people get sick from pollution and order sit.

465
00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:28.050
They mentioned it and as a side Bar,
but not really as like the main thing.

466
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:31.410
That's what's happening that day.
So the communication has to be better.

467
00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.040
I always talk about the four legged stool.
I always talk about that.
Yes,

468
00:28:35.041 --> 00:28:38.250
we should talk about climate change because that is a reality.

469
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.890
We will have time to change and it is disastrous.

470
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:45.360
But in order to really make people react and become part of the,

471
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.760
uh,
of the environmental crusade,

472
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:52.170
we should tell them that right now 7 million people die in America.

473
00:28:52.171 --> 00:28:55.980
250,000 people die.
And in,
you know,
in India,

474
00:28:56.190 --> 00:29:00.030
over a million people in China,
over a million people die because of pollution.

475
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.430
And this goes on and on and on,
all over the world.

476
00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:06.480
That's what we should talk about.
So the first leg should be in a climate change.

477
00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:09.240
Second,
they should be that,
that the,
you know,
talking about the pollution.

478
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.200
The third should be that how many jobs we can create with a green economy and

479
00:29:13.201 --> 00:29:15.540
the fourth is national security,
so we should,

480
00:29:15.541 --> 00:29:19.930
this is the four legged stool because we got to get energy independent because

481
00:29:19.931 --> 00:29:21.270
they get off fossil fuels,

482
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:26.030
so we don't have to ever rely on countries that our enemy and that w don't wish

483
00:29:26.031 --> 00:29:26.850
as well.

484
00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:31.850
So those are the th th there's the four legged stool that I talk about and I

485
00:29:31.981 --> 00:29:36.981
think that is what we need to concentrate on and we just have to kind of let

486
00:29:37.711 --> 00:29:41.500
everyone know that they got to communicate differently,
gather,

487
00:29:41.501 --> 00:29:45.600
communicate in the way that means something to people they understand because

488
00:29:45.601 --> 00:29:47.350
people are basically survivors.

489
00:29:47.351 --> 00:29:51.970
They worry about right now when you have an accident,
you don't go and say this.

490
00:29:51.971 --> 00:29:55.300
They're thinking about when someone breaks their leg and they have an open wound

491
00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:59.800
that or how would we going to fix the leg?
No,
first you stop the bleeding.

492
00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.980
That's the first thing that you do.

493
00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.640
And then you go and take them to the hospital and then they can worry about how

494
00:30:05.641 --> 00:30:07.290
to fix the leg and orders kind of things.

495
00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.330
And the same as with our environmental movement.

496
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:12.720
We got to talk about the amount of people that die every year because of

497
00:30:12.721 --> 00:30:13.554
pollution.

498
00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.480
<v 3>And just to expand on Mike's question,
this isn't just theoretical for you.</v>

499
00:30:17.481 --> 00:30:22.481
You actually ran the anti prop 23 campaign in California in 2010 with these

500
00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:24.300
principles.
Well,

501
00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:29.420
<v 5>you're absolutely correct because we found out the total coincidence that this</v>

502
00:30:30.051 --> 00:30:34.130
is what the people really pay attention to the most is the health aspect.

503
00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.880
And it is,
you know,
of what tremendous impact,
uh,

504
00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.950
pollution has not only on the health of grownups,
but for instance,

505
00:30:41.951 --> 00:30:44.950
in the Central Valley in California,
we talked about,
you know,

506
00:30:44.951 --> 00:30:46.180
how it creates asthma.
Yeah.

507
00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:50.270
Asthma and both kind of effect it has on kids and to health and stuff like this.

508
00:30:50.271 --> 00:30:54.580
And people was so alarmed when they heard that the statistics that they did

509
00:30:54.581 --> 00:30:59.510
everything they could to go and do keep in effect our environmental laws.

510
00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:02.990
Even though the oil and coal companies came into California,

511
00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.050
we'd proposition 23.
Yeah.

512
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:08.940
And tried to have the people vote against our environmental laws and they were

513
00:31:08.941 --> 00:31:09.840
not successful.

514
00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:15.030
We beat them with 80% of the votes and chased him out of the state because we

515
00:31:17.051 --> 00:31:20.900
use the health aspect as a means to really get through independent.

516
00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:23.810
It's through to the people and let them know how important it is that we keep

517
00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.230
our environmental laws,
which are the best in the nation

518
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:28.700
<v 3>and our environmental laws,</v>

519
00:31:28.701 --> 00:31:32.230
one and conservative districts as well as liberal districts with that.
Right.

520
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.800
<v 5>That's right.
Because it,
it,
it,</v>

521
00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:38.420
Republicans and Democrats alike all want to go and have healthy,
uh,

522
00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:43.460
and have healthy water,
clean water,
and the clean ground,
I mean,
air,

523
00:31:43.461 --> 00:31:46.490
water pollution and the,
the,
the,
the,
the ground pollution did we have,

524
00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:51.500
is disastrous and biggest to always fight in order to clean our environment.

525
00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:56.190
Cody Szuchman says,
Arnold,
we hear about your many successes in life.

526
00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.990
<v 3>What do you consider your greatest failure and how did is set up or shape your</v>

527
00:32:00.991 --> 00:32:02.400
future successes?

528
00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:07.240
<v 5>Well,
I think that,
uh,
you have to recognize that it doesn't matter who it is,</v>

529
00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.600
the most successful person in the world.
I can tell you honestly,

530
00:32:11.601 --> 00:32:14.460
that they also had a tremendous amount of failures.
Uh,

531
00:32:14.461 --> 00:32:16.770
it's not always just success.
The key thing is,

532
00:32:16.771 --> 00:32:21.740
is that we learn from the failures actually more than from our successes.

533
00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:26.280
And,
uh,
it doesn't matter if you talk about the best,
uh,
you know,

534
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:30.050
basketball player.
I had a member Magley Jordan want them,
said,
uh,

535
00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:34.820
in an interview that he missed 9,000 shots.
Uh,
you know,

536
00:32:34.821 --> 00:32:36.440
and he was one of the grid,
the greatest,

537
00:32:36.441 --> 00:32:40.240
if not the greatest basketball player in the world.
So yes,
you miss not a,

538
00:32:40.241 --> 00:32:44.120
remember that the,
you know,
Ted Williams,
uh,
one of the greatest baseball players,

539
00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:48.700
remember 19,
think it was 1941 or so when the,

540
00:32:48.701 --> 00:32:52.730
he had the best of baseball season and the average of four oh six,

541
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:55.280
a 406.
And uh,

542
00:32:55.790 --> 00:33:00.790
and that meant that 40% plus 40.6% to be exact,

543
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.250
uh,
he was successful with his hits.

544
00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:08.810
There is batting and a 60% therefore we're failures.

545
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:09.730
So think about it.

546
00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:14.730
This is the greatest baseball player that is record still stands today.

547
00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:19.430
So it just shows you the,
everyone has failures and everyone and enter.

548
00:33:19.431 --> 00:33:22.130
The key thing is is did you learn from this field?
And they move on.

549
00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:25.940
I had my failures in bodybuilding.
I lost bodybuilding competitions.

550
00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:30.770
Most people only know my victories,
which were a lot.
But I've also lost,

551
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.590
I lost in weightlifting,
I lost him.
Power lifting.

552
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:38.360
I embarrass myself many times trying to lift the 500 pounds on the bench press

553
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.600
in front of 2000 people in a beer hall in Germany.

554
00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:44.630
And I failed and it crashed on my chest.
They couldn't make it.

555
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.910
But eventually it did make it.
And uh,
I lost,
you know,

556
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:51.140
I had failures in the movie business.
I remember I had thought of movies,

557
00:33:51.141 --> 00:33:52.130
the events through the roof.

558
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:55.400
But then there were movies that went right in the toilet that were not as

559
00:33:55.401 --> 00:33:58.280
successful books did.
They came out with that one,

560
00:33:58.281 --> 00:33:59.720
a New York Times bestseller list,

561
00:33:59.721 --> 00:34:04.400
and then others that didn't live up to the expectations.
And,
and failed.

562
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:08.760
So yes,
we have those kinds of things in.
To me,
the key thing is always,
uh,

563
00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:11.360
and you know,
they will learn from it.
I have failed as Jose,

564
00:34:11.361 --> 00:34:14.720
I remember in my personal life and I learned from that,
you know,

565
00:34:14.721 --> 00:34:18.410
and then you move on again.
What is important is that you get up,

566
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:19.820
when you fall,

567
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:25.520
the winner always gets up and the loser stays down.

568
00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.410
That's was it.
What's the difference of the me?

569
00:34:27.411 --> 00:34:29.800
The important thing is always that when you've renewed,

570
00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.630
when you fail on something you does,
does,
you get up,

571
00:34:32.631 --> 00:34:35.210
you dust yourself off and you move on and have again,

572
00:34:35.211 --> 00:34:37.370
a great vision of which direction you want to go.

573
00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:41.900
Pick another goal and keep moving forward.
Philip Charles asks,

574
00:34:41.901 --> 00:34:46.901
what tips did you receive at an older age that you could have used in your 20s

575
00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:52.400
or does a lot of things that we learned throughout the years,
obviously,

576
00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:57.410
but I think the main thing that that comes to my mind is charity.

577
00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:02.180
You know that when you're young you don't think about that.

578
00:35:02.181 --> 00:35:05.480
You should reach out and you should help others.
So,
you know,

579
00:35:05.481 --> 00:35:10.150
like I was only thinking about my goal to be on that stage at,

580
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:15.190
in London at the Mister Universe competition and just like reg park,

581
00:35:15.411 --> 00:35:20.100
my idol that once re mister universe competitions and then became Hercules in

582
00:35:20.101 --> 00:35:20.600
the movies.

583
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:25.600
Not that I wanted to have that trophy on that same stage as he wanted.

584
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:28.130
And that was the only thing that in my mind.

585
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:31.010
And then after I won that it was winning Mister Olympian,

586
00:35:31.011 --> 00:35:34.220
Mr World and all the competition become the greatest body builder.

587
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:38.460
That's all I had in my mind.
There was total tunnel vision and uh,

588
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:43.490
but then later on I learned luckily that how important it is to also not only

589
00:35:44.491 --> 00:35:49.491
think about me but to think about we and to go and to help others that a lot of

590
00:35:51.181 --> 00:35:52.410
people that need help,

591
00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:57.030
if it is help people that need help in their training and to go around and help

592
00:35:57.031 --> 00:36:01.770
people hold seminars and teach them about training and about the importance of

593
00:36:01.771 --> 00:36:04.210
exercising the right way.
If it is that a,

594
00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:06.750
the make sure that everyone can do sports.

595
00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:11.400
Like I got involved in Special Olympics instead of helping Special Olympians to

596
00:36:11.401 --> 00:36:14.640
do sports and specifically to do weight training and power lifting.

597
00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:18.090
And that introduced a ended those Special Olympics movement,

598
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:21.540
a power lifting competitions,
which are now worldwide and they're very,

599
00:36:21.541 --> 00:36:25.170
very successful.
We started Special Olympics specific in Austria,

600
00:36:25.171 --> 00:36:30.130
also in God oldest ski races together to start in to help me and support me and

601
00:36:30.131 --> 00:36:33.060
just started special Olympics Stenberg together with the private sector and the

602
00:36:33.061 --> 00:36:35.130
government Norris.
And then eventually,
you know,

603
00:36:35.131 --> 00:36:39.540
as starting afterschool programs and then becoming the chairman of the

604
00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:42.360
President's Council on physical fitness and travel around the countries are all

605
00:36:42.361 --> 00:36:47.361
50 states and promote health and fitness and bring everyone together and then

606
00:36:47.491 --> 00:36:49.590
eventually led to a running for governor.

607
00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:54.780
As so I think giving back and recognizing that every one of us needs help.

608
00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:59.860
I got plenty of help to be where I am the day.

609
00:36:59.861 --> 00:37:03.290
There's no such thing as a self made man,
as I always say,
you know,

610
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.520
there's people that help me to be where I am today.

611
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:09.450
So it is up to me now to inspire other people to help them.

612
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:11.610
And to go and reach out and to help them.

613
00:37:11.611 --> 00:37:15.780
This is what made me be get involved in the environmental movement and in this

614
00:37:15.781 --> 00:37:19.710
environmental crusade and that just love giving back where you don't think about

615
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.350
what is in it for me,
but you know,

616
00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:27.540
how can I help this great nation of America that gave me all the chances in the

617
00:37:27.541 --> 00:37:30.780
world and it opened up so many doors of opportunities,

618
00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:34.950
I would not have accomplished any of the things if it wouldn't have come to

619
00:37:34.951 --> 00:37:37.350
America.
And you know,

620
00:37:37.351 --> 00:37:42.060
so to give something back to me is extremely important and I want to have kids

621
00:37:42.061 --> 00:37:44.100
learn this as early as possible.

622
00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:48.540
That part of being successful is to give also something back.

623
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:50.490
You talked about tunnel vision,

624
00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:54.450
Louis Louis or Louis Congdon says,

625
00:37:54.451 --> 00:37:58.110
have you ever found that your pursuit of success has made you blind to other

626
00:37:58.111 --> 00:38:02.520
parts of your life?
I don't know if you will call it blind,

627
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:04.320
but I would say that yes,

628
00:38:04.321 --> 00:38:07.590
when you are trying to be successful,

629
00:38:07.591 --> 00:38:12.350
you have to have tunnel vision and you got to have blinders on and not the CNN

630
00:38:12.351 --> 00:38:16.020
seeing that is on the left and the right side and just really focus and what

631
00:38:16.021 --> 00:38:19.020
they call and golf and in tennis,
in the oldest ball sports,

632
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:20.430
keep your eye on the ball.

633
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:24.330
And when you do that many focused as much on on something,

634
00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:29.660
then of course you are not being able to enjoy all of the things that life has

635
00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:32.700
to offer because you're so focused on this.
One thing.

636
00:38:32.701 --> 00:38:35.790
I remembered that when I started with bodybuilding weightlifting,

637
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.690
<v 4>one of the first things they told us was,</v>

638
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.620
because I come from a country where you do skiing and skiing is very popular.

639
00:38:41.621 --> 00:38:43.750
Don't go skiing.
You know,

640
00:38:43.751 --> 00:38:47.530
you can't go skiing because you're going to break a leg eventually and that will

641
00:38:47.531 --> 00:38:50.590
set you back and you're not going to go and be able to weight lift into the

642
00:38:50.591 --> 00:38:55.300
bodybuilding at Aza.
So don't go skiing.
Don't go.
I escape.
So you always kind of,

643
00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:59.650
uh,
you know,
have to turn down certain things and,
and,
and,

644
00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:03.370
and uh,
you,
you see there but you,
uh,

645
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:06.320
you have to focus on the thing that you really want to be the best.

646
00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.920
And that's what I did.
And,
uh,
you know,

647
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:13.570
I don't regret that at all because you cannot be good in everything and you

648
00:39:13.571 --> 00:39:17.170
cannot do everything.
And at the same time be a champion in one thing.

649
00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.620
There is no such thing.
So I decided I wanted to be a champion.

650
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:24.580
I decided that I wanted to go all out in my various different careers.

651
00:39:24.581 --> 00:39:29.040
If it is embodied building,
if it is in acting,
uh,
I remember that in,
in,
in,

652
00:39:29.041 --> 00:39:31.960
in acting.
If it was a perfect example,

653
00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.750
whenever you sign on to a movie,

654
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.230
let's say the terminator or command or Predator or whatever it is,

655
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:43.650
you had to sign for the insurance and the bonding company you designed that you

656
00:39:43.661 --> 00:39:48.490
are not going to do while you're doing the movie to any motorcycle riding,

657
00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:52.840
any skiing,
no horseback riding,
Lobero shooting,

658
00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:57.610
no scuba diving and all of those things because those things are dangerous and

659
00:39:57.611 --> 00:40:02.050
they don't want you to get into those dangers while you're shooting a movie

660
00:40:02.051 --> 00:40:07.051
because you know when you get injured then the hold up and the whole production

661
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.520
costs millions and millions of dollars.

662
00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.610
So that just shows you you have to make sacrifices.
Yes,

663
00:40:12.611 --> 00:40:15.160
you can be the terminator as he can be the command.
Yes,

664
00:40:15.161 --> 00:40:17.010
he can be the last action hero in noticing,

665
00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:21.520
but you cannot do those kinds of things while you're doing the movie.

666
00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:25.270
So you always have to make sacrifices.
That's just the bottom line of it.

667
00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:29.970
So this is why you believe in having a specific goal so that you have an end

668
00:40:29.971 --> 00:40:33.700
point when then you can say,
okay,
the movie's finished.
Now I can go skiing.

669
00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:39.190
I started skiing with the age of 30 after I was finished with competition and

670
00:40:39.191 --> 00:40:41.740
then I was not allowed the skis.
Like I said,

671
00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:45.910
during the times when it was doing a movie,
which I totally understood.
Uh,

672
00:40:45.911 --> 00:40:49.600
it was hard to do because I'm,
I'm very,
uh,

673
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:51.160
much into skiing.

674
00:40:51.161 --> 00:40:55.720
I love skiing because I missed out on it when I was young and now I love doing

675
00:40:55.721 --> 00:40:57.070
it or motorcycle riding,
you know,

676
00:40:57.071 --> 00:40:59.770
all of a sudden that cannot ride a motorcycle for the three months while I'm

677
00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:04.840
doing a movie.
And so,
so you have to,
you have to make sacrifices and you know,

678
00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:09.850
uh,
but that's the difference between being a kid and being a grown up as a kid.

679
00:41:09.851 --> 00:41:13.630
You always want to have everything so grown up,
you have to make choices.
And,
uh,

680
00:41:13.631 --> 00:41:16.180
I made the right choice and I'm happy that they made the choice.

681
00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:20.050
And May I remind you because you just mentioned something about you got to shoot

682
00:41:20.051 --> 00:41:24.520
for you.
Call now that everyone is as driven as I am.

683
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:28.900
I want to make this perfectly clear.
I was always a very driven person.

684
00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:33.190
I grew up to a driven,
I think it's because it came from a little country.

685
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:34.940
It was after the Second World War.

686
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:39.950
There was poverty and starvation and there was not much around and grew up poor

687
00:41:39.951 --> 00:41:40.784
and all this stuff.

688
00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:45.560
So it creates a whole different fire in the belly and the will to succeed in

689
00:41:45.561 --> 00:41:49.580
order stuff.
And I just had that.
But that was my thing.

690
00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:50.810
I was in the dad.

691
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:55.290
Not everyone is as driven and then you don't have to be the driven.
Uh,

692
00:41:55.310 --> 00:42:00.310
the people did a very happy with a normal job to have a wonderful family and it

693
00:42:00.821 --> 00:42:04.940
just relax into live a moderate to good life.

694
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:07.570
And that's what makes them happy.
The key thing is,

695
00:42:07.571 --> 00:42:12.350
is to recognize there's many roads to as being successful and many roads to be

696
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:16.930
happy.
And the ultimate goal that people always should shoot for is that they're

697
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:20.600
satisfied and that they're happy.
And that can come many different ways.

698
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:26.200
Michael Denari says he's seen that Warren Buffet will be one of your advisors

699
00:42:26.301 --> 00:42:28.340
and an upcoming episode of the apprentice.

700
00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.260
How did you get to know Warren Buffett?

701
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:36.170
Warren Buffett has become a friend of mine.
Uh,
I would say for decades now.

702
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:41.150
We used to travel around and end up,
uh,
at the same places and,
uh,

703
00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:46.100
uh,
you know,
he asked me several times to come with him and he does his business

704
00:42:46.101 --> 00:42:50.870
presentations and stuff like that and uh,
he and I hit it off really well.

705
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:54.240
Then he bought Netjet,
uh,
because I flew around a lot with the,

706
00:42:54.241 --> 00:42:58.250
with the different jets,
uh,
for the movie promotions in order.
It's kind of stuff.

707
00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:03.310
So we really got to like each other and I of course had the highest respect for

708
00:43:04.311 --> 00:43:09.311
him because here's a guy that is so rich and it makes so much money and is so

709
00:43:11.151 --> 00:43:15.200
successful with so many companies,
but he's not really in the money.

710
00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.450
That is the wildest thing.
I mean,
he,
they,

711
00:43:17.451 --> 00:43:22.250
he stayed in normal hotel room since he drives around when you go to Omaha with

712
00:43:22.251 --> 00:43:26.210
a regular car that has been driving around with for the last 30 years and you

713
00:43:26.211 --> 00:43:30.380
know,
and,
and he,
and he just isn't into it so that it's really funded for him.

714
00:43:30.381 --> 00:43:34.520
It's just kind of like,
you know,
being like the greatest athlete or being like,

715
00:43:34.521 --> 00:43:36.440
uh,
in a,
uh,

716
00:43:36.441 --> 00:43:41.150
an astronaut or whatever that happens to be his bag.
And he's very,

717
00:43:41.151 --> 00:43:45.560
very talented to make $1 into two.
And he's a wonderful human being,

718
00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.160
the most giving human being as you know,
that he,
in his world,

719
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.390
he's going to give away all of his money afterwards so it gives a little bit to

720
00:43:53.391 --> 00:43:54.430
the kids and then the rest of it,

721
00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:57.050
it gives away for charity and all this kind of stuff.

722
00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:01.250
So to me that is a extraordinary human being.

723
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:05.730
And so he was also one of the first ones when I ran for governor to,

724
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:08.720
he's a democrat.
I'm a Republican,

725
00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:12.020
but he stood by my side because he knew where my heart was,

726
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:16.490
that I was interested in serving all the people not to be an ideology and it is

727
00:44:16.491 --> 00:44:17.910
ideology and get,
you know,

728
00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:22.610
caught up in this ideological corners of or so on that uh,

729
00:44:22.611 --> 00:44:24.440
you know,
he was there.

730
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:28.160
He endorsed me and he was standing on my left.

731
00:44:28.161 --> 00:44:32.340
I remember the press conference and George Shultz,
Secretary George Shultz

732
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.520
<v 5>stood on my right side.
Yeah.
In both of them.</v>

733
00:44:34.521 --> 00:44:39.370
Endorsement that gave kind of the message did I wanted to serve all people of

734
00:44:39.371 --> 00:44:43.430
California Democrats and Republicans and everybody.
Yeah.
And so,
uh,

735
00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:48.060
so he was also supportive an eye.
MMM.
You know,
ask him,
I said,

736
00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:50.860
I'm doing the celebrity apprentice,
can it be one of my advisors?

737
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:53.320
He immediately said,
I don't want anything.
You want anything.

738
00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:57.130
You need any of my products that do promote or the setup a certain kind of a

739
00:44:57.131 --> 00:45:01.630
task.
Uh,
which then we ended up doing.
So he's just a wonderful human being.

740
00:45:01.631 --> 00:45:02.560
And a great,
great friend.

741
00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:07.470
<v 7>Damn Orle says the current state of modern bodybuilding versus Arnold's time.</v>

742
00:45:07.471 --> 00:45:12.390
What is your personal opinion on modern bodybuilding and your thoughts on

743
00:45:12.391 --> 00:45:14.520
steroid use?
If it's ever appropriate.

744
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:18.610
<v 5>If steroids,
a performance enhancing drug,</v>

745
00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:22.470
then I think Congress read now should take it immediately.

746
00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:27.000
So that's number one.
Number two,

747
00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:29.640
I think when you talk about bodybuilding,

748
00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:34.250
it's always important that we think about,

749
00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:39.760
is it the competitive world of bodybuilding or are we talking about in general

750
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:43.930
body building,
which means building the body through weight resistance.

751
00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.320
Let's talk first about the,
the,
the,
the,
the,

752
00:45:46.321 --> 00:45:49.990
the one for the ordinary people that are not interested in competing.

753
00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:51.460
I think that,
uh,

754
00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:56.680
the sport and the activity of bodybuilding has exploded in the last 40 years.

755
00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.060
I remembered that when I started out.

756
00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:04.360
People had a very negative attitude about bodybuilding and they thought that you

757
00:46:04.551 --> 00:46:08.530
will get muscle pound.
Uh,
they thought that you would turn gay and did,

758
00:46:08.531 --> 00:46:10.710
you will be stupid.
And uh,
you,
uh,

759
00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:15.050
it will become a narcissist hanging out in front of the mirror all the time and

760
00:46:15.051 --> 00:46:17.840
all of those kinds of things.
And did it,
is paid for your health.

761
00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:20.270
And doctors were wanting down to this,

762
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:24.500
coaches were wanting for athletes not to pick up any weights that you will get

763
00:46:24.501 --> 00:46:26.410
muscle bound and it will,
you know,

764
00:46:26.411 --> 00:46:29.510
reduce your performance and you get stiff and all of this stuff.

765
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:32.140
So that all has changed.

766
00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.000
Now you go 40 years forward

767
00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:41.430
and in his 40 years we have seen now that a weight resistance training is a

768
00:46:41.681 --> 00:46:44.340
totally accept that.
And uh,

769
00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:48.390
it's one of the number one activities in the world I'm in.

770
00:46:48.391 --> 00:46:50.400
Even now in hospitals,

771
00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:53.460
we're doctor said this is the worst thing for your health.

772
00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:58.700
Now when you have hospitals that have rehab rooms and facilities with vape

773
00:46:59.281 --> 00:47:00.090
machines,

774
00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:04.470
resistance machines and dumbbells and barbells and plates and pulleys and all

775
00:47:04.471 --> 00:47:09.140
kinds of things because they know this is the best way to recover and a,

776
00:47:09.141 --> 00:47:14.130
um,
to come back as quick as possible after injury or after surgery and so on.

777
00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:16.880
And uh,
the same thing is in athletics.

778
00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:19.850
There is not one single athlete that doesn't work out with weights.

779
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.470
If it is boxes,
UFC fighters,
if it is in a power as if it the scarf,

780
00:47:24.471 --> 00:47:26.480
as if his tennis players,
football players,

781
00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:30.490
every football team has a huge list way.
Drums,
every basketball

782
00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:34.390
<v 4>team of weight rooms,
every university has weight facilities.</v>

783
00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:39.240
Every high school is wade facilities.
Um,
every military base.
Did you go?
They've,

784
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:43.060
I mean,
I travel around and visit the military bases around the world.

785
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:47.530
They have hundreds of different bench press benches and a in a squat racks and

786
00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:50.680
to end heavyweights in machines in every sings of people.

787
00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:55.330
So there's men and women can train day and night in the gymnasium and get ready

788
00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:59.730
for those battles.
The weather's very risky kind of things.
Did they do,
uh,
the,

789
00:47:59.731 --> 00:48:02.940
the,
the,
the very,
very dangerous.
So they want to,

790
00:48:02.941 --> 00:48:06.460
everyone wants to be in shape and they know that the ultimate shape you get when

791
00:48:06.461 --> 00:48:11.290
you're also include weight training in your,
in your daily training.
So a,

792
00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:12.820
it is fantastic.

793
00:48:12.821 --> 00:48:17.080
We have seen the changes every hotel now when you travel around the world has

794
00:48:17.081 --> 00:48:18.850
all the weight also weighed facilities.

795
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:22.120
And when it comes to the competitive sport of bodybuilding,

796
00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:27.140
I have to say that there were huge progress.
There was huge progress made.
Uh,

797
00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:28.270
when I was competing,

798
00:48:28.271 --> 00:48:32.680
it was like 30 countries that had regular annual bodybuilding competitions.

799
00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:37.230
Now there's 192 countries that hold and,

800
00:48:37.231 --> 00:48:40.810
or bodybuilding competitions in the national competitions and orders.

801
00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:43.480
So that has grown.
Also the,
uh,

802
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:48.990
the only thing that that bothers me is the way we developed in professional body

803
00:48:50.421 --> 00:48:53.830
building.
The idea of body now has changed so much.

804
00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:55.720
The guys that are winning the day,

805
00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:59.610
I'm not looking anymore the way it,

806
00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.650
the ideal body was where people really admired and said,

807
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:06.880
I want to look like this.
Now they,
there's the Uif guys did a five,

808
00:49:06.881 --> 00:49:10.480
10 door at all and that weighs 300 pounds.

809
00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:14.820
They look more kind of like muscular power lifters and stage a lot of times than

810
00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:19.450
body builders or people that have really an attractive v shape,

811
00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:23.800
beautiful body.
So we got away from that.
And of course,
this is my opinion.

812
00:49:23.801 --> 00:49:27.040
Now there's others that feel differently about that.
And,
uh,

813
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:31.080
but this is a debate that we've been having now for the last 10 years in body

814
00:49:31.081 --> 00:49:31.660
building.

815
00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:36.640
How do we bring it back again and really idolize and make the winners look more

816
00:49:36.641 --> 00:49:40.660
attractive where they don't have to speak barely sticking out when they don't

817
00:49:40.661 --> 00:49:43.330
have this kind of block you kind of physics.

818
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:48.510
But to have a more athletic in the more kind of a thin waist wide shoulders and

819
00:49:48.611 --> 00:49:53.200
to have the biceps be the same measurement as the calves and us,
the neck,

820
00:49:53.201 --> 00:49:54.770
just the way it used to be.
Uh,

821
00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:57.820
people in the old days when they saw a picture of Steve Reeves,
they said,

822
00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:01.530
I want to look like that.
Or if this a picture of John Grim Muck,

823
00:50:01.531 --> 00:50:05.290
who warned Mr Universe in 1948,

824
00:50:05.291 --> 00:50:09.900
I think it was a,
he was a fantastic poser.
He was a,

825
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:14.230
he did acrobatics handstand Norris.
He was also extraordinary weightlifter.

826
00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:17.890
He could to muscle control people wanted to be John [inaudible].

827
00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:20.140
So that is really the ideal thing.

828
00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:24.940
And I think that eventually we have to get back to that again.
Um,
now,
of course,

829
00:50:24.941 --> 00:50:27.860
the bodies have developed,
the techniques have developed food supplements.

830
00:50:27.861 --> 00:50:30.140
If devout machines have developed to the bar is,

831
00:50:30.141 --> 00:50:32.510
are bigger and better than they were then,

832
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.450
but that does not mean that we have to have a,
you know,

833
00:50:35.451 --> 00:50:37.310
people look like monsters under stage.

834
00:50:37.311 --> 00:50:39.260
I think they should have a much more appealing party.

835
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:44.160
And that's why I think in bodybuilding we have now created other categories,
uh,

836
00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:47.780
which is,
you know,
Mr Fitness and uh,
Mr uh,

837
00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:52.100
natural and Mister [inaudible] and mister that to get away from this kind of

838
00:50:52.101 --> 00:50:57.050
block,
you look,
uh,
but bodybuilding is,
is,
you know,

839
00:50:57.230 --> 00:51:00.770
is booming and a lot of more people than ever are doing it.

840
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:05.420
Amman Budrow and says,
how do you think about risk?

841
00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:07.010
How would you train?

842
00:51:07.011 --> 00:51:11.600
Have you trained yourself to take better rests and increase your risk appetite?

843
00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:17.870
Well,
I think that,
uh,
the risks shouldn't be the goal.

844
00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:19.280
How do you take more risk?

845
00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:23.900
The goal should be that you envision your goal,

846
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:26.180
that you set a really high goal.

847
00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:31.600
And the only way you can set a high goal is if you are not afraid of failure.

848
00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:36.170
You have to take risks.
I mean,
the bottom line is,
is that,
uh,

849
00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:40.580
I mean when I think the amount of risks that I took to be where I am the day,

850
00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:44.840
and he was very risky to say that I'm wanting to be the bodybuilding champion of

851
00:51:44.841 --> 00:51:49.841
the world in a country where skiing was really the national sport of bicycling

852
00:51:50.061 --> 00:51:54.340
and stuff like that.
But you are not bodybuilding,
uh,
or weightlifting.
And,
uh,

853
00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:56.990
so the risk also for me to have go to come to America,

854
00:51:56.991 --> 00:51:59.780
it was a risk to go and say,
uh,
you know,

855
00:51:59.781 --> 00:52:01.250
that I'm going to get into the movie business,

856
00:52:01.251 --> 00:52:05.430
but let's just to get into the movie business,
but to become a leading man,
uh,

857
00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:09.980
or the run for governor of this,
I was able to just go and say,

858
00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:14.750
you know,
no matter what it takes and uh,
yes,
I may fail,

859
00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:18.930
but I'm going to go and take that risk and go for it.
And,
uh,
and,
and,

860
00:52:18.931 --> 00:52:21.620
and you know,
when you are,
the more risks that you take,

861
00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:27.020
the higher the reward is an end.
I mean just look at in the financial world,

862
00:52:27.021 --> 00:52:30.740
I mean if you make an investment that is a,
has no risk at all,

863
00:52:30.741 --> 00:52:32.550
and they do invest in bonds as I mean like that,

864
00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:36.290
there was very little return or we put your money in a bank.
If you're lucky,

865
00:52:36.291 --> 00:52:37.820
you get 2% interest.

866
00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:42.950
But if you take an investment that is risky,
then of course the,

867
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:47.780
the,
the risk could be that it fails,
but the upside is much,
much greater.

868
00:52:47.781 --> 00:52:51.290
So I am always the type of a person that is willing to take risks.

869
00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:56.560
And I think the key thing to success is not to be afraid of failure.

870
00:52:57.231 --> 00:53:01.190
As I said earlier,
that if you fail,
what's the worst that can happen?

871
00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:04.760
That you go and you get up and you do it again.

872
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:08.750
And he tried again and it try it again.
Uh,
there is no one that stops it.

873
00:53:08.751 --> 00:53:11.000
It's with the franchise,
the winners from the losers.

874
00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:14.870
I said earlier in the people that get up at the ones that are the winners.

875
00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:18.620
And so don't be afraid of taking risks.

876
00:53:18.621 --> 00:53:23.621
Don't be afraid of failing because that would just make you freeze up and you

877
00:53:23.751 --> 00:53:25.440
never gonna accomplish anything.

878
00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:30.620
So be free and just relax and just go and say that this is what life is all

879
00:53:31.201 --> 00:53:35.580
about us about is taking risks and go into set big because,

880
00:53:35.581 --> 00:53:37.560
and go for it.
End of story.

881
00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:41.820
Do you think a lot of your risk appetite came from things you learned in the
gym?

882
00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:44.340
What was it that they had a risk appetite.

883
00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:49.460
It was just that the learned from sports that you got to be able to take risk

884
00:53:51.091 --> 00:53:55.030
and you got to be in,
it should not be afraid of failing.
Uh,

885
00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:59.700
when you go to the,
when you're a lifter and you have in front of you,

886
00:53:59.701 --> 00:54:02.790
let's say it's 315 pounds,
I remember I was,

887
00:54:02.791 --> 00:54:07.791
this young kid were lifting weights and then you put on weight after the second

888
00:54:08.311 --> 00:54:12.330
lift for the third lift.
You always put on a way that you've never lifted before.

889
00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:17.100
So automatically you know that there's a 50 50 chance or whatever it is,

890
00:54:17.101 --> 00:54:21.300
the percentage that you're going to fail.
But,
and it is in front of people.

891
00:54:22.090 --> 00:54:26.160
Uh,
so they're in sports.
There's no embarrassment there that when you fail,

892
00:54:26.161 --> 00:54:30.090
it's understood that you'd like,
as I said about the,
the baseball player,

893
00:54:30.091 --> 00:54:34.740
but Ted Williams,
it is you,
you,
you will not be able to do always.

894
00:54:34.741 --> 00:54:37.540
Everything's successful.
So they actors of,

895
00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:42.330
I took the risk to lift the weight that have never lifted and to give you the

896
00:54:42.331 --> 00:54:42.921
shot that you have.

897
00:54:42.921 --> 00:54:46.800
Can I have to approach to wait with a positive attitude and think about I am

898
00:54:46.801 --> 00:54:49.560
going to do it,
but there's still a chance that you're not doing it.

899
00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:53.250
But that does not make me stop and not put that way down because it's the only

900
00:54:53.251 --> 00:54:56.520
way you're going to go and grow and get better and know really an aid,

901
00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:59.640
how much you can accomplish,
how much you can lift and so on.

902
00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:04.140
And this why it's a lesson that you learn in sports and it's a lesson that is

903
00:55:04.141 --> 00:55:07.830
good for the rest of your life and everything you do.
If it is movies,

904
00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:11.700
if it is business,
if it's investments,
if it is in politics,

905
00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:15.510
you got to take risks at dts.

906
00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:17.220
Sinhala says,

907
00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:21.540
how do you stay motivated to keep working on your goals and how do you not run

908
00:55:21.541 --> 00:55:26.110
out of juice or again,
it goes back to the vision.
I think that the,

909
00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.680
if you have a very clear vision of where you want to go,

910
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:32.330
you always will be motivated because I remembered that when I got an,

911
00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:37.340
from when I decided that I'm going to retire from bodybuilding competition and

912
00:55:37.741 --> 00:55:41.220
I'm going to get into acting.
I mean it was such a great vision.
Men,

913
00:55:41.221 --> 00:55:44.310
a thought about Clint Eastwood and the and another Clint Eastwood.

914
00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:49.440
I want to be like another Charles Branson.
This were my idols.

915
00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:51.150
I want to be like Warren Beatty.

916
00:55:51.151 --> 00:55:54.090
I want to be like those guys that are making $1 million.

917
00:55:54.091 --> 00:55:57.930
That was in the 70s now they made $1 million and moving in the same as if.
Wow.

918
00:55:57.931 --> 00:56:01.140
Can you imagine of working your way after that?

919
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:06.190
So to meet that vision was just so wonderful that I did everything that I could

920
00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:11.430
to get there.
And I was like working on,
you know,
uh,
my English,

921
00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:16.680
I was working on my speech and a annunciation.
Uh,

922
00:56:16.681 --> 00:56:20.880
I was taking acting classes,
I was doing everything that it could,

923
00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:23.130
improv classes and all this stuff.

924
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:26.680
<v 5>And I really work my way
by hard work,</v>

925
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:31.000
work my way up and slowly became,
uh,
know one of the top leading man.

926
00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:34.570
And so that is,
I think beat everything like that.
It's,
it's,
it's,

927
00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:38.800
it's you get motivated by your vision.
I remember,
you know,

928
00:56:38.801 --> 00:56:41.500
just with the environment we talked about earlier,

929
00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:46.890
I really envisioned a world that eventually will be clean and we will get rid of

930
00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:49.720
fossil fuels.
And so to me,

931
00:56:49.721 --> 00:56:53.620
that vision motivates me to go out and do speak about the environment,

932
00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:57.710
to travel around the world and to speak about environment,
to use my,
uh,

933
00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:02.760
USC Schwarzenegger Institute and to go and promote a clean environment and all

934
00:57:03.381 --> 00:57:06.340
of those things.
So it's,
it's kind of the vision that motivates you.

935
00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:09.970
So I don't run out of choose because of that because you know,

936
00:57:09.971 --> 00:57:11.650
that has nothing to do with age at all.

937
00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:16.420
It's the always big new goals and it didn't go after those goals and that's what

938
00:57:16.421 --> 00:57:18.430
motivates you and that's what makes it exciting.

939
00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:22.450
That's what makes you passionate about it.
Christian Gray says,

940
00:57:22.451 --> 00:57:27.451
what specific things did you look for in your real estate investments of the

941
00:57:27.671 --> 00:57:31.360
turn?
$1 into two.
There was a number one goal and the number two goal was,

942
00:57:31.361 --> 00:57:34.760
is that it has to be interesting.
I didn't like to invest,

943
00:57:34.761 --> 00:57:38.950
just enroll lantern to sit on it and to sell it five years later for profit.

944
00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:40.420
To me that was not exciting.

945
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:45.070
What was exciting was is to buy raw land and then the trough plants and to go

946
00:57:45.071 --> 00:57:48.550
and build an apartment building or to build an office building or build a

947
00:57:48.551 --> 00:57:53.170
shopping mall,
uh,
and,
and to find the right partners that you bring together.

948
00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:57.430
And the go all outfitted.
And I remember that,
uh,
you know,
my first,

949
00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:59.650
uh,
investment,

950
00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:04.890
it was back in 1974 I saved up $27,000 from doing seminars in the exhibitions,

951
00:58:08.261 --> 00:58:11.430
in all kinds of things,
and a mail order business at it.

952
00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:16.440
Bricklaying jobs and dollar after dollar I saved up until I had $27,000.

953
00:58:17.650 --> 00:58:20.650
And I have to say that to people understand,
embody building,

954
00:58:20.651 --> 00:58:22.690
even though in 1974,

955
00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:27.340
I was already a multi them Mr Olympia and Mister Universe five times in the

956
00:58:27.341 --> 00:58:29.510
midst of world and all those things.
But in Party building,

957
00:58:29.530 --> 00:58:33.110
there was no money at this point.
So I had to do it,
uh,
the,

958
00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:37.360
the old fashioned way I had to kind of earn it at to go to work and to do it.

959
00:58:37.630 --> 00:58:39.910
And I saved up $27,000,

960
00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:45.120
found an apartment building a six unit apartment building in Santa Monica north

961
00:58:46.271 --> 00:58:49.880
of Wilshire Boulevard,
which was very important to be north of worship,
all of it,

962
00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:52.060
good area.
And uh,

963
00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:57.420
I bought it for $215,000 and they needed $37,000 down.

964
00:58:58.361 --> 00:59:03.361
So I went to Joe Weeder demanded was then the king of the bodybuilding empire

965
00:59:03.581 --> 00:59:04.810
and propaganda America.

966
00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:09.490
And he gave me $10,000 and it was kind of the third deed and his thing.

967
00:59:09.491 --> 00:59:14.230
And I paid him back within a year.
Uh,
but they had the $37,000 together,

968
00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:19.290
bought the apartment building and then two and a half years later we sold it for

969
00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:23.280
$365,000.

970
00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:28.760
And so imagine the profit from two 15 to three 65 in two and a half years and

971
00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:33.890
only bootleg 37 down.
So,
so huge,
huge profit.

972
00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:37.460
And I remembered that are found in a 12 unit apartment building.

973
00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:41.150
And we then sold the,
the,
the,
the six unit one,

974
00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:43.330
then roll the money over,

975
00:59:43.570 --> 00:59:48.570
bought the 12 unit one and then the next one was a 36 unit and they got bigger

976
00:59:48.761 --> 00:59:52.970
and bigger.
And then I had apartments all over the place instead of the,
you know,

977
00:59:52.971 --> 00:59:57.690
building office buildings and shopping malls and stuff like that.
So it really,

978
00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:59.360
to me,
the key thing is,

979
00:59:59.361 --> 01:00:02.790
is that it's fun that is challenging that you go and map it out.

980
01:00:02.791 --> 01:00:06.390
Did you find out when you get into an area and the Pi or property that,

981
01:00:06.391 --> 01:00:08.640
what kind of,
uh,
apartments to the need?

982
01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:13.080
What kind of sizes and it's mean it's a two years in this area or just one unit.

983
01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:16.530
And what kind of shops do you want to have downstairs in your office building?

984
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:20.640
What kind of a look?
Who Do you want to attract?
So the meat,

985
01:00:20.641 --> 01:00:22.290
that whole thing was really a lot of fun

986
01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:24.640
<v 3>just so we're 100% clear.</v>

987
01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:28.480
Did you buy the six unit apartment building before you'd ever bought a house?

988
01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:30.141
<v 5>Do me,</v>

989
01:00:30.141 --> 01:00:35.060
it is much more important when you buy your first real estate to buy a rental

990
01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:38.710
apartment.
A does is an income property.
Uh,

991
01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:42.420
because I had the front unit it,
his apartment building,

992
01:00:42.421 --> 01:00:44.490
which they called the owner's unit.

993
01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.490
It was 2,400 square feet,

994
01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:50.790
which was plenty for me at that time upstairs,
downstairs.

995
01:00:50.791 --> 01:00:55.370
And there was five units in the bag and it was a great,
great investment,
right?

996
01:00:55.540 --> 01:01:00.540
But I would not go and buy a house first before I buy an income property.

997
01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.240
So the meat,
that was the important thing.

998
01:01:02.241 --> 01:01:07.000
That's what I always recommend to people to buy first income property and to go

999
01:01:07.001 --> 01:01:08.590
and make it a good investment.

1000
01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:12.690
And once they should realize when it comes to real estate,

1001
01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:17.720
if you invest wisely and if it is in the good area and stuff like that,

1002
01:01:17.831 --> 01:01:22.000
and it's a growing area,
uh,
it's never caught spending money.

1003
01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:27.560
There's a difference between spending money and investing money in real estate.

1004
01:01:27.711 --> 01:01:32.540
You invest because the money it goes up,
the value goes up in most cases.

1005
01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.860
And uh,
when you buy furniture that spending money,

1006
01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:40.350
because as soon as you take the furniture out of the front of your shop,

1007
01:01:40.690 --> 01:01:45.240
you lose the magic dramatically right off the top 30% in.
So that spending money,

1008
01:01:45.241 --> 01:01:46.680
you will never get that money back.

1009
01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:50.710
<v 3>So you were talking earlier about the raw land,</v>

1010
01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:53.180
about your worst investment,

1011
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:58.500
what the supersonic airport that never happened.
Do you want to explain that one?

1012
01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:01.980
<v 5>Where does what I said,
Roland,
uh,
is not really a,
you know,</v>

1013
01:02:01.981 --> 01:02:03.810
a fun thing to do to invest in.

1014
01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:08.360
I invested in my first investment when they came to America was enrolled land,

1015
01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:13.640
but I invested in that because it was in Palmdale,
Lancaster area.

1016
01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:19.030
And there,
there was a very well known,

1017
01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.060
everyone wrote about it,
uh,

1018
01:02:21.110 --> 01:02:25.830
that they're going to build a supersonic airport and that the day was the future

1019
01:02:25.831 --> 01:02:30.120
to move away from the Los Angeles airport and to,
to move in in the end,

1020
01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:34.620
create a new giant airport for supersonic planes.
And uh,

1021
01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:38.880
then they outlawed supersonic planes and they are put,
there was never built.

1022
01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:41.460
And so now I still own the property,

1023
01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:46.820
but even this $5,000 property that apart then now is worth $680,000.

1024
01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:53.310
So I cannot call this our laws.
This is something that my kids will inherit in.

1025
01:02:53.311 --> 01:02:56.860
We'll have a good time and can sell it.
And if some money still,

1026
01:02:57.050 --> 01:03:00.330
it's still right now in the mean that they've put streets in there and the

1027
01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:04.260
electricity and uh,
and,
and you know,
eventually the day area will be build up,

1028
01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:08.640
but it's not definitely not going to be a supersonic airport.
Jerry Potter says,

1029
01:03:08.641 --> 01:03:13.470
if you are allowed to make one la remove one law or amend one law in this

1030
01:03:13.471 --> 01:03:17.610
country,
which law would you choose and why?
Well,
first of all,

1031
01:03:17.611 --> 01:03:20.940
let me just say the abacus law is,
I think what this question is,
is,

1032
01:03:20.941 --> 01:03:25.941
is referring to is would I like to change the law so that there are foreign born

1033
01:03:26.610 --> 01:03:29.910
can also run for president?
Yes,
of course there would create that law.

1034
01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:33.910
But besides that,
that's an obvious one.
It's a,
it's a no brainer,
but it mean,
uh,

1035
01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:34.160
the,

1036
01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:38.100
the other law I think will be really interesting in that is if the legislature

1037
01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:43.520
ends the lawmakers in Washington to not perform and really down south to kind of

1038
01:03:43.951 --> 01:03:48.690
critical problems.
If it's immigration reform,
if it is a environmental,
uh,

1039
01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:53.720
in activities where we really shoot four in a 40 or 50% of renewable energy and

1040
01:03:54.151 --> 01:03:57.630
reduce our greenhouse gases,
best certain percentage,
uh,
in,

1041
01:03:57.631 --> 01:03:59.560
in the next 10 years or so.
Uh,

1042
01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:04.080
if we don't accomplish those things and build the infrastructure and all dead,

1043
01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.330
they all should be voted out of office.

1044
01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:11.310
I think we should start all over again because I think how long can America hang

1045
01:04:11.311 --> 01:04:15.540
there with no action?
How many decades now have we talked about?

1046
01:04:15.541 --> 01:04:18.420
Did we need to build our infrastructure?
There'd be,

1047
01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:21.210
have now so many more cars and a route.

1048
01:04:21.211 --> 01:04:24.900
Therefore we need to build more highways and freeways and we need to build high

1049
01:04:24.901 --> 01:04:29.420
speed rail all over the country.
Uh,
we need to build out our airports.

1050
01:04:29.421 --> 01:04:31.410
So they'd been,
you arrived as here,
but they don't look,

1051
01:04:31.411 --> 01:04:34.650
some of them like third world country airports and stuff like that.

1052
01:04:34.890 --> 01:04:38.340
We need to build more dames and with water storage,
I mean,
they,

1053
01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:40.830
in California for instance,
I mean,
uh,
it's,
uh,

1054
01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:44.670
it is a dreadful when to talk about the trout when I've been in fact really,

1055
01:04:44.970 --> 01:04:48.480
it just means that we have not built the infrastructure to capture the water

1056
01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:52.230
when it rains and then have it windows or drought and stuff like that.

1057
01:04:52.231 --> 01:04:56.730
So I think the legislators,
the lawmakers have to perform for the people.

1058
01:04:56.970 --> 01:05:01.410
That's why they're there.
It costs us in a two and a half billion dollars,

1059
01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:05.260
uh,
to do,
to have them there on capitol and a,

1060
01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:10.280
so they got to perform and they got to recognize the fact that not one party can

1061
01:05:10.951 --> 01:05:12.480
solve the problem.
Did you,

1062
01:05:12.481 --> 01:05:17.440
the way it is designed is that Democrats and Republicans must work together that

1063
01:05:17.441 --> 01:05:19.440
no law,
okay.
Can,
you know,

1064
01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:23.490
sustain for a long period of time if he's just dump at one party or the other,

1065
01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:26.570
both of the parties in receipt.
Now with Obamacare,

1066
01:05:26.571 --> 01:05:30.440
I mean where they was only done by Democrats and now it's going to get undone,

1067
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:35.080
uh,
or you know,
executive orders,
uh,
that are just going to be thrown out,

1068
01:05:35.081 --> 01:05:38.170
but the next president always.
So that is not really a solution.

1069
01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:41.590
The solution is if Democrats and Republicans worked together,

1070
01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:43.570
even though this is very difficult to do,

1071
01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:48.670
but that's why they are going to Washington to take on this very difficult task.

1072
01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:51.470
And,
uh,
look,
I had to work together.
Remember,

1073
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:55.850
California was an overwhelming amount of democratic legislators in,

1074
01:05:55.851 --> 01:05:59.780
I had to work with them.
I was surrounded by a democratic lieutenant governor,

1075
01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:04.960
a democratic,
uh,
uh,
treasurer,
a controller.
Uh,

1076
01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:08.990
you know,
the head of education.
Everyone was the attorney general.

1077
01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:10.500
Every one was a Democrat in,

1078
01:06:10.501 --> 01:06:14.400
somehow I made it work so that get at least 50% of all those things did they

1079
01:06:14.401 --> 01:06:18.790
wanted to do,
I got done and then some things we failed.
But I mean,

1080
01:06:18.791 --> 01:06:19.900
the bottom line is,

1081
01:06:19.901 --> 01:06:24.030
is they must work for the people and it got to get the act together.

1082
01:06:24.090 --> 01:06:27.540
Otherwise there should be a law that they will get voted out of office.

1083
01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:30.090
<v 8>So they have to show the accomplishments or they all go,</v>

1084
01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:32.380
<v 5>oh,
they'll go home.
Yeah.
And now someone will say,</v>

1085
01:06:32.381 --> 01:06:35.170
well that's why we have elections every four years and that's why we have

1086
01:06:35.171 --> 01:06:37.580
elections for Congress every two years.
And that's when it is.

1087
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:40.840
But that's not the way it works because they all go home is as well.

1088
01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:43.720
I did really well,
but the others,
you know,

1089
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:47.860
but it's inexcusable that Congress is like a 14 or 15% approval rating.

1090
01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:52.060
I mean that's worse than the approval rating of Fidel Castro of aids or

1091
01:06:52.061 --> 01:06:55.630
something like that.
I mean,
what the hell are we talking about here?
Says let's,

1092
01:06:55.631 --> 01:06:58.020
let's get our act together.
The potential is the,

1093
01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:01.840
they have some smart people in Washington,
Democrats and Republicans alike.

1094
01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:05.300
They should work together and do something that is really good for the country.

1095
01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.870
<v 8>And you're talking about getting them to actually work together.</v>

1096
01:07:07.871 --> 01:07:09.360
It sounds like maybe we need a lot of that.

1097
01:07:09.370 --> 01:07:12.160
They have to schmooze together like you did an a cigar time.

1098
01:07:12.310 --> 01:07:13.510
<v 5>Well remember that the,</v>

1099
01:07:13.511 --> 01:07:17.850
we cannot do things just all the way on the riot or auto on the left.
Uh,

1100
01:07:17.851 --> 01:07:22.530
I believe of what Eisenhower said.
Uh,
President Eisenhower said,
uh,
you know,

1101
01:07:22.531 --> 01:07:27.050
always that,
uh,
politics is like the road,
you know,

1102
01:07:27.051 --> 01:07:28.220
the left and the right.

1103
01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:32.710
It's the gutter and the center is drivable and that's exactly the way it's in

1104
01:07:32.711 --> 01:07:34.490
politics.
He says,
did you get to be in a,

1105
01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:37.420
sandy cannot be an extremist to the left to the right

1106
01:07:37.850 --> 01:07:39.320
<v 8>David Paul,
it says,</v>

1107
01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:44.321
how did you drum up business when you own that construction company with Franco

1108
01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.090
Columbo?

1109
01:07:45.090 --> 01:07:47.470
<v 5>Well,
the important thing was,
okay,</v>

1110
01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:52.730
dead Franco Columbo was my training partner for the last 50 years and a very,

1111
01:07:55.061 --> 01:07:57.580
very dear friend and he was a bricklayer.

1112
01:07:58.030 --> 01:08:00.550
And so it because in bodybuilding we didn't make any money.

1113
01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.250
So we decided that we're going to go and start a little,

1114
01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:08.040
little small bricklaying business where we go to people's homes and we fix up

1115
01:08:08.041 --> 01:08:09.060
things to the broken.

1116
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:15.240
We were very fortunate because we started the business and got our license

1117
01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:19.040
license and when did the IRS and told them about the company.

1118
01:08:19.041 --> 01:08:20.330
And does it attacks us,

1119
01:08:20.331 --> 01:08:23.660
they'd be going to have to pay in order kind of thing and organized orders.

1120
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:27.810
And then we went out and started working and we started getting jobs into the

1121
01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:30.960
build walls and Patios and fireplaces,
not as a,

1122
01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:36.160
and then all of a sudden the earthquake happened in 1971 and it was a massive

1123
01:08:37.041 --> 01:08:39.860
earthquake that just wiped of a lot of things.
And uh,

1124
01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:42.710
so we got from one day to the next leg,

1125
01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:47.840
hundreds of phone calls that come into give estimates ant to go into rebuild,

1126
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:52.700
uh,
the patios and the walls and fireplaces and chimneys and all kinds of things.

1127
01:08:52.790 --> 01:08:57.230
So we literally had to hire other people from the gym,
bodybuilders from the gym.

1128
01:08:57.410 --> 01:09:01.040
And all of a sudden we had this whole workforce and we started going to work and

1129
01:09:01.041 --> 01:09:03.950
we made great money.
I'm in not great,
great money,

1130
01:09:03.951 --> 01:09:06.350
but I mean good money for fun for those days.

1131
01:09:06.710 --> 01:09:08.900
And we could save some money and uh,

1132
01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:13.250
by our protein powders and we're able to eat,
you know,

1133
01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:18.350
great into the stake center and half hour bro Protein shakes in eggs,

1134
01:09:18.351 --> 01:09:23.180
in the best foods in order to stuff they'd be needed.
And uh,
so I,

1135
01:09:23.181 --> 01:09:24.350
uh,
you know,

1136
01:09:24.351 --> 01:09:28.040
we had a very successful business and he was the greatest thing that the most

1137
01:09:28.041 --> 01:09:31.860
fun doing those kind of things.
And we just put a little ad in the La Times.

1138
01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:36.590
I member in that ad produced in no really great,
great action for us.

1139
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:38.870
The Ad,
just basic,

1140
01:09:38.871 --> 01:09:43.871
you said a European brick layers and masonry workers and stone experts,

1141
01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:50.240
you know,
because people be realized very quickly that the American people loved.

1142
01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.580
When you get,
you know,
kind of work,
uh,

1143
01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:58.630
from other countries and they love to mention Swedish massage if you will give

1144
01:09:59.571 --> 01:10:03.290
American massage debrand and sell as well as when you say Swedish massage or

1145
01:10:03.291 --> 01:10:08.180
Japanese massage or Europe in brick layer or a German car,

1146
01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.630
uh,
you know,
mechanic or something like that would be,

1147
01:10:11.631 --> 01:10:13.050
I remember when I came over here and the,

1148
01:10:13.051 --> 01:10:16.590
someone said to me is bringing car down there to Lincoln Boulevard.
There is a,

1149
01:10:16.591 --> 01:10:21.350
there's a little garage,
there's a German mechanic.
I mean dead guy is so good.

1150
01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:24.310
He'll be in a,
I went down and got my car down there.

1151
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:28.420
He was any better than American
mechanic,

1152
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:33.290
but I mean people just love the European or some other forum kind of a country

1153
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:38.000
and a,
so we use that European bricklayer and stonework.
And there you have been,

1154
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:42.800
uh,
you know,
experts in order to kind of a language used and it worked.

1155
01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:48.020
That's good.
Branding,
chip Franks.
And this is our last question.
Says,

1156
01:10:48.230 --> 01:10:52.730
could you take Tim Ferriss in a one on one fight right now?

1157
01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:56.450
If so,
how long would it take?
Well,
first of all,

1158
01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:58.730
easy use Tim Ferriss,

1159
01:10:58.731 --> 01:11:03.731
even though he does his Jujitsu and stuff like that and he's in fantastic shape,

1160
01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:07.880
but I'm a machine,
let's not forget that.

1161
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:13.330
And plus let's also not forget he cannot hit me because it will be elderly

1162
01:11:13.981 --> 01:11:14.814
abuse.

1163
01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:20.730
So therefore I would just grab him and I would just put the,

1164
01:11:20.731 --> 01:11:23.940
finish him off with a five minutes kind of a routine.

1165
01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:27.880
And then an angel say the Lavista baby.

1166
01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:33.280
Do you have any closing advice for his listeners?
Uh,

1167
01:11:33.650 --> 01:11:38.450
first of all,
I think that is one of the best,
uh,
uh,
podcasts.

1168
01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.230
Uh,
because it,
they're always interesting.
They always exciting.
Uh,

1169
01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:46.060
every time he listened to his a podcast,
you'll learn.

1170
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:50.230
And I think that's what it's all about.
We got to always learn and,
and,

1171
01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:54.110
and listen to interesting material because I think this is always the challenge

1172
01:11:54.111 --> 01:11:59.111
and he being that he's such a hungry guy that always also wants to learn.

1173
01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:04.050
Uh,
he is so motivated to go into,
uh,

1174
01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:07.320
put out information and like his latest book.
You know,
what,

1175
01:12:07.321 --> 01:12:08.750
what makes you success for,

1176
01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:13.780
what are the kind of a little tricks that successful people use in orders of.

1177
01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.760
So he's always educating everybody and that's what I like about it.

1178
01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:22.180
<v 1>Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

1179
01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:25.150
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1180
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:28.420
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1181
01:12:28.450 --> 01:12:32.590
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

1182
01:12:32.591 --> 01:12:36.160
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

1183
01:12:36.161 --> 01:12:40.480
short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

1184
01:12:40.481 --> 01:12:41.770
pondering over the week.

1185
01:12:42.010 --> 01:12:44.770
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1186
01:12:44.771 --> 01:12:48.250
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1187
01:12:48.251 --> 01:12:52.540
somehow dug up in the,
uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1188
01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:57.840
It could include a favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

1189
01:12:58.511 --> 01:13:01.240
close friends,
for instance.
And it's very short.

1190
01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:06.280
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend,

1191
01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:08.500
so if you want to receive that,
check it out.

1192

This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.

1195
01:13:22.090 --> 01:13:25.240
I've used athletic Greens for many,
many years and I'm asked all the time,

1196
01:13:25.241 --> 01:13:27.910
if you could use only one supplement,
what would it be?

1197
01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:30.670
My answer is inevitably athletic Greens.

1198
01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:34.540
It is my all in one nutritional insurance,
at least that's how I think about it.

1199
01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:36.370
It is much more than Greens.

1200
01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:40.990
It's a complete whole food supplement with 75 or so ingredients packed into one

1201
01:13:40.991 --> 01:13:43.390
tablespoon per day.
So when I travel,
for instance,

1202
01:13:44.050 --> 01:13:47.590
of course I would like to follow all of my regimens,
all of my pills,

1203
01:13:47.591 --> 01:13:49.390
all of my cell phone's off my food to the tee,

1204
01:13:49.391 --> 01:13:54.391
but sometimes circumstances intervened and you're too busy or things are too

1205
01:13:54.791 --> 01:13:55.624
hectic.

1206
01:13:55.780 --> 01:14:00.780
This helps me to mitigate the likelihood of getting sick and to perform

1207
01:14:00.851 --> 01:14:04.390
optimally.
So if I go to say South America for an Acro Yoga intensive,

1208
01:14:04.391 --> 01:14:05.500
which I did in Columbia,

1209
01:14:05.501 --> 01:14:08.290
at one point I was running around like a chicken with its head cut off,

1210
01:14:08.291 --> 01:14:13.030
and I took this every morning and it is extremely helpful and I usually travel

1211
01:14:13.031 --> 01:14:15.010
with a travel packets among other things.

1212
01:14:15.011 --> 01:14:19.390
So you should try it out is the short version of this.

1213
01:14:19.391 --> 01:14:20.800
As listeners of the Tim Ferriss show,

1214
01:14:20.801 --> 01:14:25.720
you can receive $100 worth of travel packs for free when you order.

1215
01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:29.170
That's 20 free additional individual travel pouches when you ordered.

1216
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:33.280
Simply go to athleticgreens.com forward slash Tim to check it out.

1217
01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:38.760
So take a look athleticgreens.com forward slash Tim this episode is brought to

1218
01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:42.340
you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor.

1219
01:14:42.730 --> 01:14:47.110
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way.
Set it and forget it.

1220
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:51.490
Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous

1221
01:14:51.491 --> 01:14:52.240
investors.

1222
01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:55.930
It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than

1223
01:14:55.931 --> 01:14:58.930
two and a half billion dollars under management.
In fact,

1224
01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:00.310
some of my very good friends,

1225
01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:03.490
investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront,

1226
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:06.820
so the question is why?
Why is it so popular?
Why is it unique?

1227
01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:10.870
Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

1228
01:15:10.871 --> 01:15:12.820
pay pennies on the dollar for them,

1229
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:16.600
and this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations,

1230
01:15:16.601 --> 01:15:19.330
bloated sales teams,
et Cetera,
and I'll come back to that in a second.

1231
01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:24.490
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk

1232
01:15:24.491 --> 01:15:25.241
assessment quiz,

1233
01:15:25.241 --> 01:15:29.140
which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for free exactly the

1234
01:15:29.141 --> 01:15:32.080
portfolio they'd put you in.
And if you just want to take their advice,

1235
01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.470
run with it,
do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

1236
01:15:35.471 --> 01:15:37.390
you can set it and forget it.
Here's why.

1237
01:15:37.690 --> 01:15:41.680
The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that

1238
01:15:41.681 --> 01:15:45.070
investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't.

1239
01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:47.740
Great investing is a marathon,
not a sprint,

1240
01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:51.430
and little things that you may or may not be familiar with like automatic tax

1241
01:15:51.431 --> 01:15:53.560
loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

1242
01:15:53.710 --> 01:15:58.060
cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large

1243
01:15:58.061 --> 01:16:01.780
amounts of money over longer periods of time.
Wealthfront,
as I mentioned,

1244
01:16:01.781 --> 01:16:04.390
since it's using software instead of retail locations,

1245
01:16:04.391 --> 01:16:08.560
etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely

1246
01:16:08.561 --> 01:16:10.150
impossible right off the bat,

1247
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:12.610
you never pay commissions or account fees for everything.

1248
01:16:12.611 --> 01:16:17.611
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for

1249
01:16:18.251 --> 01:16:20.290
free.
If you use my link,

1250
01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:24.640
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim that is less than $5 a month to invest a

1251
01:16:24.641 --> 01:16:28.720
$30,000 account for instance.
Now,
normally when I have a sponsor on this show,

1252
01:16:28.721 --> 01:16:32.230
it's because I use them and recommend them.
In this case,
it's a little different.

1253
01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:36.550
I don't use Wealthfront yet because I'm not allowed to.
Here's the deal.

1254
01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.810
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of sec regulations,

1255
01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:44.500
companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials.

1256
01:16:44.501 --> 01:16:47.290
So I couldn't be a user and have them on the podcast,

1257
01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:51.430
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant

1258
01:16:51.431 --> 01:16:55.240
amount of my own money,
at least for me,
uh,
in the team and the company itself.

1259
01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:58.360
So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client.

1260
01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:01.930
Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

1261
01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:05.770
you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account.

1262
01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:08.800
But just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you.

1263
01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:09.641
Take two minutes,

1264
01:17:09.641 --> 01:17:14.350
fill out their questionnaire@wealthfront.com slash Tim it's fast,
it's free.

1265
01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:16.120
There's no downside that I can think of.
