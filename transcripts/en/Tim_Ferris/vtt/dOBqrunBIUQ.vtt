1
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:02.843
Hey,
what's up guys?

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.740
This is Tim Ferriss and I guess you know that since you're tuning into this
feed,

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.140
this is day three.
I'm going to shave this off soon.
Had a good year of writing.

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.030
I had to take my pup,

5
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:19.950
Molly to the vet because she had a very serious laceration on her foot that

6
00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:22.020
required stitches.
So general anesthesia,

7
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.620
which interrupted a bit of the writing since I'm working on the book,

8
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.650
but was able to get out of pretty decent draft of the introduction of the new

9
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:35.304
book,

10
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.340
which I cut down from about 6,000 words to 4,600.

11
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.350
So it's still a very long introduction,
15 pages,

12
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.190
something like that.
Uh,
so that is it

13
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.040
Steve.
How's Molly?
She's doing better.
She's,
uh,
she's right there.

14
00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.330
I took the,
uh,

15
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.620
I took the coat off cone of shame off of her and she hasn't been fussing with

16
00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:08.060
her foot.
I've,
I've covered it up.
Um,
and uh,

17
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.800
so far she seems to be behaving.
Uh,
all right.

18
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.250
Let's see.
Often the rocky,
no interaction.
Don't know who that is.

19
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.520
A,
can I recommend any books on public speaking?

20
00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:27.360
There's a new book out by Chris Anderson About Ted,
uh,

21
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.590
and how people prepare for that,
which I think might be worth reading.

22
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:34.460
I haven't read it my yet,
my myself yet.
You Jason Bourne movie.
I haven't seen it.

23
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.670
Uh,
I have a dad bod.

24
00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:41.210
Does the Geek to freak in a low carb diet or slow carb diet?
It's still work.

25
00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:42.170
Yes it does.

26
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.570
Although I wouldn't do geek to freak and low carb,
uh,

27
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.840
necessarily combined all.
You certainly could.

28
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:55.700
I would do kettlebell swings and a gymnastic strength training.

29
00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:59.920
So listen to my recent podcast as coach summer.
Uh,

30
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.710
let's see.
Am I ever involved with real estate?
Yes I am.

31
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.320
I've invested primarily in startups,

32
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.080
real estate and cash or cash,
like a quick ones.
That is,

33
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.120
uh,
that is my current set up.
Uh,

34
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.670
my take on taking modafinil.

35
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.100
I've tried modafinil a number of times.
Uh,

36
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.630
I think that it has biological cost.
It can be very tired afterwards.

37
00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:30.320
At least that's been my experience.
Uh,

38
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.670
let's see.

39
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

40
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.870
<v 0>Stranger things.
I have not seen that</v>

41
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.590
somebody said for fuck's sake.
Tim,
you woke me up.
If I woke you up,

42
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.970
then you shouldn't have notifications or push notifications on your phone

43
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.460
enabled.
Uh,

44
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.850
if I had one question I could ask myself in the mirror,
what would I ask?

45
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.190
Probably what would it look like if it were easy?

46
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.340
Whenever you're thinking about whatever you're working on,

47
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.130
whatever's stressing you out,
what would it look like if it were easy?

48
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.930
Recommend some music please.
Um,

49
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.400
sure.
Uh,
Brazilian singer.

50
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:19.960
Say you see you Molly millennia.
Check that out.

51
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.980
Uh,
okay.
Myers Briggs personality.

52
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.820
I have been told I'm an eye and Tga,
but I've never taken a test.

53
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.930
Whoever's asking about tre have no idea what that is.

54
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.830
Best Tips for making a successful youtube channel.

55
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.570
I would listen to Casey Neistat and Shay.
Carl on my podcast.

56
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.480
They both have whatever it is.
500 million,

57
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.230
2.3 billion views.
I do not.
So I'm not the right person to ask.

58
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.870
Hangover.
Cure your drunk right now.
Ah,

59
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.850
you could try Burton toast or active charcoal and uh,

60
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.030
definitely hydrate and get a little bit of salt.

61
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.800
Potassium helps eat an avocado and a drink.

62
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:07.660
Plenty of water for you.
Go to bed.

63
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.200
Uh,
best workout routine for an absolute beginner without equipment.

64
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.990
Um,
you know,
it depends on your objectives obviously I should say.

65
00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:22.870
But yeah,

66
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.170
make a tea bar search tea bar,
which is a type of kettle bell.
It's a t bar,

67
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.650
kettlebell construction and uh,

68
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.520
for probably 10 bucks you could make something approximately and Kettlebell.
Uh,

69
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.350
otherwise I would say gymnastics,
strength training.

70
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.540
Not to sound redundant,
but there you go.

71
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.790
Oh,
I thought it's an aspirin.
I take baby aspirin every day,
uh,

72
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.840
as per recommendations from one doc that I do trust quite a bit based on my

73
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:05.200
genetic profile and the fact that my father has had a heart attack.
Yes.

74
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:09.340
Idea of cardiac disease in my family.
Favorite,

75
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.640
a favorite Olympic event?
Probably gymnastics at this point,

76
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.970
although I do love some funny ones.

77
00:05:15.971 --> 00:05:20.920
I mean I enjoy boxing figure skating,
tennis is tennis,

78
00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:24.700
more big sport.
I do enjoy watching tennis though.
Um,

79
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.540
sensory deprivation tanks.
Yes.
I have tried a DNA angle,

80
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:31.480
talks about it quite a bit in the podcast I do with him.

81
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.380
I'm going to do a couple more and then I'm going to bed guys,

82
00:05:35.381 --> 00:05:40.030
cause it's been a very long day.
Do I use essential oils?
Believe it or not.
I do.

83
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.070
This is recent.
This is a,
I just started after my podcast with Nicholas McCarthy.

84
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:50.071
So you can actually see that I have an essential oil diffuser right there.

85
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.580
And I've been using Geranium,
which is what Nicholas McCarthy uses.

86
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.670
Let's see,
what the fuck is tre?

87
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.290
Transcendental meditation tree.
I have no idea what that is.

88
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.700
Trembling maybe if that,
if that's your question.
I'm not using Trimble out.

89
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.720
Uh,
caffeine and lt and Ian,
if I combine those I get,

90
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.040
I actually feel agitated so I don't do it.
Uh,

91
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.140
is it worth booking up?
Eating an extra thousand calories a day,

92
00:06:26.141 --> 00:06:30.340
decreases your lifespan?
That's a personal question up to you to decide.

93
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.210
A neat,
you're welcome for the younger interview.
He's amazing.

94
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.220
What do I think ty Lopez don't know anything about them?

95
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.820
So I don't have an opinion.
Uh,

96
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.950
let's see.
Kyoto,
Kyoto and then,

97
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.610
so one thing I believe to be the most critical and doing public presentations,

98
00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.290
knowing your strengths.

99
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.320
So I know that I'm not the most flamboyant or compelling performer,

100
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.390
so to speak as a speaker.

101
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.870
So I focused on teaching and I'm very upfront with that.

102
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.290
I said I'm not going to be the most exciting speaker to watch,

103
00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:16.810
but I'll try to throw it a little bit of Hebrew,
but more than anything else,

104
00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:21.811
I will try to give you more actionable takeaways in the next 30 minutes than

105
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.130
I've ever given before.
And really focus on specific action.
We'll take away.
Uh,

106
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.160
I always break my presentations into three sections are typically into three

107
00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:37.060
sections and you can actually Google how I prepare for public speaking.

108
00:07:37.061 --> 00:07:39.640
So how Tim Ferriss or Tim Ferriss,

109
00:07:39.641 --> 00:07:44.350
how I prepare for public speaking every time,
something like that.

110
00:07:44.351 --> 00:07:49.150
And you'll get a whole list.
Uh,
all rights

111
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.870
guys,
I'm going to go to bed,

112
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.620
it's late and I have some people in my house that I need to attend to.

113
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.130
So I'm going to let you get going.

114
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.880
And since this is a supposed to be a daily Vlog,

115
00:08:03.881 --> 00:08:06.280
we'll fuck.
I guess I'll be seeing you guys tomorrow.

116
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:09.550
Have a good one.
