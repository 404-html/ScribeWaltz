1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.991
Tim ferriss here,

2
00:00:00.991 --> 00:00:05.400
author of the four hour work week for our body for our shift tools of titans and

3
00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:06.570
so on and so forth.

4
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.920
I talk a lot about stoic philosophy and I've had a lot of questions about stoke

5
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:11.311
philosophy.

6
00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:15.900
I've produced audio books about stoic philosophy which have made their way into

7
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:19.680
Superbowl teams all the way from management to players and everything in
between.

8
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.950
Why do I talk about stoic philosophy so much?
Well,

9
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.020
to a lot of people who are watching this as was true for me for a very long
time.

10
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:33.021
You hear stoic and you think maybe of a cow standing in the rain just accepting

11
00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:38.010
whatever tragedy in terrible circumstances befall it.

12
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.320
That is not what I'm advocating at all.

13
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.900
Or maybe you imagine somebody with no emotion whatsoever.

14
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.580
Also not what I'm advocating.

15
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:49.020
So the way we use stoic in modern English is somewhat different from the way

16
00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:51.990
that it was used when it came from [inaudible],

17
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.050
which is actually porch and specifically I think that stoicism is a fantastic

18
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.910
operating system for thriving in high stress environments.

19
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.133
What does that mean?

20
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.500
It means that it is a framework for making better decisions in training yourself

21
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.700
to be less reactive.
It goes very well with different types of meditation,

22
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:18.000
whether that's TM or using an app like headspace or calm and so on,

23
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.390
but you don't necessarily need both.

24
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.760
They're complementary stoke philosophy.

25
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.290
And I should say that probably around 2004,

26
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.180
I picked up a book that was the collected letters of Seneca Seneca,

27
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:37.200
the younger who's one of the real figureheads,
I would say,
uh,

28
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.730
in the last few years at least,

29
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:43.731
who has become very popular as a stoic thinker and writer has been popular for

30
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.510
some thousand plus years.
Uh,
but there's been a huge resurgence.

31
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.010
Others would include Marcus Aurelius who used to be the emperor of Rome,
the,

32
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.720
the most powerful man in the world at the time.
And then there are others,

33
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:01.650
Cato and so on.
Epictetus,
who was formerly a slave.

34
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.300
So you have a very wide spectrum of well known stoic thinkers and you should

35
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:08.220
find the one that speaks to you best.

36
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.450
But I picked up this book of Seneca's writing,
didn't really expect much of it.

37
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.410
And when people ask me now,
what is your favorite book of all time?

38
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.930
The book you've read the most,
the book you've gifted the most.

39
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:23.490
I've gifted hundreds of copies of Seneca's letters.

40
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.310
So the moral letters to Luke use,
l,
U,

41
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.340
C I,
l.
I,
U s,
the moral letters to leukemias by Seneca,

42
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.710
the younger,
he was a very famous playwright,

43
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.780
one of the wealthiest people in Rome,

44
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.280
advisor to the emperor that ultimately didn't work out so well for him.
But,
uh,

45
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.480
he was on the front line.

46
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:47.481
So what I appreciate about stoic philosophy is how well it is used in highly

47
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:52.230
challenging circumstances and the,

48
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.470
some of the basics of stoic philosophy,

49
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.240
which have been applied in the Superbowl,

50
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.650
which had been applied in training of all different types that had been applied

51
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:06.640
by prisoners of war qws in wartime,

52
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.650
like Stockdale for instance,
James Stockdale,
uh,
are,

53
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:13.660
I would say a a few things.
Number one,

54
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.010
it trains you much like the serenity prayer in a way,

55
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.040
but it's more systematic to focus on differentiating between the things that you

56
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.130
can control and things you cannot control and really only focusing your energy

57
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:31.180
on the former.
So for instance,

58
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:34.270
if you watch your friends spinning out of control on social media,

59
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:38.920
freaking out about politics and all they do is bitch and whine and whinge about

60
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:42.280
politics,
well,
if we sat down and thought about it,

61
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.260
the vast majority of those people are not going to be in a position nor are and

62
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.270
take steps to change any of that reality.
Therefore,

63
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.440
it is a lot of wasted energy and calories and brain cycles,
right?

64
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:56.920
So really,
really learning to repetitive,
repetitively,

65
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.870
consistently focus on things that are within your sphere of control.

66
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.140
That doesn't mean that you are passive.

67
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.240
And certainly the reason that people like Thomas Jefferson,
George Washington,

68
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.780
the founders of this great country of the United States of America,

69
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.190
we're certainly rebels and revolutionaries and extremely aggressive and

70
00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:19.150
contrarion in many,

71
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:23.230
many ways went to stoicism is because they knew they had a,

72
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.180
a lot of hard battles ahead and they wanted to make wise decisions.
All right.

73
00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:29.014
So number one,

74
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.020
you're learning to focus on and expand the sphere of action that you have,

75
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:37.750
the things that you can control.
Next,

76
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:42.751
you're going to systematically train yourself to be less prone to overreacting,

77
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.600
to say criticism.
So Kato,

78
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:51.150
who is considered by some to be the perfect stoic,
fascinating characters.
See,

79
00:04:51.151 --> 00:04:56.151
ATO would sometimes wear a tunic of an unpopular color so that he would be

80
00:04:56.831 --> 00:05:00.700
ridiculed in the Senate and by other people he did this specifically and other

81
00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:01.534
things like it,

82
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.430
so that he would train himself to only be ashamed of those things worth being

83
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:07.360
ashamed of.

84
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.660
So the superficial things he would experiment with and he would catalyze other

85
00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:18.271
people making fun of him or insulting him so that he would develop a tolerance

86
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:22.420
for it.
Uh,
this is very,
very practical and

87
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.140
there are many corollaries to this,
uh,
as well as the next piece,

88
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:30.280
which is

89
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.920
in effect practicing poverty in the worst case scenarios that they hold less

90
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:36.820
power over you.

91
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.500
And that could take the form of say Kevin Kelly who's been on the Tim Ferriss

92
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:42.334
show podcast,

93
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.960
fascinating technology futurist as well as founding editor of wired magazine.

94
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.040
So he knows worst case scenario because he has done so much backpacking and

95
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:53.740
lived off of instant oatmeal,
that worst case scenario,

96
00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:55.090
he can always have his backpack,

97
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.560
instant oatmeal and a cup of coffee and he be happy.

98
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.600
And he knows that because he's practiced it.

99
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.630
And Seneca in letter 13 of his letters to Luke Ileus,

100
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.230
the moral letters to Lucilius,

101
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.160
which was I believe on festivals and fasting talks about setting aside a certain

102
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:11.780
number of days,
and I'm paraphrasing here,

103
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:16.700
but a certain number of days during which you will eat the cheapest affair where

104
00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:20.240
the coarsest of dress,
et Cetera,
asking yourself all the while,

105
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.070
is this the condition that I so feared?
So practically speaking,

106
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:28.700
I've built this into my own life by fasting,

107
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.570
by exposing myself to cold,
I have a practice of cold exposure,

108
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.250
which has done very safely.

109
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.760
I have different types of planned suffering and planned poverty so that any type

110
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:47.180
of unplanned suffering or unplanned financial hit will have less of an impact on

111
00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:50.720
me.
And this applies in many different fields.

112
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.220
This is I suppose,

113
00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.770
a compatible ethos with the more you sweat in peace time,

114
00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:01.310
the less you bleed in war time.
All right?

115
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:06.020
You want to prepare for the unexpected turns of fate by simulating what the

116
00:07:06.021 --> 00:07:09.380
worst case scenarios would be.
This is very,
very practical.

117
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.390
And then if we look back to Keto for instance,

118
00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:14.070
while he would wear these ridiculous outfits,
you know,

119
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.500
I will spend time walking through say California,
uh,

120
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.120
in San Francisco,
okay,

121
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.290
hippie liberal central with say a cowboy hat on just to see what happens because

122
00:07:24.291 --> 00:07:27.950
you will get all sorts of sideways glances and so on.
Uh,

123
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.340
and I might then go to Utah.

124
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:35.600
I went to a very conservative part of Utah and I wore what I call my party pants

125
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:39.860
for a day or two and party pants are these a very flamboyant,

126
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.330
bright blue,

127
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.550
a floral pattern pants from bonobos.
I don't know if they sell them anymore,

128
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.760
which affects we look like the upholstery on your grandma's couch.

129
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:50.600
They're hideous.

130
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.960
And did that very deliberately to force me to interact with people in a way that

131
00:07:55.971 --> 00:08:00.971
would condition me to be able to take bolder steps or have more uncomfortable

132
00:08:01.311 --> 00:08:05.870
conversations in the future because all serious problems,

133
00:08:05.871 --> 00:08:09.410
all important matters,
require uncomfortable conversations.

134
00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:13.610
I think you can measure your success in many ways by the number of uncomfortable

135
00:08:13.611 --> 00:08:16.760
conversations you're willing to have and stoicism helps with that.

136
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.250
So I go down the list,
but there are very,

137
00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:24.251
very practical steps to take and then you can translate that into your own life.

138
00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:25.304
So,
for instance,

139
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.930
a lot of the advice that you might get from a former navy seal commander like

140
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:32.690
Jocko Willink,
he wouldn't call stoicism.

141
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:37.960
But the mental toughness that he has developed and also train in other people is

142
00:08:38.931 --> 00:08:43.880
very much not going to say identical,
but a a close cousin to stoicism.

143
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.820
And uh,
if,

144
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.730
if you look at for instance,

145
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.630
advice that you would get once you're thrust into the public eye.

146
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.760
And a lot of these letters,
the moral letters killers are along the lines of,

147
00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:00.180
Dear Luke alias,
I hear you're being slandered by your so called friends.

148
00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:03.840
So and so in the Senate.
And he did this,
but then he said this behind your back,

149
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.270
here's how I would recommend that you deal with the situation.

150
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.510
And I would translate that into,
for instance,

151
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:13.050
advice that I give people who are about to get a lot of public exposure.

152
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.943
And I say,

153
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.290
you never as bad as they say you are and you're never as good as they say you

154
00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:20.550
are.
All right.

155
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.870
And I want to touch on a common misconception or maybe aspect of stasis and

156
00:09:24.871 --> 00:09:27.810
people find unattractive.
So you're never as bad as they say you are.

157
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.990
You're also never as good as they say you are and this helps you to keep a level

158
00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:33.360
head.
Some people fear that if they,

159
00:09:33.361 --> 00:09:38.361
if they adopt stoicism or study so awesome that they will become this very

160
00:09:38.551 --> 00:09:43.260
Volkan like creature that has neither,
that certainly has,
uh,

161
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.440
has less of a dip in terms of the lows of life,

162
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.140
but that simultaneously you're going to sacrifice the highest.

163
00:09:49.141 --> 00:09:53.580
You won't have the peaks of joy that you experience as a normal person if you

164
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.680
focus on stoicism to that.
I would say number one,

165
00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:03.450
you are thinking person and much like any book you would read,

166
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.490
you can pick and choose.

167
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.850
So you can pick and choose the elements that you find most useful that you think

168
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:11.850
are going to be most applicable to you and then you can test them.
All right.

169
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:16.851
So I happen to think of my own philosophies not as stoicism and not as a,

170
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:24.180
as an evangelist necessarily for stoicism to proselytize other people.

171
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.870
I pull from elements of say Buddhism or Zen Buddhism.

172
00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:32.871
I also pull elements from epicureanism which was really seen as almost the

173
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.240
opposite of Stoicism,
but uh,

174
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:40.680
to be maximally content and to find joy in the small things.

175
00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:42.180
I find that to be very helpful.

176
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:47.570
A counterbalance to some of the stoicism which can get a little dry and somber

177
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.470
at times.
Uh,

178
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:54.500
but what stoicism will do if you embrace it in many respects and a zen Buddhism

179
00:10:55.981 --> 00:11:00.450
also very helpful for this is help you to develop a present state awareness so

180
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:04.530
that you are aware of your thoughts and emotions if before they take control of

181
00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:08.250
you and lead you to make very bad decisions,

182
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.560
whether that's lashing out at someone verbally,

183
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:15.830
whether that is making an impulse buy or sell decision or otherwise.

184
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:21.000
It is a fantastic insurance policy that allows you to have more consistent

185
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.940
wellbeing throughout your life in all areas.

186
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:29.450
And that to me rather than a cow standing in the rain is stoicism.

187
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.030
And certainly I view it as one of the,

188
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:38.230
the keys to any success that I have had in the last decade or more,

189
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.690
whether that is in the world publishing,
podcasting,

190
00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.140
angel investing or otherwise.

191
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:50.760
I really think that this is a core underlying foundation upon which my best

192
00:11:50.761 --> 00:11:54.430
decisions have been built.
So I hope the same for you.

193
00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.120
And ps,

194
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.450
I feel so strongly about the value of this,

195
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:06.020
and I want to thank everyone who's listened to my podcast or read anything that

196
00:12:06.021 --> 00:12:10.510
I've written that I've put together three volumes of stoic writing,

197
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.960
primarily Seneca,
and I'm giving them away for free.

198
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.880
So I'm giving them way as ebooks.
It's called the Tao of Seneca Tao,

199
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:19.810
the Tao of Seneca.

200
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.920
And there are gorgeous original illustrations that I had commissioned.

201
00:12:23.921 --> 00:12:28.330
There is incredible calligraphy from both Japanese and Chinese masters because I

202
00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:32.950
wanted to show some of the parallels between philosophical schools that are

203
00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:35.540
dropped into this.
And it features a,

204
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:40.590
I want to say at least 120 letters from Seneca to Lucilius.

205
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:44.570
So you can find those for free.
And I really hope that.
