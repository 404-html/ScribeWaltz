00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.820
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:06.150
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.860
I'm a cybernetic organism,
living tissue over meadow.

4
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.140
<v 1>This podcast is brought to you by four sigmatic.</v>

5
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.410
I reached out to these Finnish folks,
young entrepreneurs,
very talented.

6
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.400
After a acrobat introduced me to one of their products,

7
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.750
which is mushroom coffee.

8
00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:40.751
This specific one includes Chaga and lion's mane and it knocked my socks off.

9
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:44.960
I highly recommend if you try it,
you start with half packet.

10
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:49.300
It's very strong and lights you up like a Christmas tree in the best way

11
00:00:49.301 --> 00:00:50.134
possible.

12
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.470
People are always asking me what I use for cognitive enhancement and for right

13
00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:59.130
now this is the answer.
I try to force this on all of my house guests.

14
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.510
It is a hell of a thing.

15
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.260
If I have employees or people come over who are working on projects with me,

16
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:08.100
I always try to feed it to them because I'm going to get the limitless effect

17
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.780
and get a lot more out of them.

18
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.820
The first time I mentioned this product and four sigmatic on the podcast,

19
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.010
their products sold out in less than a week,

20
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.220
so you may want to check them out soon.

21
00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:22.550
If you're listening to this and the coffee tastes like coffee,

22
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.240
it takes just seconds to prepare with hot water.

23
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.420
And oddly enough only includes 40 milligrams of caffeine,

24
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:33.270
so it has less than half of what you'd get in a regular cup of coffee.

25
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.680
I don't get any jitters,
acid reflux or any stomach burn,
any of that.

26
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.020
It's very unusual and very,
very cool.

27
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.770
So if you don't like caffeine,

28
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.460
they also offer very strong but caffeine free mushroom elixirs,

29
00:01:46.461 --> 00:01:50.330
which I will sometimes have in the evening.
I find Chaga specifically to be very,

30
00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:53.270
very grounding and earthy.
So that is another option.

31
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:56.930
And I have a cupboard full of their products,
uh,
at the moment,

32
00:01:56.931 --> 00:02:00.020
which is right around the corner of my kitchen.
You can try something,

33
00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:01.580
you can try a sample pack,
which is great.

34
00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:06.380

Anyway,

38
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.740
if you are in the experimental mindset,
I do not think you'll be disappointed,

39
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:22.723
so try them out.

40
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.930
This episode is brought to you by audible,
which I've used for many,
many years.

41
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.570
I absolutely love audio books in there.

42
00:02:31.571 --> 00:02:34.690
One of my favorite ways to pass the time when I travel,

43
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.980
I'm on the road all the time in audible allows me to consume many more books

44
00:02:38.981 --> 00:02:43.300
than I possibly could otherwise I have to audio books to recommend right off the

45
00:02:43.301 --> 00:02:43.570
bat.

46
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.560
The first is perhaps my favorite audio book of all time and it's the only audio

47
00:02:47.561 --> 00:02:52.360
book I've wanted to listen to twice in a row.
The graveyard book by Neil Gaiman.

48
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.290
It's amazing and you will thank me.
There are a few different versions.

49
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.350
I like the version that Neil narrates himself,

50
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.870
one of the most soothing voices of all time.

51
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.580
The second book is vagabonding by Rolf Potts,
p o t t,

52
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.270
s which had a huge impact on my life and formed the basis for a lot of what

53
00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:12.460
would later become the four hour workweek,

54
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.380
so go to audible.com forward slash Tim and you can choose one of these two books

55
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.970

64
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:51.250
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

65
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.050
I'm sitting in a cabin surrounded by snow and it is still my job every episode

66
00:03:56.051 --> 00:04:00.010
to deconstruct world class performers of all different types from entertainment,

67
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.010
military,
chess to Jujitsu,
you name it.

68
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.600
I've tried to interview the best of the best in that world and in this

69
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:11.590
particular episode we are going to talk about anti aging.

70
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.760
What does that mean?
Well,
there's a lot of hogwash 11 don since out there,

71
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.510
but there were a few people who really stand out as particularly interesting

72
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:21.160
because they walk the talk.

73
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.450
Doctor Arthur Devini is nearly 80 years old and totally ripped.

74
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.620
I just spent a bunch of time with him and better known as Art Devani and you

75
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:33.400
should check them out on Facebook,
facebook.com forward slash art dot devane e.

76
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:35.830
D.
E.
V.
A.
N.
Y.

77
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.640
He was signed as a professional baseball player in his youth and later earned

78
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:41.590
his phd in economics at Ucla.

79
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.700
He is most famous for his evolutionary fitness.
That's the term you would use.

80
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.810
Approach to training and Diet and our conversation focuses a lot on the

81
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:52.840
subtleties and details of that.
During his time at Ucla,

82
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.860
art did many things including creating mathematical and statistical models to

83
00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:58.960
precisely described the motion picture.
Market.

84
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.400
Art is now professor emeritus of economics of the University of California at

85
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:08.401
Irvine is a member of their claimed institute for Mathematical Behavioral

86
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.300
Sciences.
So this guy is very analytical.
He's very mathematical and very,

87
00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:16.960
very logical,
and that is the water on the kettle.

88
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.480
But I'm going to power through it because I'm going to have tea,

89
00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:21.970
but it's going to be after this intro is recorded,

90
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.760
a lifelong student of metabolism and fitness.

91
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.660
Art has lived as a Paleo athlete for more than 30 years and is considered a

92
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:32.080
patriarch of the Paleo movement right up there with Loren Cordain.

93
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.070
He believes there's no such thing as healthy aging and that we can intervene to

94
00:05:36.071 --> 00:05:37.930
protect against the aging process.

95
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.440
And in this episode we talk about his daily schedule workout routines,

96
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.840
Nassim Taleb,
why he never gets sick.

97
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.980
That is why art and ever get sick and really dig into the details of a

98
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:52.840
fascinating man.
There's also one point where I doubt myself,

99
00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:56.980
which happens fairly often,
and I mentioned myotonic reflex.

100
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.540
Then I renege and say,
I don't know what I'm talking about.

101
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.540
So just to explain what I meant by that.
Here's the definition.

102
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:05.300
The stretch reflex,
also known as myotonic reflex.

103
00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:08.870
This is from Wikipedia is a muscle contraction and response to stretching within

104
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:11.510
the muscle.
It is a motto synaptic reflex,

105
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:15.010
which provides automatic regulation of skeletal muscle life.

106
00:06:15.011 --> 00:06:18.200
When a muscle lengthens the muscle spindles stretched and it's nerve activity

107
00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:20.990
increases.
That sounds like Gobbledygook to a lot of you,

108
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.500
but that is why I said myotonic reflex.
It's,

109
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.070
it's related to doing negative only or negative dominant workouts,

110
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.110
which arc arc arc subscribes to.
All right,
so that you have it.

111
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.470
There's a lot of a dense stuff in here.
We get into the weeds,

112
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.880
which you guys love,

113
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.500
but if you're having trouble grasping something and it's getting very dense,

114
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:47.150
just hold on and listen for a few more minutes and we'll get back into more

115
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:47.990
familiar territory.

116
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:52.490
We talked about everything from ice ages to economics to the philosophies of

117
00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:53.630
intermittent everything.

118
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.320
We talk about the extreme events and the economics thereof.

119
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.350
It's a fascinating conversation.
At least it was for me.
So without further a do,

120
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.260
as I always say,
I'm going to go get my tea now.

121
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.610
Please enjoy this conversation with art.
Defaming

122
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.730
art.
Welcome to the show.
Happy to be here.
Tim,
I am thrilled to meet you.

123
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.660
I've heard so much about you for many people,
including our mutual friend,

124
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:21.650
Navarro,
Arabica,

125
00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:25.040
and we're sitting here for those people listening at my undisclosed mountain

126
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:25.874
location.

127
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.040
And art was kind enough to meet me here.

128
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.840
And here we are at the kitchen table and I thought we would just start with how

129
00:07:35.841 --> 00:07:39.290
you connected with novel because I don't know the story.

130
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.880
I started with my blog.
He,
he got in touch with me and uh,

131
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.970
I decided to give a seminar in Las Vegas covering sort of the elements of my

132
00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:53.090
approach and he and his brother Kamala gendered,

133
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.920
along rich with uh,
John Daron.
Sure.

134
00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.480
And uh,

135
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.800
Richard Nikolay and then a whole bunch of other people who've gone on to famous,

136
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:06.550
unfortunate in the Paleo world.
And you've kept in,

137
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.810
in contact with neval or at least he is certainly very familiar with,

138
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.300
with the blog.
If we rewind the clock a little bit,

139
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.710
how did you go?
Well actually I'll take a step back.

140
00:08:18.711 --> 00:08:23.420
I was going to ask you how you went from economics to the evolutionary approach

141
00:08:23.421 --> 00:08:27.860
to everything.
Uh,
but before I go there,
how did you get to economics?

142
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.260
Oh yeah.
Well,
I loved economics.
Uh,

143
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.480
it's a study of a decentralized mechanisms and organizations and spontaneous

144
00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:42.590
order.
I got into it because a,

145
00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:47.330
I took an undergraduate class and comparative economic systems at Ucla

146
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:53.860
and I had a professor who was just profoundly inspiring in that class.

147
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:55.920
George Murphy give him credit.

148
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.120
<v 2>He May,
he may just claim my credit,
but he,
uh,</v>

149
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:05.540
he was so eloquent in talking about a high oak and uh,

150
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.010
Oh God,
Enrico Baroni and a whole bunch of other people who wrestled with central

151
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:11.844
planning.

152
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.080
It's a time when central planning was sweeping Europe and as being promoted,

153
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:19.710
even in the United States,
the,
the progressive movement at that time,

154
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:24.300
if they felt this centralized control,

155
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:29.990
scientific management top down hierarchical control would be the sensible way to

156
00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:33.241
do.
In fact,

157
00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:37.830
I wrote a book about the inland waterways that criticize that approach.

158
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:42.831
And talked about how they actually messed up the flood plains and they thought

159
00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:48.960
there was a hundred year flood plain,
but floods don't have means statistics,

160
00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:51.140
they don't converge.
They diverge.

161
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.410
So the variants keeps growing with every new flood.
What does that,

162
00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:58.350
for people who don't have any familiar with a familiarity with economics,

163
00:09:58.351 --> 00:10:02.250
what does that,
what does that mean?
If you could maybe elaborate on that.
Well,

164
00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:06.330
the variance of course is a merit measure of the variation in the series and the

165
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:08.580
series if it hasn't been,
you know,

166
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.650
most people think in terms of normal distributions that has central tendencies

167
00:10:13.651 --> 00:10:17.430
and that the main and variation are well described by those two parameters.

168
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.073
Not True.

169
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:25.040
The damage that's done by the worst rainstorm in a decade does 40% of all the

170
00:10:26.491 --> 00:10:31.140
damage that that rainstorms do in that decade.
This is,

171
00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:35.400
it's a,
it's an extreme event dominated series.

172
00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:37.710
Just like the movies and just like your life,

173
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.800
people fail to realize you,
you know,
you don't get anywhere from the drip,
drip,

174
00:10:43.801 --> 00:10:45.600
drip of the incremental,

175
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.350
you get there from some big event that changes your life.

176
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.480
Like your book probably changed your life.

177
00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:57.000
I don't know what changed my life.
Lots of things out.
Um,

178
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.530
but those are the moments that are the power moments in your life.
And in fact,

179
00:11:01.531 --> 00:11:05.810
the whole notion of normal,

180
00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.020
it doesn't apply to a person's life.
You know,

181
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.480
you don't get anywhere by incrementing in small increments is the extreme event

182
00:11:15.301 --> 00:11:18.240
and you seize it and you're poised,
you remained poise.

183
00:11:18.241 --> 00:11:23.100
You can respond to that kind of significant event.
For example,

184
00:11:23.101 --> 00:11:27.000
there's this notion of algorithmic compressability,

185
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.870
which is a computer science term that applies to the ability to reduce your life

186
00:11:33.871 --> 00:11:36.360
to an algorithm.
Can't do it,

187
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:42.290
can't do it if the novelty in your life is constantly progressing and you should

188
00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:46.970
welcome the variants,
seize the opportunities.
Um,

189
00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:51.390
that was,
that's the way I,
I think of life fitness,

190
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.100
the Zen of evolutionary fitness.
That's Ah,

191
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.530
<v 3>that's how life works out.</v>

192
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.050
<v 1>So we're going to spend the majority,</v>

193
00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:02.650
I think of our conversation on evolutionary fitness and I have so many questions

194
00:12:02.651 --> 00:12:06.910
for you,
but I want to start with an area I know even less about,

195
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.060
which is Hollywood.
So W,
w,

196
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:14.950
w what are some of the erroneous beliefs,

197
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.970
uh,
or,
uh,
that you,

198
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.390
that you've found in Hollywood or insights that,
that,
uh,

199
00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.270
you've written about and studied?

200
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:28.170
<v 3>Well,
you know,
it's an industry that nobody understands.</v>

201
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:32.040
Nobody has really written everything very sensible about the industry.

202
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:37.530
Their Supreme Court,
for example,
divorced the studios from the theaters.

203
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:41.450
And,
uh,
Justice Douglas was a guy who wrote the decision,

204
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.300
the famous paramount antitrust decrees.

205
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:49.790
It treated the industry as a monopoly because they looked at market shares,

206
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.950
which if you measure it a particular point in time,

207
00:12:52.951 --> 00:12:57.210
parametal have so many dollars of the total revenue of the industry.

208
00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.930
Universal,
we have so many.
And,

209
00:12:59.931 --> 00:13:03.390
and on down the line problem is it changes every week.

210
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:09.350
So if you use a something like a Herfindahl index or a measure of concentration,

211
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.560
it's constantly varying.
In fact,
it has no mean,

212
00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.920
it's the second moment of,
excuse me,
just a second,

213
00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:21.000
is the variance of the distribution of market shares,
the Herfindahl Index.
It is,

214
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:26.550
and it's infinite.
It doesn't exist.
Amalinh Volvo wrote about this.

215
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.530
So did,
uh,
Oh,
who's he and the guy who did did fractals

216
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.630
anyway,
it doesn't matter who the,
Oh,
is it?
Middleborough.
Yeah.

217
00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:42.570
Middleborough he,
he coined the word fractal.
And because it's a,

218
00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:48.070
it's a situation where the variation is so extreme that the distribution itself

219
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.920
doesn't have the normal kinds of lifts of limits.

220
00:13:54.921 --> 00:13:59.921
It's a so called wild distribution as nothing to lab calls him if he's wild.

221
00:14:01.131 --> 00:14:04.160
Distributions don't have finite moments necessarily.

222
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.670
The meaning variants may not exist as such as an invalid.

223
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.290
A example.
And that's true also in the movies,

224
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:16.860
it turned out that the movies has such a wild distribution that even the mean

225
00:14:17.051 --> 00:14:19.960
doesn't exist.
So if you talk about the average gross,

226
00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.750
you're talking about no movie that ever made that

227
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.140
<v 1>they all reminds me of a,</v>

228
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:31.830
there's a some type of joke that was meant to illustrate the flaw in how people

229
00:14:32.741 --> 00:14:35.810
miss apply arithmetic green mean.
And so,
you know,

230
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:40.630
Bill Gates walks into a bar and suddenly the average net worth is $50 million or

231
00:14:40.631 --> 00:14:41.464
something like that.

232
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.760
Bill Gates walks into a bar and everybody's a millionaire on average.
Yeah,

233
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.060
exactly.
So,
yeah,
it's a,

234
00:14:49.061 --> 00:14:52.190
does this make movies impossible to predict

235
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.920
<v 2>or plan for?
How would you build that in?
If you ran a studio,</v>

236
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.430
how would that inform,
uh,
what you've learned?

237
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.860
How would that inform decisions that you make?
Well,
you,

238
00:15:00.861 --> 00:15:03.830
you've got to have a story and characters,
the audience will love,

239
00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.400
as you remember Kelly Query,

240
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:12.440
she invited me to come speak to this screen,
accurate,
the screenwriter's guild.

241
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:18.050
And she said,
you make a movie by you make the audience,

242
00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:22.790
love the characters and then you tortured
torture the characters.

243
00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:27.850
Yeah.
And would be visa vi the characters,
the audience torture the characters,

244
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:32.540
right?
So the idea is that you a great script or great story,

245
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:37.490
memorable characters,
then the rest is up to the audience.

246
00:15:37.491 --> 00:15:41.030
It may or may not work.
I'm an actor,

247
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:46.810
has the same kind of arrogance in his career grosses as does the industry in

248
00:15:47.811 --> 00:15:52.811
general so that an accurate way or make one movie and that movie will earn 40%

249
00:15:52.941 --> 00:15:56.390
of the actor's career revenues.
Same thing with directors.

250
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:58.423
If you,

251
00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:03.410
if you did all the regressions in the world is a statistical technique for

252
00:16:03.411 --> 00:16:05.750
trying to predict what a movie's going to make.

253
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.980
You would find out that a handful of actors have any significance.

254
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:11.930
And there's sort of Luke's anyway,

255
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.380
like Val Kilmer Kilmore Kilmore came up in that,

256
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:20.240
in the regression equations he's going now.
I mean it's,
it's not that

257
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:26.390
the past doesn't predict the future's really the way to look at it and there's

258
00:16:26.391 --> 00:16:31.391
no algorithm to determine how a movie's going to gross genre is somewhat

259
00:16:32.781 --> 00:16:36.440
helpful,
but only because people look as genre.

260
00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:41.540
Genre is not a category is something that people put.
It's a box.

261
00:16:41.541 --> 00:16:44.420
People put put movies in.

262
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.490
You really want to know how much a movie is going to make.
You have to um,

263
00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.780
look at how many theaters of the,
open it on.

264
00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:56.060
It's the cereal box effect.
If you go into grocery store and we'd eat,

265
00:16:56.090 --> 00:17:00.950
gets all the shelf space,
except for food a few inches,

266
00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:02.530
it's going to have the highest gross.

267
00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:08.680
It might disappear very quickly though because of a big opening is a,

268
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.370
is a dangerous strategy.

269
00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:14.270
It tends to give you a dominant revenues in the early weeks.

270
00:17:14.271 --> 00:17:19.250
And if people follow the revenues as a means of making a decision,

271
00:17:19.251 --> 00:17:23.750
how to go,
which movie to go to,
that would tend to propel an,

272
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:24.310
an uh,

273
00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:29.310
a dynamic where you would have an expansive gross problem is you also have word

274
00:17:30.291 --> 00:17:33.090
of mouth and reviews.
So it's,

275
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:36.380
it's a mixture of public and private information,

276
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:39.290
private information being when your friends tell you about it,

277
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.800
public information being,
reading the box office scores,

278
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:47.960
you put those two together and you just have an enormously complicated dynamics.

279
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.950
You can't tell how it's going to do

280
00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.000
<v 3>asthma.
As a matter of fact,
if,</v>

281
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:57.040
if you don't get the grosses and you can have 4,000 theaters committed their

282
00:17:57.041 --> 00:17:58.360
screens to your movie,

283
00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.900
you may have to allow them to double bill in the second week.

284
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.420
That is add another feature to it.
Oh,
I see.

285
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.760
If you see a movie that stubble building by the third week,
it's a stinker.

286
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.353
So,

287
00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.700
<v 1>and uh,
yeah,
I would,
I would imagine it's similar to books too.
I mean,</v>

288
00:18:15.701 --> 00:18:17.830
I suppose in any hits driven business,

289
00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.840
there are some people who try to front load with distribution,

290
00:18:20.841 --> 00:18:25.060
so they have this huge initial upfront cost in the hopes that it will make the

291
00:18:25.061 --> 00:18:30.061
list somewhere at the top and then become a as a self fulfilling cycle of sorts

292
00:18:30.191 --> 00:18:31.860
where people use it as a shop

293
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:37.110
<v 3>kind of thing and actually a lot of authors or go out and buy lots of copies of</v>

294
00:18:37.111 --> 00:18:37.944
your book.

295
00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.380
<v 1>Oh yeah,
I know.
I know of people who've bought,
you know,
I remember I visited,</v>

296
00:18:41.381 --> 00:18:44.680
I shall not name names,
but I went to the the office,

297
00:18:44.681 --> 00:18:49.300
the headquarters of a CEO who had recently published his own book,

298
00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:53.020
or I should say had his book published,
which he did not.
Right,

299
00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:58.410
and there were tens of thousands of copies lighting the wall.

300
00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:00.910
It was just outrageous.

301
00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:05.160
He could have built an entire structure out of these books.
The public has to,

302
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:06.980
<v 3>they,
they're smart.</v>

303
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:10.970
They've learned that if you just look at the sales itself,

304
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.100
that's what a lot of other people are doing.
But it could be that they're,

305
00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.160
they're manipulating the sales as a way of signaling to you that it's a great

306
00:19:20.881 --> 00:19:22.350
book.
So you,

307
00:19:22.351 --> 00:19:27.000
you look at reviews and you see what the author's done before it might work if

308
00:19:27.001 --> 00:19:30.700
you're Tom Hanks in the movie.
But then again it could be,

309
00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.470
he said he has huge variance in his gross is also,
he's not a sure thing.

310
00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:40.980
What a star will do is it will raised the least revenue.

311
00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.670
Okay.
A film minor.

312
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.170
<v 1>I see.
It raises the Ma the,
the,</v>

313
00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.580
<v 3>the minimum revenue because it gets it out on a fair number of screens and some</v>

314
00:19:49.581 --> 00:19:54.530
people will come,
but then word of mouth starts to take over and it can,

315
00:19:54.531 --> 00:19:55.760
it can tank and no time.

316
00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:01.260
<v 1>So you developed these,
these mental models,
this analytical,</v>

317
00:20:01.261 --> 00:20:02.490
these analytical frameworks.

318
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.880
How did fitness and diet enter the scene for you and,

319
00:20:08.531 --> 00:20:11.810
or how,
how did,
how did that,
how did you start focusing on that?

320
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:17.130
<v 3>It really bang began the other way around.
I always wanted to be fit and strong.</v>

321
00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.450
Yeah.
And have a beautiful body and you know,
a healthy looking skin and so forth.

322
00:20:22.451 --> 00:20:27.370
And it's just like people liking me and looking at me.
So ego helps a lot

323
00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.710
in this game.
Yeah.
But I also was interested in,

324
00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:36.680
in fitness and eating well most of my life.

325
00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:42.790
However that meant that blended with that plus my interest in athletics and I

326
00:20:43.251 --> 00:20:46.800
wanted to be a pro baseball player,
I site let me down.

327
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:50.880
So those that,

328
00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:55.940
that mixture led me to appreciate the hunter gatherer kind of lifestyle that

329
00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:04.120
that is.
If you,
if you view uncertainty in the world the way I do,

330
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:07.700
and you realize that we came through a narrow bottleneck,

331
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:12.340
only 2,500 or so humans made it through the Toba,

332
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:17.020
the Post Toba,
volcanic eruption,
a volcanic winter.

333
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.450
There was a lowest temperature in the,

334
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.590
in the last 20,000 years it was was post Toba.

335
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.740
And so we came through a bottleneck like that.

336
00:21:26.741 --> 00:21:31.390
You realize that we have to be extremely hardy,
very robust.

337
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.340
You had to be poised.

338
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.840
The brain is there in order to adapt to the climate variations that the humans

339
00:21:37.841 --> 00:21:39.850
went through.
There were,

340
00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:44.910
there were 20,000 years of extreme climate variation and a good brain is a good

341
00:21:45.641 --> 00:21:48.730
way to gift gift through that sort of thing.

342
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:54.370
You can imagine God's designers,
human designers saying,
well,

343
00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.750
we've got a new kind of,

344
00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:00.780
we got a new model now it's different from the archaic model in the sense it has

345
00:22:00.911 --> 00:22:04.750
a very large brain.
It's smart as hell.
This kind of fat and slow

346
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.400
and God just says,
well,
let's see if it gets through.

347
00:22:09.401 --> 00:22:14.380
The Ice Age is a high of 20,000 years of ice ages plans ahead of it and that's

348
00:22:14.381 --> 00:22:17.440
what happened.
The archaic form didn't last and they all,

349
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:20.930
all the other closely related forms of,
uh,

350
00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:25.180
of human beings disappeared.
If his time in the end,
Athol,

351
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:30.280
the Homo heidelbergensis and a whole host of other,

352
00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:35.440
even home,
my rectus was still around early on in this period,

353
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.510
2000,
200,000 years ago.

354
00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:43.440
So they all disappeared and they all disappeared because you didn't have the

355
00:22:43.631 --> 00:22:46.740
adaptive behavior that uh,
that modern human sound,

356
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:51.880
that rain was the survival instrument.
That means that,
uh,
we're here.

357
00:22:51.881 --> 00:22:56.881
We have a great brain simply because it's a way of adapting to the challenges

358
00:22:57.341 --> 00:23:02.341
that the world presents to us and you couldn't have the brain that we have

359
00:23:03.911 --> 00:23:07.840
unless you had a body as well.
The brain body,

360
00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:12.250
his brain muscle cell signaling is dominates most of my thinking.

361
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:17.650
Uh,
so a fit in approach to fitness,
it will think of the sea squirt.

362
00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.550
I'll admit I don't know much about sea squirts and sea squirts,

363
00:23:21.551 --> 00:23:25.210
a little polyp that lives in the sea and it floats around,

364
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:26.860
finds a location,

365
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:32.740
latches onto that Barca lounger and eats a sprain,
eats its own brand,

366
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:36.550
each its own brain because it's found his place.

367
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:41.570
It no longer needs to navigate that world and the brain is dispensable and every

368
00:23:42.251 --> 00:23:46.040
bit of protein and substrate that's the animal can get ahold of if

369
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.870
<v 2>of course it's going to eat.
So at that point,
the sea squirt consumes a sprain.</v>

370
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.720
A lot of people do that too.
Don't think it's going to say,

371
00:23:53.721 --> 00:23:58.460
I think a lot of that's happening right now.
Yeah,
yeah.
Settling into a couch,

372
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:04.040
you lose your,
you lose your muscle,
your brain begins to degenerate.

373
00:24:04.041 --> 00:24:08.780
Because it's not giving the signals at the muscles muscles release all kinds of

374
00:24:08.781 --> 00:24:12.020
so called myokines now that had been discovered.

375
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:17.750
And it also a remote signal from the muscle can cause your brain to improve its

376
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.630
cell quality to maintain neurons.

377
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:25.850
One thing you could do is to contract muscles and you'll find you improve what's

378
00:24:25.851 --> 00:24:28.430
called proteostasis in,
in,
in the neurons.

379
00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.480
Proteostasis is maintaining the cellular quality,

380
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:37.880
not having misfolded proteins,
misshapen proteins,

381
00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:42.500
rock Haina pro changing your,
is that related to uh,

382
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.010
like a brain drive neurotrophic factor or things like that?

383
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:50.500
Or is it adults mechanism?
It also does that with see neurotropic factors,

384
00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:55.490
typically growth type factors that rescue,
uh,
a stressed cell.

385
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:57.230
And that does happen.

386
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:03.400
But the other part of it is that you need to alter insulin signaling so that

387
00:25:04.401 --> 00:25:05.234
you're actually

388
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:11.060
bring on the defensive pathways in that neuron as opposed to the growth,

389
00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:11.880
right?

390
00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:16.880
The growth factors and the signal a seat way so that we're bringing on the facts

391
00:25:16.981 --> 00:25:20.810
show in search tunes and other factors in there in the neuron.

392
00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:26.420
So that kind of signaling,
and if you,
if you affect proteostasis in the brain,

393
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.640
the brain then can send neurosignals to affect proteostasis in remote tish

394
00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.593
tissues.

395
00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:36.560
Now we're into this notion of remote cetainly or signaling at a distance,

396
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:41.840
which is systemic signaling.
Economists love that kind of a,

397
00:25:41.841 --> 00:25:42.674
and you know,

398
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:48.850
the kind of model that adaptive kind of decentralized behavior and what,

399
00:25:50.901 --> 00:25:54.890
uh,
what types of,
if,
if we're looking at,

400
00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:00.950
for instance,
I was listening to one of your presentations and one of the,

401
00:26:00.951 --> 00:26:05.840
on one of the slides I just wrote down two lines and it was,
it reads,

402
00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.250
eating is not programmed.
It is the result of the failure of a renewal program.

403
00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:11.270
Right.

404
00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:16.270
And so I would love to hear you a elaborate on that maybe a little bit and then

405
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:20.420
be,
uh,
follow that through with the,

406
00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:25.930
the implications in terms of behaviors that might help or diet,

407
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:31.690
anything that might help to,
uh,
bolster that renewal system.
Man.

408
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:35.180
Well,
you know,
aging is a really,
um,
a puzzle.

409
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:39.770
I only started studying it a few years ago and I figured,
well,

410
00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.960
I'm an expert because I'm experienced.

411
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.300
<v 3>I was about 78 years old when I started looking at aging.</v>

412
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:53.990
And as I thought it really is a lot simpler than people who are making it out to

413
00:26:54.241 --> 00:26:57.330
be.
It is not programmed.
There are,
there's no,

414
00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.580
no aging genes have been discovered.

415
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:04.650
The only just changed that had been discovered to have any bearing on aging or

416
00:27:04.651 --> 00:27:07.890
defensive pathways.
Foxo sir.
Two wins.

417
00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:12.480
Proteostasis a host of other defensive immunity,

418
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:17.990
stem cell proliferation there four or five pathways that are involved in aging

419
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:19.830
and in the main,

420
00:27:19.831 --> 00:27:24.831
they are regenerative or defensive pathways like,

421
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:25.950
like immunity,

422
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:30.570
the immune pathways crossover with your,
uh,

423
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:35.520
cell maintenance.
Defensive Pathways.
For example,

424
00:27:35.521 --> 00:27:39.000
a toffee is used in both processes.
That's off as you being the,

425
00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.610
the consumption of self tissues of own tissues,

426
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:48.540
faith Faigy being eating and being you,
your own tissues.

427
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.590
So tough a topic you use both an element of the immune system.

428
00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:58.610
It's also an element of keeping the stem cells alive and healthy because they're

429
00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:02.400
living on its Alpha g and when they,

430
00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.330
when they need to proliferate and come out and heal wounds,
your tissues,

431
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:11.160
they go through a burst of photographer cheating and then they transition into,

432
00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:16.710
into oxidative phospho they use are actually for pathways.
After that,

433
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.970
Varian,
they're being defended by a topic cheese,
so that,

434
00:28:20.971 --> 00:28:23.880
that the mitochondria don't damage the stem cells.

435
00:28:23.881 --> 00:28:26.100
They have to live in a low oxygen niche,

436
00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:31.480
but they're very similar to a very primitive form of cell.
Uh,

437
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.510
they live on basically,
um,
glycolysis.

438
00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:42.380
And there was all life lived at one time and your fast twitch muscle fibers also

439
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:46.920
used the most primitive kind of

440
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:51.630
energy sources for,
for movement.

441
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:57.910
So the defensive pathways or that really the key to it all in,

442
00:28:57.911 --> 00:28:59.630
and the pier at the poet's Novis,

443
00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:04.980
the legend of [inaudible] is a legend of the Greek God of Aurora was he was a

444
00:29:06.901 --> 00:29:10.500
row or rowers boyfriend.
And Zeus didn't like it.

445
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:15.180
So of Aurora pleaded with him,
with Zeus not to kill him.

446
00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:19.620
So Zeus in his clever way said,
well,
okay,
you're going to live forever.

447
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:24.960
But he didn't,
he forgot to say,
I'm not going to let you age.

448
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:30.270
So to thoroughness wastes away for eternity as a,

449
00:29:30.271 --> 00:29:31.410
as a cruel punishment,

450
00:29:31.411 --> 00:29:34.410
but it's a correct description of what the aging process is.

451
00:29:34.411 --> 00:29:38.520
So loss of cell function,
loss of cell integrity,

452
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:42.490
a loss of the ability of stem to renew

453
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.950
<v 2>tissues.
So aging basically is simply damage.</v>

454
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.890
What are some of the interventions that a,
that you find most interesting?

455
00:29:50.891 --> 00:29:53.680
At this point,
I eat only twice a day.
So I log,

456
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:55.870
I want long intervals between meals.

457
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.920
I want low insulin signaling so that I bring on the defensive and repair

458
00:29:59.921 --> 00:30:03.910
pathways.
I want to be conscious of maintaining my stem cells.

459
00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:07.030
How do you maintain your stem cells?
Well,
first of all,

460
00:30:07.031 --> 00:30:11.110
you don't have too much mitochondria with density down in your stem cells.

461
00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:14.260
So I,
yeah,
I really want to talk about this.

462
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.430
Mitochondrial density is all the rage.
All right.
I mean,

463
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.920
it seems to be all the rage,
isn't it?

464
00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:26.370
Like they're innocent little batteries that just sacrifice and produce energy

465
00:30:26.411 --> 00:30:28.630
for it.
You remember they have their own DNA,

466
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:34.300
so mitochondria density.
It has to be very low in the stem cell niches.

467
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:40.660
Moreover,
that mitochondrial activity level,

468
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:43.720
for example,
humans,
people don't know this.

469
00:30:43.721 --> 00:30:48.430
Humans had the lowest mitochondria density of any mammal.
Really?
Yes,

470
00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:53.290
and they also have low,
low reactive type of Mitochondria.

471
00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:58.300
The l three we all came off out of the l three mitochondrial appetite that left

472
00:30:58.301 --> 00:31:03.301
Africa number mitochondrial eve accrued about how to 6,000 38,000 years ago.

473
00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.570
By that time it's humans were huddled on the seashore,

474
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.600
South Africa trying to survive the,

475
00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:16.410
the temperature was so cold and so much ice was locked up moisture that the

476
00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.560
Sahara expanded in scope and became very arid.

477
00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:24.100
So after,
after Toba,

478
00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:28.480
a volcanic eruption of the largest volcanic eruption in the last 200 years,

479
00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.440
humans were basically settled along the the southern and eastern shore of a,

480
00:31:35.781 --> 00:31:40.781
of Africa huddled there to survive in the Emma Curtis Marianna and thinks that

481
00:31:41.421 --> 00:31:41.661
the,

482
00:31:41.661 --> 00:31:46.661
the I the seashore saved humanity to via accessibility of a c seafood along the

483
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:52.263
shore.

484
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:57.390
Vegetables were wiped off for about a thousand years or there was a thousand

485
00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:02.760
year volcanic winter and vegetables were difficult to come by and the inland

486
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.470
sources of animals were,
were sparse as well.

487
00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:11.340
It turns out we may have survived on corms there.

488
00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:16.480
A starchy plant is in the biome of south southern Africa,

489
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:21.330
curbs,
corms,
c.
O.
R.
M.
S.
I,
yes,

490
00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.080
I've seen this written forms.

491
00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:28.680
It's a carbohydrate containing,
I,
I hate to tell the Paleo guys this

492
00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:33.490
between the muscles and the,

493
00:32:33.491 --> 00:32:38.410
and the washed up seals and an occasional beached whale and the seabirds and

494
00:32:38.411 --> 00:32:39.770
occasionally inland hunting.

495
00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.210
<v 3>Um,
that that was basically how we survive muscles,</v>

496
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:49.250
muscles or your friend and both,
both kinds of muscles.
So,

497
00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:55.030
so there's the survival aspect of the Dha of course in the seafood became a

498
00:32:55.041 --> 00:32:56.960
substrate for them,
for the brain.

499
00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:01.940
And you can see they're remarkable photos that show the difference between a

500
00:33:01.941 --> 00:33:05.960
100,000 years difference in the human skull.

501
00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:10.580
So profound difference.
You can see that the human skull,

502
00:33:10.581 --> 00:33:14.670
the modern human skull than emerged is kind of a,
uh,

503
00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:19.370
juvenile lies version of the earlier skull.
And,
uh,

504
00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.970
the hyper prefrontal area of the cortex in what have you.

505
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:28.990
So bringing expansion clearly occurred in response to two things.

506
00:33:29.271 --> 00:33:33.620
The availability of new nutrition to help propel brain growth.

507
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:40.090
The need to have high bring cognitive power to survive the ice ages plus the

508
00:33:42.081 --> 00:33:46.100
growing settlement size on the seashore because we now had a stable source of,

509
00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:49.310
uh,
food.
We,
I'm thinking of us,
you know,

510
00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.860
coming from that period and that,

511
00:33:51.861 --> 00:33:55.550
that spurred technology and remember language developed at this time too.

512
00:33:55.551 --> 00:34:00.230
So it was an enormous change in human behavior during this time period.

513
00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:05.420
And so we were talking about the interventions.

514
00:34:05.421 --> 00:34:08.210
You mentioned eating two times a day and we'll,
we'll come back to this I think,

515
00:34:08.211 --> 00:34:12.380
but is that generally breakfast,
dinner,
lunch,
dinner?
What's the,

516
00:34:12.381 --> 00:34:15.830
what is your split look like?
Well,
whatever suits you,
but I do lunch.

517
00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:17.510
I do,

518
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:22.510
I do breakfast dinner because I want a long interval between meals to promote

519
00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:28.310
proteostasis.
I want that went to clear the enzymes.

520
00:34:28.311 --> 00:34:33.311
I want to remember you got there about a billion's proteins in a cell according

521
00:34:35.301 --> 00:34:37.730
to gentleman's group up at Berkeley.
Oh,
Berkeley.

522
00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:45.260
And uh,
it's very critical to the,
the,

523
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:49.880
the degradation of the genes is sort of a continuous process,

524
00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.660
but the transcription in making new proteins is,

525
00:34:53.890 --> 00:34:55.970
is interval based kind of thing.

526
00:34:56.390 --> 00:34:59.290
It depends on when the nurture and signals are there.
When,
when,

527
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:03.230
when Mtwara begins to say,
okay,
don't consume proteins,

528
00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.630
make new ones transcribe and translate.

529
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:08.550
Although when you transcribe and translate you,

530
00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:13.560
you find that that moves up a diagonal there for the atrophy process follows it

531
00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.810
because you've got to keep some kind of balance there if you over,

532
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:22.730
my theory is this,
if we we,
we had to overeat in order to survive.

533
00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:26.990
We don't live on energy balance and if you look at this as a random world,

534
00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:31.820
you can't survive unless you overeat during periods when food is available.

535
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:35.630
So as to the store of nutrients for the time to scarcity,

536
00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:40.650
we also over proliferate.
That is when new change surveillance will,

537
00:35:40.651 --> 00:35:45.651
that transcription and translation process turns on in a sort of a burst has to

538
00:35:45.871 --> 00:35:48.930
be because otherwise you won't make enough proteins to survive.

539
00:35:48.931 --> 00:35:51.570
Your cells won't be durable.

540
00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:56.820
That is what's killing us today because we're over transcribing or over eating.

541
00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.350
We're making too many proteins.
They get misfolded,
they get damaged,
they don't,

542
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:03.330
there's no room for them.
This,

543
00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.540
the architecture of the cell is stretched to the Actin.

544
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:11.640
Filaments are stretched out and there's stress signaling going on and you don't

545
00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:15.990
transcribe accurately,
you know,
make good proteins when you're under stress.

546
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:21.860
We also talked then about the low mitochondrial density near stem cell niches.

547
00:36:22.201 --> 00:36:27.060
I guess he said,
yes,
they reside in a low oxygen niche.
So how do you,

548
00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:27.420
uh,

549
00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:32.250
how do you proactively encourage low mitochondrial density in those areas?

550
00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.560
You do weightlifting.
You stay off the treadmill.

551
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:43.110
Actually,
if,
if you sprint,
you can use up,

552
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.570
you can consume mitochondria because you,
you improve mitochondrial dense

553
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:52.930
quality.
I got it.
So they become more sort of effective and efficient.

554
00:36:52.931 --> 00:36:56.460
So they don't need,
you don't need the density.
That's right.
That's why.
And,

555
00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.320
and they are not as,
they don't realize much on observation either.

556
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:03.960
You're using the glycolytic pathway,

557
00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:07.680
which goes through the Mitochondria anyway in Bethesda in the Kreb cycle and so

558
00:37:07.681 --> 00:37:11.880
forth.
But it's not,
it's not producing lots of free radicals.

559
00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:17.840
Are you responsible for getting a Nassim Taleb deadlifting?

560
00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.220
Is that my fault?

561
00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:25.950
Well,
you remember the story about now seeing my,
if you've,

562
00:37:25.951 --> 00:37:29.670
if you read the back section of the little section you wrote for my book,

563
00:37:29.671 --> 00:37:34.671
because he hear he was a kurtosis trader that as he,

564
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:39.420
he used distributions with wild characteristics.
He was,

565
00:37:39.421 --> 00:37:41.730
he was buying out of the money calls and puts

566
00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:47.490
and living on the variance.
Right.
He was,
I weren't living in the options world.

567
00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.630
Yes,
that's right.

568
00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:53.660
And so here he was doing just steady state exercise.

569
00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:57.600
And I said,
what,
what,
what are you doing?
This is the wrong approach.

570
00:37:57.601 --> 00:38:01.620
Just I just so I know it because I,
and uh,
how did you first,

571
00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.270
how did the two of you connect?
I used his book in a class.

572
00:38:06.271 --> 00:38:10.440
I taught a fool by randomness.
I used in a class,

573
00:38:10.441 --> 00:38:14.570
I taught on the economics of uncertainty.
It's all them.

574
00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.400
I communicated with him,
I said,
I'm using your book.

575
00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:21.030
I don't know why Rhodium but I,
because I hate textbooks

576
00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:27.230
and they're really connected with him.
He said he hates textbooks to you,
really,

577
00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.240
you really hit a sore spot,

578
00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:35.770
get him started on ACA academia.
So

579
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:40.720
<v 2>she connected with him and then he was doing steady state exercise.
He was,</v>

580
00:38:40.721 --> 00:38:41.830
he was doing his,
you know,

581
00:38:41.831 --> 00:38:46.831
three sets of 12 and so many hours on the treadmill or the cycling or whatever.

582
00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:52.810
And he figured out that in cycling to and from his office,

583
00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:57.760
that's when he,
his office was some distance from his own gym.

584
00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:03.220
He said he figured out that the maximum expenditure of energy and that ride was

585
00:39:03.221 --> 00:39:06.100
within them the most good.
And that's,

586
00:39:06.101 --> 00:39:09.850
that's your approach to this four hours.
For example,

587
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:14.680
in an organization,
the meeting,
the,

588
00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:19.280
the half the work is done by the square root of n workers.

589
00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:24.970
So he got a hundred people in there,
10 workers produce half the output,

590
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.710
which catch,
I mean,
this is,

591
00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:30.630
we're on the same page with this parade of distribution.
Right.

592
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:35.080
And this is just solar prices work in Lufkin and others have looked at

593
00:39:35.081 --> 00:39:38.090
scientific publishing,
publishing,
what have you.
Uh,

594
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:42.700
the pope has his own own version of this,
by the way.
Hope John Pope John Paul,

595
00:39:42.701 --> 00:39:47.590
before,
before he passed away,
he was asked how many people work at the Vatican.

596
00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:49.150
He said about half of them.

597
00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:56.950
Of course,
Robert Evans,
just a,
it's the same thing about Hollywood.

598
00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.620
Hollywood is a place where half the people are not working.

599
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.980
And it's true that between films and they're hoping for the next one.

600
00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:08.240
So even Dustin Hoffman is great.
You said I have to be grateful to be working.
Uh,

601
00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.500
this goes with the business in the industry.

602
00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:16.660
There are these power law distributed networks and a few people that are with us

603
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:19.880
and we'll hubs.
And so James,

604
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:22.280
the same rule really holds for the movie industry.

605
00:40:22.281 --> 00:40:26.890
And probably half the people do.
About 10% of the people do about half,

606
00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:30.110
half the movies or something like that incident that's not seem thought that
the,

607
00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:34.180
the,
the calorie expenditure during his bike ride as what was giving him the most

608
00:40:34.181 --> 00:40:38.530
bang for the buck.
Can you imagine the people were that dumb back in those days?

609
00:40:38.531 --> 00:40:42.640
And there's still people around who think that,
uh,
the energy balance model,

610
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:46.270
I don't know how well let's face it.

611
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:50.830
They all studied steady state exercise because you put someone on the treadmill

612
00:40:50.831 --> 00:40:55.720
and you,
Benji does option expenditure.
Nobody had any idea.

613
00:40:56.170 --> 00:41:00.730
Nonsteady state exercise is very difficult to quantify and dementia now they're

614
00:41:00.731 --> 00:41:03.220
getting better at it once much better at it.
And he was,

615
00:41:03.221 --> 00:41:07.900
the power law holds again because the most intense exercise,

616
00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:12.580
the most intense expenditures to the ball.

617
00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.460
You put accelerometers on children,

618
00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:20.370
the leanness of the ones who engage in the most intense verse,

619
00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:24.970
they little little children don't steady state exercise.

620
00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:31.150
So what does your exercise regimen look like or what you would prescribe to

621
00:41:31.151 --> 00:41:34.280
someone like a not seem or anyone?
Well,
I told

622
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.560
<v 3>the shame to start doing negative dead lifts.</v>

623
00:41:36.561 --> 00:41:41.561
If he wants to improve his dead lifts have have somebody help you put the bar

624
00:41:42.561 --> 00:41:44.990
up,
lower it,
pick,

625
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:49.520
pick a height and then put it up.
You can lower it again and put it up,

626
00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:53.810
Lord again.
I do.
I do almost all negatives now.
Why is that?

627
00:41:53.811 --> 00:41:57.630
You talk about why,
why?
Why are you centrics?
Well,

628
00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.730
so I'm doing eccentrics for really three reasons.

629
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:07.460
The main one being the fake double your stem cell counts in the satellite cells

630
00:42:07.461 --> 00:42:12.380
and the muscle.
Now the double loan,
but they don't exhaust him.
A lot of people,

631
00:42:12.381 --> 00:42:15.770
if you double the stem cells,
it flood out.

632
00:42:15.771 --> 00:42:20.300
You may exhaust them because you made simply exhausted the ones in the niche

633
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:24.680
which you want to do is you want to double them and have one go back into the

634
00:42:24.681 --> 00:42:27.530
nation.
One go out and and Hugh of tissues,

635
00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:33.380
asymmetric differentiation is what you want.
If he symmetrically differentiate,

636
00:42:33.381 --> 00:42:37.940
they both become new possible progenitors to cells.

637
00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.480
You,
you're now exhausting.
Put what?
Take one out,

638
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:44.480
put one in it is the best way to do it.

639
00:42:44.481 --> 00:42:49.100
And Accenture cash science does that downhill running just to downhill running

640
00:42:49.101 --> 00:42:53.890
down.
He ramming.
How do you in,
uh,
so I'd love to hear what a,

641
00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:57.860
a,
a negative focused workout of yours might look like.

642
00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:03.430
And if you could also just talk about mitigating injury risk because there are a

643
00:43:05.961 --> 00:43:07.910
lot of people who get in.
For instance,

644
00:43:07.911 --> 00:43:12.911
there are a lot of sprinters who in their training will only do the positive on

645
00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:16.580
deadlifts and dropped them for fear of hamstring injuries.
So,
so not as,

646
00:43:16.581 --> 00:43:18.980
they can't be done safely because I,
I've done a lot of natives,

647
00:43:18.981 --> 00:43:21.770
but I'd love to hear what a workout of yours looks like.

648
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:25.730
It's so mild you wouldn't believe you and I work off in a almost every day.
Okay.

649
00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:29.140
Maybe 10,
15 minutes.
And uh,

650
00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:32.240
sometimes it's hard to do a negative if you don't have a training partner.

651
00:43:32.241 --> 00:43:35.420
But I use equipment and I use,
uh,

652
00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:37.401
like for example,

653
00:43:37.401 --> 00:43:42.401
they extensions push up with two lower than with one typical lake press push up

654
00:43:43.821 --> 00:43:45.950
with two lower with one.
Um,

655
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:51.260
shoulder presses push up with two.
Actually I,
I use,

656
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:56.300
I use a machine and in this case they're like the power hammer stuff of push it

657
00:43:56.301 --> 00:44:01.120
up and lower with one
dealt with weights are all fast,

658
00:44:01.121 --> 00:44:03.710
which are mostly from fast,
which fibers.

659
00:44:03.711 --> 00:44:08.330
So they really responded well well to that.
Um,

660
00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:09.920
what body,
just since you mentioned it,

661
00:44:09.921 --> 00:44:14.690
which muscle groups respond best to this type of training?

662
00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:20.060
All of them.
All of them.
Postural muscles,
they're slow twitch fibers.
You need to,

663
00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:25.680
they need to have endurance.
Keep your posture locked in his,
sorry,

664
00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.250
I end every workout standing against the wall.

665
00:44:28.251 --> 00:44:31.950
And then this was the thing that neval like most about my seminar.

666
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:35.520
<v 2>Standing against the wall,
you know,
get,
get,</v>

667
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:38.280
get a little slot in the smaller your back.

668
00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:42.780
Put your heels and butt against the wall and your shoulders back,
your head back.

669
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.680
Walk off and leave.
Look over your cheekbones.
Don't lift,

670
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:49.980
don't drop your head and start looking down.
Your whole spine collapses.

671
00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:52.950
So look straight ahead.
If you need to look down,

672
00:44:52.951 --> 00:44:56.730
just look down over your cheekbones.
Don't drop it.

673
00:44:57.010 --> 00:44:58.650
Just sent your head and the rest of you.

674
00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:02.040
So this is to establish proper posture.

675
00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.620
It is to establish proper foster,

676
00:45:04.621 --> 00:45:09.621
but also to maintain it and to have a sort of nobility,

677
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:13.650
having good posture.
It really makes a difference in your mental attitude.

678
00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:18.150
Are you working your entire body every,
uh,
your entire body every day?
No,

679
00:45:18.151 --> 00:45:22.860
I'm not because I may want to.
I might do lakes in show.

680
00:45:22.861 --> 00:45:27.861
It was one day and I almost never do curls because it just ego and muscles

681
00:45:28.351 --> 00:45:30.970
anyway.
But,
um,

682
00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:34.290
I would just go around and do a variety of exercises.

683
00:45:34.291 --> 00:45:39.150
I make sure to get everybody group a couple of times a week and I'm cycling

684
00:45:39.151 --> 00:45:43.600
through and I do a lot of laughs and a lower back and leg work.

685
00:45:43.601 --> 00:45:48.060
And the shoulder work.
When you in season 10 to 15 minutes,
how do you choose,

686
00:45:48.061 --> 00:45:51.660
let's just take an example in the shoulder press.
Uh,

687
00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.840
how are you determining what week to use?

688
00:45:54.841 --> 00:45:58.060
Is it a percentage of say one rep concentric,
uh,

689
00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:02.560
and then what is the tempo number of repetitions?
If you could just give us,

690
00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.920
give us an idea of,
of the programming of that.

691
00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:10.800
I'm such an instinct or trading trainer.
Like Arnold Diaz.
Yeah.
Um,

692
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:16.280
I might,
I just don't have a regular way.
I just do it.
Okay.

693
00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:20.850
Do you go to the point where you start to lose the ability to control the

694
00:46:20.851 --> 00:46:25.710
descent or when do you terminate as I do,
I have some sense of fatigue,

695
00:46:25.711 --> 00:46:30.711
but what I do is I push it up really fast and quickly and very precise form,

696
00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:36.300
very lots of acceleration and then coming down really slow.

697
00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:41.570
And if to a full good stretch,
you have to,
if you remember,

698
00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:45.150
we have this giant protein in your muscles is tightened protein.

699
00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:49.260
It's the stress sensor.
And stress,
by the way,

700
00:46:49.261 --> 00:46:54.240
will stimulate [inaudible] in protein synthesis.
The stretch.
Yes.

701
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:58.300
That's the,
is that I might be getting this wrong myotonic reflex.

702
00:46:58.301 --> 00:47:00.470
Am I getting there on something that I don't know what I'm talking about?

703
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:04.320
Please continue.
Yeah.
I want to,
okay.
Well there's a signaling domain down in the,

704
00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:08.400
and,
uh,
the titan protein passes.

705
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:12.780
It sets the architecture of the home muscle really,
and that,
and the action.

706
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:16.180
If there's,
there's a Cytoskeleton,

707
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:19.680
a skeleton in the muscle itself and these acting fibers,

708
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:25.540
and if their struts and send,
if they send stretching you,

709
00:47:25.541 --> 00:47:30.280
you get the dystrophin protein.
This senses the,
the distortion

710
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.130
<v 3>of the,
um,
of the enclosure of the muscle.</v>

711
00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:36.790
And then at the titans senses the extension in the muscle.

712
00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:42.070
That means you want to really go for two a full stretch.

713
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:46.090
If you actually anxious,
if you did curls and never fully stretched,
you would,

714
00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:47.560
you'd have a little tiny muscle.

715
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:52.240
You've got to stretch the muscle out in Goldberg's work in all of it.

716
00:47:52.241 --> 00:47:57.241
All kinds of work on muscle shows that full extension you lengthen the muscle to

717
00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:03.190
on linkedin.
Muscle is stronger and fuller when it's contracted and it's faster.

718
00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:09.250
So I go,
I want my muscles to be not too big.
Lean.

719
00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:14.380
Well in quick what,
uh,

720
00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:16.390
from a distant evolutionary template,

721
00:48:16.391 --> 00:48:21.040
what would have mimicked the centrics aside from downhill running?

722
00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:26.350
What actually any kind of running does it as you know,
because every impact,

723
00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:31.210
eccentric,
uh,
stress,
any kind of lowering,

724
00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:35.580
of course you had to lift and lower things.
Um,

725
00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:40.780
I suppose care even carrying is a certain degree of a eccentric exercise,

726
00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:43.480
but I only see this is,

727
00:48:43.481 --> 00:48:47.620
this is stone age plus high tech and high tech.

728
00:48:47.621 --> 00:48:51.430
Part of it is looked at Macaluso looses work on stem cell

729
00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:56.230
activation.
I'm going to start to work on it as well.

730
00:48:57.490 --> 00:49:02.470
I want an efficient time,
time efficient exercise,
keep me injury free.

731
00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:07.360
Entry free is really very important.
I've had almost no injuries in,

732
00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:12.340
in the gym over 60 years using using gems.

733
00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:15.340
I can think of one when,
when the injury,

734
00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:19.900
so you're efficient injury-free the fast,

735
00:49:19.901 --> 00:49:24.160
which type of fibers are the ones that you're hitting when you do descending and

736
00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:27.580
when you get older,
your motor neurons aren't as effective.

737
00:49:27.581 --> 00:49:32.350
So you want to have the kind of heavy stimulation of the vast,
which fibers,

738
00:49:32.351 --> 00:49:34.540
they're the ones that have the biggest motor neurons.

739
00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:40.660
And the way to do that as negatives I there is a very safe,
very effective,

740
00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:44.440
of course you can't do negatives on everything because you know,

741
00:49:44.441 --> 00:49:47.350
it's awkward and uh,
what have you.
So you can,

742
00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:52.351
you can at least concentrate on accelerating smoothly and rapidly up and then

743
00:49:52.721 --> 00:49:54.820
descending slowly.
I mean,

744
00:49:54.821 --> 00:49:58.750
Doug McGuff this sort of stuff and they're probably the best thing about his

745
00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:02.180
exercise is the slow descent.
Yeah.
Yeah.

746
00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:06.070
But I would never work out hard enough where I have to rest a whole week.

747
00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:09.520
I do something every day.
What's the,
uh,

748
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:13.600
what's the rationale behind behind that as opposed to having longer rest

749
00:50:13.601 --> 00:50:17.080
intervals?
Okay.
Well I want to renewal signal every day.

750
00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:22.870
The renewal signal is one,
it's,
it's the fasting before exercise.

751
00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:28.060
Then the fasted.
When do you work out typically?
When do you do this?
15 minutes of

752
00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:32.960
<v 2>a out at 11 o'clock in the morning typically.
So if he got it,</v>

753
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:36.560
so I'll get up at like seven or six and I'll have a,

754
00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.090
a mild breakfast at like eight.
What would be,

755
00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:44.600
would be some of your default breakfasts?
Well,

756
00:50:44.601 --> 00:50:49.600
my favorite default of breakfast is a giant swell,
tricky lake

757
00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.940
with a bit of Mellon.
Uh,

758
00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:58.130
they're very inexpensive and they're fun to eat.

759
00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:03.290
Sounds fantastic.
I wish I had some of that here.
Unfortunately,

760
00:51:03.291 --> 00:51:08.291
I did not go to two big Turkey legs package at Walmart even,

761
00:51:09.231 --> 00:51:10.960
and a w one,

762
00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:14.930
one Turkey leg and maybe half a third of a melon.
Got It.

763
00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:20.120
And then,
uh,
I will work out at 11.
I'll have a 15,

764
00:51:20.121 --> 00:51:23.150
20 minute workouts because I like to go around and see if there any girls

765
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:26.390
Saturday at two while I'm there.

766
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:28.410
And uh,

767
00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:33.290
I won't eat until four hours after I'll eat like at five o'clock.

768
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:35.060
Got It.
So that's your,

769
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:37.880
that's your evening meal and then you don't eat between five.

770
00:51:37.881 --> 00:51:41.450
And when do you typically go to sleep?
I might go to bed at 11.
Okay.
All right.
No,

771
00:51:41.451 --> 00:51:41.881
but so you,

772
00:51:41.881 --> 00:51:45.560
so you'd finish your last meal by say six o'clock and then have four or five

773
00:51:45.561 --> 00:51:50.050
hours of fasting before bed?
That's correct.
Got It.
Okay.
I won't eat,
tell,

774
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:54.590
you know,
maybe even lunch the next day.
It just depends.
Got It.

775
00:51:54.591 --> 00:51:59.120
I'm just taking,
I never have three meals a day.
I sometimes have,
um,

776
00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:04.280
uh,
one,
sometimes none.
Most Times too,

777
00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:07.940
but you don't have to cut calories.
It's just the timing.

778
00:52:07.941 --> 00:52:11.910
It's the intervals between meals where you have low insulin signalling,

779
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:15.890
high atop g and proteostasis mechanisms.

780
00:52:15.891 --> 00:52:20.820
Like the proteasome is eating up enzymes and you're clearing the damage.
You're,

781
00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:25.220
you're a topics you peaks at about four hours after four to six hours,

782
00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:27.830
uh,
after,
um,
exercise.

783
00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:32.780
I hope these guys who who guzzle right after the,
after their workout,

784
00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:35.780
they're killing,
they're killing the adaptive process.

785
00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:41.170
You can't have without a proper Tawfiq g your muscles degenerate.

786
00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:45.860
You have to clear the old damaged proteins and that's how you do it.

787
00:52:45.861 --> 00:52:48.920
Then the proteasome is that little core shape,

788
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:51.260
barrel shaped object in the,

789
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:56.890
in the cell that that consumes mostly enzymes that have done their job clears

790
00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:58.290
enzymes.

791
00:52:58.290 --> 00:53:03.290
If you have enzymes to stay there too long or are our neuro neuro factors of

792
00:53:03.711 --> 00:53:08.570
some kind like Lincoln stress hormones,
you have to eat those up.

793
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:13.310
The whole thing is dynamic protein generation and clearance.

794
00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:17.660
So what I'm doing is I'm working out,

795
00:53:17.661 --> 00:53:22.661
I'm stimulating the topic you process and the prettiest Stacey's PR proteostasis

796
00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:29.970
is protein quality maintenance process.
So by full,

797
00:53:29.971 --> 00:53:33.990
four hours later,
that's,
that's B,
it's over and I'm good and hungry.

798
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:37.650
I have a nice big meal.
What does dinner look like?

799
00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.150
Would be an example of a,
of a dinner that you enjoy.

800
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:45.080
But I'll have my wife hands me something and usually it's a,

801
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.990
I used to do all my own cooking when,
when after my first wife passed away.

802
00:53:48.991 --> 00:53:52.640
But uh,
now she's such a great cook of the,

803
00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:57.650
have a big mound of a Spanish with lots of garlic in it and uh,

804
00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:02.550
they may be,
uh,
she makes a lot of pot roast her own way though,

805
00:54:02.551 --> 00:54:07.420
has won an Italian way.
Um,
of course a fair not amount of steak.

806
00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:11.760
I'll have an occasional prime rib,
but I always cut the excess fat off.

807
00:54:11.761 --> 00:54:16.000
I don't like fatty beats.
Is that just a personal preference or is there a,

808
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:21.660
is there a scientific reason behind her is just palette?
It's both.

809
00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:25.650
It's both personal.
I,
I trust my taste and if,

810
00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:29.420
if something is just like,
oh,
this is too much of this,
uh,

811
00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:33.160
the back off it.
The other part of it is if,
um,

812
00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:35.880
if you want to have a fatty liver,
you Elana fat,

813
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:39.630
there's no way around it.
Got It.
Yeah.

814
00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:45.120
You know your oxidized energy sources according to how easy the RDX oxidize.

815
00:54:45.301 --> 00:54:46.920
So first carbohydrate goes.

816
00:54:46.921 --> 00:54:51.720
Then maybe protein or fat but fast elastico so it has to go somewhere.

817
00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:56.880
And excess adipose tissues,
one of the worst things you can do.

818
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.590
My body composition so crucial,

819
00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:02.610
and if you get your liver starts filling up with that,

820
00:55:02.611 --> 00:55:06.590
this is fat where it shouldn't be this topic fat and it built,

821
00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:11.250
then it's also building up in your bone marrow,
in your muscle and your thymus,

822
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.170
you know in your brain.

823
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:19.190
So there's fatty degeneration is a source of stem cell differentiation.

824
00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:26.160
Stem stem cell will come wandering out and say,
I'm going to fix this muscle,

825
00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:31.140
but it encounters of a lot of fat in the muscle so it differentiates into an

826
00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:33.450
adipocyte instead of muscles.

827
00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.720
Remember these stem cells are burnt plastic.

828
00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:41.840
They can take on a fete depending on the tissue they arrive to and what signals

829
00:55:42.961 --> 00:55:44.070
they receive.
Their local,

830
00:55:44.071 --> 00:55:49.071
it's local as well as the global signals that are causing them seek body bill is

831
00:55:49.411 --> 00:55:51.930
always knew it was volume that build mass.

832
00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:56.370
I think this is really generally true.
You lots and lots of volume.

833
00:55:56.371 --> 00:56:00.600
Even two workouts a day they used,
I was around a lot of these guys.
Sure.

834
00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:04.100
I get the volume in a different way.
I work out everyday,

835
00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:08.670
but maybe 20 minutes at the most.
Right.
I do take one day.

836
00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:13.830
I don't work out at all.
What do some people in the Paleo Movement get wrong?

837
00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:19.020
What do you think of the most common errors are logical fallacies or,

838
00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:24.010
or,
uh,
damaging fads or trends that you observe and

839
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:25.690
<v 1>people who self identify as Paleo.</v>

840
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:29.480
<v 3>Very interesting.
Uh,
because they are,</v>

841
00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:33.800
there are a lot of little tribes inside.
Oh sure.
A lot of factions.

842
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:35.710
And I don't,
frankly,

843
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:39.830
I don't keep track of these guys to just too many people trying to say too many

844
00:56:39.831 --> 00:56:42.320
things.
They eat too much fat.

845
00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:48.230
Absolutely true.
They,
a lot of them went off while wildly ended the,

846
00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:52.650
into fat consumption.
So they probably have fatty liver,
spleen.
Now I really,

847
00:56:52.651 --> 00:56:53.484
I mean,

848
00:56:53.730 --> 00:56:58.730
you cannot eat large amounts of fat and not have a fatty liver.

849
00:56:59.630 --> 00:57:03.770
You can't look at the Internet.
Who needs all the energy they're trying to,

850
00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:05.690
they're worried about energy balance.

851
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:09.550
I don't get worried about energy balance to you.
They uh,

852
00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:13.080
they think there are particular kinds of foods they have to eat,

853
00:57:13.410 --> 00:57:18.150
but really variety and
flavor,

854
00:57:19.590 --> 00:57:23.580
texture,
color.
That's,
that's how you choose your meals.

855
00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:28.050
<v 1>What,
what are your thoughts on,
I,
I,
I love your Facebook page by the way.</v>

856
00:57:28.051 --> 00:57:31.010
I do have questions about why you got rid of your blog,
but I,

857
00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:36.080
your Facebook has sort of information density than I've seen in almost any other

858
00:57:37.770 --> 00:57:39.960
Facebook page.
And uh,

859
00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:43.020
what are your thoughts on coconut oil and coconut products?

860
00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:46.310
I wouldn't do it.
You wouldn't do it.

861
00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:50.870
Now does that come back to the fatty liver and just a percentage of your total

862
00:57:50.871 --> 00:57:54.560
intake is as fat?
Well,
first of all,
it's,

863
00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:58.720
<v 3>it's an evolutionary nonsequitor doesn't follow you.</v>

864
00:57:58.730 --> 00:58:02.320
You wouldn't not be seeing large amounts of coconut

865
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:08.590
consumption in the Paleolithic.
So it that it,

866
00:58:08.591 --> 00:58:13.591
it's just odd verse the fall and it's kind of a fad second of all.

867
00:58:13.931 --> 00:58:14.764
And there,

868
00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:18.030
who knows that the manufacturers of these things are all shines of impurities.

869
00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:21.940
So theater involved,
um,

870
00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:26.650
it doesn't taste good either.
I don't think you go,
I'll confess.

871
00:58:26.651 --> 00:58:30.190
I'm pretty second.
Coconut has got so much fat in it already.

872
00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:35.220
Why would you ever need to have any additional source of fat and the evening

873
00:58:35.810 --> 00:58:37.750
olive oil I'm sparing with

874
00:58:38.010 --> 00:58:40.800
<v 1>do you cook eggs or do you consume eggs?
Sure you do.</v>

875
00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:45.680
How do you prepare your eggs?
Fried.
Boiled scramble.

876
00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:50.710
So if you,
if you fry them,
what are you using to fry in or scrambled?
What uh,

877
00:58:50.730 --> 00:58:54.650
are you using a small amount of olive oil using butter?
Are you using

878
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:58.380
<v 3>small amount of olive oil and then a moderate temperature?
And I don't know.</v>

879
00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:01.530
Actually I haven't seen my wife cooking the h lately.
I don't know how she does

880
00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:06.600
oil free would be perfectly fine with me.

881
00:59:06.601 --> 00:59:10.710
If you had a pan that one of these ceramic pans that,
uh,

882
00:59:10.810 --> 00:59:11.760
we're think slide off,

883
00:59:12.790 --> 00:59:15.940
she never burns a Nagy there and they're always wonderfully done.

884
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:19.960
I used to throw a yoke away when I'd eat four boiled eggs,
you know,

885
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:22.160
<v 1>would do you,
would</v>

886
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.960
<v 2>you still do that if you are consuming eggs?</v>

887
00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:29.090
I find the Yolk Fifth Arden in chased and I don't like two months ago,
but I,
I,

888
00:59:29.091 --> 00:59:33.290
but I don't throw,
but it gets tired of ancient,
very tired very quickly.
Got It.

889
00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:36.260
Yeah.
I found a,
I love eggs,

890
00:59:36.261 --> 00:59:39.710
but they only recently discovered a few years ago.
Uh,

891
00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:44.830
and it's so simple how to make proper soft boiled eggs so you have a nice

892
00:59:45.021 --> 00:59:49.640
delicious yolk as opposed to the yellow golf ball of the hard boiled,

893
00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:54.860
which is just so chunky and unpleasant.
Yes.
Yes.

894
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:59.360
So let's talk a little bit about,
you mentioned the,

895
00:59:59.410 --> 01:00:04.410
the consumption of say post workout carbohydrates and amino acids or whatever it

896
01:00:05.841 --> 01:00:09.860
might be.
A love to chat a little bit about [inaudible].

897
01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.270
So this is,

898
01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:16.580
this is a big subject and a lot of people are trying to minimize am tor

899
01:00:19.310 --> 01:00:21.710
activation in the,

900
01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:24.830
in the hope of extending lifespan and health span.

901
01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:29.420
And uh,
so I'd love in general,
here are your thoughts on,

902
01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.020
on that where people are,
say,

903
01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:34.670
doing everything they can to minimize activation of mtor and they're trying to

904
01:00:34.671 --> 01:00:35.630
remove a leucine.

905
01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:40.070
They're trying to get their IGF one is lowest possible.

906
01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:45.470
Uh,
so thoughts in general and I'm torn.
Then also on the use of say,

907
01:00:45.471 --> 01:00:48.230
rapamycin or Metformin will look

908
01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:55.040
over proliferation or hyper proliferation is considered to be one of the evils

909
01:00:55.041 --> 01:00:59.510
of modern world,
but it was a necessary adaptation in the past.

910
01:00:59.511 --> 01:01:02.890
You couldn't have survived if you didn't proliferate rapidly in the presence of

911
01:01:02.891 --> 01:01:05.780
food because you wouldn't have got a chance later on.

912
01:01:05.790 --> 01:01:07.670
You had to be very effective at doing that,

913
01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:11.480
but there would have been in the evolutionary times that would have been a

914
01:01:11.481 --> 01:01:14.600
protein quality control process following that,

915
01:01:14.601 --> 01:01:19.070
because you've had a fairly long interval without food,

916
01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:22.700
so over driving him toward was never a problem.

917
01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:28.960
They're talking in the modern world about people who were never shut him off.

918
01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:31.011
Basically,

919
01:01:31.011 --> 01:01:36.011
if you don't have these intervals between meals and you're over driving em

920
01:01:36.171 --> 01:01:39.710
Taurus,
so you're creating lots of misfolded proteins,

921
01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.750
proteostasis is collapsing.

922
01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:46.040
The first thing is si elegans does when it starts to die as his proteostasis

923
01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:50.900
collapses.
Sealing and [inaudible] are our favorite worm.
Yes,

924
01:01:50.901 --> 01:01:52.100
for a lot of studies.

925
01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:57.080
So you don't want your proteostasis to collapse.
It's not going to collapse.

926
01:01:57.081 --> 01:02:01.520
If you have these intervals between meals.
If you don't turn on an tour,

927
01:02:01.521 --> 01:02:05.700
your immunity is not going to function properly because you proliferate the
year,

928
01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.740
your five ascites and your your t cells,

929
01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:15.170
your whole immune system.
RAPPA.
Meissen isn't immune suppression as president,

930
01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:19.950
right?
Yeah.
Because you're shutting down m tour.
All toxins shutdown him tour

931
01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:24.930
<v 3>because you can't try and transcribe in the presence of a toxin or are you going</v>

932
01:02:24.931 --> 01:02:29.520
to proliferate that the torch and is going to invade all the new tissues you're

933
01:02:29.521 --> 01:02:30.354
making.

934
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:35.520
So proliferation in mtor and inventories of the whole thing.
By the way,

935
01:02:35.521 --> 01:02:39.810
you stimulate him to order through mechanical stress.
When you,

936
01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:41.040
when you're,

937
01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:46.040
when you're consuming damaged proteins inside yourself indoors being signaled,

938
01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:50.340
why is that the case will,
because those protocols,

939
01:02:50.341 --> 01:02:55.020
amino acids are now available and you have to have that because if you don't,

940
01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:56.910
you don't.
The innate immune,

941
01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:00.720
the an innate stress response can't be activated.

942
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:06.180
Gene transcription changes when you're under stress,

943
01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:10.530
first of all,
because you don't want to make proteins in a stressful situation.

944
01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:15.930
Second of all,
you have to encode other genes to month.

945
01:03:15.931 --> 01:03:20.931
The stress response and him towards doing that because it's getting the amino

946
01:03:21.421 --> 01:03:25.620
acids if you're coming from the proteostasis process,

947
01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:30.300
so if,
if they want a chronically turned down the MTR,
they're gonna,

948
01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:31.630
they're gonna to waste away.

949
01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:37.250
You need IGF one in the rescue of neurons that are struggling and stressed and

950
01:03:37.591 --> 01:03:39.180
you make IGF one locally,

951
01:03:39.181 --> 01:03:43.920
not they're confusing systemic IGF that is in the serum,

952
01:03:43.921 --> 01:03:48.900
in the blood,
right from the local.
There's local signaling and there's

953
01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:54.900
global cycling is some sense and in the circulation and you're getting your

954
01:03:54.901 --> 01:03:58.920
global signals,
but in the,
in the muscle or in the brain,

955
01:04:00.090 --> 01:04:03.150
when you activate,
when you used,
when you exercise your muscles,

956
01:04:03.151 --> 01:04:07.860
you actually create local Iga of one that doesn't necessarily go out into the

957
01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:13.170
bloodstream.
I have very low serum IGF one,

958
01:04:13.171 --> 01:04:16.140
but I have lots of muscle in it because I make it locally.

959
01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:19.320
I had a doctor looked at me and said,

960
01:04:19.321 --> 01:04:22.110
you can't have that kind of muscle and have such low IGF one.

961
01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:26.190
And I said,
well,
am I make it locally

962
01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:35.910
where he's used to seeing national wrestlers and so forth stoking up on insulin

963
01:04:35.911 --> 01:04:38.980
and other such things?
Right?
Well,
it's kind of like all the,
uh,

964
01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:43.230
all the hipsters in San Francisco or they say think globally by locally.

965
01:04:43.231 --> 01:04:46.470
We'll say you're thinking globally and making your IGF

966
01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:51.870
thick.
I make it locally,
but you know what?
A muscle contraction will,

967
01:04:52.290 --> 01:04:53.940
will turn on Akt.

968
01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:57.300
And so you're not coming through the insulin pathway,

969
01:04:57.301 --> 01:05:02.280
but the second half of the year,
rescuing Akt as a survival hormone,

970
01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:05.570
survival and protein there,

971
01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:09.120
they're thinking about the insulin pathway exclusively.

972
01:05:09.121 --> 01:05:10.920
But you got other factors down there.

973
01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:14.480
There's a wonderful work done by a Japanese Isand,

974
01:05:14.481 --> 01:05:19.481
Merona [inaudible] and others who show that if you can overexpress a Katie in

975
01:05:20.381 --> 01:05:24.580
the muscle,
that's,
that's protein kinase B also,

976
01:05:24.581 --> 01:05:28.300
or whatever it is they have,
um,
it'll heal your liver.

977
01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:33.700
So exercise your muscles and heal your liver.
And how do you do that?

978
01:05:33.701 --> 01:05:37.090
You Express Akt and the fast twitch muscle fibers.

979
01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.010
So in those studies,

980
01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:44.070
were these researchers using a high intensity weightlifting protocol?

981
01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:45.521
No.

982
01:05:45.521 --> 01:05:50.521
There was merely engineering the genes in the mouse to overexpress a KT and the

983
01:05:51.671 --> 01:05:55.680
fast twitch fibers.
Profoundly effective,

984
01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.870
profoundly effective.
You can't read that,

985
01:05:58.871 --> 01:06:02.740
aren't study a series of studies by this group as a mirror.

986
01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:07.690
And uh,
you can't read that without saying,
I want all the fast twitch fibers.

987
01:06:07.691 --> 01:06:12.250
I can have it.
They're not a leak disposing glucose.

988
01:06:12.251 --> 01:06:16.120
They're taking the glucose disposal burden off the liver,
right?

989
01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:17.200
And off the brain.

990
01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:22.680
So these insulin like peptides that are signaling in the brain too often you're,

991
01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:26.800
you're turning,
turning on down because of the,

992
01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:32.400
you're taking their glucose disposal burden off the other cells and therefore

993
01:06:32.471 --> 01:06:34.840
you're reducing insulin signaling and those cells.

994
01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:39.190
And it turns out that when you contract muscle,

995
01:06:39.191 --> 01:06:43.030
you make this a four B,
e p e or something like that,

996
01:06:43.031 --> 01:06:46.540
which interrupts trans transcription.

997
01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:49.750
What you want to do is you want to have,

998
01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:53.320
you don't want to beach and transcribing new proteins in your brain when it's

999
01:06:53.321 --> 01:06:57.730
not time to do.
So.
You want to be improving the quality of the neurons.

1000
01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.800
So if you,
if you exercise,

1001
01:06:59.950 --> 01:07:04.950
you reduce transcription in other cells because this particular protein that

1002
01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:09.070
binds to m Tory and keeps it from initiating transcription,

1003
01:07:09.590 --> 01:07:14.530
the if things of m four does amp tours overreaching in any way?
It's um,
it's the,

1004
01:07:14.590 --> 01:07:16.450
it's the ribosome that really matters.

1005
01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:23.230
Please Mr what will tell us more about the Ribas zone?
Well,

1006
01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:25.060
the reivers zone and uh,
yeah,

1007
01:07:25.061 --> 01:07:29.580
if you could make it as a start a start at the basics.
Okay.

1008
01:07:29.581 --> 01:07:32.470
Well and I could blame that on my audience and say for those who don't know,

1009
01:07:32.471 --> 01:07:34.660
but like I would actually like to have to get myself,

1010
01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:39.490
well when you're going to make a new protein that messenger RNA comes out,

1011
01:07:39.730 --> 01:07:40.680
it's a string.

1012
01:07:42.210 --> 01:07:47.210
The reivers zone is just a little beat led structure that runs across the string

1013
01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:50.500
and it's,
it's charged with amino acids.

1014
01:07:50.501 --> 01:07:55.501
It reads the signals on the Messenger Rna and its transcribes these long strings

1015
01:07:58.121 --> 01:07:58.954
to proteins.

1016
01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:03.880
Then they go off and they go live and then they're folded and what have you.

1017
01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:07.660
It's actually like a universal Turing machine remembered challenge.

1018
01:08:07.690 --> 01:08:10.060
Alan Turing said you can,

1019
01:08:10.061 --> 01:08:14.940
you can make any computer if you just have a rewriter head and a tape

1020
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:17.340
<v 2>test with the ribosome is,</v>

1021
01:08:17.341 --> 01:08:20.690
is the ReadWrite head that runs along the tape and makes proteins.

1022
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:25.400
My neighbor UCI was the world's leading expert on Ribas zones.

1023
01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:29.870
God is so complicated,
it gives you a headache every time I've talked to him.

1024
01:08:29.871 --> 01:08:34.160
So I finally came up with this idea,
well,
it's a term universal turning machine.

1025
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:39.770
It's going across the,
the re-tape is a messenger RNA.

1026
01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:45.560
The right tape is that the protein that is made is by the,
by the ribosomes.
Well,

1027
01:08:45.561 --> 01:08:49.490
the reivers zone
commonly been very complicated.

1028
01:08:49.491 --> 01:08:54.410
It's very adaptive in how,
what would it transcribes?
So Fox,

1029
01:08:54.411 --> 01:08:56.930
that will change the transcription factors.

1030
01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:02.380
So therefore change that in this messenger RNA and the reivers zone were run

1031
01:09:03.231 --> 01:09:03.981
across there.

1032
01:09:03.981 --> 01:09:08.981
And between those two that are like any universal computer is,

1033
01:09:09.001 --> 01:09:13.040
is inheriting what they can do.
So you change the transcription factor,

1034
01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:18.970
you wrinkle up the DNA a little bit and and expose other areas for

1035
01:09:19.491 --> 01:09:20.330
transcription.

1036
01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:26.290
And the reivers zone is what is the coding factor that handles the integrated

1037
01:09:27.441 --> 01:09:32.441
stress response protein transcription changes toward instead of making new

1038
01:09:33.981 --> 01:09:34.551
proteins,

1039
01:09:34.551 --> 01:09:39.310
you're making these stress responsive factors and that's it.
That's,

1040
01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:40.580
that's integral to the,

1041
01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:45.840
to the survival process that happens in as a in response to resistance training

1042
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.090
or,
yes.
Got It.
Yes it does.

1043
01:09:50.091 --> 01:09:55.091
You're make Fox so you all through the transcription of your DNA,

1044
01:09:55.730 --> 01:10:00.170
you'll make new messenger RNA and the bribe a zone.

1045
01:10:00.710 --> 01:10:03.210
If it's a sense of stress in the cell,

1046
01:10:03.230 --> 01:10:08.230
it'll begin transcribing these protective factors instead of like making all new

1047
01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:13.450
proteins.
It'll switch.
Andrew Dillon is a wonderful paper on that.

1048
01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:19.940
Uh,
his group is taking the,
where is he based or where does this team,

1049
01:10:19.941 --> 01:10:24.050
Berkeley,
Berkeley man.
My back yard is right up there in the bay area.

1050
01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:27.290
You may be a UC San Francisco.
He has,

1051
01:10:27.291 --> 01:10:29.690
he has a quantitative biology group there.

1052
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:35.590
And so in doing that then in shifting the transcription to what you were just

1053
01:10:37.311 --> 01:10:42.080
describing to the survival,
yes.
Porous or stress response,

1054
01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:46.670
stress response factors,
factors.
We're bolstering that renewal program.
Yes.

1055
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:51.560
The failure of which is implicated for what we call aging.

1056
01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:57.010
That's precisely right at your immunity is brought up also during this,

1057
01:10:59.390 --> 01:11:03.260
everybody,
everybody who does anything in aging these days is finally agreed.

1058
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:08.600
Basically,
it's a stress response that that's what keeps you going,

1059
01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:13.190
that that maintains the cells,
protects them.
And uh,

1060
01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:14.610
hormesis

1061
01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:18.510
<v 3>is like just one if they wanted to leave it on all the time,</v>

1062
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:21.960
but that would exhaust you.
You can't,
you can't.

1063
01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:26.990
The poised for every possible kind of damage Reber the,
the world's full of

1064
01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:31.500
maybe trillions of different kinds of damage that can happen to you.

1065
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:36.230
And you can't have a precisely tuned damage response to each threat.

1066
01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:41.940
They have to be generalized and they're generalized through certain

1067
01:11:42.571 --> 01:11:46.140
transcription factors.
And through the way the FRY persona makes proteins.

1068
01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:52.020
So these generalized stress responses,
they're right across the immune system.

1069
01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:54.600
They run across the stem cell system,

1070
01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:59.800
they run across the protein synthesis across survivors zone.

1071
01:12:00.370 --> 01:12:03.990
All of these pathways intersect and every one of them in coats,

1072
01:12:03.991 --> 01:12:06.340
some kind of stress response,

1073
01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:11.470
cell protective pathway that's responding to a toxin,

1074
01:12:12.250 --> 01:12:15.310
rapamycin to a,
a bacteria.

1075
01:12:18.150 --> 01:12:21.010
The thing you don't want to have happen is when a bacteria is in there,

1076
01:12:21.011 --> 01:12:24.880
you don't want to be transcribing proteins,
have a bacteria we'll get into,

1077
01:12:24.881 --> 01:12:26.920
then you'll be making proteins for the bacteria.

1078
01:12:28.530 --> 01:12:32.130
So you've gotta be able to shut down transcription at the right time.

1079
01:12:32.131 --> 01:12:36.810
But if you can't shut down transcription or [inaudible] toric completely because

1080
01:12:36.811 --> 01:12:41.020
then you can't make the defensive factors that are required.
And there,

1081
01:12:41.050 --> 01:12:43.920
this is where these micro RNA seem to come in.

1082
01:12:44.230 --> 01:12:47.860
<v 1>Are you interested or not interested in say intermittent use of something like</v>

1083
01:12:47.861 --> 01:12:50.350
rapamycin?
Do you find,
do you find that,

1084
01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:53.260
is that just trying to make a deal with the devil?
Is that,

1085
01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:57.430
are there too many unknowns or is,
is is something like that interesting to you?

1086
01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:01.080
<v 3>To me,
I,
I don't,
it's a deal with the devil.
Okay.</v>

1087
01:13:01.290 --> 01:13:03.390
I haven't even had a colon in 40 years,

1088
01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:08.250
so I want to invest my immune system.
So,
aside from the

1089
01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:10.060
<v 1>the,
let's say the,</v>

1090
01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:13.870
the way that you eat and the spacing of your meals that we discussed and the

1091
01:13:13.871 --> 01:13:18.220
resistance training,
what other factors are behaviors,

1092
01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:23.020
interventions,
do you think have contributed to not being sick for decades?

1093
01:13:23.230 --> 01:13:26.260
<v 3>Stay away from pill people.
Stay away from people</v>

1094
01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:32.290
of what I could.
When I was teaching at the university,

1095
01:13:32.291 --> 01:13:36.760
I had a class with 400 people in it and half of them had just gotten back from

1096
01:13:36.761 --> 01:13:39.940
China and were coughing and sneezing and so forth.

1097
01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:45.460
I was sort of the universal substitute teacher because everyone else got sick

1098
01:13:45.461 --> 01:13:48.760
and they knew art wouldn't be sick.
They'd call me off to go teach your classes.

1099
01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:52.690
It's,
it's,
it's spooky in a way.
So do you,
is it just

1100
01:13:53.730 --> 01:13:57.450
<v 1>picking,
you're picking your parents wisely or is it a,
is there,
is there more,</v>

1101
01:13:57.460 --> 01:13:58.380
are there other factors,

1102
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.440
<v 3>other factors?
Like you expose yourself to some coal.
Hmm.</v>

1103
01:14:03.230 --> 01:14:07.160
You stretch your muscle,
you,
you,
uh,

1104
01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:12.040
you get plenty of good sleep,
very important.
You've it and you kind of have

1105
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:17.040
<v 2>these functional m tore windows during your sleep.</v>

1106
01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:20.800
You've gotta,
you've gotta live in one window of the other.

1107
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:25.540
Is it growth repair window?

1108
01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:28.870
It's Lynn window and there's the Fox though.

1109
01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:34.230
Window insulin tor versus Foxhall as how I see my my life and I'm going from one

1110
01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:40.000
window to the,
uh,
the cause.
It can't smell be Voxa,
Etho exome,

1111
01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:44.860
s four kit box
proteins.

1112
01:14:44.890 --> 01:14:46.870
Therefore human versions of it.

1113
01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:53.340
So important in your cognitive function,

1114
01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:56.800
which starving Fox and what makes you want to move

1115
01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:02.950
the Fox who would do for you then would be part of good sleep,

1116
01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:07.090
which is why you're not going to eat within four or five hours.
I'm going to bed.

1117
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:11.230
You're going to,
you're going to spend the first window of sleep,

1118
01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:14.770
sort of rebuilding tissues.
Second window of sleep,

1119
01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:19.800
you're into the start start foxo mode and you're also altering your synapsis.

1120
01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:23.230
There's an interesting new gene is called homer.

1121
01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:28.570
It counts if it floods into your brain.

1122
01:15:28.571 --> 01:15:33.571
Yet when your excitatory fact signaling is depressed,

1123
01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:36.570
not much glutamate in the neuron.

1124
01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:41.300
So homework got xen and it shrinks your synapsis.

1125
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:45.910
It's very appropriately named.
That's hilarious.

1126
01:15:46.570 --> 01:15:51.400
It is hilarious as proportional
shrinking.
In other words,

1127
01:15:51.401 --> 01:15:56.401
you're going to say 10% each synapse is going to shrink by 10% the biggest

1128
01:15:57.041 --> 01:15:59.230
synopsis or the most active ones,

1129
01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:02.200
that's where post traumatic stress lives.

1130
01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.780
So if you can shrink those,
they have to be stable.

1131
01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:12.840
But if you keep rehearsing that same synapse constantly is going to grow in in

1132
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:13.531
strength.

1133
01:16:13.531 --> 01:16:18.531
And people who reverberate thoughts in their mind or ruminate a lot fake it.

1134
01:16:19.090 --> 01:16:23.260
They get depressed because of those circuits.
According to jail,
they Edelman,

1135
01:16:23.290 --> 01:16:28.030
that's neural Darwinism.
The circles are Arwen is a neural Darwinism.

1136
01:16:28.031 --> 01:16:28.690
Darwin,

1137
01:16:28.690 --> 01:16:33.130
there's Darwinian competition going on inside your cells everywhere.

1138
01:16:33.190 --> 01:16:38.190
So for those people listening who do ruminate and a percentage rate,

1139
01:16:38.710 --> 01:16:43.600
that's another good word,
constantly and get depressed.
What,

1140
01:16:44.050 --> 01:16:48.750
what advice might you give them?
Star in exercise exercise now the,

1141
01:16:49.450 --> 01:16:53.470
the I you know you,
you seem like you have more to say.
So I'll leave.

1142
01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:56.110
Please continue.
Wellstar starboard exercise,

1143
01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:58.820
but to something that's totally different so that you,

1144
01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:03.730
you set up neurocircuits they compete with the ones that are ruminating and

1145
01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:05.650
building and strength in your,

1146
01:17:06.370 --> 01:17:10.340
in your brain that the starvation part of it is to eat up some of these,

1147
01:17:10.341 --> 01:17:15.341
some of these diff dysfunctional synapses that my saying is for every damaged

1148
01:17:15.531 --> 01:17:17.090
molecules there's a damage thought

1149
01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:23.740
and you're a depressed brain or a brain that is,

1150
01:17:25.530 --> 01:17:29.780
uh,
you know,
as post traumatic stress,

1151
01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:34.040
those are injured neurons inside the brain and you just need to get rid of the

1152
01:17:34.041 --> 01:17:39.041
dysfunctional molecules that are causing those neurons to malfunction.

1153
01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:43.640
So I guess,
yeah,
I mean,
I of course,
I mean it seems self evident,

1154
01:17:43.641 --> 01:17:46.900
but these people,
it goes,
it goes both ways,
right?
I mean,

1155
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:50.330
for every damaged thought,
there's a damaged molecules if you asking about,

1156
01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.880
rather than trying to think your way out of that problem,
uh,

1157
01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:55.100
heal the brain first.

1158
01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:58.730
He'll Thursday deal their brain and you heal it with neurotrophic factors

1159
01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:02.990
outside,
be outside,
um,
new thoughts,

1160
01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:08.000
new new patterns of behavior.
How would you feel the sense,
silly to ask,

1161
01:18:08.001 --> 01:18:12.720
but how would you feed those new thoughts?
If a cave,
I loved one of yours was,

1162
01:18:12.721 --> 01:18:14.990
was getting depressed and exhibiting these symptoms,

1163
01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:19.830
what would you prescribe to them?
Well,
you know,
one of my first wife was,

1164
01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:24.380
was declining
from a whole host of other things.

1165
01:18:24.381 --> 01:18:28.490
I take her walk in as much as I could.
I would tell her bad jokes.

1166
01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:33.830
It changed their surrounding.
So you know,

1167
01:18:33.831 --> 01:18:35.520
the typical things that people have to do,

1168
01:18:35.550 --> 01:18:39.170
being outside is enormously effective there.

1169
01:18:39.230 --> 01:18:41.510
They're stimulii you can't even relate to you.

1170
01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:45.980
You bet you perceived him and your unconscious brain is what's going to heal

1171
01:18:45.981 --> 01:18:46.814
your first.

1172
01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:52.220
And the unconscious brain is more healthy when it's exposed to nature and a

1173
01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:58.780
happy people and children and dogs are DNR for our friend of all.

1174
01:19:00.771 --> 01:19:03.470
I think it's dumb thing I'm getting is attribution rate.
But he said the,

1175
01:19:03.471 --> 01:19:05.840
the first,
the first,
uh,

1176
01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:10.900
first rule of a conflict resolution or minimizing conflict is to not spend a lot

1177
01:19:11.781 --> 01:19:15.870
of time around people who are constantly in conflict.
Thought that was,

1178
01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:18.920
I thought that was a good rule.
Well our politics is exposed to that.

1179
01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:20.000
So turn off the news,

1180
01:19:21.170 --> 01:19:24.980
the news you mentioned in passing cold exposure.

1181
01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:29.320
So this is something that I've found to be tremendously,
uh,

1182
01:19:31.190 --> 01:19:35.340
effective in mood elevation,
uh,
among other things.
But how do you,

1183
01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:38.420
how do you expose yourself to cold?
Well,

1184
01:19:38.421 --> 01:19:42.380
I walk the dogs early in the morning with almost no jacket or anything.
Just,

1185
01:19:42.381 --> 01:19:47.090
just go out and get nice and chilly with him.
Cold showers there.

1186
01:19:47.091 --> 01:19:50.810
Where do you live now?
Oh,
southern Utah.
So it's not as cold,

1187
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:55.600
no longer UCLA around camping.
No it's not.
But even,

1188
01:19:55.610 --> 01:19:59.740
even though if you live in a Jesuit,
like climate is cool in the morning.
Sure.

1189
01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:03.080
Quite cool.
In the morning.
Uh,
I keep the pool coal,

1190
01:20:03.710 --> 01:20:07.100
I don't heat the pool much.
Uh,
and I take cool.

1191
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:11.790
<v 1>I don't try to shock myself.
What,
so you then know,</v>

1192
01:20:11.791 --> 01:20:15.490
this is may seem like a non sequitur,
which is most of my brain,
but,
uh,

1193
01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:18.420
we were talking about what you'd taught,
uh,

1194
01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:23.070
Nasim as it related to exercise.
Are there anything in any,

1195
01:20:23.071 --> 01:20:28.071
any particular things that you've learned from him or or PR and that could be

1196
01:20:28.291 --> 01:20:31.410
what you used his book to illustrate in your class or anything else?

1197
01:20:31.810 --> 01:20:35.380
<v 3>Oh,
sure.
I mean,
he,
first of all,
he is a marvelous writer.</v>

1198
01:20:35.710 --> 01:20:37.150
He tells stories in a way.

1199
01:20:37.151 --> 01:20:41.430
I could never tell that Tony and Tony,
right.

1200
01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:46.510
He creates marvelous characters that embody the kind of thinking he wants to

1201
01:20:46.511 --> 01:20:51.400
ridicule or,
or,
or,
or,
or,
or power point out is,

1202
01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:55.090
you know,
savvy.
He likes street smarts like I do.

1203
01:20:55.530 --> 01:20:57.980
We both like mass smarts to,
I mean actual,

1204
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.310
he went to the courant institute and he's very well trained mathematician far

1205
01:21:02.311 --> 01:21:05.010
better than I,
I guess.
Yeah.

1206
01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:09.740
We all need a black swan hunting device.
Is,
is some sin in some sense.

1207
01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:14.840
I could,
I tried to create a financial device,
crook for a partner who is too,

1208
01:21:14.841 --> 01:21:18.920
too dumb to be over,
take this anywhere.
But I've,

1209
01:21:18.921 --> 01:21:23.921
I've figured out ways of using Kurtosis to finance pharmaceuticals.

1210
01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:27.810
Could you define Kurtosis please and spell that?

1211
01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:31.470
It's a measure of the odd shape of the distribution.

1212
01:21:31.471 --> 01:21:36.200
It's high VP skewed off to the right or something.
It looks very non normal.

1213
01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:39.960
There's no assemble a Belfair no,

1214
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:44.040
but it's a thing of beauty because if it's where life lives,

1215
01:21:44.130 --> 01:21:45.520
that's where life is in,

1216
01:21:45.530 --> 01:21:49.740
in that kind of at their fractal type distribution is like a parade or

1217
01:21:49.741 --> 01:21:54.600
distribution men.
Then they dropped down at the,
at the minimum.

1218
01:21:55.670 --> 01:21:56.503
Um,

1219
01:21:56.920 --> 01:22:01.860
<v 1>see you reveal up that for a pharmaceutical development you said yes,</v>

1220
01:22:01.890 --> 01:22:04.680
yes I had,
cause if the boom

1221
01:22:04.750 --> 01:22:04.960
<v 3>I,</v>

1222
01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:09.060
the last talk I gave at Harvard was between what's it compared to the movies to

1223
01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:10.020
pharmaceuticals.

1224
01:22:11.190 --> 01:22:15.210
And it turned out that they were the same kind of statistical distributions.

1225
01:22:16.670 --> 01:22:20.760
Lepto Crittenton it sounds like something you Chicago for.

1226
01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:23.760
It's actually a thing of beauty.

1227
01:22:23.761 --> 01:22:28.761
It's a skewed and biased to the right in with a very long heavy tail,

1228
01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:34.360
heavy tailed being.
Cause every tail is long in a sense.

1229
01:22:34.361 --> 01:22:37.540
But they become very thin.
It has a lot of probability out there.

1230
01:22:38.890 --> 01:22:39.723
That's um,

1231
01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:44.200
that's the true power law distribution of prey to distribution and so forth.

1232
01:22:44.440 --> 01:22:49.300
So it turns out pharmaceuticals that way because a few pharmaceutical cell,

1233
01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:53.530
billions and billions and billions of dollars or like $12 billion a year.

1234
01:22:53.531 --> 01:22:58.150
Most pharmaceutical sell about half a million or a billion maybe at most.

1235
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:03.640
It's the big outliers that dominate the industry in ribbon hers.

1236
01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:05.673
So

1237
01:23:06.610 --> 01:23:07.780
<v 1>using that skew,</v>

1238
01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:13.360
you can design a swamp black instrument that uses the upper tail with pay the

1239
01:23:13.361 --> 01:23:17.170
lower tail.
And it,
if you,
if you divide it correctly,

1240
01:23:17.890 --> 01:23:22.420
you have a very favorable kind of gamble.
So his black would,

1241
01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:23.313
would uh,

1242
01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:28.000
tell EBS black swan hunting device then be derivatives training.

1243
01:23:28.030 --> 01:23:32.530
Would that be how or where would it be something in addition to that?

1244
01:23:32.531 --> 01:23:35.400
Actually you're the one that talks about that cause you're the guys just who's

1245
01:23:35.401 --> 01:23:39.280
found all the black swans with the startups.
Yeah,
I mean that's,

1246
01:23:39.370 --> 01:23:41.260
that's certainly my,
well,

1247
01:23:41.261 --> 01:23:44.140
I mean the way that we're going to maybe get off the reservation here for a

1248
01:23:44.141 --> 01:23:44.501
second,

1249
01:23:44.501 --> 01:23:49.501
but the way I've thought about that is because I do not have the mathematical

1250
01:23:53.050 --> 01:23:58.000
modeling background of you,
nor a Nasim or anybody else.

1251
01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:01.690
I,
it's not a funny story.
It's kind of a tragic story.
But 10th grade,

1252
01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:05.230
my brother and I had two different math teachers.

1253
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:08.240
I had a math teacher who was very caustic,
um,

1254
01:24:09.250 --> 01:24:13.350
really had a chip on our shoulder and berated students.
Sounds like nursing.

1255
01:24:14.650 --> 01:24:18.420
Well,
he had a different response.
I think Nassim is more pugnacious than I am.
So,

1256
01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:21.130
so,
so he showed her his teacher.

1257
01:24:21.620 --> 01:24:26.080
I decided to choose my college based on lack of math requirement.

1258
01:24:26.081 --> 01:24:30.490
My brother had a fantastic teacher.
He now has a phd in statistics.
Oh,

1259
01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:34.180
isn't that something?
There's an extreme event right there.

1260
01:24:34.450 --> 01:24:39.070
A little small event.
But it really changed the course.
Yeah,
it,
uh,
it,

1261
01:24:39.071 --> 01:24:43.660
it completely changed the course of my life.
And therefore in my case,

1262
01:24:43.690 --> 01:24:47.390
when I remember having a conversation with a hedge fund manager and there are

1263
01:24:47.550 --> 01:24:50.650
plenty of bad hedge fund managers out there and I don't think they go by that

1264
01:24:50.651 --> 01:24:53.710
name anymore,
but there are some very,
very brilliant people in the game.

1265
01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:58.040
And I spoke with one and I'm not going to get this totally right and uh,
and uh,

1266
01:24:58.690 --> 01:25:01.030
do it justice.
But he said,
you can have,

1267
01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:04.390
there are a number of different advantages you can have and you need to have at

1268
01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:06.910
least one.
And he said you can have an informational advantage,

1269
01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:11.710
analytical advantage.
You could have a,
uh,

1270
01:25:11.770 --> 01:25:15.250
say a behavioral advantage.

1271
01:25:15.850 --> 01:25:20.770
Meaning if you're someone like a,
there are plenty of people who try to imitate,

1272
01:25:20.771 --> 01:25:21.604
say buffet,

1273
01:25:21.610 --> 01:25:25.790
but they emotionally react to the market differently then above fear monger.

1274
01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:29.320
Sure.
And so on and so forth and are many of these.
And what I realized was,

1275
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:34.090
given my sets of strengths and weaknesses where I could capitalize was in the

1276
01:25:34.091 --> 01:25:38.350
informational advantage by placing myself in the center of the switchbox in

1277
01:25:38.351 --> 01:25:42.730
Silicon Valley.
So that became my way of hunting for black swans.

1278
01:25:43.090 --> 01:25:46.640
Fantastic.
If you can handle the information load,
it is coming through there.

1279
01:25:47.010 --> 01:25:47.260
Well,

1280
01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:52.260
you know what was so odd about it in a sense or counterintuitive for a lot of

1281
01:25:53.621 --> 01:25:55.230
people,
I described this to and and uh,

1282
01:25:55.340 --> 01:25:57.730
not seem to actually informed my thinking a lot on this because,

1283
01:25:57.731 --> 01:26:01.360
and I'm again not going to do his description justice,

1284
01:26:01.361 --> 01:26:06.361
but thinking in a barbell fashion where I have the vast majority of my assets

1285
01:26:06.441 --> 01:26:08.670
and investments are cash or cash equivalents.

1286
01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:13.780
And then I have this smaller portion that is speculative but a very asymmetrical

1287
01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:20.050
returns.
If,
if,
if I can think through basic portfolio management properly.

1288
01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:25.710
And what I realized for myself is that I have an emotional disadvantage when it

1289
01:26:27.221 --> 01:26:29.410
comes to publicly traded anything.

1290
01:26:30.010 --> 01:26:32.900
I respond very poorly to,
uh,

1291
01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:36.420
compulsively despite knowing it's not my best interest.

1292
01:26:37.110 --> 01:26:41.250
Looking at watching people freak out and the sky is falling and then I become

1293
01:26:41.251 --> 01:26:43.920
chicken little and I sell at the worst time.
So what's,

1294
01:26:43.921 --> 01:26:46.140
what's fantastic about startups for me,

1295
01:26:46.141 --> 01:26:50.210
and I do not recommend this to anyone who does not have a significant advantage.

1296
01:26:50.211 --> 01:26:55.050
As I did that I would do all of my homework,
make a decision,

1297
01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:56.970
invest,
and then I couldn't sell.

1298
01:26:57.030 --> 01:27:00.870
It was a liquid and that turned out to be a very good thing.
I was locked in,

1299
01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:05.860
so I had to do all of my homework on the front end.
And then,
uh,

1300
01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:09.960
there was no ticker tape for me to watch,
no charge for me to watch really.
And,

1301
01:27:09.961 --> 01:27:13.620
uh,
it's,
it's just worked out fantastically.

1302
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:18.140
I had a professor who was long and sugar when the Castro revolution hit

1303
01:27:19.710 --> 01:27:23.700
and he finally said,
I can't take it anymore.
I gotta clear my physician.

1304
01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:30.150
Oh man,
it's,
yeah,
no,
it's,
it's,

1305
01:27:30.151 --> 01:27:34.290
I'm really,
really,
really bad at anything that I can watch moving up and down.

1306
01:27:34.290 --> 01:27:38.180
So I need to address that in my own life and a lot of ways.
But,
so we're,

1307
01:27:38.181 --> 01:27:42.970
we're talking about,
uh,
well for instance,
talking about the,
the sugar position.

1308
01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:44.830
And I remember asking,

1309
01:27:44.890 --> 01:27:48.730
a friend of mine is a very good investor about liquidating certain positions or

1310
01:27:48.731 --> 01:27:50.920
not.
And he said,
well,
I think you should just look at,

1311
01:27:50.921 --> 01:27:54.850
as I was asking him for certain dollar ranges,
how he runs the math,
and he said,

1312
01:27:54.851 --> 01:27:59.650
I just sell down to sleep.
Uh,
sleep at night level.
That's exactly it.

1313
01:27:59.651 --> 01:28:04.030
So selling to sleep at night levels and uh,
you mentioned getting good sleep.

1314
01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:05.320
What are,

1315
01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:09.760
what are the things that you do or don't do to help ensure good sleep for

1316
01:28:09.761 --> 01:28:13.330
yourself?
Well,
here's probably the only supplement I take.

1317
01:28:13.331 --> 01:28:17.530
I do take some Melatonin,
Melatonin.
And do you take that on a daily basis?

1318
01:28:18.170 --> 01:28:23.150
<v 3>Sometimes.
Uh,
but it's like I didn't bring any with me on a trip far right,</v>

1319
01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:25.170
so forth.
I don't do anything right here,

1320
01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:30.730
but I'm Melatonin and as much more than just a sleep aid.

1321
01:28:31.150 --> 01:28:32.630
It's founding plants.

1322
01:28:32.631 --> 01:28:36.320
It's a resistance stress resistant to protein.

1323
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:40.680
It does have powerful antioxidant properties,

1324
01:28:40.681 --> 01:28:43.440
but you need oxidants to AWC stocks.

1325
01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:46.770
Oxidative molecules are signaling molecules as well,

1326
01:28:46.771 --> 01:28:51.771
but you need a proper balance of signaling versus chronically seedling oxidative

1327
01:28:54.271 --> 01:28:58.500
molecules.
But there's some other direct itself.
I think it,

1328
01:28:58.501 --> 01:29:02.490
it stimulates autophagy in the brain or some of these more fundamental processes

1329
01:29:03.450 --> 01:29:06.480
<v 1>that,
uh,
maybe it brings out a homer</v>

1330
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:12.210
out of his cave.
I know you are,
you how,

1331
01:29:12.690 --> 01:29:16.290
how do you think about dosing?
Is this cycle one milligram,
a three milligram?

1332
01:29:16.530 --> 01:29:21.060
Do you have any idea?
Um,
five,
five,

1333
01:29:21.061 --> 01:29:23.580
sometimes 10.
Wow.
Okay.

1334
01:29:23.581 --> 01:29:27.720
So that's a dose that I would use if I flew to Hong Kong to correct my sleep

1335
01:29:27.721 --> 01:29:30.720
cycle.
Sure he would.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Few weeks and it would work.

1336
01:29:30.721 --> 01:29:35.100
But I don't do it for sleep.
I do it for the other things.
It does.

1337
01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:38.370
Got It.
And do you worry at all in this,

1338
01:29:38.371 --> 01:29:40.740
this has been a sort of certain things you,

1339
01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:45.090
you are not terribly interested in like rap bison.
Do you worry at all,

1340
01:29:45.190 --> 01:29:47.700
and this is the question that came to mind.
I haven't asked him directly,

1341
01:29:47.701 --> 01:29:52.080
but dumb,
uh,
who we know Dominic D'Agostino also uses Melatonin on a very,

1342
01:29:52.081 --> 01:29:52.920
very regular basis.

1343
01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:57.090
Do you worry about any type of negative feedback loop or tolerance development

1344
01:29:57.091 --> 01:29:59.880
or side effects from chronic use of Melatonin?

1345
01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:02.310
A lot of people do,

1346
01:30:02.311 --> 01:30:05.340
and I maybe I did at one time when I didn't know enough about it.

1347
01:30:05.370 --> 01:30:06.660
But actually it's not,

1348
01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:12.680
you're not going to shut down the pineal gland from making Melatonin because

1349
01:30:14.761 --> 01:30:16.800
you're,
because you're not releasing,

1350
01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:20.950
stimulating it to make it in the first place.
You're not,
you're,

1351
01:30:20.951 --> 01:30:24.930
you're thinking in terms of a hoe homeostatic balance.
No,
its own,

1352
01:30:25.950 --> 01:30:26.401
I'm not,

1353
01:30:26.401 --> 01:30:30.750
I'm thinking about it as a search that's springing up protective pathways I

1354
01:30:30.751 --> 01:30:33.840
think in a completely different way.
And I don't even take it to sleep.

1355
01:30:33.841 --> 01:30:38.670
I take it to Raul to keep my brain to summon homer.

1356
01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:49.260
Actually everything I think of,
I think in terms of those protective pathways,

1357
01:30:49.261 --> 01:30:52.680
immunity restore,
restoration pathways,

1358
01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:54.570
the whole,

1359
01:30:54.570 --> 01:30:58.440
the whole knowledge that I thought I had before is sort of out the window and

1360
01:30:58.441 --> 01:31:01.520
you're thinking in terms of these molecular pathways.
Let's,

1361
01:31:01.530 --> 01:31:03.930
I'd like to explore that a little bit.
And this is going to,

1362
01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:09.020
I'm sure uncover a fairly deep level of ignorance on my part.

1363
01:31:09.151 --> 01:31:13.290
But if we're thinking about,
I know very little about Melatonin,
uh,

1364
01:31:13.291 --> 01:31:16.620
but I have taken it in the past.
If,
if we're looking at say the,

1365
01:31:17.050 --> 01:31:20.700
how does production,
well,
I'm trying to frame this.

1366
01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:24.350
If I think of the,
the,
uh,
HP ta,

1367
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:27.030
I think that the hype with Hypothalamus,

1368
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:30.630
pituitary testosterone access and the ways that that can be disrupted.

1369
01:31:30.631 --> 01:31:34.770
If you supplement with say,
testosterone or,
uh,
leuteinizing hormone,

1370
01:31:34.771 --> 01:31:38.310
which I guess would be hcg when you're injecting it or taking it some other
form,

1371
01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:39.241
even if say,

1372
01:31:39.241 --> 01:31:43.560
testosterone or growth hormone or for that matter or released in surges,

1373
01:31:43.561 --> 01:31:47.680
it's not,
not continual,
right?
Much like Melatonin.
Um,

1374
01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:53.530
why wouldn't regular consumption of Melatonin?
Because,
uh,

1375
01:31:53.610 --> 01:31:57.170
some type of of Mount Malfunction and I just don't know if it's one thing in a,

1376
01:31:57.171 --> 01:32:00.500
in a large stream of,
of other elements that I don't know about.

1377
01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:04.710
<v 3>I don't have the answer to that either.
It's first of all,
you're positing fifth.</v>

1378
01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:05.573
There's a feedback.

1379
01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:10.120
<v 1>No,
I haven't,
I don't know.
I'm just,
I'm not even positive.
I'm just asking.</v>

1380
01:32:10.210 --> 01:32:13.540
<v 3>Yup.
So I w I wouldn't necessarily pause it,
that feedback,</v>

1381
01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:19.440
a pathway to begin with because I don't think it's a homeostatic ah,

1382
01:32:20.110 --> 01:32:25.030
balanced fair.
I don't think it's that the body attempts to maintain pulses are,

1383
01:32:25.650 --> 01:32:28.720
or,
uh,
a balance of mill the tone.
And I think it's,

1384
01:32:29.050 --> 01:32:31.600
you actually make it during the day too.
It's not,
it's not,

1385
01:32:31.601 --> 01:32:35.940
the sleep hormone is a defensive hormone.
I mean,
it's in plants,
plants,

1386
01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:38.390
so don't have to get their rest or sleep.

1387
01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:44.000
They're not moving around all their much.
Uh,
it's,
it's an ancient,

1388
01:32:44.001 --> 01:32:48.320
ancient hormone.
It's evolutionarily conserved across almost all species.

1389
01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:52.340
And,
uh,
I used to know a lot about it.

1390
01:32:52.341 --> 01:32:54.110
I haven't thought about it and it's been a while.

1391
01:32:54.111 --> 01:32:57.470
So you caught me a short short of knowledge.
Well,

1392
01:32:58.610 --> 01:33:03.030
<v 1>maybe this is a,
a good place to talk about the,</v>

1393
01:33:03.150 --> 01:33:07.480
the limits of human knowledge and,

1394
01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:09.780
uh,
for instance,
in reading,
uh,

1395
01:33:09.930 --> 01:33:14.930
the Black Swan Nassim talks about epistemological arrogance fair about.

1396
01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:20.730
And,
uh,
and I think just to give people an example of that,

1397
01:33:20.731 --> 01:33:25.440
just to bring it down
to a eat more easily interested level.

1398
01:33:25.470 --> 01:33:27.390
I very good friend of mine,
well,

1399
01:33:27.391 --> 01:33:31.340
a lot of doctors says any good doctor will generally say,
you know,

1400
01:33:31.470 --> 01:33:36.120
50% of what we know is wrong.
We just don't know which 50%.
Yeah.

1401
01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:41.170
So very true.
How do you think about human knowledge,

1402
01:33:41.171 --> 01:33:44.620
what we can know versus what we can't know?
Uh,

1403
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:47.500
and then this very broad question,
but that,

1404
01:33:47.501 --> 01:33:51.760
that was one of the topics that a novel recommended bouncing around in this

1405
01:33:51.761 --> 01:33:55.100
conversation.
So,
uh,
I ended,
okay.

1406
01:33:55.280 --> 01:34:00.280
This is something that has caused me to go from taking a lot of supplements to

1407
01:34:00.711 --> 01:34:02.240
taking fewer supplements,
for instance,

1408
01:34:02.241 --> 01:34:04.970
because there's so many historical case studies of

1409
01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:10.140
carrots are good for us.
We think they improve eyesight,

1410
01:34:10.170 --> 01:34:13.800
we attributed to Beta carotene,
then we start taking mega doses of Beta carotene.

1411
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:16.350
Oops.
It turns out there's a lot more to the story now.

1412
01:34:16.351 --> 01:34:19.330
We've created all of these yeah.
Unanticipated side effects.

1413
01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:23.950
<v 3>Yeah.
I think even if you look at a static diagram,</v>

1414
01:34:23.951 --> 01:34:28.390
I'm something like the [inaudible] pathway.
Like,
Gosh,
it's so complicated.

1415
01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:33.070
And then you realize and all they'll have to be in the right sequence to these

1416
01:34:33.071 --> 01:34:33.701
molecules,

1417
01:34:33.701 --> 01:34:36.850
have their move with the right speed and have the right doses and so forth.

1418
01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:39.970
You never be able to figure that out.

1419
01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:45.290
So what you have to do is you have to be an experimentalist maybe,

1420
01:34:45.550 --> 01:34:50.040
maybe on yourself,
like you and I do,
um,
vaping on your,

1421
01:34:50.210 --> 01:34:52.720
on your child or your dog on Molly.

1422
01:34:54.670 --> 01:34:57.440
I actually had to experiment on my child.
I didn't like to,

1423
01:34:57.441 --> 01:34:59.630
but I had to because the doctors were killing him.

1424
01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:02.960
So I don't want to get into that too much.

1425
01:35:02.961 --> 01:35:06.800
But you have to be willing to test hypotheses.

1426
01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:08.100
Why?

1427
01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:13.100
Why not just admit that nature knows a lot more than we do and try to live as

1428
01:35:14.011 --> 01:35:15.380
simple,
clean,

1429
01:35:15.381 --> 01:35:20.381
decent life and eat good food and go hungry now and then mimic,

1430
01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:22.910
mimic those patterns.

1431
01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:26.690
There's an error correction mechanism inside each one of us.

1432
01:35:27.170 --> 01:35:31.910
If you ere in terms of,
for example,
you make,

1433
01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:34.940
you make some bad cells,
some bad proteins are your,

1434
01:35:34.941 --> 01:35:36.560
some of your stem cells go bad.

1435
01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:40.370
Nature's down there cleaning and up because the other stem cell will kill it.

1436
01:35:40.970 --> 01:35:43.610
It'll consume it or shove it out of the niche.

1437
01:35:43.611 --> 01:35:46.090
Just like eagles get shoved out of,
you know,

1438
01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:47.780
Nestle's gets shoved out of the niche.

1439
01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:52.280
There's competition going on inside your body constantly.

1440
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:58.000
And if you use competition to weed out the weak and the faulty and let the

1441
01:36:01.101 --> 01:36:04.760
strong survive.
So you really are your ideas or competing.

1442
01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:08.870
Also,
everything is a,
as a question of

1443
01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:14.990
variety pruning.
Competition pruning things.

1444
01:36:15.290 --> 01:36:19.430
Like I said,
God said,
I got these different species.
I'll send out,
let's,

1445
01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:23.480
let's see what's one,
which one is best,
which one gets through the ice age.

1446
01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:29.420
That's how you do it.
And you,
your body's constantly pruning your thoughts,

1447
01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:33.950
your motivations,
your rewards

1448
01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:38.960
and sleep was the way you,
you clean all that up.

1449
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:44.770
So I want to shift gears a little bit.
I'll just ask,
uh,

1450
01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:47.390
some of what my audience knows is rapid fire questions.

1451
01:36:47.391 --> 01:36:52.230
Your answers don't need to be rapid,
but,
uh,
does this become the sort of the,

1452
01:36:52.231 --> 01:36:54.260
the,
the tail end of our chat.

1453
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:59.830
What books have you gifted most to other people or recommended most other people

1454
01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:06.770
that,
are there any particular that come to mind?
Well,
I mean,

1455
01:37:06.771 --> 01:37:10.910
I gave all my library books to the local college,
the library,

1456
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.080
and they were full of,
uh,
books.

1457
01:37:15.081 --> 01:37:18.620
I'm
not philosophy.

1458
01:37:18.621 --> 01:37:21.540
I've thrown my philosophy books away.
Why is that?

1459
01:37:23.370 --> 01:37:26.210
The pointless,
empty,
empty questions for the most part,

1460
01:37:26.211 --> 01:37:29.000
they're not testable hypotheses.
Got It.
Yeah.

1461
01:37:29.570 --> 01:37:32.960
I've been generous with my thoughts more than I have with my,

1462
01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:34.430
my books in a sense.

1463
01:37:34.431 --> 01:37:39.431
I've gifted the bulk of my knowledge that I've developed on my webpage in a my

1464
01:37:40.041 --> 01:37:45.041
first essay on evolutionary fitness and acknowledge their quote out there about

1465
01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:48.590
the Paleo lifestyle,

1466
01:37:48.591 --> 01:37:53.591
I think was a real gift I gave to a lot of people who've carried on and then

1467
01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:55.100
developed it further.

1468
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:57.930
<v 2>And I was,
wasn't the originator,</v>

1469
01:37:57.931 --> 01:38:02.010
but Lauren and I were both sort of thinking about Loren Cordain and I were

1470
01:38:02.011 --> 01:38:06.780
thinking about these things simultaneously.
I kept telling him,
don't jog Lauren.

1471
01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:10.170
Don't jog.
Yeah,
I think he probably still doesn't think,

1472
01:38:10.171 --> 01:38:15.030
I'm sure he's quite healthy still.
Um,
so that's,
that's,

1473
01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:16.550
that's the primary gift.

1474
01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:21.560
And I gifted many dissertation topics to graduate students.

1475
01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:26.190
I've ran more graduate students at the universities where I work in.

1476
01:38:26.191 --> 01:38:30.900
Anyone else in the department.
The students were drawn,
joined to me,

1477
01:38:30.901 --> 01:38:35.160
but my ideas were kind of complicated and it was not necessarily a good

1478
01:38:35.161 --> 01:38:38.310
dissertation there in the,
in the usual sense.

1479
01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:44.370
Good News.
You have me as an advisor,
bad news.
It's a hard topic.

1480
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:52.310
Are there any particular books that have a very heavily influenced you or books?

1481
01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:56.820
What,
what are books that you've,
uh,
re-read,
if any come to mind?

1482
01:38:57.090 --> 01:39:00.900
I actually read the Journal Literature.
I don't read very many books anymore.

1483
01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:01.920
Scientific literature.

1484
01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:06.840
Where do you go hunting for literature and how do you decide what to read?
Um,

1485
01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:09.000
I choose a topic and I,

1486
01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:13.860
I look very broadly at the topic from a mathematical point of view,

1487
01:39:13.861 --> 01:39:15.330
from a biological point of view,

1488
01:39:15.331 --> 01:39:20.010
which is what all my reading now I must to have a library of hour graphy is

1489
01:39:20.011 --> 01:39:24.030
getting close to 8,000 entries in this aging literature.

1490
01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:28.770
And what a goofy literature,
some of videos,
you know,
I mean it's,

1491
01:39:29.730 --> 01:39:34.730
there's some fantastic articles there and then there's just a lot of fluff and

1492
01:39:34.831 --> 01:39:39.030
redoing and reviews and,
and sometimes the article will,

1493
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:43.050
the abstract of the article won't be as long as the listing of authors.

1494
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:49.430
It's really a weird field.
A party party review.
Yeah.

1495
01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:52.440
They figured out how to get citations.

1496
01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:59.420
Economist never,
we don't call it through that much.
And yeah,

1497
01:39:59.670 --> 01:40:03.890
maybe one or two coauthors at the most.
Well,
I mean,
if,
uh,

1498
01:40:04.290 --> 01:40:05.760
humans respond to incentives,
right?

1499
01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:13.770
I,
uh,
is that mostly pub med?

1500
01:40:13.771 --> 01:40:16.380
What sources do you like to use?

1501
01:40:16.381 --> 01:40:19.530
Are you subscribing to particular journals themselves?

1502
01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:22.830
I still look professional marriages,
so I have access to

1503
01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:28.200
applications.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Not Bad.

1504
01:40:29.550 --> 01:40:31.530
Don't get into reading about diets.

1505
01:40:31.531 --> 01:40:36.230
It's an endless literature and is pretty lousy.
What are in the,
in the fields,

1506
01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:39.990
uh,
or field of aging longevity,

1507
01:40:39.991 --> 01:40:43.180
although I feel like that where it's kind of tainted,
but uh,
it is,
yeah,

1508
01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:47.350
life extension on that one too.
I don't even know what to what to call it,
but uh,

1509
01:40:48.330 --> 01:40:53.160
what are the current
wild goose chases in your opinion

1510
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:54.940
<v 3>or,
or areas that are</v>

1511
01:40:56.830 --> 01:41:00.490
potential dead ends or things that are just getting way overblown in your mind?

1512
01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:04.970
I do think fees,
uh,
attempts to manipulate him tour are

1513
01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:09.960
kind of pointless.
If you're chronically shutdown AMG jar,

1514
01:41:09.961 --> 01:41:12.670
you're going to shrink to nothing.
You're not going to make new proteins.

1515
01:41:14.050 --> 01:41:17.530
It's windows.
So you got to have a,
you got to have these switches.

1516
01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:23.400
The most fruitful papers that I re talk about a pathway that crosses another one

1517
01:41:24.671 --> 01:41:28.810
and they have switches.
Your turn them on and off you age in this window,

1518
01:41:28.811 --> 01:41:32.170
you don't agent that windows one way to look at it.
Yeah,
yeah.

1519
01:41:32.171 --> 01:41:33.280
That's a helpful way to look at it.
Yeah.

1520
01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:36.130
So you just want to have the not anti aging.
Yeah.

1521
01:41:36.250 --> 01:41:38.470
You want to be defending or renewing.

1522
01:41:38.471 --> 01:41:43.471
But most people in today's life are renewing on a continuous basis and so

1523
01:41:44.231 --> 01:41:48.960
they're misfolding proteins and they're damaging the cells and building fat in

1524
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:51.790
tissues where it doesn't belong and so forth.

1525
01:41:52.300 --> 01:41:57.190
So I think all these attempts to stall him our,
our,
uh,
really kind of weird,

1526
01:41:58.750 --> 01:42:01.960
you don't want to stall if you don't want to over proliferate,

1527
01:42:01.961 --> 01:42:06.040
but I actually want to be capable of proliferating when it's essential because

1528
01:42:06.041 --> 01:42:10.110
when you want to renew a cell or rebuild,
rebuild tissues,
you,
uh,

1529
01:42:10.150 --> 01:42:14.320
you'd have to be able to do that.
Bodybuilding and the whole,

1530
01:42:14.321 --> 01:42:19.321
that whole notion of regularity and chronic are totally wrong.

1531
01:42:20.010 --> 01:42:24.700
You got to have switches,
windows and you go back and forth,

1532
01:42:24.701 --> 01:42:28.960
you alternate,
you kind of alternating states is the way to think about things.

1533
01:42:29.710 --> 01:42:32.680
And the problem is some of the people have looked at,
for example,

1534
01:42:32.681 --> 01:42:37.060
since Cynthia Kenyon's work on the worms and so forth,
the foxo pathway,

1535
01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:40.490
there are lots of residual pathways from that.

1536
01:42:40.491 --> 01:42:45.491
Are There Fox four kid box genes that that were part of the development process?

1537
01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:51.750
They are now raise resident in the cells and can respond and defend and repair

1538
01:42:51.751 --> 01:42:56.610
of cell.
For example,
if you work out,
you crew you,

1539
01:42:56.670 --> 01:42:59.890
you trigger Fox p and foxy him proteins in your,

1540
01:42:59.891 --> 01:43:01.400
in your brain while they were in.

1541
01:43:01.420 --> 01:43:06.310
By workout you mean sprint or a resistance training?
Yeah,

1542
01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:07.990
you can jog if you want to,

1543
01:43:07.991 --> 01:43:11.160
if you want to kill some of your stem cells with them.

1544
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:17.200
No,
you got to have variety.
You've got to do all of these things.

1545
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:22.270
So I think the idea of switch switches and windows is going to come in.

1546
01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:26.800
Systemic signaling is the hottest new thing in,
in aging research,

1547
01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:30.880
which makes a lot of sense.
That is signaling at a distance.

1548
01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:35.380
I think the stem cell pathways are going to turn out to be just crucial and
very,

1549
01:43:35.381 --> 01:43:38.080
very important.
And if,
again,

1550
01:43:38.081 --> 01:43:40.450
am tourists sort of misplaced because we got,

1551
01:43:40.690 --> 01:43:42.760
we got so many sick people in the world,

1552
01:43:43.210 --> 01:43:47.610
it's bad to be average now in today's world it's really bad.

1553
01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:51.980
I've never had average looking tests,
you know,
and my

1554
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:53.420
<v 2>blood work or anything else.</v>

1555
01:43:53.421 --> 01:43:58.190
And average is average is dangerous these days.

1556
01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:00.750
You mentioned,
uh,

1557
01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:05.450
so dangerous reminded me of one thing that you said in passing and I wanted to

1558
01:44:05.451 --> 01:44:10.340
just unpack it.
It may not be a long story,
but you,
you said,

1559
01:44:10.341 --> 01:44:14.090
I've never been injured in all these decades of weight training except for one

1560
01:44:14.091 --> 01:44:18.230
instance that I can remember.
What was the one instance what happened?
Oh man,

1561
01:44:18.231 --> 01:44:23.050
it was just this weird guy in the gym.
There are a lot of those here.

1562
01:44:23.051 --> 01:44:26.660
Yeah,
yeah,
I was going to say,
yeah.
Um,
here's the old,

1563
01:44:26.690 --> 01:44:31.690
he was a fireman and he worked out at the gym and he used to do these behind the

1564
01:44:32.151 --> 01:44:35.780
neck presses.
Oh,
right.
With the Barbell,
with a barbell.

1565
01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:39.590
So he's using some whiteness,
all that.
That's nothing.

1566
01:44:39.591 --> 01:44:43.580
I wasn't warmed up or anything.
I hopped on.
I said,
well,
that's easy.

1567
01:44:43.581 --> 01:44:48.500
And I and I did it and I pulled a muscle in my neck and it hurt for three
months.

1568
01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:51.433
What are,

1569
01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:55.940
what are things that you do to help minimize the likelihood of injury,

1570
01:44:56.210 --> 01:45:00.680
whether it's some type of warmup before you go into your,
uh,
uh,
your,

1571
01:45:00.681 --> 01:45:05.390
your negative work or otherwise?
Well,
first thing I don't warm up.

1572
01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:06.940
You don't warm up.
No.

1573
01:45:08.770 --> 01:45:13.280
Started working at now when I was [inaudible] go straight to your first work
set,

1574
01:45:13.281 --> 01:45:14.300
whatever that might be.
Yeah.

1575
01:45:15.380 --> 01:45:20.090
But it's usually sort of mild and I may start with my so called famous

1576
01:45:20.091 --> 01:45:24.710
hierarchical sets,
a lightweight 15 reps,
heavier weight,

1577
01:45:25.190 --> 01:45:28.730
eight reps,
a heavier weight.
Yet for Reps,

1578
01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:33.800
you're going right up the fiber,
high hierarchy,
slow,
intermediate,
fast twitch.

1579
01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:38.450
Now you're warm,
you're warm up more,
more rapidly.

1580
01:45:38.451 --> 01:45:43.010
If you do something that's reasonably intense and then the rest of the workout

1581
01:45:43.011 --> 01:45:43.730
and you're warm.

1582
01:45:43.730 --> 01:45:48.470
I work out early in the morning when it's cold or I used to and now,

1583
01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:53.540
now that I don't have a job anymore,
I'm desired.
I work out at 11 and,

1584
01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:58.310
and every,
every time I go the right sheet,
the same guy is an x body builder.

1585
01:45:58.311 --> 01:46:00.110
You can tell him he looks good.
He's still,

1586
01:46:00.910 --> 01:46:04.010
he's there for hours and I'm in and out.

1587
01:46:05.210 --> 01:46:06.950
I don't know who looks better.
I think I do,

1588
01:46:06.951 --> 01:46:10.790
but I'm leaner and he's just more bodybuilding looking,
flicking guy.

1589
01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:14.630
And they don't,
they don't look good when they're not flex.
They don't look good.

1590
01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:15.973
Let's face it.

1591
01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:21.270
You mean you don't look like the second trimester nominal?
Oh No,

1592
01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:24.650
no.
And uh,
just for all the bodybuilders in the audience,
it's done all of you.

1593
01:46:24.651 --> 01:46:25.401
But let's be honest,

1594
01:46:25.401 --> 01:46:30.380
if we look at some of the competitors when they're not flexed,
oh,
oh boy.

1595
01:46:30.710 --> 01:46:34.670
How long?
You know,
is it a boy or a girl?
That's right.
That's exactly right.

1596
01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:40.040
So I really,
I'm,
I'm there for a little adventure for a little bit of intensity,

1597
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:43.730
not to get hurt.
So if you have long muscles,

1598
01:46:44.350 --> 01:46:47.000
you do a full range of motion,
you're not going to get hurt.

1599
01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:50.070
And you're also a generally,
at least on the,

1600
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:53.910
<v 1>on the negatives,
following a slow cadence.
Right.
I mean you're,
you're,</v>

1601
01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.870
you might be raising it quickly,
but you're lowering it entirely under control.

1602
01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:01.720
<v 3>Control can entirely under control,
but down to a full stretch,
right.</v>

1603
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.380
I haven't thinking,
I'm thinking tightened spring,
right.

1604
01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:09.550
There's a spring down there.
And so even if I'm doing positive exercises,

1605
01:47:10.030 --> 01:47:13.760
I will lower and I did a little,
not,

1606
01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:17.440
not a bounce cause fullstop balances are destructive,

1607
01:47:17.950 --> 01:47:19.810
but the little stretch balance,
right.

1608
01:47:20.860 --> 01:47:25.860
<v 1>If you were to go back to teaching and you were to teach a freshman Undergrad,</v>

1609
01:47:28.091 --> 01:47:31.180
actually it could be a freshman or a senior seminar,

1610
01:47:31.210 --> 01:47:35.530
so let's just say 15 to 40 students,
something like that.

1611
01:47:36.270 --> 01:47:40.120
Uh,
and you only have them once a week.
Let's say.

1612
01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:43.510
Let's say you have them once a week for three hours,
one semester,
what would you,

1613
01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:44.470
what would you teach them?

1614
01:47:45.630 --> 01:47:46.950
<v 3>The economics of uncertainty.</v>

1615
01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:51.240
Economics as to the last class I had developed theory UCI and I told him they

1616
01:47:51.241 --> 01:47:56.100
love that they love the class.
Economics of extreme events is really what it was.

1617
01:47:56.820 --> 01:47:57.650
Not Uncertainty,

1618
01:47:57.650 --> 01:48:02.490
the way it's taught by utility theory and all of this nice utility maximization

1619
01:48:02.491 --> 01:48:07.230
and expected this and expected that.
It's all nonsense.
It would,

1620
01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:09.720
it would be the economics of extreme events

1621
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:11.720
<v 1>if someone wanted to.</v>

1622
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:15.290
Since you're probably not going to teach that class anytime soon,
uh,
is,

1623
01:48:15.291 --> 01:48:17.570
if somebody wanted to explore that for themselves,

1624
01:48:18.050 --> 01:48:21.860
how would they self-educate any record,

1625
01:48:21.861 --> 01:48:23.400
any starting points that you'd recommend?

1626
01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:27.250
<v 3>I class notes or somewhere.
Let me show.</v>

1627
01:48:27.251 --> 01:48:30.600
You should definitely somehow crowd crowdfund getting this.

1628
01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:35.410
We start with my movie buff.
What was the title of that?
Hollywood?

1629
01:48:35.630 --> 01:48:36.860
Hollywood economics.

1630
01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:42.110
It covers a extreme events fairly,
fairly thoroughly.
In fact,

1631
01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:46.790
a lot of students looked at that.
I had other,
I had other readings as well,

1632
01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:52.510
or you could look at a climate science and look at the extreme climate theory,

1633
01:48:53.420 --> 01:48:56.990
extremes of climate fire variation and what happens.

1634
01:48:56.991 --> 01:49:00.870
You could look at the economics of storms and floods,

1635
01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:05.310
flood plain analysis,
so I would look at nature.

1636
01:49:05.790 --> 01:49:10.740
<v 1>If you were to pick one of Naseem's books to start with,</v>

1637
01:49:10.750 --> 01:49:11.480
would would you,

1638
01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:14.280
would you choose fooled by randomness or would it be one of the other?

1639
01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:18.990
<v 3>I think students learn more from full by randomness.
The Black Swan is marvelous,</v>

1640
01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.100
a as well.
Skin in the game.
It's probably going to be a terrific book too,

1641
01:49:23.190 --> 01:49:27.180
because you've got to have skin in the game.
Everybody knows that,

1642
01:49:27.181 --> 01:49:32.160
but they always ignore it.
Or you want to do a chap,
a Chinese fund,

1643
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:36.480
you've got to put skinny with him.
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh yeah.
30%.

1644
01:49:38.370 --> 01:49:41.900
Or they want,
they want incentives aligned.
They won't just cut your knuckles off.

1645
01:49:41.901 --> 01:49:46.490
You know,
it's just,
it's more,
it's,
uh,

1646
01:49:46.710 --> 01:49:48.670
I,
so the,
the economics

1647
01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:50.730
<v 2>of extreme events,
uh,</v>

1648
01:49:52.030 --> 01:49:54.760
if you could put anything on a billboard,

1649
01:49:54.850 --> 01:49:58.560
you have a gigantic billboard and you can put a short message word,

1650
01:49:58.580 --> 01:50:03.040
couple of words,
sentences,
whatever,
to get out to millions of people.

1651
01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:07.420
What would that message be?
Or whatever you would put it on the billboard.

1652
01:50:07.450 --> 01:50:09.700
It could be anything.
Well,
I used to,

1653
01:50:10.330 --> 01:50:15.330
and my principles of economics teaching the importance of freedom and arbitrage

1654
01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:23.760
arbitrage keeps you from being stupid because you compare the price of this

1655
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:29.550
relative to other equivalents are close substitutes or so forth.

1656
01:50:30.250 --> 01:50:33.310
If you do,
if you've talk mathematically about pricing,

1657
01:50:33.490 --> 01:50:36.880
you lose the anchoring from the arbitrage principle.

1658
01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:41.850
So I always taught arbitrage arbitrage.
Could you,
could you,
uh,

1659
01:50:41.890 --> 01:50:45.700
explain that maybe through an example,
I would just love to buy low

1660
01:50:47.230 --> 01:50:51.220
and sell high,
but you trade,
you have to trade different alternatives.

1661
01:50:51.221 --> 01:50:56.140
For example,
thanks.
Your pours a vacuum and economics,

1662
01:50:56.690 --> 01:51:01.090
uh,
pores and arbitrage opportunity arbitrage opportunities get eliminated.

1663
01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:05.470
Is that okay?
Gotta be,
is that just efficient?
Not Efficient market theory?

1664
01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:08.620
It's a,
a way of looking at efficient markets.

1665
01:51:09.130 --> 01:51:14.130
The best predictor of tomorrow's price of something is today's price because

1666
01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:18.340
that leaves no arbitrage opportunity.
Right?

1667
01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:21.390
If you knew the price is going up tomorrow,
we'd go up today.
You know,

1668
01:51:21.490 --> 01:51:22.600
that kind of thinking.

1669
01:51:22.900 --> 01:51:27.880
You think about opportunities where you think in terms of the arbitrage limits

1670
01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:31.810
that are there.
So I taught,
I taught general equilibrium theory as arbitrage.

1671
01:51:31.811 --> 01:51:34.750
Also.
It wasn't too successful.

1672
01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:39.130
It wasn't,
it wasn't appreciated.
But um,

1673
01:51:39.250 --> 01:51:43.110
this is how model involves general equilibrium theory.
Also ours,

1674
01:51:44.150 --> 01:51:46.450
it's the presence of arbitrage.
So would you just put

1675
01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:53.260
understand arbitrage,
would that be the message?
The Bill Borg?
Yeah.
Um,

1676
01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:59.740
no,
that it would be a freedom counts.
Freedom counts.
Yeah.
Freedom Matters.

1677
01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:03.200
And is that mostly in reference to markets or is,

1678
01:52:03.201 --> 01:52:08.080
is it freedom of contract and freedom of arbitrage,
freedom of venturing,

1679
01:52:08.650 --> 01:52:12.880
freedom of exit.
People don't have to be forced to do things.
They can exit,

1680
01:52:13.150 --> 01:52:17.260
they can think and participate.
Freedom counts.
Yeah,
I like that.

1681
01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:20.740
Uh,
what workouts to

1682
01:52:22.570 --> 01:52:25.750
lift heavy things and you know,
lift heavy things.
Freedom counts.

1683
01:52:28.140 --> 01:52:31.000
Well aren't,
we could talk for hours and hours and hours and a,

1684
01:52:31.001 --> 01:52:32.620
and then we're going to go,
go,
uh,

1685
01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:36.520
probably grab a bite to eat at some point after this.

1686
01:52:36.730 --> 01:52:40.390
But is there a,
is there anything,
and I'm going to ask you after this,

1687
01:52:40.690 --> 01:52:42.340
where people can learn more about you,

1688
01:52:42.341 --> 01:52:46.520
what you would like them to check out and certainly that'll all go in the show

1689
01:52:46.521 --> 01:52:46.791
notes.

1690
01:52:46.791 --> 01:52:51.791
But is there any or any parting words or suggestions or asks of my audience

1691
01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:55.450
something that they should test,
something they should consider,

1692
01:52:55.451 --> 01:52:58.650
anything that you'd like people to get ready to throw my,

1693
01:52:58.690 --> 01:53:00.260
for my book when it comes out on,

1694
01:53:00.261 --> 01:53:04.180
on aging as a field is full of a lot of charlatans.

1695
01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:07.930
There's some good science and there's some,

1696
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:11.930
the rest of no such thing as successful aging because aging is damage.

1697
01:53:13.170 --> 01:53:17.650
So you can't be successful if you were being damaged.
And do you have a,

1698
01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:21.620
do you have a set timeline for that or a,
a titles people should look out for?

1699
01:53:21.621 --> 01:53:24.200
Or should we just say prime yourselves?

1700
01:53:24.230 --> 01:53:26.750
It's coming and we will let you know when it comes out,
you know,
check,

1701
01:53:26.751 --> 01:53:30.290
just check my Facebook page.
That's,
that's my law.
I've given up my blog.

1702
01:53:30.291 --> 01:53:33.410
It wasn't worth the time and effort.
I did help a lot of people,

1703
01:53:33.411 --> 01:53:38.100
but that passed that.
Now I,
I've,

1704
01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:42.230
I've taken up this as a really is a scientific quest because one,
like I said,

1705
01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:44.600
I'm experienced coming up,

1706
01:53:44.601 --> 01:53:48.190
coming up on aging on 80 is um,

1707
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:52.070
you start thinking about,
you know,
when you approached Middle Age,

1708
01:53:52.071 --> 01:53:55.370
you started thinking about these things when you wait,
so you're planning,

1709
01:53:55.371 --> 01:53:56.570
you're planning your next 80,

1710
01:53:57.490 --> 01:54:02.490
the possibility the technology is coming and it is there right now inside each

1711
01:54:03.741 --> 01:54:08.510
person in,
it's the protein quality controls.
So quality control,

1712
01:54:08.780 --> 01:54:11.930
don't lose cells,
maintain them,

1713
01:54:13.090 --> 01:54:17.630
starve them there.
Within a while that's good for them.
So the technology,

1714
01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:20.060
I am applying the technology and I think I'm,
I'm,

1715
01:54:20.150 --> 01:54:24.680
I'm doing pretty well at it so far.
I do plan to live another 40 60 years.

1716
01:54:25.550 --> 01:54:28.280
I think you're doing pretty well and your arms are bulging out of your shirt,

1717
01:54:28.281 --> 01:54:32.320
which is long sleeved.
So I think things are going well.
Well Art,

1718
01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:36.780
thank you so much for the time.
I really appreciate it and uh,
this is,

1719
01:54:36.810 --> 01:54:40.750
this has been a lot of fun and for everybody listening,

1720
01:54:40.751 --> 01:54:45.250
as always you can find links to everything that we've discussed.
Okay.

1721
01:54:45.710 --> 01:54:49.820
[inaudible] Facebook page and more at Facebook,
not Facebook.

1722
01:54:50.150 --> 01:54:53.760
Let's try that again.
Four hour work week.com forward slash

1723
01:54:53.890 --> 01:54:54.680
<v 1>podcasts</v>

1724
01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:59.680
<v 2>or tim.blog/podcast they both go to the same place and you will find show notes</v>

1725
01:55:01.151 --> 01:55:04.010
for this episode and every other episode.
And

1726
01:55:04.220 --> 01:55:08.840
<v 1>until next time,
thank you for listening.
Hey guys,
this is Tim again.</v>

1727
01:55:08.841 --> 01:55:12.020
Just a few more things before you take off.
Number one,

1728
01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:17.240
this is five bullet Friday.
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1729
01:55:17.241 --> 01:55:21.380
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

1730
01:55:21.381 --> 01:55:24.920
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

1731
01:55:24.921 --> 01:55:29.270
short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

1732
01:55:29.271 --> 01:55:30.590
pondering over the week.

1733
01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:33.560
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1734
01:55:33.561 --> 01:55:37.010
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1735
01:55:37.011 --> 01:55:41.360
somehow dug up in the,
uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1736
01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:44.160
It could include favorite articles

1737
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:48.660
<v 4>that I've read and that I've shared with my close friends for instance.</v>

1738
01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:50.010
And it's very short.

1739
01:55:50.070 --> 01:55:55.050
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

1740
01:55:55.110 --> 01:55:57.270
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

1741
01:55:57.540 --> 01:56:02.220
Just go to a four hour work week.com that's four hour workweek.com all spelled

1742
01:56:02.221 --> 01:56:05.400
out and just drop in your email and you will get the very next one.

1743
01:56:05.690 --> 01:56:07.500
And if you sign up,
I hope you enjoy it.

1744
01:56:08.370 --> 01:56:12.330
This episode is brought to you by audible,
which I've used for many,
many years.

1745
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:14.930
I absolutely love audio books in there.

1746
01:56:14.950 --> 01:56:18.060
One of my favorite ways to pass the time when I travel.

1747
01:56:18.090 --> 01:56:22.350
I'm on the road all the time and audible allows me to consume many more books

1748
01:56:22.351 --> 01:56:26.700
than I possibly could otherwise I have to audio books to recommend right off the

1749
01:56:26.701 --> 01:56:30.660
bat.
The first is perhaps my favorite audio book of all time and it's the only

1750
01:56:30.661 --> 01:56:33.180
audiobook I've wanted to listen to twice in a row.

1751
01:56:33.630 --> 01:56:37.650
The graveyard book by Neil Gaiman.
It's amazing and you will thank me.

1752
01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:39.660
There are a few different versions.

1753
01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:42.750
I like the version that Neil narrates himself,

1754
01:56:43.170 --> 01:56:45.210
one of the most soothing voices of all time.

1755
01:56:45.570 --> 01:56:49.920
The second book is vagabonding by Rolf Potts,
p,
O,
t t,

1756
01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:53.670
s which had a huge impact on my life and formed the basis for a lot of what

1757
01:56:53.671 --> 01:56:55.860
would later become the four hour workweek,

1758
01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:00.810
so go to audible.com forward slash Tim and you can choose one of these two books

1759
01:57:01.050 --> 01:57:05.340
or any of many,
many other options that could be books,
magazines,

1760
01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:08.280
and much more.

1767
01:57:28.770 --> 01:57:31.380
This podcast is brought to you by four sigmatic.

1768
01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:35.580
I reached out to these Finnish folks,
young entrepreneurs,
very talented.

1769
01:57:35.581 --> 01:57:39.600
After a acrobat introduced me to one of their products,

1770
01:57:39.630 --> 01:57:40.920
which is mushroom coffee.

1771
01:57:40.921 --> 01:57:45.921
This specific one includes Chaga and lion's mane and it knocked my socks off.

1772
01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:50.130
I highly recommend if you try it,
you start with half a packet.

1773
01:57:50.131 --> 01:57:54.480
It's very strong and lights you up like a Christmas tree in the best way

1774
01:57:54.481 --> 01:57:55.314
possible.

1775
01:57:55.380 --> 01:57:59.640
People are always asking me what I use for cognitive enhancement and for right

1776
01:57:59.641 --> 01:58:04.350
now this is the answer.
I try to force this on all of my house guests.

1777
01:58:04.620 --> 01:58:05.670
It is a hell of a thing.

1778
01:58:05.671 --> 01:58:09.420
If I have employees or people come over who are working on projects with me,

1779
01:58:09.421 --> 01:58:13.290
I always try to feed it to them because I'm going to get the limitless effect

1780
01:58:13.950 --> 01:58:14.940
and get a lot more out of them.

1781
01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:20.010
The first time I mentioned this product and four sigmatic on the podcast,

1782
01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:22.200
their products sold out in less than a week,

1783
01:58:22.230 --> 01:58:24.390
so you may want to check them out soon.

1784
01:58:24.391 --> 01:58:27.690
If you're listening to this and the coffee tastes like coffee,

1785
01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:32.900
it takes just seconds to prepare with hot water and oddly enough only includes

1786
01:58:34.171 --> 01:58:35.580
40 milligrams of caffeine,

1787
01:58:35.581 --> 01:58:38.430
so it has less than half of what you'd get in a regular cup of coffee.

1788
01:58:39.060 --> 01:58:42.850
I don't get any jitters.
Acid reflux or stomach burn,
any of that.

1789
01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:45.190
It's very unusual and very,
very cool.

1790
01:58:45.610 --> 01:58:47.920
So if you don't like caffeine,

1791
01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:51.640
they also offer very strong but caffeine free mushroom elixirs,

1792
01:58:51.641 --> 01:58:55.510
which I will sometimes have in the evening.
I find Chaga specifically to be very,

1793
01:58:55.511 --> 01:58:57.010
very grounding and earthy.

1794
01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:01.870
So that is another option and I have a cupboard full of their products at the

1795
01:59:01.871 --> 01:59:05.200
moment,
which is right around the corner of my kitchen.
You can try something.

1796
01:59:05.201 --> 01:59:06.760
You could try sample pack,
which is great.

1797
01:59:06.761 --> 01:59:11.200
Also right now by going to foursigmatic.com forward slash Tim,

1801
01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:24.820
If you were in the experimental mindset,

1802
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:27.580
I do not think you'll be disappointed to try map.
