5
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.790
I love audiobooks and I've two to recommend right off the bat.

6
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.090
Number one is press my favorite audio book of all time,

7
00:00:34.091 --> 00:00:36.850
and that is the graveyard book by Neil Gaiman.

8
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.080
The only audiobook I've wanted to immediately listen to a second time.

9
00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:45.460
As soon as I finished,
it's amazing.
You will thank me.
The graveyard book.

10
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.220
The second is vagabonding by Rolf Potts,

11
00:00:48.221 --> 00:00:52.870
which had a huge impact on my life and formed the basis for a lot of what became

12
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:53.920
the four hour workweek.

19
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.920
This episode is brought to you by me undies.
If I'm not going commando,

20
00:01:26.921 --> 00:01:28.180
I'm in Mandy's.

21
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.260
I have been testing these underwear for three to four months now pretty much

22
00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:37.261
every day and in fact throughout bunch of my other underwear this morning and on

23
00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:42.400
the road in the house,
they are extremely comfortable.
They look good,
feel good.

24
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.450
They are made of micro model two times softer than cotton as scientifically

25
00:01:46.451 --> 00:01:50.200
tested using the [inaudible] method.
Sounds very fancy of course,

26
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.070
and I get a lot of compliments from ladies for these.
You don't get diaper butt,

27
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.990
you don't get the tired elastic band.

28
00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.970
They look great and they have underwear for both men and women.

29
00:02:00.971 --> 00:02:04.660
Check out [inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim and you can see everything that

30
00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:07.810
I've been wearing.
They're ridiculous.
The sublime,
everything in between,

31
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.670
including my favorite,

32
00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:13.930
which is called out and I would be remiss if I didn't mention their lounge
pants.

33
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.680
This is a new thing and I have been wearing their lounge pants when I record

34
00:02:17.681 --> 00:02:18.490
podcast.

35
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.760
I've been wearing them out and about when I'm walking the dog meeting people for

36
00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:25.630
coffee.
And they are extremely comfortable though.

37
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.580
They're made from the same material as the underwear,

38
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.530
but some of them like the blue ones,

39
00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:34.531
I have have pockets so you can walk about without seeming like you're off of

40
00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:38.380
your meds and completely crazy.
So that is awesome.

41
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.990
And if you're not happy with the first pair you try on,

42
00:02:40.991 --> 00:02:42.310
I assume that refers to the underwear,

43
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.130
they'll refund you completely and you can keep the pair you tried on for free.

44
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.360
But if you're that kind of person,

45
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.030
you should be ashamed because that's disgusting.
Uh,

46
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.930
[inaudible] dot com slash Tim,
check it out.

47
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.200
Hello Ladies and germs.
This is Tim Ferriss.

48
00:02:56.201 --> 00:02:58.480
And welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

49
00:02:58.481 --> 00:03:00.700
I've had a bit wine to drink and by a bit,

50
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.760
I mean two bottles with a friend of Pleiades by Sean Factory,

51
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:07.150
which I highly recommend.

52
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.310
This show is usually about deconstructing worldclass experts and this episode is

53
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:13.090
no exception,

54
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.090
although instead of a chess prodigy or a military strategist or an entertainment

55
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.780
icon,
we have perhaps the best storyteller.

56
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.470
And Pitch Man I've ever had on this show.
Uh,

57
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:31.471
certainly he would give cal Fussman a run for his money and he is none other

58
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:34.600
than Mike Rowe,

59
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.200
a micro you may know from dirty jobs,

60
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.050
but I'm going to read his bio except had enough to drink and this is on

61
00:03:42.051 --> 00:03:46.990
micro.com and having spent some time with Mike.
Now this is a,

62
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.050
this is very fitting.
Here we go.
I'm going to read the entire paragraphs.

63
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.883
So bear with me.

64
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.870
I in this episode I will say is so worth listening to and its entirety because

65
00:03:55.871 --> 00:04:00.250
we cover how to sell a pencil.
QVC,
the meaning of freelance,

66
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:05.140
the business and Mike Rowe,
his mentors.
We talk about some of his favorite,

67
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.520
uh,
influences and mentors.
We talk about favorite books,

68
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:12.610
we talk about the art of voiceover.

69
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:16.540
We talk about Bruno Mars and how he became Bruno Mars.

70
00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:19.510
We talked about Orson Welles.
It goes on and on and on.

71
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:23.320
I had a blast with this and just got back from spending some time after the

72
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:27.850
interview with Mike and I hope we have a part two and 0.3.

73
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.410
Oh Jesus.

74
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.340
I'm with somebody next to me and they're admiring my state of inebriation.

75
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:37.930
Here we go.
Micro from the web site is a TV host,
writer,

76
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:40.600
narrator,
producer,
actor,
and spokesman.

77
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.160
His performing career began in 1984 when he faked his way into the Baltimore

78
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:49.030
Opera to get his union card and meet girls.
And that is true,

79
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.070
both of which he accomplished during a performance of Rigoletto is transition to

80
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:57.880
television.
Occurred in the,
in 1990 when to settle a bet.

81
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.320
He auditioned for the QVC shopping channel and was promptly hired after talking

82
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:05.200
about a pencil for nearly eight minutes there.

83
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:09.730
He worked the graveyard shift for three years until he was ultimately fired for

84
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:12.580
making fun of products and be the little [inaudible] viewers.

85
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.270
So all of that is true and we dig into it and you should say hi to Mike on

86
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.980
either end or Twitter.

87
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.910
And I'm flipping through pages because I've had too much to drink at.
Uh,

88
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.470
Mike Rowe works.
That's Twitter at Mike Rowe works or on Facebook.

89
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.090
He's Burke.
Wow.
Just gets better and better.
Uh,

90
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.690
the real Mike Rowe,
uh,

91
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.410
this was a blast of a conversation that I've wanted to have for 15,

92
00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:48.190
20 years and I hope you enjoy it.
So say a little Mike.

93
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.570
And without further ado,

94
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.750
here is my conversation with the inimitable Mike Rowe.

95
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.710
Mike,
Welcome to the shelf.
I think you mean welcome to your living room.

96
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.540
Welcome to the esteem studio of Tim Ferriss enterprises.
I e.
My living room,

97
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:06.470
sophisticated,

98
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.960
understated with a certain insouciance in dare I say an Asian influence.

99
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.590
I,
that's actually my Tinder description,
not just

100
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.900
converting pretty well.

101
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.460
I have wanted to have the chance to sit down with you for many years and I

102
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:26.240
wanted to thank you right off the bat.

103
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:27.770
I'm not sure if I mentioned this when we met,

104
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:29.810
which we'll get to for the first time,

105
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.590
but you helped keep me sane for a period of several years when I had an

106
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:41.351
extremely punishing job from about 2000 to 2002 specifically.

107
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:44.360
That was,

108
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.070
that was when I was logging the most hours and I would come home and there were

109
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:52.220
two shows.
It was dirty jobs.
Uh,
so you,

110
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.150
and then Jeff Corwin who were like my,
my,
my tele therapists.

111
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.120
And so I just want to,
to thank you for putting out good work.
Well,

112
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:06.040
you're welcome.
I mean,
look,
when people say things could always be worse,
um,

113
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.970
it means whatever you decided means,

114
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:11.960
but then when you can actually turn on the TV and see some sort of optical

115
00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:16.040
manifestation of what worse is.
Well there you go.
You know,

116
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.120
reinforcement.
I remember,
I remember one episode in particular,

117
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.150
I remember several episodes of course,
but one came to mind.
I had seen you do,

118
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.020
do really,
really dirty stuff.

119
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.050
There was one where I think you were winterizing a boat and you or you just look

120
00:07:32.101 --> 00:07:36.920
so bored out of your mind.
And I just remember thinking exactly what you said.

121
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:40.880
I was like,
you know,
sitting in the fire exit,
violating code at this startup,

122
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.980
being unable to move,
sleeping under my desk.
Those are all hard things,

123
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:49.820
but at least I'm not doing that.
I'm not wrapping a boat.
Yeah.
That was,
um,

124
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.320
Manhattan beach,

125
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.250
oddly named since we were in Cincinnati on the river.

126
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.230
And it was,
I think,

127
00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:01.010
late November and all of the pleasure crafts down there,
you know,

128
00:08:01.011 --> 00:08:05.780
are obviously vulnerable and susceptible to the,
to the climate in a huge way.

129
00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:09.440
I mean,
they'll just crack.
It just gets so cold and a team.
