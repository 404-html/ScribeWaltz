00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.820
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:06.770
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.
No else.

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.633
You posted a question.

4
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.040
I'm a cybernetic organism living.

5
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.690
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by headspace.</v>

6
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.930
More than 80% of the people I've interviewed,

7
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.100
world class performers across the military,
entertainment,

8
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.960
sports and beyond all have some type of meditative practice.

9
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.140
I tried for years and years and failed miserably.

10
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.190
The key is making it simple and you can dramatically improve your life in just

11
00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:48.020
10 minutes a day and technology can help you.

12
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.520
This change comes through guided meditation and headspace is by far the most

13
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:56.870
popular app for this purpose.
More than 4 million users.

14
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.490
It's meditation made simple,

15
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.600
so what I recommend is that you take this practice meditation which is rooted in

16
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.830
thousands of years of tradition,

17
00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:08.831
supported by thousands of scientific studies and try it for 10 minutes a day for

18
00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:12.140
10 days.
That's all you need to do.

19
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:15.920

27
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.880
this episode is brought to you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor.

28
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.650
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive,
in a good way,
set it and forget it.

29
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:57.030
Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous

30
00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:57.750
investors.

31
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.500
It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than

32
00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:04.470
two and a half billion dollars under management.
In fact,

33
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.850
some of my very good friends,

34
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.060
investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront.

35
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.120
So the question is,
why?
Why is it so popular?
Why is it unique?

36
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.410
Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

37
00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:18.390
pay pennies on the dollar for them.

38
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.140
And this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations,

39
00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:24.870
bloated sales teams,
et cetera.
And I'll come back to that in a second.

40
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.030
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk

41
00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:30.781
assessment quiz,

42
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:34.680
which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for free exactly the

43
00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:37.620
portfolio they'd put you in.
And if you just want to take their advice,

44
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.010
run with it,
do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

45
00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:42.900
you can set it and forget it.
And here's why.

46
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.220
The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that

47
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:50.610
investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't.

48
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.310
Great investing is a marathon,
not a sprint,

49
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.650
and little things that you may or may not be familiar with.

50
00:02:55.651 --> 00:02:59.130
Like automatic tax loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

51
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.610
cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large

52
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:07.330
amounts of money over longer periods of time.
Wealthfront,
as I mentioned,

53
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:09.940
since it's using software instead of retail locations,

54
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:14.110
etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely

55
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:15.610
impossible right off the bat,

56
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.160
you never pay commissions or account fees for everything.

57
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:23.161
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for

58
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:25.840
free.
If you use my link,

59
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.190
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim that is less than $5 a month to invest a

60
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:32.620
$30,000 account for instance.
Now,

61
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:36.160
normally when I have a sponsor on this show is because I use them and recommend

62
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:37.810
them.
In this case it's a little different.

63
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.120
I don't use Wealthfront yet because I'm not allowed to.
Here's the deal.

64
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.380
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of sec regulations,

65
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.040
companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials,

66
00:03:50.041 --> 00:03:52.860
so I couldn't be a user end have them on the podcast,

67
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.970
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront that I've invested a significant

68
00:03:56.971 --> 00:04:00.810
amount of my own money,
at least for me in the team and the company itself.

69
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.960
So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client.

70
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.440
Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

71
00:04:07.441 --> 00:04:11.340
you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account,

72
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.340
but just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you.

73
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.540
Take two minutes,
fill out their questionnaire@wealthfront.com forward slash.
Tim,

74
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.660
it's fast,
it's free.
There's no downside that I can think of.

75
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.440
Greetings,
earthlings.

76
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.740
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

77
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:30.970
it is always,

78
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.750
or I should say usually my job to deconstruct world class performers,

79
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.250
to tease out the habits,
routines,
tools,
favorite practices,

80
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.750
workouts,
books,
whatever it might be that they use that you can test,

81
00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:45.550
that you can experiment with in your own life.

82
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.970
And this episode is going to be a round two highly anticipated with none other

83
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:53.500
than Jocko Willink.

84
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.860
And Jocko did his first interview with me,

85
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:03.910
which was the first interview we ever did and it took the Internet by storm

86
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.780
Jocko Willink.
Jocko Willink on Twitter.

87
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.590
Jocko podcast.com is one of the scariest human beings imaginable.

88
00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:14.500
Lean 230 pounds black belt Brazilian Jujitsu,

89
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.960
used to tap out 20 navy seals per workout.

90
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.900
He is an intimidating and very intelligent person.

91
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.460
I've spent more time with him,
uh,
and the more time that I spend with him,

92
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.320
the more impressive he is to me.

93
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:33.730
He spent 20 years in the US Navy and commanded seal team three is tasking at

94
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:36.970
bruiser of the most highly decorated special operations unit from the Iraq war.

95
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.080
Upon returning to the u s Jocko served as the officer in charge of training for

96
00:05:41.081 --> 00:05:43.120
all west coast seal teams,

97
00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:47.860
designing and implementing some of the most challenging and realistic and

98
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.260
perhaps psychotic combat training in the world.
His words,
not mine.

99
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.830
After retiring from the navy,
he cofounded echelon front.

100
00:05:56.831 --> 00:05:58.130
I think I'm getting the pronunciation right.

101
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.580
<v 2>Leadership and Management Consulting Company and authored the Number One New</v>

102
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.690
York Times best seller which was introduced in way on my podcast,

103
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.010
extreme ownership which many of you have read.
He now discusses war leadership,

104
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:12.620
business,
Jujitsu life,

105
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.880
you name it in his top rated podcast.
Also to some really,

106
00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:21.881
really good book reviews or commentary on things that are dark and some cases

107
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:24.770
like the my Lai massacre,
Jocko podcasts.

108
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:29.771
Check it out and without further ado we are going to tackle or I should say

109
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:33.530
Jocko is going to tackle your most common,

110
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.710
most burning questions and he doesn't dodge so I hope you enjoy it as much as I

111
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:44.420
did Jocko Willink.
A thanks Tim.

112
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.190
Thanks for having me on.

113
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:50.600
Appreciate it and thanks to everybody that submitted questions.

114
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.770
I'm going to try and get to as many as I can here.
All right.

115
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:59.771
The first one is from a guy by the name of Jeffrey McCloud and the question is

116
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.870
how do you shut internal doubt down and negative chatter out of your head during

117
00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:11.450
critical must do moments?

118
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.040
How do you change emotional negative focus states when something or someone

119
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.940
knocks you off?
Focus.
First of all,

120
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:29.590
internal doubt is not necessarily a bad thing.

121
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.870
And I've said this before about fear of failure because internal doubt that

122
00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:37.341
first of all,

123
00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:42.341
that's a form of humility and obviously humility is a good thing and that

124
00:07:43.371 --> 00:07:47.630
internal doubt and that fear of failure is the thing that the thing that keeps

125
00:07:47.631 --> 00:07:49.400
you up at night preparing,

126
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.480
that's the thing that's not going to let you cut corner.

127
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.890
It's the thing
is that little voice,

128
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.940
that little voice inside your head that's whispering,

129
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.910
rehearse again,
practice again,
do it again over and over again.

130
00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:12.830
And that's the voice that says to do everything you can

131
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.410
to be ready.
So I'm,

132
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.030
I'm okay with that.
I'm okay with that little internal doubt.

133
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.380
But this doesn't mean that you lack confidence.

134
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:32.540
I mean,
as a matter of fact,
when you,
when you prepare correctly,

135
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.230
when you have the discipline to prepare correctly,

136
00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:40.580
then you will have confidence and that is definitely a,

137
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:43.490
a good feeling to have because

138
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.270
all that negative chatter that you're talking about here,

139
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.400
here's the deal with that.
Every repetition of practice that you do,

140
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.880
every iteration of rehearsal that you complete,

141
00:08:56.881 --> 00:09:01.440
every bit of study that you do and every drill that you do,
all that,

142
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.390
all that preparation is going to drown out the,

143
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.440
the negative chatter.

144
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.850
So you got to prepare now,

145
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.860
then we get to this piece.

146
00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:18.861
Here it was how do you change emotional negative focus states when something or

147
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:21.780
someone knocks you off focus?
Well,

148
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:28.100
I think this is where it's important to have that ability to detach and

149
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.380
it isn't like you're going to completely detach and not feel those things at
all.

150
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.380
Not like you're gonna make those emotions disappear and it's not even like you'd

151
00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:40.110
want them to disappear completely because those things are normal.

152
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:45.590
But what you have to do when you detach is it's going to allow you to,

153
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:52.140
to see those emotions or that negative focus and see it from a distance and then

154
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:57.200
understand that they are there and then make sure that they don't overwhelm you.

155
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:06.180
And so like in your head you're going to be saying,
oh,
okay,

156
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:10.320
I see that.
That's,
that's some nervousness sneaking up on me.

157
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:11.400
Got It.

158
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.700
That's a good sign because that means my mind is focused and I'm in the game.

159
00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:18.990
Okay,
what's next?
Oh,
oh,
got some some negative thoughts.

160
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.510
Okay,
well those are normal and I got to know that things are going to go bad and

161
00:10:24.511 --> 00:10:28.200
that's fine.
How bad can they go?
What's a worst case scenario

162
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.280
and worst case scenario is not that big of a deal.

163
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:37.710
I know I can handle the worst case scenario if it happens.
So what else?

164
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:42.000
What else is in my mind?
What else negative thought am I having?

165
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.490
What about those things that you can't control?

166
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.810
The things that you can't control and you're worried about those things.
Well,

167
00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:53.190
you know what?
I can't control them though.
If I can't control them,

168
00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:55.350
why worry about them?

169
00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:00.800
Because the energy that you put into worrying about them actually cost you your

170
00:11:02.491 --> 00:11:03.360
effectiveness.

171
00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.860
It's going to cut into the energy you should be putting towards achieving what

172
00:11:07.861 --> 00:11:09.000
you're trying to achieve.

173
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:14.930
So focus on the things that you can control and make the things that you can

174
00:11:15.211 --> 00:11:19.890
control 100% and the bottom line with all of this,

175
00:11:19.891 --> 00:11:23.670
with these negative thoughts.
If,
if I give everything I can,

176
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.910
if I prepare as hard as I can,
if I practice as much as I can.

177
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:31.620
If I do have a rehearsal and I do everything I can and I still come up short,

178
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:38.190
good,
I'm going to learn from it.
I'm going to get better.

179
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.340
So that's what I'm going to do with internal doubt.

180
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.440
I'm okay with it.
Negative chatter,

181
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:50.970
I'm going to utilize it and I'm just going to detach a little bit

182
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.980
to make sure I don't get drowned out in these emotional situations.

183
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.750
So just get your head in the game and get after it

184
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.280
done.
Okay,
next question.

185
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.550
Next question comes from we'll,

186
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.700
we'll again drawn

187
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.350
and he says,

188
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.100
how does his love of

189
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.740
love and study of literature influences leadership skills?

190
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.010
What were some of the best books for developing his knowledge of leadership?

191
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:31.683
Okay,

192
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:36.040
so the thing that I look for when I'm reading and when I'm reading that includes

193
00:12:36.041 --> 00:12:39.730
everything and let's just talk about everything here.
Books,
history,
books,

194
00:12:39.731 --> 00:12:44.020
literature,
even poetry and even like song lyrics,
everything.

195
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.900
I'm trying to learn about human nature.
That's what I'm looking for.

196
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:55.590
[inaudible] and of course since since combat is like life amplitude amplified

197
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.930
and intensified,
which is something we say all the time,

198
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:07.330
a lot of times the books that are about war give some of the best insight into

199
00:13:07.331 --> 00:13:09.640
human nature.
You know,

200
00:13:09.641 --> 00:13:14.641
you're talking about the stress and the fear and the courage and the breaking

201
00:13:14.951 --> 00:13:19.951
points and the darkness of humanity

202
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:24.723
and also

203
00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:31.290
the beauty of humanity and all those can be seen in their most extreme and in

204
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.850
their most obvious form in war.

205
00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:43.290
And so a lot of books that I do read are about war and I have a ton of them.

206
00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.700
And again,
they're not so much leadership books by definition,
as matter of fact,

207
00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:53.170
I don't even know if I have any quote unquote leadership books,

208
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.210
but I got a ton of books that have taught me a ton about leadership.

209
00:13:58.210 --> 00:13:59.320
And first and foremost,

210
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:04.870
and I said this on when I was on Tim's podcast for the first time about face by

211
00:14:04.871 --> 00:14:06.940
Colonel David Hackworth.
It's,

212
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:11.380
it's the only book of I've ever actually given to anyone.

213
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.390
And it's a big book that people,
people that have bought it,

214
00:14:16.391 --> 00:14:19.570
people on Twitter that have gone out and bought that book.
It's a 700 page book.

215
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.800
It is a big book.

216
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:25.810
It spans from the tail end of World War II through Korea,
Vietnam,

217
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.650
and a little bit of post Vietnam.
And it's a big book.

218
00:14:29.651 --> 00:14:31.540
It's a career military guy.

219
00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:36.750
And Colonel Hackworth was just,
just a,

220
00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:37.840
just an incredible leader.

221
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.900
And you don't just get from the that from the book when you,

222
00:14:40.901 --> 00:14:43.390
when you learned about Hackworth,
if you start digging in and,

223
00:14:43.391 --> 00:14:47.080
and hearing what other people's opinions are,
people loved him,

224
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.380
especially the people that worked for him,
loved him.

225
00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:54.080
Now obviously had some trouble up the chain of command at certain points.

226
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.930
But that's,
that's part of being that,

227
00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.810
that's part of being a dynamic leader I guess.

228
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.420
And he held his ground on some stuff.

229
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:08.230
So that book is just incredible book and it's got lessons learned on every page.

230
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.570
And you know,

231
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.550
I covered most of the books that I've read that have had a huge impact on me.

232
00:15:16.551 --> 00:15:20.630
I'm like,
I'm covering them on my podcast.
So books like,

233
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:26.710
like a with the old breed by Eugene sled sledge and beyond band of brothers by

234
00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:29.720
Dick Winters.

235
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:35.150
I remember the last war by a guy named Bob Hoffman,

236
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.350
another book by Hackworth called steal my soldier's heart

237
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:45.970
book called platoon leader by Jim Mcdonough and another good one,

238
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:53.810
another good Vietnam one,
the killing zone by Frederick downs in

239
00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.850
those books.
I mean you could just go on and on and again,

240
00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.210
it's not always clear that,
oh,
here's the leadership principle,

241
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.560
here's what you should be doing.
No,
it's not always clear like that.
But when you,

242
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.400
when you understand what people are going through emotionally and you start to

243
00:16:10.401 --> 00:16:14.570
get a glimpse at human nature and how people react in certain situations and how

244
00:16:14.571 --> 00:16:15.470
their egos flare up,

245
00:16:15.471 --> 00:16:19.550
that's what makes these books good because it gives you something to,

246
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:25.090
as it gives you a frame of reference and I'm still reading all the time and I'm

247
00:16:25.371 --> 00:16:26.151
still learning,

248
00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:31.130
still trying to get better and still trying to take what other people been

249
00:16:31.131 --> 00:16:35.360
through,
how they handled it,
what they did right,

250
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:38.000
what they did wrong,
mistakes they made.
That's what I'm trying to do.

251
00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:42.490
And actually I think that's actually one of the things that has made my,

252
00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.040
my podcast become popular is because I look at these other people's experiences

253
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:50.410
and I compare him with mine and it's just,
it's,

254
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.560
it's always,
I'm always learning.
And I think that when you look at,

255
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:58.040
I talk about the mistakes that I made and even even the book that I wrote with

256
00:16:58.041 --> 00:17:03.041
leaf is it certainly isn't any kind of a chronicling of our triumphs.

257
00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.210
I mean if anything it's the opposite in many cases.

258
00:17:08.211 --> 00:17:12.860
Cause all much of the book is,
is about mistakes that we made.

259
00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.430
And it's about things that we could've done better and lessons that we've

260
00:17:15.431 --> 00:17:16.264
learned.

261
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.570
And I think that's why I think that's why it's why that book extreme ownership

262
00:17:20.571 --> 00:17:25.210
has done well because it's something you can learn from.
And,

263
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.520
and I think people learn the most,

264
00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:31.610
myself included when you fail.
So

265
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:38.030
read and read and read some more and pay attention to,

266
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:43.040
in my mind,
paypal,
pay attention to the details.
Not Again,

267
00:17:43.041 --> 00:17:47.990
not just the leadership,
but the human,
the human element,
the human interaction,

268
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:53.470
the glimpses into the core of human nature in a bigger bank you build of

269
00:17:59.701 --> 00:18:03.960
experiencing how humans react the more you know.

270
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:09.090
And then you take that and you overlay the experiences you read about over

271
00:18:09.091 --> 00:18:10.840
what's happening in your world.
And that's it.

272
00:18:10.841 --> 00:18:14.940
I think a key point is to actually think about how what you're reading applies

273
00:18:14.941 --> 00:18:16.200
to what's happening in your world.

274
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:21.570
And then you start to pay attention to human nature and your world and see that

275
00:18:21.571 --> 00:18:23.820
there's some underlying,

276
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.770
some underlying force that makes people do what they do.

277
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:31.290
And the better you can understand that force of human nature,

278
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.030
the better off you're going to be and the better job you're going to do as a

279
00:18:36.031 --> 00:18:38.880
leader
to keep reading.

280
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:42.563
Next up,

281
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:48.050
I got a guy here named Kip Maca Nuni.

282
00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:56.640
What would his advice be to young men and women who are no longer in the

283
00:18:56.641 --> 00:19:00.690
military but are still looking to contribute?
Also,

284
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.440
has he considered running for any public office position?

285
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.810
So if,
if you were in the military and you got out,

286
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.290
either you retired or you just did your time and you got out,

287
00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:19.860
you know,
go out and put those skills that you got from the military.

288
00:19:19.861 --> 00:19:24.030
Put those skills to work with uh,
the discipline,
the work ethic,

289
00:19:24.031 --> 00:19:27.990
the leadership,
the ability to attach,

290
00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.950
to detach,
the ability to,
to instruct.

291
00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.010
And there are industries,
I'm telling you,

292
00:19:35.011 --> 00:19:38.880
I work with businesses all the time now and there are industries that need you.

293
00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:43.830
In fact,
I will tell you that most industries need people like you,

294
00:19:43.831 --> 00:19:47.400
people like veterans.
And so find an industry that,

295
00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.710
that you're interested in and,

296
00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.190
and go get busy and go get after it.

297
00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:57.270
And make that your next mission.
And

298
00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:03.930
if there's no industries that industry interests you,

299
00:20:03.931 --> 00:20:06.420
which is kind of hard to believe that you would have no interest.

300
00:20:06.421 --> 00:20:07.350
But if you don't,

301
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:11.370
or if you're looking for something maybe that has more kind of internal meaning,

302
00:20:11.371 --> 00:20:15.300
then go out and find a really good nonprofit organization that needs help

303
00:20:15.301 --> 00:20:18.540
because again,
they need the same thing.
They need people,
they need leaders,

304
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.210
they need people that are disciplined,
they need people that can solve problems,

305
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.340
they need people with the skills that you have,

306
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.760
the skills that you learned in the military.
So go and put those to work.

307
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:32.250
And I will tell you that
there's,
you know,

308
00:20:32.251 --> 00:20:34.770
America as a whole needs leadership.

309
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:39.990
And so there's no reason that veterans,
like I said,
who,

310
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:45.080
who have a lot of those skills from being in the military and from being

311
00:20:45.151 --> 00:20:46.110
deployed overseas,

312
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.310
there's no reason that veteran shouldn't make up a big portion of leaders in the

313
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:55.510
civilian sector.
So step up and get after.

314
00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:58.360
And I'll say one last thing about that is there's a lot of companies,

315
00:20:58.361 --> 00:21:00.790
and I work again,
I work with all kinds of different companies.

316
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.770
All kinds of companies want to hire veterans.
They,

317
00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:07.600
they recognize that their success is based on the freedoms that they have.

318
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:13.510
So they want to pay back somehow.
And so there's many,
many companies are,

319
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:17.350
are anxious and eager to,
to hire veterans.

320
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.490
So get out there,
find what you're interested in and make it happen.

321
00:21:21.491 --> 00:21:23.560
Now the other part of this question,

322
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:29.500
as far as running for political office,
and I say this all the time,

323
00:21:29.501 --> 00:21:33.880
this is kind of a canned answer.
I don't think I have the stomach for it.
Um,

324
00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.253
the,

325
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:39.760
the corruption and the slimy penis of the whole thing.

326
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:45.480
Not to mention just the complete loss of privacy and the scheduling and the

327
00:21:46.211 --> 00:21:50.290
whole meeting of people that I don't like and having to be civil to them all

328
00:21:50.291 --> 00:21:55.210
thing.
It's,
it's,
like I said,

329
00:21:55.420 --> 00:22:00.160
I don't,
I don't think I have the stomach for it.
And I mean,

330
00:22:00.161 --> 00:22:01.990
I guess that

331
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.760
perhaps at some point that feeling could be overridden if things got bad enough.

332
00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:13.751
You know,

333
00:22:13.751 --> 00:22:18.751
I would definitely have a sense of duty in and I'm a very patriotic person and

334
00:22:19.271 --> 00:22:22.690
if the nation truly needed me,

335
00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.540
then of course I would serve.

336
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:33.360
But until that time I'm going to go ahead and just steer clear of any political

337
00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.880
endeavors.
Okay.

338
00:22:36.881 --> 00:22:41.710
The next question is from Adrian Marquez and it says any considerations

339
00:22:41.711 --> 00:22:43.960
regarding being a pawn of the,

340
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:49.080
and he says industrial military conflicts and maybe he means military industrial

341
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:53.880
complex.
I'm not sure,
but we'll,
we'll go with it.
Um,

342
00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:57.551
so again,

343
00:22:57.551 --> 00:23:02.050
any considerations regarding being a pawn of the industrial military conflicts

344
00:23:02.051 --> 00:23:05.380
to serve the economic interests of US corporations?

345
00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:10.240
Would he do it all over again?
The next part of the question is what's next?

346
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:14.470
Make up another excuse.
Invade an African nation for resources.

347
00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:17.883
So

348
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:24.160
of course when you are serving in the u s military,
you are,

349
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:25.210
you are serving,

350
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.850
at least you should be serving the interests of the United States of America.

351
00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.960
Absolutely.
And embedded in those interests.

352
00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:40.530
There are absolutely the economic interests of American corporations and

353
00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:48.360
obviously the economic power of the United States is a key component of

354
00:23:51.501 --> 00:23:55.430
America's power.
And influence in the world.

355
00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.000
And so yeah,

356
00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:04.090
when you are a military member you could be considered a pawn in the military

357
00:24:05.451 --> 00:24:06.284
machine.

358
00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.970
But the fact of the matter is I am,

359
00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:17.380
I'm actually honored to have served as a so called pawn a pawn in that system.

360
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.900
And I will tell you this,
and I've said this before,

361
00:24:23.901 --> 00:24:25.400
America is,

362
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:31.570
is far from perfect and we have committed some horrors in our history and even

363
00:24:32.931 --> 00:24:35.660
today we make mistakes in the world.

364
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:42.110
But when you travel the world

365
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:49.580
and you see how much of the rest of the world lives,

366
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:54.440
how much they live in
disarray,

367
00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:59.420
then you see the oppression and you see the poverty and you see the corruption

368
00:24:59.421 --> 00:25:04.421
and you see the abject violations of basic human rights.

369
00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:14.650
Then you realize how blessed or lucky or or maybe even spoiled,

370
00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:23.490
we are to live in America and,

371
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.480
and just to start,
let's just start with,

372
00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:32.060
let's start with potable tap water drinking water that we just in America,

373
00:25:32.541 --> 00:25:37.400
we just have that here.
We haven't everywhere any home,
any apartment,

374
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.080
even the prisons.

375
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:44.110
You turn on the tap and you get good clean disease,

376
00:25:44.561 --> 00:25:49.400
free drinking water,
and that is not the norm in the rest of the world.

377
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:51.410
And on top of that,
we have power,

378
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:54.770
got electricity going into just about every home.

379
00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.360
That means just about every home has heat in the wintertime and they have air

380
00:25:59.361 --> 00:26:00.830
conditioning in the summertime.

381
00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:05.000
And let's just take it a little bit further than what about the access to the

382
00:26:05.001 --> 00:26:09.560
Internet.
The access to the Internet here is widespread.

383
00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:14.580
There's something like 70% of the adults in America have a smartphone,

384
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:20.770
70% so 70% so you can gain access to knowledge here unlike any other time in

385
00:26:26.721 --> 00:26:27.554
human history

386
00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:31.730
and our our health care system.

387
00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.080
I know it's not perfect,
but I'll tell you what.

388
00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:41.560
If you view our healthcare system from a third world hospital,

389
00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.530
which often don't even have the simplest of medical gear,

390
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.970
you'd realize it might not be perfect,
but it's pretty damn good.

391
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:56.190
And then beyond that,
it's just like,

392
00:26:56.191 --> 00:26:58.470
let's look at the food that's available,

393
00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:02.040
nevermind starvation and malnutrition.

394
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.850
Our issue in America is actually too much food

395
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.080
and much of the world still has people literally starving to death.

396
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.480
And America offers an amazing opportunity to build and to create and to be what

397
00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:26.070
you want to be and to be who you want to be on.

398
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.800
Unlike anywhere else in the world,

399
00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:32.250
the ability to pursue happiness,

400
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:39.750
happiness
and,

401
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:42.660
and all those things,
all of it

402
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:49.190
is possible because of the unbridled individual freedom that America offers.

403
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.770
And you know what else?
It's also possible because of the industry,

404
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:04.700
because of the incredible corporations and businesses and individuals cause of

405
00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:10.851
people that took advantage of that freedom and work their asses off to build

406
00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:16.560
this nation.
So

407
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:22.050
to have been a pawn in that,

408
00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:26.430
to have done my small share of work,

409
00:28:26.431 --> 00:28:31.431
to allow this beacon of light and of hope and have freedom to continue.

410
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:42.630
I'm honored that I had the chance.
And would I do it all again?

411
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.220
You're damn right.
I would without question.

412
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:57.110
And then there's another piece to this question from Mr. Marquez.

413
00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.690
It says,
what's next?

414
00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.560
Make up another excuse.

415
00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:08.490
Invade an African country or an African nation for resources.

416
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.961
Well,

417
00:29:09.961 --> 00:29:14.961
luckily we have plenty of resources in our own nation and luckily for the rest

418
00:29:16.471 --> 00:29:21.471
of the world we have used those resources over and over and over again.

419
00:29:21.541 --> 00:29:25.380
Not to take,
but to give,

420
00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:30.510
to give freedom to the slaves in our own country,

421
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:36.140
to defeat and destroy the brutal Nazi regime in Germany and free the people of

422
00:29:37.381 --> 00:29:38.670
France and much of Europe.

423
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.840
We used our resources to defeat imperial Japan,

424
00:29:43.841 --> 00:29:48.841
who is rampaging through Asia invading and enslaving people with no sign of

425
00:29:48.941 --> 00:29:49.774
stopping.

426
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:57.070
We used our resources,
try and stop the spread of communism in Asia

427
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.400
and remember that when I'm talking about resources,

428
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.080
I'm not just talking about oil and steel and wood,

429
00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:11.860
I'm talking about blood.

430
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:18.870
I'm talking about hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of American

431
00:30:19.061 --> 00:30:23.260
men and women that gave their lives

432
00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:26.860
in the cause of freedom.

433
00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:31.910
And in w what?

434
00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:36.670
What resources did we take when we paid with our blood,

435
00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:43.330
we took nothing.
We took,

436
00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.310
we took no resources from the Germans.

437
00:30:45.311 --> 00:30:48.310
We helped them rebuild into an economic superpower.

438
00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.580
We took no resources from the Japanese.

439
00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:55.090
We help them rebuild into an economic superpower.

440
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.890
The Japanese and the Germans both have some of the highest standards of living

441
00:30:59.891 --> 00:31:00.880
in the world.

442
00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:08.760
We took nothing from Korea or Vietnam and we took nothing from Afghanistan and

443
00:31:09.341 --> 00:31:13.510
even Iraq,
we took nothing

444
00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:20.620
and we only gave,
and we continue to give.

445
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:26.760
In 2014 the u s government gave $43 billion in foreign aid,

446
00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:36.210
and then there was another 25 billion on top of that from America,

447
00:31:36.611 --> 00:31:41.200
from religious organizations and universities and colleges and private voluntary

448
00:31:41.201 --> 00:31:45.940
organizations,
and even the big American corporations.

449
00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:54.250
Now,
like I said,
that doesn't mean that America's perfect

450
00:31:56.770 --> 00:32:00.430
far from it,
far from it,

451
00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.650
and our past is checkered

452
00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:06.970
with horrible mistakes that we've made as a nation.

453
00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:13.440
We've caused massive hardships and incredible suffering,

454
00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:20.470
but we also evolved
and

455
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:26.860
we have become a benevolent nation of good nation.

456
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:32.020
And I know this because I saw it with my own two eyes.

457
00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:39.040
I saw the people of Iraq who wanted freedom,

458
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.390
the tyranny of Saddam Hussein,

459
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:44.390
who then wanted protection from the violent terrorists,

460
00:32:44.391 --> 00:32:49.370
extremists who cheered us in the streets when we killed and surgeons and who

461
00:32:49.371 --> 00:32:50.870
wept when we left them.

462
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:59.230
And unfortunately who were murdered when we abandoned them because the politics

463
00:33:01.311 --> 00:33:05.570
in our own country,
they wanted us in Iraq,
the people of Iraq,

464
00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.980
the normal citizens,

465
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:10.940
they wanted our protection and they wanted our positivity

466
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:15.260
and they wanted freedom

467
00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:19.610
like much of the world does.

468
00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:27.080
And I was honored to have done my small part

469
00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:34.510
to provide the opportunity for freedom around the world and to protect that

470
00:33:36.621 --> 00:33:39.830
precious freedom,
which is

471
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:46.070
all too often taken for granted
here at home.

472
00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:57.800
Now
the next question,

473
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.380
the next question is from someone named Don Ryan

474
00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:07.453
and he says,

475
00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:12.460
what's the hardest thing you've ever gone through and what do you foresee as the

476
00:34:12.801 --> 00:34:15.560
toughest thing on the Horizon Elan door?

477
00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:23.563
Well,

478
00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:27.770
the hardest thing I've ever gone through is losing my men in combat.

479
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:35.270
And I say my men,

480
00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:39.410
but they weren't my men.

481
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.760
They were my friends and they were my brothers.

482
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:49.760
And barring the loss of

483
00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.080
many members of my direct family,

484
00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:58.070
I don't think I'll ever have to endure anything is

485
00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.350
soul crushing and devastating

486
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:08.270
as losing my friends and combat.

487
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.810
Next question.

488
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:25.760
This is from Nathan low.

489
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:34.390
What advice would you give an active duty navy seal or other military personnel

490
00:35:35.151 --> 00:35:39.750
following the election if Hillary is elected or if Trump is elected?

491
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:46.170
Well,
the fact of the matter is either Hillary or Trump will be elected

492
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.110
and the seals

493
00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:55.380
just like the rest of the military will do what the military always does and

494
00:35:55.381 --> 00:35:59.130
what they are sworn to do.
And if you don't know what that is,

495
00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.730
I wrote down here the oath of enlistment and I'll read it to you.

496
00:36:02.731 --> 00:36:05.040
So you know what it's what it says.
It says,

497
00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:09.420
I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the constitution of the

498
00:36:09.421 --> 00:36:13.170
United States against all enemies,
foreign and domestic,

499
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:17.700
that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same and that I will obey the

500
00:36:17.701 --> 00:36:20.880
orders of the president of the United States and the orders of the officers

501
00:36:20.881 --> 00:36:25.560
appointed over me according to the regulations and the uniform code of military

502
00:36:25.561 --> 00:36:27.750
justice.
So help me God.

503
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:31.703
So that's the,

504
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:37.250
that's the oath that you swear to when you join the military,

505
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.230
you're going to obey those orders.

506
00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:45.231
Now there is a little bit of a caveat and that is in the uniform code of

507
00:36:45.241 --> 00:36:50.241
Military Justice Article 92 cause it gets a little bit more specific.

508
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:55.260
The articles entitled failure to obey order or regulation,

509
00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:01.340
any person subject to this chapter who number one violates or fails to obey any

510
00:37:02.551 --> 00:37:04.980
lawful general order or regulation

511
00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:12.020
to having knowledge of any other lawful order issued by any member of the armed

512
00:37:12.571 --> 00:37:13.830
forces,
which it is.

513
00:37:13.831 --> 00:37:18.831
His duty to obey fails to obey the order or is derelict and the performance of

514
00:37:19.111 --> 00:37:22.860
his duties shall be punished as court martial may direct.

515
00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:28.010
So the keyword there is lawful order and they made this perfectly clear during

516
00:37:30.961 --> 00:37:35.961
the Nuremberg trials when the Nazi war criminals claim that they were just

517
00:37:36.001 --> 00:37:40.230
following orders.
Well in America that doesn't cut it.

518
00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.530
They have to be lawful orders.

519
00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:50.460
So regardless if Hillary Clinton,
Donald Trump,
Obama,

520
00:37:50.461 --> 00:37:55.020
Bush,
Nixon,
JFK or Reagan,
it doesn't matter.

521
00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.450
The military will carry out the lawful orders of the president.
And that's that

522
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:08.670
next question is from a j Nystrom.

523
00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:12.210
He says,
Jocko,

524
00:38:12.211 --> 00:38:16.680
in your book you speak about leadership down and up the chain of command.

525
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:21.900
What in your opinion and experiences the most effective way to get leadership up

526
00:38:21.901 --> 00:38:24.990
the chain to wake up and break the cycle of rubber stamping ineffective

527
00:38:24.991 --> 00:38:27.210
practices,
especially in law enforcement.

528
00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:35.320
So this is a big question and I'll tell you first things first.

529
00:38:35.321 --> 00:38:39.370
The first thing you have to do is be awesome.
That's what you gotta do.
Seriously,

530
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.090
you got to be the best police officer you can be.

531
00:38:43.091 --> 00:38:46.930
And this goes for any job you got to build the best possible reputation.

532
00:38:46.931 --> 00:38:48.760
And that means you gotta follow the rules,

533
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:53.230
even the stupid inconsequential rules,

534
00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:58.600
all of them become the front runner,

535
00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:00.130
the top dog.

536
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:03.190
Now that doesn't mean you become the loud mouth or the attention grabber,

537
00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:08.710
but you become the best legit police officer you can possibly be.

538
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.460
And not only is this going to build your reputation,

539
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:16.990
it's also going to start to build your relationships up the chain of command.

540
00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:18.190
And that's what you're trying to do.

541
00:39:18.191 --> 00:39:20.020
You're trying to build some relationships here.

542
00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:25.350
And the reason for that is you need to build up the capital,

543
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.510
the leadership capital,

544
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:34.200
the respect capital so that you can ask some legitimate questions.

545
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:39.640
And when the time comes you go and you ask those questions.
No,

546
00:39:39.641 --> 00:39:40.660
actually I,

547
00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:46.010
I shouldn't say ask questions because that gives them a setup to provide you

548
00:39:46.331 --> 00:39:48.940
with the answers and you already know the answers and you don't agree with them.

549
00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:51.130
So instead of asking questions,

550
00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:55.510
you take the reputation that you built is a bad ass and you raise points.

551
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:56.530
And when you raise points,

552
00:39:56.531 --> 00:40:01.531
you have solutions and you have solutions that you've already socialized with

553
00:40:03.641 --> 00:40:08.380
the team that you've already maybe even tested or you've at least tried.

554
00:40:08.381 --> 00:40:10.900
In other words,
these are solutions that you know are going to work

555
00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:15.850
and also pick your battles.

556
00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:20.640
Pick your battles.
You got to,
you're going to have to eat some,

557
00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.910
some stupid stuff.
You're going to do some lame things,

558
00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.830
but you got to pick your battles.

559
00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:28.630
You're not going to be able to change everything.

560
00:40:28.631 --> 00:40:32.050
So you got to pick the most impactful issues to deal with.

561
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:36.370
And the other one's just,
you support those.

562
00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.680
And you follow those like a good soldier

563
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:45.300
because that gives you more capital when you do raise issues and,

564
00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:49.750
and here's the other piece.
When you raise issues up the chain of command,

565
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:52.240
and this is a piece that people mess this up all the time.

566
00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:56.710
When you raised these points up the chain of command and when you give the

567
00:40:56.711 --> 00:40:57.610
solutions,

568
00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:02.860
you have to do it from a point of humility.

569
00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:08.000
You can't be looking for the credit.
You can't be looking for the Atta boy.

570
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:11.320
You got to come across and you've got it not just come across.

571
00:41:11.321 --> 00:41:16.321
You've got to actually be the humble person putting forth some suggestions on

572
00:41:18.701 --> 00:41:22.270
how to do things better.
Anti that the,

573
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:27.430
the absolute black belt move is when you get them to think that it's their idea

574
00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:36.200
and that came up with it and that Dave made up that solution.

575
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:40.970
That's the ultimate black belt move.
That's

576
00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.160
what you're looking to achieve and that is how you win.

577
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:49.280
And that is what I did with my career.
I worked as hard as I could.

578
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:52.520
I followed everything they told me,
but when something stood out,

579
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:55.130
I was able to attack it,
address it,

580
00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:59.180
and get the problem solved or changed because I had built up that capital.

581
00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.540
So build your reputation,
build the relationships,

582
00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:05.600
build and vet your idea and your solution,

583
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:09.020
and then present it with humility.

584
00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:18.460
Next question is from a guy named Jonathan Mural,

585
00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:27.560
how would his lifestyle of extreme discipline translate to someone living a

586
00:42:27.561 --> 00:42:32.120
seemingly unrelated life,
artists,
writers,
et Cetera,

587
00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:36.980
who might find more productivity in pockets of leisure or late at night?

588
00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.073
Now,

589
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:43.760
I would argue that in these creative pursuits,

590
00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:46.940
you actually require even more discipline,

591
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:52.850
and I would venture to guess that the biggest reason that creative types people

592
00:42:52.851 --> 00:42:54.900
in creative industries,
they were,

593
00:42:54.901 --> 00:42:58.670
the reason that they don't produce isn't because they don't have vision and it's

594
00:42:58.671 --> 00:43:00.110
not because they don't have talent.

595
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:05.770
I can just about guarantee that in most cases it's a lack of discipline.

596
00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:12.200
I,
I'm always saying about about working out.
I'm always saying that the,

597
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:14.960
the weights in the gym aren't going to lift themselves.

598
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:18.350
You've got to go lift them.
Well,

599
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.450
it's the same thing with a book.

600
00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:26.540
That book isn't going to write itself.
You got to write it in.

601
00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.390
The painting isn't going to paint itself.
You got to paint it,

602
00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:34.370
and if you don't feel like writing or drawing or painting or composing,

603
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:39.920
that doesn't matter.
You do it anyways.

604
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:45.710
You grit down and you forced the words on to the paper or you force the brush

605
00:43:47.481 --> 00:43:52.481
onto the paper or you force the notes out of the instrument.

606
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:57.680
That's what you have to do.
You have to make it happen.

607
00:43:57.890 --> 00:43:59.630
You have to force yourself to do it

608
00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:04.520
and it's not always going to be good and you might go back,

609
00:44:04.521 --> 00:44:09.521
you might write a thousand words and you might delete 950 of them,

610
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:16.520
but you got 50 words,
50 words that you didn't have before,

611
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:19.310
50 words that you've created that are solid,

612
00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.820
50 words closer to reaching your goal.

613
00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:29.870
Now,
as far as the time of day goes,
to me,

614
00:44:29.871 --> 00:44:31.140
it doesn't matter if,

615
00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:34.770
if you have some kind of time of day where things seem to flow better or

616
00:44:34.771 --> 00:44:37.470
whatever,
great.
Take advantage of it.
I think.

617
00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.380
I think people think because I wake up early,

618
00:44:40.381 --> 00:44:44.100
which I do that I believe that everyone must do that.

619
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:50.040
But honestly it's,
it's,
that's not true.
It's,
it's the principle.

620
00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:54.480
It's,
it's about the principle,
not about the specific time.

621
00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:00.150
And I've got to throw a big butt on that

622
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.630
because although you can,

623
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:06.780
you can maybe work at different times or maybe you stay up later or maybe do

624
00:45:06.781 --> 00:45:09.600
better work at two o'clock in the morning or three o'clock in the morning.

625
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:12.420
And so there's no way you're getting up at four 30 that's okay.

626
00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:17.730
But that doesn't mean oversleep.

627
00:45:17.731 --> 00:45:20.760
And it doesn't mean procrastinated.
It doesn't mean hit the snooze button.

628
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:22.710
And it doesn't mean staying up late,

629
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:27.740
diving into the depths of useless youtube videos and claim that that is you

630
00:45:28.741 --> 00:45:33.180
being creative.
Do not lie to yourself.

631
00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:38.650
There's a decent chance that being creative is actually being lazy in your mind.

632
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:45.600
Do not,
do not fall into that.

633
00:45:45.601 --> 00:45:48.870
Trap me and I'll tell you something else.

634
00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:53.370
In order to gain skills,

635
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:58.320
in order to master your craft,
any craft you have to practice,

636
00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:01.320
you have to practice and practice and practice.

637
00:46:01.321 --> 00:46:05.100
Over and over and over again and again.
And that requires discipline,

638
00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:08.430
that requires discipline.

639
00:46:08.431 --> 00:46:11.370
And that is another example of how discipline will equal freedom.

640
00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:16.830
The more you practice your craft,
the better you get at it,

641
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:19.500
the more freedom you have to create.

642
00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:25.170
So build the structure and follow.

643
00:46:25.171 --> 00:46:28.860
It's put the discipline into your life

644
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:31.320
and the discipline.

645
00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:35.220
It will increase your skills and it will increase your productivity

646
00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:41.460
and the discipline will,
it'll set you free.

647
00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:48.960
Now going on to the next question here.

648
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:53.340
Will the muster event,
oh,
sorry,

649
00:46:53.341 --> 00:46:56.850
this is from Marco Lopez,
Mario Lopez.

650
00:46:57.090 --> 00:46:59.700
Will the muster event be a once a year thing?

651
00:46:59.701 --> 00:47:03.360
Only after working with and training so many different companies,

652
00:47:03.361 --> 00:47:07.350
are there any repeating patterns or common weaknesses that business owners seem

653
00:47:07.351 --> 00:47:11.880
to need to work on?
And it also says,

654
00:47:11.881 --> 00:47:15.240
will you please encourage Jocko to do nother Joe Rogan podcast?

655
00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:20.580
So right on,
Joe.
Joe knows I'm standing by,
we'll,

656
00:47:20.581 --> 00:47:23.850
we'll make it happen at some point.
Yeah,
great to be on his show.

657
00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:29.170
We're just,
we're just now getting around around two,
two with,
with Tim.

658
00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:32.620
So maybe Joe's around the corner.
So we'll,

659
00:47:32.621 --> 00:47:36.190
we'll have to wait and see on that one.
All right.
To get to the question here,

660
00:47:36.191 --> 00:47:39.760
for those of you don't know the extreme ownership muster as a leadership event

661
00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:43.810
that we're having in in San Diego,
California,
I'm doing it with,

662
00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:47.590
with my business partner,
the coauthor of the book,
extreme ownership,
Leif Babin,

663
00:47:47.591 --> 00:47:49.750
who's,
uh,
a seal that

664
00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:54.400
I worked with for many years and my brother,

665
00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:59.110
and we're holding this thing in San Diego,
California on October 20th and 21st.

666
00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:03.280
And what the event is,
it's going to be about combat leadership.

667
00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:04.690
That's what it's going to be about.

668
00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:07.720
It's gonna be about combat leadership and we're going to teach the fundamental

669
00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:12.930
principles of combat leadership and how to apply them on the battlefield in

670
00:48:13.571 --> 00:48:18.550
business and in life,
all,
all three.
And they're all,

671
00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:19.540
you're going to see when you come,

672
00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:23.890
you're going to see how all three of the applications are the same.

673
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:27.820
These fundamental combat leadership principles,

674
00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:32.940
they don't change regardless of whether you're out hunting down bad guys or

675
00:48:33.251 --> 00:48:36.520
whether you're hunting for a sale,
they don't change.

676
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:39.910
And their response to the event has been,

677
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:44.080
it's been awesome and we've got a ton of people come into it,

678
00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:46.930
which likely means it looks like we're going to do another event.

679
00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:50.350
Possibly we got to carve the time out of the schedule,

680
00:48:50.351 --> 00:48:55.351
but it looks like possibly the spring of 2017 likely going to be somewhere on

681
00:48:57.191 --> 00:48:59.770
the east coast.
If it's going to be somewhere on the east coast,

682
00:48:59.771 --> 00:49:03.340
there's probably a pretty good chance.
Uh,
we'll be looking at New York City,

683
00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:06.100
not set in stone that we're going to do it,

684
00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:09.640
not set in stone when we're going to do it.
We might wait another year.

685
00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:12.310
I don't know yet.
It's just up in the air.

686
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.970
We have so much stuff on our plates right now that we've got to figure out if we

687
00:49:15.971 --> 00:49:18.160
can fit it in.
But if we do it again,

688
00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.920
maybe we'll head out to the east coast and you know,

689
00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:26.410
New York City get some.
Now the next part of this question is,

690
00:49:26.411 --> 00:49:29.860
are there any repeating patterns or common weaknesses that business owners need

691
00:49:29.861 --> 00:49:34.330
to work on?
And the answer is yes,
absolutely there are.

692
00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:39.040
And we see the same issues from company to company and from leader to leader and

693
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:42.550
the same issues that we see in the civilian sector or the same issues that we

694
00:49:42.551 --> 00:49:47.551
saw while we were working with seal platoons and training soup tunes and the

695
00:49:48.461 --> 00:49:52.300
core problems that we see or what we wrote about in the book extreme ownership.

696
00:49:52.301 --> 00:49:55.300
That's one of the reasons we wrote the book was because when we'd work with

697
00:49:55.301 --> 00:49:57.610
these companies,
people would say,
do you have this stuff written down anywhere?

698
00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.490
And eventually we wrote it down.

699
00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:04.730
Now what are some of those issues that we run into me?

700
00:50:04.731 --> 00:50:07.620
And you've got departments and divisions that aren't working together to cover

701
00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.780
move.
You've got communications not being made in a simple,
clear,
concise manner.

702
00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:15.970
You got either too much micromanagement which leaves the troops did take no

703
00:50:15.971 --> 00:50:20.971
initiative or you've got not enough guidance and the troops now don't know which

704
00:50:20.981 --> 00:50:21.940
direction to head into.

705
00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:27.010
Or you get a company that's trying to take on too many projects are too many

706
00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:30.020
initiatives at the same time and they don't prioritize and execute.

707
00:50:30.021 --> 00:50:33.740
So they ended up getting none of them done.
And,

708
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:38.950
and then the obviously the most impactful one is when you have leaders and team

709
00:50:41.421 --> 00:50:46.010
members taking ownership,
real ownership,

710
00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:52.180
extreme ownership of everything in a world to make sure that problems get

711
00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:58.480
uncovered and owned and resolved because if leaders and members of the team,

712
00:51:01.221 --> 00:51:02.780
if they don't take ownership of the problems,

713
00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:07.790
then guess who solves the problems?
Nobody.

714
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:11.690
So these are all,
again,

715
00:51:11.691 --> 00:51:16.691
these are our fundamental problems that I saw when I was training seal platoons

716
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:21.860
and it's the same thing I see now is the same solutions that we apply to these

717
00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:26.060
same problems.
Learning the tactics,

718
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:29.840
the fundamental tactics of leadership is is what we get down to

719
00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:38.000
and we'll see at the muster.
All right,
next,

720
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:42.710
this next question is from Damien Hudson.

721
00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:47.870
What does Jocko struggle with or maybe better to say,

722
00:51:47.871 --> 00:51:50.060
what is he at work on?

723
00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:55.280
He comes across bulletproof and just pushes through on everything.

724
00:51:57.590 --> 00:52:01.880
Would like to know his method for identifying weaknesses and putting structures

725
00:52:01.881 --> 00:52:04.580
in place to resolve,
correct,
improve,

726
00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:09.440
would like to know his approach for his personal challenges?
Well,
first of all,

727
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:14.270
I can assure you that I am far from bulletproof.

728
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:19.310
And when you ask what I struggle with,
I struggle with everything.
I'm,

729
00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:24.290
I'm not naturally gifted at pretty much anything.

730
00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:29.510
I'm not naturally strong.
I'm not naturally fast though certainly not the,
uh,

731
00:52:29.511 --> 00:52:33.710
the sharpest tool in the shed.
And so I constantly have to work on my weaknesses.

732
00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:38.540
Andy,
if you want to know what my weaknesses are,
theirs,

733
00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:42.140
we don't have enough time on the podcast to list all my weaknesses.

734
00:52:42.141 --> 00:52:42.890
I mean it just,

735
00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:47.890
that's the way it is now as far as my method for identifying weaknesses,

736
00:52:48.951 --> 00:52:49.670
it's pretty simple.

737
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:54.670
I'm a constantly doing a self assessment and detaching and looking at what I'm

738
00:52:55.941 --> 00:52:59.960
doing and what I can do better.
And I asked people that are close to me,

739
00:52:59.961 --> 00:53:03.710
people that I trust,
ask them if they have any feedback for me,

740
00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.440
ask them if anything I could do better or where I can improve.

741
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:10.640
So that's pretty simple.
Do a self assessment,

742
00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:13.820
ask other people and find out what your weaknesses are and what you could do

743
00:53:13.821 --> 00:53:16.340
better.
And then the next part of the question is,

744
00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:20.450
what do I do to put structures in place to resolve correct and improve?

745
00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:26.010
Well,
I,
I just attack those problems.

746
00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:33.330
We weakness identified Roger attack the weakness problem identified Roger attack

747
00:53:33.961 --> 00:53:35.700
the problem.
And I'll tell you,

748
00:53:35.701 --> 00:53:40.140
I'm not a guy that spends a bunch of time over analyzing or overplanning or

749
00:53:40.141 --> 00:53:43.230
diving deep into meditation on how I'm going to attack a problem.

750
00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:45.960
I simply attack the problem.
Now,

751
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:51.210
that doesn't mean that I blindly attack and it doesn't mean that I hold a course

752
00:53:51.211 --> 00:53:55.230
without checking on my progress.
As I attack a problem,

753
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:58.800
I'm going to continually assess and make sure that I'm on the right course,

754
00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:01.520
that I'm,
that I'm headed in the right direction and,

755
00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:06.730
and making sure that it's the most efficient path and I will absolutely change

756
00:54:07.141 --> 00:54:09.630
course if I see something I can do better.

757
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:14.220
And because I have that kind of attitude,

758
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:20.750
it allows me to move quickly to execute and then initiate change and alter the

759
00:54:21.511 --> 00:54:23.220
course as I go if it's needed.

760
00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:26.280
And it's the same attitude that I had when I was in the seal teams.

761
00:54:26.281 --> 00:54:31.281
I could be very decisive very quickly because the decisions themselves did not

762
00:54:31.741 --> 00:54:36.420
close my mind.
The decisions did not close my mind.

763
00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:41.310
I would make a decision and I would continue to reassess and readjust as needed,

764
00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:47.190
but also as we moved forward towards a solution.

765
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:52.980
So you got a problem.
Step one,
identify the problem.

766
00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:55.590
Step two,
attack it.
Step three,

767
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:58.890
reassess and adjust and keep attacking.

768
00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:01.800
Get that thing solved.

769
00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:07.560
Next question is from Chris Bell,

770
00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:14.280
how to stay motivated when every day is a struggle to accomplish goals.

771
00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:18.870
Well,
I can tell you very easily this is,

772
00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:24.210
this isn't about motivation and accomplishing your goals is not about
motivation.

773
00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.230
It's about discipline.

774
00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:28.050
I already talked about that once a day and I'll say it again.

775
00:55:28.290 --> 00:55:30.450
I probably talked about it more than you want us to talk to about it a bunch.

776
00:55:30.451 --> 00:55:33.120
I talk about it all the time.
It is about discipline.

777
00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:36.000
Motivation is fickle.

778
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:40.740
Motivation comes and go.
I mean,
you think about motivation.
You,

779
00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:45.120
you is sympt something as simply as being hungry.
Can Sap your motivation,

780
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:49.620
right?
That's ridiculous.
You can't rely on that.
You have,

781
00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:52.890
oh my blood sugar went down.
I'm,
I'm not motivated anymore.
Oh,

782
00:55:52.891 --> 00:55:55.620
I didn't get enough caffeine.
I'm not motivated.
No wrong answer.

783
00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.080
Motivation is unreliable.

784
00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:00.540
And when you're counting on motivation to get your goals accomplished,

785
00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:04.620
you're likely going to fall short.
So don't count on motivation.

786
00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:07.200
Count on discipline.

787
00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:13.410
You know what you have to do.
Go make yourself do it.

788
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.990
Make yourself do it.
Everybody wants it.

789
00:56:17.991 --> 00:56:22.060
Some kind of magic pill or some life hacker,

790
00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:25.830
something that eliminates the need to do the work.
Well,

791
00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:30.190
I will tell you what you need to do the work.

792
00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:36.610
You got to hold the line,
you got to make it happen yourself.

793
00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:39.400
You have to make it happen.
It's not going to happen on its own.

794
00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:42.580
You have to make it happen.
So dig in,

795
00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:47.860
find the discipline,
the discipline,

796
00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:52.840
and accomplish the goals.
Period.
That's it.

797
00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:04.380
And our next question is from Austin Farley and he said best advice to today's

798
00:57:08.471 --> 00:57:13.471
active duty force regardless of branch about career oversight,

799
00:57:13.601 --> 00:57:16.060
deployments,
differences between all sorts service members.
Okay.

800
00:57:16.061 --> 00:57:19.300
So the basic question is best advice.
Well,
the advice

801
00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:25.450
besides be aggressive and stay safe.
That's my number one.
Uh,

802
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:30.510
I would tell you for me the biggest component for success in the military in my

803
00:57:31.691 --> 00:57:34.210
opinion,
is to do a great job in whatever you're doing.

804
00:57:34.211 --> 00:57:36.430
And I know that sounds pretty obvious,
but I'll tell you,

805
00:57:36.431 --> 00:57:37.820
I saw a lot of guys over the years,

806
00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:42.860
we're always looking for the next ticket to punch or the next good deal or the

807
00:57:43.661 --> 00:57:47.290
next job that they had to get to take to make a promotional or whatever.

808
00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:49.630
And for me,
for the most part,

809
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:52.990
I just took what they gave me and I did the best I could at it.

810
00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:58.180
And I'll tell you,
not only did this keep the navy happy cause the navy,

811
00:57:58.210 --> 00:58:00.070
you know,
they had a trooper that was just getting after it.

812
00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:05.160
It also kept me happy cause I wasn't sweating the promotion or the evaluations

813
00:58:05.801 --> 00:58:09.130
or any of the political stuff.
I was just,

814
00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:14.440
I wasn't getting after it to the best of my ability.
And if you do that,
I,

815
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:18.580
in my opinion,
if you do that,
your career will take care of itself.

816
00:58:19.410 --> 00:58:24.100
You'll get the good jobs because people will want you in those good jobs.

817
00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:29.440
And the other thing I would say is this

818
00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:37.420
a big piece of being in the military?
Is it gut check?

819
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:40.390
This hard work?

820
00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:44.410
It's either too hot or too cold.

821
00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:49.060
It's not enough food.
It's not enough sleep.
It's not enough water.

822
00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:50.920
It's hurry up and wait.

823
00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:57.010
It's planned for months to do nothing and then don't plan at all to do something

824
00:58:57.011 --> 00:59:00.580
for months.
And on top of all that,

825
00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:05.080
you throw the politics and the egos and the bureaucracy,

826
00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:09.910
and when you mix all that together,
it can be pretty miserable.

827
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:17.110
But I will tell you this,
all that misery,

828
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.863
relish,

829
00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:25.940
relish every moment of it because those hard things,

830
00:59:25.941 --> 00:59:27.320
those rough things,

831
00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:33.370
those are a part of the experience of the military and it's experiences like

832
00:59:34.011 --> 00:59:38.600
that.
I promise you will fall for some twisted reason.

833
00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:42.020
You will miss them when you leave.

834
00:59:43.790 --> 00:59:47.300
So don't hate them.
Don't avoid them.

835
00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:52.130
Dive into them and kick them in the ass with a smile on your face.

836
00:59:52.350 --> 00:59:56.360
Because another thing is that smile is contagious and you'll elevate the morale

837
00:59:56.361 --> 01:00:00.350
of your whole unit
when you wear that smile.

838
01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:05.420
So have fun and kick ass at what you're doing.

839
01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:10.700
And for those of you out there on the front lines,
like I said,

840
01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:12.230
to be aggressive,

841
01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:17.600
the best way to mitigate risk on the battlefield is to be aggressive.

842
01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:20.300
Do not be reactive.

843
01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.760
Step up and get after it.

844
01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:30.500
And by the way,
tall you active duty folks.

845
01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:35.660
Thank you for what you're doing and for the vets that are listening.

846
01:00:35.810 --> 01:00:37.370
Thank you for what you did.

847
01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.320
Next up,
I got a question from

848
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.860
Paul wet kick and it says,
unfortunately,
this is to Tim,

849
01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:52.970
I guess unfortunately you Rogan and Harris all pussyfooting around him.

850
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:56.990
I realize he's probably in an intimidating presence,

851
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:59.540
but ask him how he feels about killing people,

852
01:00:59.541 --> 01:01:04.541
especially possibly innocence and don't let him use the doing my job bad guys,

853
01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:11.060
collateral damage narratives.
Ask him how he feels about it.

854
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:15.530
He's intelligent enough to cope with being pressed for an authentic answer.

855
01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:24.520
So Paul wants to know about killing people and possibly killing innocent people.

856
01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.010
And what?
That's how I feel about that.

857
01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:34.220
So first of all,

858
01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:40.820
the nature of war is death.

859
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.880
The nature of war is,
is killing.

860
01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:53.730
That is what war is.
And of course there's all kinds of other components to war.

861
01:01:53.731 --> 01:01:57.410
There's economic and cultural and diplomatic and strategic.

862
01:01:57.411 --> 01:02:02.240
But at its fundamental core wars about death and war is about killing.

863
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:06.500
And in the question here,

864
01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:12.350
I'm told I'm not allowed to use the narrative of doing my job,

865
01:02:12.351 --> 01:02:17.351
but there's a reason why that narrative exists because death and killing

866
01:02:17.811 --> 01:02:20.010
actually is the job of a soldier.

867
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:25.980
And we train for that job and when the time comes,

868
01:02:25.981 --> 01:02:28.560
we do our job and we are good with it.

869
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:33.240
Now part of that

870
01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:36.090
comes from the training,

871
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:42.200
and part of that also comes from the dehumanization of the enemy.

872
01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:48.360
Yes,
that is a true statement.

873
01:02:48.990 --> 01:02:52.410
The enemy becomes dehumanized to the soldier.

874
01:02:55.110 --> 01:02:59.940
That's one of the reasons why soldiers are generally okay with it.

875
01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:03.750
And in the past,
the military had to help that process along.

876
01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:09.780
They had to help the soldier dehumanize the enemy.

877
01:03:09.810 --> 01:03:12.150
And it still does do that to some extent,

878
01:03:12.151 --> 01:03:15.120
but I think in the wars that we are in now,

879
01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:19.770
we don't need any help dehumanizing the enemy.

880
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:25.260
The enemy dehumanizes himself.

881
01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:30.360
You see,
we in the military,

882
01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:34.470
we witness what they do,

883
01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:37.410
we see what they do,

884
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:44.510
we see the results of the torture and the rape and the murder.

885
01:03:47.970 --> 01:03:50.880
We see families beheaded,

886
01:03:51.030 --> 01:03:54.120
we see people skinned alive.

887
01:03:56.910 --> 01:04:00.270
We see young people,
kids,

888
01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.353
kids

889
01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:07.710
forced to carry out suicide bombings.

890
01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:14.680
And now
with the Internet inaction,

891
01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:19.700
the whole world can see the completely despicable and brutal behavior of these

892
01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:25.080
sub human savages,

893
01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:30.540
burning people alive,
throwing people from buildings,

894
01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:32.700
drowning people in cages,

895
01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.210
10 year old sex slaves.

896
01:04:38.850 --> 01:04:43.410
It's absolutely disgusting and abhorrent.

897
01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:50.870
And I will tell you that I have no problem whatsoever killing all these vile

898
01:04:52.231 --> 01:04:53.820
creatures,
all of them.

899
01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:04.120
Now you also ask about killing innocents,

900
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:06.930
killing innocent people.

901
01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:10.440
And as I already stated,

902
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:13.410
the nature of war is death

903
01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:20.380
and in war innocent people sometimes are killed.

904
01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:25.330
Then you,
you want to know how I feel about it?
Well,
it is horrible.

905
01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:32.860
It is horrible.
It is awful when it does occur and yes,

906
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:34.270
it does occur.

907
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:38.710
They didn't let me tell you

908
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:44.320
that America goes through great lengths,

909
01:05:44.321 --> 01:05:46.210
extreme lengths,

910
01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:51.270
and in doing so incurs incredible risk to prevent killing innocent people on the

911
01:05:51.491 --> 01:05:52.324
battlefield.

912
01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:59.520
When I fought with the one one AED in the bowel Ramadi in 2006 the entire

913
01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:01.300
strategy,

914
01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:06.420
the entire strategy was developed to minimize not only the killing of innocent

915
01:06:06.611 --> 01:06:11.320
people,
but also to minimize the amount of infrastructure that was destroyed.

916
01:06:11.770 --> 01:06:15.670
So the buildings and the power and the water,
all of that.
And again,

917
01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.910
American troops took incredible risks,

918
01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:20.890
incredible risks to mitigate

919
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:24.220
the risks of civilians.

920
01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:32.650
But war is messy,
war is confusing,

921
01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:34.900
war is imperfect,

922
01:06:39.070 --> 01:06:40.660
war is hell.

923
01:06:44.050 --> 01:06:47.260
And despite all the efforts that we make,

924
01:06:47.261 --> 01:06:50.860
despite all the good intentions and the precautions and the planning,

925
01:06:50.861 --> 01:06:54.190
sometimes it isn't.
People are killed and it's horrible.

926
01:06:56.200 --> 01:07:01.200
It's horrible from a family of the slain and it's horrible for the military man

927
01:07:01.241 --> 01:07:04.180
that pulled the trigger or drop the bomb or through their grenade.

928
01:07:04.570 --> 01:07:09.570
It's horrible for the mission because in places like Iraq and Afghanistan,

929
01:07:10.071 --> 01:07:12.340
and we are there to protect the local populace.

930
01:07:12.341 --> 01:07:16.960
So it takes us backwards strategically as we try to win the hearts and minds of

931
01:07:16.961 --> 01:07:17.794
the people.

932
01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:23.080
But you know what?

933
01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.960
It doesn't defeat us.

934
01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:31.840
It doesn't beat us.

935
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:35.800
And it doesn't even turn the local populace against us.

936
01:07:35.801 --> 01:07:40.090
And I'm speaking now from my experience in the battle of Ramadi and let it be

937
01:07:40.091 --> 01:07:45.091
perfectly clear that the local population in Ramadi absolutely wanted us there.

938
01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:50.620
They wanted us on the ground in their neighborhoods.

939
01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:56.680
They wanted us to help them get rid of the insurgents that were terrorizing

940
01:07:56.681 --> 01:07:58.750
them,
literally terrorizing them.

941
01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:06.010
And when innocent people were killed,
for whatever reason,

942
01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:10.840
we apologized and we did what we could to help.

943
01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:15.500
And we met and we broke bread and we explained what had gone wrong and we asked

944
01:08:15.501 --> 01:08:19.160
what we could do to help and we paid the money and we help them repair their

945
01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:21.890
buildings.
We did whatever we could,

946
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:28.130
and I will tell you in this never gets represented in the press,

947
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:32.960
but most of the time the local populace,
they understood,

948
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:38.750
they understood it was a war.

949
01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:44.480
They understood it was a war against evil and they understood that that meant

950
01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:45.560
violence

951
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:52.870
and they understood that in our efforts to help them get rid of the cancer that

952
01:08:54.291 --> 01:08:55.670
ravage their city.

953
01:08:59.150 --> 01:09:00.440
Well,
they understood

954
01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:05.120
that there would be bloodshed in removing that cancer.

955
01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:15.170
War is hell.

956
01:09:18.230 --> 01:09:23.230
It is best to be avoided at all costs so that innocent lives are not lost,

957
01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:31.873
but

958
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:38.950
sometimes war cannot be avoided and sometimes war should not be avoided

959
01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:46.340
sometimes in order to protect the innocence.

960
01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:49.220
War is the only choice

961
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:53.960
and I am thankful

962
01:09:56.030 --> 01:10:00.740
that there are men and women in the military that have the courage and the

963
01:10:00.741 --> 01:10:05.741
strength and the moral fortitude to stand up and face evil and to also withstand

964
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.740
the awful burden

965
01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:15.830
of killing they end of death.

966
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:21.260
Now I think this is the last question here.

967
01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:28.780
This question came from and Vasily.

968
01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:31.453
It says,

969
01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:36.490
what are the biggest lessons learned from Jujitsu that transcend the art of

970
01:10:36.621 --> 01:10:41.540
fighting itself?
And can be applied to being an effective leader.

971
01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:45.043
So

972
01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:52.450
I'm a practitioner of Jujitsu and it is a pretty incredible,

973
01:10:56.610 --> 01:11:01.250
it's a pretty incredible thing to train.
And for those either train Jujitsu,

974
01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:04.880
you know what I'm talking about.
For those of you that don't train Jujitsu,

975
01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:06.620
go train Jujitsu

976
01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:12.980
cause there's so much to be learned from Jujitsu about leadership and about
life.

977
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:15.750
I mean,
for instance,

978
01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:18.360
I talked about discipline a lot today in Jujitsu,

979
01:11:18.361 --> 01:11:23.361
you're going to learn about discipline because it takes discipline to get on the

980
01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:27.120
mat day after day,
week after week,
month after month,
a year after year.

981
01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:33.420
And you won't always feel like training.
As Fun as Jujitsu is,

982
01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:35.280
there's gonna be days you don't feel like training.

983
01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:38.160
But you have to find the discipline and you have to do it.

984
01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:40.380
So you're going to learn about discipline.
In Jujitsu,

985
01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:45.590
you're also going to learn about humility because in Jujitsu you will get

986
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:47.303
humbled.

987
01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:52.770
You will get beat by people that are smaller than you and weaker than you,

988
01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:54.300
and they will smash you.

989
01:11:55.290 --> 01:11:57.990
They will literally submit you.

990
01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:02.580
And that is humbling and there is no escaping it.

991
01:12:04.770 --> 01:12:05.603
And those,

992
01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:10.080
those are very important because like I said,

993
01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:14.130
I've said this before is that those are lessons that some traditional martial

994
01:12:14.131 --> 01:12:18.780
arts would try and teach you almost as theoretical lessons.
You know,
like you,

995
01:12:18.781 --> 01:12:22.650
you must be disciplined,
they'll tell you that in theory.
But in Jujitsu,

996
01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:25.710
like I said,
without,
without discipline,
there's no,
there's no progress.

997
01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:30.540
And in a traditional martial art they'll say,
oh,
you know,
you must be humble.

998
01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:35.280
But like I said,
and Jujitsu you actually get humbled.

999
01:12:36.570 --> 01:12:39.630
So jujitsu teaches you a lot about life

1000
01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:44.730
and that's one of the things that make it,
it's so powerful.

1001
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:48.000
And it as the question back to the question was,

1002
01:12:48.001 --> 01:12:49.280
what does it teach you about leadership at?

1003
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:51.630
Absolutely teaches you some key things about leadership.

1004
01:12:51.631 --> 01:12:54.840
And I'll give you a couple of the most important elements.

1005
01:12:56.370 --> 01:12:59.010
First of all,
and detachment,

1006
01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:03.120
and I've mentioned this word a couple of times today and Jujitsu,

1007
01:13:03.121 --> 01:13:03.781
I'll tell you right now,

1008
01:13:03.781 --> 01:13:08.460
if you let your star self start to get frustrated or you let yourself start to

1009
01:13:08.461 --> 01:13:11.730
get angry or just emotional in general,

1010
01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:14.160
you will start to make bad decisions.

1011
01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:20.490
And when you start to make bad decisions,
that is the beginning of the end.

1012
01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:25.620
So you have to be able to detach from that emotion,
that frustration,

1013
01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:28.170
and you've got to focus on doing the right thing at the right time.

1014
01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:31.500
It's absolutely necessary.
And,

1015
01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:36.530
and that's the same thing in a combat leadership position or in any leadership

1016
01:13:36.691 --> 01:13:37.524
situation,

1017
01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:42.740
you cannot get caught up in all the chaos and all the mayhem.

1018
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:46.770
You can't let your emotions get ahold of you.

1019
01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:50.760
So you have to be able to detach from that.

1020
01:13:50.761 --> 01:13:55.230
You have to be able to step back and breathe and see the full picture of what is

1021
01:13:55.231 --> 01:14:00.231
happening without the cloud of emotion and all of that mayhem obscuring your

1022
01:14:00.481 --> 01:14:04.170
vision so that you can make good decisions.

1023
01:14:06.090 --> 01:14:10.980
And Jujitsu,
we'll teach you to do that.
Now,
another piece,

1024
01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.930
Jujitsu that transfers directly into,

1025
01:14:14.710 --> 01:14:19.710
into leadership is the idea of indirect warfare,

1026
01:14:21.610 --> 01:14:22.570
right?
So when Jujitsu,

1027
01:14:22.571 --> 01:14:26.350
the whole premise is to attack the weaknesses of your opponent.

1028
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:29.140
You don't want tack their strengths,
you want to attack it.
I mean,

1029
01:14:29.141 --> 01:14:33.500
just fundamentally you,
you attack the weak areas of their body,

1030
01:14:33.501 --> 01:14:35.130
like the joints or the neck.
You're,

1031
01:14:35.131 --> 01:14:37.570
you're not attacking the strongest parts of their body.

1032
01:14:38.050 --> 01:14:41.920
And if you attack where your opponent is strong.

1033
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:47.070
So if you have a opponent that's very good at defending one type of one position

1034
01:14:48.431 --> 01:14:49.360
or one type of hold,

1035
01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:51.550
you're just going to wear yourself out as if you're attacking that.

1036
01:14:51.551 --> 01:14:53.500
And eventually you're gonna run out of energy and then they're going to get the

1037
01:14:53.501 --> 01:14:57.700
advantage.
So you can't just attack the strengths,

1038
01:14:57.701 --> 01:15:00.280
you have to attack the weak points in Jujitsu.
And how on top of that,

1039
01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.070
you also have to distract your opponent

1040
01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.960
and you have to make them defend some area.

1041
01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:12.310
So you might maybe attack one area so that they put their defenses there,

1042
01:15:12.490 --> 01:15:13.600
but it's just a faint,

1043
01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.630
because what you're really gonna do is you're gonna go and attack and area

1044
01:15:16.631 --> 01:15:19.660
whether or not defending you're going to attack their weak areas.

1045
01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:22.630
And it's the same thing with leadership.

1046
01:15:23.850 --> 01:15:28.850
And the clearest example of where this is directly seen in leadership is when

1047
01:15:29.771 --> 01:15:31.570
you're dealing with people's key goes.

1048
01:15:32.650 --> 01:15:35.500
So you take a person that has a big strong ego,

1049
01:15:36.650 --> 01:15:41.650
you don't attack that ego head on that we'll just make that person get ultra

1050
01:15:44.081 --> 01:15:48.430
defensive.
Or if you attack their ego,
they're going to get defensive immediately.

1051
01:15:48.431 --> 01:15:50.980
Now you've built up,
now you're gonna have an even harder fight.

1052
01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.590
So what you do is you bypass the regal.

1053
01:15:53.591 --> 01:15:55.690
Maybe you even massage their ego a little bit

1054
01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:58.930
so that they let down their guard

1055
01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.830
so that they let you into their head a little bit.

1056
01:16:02.831 --> 01:16:05.260
And then tactically and quietly,

1057
01:16:05.410 --> 01:16:08.860
you sneak in and you plant the seeds of what you're trying to get them to do,

1058
01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:12.310
of where you're trying to lead them.

1059
01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:18.850
And soon enough without seeing it,

1060
01:16:18.851 --> 01:16:20.140
those seeds are going to grow.

1061
01:16:20.530 --> 01:16:25.390
And your idea and your plan and your leadership comes to fruition.

1062
01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:30.700
And that is indirect warfare.
And it's the same thing in Jujitsu.

1063
01:16:30.701 --> 01:16:32.980
It's the same thing in business and it's actually the same thing on the

1064
01:16:32.981 --> 01:16:33.910
battlefield as well.

1065
01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:38.960
We don't attack enemy strengths unless it cannot be avoided.

1066
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:44.620
So take up that Jujitsu,
start training,

1067
01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.950
and apply those lessons across the board in your life.

1068
01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:54.860
And I think that's,
I think that's it for questions for now.
Uh,

1069
01:16:55.450 --> 01:17:00.450
thanks to everybody for listening and thanks of course to Mister Mister Tim

1070
01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:05.350
Ferris for having me on.
Tim has been for those of you don't know,

1071
01:17:05.351 --> 01:17:10.160
he's been a huge supporter since I met him and I really appreciate Tim.

1072
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:15.100
Everything you done for me and everything that's kind of stemmed from that has

1073
01:17:15.101 --> 01:17:16.270
been,
has been awesome.

1074
01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:20.320
The interaction from everybody through social media and Twitter and Facebook and

1075
01:17:20.321 --> 01:17:24.220
all that and everyone that's listening and giving me feedback on,

1076
01:17:24.221 --> 01:17:28.380
on the podcasts that I have and the book,
uh,
that,

1077
01:17:28.381 --> 01:17:31.570
that I wrote with my buddy Lafe and it's just awesome to connect with so many

1078
01:17:31.571 --> 01:17:36.160
people and it's awesome to know that there's so many people that are in the
game.

1079
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:41.050
So many people that want to get after it,
dislike me,
looking to get better,

1080
01:17:41.051 --> 01:17:43.330
looking to do better,
look in a be better.

1081
01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:49.660
So thanks to everybody for everything.
And like I said,

1082
01:17:49.661 --> 01:17:54.400
especially thanks to Tim for,
uh,
for kicking this whole thing off.

1083
01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:59.790
So until next time,
this is Jocko

1084
01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:02.193
out.

1085
01:18:03.710 --> 01:18:07.100
<v 3>Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

1086
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:10.100
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1087
01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:13.370
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1088
01:18:13.371 --> 01:18:17.510
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

1089
01:18:17.511 --> 01:18:21.050
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

1090
01:18:21.051 --> 01:18:25.400
short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

1091
01:18:25.401 --> 01:18:26.720
pondering over the week.

1092
01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:29.690
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1093
01:18:29.691 --> 01:18:33.140
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1094
01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:37.430
somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1095
01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:42.760
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

1096
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:46.130
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

1097
01:18:46.190 --> 01:18:51.190
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

1098
01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:53.420
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

1099
01:18:53.690 --> 01:18:58.640
Just go to four hour work week.com that's four hour workweek.com all spelled out

1100
01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:01.550
and just drop in your email and you will get the very next one.

1101
01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:03.620
And if you sign up,
I hope you enjoy it.

1102
01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:08.720
This episode is brought to you by Wealthfront and this is a very unique sponsor.

1103
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:13.520
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive in a good way,
set it and forget it.

1104
01:19:13.521 --> 01:19:17.870
Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous

1105
01:19:17.871 --> 01:19:18.650
investors.

1106
01:19:18.650 --> 01:19:22.340
It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and they now have more than

1107
01:19:22.341 --> 01:19:25.340
two and a half billion dollars under management.
In fact,

1108
01:19:25.370 --> 01:19:26.720
some of my very good friends,

1109
01:19:26.721 --> 01:19:29.900
investors in silicon valley have millions of their own money in Wealthfront.

1110
01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:32.960
So the question is why?
Why is it so popular?
Why is it unique?

1111
01:19:33.230 --> 01:19:37.280
Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

1112
01:19:37.281 --> 01:19:39.230
pay pennies on the dollar for them.

1113
01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:42.980
And this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations,

1114
01:19:42.981 --> 01:19:45.710
bloated sales teams,
et cetera.
And I'll come back to that in a second.

1115
01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:50.900
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk

1116
01:19:50.901 --> 01:19:51.621
assessment quiz,

1117
01:19:51.621 --> 01:19:55.550
which only takes two to five minutes and they'll show you for free exactly the

1118
01:19:55.551 --> 01:19:58.460
portfolio they'd put you in.
And if you just want to take their advice,

1119
01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:01.850
run with it,
do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

1120
01:20:01.851 --> 01:20:03.740
you can set it and forget it.
Here's why.

1121
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:08.070
The value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that

1122
01:20:08.071 --> 01:20:11.490
investors should be using on a regular basis but normally aren't.

1123
01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:14.100
Great investing is a marathon,
not a sprint,

1124
01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:17.820
and little things that you may or may not be familiar with like automatic tax

1125
01:20:17.821 --> 01:20:19.980
loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

1126
01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:24.450
cross more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment add up to very large

1127
01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:28.170
amounts of money over longer periods of time.
Wealthfront,
as I mentioned,

1128
01:20:28.171 --> 01:20:30.780
since it's using software instead of retail locations,

1129
01:20:30.781 --> 01:20:34.980
etc. Can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely

1130
01:20:34.981 --> 01:20:36.540
impossible right off the bat,

1131
01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:39.000
you never pay commissions or account fees for everything.

1132
01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:44.001
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above the first 15,000 which is managed for

1133
01:20:44.641 --> 01:20:46.680
free.
If you use my link,

1134
01:20:46.710 --> 01:20:51.030
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim that is less than $5 a month to invest a

1135
01:20:51.031 --> 01:20:55.110
$30,000 account,
for instance.
Now.
Normally when I have a sponsor on this show,

1136
01:20:55.111 --> 01:20:58.650
it's because I use them and recommend them.
In this case,
it's a little different.

1137
01:20:59.010 --> 01:21:02.940
I don't use Wealthfront yet because I'm not allowed to.
Here's the deal.

1138
01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:07.200
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of SCC regulations,

1139
01:21:07.410 --> 01:21:10.890
companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials.

1140
01:21:10.891 --> 01:21:13.680
So I couldn't be a user end have them on the podcast,

1141
01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.820
but I've been so impressed by wealth front that I've invested a significant

1142
01:21:17.821 --> 01:21:21.630
amount of my own money,
at least for me,
uh,
in the team and the company itself.

1143
01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:24.720
So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client.

1144
01:21:24.930 --> 01:21:28.320
Now back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

1145
01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:32.160
you'll get $15,000 managed for free if you decide to open an account.

1146
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:35.160
But just start with seeing the portfolio that they would suggest for you.

1147
01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:39.390
Take two minutes,
fill out their questionnaire@wealthfront.com forward slash.
Tim,

1148
01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:42.510
it's fast,
it's free.
There's no downside that I can think of.

1149
01:21:42.810 --> 01:21:45.360
This episode is brought to you by headspace.

1150
01:21:45.690 --> 01:21:48.510
More than 80% of the people I have interviewed,

1151
01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:53.550
world class performers across the military,
entertainment,
sports,

1152
01:21:53.610 --> 01:21:57.570
and beyond all have some type of meditative practice.

1153
01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:00.750
I tried for years and years and failed miserably.

1154
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:04.770
The key is making it simple and you can dramatically improve your life in just

1155
01:22:04.771 --> 01:22:06.660
10 minutes a day and technology can help you.

1156
01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:11.130
This change comes through guided meditation and headspace is by far the most

1157
01:22:11.131 --> 01:22:15.480
popular app for this purpose.
More than 4 million users.

1158
01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:17.070
It's meditation made simple,

1159
01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:20.550
so what I recommend is that you take this practice meditation,

1160
01:22:20.551 --> 01:22:22.440
which is rooted in thousands of years of tradition,

1161
01:22:22.441 --> 01:22:27.441
supported by thousands of scientific studies and try it for 10 minutes a day for

1162
01:22:28.471 --> 01:22:32.430
10 days.
That's all you need to do.

That's all it takes.

1168
01:22:53.130 --> 01:22:54.030
