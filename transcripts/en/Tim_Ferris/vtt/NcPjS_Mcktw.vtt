00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.840
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:07.810
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking it.

3
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.610
I'm a cybernetic organism.

4
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.670
<v 1>Sepsis is brought to you by wordpress.
My goto platform for blogging,</v>

5
00:00:28.671 --> 00:00:31.280
writing online,
creating websites,
everything.

6
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.300
I love wordpress to bits.
My site,

7
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.360
every site just about that I have is run on wordpress and the lead developer of

8
00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:45.740
wordpress,
Matt Mullenweg has appeared on this podcast many times.

9
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.040
The very first episode in particular is amazing.

10
00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:53.600
The second I took a ton of notes on,
so he's checking out,
but wordpress,

11
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.100
where do I even begin?
I mean the New Yorker uses it,
Jay z,
Beyonce,

12
00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:01.580
they use it.
Five 38 tech crunch,
ted CNN time.

13
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.740
Whether you are looking to create a personal blog,
a business site,
both,

14
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.420
neither,
something else,

15
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.510
you'll make a huge impact when you build your website on wordpress.com and

16
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.050
directly from some friends at Google.
I'm not going to quote them by name,

17
00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:23.000
but they say that wordpress offers the best out of the box SEO.

18
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.290
That's search engine optimization imaginable,
so if you're on wordpress,

19
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.320
you immediately have a leg up on everybody else.

20
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.250
On search engines and so forth.
In my experience,

21
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.780
I'm no medical doctor of search engine optimization,

22
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.790
but I will say that I used wordpress for years and fell in love with it to the

23
00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:49.091
extent that I became very close friends with Matt and then became an investor

24
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.600
slash advisor to automatic which runs wordpress doc on.

25
00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:58.400
That is how much I believe in this and that's how a lot of my most successful

26
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.450
products and investments have come about because I'm in love with x and then I

27
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:03.770
seek out x.

28
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.010
Nearly 30% of the Internet is run on wordpress and that includes everything from

29
00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:13.940
the huge sites that I mentioned to neighborhood sites and it is super easy to

30
00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:17.660
get started.
There's no need to worry about security or upgrades or hosting.

31
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.150
They offer 24 seven support and handle all of that which allows you to focus on

32
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.530
creating the highest quality content that you can with the least amount of

33
00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:29.690
friction.
I don't have to worry about downtime.

34
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.770
I don't want to have to worry about getting emergency emails if I'm on vacation

35
00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:38.210
or something like that,
and wordpress is my goto solution for all of this.

36
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:43.211
I trust all of my most important text on the Internet to wordpress and they

37
00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:47.870
can't buy that with a sponsorship.
They can't buy that with anything.

38
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.230
I want uptime,
uptime,
uptime,
and quality,

39
00:02:51.231 --> 00:02:54.410
and that is what I have selected after everything that I've looked at.

40
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.600
So check it out.
Go to wordpress,

41
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.660
that's w o r d p r e s.com wordpress.com forward slash Tim to receive 15% off of

42
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:05.590

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.730
That's wordpress.com forward slash Tim

44
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.400
this episode is brought to you by 99 designs.

45
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:19.300
I've used 99 designs for years for all sorts of graphic design needs,

46
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.210
whether you need a logo,
website,
book cover,
anything else.

47
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.470
99 designs was created to make great designs accessible to everyone and to make

48
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:30.430
the process of getting designs much,
much easier.
So when I first started out,

49
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.230
for instance,
testing,

50
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.800
prototype covers and getting prototype covers for the four hour body,

51
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.040
I want the contest drop.
That is one option.
This is a great solution.

52
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:42.820
If you're looking for fast affordable design work and the ability to choose from

53
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:47.050
dozens of options risk-free.
Let's say you need something late night,

54
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:47.830
quick turnaround,

55
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.190
well people in other times on other countries can also help you solve that

56
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:52.660
problem.
Since then,

57
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.780
I've worked with 99 designs on a separate path or a different option and uh,

58
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.020
that is the one to one project service.
So in x number of cases,

59
00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:05.130
and I'll give you one example.

60
00:04:05.131 --> 00:04:09.030
When I wanted to create the cover for my audio book,
the Tao of Seneca,

61
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.470
this was a very important project to me.

62
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.740
I decided to use their one to one project service.

63
00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:16.920
And with this service you can invite a specific designer to your project,

64
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.001
agree on a price,

65
00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:20.670
and then work together until you're satisfied and they to you to iterate and

66
00:04:20.671 --> 00:04:24.300
provide feedback and all of this stuff.
And I haven't shared it yet,

67
00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:26.550
but we also got some incredibly good,

68
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.760
really some of the best illustrations I've ever seen from using this one to one

69
00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:35.100
project service with a handful of different designers and illustrators.

70
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.060
It blew my mind.
99 designs makes this all very easy and efficient,

71
00:04:39.061 --> 00:04:43.800
so you can check out the Tao of Seneca design and other work that I and your

72
00:04:43.801 --> 00:04:48.540
fellow listeners for that matter have done on 99 designs@ninetyninedesigns.com

73
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:49.410
forward slash.

74

78
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.680
Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where it is my job to

79
00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:09.920
deconstruct world class performers of all different types.

80
00:05:09.921 --> 00:05:14.630
This episode features Kyle Maynard and you're going to want to check them out,

81
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.610
I promise,
and on Twitter you can say hello at Kyle Maynard,

People often ask me,
who inspires you?

83
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.270
Who Do you look up to?
One immediate answer is Kyle Maynard.

84
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.000
Despite being born without full arms or legs,

85
00:05:32.001 --> 00:05:36.530
he has gone on to achieve feats of athleticism and much more than most people

86
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.490
would only dream of.
They might not even think of dreaming of these things.

87
00:05:40.491 --> 00:05:45.200
This includes being the first quadruple amputee to climb Mount Kilimanjaro

88
00:05:45.201 --> 00:05:49.760
without the aid of prosthetics being inducted into the national wrestling hall

89
00:05:49.761 --> 00:05:51.620
of fame as in collegiate wrestling,

90
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.930
believe it and competing professionally in mixed martial.

91
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.230
He is just a female.
And,
uh,

92
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.630
we actually had a chance to do a short wrestling demo with takedowns and almost

93
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:10.520
broke my knee.
And then an arm throw on video,
which you can see.

94
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.230
And in this episode we cover many stories that Kyle has never discussed or

95
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:19.550
shared publicly before.
The audio comes from my new TV show fearless.

96
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.880
And that is fear less with less in parentheses because it's about learning to

97
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:27.440
fear less where I interviewed worth glass performers onstage about how they've

98
00:06:27.441 --> 00:06:31.340
overcome doubt,
conquered fear,
and made some of their toughest decisions.

99
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.520

So not direct TV,
but DIRECTV.

106
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.140
We recorded three hours of material and only one hour was used for the TV show.

107
00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:05.141
This podcast episode is almost entirely new content that did not appear on

108
00:07:05.661 --> 00:07:09.440
television.
So I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
So without further ado,

109
00:07:09.441 --> 00:07:12.050
here is the incredible Kyle Maynard

<v 1>I'm your host Tim Ferris and on this stage will be deconstructing world class</v>

112
00:07:22.891 --> 00:07:26.370
performers of all types to uncover the specific tactics they've used,

113
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.110
overcome doubt,
tackle hard decisions,
and ultimately succeed on their own terms.

114
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.070
My guest tonight is a member of the national wrestling hall of Fame And York

115
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.850
Times bestselling author and his summited Mount Kilimanjaro among others.

116
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.450
He inspires audiences around the world with this message and he congress

117
00:07:42.451 --> 00:07:46.530
challenges.
But this own unique style.
Please welcome to the stage athlete,

118
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.140
author and mountaineer,
Kyle Maynard.

119
00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:01.750
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

120
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.670
<v 1>how many siblings do you have?
Three sisters.
Three sisters?
Yeah.</v>

121
00:08:17.671 --> 00:08:18.504
What doesn't kill you?

122
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.390
<v 3>Yeah,
I grew up with one little brother,</v>

123
00:08:25.391 --> 00:08:27.580
so I would as the bastard in that relationship.

124
00:08:27.581 --> 00:08:30.140
I'm the leg I need to try this wrestling move onto.

125
00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:32.100
You're like running around the house.
Don't run away.

126
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:36.160
I know this is going to be fun.
That was,
I was on the inflicting side.

127
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:40.230
Unfortunately there are a lot of grown men.
I'd rather fight and my sisters.
Yes.

128
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.870
Your Dad seems like a tough dude.
Not bad dude,
but like tough former wrestler.

129
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.820
I'm sure he's loving that right now.
I really like to get off.
You'll see this

130
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.400
in fairness,
but how were your parents parenting styles

131
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:59.630
<v 4>different?
There was a difference for sure and I think it was like,</v>

132
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.630
it was a good balance.
Um,
wrestling.
My Dad was like,

133
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:06.890
he wanted me to be the finesse wrestler,
you know?
And my mom was like,

134
00:09:06.891 --> 00:09:09.590
she told me,
if you put somebody enough pain on the mat with you,

135
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.690
like they'll find a way to get out.
We'll find a way to get off of that.
And like,

136
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.920
that was the,
she was like,
had this like tenacity,
fuck a Cobra Kai.

137
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.920
Right.
It was,

138
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.053
thanks Bob.

139
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.600
When did your grandparents enter the picture in terms of your close relationship

140
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:37.020
with them?
Like hours after I was born.
Yeah,
they were there the whole time.

141
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.290
And what was your,
what was your relationship like with your,

142
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.880
with your grandparents?
I mean,
it's been the best without them.
I mean,

143
00:09:43.881 --> 00:09:45.260
there were everything to me,
you know,

144
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:49.240
I gotta like choke back the tears sometimes this and then my grandma's.

145
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:53.240
So she passed last year and it was really like a big moment for me in terms of,

146
00:09:53.241 --> 00:09:57.590
um,
kind of like that awakener of like,
what is my life about really,
you know,

147
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.700
my grandma,
you know,
uh,
you know,
so she's kind of said this,
you know,

148
00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:04.790
from her experiences,
you know,
in a,
in a,
like a religious background,

149
00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:08.150
but I think it can be sort of even like a more universal sense if you apply
this.

150
00:10:08.151 --> 00:10:12.410
Like she said that Kyle,
like God doesn't make mistakes,
you know,
like,

151
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.770
and I take that to go in mean to even like the universe doesn't make mistakes.

152
00:10:15.771 --> 00:10:19.340
Right.
That they're in and whether or not that's true,
it doesn't matter.

153
00:10:19.341 --> 00:10:21.770
But it's a cool,
it's an interesting place to come from.
Right?

154
00:10:21.771 --> 00:10:25.400
The stoics talk a lot about like fate and like how we're on this path and this

155
00:10:25.401 --> 00:10:28.130
trajectory and like whether or not that's true,
it doesn't really matter.

156
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:31.490
But if we go and you know,
act as if it's so,

157
00:10:31.491 --> 00:10:35.960
and that things are as they should be,
it's just a better place to be.

158
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.860
I think I used to pray every night,
like when I was a kid.
Like I would just like,

159
00:10:39.861 --> 00:10:43.480
wait,
I wish that I could wake up and have arms and legs,
you know?

160
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.820
And if I had spent my entire life focused on that,

161
00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.620
it would have been a different life.
Definitely.

162
00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.750
But she was everything.
I mean,
she,
she,

163
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:57.700
I think that the most powerful lesson that she ever taught me was,
um,

164
00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.920
we used to go around in grocery stores together,

165
00:10:59.921 --> 00:11:04.040
just up and down the aisles of the grocery store.
And sometimes,
you know,
when a,

166
00:11:04.041 --> 00:11:07.480
um,
we would meet people,
I mean,
she would just,
she would teach me,

167
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.110
says as soon as people hear your voice and they see your face and they shake

168
00:11:11.111 --> 00:11:15.170
your hand,
they'll totally forget about the disability.
And you know,

169
00:11:15.171 --> 00:11:18.800
it's like a embedded,
like hypnotic command almost,
you know?
And it's like,

170
00:11:18.801 --> 00:11:19.161
that's like,

171
00:11:19.161 --> 00:11:22.700
so much of my life has been colored by that everybody that I meet now,
you know,

172
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:27.140
I want to meet them and then 15 minutes after it's not really,

173
00:11:27.141 --> 00:11:30.020
the disability is not like that big of the deal.
Yeah.

174
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:35.330
<v 0>So [inaudible] now I can,</v>

175
00:11:37.161 --> 00:11:37.450
it's kind of

176
00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:41.590
<v 4>funny too cause like I can read people's eyes in terms of like,
you know,</v>

177
00:11:41.591 --> 00:11:44.380
almost like you can see like subtitles for only cross sometimes.
Right.

178
00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:48.460
I go to like shake somebodies head 99% of the time we get in normal handshake

179
00:11:48.461 --> 00:11:49.750
back or whatever,
if it's bump,
you know,

180
00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:53.380
and then like at that 1% of the time or less,
maybe one of it,

181
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.510
a couple of hundred.
I see this like just fear and panic,
right?
Yeah.

182
00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:59.230
You go to shake their hand and they're like pause and it's like,

183
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:02.050
guy doesn't have an arm.
What is it you wanted me to do?

184
00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.060
And I just hang out and wait and they come in for like a awkward elbow bomb or

185
00:12:07.061 --> 00:12:11.140
something like,
like,
thanks bro.
That was awesome.
It's really cool.

186
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.870
I like how you processed that good work.
What about your grandfather?

187
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.190
He uh,

188
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:23.020
my grandpa for one super smart and I did not inherit those,

189
00:12:23.021 --> 00:12:26.680
uh,
those jeans.
He um,
I mean like super smart.

190
00:12:26.681 --> 00:12:30.170
He was like Valedictorian and engineers like,
you know,
um,

191
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.000
Valedictorian at University of Illinois as an engineer.

192
00:12:34.001 --> 00:12:37.270
I mean he was in with his mindset in,
in the dad.

193
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.720
My Dad was a engineer as well and they really,
you know,

194
00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:43.540
were just great at being able to figure out ways to be able to go and adapt

195
00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:46.580
different things,
you know,
and like the,
the actual tools of,

196
00:12:46.581 --> 00:12:50.230
of what would be helpful problem solvers.
Yeah,
totally man.

197
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.140
I didn't learn to swim,
believe it or not until I was in my thirties.

198
00:12:53.141 --> 00:12:55.810
When did you learn to swim?
I was,
it's funny,

199
00:12:55.811 --> 00:12:59.290
I was on Howard Stern and he called my dad a dick for this,

200
00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.210
but my dad basically put me in the middle of the pool,

201
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:08.470
taught me how to float on my back and as soon as he thought that I was like
good.

202
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:11.140
And I got it.
Then he got out of the pool and he was like,

203
00:13:11.141 --> 00:13:14.070
now figure out how to get out so

204
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.780
we really start crying is straight to the bottom of the pool.
Right.
So it was,

205
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.340
but you know,
Kinda,
yeah.
I was like probably four years old,
something like that.

206
00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:29.020
Three or four.
Wow.
Was the writing,

207
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:33.850
if you had writing,
eating,
swimming,
what was the most difficult of those?

208
00:13:33.851 --> 00:13:38.230
And is there something else that I'm missing aside from asking girls out that

209
00:13:38.231 --> 00:13:42.350
was particularly difficult for you?
The physical stuff was,

210
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.660
was less taxing to kind of like figure out there was any,

211
00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.280
I kind of had this idea,
this belief like I,
you know,

212
00:13:49.281 --> 00:13:53.080
that there would always be a way there'd be some tool driving in particular.

213
00:13:53.081 --> 00:13:55.990
It was a little bit trickier,
you know,
is a little bit older because it was,
um,

214
00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.610
I want to be in,

215
00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.060
in terms of like the adaptations and equipment that I use a lot more sort of

216
00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:04.060
spartan,
right?
Like I want things to be very simple,
very mechanical,

217
00:14:04.061 --> 00:14:07.840
like very little,
a few points of failure.
And um,

218
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:11.380
the first vehicle that this group and amazing group that helps people with

219
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.800
spinal injuries in Atlanta wanted to go and how have me drive as this massive,

220
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:19.570
this massive Ford van.
And it was like this huge thing with like,
um,
it was like,

221
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:24.610
had these touchscreen computers but this back in like 2002 or three.
Right.

222
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:28.570
And so he's like touching me computers and like joystick for the,
you know,
gas,

223
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.240
the brake.
And I'm like,
Oh man,
this is crazy.
Right?

224
00:14:31.241 --> 00:14:35.320
And I'm driving in like tiny lanes and Atlanta rush hour traffic with this like

225
00:14:35.321 --> 00:14:39.220
giant death trap.
Like it was just this tank that's going down,

226
00:14:39.221 --> 00:14:43.150
barely down the highway.
And I'm like,
no,
never again,
I'm not doing that again.

227
00:14:43.151 --> 00:14:46.210
You know,
like not control the leading on the freaking highway.

228
00:14:46.211 --> 00:14:50.610
Like there's no way.
And so I just

229
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.780
<v 3>jack
now,
I mean,</v>

230
00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:00.530
<v 4>yeah,
so they have pedals that drive just a,</v>

231
00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.780
like an SUV and it's just got basically lifted up and extended pedals.

232
00:15:03.781 --> 00:15:06.640
A very simple,
you can pop in my car and drive it and it's like,
ah,

233
00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:09.720
just put your legs underneath it.
And the,
um,
you know,

234
00:15:09.721 --> 00:15:13.110
I'm using my left foot to hit the brake and my right foot to hit the gas and

235
00:15:13.111 --> 00:15:17.400
grab the steering wheel with my arms.
And,
um,
my mountain guide friend actually,

236
00:15:17.401 --> 00:15:20.220
who's done some pretty scary things like climbed Everest and stuff,

237
00:15:20.221 --> 00:15:24.060
so that one of the scariest moments of his life was when he's driving me for the

238
00:15:24.061 --> 00:15:26.310
first time.
And I grabbed my phone to like answer it.

239
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.280
<v 3>I got,
I got to like the Bluetooth thing going now.
So like</v>

240
00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.380
<v 4>I want to talk a little bit about cub scouts</v>

241
00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:42.040
<v 3>just in general.
Just forget all these people.
I want to talk about the cups.</v>

242
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.600
Awesome.
Should I join the,

243
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.630
I read a story about a case.

244
00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.640
<v 4>Can you talk a little bit about your experience?
Yeah,</v>

245
00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.900
I think this is like where I found my,
my environment.

246
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.020
I found my home and you know,
it was like,

247
00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:00.720
like Gimley and Lord of the rings or something,
you know,
I didn't,
I,
uh,

248
00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.480
I mean the sub training environment,
I realized it was like,

249
00:16:03.481 --> 00:16:04.800
this is a great equalizer.

250
00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:09.210
And so we went to this cave in Indiana as in the boy scouts.
I mean,
my dad,

251
00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:11.820
my grandpa were there and um,
you know,

252
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.460
so you got to crawl through these tunnels and then,
you know,
right.

253
00:16:14.461 --> 00:16:18.600
And it's like these tiny wet cave tunnels.
And I was like,
awesome.

254
00:16:18.601 --> 00:16:19.370
Like just sprinted

255
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:23.520
<v 3>past everybody,
right?
Like this is,
I don't know why it's so hard for everyone,
but</v>

256
00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:31.620
<v 4>what drove you to the athletics and what came first?</v>

257
00:16:31.621 --> 00:16:35.220
I guess the street hockey,
was that sort of the first competitive sport?

258
00:16:35.221 --> 00:16:39.400
I don't know.
I didn't,
so the first like a team sport that I played was,
uh,

259
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.720
was football on and then wrestling,
but it was like,
um,

260
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:46.230
I always had this interest in,
in sports.
I was obsessed,
you know,

261
00:16:46.231 --> 00:16:50.520
and had this delusion of like,
you know,
I'd be in the NBA someday or like,

262
00:16:50.521 --> 00:16:52.380
you know,
it'd be like,
uh,
you know,

263
00:16:52.381 --> 00:16:56.100
as big Atlanta Braves fan and like John Smoltz or Greg Maddux,

264
00:16:56.101 --> 00:16:59.220
like throwing fastballs and you know,
change ups and stuff and like,

265
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.280
and I think the really cool thing was,
is that my parents did let me have this,

266
00:17:02.281 --> 00:17:04.950
like,
had this dream.
They didn't like squelch it.

267
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.430
My mom was a little more pragmatic I think.
So when I did go to play football,

268
00:17:08.431 --> 00:17:10.610
you know,
she was telling me that,
you know,
you might be like,

269
00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.160
you might be the water boy and the team,
they're gonna find a place we're in.

270
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.540
In my head,
like I said,
you know,
I want to be a quarterback,

271
00:17:15.541 --> 00:17:17.130
I want to be throwing the spiral touchdowns.

272
00:17:17.131 --> 00:17:21.390
And it was interesting how those dreams they didn't like.
And as you kind of,

273
00:17:21.391 --> 00:17:22.920
I'm sure as you know,
you can relate,
right?

274
00:17:22.921 --> 00:17:24.990
Like the dreams that you may have had at a certain point,

275
00:17:24.991 --> 00:17:27.450
they didn't manifest exactly how you saw them go,

276
00:17:27.451 --> 00:17:31.050
but it set you on this path and this journey that then takes you down another

277
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:35.220
turns and corridors and you go into other directions that you never would have

278
00:17:35.221 --> 00:17:36.054
imagined before.

279
00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:38.843
<v 3>So the</v>

280
00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.120
<v 4>world's strongest team start with 10 pounds,</v>

281
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:46.470
got up to two 10 each arm.
What,
what was that?

282
00:17:46.471 --> 00:17:50.890
The world's strongest team for GNC.
That was bench,
right?
Yeah.
So it was,
um,

283
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.500
basically I was 17,
18 years old.
It was like a,
we just kind of picked like a,

284
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.900
a weight,
240 pounds.
And I just did as many repetitions.

285
00:17:58.901 --> 00:18:02.570
I could sort of like a combine ask kind of situation and um,

286
00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:03.920
ended up at the competition.

287
00:18:03.921 --> 00:18:08.500
So did 23 repetitions of that and weighed about 120 pounds at the time.

288
00:18:08.501 --> 00:18:10.510
That it's just crazy because like I think,

289
00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:13.150
so I opened a gym about eight years ago and,
and you know,

290
00:18:13.151 --> 00:18:17.740
frequently when someone would come into the gym and like talk to me a lot of

291
00:18:17.741 --> 00:18:19.840
times,
or not just me,
but one of our coaches,

292
00:18:19.841 --> 00:18:22.480
they would go and point at somebody doing something amazing and then you would

293
00:18:22.481 --> 00:18:24.960
go and say like,
there's no way it can go and do that.
You know,

294
00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:27.820
I hear that all the time.
That's like,
to me it's like,
you know,

295
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.450
you have no idea where that person started.
You have no idea.

296
00:18:30.451 --> 00:18:34.170
Like the massive amount of failure that went in to being able to go in and get

297
00:18:34.171 --> 00:18:36.570
to that point where then they were doing something awesome.

298
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.280
But the difference was they stuck it out.

299
00:18:38.281 --> 00:18:41.360
They did the work and then that was a result.
So,
yeah.
You know,
it's like,

300
00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:45.670
I think that could go back in time and tell that 10 year old like that was

301
00:18:45.671 --> 00:18:48.800
really struggling like cat someday you'd be able to go in,
you know,

302
00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:52.440
lift that waiter travel world has a speaker or you know,
um,

303
00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.380
had businesses and you know,
Gates and amazing girls or all of that.

304
00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:59.060
It's just different experiences or climbs in the highest peaks in the world.

305
00:18:59.061 --> 00:19:01.840
That like if I could tell that 10 year old that,
you know,

306
00:19:01.841 --> 00:19:05.800
it would almost seem like like a fantasy story.
Yeah.

307
00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:10.120
And I think that in coming back that question that we talked about veterans,

308
00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.370
you know,
and,
and somebody maybe that's a really hard spot,
you know,

309
00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.800
if they could talk to someone 10 or 20 years,
you know,

310
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:22.410
like a version of themselves 10 or 20 years later after they had really faced

311
00:19:22.411 --> 00:19:26.320
some of these fears that I think that they would have their mind blown as to

312
00:19:26.321 --> 00:19:28.070
what they'd be able to achieve.
For sure.

313
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:34.240
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

314
00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.990
<v 4>you mentioned the gym,
which brings us to mind now,
I've already alluded to this.</v>

315
00:19:38.991 --> 00:19:41.570
This is like the red door knob and 6 cents.
So I'll get to my question,

316
00:19:41.571 --> 00:19:45.560
which is Georgia,
why didn't you guys move to Georgia?
It was,

317
00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:49.910
my grandparents moved down and this was I guess what,
sixth grade?
Sixth Grade?

318
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:51.410
Yeah.
Grandparents moved down.

319
00:19:51.411 --> 00:19:54.590
I mean just like we were in Indiana and it's just the,
yeah,
was the,

320
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.050
I mean it was like the snow and like all that,

321
00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.780
it was the best thing that happened I think in,
in,
in doing the moving,

322
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.720
going to Georgia.
But it was also like time,
it felt like the worst,
you know,

323
00:20:03.721 --> 00:20:06.770
it was,
I tried to stage a family today,
Todd.

324
00:20:06.771 --> 00:20:10.140
I like try to like overthrow my dad and go back to Indiana.

325
00:20:10.141 --> 00:20:13.300
I know it was like I just,
I noticed that a lot,
you know,

326
00:20:13.301 --> 00:20:18.301
now kind of get to sort of quasi mentor and help a lot of different kids with

327
00:20:18.321 --> 00:20:22.940
disabilities and in,
I noticed that those transitory periods,

328
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:27.050
anytime like where there's a major transition in someone's life,
um,

329
00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.330
with a move are going,

330
00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.890
say you're going from middle school to high school or high school to college or

331
00:20:30.891 --> 00:20:35.480
college to you,
like the,
you know,
the world,
then it's,

332
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:40.250
it's those periods of transition that are the most difficult and cause it's like

333
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:42.890
my friends in Indiana saw me is Kyle,

334
00:20:42.891 --> 00:20:46.790
it's Omni as normal and now I've got to go in like Rhea climatized an entire new

335
00:20:46.791 --> 00:20:50.650
group of people in Georgia.
Yeah.
How,
how did you,

336
00:20:50.651 --> 00:20:54.430
I mean I imagine the sports is a huge tool in the toolkit for that,
right?

337
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:58.600
I mean in job rake a few dozen people,
they're like,

338
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:00.730
I'm going cows,

339
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.590
<v 5>bodies everywhere.
It's like a war movie.</v>

340
00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.390
<v 4>Don't mess with that.
You better be a spray.
Like so what,</v>

341
00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:12.510
what helped you in that transition?
Aside from the sports?
I mean,

342
00:21:12.511 --> 00:21:15.960
what was the self talk or what did your parents or grandparents say to you?

343
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:22.830
I think they were,
they were very much my mom,
especially trying to constantly,

344
00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:26.040
you know,
she was,
she's like a big,

345
00:21:26.041 --> 00:21:28.530
she used to always talk about like psychosis and headaches,
you know,

346
00:21:28.531 --> 00:21:29.670
and all this stuff.
Right.
She's like,

347
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:34.470
she knew she would just talk about kind of mind over matter and like just be

348
00:21:34.471 --> 00:21:37.230
drilling things in.
I had,
it's like focusing on the positive and all that.

349
00:21:37.231 --> 00:21:41.250
So it was really,
I'm super glad that she,
she had that perspective.
Um,

350
00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.230
but you know,
it wasn't always the case,
but my mind didn't know.

351
00:21:44.231 --> 00:21:47.880
He's obviously go there and differently.

352
00:21:47.881 --> 00:21:51.750
Probably the one of the most difficult transitions that I faced was going from

353
00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:54.750
[inaudible] as a freshman in the University of Georgia and write a book.

354
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:58.320
And as you know,
when you go and launch a book,
then it's like,

355
00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:01.170
it changes your life pretty dramatically.
And you know,

356
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:05.130
the whole book to her and all this stuff got to be on Oprah and Larry King when

357
00:22:05.131 --> 00:22:05.970
I was 19.

358
00:22:05.971 --> 00:22:08.630
And it was like just like went from being a full time college student to full

359
00:22:08.631 --> 00:22:10.140
time business traveler overnight.

360
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:13.830
And in my community people knew me and they knew,
you know,

361
00:22:13.831 --> 00:22:17.790
not that I like the disability and stuff like that wasn't as,
you know,

362
00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.370
they didn't make it that big of an issue.
Who would it be gone and traveling,

363
00:22:20.371 --> 00:22:24.150
especially when I was traveling by myself than many people looked at me very

364
00:22:24.151 --> 00:22:27.090
differently and you know,
of course they want to help and things like that.

365
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:31.080
And I've had some pretty hilarious events where it was like,

366
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.130
for sure I've learned that one in my,

367
00:22:33.131 --> 00:22:35.850
like bigger challenges was like accepting help.

368
00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:39.570
But there were some times where I knew that it would just be better and easier

369
00:22:39.571 --> 00:22:41.850
if I like whatever it was,
did it on my own.
Right.
Yeah.

370
00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:47.330
One time I'm in the New York airport and the RDA was a really super steep jetway

371
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.070
and um,
this guy,

372
00:22:50.071 --> 00:22:53.640
and I get a little bit of an argument where he tells me he works at the airport

373
00:22:53.641 --> 00:22:57.700
and he's telling me he has to push my wheelchair down this jetway.
I'm like,
Nah,

374
00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.960
it's,
I'd be better.
You know better if I did it.
And he's like,
no,
I have to,

375
00:23:00.961 --> 00:23:03.450
it's liability.
I'm like,
we go back and forth,
finally give in.

376
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.990
But this guy was like the tallest human being I've ever seen,
literally.

377
00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.770
And he goes and takes about three steps down the jet way and he gets his foot

378
00:23:10.771 --> 00:23:13.260
caught in the back of my wheelchair and he goes down.

379
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.810
So he doesn't just like let go.

380
00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:20.940
He just launched me down and like I'm sped up and I can see that people have

381
00:23:22.981 --> 00:23:24.390
their eyes at the bottom like,
this is it.

382
00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.273
<v 5>He is.</v>

383
00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.820
<v 4>And I tried to grab the wall to slow myself down and it was like this big streak</v>

384
00:23:31.821 --> 00:23:35.570
of blood came down.
This is big CSI crime scene.
And I'm like,
wow.

385
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:37.100
And I hit the bottom of the,
you know,

386
00:23:37.101 --> 00:23:39.380
we're happening all of that and like flipped out.
Sharon,

387
00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.310
I just laughing hysterically when I'd survived.
They like,

388
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:49.560
you're like good liability coverage.
I was like,
dude,
just,

389
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:54.800
it's all good.
Never ever helped me again.
Stop helping me.

390
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:02.630
My coach used to stay after and practice and he would literally tuck his arms

391
00:24:02.631 --> 00:24:05.420
into his sleeves and wrestle for my perspective.

392
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:08.990
No and try to for hours like just trying to figure out moves they could go and

393
00:24:08.991 --> 00:24:12.800
do.
I think a lot of times too,
we look at things and we forget like you know,

394
00:24:12.801 --> 00:24:15.770
we look at one person that's achieved something great and we're like,
oh man,

395
00:24:15.771 --> 00:24:19.730
that one,
that,
that person.
Right.
And we don't see the massive amount of people,

396
00:24:19.731 --> 00:24:24.110
the hundreds of people or thousands of people that have poured their life into

397
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.600
like trying to help that person.
Yeah,
for sure.

398
00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:29.630
I read an essay by Arnold Schwartz and I recently,

399
00:24:29.631 --> 00:24:32.930
which was I am not a self made man and he basically made the same point.

400
00:24:32.931 --> 00:24:35.750
It's like people ask me all the time as a self made man ball,
but he's like,

401
00:24:35.751 --> 00:24:38.360
let me stop you right there because you don't see these,

402
00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.120
all of these other people,
all the other inputs,

403
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:47.030
Jujitsu come into the picture first or opening of the gym.

404
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:51.680
That shit's you came in because I saw some Gracie videos and I was like,

405
00:24:51.681 --> 00:24:53.610
I want to try this.
Gracie.

406
00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.500
They had those products and Gracie's and action and the footage of the Cheetahs

407
00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:58.363
catching know

408
00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:05.130
VHS nineties it was like 80 [inaudible] early days like man.

409
00:25:08.181 --> 00:25:11.520
But yeah,
so I mean like that saw those videos and I was like whoa.
Like,

410
00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:15.350
like even another human's able to do this to another human like I have to learn.

411
00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:20.860
And I went in and I got choked out by a girl and I was like super quick to she

412
00:25:21.291 --> 00:25:24.470
triangle choke me,
slapped it on.
I was like out,
you know,

413
00:25:24.471 --> 00:25:28.520
and I was like wrestling club level but still like preparing to go to the

414
00:25:28.521 --> 00:25:33.250
nationals in good shape.
Wrestlers love triangles,
worst,

415
00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.140
you know,
she sees all the bad habits like,
Oh God,

416
00:25:36.141 --> 00:25:38.900
I really want to demo a triangle choke now,
but we'll,
we're going to save that.

417
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:43.390
We just got our heads and we just got done.
Uh,

418
00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:48.610
so the Jujitsu,
I need to do that to another human being choked people.
Yes.

419
00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.950
Must do that.
I saw her,
this chick do this to this guy who was this girl,
what?

420
00:25:51.951 --> 00:25:54.530
She did it to a guy that was like 200 pounds next day.
And I was like,

421
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.740
how could this,
how could this be,
you know,
did the Jujitsu then,

422
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:03.000
did you get bitten by that bug before opening the gym or was it concurrently?

423
00:26:03.001 --> 00:26:05.710
What was the timeline on that?
There's a little bit before I,

424
00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.550
but had been training for a few years and then,
um,
you know,

425
00:26:08.551 --> 00:26:11.580
open the gym and actually chose to pursue a fight in MMA.

426
00:26:11.581 --> 00:26:16.140
And like within a couple of months.
I mean,
it was like fast.
And so we,
um,

427
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:20.640
I had tried to do an MMA fight before in 2007 and got denied.

428
00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:26.250
And so the state wouldn't commission other or the Athletic Commission wouldn't

429
00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:30.460
sanction it.
Yeah.
It was the head commissioner.
He's in wheelchair actually.

430
00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.071
He told me,

431
00:26:31.071 --> 00:26:33.710
I think this is amazing what you're doing here for people with disabilities and

432
00:26:33.711 --> 00:26:35.830
we support you doing this.
And then,
uh,

433
00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.360
at a commission meeting when won't be a problem to get your license as an

434
00:26:39.361 --> 00:26:43.320
amateur fight and Georgia and then like a couple of weeks before the fight,
like,

435
00:26:43.321 --> 00:26:45.300
I don't know if there's a big outcry and the Internet,

436
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:49.110
a lot of people had opinions about things and said some pretty gnarly stuff.

437
00:26:49.111 --> 00:26:51.630
And I mean,
my sisters were like crying,
reading some of this stuff,
you know,

438
00:26:51.631 --> 00:26:54.300
people saying,
you know,
Kyle's a limbless freak show,

439
00:26:54.301 --> 00:26:58.020
get doing this to get back on TV and come take a chainsaw and cut off my arms,

440
00:26:58.021 --> 00:27:02.160
legs so I can get on TV too.
You know,
like the superclass of Youtube comments.

441
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.130
Right.
And so,
yeah,
it was,

442
00:27:05.131 --> 00:27:07.830
and it was kind of my first time doing something that was very polarizing like

443
00:27:07.831 --> 00:27:09.890
that.
And,
um,
it was a,

444
00:27:09.891 --> 00:27:12.820
it was a unique experience and it was also coupled around my credit when the

445
00:27:12.821 --> 00:27:16.330
time I had just opened the gyms and training for the fight,
uh,
you know,

446
00:27:16.331 --> 00:27:19.540
and like some nights like sleeping in the gym,
I mean had opened,

447
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:23.440
opened it up and it was like coaching all the classes and I'm like the CEO,

448
00:27:23.441 --> 00:27:26.320
I'm also the janitor,
you know,
somebody like goes in peaks during the workout.

449
00:27:26.321 --> 00:27:28.780
I've got to go clean the toilets,
like,
you know,
so we kind of,

450
00:27:28.781 --> 00:27:30.700
I mean all of those things are going on simultaneously,

451
00:27:30.701 --> 00:27:32.290
trying to go and prepare for this fight,

452
00:27:32.291 --> 00:27:35.100
which is like one of the biggest events in my life.
And um,

453
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.620
it was a wild experience,
but it looked back in that.
It was,
it was amazing.

454
00:27:38.621 --> 00:27:41.390
Some of my,
my best friend is actually some of them.
One of them is here,

455
00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:44.500
was a director of,
uh,
we produced documentary on it,

456
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:48.210
ESPN bought and then now it's on Netflix.
But it's does an amazing journey.

457
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.240
What's the doc called?
It's called a fighting chance.
Fudge.
Yeah.

458
00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:54.600
<v 3>So that was your first time sort of being thrown into the Internet,
Wolf,</v>

459
00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:00.690
you know,
thing or they're hungry.
Oh,
I do know a thing about that.

460
00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:04.570
What did you learn from that?
Would you take away from that?
That can be,

461
00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.610
I mean it is a really no matter what a really difficult experience.

462
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:11.450
But you also then,
I mean you have your family reading these things.

463
00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:15.200
What did you learn from that?
Or actually,

464
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.900
and I could phrase it a different way and you can tackle it however you'd like.

465
00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:23.210
If you were to give yourself advice just before getting into that situation,

466
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:24.600
what would you have said?

467
00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.030
<v 4>Have compassion for him.</v>

468
00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:31.080
Have some empathy for them and understand that like,
uh,
even,
you know,

469
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:35.730
all they're doing is they're projecting my capabilities based on their own

470
00:28:35.731 --> 00:28:40.080
experiences and,
and imagining like if I were in Kyle shoes,
then of course,

471
00:28:40.081 --> 00:28:42.750
you know,
like whatever,
then I won't be able to go do it,
do this or that.

472
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:44.490
And if you don't have any experience,

473
00:28:44.491 --> 00:28:46.260
like if I've never trained with you or whatever,

474
00:28:46.261 --> 00:28:49.710
then it would make sense that guy going into a fight.
You know,

475
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.500
punching and kicking is loud,
you know,
choking is loud.

476
00:28:52.501 --> 00:28:57.140
All of that stuff it's like seems like crazy and ridiculous until,
um,

477
00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:00.960
if we trained together I can change your perspective.
Right.
Then it's like,

478
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:04.350
so they didn't,
you know,

479
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.670
in their map of the world and their understanding then it was like,
I get it.

480
00:29:08.671 --> 00:29:12.060
It makes perfect sense.
And at the same time in the cage,

481
00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:15.690
I got to sit in there and be the first time in their looking out,

482
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:19.980
not as a spectator but as a participant.
And it was like such a cool view man.

483
00:29:19.981 --> 00:29:20.850
It was like,
wow,

484
00:29:20.851 --> 00:29:25.800
like 99.99% of the people that said those things would never have that view

485
00:29:25.801 --> 00:29:30.801
because they're so busy talking shit that they don't live their life to then

486
00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:38.400
have that experience.
And I know there's,
um,
I'm a Teddy Roosevelt thing,

487
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:41.560
uh,
a quote from a speech that he gave,

488
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:45.870
but this excerpt is called man in the arena and that I,

489
00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.960
I really encourage everyone here.

490
00:29:47.961 --> 00:29:51.790
I mean to go in and check that out made a huge impact on me,
man of the arena.

491
00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.710
Definitely check it out.
You know what?
I also,

492
00:29:53.711 --> 00:29:56.290
because I was in the middle of getting dragged through the mud at one point for

493
00:29:56.291 --> 00:29:58.900
some like minor infraction on the universe.
I don't remember what it was,

494
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.280
but just like getting stoned to death on the Internet by some like minor

495
00:30:03.281 --> 00:30:07.790
contingent of rabble rousers and I was just really down on myself and I watched

496
00:30:07.791 --> 00:30:12.791
the Ratatouille Anton Ego review at the end.

497
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.200
I'm going to probably take us back on track but check it out.
That's awesome.

498
00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:23.230
When you're in the Roosevelt and Teddy Roosevelt and Ratatouille into the

499
00:30:23.231 --> 00:30:26.800
picture,
but men in the arena for sure a must read,

500
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:29.470
you're in the octagon or the cage,

501
00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:33.310
what was going through your head as you enter,

502
00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.880
whatever stands out in your memory when you're warming up and like getting
ready,

503
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:41.620
going towards it or getting in it.
Like what?
What's going through your mind?
I,

504
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.090
so I started before this,

505
00:30:43.091 --> 00:30:48.010
like I used to like in wrestling I had overwhelming like competitive,

506
00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:51.520
like you know,
anxiety and like pre match anxiety.

507
00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.440
Like I would be overtaken by it like it was.

508
00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.610
And to the point where I eventually want to do to know nothing about my

509
00:30:57.611 --> 00:30:58.031
opponents.

510
00:30:58.031 --> 00:31:01.150
And I remember like I beat a kid that was like super tough and you know,

511
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:02.860
it was like afterwards my coach was like,

512
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:06.310
did you know he was like a two time state champ and if I had known going into it

513
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:07.323
I probably would've lost.

514
00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:12.660
So really going in this fight I did so much like visualization and you know,

515
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.500
it sounds kind of like woo,
but it was like so much visualization.

516
00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:21.410
Then I think kind of like,
I felt like I told my,
my instructor,
my uh,

517
00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.360
my Paul greatness is named my Jujitsu coach at the time.
I told him,
I was like,

518
00:31:25.361 --> 00:31:27.400
I feel like I've been here like 10 times.

519
00:31:27.401 --> 00:31:31.000
Like this is like my 10th or 12th fight because I had visualized it so much.

520
00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.500
Then when I finally got there,

521
00:31:32.501 --> 00:31:35.050
I was able to be calm enough to be able to enjoy that moment,

522
00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:39.880
what happened to foot.
So it wasn't the most exciting thing in the world.
My,

523
00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:43.060
my goal,
my strategy,
I wanted to go and cut the cage corners off to be able to,

524
00:31:43.061 --> 00:31:45.730
it was a square cage that we're finding in and wanting to be able to go and then

525
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.210
work the angles then hit most angle or whatever it was to be able to go and

526
00:31:49.211 --> 00:31:50.620
drive him against the cage and take them down.

527
00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:53.740
I'm not much a kickboxer if you can imagine.

528
00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:58.120
And so a lot of it in the first round is kind of beating him towards to come to

529
00:31:58.121 --> 00:32:02.800
me and um,
kind of uneventful.
But by the second,
second round I was like,

530
00:32:02.801 --> 00:32:05.740
press the action and pressing him,
trying to cut the corners and all that.

531
00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.960
Didn't get him down and ate and just jabs.

532
00:32:07.961 --> 00:32:10.690
Probably the hardest shot eight was maybe in the second round.

533
00:32:10.691 --> 00:32:15.040
And then in the third round I was like,
screw this reckless abandon.

534
00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:19.930
I'm just chasing this guy as hard and fast as I can,
like 90 seconds.

535
00:32:19.931 --> 00:32:23.080
And then they,
even the announcers like,
uh,
the guy who thought it was like,
well,

536
00:32:23.081 --> 00:32:24.520
this guy's on his treadmill now.
Like,

537
00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:28.150
I was like more of a track of it and it was an MMA fight and I'm like,

538
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:30.730
but you know,
I'm going to go out there.
And then eventually I was like,

539
00:32:30.731 --> 00:32:32.050
screw this.
Like you,
you know,

540
00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:35.470
if he's not going to come in and engage then like I'm going to force the action.

541
00:32:35.471 --> 00:32:38.430
I went and laid in the middle of the cage on my back and um,

542
00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.260
he came and just crushing me on the liver and I was like,
Ooh,
bad idea.

543
00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.990
<v 3>Get back up.
Plan B,
Plan B.
But you know,
and the,</v>

544
00:32:46.991 --> 00:32:48.460
in the Internet,
it was funny,
it was like

545
00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:49.930
<v 4>so many people said like,
oh,</v>

546
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:54.850
<v 3>Kyle's definitely going to die.
Definitely gonna die.</v>

547
00:32:54.851 --> 00:32:58.090
I gotta turn on the TV.
It's going to be the first televised death,
you know?

548
00:32:58.091 --> 00:33:02.020
It was like my other is that I was trained with Forrest Griffin at the time,

549
00:33:02.021 --> 00:33:05.680
so my other training partners for us,
it was before he was going to fight Shogun,

550
00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.680
who's like legendary MMA fighter and they were like,

551
00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:11.860
Forrest is definitely at a diag and Shogun.
He ended up beating them,

552
00:33:11.861 --> 00:33:15.010
but it was like,
Forrest is going to die,
Kyle's going to die.
This is like,

553
00:33:15.011 --> 00:33:19.540
this camp's gonna provide the first two in the May deaths like,
you know,

554
00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:23.560
but was whatever.
I didn't die unless I did and it just is actually,

555
00:33:23.561 --> 00:33:26.370
this is the afterlife,
who knows?
You know,

556
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:27.560
I didn't want to have to be the one to tell him

557
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.020
lock where there's going to be private conference,
but

558
00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:38.730
they just,
the,
the training for public exposure,
the fight itself,

559
00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:43.970
<v 4>by far the most valuable thing is that it's okay to have people pissed off at me</v>

560
00:33:44.431 --> 00:33:49.431
or like mad at me or saying things about me and like whatever it,

561
00:33:49.681 --> 00:33:52.050
and so I was like,
okay,
I get hurt.

562
00:33:52.051 --> 00:33:53.750
At first it was like a read that and I was like,
write all this stuff.

563
00:33:53.751 --> 00:33:56.100
And I was like,
man,
I don't want to say that.
They didn't frustrate me.

564
00:33:56.430 --> 00:34:00.150
And I remember like I wrote this post on the underground and all that stuff and

565
00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.740
it was just like got buried and nobody even know

566
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:04.780
<v 3>applied to it.
It was like this whole wave just kind of kept going.</v>

567
00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.440
<v 4>People talking about stuff that was out of my control and I was like,</v>

568
00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.380
they don't know.
I want to go and show them and all that.
And I'm finally like,

569
00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:12.090
you know,
I think after,
after it was done,

570
00:34:12.091 --> 00:34:15.340
I was like new experience of it was like screw that.
Like I don't,

571
00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:18.030
I don't need to convince everyone.
Right.
You know,

572
00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:22.080
there's plenty of people that I don't need to go in and convince.
Yeah.

573
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:27.420
I mean there's,
it's just we all walk around with this idea and myself included,

574
00:34:27.421 --> 00:34:28.201
we all do it right.

575
00:34:28.201 --> 00:34:31.560
But I try to remind myself all the time that I don't have a freaking clue what

576
00:34:31.561 --> 00:34:35.520
reality is.
I don't know.
Right.
I don't know.
And I want to be out in the world,

577
00:34:35.521 --> 00:34:39.270
like cone kind of figure that out and just give up my assumptions and beliefs

578
00:34:39.271 --> 00:34:41.850
and whatever those things are and not be tied to any one thing.

579
00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.970
And we go and see stuff right now with like the election too and like how

580
00:34:44.971 --> 00:34:48.600
polarized and everybody gets and we go and get so gripped to like these beliefs

581
00:34:48.601 --> 00:34:52.470
on one side or another and it's not that one side or the other is better.

582
00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.510
To me it's,
it's both the same thing.

583
00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:59.430
It's like we have to sometimes be able to go and see that like it's just,

584
00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:01.080
it's just our own perception.

585
00:35:01.081 --> 00:35:04.710
It's just around percent is nothing to do with reality.
Well,
you also mentioned

586
00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:06.250
<v 3>in a way,
I mean something,</v>

587
00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.920
a piece of advice that was given to me at one point when I was getting very

588
00:35:08.921 --> 00:35:11.110
frustrated and it was not about the people who don't get it.

589
00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.600
It's about the people who do get it.
Yeah.

590
00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:18.170
Don't worry about the first group and everybody has to read man.

591
00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.230
In the arena,
it is very important reading.

592
00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.720
It goes well with the serenity prayer and I'm not a religious guy,

593
00:35:22.721 --> 00:35:24.070
but they actually go really well together.

594
00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:29.410
What habits do you have?
Practices,

595
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:32.270
routines,
traditions,

596
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:36.590
anything to keep yourself positive because you're one of,

597
00:35:36.591 --> 00:35:38.010
at least in interactions,
one of the most

598
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:43.010
<v 4>consistently positive and enabling people for other folks.</v>

599
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.093
Right.

600
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:49.950
Do you keep that going or like what are things that you find help to develop

601
00:35:50.701 --> 00:35:52.620
that or maintain it?
It's,
for me,

602
00:35:52.621 --> 00:35:57.570
it's like I have to have those things.
It's like going to the gym.

603
00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:00.090
It's like,
it's not,
you read one book and you're done.

604
00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.410
It's not anything like that.

605
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.470
I think that right now that's probably the biggest thing that I'm struggling

606
00:36:04.471 --> 00:36:09.060
with in my life.
You know,
I travel close to 200 days a year and I'm like,
just,

607
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:11.610
you know,
just beat up by that and like,
you know,
it's,
so,

608
00:36:11.611 --> 00:36:15.360
it's different all the time and that sort of your routine and structure is,

609
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:19.020
it's definitely something that I've wanted to have more kind of consistency,

610
00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:19.321
you know?

611
00:36:19.321 --> 00:36:22.290
And I think that now I'm taking the actions towards creating that in my life.

612
00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:26.130
I would say the one thing that makes a difference for me is I'm actually like,

613
00:36:26.131 --> 00:36:30.620
I can,
I can fake extroversion.
Well,
but I'm not,
listen,
yeah,

614
00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.730
I'll need,
well I won't get it,

615
00:36:32.731 --> 00:36:36.810
but I'll need like 20 hours of sleep I go to like fortunately not in the cards

616
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.290
but these,
you know,

617
00:36:38.291 --> 00:36:40.680
and sometimes he'd get up and you do it anyway even when you don't feel like

618
00:36:40.681 --> 00:36:43.560
doing it.
Yeah.
And that's the thing,
the difference with like a performer,

619
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:46.200
like someone that's a high performing that you have to do it right even when you

620
00:36:46.201 --> 00:36:46.801
don't feel like it.

621
00:36:46.801 --> 00:36:50.490
But there are plenty of times when I'm at speeches and stuff like that where,

622
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:54.450
you know,
don't you know,
I don't feel like giving a speech that day.

623
00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:57.720
They get up and do it anyway.
And it's,
it's really a lot of it.

624
00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:02.250
The biggest habit I think that I've been conscious of lately,

625
00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.340
you know,
there's so much discussion and I've,
I've kind of,

626
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:09.360
I talk about this in the speech is too,
but it's like this like the idea of why,

627
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:11.850
right.
That's a big,
that's a big discussion.

628
00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:16.530
I think the missing link that we have with that is there are like hundreds of

629
00:37:16.531 --> 00:37:20.520
why's that are occurring simultaneously for any given moment of why you're going

630
00:37:20.521 --> 00:37:23.790
to go and do anything.
Maybe thousands,
but at least hundreds.

631
00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:28.080
I mean right now you could come up with like a hundred wise on the spot,

632
00:37:28.081 --> 00:37:28.411
you know,

633
00:37:28.411 --> 00:37:31.860
if you had 10 minutes to think about it of like why you're doing this TV show

634
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:34.320
and not to have like judgment over those things.

635
00:37:34.321 --> 00:37:35.520
Some things might be business related,

636
00:37:35.521 --> 00:37:37.940
some things might be making an impact on people and they'll all,
you know,
it's,

637
00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:42.090
it might be just so many different inner things connected with that.

638
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:43.200
And it really,

639
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:47.430
what I've noticed is that's okay and I get to go.

640
00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:51.420
And then at that point kind of select what is the one that's going to be the

641
00:37:51.421 --> 00:37:54.900
most empowering place to come from with this.
In this example,
you know,

642
00:37:54.901 --> 00:37:58.500
I was a young entrepreneur and reading your books and like,
you know,

643
00:37:58.501 --> 00:37:59.730
looking up to you and like,

644
00:37:59.731 --> 00:38:03.180
so if I come at it from this perspective of like one of the wise of me being

645
00:38:03.181 --> 00:38:05.520
here,
we'd be like,
oh I want to do a good job for 10 right?

646
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:07.470
But like that's not the most empowering.
Why?

647
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:11.190
I mean that can be part of it and you can coexist with the fact that like there

648
00:38:11.191 --> 00:38:14.070
may be some people in this room right now they're struggling with things that

649
00:38:14.071 --> 00:38:16.740
are way more difficult than anything you or I have ever faced.

650
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.660
And if one thing that either you or I could go and say could make one bit of

651
00:38:21.661 --> 00:38:24.090
difference with that person or people,

652
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:28.800
then that to me matters way more than anything else.
And I know that the,

653
00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:32.030
you know,
all the other stuff of like,
you know,

654
00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:36.240
look good on TV or like do a good job for 10 like that would be taken care of
is,

655
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:40.630
you know,
doesn't even matter.
But like if my awareness is there,

656
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:41.583
that's what matters.

657
00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:47.290
And so many instances I had been profoundly impacted by,

658
00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:50.820
by veterans that were also in some really rough spots.

659
00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:52.900
Like I desperately wanted to serve.

660
00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:55.930
I mean I wanted to go when nine 11 happened and you know,

661
00:38:56.410 --> 00:39:00.190
we saw the planes go in the towers.
I was like,
I want to go bad,
you know,

662
00:39:00.191 --> 00:39:04.780
sin me and would have done anything to go.
And um,
you know,

663
00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:09.110
it was a high school,
right?
It stops throwing and all that.
[inaudible] okay.

664
00:39:09.111 --> 00:39:12.340
So many friends that are in the military now,
some of my closest friends,

665
00:39:12.341 --> 00:39:15.190
active duty,
some retired,
some injured,

666
00:39:15.191 --> 00:39:18.760
some not anybody that's ever put on that uniform.

667
00:39:18.761 --> 00:39:20.410
I have a tremendous respect for

668
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:26.010
<v 0>and [inaudible] but</v>

669
00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:33.690
<v 4>on several instances and times where I've been feeling sorry for myself,</v>

670
00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:39.360
you know,
and I mean,
I hate this word,
but motivational speaker high,

671
00:39:39.361 --> 00:39:42.480
like they are motivational speakers or whatever.
They had the bad days too.
Right.

672
00:39:42.481 --> 00:39:46.130
And you had moments where,
yeah,
I feel like motivating,
but then like I go in,

673
00:39:46.131 --> 00:39:48.280
I meet some veterans and you know,

674
00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:51.410
and just have these powerful experiences and things that like just,

675
00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:54.210
just really reshaped the way they go and think about stuff.

676
00:39:54.211 --> 00:39:57.130
I remember I was just sharing with,
um,
with some friends today about like,

677
00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.590
you know,
I went in a couple of years ago,

678
00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:03.480
it was a trip just back to Walter Reed and got to have to go and visit.
Uh,

679
00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:05.630
we actually played the documentary fighting chance.

680
00:40:05.631 --> 00:40:10.631
So we had to viewing at Walter Reed and spent about an hour in this hospital

681
00:40:11.951 --> 00:40:16.180
room with this,
this one kid who had recently been been blown up pretty bad,

682
00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:22.170
1920 years old.
And he was sitting there with his dad and they said,
um,
you know,

683
00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:25.880
I mean,
it was fairly recent that it happened and that when he,
I was like,

684
00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:30.190
invited him to come down and watch the movie with me.
And,
um,
you know,

685
00:40:30.191 --> 00:40:32.140
we had maybe intimate kind of thing,

686
00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:37.360
30 or 40 people in this room watching the film and like,
um,
you know,

687
00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:40.270
and seeing their reactions to when the people would go and say the things that

688
00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:42.950
they said about me and then I may fight.
It was like PowerPoint.

689
00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:47.850
I mean there were like some of them want to strap up and show after those guys.

690
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:52.320
I'm like,
well you guys need to chill the,
you know,

691
00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:53.111
so this one kid,

692
00:40:53.111 --> 00:40:56.560
I remember at 15 minutes after the movie started in like he came,

693
00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:00.070
he was in his chair and he'd been blown up really,

694
00:41:00.071 --> 00:41:03.710
really high and it lost both legs and like almost,
you know,

695
00:41:03.711 --> 00:41:06.310
where it was really high and they said that that was like one of the first times

696
00:41:06.311 --> 00:41:07.500
that you got to come out of his room.

697
00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:09.380
<v 0>Mike,</v>

698
00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.070
<v 4>the first time that he'd come out of this room maybe like,
uh,</v>

699
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:14.500
maybe like one of the first times ever since you've been there.
And

700
00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.150
<v 0>okay.</v>

701
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.983
<v 4>Stuff like that,
man.</v>

702
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:21.990
It's like it put a different feeling and perspective on it cause it was like it

703
00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:27.280
took away the,
this idea that like I needed to go and serve with a rifle that,

704
00:41:27.281 --> 00:41:27.551
you know,

705
00:41:27.551 --> 00:41:30.700
but there would be ways that I could go and serve in other ways now and I'm

706
00:41:30.701 --> 00:41:34.780
still [inaudible]
you know,

707
00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:38.740
every fiber of my being and want to go in and find ways to go in and help those

708
00:41:38.741 --> 00:41:40.660
that have been over there to defend us.

709
00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:44.360
<v 3>This is from Ryan Minnick</v>

710
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:48.250
<v 4>no excuses because your book was published a decade ago.</v>

711
00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:52.810
Is there anything about the book that you wish you could revise and I would just

712
00:41:52.811 --> 00:41:56.070
tag onto that or add or remove for that matter.
Is there anything you'd change?

713
00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:57.270
Man,
I don't think we have time

714
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:58.263
<v 3>for that.</v>

715
00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:01.890
<v 4>I mean really like I think a big,</v>

716
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:05.550
I can answer that and summarize that with it's a perfect snapshot in time of who

717
00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.970
I,
who Kyle Maynard was at 19 years old and you know,
it's,

718
00:42:08.971 --> 00:42:10.800
it's not something,
you know,

719
00:42:10.801 --> 00:42:15.801
at a big weakness that I've had and it kind of sec talk in a connected to what

720
00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.100
you'd say that even like why speaking,
right.
Why am I doing that?
Well,

721
00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:21.390
a lot of it frankly is,

722
00:42:21.391 --> 00:42:24.960
I don't have a good answer for that because of what it's always done in many

723
00:42:24.961 --> 00:42:25.794
regards.

724
00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:30.600
I think that the struggle sometimes that I have now is,

725
00:42:30.601 --> 00:42:35.601
is that someone will read my book and have me come in and speak to their group

726
00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:40.380
and that's awesome.
But it's also like their map of who Kyle was.

727
00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:44.740
His is like the 19 year old version.
And like,
I'm like my,

728
00:42:44.741 --> 00:42:46.200
not even talk about wrestling.
Right.

729
00:42:46.201 --> 00:42:50.310
It's like there's a lot of other stuff to talk about.
So yeah.

730
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:54.940
Do you have plans to write more books?
I do.
And I mean,
I,
you know,

731
00:42:54.941 --> 00:42:58.210
I can't give you a BS excuses to why I have it.
No,
it's true.

732
00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:00.550
I think that the big reason in why I have it,

733
00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:04.870
I'm kind of glad that I had pain and writing is always my total actually kind of

734
00:43:04.871 --> 00:43:08.090
see some of your posts.
I'm like,
that doesn't sound like a lot of fun.
No,

735
00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:12.650
but it's,
it takes a lot out of you.
And at the same time I'm like,
you know,

736
00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:16.190
a book is a very permanent sort of medium.
You know,
I don't,

737
00:43:16.191 --> 00:43:20.210
I don't know if I'm someday if I'll have kids or not.
I have a niece and nephew,

738
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:22.670
you know,
and some need,
they'll have kids and all that.
Right.

739
00:43:22.671 --> 00:43:26.240
And their kids until like way after I'm gone.
And when after you're gone,

740
00:43:26.241 --> 00:43:29.720
those books will still be around is sort of a way to for people to know who you

741
00:43:29.721 --> 00:43:30.470
were.

742
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:32.810
<v 3>Yeah.
I always tell people and they're like,
yeah,
I really want to write a book.</v>

743
00:43:32.811 --> 00:43:34.370
Like maybe my spare time and I'm like

744
00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:41.640
a mediocre book is more of a liability than a help.
Trust me.

745
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:43.380
Can't pull that one back.

746
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.620
Kept with the toothpaste back in the toothpaste tube on that.

747
00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.030
It's a really messy operation.
And it's not going to work.

748
00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:57.900
<v 4>When you are traveling,
what does workout look like for you?
The,
the,</v>

749
00:43:57.950 --> 00:44:01.930
the pain cave.
Yeah.
How do you create that on the road?
I try to,
I mean,

750
00:44:01.931 --> 00:44:03.480
I know that just with my body alone,

751
00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:05.560
I can go in and make a lot of different things happen,

752
00:44:05.561 --> 00:44:07.180
different bodyweight things and you know,

753
00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:10.300
I mean if I have one dumbbell or something like that,
I can go and use it.

754
00:44:10.301 --> 00:44:12.790
It helps for me to have like a little bit of a mat or something like that.

755
00:44:12.791 --> 00:44:15.340
Kind of Yoga Mat or something that brace off of.

756
00:44:15.341 --> 00:44:19.280
But generally there's some form of eating,
like any type of object,
right?
Like,

757
00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:20.170
you know,

758
00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:23.110
if I need to pick up this chair and go and move it around and really fast and a

759
00:44:23.111 --> 00:44:25.880
bunch,
it might look really weird for anybody that comes in on that.
But like,

760
00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:30.850
<v 3>you know,
it's like,
I'm just imagining the cleaning lady,
right?</v>

761
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.880
What is happening right now?
Am I on drugs?
Like total?

762
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:36.240
I know I gotta get out of here.
This guy,

763
00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:40.860
this guy's definitely definitely on drugs.
I don't want whatever he's got,

764
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:42.750
not just making a move.
A bunch of chairs everywhere.

765
00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:45.570
Worst recreational trip ever.

766
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:52.040
<v 4>If you had to give a Ted talk on something that you are not known for,</v>

767
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:57.030
do you have any pet obsessions things you geek out on that uh,

768
00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:01.170
the present on Amy,
it's a little bit different,
but I would say it's,

769
00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:04.190
I probably give a Ted talk on parenting,

770
00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:09.380
but not from like,
I mean I'm the kids,
right?
So like who am I to talk on that?

771
00:45:09.381 --> 00:45:13.940
But like,
so seeing my,
uh,
my sister as a parent is really special.

772
00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:18.080
My niece was diagnosed with type one diabetes.
You know,

773
00:45:18.081 --> 00:45:20.030
and Sundays are like really hard for that.

774
00:45:20.031 --> 00:45:23.390
Like that's a disability that you can't necessarily always see unless you see

775
00:45:23.391 --> 00:45:26.930
maybe like a glucose monitor on someone or insulin pump.
But like,
you know,

776
00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.900
my sister's just,
I don't know,
she's just awesome with that.

777
00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:33.750
Like it just is really special.
Like the other day,
you know,
they were the way,

778
00:45:33.751 --> 00:45:35.930
she's at this birthday party and I'm,

779
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.590
this little girl came up to her and she could see that she had like a glucose

780
00:45:39.591 --> 00:45:40.460
monitor in the back of her arm.

781
00:45:40.461 --> 00:45:43.250
It was his princess themed birthday party and this little girl was like,

782
00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.290
you can't be a princess because you have one of those.

783
00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.990
And my immediate response was like,

784
00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:50.030
oh well you can't be a princess cause you're the devil.

785
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:59.490
<v 0>I think that</v>

786
00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:04.310
<v 3>it's a fair response.
I think it's a fair response.
I think use head butter after.</v>

787
00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:08.980
Yeah,
that's right.
The little girl,
the person got it on Youtube.

788
00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:12.670
Right.
It's like,

789
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:14.380
Oh make me break a jogging me and vote

790
00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:19.430
<v 4>the,
um,
so how did your sister handle that?
Yeah,
she's like,</v>

791
00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.790
she'll talk to her about it and it just like that,
just in this like very,

792
00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:26.140
you know,
being open,
loving way and like,
yeah,
it sucks.
So,
you know,

793
00:46:26.141 --> 00:46:29.300
and like dealing with like the reality of it,
but it's really like they,
you know,

794
00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:34.330
she won't let her be consumed with this like identity around like the type one

795
00:46:34.371 --> 00:46:37.700
diabetes,
you know?
And it's like,
and kind of teaching or even at a young age,

796
00:46:37.701 --> 00:46:38.181
like,
yeah,

797
00:46:38.181 --> 00:46:40.820
I mean if you want to do something someday to be able to make a difference with

798
00:46:40.821 --> 00:46:43.580
this,
like you can,
yeah.
That's like,
yeah,

799
00:46:43.581 --> 00:46:48.200
she's like four years old and then she's like the sweetest girl in my life.

800
00:46:48.201 --> 00:46:50.480
I mean it,
and she's,
I think that that too,

801
00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:52.640
in kind of her being around me and other things like that,

802
00:46:52.641 --> 00:46:56.000
it's kind of given her a level of like,
you know,

803
00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:58.760
in difference about the disability,
which I think is a really good thing.

804
00:46:58.761 --> 00:47:01.730
Like indifference.
There is like zero separation.
It's just normal.

805
00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:06.290
And the only time that she's ever said anything when my niece,
where we were,
um,

806
00:47:06.291 --> 00:47:09.890
we were coloring together and it was this like Elsa,
you know,

807
00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:14.090
Elsa and ana kind of like a thing that we're coloring.
And,
um,
and she was like,

808
00:47:14.091 --> 00:47:18.680
look at me.
She was like,
Oh,
Kai,
Kai,
you don't have hands.
And I was like,
yeah,

809
00:47:18.681 --> 00:47:19.900
I don't.
She was like,
Huh,

810
00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:28.660
<v 3>it's amazing.
He's like,
wait,
okay.</v>

811
00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:36.490
<v 4>I,
I love um,
tool,
right?
Maynard James Keenan and tool.
He's like,</v>

812
00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:41.410
he's the man and like,
I love him.
He also,
he's a black belt in Jujitsu.

813
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:45.430
Wrestled it army.
Yeah.
I saw a guy that tried to get on stage with him one time,

814
00:47:45.431 --> 00:47:47.470
got past security and the guy was like,

815
00:47:47.471 --> 00:47:49.990
went to go and give him a hug and like Maynard went to like give him a hug and

816
00:47:49.991 --> 00:47:50.770
he hit Austin,

817
00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:54.670
took the guy's back rear naked choke the guys like rocking out and Maynard

818
00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:57.280
starts singing it again and like,
then the guys hand just drops

819
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.350
this bad stage throwing up on,
right.
He's,

820
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:04.030
he's a guy where I'm like,

821
00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:12.410
so Maynard goes and gives up.
He's this meet music career.

822
00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:12.941
He's still doing it,

823
00:48:12.941 --> 00:48:15.490
but it's like he's had this super successful career in music.

824
00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.800
Completely gives it up,
recreates himself as a winemaker.
I didn't know.

825
00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:21.610
He didn't know that dude.
You're like the wine guy.

826
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:22.743
<v 3>I like what</v>

827
00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:28.810
I would consumer.
I basically,

828
00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:32.890
I've drank like I don't even know,
like my body weight many times over.

829
00:48:32.891 --> 00:48:36.430
And now that because of you,
I thought for sure you would know that.
Oh yeah.
No,

830
00:48:36.431 --> 00:48:41.200
I mean,
look,
I'm not going to,
I am capacities.

831
00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:45.530
<v 4>What do you know in,
in why?
No,
it's,
it's like a brutal business.
Super Brutal.</v>

832
00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:46.513
It's kind of like,

833
00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:49.410
<v 3>especially with,
with the exception of a rare few,
it's kind of like,
okay,</v>

834
00:48:49.411 --> 00:48:52.940
if you want to,
I can't remember.
I asked this buddy of mine,
oh,

835
00:48:52.941 --> 00:48:57.270
it's a bunch of bars.
And uh,
I asked him why he didn't do restaurants.
Like,

836
00:48:57.271 --> 00:48:58.890
why don't you have food on your menu?
And he goes,

837
00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.690
I would rather he's putting to a window.
He's like,

838
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:04.860
I would rather put my hands behind my back,
jump through that window,
face first,

839
00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:10.370
take all of my money and light it on fire in the street and start a restaurant.

840
00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:12.720
They explained it,
but it's like,
he's kind of indifferent to it.

841
00:49:12.721 --> 00:49:16.260
It's like magazines,
newspapers,
restaurants.

842
00:49:16.261 --> 00:49:20.040
Like you probably should just let your money on fire.
And then wineries,

843
00:49:20.041 --> 00:49:22.350
it's like,
with the exception of a handful of people,

844
00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.730
<v 4>very hard to make work brutal,
brutal.</v>

845
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:29.650
And you're at the whim of acts of God,
right?
I mean like,
totally.

846
00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:31.180
You have a bad season,
you have a bad season.

847
00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:34.120
I think winemakers said the most interesting people because I think the ones

848
00:49:34.121 --> 00:49:37.150
that I got to in Argentina in this last climb and we were in the land and

849
00:49:37.151 --> 00:49:39.740
Malbeck and spent time with this guy,
um,

850
00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:43.840
that the wine was Ellen and Nigo and had this like,
you know,
super masculine,

851
00:49:43.841 --> 00:49:47.500
like half Scorpion,
half man on the label.
But it said at the end,

852
00:49:47.501 --> 00:49:50.990
there's only one battle that you remember and it's a battle within.
It's like,

853
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:53.680
I'm in,
of course I'm like,
this could be terrible,

854
00:49:53.681 --> 00:49:56.520
but I'm going to love it because of that.
Yeah.

855
00:49:56.530 --> 00:50:00.310
But the guy was like testing limits and testing assumptions where he was growing

856
00:50:00.311 --> 00:50:03.360
grapes at altitudes that like people said you couldn't do it.
Yeah.

857
00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:04.930
And I love that.
You know,
it's like,

858
00:50:04.931 --> 00:50:08.850
I love that you can go and test those assumptions.
It's like,
yeah,

859
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:13.000
that was,
you know,
basically it's in medicine.
It's in everything.
I mean,

860
00:50:13.001 --> 00:50:16.790
I just got to give a speech with Pfizer and I talked about the treatment that my

861
00:50:16.791 --> 00:50:18.710
grandma went through with this,
you know,

862
00:50:18.711 --> 00:50:22.070
in cancer oncology treatment products are some of the things that they go and

863
00:50:22.071 --> 00:50:25.600
make and,
and the,
the,
the,
the polarity that occurred in,

864
00:50:25.601 --> 00:50:28.940
in the detention that occurred in inside of our family and how that treatment

865
00:50:28.941 --> 00:50:32.920
should go.
It was really intense.
And it finally,
I like,
you know,

866
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:35.890
she was dealing with oncologists that hadn't had,
you know,

867
00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:39.260
they went to school that were like maybe 40 or 50 years ago.
Right.

868
00:50:39.261 --> 00:50:43.190
And it was like there at the very tail end of their careers and they're not

869
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:48.160
updating the map.
Right.
And there's so many things like even,
um,
fasting has had,

870
00:50:48.161 --> 00:50:53.120
you know,
demonstrated profound effects on,
on,
on,
on,
um,

871
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:54.710
you know,
radiation and chemo treatment.

872
00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:57.680
<v 3>That's incredible.
I mean,
you know,
Dominic D'agostino,</v>

873
00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:03.400
I've interviewed a few times of incredible scientist as looked at the effects

874
00:51:03.771 --> 00:51:05.630
of,
it doesn't,
it's not effective for all types of cancer.

875
00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:07.280
It's not suitable for all patients,

876
00:51:07.281 --> 00:51:11.990
but there are published studies looking at how it can sensitize cancer cells,

877
00:51:11.991 --> 00:51:16.991
two different types of treatments while protecting the good cells,

878
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:19.130
healthy cells.
It's very,
very fascinating stuff.

879
00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:21.980
And I just want to mention one thing,

880
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:25.370
which is you were talking about how everyone has,

881
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:28.850
everyone's like Swiss cheese,
you know,
we all have our disabilities.

882
00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:33.510
Just some are more visible than others perhaps.
Yep.
So malbeck this is a,

883
00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:37.670
and this may be an exaggeration,
that's also common in Argentina.

884
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:41.480
Very nice people.
They love telling stories.
But uh,

885
00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:45.590
Mall Beck was not really well known in the world before Argentina,

886
00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:49.460
but it was brought from Europe and my understanding is that it was basically

887
00:51:49.461 --> 00:51:54.461
treated like a garbage grid and then the immigrants brought it to Bueno situs

888
00:51:55.540 --> 00:52:00.190
and it's turned into this world famous one that was discarded effectively.

889
00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:04.050
So you never know where you're going to find the strength,
the garbage.
Great man.

890
00:52:04.051 --> 00:52:07.930
And maybe that's a book,
right?
Seriously,
I think about this,
I'm like everyone

891
00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:09.590
<v 4>favorite societies to go and study it.</v>

892
00:52:09.591 --> 00:52:11.970
Like the Spartans and the Vikings and he's aware cultures,

893
00:52:11.971 --> 00:52:13.050
they would have like left me to die.

894
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:15.470
<v 3>You're right.
Take it this one,
throw them over the edge</v>

895
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:21.410
like 300 or throwing the baby lock like that would have been me right there.

896
00:52:21.411 --> 00:52:22.280
Like clearly,

897
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:29.630
oh my God.
So many amazing images coming up today.
Tingling,
Unitus.
Yeah.

898
00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:31.990
I'm still thinking about your view on like coke moving your furniture.

899
00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:36.720
<v 5>Sure.
Uh,
well the night is young,
right?</v>

900
00:52:36.721 --> 00:52:40.960
Yeah.
The night in the night.
I mean a hell of a party.
What time you get to feel,

901
00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:42.573
uh,

902
00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:49.590
<v 3>from when you had the initial idea to do Kilimanjaro to the point that you were</v>

903
00:52:49.591 --> 00:52:53.710
actually suited up,
geared and about to start the climb.
How much time elapsed?
So

904
00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:55.890
<v 4>sitting in the bathtub,
you know,</v>

905
00:52:55.891 --> 00:53:00.891
with the ice had the idea that was like fall of 2010.

906
00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:04.830
Uh,
met my friend Dan,
April,

907
00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:09.030
2011 and we started this project together and then April,

908
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:13.140
2011 and then by January 3rd,
2012 we were on the plane flying to Africa.

909
00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:17.060
And you have to figure out a lot of stuff.
I mean,
I mean,

910
00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:20.190
first it was getting somebody that's crazy enough to take us seriously because

911
00:53:20.191 --> 00:53:25.020
it was like,
so how'd you convince someone to do it?
Um,
it was,
it was rough.
I,

912
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:28.890
and when we,
I think so,
thankfully one of my friends and mentors,

913
00:53:28.891 --> 00:53:30.920
this guy named Eric widen my or that,
um,

914
00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:34.470
this is the first blind mountain near to climb Mount Everest and every high peak

915
00:53:34.471 --> 00:53:34.980
in the world.

916
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:39.690
And he actually just rafted the entire length of the Colorado River through the

917
00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:44.140
Grand Canyon.
Wow.
Right.
Not rafted like on a rafting,
kayaking.
Why?
Wow.

918
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:47.550
Completely glass,
like,
not like a peek through,
like,
you know,

919
00:53:47.551 --> 00:53:49.450
when you like put blindfold on a little bit,
like he doesn't,

920
00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:52.830
it's like crazy to think about that.
That's wild.
And like,

921
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:56.630
he's insane.
He's amazing.
And,
um,
you know,
I,

922
00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:59.400
I saw like sought him out.

923
00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:04.020
Me and my friend Dan who helped me cocreate the mission and,
um,

924
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:06.240
we,
you know,

925
00:54:06.241 --> 00:54:09.120
Dan was the first one that was kind of like the one crazy enough to go along

926
00:54:09.121 --> 00:54:13.230
with me.
Um,
he'd,
you know,
he'd been a record setting,

927
00:54:13.231 --> 00:54:15.960
Middle Linebacker,
Eh,
the Alec was,
you know,

928
00:54:15.961 --> 00:54:19.050
he was like five foot nine or something like that,
you know,

929
00:54:19.051 --> 00:54:22.980
and like had 21 on us is tackles in game.
If it was like one of the most,

930
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:25.920
you just passionate,
esoteric,
you know,

931
00:54:25.921 --> 00:54:28.500
just guys that we and I can connect with on that level,

932
00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:31.850
almost burnt my house down because you know,
a couple of screws,

933
00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:33.300
literally random story.
But yeah,

934
00:54:33.301 --> 00:54:36.390
you like microwaved an aluminum coffee mug and I was doing some emails and I

935
00:54:36.391 --> 00:54:39.210
turned around and there's flames shooting out of my way,
like Brown.

936
00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:43.240
So I hope he sees this,
but you know,
so it's like,

937
00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:46.140
but he's this kind of guy though that was like she could go and run through a

938
00:54:46.141 --> 00:54:50.120
brick wall.
Yeah.
And I needed that person to go and have that belief with me.

939
00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:53.820
So then from there we sought out Eric,
Eric introduce this to our guide.

940
00:54:53.821 --> 00:54:58.620
Kevin [inaudible].
Kevin had led now he'd managed out Eric's base camp,

941
00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:03.150
um,
of,
of Eric.
Eric saw Everest climb,
this base camp manager.

942
00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:04.260
He led,

943
00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:09.060
he's led more climbers up Kilimanjaro than I think any American and many with

944
00:55:09.061 --> 00:55:12.870
disabilities.
Let a guy almost to the trees on it and like a hand crank bike,

945
00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:18.000
um,
group of like eight climb,
applying climbers up Kilimanjaro.
So with Kevin,

946
00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.510
he was really the one that,
you know,

947
00:55:19.511 --> 00:55:21.370
him and his partner Kristen and kind of made it happen.

948
00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:26.720
<v 6>Well I would just want to thank you Kyle for honestly showing everyone that they</v>

949
00:55:28.081 --> 00:55:29.970
can do more than they think they're capable of doing.

950
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:31.700
It's a huge gift to the world.

951
00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:33.360
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

952
00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:48.540
<v 6>Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

953
00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:51.570
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

954
00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:54.840
Do you want to get a short email from me?

955
00:55:54.841 --> 00:55:58.980
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

956
00:55:58.981 --> 00:56:02.970
little morsel of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very short

957
00:56:02.971 --> 00:56:07.500
email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been pondering

958
00:56:07.501 --> 00:56:11.190
over the week.
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

959
00:56:11.191 --> 00:56:14.640
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

960
00:56:14.641 --> 00:56:18.930
somehow dug up in the,
uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

961
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:24.230
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

962
00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:27.640
close friends for instance.
And it's very short,

963
00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:32.680
it's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

964
00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:34.900
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

965
00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:39.850
Just go to four hour work week.com that's four hour work week.com all spelled

966
00:56:39.851 --> 00:56:43.000
out and just drop in your email and you will get the very next one.

967
00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:45.100
And if you sign up,
I hope you enjoy it.

968
00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:48.250
This episode is brought to you by 99 designs.

969
00:56:48.251 --> 00:56:52.090
I've used 99 designs for years for all sorts of graphic design needs,

970
00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:55.060
whether you need a logo,
website,
book cover,
or anything else.

971
00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:59.290
99 designs was created to make great designs accessible to everyone and to make

972
00:56:59.291 --> 00:57:03.280
the process of getting designs much,
much easier.
So when I first started out,

973
00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.050
for instance,
testing,

974
00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:08.650
prototype covers and getting prototype covers for the four hour body,

975
00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:10.150
I want the contest drop.

976
00:57:10.151 --> 00:57:12.880
That is one option and this is a great solution fueling for fast,

977
00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:16.810
affordable design work and the ability to choose from dozens of options

978
00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:20.650
risk-free.
Let's say you need something late night,
quick turnaround,

979
00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:21.970
well people in other time zones,

980
00:57:21.971 --> 00:57:25.480
other countries can also help you solve that problem.
Since then,

981
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:26.291
I've worked with nine,

982
00:57:26.291 --> 00:57:31.291
nine designs on a separate path or a different option and that is the one-to-one

983
00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:37.960
project service.
So in a number of cases,
and I'll give you one example,

984
00:57:37.961 --> 00:57:41.860
when I wanted to create the cover for my audio book,
the Tao of Seneca,

985
00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:43.330
this was a very important project to me.

986
00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:46.600
I decided to use their one to one project service.

987
00:57:46.601 --> 00:57:49.750
And with this service you can invite a specific designer,
do your project,

988
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:50.830
agree on a price,

989
00:57:50.831 --> 00:57:53.770
and then work together until you're satisfied in their to iterate and provide

990
00:57:53.771 --> 00:57:57.160
feedback and all of this stuff.
And I haven't shared it yet,

991
00:57:57.161 --> 00:57:59.380
but we also got some incredibly good,

992
00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:04.620
really some of the best illustrations I've ever seen from using this one-to-one

993
00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:07.960
project service with a handful of different designers and illustrators.

994
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:11.920
They blew my mind.
99 designs makes this all very easy and efficient,

995
00:58:11.921 --> 00:58:16.660
so you can check out the Tao of Seneca design and other work that I and your

996
00:58:16.661 --> 00:58:17.920
fellow listeners for that matter.

997
00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:23.160
I've done on 99 designs@ninetyninedesigns.com forward slash Tim and right now

998
00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:27.970
you can get a free $99 upgrade on your first design.
Again,

999
00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:32.890
that's 99 designs.com four slash Tim this episode is brought to you by

1000
00:58:32.891 --> 00:58:37.510
wordpress,
my goto platform for blogging,
writing online,

1001
00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:42.250
creating websites,
everything.
I love wordpress to bits.

1002
00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:43.330
My site,

1003
00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:48.330
every site just about that I have is run on wordpress and the lead developer of

1004
00:58:48.821 --> 00:58:53.770
wordpress,
Matt [inaudible] has appeared on this podcast many times.

1005
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:57.040
The very first episode in particular is amazing.

1006
00:58:57.041 --> 00:59:01.600
The second I took a ton of notes on,
so he's checking out,
but wordpress,

1007
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:06.100
where do I even begin?
I mean the New Yorker use it,
Jay z,
Beyonce,

1008
00:59:06.101 --> 00:59:09.040
they use it five 38 tech crunch,
Ted,
CNN.

1009
00:59:09.041 --> 00:59:13.480
Time with you are looking to create a personal blog,
a business site,

1010
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:16.450
both,
neither.
Something else.

1011
00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:21.510
You'll make a huge impact when you build your website on wordpress dot calm and

1012
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:26.030
directly from some friends at Google.
I'm not going to quote them by name,

1013
00:59:26.031 --> 00:59:31.010
but they say that wordpress offers the best out of the box SEO.

1014
00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:33.830
That's search engine optimization imaginable,

1015
00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:38.860
so if you're on wordpress you immediately have a leg up on everybody else on the

1016
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:42.260
search engines and so forth.
In my experience,

1017
00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:45.740
I'm no medical doctor of search engine optimization,

1018
00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:50.770
but I will say that I used wordpress for years and fell in love with it to the

1019
00:59:52.101 --> 00:59:57.101
extent that I became very close friends with Matt and then became an investor

1020
00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.170
slash advisor to automatic,

1021
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.830
which runs wordpress.com that is how much I believe in this and that's how a lot

1022
01:00:03.831 --> 01:00:08.831
of my most successful products and investments have come about because I'm in

1023
01:00:09.111 --> 01:00:11.780
love with x and then I seek out x.

1024
01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:15.650
Nearly 30% of the Internet is run on wordpress,

1025
01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.340
and that includes everything from the huge sites that I mentioned to

1026
01:00:19.341 --> 01:00:22.460
neighborhood sites,
and it is super easy to get started.

1027
01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:25.640
There's no need to worry about security or upgrades or hosting.

1028
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:29.180
They offer 24 seven support and handle all of that,

1029
01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:34.210
which allows you to focus on creating the highest quality content you can with

1030
01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:37.700
the least amount of friction.
I don't have to worry about downtime.

1031
01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:41.780
I don't want to have to worry about getting emergency emails if I'm on vacation

1032
01:00:41.781 --> 01:00:46.190
or something like that,
and wordpress is my goto solution for all of this.

1033
01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:51.220
I trust all of my most important text on the Internet to wordpress,

1034
01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:55.850
and they can't buy that with a sponsorship.
They can't buy that with anything.

1035
01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:59.240
I want uptime,
uptime,
uptime,
and quality,

1036
01:00:59.241 --> 01:01:02.390
and that is what I have selected after everything that I've looked at.

1037
01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:04.610
So check it out.
Go to wordpress.

1038
