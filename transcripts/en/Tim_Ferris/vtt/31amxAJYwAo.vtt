00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.870
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.871 --> 00:00:07.420
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.
No else.

3
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.610
I'm a cybernetic organism.

4
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.490
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by Linkedin and their job recruitment platform,</v>

5
00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:31.760
which offers a smarter system for the hiring process.

6
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.280
If you've ever hired anyone or attempted to do it,

7
00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:37.970
you know that finding the right people can be extremely difficult.

8
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.850
And if you don't have a direct referral from someone you trust,

9
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.470
you're left to use job boards that don't really offer any real world networking

10
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.340
approach.
And when I mean by that is in contrast,
Linkedin,

11
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.650
which is the world's largest professional network,

12
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.220
has a built in ecosystem that allows you to not only search for employees,

13
00:00:55.221 --> 00:01:00.020
but also interact with them and their connections and their former employers or

14
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.860
colleagues in a way that closely mimics real life communication.

15
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.220
More than 70% of the workforce in the u s uses Linkedin and more than 22 million

16
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.010
professionals view and apply to linkedin every single week.

17
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.910
Unlike generic job boards,
linkedin considers skills,
experience,

18
00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:18.470
and location to match you with candidates,

19
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.030
making it easier to find quality candidates.
And,
uh,

20
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.760
maybe above all you can directly contact,
uh,
candidates,

21
00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:30.140
connections to get a good sense of if they are a good fit for your business.

22
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.620

25
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.410
This episode is brought to you by Peloton.

26
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.440
And I'd heard about Peloton over and over again,

27
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.390
but I ended up getting a Peloton bike and the whole system after I saw my buddy

28
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.510
Kevin Rose,
I've known him forever,
some of you know,

29
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.540
and he showed up at my gate at my house a while back and he looked fantastic.

30
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.830
I asked him,
I said,
dude,
you look great.
What the hell have you been up to?

31
00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:11.960
Because he's always doing a weird diet or another,

32
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:13.490
but it only lasts like a week or two.

33
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.330
So he always regresses to the mean after like 75 beers.
And he said,

34
00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:19.580
I've been doing peloton five days a week.

35
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.320
Now that caught my attention because Kevin does nothing five days a week.

36
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.830
And you know,
I love you Kevin,
but it really peaked my curiosity.

37
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.890
Ended up getting a system and it's become an integral part of my week.

38
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.790
I love it and I really didn't expect to love it at all because I find cycling

39
00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:39.440
really boring usually.

40
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.470
But peloton is an indoor cycling bike that brings live studio classes right into

41
00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:45.314
your home.

42
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.870
You don't have to worry about fitting classes into your schedule or making it to

43
00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:49.910
a studio with some type of commute,

44
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.440
etc. New classes are added every day and this includes options led by elite New

45
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.940
York City instructors in your own living room.

46
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.280
You can even livestream studio classes taught by the world's instructors or find

47
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:02.950
your own favorite class on demand.
And in fact,

48
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:07.180
Kevin and I rarely do live classes and you can compete with your friends,

49
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.770
which is also fun.
Kevin,

50
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:12.970
I'm coming after you but we usually just use classes on demand.

51
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.530
I really like Matt Wilbur's and his iron,

52
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.480
high intensity training sessions that are shorter,
like 20 minutes.

53
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.080
And I think Kevin's favorite is Alex and everyone seems to have their favorite

54
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.750
instructor or you can select by music duration and so on.

55
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.790
Each Peloton bike includes a 22 inch HD touchscreen performance tracking

56
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:34.271
metrics.

57
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:38.590
I think that that along with the realtime leaderboard are the main reasons that

58
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:43.270
this caught my attention when cycling never had caught my attention before.

59
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.780
It's really pretty stunning what they've done with the user interface to keep

60
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:47.614
your attention.

61
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.670
The belt drive is quiet and it's smaller than you would expect so it can fit in

62
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:55.690
a living room or an office.
I actually have it in a large closet,

63
00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:59.050
believe it or not and it fits with no problem.

64
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.170
So peloton is offering all of you guys,

65
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.090

70
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:27.550
I don't need fancy towels or whatever other supplemental bits.
And pieces.

71
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.770
No,
the shoes you need,

Hello boys and girls.

83
00:05:14.291 --> 00:05:17.830
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

84
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.810
My guest today is Nicholas Thompson on Twitter at [inaudible] Thompson.

85
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.320
He is the editor and chief of wired under his leadership.

86
00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:29.080
Wired has launched a successful paywall,
a snapchat channel,

87
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.380
and an amp stories addition,
if I'm pronouncing that correctly,

88
00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:33.720
I'm not sure if to amp or amp.

89
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.510
We'll get back to that is also been nominated for national magazine awards in

90
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:39.070
design and feature writing.

91
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.020
Thompson is a contributor for CBS News and regularly appears on CBS this
morning.

92
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.670
He is also a cofounder of the activist which I've had contact with going way

93
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:52.660
back in the day.
A National Magazine Award winning digital publication.

94
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.890
Prior to joining wired,

95
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.910
Thompson served as editor of New York or Dotcom for 2012 to 2017

96
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.660
<v 2>before the New Yorker Thompson was a senior editor at wired where he assigned an</v>

97
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:04.820
edited the feature story,
the great escape,

98
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.740
which was the basis for the Oscar winning film Argo.
In 2009 his book,

99
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.290
the Hawk and the dove,
Paul Nitsa,

100
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.130
George Kennan and history of the Cold War was published to critical acclaim in

101
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:17.540
February,

102
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.020
2018 Thompson cowrote wired's cover story inside the two years that shook

103
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:25.520
Facebook and the world and 11,000 were an investigation based on reporting with

104
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:28.310
more than 50 current and former Facebook employees.

105
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.450
Nick,
welcome to the show.

106
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.890
My pleasure and I appreciate you correcting or at least informing my

107
00:06:40.891 --> 00:06:44.040
pronunciation of the the subtitle of your book.

108
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.390
<v 3>Not An easy name to pronounce.
I was a favorite story about it.</v>

109
00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:53.450
As I was giving a talk about my book and was kind of like 10 minutes.

110
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.320
This guy runs out so knits up one of the characters in is my grandfather.

111
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.390
This guy runs out and at the end I asked the host,
I was like,

112
00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:04.660
why did that guy leave?
It looks me.

113
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.680
He said he thought he was going to hear from niches,
grants.

114
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.700
<v 2>I want to ask and I have many,
many in front of me that I will ask,</v>

115
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.570
but I thought I would start with,
I chanced upon when doing homework

116
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.020
I'll lead into with just reading the line and it is,

117
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.060
he is also an instrumental guitarist who used to supplement his journalism by

118
00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:39.920
playing on subway platforms.

119
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.800
Is that true that you used to play music to supplement your writing income?

120
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:46.850
Presumably?
I guess

121
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.490
<v 3>the wrong word because I actually made more money.</v>

122
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:52.223
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

123
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.480
<v 3>When I was young journalist,
so let's say ages 21 to 24,</v>

124
00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:01.340
I played on finger Sabaton and the platforms in New York and you could make a

125
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.200
good amount of money.
You know,
I'd make $20 an hour.
Um,
you meet people,

126
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.510
it's really fun.
You learn a lot about the city.

127
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.570
It's good sort of forced practice for multiple hours.

128
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.990
You learn a lot about the trains.
I had a great time doing that.

129
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.300
<v 2>Did you pick up any best practices for busking?</v>

130
00:08:18.301 --> 00:08:21.450
And then there are many people who play on the platforms.

131
00:08:21.451 --> 00:08:24.000
I'm sure they make different rates.
So what are the,

132
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.440
what were some of the best practices or approaches it up?

133
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.370
<v 3>We'll just kind of interesting is to figure out the style of music you play and</v>

134
00:08:33.371 --> 00:08:35.440
the demographics you kind of hit.
Um,

135
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.770
so if you're playing like super familiar stuff,

136
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.300
if you're doing kind of Beatles covers,

137
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.300
you can go in a hallway right where people will hear you for two seconds and

138
00:08:43.301 --> 00:08:46.420
walk by.
Or you can be on a train platform in the trains come every two minutes.

139
00:08:46.421 --> 00:08:46.661
Right?

140
00:08:46.661 --> 00:08:49.720
Because people were just here yesterday and give you money if you're doing what

141
00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:54.550
I was doing because like weird instrumental guitar music that people will only

142
00:08:54.551 --> 00:08:57.840
like if they get a couple of minutes uninterrupted.

143
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.460
You've got to find a platform where you know there may not be a ton of foot

144
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:04.380
traffic but where the trains don't come very often.

145
00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:07.890
So for me the place it turned out to be the best was the l train platform.

146
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.200
I'm on Sixth Avenue and 14th Street people,

147
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:11.910
no New York to be able to visualize it.

148
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.840
And what was good about that is that the l train comes relatively infrequently.

149
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.370
It's one platform with book trains going on either side of it.

150
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.830
It's not a split platforms.

151
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.740
You get people who are booked going both west and east and then it was kind of

152
00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:29.460
like perfect for me demographically because it's where all the gay guys and

153
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:34.320
Chelsea got off and then we're all kind of the sort of [inaudible] young

154
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:36.210
hipsters are heading to Williamsburg.

155
00:09:36.211 --> 00:09:39.960
So I got like a lot of demographics are going to like stop if they see a young

156
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:42.210
guy playing guitar and possibly give him money.

157
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.263
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

158
00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.133
<v 3>that was,</v>

159
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.190
I really spent a lot of time thinking it through and that was the one I liked.

160
00:09:47.191 --> 00:09:49.690
So what you do is you try to get there,
you know,

161
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:53.430
you don't want to be there at like three o'clock when schools get out.

162
00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:57.090
Cause everybody's lights.
It's crazy.
People are yelling and nobody can hear you.

163
00:09:57.091 --> 00:09:59.940
The kids are jumping,
the kids kind of make fun of you.
Um,

164
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.850
but you definitely want to be there during commute time and you definitely want

165
00:10:02.851 --> 00:10:05.130
to be there at like nine o'clock at night.
And it's the rules,

166
00:10:05.131 --> 00:10:09.090
at least back when I was doing it a lot are,
you know,
once you got a spot,

167
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:14.030
you keep that spot.
So it's until you either get bored or have to pee,
um,

168
00:10:14.031 --> 00:10:15.050
that you have it.
So you,

169
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.020
you try to calm right at like three 30 and then hold it until 10 if you can.

170
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:26.510
<v 2>Did you ever contemplate the Beatles route playing more popular music</v>

171
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.610
or did you choose your,

172
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.770
your musical selection for other reasons besides the $20 an hour?

173
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.510
<v 3>Yeah,
it would have been,
the thing is that I'm not good at,
I'd Beatles covers.</v>

174
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:45.060
Right.
And like I have like a limited,

175
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.030
I have a very conversation is if I have a limited skill set.
Right.

176
00:10:48.031 --> 00:10:53.031
I'm very good at writing my own like multitenant acoustic instrumental guitar

177
00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:57.270
songs and I am really bad at reading music and played other stuff.

178
00:10:57.271 --> 00:11:00.210
So I never had that choice.
But it would be an interesting choice.
Right.

179
00:11:00.211 --> 00:11:04.350
Do you go for,
if you had the capacity to do both,
which do you choose?

180
00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:08.220
Do you choose the one that gets you more money and is a little less emotionally

181
00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:09.560
fulfilling?
Uh,

182
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.050
it's like a typical electric we have in a thousand moments in life.

183
00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.720
Unfortunately,
I didn't have to do that in this particular,

184
00:11:15.721 --> 00:11:17.550
so when music stage of my career.

185
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.250
<v 2>Why did you choose writing full time</v>

186
00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:25.723
music full time?

187
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:28.043
<v 3>MMM.</v>

188
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:33.140
<v 2>It seems like both paths are presumably difficult,
right?</v>

189
00:11:33.141 --> 00:11:37.590
I mean,
you are a creator in both paths.
Uh,

190
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.480
I don't know if that's a bad question,
but it just comes to mind.

191
00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:42.830
It's like you seem very talented.

192
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.960
<v 3>I think that what was interesting is that they were kind of competitive with me.</v>

193
00:11:52.421 --> 00:11:55.450
Right.
And so the that go into how much time do you prioritize playing music?

194
00:11:55.451 --> 00:11:59.230
How much time do you prioritize data journalist includes factors like how much

195
00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:03.250
do you make per hour,
but also as time goes by,

196
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.370
how do you expect your life and ambitions to grow?

197
00:12:06.371 --> 00:12:11.230
And the thing about being a musician is that I kind of,

198
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.810
I could see the end point,
right?

199
00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:17.590
I didn't think I was going to become a transcendent,
really good musician.

200
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:22.890
I didn't see a career where I would like change the way music was made or you

201
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.630
know,
create a new sound.
Like I didn't,

202
00:12:25.631 --> 00:12:29.440
I didn't think that even if I devoted myself to a completely for 10 years,

203
00:12:29.441 --> 00:12:30.550
I'd ever reached that high point.

204
00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:34.120
So I could kind of see the Max that I would get through.
Whereas in journalism,

205
00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:37.770
the Max was quite a bit higher.
So as the,
you know,

206
00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.350
as the earnings began to equal out of it began to earn more as a journalist.
Um,

207
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:46.300
I started to gravitate more more towards that.
Um,
so it was,

208
00:12:46.301 --> 00:12:49.690
it was a combination of having some success as a journalist and then also

209
00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.500
thinking through like what would a life as a musician do you like versus what

210
00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:56.570
would life as a journalist be like for somebody with my skeleton?

211
00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.900
As I said earlier,
my skills as a musician or limited,
right.
I could,

212
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.340
I could do well at one thing,

213
00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:02.500
but I didn't think I was going to really make a life for it.

214
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:06.420
<v 2>That why do you recall any particular moment?</v>

215
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.890
It could be at any point in your life,

216
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:13.840
this writing thing or this editing thing,

217
00:13:13.841 --> 00:13:18.790
something related to long form text is something that I could really be

218
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.330
excellent at or this,

219
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.040
this is something that I think I could make a good living doing because

220
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.430
I can be exceptional at this.

221
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:32.460
Was there a moment where you had that thought that would compel you to pursue

222
00:13:34.421 --> 00:13:35.800
that say instead of the music?

223
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:37.623
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

224
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:42.760
The funny thing is that in my mind to those foundational years,

225
00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.820
let's say from when,

226
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.530
from the time I graduated college to the time I completely committed to it as

227
00:13:50.531 --> 00:13:53.500
it's to be a journalist was 29.
It wasn't,

228
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:57.070
it wasn't always music versus journalism,
you know,

229
00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:01.060
in those early years of his music versus journalism and other things.

230
00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:05.340
And then it was journalism versus other things.
Um,
you know,

231
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:06.850
he had finished college.

232
00:14:06.851 --> 00:14:09.730
I thought I was going to be sort of an environmental activist or am I going to

233
00:14:09.731 --> 00:14:12.820
politics.
Um,
I got kind of put in,

234
00:14:12.821 --> 00:14:17.230
tracked into journalism kind of a slightly odd way we can,

235
00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:19.120
we can get into.
Um,

236
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:24.510
so it was really only at about 29 when I got hired by wired,

237
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.180
um,
and started to do a good job at it in stories.
And when I started writing,

238
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.040
writing my book about Nixon Cannon,
that I began to feel really comfortable,

239
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:34.900
confident about it as a career choice.

240
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.910
<v 2>You said,
I think you just attract into journalism in an odd way.</v>

241
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.790
Sorry,
I should have known you're going to come with that.
I can't pick that up.

242
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.760
Pick that up.
Right.
Let's jump.
Let's jump into it.

243
00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.510
<v 3>It's super bizarre.
So I,
when I was in college,</v>

244
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.940
I was focused very much on being like a good college student and succeed in a

245
00:14:56.941 --> 00:14:59.120
college and like going into student government and getting good grades,

246
00:14:59.121 --> 00:15:02.060
but I was two degree.
That's strange.
When I look back,

247
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.770
it did not think at all about what would happen,
right.
I went to Stanford,

248
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.780
had a graduate school fellowship,
like I did,
I did well in college,

249
00:15:08.781 --> 00:15:13.250
but I've prepared for life post college extraordinarily badly.
Um,

250
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.480
and so I graduate and then maybe the fall after I graduated where I'm playing

251
00:15:17.481 --> 00:15:19.730
guitar,
um,
I get,

252
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:24.500
I meet somebody at a party and sort of get surprisingly hired as an associate

253
00:15:24.501 --> 00:15:29.480
producer at 60 minutes,
which is a great job.
And so I moved to New York.
Um,

254
00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:34.640
I show up at CBS or 60 minutes is,
and within an hour I'm fired

255
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.840
<v 4>within an hour.
Who are you?</v>

256
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.840
I was being hired at a position,
sort of beyond my stature.

257
00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.180
It was very strange and in retrospect it's one of the things where I was,

258
00:15:52.181 --> 00:15:54.010
I was treated kind of awfully,
but anyway,

259
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:57.290
<v 3>understand it.
I was 22 so I go,
I show up,
I'm just don't remember it.</v>

260
00:15:57.291 --> 00:15:59.990
And this guy's name was still chef Larry's like,
who are you?
I'm,
I was like,

261
00:15:59.991 --> 00:16:03.170
I'm the new associate producer.
I'm working under.
Steve Cross is like,

262
00:16:03.171 --> 00:16:06.170
what have you done in television before?
I was like,
nothing,
you know?

263
00:16:06.171 --> 00:16:08.480
And he's like,
well,
what if you'd done professionally before?
I was like,
nothing.

264
00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.630
I just graduated and he's like,
and we hired you as an associate producer.

265
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.800
I was like,
yeah,
you know,

266
00:16:12.801 --> 00:16:14.900
I did these interviews and that's found in these tests and he's like,

267
00:16:14.901 --> 00:16:15.734
you're fired.

268
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.790
<v 4>And like they literally took me out of the building</v>

269
00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:22.180
gets worse.
So

270
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:22.910
<v 3>that's,</v>

271
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:27.620
that's I think December of 1997 I graduated college in June of 1970 that's

272
00:16:27.621 --> 00:16:30.830
December of [inaudible] 97 so I'm like,
Whoa,
what am I going to do now?

273
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:36.020
One of my best friends from college was starting graduate school in the fall and

274
00:16:36.021 --> 00:16:39.770
he was about to leave for Africa.
And so I was like,
I'm coming with you.

275
00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:45.460
So I go and I get my vaccinations and within two weeks I'm on a plane and then I

276
00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:49.120
get kidnapped immediately upon landing.

277
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:50.543
<v 4>Right.
Right</v>

278
00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.810
<v 3>to attend years.
Um,</v>

279
00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:01.260
and I pull out my guitar to subway platform in Tangiers them alone at this point

280
00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:05.530
and see in northern Morocco,
he was a guy comes up to me is like,
Hey,

281
00:17:05.531 --> 00:17:08.980
you know my family plays music,
you want to come home with me?
I'm like,
great.

282
00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.100
Yeah,
sure,
why not?
I've got a day here before I'm 60,

283
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:15.100
my friend and it turns out that he's like,
he's a drug dealer.

284
00:17:15.101 --> 00:17:18.680
He locks me in this room and he these cockamamie plans where he wants me to

285
00:17:18.681 --> 00:17:21.690
distribute as drugs around America and he makes me to fish head.

286
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.760
<v 4>Very peculiar,</v>

287
00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:26.720
<v 3>but it's definitely not what,</v>

288
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.910
it's definitely not come home to my family and play guitar.

289
00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:34.120
And so I've off to a pretty rocky start in Africa and eventually he dumped me

290
00:17:34.581 --> 00:17:36.260
and says,
enough of this guy like you,

291
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.010
I'm not getting what I want to Id and just like dumps me and lets me make my way

292
00:17:40.011 --> 00:17:42.820
to the train station.
Um,
but the funny thing about it

293
00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.400
<v 4>definitely not equipped to be a proper drug dealer for me in the United States.</v>

294
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.880
<v 2>I mean what was the kind of the straw that broke the camel's back where he's</v>

295
00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:57.150
just like enough of you,
I'm letting you go.
I mean,

296
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.200
did you have an approach?
How did you get out of that?

297
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.190
<v 3>I was very confused.
I think what happened was,</v>

298
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.920
I don't think he had like begun that day saying I'm going to kidnap and
American.

299
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.540
I think it was more like he saw me sitting there,
I was like,

300
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.820
let's see what happens.
I take this guy,
right?

301
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:21.000
And then I go there and he goes through my stuff and it goes through all my

302
00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:24.420
stuff,
like looking for money and he finds that I've only got,

303
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.870
I think it was $60 in cash and there's no traveler's checks.

304
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:32.900
And fortunately I had a backpack that had like smuggling sections built into it.

305
00:18:33.841 --> 00:18:37.260
And so my passport,
um,
and like the valuable stuff were in there.

306
00:18:37.261 --> 00:18:40.860
And so I think he went through all my stuff and decided that I was like an

307
00:18:40.861 --> 00:18:44.790
itinerant traveler who was useless.
I don't know what answers I gave him,
um,

308
00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:49.290
about,
you know,
being a drug mule for him that turned them off.
But,

309
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:53.190
um,
it didn't,
it didn't work out.
It was,
it was a poor job.
Apathy,

310
00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.173
<v 2>okay,</v>

311
00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.900
<v 3>come with what I wanted.
So,
so he dumped me and got rid of me.</v>

312
00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:02.590
And then the great thing is that I then had a story.

313
00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:07.360
And so I turned that experience,
um,

314
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.500
and some other experiences I had in Africa.

315
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.640
I then spent several months traveling with my,
my friend and some other friends.

316
00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.840
I turned those into an essay,
um,
for the Washington Post's.

317
00:19:15.841 --> 00:19:20.590
So suddenly I had journalists eclipse and so kind of inadvertently hadn't been

318
00:19:20.591 --> 00:19:22.520
fired from journalism.
Um,

319
00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:27.570
I used to the experience with follow to get clips and then I came back,

320
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.030
I played guitar.
Um,

321
00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.520
and then those clips led to a job as the editor of the Washington weapon,

322
00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.860
which was a place that hired sort of young,

323
00:19:38.861 --> 00:19:42.130
ambitious people into roles with low paying roles,

324
00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.840
but high responsibility where you learn a lot.

325
00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.470
So that was how I got going in journalism.
It was very bizarre.

326
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.940
<v 2>The Washington Post or why did you end up,</v>

327
00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:58.840
was it a cold query or just a cold email to one of the editors he found on the

328
00:20:00.111 --> 00:20:05.090
masthead?
Or how did you go about getting this published?

329
00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:10.390
<v 3>I think that,
I think it was a cold query.
Um,</v>

330
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.930
I know that I had talked to some journalist before I left.

331
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.650
I remember talking to somebody from the Boston Globe.
I grew up in Boston about,

332
00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.170
you know,
it's interesting things happen to me.
Would there be,

333
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.940
would it be possible to write stories,
um,
from locations in Africa?

334
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:31.770
And so I had gotten some advice,
um,
but I think,

335
00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.013
I think

336
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:37.120
<v 2>just get kidnapped</v>

337
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:45.280
<v 3>if I got something,
my friend said to me,
he like,
well,
you know,</v>

338
00:20:45.281 --> 00:20:48.490
to have that experience and only lose dollars,
it's kind of worth it.

339
00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.300
<v 4>I wouldn't say that.
I was like so shaken by the whole thing.
I was like,</v>

340
00:20:52.301 --> 00:20:55.020
oh you jerk.
But he was totally right.
Um,

341
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:58.330
it turned out to be like a really interesting experience for a mere $60.

342
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.640
<v 2>I saw this woman in New York City at one point walking around with the tee shirt</v>

343
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.260
is the crop top that said bad decisions make good stories and they didn't quite

344
00:21:08.261 --> 00:21:11.890
know how to take the shirt like in the context of her walking around with it,

345
00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:17.230
but certainly true for standup comedians and it would see him true for

346
00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.960
people in northern Africa considering perhaps a path in journalism.

347
00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.440
Let's jump forward and I'm sure this is going to be very non linear and how we

348
00:21:29.441 --> 00:21:29.981
bounce around.

349
00:21:29.981 --> 00:21:34.981
But one of the things that I mentioned in the intro was this piece,

350
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:40.780
the greatest scape that later was turned into Argo.

351
00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.450
And when I was doing some writing on this,

352
00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:49.360
a line that jumped out at me that I wanted to dig into was at wired,

353
00:21:49.691 --> 00:21:50.740
at least at the time,

354
00:21:50.741 --> 00:21:55.741
every pitch was graded on a scale of one to six by everyone on staff and a

355
00:21:56.081 --> 00:22:01.060
there's a meeting where these story ideas or are pitched,
uh,

356
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.140
and uh,

357
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.190
or then presented rather in reverse order of their scores along with their

358
00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:10.040
standard deviations,
which is fantastic.
But uh,

359
00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:15.420
could you walk us through that pitch grading process and tell it,

360
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.770
tell us the story of the great escape.

361
00:22:20.771 --> 00:22:23.860
Because my understanding is that it wasn't a,

362
00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:29.650
it wasn't an immediate point to center field hit home run type of story.
But I,

363
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:33.150
I'm most curious in the grading process and how you guys do.

364
00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:36.040
<v 3>So that was the wired was run by this guy named Chris Anderson,</v>

365
00:22:36.041 --> 00:22:41.041
who had been the writer at the economist and just a really high Iq silicon

366
00:22:44.081 --> 00:22:49.081
valley type and a very mathematical way of looking at the world.

367
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:55.230
And so this efficiency mechanism he brought into the pitch process was to run it

368
00:22:56.891 --> 00:23:00.040
like sort of a false democracy under a dictatorship.

369
00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.290
So the final decision would be made entirely by Chris,

370
00:23:02.291 --> 00:23:05.030
whether a story with a sign or not.
But when you wrote a pitch,

371
00:23:05.031 --> 00:23:08.470
he would be sent to everybody on staff and everybody would vote on it and grade

372
00:23:08.471 --> 00:23:11.430
it.
And the theory was,
if you,

373
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.620
it was kind of a wisdom of crowds theory that if you've got everybody's vote,

374
00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.540
you could immediately tell what was great and what was bad and that I think he

375
00:23:19.541 --> 00:23:20.440
genuinely believed that.

376
00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:24.940
One of the things that happens in meetings is that you spend a lot of time

377
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.020
discussing stuff that 95% of the room hates.

378
00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:34.360
But since only a couple people talk,
you can't quite determine that quickly.

379
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:38.410
And so this is a way of determining what is the stuff that 95% of the room loves

380
00:23:38.411 --> 00:23:42.220
and 95% of the room hates immediately,
which is a super interesting thing,
right?

381
00:23:42.221 --> 00:23:43.960
It's like theoretically a great thing to do.

382
00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:49.140
But problem with that is that it can be really demoralizing when your pitches do

383
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.630
badly,
but it's okay to get your picture Jackie by the editor in chief.

384
00:23:53.631 --> 00:23:55.010
But to have your pitch,
you know,

385
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:58.100
graded badly by all your colleagues was kind of mostly rough.

386
00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.430
So for the great escape,
I remember this really well.

387
00:24:01.431 --> 00:24:03.390
So just writer Joshua Bear who's,

388
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:05.680
he's like great stuff for this American life is here,

389
00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:08.250
all kinds of wonderful essays.
He was a little,
you know,

390
00:24:08.251 --> 00:24:12.560
we're quite a bit younger then.
Um,
I remember he sent me a bunch of pitches.

391
00:24:12.561 --> 00:24:15.140
I can't remember what the whole packet was,
maybe somebody,
three ideas,

392
00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.430
but one was,

393
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.750
and at the spy he's got the story of a crazy escape from Iran.

394
00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:25.670
And then another one I remember on the same email was,
uh,
I think stolen,

395
00:24:25.671 --> 00:24:27.830
tried to create a half man,
half ape army.

396
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:30.913
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

397
00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.470
<v 3>And so like the two things were together,</v>

398
00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:34.640
like should we investigate Stalin's half man,
half of,

399
00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:38.560
of army or should we investigate like this escape from Iran.

400
00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:42.360
And so through whatever process of conversations between editor and writer dress

401
00:24:42.361 --> 00:24:47.361
and I decided to pursue the escape from Iran and I pitched it at the meeting and

402
00:24:48.101 --> 00:24:51.280
I knew it was going to do badly.
Right.
Cause it wasn't a wired story.
Right.

403
00:24:51.281 --> 00:24:55.540
It's like from the 1970s,
um,
it's not about,

404
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.711
you know,

405
00:24:56.711 --> 00:25:00.820
how Amazon and artificial intelligence chickens and I was just wasn't core
wired.

406
00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:05.110
Um,
and it's,
everybody voted it really badly.
Right?
The scores are one to six.

407
00:25:05.111 --> 00:25:09.700
It probably got a score of 10 is something on the other hand,

408
00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:12.370
Bob Cohen,
who was the executive editor,
the number two person there,

409
00:25:12.371 --> 00:25:15.520
I remember it,
the pitch meeting just being like,
it's not wired but I love it.

410
00:25:15.521 --> 00:25:18.600
Let's do it.
And so he just sort of muscled it through.
So again,

411
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.630
it was democracy under a dictatorship and the dictators,
uh,

412
00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:25.630
wanting to do the story,
um,
because it was such a cool,
so manifestly,

413
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:29.980
you know,
riveting narrative.
So we ended up assigning it.
Josh wrote it,

414
00:25:29.981 --> 00:25:33.730
did a great job,
um,
published it,
and then Hollywood took an interest.

415
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:38.303
<v 2>What makes it good?</v>

416
00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.460
Let's just assume for the time being,
it was a good set of,

417
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:49.670
this is going to sound funny to people who don't have the background,

418
00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:53.830
but we could talk more about stolen anyway.
Leave that alone for now.

419
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.290
<v 3>Well,
like there was a real missed opportunity.</v>

420
00:25:57.291 --> 00:25:59.970
Like we would have found out there wasn't a half man,
half a farm.

421
00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:00.813
It could be an amazing,

422
00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:05.790
<v 2>not only that,
but you have a,
correct me if I'm wrong,
just from the Internet.</v>

423
00:26:05.791 --> 00:26:10.050
So who knows?
But a long friendship with Stalin's daughter,

424
00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:11.060
is that right?

425
00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.800
<v 3>Yeah,
that is,
that is,
that is very true.
Happy to talk about that.
Yes.</v>

426
00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:15.240
That line and I were friends from many,
many

427
00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:23.290
<v 2>blip with putting aside the half man,
half ape army of stolen question mark.
What,</v>

428
00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:28.260
what makes a good pitch?
If a,
if a writer is pitching someone like you,

429
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:33.450
uh,
what,
what is a good pitch look like?
What are the,
what are the ingredients?

430
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.760
What are common mistakes that make something a bad pitch?

431
00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:37.880
However you want to kind of answer that for folks.
Yeah.

432
00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:42.060
<v 3>Yep.
So a couple of elements that I appreciate our,
when the writer gives options,</v>

433
00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:46.290
right?
So what Josh done in that email is he had sent three ideas,

434
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.760
which I think is really great,
right?

435
00:26:47.761 --> 00:26:49.830
And it's useful to be able to pick and it gives you a sense of the person's

436
00:26:49.831 --> 00:26:50.664
reinjured mind.

437
00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:54.810
Another element that's very useful is the element of pitch that answers the

438
00:26:54.811 --> 00:26:58.980
question,
why am I the person to do this?
So in Josh has pitched,

439
00:26:58.981 --> 00:27:02.760
the reason he was the person to do it is that he had found something that no one

440
00:27:02.761 --> 00:27:07.110
had known before and to um,
had unique access to the key character,
right.

441
00:27:07.111 --> 00:27:10.980
Had access to the spine.
Tony Mendez,
I think this was his neck.
Um,

442
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.090
so that's another important element.

443
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:17.300
And then the third is understanding what the magazine is trying to do in this

444
00:27:17.751 --> 00:27:18.810
section you're trying to write for him.

445
00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:23.670
So what wired was trying to do and it's feature well then as now was tell really

446
00:27:23.671 --> 00:27:25.740
important stories about how technology is changing the world,

447
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.570
but also tell things that are cinematic and fun to read and that are part of the

448
00:27:30.571 --> 00:27:33.930
wired world.
So this story,
you know,

449
00:27:33.931 --> 00:27:36.960
the great escape wasn't going to change the way you think about tech,

450
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:41.160
but it had characters,
right?
It had emotional residence.

451
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:45.300
It had like there was a movie you could play in your mind is you have Ben

452
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.250
Affleck later show without question.
Um,

453
00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:49.770
and that's often a question I'll ask you the story.

454
00:27:49.771 --> 00:27:51.420
So how will there be to be able to visualize it?

455
00:27:51.421 --> 00:27:52.920
How will they be emotionally attached to it?

456
00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:55.870
Why will they care about the characters you introduced at the beginning of what

457
00:27:55.871 --> 00:27:56.790
happens to them at the end?

458
00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.470
So a good pitch is something where you're writing in a way that makes the editor

459
00:28:01.471 --> 00:28:03.240
convinced that you'll be able to write well,

460
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:07.290
it shows why you have special knowledge or special insight or special access

461
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:11.340
that shows why the story is new and that,
you know,
is structured.

462
00:28:11.341 --> 00:28:12.174
So that the fit club,

463
00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:16.500
that pitch clearly fits the aims and goals of the magazine or publication you're

464
00:28:16.501 --> 00:28:17.334
writing for

465
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:26.440
<v 2>or is it just assumed a given lengths or a lead time for completion?</v>

466
00:28:27.441 --> 00:28:31.770
Is any of that included in that initial pictures that,
does that come,

467
00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:34.260
does that come later or is it just,
yeah,

468
00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:39.490
<v 3>but public comes later.
Um,
if it's somebody who I've worked with specifically,</v>

469
00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:43.670
um,
they may say,
hey,
I'd like to do this,
um,

470
00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:47.750
this month or I want to fit it into my calendar.
Or you know,

471
00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:51.460
I'm planning to go to location TK in June and I could do at Penn.

472
00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:55.810
But normally it's more like this is a story I'd like to do in the next

473
00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.950
reasonable timeframe.

474
00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:02.290
<v 2>So just want to back up for a second.
For people who don't know what TK means,</v>

475
00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:07.950
as I understand it means to come,

476
00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:12.810
but it's spelled t k so that you can find it very easily when you search for it.

477
00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:17.170
That's my understanding at least.
And yes,

478
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:21.990
because very few words in the English language have t and K so you can do a

479
00:29:21.991 --> 00:29:25.470
control f and find the things that you need to spot really quickly.

480
00:29:25.471 --> 00:29:29.610
So for people who are wondering why TK,
uh,
you know,
a friend of mine,

481
00:29:29.611 --> 00:29:30.570
Neil Strauss,
uh,

482
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:35.780
will turn off his Wifi when he writes and not interrupted for fact checking and

483
00:29:36.061 --> 00:29:39.060
certain types of research and just drop TK and throughout the piece and then do

484
00:29:39.061 --> 00:29:43.540
that as a batching process later just for people.
Yeah.

485
00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:45.460
So for people who are wondering about that,
uh,

486
00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:50.120
he also uses an APP called freedom to block the Internet so that he can be

487
00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:53.620
disruptive.
So it's a good thing to do.

488
00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:58.720
So now you just described Chris Anderson's process,

489
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.470
which fits his personality and I've met Chris before.
Very smart guy.

490
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:04.270
What is your process?

491
00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:08.110
How does your story pitch process differ?

492
00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:11.300
<v 3>Pretty similar actually.
I mean,</v>

493
00:30:11.301 --> 00:30:13.280
we've gotten rid of the score isn't the standard deviations.

494
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.410
I thought that probably

495
00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:20.660
a little bit too much stress and unnecessary anxiety for people.
Um,

496
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:24.410
but there is value to it.

497
00:30:24.411 --> 00:30:27.230
I can see what we do is a similar process.

498
00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.080
So the writer will work with an editor and they'll come up with a pitch.

499
00:30:30.081 --> 00:30:33.080
We try to make sure that they're under the page just to respect everybody's
time.

500
00:30:33.081 --> 00:30:37.700
And because constraints lead to better work in general.

501
00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:40.310
Um,
so people send in a one page pitch,

502
00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:43.870
we sit around in a room and lots of people are invited,
editor,

503
00:30:43.871 --> 00:30:45.860
the editors will be signing.
The story's kind of sit around.

504
00:30:45.861 --> 00:30:49.010
The main table story comes up and we talk about it.

505
00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.590
We talk about what are the unanswered questions?
Well,
the writer,

506
00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.810
he be able to do that.

507
00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:57.820
<v 2>What are the unanswered questions?
Sorry to interrupt.</v>

508
00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.420
<v 3>Like a lot,
a lot of pitches will,
um,</v>

509
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:05.610
there'll be missing that element of how,

510
00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.820
of what the scenes will actually be and who,

511
00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:13.050
how the characters will develop,
right?
It's like,
here's a big idea.

512
00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.810
Here's an important thing that happened and I'm going to write 5,000 words about

513
00:31:15.811 --> 00:31:16.200
it.

514
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.860
And there's almost no thing that is big or important enough that you can write

515
00:31:19.861 --> 00:31:24.180
5,000 words about it if you don't have like specific scenes and visual moments

516
00:31:24.181 --> 00:31:25.860
where you can pull a person in.
And again,

517
00:31:25.861 --> 00:31:28.140
this is for wired features track and we run like web stories.

518
00:31:28.141 --> 00:31:29.790
We have a much more informal process.

519
00:31:29.791 --> 00:31:31.920
We weren't short things in front of book where there's a more informal process,

520
00:31:31.921 --> 00:31:35.820
but you know,
we only run four features a month,
48 of them a year.

521
00:31:35.821 --> 00:31:40.130
So we do discuss them all and whether,
you know,

522
00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.420
there'll be able to pull it off and how will the chronology work.

523
00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:46.080
And then there's a lot of discussions about the writers because an incredibly

524
00:31:46.081 --> 00:31:48.420
talented magazine feature writer,

525
00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:51.210
sort of a subset of ideas.

526
00:31:51.211 --> 00:31:54.390
They could write about it as a lot larger than somebody with more limited skills

527
00:31:54.391 --> 00:31:58.380
and experience in this particular cracked.
Um,
so we'll talk about,
okay,

528
00:31:58.381 --> 00:32:00.660
well what have you read by this person?
Or I remember reading that story,

529
00:32:00.661 --> 00:32:03.360
I didn't take it totally worked or I read that story.
It did work very quick,

530
00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:05.670
quite well.
So that's how it works.

531
00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.590
We all talk about it and then afterwards I'll speak with the executive editor,

532
00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:12.420
a couple of other editors,
and we'll make a decision.
Red Light,
green light,

533
00:32:12.421 --> 00:32:13.254
red light,
green light.

534
00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.570
<v 2>We're going to talk about,</v>

535
00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:27.620
I'm going to tie it in here because my understanding is that you've had a decent

536
00:32:29.621 --> 00:32:34.621
amount of exposure to two feature pieces being optioned for film and Argo or

537
00:32:38.261 --> 00:32:43.110
rather the great which then became Argos is one such example.
Uh,

538
00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:48.230
a lot of,
a lot of writers dream of having things optioned.

539
00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.720
It's by the coach.
My questions I suppose,
are a,

540
00:32:50.721 --> 00:32:55.721
is it a dream worth having a or is it just almost uniformly disappointing,

541
00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:01.130
uh,
or somewhere in between.
And then B,
if you,

542
00:33:01.131 --> 00:33:03.890
if you were having something option of yours,

543
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.740
what are the deal points or this the,

544
00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:08.930
the deal structures that you would pay attention to?

545
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:15.100
<v 3>Oh,
that's interesting.
Um,</v>

546
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:20.263
before

547
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:25.530
I started getting a reputation as a place where stories were optioned and has

548
00:33:25.531 --> 00:33:29.220
had a good amount of success in the activist,

549
00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:33.900
which we started in 2009 has had success from the get go.

550
00:33:33.901 --> 00:33:37.080
I mean it's something like 25% of the stories that had run in the out of his

551
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:41.280
tablet option to Hollywood,
which is a crazy,
crazy percentage.
Maybe it's 30%.

552
00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:45.720
Um,
and so is it a dream worth?

553
00:33:45.721 --> 00:33:47.910
Having the effort is a dream of having,
um,

554
00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:51.870
the most important thing is having a good agent who has actually sold films

555
00:33:51.871 --> 00:33:54.570
before.
Not like a lot of writers,

556
00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:00.840
don't know the right agents and having the right agent just as utterly

557
00:34:00.841 --> 00:34:03.180
transformative.
It takes you from,
you know,

558
00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:06.360
almost no chance to a very good chance.
Um,

559
00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:10.380
so having an agent who has actually had success selling magazine stories at

560
00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:11.580
Highland for is really important.

561
00:34:11.910 --> 00:34:16.020
And so what we did at the atmos as we just started out with the agent who had

562
00:34:16.021 --> 00:34:19.710
had a lot of access to the same guy that we had used at,
um,
that I,

563
00:34:19.711 --> 00:34:23.280
that my cofounder had around a little bit of writer for wired and that I had

564
00:34:23.281 --> 00:34:26.250
used at,
um,
at wired.
And so we just brought them in with the,
out of this,

565
00:34:26.251 --> 00:34:29.320
from the,
from the Gecko or from fairly early on.
Um,

566
00:34:29.490 --> 00:34:33.660
and then when you're looking at the deal points,
um,
you know,
what you want is,

567
00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:34.170
you know,

568
00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:37.140
there's a whole series of stages along the way where you get different paths,

569
00:34:37.141 --> 00:34:37.321
right?

570
00:34:37.321 --> 00:34:40.290
You get an initial amount of money and then you get certain renewals and then if

571
00:34:40.291 --> 00:34:41.940
the script is written and then at the movie was made.

572
00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:47.480
And so what you want are you want to make sure that high quality people are sort

573
00:34:47.681 --> 00:34:51.450
of being added at each step so that it's more likely to move from a to B to c to

574
00:34:51.451 --> 00:34:55.260
d.
Um,
and that you,
um,

575
00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:58.800
you don't kind of fall for the,
um,

576
00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:03.540
the dream where it's like,
alright,
we'll give you $1,000 now,
but $1 million,

577
00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.530
we make it.
Um,
and there's almost no chance we'll make it right.

578
00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:10.650
You want to make sure that you get paid real money upfront because even a really

579
00:35:10.651 --> 00:35:13.500
good script with really good people attached to it as a fairly low percentage of

580
00:35:13.501 --> 00:35:14.334
chance of getting through.

581
00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:21.050
<v 2>Certainly it seems that way.
Yet there are some that make it through</v>

582
00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:24.820
the greatest scape,
for instance.

583
00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:30.270
What are there any other clauses that are particularly important?
And I,

584
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:33.610
I've never,
I've had for the first book that I did,

585
00:35:33.611 --> 00:35:38.190
I've had folks approach me about film adaptation.

586
00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:40.590
Um,
but it,
it seemed like

587
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:41.903
<v 0>sh</v>

588
00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.620
<v 2>it least in the structures that are being offered,</v>

589
00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.040
it was very much a lockup period with almost no monetary compensation with no

590
00:35:50.831 --> 00:35:52.960
guarantee that they would actually do anything with it.

591
00:35:52.961 --> 00:35:57.550
In the sense that the reversion of rights clause became really important to

592
00:35:57.551 --> 00:35:58.150
consider.

593
00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:02.320
Much like if you're a product developer or an inventor and you develop something

594
00:36:02.321 --> 00:36:04.270
that you want to license to a larger company,

595
00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:10.260
there's nothing compelling them to spend marketing dollars on it or to develop

596
00:36:10.301 --> 00:36:15.301
it or push it in less or I should say you increase the likelihood of that if you

597
00:36:15.431 --> 00:36:20.200
have that dictated in the terms of the contract and then some reversion of

598
00:36:20.201 --> 00:36:21.790
rights clause.
Right.
So,

599
00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:26.890
I suppose what I'm wondering is how much time in your mind do you allow for a

600
00:36:26.891 --> 00:36:31.891
story to float out there in the ether of say Hollywood before you can you pull

601
00:36:35.131 --> 00:36:36.960
it back in some fashion or,

602
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:41.280
or allow it to take a different path?
Potentially.

603
00:36:41.281 --> 00:36:44.910
Because I know friends who are writers who've had stuff just float around and

604
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:46.290
So-and-so's attached,
but oh no,

605
00:36:46.291 --> 00:36:48.770
they're not attached because they're busy and then when this person's attached,

606
00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:52.770
no,
they're not because they had a conflict and it just goes on and on and on for

607
00:36:52.771 --> 00:36:56.310
years and years and years.
Is there any,
yeah.
Any,

608
00:36:56.430 --> 00:37:00.240
any ways that you've found to mitigate against that in any way?

609
00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:02.640
<v 3>Yeah,
so I'm not,
you know,</v>

610
00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:05.710
this is not my area of topics for you spend a couple of things.
One,

611
00:37:05.711 --> 00:37:10.711
I think that the value before you publish and before you put up for auction,

612
00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.950
locking a few things down is really important.

613
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:18.130
Making sure you have the life rights to the central character that you

614
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:22.720
negotiated.
You know,
in the example in the Argo story,

615
00:37:22.721 --> 00:37:27.721
it was really important that Josh had locked up rights to Tony men as a story so

616
00:37:28.241 --> 00:37:30.520
that,
um,
after the story ran,

617
00:37:30.521 --> 00:37:35.521
it wasn't like somebody else could do the same story but without Josh attached

618
00:37:36.101 --> 00:37:38.720
to it because Josh and Tony came as a package.
Um,

619
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:40.630
and so they had negotiated a deal together.

620
00:37:40.631 --> 00:37:44.830
And so that's a really important thing to make sure that you have as much as you

621
00:37:44.831 --> 00:37:45.490
can,

622
00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:48.910
the rights to that particular story buttoned up because it gives you just much

623
00:37:48.911 --> 00:37:52.120
more leverage if potential bidders are like,
mm,
you know,

624
00:37:52.121 --> 00:37:54.400
I can probably do this without nick.
Um,

625
00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:57.160
or I can probably do this without buying the rights to make story because it's

626
00:37:57.161 --> 00:38:01.270
public domain or so talking to an agent and working through that I think is

627
00:38:01.271 --> 00:38:04.720
really important.
And then just knowing that,
you know,

628
00:38:04.721 --> 00:38:09.721
there's no part of the world where people kind of tell more baloney stories

629
00:38:11.771 --> 00:38:15.340
about how this is about the stars that are coming into Hollywood.

630
00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:19.860
Like there's so many,
oh yes.
You know,
we'll attack Francis Ford Coppola,
right.

631
00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:23.800
Well let's do this.
We'll do that and they're not lying.
It's just never true

632
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:28.690
<v 2>to have it written down.
I think what people get caught,
right,</v>

633
00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.270
<v 3>they sort of fall for that and what you need to do is you need to have an agent,</v>

634
00:38:32.271 --> 00:38:34.880
you need to have an auction,
you need to have a formal process,

635
00:38:34.881 --> 00:38:38.230
you to get more than one person excited and you got two people bidding.

636
00:38:38.231 --> 00:38:42.070
Then you have much more leverage on making sure that you get terms where you get

637
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.130
either a decent amount of money or a pretty good guarantee that will be made.

638
00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.730
What we did at the atmos just we ultimately set up a first look deal.

639
00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:53.200
I mean we work with a Hollywood studio that pays us an annual guarantee every

640
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:57.220
year to be able to read the stories before everybody else and to have the

641
00:38:57.221 --> 00:39:01.420
opportunity to bid on them and so that was a way of getting guaranteed income,

642
00:39:01.421 --> 00:39:05.890
making sure that somebody who was interested and kind of locking the process in

643
00:39:05.891 --> 00:39:07.000
a way that worked for us.

644
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.610
<v 2>That's great.
Yeah,
that's very smart.
I didn't,
didn't realize that.</v>

645
00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:15.610
For people who are wondering,
agent,
agent,
agent,
agent,
how do I get an agent?

646
00:39:15.611 --> 00:39:18.380
How do I figure out who the agents are?
I'd love to hear it.

647
00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:19.990
I'd love to hear your thoughts.

648
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:24.760
A very good starting place is to in my experience,

649
00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:26.070
sign up for IMD,

650
00:39:26.071 --> 00:39:31.071
be pro and look at the credits of different films that you've enjoyed,

651
00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:37.510
uh,
or perhaps screenplays,
uh,
that,
uh,

652
00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:41.230
that you might be interested in and try to trace back the roots of that way.

653
00:39:41.231 --> 00:39:46.060
I am DB then provides say contact information for different actors,

654
00:39:46.061 --> 00:39:49.900
directors and so on and you'll start to see certain names that pop up a lot like

655
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:53.950
William Morris Endeavor,
WME,
CAA,
creative artist,
agency,

656
00:39:53.951 --> 00:39:57.690
UTA and so on.
Uh,
but uh,

657
00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:00.760
would you have any other recommendations for people who want to educate

658
00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:05.080
themselves about that side of the business per se?

659
00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:08.940
<v 3>I only have a recommendation would be to find friends or friends of friends who</v>

660
00:40:08.941 --> 00:40:12.560
have actually had success and say who sold it.
Right.
I didn't,

661
00:40:12.561 --> 00:40:15.390
I do this much more in the book publishing world where a higher percentage of my

662
00:40:15.391 --> 00:40:20.070
friends have sold books where you know,
you,
I know you sold the book,

663
00:40:20.071 --> 00:40:22.950
what agent did you use and would you recommend him or her?
Um,

664
00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:25.290
and then if you've got five people who full books,

665
00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:28.170
you ask them all a couple of names to come up and you'd go and meet with them,

666
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:31.470
see who you click with,
who you get at a good bond.
We're having the best,

667
00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:31.951
you know,

668
00:40:31.951 --> 00:40:35.100
the best possible agent is somebody who has a track record and who actually

669
00:40:35.101 --> 00:40:36.210
likes you and cares about you.

670
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:39.480
And sometimes those things are kind of like inversely related cause they have a

671
00:40:39.481 --> 00:40:41.460
track record,
they have so many clients,
they're not going to care about you.

672
00:40:41.461 --> 00:40:45.900
So you just kind of figure out how to find somebody who was both good and

673
00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:46.763
responsive.

674
00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:54.760
<v 2>So on a segway to the New Yorker for probably more than a few minutes here,</v>

675
00:40:56.750 --> 00:41:01.620
I find the New Yorker fascinating as I do wired.
But uh,

676
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:06.920
in a,
uh,
it was 2015 interview you'd said.

677
00:41:06.921 --> 00:41:09.410
And again,
fact,
fact correct as needed.

678
00:41:09.411 --> 00:41:12.890
But the most encouraging thing we found is that the stories were prouder of the

679
00:41:12.891 --> 00:41:16.970
stores.
We put more effort into attract more readers.
So the,

680
00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:23.150
I'd love to talk about
what that means,

681
00:41:23.151 --> 00:41:26.180
if you could elaborate on that.
Because as someone who

682
00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.630
personally speaking for myself,

683
00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:34.960
enjoys long form content and make some to resist the temptation to listicle

684
00:41:37.071 --> 00:41:41.300
myself to death in hopes of eyeballs and clicks.
What,
what,

685
00:41:41.301 --> 00:41:46.070
what did that mean and how did you foster that at the magazine

686
00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:57.800
<v 3>debates at the New Yorker on the print side when we really didn't,</v>

687
00:41:58.021 --> 00:42:02.400
when the magazine hadn't put a lot of effort into having an ambitious daily

688
00:42:02.401 --> 00:42:06.720
website at the website of New York are mostly just published the print stories

689
00:42:06.721 --> 00:42:09.510
and some of them are buying a paywall in,
some of them were not.
Um,

690
00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:12.990
and then as part of this process where David became David Remnick to get much

691
00:42:12.991 --> 00:42:16.410
more excited about daily journalism and the importance of having a website,

692
00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:21.180
having Ventura was moved over to run the website,
um,
work with a bunch of people.

693
00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:25.200
And so the initial challenge was,

694
00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:28.860
you know,
can you publish daily content?

695
00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.950
I think it's the magazine is put together by some many people with so much

696
00:42:31.951 --> 00:42:33.220
experience.
And you know,

697
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:37.800
the website was this kind of startup within the organization where you have to

698
00:42:37.801 --> 00:42:40.620
be a lot scrappier.
You're paying people,
you know,

699
00:42:40.621 --> 00:42:43.890
a New Yorker writer will get several dollars a word to write 5,000 words.

700
00:42:43.891 --> 00:42:45.870
So you're looking at $15,000 a story.

701
00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:48.630
And on the website you're looking at $200 a story.

702
00:42:48.631 --> 00:42:53.631
So can you produce content for that $200 that won't sort of detract from the

703
00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:57.690
other stuff.
And that's a challenge,
right?

704
00:42:57.691 --> 00:42:58.880
And you have to figure out what is the deal?

705
00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:05.200
Maybe 800 words,
you know,
a thousand words.
I mean,

706
00:43:05.201 --> 00:43:08.800
that was actually interesting conversation.
Like if you make 300 words,
you know,

707
00:43:08.801 --> 00:43:13.180
will it actually detract more,
um,
that it can make it 800 words.
You should,

708
00:43:13.181 --> 00:43:16.800
you make the web stories more like the long print stories or last light,

709
00:43:16.801 --> 00:43:20.470
the long prince stories.
And so there's a lot of back and forth.

710
00:43:20.471 --> 00:43:25.390
This is kind of the central debate in my mind for several years.
Right?

711
00:43:25.391 --> 00:43:30.391
How do you make daily web content that feels of a piece with the New Yorker

712
00:43:31.091 --> 00:43:35.170
magazine has and it's been around for 85 years and has such an incredible

713
00:43:35.171 --> 00:43:40.030
history and such great stories.
Um,
and so back to the initial question,
over time,

714
00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:45.600
we found that what got the most readership that work to the best in every sense,

715
00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:50.440
we're smart pieces of analysis of what was happening right now,

716
00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.230
ideally written by the same people who wrote for the magazine.

717
00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:57.230
And they would spend far less time per word on their web post and they were for

718
00:43:57.231 --> 00:44:00.640
the magazine stairs,
but they would feel related.
They feel other piece.

719
00:44:00.641 --> 00:44:01.150
If you know,

720
00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:05.260
Philip Duravit wrote a web piece about a terror attack that it just happened,

721
00:44:05.261 --> 00:44:08.560
it would feel enough like a Philip very of its magazine feature and the readers

722
00:44:08.561 --> 00:44:09.730
would appreciate it.

723
00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:14.290
And so ultimately our strategy became getting the staff writers to write regular

724
00:44:14.291 --> 00:44:18.820
posts,
hiring people who could write very quickly,
um,
could write it,

725
00:44:18.821 --> 00:44:20.980
the cadence of the web,
um,

726
00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:25.600
but who had similar pro styles to the New Yorker staff,
writers moving,
um,

727
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:26.740
John Cassidy for example,

728
00:44:26.741 --> 00:44:29.440
who was a magazine that better right to call them every day for the website,

729
00:44:29.441 --> 00:44:30.274
which is great.

730
00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:35.120
Really able to have to know that every day you have a terrific column by the

731
00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.500
Super Smart,
well respected guy.
Uh,

732
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:40.860
same with Amy Davidson who had been a senior editor,
so bringing over people,

733
00:44:40.861 --> 00:44:42.990
bringing in new people,
getting some of the staff writers.

734
00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:47.580
And what we found was that that the stuff people liked was the best stuff we

735
00:44:47.581 --> 00:44:49.320
published.
And that was really heartening.

736
00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:52.260
Like people didn't want to go to [inaudible] dot com to read,

737
00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:56.610
to sort of click through.
Um,
yeah,
sensationalized light shows.

738
00:44:56.611 --> 00:44:59.190
They wanted to come to New York or to read smart,
interesting things.

739
00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:03.150
And that was great because when you're business incentives aligned with your

740
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:06.070
sort of journalistic incentives,
you're in a much happier place.

741
00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:09.630
And if the two are sort of run perpendicular to each other,

742
00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:15.570
<v 2>I would love to get your health encouraging people to do more long form.</v>

743
00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:16.760
And by people,

744
00:45:16.761 --> 00:45:21.761
I mean publishers to foster that type is going a patient editorial and in some

745
00:45:23.301 --> 00:45:27.950
cases.
And so I'm going to make this really personal.

746
00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:30.380
I've thought a lot about

747
00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:39.130
hiring writers to do longer form pieces for my blog for instance,

748
00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:45.560
which does not have the draw or cachet of the New Yorker certainly or wired,

749
00:45:45.561 --> 00:45:47.670
but nonetheless decent amount of traffic.
You know,

750
00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:50.900
I had a couple of million people,
a couple,
couple of million uniques per month.

751
00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:52.610
And uh,

752
00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:55.850
I think what struck me when I was trying to think through this as someone who

753
00:45:55.851 --> 00:46:00.020
loves long form is that I didn't know the process.

754
00:46:00.021 --> 00:46:01.040
It's harder,

755
00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:06.140
it's more of a black box than trying to put together a list of 12 bullets or a

756
00:46:06.141 --> 00:46:08.150
slide show,
which I'm not going to say it's mindless,

757
00:46:08.151 --> 00:46:11.990
but it really doesn't require a lot of planning.
So if for instance,

758
00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:15.390
I wanted to,
uh,

759
00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:20.440
I had ideas for certain pieces and wanted to invite people who had ideas for

760
00:46:21.261 --> 00:46:24.320
pieces,
who were qualified writers to do,

761
00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:28.480
let's just call it three to 10,000 word pieces,
right?

762
00:46:28.481 --> 00:46:31.050
It's a very broad spectrum.
What,

763
00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:36.070
what is the process then for figuring out how much I should pay someone a in a

764
00:46:36.531 --> 00:46:40.580
context like that?
Because you,
you noted yourself,
there's kind of a very wide,

765
00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:44.240
uh,
there's very wide

766
00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.900
spectrum of a thing that just used that twice in like three sentences.

767
00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:53.750
So shame on me.
But nonetheless,
uh,
in terms of payment per word,

768
00:46:53.751 --> 00:46:56.450
I don't even know how that works because I've never done it.

769
00:46:56.451 --> 00:47:00.470
But how would you think about going about doing something like this?

770
00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:03.350
If I wanted to do an experiment of like three to five pieces with different

771
00:47:03.351 --> 00:47:07.550
writers and see how it goes,
uh,
how would you suggest I even think about this?

772
00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:11.180
You have so much experience and I have none because everything on the blog with

773
00:47:11.181 --> 00:47:13.820
a few rare exceptions have been my own stuff.

774
00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:16.340
<v 3>Yeah,
that's a really interesting question.</v>

775
00:47:16.341 --> 00:47:21.140
It's kind of like what we went through it,
the animus.
So first you could say,

776
00:47:21.141 --> 00:47:24.130
all right,
well how much advertising revenue will I get?
Um,

777
00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.190
and so you can do the math,
right?
So let's say you have,
you would get

778
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:33.510
50,000 people might read this story,
that's a lot.
But you know,
you,
you know,

779
00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:37.090
through your social promotion and to general traffic to the site,

780
00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:42.130
so 50,000 people or read the story,
um,
you will be able to sell your ads.

781
00:47:42.131 --> 00:47:43.270
Like whatever CPM you sell,

782
00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:47.860
let's say $15 per thousand visitors.

783
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:51.100
Um,
and you know,

784
00:47:51.101 --> 00:47:55.420
you'll be able to show four ads per person,
you know,

785
00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:59.680
one quarter of the people will be turning on ad blockers.
So we'll say three,

786
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:03.970
um,
and,
um,

787
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:06.340
how much revenue you generate in total,
right?

788
00:48:06.341 --> 00:48:08.050
And so you can go through those calculations,
right?

789
00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:10.350
You figure out what is your sell through rate on the advertising plays.
You see,

790
00:48:10.351 --> 00:48:14.500
do you have of the right?
And the problem is when you do that,
right,

791
00:48:14.501 --> 00:48:17.230
if you add those numbers up,
you're going to end up with,
you know,

792
00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:21.190
generating for your story.
That has a couple of ads ads do you per person,

793
00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:22.150
because that's people,

794
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:26.650
you're gonna end up generating like $2,000 in total revenue for the story.
Right?

795
00:48:26.651 --> 00:48:29.590
It just,
the numbers are just not good.
Um,

796
00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:33.790
and so if you have an advertising supported longform journalism shop,

797
00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:38.920
it's really hard to pay for the writer and the editor,
the rights to the art.
Um,

798
00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:42.600
and sort of the bandwidth.
It's a really hard thing to justify.

799
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:46.180
And that's something we thought through a lot at the New Yorker and a wire.

800
00:48:46.181 --> 00:48:47.710
And if the activist,
okay,

801
00:48:47.711 --> 00:48:50.050
so how do you make the economics work if you're only going to generate,
you know,

802
00:48:50.051 --> 00:48:53.200
sometimes it's a couple hundred dollars in advertising revenue,
like what,

803
00:48:53.201 --> 00:48:56.080
what can you do?
Well,
the New Yorker and wire,
there's a second revenue stream,

804
00:48:56.081 --> 00:48:57.310
which is subscriptions,
right?

805
00:48:57.311 --> 00:49:02.290
And so you generate way more money from subscriptions on these long form stories

806
00:49:02.291 --> 00:49:03.124
than you do from Africa.

807
00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:06.140
So suddenly the amount of total amount of revenue generated by a long story is

808
00:49:06.141 --> 00:49:08.680
much higher,
right?
So suddenly you're generating,
you know,

809
00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:13.270
$4,000 for a story or $5,000 for a story or whatever it is,

810
00:49:13.271 --> 00:49:15.580
and you can justify paying higher rates.

811
00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:20.260
The third way of making money is like find another thing.
So the activist,

812
00:49:20.261 --> 00:49:24.190
it was Hollywood,
right,
where we could end up,
we would pay writers,

813
00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:28.840
I think we would pay them.
Um,
well we had two different models,

814
00:49:28.841 --> 00:49:33.010
but you end up being able to pay them much better rates because you know,

815
00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:36.490
if they agreed that they will give you 50% of the option price if they sell it

816
00:49:36.491 --> 00:49:40.690
to Hollywood.
So we would bake that into our contracts.
Like you know,

817
00:49:40.691 --> 00:49:44.620
either we can pay you $2,000 to this story and you can keep all the rights,

818
00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:45.400
the Hollywood rides,

819
00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:50.400
or we can pay you $10,000 and give us 50% of the Hollywood money and then the

820
00:49:50.681 --> 00:49:51.940
writer and generally,

821
00:49:51.941 --> 00:49:54.430
which choose the second option to get the higher guaranteed payments so they can

822
00:49:54.431 --> 00:49:56.950
justify spending all the time on it.
So with you,

823
00:49:56.951 --> 00:50:00.190
you might want to think through something like that or think through whether

824
00:50:00.191 --> 00:50:03.190
there's another revenue stream you can attach to or whether it's being part of

825
00:50:03.191 --> 00:50:07.420
events or something like that or find a specific sponsor for a kind of story.

826
00:50:07.421 --> 00:50:11.950
But that's how I would think through the economics of how to,
how to support it.

827
00:50:11.951 --> 00:50:12.430
But again,

828
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:16.390
the core problem and the reason why it's really hard for publications to do long

829
00:50:16.391 --> 00:50:18.810
form is that you know,

830
00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:23.820
it takes a writer two months to write a story that will get 50,000 readers and

831
00:50:24.641 --> 00:50:26.510
if you have that right or putting out listicles,

832
00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.790
they'll be able to generate three of them a day,

833
00:50:28.791 --> 00:50:30.740
each of which will get 25,000 readers.

834
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:35.420
And it's sort of the bang for the buck equation unless you change the economics

835
00:50:35.421 --> 00:50:37.700
somehow by having six depends on new deals or something else.

836
00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:41.030
All the economic incentives push people towards short stuff.

837
00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:50.170
<v 2>Odd position maybe in the sense that I don't,
I don't have advertising,</v>

838
00:50:50.171 --> 00:50:51.310
I don't have memberships.

839
00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:55.180
I there's a possibility I could do something with Hollywood optioning.

840
00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:00.600
There are just stories that I would love to have told and characters I know who

841
00:51:01.601 --> 00:51:06.130
are just endlessly to me at least fascinating who I don't have.

842
00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.290
I don't have current bandwidth,

843
00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:13.320
maybe even the capability to do justice in a really long form piece and I would

844
00:51:14.381 --> 00:51:18.010
love to just,
I want to just see it in the world and pay them to do that.

845
00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:21.430
Probably reserve any option,
right.

846
00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:25.330
For film or anything like that.
In the case that I'm paying them,
how would you,

847
00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:30.250
how might you determine how to pay them in a scenario like that?
Is there,

848
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:33.730
if you're prepared to lose them,
if you're prepared to lose money on it,
then

849
00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:39.160
prepared to lose money but not like hemorrhage out the face,
if that makes sense.

850
00:51:39.161 --> 00:51:41.170
Right.
Like I'm,
I want to pay a fair,

851
00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:45.460
<v 3>you won't hemorrhage pay people $2 a word you get like all the best writers in</v>

852
00:51:45.461 --> 00:51:48.140
America would be thrilled to right for you.
You pay them a buck 50 word,

853
00:51:48.141 --> 00:51:49.340
there'll be,
you know,

854
00:51:49.341 --> 00:51:51.800
you'll get a slightly smaller pool you pay and people will be like,

855
00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:59.300
yeah.
So your range will be somewhere between a dollar and $2 a word.
Cool.

856
00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:01.850
You know,
if you're Michael Lewis,
you'll ask for substantially more,

857
00:52:01.851 --> 00:52:04.700
but for like really terrific writers,

858
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:07.000
they will be happy with those rates.

859
00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:10.530
<v 2>Cool.
Amazing.
Well,
all right,</v>

860
00:52:10.531 --> 00:52:13.050
well I'm going to publicly say just for any writers who are listening,

861
00:52:13.051 --> 00:52:17.460
I will pay you $2 a word given the ideas that I have.
So,

862
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:20.820
uh,
yeah,
just,
I mean,
that may change,

863
00:52:20.821 --> 00:52:23.940
but for the first few pieces I want to do some,
some really,

864
00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:27.330
there's some things that I've been thinking about and they've been eating up

865
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:30.690
like the ram in my,
the back of my mind for probably a year or two.

866
00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:33.360
And I think there are people who are better qualified to tell some of these

867
00:52:33.361 --> 00:52:37.680
stories.
So.
Cool.
Cool.
Yeah.

868
00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:42.390
Productive podcast.
Cool.
So I'll make this,
well,

869
00:52:42.391 --> 00:52:43.650
I guess it is called the Tim Ferriss show,

870
00:52:43.651 --> 00:52:47.760
so I shouldn't feel badly about being so self indulgent.
But let me move on.
Uh,

871
00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:52.650
he,
uh,
also at the,
at the New Yorker,
uh,

872
00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:57.060
the,
and this was in politico,
this is an interview.

873
00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:57.811
So this is,

874
00:52:57.811 --> 00:53:01.080
I suppose when you were a senior editor and it said you'd been responsible for

875
00:53:01.081 --> 00:53:05.040
shaping the 10,000 word raw copy filed by writers.
Like,

876
00:53:05.041 --> 00:53:08.310
and it went on with this amazing list of writers.
How,

877
00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:12.570
how did you do what you did as an editor?

878
00:53:12.571 --> 00:53:17.571
How does one edit these incredible writers who have 10,000 word pieces?

879
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:19.860
Like when you read a,

880
00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:23.700
the first for I suppose first of all,

881
00:53:23.701 --> 00:53:26.730
do you get a effectively finished piece?

882
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:30.960
Do they send you a first draft that is rough?
How do these writers work with you?

883
00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:32.510
Or did they work with you that

884
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:40.510
<v 3>the great thing about the New York that you may be a unique publication in</v>

885
00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:46.910
America and that kind of 90% of the content is written by 50 people.

886
00:53:47.450 --> 00:53:51.710
And so you show up and they're whatever.
There are six senior editors.

887
00:53:51.711 --> 00:53:54.800
That means that eight people work with you and see your life is about those

888
00:53:54.801 --> 00:53:57.260
eight people.
So that making sure that they have the right ideas,

889
00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:01.670
they're all working on the time that you're helping them maximize their talents,

890
00:54:01.671 --> 00:54:04.010
their ambitions,
and helping them find stories.

891
00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:08.420
And so I worked with a group of writers,
um,
and with all of them,

892
00:54:08.421 --> 00:54:10.550
there were some things that I would do the same and some things that I would do

893
00:54:10.551 --> 00:54:13.010
differently.
So first,
whenever they filed the draft,

894
00:54:13.011 --> 00:54:14.540
I would immediately write back and say that I've got it.

895
00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:16.580
Because even if they're the most talented writer in the world,

896
00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:20.750
everybody is slightly insecure and wants to know that their story has been

897
00:54:20.751 --> 00:54:22.450
received by the editor.
So I've got it.

898
00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:27.470
Second thing is I wouldn't read it right then,
but I wouldn't,
um,

899
00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:32.120
delay,
right?
Cause you just,
procrastination is the enemy of good editing.

900
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:34.100
You should just start and do it right.

901
00:54:34.101 --> 00:54:36.860
And so if you get the draft while you're in the middle of something else

902
00:54:36.861 --> 00:54:38.990
important,
like edited another draft,
of course you wait for an hour.

903
00:54:38.991 --> 00:54:40.910
But really you should,
you know,

904
00:54:40.911 --> 00:54:44.060
within the first six hours of getting a draft from the writer,

905
00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:45.400
you should have read the draft.

906
00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:48.830
And so then you read the draft and then you start thinking through,

907
00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:54.130
and usually the first step would be going through and sending them back a memo

908
00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:57.830
saying,
hey,
this is good.
You know,
these are the things I like,

909
00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:00.440
but here are the big structural issues.

910
00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.360
And actually giving them specific guidance.

911
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:07.310
And my goal was always to make it a memo that I wouldn't have to kind of,

912
00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:10.460
uh,
men like you want to write and say,
I haven't really figured this out,

913
00:55:10.461 --> 00:55:12.770
but I kinda think he might want to do this.
I'll tell you more tomorrow.
No,

914
00:55:12.771 --> 00:55:14.720
you want to,
you want to give them,

915
00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:19.700
give them actual advice and things they can work with.
And if they disagree,

916
00:55:19.701 --> 00:55:22.640
they even have a conversation.
But I would write a memo saying,
hey,

917
00:55:22.641 --> 00:55:26.660
this piece is strong.
You know,
I really like this,

918
00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:29.870
but I,
you know,
I don't think you hit this core issue.

919
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:33.320
I think that the chronology is broken in these four ways.

920
00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:36.830
I think you overuse this.
And I really think you need more important on that.

921
00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:39.380
And so for every writer,
that's kind of the first step,

922
00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:43.040
which is here's what I think is wrong with a piece.
And you,
you know,

923
00:55:43.041 --> 00:55:45.220
you adjust that based on the amount of time you have allotted.

924
00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:49.010
If it's like a political piece and it has to run next week,
you,
you know,

925
00:55:49.011 --> 00:55:49.910
you try not to,

926
00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:52.670
if they're only going to be able to jump over somebody that's four feet high

927
00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:55.700
because the time available,
you try not to set up a barrier that's 65.
Right?

928
00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:58.430
So that's the first step.
Then after that,

929
00:55:58.431 --> 00:56:02.840
it starts to really vary depending on the writers.
So you know,
as you know,

930
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:07.310
each edit,
you know,
you go through a process from sort of wide aperture,

931
00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:11.640
big comments to very narrow focusing on specific sentences at the very end.
Um,

932
00:56:11.641 --> 00:56:14.450
and the process by which you go through that is different for different writers.

933
00:56:14.451 --> 00:56:17.000
So I worked with Telefonica,
right?

934
00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:19.430
One of the greatest pro status I've ever worked with,

935
00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:24.130
and I would never adjust a sentence of his with my own process.

936
00:56:24.131 --> 00:56:27.580
I would never say,
why didn't you write it this way?
How would you say,

937
00:56:27.581 --> 00:56:31.730
I don't think this works.
Please rewrite it.
Or um,
you know,

938
00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:35.830
please do this.
Not redoing it.
I would never,
I know never redo it myself,

939
00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:40.180
but it works with a lot of other writers who I would be much more likely to say,

940
00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.820
hey,
maybe you should write it this way or maybe you should do this.

941
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:46.690
Or even some writers where I would go in and rewrite sections with some writers.

942
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:51.550
Um,
I remember I worked with Ryan Lizza.
Um,
and you know,

943
00:56:51.551 --> 00:56:53.560
he would always been in this crazy deadline,
right?

944
00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:56.620
You'd have to write the leading from behind story and it has to run on Thursday.

945
00:56:56.980 --> 00:57:00.190
Uh,
and so we would literally be in Google docs where I would be rewriting the

946
00:57:00.191 --> 00:57:02.630
beginning of the piece while he would be writing the kind of things that we've

947
00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:05.450
spent a whole weekend with him,
sort of,
you know,

948
00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:09.460
filing down the story and me chasing him as an editor and then him sort of like

949
00:57:09.461 --> 00:57:11.150
cycling back up and going through my addicts.

950
00:57:11.170 --> 00:57:14.410
And that's just sort of looping through the piece with me trailing behind them.

951
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:19.060
So there were different,
different processes with different people.
But um,

952
00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:21.730
that's kind of a guideline to how it works.

953
00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:24.310
I know in a much more specifics on that because it's one of the things I

954
00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:25.240
absolutely loved.

955
00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:29.840
<v 2>Do you become a good writer first and then a good editor or,</v>

956
00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:35.360
or can you do it the other way around for people who want to develop an eye for

957
00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:42.210
editing,
uh,
suppose which is also very,
very closely related to rewriting.

958
00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:45.540
Uh,
do you have any recommendations?
Are there any,

959
00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:50.570
any books or classes or writers you would pay attention to perhaps to people who

960
00:57:51.541 --> 00:57:52.800
are listening to say,
you know what,

961
00:57:52.801 --> 00:57:57.801
I really want to develop a keener eye as a writer.

962
00:57:57.811 --> 00:57:58.650
Slash.
Editor.

963
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:03.050
<v 3>Yeah.
So a couple of things that I think are useful are,</v>

964
00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:08.370
well for first like get a better sense of style and structure.

965
00:58:08.371 --> 00:58:11.920
So what are the things that I think was really important to me is that I found

966
00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:15.410
the writers I really loved and I just read their stuff out loud for like,

967
00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:18.150
that's the sort of forces a level of concentration and attention are pros.

968
00:58:18.151 --> 00:58:21.450
I remember of go through the pieces of the freighter,
Katherine Boo Hoo.

969
00:58:21.610 --> 00:58:25.220
Mediocre I thought was maybe the best status around it.

970
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:29.610
I would just read her pieces out loud.
Katherine Boo.

971
00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:30.950
<v 2>How do you spell um,</v>

972
00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:33.380
<v 3>the Oh,
oh,
there we go.</v>

973
00:58:33.770 --> 00:58:38.540
And she wrote a lot of pieces about poverty.
Um,
her last book was about India.

974
00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:41.610
She doesn't write a ton,
but what she writes was extraordinary.

975
00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:43.790
You can also do it with,
you know,
Kalfas Center.

976
00:58:43.791 --> 00:58:44.910
You can go back and do it and you know,

977
00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:47.960
with John Mcphee or you could go and do it with rate from the whoever your

978
00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:52.780
favorite,
your favorite writer or,
or,
or,
or stylist is,

979
00:58:52.790 --> 00:58:56.870
or even just a piece that you loved.
Um,
you know,

980
00:58:56.871 --> 00:59:00.920
we've had all kinds of features and wire that are super interesting to read if

981
00:59:00.921 --> 00:59:01.910
you read them out loud.

982
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:06.830
So find a writer you love for whatever publication and steadied them.

983
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:10.970
Right.
And think about what exactly are they doing.
I also,
um,

984
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:15.140
you know,
most of my training didn't,
this was done as an editor,

985
00:59:15.141 --> 00:59:19.550
but you can also do it as a reader,
which is to map a story.
Um,

986
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.420
so I will often on a whiteboard when I'm working with a writer,

987
00:59:23.421 --> 00:59:26.180
but you could also just do it as an exercise for the finished piece.

988
00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:31.100
Like look at the structure at the piece,
right?
So how exactly does it work?

989
00:59:31.101 --> 00:59:33.650
Where is information presented,
where characters presented?

990
00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:36.740
So I'll use this example because it's sitting right here in my desk,

991
00:59:36.741 --> 00:59:40.010
my 11,000 word story about Mark Zuckerberg that you mentioned at the intro.

992
00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:45.610
It has a very specific structure that may not be the right structure or may not

993
00:59:45.891 --> 00:59:48.140
be the ideal structure,
but it is a very deliberate structure.

994
00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:52.850
So the way the story works is several characters are introduced.

995
00:59:52.851 --> 00:59:53.684
And the story,

996
00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:58.820
the First Section of the story is chronological from roughly February of 2016

997
00:59:58.840 --> 00:59:59.320
two,

998
00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:02.990
I think it's April of 2016 and tells the story of Facebook during that two month

999
01:00:02.991 --> 01:00:05.840
period.
And then the piece that has its one jump back,

1000
01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:08.210
it goes and it tells me very quickly,

1001
01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:13.330
sorry if Facebook from 2007 to 2016 and an introduces several specific themes at

1002
01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:17.030
a couple of characters will become important later.

1003
01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:18.260
And that was very deliberately done.

1004
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:21.950
Then the story drums backs into the chronology kicks up right where it was in

1005
01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:26.100
April of 2016 introduces a couple of facts that will be important later to the

1006
01:00:26.101 --> 01:00:28.670
story.
And then it mostly runs chronologically.

1007
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:33.830
So it's the structure is 80% chronological and 20% sematic.

1008
01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:34.911
Um,
you know,

1009
01:00:34.911 --> 01:00:38.410
at certain points you have to introduce story's slightly out of chronological

1010
01:00:38.411 --> 01:00:41.270
court order because of where you are thematically in the story of what you're

1011
01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:44.150
talking about.
Russia,
you have to introduce the fact about Russia,

1012
01:00:44.151 --> 01:00:46.040
even if it doesn't exactly fit the timeline.

1013
01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:49.850
But my coauthor Fred Vogelstein and I worked really hard because as much as

1014
01:00:49.851 --> 01:00:53.180
possible make it chronological is very deliberate structural choices.

1015
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:57.560
So you could map out that story and you know,
by mapping it out,

1016
01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:02.900
learn the things that I just said and also have a closer sense of the moments

1017
01:01:02.901 --> 01:01:05.260
where we chose to break away from the chronology.
Um,

1018
01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:09.200
and then be able to think through why we did that.
And so you can do that with,

1019
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:10.191
you know,

1020
01:01:10.191 --> 01:01:14.540
most stories and you'll see flaws and some of them you'll see brilliance and

1021
01:01:14.541 --> 01:01:17.000
some of them you'll see,
you know,

1022
01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:19.880
chronological structure is not a particularly interested in structure,

1023
01:01:19.881 --> 01:01:23.150
but it's a very good one.
Um,
you'll see interesting ways to do it.

1024
01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.750
You can do it watching movies too,

1025
01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:29.360
but I think it's a really useful exercise will make you a better writer and

1026
01:01:29.361 --> 01:01:30.890
observer to there.
Take these things apart.

1027
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:36.430
<v 2>When you map the story,
which is a Whiteboard,</v>

1028
01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:41.630
what does it look like?
Kind of bullet,
bullet,
bullet from top to bottom.

1029
01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:45.840
Is it set of circles going from left to right with things inside the circles,

1030
01:01:45.850 --> 01:01:46.631
outside the circles?

1031
01:01:46.631 --> 01:01:49.570
How do you map out a story if you're doing it on a whiteboard?

1032
01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:54.070
<v 3>It's probably,
um,
it probably has,</v>

1033
01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:57.190
I mean there are different ways to on the story,
but it probably has two things.

1034
01:01:57.191 --> 01:02:02.050
It probably has like
section,
right?

1035
01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:03.970
So section a,
you know,

1036
01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:07.900
the crime section be the chase,
right?

1037
01:02:07.901 --> 01:02:12.550
And then so sort of titles for all the sections and then sort of lines with the

1038
01:02:12.551 --> 01:02:15.250
different characters who are being introduced and where they're being introduced

1039
01:02:15.251 --> 01:02:17.530
and maybe even the different themes that are being introduced and where they're,

1040
01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:20.460
where they're being introduced.
So it's not really circles,

1041
01:02:20.461 --> 01:02:22.560
it's more like it's more,
it's close to the bullet points

1042
01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:28.800
<v 2>recommendation I'd love to make for people.
Also,
this is,</v>

1043
01:02:28.801 --> 01:02:31.410
this is something I really need to revisit my cell phone.

1044
01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:33.780
I'm not doing as much writing at the moment,

1045
01:02:33.781 --> 01:02:37.470
but for people who are really interested in structure and this mapping of

1046
01:02:37.471 --> 01:02:38.304
stories,

1047
01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:43.370
draft number four by John Mcphee is just a fantastic read and he really gets

1048
01:02:45.781 --> 01:02:46.411
into the weeds.

1049
01:02:46.411 --> 01:02:50.910
So you have to be exceptionally interested in writing to get into it.

1050
01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:56.300
But it shows some of the diagrams of his structure is for various feature pieces

1051
01:02:57.181 --> 01:03:00.240
that,
that,
that,
that he's written,
including for the New Yorker,
which is just,

1052
01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:06.210
I find it incredibly,
incredibly,
a fascinating,

1053
01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:10.890
uh,
given that if,
if anyone has not read levels of the game by John Mcphee,

1054
01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:15.450
I would,
I would,
cannot recommend it highly enough.
Um,

1055
01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:17.430
also from a structural standpoint,

1056
01:03:17.431 --> 01:03:21.930
that sort of chronology plus theme combination,
uh,
just,

1057
01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.700
just a Finn,
just a wonderful,
wonderful read.
Uh,

1058
01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:28.453
<v 3>I'm going to tell a story about,</v>

1059
01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:34.460
in some ways the reason why I ended up working at the New Yorker.
Um,
so I,

1060
01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:38.960
when I was at wired as a senior editor and the New Yorker reached out and said,

1061
01:03:38.961 --> 01:03:41.120
hey,
we've,
you know,
we've heard you're a good senior editor,

1062
01:03:41.121 --> 01:03:43.850
we have an opening in,
would you like to apply this?
And of course,
I mean,

1063
01:03:43.851 --> 01:03:47.390
I loved wire it in New York would be an amazing challenge.

1064
01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:51.770
And so I applied and I went through the process and the process was,

1065
01:03:51.771 --> 01:03:55.970
you edit to 10,000 word stories,
you rewrite things,
you,
it's exhausted process.

1066
01:03:55.971 --> 01:04:00.540
You've interviewed with the people.
Um,
and I went through it and I didn't get it.

1067
01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:05.810
And,
um,
but I could kind of sense in the note that they sent that I had been.

1068
01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:09.980
Um,
and then maybe,
so that was probably,

1069
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:14.390
I think this is 2009.
It's probably October of 2009.

1070
01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:17.430
And then there was a holiday party in,
um,

1071
01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.770
December of 2009 where I met somebody who had been an assistant at the New

1072
01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:24.560
Yorker and they were like,
Nick Thompson.
Oh my God.
I went back and forth,

1073
01:04:24.561 --> 01:04:27.710
back and forth.
They almost it,
but I didn't hire you.
Right.
I said,
well,

1074
01:04:27.711 --> 01:04:28.880
that's interesting information,

1075
01:04:29.830 --> 01:04:30.663
<v 2>painful.
But it's,</v>

1076
01:04:30.830 --> 01:04:35.300
<v 3>it's interesting.
I sit in two months later about February,
I had gotten,
um,</v>

1077
01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:39.440
I knew I was about to receive weirdly,

1078
01:04:39.441 --> 01:04:41.900
sort of two other offers wanting to go into television and went to work for

1079
01:04:41.901 --> 01:04:43.610
another magazine,
both of which were very tempting.

1080
01:04:43.611 --> 01:04:46.520
And so I knew that I'd be switching my career as soon.

1081
01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:49.430
And I remember staying up late one night.
I read the,
um,

1082
01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:51.440
the shape of the bark canoe.

1083
01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:54.370
<v 2>Bye.
Job Kind</v>

1084
01:04:54.370 --> 01:04:56.110
<v 3>of unknown book,
but just brilliant.</v>

1085
01:04:57.020 --> 01:04:57.430
<v 2>Yeah.
Beadwork</v>

1086
01:04:57.430 --> 01:05:02.030
<v 3>work is so good.
And so I read it and I finished it.
I remember lying on my couch,</v>

1087
01:05:02.031 --> 01:05:06.050
it's like two 30 in the morning and I finished that.
I was so emotional.

1088
01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:10.220
I really,
I want to give the New Yorker another shop before I,

1089
01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:12.920
before I totally stepped away.
And so that night at two 30,

1090
01:05:12.921 --> 01:05:16.640
I sent an email to the deputy editor,
Pat Mccarthy.
Uh,
it's like Pam,

1091
01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:21.280
Dear Ms. McCarthy.
Um,
I know you almost hired me,
you know,

1092
01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:24.280
four months ago and I'm about to leave the company.

1093
01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:27.140
Wired is part of wired where I worked on where I work now as part of Conde Nast.

1094
01:05:27.141 --> 01:05:29.590
It to the yolk is also part of the second I'm about to leave the company to go

1095
01:05:29.591 --> 01:05:32.080
somewhere else,
but I really want to work for you.

1096
01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:36.220
So this would be the moment and I'd love to have another shot at it.

1097
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.980
And it was kind of a strange email to send.

1098
01:05:39.050 --> 01:05:40.960
I was just sorta so emotional after reading the feet.

1099
01:05:41.530 --> 01:05:43.900
And Tim wrote back and was like,
okay,

1100
01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:48.610
let's come meet with me again and meet with rhythmic again.
And so,
uh,

1101
01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:51.400
I went upstairs to their office,
met with them again.

1102
01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:56.710
I'm Remnick was very blunt about why he hadn't hired me the first time.

1103
01:05:57.220 --> 01:06:00.090
Um,
asked me whether I could address the concern he had.

1104
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:04.960
The concern he had was basically that you would come in on and um,

1105
01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:09.190
you want to write and do television and do all these other stuff instead of like

1106
01:06:09.191 --> 01:06:12.190
just putting your head down and beat an editor.
Um,
I said,
no,

1107
01:06:12.191 --> 01:06:13.630
I'll put my head down and be an editor.

1108
01:06:13.631 --> 01:06:17.110
I can prove it to you if you'll give me another edit test are they gave me

1109
01:06:17.111 --> 01:06:20.320
another at cast.
And then,
you know,
probably a week or two later they hired me.

1110
01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:24.520
So it was entirely a mic feet that,
um,

1111
01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:27.280
that spurred me to write that email to Pam and then got me hired.

1112
01:06:28.270 --> 01:06:29.910
<v 2>Amazing.
What a great story</v>

1113
01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:38.000
for people who really want to go down that rabbit hole brigade to cuisine.

1114
01:06:39.090 --> 01:06:41.620
There's so many,
oh my God,
it's,

1115
01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:47.380
you really can't go wrong with,
with big fee.
Yeah,

1116
01:06:47.590 --> 01:06:49.800
no,
that's a wonderful story.

1117
01:06:50.490 --> 01:06:54.630
How did you decide to get into the startup game startup game as a full contact

1118
01:06:54.631 --> 01:06:59.490
sport?
Generally?
Very,
very difficult.
How did that come into the fold?

1119
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:01.910
<v 3>So that happened.
Um,</v>

1120
01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:06.510
so I was an editor at wired and at wire you pick ended that time under Chris

1121
01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:10.210
Anderson.
He really encouraged people to do different things.

1122
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:15.070
I had done this crazy wonderful story where there's a writer,
editor atlas,

1123
01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:18.080
so I edited at wired,
awesome guy.
Um,

1124
01:07:18.130 --> 01:07:23.130
we had gotten very drunk one night and we were talking about for some reason

1125
01:07:24.941 --> 01:07:27.520
there were like a lot of people who were kind of faking your death and starting

1126
01:07:27.521 --> 01:07:28.550
life over.
Right?

1127
01:07:28.551 --> 01:07:32.320
Which is the interesting thing to do in the digital age because it's kind of

1128
01:07:32.350 --> 01:07:36.660
easier to start a new life and create a new identity,
right?

1129
01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.190
Just create a new email address and you tutor competence also easier to track

1130
01:07:39.191 --> 01:07:39.940
people.

1131
01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:42.670
So it was kind of an interesting wire dilemma and we were talking about how to

1132
01:07:42.671 --> 01:07:45.850
tell that story or two of her friends kind of segment gray and this woman,

1133
01:07:45.851 --> 01:07:49.150
Gen con four of us were having if e k and alcohol.

1134
01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:53.980
And somehow through this like long conversation,
Evan came up with this idea,

1135
01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:57.850
which is that he would write a story about how to fake your death and start life

1136
01:07:57.851 --> 01:07:58.630
over.

1137
01:07:58.630 --> 01:08:03.010
And then we would run it and then he would fake his death and we would run like

1138
01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:04.960
a man hunt the flag and we're not taking stuff.

1139
01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:07.720
But basically we go off the grid and wired would run them then how to find them.

1140
01:08:07.721 --> 01:08:11.310
This was early Twitter.
And so we took that idea to the wired kitchen meeting.

1141
01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:14.920
It kind of very high score got approved.
He wrote part one,
which is,
you know,

1142
01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:17.630
hear some stories about people who've tried to start over in the digital age.

1143
01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:22.070
And then he went on the run.
And so we ran this experiment for a month.

1144
01:08:22.071 --> 01:08:26.090
It was August of um,
I guess August,
2009.

1145
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:31.280
And the experiment was Evan Ratliff has disappeared.
If you find him,

1146
01:08:31.281 --> 01:08:32.570
you get $5,000,

1147
01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:35.480
and then the rules were that I would have all the information or private

1148
01:08:35.481 --> 01:08:38.510
investigator would have.
So I would be able to interview with family members,

1149
01:08:38.511 --> 01:08:41.840
I would have access to his old photos,
like a social security number,

1150
01:08:41.841 --> 01:08:42.351
all those things.

1151
01:08:42.351 --> 01:08:45.140
And I would leak than out through Twitter over the course of the month.

1152
01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:48.500
And we had no idea it was going to work.
Um,
you know,

1153
01:08:48.501 --> 01:08:50.930
it's one of those things that like I've maybe he'll get found on the first day,

1154
01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.900
right.
Or maybe no one will care.
Um,
but

1155
01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:58.250
<v 4>through,
uh,</v>

1156
01:08:58.290 --> 01:09:03.080
I don't think I sleep,
I might've,
I at least
I certainly

1157
01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:09.300
friend's name his acts,
his
mother's name,

1158
01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:14.660
<v 3>stuff you would have.
Um,
you know,
his credit card bills,</v>

1159
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:20.610
crazy people got so excited and it all happened on Twitter.

1160
01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:23.460
It's like the first time I was really into Twitter.
Um,

1161
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:28.650
and so the deal is if the guy,
if he made it a month,
he got $5,000.

1162
01:09:28.651 --> 01:09:30.660
If you got caught,
the person got $5,000.

1163
01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:36.140
And so he got caught because he was using poor can skies is IP addresses masking

1164
01:09:37.591 --> 01:09:40.050
thing that nick is possible for people to see what Ip address he use.

1165
01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:45.380
But he's screwed up once and by screwing up once some smart code or figured out

1166
01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.520
a little bit about where he was,

1167
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:52.350
then that guy figured out the fake Twitter account that haven't they created and

1168
01:09:52.351 --> 01:09:54.530
followed it by creating a fake

1169
01:09:54.610 --> 01:09:58.630
<v 4>Fem Bot
following editor Evan.</v>

1170
01:09:59.430 --> 01:10:01.830
<v 3>They somehow then figured out that edit was in New Orleans.</v>

1171
01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:06.240
We made a deal with will Shortz that if you solve the New York Times crossword

1172
01:10:06.241 --> 01:10:10.050
puzzle in bedded and it would be a clue about where Evan was.
That's,

1173
01:10:10.051 --> 01:10:13.230
I think the clue was something like,
um,

1174
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:17.250
it'll be at a pizza restaurant and I had leaked online and he was gluten free.

1175
01:10:17.251 --> 01:10:18.900
So these geniuses online,

1176
01:10:18.901 --> 01:10:21.840
they're like solve the crossword puzzle and basically put together that there's

1177
01:10:21.841 --> 01:10:25.860
only one pizza place he can go to a New Orleans were search gluten free pizza

1178
01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:28.890
and they caught him on the last day.

1179
01:10:29.210 --> 01:10:30.400
<v 4>Wow.
That's amazing.
Amazing Hunt.</v>

1180
01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:34.060
<v 3>Yeah.
So that was really exciting.
And so that happens.</v>

1181
01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:37.510
And Evan and I of course bond despite the fact that I've almost heard his life

1182
01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:39.910
as the private investigator.
Um,

1183
01:10:40.450 --> 01:10:44.890
and so maybe a month after that,
Evan and I were,
the two months after that,

1184
01:10:44.891 --> 01:10:48.490
we were watching at his apartment watching a football game,

1185
01:10:48.491 --> 01:10:50.640
like an Alabama College football game.
Um,

1186
01:10:50.770 --> 01:10:53.080
he's from the south and it's written for them.
And he's like,
you know,

1187
01:10:53.081 --> 01:10:56.380
we should start a magazine that does that kind of thing.
And I was like,
sure,

1188
01:10:56.381 --> 01:10:58.060
that sounds like fun.
And I had a,

1189
01:10:58.270 --> 01:11:01.870
I just published my book and I had a really good web designer,

1190
01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:03.610
this guy named Jeff.
And I was like,
well,

1191
01:11:03.611 --> 01:11:06.460
let's meet Jeff and see whether he wants to do it with us.

1192
01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.200
And so the three of us got together and we said,
okay,

1193
01:11:08.201 --> 01:11:09.670
let's start a digital only magazine.

1194
01:11:09.670 --> 01:11:11.320
And so the idea was that I would keep my job,

1195
01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:16.560
the two of them would go full time to the outcomist.
Um,
we would,
you know,

1196
01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:20.460
run experimental story's crazy,
long form stories and see what we could do.

1197
01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:22.890
And then right about that time apple introduced the IPAD.

1198
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.310
So then the idea became they'll,

1199
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:28.560
you'll kind of be iPad focused and we'll do multimedia.

1200
01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:33.150
And so we started this company at ad super propitious moment.
Um,

1201
01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:36.300
in order to create the stories,

1202
01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:41.280
Jeff had to write a content management system that would make it easiest for us

1203
01:11:41.281 --> 01:11:42.600
to do multimedia storytelling.

1204
01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:46.710
And so accidentally we suddenly had a business too because then we were able to

1205
01:11:46.711 --> 01:11:48.660
license the content management system,
the people.

1206
01:11:49.050 --> 01:11:51.380
So we built a really cool business.
Um,

1207
01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:54.290
so the goal hadn't been to start like a software company and fulfilled another

1208
01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:55.950
software company.
The goal had been just like,

1209
01:11:55.951 --> 01:11:58.180
let's make a cool magazine that does longform.
Um,

1210
01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:01.950
and we inadvertently built a good business.
Um,
and so,
you know,

1211
01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:03.750
nine years later we still got it.

1212
01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:06.390
It's still publishing every month and there's still will CMS that we're still

1213
01:12:06.391 --> 01:12:07.224
selling.

1214
01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:18.830
<v 2>What was the name?
Did you recall the headline?</v>

1215
01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:22.410
The title of the piece about,
uh,

1216
01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:24.170
well I suppose it wasn't about Evan at this point,

1217
01:12:24.171 --> 01:12:27.230
but about people starting over in a digital world.

1218
01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:32.180
Do you recall or how or
how might people find

1219
01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.860
<v 3>if they type in wired fanish</v>

1220
01:12:37.090 --> 01:12:41.920
you'll find it or if you had an on that list rhe l I S S I think that headline,

1221
01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:45.190
it's like in Spanish.
And then Ratliff tried to disappear.
Here's what happened.

1222
01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:48.670
And it will tell because after he was,
after he got caught,

1223
01:12:48.671 --> 01:12:53.290
he wrote this great 8,000 word story about his life on the run.
So good.
Um,

1224
01:12:53.291 --> 01:12:55.810
it was the first door from what I'd ever nominated for National Magazine Award

1225
01:12:55.811 --> 01:12:59.050
and feature writing.
Um,
it's such a good story.
So yeah,

1226
01:12:59.051 --> 01:13:00.700
Evan Ratliff tried to vanish.
Here's what happened.

1227
01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:08.880
<v 2>Looking for his name and vanish also lead to the proceeding piece that he had</v>

1228
01:13:08.881 --> 01:13:13.500
written about.
Yes,
definitely.
Okay,
very cool.
Yeah,
that's an ongoing fantasy,

1229
01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.290
although increasingly difficult to get some good advice,

1230
01:13:19.291 --> 01:13:22.650
but maybe a little bit out of date,
additional tracking.

1231
01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:27.900
So you be my by any objective measure,

1232
01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:31.310
have gotten a lot done and get a lot done.
Uh,

1233
01:13:31.410 --> 01:13:34.320
love to talk about structure and routine,

1234
01:13:34.321 --> 01:13:39.270
not in writing but in your life.
And uh,
this,

1235
01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:44.060
this was as good a place as any to ask.
Do you still run to and from work or how,

1236
01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:48.720
how long you do?
So,
all right.

1237
01:13:48.730 --> 01:13:53.100
So what I have here is you run to work,
shower at the gym next door,

1238
01:13:53.101 --> 01:13:55.440
and then you have suits in the office to change into.

1239
01:13:55.530 --> 01:13:58.170
And then at the end of the day you change back into running clothes and run back

1240
01:13:58.410 --> 01:14:03.060
home.
Uh,
why is that important to you?

1241
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:04.590
Have you always been running?
Yup.

1242
01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:08.150
<v 3>Yeah,
so I was a runner in high school and college.</v>

1243
01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:16.120
I took some time off,
but I started sort of marathon and recently,
seriously,

1244
01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:17.043
mentally twenties.

1245
01:14:17.650 --> 01:14:22.180
And it's important for all types of reasons.
It's important.

1246
01:14:22.181 --> 01:14:25.510
It has a sense of self,
it's important.
Um,

1247
01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:30.220
physically it's important to have physical things.
When does this one gets older?

1248
01:14:30.221 --> 01:14:33.630
And the my early forties.
Now it's important,
you know,

1249
01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:36.940
mostly because at one point in my life I got very sick and so it's a reminder

1250
01:14:36.941 --> 01:14:39.160
when I can still do it that I'm no longer that.

1251
01:14:39.161 --> 01:14:43.180
So there are a lot of like intense reasons why,
why I run into,
I like to run.

1252
01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:47.290
But it's really hard to find time to run.
I cause I have this ambitious job.

1253
01:14:47.291 --> 01:14:50.680
I work super late every night and I've got three kids and I'm a very devoted

1254
01:14:50.681 --> 01:14:53.290
father,
so I need to do with that in the morning.
I need to be a felony evenings.

1255
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:56.760
Um,
so I can't kind of take off and run.
Um,

1256
01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.810
and in fact it's often harder to find time to run on weekends and doesn't the

1257
01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:04.000
weekdays.
So having it structured into my life where,
you know,

1258
01:15:04.210 --> 01:15:08.360
I put myself a wallet and keys and a little like a little pack strapping on,

1259
01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:12.340
on your own home.
It a,
it works really nicely and it keeps me,

1260
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:14.570
I think it's also a good mental break.
You know,

1261
01:15:14.571 --> 01:15:17.700
you spend the morning with the kids,
getting them ready.
You know,

1262
01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:22.660
there's a lot of energy and excitement.
Um,
and then,
um,
when I go back home,

1263
01:15:22.661 --> 01:15:23.351
you know,
there's a lot of energy,

1264
01:15:23.351 --> 01:15:26.860
excitement and putting them to sleep and then kind of going back to work.
Um,

1265
01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:30.730
so it's nice to have like the little breaks in the day where I'm wearing
running.

1266
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:33.670
<v 2>If you're open to talking about it.</v>

1267
01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:35.750
You mentioned you had a period where you've got very sick,

1268
01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:39.430
which I don't know anything about.
Could you tell us a bit more?
There's nothing

1269
01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:44.450
<v 3>about on the Internet.
I got thyroid cancer,
which is,
it's cancer,</v>

1270
01:15:44.451 --> 01:15:46.600
which is a horrible,
terrible thing,
but it's the,

1271
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:51.240
it's kind of the least dangerous kind.
Um,

1272
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:55.610
but what had happened with running is,
um,

1273
01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:58.640
I'll,
I'll sort of tell that whole story.
Um,

1274
01:15:59.330 --> 01:16:03.320
when I started running and started running marathons and like I remember really

1275
01:16:03.321 --> 01:16:05.900
wanting to break three hours.
I went as a child,
I'd watched my father,

1276
01:16:05.901 --> 01:16:08.030
he'd run a marathon,
was like three hours and 10 seconds.

1277
01:16:08.031 --> 01:16:11.660
And he had been frustrated that he couldn't run a three hour marathon.

1278
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:15.110
And so I started running marathons and I like couldn't crack it.

1279
01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:19.290
And then one year and like totally cracked it and ran a two 43 right.

1280
01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:21.560
And it was like way underneath it.
And my dad was super proud.

1281
01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:23.810
And then right after that,
um,

1282
01:16:24.170 --> 01:16:28.040
I got diagnosed with thyroid cancer and I ended up having a couple of surgeries

1283
01:16:28.041 --> 01:16:29.150
going through radiation treatment.

1284
01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:32.700
<v 2>How did you diagnose?
It was during a routine</v>

1285
01:16:33.650 --> 01:16:36.410
<v 3>checkup.
Yeah.
I was like,
it was like a couple of weeks after the marathon.</v>

1286
01:16:36.411 --> 01:16:37.730
It was marathons in November.

1287
01:16:37.731 --> 01:16:40.640
And so it was early December and doctors like there's a lump,

1288
01:16:40.641 --> 01:16:44.870
it's probably nothing,
but let's check it.
And so he checked it and it was like,

1289
01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:46.680
oh,
we might be bad,
you know?

1290
01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:49.730
And then you go through that whole process that people who have been sick go

1291
01:16:49.731 --> 01:16:54.260
through where you know,
oh no,
this could be bad,

1292
01:16:54.261 --> 01:16:57.290
but it'll probably be okay.
Brian,
I'm in my twenties I've always been healthy.

1293
01:16:58.070 --> 01:17:02.180
Oh No.
It looks like it might be bad.
Oh No,
it is bad,
but it won't be that bad.

1294
01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:04.160
Oh No,
it is that bad.
Right.

1295
01:17:04.161 --> 01:17:07.310
And you'd sort of go through three months of these tests and experiments and

1296
01:17:07.311 --> 01:17:11.950
biopsies as you either like you either exit or you like it,

1297
01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:15.050
just get ever deeper into it.
Um,
you know,

1298
01:17:15.051 --> 01:17:18.640
at one point I remember if they start actually,
oh no,
you're okay.
Um,

1299
01:17:18.650 --> 01:17:19.670
but any case,
so I went,

1300
01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:23.570
then I went through the surgery to have it all removed and then the radiation

1301
01:17:23.571 --> 01:17:27.770
treatment and then a sort of titration of the medicine to try and get you back

1302
01:17:27.771 --> 01:17:30.850
to normal.
And it just completely obliterated me.
Uh,

1303
01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:33.340
it was the first time in my life that I'd been just,

1304
01:17:33.710 --> 01:17:37.070
just knocked off my feet and I couldn't,
like,
I couldn't run,
you know,

1305
01:17:37.071 --> 01:17:39.710
like 15 feet.
Right.
Um,

1306
01:17:40.670 --> 01:17:44.090
so that was a really tough emotional period for all kinds of reasons.
You know,

1307
01:17:44.091 --> 01:17:45.980
you're thinking about mortality in a real way.

1308
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:50.270
For the first time it was my early twenties,
um,
I had just been married,
you know,

1309
01:17:50.271 --> 01:17:53.180
thinking about what,
what now would I ever be able to have children?
Like what,

1310
01:17:53.181 --> 01:17:57.770
what your,
your expectations on what life becomes totally different.

1311
01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:02.810
Um,
and so I went through that period and fortunately came out the other side and

1312
01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:07.811
then it was really emotionally uplifting and psychologically powerful when,

1313
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:11.840
I guess it was two years after that first marathon,

1314
01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:14.570
I think in that first marathon,
I finished it in like two hours,

1315
01:18:14.571 --> 01:18:16.970
43 minutes and 52 seconds.

1316
01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:20.330
And then like two years later I ran the same marathon and finished it in like

1317
01:18:20.331 --> 01:18:23.460
two hours,
42 minutes and 50 seconds or something like that.
Um,

1318
01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:28.470
and it was incredibly powerful to suddenly feel like in a way that signal that I

1319
01:18:29.211 --> 01:18:30.740
was through it.
And so every year since then,

1320
01:18:30.741 --> 01:18:33.050
I've more or less every year since then,
except the years I've had kids,

1321
01:18:33.051 --> 01:18:37.430
I tried to run the same marathon.
That's ties you back to the original story.

1322
01:18:37.431 --> 01:18:38.264
I don't run it.

1323
01:18:39.730 --> 01:18:40.960
<v 2>Thank you for sharing that.</v>

1324
01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:53.820
Your bio or read about all the things you've accomplished and assume that it's

1325
01:18:55.271 --> 01:18:58.480
just been the one kind of home run after another after another,

1326
01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:01.660
aside from that kidnapping in northern Africa,

1327
01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:06.350
which turned out to be a blessing in disguise of sorts.
But,
uh,

1328
01:19:06.490 --> 01:19:07.630
I appreciate you sharing that.

1329
01:19:07.690 --> 01:19:12.690
And to further sort of flesh out the picture just a little bit,

1330
01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:17.050
could you tell us about a time when you felt,

1331
01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:22.140
aside from that particular period when you felt overwhelmed or,

1332
01:19:23.790 --> 01:19:25.650
or our director prepared any,

1333
01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:29.650
any of that and how you found your way out or what you do in those
circumstances?

1334
01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:34.070
<v 3>Well,
there been,
um,
you know,
my,</v>

1335
01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:39.040
my professional career in my,
you know,

1336
01:19:39.041 --> 01:19:42.980
the first six or seven years was who's not great.

1337
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:46.850
Um,
I,
you know,
so I,

1338
01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:52.130
I finished school,
I have that kind of messed up period where I,

1339
01:19:52.131 --> 01:19:54.100
you know,
go to Africa.
I read through the post,
but it's,
you know,

1340
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:57.790
it's a period of getting rejected by 20 jobs before I get hired the last
monthly.

1341
01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:01.940
So then there's like a moment of often this where for two years I'm editor to

1342
01:20:01.950 --> 01:20:04.490
watch a Monday going back to New York plenty of time the weekends,

1343
01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.040
but to wash them off the job is very much a two year job.

1344
01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:11.620
And the expectation when I finished was like all previous editors and watched a

1345
01:20:11.621 --> 01:20:15.070
month thing.
I would go on and have an awesome career in journalism.
I finished,

1346
01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:19.530
you know,
I think I finished like September 9th,
2011.
Um,

1347
01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:24.380
and after I finished,
I had a really rough time.
Um,

1348
01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:26.370
I couldn't get hired.
I,
you know,

1349
01:20:26.371 --> 01:20:30.030
I got rejected by 20 journalistic institutions.

1350
01:20:30.031 --> 01:20:31.560
I was sure I was going to hire the New York Times.

1351
01:20:31.561 --> 01:20:33.780
I didn't get hired to their time to first contact the Washington Post.

1352
01:20:33.781 --> 01:20:37.980
And you know,
I thought I had,
um,
it just,
it didn't work.
I ended up,

1353
01:20:37.981 --> 01:20:41.460
I ended up installing the new America Foundation,
which was fine.
Um,

1354
01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:47.100
but from roughly 2001 the 2005,

1355
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:50.970
I couldn't,
I couldn't get journalism going again.
Um,

1356
01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:54.450
and so in the summer of 2005,

1357
01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:56.790
I guess in 2005 I was working at a magazine called legal affairs,

1358
01:20:56.791 --> 01:21:00.380
which I will like.
It was really grateful to,
but it wasn't,
he was in new haven.

1359
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:05.150
My girlfriend,
who's now my wife was in New York.
Um,
I,
you know,

1360
01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.650
I applied to law school,
which is the way you get out of journalism,
right?

1361
01:21:07.650 --> 01:21:09.330
In the way you retract your life,
right?

1362
01:21:09.331 --> 01:21:11.900
If you're in your 20s and the career you're doing is not working,

1363
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:15.580
one great way to be track your life is through law school.
Uh,

1364
01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:20.820
so I applied to law school and I got into Nyu and I was literally set to go,

1365
01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:26.640
um,
I guess it would have matriculated in August of 2005.
Um,

1366
01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:29.360
I think wired rope to me in July of 2005 cent here.

1367
01:21:29.361 --> 01:21:34.020
Were you interested in being a senior editor?
And so that summer,
um,

1368
01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.660
it was crazy,
right?
Cause my whole life is going to,

1369
01:21:36.661 --> 01:21:38.070
I know it's going to hinge on this decision,
right?

1370
01:21:38.071 --> 01:21:41.580
Am I going to stay in journalism and or am I going to go to law school and then

1371
01:21:41.581 --> 01:21:45.720
like do something completely different.
And the way it all shook out,

1372
01:21:45.721 --> 01:21:50.310
I remember the,
the,
I hadn't,
I don't think I had been offered the wire job,

1373
01:21:50.311 --> 01:21:51.960
but I was pretty sure I was going to get it.

1374
01:21:52.410 --> 01:21:55.740
And so the day before I was due at Nyu,
I wrote to them and said,
no,

1375
01:21:55.741 --> 01:21:58.590
I'm not going.
And then I just prayed a lot.

1376
01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:01.210
<v 5>They</v>

1377
01:22:01.210 --> 01:22:04.770
<v 3>get it and I started at next month.
Um,
but it was,
that was like,</v>

1378
01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:07.170
those were a couple of years where I was like enough time to make the right

1379
01:22:07.171 --> 01:22:10.560
decision.
Like,
cause I remember when I had been like a teenager,

1380
01:22:10.561 --> 01:22:13.830
I hadn't expected to be a journalist so I had all this self doubt about whether

1381
01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:19.260
I had ended up in the wrong profession accidentally.
Where could,

1382
01:22:19.261 --> 01:22:24.261
if you look at your life as you know their purse when you're 25 and you think

1383
01:22:24.961 --> 01:22:29.790
back to what would nick had thought at 19 the the funny turn into journalism,

1384
01:22:29.791 --> 01:22:33.030
which now seems so propitious and so good at the sort of the weird story where

1385
01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:34.500
I'm kidnapped and I write the story and a good hire at the,

1386
01:22:34.501 --> 01:22:37.440
washed him up in and attracts me.
Like if you look at it from now,

1387
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:40.020
it looks like a really fortunate thing that those things happened.

1388
01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:43.140
But if you're in your mid twenties in journalism,
is it working?

1389
01:22:43.710 --> 01:22:46.230
And you look at it and think,
wait,
I wasn't supposed to be a journalist.

1390
01:22:46.231 --> 01:22:47.280
I didn't want to be a journalist.

1391
01:22:47.281 --> 01:22:50.340
So maybe that just all got me going on the wrong foot and I should have,

1392
01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:54.600
like if I hadn't gone to Africa,
like we'd be in a much better place.
Um,

1393
01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:58.680
so that was really complicated to think through and work through it and ended up

1394
01:22:58.681 --> 01:23:01.650
all working out really well and I'm extremely happy where I am now.
But that was,

1395
01:23:02.130 --> 01:23:06.640
there was definitely a couple of years where I was totally adrift where my Peer

1396
01:23:06.641 --> 01:23:08.980
Group is doing much better than I was doing and um,

1397
01:23:09.310 --> 01:23:10.990
where I felt like I was in the wrong field.

1398
01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:14.240
<v 2>How did wired find you or how did,</v>

1399
01:23:14.330 --> 01:23:18.920
how did it come to pass that they reached out to you with that potential offer?

1400
01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:21.113
<v 3>Uh,</v>

1401
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:26.830
because I have a friend for whom I've had like a amazing clear overlap.

1402
01:23:28.050 --> 01:23:32.940
There's getting Brandon Carter and I are exactly the same age and um,

1403
01:23:33.650 --> 01:23:37.670
I edited something he wrote at when I was at the washed a month and he was at us

1404
01:23:37.671 --> 01:23:39.070
news and world report,
but that's it for last month.

1405
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:42.620
And I edited and he liked the way I edited it.
And so we became friends.

1406
01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:47.000
And so then he left us news and got hired at New America Foundation.

1407
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:50.180
And then I got hired at New America Foundation after him.

1408
01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:55.720
And he had recommended me and then he went to wired and he recommended me there.

1409
01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:00.740
And so I got hired at wired and I recommended him to my book agent.

1410
01:24:00.770 --> 01:24:02.810
And he ended up selling a book through that.

1411
01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:06.390
And then he wrote from it to New Yorker from it,
the outcomist.

1412
01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:08.180
And he's got the current cover story in wired.

1413
01:24:08.450 --> 01:24:09.283
<v 2>We've had these words,</v>

1414
01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:14.080
<v 3>amazing,
intertwined careers and friendship that's been really terrific.
And,
uh,</v>

1415
01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:19.240
he's one of those people who eat it with some people who are like the same age

1416
01:24:19.241 --> 01:24:23.290
and in the same field or like competitive and maybe don't always want you to

1417
01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:25.240
succeed.
And for whatever reason,

1418
01:24:25.241 --> 01:24:29.110
he and I had had a relationship where I've always only wanted him to succeed and

1419
01:24:29.111 --> 01:24:30.580
he's only always wanted me to succeed in.

1420
01:24:30.581 --> 01:24:33.550
So we'd been extremely helpful to each other.
Um,
and that's been,

1421
01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:36.880
that's been great.
And so look at the cover story of the next issue.

1422
01:24:36.881 --> 01:24:38.950
And Brendan's name is Dan.
I'm super proud of it.

1423
01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:49.470
<v 2>I want to go back to
whatever it was,</v>

1424
01:24:49.471 --> 01:24:54.471
24 hour period where you've turned down this exploding offers expiring offer for

1425
01:24:56.821 --> 01:24:58.680
law school yet you haven't yet.

1426
01:24:58.681 --> 01:25:02.580
You haven't yet been offered the job at wired.

1427
01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:08.490
Can you walk us through the,
the dinner,
the conversation in your head,

1428
01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:11.010
the sort of hours proceeding,

1429
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.000
notifying law school that you are not going to be a curriculum because that is,

1430
01:25:18.630 --> 01:25:21.630
that strikes me as terrifying.
That seems completely terrifying.

1431
01:25:22.830 --> 01:25:23.071
<v 3>I mean,</v>

1432
01:25:23.071 --> 01:25:26.110
the game theory was both a little trickier and in some ways easier because there

1433
01:25:26.111 --> 01:25:29.760
was this third option.
Um,
I had written,

1434
01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:35.600
my grandfather had died and George Kennan had both died in early 2004 and I had

1435
01:25:39.061 --> 01:25:41.460
written an essay about their parallel lives.

1436
01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:45.270
And so I had also decided that maybe I would write a book about the two of them.

1437
01:25:45.271 --> 01:25:47.370
And so I had a proposal for a book.

1438
01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:50.160
So I had three things that I could do with my life and I was getting to do some

1439
01:25:50.161 --> 01:25:53.340
combination of one of those three things or two of those three things.

1440
01:25:53.341 --> 01:25:56.190
I knew that it wouldn't be time to do all three.
You can't go to law school,

1441
01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:57.300
worked for wired and write a book.

1442
01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:02.190
And so the law school offer was gonna explode mid August.

1443
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:06.950
The wired option I was going to hear about relatively soon.

1444
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:08.263
And the book,

1445
01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:13.900
I think I had sent a draft of a proposal to my agent and so I did that with him

1446
01:26:14.891 --> 01:26:16.400
become a reality or not a reality.

1447
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:19.640
And so in some ways the decision was if I go to law school,

1448
01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:22.100
even if I don't get the wire job,

1449
01:26:22.130 --> 01:26:25.670
I still maybe have a shot at the books and the odds were like,
the odds are okay.

1450
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:30.320
Um,
but I,
you know,
what do I remember about that day?

1451
01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:33.640
I was in Maine up at the place.

1452
01:26:33.641 --> 01:26:36.800
My family has up near Katie National Park where I'd spent summers from my

1453
01:26:36.801 --> 01:26:38.630
childhood,
which is like a very reflective,

1454
01:26:38.631 --> 01:26:41.090
wonderful place for the place where I always feel good and confident.

1455
01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:46.300
And maybe it was being there.
Maybe it was,
you know,
I,

1456
01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:51.140
there was some unease,
some deep unease about going to law school.

1457
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:56.330
Some sense that I was giving up some sense of like,
you know,

1458
01:26:56.331 --> 01:27:00.890
it was the,
the week choice to make.
Um,
I don't exactly remember,

1459
01:27:00.891 --> 01:27:04.820
but I do remember being terrified when I wrote them and said no,
and thinking,

1460
01:27:04.821 --> 01:27:08.550
well this is,
you know,
you came up with a pretty good backup here,
neck.

1461
01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:11.300
You gave him a pretty good plan and we use a pretty awesome law school to go

1462
01:27:11.301 --> 01:27:14.210
through.
It's three years and you're,
you know,
you graduate,

1463
01:27:14.211 --> 01:27:18.440
you're guarantee or really well paying successful career license in New York,

1464
01:27:18.910 --> 01:27:22.100
um,
and you're throwing that away.
Um,
but I went for it.

1465
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:27.760
<v 2>Who knows,
who
knows,</v>

1466
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:31.143
who knows

1467
01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:35.240
<v 3>about that a lot,
right?
Like that's active,</v>

1468
01:27:35.241 --> 01:27:40.241
very few moments where your life entirely hinges upon a specific decision.

1469
01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:45.330
Right?
Like the choice of who you married.
But that's not really a choice.

1470
01:27:45.331 --> 01:27:47.380
You don't,
it's not so much like that.
Like,

1471
01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:51.190
I can't think of any other day that's close to it.
Um,
I mean,

1472
01:27:51.191 --> 01:27:55.400
I guess the choice to Wright Pam Mccarthy at the New Yorker had a,

1473
01:27:55.450 --> 01:27:58.260
had a big influence.
Um,
you know,

1474
01:27:58.261 --> 01:28:01.320
there was the choice to lead to the New Yorker to accept this wire job and that

1475
01:28:01.321 --> 01:28:03.450
was a pretty easy choice towards the New Yorker.

1476
01:28:03.451 --> 01:28:08.430
But you gotta be editor in Chief of wired,
you definitely take it.
Um,
so there,

1477
01:28:08.431 --> 01:28:12.360
there are a few moments but that was definitely the day where I made the choice

1478
01:28:12.361 --> 01:28:14.140
that had the biggest effect.
But you don't get to,
you know,

1479
01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:16.920
live life multiple ways.
So it seems like the right choice,

1480
01:28:16.921 --> 01:28:18.800
everything worked out as well as it possibly could have.
But

1481
01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:23.460
<v 2>who knows.
I want to be respectful of your time,</v>

1482
01:28:23.461 --> 01:28:28.350
so I just have just a few more questions for you.
These are,

1483
01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:33.900
these are my,
some of my usual questions that I like to ask.

1484
01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:35.460
The first is,

1485
01:28:35.610 --> 01:28:40.610
what book or books have you given as gifts to other people besides your own?

1486
01:28:41.890 --> 01:28:45.990
<v 3>Oh,
that's a bad I that I can answer.
Um,</v>

1487
01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:48.310
so this year for each of the last few years,

1488
01:28:48.311 --> 01:28:50.900
I've given one book to a bunch of people.
And,
um,

1489
01:28:51.730 --> 01:28:54.310
this year it's a book by Robert Reich called why Buddhism is true.

1490
01:28:54.610 --> 01:28:59.440
And it's a story about mindfulness and about the science of Buddhism in the

1491
01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.620
current neuroscience about how minds work,

1492
01:29:01.650 --> 01:29:06.120
making the argument that this game is people have said about mindfulness,

1493
01:29:06.121 --> 01:29:06.540
meditate,

1494
01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:10.530
meditation and the way it changes your capacity to empathize with other people

1495
01:29:10.531 --> 01:29:13.050
or just sort of break out of the tribalism that we're all walked into.

1496
01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:16.560
The things that Buddhism has said about that turned out to be scientifically

1497
01:29:16.561 --> 01:29:19.440
correct.
And here's a story about wine.
Wonderful Book.

1498
01:29:19.441 --> 01:29:22.590
Robert Wright as one of the smartest writers I've ever read his book non zero
is,

1499
01:29:22.770 --> 01:29:24.600
you know,
among my five favorite books of all time.

1500
01:29:24.690 --> 01:29:27.700
So that book came out recently and I gave that to um,

1501
01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:30.780
my closest friends and my family the year before.

1502
01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:34.720
I gave a book by the rest of Macfarquhar called strangers drowning because his

1503
01:29:34.730 --> 01:29:38.430
story about people who make extraordinary moral choices,

1504
01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:42.260
like the choice to adopt 23 children and bring them into your lives,

1505
01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:46.860
you just make crazy choices and why they make those choices.

1506
01:29:46.861 --> 01:29:49.410
And Marissa is one of the smartest writers at the New Yorker.

1507
01:29:49.411 --> 01:29:51.930
Everything she writes is absolutely brilliant and the book is brilliant,

1508
01:29:51.931 --> 01:29:52.531
beginning to end.

1509
01:29:52.531 --> 01:29:55.830
It's sort of 10 discrete chapters about people who make choices like that.

1510
01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:59.520
So I gave him the rest of his book last year and I'm proud of Wright's book this

1511
01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:00.353
year.

1512
01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:08.150
<v 2>Yeah,
they're good.
Totally worth reading both of them.
Yeah,
they're on the,</v>

1513
01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:12.870
she's always on the bottom right hand corner of my notes that I take during

1514
01:30:12.871 --> 01:30:16.640
these conversations.
Uh,

1515
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:21.600
uh,
see him picking.

1516
01:30:22.110 --> 01:30:26.640
Picking here in the last few years,
could be five years,
could be 10,

1517
01:30:26.641 --> 01:30:28.500
could be to what behavior,

1518
01:30:28.530 --> 01:30:33.180
new behavior or belief has most improved positively impacted your life,

1519
01:30:33.210 --> 01:30:36.270
would you say?
Or has just had a very significant impact?

1520
01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:41.280
<v 3>Um,
you know,
so my kids are nine,
seven and four now.</v>

1521
01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:46.340
And thinking about the responsibilities one has to your children who will

1522
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.710
outlive you and who in certain ways we'll carry on your personality,
um,

1523
01:30:53.190 --> 01:30:55.050
you carry on your life after you're gone.

1524
01:30:55.590 --> 01:31:00.540
I'm thinking through my responsibilities to them.
The,
how the choices I make are,

1525
01:31:00.541 --> 01:31:04.890
will be viewed by them when they're older.
I'm thinking about both,

1526
01:31:04.891 --> 01:31:08.010
how I can help them thrive and be the people they want to become.

1527
01:31:08.011 --> 01:31:12.840
And also how I can be somebody who when I'm gone,
they admire.

1528
01:31:12.990 --> 01:31:16.590
Um,
those are,
those are pretty,
those are deeply profound things.

1529
01:31:16.591 --> 01:31:18.120
And you know,

1530
01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:22.210
I had had no capacity of what it was like that children before I had children

1531
01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:25.740
where none.
Um,
uh,
but it's,

1532
01:31:25.770 --> 01:31:30.120
it's psychologically profound on,
in every,
every way.
So definitely that

1533
01:31:32.750 --> 01:31:37.750
<v 2>or books or anything else that you found particularly helpful as a parent</v>

1534
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:42.290
<v 3>with?
Um,
I don't,
you know,</v>

1535
01:31:42.450 --> 01:31:47.450
I don't think I've actually read a book on parenting that changed my philosophy.

1536
01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:49.910
Parents,
I mean,
there are a couple of books about how to get your kids to sleep,

1537
01:31:49.911 --> 01:31:53.300
which is like useful technical stuff.
I haven't read,
you know,
that's interesting.

1538
01:31:53.301 --> 01:31:55.370
I don't think I've read a book on parenting.
I was like,
oh,

1539
01:31:55.371 --> 01:31:57.650
I should raise my child that way or I should talk to them this way.

1540
01:31:57.651 --> 01:32:01.390
It's been much more,
um,
just,

1541
01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:03.400
just do it and just thinking through,
Oh wait,

1542
01:32:03.401 --> 01:32:07.240
that wasn't the right way to talk about this,
or Oh yes,
let's try to set them,

1543
01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:10.510
you know,
set them up for success in this way.
Or like let's let them do this.

1544
01:32:10.511 --> 01:32:11.740
So let's,
let's go do this with them.

1545
01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:16.020
<v 2>You mentioned the why Buddhism is true.</v>

1546
01:32:16.021 --> 01:32:18.300
Do you have a meditation or mindfulness practice?

1547
01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:23.520
<v 3>Um,
I kind of think the running is the substitute for that.</v>

1548
01:32:23.521 --> 01:32:25.440
And when I'm running I do,
it's very much,

1549
01:32:25.770 --> 01:32:28.920
I don't think it's that dissimilar from mindfulness meditation because when I

1550
01:32:28.921 --> 01:32:32.100
run,
um,
I will be,
I guess there are two things I'd say to that.

1551
01:32:32.101 --> 01:32:36.270
One is the writing.
So,
you know,
do during much try to,
um,

1552
01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:38.880
I had to listen to podcasts or if I'm not listening to podcasts,

1553
01:32:38.881 --> 01:32:41.070
I'm thinking about like trying to clear my mind,

1554
01:32:41.071 --> 01:32:44.490
are thinking to specific things and trying to concentrate on it or paying

1555
01:32:44.491 --> 01:32:47.120
attention to what I see or what I hear.
Um,

1556
01:32:47.130 --> 01:32:50.450
so I think that's reasonably close to mindfulness meditation.

1557
01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:53.040
And then the second thing is I do Alexander Technique,

1558
01:32:53.490 --> 01:32:57.420
which is a technique I learned for playing the car just for how one positions

1559
01:32:57.421 --> 01:33:00.510
one bite and one's body and like aligning your heads and make sure it's straight

1560
01:33:00.511 --> 01:33:02.580
but your back and they sure your feet are solid in the crown.

1561
01:33:02.890 --> 01:33:04.570
And it was something I did when I was having,
um,

1562
01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:07.560
a lot of wrist pain from playing guitar far too much.
And I think that's,

1563
01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:12.060
that's a sort of a century techniques that also plays a similar,
similar role.

1564
01:33:12.630 --> 01:33:17.440
Um,
but I,
I've,
you know,
I have not figured out how to work a meditation into,

1565
01:33:17.490 --> 01:33:18.323
into my life.

1566
01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:22.350
<v 2>The Alexander Technique is something that you use while you're sitting in a</v>

1567
01:33:22.351 --> 01:33:25.090
chair throughout the day.
When does that,

1568
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:27.870
<v 3>yeah,
so something I think about of course,</v>

1569
01:33:27.871 --> 01:33:31.830
as soon as I say it and I find myself like adjusting myself on the chair.
Yeah.

1570
01:33:31.831 --> 01:33:35.070
It's something where whenever I'm kind of out of position or I can feel like

1571
01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:38.650
something's not aligned,
I straighten up,
paid.

1572
01:33:38.670 --> 01:33:41.800
I'll try to think about where I wash my hands,
right.
I just to do just,
okay,

1573
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:42.451
make sure my back,

1574
01:33:42.451 --> 01:33:45.510
it's the line in my hand is line and it's something that I think has prevented a

1575
01:33:45.511 --> 01:33:48.810
lot of injuries almost.
I've never gotten hurt while running.
So even though,

1576
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:51.930
you know,
running,
running a distance that often we'll get people hurt.

1577
01:33:51.931 --> 01:33:54.420
And I think it's partly due to postural training,

1578
01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:05.210
<v 2>the question that stumps people,
but you've been pretty fast on your feet,</v>

1579
01:34:05.211 --> 01:34:10.010
so if you need to buy some time or pass,
that's fine as well.
If you could have a,

1580
01:34:10.730 --> 01:34:13.580
if you had this really metaphorically speaking,

1581
01:34:13.581 --> 01:34:17.570
a giant billboard on which you could put a word,
a question,
a quote,

1582
01:34:17.630 --> 01:34:19.370
someone else's quote,
a question,

1583
01:34:19.371 --> 01:34:23.290
anything really a message to get out to millions or billions of people,

1584
01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:24.800
what might you put on that billboard?

1585
01:34:26.030 --> 01:34:29.580
<v 3>Uh,
you know what it is?
I'm not gonna get the exact quote,
right,</v>

1586
01:34:29.581 --> 01:34:31.860
which means I'd have to stop,
check it,

1587
01:34:31.861 --> 01:34:35.370
but there's something that George Kennan said that,
um,

1588
01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:39.500
I just find like incredibly philosophically profound,
uh,

1589
01:34:39.570 --> 01:34:41.880
which is something I think about a lot.
Um,

1590
01:34:42.150 --> 01:34:43.590
not enough to remember the exact words,

1591
01:34:43.591 --> 01:34:48.591
but the idea was when you look at everything that goes wrong historically,

1592
01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:55.260
you can see deep chain of continuous mistakes that lead up to it.

1593
01:34:55.890 --> 01:34:59.710
And in a way that's really discouraging because it makes you think about like

1594
01:34:59.750 --> 01:35:03.170
each step,
like leading to greater consequences.
But on the other hand,

1595
01:35:03.171 --> 01:35:06.080
it's really encouraging because if you think about it and you think about,

1596
01:35:06.110 --> 01:35:09.620
oh wait,
what?
Did you do something right?
Can you do something?
Right?

1597
01:35:09.621 --> 01:35:13.040
Right now you're starting a whole another chain of events that can lead to a

1598
01:35:13.041 --> 01:35:16.430
really positive outcome.
And so his point when he was making the statement,

1599
01:35:16.431 --> 01:35:20.810
which is more or less that is even if things seem like they're going in the

1600
01:35:20.811 --> 01:35:22.580
wrong direction or things seem really wrong,

1601
01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:25.910
like you can stop and you can do something small.
That's right.

1602
01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:29.810
And then that will begin another chain of events that will lead to something

1603
01:35:29.811 --> 01:35:30.500
really good.

1604
01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:34.880
And so I often think about that when I'm thinking about whatever the next thing

1605
01:35:34.881 --> 01:35:37.130
I'm going to do is,
or the next moment is,
right.
You just are,

1606
01:35:37.131 --> 01:35:40.100
you're beginning a new chain of events and your chain of events that will lead

1607
01:35:40.101 --> 01:35:42.920
you in the right direction or you continue.
We did a good chance.
So it was,

1608
01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:46.430
it was bad idea from Ken and it was based on his historical studies I think

1609
01:35:46.431 --> 01:35:47.264
about a lot.

1610
01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:56.630
<v 2>Yeah,
it's been great talking to you.
Thank you for taking the time.</v>

1611
01:35:56.930 --> 01:36:00.290
Do you have any final words of the audience recommendation?

1612
01:36:00.291 --> 01:36:02.150
Anything you'd like to say before we wrap up?

1613
01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:05.840
<v 3>No,
I,
I love talking to you.
I mean,
the thing I,</v>

1614
01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.390
I want love people to subscribe to wired and that would be great.

1615
01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:10.370
Everybody subscribes to wire it.
I'll be very happy

1616
01:36:11.450 --> 01:36:11.890
<v 2>journalists,</v>

1617
01:36:11.890 --> 01:36:14.970
<v 3>it's a complicated business particularly at this moment.</v>

1618
01:36:15.090 --> 01:36:16.470
So we would love your support

1619
01:36:17.570 --> 01:36:20.970
<v 2>and if they want to say hi on social and x,</v>

1620
01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:24.980
<v 3>talk to people all the time.
I at an annex,
Thompson on Twitter,
I'm on Linkedin,</v>

1621
01:36:24.981 --> 01:36:28.640
I'm on Facebook.
There's a private page.
The other page,
I love pocket people.

1622
01:36:28.641 --> 01:36:32.690
I love hearing feedback.
Um,
I'm very active in comments at all that dms are open.

1623
01:36:32.691 --> 01:36:35.210
So I'm available.
I'm around them on the Internet.

1624
01:36:38.010 --> 01:36:41.820
<v 2>Thank you again for taking the time.
This is a really fun conversation.</v>

1625
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:44.270
<v 3>We covered a lot of interesting ground.</v>

1626
01:36:44.271 --> 01:36:47.670
Thanks for your awesome questions and probing.
I was really stuck.

1627
01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:48.533
It was really fun.

1628
01:36:48.910 --> 01:36:51.410
<v 2>Yes,
of course.
My pleasure and to everybody listening,</v>

1629
01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:56.360
you can find links to everything wired,
the books,
resources,

1630
01:36:56.930 --> 01:36:59.660
and the Alexander Technique.

1631
01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:04.720
Among other things in the show notes for this episode and every other episode at

1632
01:37:05.001 --> 01:37:09.470
tim.blog/podcast.
Until next time,
thank you for listening.

1633
01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:15.250
<v 6>Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

1634
01:37:15.670 --> 01:37:18.280
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1635
01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:21.580
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1636
01:37:21.581 --> 01:37:25.720
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

1637
01:37:25.721 --> 01:37:29.710
little morsel of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very short

1638
01:37:29.711 --> 01:37:34.210
email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been pondering

1639
01:37:34.211 --> 01:37:37.930
over the week.
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1640
01:37:37.931 --> 01:37:41.380
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1641
01:37:41.381 --> 01:37:45.670
somehow dug up in the other world of the esoteric as I do.

1642
01:37:45.970 --> 01:37:50.970
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

1643
01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:54.340
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

1644
01:37:54.430 --> 01:37:59.400
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

1645
01:37:59.490 --> 01:38:01.650
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

1646
01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:05.240
Just go to four hour work week.com that's four hour work,

1647
01:38:05.241 --> 01:38:09.270
week.com all spelled out and just drop in your email and you'll get the very

1648
01:38:09.271 --> 01:38:11.850
next one.
And if you sign up,
I hope you enjoy it.

1649
01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:17.580
This episode is brought to you by Peloton and I'd heard about Peloton over and

1650
01:38:17.581 --> 01:38:18.390
over again,

1651
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:23.280
but I ended up getting a Peloton bike and the whole system after I saw my buddy

1652
01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:26.400
Kevin Rose,
I've known him forever,
some of you know,

1653
01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:31.460
and he showed up at my gate at my house a while back and he looked fantastic.

1654
01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:36.720
You've got,
I asked,
was it,
dude,
you look great.
What the hell have you been up to?

1655
01:38:36.721 --> 01:38:38.850
Because he's always doing a weird diet or another,

1656
01:38:38.851 --> 01:38:40.350
but it only lasts like a week or two.

1657
01:38:40.410 --> 01:38:44.220
So he always regresses to the mean after like 75 beers and he said,

1658
01:38:44.221 --> 01:38:46.770
I've been doing Peloton five days a week now.

1659
01:38:46.770 --> 01:38:51.480
That caught my attention because Kevin does nothing five days a week and you

1660
01:38:51.481 --> 01:38:54.720
know,
I love you Kevin,
but it really peaked my curiosity.

1661
01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:59.780
Ended up getting a system and it's become an integral part of my week.

1662
01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:04.680
I love it and I really didn't expect to love it at all because I find cycling

1663
01:39:04.681 --> 01:39:06.270
really boring usually.

1664
01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:11.360
But peloton is an indoor cycling bike that brings live studio classes right into

1665
01:39:11.371 --> 01:39:12.204
your home.

1666
01:39:12.270 --> 01:39:14.820
You don't have to worry about fitting classes in your schedule or making it to a

1667
01:39:14.821 --> 01:39:16.800
studio with some type of commute,

1668
01:39:16.801 --> 01:39:21.330
etc. New classes are added every day and this includes options led by elite New

1669
01:39:21.330 --> 01:39:22.770
York City instructors in your own living room.

1670
01:39:23.130 --> 01:39:26.850
You can even livestream studio classes taught by the world's best instructors or

1671
01:39:26.851 --> 01:39:29.850
find your own favorite class on demand.
And in fact,

1672
01:39:29.851 --> 01:39:34.080
Kevin and I rarely do live classes and you can compete with your friends,

1673
01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:35.670
which is also fun.
Kevin,

1674
01:39:35.671 --> 01:39:39.840
I'm coming after you but we usually just use classes on demand.

1675
01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:44.880
I really like Matt Wilbur's and his iron high intensity training sessions that

1676
01:39:44.881 --> 01:39:49.881
are shorter like 20 minutes and I think Kevin's favorite is Alex and everyone

1677
01:39:50.701 --> 01:39:55.290
seems to have their favorite instructor or you can select by music duration and

1678
01:39:55.291 --> 01:39:56.124
so on.

1679
01:39:56.190 --> 01:40:01.170
Each Peloton bike includes a 22 inch HD touchscreen performance tracking
metrics.

1680
01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:05.790
I think that along with the realtime leaderboard are the main reasons that this

1681
01:40:05.791 --> 01:40:10.140
caught my attention when cycling never had caught my attention before.

1682
01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:13.680
It's really pretty stunning what they've done with the user interface to keep

1683
01:40:13.681 --> 01:40:14.514
your attention.

1684
01:40:14.670 --> 01:40:18.630
The belt drive is quiet and it's smaller than you'd expect so it can fit in a

1685
01:40:18.631 --> 01:40:19.950
living room or an office.

1686
01:40:20.010 --> 01:40:25.010
I actually have it in a large closet of believe it or not and it fits with no

1687
01:40:25.591 --> 01:40:29.040
problem.
So peloton is offering all of you guys,

1688
01:40:29.170 --> 01:40:30.990
listeners of the Tim Ferriss show,

1689
01:40:30.991 --> 01:40:35.991
a special offer and it is actually special visit one Peloton that's o n e p e l

1690
01:40:37.591 --> 01:40:42.591
o t o n one peloton.com and enter the code Tim all caps Tim at checkout to

1691
01:40:43.591 --> 01:40:47.670
receive $100 off accessories with your Peloton bike purchase.

1692
01:40:47.670 --> 01:40:49.800
Now you might say bath accessories.
Wait,

1693
01:40:49.801 --> 01:40:54.400
I don't need fancy towels or whatever other bits and pieces.

1694
01:40:54.610 --> 01:40:56.680
No,
the shoes you need,

1695
01:40:56.681 --> 01:40:59.680
you need the clip in shoes and those are in the accessory category.

1696
01:40:59.681 --> 01:41:03.190
So this hundred dollars off is a very legit,
$100 off.
