Optimal at this altitude,

00:00:02.811 --> 00:00:06.100
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

I'm a cybernetic organism living this yoga method.

<v 1>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.
I get asked all the time,</v>

6
00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:29.340
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?
In?

7
00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:31.830
My answer is inevitably athletic Greens.

It is your all in one nutritional insurance.

9
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:36.060
I recommended it in the four hour body,

10
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.080
did not get paid for that and I travel with it to avoid getting sick.

11
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.110
I take it in the mornings to ensure optimal performance.

12
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.580
It just covers all my basis.

13
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.600
If I can't get what I need through whole food meals throughout the rest of the

14
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.460
day,
and you can get 50 oh my gosh,
50% off.
Yes,

This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

37
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.990
I am so excited for this episode.
You have no idea,

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.990
but I'll try to give you an idea.
It's full of announcements,

39
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.580
full of cool projects that I've been working on for a very long time and now

40
00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:27.960
it's been number one,
the Tim Ferriss experiment,

41
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.540
which was an entire season of television,

42
00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:33.750
13 episodes that was exact produced,

43
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.470
hosted by yours truly alongside the Emmy award winning team behind.

44

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.950
Next we have the Tao of Seneca.
What is the town of Seneca?

53
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:12.784
Well,

54
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.910
there's a collection of letters called the moral letters to Luke killies and I

55
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:24.010
have read this entire collection of letters and other letters of Seneca the

56
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:27.580
author,
probably more than 100 times.

57
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:32.080
It was my constant companion for the last 10 to 20 years,

58
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.200
and I have given various forms of these letters to more friends than I can count

59
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.310
and several hundred acquaintances.
I feel that strongly about it.

60
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:45.160
So when people ask me what my favorite book is of all time,

61
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.650
I say this collection of letters,

62
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.330
the problem has been there is no good audio edition.

63
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.210
That was the objective.
So I,

64
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:58.750
for many months now in collaboration with a fan,

65
00:03:58.751 --> 00:03:59.950
actually a listener and a reader,

66
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:04.930
John Robinson had been collaborating to put together the Tao of Seneca subtitle,

67
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:09.820
practical letters from a stoic master three volumes and it covers them all.

68
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.810
Here's the description.

69
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.580
The Tao of Seneca is an introduction to stoke philosophy through the words of

70
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:19.270
Seneca thought leaders in Silicon Valley tout the benefits of stoicism.

71
00:04:19.271 --> 00:04:22.030
And I'm not just referring to me,
they're not referring to me at all.

72
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:26.260
Actually many others and NFL management coaches and players like have embraced

73
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:28.960
it because the principals make them better competitors.

74
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.610
Stoicism is a no nonsense philosophical system designed to produce dramatic real

75
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:34.600
world effects.

76
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.290
Think of it as an ideal operating system for thriving in high stress

77
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:39.100
environments.

78
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.100
This is your guide and you can find this on audible,

79
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.930

80
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:51.070
I'll take you to my book club where I acquire audio rights and produce books

81
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:55.180
that have had a huge impact on my life.
This is at the top of the list,

82
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.083
Tao of Seneca,

83
00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.430
number one most impactful collection of writing on my life period.

84
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:01.264
So please check it out.

85
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.270
audible.com forward slash Tim's books and there's a sample in this episode that

86
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:08.800
is what this episode consists of.

87
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.520
Letter 13 specifically on groundless fears.

88
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.630
It is a 12 minute letter.
I think you will enjoy it greatly.

89
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:18.490
Give it a few minutes,
get warmed up.

90
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.030
Seneca sometimes has a bit of a preamble at the beginning of his letters and

91
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:25.330
I'll also give you the preface to the book that I put together,

92
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:26.890
which will give you a lot more context,

93
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.770
but on this letter specifically on groundless fierce,

94
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:33.490
give it a couple of minutes and also for the women listening,

95
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.790
this is 2000 years old and Seneca makes comments like manliness gains much

96
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:42.400
strength from dot,
dot,
dot,
dot,
dot,
right.

97
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.460
You can just substitute humans and it is as applicable to women as it is two men

98
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.473
certainly.

99
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.110
And at the end of the preface I list off some of my favorite letters so you can

100
00:05:53.111 --> 00:05:55.060
jump around and pick and choose.

101
00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.120
I encourage you to treat the Tao of Seneca as a buffet of letters you can choose

102
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:05.141
from and revisit often and if you do decide to get the volume one for instance,

103
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:09.320
volume two,
volume three I do have a very long version,

104
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:13.490
an essay version of on the shortness of life to start off with.

105
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:16.370
That is a long one.
That is about an hour,
hour and a half.

106
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.700
You can skip over that if it's too long.
That is where I'll leave things.

107
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.170
I am so excited to bring this to you and so excited for you.

108
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:26.840
If you haven't heard Seneca before,
you will hear the preface.

109
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.520
You can skip through that if you want,

110
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.790
which I read and then let her 13 on groundless fears.

111
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.110
Check it out.
The town of Seneca,

audible.com forward slash Tim's books and joy.

113
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.900
This is Tim Ferriss speaking the producer of this audio book.
I have an author,

114
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.770
perhaps best known for books with titles at sound like infomercial products,

115
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:53.240
the four hour workweek and the four hour body which are published in about 45

116
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:54.170
languages or so.

117
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.150
And I am a tech investor and I've been involved early stage and companies like

118
00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:03.440
Facebook,
Twitter,
Uber,
Alibaba,
and perhaps 30 others.

119
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:08.441
I only bring up this background because I credit my successes,

120
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.470
whatever they might be in many fields including those tango,

121
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:17.510
etc. To stoicism and to reading the writing of specifically Seneca,

122
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.850
and that is why I've put so much time into assembling and compiling this book.

123
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.080
And with the help of John bringing it to you,

124
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.670
that is the narrator John Robinson,

125
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.730
a few of us consider ourselves philosophers of course,

126
00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:36.620
and this is usually for very good reasons.

127
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:41.630
Most of us can recall at least one very irritating pseudo intellectual probably

128
00:07:41.631 --> 00:07:42.141
in college,

129
00:07:42.141 --> 00:07:46.730
who dedicated countless hours to some type of philosophical tail chasing.

130
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.960
And so we associate philosophy with this type of behavior for what?

131
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.350
Well maybe this person was debating what is is,

132
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.580
but somehow posturing as a superior intellect at meal time or over drinks.

133
00:07:58.581 --> 00:07:59.780
It's very irritating.

134
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.310
It's very useless and not unlike the bar scene in goodwill hunting perhaps,

135
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.290
but it is for academics and I think it is for theory.

136
00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:11.510
These are beliefs that many of us have about philosophy.

137
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:15.770
It's something that you do over wine for fun,
but it doesn't apply to real life.

138
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:17.150
Fortunately,

139
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:22.180
there are a few no nonsense philosophical systems that can produce dramatic real

140
00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:26.390
world effects and results.
These were forged and refined an action,

141
00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:29.600
sometimes war stoicism is to me,

142
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:34.460
perhaps one of the best examples of that and that's what we'll focus on.

143
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.700
Think of it as an ideal operating system for thriving in high stress

144
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.480
environments and that is certainly why it's gained a huge foothold in silicon

145
00:08:44.481 --> 00:08:48.980
valley as one example and professional sports.
So if you study stoicism,

146
00:08:48.981 --> 00:08:50.720
you'll be in very good company.

147
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.140
It's a rule book for making better decisions.

148
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.180
It was popular with the educated elite of the Greco Roman Empire,

149
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.390
but Thomas Jefferson also had Seneca on his bedside table.

150
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.140
Montana had a quote from epic T-TESS carved into the ceiling of his house where

151
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:05.520
he would see it constantly.

152
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.620
Bill Clinton reads meditations by Marcus Aurelius every year in the NFL,

153
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.800
and this has become big news with an article in sports illustrated.

154
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:15.900
Management coaches and players alike,

155
00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:19.920
including teams like the Patriots and Seahawks have embraced to us isn't because

156
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:21.720
it makes them better competitors.

157
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:26.400
Other proponents include John Stuart Mill and Tom Wolfe.
As I record this,

158
00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:29.010
you might hear that my voice is a little hoarse.

159
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.820
I just finished a 10 day water only fast,

160
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.210
and I don't necessarily recommend doing that,

161
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.240
but it's part of a practice that comes directly from the writing of Seneca

162
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.050
specifically let her 18 which you'll hear on festivals and fasting.

163
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:51.050
And here is an excerpt to give you a flavor set aside a certain number of days

164
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.410
during which you shall be content with the scanty dust and cheapest affair with

165
00:09:55.411 --> 00:10:00.411
coarse and rough dress sang to yourself all the while is this the condition I so

166
00:10:00.841 --> 00:10:01.674
feared,

167
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.970
it is precisely in times of immunity from care that the soul should toughen

168
00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:08.700
itself beforehand for occasions of greater stress.

169
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:13.320
And it is wild fortune is kind that it should fortify itself against her

170
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:17.940
violence and it goes on and on.
But that particular passage,

171
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:19.920
and there's,
there's a lot more context to it,

172
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:24.950
led me to the practice of taking a few days per month to eat the cheapest food.

173
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.020
So for instance,
rice and beans,
every meal,

174
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.540
rice and beans costs one to $2 a day.

175
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.300
If you break it down wearing the same clothing.

176
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:38.330
So the same white tee shirt and pair of jeans remaining unshaven asking myself

177
00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:41.820
all the while,
is this the condition I so feared?
What does that mean?

178
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:46.350
It means that you are a [inaudible] yourself against unfounded fears.

179
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:50.310
Because when I find myself defensive,

180
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:55.460
fearful of losing whatever success or money or prestige or status I might have,

181
00:10:56.371 --> 00:11:00.210
whatever that is,
or it could be any number of other types of fears,

182
00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:04.320
they're usually nebulous.
You worry that your quality of life will drop.

183
00:11:04.321 --> 00:11:08.100
You'll be very unhappy.
But if you rehearse that condition,

184
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.460
the worst case scenario,
you realize that it's not that bad.

185
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.220
And that is tremendously empowering.

186
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.830
It allows you to make better investment decisions.

187
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.970
It allows you to take the steps to start your own company,
quit your job,

188
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:25.140
start a relationship and a relationship because you are rehearsing the worst

189
00:11:25.141 --> 00:11:29.280
case scenarios instead of letting them bounce around in your skull in a very

190
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.140
unformed,
nebulous way.

191
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:35.820
So that is one of dozens of examples that I could give you.

192
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.420
The principles are timeless and incredibly practical,

193
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:44.190
and I particularly like Seneca.
I love Marcus,
really.
I love Epictetus,

194
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:48.480
but I particularly love Seneca because it's easy to read.

195
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:53.510
It's pithy and the practices can be applied directly to your life.

196
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.150
Now,

197
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:58.990
if you were to take some of these letters and replace the name's Luke alias and

198
00:11:58.991 --> 00:12:03.550
other Roman sounding names with John Mary Edward,

199
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:07.690
they would read like letters from one of your contemporary or friends to
another.

200
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.650
Hey John,
so sorry to hear that you're dealing with that frivolous lawsuit.

201
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.700
Let me tell you how I handled this and how I deal with backstabbing and the

202
00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:19.210
Senate and give you a few tips.
Hey Mary,

203
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:23.500
I'm so sorry to hear that your friend's mother passed away.

204
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:26.710
Here's how you might console her,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

205
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:31.600
They are extremely memorable and that is because Seneca was one of the most

206
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:36.790
famous playwrights of his day and that leads to another point.
His principles,

207
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.460
his philosophies were used on the front lines.

208
00:12:39.461 --> 00:12:44.050
He was one of the wealthiest people in Rome as ineffective and investment
banker.

209
00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:48.460
I suppose you could think of him as such.
He was also an advisor to the emperor.

210
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.940
Ah,
that didn't always work out all too well for him that,

211
00:12:51.941 --> 00:12:53.170
but that's part of stoicism.

212
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:57.550
The point being that he was worldclass in several fields.

213
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.150
He had to deal with uncooperative,
powerful in many cases,

214
00:13:01.151 --> 00:13:04.480
human beings all the time and he was able to do well.

215
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.380
And I think that's what separates the philosophers so to speak,

216
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:13.590
who actually can put rubber to the road and make things happen and philosophy

217
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.340
ologists uh,

218
00:13:15.341 --> 00:13:19.200
as many other people have said to those people who speculate the armchair

219
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.660
quarterbacks,
Seneca was not one of these people.
He was,

220
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.000
he was getting his hands dirty and doing big things.

221
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.200
And the way I suggest you approach this,

222
00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.650
and this is certainly the way I have approached it and many people have,

223
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.160
is making Seneca part of your daily practice.

224
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.690
And the way that you do that is set aside 10 to 15 minutes a day.
For me,

225
00:13:40.691 --> 00:13:44.500
it is often walking to get my morning cup of coffee and I will listen to one

226
00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:47.680
letter a day.
And this is highly therapeutic.

227
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:52.890
It is highly effective as a habit if you want to be more successful in any area.

228
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:57.910
Personal or professional stoke principles are often practiced in rehabilitation

229
00:13:57.911 --> 00:14:01.210
clinics.
For instance,
with alcoholics,
they don't succumb to impulses.

230
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.710
In the most practical sense,

231
00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:06.700
I suppose it does share a lot in common with cognitive behavioral therapy.

232
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:07.841
In a sense.

233
00:14:07.841 --> 00:14:11.200
You could think of it as putting the first portion of the serenity prayer into

234
00:14:11.201 --> 00:14:12.034
action,

235
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:16.090
which reads there many translations of course as God grant me the serenity to

236
00:14:16.091 --> 00:14:17.650
accept the things I cannot change,

237
00:14:17.651 --> 00:14:21.850
the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.

238
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:26.680
Stoicism is the training ground for putting this into action so you have to

239
00:14:26.681 --> 00:14:30.220
digest it just like good nutrition a little bit every day.

240
00:14:30.221 --> 00:14:33.940
Put in the time one letter,
five to 15 minutes.

241
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.850
It might've been porn on the porch of Xeno,

242
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:41.800
but it can be used everywhere in the concrete jungle and I'll recommend a few

243
00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:42.700
letters to start with.

244
00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.130
If you want to bounce around and I suggest you listen to all of them,

245
00:14:45.131 --> 00:14:47.530
they will apply to you in your life at different points.

246
00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.890
Three of my favorites are 13,

247
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.910
18 and 27 so let her 13 on groundless fears,

248
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.340
litter 18 on festivals and fasting.

249
00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:03.560
Let her 27 on the good which abides,
which is also hilarious.

250
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:08.420
Uh,
John Robinson,
his favorites do not overlap.
They will be very personal.

251
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.150
But if you want a few recommendations to start with,

252
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.650
start at the beginning of this audio book volume one because it features on the

253
00:15:15.651 --> 00:15:16.760
shortness of life,

254
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:21.710
which I read and listened to at least once a quarter,
usually once a month.

255
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:26.980
And then letters 1318 and 27 and I have to,

256
00:15:27.381 --> 00:15:31.790
before I part give a heartfelt thanks to John Robinson,

257
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:32.870
John Robinson,

258
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:37.310
I found on the Internet I was searching for an audio book of Seneca's letters

259
00:15:37.311 --> 00:15:39.170
and essays and I couldn't find it.

260
00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:42.350
And then one day John Robinson's website pops up.

261
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.810
It turns out he's a fan of mine.

262
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:49.340
And the four hour workweek heard me talking about Seneca in many different

263
00:15:49.341 --> 00:15:51.290
interviews,
tried to find an audio book.

264
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.130
Also couldn't decided to make it himself and put together,

265
00:15:55.131 --> 00:15:58.100
I think it was 10 to 30 draft essays.

266
00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:02.270
I downloaded them when I was in Costa Rica and needed some recalibration.

267
00:16:02.271 --> 00:16:06.380
I needed to address some unfounded fears of my own and I was blown away.

268
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.040
Whatever voice I had in my head for Seneca,
it was John.

269
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:14.060
It was perfect and I reached out to him.
We started to collaborate.

270
00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:17.600
We put this entire thing together and he has just been a superstar.

271
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:22.250
So thank you very much John,
and thank you to all of you for listening.

272
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.880
I am so excited and envious of you in a way.

273
00:16:25.881 --> 00:16:30.380
If you've never heard or been exposed to Seneca before and as he would say,

274
00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:31.783
take care.

275
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:37.070
Letter 13 on groundless fear.

276
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:45.140
I know that you have plenty of spirits for even before you began to equip

277
00:16:45.141 --> 00:16:49.820
yourself with maxims which were hold someone potent to overcome obstacles.

278
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:55.510
You were taking pride in your contest with fortune and this is all the more true

279
00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:01.270
now that you have grappled with fortune and tested your powers for our powers

280
00:17:01.341 --> 00:17:05.660
can never inspire in us implicit faith in ourselves except with many

281
00:17:05.661 --> 00:17:10.661
difficulties have confronted us on this side and on that and if occasionally

282
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.830
even come to close quarters with us.

283
00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.690
It is only in this way that the true spirits can be tested.

284
00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.700
The spirit that will never consent to come under the jurisdiction of things

285
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.890
external to ourselves.

286
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:28.430
This is the touchstone of such as spirit.

287
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:34.210
No prize fighter can go with high spirits into the strife if he has never been

288
00:17:34.251 --> 00:17:35.360
beaten,
black and blue.

289
00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:41.140
The only contestant who can confidently enter the list is the man who had seen

290
00:17:41.751 --> 00:17:42.710
his own blood,

291
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:48.310
was felt his teeth rattled beneath his opponents fist who has been tripped and

292
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.190
the full force

293
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:55.190
<v 2>of his adversaries charge who has been down in body but not in spirit.</v>

294
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.900
One Who as often as he falls,

295
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.710
rises again with greater defiance than ever.

296
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:08.330
So then to keep up my figure fortune has often in the past got the upper hand of

297
00:18:09.571 --> 00:18:12.600
you and yet you have not surrendered,

298
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.120
but have leaped up and stood your ground.

299
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:18.900
Still more eagerly for manliness gains,

300
00:18:18.901 --> 00:18:23.880
much strength by being challenged.
Nevertheless,
if you approve,

301
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:29.610
allow me to offer some additional safeguards by which you may fortify yourself.

302
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.670
There are more things Luke [inaudible],

303
00:18:32.671 --> 00:18:36.240
who's likely to frighten us than there are to crush us.

304
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:41.160
We suffer more often in imagination than in reality.

305
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.120
I am not speaking with you and the stoic strain,

306
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:50.510
but in my milder style for it is our stoic fashion to speak of all those things

307
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.610
which provoked,
cries and groans as unimportant and beneath.

308
00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:57.623
Notice.

309
00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:01.830
But you and I must drop such great sounding words,

310
00:19:01.831 --> 00:19:04.140
although heaven knows they are true enough.

311
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:10.040
What I advise you to do is not to be unhappy before the crisis comes.

312
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.060
Since it may be that the danger is before which you paled as if they were

313
00:19:15.061 --> 00:19:17.850
threatening you will never come upon you.

314
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:21.990
They certainly have not yet come accordingly.

315
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:27.140
Some things torment us more than they ought some tormentors before they ought

316
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.100
and some tormentors when they ought not to torment us at all.

317
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:37.820
We are in the habit of exaggerating or imagining or anticipating sorrow.

318
00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:44.940
The first of these three faults may be postponed for the present because the

319
00:19:44.941 --> 00:19:48.960
subject is under discussion and the case is still in court so to speak,

320
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.920
that which I should call trifling you will maintain to be most serious for.

321
00:19:55.411 --> 00:19:55.891
Of course,

322
00:19:55.891 --> 00:20:00.750
I know that some men laugh while being flogged and that other's wins at a box on

323
00:20:00.751 --> 00:20:01.584
the ear.

324
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:06.300
We shall consider later whether these evils derive their power from their own

325
00:20:06.301 --> 00:20:09.030
strength or from our own weakness.

326
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:11.940
Do me the favor.

327
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:16.920
When men surround you and try to talk you into believing that you are unhappy to

328
00:20:16.921 --> 00:20:18.390
consider not what you hear,

329
00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:23.760
what what you yourself feel and to take counsel with your feelings and question

330
00:20:24.151 --> 00:20:28.950
yourself independently because you know your own affairs better than anyone else

331
00:20:28.951 --> 00:20:30.780
does.
Ask.

332
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.830
Is there any reason why these persons should condole with me?

333
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:40.230
Why should they be worried or even fearsome infection from me as if troubles

334
00:20:40.231 --> 00:20:41.220
could be transmitted?

335
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:47.120
Is there any evil involved or is it a matter of merely of ill report rather than

336
00:20:47.891 --> 00:20:52.360
an evil?
Put the question voluntarily to yourself,

337
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.990
am I tormented without sufficient reason?

338
00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:01.420
Am I more roast and do I convert?
What is not an evil into what is an evil?

339
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.360
You may retort with the question,

340
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.770
how am I to know whether my sufferings are real or imaginary?

341
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.550
Here is the rule for such matters.

342
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:18.240
We are tormented either by things present or buy things to come or by both as to

343
00:21:20.351 --> 00:21:22.780
things present,
the decision is easy.

344
00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.610
Suppose that your person enjoys freedom and health and that you do not suffer

345
00:21:27.611 --> 00:21:31.750
from any external injury as to what may happen to it in the future.

346
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:37.260
We shall see later on today there is nothing wrong with it but you say something

347
00:21:39.251 --> 00:21:42.100
will happen to it.
First of all,

348
00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.010
consider whether your proofs of future trouble.

349
00:21:45.011 --> 00:21:50.011
Our sure for it is more often the case that we are troubled by our apprehensions

350
00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:56.580
and that we are marked by that marker rumor which is want to settle wars but

351
00:21:56.921 --> 00:22:00.760
much more often settles individuals.
Yes,

352
00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:02.320
my dear Lou killer use,

353
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:07.710
we agree to quickly with what people say we do not put to the test those things

354
00:22:07.961 --> 00:22:09.340
which cause our fear.

355
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.880
We do not examine into them we blench and retreat just like soldiers who are

356
00:22:15.221 --> 00:22:19.870
forced to abandon their camp because of a dust cloud raised by stampeding cattle

357
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:25.330
or thrown into a panic by the spreading of some unauthenticated rumor and

358
00:22:25.331 --> 00:22:26.470
somehow or other.

359
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:31.740
It is the idol report that disturbs us most for truth has its own definite

360
00:22:32.591 --> 00:22:33.424
boundaries,

361
00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:38.470
but that which arises from uncertainty is delivered over to guesswork and the

362
00:22:38.471 --> 00:22:41.650
irresponsible license of a frightened mind.

363
00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:47.520
That is why no fear is so ruinous and so uncontrollable as panic.

364
00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.640
Fear for other fears are groundless,

365
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.670
but this fear is witless.

366
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:58.690
Let us then look carefully into the matter.

367
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.990
It is likely that some troubles will befall us,

368
00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:04.810
but it is not a present fact.

369
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:08.830
How often has the unexpected happened?

370
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:14.520
How often has the expected never come to pass and even though it is ordained to

371
00:23:15.731 --> 00:23:19.870
be,
what does it avail to run out to meet your suffering?

372
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.470
You will suffer as soon enough when it arrives,

373
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.370
so look forward meanwhile to better things.

374
00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.540
What shall you gain by doing this time?

375
00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:34.660
There will be many happenings,
meanwhile,

376
00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:39.400
which will serve to postpone or end or pass on to another person.

377
00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:44.670
The trials which are near or even in your very presence of fire has opened the

378
00:23:45.771 --> 00:23:50.240
way to flight.
Men have been let down softly by a catastrophe.

379
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:55.220
Sometimes the sword has been checked even at the victims throat.

380
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:59.000
Men have survived their own executioners.

381
00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:03.320
Even bad fortune is fickle.
Perhaps it will come,

382
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:08.680
perhaps not in the meantime it is not so look forward to better things.

383
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:15.710
The mind at times fashions for itself,
false shapes of evil.

384
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:18.740
When there are no signs that point to any evil,

385
00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.290
it twists into the worst construction.

386
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.530
Some word of doubtful meaning or at fancy,

387
00:24:24.531 --> 00:24:29.480
some personal grudge to be more serious than it really is considering not how

388
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:33.260
angry the enemy is,
what to what lengths he may go.

389
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:35.360
If he is angry,

390
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:40.850
but life is not worth living and there was no limit to our sorrows.

391
00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:46.060
If we indulge our fears to the greatest possible extent in this matter,

392
00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:51.790
let prudence help you and contend with a resolute spirit even when it is in

393
00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:53.180
plain sight.

394
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:59.260
If you cannot do this counter one weakness with another and temper your fear

395
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:01.723
with hope,

396
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:07.040
there is nothing so certain among these objects of fear that it is not more

397
00:25:07.041 --> 00:25:12.041
certain still that things we dread sink into nothing and the things we hope for

398
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:16.880
mock us
accordingly.

399
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:21.860
Weigh carefully your hopes as well as your fears and whenever all the elements

400
00:25:21.861 --> 00:25:24.740
are in doubt,
decide in your own favor.

401
00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:30.370
Believe what you prefer and a fear wins the majority of the votes incline in the

402
00:25:31.281 --> 00:25:34.970
other direction anyhow and cease to harass your soul.

403
00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:37.940
Reflecting continually that most mortals,

404
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:42.530
even when no troubles are actually at hand or a certainly to be expected in the

405
00:25:42.531 --> 00:25:45.770
future,
become excited and disquieted.

406
00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:50.660
No one calls a halt on himself when he begins to be urged ahead,

407
00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.110
nor does he regulate his alarm according to the truth.

408
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:59.800
No one says the author of the story is a fool and he who has believed it is a

409
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:04.040
fool as well as he who fabricated it.

410
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.150
We let ourselves drift with every breeze.

411
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:12.380
We are frightened at uncertainties just as if they were certain.

412
00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:15.500
We observe no moderation.

413
00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:20.780
The slightest thing turns the scales and throws us forthwith into a panic,

414
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:27.260
but I am ashamed either to admonish you sternly or to try to beguile you with

415
00:26:27.261 --> 00:26:28.520
such mild remedies.

416
00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:34.180
Let another say perhaps the worst will not happen.

417
00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:40.190
You yourself must say,
well,
what if it does happen?

418
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.720
Let us see who wins.
Perhaps it for my best interests,

419
00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:48.420
it may be that such a death will shed credit upon my life.

420
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.980
Socrates was ennobled by the hemlock draft,

421
00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:57.090
wrenched from Kato's hand his sword,
the vindicator of liberty,

422
00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:00.600
and you deprive him of the greatest share of his glory.

423
00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:06.930
I am exhorting you far too long since you need reminding rather than

424
00:27:06.931 --> 00:27:07.764
exhortation.

425
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:12.240
The Path on which I am leading you is not different from that on which your

426
00:27:12.241 --> 00:27:16.860
nature lead you.
You were born to such conduct as I described.

427
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:22.350
Hence there is all the more reason why you should increase and beautify the good

428
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:26.550
that is in you.
But now to close my letter,

429
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.240
I have only to stamp the usual zeal upon it.
In other words,

430
00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:34.260
to commit there to some noble message to be delivered to you.

431
00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.080
The fool with all his other faults has this also.

432
00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:43.290
He is always getting ready to live,

433
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:50.150
reflect my esteemed looky loose what this sane means and you will see how

434
00:27:50.701 --> 00:27:55.701
revolting is the fickleness of men who laid down every day new foundations of

435
00:27:55.741 --> 00:28:00.741
life and begin to build up fresh hopes even at the brink of the grave.

436
00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:05.490
Look within your own mind for individual instances.

437
00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:10.200
You will think of old men who are preparing themselves at that very hour for a

438
00:28:10.201 --> 00:28:15.201
political career or for travel or for business and what his base.

439
00:28:15.601 --> 00:28:18.930
You're then getting ready to live when you were already old.

440
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.780
I should not name the author of this motto except that it is somewhat unknown to

441
00:28:24.781 --> 00:28:29.550
fame and it is not one of those popular sayings of epicurious which I have

442
00:28:29.551 --> 00:28:34.530
allowed myself to praise and to appropriate
farewell.

443
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.000
Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.

444
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.030
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

445
00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:48.300
Do you want to get a short email from me?

446
00:28:48.301 --> 00:28:52.440
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

447
00:28:52.441 --> 00:28:56.430
little morsel of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very short

448
00:28:56.431 --> 00:29:01.200
email where I share the coolest things I found or that I've been pondering over

449
00:29:01.201 --> 00:29:04.620
the week.
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

450
00:29:04.621 --> 00:29:08.100
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

451
00:29:08.101 --> 00:29:12.420
somehow dug up in the the world of the esoteric as I do.

452
00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:17.690
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

453
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:21.090
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

I used 99 designs to get book cover prototypes for the four hour body,

464
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.780
which went on to become a number one New York Times bestseller.

I get asked all the time,

475
00:30:35.111 --> 00:30:37.720
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?
In?

476
00:30:37.721 --> 00:30:40.210
My answer is inevitably athletic Greens.

477
00:30:40.211 --> 00:30:42.700
It is your all in one nutritional insurance.

478
00:30:42.701 --> 00:30:44.470
I recommended it in the four hour body,

479
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.460
did not get paid for that and I travel with it to avoid getting sick.

480
00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:51.490
I take it in the mornings to ensure optimal performance.

481
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:52.960
It just covers all my basis.

482
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:56.980
If I can't get what I need through whole food meals throughout the rest of the

483
00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:01.810
day,
and you can get 50 oh my God,
50% off.
Yes,
50% off.

487
00:31:15.871 --> 00:31:19.420
