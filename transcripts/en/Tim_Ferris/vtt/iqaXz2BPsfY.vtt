Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:07.420
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.
Are you else?

3
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.530
I'm a cybernetic organism,

4
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:23.700
so

5
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.280
<v 1>it is brought to you by a new sponsor,
so listen up folks.</v>

6
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:30.240
This is a good one because have you ever wanted to be as powerful as a bullet

7
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:35.241
wearing Ninja from 1980s movie or as flamboyant as big gay Al Big Al in south

8
00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:40.800
park or as sleek as a black panther in the Amazon on the hunt wealth?

9
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:44.850
There's great news because I've been testing this product that you wrap around

10
00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:48.990
your genitals and it makes you feel like a superhero and it is called me undies.

11
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.650
I've spent the last two to three weeks traveling with underwear from these guys

12
00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:54.960
and they are comfy.
I got to tell you,

13
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.610
it feels like a Geisha has giving your groin a hug and it's not just for dudes,

14
00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:04.320
but if you go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim,

There's some pretty ridiculous ones.
And I will also highlight my favorite,

18
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.630
you'll probably be able to guess which it is.

19
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.270
These underwear made from micro model,

20
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:22.620
which is extruded from Austrian beechwood trees in the Alps.
Yes.
Fancy.

21
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.420
And it's two times softer than cotton,

22
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.800
scientifically tested using the [inaudible] method developed in Kyoto.

23
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.480
You know those Japanese very crafty and uh,

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:43.770
am a bit of an underwear connoisseur,

fashion sense with sweat pants,

27
00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:45.810

Australia.

this episode is brought to you by 99 designs your one stop shop for all things

37
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:20.430
graphic design related.

38
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:25.431
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers including

39
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.130
sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

40
00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:33.120
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

41
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.961
the brainstorming.

42
00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:37.290
A lot of it took place with designers from around the world and here's how it

43
00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:41.490
works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,
a website,

44
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.070
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

45
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.790
you submit that project and designers from around the world.

46
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.430
We'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

47
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.120
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

48
00:02:54.121 --> 00:02:55.830
money back.
It's that straight forward.

49
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.530
And many of you who are listening have already used it and created some amazing

50
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:01.900
things that I'll be sharing in the future.
But in the meantime,

57
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.320
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

58
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.910
I've had a lot of whey protein,
I've had a lot of supplementation,

59
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.960
PCA's,

60
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.970
few other goodies like synthetic ketones and I am raring and roaring to go with

61
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:38.230
this episode.
So I don't want to give you too long of a prelude,

62
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:41.230
but if you haven't joined me before on the Tim Ferriss show,

63
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.590
this entire program is about deconstructing excellence.

64
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:49.570
It is about interviewing world class performers the best at what they do to

65
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:54.280
identify the rituals,
routines,
influences,
books,

66
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.950
tips and tools and so on that you can use.

67
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.400
So borrowing best practices from the best in the world.

68
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.520
And this episode we have a very fun guest.

69
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.450
He is widely requested and now he's here.

70
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.290
Chris Sacca or Chris Saka,
depending on how you say his name,

71
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.410
he was recently on the cover of Forbes magazine.

72
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.000
They're mitis issue and the title says Venture Cowboy,

73
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.860
the 39 year old behind Uber,
Twitter and Instagram might be the best angel ever.

74
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.370
So why all the bad blood and burned bridges.
And then the article,

75
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.400
if you look inside is titled how Super Angel Chris Saka made billions burned

76
00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:35.980
bridges and crafted the best seed portfolio ever.

77
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.060
I've known Chris for quite some time and I've mentioned before that in the game

78
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:43.360
of early stage investing,
I've learned a ton from a lot of people,

79
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.460
but three people stand out immediately.

80
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.310
Mike Maples Jr and then Chris Saka and novel Ramakant.

81
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.110
Those are three who've been very,
very generous with their time.

82
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.940
And this episode is wide ranging.
It's not just about investing,

83
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.890
it is about life design.
It is about career decisions and much,

84
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:06.700
much more.
So please enjoy my conversation with Chris Sacca.

85
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.100
Chris,
my fans have demanded it.
People have asked foreign wife,

86
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.340
you'd be on the show.
So thanks for

87
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.090
<v 2>cutting out some time in this spectacular trip.
Be psyched.
You're here.
We're,
uh,</v>

88
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.970
we're on Necker island in the British Virgin Islands.

89
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.250
And my first time to the Bvi,
it is paradise.
Not Too surprisingly.

90
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.850
And for people who don't have much context on you and number one,

91
00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:38.300
is it Sacca or Soka?
That's totally regional.
I'm from,

92
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.470
I'm from near Buffalo,
New York,
so it's Sanka it's very nasally.

93
00:05:42.471 --> 00:05:45.700
You gotta get it right.
And then to see it again.
I'm Chris Sacca.
Hey,

94
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:49.840
you guys use guys.
So do you introduce yourself a second?
Let's see.

95
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.180
What's your name?
Chris.
You know,

96
00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:55.030
I'm more of focused on spelling it cause I was like,
what the hell?
Something,

97
00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.730
I guess a CCA,
but I guess it's Saca.

98
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.920
Chris Sacca Sakhile comes off my sack.
Yeah.

99
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.770
<v 1>All right,
cool.
And you grew up,
like you said,
on the east coast.</v>

100
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.990
Uh,
but let's,
let's do a quick,
not entire retrospective,

101
00:06:10.991 --> 00:06:12.430
but to give people the present tense.

102
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.720
What are you best known for Cyber Professionally

103
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.740
<v 2>or personally?
Uh,
both.
The secretary that would amazing wife,
all three.</v>

104
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.860
So professionally I'm known for being a venture capitalists and Angel Investors

105
00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:30.130
and venture capitalists.
And I was one of the first investors in Twitter,

106
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.140
one of the first investors in Uber,
Instagram,
Kickstarter,

107
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.000
docker optimized Lee.
Um,

108
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.620
look out Twilio,
it's going down my unicorns.

109
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.380
<v 1>So you have,
you have this,
this,
uh,</v>

110
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.870
sort of Unicorn radar and the,
uh,

111
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.890
you,
you of course had the angel investing experience and then you had your fund

112
00:06:56.891 --> 00:07:00.430
experience.
Could you tell people a little bit about how that has gone for you

113
00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.420
<v 2>in terms of,
in terms of managing my funds,</v>

114
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.430
<v 1>your first,
you're just here for your first fund.</v>

115
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.480
I would assume that is one of the reasons why you were just recently on the

116
00:07:09.481 --> 00:07:11.870
cover of Forbes magazine.
Horrifyingly.

117
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.630
<v 2>Uh,
God,
he tell t shirt,
we can talk about the shirt.
Uh,
no.</v>

118
00:07:16.631 --> 00:07:18.790
So our first fund is turning out to,

119
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.030
it looks like it might be the most successful fund in the history of venture

120
00:07:22.031 --> 00:07:25.300
capital.
Um,
we had Twitter in there.

121
00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:29.080
We had to burn their Instagrams and their dockers still in their optimized is

122
00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:33.580
still in there.
We had some very cool stuff like Zen coder was in there.
Um,

123
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.720
so we've had some good deals that have gotten bought along the way,
but it's,
um,

124
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.830
it's,
uh,
it's,
it's just taken off like there's no,

125
00:07:43.831 --> 00:07:46.590
like no fund has ever done.
And you know,
right now it's,

126
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.690
I don't think Uber has done growing.
All right.
And so,
uh,
certainly hopes that,

127
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.010
yeah,
so we're at,

128
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:58.200
we're at somewhere around 250 x multiple on the fun.

129
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.080
<v 1>That's amazing.
And I want to,
I'll start off,</v>

130
00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:05.470
some people have followed our friendship over the years.

131
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:10.990
The heckling on the endless heckling on Twitter
and a

132
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:15.570
<v 2>like,
I,
I mean,
no,
it's,
I'm very sincere and authentic when I ask,
when do you and,</v>

133
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.120
and Kevin Rose are gonna release the podcast episode where you guys make out.

134
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.800
And Kevin told me that was behind the pay wall.
It's the bonus wrestling behind

135
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.340
<v 1>the paywall.</v>

136
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:27.500
And I think we have to wait until there's a slump in our careers and then you

137
00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:32.130
have that in your back pocket,
pull a car dash and reinvent ourselves.
Uh,
but the,

138
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:37.920
the gratitude I want to express first before we get into things,
uh,
is multifold.

139
00:08:37.921 --> 00:08:39.780
So some people have read the four hour body.

140
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.040
Might recall that I mentioned you in that book for introducing me to total

141
00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:48.030
immersion,
which was I think the first time we ever met you brought it up.

142
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:48.720
This is that the,

143
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.250
was that the barbecue that had Kira is actually through outside his apartment.

144
00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:57.780
And uh,
you said something along the lines of when I described how,

145
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.450
how bad I was at swimming and pretty much incapable of swimming.

146
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:03.720
You said I have the answer to your prayers.
It was a great response,

147
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.750
which ended up being accurate in this case and was total immersion swimming.

148
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:10.440
So I learned to swim for the first time properly in my thirties using that

149
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:11.580
method.
So thank you for that.

150
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:17.090
And also since the early days have been a very open book when it came to talking

151
00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:22.530
to you about investing and advising,
uh,
and of course the,

152
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:26.250
the legal notepad has been now transcribed into Evernote.

153
00:09:26.251 --> 00:09:31.110
So I have many soccer files that are all very favorable.
But how did you,

154
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.310
uh,
what were some of your formative experiences growing up?

155
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.490
<v 2>Uh,
well let me,
let me just talk to what you were just saying in terms of being</v>

156
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.270
generous with the,
I mean,
first of all,

157
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:48.300
the total immersion thing is like a religion.
When you get it,
you get it right.

158
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.870
And I went from dragging my ass around the pool,

159
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.320
just kicking too hard and paddling too hard too.
When total immersion at me,

160
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.200
I could suddenly swim a couple of miles and get bored.

161
00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:01.040
And so I was just there as an apostle man when you were like,

162
00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:02.470
I'm struggling with swimming.
And that was,

163
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.440
I was just geeking out in the same way you can get going on lifting techniques

164
00:10:06.441 --> 00:10:08.390
and stuff like that.
I'm like,
you're in my world now.
I'm going to,

165
00:10:08.391 --> 00:10:11.600
I'm going to talk about swimming.
But at the same of the investing stuff,
I mean,

166
00:10:11.601 --> 00:10:15.380
I was really lucky when it came time for me to get started as an investor.

167
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:19.970
I had many,
many guys.
They're paying it forward and teaching me about the game.

168
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.620
Guys like Josh Koppelman at first round,
Tony Conrad at true ventures,
uh,

169
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.740
really being generous with their time and helping me figure out what was going

170
00:10:27.741 --> 00:10:31.220
on.
The guys at industry ventures were indispensable for me,

171
00:10:31.221 --> 00:10:36.200
Hans Weldon's and his team.
And so,
um,
and so for me,

172
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.080
when you came along and started asking questions about that,

173
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.600
not only I feel like I was paying it forward again,

174
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.830
but in the same way you and I never invest in a simple idea.

175
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.510
The execution is everything.

176
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.340
I don't feel like I'm really giving any secrets away by telling you what the

177
00:10:52.341 --> 00:10:54.470
approach is.
You still have to go execute on it,
right?

178
00:10:54.471 --> 00:10:57.950
So I can give you my lens on how I think about this stuff and you know,

179
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.070
things other people have taught me things I think I might've improved upon,

180
00:11:01.071 --> 00:11:04.130
et cetera.
But I can,
I can lay that playbook on you.

181
00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.740
And if you're not good at this,
you can't fake it.

182
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:11.840
And so I don't have any fear and kind of disclosing my secrets to B teamers,

183
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.140
uh,
because they're not going to end up competing with me and your case.

184
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.273
You're good at it.

185
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:20.900
And so it's become an incredible side business for you in addition to everything

186
00:11:20.901 --> 00:11:23.480
you do,
you know,
with media.
Um,
but I,

187
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.820
but there's no fear and in putting that stuff out there.

188
00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:30.680
And the other lesson they taught me is that if I get to you and teach you some

189
00:11:30.681 --> 00:11:34.370
of this stuff,
you're going to naturally be an ally of mine in this industry.

190
00:11:34.371 --> 00:11:38.000
So if I can get in there and kind of teach you how do I think about the world,

191
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.900
how can I be helpful to companies and you start using that same method,

192
00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:44.330
then we're gonna end up doing deals together and you and I have and we've made a

193
00:11:44.331 --> 00:11:47.060
fair amount of money doing that.
And so,
um,
so I didn't,

194
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:48.410
I didn't want to leave that on answered.
Sure.

195
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.490
<v 1>Well,
I,
uh,
it's,</v>

196
00:11:51.491 --> 00:11:56.491
it's really been fun to watch you sort of evolve and grow and experiment also in

197
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.780
investing in just coming back.
You know,
we can,

198
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:02.740
we can rewind the clock back to your upbringing a little bit later on,

199
00:12:02.741 --> 00:12:04.840
but just since we're on the topic,
what were,

200
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:08.290
what were some of the pieces of advice that you were given by say the guys that

201
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:13.291
you mentioned or other people early on that helped you to approach early stage

202
00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:17.770
investing in a more intelligent way?

203
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:19.763
<v 2>Yeah,
I mean,</v>

204
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.790
a couple of guys have said things that I've now taken an animal gam and of

205
00:12:23.791 --> 00:12:24.624
codified.

206
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.770
So I have rules for investing now that were definitely influenced by a lot of

207
00:12:28.771 --> 00:12:31.080
these guys give me advice and things that I've now put to work.

208
00:12:31.081 --> 00:12:35.280
So one is only get involved in deals,
Ryan.
No,

209
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.800
I can personally impact the outcome.

210
00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:41.240
Now there's no guarantee that I can take it from,
you know,

211
00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.800
x to sold or x to IPO.

212
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.640
But I need to know that I can have a material impact to make something that's,

213
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.220
um,
to make something more likely to succeed.

214
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.100
So the second reel I've developed,

215
00:12:53.101 --> 00:12:55.230
and this again influenced by guys along the way,

216
00:12:55.380 --> 00:13:00.380
who've given me advice is start with something that's already great that you can

217
00:13:01.111 --> 00:13:03.090
make more awesome.
You know?

218
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.300
But don't start with something shitty that you think you can make good.

219
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.710
And that's hard.
Like when you work in a company and a lot of your listeners,

220
00:13:10.711 --> 00:13:12.000
I don't work in big companies,

221
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.390
you have to work on the shit that somebody hands you,
right?

222
00:13:15.391 --> 00:13:18.930
So you're just dealt a really your delta two seven and you're like,
well,
okay,

223
00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:21.060
that's what the boss gave me.
I got to play this handout.

224
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.070
When you get into investing,

225
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.910
your default stance should be no cause most deals suck.

226
00:13:26.911 --> 00:13:29.460
Most deals won't make money.
Most companies will fail.

227
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:33.480
And the temptation always is you see your first deal and you're like,
okay,
I can,

228
00:13:33.481 --> 00:13:36.630
no,
I can be helpful to these guys.
I knew I could make this shitty thing better.

229
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.030
And so your first few deals are always the worst.

230
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.120
<v 1>It's how I lost 50 grand on my first deal.
And I was just like,
oh,</v>

231
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:46.620
it's like for 25% of what I had hypothetically allocated to two years.

232
00:13:46.621 --> 00:13:47.490
I was just like,
oh my God.

233
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.100
<v 2>That's because you get in that room and you're like,
okay,</v>

234
00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.440
I know how I can make this thing better.
Right?

235
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.170
And you forget that you need to start from something that's already

236
00:13:55.171 --> 00:13:59.530
independently pretty damn good and then make it better.
So,
um,

237
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:04.020
our third principle is,
uh,
is give yourself a chance to get rich.

238
00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.940
And that was something that was influenced more by a,

239
00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.140
he's fund investors are like,
Hey,

240
00:14:07.141 --> 00:14:11.400
it's all well and good to throw 25 k around into some of these deals,

241
00:14:11.401 --> 00:14:15.960
but most of them won't be home runs.
Most of them won't turn into UNICORNS.

242
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.710
Uh,
most of them are going to require a ton of work.
Uh,

243
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.070
a bunch of those will fail,
but a bunch of them will be successful.
The tune of,

244
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.000
of doubling that money.
But over years and years of work.

245
00:14:27.001 --> 00:14:28.890
And so I've sold companies,

246
00:14:28.891 --> 00:14:32.550
I sold a company in to Amazon where I saw three x on a $50,000 investment in a

247
00:14:32.551 --> 00:14:36.690
fund.
By the time my phone got paid back and I got my part back and I was,

248
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.390
had been busting my ass and that company for a couple of years,

249
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:43.230
like I barely had money left to buy the guys dinner to celebrate the deal.

250
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.700
And so,
um,

251
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.030
so that's another thing is leaving ourselves enough room to benefit from scale

252
00:14:48.031 --> 00:14:52.340
going in at prices that are low enough that if the company's as successful as we

253
00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:54.500
think it's going to be,
we've given ourselves a chance to get rich.

254
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.610
And then the fourth thing that I think we evolved,
um,

255
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:02.750
internally or that I involved was just be proud of every deal.

256
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:06.980
There's stuff that I've passed on that I just don't regret it at all.

257
00:15:06.981 --> 00:15:08.630
It seemed like maybe a good way to make money,

258
00:15:08.631 --> 00:15:12.380
but I don't wanna have to explain to my kids that's how I made money.
And so,
um,

259
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.560
so those are kind of the guiding principle that I think have been shaped,

260
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:19.400
but categorically what would some of those be?
Uh,
I'll,
you know,

261
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:23.300
mistype domains,
right?
So that's a great way to make money.

262
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:26.810
People are stupid and they mistype type stuff all the time.

263
00:15:26.811 --> 00:15:30.590
And you can put ads on sites that don't really look like ads.
Uh,

264
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.560
subscription businesses that make it impossible for you to get your,

265
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.230
to cancel your subscription.
Ever forced.
Yeah,
you can sign out annuity.
Yeah,

266
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.880
you can sign up online,
but you need to send them a postcard,
you know,
to,

267
00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.930
to cancel like that kind of stuff.
I see that stuff.
Right.
Um,
you know,

268
00:15:44.931 --> 00:15:46.400
people making up statutes,

269
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:51.200
unsubstantiated claims about the effectiveness of their stuff.
Um,
you know,
this,

270
00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:54.520
this,
this anonymous content stuff that we just,

271
00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:58.760
it was just going and bad places.
So I just want to be really proud of our deals.

272
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:03.140
And so those I think are some principles that have been shaped by a lot of these

273
00:16:03.141 --> 00:16:05.840
guys.
Give me advice along the way.
What are,

274
00:16:05.841 --> 00:16:10.130
when you meet with founders for the first time,
what are,

275
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.220
is there anything that disqualifies them quickly?

276
00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:18.140
Are there certain sort of red flags that you look for?
Yeah,

277
00:16:18.141 --> 00:16:20.540
so this,
this is evolved over time.
You know,

278
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:25.690
I've now been doing this for awhile and if done over a hundred deals and have

279
00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:32.111
seen a bunch of those workout and I've seen a bunch of not work out and I read

280
00:16:32.601 --> 00:16:35.600
all the posts that my peers in the industry,
right,
other vcs,

281
00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.760
everyone's constantly stabbing at,
Hey,
what is the rule?
Like how do you,

282
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.030
how do you get into one of these meetings?
Um,
so let me first,

283
00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:44.900
I have a couple of parameters.

284
00:16:44.901 --> 00:16:49.220
One is I almost only invest in things that are already live in production.

285
00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.920
Uh,
just know hypothetical's no ideas.

286
00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.530
I think there might be one exception to that and it was a particularly gifted

287
00:16:54.531 --> 00:16:56.690
entrepreneur that I already worked with before.
But other than that,

288
00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.400
we look for stuff that is,
um,
that is already actually being,
you know,

289
00:17:01.401 --> 00:17:03.620
that has users that has,
uh,

290
00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.460
that that can demonstrate that the team is capable of building and launching

291
00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:12.410
stuff together and getting it out there in the market.
Um,
but that said,

292
00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:17.610
then the one thing that will turn me off right now is if I see that in the pitch

293
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:25.020
the founder is trying to convince themself if,

294
00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.330
if I can pick up on any hint that,

295
00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:32.570
that they don't in their like in their marrow believe in this story,

296
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.330
then it's no dice is,

297
00:17:35.331 --> 00:17:38.150
I look at all the most successful founders I've backed,

298
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:42.290
the thing they have is inevitability of success.

299
00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.950
There are no conditional statements coming out of their mouths.
There's no like,

300
00:17:45.951 --> 00:17:49.710
well,
if it works it would be rad.
Instead,
it's just always,

301
00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:54.300
and you talked to Kevin System and Instagram when he was working on it himself,

302
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.110
he was literally a sole guy working on the product and he's like,

303
00:17:58.111 --> 00:18:01.530
so when we get to 50 million users will roll out this other stuff and you're

304
00:18:01.531 --> 00:18:06.030
just like,
wait,
what?
He's just peering into the future,

305
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:10.560
kind of looking through you into something in the future and you're just like,

306
00:18:10.561 --> 00:18:12.950
I got to get along for the ride with this guy.
Um,

307
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:17.990
the same thing when you talk to Evan Williams when it comes to talking about the

308
00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:22.650
likelihood of success of his products,
he just knows like,

309
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:27.300
he just knew Twitter would be a big thing.
He knows medium will be a big thing.

310
00:18:27.301 --> 00:18:30.450
He doesn't need to convince you of that right now.
He just knows.

311
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:35.400
You talked to Patrick and John Collison at stripe and of course they're building

312
00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:38.700
for this thing to be a big dominant company and it just will be.

313
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.060
You spent time with Travis,
you're,
you're an investor in Uber.

314
00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:46.770
Was there any doubt at any time that Uber would dominate the planet?

315
00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.290
There's just,
there's no doubt.
Can you,
can you just share an,

316
00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.070
there's an anecdote I've,
I've,

317
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.480
I think we probably talked about over drinks at some point,
but the uh,
uh,

318
00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.840
we tennis,
we tennis.
Could you have a skewed view?
Tennis?
Yeah.
Could you play the,

319
00:18:59.841 --> 00:19:03.460
to tell the story?
Two years ago,
we're up at my house and you know,
we,

320
00:19:03.461 --> 00:19:08.360
we live up in the mountains and Truckee and uh,
it was over the holidays,

321
00:19:08.361 --> 00:19:11.820
so my parents were there,
I think it was actually new year's Day.

322
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:16.740
So Travis and I had been,
we have a tradition up there on New Year's Eve.

323
00:19:16.741 --> 00:19:20.040
We go snow shoeing at midnight and drink champagne out in the meadow and stuff.

324
00:19:20.041 --> 00:19:24.030
So I think we are pretty,
um,
it's pretty rough morning.

325
00:19:24.031 --> 00:19:28.020
But Travis sitting on the couch and my dad since have some weakness and he

326
00:19:28.021 --> 00:19:29.940
challenged them to a game of we tennis,

327
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:34.590
so on the Nintendo Wi my dad's not a bad player.
He's pretty good.
So they,
uh,

328
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.510
Travis like,
okay,

329
00:19:36.511 --> 00:19:40.170
Mr. Sack usher and he picks up the controller and they play the first couple of

330
00:19:40.171 --> 00:19:43.830
games and they're tight games with Travis winsome.
And my dad is,

331
00:19:43.831 --> 00:19:46.290
they're taking like full swings with the paddle,
you know,

332
00:19:46.291 --> 00:19:49.920
and it's like breaking a little sweat and Travis is still blurry from the night

333
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.960
before,
barely breaking his wrist and he's beating my dad.
My Dad's like,

334
00:19:51.961 --> 00:19:56.250
what the hell is this?
And then there was that a Negro Montoya moment,

335
00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.580
Princess Bride Stories.
Look,
Travis turns my dad and says,

336
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.930
I'm sorry but I'm not left handed.
Or you know,
I forget if it's left or right,

337
00:20:03.931 --> 00:20:06.900
but he switches hands with the controller and the next three games.

338
00:20:06.901 --> 00:20:08.310
My Dad never touches the ball.

339
00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.830
There were no points score on any of Travis is serves.

340
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:15.330
It has like what the hell is going on?
Like what is this?

341
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:19.800
And after the torture gotten to be too much,
Travis just says,

342
00:20:19.801 --> 00:20:22.480
well let me take you to the global leader board.
I'm sorry I got,
you know,

343
00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.150
I'm a sack.
I,
I didn't mean to be holding out.

344
00:20:24.151 --> 00:20:28.560
And he goes to the global leaderboard and Travis Kalanick was ranked number two

345
00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:32.100
in the world that we tennis in spirits I have now.

346
00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:36.180
Uber was already a thing then like literally he was already building a startup,

347
00:20:36.181 --> 00:20:39.510
but he's just so obsessive,
so competitive.

348
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:43.650
And that's the thing is we look across the portfolio at all of the most kick ass

349
00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.310
companies.
That's something they just have,
you know,
right up front is,

350
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.430
is that they're not hoping and praying for success.

351
00:20:51.431 --> 00:20:52.690
They know what's going to happen.

352
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:57.470
<v 3>Now on that note though,
to pull,
pull out two,
two names,
for instance,</v>

353
00:20:57.471 --> 00:21:01.310
you have an Evan Williams,
blogger,
Twitter medium,

354
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:04.850
etc. Then you have Travis,
uh,
personality wise,

355
00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:08.480
at least from the outside looking in very different personality types.

356
00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.570
And I bumped into some investors to say,
well,

357
00:21:11.571 --> 00:21:16.571
I only invest in merciless a sort of off highly offensive offensive meaning not

358
00:21:17.421 --> 00:21:22.060
defensive,
um,
CEOs than other people were like,
no,
I only invest in people who,

359
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.560
like,
I would watch my kids or whatever it might be.

360
00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:29.660
But what are the commonalities or are there commonalities when you look across

361
00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:35.020
these founders for whom success and massive scale just seems predestined?

362
00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:39.860
What are the commonalities?
Well,
I think something,
so we'll,

363
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:43.430
<v 2>we'll take avid Travis examples,
but,
uh,</v>

364
00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:48.080
but across our most successful founders,
um,
you know,
Susan,
Matt,

365
00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:53.150
Matt Mullenweg,
yeah,
that's a,
that's $1 billion company now billion plus.

366
00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:57.800
Um,
these guys were all incredible,
incredible listeners.

367
00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:00.650
So when they do open their mouths,

368
00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:04.040
they can be bombastic and offensive and aggressive and in your face.

369
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.750
But they're all incredible listeners.

370
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.210
And I don't just mean in casual conversation.

371
00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:13.040
I mean these guys go out of their way to interview other people and they really,

372
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:16.220
uh,
if you catch AV,
he's got a notebook always.

373
00:22:16.221 --> 00:22:19.070
And if you ask them to see if your,
you know,
the last few pages of the notebook,

374
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:23.890
he's just meeting with other people whose,
uh,
you know,

375
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:25.280
billionaires and,
and,

376
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:28.940
and kind of leaders whose jobs might not overlap with his at all,

377
00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:31.790
but from whom he's learning voracious reader.

378
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:37.010
Part of why medium started was he was really back deep in a long form content

379
00:22:37.011 --> 00:22:41.120
when he took a break from Twitter.
And so that guy is just constantly learning,

380
00:22:41.121 --> 00:22:45.080
studying,
studying.
And so when he speaks,
it matters.

381
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.620
But he's listening more than he speaks.
You know that about Moen Wag,

382
00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:49.910
one of the most thoughtful people.

383
00:22:49.911 --> 00:22:53.030
I've never seen anyone read as many books as that guy does and retain all the

384
00:22:53.031 --> 00:22:53.840
knowledge.

385
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:58.160
<v 3>And you also,
it's a bee and he listens to anyone that he's sitting down with.</v>

386
00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:02.930
It doesn't matter if it's,
you know,
the,
the waitress or a primary school teacher.

387
00:23:02.931 --> 00:23:04.100
We've done a lot of traveling together.

388
00:23:04.101 --> 00:23:08.270
He was on the podcast also a very good listener.
All right.

389
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:12.250
<v 2>Yeah.
And so,
and again,
you just look across the board.
These guys are learning,</v>

390
00:23:12.251 --> 00:23:16.870
they're modeling,
they're constantly researching,
they're gathering data.
You know,

391
00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:21.520
Travis would think at a competitive disadvantage for you to know exactly what's

392
00:23:21.521 --> 00:23:25.060
going on in his head sometimes.
So he'll listen.
And,
uh,

393
00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:28.810
and it's an amazing talent.
I think dry is a commonality across those people

394
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:30.430
<v 3>with the,
uh,</v>

395
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.840
the investing game that you've obviously been a participant in it for quite

396
00:23:34.841 --> 00:23:39.700
awhile now.
Um,
you have to say no a lot.

397
00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.880
And,
uh,
I was,
you know,
took a close look at,

398
00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:46.250
at poker in the last with the TV show.

399
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:50.390
<v 2>And there were a couple of quotes that that came up quite a bit along the lines</v>

400
00:23:50.391 --> 00:23:54.320
of,
you know,
I made my money sitting,
not playing hands and,
but,

401
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:58.520
but that having been said,
what are some of the deals,
the whales that got away?

402
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.820
Yeah.
So first of all,
I mean,
this is a rigged game,
right?
And,

403
00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:07.670
and I'm just looking to make it even more rigged.
So for those who don't know,

404
00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:12.260
venture capital,
I mean it's totally unfair.
People gave me their money,

405
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:14.690
I draw a management fee off it,

406
00:24:14.691 --> 00:24:19.691
so they'd pay me to take their money and invest it for them if I make money,

407
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.550
then I paid him back the management fee.

408
00:24:22.551 --> 00:24:25.310
And then after that we split the profits and I got a really big chunk of the

409
00:24:25.311 --> 00:24:29.720
profits.
Uh,
and if I lose money,
that's fine.
Uh,

410
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.730
I don't know.
It doesn't come out of my pocket.

411
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:35.570
I keep my fee and my investors lose money.
That's how this industry works.

412
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:40.430
That's bananas.
Right?
And at some point it's going to break because it,
it's,

413
00:24:40.431 --> 00:24:42.980
um,
you've also incepted me with the term bananas,

414
00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:44.750
which I've started using compulsively.

415
00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:49.640
It Mazzeo also has done the same thing who works with Chris.
Yeah.
It's,

416
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.040
it's just an unforgivably unfair,

417
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.860
a rigged game that's in favor of the venture capitalists.
And so,
um,

418
00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:59.563
so the,

419
00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:04.780
the reality is the risk of an investor doesn't begin to compare to the risk of a

420
00:25:05.001 --> 00:25:07.230
founder.
And so,
you know,

421
00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:10.610
that's one thing that kind of drives me crazy sometimes about some investors.

422
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:13.850
And I love the entrepreneurial spirit that goes into building a firm.
I mean,

423
00:25:13.851 --> 00:25:17.810
I built my firm from scratch and there's certainly founder type lessons in
there,

424
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.280
but,
um,
but you're cash flow positive from day one when you start a venture fund,

425
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:27.590
uh,
and your,
your downside is incredibly limited by the structure of the fun.

426
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:29.240
So,
so that said,

427
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:34.220
what it allows me to do is place some bets on some stuff that I,

428
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:38.060
I'd like to think success is inevitable,
those things.
But I can take,

429
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.550
I can look at the risk analysis and say,
okay,

430
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.320
is a binary outcome a one or a zero?

431
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.370
And some of those things just don't get there.
You know,
one of my,
uh,

432
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:52.130
one of my kind of constant recurring nightmares about this stuff I passed on.

433
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:55.190
That's exactly,
that's what I was,
that's what I was trying to ask.
You know,

434
00:25:55.191 --> 00:25:57.680
I've done some deals where I thought it was gonna be a lot bigger and you know,

435
00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.800
and ends up going away.
But,
so the Dropbox guys,

436
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.700
I met those guys very early on while they're still in y Combinator.

437
00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.420
I got an early look,
you know,

438
00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:10.400
had an opportunity to do the deal and I pulled this guys a set and I was like,

439
00:26:10.401 --> 00:26:12.440
hey,
look at Google.

440
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:16.490
We were using a version of this called a platypus,

441
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:19.310
which became g drive and they're going to crush you guys,
man.

442
00:26:19.311 --> 00:26:21.800
So you should probably find some other product to pivot to.

443
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.230
I probably caused me a hundreds of millions of dollars.
Um,
the,
uh,

444
00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:30.370
they give you a pat on the head and won't go away.
No,
I mean it's,

445
00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:35.060
when I see drew the CEO of Dropbox,
I bring it up before he can.

446
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:40.100
This is good.
I just get,
I get it out there right away.
Um,

447
00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.410
the airbnb guys at,
why comment or same thing,
correct.

448
00:26:43.411 --> 00:26:46.830
Business and I did an amazing business and wanting to be proud of too.
I mean,

449
00:26:46.831 --> 00:26:50.100
that's,
I'm,
I'm really jealous.
I'm not in that business,
not just for the money,

450
00:26:50.101 --> 00:26:55.080
but I love what they do.
I'm really,
um,
admire them a lot in their culture,

451
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:57.600
but at the time they were,

452
00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:00.570
they were allowing you to rent out a room in somebody's house while the owner

453
00:27:00.571 --> 00:27:03.480
was still there.
And that just seemed really scary to me.

454
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:06.780
And I pull the guys aside and I was just like,
guys,
you know,

455
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:09.690
somebody who's going to get raped or murdered in one of these houses and the

456
00:27:09.691 --> 00:27:12.690
blood is going to be on your hands.
I literally said that out loud to them.

457
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.520
What's that worth?
Like 15 or 20 billion now?
Now in fairness,
you,

458
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:20.130
you're probably not wrong,
right?
I mean,
at a certain scale,
that scale,

459
00:27:20.131 --> 00:27:22.260
it has to happen.
It's going to have,
yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

460
00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:24.270
I like to say sometimes like when you think about scale,

461
00:27:24.271 --> 00:27:28.590
like someone who works at Walmart murdered someone last night,
right?

462
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:32.490
There's just no doubt about it at that scale.
Well,
the few million employees,

463
00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.320
one of the murdered somebody last night,
you've to look at it like,
uh,

464
00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:40.170
Edward Norton in fight club,
like an actuarial analysis for insurance,

465
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:46.230
which is terrifying,
but that's the reality of big numbers.
Um,
but I'll tell you,

466
00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:50.910
so there's one other famous one.
There's a bunch of these,
but um,

467
00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:55.230
actually I'll give you too nick because I wasn't reminded us until recently.

468
00:27:55.231 --> 00:27:59.640
Nick Woodman from Gopro came to Google.
Now I wasn't an investor at the time,

469
00:27:59.641 --> 00:28:03.540
but I did a lot of Google's investments and partnerships.
And so Eric Schmidt,

470
00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:06.720
CEO of Google said,
Hey,
will you come in here and sit with this pitch?
You know,

471
00:28:06.721 --> 00:28:09.000
he's a friend of a friend said,
we've got to meet this guy.

472
00:28:09.001 --> 00:28:13.860
So woman comes in with Gopro and Eric's like,
I dunno.
And I was like,

473
00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.170
we'd be,
we'd be foolish to do this deal.

474
00:28:16.171 --> 00:28:19.470
How is this guy from Santa Cruz going to compete with all these Asians and

475
00:28:19.471 --> 00:28:21.480
building hardware?
You know,
you can't,

476
00:28:21.481 --> 00:28:24.330
you can't hold a candle like the Taiwanese and the Koreans.
It was like,

477
00:28:24.331 --> 00:28:26.340
no dice man,
let this guy go.

478
00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.430
And I think I introduced him to somebody over Youtube,
just as a constellation.

479
00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:35.160
I saw that dude this winter skiing,
he's worth like three or $4 billion now.

480
00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:39.120
And he didn't forget that meeting.
So,

481
00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.990
and then the snapchat guys,
I gave a talk in La and they came up to me,

482
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.350
I never met them before.
They came up after the talk and said,
we're big fans,

483
00:28:46.351 --> 00:28:49.590
we'd really like to work with you.
And I was like,
Eh,
sure.
I mean,

484
00:28:49.591 --> 00:28:51.450
I know you guys are up to some cool.
I admire it.

485
00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.560
And I took like eight weeks to set up the meeting and by then the benchmark guys

486
00:28:55.561 --> 00:28:59.460
had done that deal.
That's again,
oh my God,

487
00:28:59.461 --> 00:29:02.970
I can't imagine how much money we,
we've left on the table as a result of that.

488
00:29:02.971 --> 00:29:06.910
So,
um,
you know,
um,
I like to say when I'm wrong,
I'm wrong.

489
00:29:06.911 --> 00:29:09.790
And when I'm writing I'm really,
really right.
And

490
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:13.030
<v 3>the question on being wrong though,
I'm very curious about this.
And uh,</v>

491
00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:17.660
just coming back to kind of the poker analysis or analogy rather,

492
00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.153
the,

493
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.710
and actually heard about this at in depth in,

494
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:28.810
at first when I became friends with some hedge fund managers and they really try

495
00:29:29.011 --> 00:29:34.011
to focus on good process and not conflating say bad outcomes with bad process.

496
00:29:36.171 --> 00:29:39.260
In other words,
you did I make the right decision at the time,

497
00:29:39.261 --> 00:29:42.070
even if I missed out a huge opportunity

498
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:46.240
<v 2>because you can also say pick a company for the wrong reasons and have a</v>

499
00:29:46.241 --> 00:29:49.810
fantastic outcome.
But over time if you develop bad habits,

500
00:29:49.811 --> 00:29:51.300
it can really screw you.
Right?
So do you,

501
00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:55.660
do you think that you made the wrong decision with those companies,
uh,

502
00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:58.420
in terms of the analysis of the process that you followed?

503
00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:02.560
Or did you make the right decision based on your rules you've set up for

504
00:30:02.561 --> 00:30:03.510
yourself and you just missed,

505
00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:06.010
missed out on a few opportunities but also hit some home runs?

506
00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:11.060
The one thing that all those failures to invest,
um,

507
00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.340
that they all have in common is that I let the negative case dominate my

508
00:30:15.341 --> 00:30:20.230
analysis of whether I should invest or not.
So
in the beginning and the,

509
00:30:20.231 --> 00:30:24.350
in as a seed stage investor,
you don't really get a lot of data,
right?
Right.

510
00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.110
We don't have any financials.
They'll look at,

511
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:30.640
the team usually consists of three to five people.
There's some users,

512
00:30:30.641 --> 00:30:32.940
but not enough at scale.
They're usually just the early adopters.

513
00:30:32.941 --> 00:30:34.570
So you don't know whether it's going to be a big thing yet.

514
00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.990
So you don't have a massive diligence process.

515
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:41.290
And so a lot of what you're going on as your gut about this product and about

516
00:30:41.291 --> 00:30:42.124
this team,

517
00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:47.940
and I think the easiest way to screw this up is to let the negative case

518
00:30:48.101 --> 00:30:51.430
dominate your perspective.
So Dropbox,

519
00:30:51.431 --> 00:30:54.160
I'm thinking about the competitive landscape and I'm thinking,
okay,

520
00:30:54.161 --> 00:30:55.990
Google is going to crush them.
Well,
first of all,

521
00:30:55.991 --> 00:30:59.560
we've seen that didn't actually happen and rarely does the incumbent crush

522
00:30:59.561 --> 00:31:01.810
anybody.
It's just not that common.

523
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:07.120
A startup is going to move much faster than a division of a company where it's

524
00:31:07.121 --> 00:31:11.500
not their bread and butter.
I mean g drive spent three years in Beta,
you know,

525
00:31:11.501 --> 00:31:13.990
internal Beta,
et cetera.
It was never really a priority for them.

526
00:31:13.991 --> 00:31:18.280
So course Dropbox is going to win that.
You know,
I look at Airbnb,
yes,

527
00:31:18.281 --> 00:31:20.260
there's going to be bad things that happen,
like people get,

528
00:31:20.261 --> 00:31:22.360
their apartment's trashed,
you know,
from time to time.

529
00:31:22.361 --> 00:31:27.361
But somehow I let that distract me from the potential for this worldwide

530
00:31:28.361 --> 00:31:33.340
marketplace for space that was just going to displace hotels with snapchat.

531
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:38.520
I'm thinking about Dick Pics and you know how it's being used by that was on the

532
00:31:38.591 --> 00:31:42.640
pro side.
Yeah,
exactly.
Like,
Hey,
uh,
but no,

533
00:31:42.641 --> 00:31:46.120
I'm thinking about like it's lame content.
Uh,

534
00:31:46.121 --> 00:31:50.260
it's being used poorly by like junior high girls and stuff like that who were

535
00:31:50.261 --> 00:31:52.330
exposing themselves and they're just,
they're bad

536
00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.490
or bad examples of how snapchat wasn't necessarily a helpful thing.
And again,

537
00:31:57.491 --> 00:31:59.890
I like to be proud of my deals.
On the other hand,

538
00:31:59.891 --> 00:32:03.520
you see today it is just to network with a hundreds of millions of users who are

539
00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:06.760
building incredibly valuable content,
you know,

540
00:32:06.761 --> 00:32:09.040
with the launch of stories and discover and stuff like that.

541
00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.050
But I got distracted.
I let the,

542
00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:16.990
I let the downside and negative case a way,
the risk and yet,

543
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:20.260
you know,
you like you look at Uber,
Uber could,

544
00:32:20.261 --> 00:32:23.620
if it was easy enough to say no to Uber because like,
ah,

545
00:32:23.621 --> 00:32:27.220
the taxis are the regulation in the lobby or these drivers are going to hurt

546
00:32:27.221 --> 00:32:28.180
people at some point.

547
00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.350
And somehow I was able to look past all that and when nobody else in the valley

548
00:32:32.351 --> 00:32:36.460
wanted to and get that deal done.
Um,
what's,
what's,
what I think is,

549
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.100
is really interesting about Uber in particular is,
uh,
and

550
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.800
<v 3>for those people who don't know him,
that of,
uh,
early advisor Uber.</v>

551
00:32:42.801 --> 00:32:46.040
So I'm biased obviously and a lot of ways when it talk about it,

552
00:32:46.041 --> 00:32:48.380
but I think you actually got there before me.
Yeah.

553
00:32:48.381 --> 00:32:51.950
It was pre pre seed money advisor because I'd been to advisor,
stumble upon it,

554
00:32:51.951 --> 00:32:54.830
had worked with Garrett and uh,
I'm now working,
uh,

555
00:32:54.831 --> 00:32:59.330
again collaborating with him on expo,
which is Super Fun.
But in the beginning,

556
00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:03.890
the way that Uber got dismissed,
and I think this is a really common,
uh,

557
00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:09.080
common mistake it seems that a lot of investors make is people said,
oh my God,

558
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:12.830
really like black cars for one percenters in San Francisco.

559
00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:15.020
What's the market for that?
And they,

560
00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:20.050
they viewed a very niche activity is by definition constrained to say 1% or is

561
00:33:21.861 --> 00:33:25.670
in San Francisco,
in New York.
Um,
and the,
if you look at,

562
00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:26.990
let's say even recycling,

563
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:32.210
it started out that way and they kind of confuse the first target with the total

564
00:33:32.211 --> 00:33:35.270
market.
And they also looked at just the available market,

565
00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:39.080
which they misdefined um,
very early on and didn't,
uh,
you know,

566
00:33:39.081 --> 00:33:40.580
in the case of like an airbnb or an Uber,

567
00:33:40.581 --> 00:33:45.170
they can grow the market of beyond any comparable that's available.
Um,

568
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:46.780
so in any case,
but the uh,

569
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:51.350
I mean a lot of these start off so incredibly niche that people misread the

570
00:33:51.351 --> 00:33:55.610
market potential I think.
But let me ask you a question about the getting,

571
00:33:56.180 --> 00:34:00.550
focusing on the,
the positive scenarios and the,

572
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:05.590
the potential high multiple outcomes because for those people who aren't

573
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:07.500
familiar with venture capital,
it's a,

574
00:34:07.501 --> 00:34:10.880
it's a term that comes up a lot in magazines and media coverage is very hot

575
00:34:10.881 --> 00:34:15.080
right now.
Um,
so the,
you explained it in brief,
but the,

576
00:34:15.081 --> 00:34:19.790
it's a fair to say that two and 20 is a pretty fair way to think about it in

577
00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:22.130
terms of the,
I mean not everybody,

578
00:34:22.131 --> 00:34:24.950
but that's like how people talk about venture capital and hedge funds and so on.

579
00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:27.860
You have this management fee and then you have the carry,

580
00:34:27.861 --> 00:34:31.220
which is kind of your split.
But what,
what I wonder is,

581
00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:36.440
do you think vcs should not think about the downside as much as the upside

582
00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:41.441
because they're only the rewarded on the upside and not on the downside.

583
00:34:41.841 --> 00:34:46.841
Whereas say hedge fund investors can have long short bets and think more about

584
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:50.960
when I hang out with like hedge fund guys versus say a venture capitalist or
Vcs,

585
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.790
the hedge fund guys are many of them,

586
00:34:52.791 --> 00:34:55.770
much more kind of apocalyptic and their thinking.
Um,

587
00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.410
and it would seem like that is tied to their ability to make money from a lot of

588
00:35:00.411 --> 00:35:03.590
those catastrophes.
I mean those,
those guys can be short.
And in fact,

589
00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:05.390
even if the apocalypse isn't really approaching,

590
00:35:05.391 --> 00:35:08.780
they'll still get people to write articles about the impending apocalypse for

591
00:35:08.781 --> 00:35:13.360
those companies to make sure that it's a self fulfilling prophecy.
Yeah.
What,
so,

592
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.000
so what are,

593
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.740
what are the biggest differences in your mind between the top say venture

594
00:35:18.741 --> 00:35:23.090
capitalists and Hedge Fund guys and private equity guys or,

595
00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:26.330
Oh yeah.
How that,
how do they differ if they do or what do they have in common?

596
00:35:26.331 --> 00:35:27.860
Is we were talking about at lunch,
first of all,

597
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:31.070
everyone I know on Wall Street is just jacked on stimulants all day long.

598
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:35.750
So they're taking provigil,
they're doing rails.
They,
uh,

599
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.100
those guys just in such an incredibly

600
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.700
<v 2>competitive environment that they're using every chemical edge they can find.</v>

601
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.030
That's definitely not happening in the VC set.
Uh,

602
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:50.010
the VC life demands kind of a much more steady reflective state.

603
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:54.680
There's certainly obviously moments of negotiation and in standoffs,

604
00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:58.890
but it's,
it's much more of a thought in emotional intelligence exercise.

605
00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:04.260
Um,
you know,
that said,
because the valley silicon valley,

606
00:36:04.261 --> 00:36:08.100
so kind of built on positive energy and love U.
Dot.

607
00:36:08.101 --> 00:36:12.050
V what ends up happening is as the stakes have gotten higher,

608
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:16.650
the funds have gotten bigger.
The industries more flush with capital.

609
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:18.990
It's more competitive than ever.

610
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:22.620
And a friend of mine who I've done some work with WHO's on the east coast and

611
00:36:22.621 --> 00:36:23.610
the private equity world,

612
00:36:23.611 --> 00:36:28.611
since the main difference between New York and San Francisco is out here in New

613
00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:33.630
York,
we stab each other in the eye,
face to face.
And uh,

614
00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:37.620
and out there you guys just cut the other guy's Achilles and let them bleed out.

615
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:40.800
Well,
while looking at him,
you know,
it's just,
uh,

616
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.720
it's incredible how I think in,
in the San Francisco world,
we,

617
00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.440
we really try and maintain these longterm friendships.

618
00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:53.850
We try and build these reputations that will scale over time.

619
00:36:53.851 --> 00:36:54.840
Cause it's a venture capitalist.

620
00:36:54.841 --> 00:36:59.070
You're raising money on a every three years basically and it's a 10 year fund

621
00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:03.450
and you know,
you're,
you're,
you're hoping to have a long tenure in the,

622
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:08.040
in the industry with great relationships that you can draw on to recruit people

623
00:37:08.041 --> 00:37:08.791
in your portfolio,

624
00:37:08.791 --> 00:37:11.790
companies that you can use to help your portfolio companies raise more money,

625
00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:13.470
go public or get sold.

626
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:18.980
And because of the fact that we're big equity holders who only get paid back

627
00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:23.310
upon an ultimate exit maybe eight,
10 years from now,

628
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:27.600
we tend to act more with that in mind.
That longterm perspective,

629
00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:32.310
guys I work with on the east coast have much shorter timeframes,
right?

630
00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:36.720
They're much more used to quarter by quarter analysis of a public company.

631
00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:41.980
Um,
Hey,
do you have any news today?
You know,
they,
and it's,

632
00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:42.511
it's very,

633
00:37:42.511 --> 00:37:46.050
very near term and they don't have the stomach for the ups and downs of building

634
00:37:46.051 --> 00:37:50.150
this stuff over time.
And so it's a,
it's great.
They're,
you know,

635
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.020
they're living on by a different report card than we are.
Yeah.

636
00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:56.580
So that's the biggest thing.
You know,
we,
there are other businesses like this,

637
00:37:56.581 --> 00:38:01.470
like the media business as a cash quarterly business.
You go to a media company,

638
00:38:01.471 --> 00:38:04.290
you go to a record label or movies studio you and say,
let's do an equity deal.

639
00:38:04.291 --> 00:38:06.830
And they laugh in your face and like how much revenue are you going to guarantee

640
00:38:06.831 --> 00:38:09.240
in year one because that's how they get paid.
Right.

641
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:13.950
All those executives are on annual contracts and they've got payments.

642
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:17.340
They still own their houses in the Hamptons and they're just like,

643
00:38:17.341 --> 00:38:21.960
I'm not going to walk away from that guaranteed cash right now.
Sorry,

644
00:38:21.961 --> 00:38:25.560
I'm breaking because you're laughing right there.
I know it's taken your,
no,
no,

645
00:38:25.561 --> 00:38:27.480
no.
This is good.
I W no,

646
00:38:27.481 --> 00:38:31.470
I wonder if that could also be related to the fact that St Silicon Valley,

647
00:38:31.471 --> 00:38:36.471
it's such a small world and you work very hard to get to a point where you a

648
00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:41.820
deal flow meaning opportunities that come to you that are of a sort of pre

649
00:38:41.821 --> 00:38:44.420
filtered,
high quality,
right?
Uh,

650
00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:46.870
whereas in a lot of these other spaces,

651
00:38:46.871 --> 00:38:51.871
they're going out and using analysts to sort of hunt for opportunities that

652
00:38:52.241 --> 00:38:56.050
other people have not exploited.
Um,
so I mean,

653
00:38:56.051 --> 00:38:58.760
it's humans responding to incentives,
right?
In a way.
Well,

654
00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:00.940
in a hedge fund environment,
you're working with public stocks,

655
00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:04.840
usually at arm's length.
You might try and go activist and get on the board.

656
00:39:04.841 --> 00:39:09.830
You might try to,
like I alluded to change the press cycle.
Um,

657
00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:10.803
but you know,

658
00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:14.620
for the most part you're doing analysis at arm's length of these companies and

659
00:39:14.621 --> 00:39:19.190
the private equity world,
there's a business already there,
right?

660
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:22.780
There's a,
there are products or multiple products.
There's financials,

661
00:39:22.781 --> 00:39:25.660
their supply chain.
And so you're going in and saying,

662
00:39:25.661 --> 00:39:27.820
I can do a better job of this than you can.

663
00:39:27.821 --> 00:39:31.360
And so there's an arm's length and there's some tension obviously with

664
00:39:31.361 --> 00:39:31.811
management.

665
00:39:31.811 --> 00:39:36.100
Usually sometimes you're coopting members that management team to go get it
done.

666
00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.800
But the venture world is different in that

667
00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.980
it's much earlier and it's much more where the venture capitalist is a

668
00:39:44.981 --> 00:39:49.981
collaborator in determining the product and the strategy and the vector of the

669
00:39:50.501 --> 00:39:51.670
business is going to take.

670
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000
And so there has to be a much more collaborative approach over the longterm to

671
00:39:59.261 --> 00:40:03.130
go ahead and actually build this company.
So there's nothing,
you know,

672
00:40:03.131 --> 00:40:06.130
and I think there are certainly venture capitalists who maybe come out of the

673
00:40:06.131 --> 00:40:08.740
world of finance or have a different perspective that they,

674
00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:11.800
their job is just to sit on the outside and tell somebody how to run a business.

675
00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.870
That's,
that's the private equity model.

676
00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.360
But it's a real early stage venture capitalists.

677
00:40:16.361 --> 00:40:21.361
You're job is to sit in the room and actually work at the Beck and call of the

678
00:40:22.751 --> 00:40:25.180
CEO to get stuff done to help build this company,

679
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.480
lend advice about product strategy,
about go to market,

680
00:40:28.481 --> 00:40:30.790
about the design of the front page,

681
00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:33.340
how to staff up and bring in the next couple of members of the team,

682
00:40:33.341 --> 00:40:37.090
how to go about raising money,
how to deal with your first PR cycles.

683
00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:42.150
And so that I think brings a much different person and the successful niche,

684
00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:45.540
not necessarily the biggest,
um,
you know,
self promoter,

685
00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:47.860
not necessarily the most widely known person,
et cetera.

686
00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:51.220
But somebody who actually can hustle to go ahead.

687
00:40:51.221 --> 00:40:53.370
And as we go back to what we talked to earlier,

688
00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:56.590
to tip the balance from something that's good to do,
being totally awesome,

689
00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:58.240
being great.
What,

690
00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:02.320
what books or resources outside of personal relationships and these mentors that

691
00:41:02.321 --> 00:41:05.080
you've had,
the complements and so on,
are there any particular

692
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.140
books or resources that have helped you become a better investor?
Yeah,

693
00:41:11.141 --> 00:41:15.820
I think most of those though are not business books per se.
Perfect.
That's great.

694
00:41:15.821 --> 00:41:19.540
Guys.
Um,
so I didn't get a business to guiding and then do an Mba.

695
00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.530
I took a couple of classes and it was enough to show me it was a total farce.
Um,

696
00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.170
I did get a law degree,
which isn't even bigger farce,

697
00:41:26.171 --> 00:41:28.600
but that's for another episode.
So,

698
00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:33.060
so I never had formal business training and so I don't really,
and,

699
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.010
and I tried to look at

700
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:36.500
<v 4>a few of those like instant MBA books and stuff like that.</v>

701
00:41:36.501 --> 00:41:38.880
I even bought some books on venture capital and they're just such a,

702
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.570
so goofy and law.
And by the way,

703
00:41:41.571 --> 00:41:46.571
part of that is because now we have so many great venture capitalists bloggers

704
00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:50.390
who are just an open book about the industry who teach it.

705
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.030
So Brad Feld comes to mind first,

706
00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:56.530
a longtime friend and mentor,
uh,

707
00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:58.940
Brad at Feld thoughts,
you know,

708
00:41:58.941 --> 00:42:03.860
has done series over the years where he breaks down each aspect of a term sheet,

709
00:42:03.861 --> 00:42:05.420
how to understand it and the deal documents.

710
00:42:05.421 --> 00:42:08.300
And this is what we think is important in these are things we think could go

711
00:42:08.301 --> 00:42:11.870
away.
Uh,
Josh Copperman,
his team have done a lot of work on that.

712
00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:15.740
We've now seen y Combinator and the guys at Fenwick and West and Cooley building

713
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:18.170
templated documents that are really,

714
00:42:18.171 --> 00:42:21.110
really watered down and pro entrepreneur and just kind of have,

715
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:24.680
have taken out a lot of the legacy bullshit that didn't need to be in those

716
00:42:24.681 --> 00:42:25.514
documents.

717
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:30.320
And so there's a lot of this learning that can happen now without having to buy

718
00:42:30.321 --> 00:42:34.130
books.
And while that happened to go to school and so that's been fantastic.

719
00:42:34.131 --> 00:42:39.131
But where I worry about the valley and about investors as well as our

720
00:42:40.401 --> 00:42:43.910
entrepreneurs is in the development of everything off the ball a little bit.

721
00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:48.560
So you know,
you and I,
I just turned 40 this week.
That's why you're here.

722
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:51.860
Happy Birthday again.
But,
but as a 40 year old,

723
00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:56.870
the people my age who were computer science majors in college,
they,

724
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:58.520
that was a major,
just like any other major,

725
00:42:58.521 --> 00:43:02.120
they still had to go get a summer job.
They mowed lawns,
waited tables,
uh,

726
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:06.440
they had time in their curriculum to go study abroad to volunteer.

727
00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.270
They had these really well rounded lives.

728
00:43:08.271 --> 00:43:12.680
And so working with people my age and older at Google who are computer

729
00:43:12.681 --> 00:43:17.150
scientists was great because they had,
uh,
not just these amazing,

730
00:43:17.151 --> 00:43:18.860
amazing math and science skills,

731
00:43:18.861 --> 00:43:23.861
but a diversity of experience that informed great product decisions as well as

732
00:43:24.071 --> 00:43:25.160
just collegiality.

733
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:29.660
What ended up happening is computer science degrees got so popular and so

734
00:43:29.661 --> 00:43:34.640
valuable that those kids didn't have to pay for school much anymore.

735
00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:38.450
You know,
and they're only work experience was like ta in a class,

736
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:41.420
not actually getting their ass kicked digging ditches or anything.

737
00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:43.460
And the curriculum was,

738
00:43:43.461 --> 00:43:47.390
Reagan are rigorous enough that these guys didn't get to go study abroad and

739
00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:50.270
there was no opportunity to go do volunteer work and live in the developing

740
00:43:50.271 --> 00:43:52.040
world at all.
And so as a result,

741
00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:56.720
I actually found we were starting to have a generation of not just entitled and

742
00:43:56.721 --> 00:43:56.871
you know,

743
00:43:56.871 --> 00:43:59.340
people talk about the entitlement of the millennials and when it comes to work

744
00:43:59.341 --> 00:44:01.970
ethic and stuff,
but they weren't just entitled,

745
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:07.700
but they just had such narrow band perspectives on the world.

746
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:09.650
They were missing empathy.

747
00:44:09.651 --> 00:44:12.890
So they weren't able to put themselves in the shoes of the folks.

748
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:16.700
They might be building a product for what the problems of a world might be.

749
00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:22.210
And so I am constantly looking for opportunities for myself and for the founders

750
00:44:23.461 --> 00:44:25.400
that we work with to,

751
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:31.260
to broaden the scope that they have on the world such that they can build

752
00:44:31.261 --> 00:44:35.540
something on a more informed basis and emotionally informed basis.
So,
I mean,
I,

753
00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:37.710
I really think empathy is,
and it's,

754
00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:42.420
it's a word that's been kind of reduced to signal like,
oh,
somebody,

755
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:47.340
uh,
you know,
somebody hurt their foot and I feel bad for them.
Uh,
instead,

756
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:52.730
I think much more poignantly empathy is about can I see the world through that

757
00:44:53.071 --> 00:44:56.940
person's Lens?
Can I figure out what matters to them?
What are they afraid of?

758
00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.300
What's bothering them?
What do they think is limiting them right now?

759
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:02.880
What's their hope?
And if I can do that,

760
00:45:02.881 --> 00:45:06.780
then it's a lot easier for me to build something for them and to sell it to them

761
00:45:06.781 --> 00:45:09.720
and to help them and to build a longer term partnership with that person.

762
00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.040
If you were giving a

763
00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:17.690
assignment to folks for books or experiences,

764
00:45:17.701 --> 00:45:22.170
just kind of a short list for people who want to develop that type of empathy,

765
00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:23.370
what would you put on the list?

766
00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:27.690
One of my favorite books that we give to most founders is,

767
00:45:27.691 --> 00:45:31.120
I'm not fade away.
Uh,

768
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:34.160
I think it's like I'll eat slop pick on the cover.
Yeah.
I belly flop.

769
00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:37.440
Pick a short life.
Well lived story of Peter Barton,
uh,

770
00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:41.010
that it's the,
first of all,
just on a personal note,

771
00:45:41.011 --> 00:45:42.710
that guy's trajectory kind of followed mine.

772
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:46.740
He was a ski bum who suddenly made a big attack.
He was on the border,
Yahoo.

773
00:45:46.741 --> 00:45:50.880
He worked at liberty media.
Uh,
and then he hits his forties and says,
okay,

774
00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:53.130
I've accomplished what I want to accomplish.
I'm dialing it back.

775
00:45:53.131 --> 00:45:56.430
I just want to spend time with my family.
And at that point,

776
00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.740
and this isn't a spoiler,
it's literally how the book starts.

777
00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:03.810
He finds out it is incurable stomach cancer.
And so the book walks,

778
00:46:03.811 --> 00:46:08.750
uh,
walks you through his biography as well as the remaining time in his life.
Uh,

779
00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:12.510
you will cry reading this book.
It is inevitable.
If you don't,

780
00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:16.680
I'm very worried about you,
but you'll definitely cry.
It will be Cathartic.

781
00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:20.640
But it's the kind of thing where you,
it's,
it's an exercise in,
okay,

782
00:46:20.641 --> 00:46:23.580
what's on the mind of the person who's dying

783
00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:28.710
and how is he thinking about the impact of his death on his family,

784
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:33.120
on his friends,
on his business,
partners,

785
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:37.800
on his legacy,
on the continuing responsibilities as a dad,

786
00:46:37.801 --> 00:46:40.860
even in the absence of,
you know,
even though he's passed on in the next life.

787
00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:42.380
And it,

788
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:47.600
it's an entire exercise and perspectives and I think that book will not only

789
00:46:49.021 --> 00:46:52.200
leave you feeling incredibly lucky for what we've got here and where we are,

790
00:46:52.201 --> 00:46:54.690
but at the same time,
um,
we'll,

791
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:59.550
um,
we'll sharpen that,
that,

792
00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.010
that sense of how do I put myself in somebody else's shoes,

793
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:06.540
a similar book that I love.
It's,
I,
I'm going to get the title wrong.

794
00:47:06.541 --> 00:47:10.530
I think it's how to get filthy rich in rising Asia,
I think is going to be,

795
00:47:10.531 --> 00:47:14.970
you told me about this book isn't me.
So it's written in the second person,

796
00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:18.890
which I don't know of another book like that.
But it's just you,
you,
you like,

797
00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:21.270
you wake up in this room almost like an old,

798
00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.680
like an old role player or something like that online,
like dungeons and dragons.

799
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:29.370
If it is reading to you are in a room,
there's a sarcophagus,

800
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:33.180
open sarcophagus,
no,
it's a,
but it says,
you know,

801
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:38.250
you wake up and you basically start the book in a slum in Pakistan and it's just

802
00:47:39.641 --> 00:47:42.910
writing to you about how you go through your day and the things that matter to

803
00:47:42.911 --> 00:47:43.420
you.

804
00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:47.170
And it turns out you're kind of entrepreneurial and you're willing to take some

805
00:47:47.171 --> 00:47:51.550
risks.
And so you start working into other stations in life.

806
00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:54.870
And I don't want to give anything else about the book away,

807
00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:58.480
but you close that book and you feel like you've,

808
00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:02.290
you've walked through 15 to 20 different lives and another world.

809
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:06.940
And I just think more of that would be better for all of us.

810
00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:08.380
I think it'd be better for our industry,

811
00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:12.040
for the depth and the impact of the products we build.

812
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:16.150
I think just be a lot better for getting along with each other.
So,
I mean,

813
00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:20.260
you and I have traveled to Ethiopia together doing work with charity water.

814
00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:26.070
It's hard to complain about a day's work back here in the United States when you

815
00:48:26.141 --> 00:48:30.760
have being in a village where they walk three to four hours each way to get

816
00:48:30.761 --> 00:48:35.170
water where the kids are dying because they drink the same water that the cow,

817
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:37.000
uh,
poops into,

818
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:40.030
where the women don't get an opportunity to go to school because they're

819
00:48:40.031 --> 00:48:42.970
carrying the water and on the way they might get eaten by a lion or raped.

820
00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:44.150
And it's,

821
00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:49.190
it's really hard to find yourself complaining about are privileged us life.

822
00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:51.880
And,
um,
and that's something you could just tell.

823
00:48:51.881 --> 00:48:53.080
We're in a big company like Google.

824
00:48:53.081 --> 00:48:56.170
They were the people who would bitch and complain.
And I'm like,
really?
It really,

825
00:48:56.171 --> 00:48:59.350
this is a hard day.
Microsoft launch a competitive product and that's our,

826
00:48:59.351 --> 00:49:00.370
that's our horrible day.

827
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:05.020
And I just think we'd all be much better off if we were able to find

828
00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:09.610
opportunities for our CS students to go study abroad for,

829
00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:14.580
for our MBA is to actually spend some time around poor people.
Um,
and,

830
00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:16.810
and to start building these more diverse perspectives.

831
00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:22.420
<v 1>Uh,
would you look back on,
since it's a,</v>

832
00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:26.550
since it's the big Foro,
when you were 30,
uh,

833
00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:31.350
who came to mind most when you thought of the word successful?
And now at 40,

834
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:34.890
who is the person who most comes to mind when you think of the word successful?

835
00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:41.880
<v 4>Right.
So 30.
That's a really,
I got,
let me think of where I was.
So I guess,
oh,</v>

836
00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:46.040
I was at Google at the time.
Um,
who is most successful?

837
00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:48.710
It's just when you were like,
I want to be successful in the person,

838
00:49:48.711 --> 00:49:52.100
in your mind who embodied that most.
Yeah.

839
00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:59.480
I always wanted to be at the center of the deal.
And so at that point in my life,

840
00:49:59.481 --> 00:50:04.270
I still really admired,
for instance,
uh,
like a John Doerr or Mike Moritz,

841
00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:05.750
they were both on the board at Google,

842
00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:11.800
brilliant guys who use their station in life to gather even smarter people to

843
00:50:14.091 --> 00:50:15.380
teach them about things.

844
00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:19.730
And then they would use their unique talents for storytelling and,

845
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:25.160
and making composite kind of ideas come true to build companies.

846
00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:29.470
They became as a result,
um,

847
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:33.950
the head great families,
they were just well respected by folks.
I think I still,

848
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:38.880
um,
that was kind of my definition of success at that point,
uh,

849
00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:44.590
at 40 and what I think my journey from 30 to 40 was about was to stop trying to

850
00:50:46.431 --> 00:50:48.570
define or,
or,

851
00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:51.410
or build some kind of model or have some kind of role model out there and start

852
00:50:51.411 --> 00:50:54.350
to it.
Stop trying to define myself externally because that's a distraction.

853
00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:57.380
So there are times when you're doing a deal with John Doerr,

854
00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.410
you're across the table or someone you're like,
hey wait,
that was fucked up.

855
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:03.580
You know,
like,
I don't wait,
you're supposed to be my hero,

856
00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:06.200
my idol and I don't like that move you just made or something like that.
Right.

857
00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:08.900
And I think,
you know,
anyone I've ever put on a pedestal,

858
00:51:08.901 --> 00:51:12.800
I've just been disappointed by doing so.
Um,
I'm sorry about that by the way.

859
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:18.170
Oh,
you have no var,
no idea how far you fall into him.
But,

860
00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:21.190
but so I think for me the,

861
00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:25.130
the exercise has been how much am I going to define that for myself,

862
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:26.930
not by looking at somebody else.

863
00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.690
I recently got to have dinner with next to Bill Gates,

864
00:51:29.691 --> 00:51:32.990
Bill and Melinda Gates and I had been raised to hate him,
you know,

865
00:51:32.991 --> 00:51:34.790
growing up at Google,
you know,
he's,

866
00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:39.050
he's a pretty evil person and I was sitting next in there and I got a chance to

867
00:51:39.051 --> 00:51:44.000
basically interview him about how they have structured the foundation,

868
00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:49.280
how they think about which causes to take on which challenges to tackle.

869
00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:53.690
And I mean,
I walked out of there just deeply admiring their work,

870
00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:58.760
but I think I want to limit it to that and not get into like,

871
00:51:58.761 --> 00:52:00.410
is he a great family man?
Is He,
you know,

872
00:52:00.411 --> 00:52:03.380
he's still a son of a bitch when it comes to competing with him and software and

873
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:08.030
his default browser knows the antitrust behavior.
But,
uh,
but I really,

874
00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:12.260
I'm trying to look at people and find kind of one aspect of them that I like,

875
00:52:12.261 --> 00:52:15.630
but for the most part I've had to decide,
okay,
what's really important to me?
Um,

876
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:21.350
that's my wife and my kids and,
you know,
I,
I'm,
I'm just not that social anymore.

877
00:52:21.351 --> 00:52:23.930
I just don't hang out with people that much.
I don't go to conferences,

878
00:52:23.931 --> 00:52:25.070
I'm just not available for dinner.

879
00:52:25.071 --> 00:52:27.230
I would infimately rather spend that time with them.

880
00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:31.310
And so that was a priority choice I had to make internally,

881
00:52:31.311 --> 00:52:33.710
not because I saw anybody else killing it that way.
You know,

882
00:52:33.711 --> 00:52:35.630
I think I reflected back on my own parents who,

883
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:41.390
who opted out of much more accelerated career path so they could spend way more

884
00:52:41.391 --> 00:52:45.860
time with me and my brother.
And,
uh,
and so that's a choice I had to me.

885
00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:50.570
But I will say,
do you know about the,
the journal I found in my life?

886
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.970
And you should,
you should mention that I have a quick,

887
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.540
well observation is if I could spend more time with crystal instead of me,

888
00:52:56.541 --> 00:52:58.000
I would do the same thing.
Uh,

889
00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:02.630
we actually met before you and I met at fairtex kickboxing.

890
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:07.070
We back in the day.
Well yeah,
I was,
so I was having some,

891
00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.470
I was having a bunch of people down for cocktails.

892
00:53:09.471 --> 00:53:12.230
We came down from Truckee into the city,
crystal and I did,
I was like,

893
00:53:12.231 --> 00:53:14.420
let's get a bunch of people together for cocktails.

894
00:53:14.421 --> 00:53:17.060
I invite Tim and Tim walks in and he looks at my girlfriend.
He's like,

895
00:53:17.061 --> 00:53:18.860
I think I know him.
I'm like,
yeah,
sure you do man.

896
00:53:18.861 --> 00:53:22.640
Everyone uses that to try and pick up my then girlfriend now wife.
And he's like,

897
00:53:22.641 --> 00:53:25.470
no.
And then she says,
yeah,
I think I know you too.
And I'm,
Oh shit,

898
00:53:25.471 --> 00:53:28.640
here she goes like I'm going to,
where's this going?
He's such a honk.

899
00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:31.830
What do I have to offer to?
But uh,
yeah,
you guys used to,

900
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.500
you guys used to train and kickboxing.

901
00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:37.290
<v 1>Yeah,
she was hardcore.
It was always,
but um,</v>

902
00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:40.110
I want to pause for a second.
The,
the,

903
00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:42.030
I do want to hear about the notebook for sure.

904
00:53:42.031 --> 00:53:46.740
Cause I think it's amazingly Nostradamus like,
but the um,

905
00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:49.290
you and your brother,
so your brother have had very different careers,

906
00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:51.030
have done very well respectively.

907
00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:56.010
What did your parents do that you are also trying to do with your kids?

908
00:53:57.610 --> 00:53:59.460
<v 4>Yes.
So my brother Brian Saca,</v>

909
00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:03.540
he's on the first youtube sketch stars.
Um,

910
00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.940
he parlayed that into,
he sold some of the first web series ever,

911
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:11.530
made a shit ton of money building web series and finding commercial partners for

912
00:54:11.531 --> 00:54:15.310
them and stuff.
Uh,
if this beautiful movies like yeah,
Wolf of Wall Street,

913
00:54:15.370 --> 00:54:17.490
Wall Street with Scorsese recently.
Um,

914
00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:21.550
and then just yesterday are allowed to talk about this now.
He,
his,

915
00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:23.380
his series on TBS got picked up.

916
00:54:23.381 --> 00:54:28.050
So he's going to be a Costar of a comedy series on TBS.
Pretty funny thing.
Um,

917
00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:31.840
so what did our parents do?
Well,
first of all,
they were just always involved.

918
00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:36.850
So my parents took vacations with us.
We always went to national parks together.

919
00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:39.550
Uh,
we never went to resort type places.

920
00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:44.320
We were just always together and you know,
not only are they read with us,

921
00:54:44.321 --> 00:54:45.101
like most parents,

922
00:54:45.101 --> 00:54:50.050
but my mom would pull us out of school to take us to go see an author,
read,

923
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:53.350
you know,
at a,
at a bookstore,
an hour and a half away.

924
00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:57.580
She would literally just pull us out of school to go to a science museum.

925
00:54:57.581 --> 00:54:58.870
And so she was a college professor.

926
00:54:58.871 --> 00:55:01.660
And so she had a little flexibility in her schedule to yank us out.

927
00:55:01.661 --> 00:55:05.350
She would take us to a park called art park.
Uh,
I've been loosed in New York,

928
00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:06.880
Art Park,
art park.

929
00:55:06.881 --> 00:55:10.420
It's a state park in New York state and loosen New York where the whole thing is

930
00:55:10.421 --> 00:55:14.260
dedicated to different,
uh,
art media.
And so you can paint there,

931
00:55:14.261 --> 00:55:15.041
you can blow glass,

932
00:55:15.041 --> 00:55:20.041
you can watch a performing arts truth kind of Vaudevillian theater and stuff.

933
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:24.280
And,
and my parents eyes,
that was just as,

934
00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:26.890
or even maybe more important than going to the public school.

935
00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:29.740
And so I think that kind of enrichment and,

936
00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:35.100
and just being shown that people in all these walks of life were important and

937
00:55:35.381 --> 00:55:38.680
fascinating.
You know,
I grew up where by the time I got to college,

938
00:55:38.681 --> 00:55:43.330
I had never heard of an investment banker.
I didn't know that was a job.
Um,

939
00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:48.220
you know,
I'd,
I'd been exposed to,
to writers,
to artists,
to chefs,

940
00:55:48.221 --> 00:55:52.690
to musicians,
to engineers,
to lots of teachers,
to lawyers,

941
00:55:52.691 --> 00:55:56.340
to doctors.
Um,
but it was never,
you know,

942
00:55:56.830 --> 00:55:59.230
it wasn't necessarily driven in any,

943
00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:03.280
in any particular way to kind of get us to a particular career at all.

944
00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:06.310
I will say there was something else my parents did that's pretty unique and it

945
00:56:06.311 --> 00:56:10.330
was called,
uh,
my brother and I referred to as a sweet and sour summer.

946
00:56:10.331 --> 00:56:14.730
So my parents would send us for the,
sounds like a Chinese restaurant.
They would,

947
00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:15.350
yeah,

948
00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:20.020
they sentence for the first half of this summer to an internship with a relative

949
00:56:20.021 --> 00:56:22.900
or friend of the family who had an interesting job.
So at,

950
00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:28.510
I went and interned with a,
uh,
my God brother who was a lobbyist in DC.

951
00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:33.300
So I would go along with him to pitch congressmen.
I had one tie and you know,

952
00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:35.320
for,
for work I would,
I was a pretty good writer.

953
00:56:35.321 --> 00:56:38.680
So I write up one page summaries of the bills we were pitching and I would

954
00:56:38.681 --> 00:56:41.200
literally sit there with these congressmen,
with these filthy miles,
you know,

955
00:56:41.201 --> 00:56:43.690
the Alabama senator and stuff like that.
And uh,

956
00:56:44.110 --> 00:56:47.800
and watch the pitch happened and it was awesome.
I learned so much.

957
00:56:47.801 --> 00:56:50.920
I think I built so much confidence and really honed my storytelling skills.

958
00:56:50.921 --> 00:56:55.120
But then from there we'd come home and work in a construction outfit,

959
00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:58.690
uh,
with just a nasty,
nasty job.
I mean,

960
00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:03.430
whether it was hosing off the equipment that had been used to fix septic
systems,

961
00:57:03.431 --> 00:57:07.180
you know,
gas and shit up dragging shit around the yard,
filling propane tanks,

962
00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:10.900
just being junior guy on the totem told them quite literally getting my ass

963
00:57:10.901 --> 00:57:15.730
kicked by over whichever parolee was angry at me that day.
Uh,
you know,

964
00:57:15.731 --> 00:57:18.520
for minimum wage,
I think it was part of their master plan,

965
00:57:18.521 --> 00:57:22.000
which is there's a world of cool opportunities out there for you.

966
00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:27.900
But let's build within you a sense of not just work ethic but also a little kick

967
00:57:29.801 --> 00:57:32.830
in the ass by why you don't want to end up in one of these real jobs.

968
00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:37.120
And so let's see if you can find in yourself the drive to go and do whatever it

969
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:42.100
is to,
and did they choose,
for instance,
you had the introduction to save you the,

970
00:57:42.101 --> 00:57:44.590
uh,
the God brother,
I think you said for the lobbying.

971
00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:49.860
Did they also help organize the sour part to teach summer?

972
00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:50.801
Yeah.

973
00:57:50.801 --> 00:57:54.300
So that the guy ran that construction company and equipment rental companies.

974
00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:55.330
My Dad's best friend,

975
00:57:55.690 --> 00:57:58.730
and he was under strict orders to make sure we had the roughest day there,

976
00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:00.940
a special treatment.
It was w we,
yeah,

977
00:58:00.941 --> 00:58:05.730
we were treated specially shittily so we were,
we were hammered there.
Uh,

978
00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:10.390
and,
and by the way,
as a result,
I know a lot about construction equipment.

979
00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:13.030
This is,
this is a super power of mine.
Uh,

980
00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:18.090
I can literally from air compressors to ditch witches to anything you need and

981
00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:19.520
Milwaukee saws all,

982
00:58:20.410 --> 00:58:23.650
I literally have incredible amounts of knowledge in that space.

983
00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:27.700
But also just reminded me of something you mentioned long ago and I'm not sure

984
00:58:27.701 --> 00:58:30.940
if it's still true,
but you said one of the things that you look for,

985
00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:34.180
and it's maybe not a disqualifier,
but in founders is uh,

986
00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:39.670
a track record of having had at least one shitty job.
Yeah.
Uh,
yeah.

987
00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:43.050
Well I'd mix particular look for that in hiring.
So,
uh,

988
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:47.060
I want people who've lived,
studied,
traveled extensively abroad.
Uh,

989
00:58:47.350 --> 00:58:51.340
I want people who have been exposed to poor people.
And by the way,

990
00:58:51.341 --> 00:58:55.480
the live study travel works densely abroad is because you can get away with a

991
00:58:55.481 --> 00:58:58.150
very comfortable life in the United States as an English speaker,

992
00:58:58.151 --> 00:59:00.970
particularly as a white person,
you never really have to ask for anybody's help.

993
00:59:00.971 --> 00:59:03.940
You're not being perhaps harassed by the police.
It's pretty easy.

994
00:59:03.941 --> 00:59:07.870
Pickins you find yourself overseas,

995
00:59:07.871 --> 00:59:11.020
particularly in a place with a non romance language where you can't make out the

996
00:59:11.021 --> 00:59:16.021
signs yourself and you have to stop and ask for help from complete strangers.

997
00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:21.140
You literally have to be entirely vulnerable to people you've never met and just

998
00:59:21.141 --> 00:59:25.210
expose yourself and they could send you into a dark alley and beat the Heidi you

999
00:59:25.211 --> 00:59:28.190
and take your money.
Or like most people on the planet,

1000
00:59:28.191 --> 00:59:31.670
there'll be really nice and head and tried to help you even if you don't share a

1001
00:59:31.671 --> 00:59:33.950
word of English in common.

1002
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:37.220
And I think there is something incredibly foreigner about that experience of

1003
00:59:37.221 --> 00:59:40.710
having the humility that comes from having asked for help.
You know,

1004
00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:44.630
the best managers in the world are people who are great at asking for help and

1005
00:59:44.631 --> 00:59:48.650
realizing that makes them a more powerful CEO then the less powerful CEO or more

1006
00:59:48.651 --> 00:59:50.720
powerful managers than Alessy powerful manager.

1007
00:59:50.721 --> 00:59:55.160
And so I looked for people for whom athletics is a big part of their life.

1008
00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:58.340
I don't think it needs to be team sports necessarily.
I think you can,
uh,

1009
00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:01.940
you can be,
uh,
a great individual athlete,
you know,

1010
01:00:01.941 --> 01:00:05.370
maybe you train with other folks,
et Cetera.
But I think it just shows,
uh,

1011
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:10.340
not only some self discipline but also just a value on the introspection that

1012
01:00:10.341 --> 01:00:12.500
comes with athletics.
You actually care about yourself.

1013
01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:14.390
I think there's a little bit more balanced in that life.

1014
01:00:14.850 --> 01:00:19.850
It also teaches you to contend with losing and sort of viewing that as feedback

1015
01:00:20.211 --> 01:00:24.140
and not some type of failure.
Death sentence.
Sure.
And then seeing,

1016
01:00:24.141 --> 01:00:27.680
I think the temporary and it me a temporary pain is,
you know,

1017
01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:32.540
and that's temporary.
Gloria's forever.
No,
it's true.
So I mean,

1018
01:00:32.541 --> 01:00:36.380
I remember when I did an Ironman and when I was,
when I was doing that and the,

1019
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:39.680
and I had,
I had a fever that day,
I don't know,
103 degree fever,

1020
01:00:39.681 --> 01:00:41.510
but my parents had traveled out to watch the race.

1021
01:00:41.511 --> 01:00:42.680
And so I didn't want to not do it.

1022
01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:47.240
And the Advil worked for like the swim and the first part of the bike.

1023
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:50.720
And then I was just,
I was a mess.
But I remember thinking,
no matter what happens,

1024
01:00:50.721 --> 01:00:55.340
I will be in my bed tonight.
And you know,
this is a very,
very temporary moment.

1025
01:00:55.730 --> 01:01:00.560
In 2009,
I rode my bike across the country and I remember,

1026
01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:03.500
you know,
it was 35 days of riding,
basically a hundred miles a day.

1027
01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:07.280
I remember multiple days out there and I'm like,
I'll be in my bed tonight.

1028
01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.290
And then in the other ear is his voice.

1029
01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:11.150
And then I have to fucking do it again tomorrow.

1030
01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:18.910
Um,
I'm going to pull out a couple of random ones,
but,
uh,

1031
01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:23.430
what historical figure do you most identify with Buckminster Fuller?

1032
01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.510
Why?
And maybe you could give some context for people who don't know,

1033
01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:32.520
who don't recognize buggy.
So Bucky is,
I mean there,

1034
01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:38.280
I have a feeling if we went to his Wikipedia page,
there'd be a paragraph of,

1035
01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:43.830
of nouns describing the skies and mathematician.
He was a philosopher,

1036
01:01:43.831 --> 01:01:48.720
he was an engineer,
he was a poet.
He's a lecturer,
a teacher,
he's an inventor,

1037
01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:52.080
a futurist.
Uh,

1038
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:54.463
he,

1039
01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:00.400
he's one of the few people you will find that is willing to write the optimistic

1040
01:02:00.501 --> 01:02:03.080
case for technology that,

1041
01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.800
that all this stuff isn't leading us to dystopia.

1042
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:10.940
That we actually are busting Malthus,

1043
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:15.970
the Malthusian kind of quandary wide open and we now have the resources to feed

1044
01:02:16.071 --> 01:02:19.980
everyone,
clothe everyone,
power everything without having to dig.
I mean the guys,

1045
01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:23.520
he passed away 30 years ago now,
but um,

1046
01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:27.900
but there is an optimism to everything he writes there that these machines

1047
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:32.610
aren't here to take over,
that humans are good at heart.

1048
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:37.860
And there's something really inspiring about that is we wrestle with some of

1049
01:02:37.861 --> 01:02:40.880
these big scary issues about the power of

1050
01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:44.220
the Internet too.
You know,
we,

1051
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:48.840
periscope gets launched in the first week.

1052
01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:53.280
I'm getting questions from reporters about well,

1053
01:02:53.281 --> 01:02:56.160
can't isis use this to rally people?
And you're like,
seriously,

1054
01:02:56.161 --> 01:02:58.170
that's the part you're going to focus on a periscope.

1055
01:02:58.171 --> 01:03:00.900
Like all of the amazing uses for periscope,

1056
01:03:00.901 --> 01:03:05.280
which I think is absolutely groundbreaking technology and really,
really cool.

1057
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:09.120
And people are so focused on that negative case.
And you had the same time.

1058
01:03:09.121 --> 01:03:12.450
I think Paris can be used to inspire,
educate.

1059
01:03:12.451 --> 01:03:17.070
He'll bring people together across so many different planes that it's easy to

1060
01:03:17.071 --> 01:03:18.510
get distracted by that negative case.

1061
01:03:18.511 --> 01:03:23.511
But I think Bucky more than anyone I know found optimism and the stuff that

1062
01:03:25.411 --> 01:03:26.040
could otherwise be

1063
01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:30.380
<v 3>pretty daunting.
He also didn't he also create a,</v>

1064
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:34.310
it's not geodesic,
that's not the word I'm looking for.
The domes.
Yeah,
the sphere.

1065
01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:38.460
Your district domes.
Isaac dumps that you see people constructing at burning man.

1066
01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:44.250
Yeah.
Fascinating guy.
Um,
in the Bucky ball and the Bucky ball.

1067
01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:47.930
Really interesting dude.
Also.
Uh,
uh,

1068
01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:51.620
what was the concept?
It was really,

1069
01:03:51.621 --> 01:03:53.740
I'm axiom there were more there.

1070
01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:58.450
There's some type of tensegrity 10 Segretti which good,
good man.
So this,

1071
01:03:58.451 --> 01:04:02.310
this concept of 10 Segretti I'm not going to do it,
do it justice,
but it,

1072
01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:05.460
there were some really interesting parallels between his discussion of this

1073
01:04:05.461 --> 01:04:09.180
concept of tensegrity and the role of Fascia within the body.

1074
01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:10.890
Because if you didn't have fashion,

1075
01:04:10.891 --> 01:04:13.730
I mean your organs are basically just dropped down to the bottom of your like

1076
01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:17.250
Tor forso cavity and just sit there in a pool of,
of nasty meat.

1077
01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:22.200
But you have this Fascia that holds you together.
A super,

1078
01:04:22.201 --> 01:04:24.210
super interesting guy.
Uh,
completely agreed.

1079
01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.670
Did you collect anything when you were,
when you were a kid

1080
01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.600
<v 4>and then we need to talk about your notebook.
Yeah,</v>

1081
01:04:30.610 --> 01:04:35.050
I mean I collected money so I'll have to money.
I mean I was just,
Oh,

1082
01:04:35.110 --> 01:04:37.510
I always wanted to make money.
It just,

1083
01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:42.520
I do the backstroke like uncle scrooge and the pool of coins.
Yeah.

1084
01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:46.360
Excuse me.
I scratch my monocle swearing through.
Right room full of gold coins.

1085
01:04:46.361 --> 01:04:47.194
No,
I,

1086
01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:51.550
I was a hustler from day one.

1087
01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:55.750
I grew up middle class so we never had wants of anything,

1088
01:04:55.751 --> 01:04:59.590
but I always thought there would be a certain independence that came with money.

1089
01:04:59.591 --> 01:05:01.780
I was certain excitement that came with making money.

1090
01:05:01.781 --> 01:05:06.781
And so from the earliest days I would you ever seen the,

1091
01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:10.420
like those pungent walnuts that come out of a tree,
they've got that green,

1092
01:05:10.421 --> 01:05:13.800
pungent skin on them.
And if you,
if you pierce it with a fork,

1093
01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:17.650
it smells like ammonia salad.
Grab those things out of our yard,

1094
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.160
putting my wagon,
pierce holes and all of them.

1095
01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:23.950
Then I build a sign that says air fresheners,
25 cents in it.

1096
01:05:23.951 --> 01:05:26.380
Like I'd put it on my brother,
like a sandwich board,

1097
01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:29.290
my younger brother and I tow it up and down the street and sell these things

1098
01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:32.590
door to door and all the people would call my parents and just picked,

1099
01:05:32.591 --> 01:05:33.590
do you know where your son is?

1100
01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:38.110
But they'd still by him it's like clear like three,
four bucks,
come home,
richest,

1101
01:05:38.130 --> 01:05:41.800
you know,
Richard's six year old and the neighborhood and uh,

1102
01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.590
I just love that hustle.
I was always going after something.

1103
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:47.380
Is that something you were just pre programmed to do or did your parents

1104
01:05:47.381 --> 01:05:50.410
facilitate that?
It's not,
it's not either my parents game at all.

1105
01:05:50.411 --> 01:05:51.620
Like they were notes.

1106
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:56.670
I mean my mom is a really accomplished professor and author in the field of

1107
01:05:58.001 --> 01:05:58.600
education.

1108
01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:03.600
My Dad is incredible small town lawyer who frankly could have made a lot more

1109
01:06:04.481 --> 01:06:07.390
money but was constantly doing pro bono work for people in our town.

1110
01:06:07.391 --> 01:06:10.270
He's incredibly revered person with so much goodwill,

1111
01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:15.640
and so neither of them were,
were hustlers like that,

1112
01:06:15.641 --> 01:06:17.860
but I was always looking for the angle.
So movie,

1113
01:06:17.861 --> 01:06:20.740
did you watch like the toy or what was their trading places?

1114
01:06:20.741 --> 01:06:24.630
Was there a trigger or training plays a good movie?
No,
I mean,
I will say,

1115
01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:29.110
you know,
I traded baseball cards despite not liking baseball at all.

1116
01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:33.880
I never watched any games,
but like that 86,
87 Don Resi or the 85 tops,

1117
01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:34.621
you know,

1118
01:06:34.621 --> 01:06:37.990
it can Seiko rookies and the Roger Clemens rookies that Mark McGuire Olympic

1119
01:06:37.991 --> 01:06:39.340
card from 84,
like,

1120
01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:44.080
I was really into those things because I was good at it and I could make money

1121
01:06:44.081 --> 01:06:47.710
doing it later.
I realized that was really good at playing cards too.

1122
01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:51.670
So I played a lot of cards.
I ran a card room in my high school,

1123
01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:54.430
one of my teachers.
What type of card games?
We talked,
uh,

1124
01:06:54.490 --> 01:06:55.580
we were playing a lot of [inaudible],

1125
01:06:55.630 --> 01:07:00.500
which is a game that's only played in New Orleans and Lockport,
New York.
Uh,

1126
01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:04.930
it's a really high stakes geometrically growing pot game.

1127
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:07.420
And so,
uh,
you can really,

1128
01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.770
you can get Scutter fools and so especially if you're teaching them the rules,

1129
01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:14.020
a lot of that,
a lot of hearts,
a lot of bid pitch,

1130
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:19.390
a lot of ac DC and just really street games that,

1131
01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:24.220
and we had a teacher who took a rake.
Uh,
I had him,

1132
01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:25.840
I had them on the take so we could,
uh,

1133
01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:29.470
he could write passes so people get to the card room,

1134
01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.020
but I always kind of just had to hustle.
And I got how old was that?

1135
01:07:32.050 --> 01:07:36.040
How old were you?
Uh,
I did that.
I started that in junior high.
Uh,

1136
01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.740
one of our friends.
What does this teacher teach?
What was their subject?
No,

1137
01:07:38.741 --> 01:07:43.030
one of our friends,
his mom was a teacher and so she had an office.

1138
01:07:43.031 --> 01:07:44.830
So we got to use the office as the card room.

1139
01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:49.060
That was more easy to see back then.
It wasn't a really cerebral game.
Uh,

1140
01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:52.720
but again,
it had the progressive pot type stuff in high school.
It was my,

1141
01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:58.150
is my cross country coach and a in American history teacher,
Mr Maine,

1142
01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.820
he was a gem and I was that guy.

1143
01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:04.030
He just knew that I wasn't cut out for public high school.
And so he,

1144
01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:09.310
he really helped me see,
you've also,
you've always had this hustle.
Uh,
I want to,

1145
01:08:09.311 --> 01:08:12.790
I have to ask and if you want to Perry,
this one feel free,

1146
01:08:12.791 --> 01:08:16.100
but so I've heard these rumors that you got through law school without going to

1147
01:08:16.101 --> 01:08:19.220
any classes.
Yeah.
Well I,
if I,

1148
01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:23.970
if you go to class then they've got your name on the seating chart.
Yeah.

1149
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.730
The first day you have to sign a seating chart.

1150
01:08:25.731 --> 01:08:28.880
It goes around and then he'd sit in the same seat everyday in law school.

1151
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:32.570
But if you don't go to class and her name's not on the seating chart and so they

1152
01:08:32.571 --> 01:08:34.610
can't call on you and realize you're not going to class.

1153
01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:39.710
And so instead you go to the exams and the exams are just printed off the

1154
01:08:39.711 --> 01:08:43.370
registrar's role.
Right.
Sued and that the teacher of the class isn't there,

1155
01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:46.760
so you just sit down for the exam and if you're a good test taker you can kill

1156
01:08:46.761 --> 01:08:51.080
it.
And I was amazing.
I had some of the best grades in my law school.

1157
01:08:51.290 --> 01:08:55.400
How did you,
How did York Street,
that was the method to the mat?
Well,

1158
01:08:55.401 --> 01:08:58.580
the funny thing is unlike any other college class or Mba class,

1159
01:08:58.581 --> 01:09:03.200
what's taught in the classroom in law school a has nothing to do with being a

1160
01:09:03.201 --> 01:09:06.650
lawyer and be has very little to even do with the exam.
It's,

1161
01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:09.500
it's such a joke man.
The Socratic method and stuff like that.

1162
01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:13.400
I think there are some people who need to be taught to think linearly,
you know,

1163
01:09:13.401 --> 01:09:18.170
pro con,
pro con,
pro con.
But I think by that point I and my roommate,

1164
01:09:18.171 --> 01:09:19.760
Kevin Cody,
who you've met,
you know,

1165
01:09:19.790 --> 01:09:23.960
we're already their own brainer brainer capital was the year ahead of us at

1166
01:09:23.961 --> 01:09:26.720
Georgetown law school and he helped us realize this method.

1167
01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:28.820
He was like the Tim Ferriss at Georgetown law school.

1168
01:09:29.150 --> 01:09:33.140
He helped us understand what was important,
what wasn't.
Um,
and it,
you know,

1169
01:09:33.141 --> 01:09:35.390
in my heart of hearts,
I wasn't really there to be a lawyer.

1170
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:37.940
I think if I'd want it to be a litigator,

1171
01:09:37.941 --> 01:09:40.820
if I really wanted to go try things before the Supreme Court,

1172
01:09:41.230 --> 01:09:43.940
I think going to law school and actually attending classes and interacting

1173
01:09:43.941 --> 01:09:45.020
would've been a great exercise.

1174
01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:50.300
I went there because I thought it was my fastest path to a seat at the table in

1175
01:09:50.301 --> 01:09:54.890
Silicon Valley.
I wanted to be in the middle of a deal and,

1176
01:09:55.940 --> 01:09:58.850
and have people listen to me even though they probably shouldn't cause I had

1177
01:09:58.851 --> 01:10:01.790
very limited experience,
but I want it to be in the Maelstrom.

1178
01:10:01.791 --> 01:10:04.970
And I knew that if I went and got to kick ass a lot of you with great grades,

1179
01:10:04.971 --> 01:10:09.971
I could end up at a kickass law firm in Silicon Valley and via guy who at 25,

1180
01:10:11.181 --> 01:10:15.860
26 they were going to listen to where else does that happen?
So,
uh,

1181
01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:19.610
so that was the path.
But yeah,
I kicked ass in.
What school?
Without going to any,

1182
01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:23.320
I will say this,
I,
you might've heard the legend,
but,
uh,
so the,

1183
01:10:23.321 --> 01:10:26.390
the thing that you do need are some notes from some of the classes to understand

1184
01:10:26.391 --> 01:10:30.350
like which cases the,
the professor brought up and what they think is important.

1185
01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:31.700
And so,
uh,

1186
01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:37.450
I threw a keg party every semester where the only thing you had to bring to get

1187
01:10:38.031 --> 01:10:39.410
into the party where your notes,

1188
01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:45.470
so classmates would bring their notes to the party,
throw them in a Bin,

1189
01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:47.990
and then I would go to xerox and mall and,

1190
01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:51.620
and build kind of a composite and use that to study for the exams as the
cheeses.

1191
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.050
And the,
the notebook that you found not too long ago,

1192
01:10:57.740 --> 01:10:58.880
this all tracks together,

1193
01:10:58.910 --> 01:11:03.470
but we're approaching it and kind of a memento type fashion that the notebook

1194
01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:06.530
until people about this notebook.
Yeah,
it was funny.
I was just,

1195
01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.870
just two years ago,
I found this in my garage and it's really,

1196
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:11.690
it's been weighing on me in particularly this week,
turning 40.

1197
01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:17.280
So I was 19 and I was 20 years old.
Actually,
I was 20.

1198
01:11:17.850 --> 01:11:21.180
I was living in Ireland.
Uh,
going to school there.

1199
01:11:21.181 --> 01:11:24.540
I spent two out of my four years abroad while at the school of foreign service

1200
01:11:24.541 --> 01:11:28.920
at Georgetown and some living in Ireland and there was an ex pat girl and one of

1201
01:11:28.921 --> 01:11:32.550
my classes and we were basically flirting with each other by taking a notebook

1202
01:11:32.551 --> 01:11:36.720
and writing in 10 questions for the other person to answer and then you get,

1203
01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:40.710
you get it back and you answer 10 questions and write 10 new questions.

1204
01:11:40.711 --> 01:11:44.430
We pass back and forth while we're supposed to be studying like 20th century

1205
01:11:44.431 --> 01:11:45.900
Irish film or something like that.

1206
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:50.010
And at 1.1 of the questions was what do you want to be when you grow up?

1207
01:11:51.090 --> 01:11:54.030
Some 20 I'm living in Cork,
Ireland.

1208
01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:58.350
We basically would start drinking stout around 11:30 AM every day.

1209
01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:03.380
It was like second and third meal with Stout and by that point I'd still never

1210
01:12:04.351 --> 01:12:05.460
heard of an investment banker.

1211
01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:09.720
I definitely never heard of venture capitalists and so I just write in there.

1212
01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:12.360
I said,
I don't know what the,
what the job is called,

1213
01:12:12.810 --> 01:12:15.720
but I know it's going to involve a lot of talking on the phone a lot in

1214
01:12:15.721 --> 01:12:20.070
negotiating,
a lot of yelling at people,
high risk,
high reward,

1215
01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.260
unbelievably high stakes.

1216
01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:26.250
I'm going to do it part time from the mountains parttime from the beach and

1217
01:12:26.251 --> 01:12:27.120
whatever it is.

1218
01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:32.720
I'm going to be done with it before I'm 40 and so two years ago my wife and I

1219
01:12:33.151 --> 01:12:38.070
are standing in our garage and our mountain house cleaning it out because we're

1220
01:12:38.071 --> 01:12:42.570
moving some stuff down to our beach house and I find this old notebook and I'm

1221
01:12:42.571 --> 01:12:42.691
like,

1222
01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:46.890
hey look at this and we're flipping through it and I find that answer I guess

1223
01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:47.970
really choked up.

1224
01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:53.240
It was incredibly weird self prophecy that I kind of laid out exactly what my

1225
01:12:53.281 --> 01:12:57.810
job was,
but I also felt a certain amount of pressure like so what do I do now?

1226
01:12:57.811 --> 01:13:00.210
I'm 42,
I keep doing this job or not.
Or do I need to,

1227
01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:02.670
do I need to listen to the scrolls,

1228
01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:08.580
like shatter some type of cosmic continuum if you,

1229
01:13:08.581 --> 01:13:11.100
if you don't follow the prophecy the um,

1230
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:15.660
so you do spend a lot of time on the phone or you have historically clearly very

1231
01:13:15.661 --> 01:13:17.370
good storyteller.
What are the,

1232
01:13:17.490 --> 01:13:20.250
what are the words or phrases that you overuse the most?

1233
01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:26.760
The words or phrases that I overused the most amazing bananas.

1234
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:31.020
Cocoa nuts.
It's cocoa nuts.
A close cousin to bananas.
Yeah,

1235
01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:33.020
that is coco nuts up.

1236
01:13:35.490 --> 01:13:39.840
I use the phrase that said a lot as a transition.
You know,

1237
01:13:39.841 --> 01:13:42.810
transition words are really important for me because having,

1238
01:13:42.930 --> 01:13:45.120
I know you've studied how to learn other languages.

1239
01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:50.430
One of the things I always focused on when studying and I speak Spanish was,

1240
01:13:50.490 --> 01:13:54.750
was transition where it's like seen him about her go.
Like nevertheless,
you know,

1241
01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:56.520
like I needed,

1242
01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:59.850
I needed to have those transition words down cause that's how I could tell a

1243
01:13:59.851 --> 01:14:01.980
good story.
That's how I would lay out.
We're a new paragraph.

1244
01:14:01.981 --> 01:14:05.860
Even if you haven't been following me.
I got a new concept coming and,

1245
01:14:06.930 --> 01:14:09.090
and I really think studying it that way and bringing it back.

1246
01:14:09.091 --> 01:14:11.350
I used to live in Spain,
in Ecuador,
El Salvador.

1247
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:14.950
I'm bringing that back to my English and I realized I'm really clear about my

1248
01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:18.940
transition where it's now so hard return.
That's it.
Yeah.

1249
01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:23.830
But I am,
I mean you can ask Matt Mazzeo my partner,
you know,

1250
01:14:23.831 --> 01:14:28.720
we write updates to our investors that no other fun does.
Like we write deep,

1251
01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:32.680
colorful narrative about all of our investments,
the state of our companies,

1252
01:14:32.681 --> 01:14:35.680
a state of the industry,
our own personal states,
what we're thinking about.

1253
01:14:36.370 --> 01:14:40.000
And by the time you see one of those as an investor,

1254
01:14:40.570 --> 01:14:43.670
I probably edited that thing like Os you know,

1255
01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:47.800
draft 15 to 20 times.
I'm obsessive about writing.

1256
01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:50.740
It needs to be crisp,
original,

1257
01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:54.340
no repetition of words and phrases.
I need to bring it.

1258
01:14:54.370 --> 01:14:58.090
And that was something I got directly from my parents who were both exceptional

1259
01:14:58.091 --> 01:15:00.880
writers.
But I think in,

1260
01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.660
in colloquial terms,
when we're talking with people,

1261
01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:09.610
I try and emulate whatever the language pattern is or the person I'm talking to,

1262
01:15:09.611 --> 01:15:12.730
it makes them feel better.
I don't even think I'd do it consciously.
Like,

1263
01:15:12.731 --> 01:15:13.930
you come to an island like this,

1264
01:15:13.931 --> 01:15:18.520
it's staffed all by Brits and you can't help but suddenly find you're ours

1265
01:15:18.521 --> 01:15:22.120
getting a little bit funny and you're like,
okay,
okay,
hold off.
Yeah.
But,
uh,

1266
01:15:22.450 --> 01:15:26.080
but I think that's something I really try and focus on is speaking in the same

1267
01:15:26.081 --> 01:15:27.610
speed as the person I'm talking to.

1268
01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:32.240
<v 3>You seem to have had a very clear picture as reflected in the notebook and</v>

1269
01:15:32.241 --> 01:15:36.440
obviously the early hustle you had this drive that seem to point of very

1270
01:15:36.441 --> 01:15:37.490
particular direction.

1271
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:41.690
I know that when I was about to graduate from college,

1272
01:15:41.691 --> 01:15:46.010
I had no idea of what my next move was and law school hadn't even entered,

1273
01:15:46.190 --> 01:15:48.620
uh,
the sort of realm of consideration.

1274
01:15:49.130 --> 01:15:52.910
What would your advice be to college students who are just about to graduate,

1275
01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:56.600
who have no idea,
kind of what they should focus on,
which what they should do.

1276
01:15:56.601 --> 01:15:57.434
Do you have any,

1277
01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:01.280
any thoughts going to general suggestions that you would make to someone in that

1278
01:16:01.281 --> 01:16:02.114
position?

1279
01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:05.740
<v 4>Well,
I did give a graduation speech,
uh,</v>

1280
01:16:05.741 --> 01:16:08.820
I think it was two years ago now at the University of Minnesota School.

1281
01:16:08.821 --> 01:16:10.110
I didn't really have any ties to,

1282
01:16:10.530 --> 01:16:13.340
and they reached out to an agent who hired me for,

1283
01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:16.160
and that was daunting,
right?

1284
01:16:16.161 --> 01:16:20.100
Because I give speeches all the time and it's usually to a room full of like

1285
01:16:20.101 --> 01:16:24.630
Conoco executives in Kissimmee,
Florida and I'm just there for the check.
But

1286
01:16:26.370 --> 01:16:29.970
the graduation speeches intense,
that's a hopefully memorable,

1287
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.110
hopefully formative.

1288
01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:35.370
Hopefully you're talking to people who have incredibly open minds and it's such

1289
01:16:35.371 --> 01:16:40.230
a meaningful transition point in their lives,
so
everyone should go watch it.

1290
01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:43.890
Um,
but what I focused on was be interesting.

1291
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:47.970
I think
you know,
here you're,

1292
01:16:47.971 --> 01:16:52.650
you're here for a week where I've gathered my favorite friends and one of the

1293
01:16:52.651 --> 01:16:56.640
reasons why the week is so fun for everybody is that everyone else here is

1294
01:16:56.641 --> 01:17:00.540
totally interesting,
right?
Not necessarily a titan of business,

1295
01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:06.030
but just interesting,
compassionate
adventure.

1296
01:17:06.031 --> 01:17:08.520
Some people who just go for it,
who are up for it.

1297
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:13.940
And I think as I look around who I've hired,
who I like to work with,
who I back,

1298
01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:17.140
they're interesting.
They're people you want to be around,

1299
01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:19.580
you want to spend time with,
you want to hear their answers.

1300
01:17:19.610 --> 01:17:21.170
You want them to influence your thinking.

1301
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:24.500
You want them to push you a little bit to try things that you haven't tried.

1302
01:17:24.501 --> 01:17:25.520
You want them to teach you.

1303
01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:31.150
And if I could give advice to someone who feels like they're looking at a maze

1304
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:35.330
of opportunities and none of them is particularly presented or they're not sure

1305
01:17:35.331 --> 01:17:40.070
how they want to get ahead or distinguished themselves,
I think pursuing a,

1306
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:44.900
a course of life that embraces interestingness.
And by the way,

1307
01:17:44.901 --> 01:17:46.820
I don't think people are born interesting.

1308
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:51.560
I think it's actually something you can accrue living abroad,

1309
01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:55.460
volunteering for a group like charity,
water and going into the field,

1310
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.740
taking an actual service job,

1311
01:17:58.850 --> 01:18:02.480
going in and talking to the people around you and having meaningful

1312
01:18:02.481 --> 01:18:05.830
conversations,
including the homeless people,
including a,

1313
01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:10.130
your neighbors and people who are actually working for wage.
Um,

1314
01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:13.120
getting involved in politics briefly.
You know,
I think I,

1315
01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:17.720
I campaign for Obama a couple of times and I was everything from one of his top

1316
01:18:17.721 --> 01:18:20.900
fundraisers to,
I actually spent time in the field in Elko,
Nevada,

1317
01:18:20.901 --> 01:18:25.550
which put me into the mobile home living rooms of some of the poorest people in

1318
01:18:25.551 --> 01:18:29.180
the country who,
who somehow were supporting,
you know,

1319
01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:32.630
the Republican Party in that election.
And it was,
it was surreal,

1320
01:18:32.631 --> 01:18:35.450
but it gave me a life perspective that I don't think I would have had otherwise.

1321
01:18:35.451 --> 01:18:36.480
So,
um,

1322
01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:41.150
I think those kinds of things make for a much more compelling people and we'll

1323
01:18:41.151 --> 01:18:43.400
start to present career opportunities.

1324
01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:49.010
<v 1>So one question that I'd love to ask is when you were sort of in your most</v>

1325
01:18:49.011 --> 01:18:51.410
recent sweet spot of wealth accumulation,
uh,

1326
01:18:51.411 --> 01:18:53.990
whether it was related to what you did with Twitter or otherwise,

1327
01:18:54.710 --> 01:18:58.910
were there any particular shifts,
routines,
habits,

1328
01:18:58.911 --> 01:19:02.780
that helped you because it would maintain that peak output or achieve what you

1329
01:19:02.781 --> 01:19:03.614
did?

1330
01:19:04.930 --> 01:19:06.760
<v 4>Yeah,
so I mean,
you know my personal story,</v>

1331
01:19:06.761 --> 01:19:11.290
so I certainly have been fortunate to make a bunch of money in last few years.

1332
01:19:11.291 --> 01:19:15.970
But Penn bubble one,
I made a bunch of money,
I levered up,

1333
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:19.360
lost it all and a lot more leaving me millions of dollars in the hall,

1334
01:19:19.361 --> 01:19:24.361
was able to work it back out to zero by 2005 and since then,

1335
01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:26.410
you know a lot of work,
a few ups and downs,

1336
01:19:26.411 --> 01:19:29.410
but it's worked out pretty well and it's looking good for the road ahead too.

1337
01:19:29.411 --> 01:19:33.010
So that said,
I don't think there was any particular,

1338
01:19:33.011 --> 01:19:36.280
like I don't think I have a calendaring function or an email function or

1339
01:19:36.281 --> 01:19:36.851
anything like that.

1340
01:19:36.851 --> 01:19:41.851
That's like a hack as much as I would point to two things that I think shifted

1341
01:19:42.131 --> 01:19:43.120
the nature of my business.

1342
01:19:43.121 --> 01:19:48.121
One was that before I had really made any money at all,

1343
01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:51.760
and before I had any business doing this,
my then girlfriend,

1344
01:19:51.761 --> 01:19:56.500
who's now my wife crystal and I moved out of silicon valley up to Truckee.

1345
01:19:57.260 --> 01:20:01.240
I mean literally took ourselves out of the game as a,
you know,

1346
01:20:01.241 --> 01:20:03.940
an angel and venture investor.
Like how do you,

1347
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:07.000
how do you manage a venture practice from up in Lake Tahoe?

1348
01:20:07.710 --> 01:20:09.960
And yet what I realized was that being in the city,

1349
01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:14.760
I was just playing defense the whole time I was taking these coffee meetings,

1350
01:20:14.761 --> 01:20:18.000
listening to these poor pitches,
you know,
being,

1351
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:22.140
being friendly and kind of obliging people with their ideas.
But,
uh,

1352
01:20:22.170 --> 01:20:25.300
I'd spend all day in these meetings and I'd get home and I'd be like,
shit,
I,

1353
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:27.360
I haven't actually accomplished anything.

1354
01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:31.050
I would go to the cocktail and dinner parties I was invited to,

1355
01:20:31.051 --> 01:20:33.570
but they weren't actually the people I wanted to spend the time with.

1356
01:20:34.290 --> 01:20:34.860
And so I was just,

1357
01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:38.070
I was just reacting to everything rather than actually going out and

1358
01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:40.351
playing offense.

1359
01:20:40.351 --> 01:20:45.030
And so Chris and I moved up to Tahoe and we quite literally built a list of

1360
01:20:45.031 --> 01:20:48.840
people we want it to know better and we just started inviting them to come up

1361
01:20:48.841 --> 01:20:52.440
and stay with us in Tahoe.
Um,
you were definitely one of those people,
right?

1362
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:55.500
And you came up and spent a lot of time with us there.
We,

1363
01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:59.670
I also started running list of the companies that I wanted to get to know better

1364
01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:02.580
and I just went in deep with them and ask them to come up to Tahoe.

1365
01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:07.260
And so I was playing offense now and I had a perfect excuse for why I couldn't

1366
01:21:07.261 --> 01:21:09.270
get coffee with all the randoms and like,
Hey,
I'm sorry,

1367
01:21:09.271 --> 01:21:11.220
I'm just not in San Francisco.
I'm three hours away.

1368
01:21:11.610 --> 01:21:15.060
There were a couple of successive sue drew who drove all the way up there.
Uh,

1369
01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:20.010
but for the most part I was able to pick and choose the interactions that I

1370
01:21:20.011 --> 01:21:24.600
thought were going to be most valuable to me,
to my wife,

1371
01:21:24.930 --> 01:21:29.440
into my business.
And that was a huge shift and it was risky as hell.
Cause I,

1372
01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:29.731
I mean,

1373
01:21:29.731 --> 01:21:32.880
I couldn't even really afford the house we bought up there when we first bought

1374
01:21:32.881 --> 01:21:36.960
it.
$600,000 three bedroom house.
Uh,
and,

1375
01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:42.570
and I certainly didn't have a strong enough brand that I could afford to just

1376
01:21:42.571 --> 01:21:43.860
walk away from the game.

1377
01:21:44.010 --> 01:21:47.550
But I made a conscious decision to play offense from up there and that worked

1378
01:21:47.551 --> 01:21:49.260
out.
I mean,
I got to know guys like you really well.

1379
01:21:49.261 --> 01:21:50.880
Travis spent a lot of time in our house.

1380
01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:55.080
I haven't Liam's and Jason Goldman from the Twitter team.
Uh,

1381
01:21:55.081 --> 01:21:59.790
we had teams like,
uh,
I mean the local guys,
there's a great deal.

1382
01:21:59.791 --> 01:22:03.270
We sold to go daddy.
We just had many,
many teams as well as many friends.

1383
01:22:03.271 --> 01:22:07.260
Ted Rheingold who found our doctrine cats are now COO at one of our hottest

1384
01:22:07.261 --> 01:22:09.780
companies in venture was a guy we got to know very well from staying in our

1385
01:22:09.781 --> 01:22:13.240
house.
TV,
you'll have itch CEO and founder of open DNS guy.

1386
01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:15.030
We got to know really well stay in our place in Truckee.

1387
01:22:15.031 --> 01:22:18.120
And so these are people who would just go deep with Garrett camp.

1388
01:22:18.121 --> 01:22:20.370
Spent some time there.
Just just a really,

1389
01:22:20.371 --> 01:22:24.300
really cool crew that I think we got to know way better and build much more

1390
01:22:24.301 --> 01:22:28.140
meaningful relationships,
breaking bread,
making dinner,
uh,
hiking,
skiing,

1391
01:22:28.141 --> 01:22:28.974
that kind of stuff.

1392
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:33.420
The second thing that I think was different was that after a couple of years of

1393
01:22:33.421 --> 01:22:38.160
trying to explain to people why Twitter was going to be a real business,

1394
01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:41.520
you know,
people look at me like,
how are they ever going to make any money?

1395
01:22:41.521 --> 01:22:45.090
And I'm like,
man,
if you don't see that,
and so I finally just said,
fuck it.

1396
01:22:45.091 --> 01:22:47.370
I'm not here to convince you anymore.
I'm just going to buy all your stock.

1397
01:22:47.970 --> 01:22:50.880
And there was just this,
there was a bit that flipped for me as a seed investor,

1398
01:22:50.881 --> 01:22:54.190
you have to be very collaborative.
You're constantly trying to get,
you know,

1399
01:22:54.630 --> 01:22:57.210
basically bring people into your world view and say,
okay,

1400
01:22:57.211 --> 01:22:58.500
do you see the future of this company?

1401
01:22:58.501 --> 01:23:02.040
This is why you want to invest in this company and the series a or series B.

1402
01:23:02.041 --> 01:23:06.190
This is why you want to buy this,
why you want to work there.
And I got so fed

1403
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:08.400
<v 2>up with doing that on Twitter,
I was just like,
fuck it.
If you,</v>

1404
01:23:08.410 --> 01:23:10.060
if you can't see it anymore,

1405
01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.580
then you don't deserve to make any money on this company.

1406
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:15.370
There's just like just on hand the fucking shares,
I'll take them.

1407
01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:20.200
And so I just started buying that stock up from early investors who wanted to

1408
01:23:20.201 --> 01:23:22.900
bail,
et cetera.
And by the time of the IPO,

1409
01:23:23.710 --> 01:23:27.430
my affiliated funds that were doing this own more of it than anybody else,

1410
01:23:27.431 --> 01:23:31.920
we had about 18% of the company.
And so that worked.
Uh,

1411
01:23:32.230 --> 01:23:35.410
and so there's this,
there's a few times where,
you know,

1412
01:23:35.411 --> 01:23:39.250
that wasn't necessarily the polite or most political way to go about this thing.

1413
01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.670
Uh,
it certainly,

1414
01:23:40.671 --> 01:23:43.450
it was daunting the amount of money I had to raise to buy that much of the

1415
01:23:43.451 --> 01:23:47.380
company.
But the bitch has flipped man.
I was like,
fuck it.

1416
01:23:47.381 --> 01:23:49.060
I'm just not going to play this traditionally anymore.

1417
01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:54.140
<v 1>No.
The uh,
just to touch on one aspect of that,</v>

1418
01:23:54.150 --> 01:23:56.480
I know we have to get ready for dinner and run in a few minutes.

1419
01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.840
We'll wrap up and maybe do around too.
Sometimes people like this.

1420
01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:01.910
<v 2>Otherwise it's seventies disco night tonight.
Are you ready?</v>

1421
01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:02.381
<v 1>Oh,</v>

1422
01:24:02.381 --> 01:24:06.940
you have no idea how hard I sacrificed luggage space for all of my other stuff

1423
01:24:06.970 --> 01:24:08.560
so I could get my disco gear here.

1424
01:24:09.090 --> 01:24:11.290
<v 2>So can I just ask the luggage space question?
Yes.</v>

1425
01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:15.050
Is is that why you insist on wearing the speedo when you swim here?
Is that,

1426
01:24:16.490 --> 01:24:18.980
please tell me.
There's some reason to,
other than at lunch we,

1427
01:24:19.730 --> 01:24:24.650
we came to the conclusion that you might actually be aspiring to be a seven year

1428
01:24:24.651 --> 01:24:27.860
old German man at some point.
Like that's the,
that's the path your life is on.

1429
01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:32.120
Like Bruce Jenner is on a transition to womanhood and you're on a path to

1430
01:24:32.121 --> 01:24:33.650
transition to being a seven year old German man.

1431
01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:37.110
<v 1>I was thinking more like a Greek men cause I saw this photo,</v>

1432
01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.400
it would actually wouldn't know it wasn't a photo.

1433
01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:42.600
There was this guy walking down the beach passing me and a friend and I was in

1434
01:24:42.601 --> 01:24:46.560
these like really baggy board shorts,
like cool fucking Brazilian surfer style.

1435
01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:50.250
Horrible.
The swimming,
by the way.
It's like swimming with a parachute behind you,

1436
01:24:50.650 --> 01:24:53.330
uh,
by walking down in this,
this Greek guy won it,
wanders by,

1437
01:24:53.331 --> 01:24:58.331
he's got like he's Ballou skivvies on that are just like his guts hanging out.

1438
01:24:59.360 --> 01:24:59.630
Oh.

1439
01:24:59.630 --> 01:25:04.630
Like basically covering up 70% of them covered with obviously like silver back

1440
01:25:05.521 --> 01:25:06.354
hair,

1441
01:25:06.570 --> 01:25:11.570
massive gold chains glasses could not look fucking happier and he just gave zero

1442
01:25:12.571 --> 01:25:14.730
fucks about Arpin and whatsoever.
So I was like,
you know,

1443
01:25:14.731 --> 01:25:17.580
I need to like put it on the training bra if I'm going to get to that point.

1444
01:25:17.581 --> 01:25:20.630
So I do wear the,
uh,
the speed of them.

1445
01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:24.910
<v 2>No,
but your power move today was you came to the lunch table on the beach with</v>

1446
01:25:24.911 --> 01:25:27.910
regular trunks on and everyone commented like,
oh,
thank God Tim,

1447
01:25:27.911 --> 01:25:30.820
wear regular trunks.
And then as you walk towards the beach,

1448
01:25:30.850 --> 01:25:32.190
you dropped your regular trucks.

1449
01:25:32.191 --> 01:25:35.790
They were almost where they tearaways and revealed the speedo and then it

1450
01:25:35.791 --> 01:25:36.624
proceeded to swim.

1451
01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:37.591
<v 1>Well,</v>

1452
01:25:37.591 --> 01:25:41.640
the excuse that I'll use is a part of the reason I think I failed to learn to

1453
01:25:41.641 --> 01:25:42.960
swim properly for a long time.

1454
01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:45.720
It was partially a wardrobe malfunction cause I'd wear these baggy shorts,

1455
01:25:45.721 --> 01:25:50.490
it would hold me back.
So,
um,
this is a,
this is my effort to be more dolphin.

1456
01:25:50.491 --> 01:25:52.430
Like unless drowning monkey like,
all right,

1457
01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:55.170
<v 2>well it does,
it does work in the water.
It's just on land,</v>

1458
01:25:55.410 --> 01:25:59.080
<v 1>on land.
It's a bit,
it can be offensive to,
uh,
to,
to the,</v>

1459
01:25:59.081 --> 01:26:03.920
to the more sensitive Americans among us.
But uh,
yes.

1460
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:06.530
So that also takes up less space.
It's,
it's,
you can fold it up,

1461
01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:06.960
<v 4>but it was,</v>

1462
01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:09.940
I figured I really wanted to believe that you weren't wearing those because

1463
01:26:09.941 --> 01:26:11.150
you've liked them as much as it were.

1464
01:26:11.630 --> 01:26:14.180
<v 1>What are the structures here?
What are the guys doing?
Kite surfing or something.</v>

1465
01:26:14.181 --> 01:26:18.170
He was like,
is he wearing those seriously?
Or like,
ironically he did that.

1466
01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:24.410
So on a completely unrelated note,
uh,
we're the fuck was I going to go with that?

1467
01:26:24.411 --> 01:26:28.100
Who knows?
I tell you what,
I know we're tight for time,
so I will,
um,

1468
01:26:28.730 --> 01:26:32.750
two last questions and then maybe we can revisit a bunch of this another time.

1469
01:26:32.751 --> 01:26:36.230
But is there any purchase that you have made?

1470
01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:38.210
Could be years ago or recently,

1471
01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:42.440
less than a hundred dollars it had a a significant positive impact on your life.

1472
01:26:46.650 --> 01:26:48.570
<v 4>Okay.
The F,
I mean just draft top of the head.</v>

1473
01:26:48.571 --> 01:26:50.850
The first thing that jumped in my head was there's a Buckminster fuller book

1474
01:26:50.851 --> 01:26:54.720
called,
I seem to be a verb,
incredibly,

1475
01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:56.370
incredibly limited production.

1476
01:26:56.970 --> 01:26:59.130
You have to buy advantage if you're going to find it.

1477
01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:03.360
I regret even saying it out loud now because there are so few copies out there.

1478
01:27:03.361 --> 01:27:05.670
They'll be hoovered up by your audience.
They're gone.

1479
01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:10.380
But that book and it's special.
It's actually,
it's beautiful inside.

1480
01:27:10.381 --> 01:27:12.660
It's not like his other books,
which are just long,
long texts.

1481
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:19.870
It's graphic lettering and photographs and you read it through on the top half

1482
01:27:21.151 --> 01:27:23.610
first and then you flip the book upside down and you read it through on the

1483
01:27:23.611 --> 01:27:27.840
bottom half and the other direction it's super compelling are some great

1484
01:27:27.841 --> 01:27:31.020
thoughts in there and it'll cost you,
I mean,
I don't know what your mark,

1485
01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:34.050
what your viewers are going to do to the market,
but it's under a hundred bucks,

1486
01:27:34.051 --> 01:27:36.710
but it's incredibly special.
Very,
very treasured.

1487
01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:41.230
<v 1>Awesome.
Yeah.
Those,
those will disappear pretty quickly.</v>

1488
01:27:41.231 --> 01:27:42.860
So get them while they're hot,
I guess.
Uh,

1489
01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:49.200
any last pieces of advice or recommendations to leave with the would be

1490
01:27:49.751 --> 01:27:51.160
entrepreneurs who are listening to this,

1491
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:55.180
people who were thinking about starting a company of some type.

1492
01:27:55.181 --> 01:27:56.440
I think that that's their path.

1493
01:27:56.470 --> 01:28:01.470
Maybe they're just a shitty employee like I was a and m are out there hoping to

1494
01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:07.360
have a headstart in somewhere in advantage with what,
uh,

1495
01:28:07.390 --> 01:28:08.980
what advice or recommendations would you make?

1496
01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:13.810
<v 4>My first recommendation is be honest with yourself.</v>

1497
01:28:13.811 --> 01:28:15.310
Most people aren't that person.

1498
01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:18.760
And I think we are an environment right now where there's so much venture

1499
01:28:18.761 --> 01:28:21.260
capital and the industry,
you know,

1500
01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:23.530
the tech industry has been shown to be so cool,

1501
01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:29.640
great perks and a great fast pass to path the wealth that it's very attractive

1502
01:28:31.001 --> 01:28:35.260
right now to posers.
And I think most people aren't cut out to be founders.

1503
01:28:35.290 --> 01:28:36.340
Most people aren't.

1504
01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:41.530
The entrepreneurs will have that ultimate success and it's polluted our

1505
01:28:41.531 --> 01:28:42.570
industry.
You know,

1506
01:28:42.820 --> 01:28:47.820
we have way too many shitty companies that are pulling all the great talent away

1507
01:28:48.161 --> 01:28:50.950
from inevitably great companies.

1508
01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:56.110
We have way too many people wasting time on competitive ventures that have no

1509
01:28:56.111 --> 01:29:00.460
hope whatsoever.
And so I think you have to be really,
really honest.

1510
01:29:00.461 --> 01:29:03.390
Are you a founder or are you an employee?

1511
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:08.280
And one of those things that we touched on earlier is that inevitability of

1512
01:29:08.281 --> 01:29:09.400
success,
if you are,

1513
01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:15.390
people ask me what went through my head when I lost,
uh,

1514
01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:19.080
$12 million in the matter of a week.

1515
01:29:19.170 --> 01:29:21.420
And that was another $4 million on top of that,

1516
01:29:21.421 --> 01:29:25.620
just a really highly levered public market by which went upside down in a crash.

1517
01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:29.580
Uh,
and then $4 million more from their leaving me deep,
deep in the hole.

1518
01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:33.510
And people ask like,
were you sad?
Were you,
and I just,

1519
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:38.520
my brain works in a way where I wasn't sad,
I was pissed.
It was a bummer,

1520
01:29:38.970 --> 01:29:41.820
but I just knew I would always make that money back and get back into a good

1521
01:29:41.821 --> 01:29:43.440
spot again.
It was just going to take longer.

1522
01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:48.420
I just knew that I would never be the guy who just lived out and declared

1523
01:29:48.421 --> 01:29:50.490
bankruptcy and living in the hold up the whole time.

1524
01:29:50.491 --> 01:29:54.210
I just knew I would make back the millions of dollars and then go from there.
Uh,

1525
01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.060
when I went out and branched off and started my own firm,

1526
01:29:57.870 --> 01:30:00.450
I spent money to do the documents that are big,

1527
01:30:00.451 --> 01:30:02.910
big firm would do right off the bat.
And even though my other,

1528
01:30:02.911 --> 01:30:05.010
it's like we don't really need to do this.
It's small firms notes,

1529
01:30:05.110 --> 01:30:09.120
well this is going to be a huge thing.
So I want to do that now.

1530
01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:13.830
When I set out to raise $1 billion in the fall of,

1531
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:18.720
of 2010,
that was absurd.
I didn't even have office space.

1532
01:30:18.930 --> 01:30:21.430
I had one other employee at the time who managed our,

1533
01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:27.000
our back office from a winery and Healdsburg.
Um,

1534
01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:29.730
and so I had no business raising that money.

1535
01:30:29.731 --> 01:30:33.260
I work cowboy shirts the whole time and uh,

1536
01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:35.880
rarely left Truckee California to do at,

1537
01:30:35.881 --> 01:30:38.460
asked everyone to fly their fancy jets into trucking and get it done at the

1538
01:30:38.461 --> 01:30:41.550
greasy spoon.
And so there's just a,

1539
01:30:41.790 --> 01:30:44.520
I just knew there was an inevitability at this thing was going to work out and

1540
01:30:44.521 --> 01:30:49.290
then I wouldn't fail at it.
If you're not the kind of person to think that way.

1541
01:30:49.291 --> 01:30:53.580
If you really don't have that gene where you know what it's going to work out.

1542
01:30:54.330 --> 01:30:57.870
No,
you don't hope,
you know,
then you shouldn't be a founder.

1543
01:30:58.230 --> 01:31:02.130
So I hope that doesn't depress anybody,
but hopefully I'm saving a bunch of pain.

1544
01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:07.900
<v 1>There are also many paths to amassing incredible fortunes.</v>

1545
01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:13.680
Being a founder is actually a pretty thin slice of that pie and a very high risk

1546
01:31:15.130 --> 01:31:18.100
sort of binary way to approach things.
What is the,

1547
01:31:18.130 --> 01:31:20.830
what is the movie that you can quote from most readily?

1548
01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:24.630
<v 4>The Big Lebowski?
I mean,
you,</v>

1549
01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:27.740
you start with the opening scene with Sam and I can read,

1550
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:31.880
I can recite the whole thing.
I go to Lebowski fest every year.
I,
uh,

1551
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:34.160
my,
my division at,

1552
01:31:34.670 --> 01:31:38.210
at a Google was secret and we working on secret stuff that now you're starting

1553
01:31:38.211 --> 01:31:40.910
to see kind of all the spectrum and wireless system stuff they did.

1554
01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.430
We actually launched the first weather balloons,
you know,

1555
01:31:43.431 --> 01:31:47.180
Cassie went on to build loon and stuff like that.
We'd dug the fiber,
et cetera.

1556
01:31:47.181 --> 01:31:51.350
But that whole division was called project Lebowski.
And if you,

1557
01:31:52.130 --> 01:31:54.740
anytime we launched something or achieving a milestone,

1558
01:31:54.741 --> 01:31:59.380
everyone got achiever shirts.
It's a,
you know,
a little blocky urban achievers,

1559
01:31:59.410 --> 01:32:02.080
inner city children of promise without the necessary means.

1560
01:32:02.130 --> 01:32:04.630
Fourth necessarily means for higher education.
Uh,

1561
01:32:05.050 --> 01:32:09.310
so Phillip Seymour Hoffman recipes.
So yeah,
that was a,

1562
01:32:09.490 --> 01:32:10.840
that's a pretty important movie for me.

1563
01:32:11.450 --> 01:32:14.270
<v 1>Awesome.
Where can people find you on the Internet?</v>

1564
01:32:14.330 --> 01:32:16.310
I'll give one more book recommendations since the,

1565
01:32:16.311 --> 01:32:20.650
the Bucky book is probably an advantage.
The magic of thinking big,
I think,
uh,
is,

1566
01:32:20.730 --> 01:32:24.350
is one that I found very helpful.
Other people might as well,
but on the,

1567
01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:25.210
on the net

1568
01:32:25.210 --> 01:32:28.540
<v 4>book recommendations right now.
Sure.
You know,
one of my favorite,
favorite books,</v>

1569
01:32:28.570 --> 01:32:30.490
what's,
uh,
uh,
is,
uh,

1570
01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:34.990
the essential scratch and sniff guide to becoming a wine expert is a fantastic

1571
01:32:34.991 --> 01:32:39.070
author by my fabulous wife.
It literally,
you know,
the master smile,

1572
01:32:39.071 --> 01:32:42.730
a Richard Bets.
Uh,
there's incredible knowledge in that book.

1573
01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:47.160
So my wife and Wendy McNaughton nail straight are combined to make a a

1574
01:32:47.230 --> 01:32:49.360
children's book for adults.
It'll will teach you how to drink wine.

1575
01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.520
That's indispensable for any aspiring honors.

1576
01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:52.430
<v 1>The North,
Super Fun.</v>

1577
01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:55.220
I might have to have bets on at some point to talk about hacking the master

1578
01:32:55.221 --> 01:32:58.310
Somme test.
He's,
that's exactly what he does.

1579
01:32:58.311 --> 01:33:00.910
He teaches people how to take that test long lunch and talked about it.

1580
01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:05.150
He's a fascinating dude.
So the the web,
the ever expanding web of Soka.

1581
01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:07.900
<v 4>So where am I?
I'm at Sacca on Twitter.</v>

1582
01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:10.330
I just don't use the Instagram's very much anymore.

1583
01:33:10.810 --> 01:33:13.360
I'm also add sack on periscope and that I've been using a lot.

1584
01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:15.940
I think periscope changes everything.
Cool,
man.

1585
01:33:15.941 --> 01:33:17.020
Speaking about changing everything,

1586
01:33:17.190 --> 01:33:19.870
I think it's a disco nights we've got to get running.
That's right.
That's right.

1587
01:33:20.410 --> 01:33:22.450
All right.
Thanks brother.
Always fun.
Thanks Sam.

<v 1>This episode is brought to you by 99 designs your one stop shop for all things</v>

1589
01:33:31.901 --> 01:33:33.460
graphic design related.

1590
01:33:33.490 --> 01:33:38.470
I've used 99 designs for everything from banner ads to book covers,

1591
01:33:38.471 --> 01:33:42.190
including sketches and mock ups that led to the four hour body,

1592
01:33:42.191 --> 01:33:46.150
which later became number one New York Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

1593
01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:49.390
the brainstorming and a lot of it took place with designers from around the

1594
01:33:49.391 --> 01:33:53.590
world.
And here's how it works.
Whether you need a t shirt,
a business card,

1595
01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:57.100
a website,
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

1596
01:33:57.310 --> 01:34:00.850
you submit that project and designers from around the world,

1597
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:03.490
we'll send you sketches and mock ups and designs.

1598
01:34:03.730 --> 01:34:07.180
You choose your favorite and you have an original that you love or you get your

1599
01:34:07.181 --> 01:34:08.860
money back.
It's that straightforward.

1600
01:34:09.190 --> 01:34:12.580
And many of you who are listening have already used it and created some amazing

1601
01:34:12.581 --> 01:34:14.950
things that I'll be sharing it in the future.
But in the meantime,

1602
01:34:14.951 --> 01:34:16.720
if you want to see some of my competitions,

1603

1605
01:34:23.770 --> 01:34:26.890
that's [inaudible] 99 designs.com forward slash.
Tim,

1606
01:34:31.570 --> 01:34:34.630
this episode is brought to you by a new sponsor,
so listen up folks.

1607
01:34:34.631 --> 01:34:38.590
This is a good one because have you ever want it to be as powerful as a bullet

1608
01:34:38.591 --> 01:34:43.591
wearing Ninja from an 1980s movie or as flamboyant as big gay Al Big Al in south

1609
01:34:45.041 --> 01:34:49.110
park or as sleek as a black panther in the Amazon on the hunt wealth,

1610
01:34:49.111 --> 01:34:49.831
there's great man's,

1611
01:34:49.831 --> 01:34:53.890
because I've been testing this product that you wrap around your genitals and it

1612
01:34:53.891 --> 01:34:56.830
makes you feel like a superhero and it is called beyond.

1613
01:34:57.410 --> 01:35:00.980
I've spent the last two to three weeks traveling with underwear from these guys

1614
01:35:00.981 --> 01:35:03.290
and they are comfy.
I got to tell you,

1615
01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:07.910
it feels like a Geisha has giving your groin a hug and it's not just for dudes,

1616
01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:11.000
but if you go to meet [inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim,

1617
01:35:11.001 --> 01:35:14.630
that's m e e u n D I e s.com forward slash Tim,

1618
01:35:14.631 --> 01:35:17.450
you can see all of the underwear that I've been wearing.

1619
01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:22.370
There's some pretty ridiculous ones and I will also highlight my favorite.

1620
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:23.930
You'll probably be able to guess which it is.

1621
01:35:24.650 --> 01:35:26.600
These underwear made from micro Medallia,

1622
01:35:26.601 --> 01:35:30.950
which is extruded from Austria and beechwood trees in the Alps.
Yes,
fancy.

1623
01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:32.720
And it's two times softer than cotton,

1624
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:37.100
scientifically tested using the collar bottom method developed in Kyoto.

1625
01:35:37.190 --> 01:35:41.810
You know,
those Japanese very crafty.
And uh,
I will say a few things.
Number one,

1626
01:35:41.811 --> 01:35:44.180
if you go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim,

1627
01:35:44.330 --> 01:35:47.720
you get to see all of these spectacular underwear that I've been wearing and I

1628
01:35:47.721 --> 01:35:52.040
am a bit of an underwear connoisseur,
socks,
fashion sense with sweatpants,

1629
01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:54.920
not so much underwear.
I understand.
So check them out.

1630
01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:58.400
And if you go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash [inaudible] you will also be

1631
01:35:58.401 --> 01:36:03.200
able to see lots of hot ladies wearing at me undies,
female underwear.

1632
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:07.070
And that's just a lot of goodness for both the men and the women out there.

1633
01:36:07.071 --> 01:36:10.070
So check it out.
[inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim,

1634
01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:12.140
I love these underwear and a,

1635
01:36:12.141 --> 01:36:16.520
I'm going to be packing tonight probably six to 12 pair to take with me to

1636
01:36:16.521 --> 01:36:20.540
Australia.
They're great.
Check em out.
[inaudible] dot com forward slash.
Tim.

1637
01:36:20.930 --> 01:36:23.120
And until next time,
thank you for listening.

1638
01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:34.103
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1639
01:36:52.570 --> 01:36:55.500
Yeah.
Okay.
