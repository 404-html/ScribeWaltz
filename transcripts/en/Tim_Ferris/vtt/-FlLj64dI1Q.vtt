00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.850
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:07.060
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking it.

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.500
I'm a cybernetic organism living this yoga.

4
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.010
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by varidesk and it actually standing at my own</v>

5
00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:28.660
varidesk right now recording this,

6
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.260
you've probably heard of research that shows how sitting all day is terrible for

7
00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:34.870
your health.
Sitting is the new smoking,
et Cetera,

8
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.180
but standing all day isn't necessarily the answer for everyone.

9
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.970
Sometimes you just want to sit down and that's true for me as well.

10
00:00:42.971 --> 00:00:45.730
The middle ground is varidesk,
varidesks height,

11
00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:50.110
adjustable standing desk solutions allow you to stand when you want to sit,

12
00:00:50.111 --> 00:00:54.040
when you need to,
and as an example,
I had this set to the lower position.

13
00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:58.450
This is a large model and it took me clickety clack two seconds to raise this

14
00:00:58.451 --> 00:01:01.660
thing up and it feels like it has hydraulics effectively because they didn't

15
00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:05.380
have to use any muscle to do at varidesk converts your existing desk.

16
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.560
For instance,
if you want to get a tabletop version,
which you can put on it,

17
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.101
which is very,

18
00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:13.810
very cool or cubicle into a sit stand workstation and allows you to raise your

19
00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:16.390
desk from a seated to standing position in just seconds,

20
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.930
ships fully assembled so there's no Allen wrenches screwdrivers required,

21
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.740
pull it out of the box,
put it on your desk.
In the case of this particular model,

22
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.280
no installation or fascinating required,
there are bunch of different options.

23
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.970
Model,

24
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.860
start at just $175 so check out [inaudible] dot com to see what model might be

25
00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:36.940
the right fit for you.
And my assistant now has one,
I have one.

26
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.010
We've really,
really been very happy with it.

27
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.930
So if you're not sure if it's right for you,

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.220
this episode is brought to you by Wealthfront.

33
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.740
Wealthfront is the future of financial advice.

34
00:02:02.741 --> 00:02:07.150
They become incredibly popular among my friends in silicon valley and across the

35
00:02:07.151 --> 00:02:11.290
country because they provide the same high end financial advice that the best

36
00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:13.600
private wealth managers deliver it to the ultra wealthy,

37
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.950
but for any account size and at a fraction of the cost.
For instance,

38
00:02:17.951 --> 00:02:21.730
they monitor your portfolio every day across more than a dozen asset classes to

39
00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:25.960
look for opportunities to rebalance or harvest tax losses.
Now,

40
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.480
would you do the same?
Are you doing the same?
Probably not.

41
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.010
And the powers and the software wealth front now manages more than $4 billion in

42
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:37.920
assets,
which is up from around 2.5 billion.

43
00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:39.630
When they started advertising on this podcast,

44
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.100
they're growing incredibly quickly.
Unlike old fashioned private wealth managers.

45
00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:46.440
Wealth front is powered by innovative technology,

46
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.180
making it the most tax efficient,
low cost,
hassle free way to invest.

47
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.900
They don't have bloated sales teams or retail locations so they can deliver all

48
00:02:55.901 --> 00:03:00.040
of this sophisticated financial advice and the services at fraction of the cost

49
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.010
of a traditional financial advisor.

They use investment theory to automate good financial behavior and decisions

58
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:27.700

Hello boys and girls.

63
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:45.280
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

64
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:48.040
it is my job to dig around,

65
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.130
find world class performers of all sorts of stripes and breeds and species and

66
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.220
deconstruct what they do.
How do they make decisions?

67
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.070
What do they do first thing in the morning?
What are the habits,
routines,

68
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:01.750
details that you can apply to your life?

69
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.230
And this particular episode was very much an in demand requested episode and the

70
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:14.251
guest is Mr. Money mustache at Mr. Money mustache,

71
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.960
Pete aid knee in real life.

72
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.460
He grew up in Canada in a family of mostly eccentric musicians,

73
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.200
then graduated from computer engineering in the 1990s and worked in various tech

74
00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:31.201
companies before retiring at age 30 peed his wife and they're now 11 year old

75
00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:33.480
son live near Boulder,

76
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.490
Colorado and they've not had real jobs since 2005 this begs the question of

77
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:40.930
course,
how,
how did they do that?

78
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.740
They accomplished this early retirement by doing a number of things,

79
00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:49.690
but in effect optimizing all aspects of their lifestyle for maximal fund at

80
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:50.830
minimal expense.

81
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.600
And by using basic index fund investing,

82
00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.170
their annual expenses on average total a mere 25,000 to $27,000 and they do not

83
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:05.350
feel in want of anything.
So again,

84
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.550
since 2005 all three of them have explored a freeform life of interesting

85
00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:14.230
projects,
side businesses and adventures.
In 2011,

86
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.060
Pete started writing the Mr Money Mustache blog about his philosophy,

87
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.860
which has grown to reach about 23 million different people and 300 million page

88
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:26.770
views since its inception.
Since its founding,

89
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.960
it has become a worldwide cult phenomenon with a self organizing community and

90
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:34.900
incredible news coverage.
This episode explores his story,

91
00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:37.990
philosophies and routine.
So without further ado,

92
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:42.991
please enjoy my conversation with the one and only Mr. Money Mustache Pete

93
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.530
[inaudible].
Pete,
welcome to the show.

94
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.300
Thanks Tim.
Edson arms to be on here and you are,

95
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.250
I would say in the top five most requested guests for this podcast

96
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.740
<v 2>that,
uh,
that,
that I see on the Internet and beyond.</v>

97
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:04.430
I had somebody come up to me recently in New York City of all places.
He said,

98
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:07.850
you know,
you should have on the podcast and it was you.
And so I'm

99
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.860
really excited to dig into all sorts of stories and conversations and

100
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:17.861
discussions because I'm thinking through many areas of my life in which I think

101
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:21.260
you are an expert or have certainly spent more time ruminating on these things.

102
00:06:21.261 --> 00:06:26.261
But I thought we could start with your experience getting groceries.

103
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.410
Could you describe for people what your experience looks like getting groceries?

104
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.020
Uh,
well it's kind of varied,
but I feel strongly about groceries.
So in an ideal,

105
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:41.300
like a Utopian Grocery Day,

106
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:46.301
I would throw my bike trailer onto the back of my single speed bike and roll

107
00:06:46.601 --> 00:06:50.780
down to like the local kind of hippie natural grocery store,

108
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:55.220
and then just load up with like 150 bucks of awesome stuff and then pedal it

109
00:06:55.221 --> 00:07:00.170
back up the hill and then unload it and then have people show up and the giant

110
00:07:00.171 --> 00:07:03.020
barbecue that night and a feast.

111
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.890
So if that's the utopia,
what does the,

112
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.940
what does the compromised utopia look like?
Well,

113
00:07:10.941 --> 00:07:12.350
it's usually pretty close to that,

114
00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:16.050
but sometimes people don't come over or sometimes,
uh,

115
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.740
there's some reason I have to use the car and maybe I'm taking,

116
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.980
taking it past the grocery store so our Russian and get some stuff.

117
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.550
But I think the,
you know,
the thrust of the question is like,

118
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.660
does this guy really uh,
get groceries about bicycle?
And it's definitely true.

119
00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:32.330
I'd kind of do everything by bike here in Longmont,

120
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.010
Colorado or like at least 99% of my trips,
uh,

121
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.910
away from the house here are human powered.

122
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:41.210
And that's just the way I've figured out.
Makes me happiest to live

123
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:47.450
at this point in time.
You have a household of three,
is that right?
Yeah,

124
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:52.220
that's true.
One boy,
one boy,
one girl and got it.
All right.
And,

125
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.540
and what,
uh,
what is the cause I think this is,
this is a,

126
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.760
this is going to be a core piece of the discussion.

127
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.110
What are your average annual family expenses at this point would you say?

128
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.760
All right,
well we've been adding this up ever since I started writing a blog.

129
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:09.290
We never really added it up before,

130
00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:14.291
but it always comes out around 25 to $27,000 of annual expenditures,

131
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.920
uh,
with the notable exception that we don't have any kind of mortgage or debt or

132
00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:22.850
anything.
So that's all on purely stuff that we want to buy.

133
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.290
And maybe we'll,
we'll,

134
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.040
this is going to be memento style in terms of chronology is a lot of my

135
00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:34.760
conversations are as just a quirk of my brain that I'm trying to a bug.

136
00:08:34.761 --> 00:08:36.770
I'm trying to turn,
turn into a feature of this podcast.

137
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:44.770
What was the blog post or the day that you realize Mr money mustache had a cult

138
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:50.714
like following?

139
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:56.240
Was there a nice use that I use that in a complimentary way,
by the way.
Uh,
you

140
00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.270
<v 1>have some of the most die hard fans I've ever encountered.
A,</v>

141
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:05.271
was there a particular peace or moment when you realized how strongly and have

142
00:09:07.091 --> 00:09:08.710
devoted your fan base was?

143
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.000
<v 2>I think it's Kinda been like one of those frog in hot water situations where it</v>

144
00:09:13.001 --> 00:09:16.450
just gradually happens.
And then occasionally,

145
00:09:16.451 --> 00:09:20.020
especially when my friends stopping on Elica money mustache event,
they're like,

146
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.420
dude,
you're a cult leader.
Did you realize that?

147
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.510
But it didn't really happen any specific time.

148
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:29.890
I would say the first time I was really surprised by the effects of blogging

149
00:09:29.891 --> 00:09:34.891
with when I had a guest post on this awesome previous a blog called early

150
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:38.440
retirement extreme and a whole bunch of this,
uh,

151
00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.730
Jacob bloggers fans came over to mine,

152
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.280
I blog and just flooded it and just crawled and read every single article and

153
00:09:45.281 --> 00:09:47.530
started putting it on these comments.
And then I,

154
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.010
it was really a rewarding thing and I just kept going from there.

155
00:09:51.011 --> 00:09:53.990
It's sort of a self motivating thing.
Um,

156
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.850
and then the other incident was probably we had a party once,

157
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.060
a blog related meetup in the,
in Ottawa,
Canada,

158
00:10:00.061 --> 00:10:03.460
which is kind of one of my homeland hometowns.
And uh,

159
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.430
all these people came and like 200 people.

160
00:10:05.431 --> 00:10:10.431
And it overflowed into the backyard of this like unweighting hosts place.

161
00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:13.410
And a,
it was a little weird cause I didn't even get to meet anybody.

162
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.590
And that was the first time I became uncomfortable with like,
oh,

163
00:10:16.591 --> 00:10:20.010
well I didn't want to be one of those people where you don't even meet everybody

164
00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:20.600
who wants.

165
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.870
<v 1>Nice to meet you.
Ottawa,</v>

166
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.820
I've actually spent a decent amount of time in Ottawa,
uh,
and of,

167
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.720
and I had a beaver tail for the first time while ice skating or planning on ice

168
00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:37.650
skating in Ottawa due to start up there.
Well,

169
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.070
it's a quite a large company now called Shopify.

170
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.440
<v 2>Oh yeah,
I knew that.
Yeah.
And the beaver tail,</v>

171
00:10:42.441 --> 00:10:44.690
that's the right way to do Ottawa is skating.
And

172
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:49.450
<v 1>you were tales.
I know beaver tail is,
I don't even remember exactly what it is,</v>

173
00:10:49.451 --> 00:10:52.390
but it's a pastry,
right?
I mean,
it's a,
what is it exactly?

174
00:10:52.391 --> 00:10:55.910
It's like a chocolate covered pastry.
Uh,

175
00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:57.910
and for those people who have not been to Ottawa,
you can,

176
00:10:57.911 --> 00:11:02.680
you can skate for hours.
I mean,
it's this,
this gigantic,
uh,
they,

177
00:11:02.681 --> 00:11:06.190
I guess they lower the water level or maybe they're raised the water level so

178
00:11:06.191 --> 00:11:09.540
that you can skate effectively around the entire city,
if I,

179
00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:14.130
from remembering correctly.
Yeah,
that's right.
And it's pretty awesome.
The uh,

180
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.290
okay.
The,
but to get back to the blog,
what,

181
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.730
what do you think has,

182
00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:24.630
what are the aspects of your philosophy or your writing or your persona that

183
00:11:24.631 --> 00:11:25.600
have struck such a chord?

184
00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.040
<v 2>Well,
it's funny you should ask that because the first time I ever did a talk,</v>

185
00:11:30.041 --> 00:11:34.750
like a big public talk,
it was a to a conference of bloggers.
It's called fin con.

186
00:11:34.751 --> 00:11:37.890
And I just stopped by it because it was in Denver.
And,
uh,

187
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.660
I had realized that this blog was kind of behaving like a cult.

188
00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:44.260
And then I looked up like,
what are the properties of a cult?

189
00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:48.100
And then I read some articles and maybe a book or two on cults and I realized,

190
00:11:48.101 --> 00:11:53.010
man,
I've accidentally done it.
And uh,
and just because that's my idea of a sense.

191
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.350
Humor is a,
so it turns out if you want to start a cult,

192
00:11:56.351 --> 00:11:57.940
you need to just have a few key elements,

193
00:11:57.941 --> 00:12:02.830
like a recognizable leader need to have a sense of us versus them.

194
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:03.791
You know,
like,
oh,

195
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:06.820
we're an oppressed people and the rest of the world doesn't understand us.

196
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.840
And a couple other things that helps to feel like you're a virtuous and have

197
00:12:10.841 --> 00:12:14.500
some kind of like good changing the world and the rest of the world needs your

198
00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:17.980
help.
And uh,
yeah.
So if you look at all the cults,

199
00:12:17.981 --> 00:12:22.060
including informal ones like star trek or a apple,

200
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:26.290
there's always these same kind of characteristics and I accidentally emulated

201
00:12:26.291 --> 00:12:30.340
those and in retrospect realized,
Hey,
well I guess that was a pretty good idea.

202
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.230
So for those who are part of the US,
in your case,
what is,

203
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:39.670
what's the belief system?
What are the tenets?
Right?

204
00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:43.080
So the belief system,
which I jokingly call Mustachio aneurysm,

205
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.180
it's kind of like a lifestyle and a fake religion.
And the beliefs are that the,

206
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.110
you know,
sort of the unit,
the United States,

207
00:12:50.111 --> 00:12:55.111
especially as the ground zero of this consumer insanity that has overtaken all

208
00:12:55.781 --> 00:12:59.740
of our minds and it's just causing people to behave in an irrational way and

209
00:12:59.741 --> 00:13:04.150
sort of sabotage their own ability to have a good life,
for example.

210
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.840
They work way more years than they have to because they're consuming a lot more

211
00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:12.340
crap than they have to without actually getting any life benefit about it over.

212
00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:14.910
And then the same thing applies to the health,
their health and their,

213
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.530
their sanity and their mental mental health there.

214
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:22.390
Everyone's very inefficiently going about their lives.
So the correction,
uh,

215
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.990
through mustache as him as just being a bit more thoughtful about this stuff and

216
00:13:25.991 --> 00:13:29.590
seeking efficiency in the way that you spend your money and make sure that you

217
00:13:29.591 --> 00:13:34.450
get fun out of it.
Each time that you spend something and,
uh,
applying this,

218
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:39.451
you just end up a lot healthier and wealthier and able to retire from mandatory

219
00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:42.700
work at a much earlier age in your life,

220
00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:47.380
which a lot of people are drawn in by the prospect of an extra four decades of

221
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.620
freedom that they wouldn't have otherwise gotten.
Correct me if I'm wrong here,

222
00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:55.120
be you retired effectively at age 30,
is that right?
Right.
Yeah.

223
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:58.330
This is perfect.
Reverse chronology,
just like you've planned it.
So,
yeah,

224
00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:03.420
now we're back to the year 2005 and after working about a 10 year career in

225
00:14:04.601 --> 00:14:07.120
software engineering,
my girlfriend,

226
00:14:07.121 --> 00:14:11.740
who's now my wife and I determined that we had enough money saved up to live off

227
00:14:11.741 --> 00:14:13.360
the investment returns forever.

228
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:18.820
So we just quit our regular cubicle jobs and just in time to have our baby boy

229
00:14:18.821 --> 00:14:21.940
at the time.
And that was of course about 11 years ago,

230
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.600
and we didn't even know this was a weird thing to do.
We thought,
oh yeah,

231
00:14:25.601 --> 00:14:27.730
well of course,
you know,
when you get paid as much as we do,

232
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.670
like it only takes so long until you don't need to work anymore.

233
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.870
And it was only after several years of retirement that we noticed that we were

234
00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:37.200
kind of odd balls and everybody else,
uh,

235
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:39.520
who earn the same amount of money was still broke,

236
00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:46.280
broken in probably more way than one.
Uh,
in,

237
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.320
uh,
want to dig into some of the,
the numbers related to this.

238
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.130
So as a discussion

239
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.910
<v 1>point,
one of the,
one of the things you,
you had sent over,</v>

240
00:14:55.911 --> 00:15:00.170
and I always ask guests for potential prompt for for four topics,

241
00:15:00.171 --> 00:15:02.240
it could be fun to explore and one of them was you only need,

242
00:15:02.241 --> 00:15:05.840
you accumulate 25 times your annual spending to retire forever.

243
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:11.210
Could you elaborate on that and how,
uh,
how you arrived at that number?

244
00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:14.870
Because I think this is,
this is a useful exercise for people to hear.

245
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.740
<v 2>Yeah.
This is a core piece of math is very,
uh,</v>

246
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:22.130
it's widely known if you're a financial independence enthusiast,

247
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.610
but it's almost a completely secret to most of the,

248
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.750
of the rich world's population.
So if you have a,

249
00:15:29.751 --> 00:15:32.690
if you have a handle on your annual spending and you know how much you need to

250
00:15:32.691 --> 00:15:37.670
live on,
all you need to do is save up 25 times that amount.
And on the very,

251
00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:41.550
very conservative side,
let's say 28 times that amount,
uh,

252
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.840
in conservative investments,
like a giant vanguard index fund.

253
00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:50.160
And that's enough to fund you with passive income with a high degree of safety

254
00:15:50.161 --> 00:15:54.020
for the rest of your life.
So if you have a,
to just keep the numbers simple,

255
00:15:54.021 --> 00:15:58.470
if you need to $30,000 to live on,
multiply that by 25.
And I don't know,

256
00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.920
I'm giving myself a tricky math question.
I think,
you know,

257
00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:05.921
it's like $750,000 you'd need saved up or something like that to quit forever.

258
00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:10.400
And that's a lot less than most people think.
Most people,

259
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.670
at least in my age group,
they're shooting for the tens of millions,
uh,

260
00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.770
type of range.
If they,

261
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.400
if they were to ever quit work early and they haven't really done the math on

262
00:16:19.401 --> 00:16:20.750
how easy it really is.

263
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:23.011
<v 1>And what,</v>

264
00:16:23.011 --> 00:16:27.570
are there any assumptions embedded in that in terms of percentage,

265
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.490
annual yield and so on?
What are,
what are the,
uh,

266
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:34.040
whether historically based or otherwise,
what are,
what are the,

267
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.380
are there any other assumptions embedded in that?

268
00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:38.100
<v 2>It is,
yeah,
there's um,</v>

269
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:42.290
it's kind of based on a really long term study of the stock market dating back

270
00:16:42.291 --> 00:16:45.620
to the 1920s or something like that.
Or maybe even earlier.

271
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:49.960
And the idea is it goes up some years,
it goes down.

272
00:16:49.961 --> 00:16:52.210
Some years consistently pays dividends

273
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:57.550
and in the worst case scenario,
you want to still not run out of money.

274
00:16:57.551 --> 00:16:59.560
So that's where the 4% comes from.

275
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.640
We've gotten you through a lot of the worst case scenarios.

276
00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:08.010
There is some situations when you could have spent up to five or 7% of your

277
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.330
portfolio every year and still not run out if you would happen to retired just

278
00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:15.090
before a big stock market boom,
that went on for a long time.

279
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:18.260
But most people don't like taking a huge amount of risks.

280
00:17:18.261 --> 00:17:23.261
So the 4% or 3.5 if you want to be extra conservative with today's stock market

281
00:17:24.281 --> 00:17:27.630
valuations,
that's more of a safety net.

282
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.800
And it's really just a mental crutch because what I find is that when people

283
00:17:31.801 --> 00:17:34.560
retire early,
almost everybody,

284
00:17:34.561 --> 00:17:38.850
like over 95% of people still have a lot of interests and passions and then

285
00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.340
they're pretty good at making money if they managed to save up that much in the

286
00:17:42.341 --> 00:17:46.300
first place.
So they still make money in their retirement,

287
00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.980
they just have a lot more fun doing it.
And,
uh,

288
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:54.110
nest egg that's pumping out dividends and returns just adds extra confidence so

289
00:17:54.111 --> 00:17:56.290
they can,
they can have more fun in the process.

290
00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.171
<v 1>Well,
I've,</v>

291
00:17:57.171 --> 00:18:02.171
I've read two different definitions of retirement or maybe they're

292
00:18:02.301 --> 00:18:06.800
characteristics that are,
I think one was attributed to one was written by you,

293
00:18:06.801 --> 00:18:11.801
both of which I thought were very helpful as a orientation for thinking about

294
00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:15.520
the subject.
Andy.
The first is you know,

295
00:18:15.521 --> 00:18:18.160
retirement or financial independence simply means that you have your living

296
00:18:18.161 --> 00:18:21.130
expenses covered by non work income,
right?
Part One,

297
00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:25.580
part two is definition of a modern retirement,

298
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:30.510
the activities you pursue once you were done searching for money.
And,
and uh,

299
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.030
I think that's a very useful framework.

300
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:37.020
If in particular you're considering an early retirement,
uh,

301
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:41.550
at at say the age of 30,
40,
50,
whatever it might be.
Um,
the,

302
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.700
how do let's say,

303
00:18:44.701 --> 00:18:49.701
media not to cast aspersions on everyone who is part of the media since I

304
00:18:51.001 --> 00:18:53.100
suppose that's what I am right now at this moment.

305
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.410
But w you've been covered a fair amount.

306
00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.800
And I know like everyone who's been covered a fair amount,

307
00:19:00.801 --> 00:19:05.801
you get misquoted or people get the message wrong or they just take snack

308
00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.500
Starkey cheap shots.
Uh,
occasionally it doesn't happen all the time.

309
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.820
You've actually had some of the most complimentary profiles I've ever read.

310
00:19:12.821 --> 00:19:14.740
But where did they get it wrong?

311
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.620
Where do people get you your message,

312
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.550
your principles,
philosophies wrong?

313
00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:22.101
<v 2>Well,
the,</v>

314
00:19:22.101 --> 00:19:26.220
the misconceptions are sort of two different things from the media side.

315
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:27.930
<v 1>They often</v>

316
00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:32.500
<v 2>assume,
well,
I mean,
the ones that aren't complimentary,
they assume,
hey,</v>

317
00:19:32.501 --> 00:19:34.990
there's this crazy guy and he's just a lifestyle guru.

318
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:38.920
Just like another junior Tim Ferriss trying to get everybody excited about his

319
00:19:38.921 --> 00:19:43.740
crazy ideas and he's not really retired or,
or they say,
yeah,

320
00:19:43.741 --> 00:19:45.630
he,
he made so much money.

321
00:19:45.631 --> 00:19:48.930
But that doesn't apply to the regular person when they're,
you know,

322
00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:53.020
when they're trying to make it on like $50,000 a year salary or what about

323
00:19:53.021 --> 00:19:57.080
people with more kids?
So,
um,
the media don't understand that.

324
00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:02.260
They often assume some kind of extreme frugality that would be undesirable to

325
00:20:03.521 --> 00:20:06.820
live under.
And,
uh,
that's,
that's really inaccurate.

326
00:20:06.821 --> 00:20:11.821
And I worked pretty hard to fight it because I don't have my spending set up for

327
00:20:12.311 --> 00:20:13.031
the minimal level.

328
00:20:13.031 --> 00:20:17.340
I have it set up for the maximum amount that I can possibly spend and get value

329
00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:19.350
out of it,
you know,
cause it's easy to make money.

330
00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:24.140
So I set my spending at the maximum happiness level and then stopped spending

331
00:20:24.141 --> 00:20:26.760
when I stopped getting more happiness.
So that's the,

332
00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:31.830
that's really the fundamental mistake.
And then as for the non media world,

333
00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.560
there are a little bit more suspicious.

334
00:20:34.561 --> 00:20:37.770
Like they just think I'm make everything making everything up and I don't even,

335
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:42.250
you know,
I never did any of this stuff that I say I did in the first place.

336
00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:46.270
So then it's more of a conspiracy theory if you're reading like the comment

337
00:20:46.271 --> 00:20:48.040
section of which

338
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:48.873
<v 1>you should never do,</v>

339
00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:56.770
but you do have a it,
and I think this is why this is part of,

340
00:20:56.771 --> 00:20:58.540
there's no one to bring it up very early,

341
00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:01.690
a by most standards in the United States,

342
00:21:01.691 --> 00:21:06.220
a low household annual expense.
Right,
right.

343
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:10.600
And,
uh,
it might be helpful here to talk about because I,

344
00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.080
I asked during our sound check what you had for breakfast,

345
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.010
so could you repeat your answer please?
Oh yeah.
Well,
my,

346
00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:23.220
my breakfast was a fancy black espresso with milk and coconut,

347
00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.340
coconut oil phone into there too.
And then some dark chocolate,

348
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.540
like 90% dark chocolate and a,
some nuts,

349
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.380
almonds and cashews and stuff.
And uh,

350
00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:39.160
it's not exactly related to a low expenditure,
but it's indirectly related.

351
00:21:39.161 --> 00:21:41.080
I'm going to,
I'm going to come back to it.
What type of,

352
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:43.660
since I love the particulars.
What type of coffee,

353
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:46.840
what type of chocolate do you recall?
Oh yeah.
Well,

354
00:21:46.841 --> 00:21:51.841
right now my coffee coffee has some kind of organic fair trade thing,

355
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:54.280
but by in large quantity from Costco,

356
00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.700
which is obviously a lot cheaper than getting a,

357
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.570
like a Starbucks equivalent every morning.
And a,
yeah,

358
00:22:01.571 --> 00:22:05.280
the nuts are from Costco as well.
Now that you mentioned it,
this is the,
the,

359
00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:07.860
the reason I bring it up is that,
uh,

360
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:12.340
and I think stumbling on happiness or stumbling on happiness by Daniel Gilbert

361
00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.340
is,
is good exploration of this.

362
00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:19.480
Oftentimes what we think will make us happy does not make us happy.

363
00:22:19.481 --> 00:22:22.510
And we can talk,
we should dig into what happiness is for you,

364
00:22:22.511 --> 00:22:25.990
because I think it's,
it's,
it can be a dangerously nebulous term,

365
00:22:25.991 --> 00:22:28.900
but the point being that too,

366
00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:34.180
to have a functional car and then to have what society tells you is the optimal

367
00:22:34.181 --> 00:22:35.980
car.
Say some type of sports car,

368
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:42.130
there's a massive delta in price and you pay some severe penalties for that.

369
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:46.720
But to have a eight to go from a good chocolate to an excellent chocolate to

370
00:22:46.721 --> 00:22:47.980
world class chocolate,

371
00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:52.450
it might only be the difference of 10 or $12.
Right?

372
00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.111
And so there,

373
00:22:53.111 --> 00:22:58.111
there are there places where you can optimize without being obnoxiously or

374
00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:04.110
frugal or frugal in indis disabling extent and derive maximum pleasure.

375
00:23:04.211 --> 00:23:06.280
That's the point I was trying to make is that,

376
00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:12.620
and what I would love to hear from you is for those people out there who are

377
00:23:12.851 --> 00:23:16.000
spending far more multiples,
more than you are per year,

378
00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.560
who don't know where to start,

379
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:23.400
are there any easy optimizations that could have a dramatic impact on their

380
00:23:24.911 --> 00:23:27.910
ability to get closer to uh,

381
00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:32.320
optimizing for happiness as opposed to,
uh,

382
00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:37.530
succumbing to internal or external pressures to remain on this treadmill of,

383
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:40.600
of overconsumption.
Yeah,
right.

384
00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:43.390
And this might actually be a better answer for you earlier question too,

385
00:23:43.391 --> 00:23:46.010
because as a,
an engineer like I

386
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:50.720
<v 2>was kind of born part engineer at least.
And for me optimization is really,</v>

387
00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:52.220
really fun.
It's like beautiful.

388
00:23:52.221 --> 00:23:55.130
And when something is not optimized and when something's and efficient,

389
00:23:55.131 --> 00:23:59.510
I actually find it offensive and ugly.
So I had a lot of joy.

390
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:03.080
I get a lot of joy from looking at each of my life spending decisions and being

391
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.000
comparing it like,
okay,

392
00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:09.740
if I get this car I'd probably make me about this happy and this car would make

393
00:24:09.741 --> 00:24:12.740
me this mount happy.
Whereas if I ride my bike,
it does this other thing.

394
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.880
And you do,
you apply that to food and housing and transportation and clothing,

395
00:24:16.881 --> 00:24:18.710
travel,
exercise,

396
00:24:18.711 --> 00:24:22.490
and then all these categories can become super efficient where you end up

397
00:24:22.491 --> 00:24:25.100
getting incredible happiness out of them.
Uh,

398
00:24:25.101 --> 00:24:27.920
and the cost can sometimes be not only low,

399
00:24:27.921 --> 00:24:32.720
but sometimes you'll get paid for doing stuff that other people spend tens of

400
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.553
thousands of dollars to do.

401
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:36.260
So if you're a beginner at this sport of optimization,

402
00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:38.990
you can just start with the stuff that costs you a lot of money.

403
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:43.350
So my favorite one to be a bit repetitive is the car,
because a,

404
00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:48.410
the average middle income Americans spends like $12,000 per household,

405
00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:53.120
which is just on driving around in these like gas powered racing wheelchairs.

406
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.920
And that's more than they even invest in,
in their future.

407
00:24:57.921 --> 00:25:01.010
Like that's more than they're spending on the freedom.
So step one,

408
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:05.930
don't have a car that's worth more than about 10,000 bucks at the most.
Um,

409
00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:10.040
and last year at least like a single millionaire,
preferably multimillionaire,

410
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.580
because you can get a great,
perfectly great car.

411
00:25:13.581 --> 00:25:18.581
That'd be trouble free for 10 plus years for under $5,000 so the reasonable

412
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:23.300
ceiling would be 10 and that's already going to be a pretty giant thing for

413
00:25:23.301 --> 00:25:26.270
people.
And then number two is don't use that car a lot.

414
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.090
So everybody assumes that you know,

415
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:31.910
a short drive to work is anything under an hour.

416
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.400
Whereas I think I encourage people to take a really,

417
00:25:34.401 --> 00:25:38.810
really hard line approach on that because it's a giant factor in life,

418
00:25:38.811 --> 00:25:43.811
happiness and fitness and money in my rule is you should never get a job.

419
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:47.720
You know,
unless you're at gunpoint,
that requires you to drive to it.

420
00:25:47.721 --> 00:25:51.830
Like either find a new job,
find a place to live near that job.

421
00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:56.090
I mean even if it requires moving to a new city or a new country in the long
run,

422
00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.180
you just got to keep that nagging thing in your mind like,
okay,

423
00:25:59.181 --> 00:26:02.510
I drive to work now,
but this is not optimal in the long run.

424
00:26:02.511 --> 00:26:06.620
I will optimize a way car dependence and a,
yeah,

425
00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.750
just start with that one and then you can move on.

426
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.740
You can read stuff on my blog and figured out how to cut your grocery costs down

427
00:26:12.741 --> 00:26:14.720
and your housing and everything like that too.

428
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:18.290
But I really liked the mobility because there's fitness involved too,
you know,

429
00:26:18.291 --> 00:26:18.621
and there's,

430
00:26:18.621 --> 00:26:23.240
there's happiness of forcing yourself out into the fresh air every morning.

431
00:26:23.241 --> 00:26:25.820
As soon as you,
you give up the cage of the car.

432
00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:29.120
It's such a huge thing and it's such an overlooked thing in our country.

433
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:33.500
I deck couldn't agree more.
And I think the,
uh,
the,

434
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.160
it forces you to make other decisions like you pointed out.

435
00:26:37.161 --> 00:26:39.440
I haven't had a car for

436
00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:46.740
close to three,
I want to say.
Now,
that does not mean I don't spend time in cars.

437
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:49.110
I do,
uh,
so I,
I tend to use,

438
00:26:49.111 --> 00:26:52.680
whether it's a get around for trips to Tahoe or things that are further away

439
00:26:52.681 --> 00:26:56.370
that requires some travel or Uber,
but I probably walk,

440
00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:01.200
walk.
I tend to walk more than I bike,
um,
for whatever reason.
But that's,

441
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:06.350
that's typically I'd say 70 80% of my locomotion as soon as great walking.

442
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:08.180
And it's,

443
00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:12.720
it's helped me to make other decisions to optimize for say,

444
00:27:12.721 --> 00:27:16.560
having people come to me as opposed to having to constantly bounce around a city

445
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:21.030
or travel around the environments and think about how I can better use the

446
00:27:21.031 --> 00:27:24.030
capital.
I have four,
uh,

447
00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:30.170
types of leverage that don't require or replace the need for bouncing around

448
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:35.580
continuously and wasting that time and transit and also found from me at least

449
00:27:35.581 --> 00:27:39.270
very slow or very fast in terms of transportation work.
Well,

450
00:27:39.271 --> 00:27:43.470
it's in the middle that I get very frustrated because if it's very slow,

451
00:27:43.471 --> 00:27:47.550
I can also say batch phone calls,
I can listen to podcasts,
listen to audio books,

452
00:27:47.551 --> 00:27:49.650
I can take time,
uh,

453
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:54.360
for that type of enrichment in the process of moving from point a to point B.

454
00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:57.720
So true walking is so powerful and so underrated.

455
00:27:57.721 --> 00:27:59.610
Like your brain just goes into overdrive.

456
00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:03.810
All of your problems sort of start to solve themselves in the background.

457
00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.150
And for people who don't do it regularly,

458
00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:10.860
like an hour a day or walking to genuinely go somewhere,
um,

459
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:14.640
they just discount it because they haven't even experienced this incredible

460
00:28:14.641 --> 00:28:18.840
power.
So I'm glad we're both on that train.
I ran that shoe.

461
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.140
What are exactly,
what are,
uh,

462
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:27.060
what are some of the books that have,
and this could be two different lists,

463
00:28:27.061 --> 00:28:30.300
but some of the books that have had the biggest impact on you or books that you

464
00:28:30.301 --> 00:28:33.980
most frequently recommend to your readership.
Yeah,

465
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:37.320
I don't have the ultimate,
I'm not the ultimate book kind of sewer.

466
00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:42.690
I don't spend as much,
I don't burn through as many books as some people.
So,
uh,

467
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.280
but in recent months,

468
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:48.030
three books that have had a pretty big impact on me that I'm about to recommend

469
00:28:48.031 --> 00:28:51.150
to people,
it really depends on who you're talking to.

470
00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:55.120
So if you're into changing the world for the better,
um,

471
00:28:55.260 --> 00:29:00.240
one book that's spectacularly opened up my mind is this one called happy city by

472
00:29:00.241 --> 00:29:02.100
an author called Charles Montgomery.

473
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.030
And it kind of just pulls back the curtain on how we're wasting most of our

474
00:29:06.031 --> 00:29:11.031
resources and our human and money resources on building up the country into a

475
00:29:11.431 --> 00:29:14.250
spectacularly inefficient asphalt jungle.

476
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:17.890
So that's for urban planning nerds and fixing the world nerds.
Um,

477
00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:22.170
but for people who feel like they personally want to,

478
00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:26.460
um,
they're wondering why they're such a Weirdo.
I'm a big fan of,
uh,

479
00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.060
the book on Elon Musk by the author,
Ashlee Vance,

480
00:29:30.061 --> 00:29:31.230
I think it's called the Elon Musk,

481
00:29:31.231 --> 00:29:33.690
Elon Musk and that quest for a fantastic future.

482
00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:38.370
That book I read and it talks about Ilan as a little kid and growing up and it's

483
00:29:38.371 --> 00:29:43.090
like,
that's exactly how I was as a kid.
I thought I was the only one and it,

484
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.100
he has this feeling where the world is incredibly illogical and no one's

485
00:29:48.101 --> 00:29:50.830
listening and he just wants to just fucking change it.

486
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:55.000
Like I'm just going to do everything myself then and I can really everything

487
00:29:55.001 --> 00:29:57.400
except for the fact that he actually does it and I don't,

488
00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.820
I can relate completely to the feeling of that book.

489
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.100
And finally,
a really,

490
00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:08.101
really old fashioned book if someone just wants to wake themselves up and start

491
00:30:08.621 --> 00:30:11.470
turning into more of like a positive,
um,

492
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:16.480
less depressed person is this 1950s classic called the magic of thinking big.

493
00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:21.550
I've recommended that to like so many friends because I stumbled across it when

494
00:30:21.551 --> 00:30:25.430
I was like 15 years old and it was really,
really old even then.
And uh,

495
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:28.320
it's like this,
uh,
1950 is cheesy,

496
00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.710
stereotypical like man's world has some flaws in that way,

497
00:30:32.711 --> 00:30:36.390
but that just makes it more funny and it's a great way to just remind yourself

498
00:30:36.391 --> 00:30:40.510
like,
oh,
when you think big and act confident and sparkly,

499
00:30:40.511 --> 00:30:43.150
then it's amazing how much stuff actually goes better for you.

500
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:47.640
<v 1>So those are my three.
So I can't comment on the first two,
but I,</v>

501
00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:50.950
I have to comment on the magic of thinking big.

502
00:30:50.951 --> 00:30:53.040
So I have a copy,

503
00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:58.450
my original copy of the magic of thinking big about 15 feet to the side of me

504
00:30:58.451 --> 00:30:59.800
right now in my living room.

505
00:30:59.801 --> 00:31:03.660
It is one of the books that has traveled with me and its face out.

506
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:08.460
So I see it every day when I'm sitting on my couch along with a handful of

507
00:31:08.461 --> 00:31:11.460
others.
Tribe from Sebastian,
younger Dune,
Frank Herbert.

508
00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:14.160
That's a bit of a long story.
Gratitude,
Oliver Sacks.

509
00:31:14.161 --> 00:31:16.740
I'm looking at them right now.
Bird by bird,
by Anne Lamott,

510
00:31:16.741 --> 00:31:21.630
Zorba the Greek and less is more,
which is an anthology of writing on minimalism.

511
00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:27.200
And,
uh,
the magic of thinking big by David Schwartz.
This book,

512
00:31:27.201 --> 00:31:30.110
despite the title,
which like you said,
I mean it's,
it's,

513
00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.270
it's screams cheesy at you.

514
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:36.470
<v 2>It was why it's good though.
It is.
It's like gorgeously delightfully cheese.</v>

515
00:31:36.471 --> 00:31:41.060
And you're like,
yes,
I'm 1959 as well as you're conducting business.

516
00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.310
<v 1>No,
exactly.
And it was,</v>

517
00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:47.750
it was introduced to me by a man named Stephen [inaudible],
Stephen Key,

518
00:31:47.751 --> 00:31:51.770
fascinating guy.
He lives in,
I think it's Turlock,
California,
middle of nowhere,

519
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:56.480
and has built this,
this fantastic career for himself,

520
00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.220
developing products,

521
00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:02.520
a lot of toys and licensing them to gigantic companies,

522
00:32:02.521 --> 00:32:07.140
whether it's Disney or Nestle,
Coke,
Cola,
you name it.
And uh,

523
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:11.910
he,
he makes these incredibly simple prototypes out of construction paper

524
00:32:11.911 --> 00:32:15.720
oftentimes.
And then we'll license these ideas for,

525
00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:19.650
I'm assuming hundreds of thousands,
millions of dollars over time.

526
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:24.470
And he was given the magic of thinking big at one point by,
uh,

527
00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.760
I believe it was a fortune 500 CEO.

528
00:32:26.761 --> 00:32:31.761
So the lineage hip least or the path that the book took to me was,

529
00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.530
was fascinating in and of itself.
And I read it,

530
00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:39.470
I would say around 2003,

531
00:32:39.471 --> 00:32:43.100
2004 which was just before I took my,

532
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:48.930
my walkabout and did all the experiments [inaudible] with my business at the

533
00:32:48.931 --> 00:32:49.620
time.

534
00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:54.110
Two either redesign the business or shut it down.

535
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:58.110
And that was the journey that then precipitated the writing of the four hour

536
00:32:58.111 --> 00:33:00.470
workweek.
So the,
the magic of thinking big.
I,
I,

537
00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.870
I've been meaning to reread it and part of me,
I don't know,

538
00:33:03.871 --> 00:33:05.960
tell me if I'd be curious to get your peanuts.

539
00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:10.970
So I read it so long ago and I have such a high opinion of it that I'm worried I

540
00:33:11.401 --> 00:33:15.210
will read it now and it will not age well when I read it a second time.

541
00:33:15.211 --> 00:33:16.410
Have you read it recently?

542
00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:22.160
<v 2>Uh,
last time was probably about five years ago and I've found out it's just as</v>

543
00:33:22.161 --> 00:33:25.850
good.
I just love the CRI,
the,
you know,
the overly simple examples.

544
00:33:25.851 --> 00:33:30.140
Like imagine that there's two little gentlemen in your head there is Mr. Success

545
00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:35.290
and Mr. Defeat Mr. Defeat always wants to throw some oil and sand and to is your

546
00:33:35.811 --> 00:33:40.630
crank case of your mind and it's just like these,
you know,
I find that most,

547
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:44.620
maybe this is my engineer's brain handicap again,

548
00:33:44.621 --> 00:33:49.621
but I really get annoyed by overly flowery language like kind of Harper's

549
00:33:49.721 --> 00:33:50.351
magazine,

550
00:33:50.351 --> 00:33:54.400
Atlantic stuff where people just go on for like eight pages to cover something

551
00:33:54.401 --> 00:33:56.500
that could have fit in a couple sentences.
Right.

552
00:33:56.770 --> 00:34:01.770
And Dr. Schwartz doesn't do any of that shit and that in fact his writing style,

553
00:34:01.921 --> 00:34:06.320
it really inspired me.
And like when I write as Mr Money Mustache,
I'm thinking,

554
00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.330
I'm like channeling David Jason Schwartz,

555
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.360
and he always starts off every story with this little anecdote.

556
00:34:11.361 --> 00:34:14.210
Like that's makes them sound like casual and powerful.
He's like,
oh,

557
00:34:14.211 --> 00:34:18.040
it was relaxing in my lounge one day when a few of my employees came in for

558
00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:22.220
questions.
You know,
like,
you know,
you got to read it again.

559
00:34:22.221 --> 00:34:24.470
I'm going to return.
All right.
It's been on my,

560
00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.290
it's been on my to do list for January because I've set aside,

561
00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:33.160
<v 1>we're doing this interview in January,
2017 and I've set aside,</v>

562
00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.110
uh,

563
00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:39.110
the first two weeks minimum to simply consider options because I've in the past,

564
00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:47.220
uh,
fallen prey to over calendaring myself,
uh,

565
00:34:47.221 --> 00:34:51.750
and for fun things in,
in many cases,
but nonetheless over calendaring.

566
00:34:51.751 --> 00:34:55.400
So I don't have as much slack in the system,
uh,

567
00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:59.070
empty space as I would like and,
uh,

568
00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:02.570
I've been meaning to as part of my self imposed curriculum,

569
00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:05.420
reread the magic of thinking big.
So I will,
I will jump into that.

570
00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:10.040
How are you different from Mr?
Money Mustache,

571
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:11.630
if,
if at all?

572
00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:16.180
<v 2>Um,
well the lines are pretty fine.
Pretty,
you know,
I,</v>

573
00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:20.310
I don't know if there's like a really formal dif difference,
but,
um,

574
00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:24.080
he's probably a bit more perfect than me.
Like I,

575
00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:29.080
I'll complain occasionally and,
uh,
if I don't catch myself and I won't,

576
00:35:29.081 --> 00:35:32.140
I don't actually complain on the blog about,
you know,

577
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:34.920
when and where I'm going to add this.
The world is being mean to me.

578
00:35:34.921 --> 00:35:36.210
But in general,

579
00:35:36.211 --> 00:35:41.070
like because I magic of thinking big so long ago and internalized it so much and

580
00:35:41.071 --> 00:35:44.580
I kind of ran my work career and my,
you know,

581
00:35:44.581 --> 00:35:49.530
my international adventures of moving to the u s and everything under those

582
00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:54.390
assumptions,
I,
I feel like,
you know,
I'm pretty,

583
00:35:54.391 --> 00:35:57.060
I'm failing Mr Money Mustache,
I'm more sensitive.
She,
the thing like,

584
00:35:57.061 --> 00:36:00.270
I don't lecture people in real life about,
you know,

585
00:36:00.271 --> 00:36:04.590
like I don't actually smash my fist through the driver window of pickup trucks

586
00:36:04.591 --> 00:36:08.340
and honk the horns with their foreheads and tell them they shouldn't be going

587
00:36:08.341 --> 00:36:11.400
through the drive through with a stupid off road diesel thing.
But,

588
00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:16.170
but I think it,
but,
and I write it,
so yeah,

589
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:18.860
the Mr Money Mustache is a little more violent in,
uh,

590
00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:21.900
in his writing and confrontational.

591
00:36:21.901 --> 00:36:25.800
And I enjoy that because it helps me remain more calm in my real life because

592
00:36:25.801 --> 00:36:29.250
nobody wants to be lectured in real life about.

593
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:32.730
Even if you have some ideas you want to share with them,

594
00:36:32.731 --> 00:36:36.000
you have to wait for them to come to you.
And when you're running a blog,

595
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:37.950
they have come to you by definition,

596
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:43.430
which means there are a lot more open to having their faces punched in a literal

597
00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:46.380
a literary sense,
right?

598
00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:52.890
You get to get pros mugged,
uh,
while you're,
while you're shaping their behavior.

599
00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:56.760
Uh,
the question of the u s so the,
uh,

600
00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:00.060
I spent a little bit of time in China and even as a,

601
00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:05.220
as an American who's somewhat desensitized to consumption,
I think that China's,

602
00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:11.140
it's appears to be 10 times more materialistic and ended it driven towards over

603
00:37:12.081 --> 00:37:14.700
consumption.
But the,
that's not really leading.

604
00:37:14.701 --> 00:37:17.720
I don't want to lead us necessarily a new conversation about China.
The,
the ad,

605
00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:20.460
the question I was going to ask,
and this may have a very simple answer,

606
00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:25.470
why did you decide to stay in the u s I just love it.
Here it goes.
Uh,

607
00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:30.710
it's kind of like the furnace of the world.
Like many of the problems,
uh,

608
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:35.870
in the u s that stem from under regulation are also its strengths in the sense

609
00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:40.320
that you can just start stuff up and then nobody even notices that you're doing

610
00:37:40.321 --> 00:37:44.130
it.
And you can have a giant company before anyone's even noticed.
And uh,

611
00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:49.580
it's just the entrepreneurial and the optimism and the lack of rules is kind of,

612
00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:54.830
it goes along with my personality personality because I hate rules.
Um,

613
00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:59.930
I'm really in favor of people self regulating in the sense that don't be a jerk

614
00:38:00.091 --> 00:38:03.420
to your neighbor and don't pollute the world and everything like that,

615
00:38:03.421 --> 00:38:08.421
which is the part that annoys me about some of the u s a business culture,

616
00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:10.171
but in general,

617
00:38:10.171 --> 00:38:15.171
I just love it here and I love the giant range of geographies to compare it to

618
00:38:15.601 --> 00:38:16.051
Canada,

619
00:38:16.051 --> 00:38:20.610
which is kinda just a string of cds along the border and the u s you have a grid

620
00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:26.090
of cities and islands that range from like Arctic Tundra to tropical islands and

621
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:31.800
coconut,
coconut shell tops and everything like that.

622
00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.620
It's just a lot more variety and excitement here.

623
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.120
<v 1>Yeah,
there is,
there is a lot of variety or,</v>

624
00:38:38.121 --> 00:38:43.121
and I've actually decided that this year will be my year of exploration in the

625
00:38:45.331 --> 00:38:47.280
domestic United States.
And I've,
I've,

626
00:38:47.281 --> 00:38:51.000
I've realized that my default and the default of,
of many people,

627
00:38:51.001 --> 00:38:56.001
I think when they have their designated time for travel or vacation,

628
00:38:57.241 --> 00:38:59.520
is oftentimes to fantasize about the trips overseas.

629
00:38:59.521 --> 00:39:04.521
And I've realized I've neglected to explore so much diversity in the United

630
00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:09.320
States itself.
So I'm planning on somehow transporting,
uh,

631
00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:13.590
me and my pooch around the country,
which I am very excited to do.

632
00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:19.050
And next thing I'd like to do is,
is read something and get your comments on it.

633
00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.700
So this is,
uh,
this is from a,

634
00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:26.760
a piece,
a profile of yours in the,

635
00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:31.350
the New Yorker,
a which congratulations,
I guess it's one of the top 16.

636
00:39:31.351 --> 00:39:35.550
Is it most read of the year,
uh,
profile,
something along those lines.

637
00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.850
<v 2>Oh yeah,
yeah,
I saw that.
Thanks to you.
I think on Twitter</v>

638
00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:43.010
I did,
I might've driven,
uh,

639
00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.780
<v 1>some traffic there,
which,
which uh,</v>

640
00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:49.340
I was happy to do and also hesitant to do because I know that there are,

641
00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:53.070
I'm s I'm for sure there are things that are at the,

642
00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:58.040
at the best incomplete,
uh,
and,
and maybe completely off base at worst,

643
00:39:58.041 --> 00:40:00.530
but that's just the nature of the beast when you're dealing with these types of

644
00:40:00.531 --> 00:40:01.040
profile.

645
00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.680
<v 2>Yeah.
I did a snarky responses,
a section for that,</v>

646
00:40:04.681 --> 00:40:06.540
like complete on that genius.

647
00:40:06.541 --> 00:40:10.770
Start it website if anybody you're inline responsive.

648
00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:13.680
Yeah.
Cause that way you can,

649
00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:17.430
the writer can write his story and then I can add my stuff right on the side and

650
00:40:17.431 --> 00:40:19.470
that kind of corrects for the one sidedness of

651
00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:23.520
<v 1>normal New Yorker journalism.
Yeah.
I might have to do that myself,</v>

652
00:40:23.521 --> 00:40:25.740
although I'm not sure I want to reopen the wound.

653
00:40:25.741 --> 00:40:28.740
I was misquoted even after correcting fact checkers,

654
00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.940
I was misquoted and number of people were misquoted properly.

655
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.610
Half a dozen times in the piece that I had in the New Yorker,

656
00:40:35.611 --> 00:40:39.690
which really rankled me because of course it sits at the top of Google with page

657
00:40:39.691 --> 00:40:44.310
rank,
but water under the bridge for now.
Uh,
I'll put that aside.

658
00:40:44.311 --> 00:40:48.850
The piece I wanted to read though I don't,
I don't think is going to a,
okay,

659
00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:53.990
push those buttons.
Uh,
let me start with the following.

660
00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.280
So being an engineered,

661
00:40:55.281 --> 00:40:57.890
he runs the numbers once after his bike was apparently stolen,

662
00:40:57.891 --> 00:41:01.790
he ruminated on the wisdom of locking one spike.
And this is a,

663
00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:05.170
this is then to your writing.
This was the first theft in many,

664
00:41:05.171 --> 00:41:07.210
many years of very carefree living.

665
00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:10.450
The craigslist for replacement value of that bike was probably around $500.

666
00:41:10.451 --> 00:41:13.540
What value do I place on a decade of the fearless freedom of leaving shit

667
00:41:13.541 --> 00:41:15.490
happily unlocked and not worrying about it?

668
00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:18.910
How about the value of my time saved and not spending my life fumbling with an

669
00:41:18.911 --> 00:41:19.691
enormous key chain,

670
00:41:19.691 --> 00:41:24.691
90 seconds a day for 10 years and 91 hours or at least $4,500 in my time at $50

671
00:41:25.061 --> 00:41:25.510
an hour.

672
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:30.510
I was still coming out way ahead and you concluded if you can't afford to lose

673
00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:35.080
it,
you can't afford to buy it yet.
Otherwise the owns you rather than vice versa.

674
00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:39.190
And there,
there are plenty of folks out there who,

675
00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:45.250
who think we are more opposed then I think we are,

676
00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.710
uh,
because the type of math that you did here,

677
00:41:47.711 --> 00:41:49.060
and I'd love to get your thoughts on it,

678
00:41:49.061 --> 00:41:53.610
but these are the types of things that I think about constantly.
Uh,

679
00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:56.530
the how the in the,

680
00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:00.790
how many of these rote decisions,

681
00:42:00.791 --> 00:42:05.791
common decisions are burning up the nonrenewable resource of time in the

682
00:42:07.911 --> 00:42:12.911
interest of some marginal utility perceived marginally utility in terms of,

683
00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:18.140
of dollars and cents.
But,
uh,
I'd love to hear any sort of thoughts who are,

684
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:21.500
or elaborations that you have on this because I,
I love this example.

685
00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:23.570
<v 2>Yeah.
Well,
it's,</v>

686
00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:28.580
it is the math sometimes explicit like that and sometimes more implicit,

687
00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.680
um,
that drives most of my decisions.

688
00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:36.710
And that's why I'm surprised like anybody who says that Mr Money Mustache and

689
00:42:37.141 --> 00:42:40.680
Tim Ferris are opposites in any kind of way.

690
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:43.590
I think they're not really understanding the picture because it's really just an

691
00:42:43.591 --> 00:42:48.570
optimization process,
right?
Like,
um,
I'm not opposed to spending money.

692
00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:53.400
My only limitations on spending money are number one,
it has to make me happy.

693
00:42:53.401 --> 00:42:54.234
And number two,

694
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:58.620
a factor in my personal happiness is like resource consumption because I kind of

695
00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:03.150
know the numbers behind all the costs to other people like into the earth or

696
00:43:03.151 --> 00:43:03.931
everything that I buy.

697
00:43:03.931 --> 00:43:08.931
So that kind of rules out certain types of spending that other non sciency,

698
00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:11.400
non environmentalist people might feel okay about.

699
00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.180
But if you push that bit aside,
um,

700
00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:17.850
it's all just about having the maximum amount of fun.
So,
um,

701
00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.470
and if you have limited money,

702
00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:24.890
then having to go to work for a longer time is a genuine source of non-fun and

703
00:43:25.591 --> 00:43:28.950
thus spending less money is going to give you more of something that's more fun,

704
00:43:28.951 --> 00:43:32.420
which is time and then you're all set.
So that's a win.

705
00:43:32.421 --> 00:43:37.421
And then now in this post work a world where I've stumbled into more money than

706
00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:38.733
I could have.

707
00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:44.090
Imagine having my spending hasn't changed and that's just a sign that I got some

708
00:43:44.391 --> 00:43:46.920
of the decisions approximately right to begin with.
And,

709
00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:50.030
and if I had started buying more stuff afterwards that might've been assigned

710
00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.670
that I didn't really do the math right to begin with.

711
00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:58.140
<v 1>What do you do with the,
and I apologize that this is a simplistic question,</v>

712
00:43:58.141 --> 00:44:03.141
but what do you do with the money that you have as a surplus in this post work

713
00:44:03.291 --> 00:44:04.124
life?

714
00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:10.110
What happens to if the expenses aren't going up or nominally go up and down by a

715
00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:16.440
few thousand dollars a year?
How do you allocate the surplus?

716
00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:21.670
<v 2>Yeah,
that's some,
that's another thing that has to be optimized.
And because I,</v>

717
00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:26.320
I feel that money is such a valuable resource,
so I'm still working on it.

718
00:44:26.321 --> 00:44:30.160
So I tried,
you know,
I've,
I've been doing small donations,

719
00:44:30.161 --> 00:44:32.030
like I'm paying for more

720
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:34.580
<v 1>stuff when other people I know can't afford it.</v>

721
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.950
And then I did a medium size donation,
uh,

722
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:43.030
with the effective under the effective altruism movement that I know that you've

723
00:44:43.101 --> 00:44:47.160
covered at one point in your tools of titans book.
Yeah.
Well,
mechanical on the,

724
00:44:47.161 --> 00:44:51.330
uh,
on the podcast,
the cofounder or maybe founder of,
of that movement.

725
00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:52.271
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

726
00:44:52.271 --> 00:44:55.750
And I think one of those two founders sent me an email after I sent my donation

727
00:44:55.751 --> 00:44:59.930
to them.
And,
uh,
they seem really,
really,
really sharp people.

728
00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.670
Uh,
so that's,
uh,
that's one useful thing to do with surplus money.

729
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.870
The only reason I have some of it still sitting in my investment accounts and

730
00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:09.010
it's still rolling in of course,

731
00:45:09.011 --> 00:45:12.560
cause they still have this unexpected blog income.
MMM.

732
00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:17.930
Is I feel like I can leverage the attention of all these people for something

733
00:45:18.741 --> 00:45:22.550
good.
And that would be bigger than just donating,
like,
you know,

734
00:45:22.551 --> 00:45:27.460
$1 million per whatever period to um,
to standard causes.

735
00:45:27.461 --> 00:45:29.200
I think.
Um,
I would,

736
00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:34.230
I would like to create kind of like one of those tipping point effects in the u

737
00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:35.840
s that might for example,

738
00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:40.330
tip us more towards bike based transfer temporal rotation.
Um,

739
00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:43.370
instead of a car based,
you know,
and,

740
00:45:43.371 --> 00:45:48.371
and potentially save like billions or trillions of dollars of society's wealth

741
00:45:48.801 --> 00:45:52.660
and have it go somewhere better if the whole society got more excited about a

742
00:45:52.661 --> 00:45:53.690
different way of living.

743
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:56.960
So that's why I haven't just given away all the money yet because I feel like

744
00:45:56.961 --> 00:45:57.591
for example,

745
00:45:57.591 --> 00:46:01.360
what if I could start like a little mini town where we do things really

746
00:46:01.361 --> 00:46:04.330
awesomely?
And this of course it sounds a bit like a cult.
Like,
Oh yeah,

747
00:46:04.331 --> 00:46:06.780
we have to start a commune.
But uh,
yeah,

748
00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:10.150
that's something also sounds like Singapore,
right?
Yeah.
Right.

749
00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:15.370
Rian within a town based on the ideas of cohousing or something like that.

750
00:46:15.371 --> 00:46:17.470
So these guy ideas are still swimming around in my head.

751
00:46:17.471 --> 00:46:22.120
I haven't solved the problem of how to deal with a surplus money efficiently.

752
00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:25.290
But once I do,
then I will started having some fun with it.

753
00:46:25.291 --> 00:46:28.890
And then I'll probably also start trying to make more money and like have the

754
00:46:28.891 --> 00:46:32.250
blog make more money because then I'll have a use for it.

755
00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:38.560
<v 1>And the,
I'd love to hear more about how you,</v>

756
00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:43.390
your decision making process or thought process or internal dialogue when you

757
00:46:43.391 --> 00:46:47.780
are considering buying something,
what are the questions that you ask yourself?

758
00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:52.420
And if it's related to happiness,
I want to okay.
Define that.

759
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:54.280
And maybe a way to do that is,
you know,

760
00:46:54.281 --> 00:46:57.440
how do you know when you're happy or unhappy?
Uh,

761
00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:01.700
but I'd love to just maybe take those in,
in either order really.

762
00:47:01.701 --> 00:47:04.590
But what,
what's the,
what's the thought process like,

763
00:47:04.591 --> 00:47:07.800
or the internal monologue slash dialogue when you're considering buying

764
00:47:07.801 --> 00:47:08.634
something?

765
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:12.980
<v 2>Yeah.
Well usually I try to start with like,
no,
you're,
we need,
what do you think?</v>

766
00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.410
What kind of consumer are you?
You know,

767
00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:18.290
like just a little bit of mental beat down to shut off the easiest things.

768
00:47:18.291 --> 00:47:22.350
That's what keeps me from buying like like a Tesla model s or something like

769
00:47:22.351 --> 00:47:25.440
that.
Because even though I think it's a great car,
I support it.

770
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:29.560
I know for sure that wouldn't make me any happier cause I don't even have

771
00:47:29.561 --> 00:47:31.960
anything to do with it.
Like I don't drive really.

772
00:47:31.961 --> 00:47:34.390
So so obvious stuff gets shut off.

773
00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:37.930
But then when you get into like things that you're pretty sure you want,

774
00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:42.310
then you just think about it for longer,
procrastinate a little bit,

775
00:47:42.311 --> 00:47:47.311
see if the desire goes away a bit and then consider how much space that thing is

776
00:47:47.321 --> 00:47:52.300
going to take up in my,
my limited a space of my studio for example.

777
00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:55.850
And then imagine how I would feel if it broke.

778
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:58.810
Cause a lot of stuff does break even if you have high quality gear and it's

779
00:47:58.811 --> 00:48:02.980
really annoying to deal with things that break and if you have to warranty,

780
00:48:02.981 --> 00:48:06.160
fix it.
And finally I ask myself,

781
00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:09.430
is this removing a negative in my life?

782
00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:14.550
Because it's pretty well studied that happiness is not very much affected by

783
00:48:15.191 --> 00:48:17.680
adding positives to your life.
It's mostly,

784
00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:20.620
especially in a rich world environment like we live,

785
00:48:20.621 --> 00:48:24.290
it's mostly accomplished by removing things that are a strong negative to every

786
00:48:24.291 --> 00:48:25.124
day.

787
00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:30.480
So getting myself like a remote control photography drone is unlikely to make me

788
00:48:30.701 --> 00:48:34.270
happier because my life doesn't currently sucks due to the absence of

789
00:48:34.271 --> 00:48:38.440
photography,
drone quad copter thing.
He's so that's,

790
00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:41.920
you know,
and whereas if there's something that every day I'm like,
damn it,

791
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:45.610
I just wished I didn't always trip over this,
you know,

792
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:49.500
broken dishwasher,
whatever that then replacing your dishwasher is,

793
00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:54.420
it's probably going to be a happiness,
uh,
boosting proposition.
What's,

794
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:59.230
what purchases,
uh,
or productions for that matter?

795
00:48:59.231 --> 00:49:00.490
I know you make a lot of things,

796
00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:05.520
but what purchases just to stick with one category that come to mind have most

797
00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.530
improved your happiness by removing negatives?
Yeah.

798
00:49:11.531 --> 00:49:15.010
Well that's a perfect followup question because I'm talking to you right now in

799
00:49:15.011 --> 00:49:18.940
this studio building that I made over the process of the last year.

800
00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:22.930
It's kind of a thrifty,
like a 400 square foot modernist,

801
00:49:22.931 --> 00:49:26.260
a thing with a lot of windows and,
and uh,

802
00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:29.780
overlooking this nice forest did park behind my house.
So,
um,

803
00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:33.820
I had a consistent problem after I moved to this current house we live in,

804
00:49:33.821 --> 00:49:38.170
in 2013.
It's a bit too small for our style of living.

805
00:49:38.171 --> 00:49:41.830
So I was genuinely tripping over stuff a bit and always having to move things

806
00:49:41.831 --> 00:49:45.500
around.
And I had some of my equipment out in the back,
like my table saw.

807
00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:49.570
I would have to live under a tarp during the rare Colorado precipitation events

808
00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:54.670
and I realized,
you know,
more space would actually solve this problem.

809
00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:59.110
And I always want it to have a detached studio anyway to play music in because

810
00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:03.790
um,
I don't want to have to like drown out my family three years when I'm playing

811
00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:08.730
bad rock music with my friends.
So I built the studio and um,

812
00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:14.040
I did it all myself because I know from experience that this manual labor and

813
00:50:14.231 --> 00:50:17.290
solving physical problems and one of the happiest things I can possibly do,

814
00:50:17.291 --> 00:50:18.340
just like,
you know,

815
00:50:18.341 --> 00:50:22.450
hundreds of hours of lifting and sweating and digging and you know,

816
00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:27.010
all these amazing,
he's full outdoor things with friends.
And now I'm,
I'm in,

817
00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:30.500
you know,
um,
recording a Tim Ferris podcast in my studio,

818
00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:35.140
surrounded my drums and bass and guitar and watching the trees sway outside.

819
00:50:35.141 --> 00:50:40.141
So this has been really a genuine happiness boosting spendage expenditure of

820
00:50:40.541 --> 00:50:45.010
money and it's brought me happiness pretty much from the day I broke ground on

821
00:50:45.011 --> 00:50:47.010
this,
you know,
this piece of dirt.
So,

822
00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:50.990
so no regrets there even though that was a lot more than a,

823
00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.720
and a few dinners out that I spent on this thing.

824
00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:55.673
<v 1>I've been,</v>

825
00:50:56.970 --> 00:51:01.970
I've been hoping and wishing and fantasizing at some point about building my own

826
00:51:02.611 --> 00:51:03.091
structure.

827
00:51:03.091 --> 00:51:08.091
I have not done this and I've thought about it ever since I had Kevin Kelly on

828
00:51:08.161 --> 00:51:11.760
the podcast,
founding editor of wired magazine,
incredible guy.

829
00:51:11.761 --> 00:51:16.761
I mean really the real life world's most interesting man in so many ways know a,

830
00:51:17.550 --> 00:51:22.200
an impeccable technology futurist who has an Amish beard and spends time with

831
00:51:22.201 --> 00:51:25.260
the Amish.
People can listen to the episode.
It's a long story,

832
00:51:25.261 --> 00:51:30.261
but I asked him what every person should do at least once in their lifetime and

833
00:51:30.681 --> 00:51:35.600
he said,
build a home,
build a house.
Uh,
and I,
every time,

834
00:51:35.601 --> 00:51:37.880
this is the lesson I need to relearn over and over again,

835
00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:44.280
I use my hands in that capacity,
that manual labor reward.

836
00:51:44.281 --> 00:51:48.930
Like you said,
it's,
it's just unbelievable.
Even yesterday I was,
I was purging,

837
00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:52.320
donating a bunch of stuff that I just don't need.
I was,
I was,

838
00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:54.750
I was getting rid of a bunch of stuff in the,
the,

839
00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:59.940
the simple visual reward of the before and after using my hands to move a bunch

840
00:52:01.441 --> 00:52:03.730
of stuff around and have that before and after.

841
00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:08.790
So much more rewarding than some of the biggest things I've done on laptops or

842
00:52:09.571 --> 00:52:13.110
on the web in the last few months.
I felt ashamed.

843
00:52:13.111 --> 00:52:15.180
In some ways it's such a menial,

844
00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:18.610
mundane set of tasks was so rewarding

845
00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:19.371
<v 2>to Jack.</v>

846
00:52:19.371 --> 00:52:24.350
Kevin Kelly is right and this is why as a fellow lifestyle guru,

847
00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:25.940
admittedly a junior lifestyle guru,

848
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.000
I spend most of my time doing manual labor even though I can make infinite money

849
00:52:31.131 --> 00:52:35.840
type shit into the computer and publishing it to,
you know,
the cult following.

850
00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:40.250
I hardly do that at all because the not doesn't work for everybody,

851
00:52:40.251 --> 00:52:44.030
but certain people get incredible satisfaction out of building because it's like

852
00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:45.470
the zen aspect of it.

853
00:52:45.471 --> 00:52:50.000
There's like physical and mental and problem solving.
It's like,

854
00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:53.870
it's like when a human was made to do so.
Kevin is right.
In fact,

855
00:52:53.871 --> 00:52:57.540
the House that I live in,
I also built,
before I built the studio,

856
00:52:57.550 --> 00:53:00.890
I built as a slight exaggeration cause there was a bit of a shell.

857
00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:05.150
I tore it down to like a brick shell and then rebuilt it to a different shape.

858
00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:07.730
But I'm,
and every time,
like every night,

859
00:53:07.731 --> 00:53:09.680
especially in the winter here when it snows,

860
00:53:09.681 --> 00:53:14.330
I look up at the trees and like the snow falling on the roof that I made and the

861
00:53:14.331 --> 00:53:17.870
fireplace that I put in there and the heating system that I designed,

862
00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:20.810
pumping water under my floors and he how you did on my feet.
I'm like,

863
00:53:20.811 --> 00:53:25.811
this is the most satisfying thing I could possibly experience.

864
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:27.690
So yeah,

865
00:53:27.691 --> 00:53:31.470
you should figure out a way to build something at least like a shed quarters or

866
00:53:31.471 --> 00:53:34.190
like a man cave type thing in your backyard.

867
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:39.230
And I have this thing called carpenter tourism where I go out to people in need

868
00:53:39.601 --> 00:53:42.240
and build fun stuff with them and teach them how to build.

869
00:53:42.241 --> 00:53:46.970
So if you ever want to do a teamwork,
um,
Tim Ferriss Studio,
then I'm,

870
00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:51.120
I'm making the software now.
It would make a quite interesting story.
I could,

871
00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:55.140
I could be a,
like an operating room,
uh,

872
00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:59.130
assistant of sorts.
You'd be like Hammer,
Hammer,
a screwdriver,
screwdriver.

873
00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:02.400
I think it'd be more of a liability otherwise,
but,
uh,

874
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:04.170
well that's how you learn though.

875
00:54:04.171 --> 00:54:06.990
I'll give you the nail gun and then you'll make some mistakes and we'll bring a

876
00:54:06.991 --> 00:54:10.740
welder and then you'll like explode some stuff that later you would making fine

877
00:54:10.741 --> 00:54:14.840
welding lines and yeah.
You know,
I might take you up on that.
I love Colorado.

878
00:54:14.841 --> 00:54:17.640
I've,
I've,
I've been spending more and more time in Colorado.

879
00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:22.620
Well I was assuming we would build something at your pieces of the world where

880
00:54:22.621 --> 00:54:25.860
you need a structure because you don't need to like build stuff for me.

881
00:54:25.861 --> 00:54:28.470
That's not,
no,
not for you.
I was thinking about the people in need,

882
00:54:28.471 --> 00:54:30.870
but maybe they don't want like some horrible,

883
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:36.800
Ferocious Picasso painting of a table where they're like,

884
00:54:37.081 --> 00:54:41.700
I didn't really want some abstract,
weird thing.
Ferris,
if you could,

885
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:43.860
if you could use parallel lines and next time please.

886
00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:47.790
In this case you were the person in need because you're this,
you know,

887
00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:49.730
this accomplished guy who yet has,

888
00:54:49.731 --> 00:54:53.780
he had a hole in your life where you haven't actually built a house yet.
So,

889
00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:58.740
so I felt sorry for you.
That's all.
Alright.
I will,

890
00:54:58.741 --> 00:55:02.850
I will put a bookmark in that I may take you up on it.
Here's,

891
00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:08.640
here are a few questions related to consumption because I think about,

892
00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:14.160
I do think about consumption of Fairmount living in San Francisco on some level

893
00:55:14.161 --> 00:55:19.080
helps because you can't walk five or 10 feet without having someone to talk to

894
00:55:19.081 --> 00:55:23.490
you about it or seeing billboards are seeing,
uh,
announcements and so on,

895
00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:27.270
a related to some type of conservation or,

896
00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:30.780
or curbing consumption.
But if you,
a few questions for you.

897
00:55:30.810 --> 00:55:35.460
The first is I,
and this is related to kids,

898
00:55:35.461 --> 00:55:36.570
so I don't have kids.

899
00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:41.730
One of the considerations has been a concern for consumption.

900
00:55:41.731 --> 00:55:46.050
So how do you reconcile kids with consumption or do you,

901
00:55:46.051 --> 00:55:51.051
do you not see them as a dramatically increasing the sort of consumptive burden?

902
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:57.720
Oh yeah.
Kids are definitely a huge form of consumption.

903
00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:01.600
Like if you're a rich world resident and you have a kid,
you know,
that's,

904
00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:06.390
that's another hundred years of rich world lifestyle going on there.
So,
uh,

905
00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.640
but I'm not a pure person.

906
00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:12.220
I strategically in indulging fun stuff and,

907
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:16.710
and my wife and I knew we wanted to have kids and we just happen to feel that

908
00:56:16.711 --> 00:56:19.630
one was the right number for us.
Um,

909
00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:22.800
and I'm not judgemental of against other people,
but I,

910
00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:25.120
it's just good.

911
00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:29.200
It's one of the things to throw into your equation of like child raising.

912
00:56:29.201 --> 00:56:32.050
Like should I have one or maybe 13?
And we're like,
well,

913
00:56:32.051 --> 00:56:36.190
if if consumption of natural resources,
that is a factor,

914
00:56:36.191 --> 00:56:40.450
you might not have 13,
but if it's not a factor,
you know,
no judgment from me.

915
00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:42.890
And so we got one and then,
uh,

916
00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:47.930
you can have probably like a four x 400% difference in the amount of consumption

917
00:56:50.741 --> 00:56:54.430
you do on behalf of your child,
just depending on how you're raised them,

918
00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:58.300
depending on what activities they're into and what kind of stuff you buy them

919
00:56:58.301 --> 00:57:01.570
and how you train them as well.
If you train them like,
hey,

920
00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:04.390
we're rich and rich people get to buy whatever they want,

921
00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:09.370
then you're going to raise a super consumer and more of the richer you are.

922
00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:12.910
Whereas if you teach them that there's a balance and give them a little bit of

923
00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:15.730
biology and science in their upbringing,

924
00:57:15.731 --> 00:57:19.330
then they're going to have a value system that prevents them from being nearly

925
00:57:19.331 --> 00:57:24.040
as destructive and yet they'll probably still have more fun in the world as
well.

926
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:30.030
Is it true that you paid your son per mile written on his bike at one point?

927
00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:36.220
Yeah,
we still do that.
There's just kind of a,
I like this by the way,

928
00:57:36.221 --> 00:57:40.510
this is not in any way criticism,
right?
Every parent,

929
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:45.550
many of them like to find excuses to give their kids and money in order for them

930
00:57:45.551 --> 00:57:48.310
to figure out how to manage it at a young age.

931
00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:52.030
So I didn't want to just hand over money and like your money comes from nowhere.

932
00:57:52.031 --> 00:57:55.870
So I thought that bicycling would be kind of a little income system for him.

933
00:57:55.871 --> 00:58:00.871
So he has an odometer on his bike so it automatically tracks the miles and then

934
00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:02.830
just give them 10 cents a mile,

935
00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:06.490
which adds up pretty fast if you're an all bicycle family.

936
00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:10.420
So then just give them little payouts and then we've got a spreadsheet where we

937
00:58:10.421 --> 00:58:14.170
keep track of the money.
He's 11 years old by the way,
and uh,

938
00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:18.430
and that earns interest.
So he has a comparison of like,

939
00:58:18.431 --> 00:58:21.310
if I keep my money in the Bank of Dad,
then I'm going to earn interest.

940
00:58:21.311 --> 00:58:23.950
Whereas if I spend it,
my capital decreases.

941
00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:29.370
And then that interest bearing piece of like my little green employees are gone

942
00:58:29.831 --> 00:58:32.320
forever.
So he still spends his money of course,

943
00:58:32.321 --> 00:58:35.800
but he just knows everything's a trade off,
which is,
makes it more,

944
00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:40.120
more thoughtful that you are an engineer and it's,

945
00:58:40.121 --> 00:58:43.330
it seems like you have a strong,
uh,

946
00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:47.110
engineered genetic through line in your family.

947
00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:51.850
Has Your son tried to Ferris Bueller the odometer at any point?
Of course,

948
00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:54.140
doing the opposite.
Has he figured out how to,

949
00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:56.290
how to tinker with his odometer or I guess,

950
00:58:56.291 --> 00:59:00.190
is he so good that perhaps you wouldn't have noticed?
Yeah,
I mean,
you never know.

951
00:59:00.191 --> 00:59:04.240
He might be hooking it up to a cordless drill and spinning that front wheel.
But,

952
00:59:04.241 --> 00:59:09.050
uh,
no,
I don't think,
uh,
he's not,
that's not in his personality.
Like,
uh,

953
00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:11.740
he's not into really cheating on anything.

954
00:59:12.350 --> 00:59:14.350
He's plus it's this kind of an abundance,

955
00:59:14.351 --> 00:59:17.950
like he has more money than he can spend.
A little dude has like 1000 bucks,

956
00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:20.170
then has a spreadsheet now.

957
00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:24.170
And only thing he really wants to buy as is the odd video game,

958
00:59:24.171 --> 00:59:27.530
which might be like 20 or $30 once every few months.

959
00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:32.531
So he's pretty much retired already because the passive income and that he's

960
00:59:32.751 --> 00:59:36.050
earning his,
uh,
is close to finding his video game needs.

961
00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:41.270
Either that or he's got the best long con in history.
Like he's been,

962
00:59:41.271 --> 00:59:44.690
he's been Connie you with as good behavior for 11 years just to,

963
00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:48.320
just to tinker with this odometer,
which I don't think is the case.

964
00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:51.980
But for those people who are listening,

965
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:54.470
and I'm sure you're asked this all the time,

966
00:59:54.471 --> 00:59:58.650
but books on investing or personal finance,
uh,

967
00:59:58.690 --> 01:00:01.610
are there any goto recommendations?
They don't have to be books.

968
01:00:01.611 --> 01:00:02.510
It could be resources,

969
01:00:02.511 --> 01:00:07.511
but for people who want to self educate get certainly be one of your top one or

970
01:00:08.121 --> 01:00:09.770
two blog posts as well.
But uh,

971
01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:14.890
if you were to pick from potentially your own stuff but also from other work

972
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:19.230
that's out there,
where would you direct people?
I think,
uh,

973
01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:23.640
it depends on how interested in investing you are.
One of the key,
um,

974
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:25.010
nice things about the world,

975
01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:29.780
especially the US financial system is you don't have to know much to be very

976
01:00:29.781 --> 01:00:30.500
good investor.

977
01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:35.500
Like you can be a top 10% investor by just buying one vanguard fund and leaving

978
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:39.630
your money.
It just putting all your extra money in there forever.
Um,

979
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:44.620
so if you're,
if that's your idea of,
of good enough,
uh,

980
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:46.610
which it should be for most people,

981
01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:51.440
then you can just read any book by Jack Bogle.
John Bogle,

982
01:00:51.441 --> 01:00:54.440
the founder of vanguard is one good example.
Um,

983
01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:57.740
a friend of mine who's a blogger named Jim Collins wrote this book called the

984
01:00:57.741 --> 01:01:02.000
simple path to wealth,
which is just sort of like,
uh,
even simpler,

985
01:01:02.001 --> 01:01:05.930
more story based,
like enjoyable old man's tails,

986
01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:10.760
explanation of how,
why you should invest in index funds.
And uh,

987
01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:14.960
so that's another idea,
but much more important than how to invest.

988
01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:16.700
As long as you don't screw up your investing,

989
01:01:16.701 --> 01:01:21.500
like leave your money in a checking account or by a shifty life insurance whole

990
01:01:21.501 --> 01:01:23.330
life program or whatever,
you know,
the,
uh,

991
01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.880
the things that swindle people out of their money,

992
01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:28.280
you're going to be fine in the investing side.

993
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:30.860
So the other side of that equation is a book.

994
01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:35.180
And I really want to write a book myself so then I can just recommend my own.

995
01:01:35.181 --> 01:01:40.181
But for now it's a really great one that's called your money or your life that

996
01:01:40.491 --> 01:01:43.700
everybody's heard of.
And if you just get your get the,

997
01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.500
whatever the latest edition of that book is,
um,

998
01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:50.150
it really teaches you the philosophy that's pretty similar to mine,

999
01:01:50.151 --> 01:01:54.200
which is that consumption is not really what's making you happy,

1000
01:01:54.350 --> 01:01:55.340
buying yourself treats.

1001
01:01:55.430 --> 01:02:00.430
And it's quite easy to become financially independent as soon as you modify your

1002
01:02:00.471 --> 01:02:01.400
spending in that way.

1003
01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:06.880
So huge surplus of money is on a weekly or monthly basis is the real solution to

1004
01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:11.150
your financial problems rather than becoming a super kick ass investor.

1005
01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:17.450
Yeah.
There's a book that I read,
I don't know if you've ever read this book,

1006
01:02:17.451 --> 01:02:20.220
it does primarily focus on

1007
01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:25.570
<v 1>low cost index funds,
if I remember it correctly,
but uh,</v>

1008
01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:29.720
by Daniel Solon,
the smartest investment book you'll ever read.
I,

1009
01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:31.700
I've heard of it and I had a,
I,

1010
01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:35.150
I quite enjoyed that book is a little more nuanced.

1011
01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:37.800
Certainly anything by Bogle is,
is fantastic.

1012
01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:42.040
Four people who want to dig deeper.

1013
01:02:42.041 --> 01:02:45.550
Are there any additional books that you would recommend or that you've enjoyed

1014
01:02:45.551 --> 01:02:46.384
yourself?

1015
01:02:46.570 --> 01:02:49.090
<v 2>Yeah,
if you want to get deeper,
like for example,</v>

1016
01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:52.930
more into the Warren Buffett Saas side of things where you're an active
investor.

1017
01:02:53.650 --> 01:02:54.480
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1018
01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:58.380
<v 2>One really interesting book that I read a few years ago is called the little</v>

1019
01:02:58.381 --> 01:03:00.840
book that beats the market.
And a,

1020
01:03:00.841 --> 01:03:05.340
it's really a lesson on investing value investing fundamentals.

1021
01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:08.910
How to understand if a company actually is a good deal to buy.

1022
01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:11.820
And that helps put a regular,
you know,

1023
01:03:11.821 --> 01:03:16.821
like a sober shell around investing instead of the ridiculous speculation like

1024
01:03:17.471 --> 01:03:21.550
technical chart investing I think is that's kind of universally proved to be

1025
01:03:21.551 --> 01:03:23.770
bunk,
but people are still doing it like,
oh yeah,

1026
01:03:23.771 --> 01:03:26.710
the bollinger bands are wild this week I'm going to,
you know,

1027
01:03:26.711 --> 01:03:29.830
I see a support level at 53.5 unless something happens.

1028
01:03:29.831 --> 01:03:34.410
Like all that stuff is statistically it keeps being proven wrong and people keep

1029
01:03:34.411 --> 01:03:37.420
doing it.
So don't do that.
If you're going to be an active investor,

1030
01:03:37.421 --> 01:03:40.750
then get really good at understanding companies rather than technical

1031
01:03:40.751 --> 01:03:41.650
fluctuations.

1032
01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:46.050
And that's why Warren Buffet makes a lot of money above the rocket returns is

1033
01:03:46.051 --> 01:03:50.370
cause he's a savant and understanding business and some people genuinely are

1034
01:03:50.371 --> 01:03:53.900
that maybe it would probably be less than one in a thousand people.

1035
01:03:54.270 --> 01:03:55.103
<v 1>You also do that.</v>

1036
01:03:55.110 --> 01:04:00.110
He's also a savant in emotional detachment in the sense that I'd love to talk to

1037
01:04:00.241 --> 01:04:04.450
you a bit about stoicism and so on at some point.
But he,

1038
01:04:04.451 --> 01:04:09.050
he is utterly unaffected by what he would call mister market.
Right.

1039
01:04:09.051 --> 01:04:14.051
The ups and downs of any given company that he may have bought in the form of

1040
01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:20.220
shares or outright if he purchased the entire acquire the entire company.

1041
01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:25.640
And that type of emotional detachment is also exceptionally,

1042
01:04:25.801 --> 01:04:26.634
exceptionally rare.

1043
01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:30.590
<v 2>Yeah.
And that goes without saying.
To me that's a prerequisite.</v>

1044
01:04:31.210 --> 01:04:34.690
<v 1>I don't have that at all.
So well,
we'll know in the sense that if,</v>

1045
01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.160
if I'm going to be active,

1046
01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:41.910
it is very hard for me to be an active investor in publicly traded equities.
Uh,

1047
01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:45.850
for whatever reason I can do highly speculative startups and that's a

1048
01:04:45.851 --> 01:04:49.960
disturbingly high percentage of my portfolio because I can't balance a portfolio

1049
01:04:49.961 --> 01:04:54.710
with illiquid assets or it's very challenging,
certainly.
Uh,

1050
01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:59.630
but with,
with publicly traded equities,
if I'm trying to be active,

1051
01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.100
uh,
in any capacity,

1052
01:05:01.310 --> 01:05:05.360
I do very poorly emotionally with those fluctuations and I make bad decisions.

1053
01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:11.000
But if we're talking about something like an index,
then I'm fine.
If it's,

1054
01:05:11.001 --> 01:05:12.080
if it's,
if it's in,

1055
01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:17.300
if it's entirely hands off and I have other people or in some type of say

1056
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.770
automated fashion with whether it's a wealth front or something else,

1057
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:22.930
then I don't have any trouble with it.

1058
01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:28.130
<v 2>Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's,
since I don't do active stuff anymore.</v>

1059
01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:32.340
And that's,
I'm totally would agree with you on that.
In agreement,

1060
01:05:33.450 --> 01:05:35.850
<v 1>the uh,
the book you mentioned was that by Joel Greenblatt,</v>

1061
01:05:35.851 --> 01:05:37.380
the little book that beats the market.

1062
01:05:37.650 --> 01:05:40.400
<v 2>Yeah,
that's right.
Yeah,
it was really interesting.
And it was a little book,</v>

1063
01:05:40.401 --> 01:05:42.530
which is perfect for my short book attention span.

1064
01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:47.240
<v 1>He is,
yeah.
Joel is,
is exceptionally,
is an exceptionally smart guy and uh,</v>

1065
01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.770
he has a fascinating track record because he,

1066
01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:55.300
he can teach and he has taught in classrooms in New York,
uh,

1067
01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:59.310
at universities he can write.
And he's also very,

1068
01:05:59.311 --> 01:06:02.130
very well respected as not only a value investor,

1069
01:06:02.131 --> 01:06:06.480
but also in an invite and if what you would call an event based investors.

1070
01:06:06.481 --> 01:06:10.500
So his first book,
I think it was his first book is perhaps the most

1071
01:06:11.410 --> 01:06:15.520
sophisticated of them all,
which is where people can make the most mistakes.

1072
01:06:15.550 --> 01:06:19.370
So I think that the,
the little book that beats the market makes more sense as a,

1073
01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:22.440
as a first rate or maybe the,
uh,
his later book,

1074
01:06:22.441 --> 01:06:23.910
the big secret for the small investor,

1075
01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:28.470
but book with the title that is sort of blessed and cursed in the same way that

1076
01:06:28.471 --> 01:06:32.340
the four hour workweek just sounds so schlocky as if it's going to appear at

1077
01:06:32.341 --> 01:06:36.040
three in the morning on an infomercial that it's a,
but it's highly memorable.

1078
01:06:36.070 --> 01:06:39.120
It's been,
uh,
helpful and punishing at the same time.

1079
01:06:39.121 --> 01:06:41.610
He has a book called you can be a stock market genius,

1080
01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:43.890
which is actually really sophisticated.

1081
01:06:43.891 --> 01:06:48.630
I've met some of the most successful and most of,
by the way,

1082
01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:50.220
hedge fund managers are not successful,

1083
01:06:50.221 --> 01:06:54.240
but the handful I've met who have been exceptionally successful,
this book,

1084
01:06:54.241 --> 01:06:58.620
which was intended for novices effectively is one of their favorite books.

1085
01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:02.760
Uh,
so lots of,
lots of,
yeah,
lots of interesting stuff out there.

1086
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:04.720
<v 2>Yeah,
I'm going to check that one out for sure.</v>

1087
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:09.670
Since I like Joel Greenblatt's writing a lot and I,
I still follow.

1088
01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:13.330
Um,
I,
you know,
I read an investment and finance books all the time.

1089
01:07:13.331 --> 01:07:17.230
I just try not to recommend them too much on my blog because it's supposed to be

1090
01:07:17.231 --> 01:07:21.580
about lifestyle and making your life good and I don't want it to be all

1091
01:07:21.581 --> 01:07:23.050
esoteric,
but sure.

1092
01:07:23.051 --> 01:07:27.340
I do read like the Timothy Geithner book a stress test.

1093
01:07:27.341 --> 01:07:29.670
I read that 800 page,
um,

1094
01:07:29.671 --> 01:07:33.420
description of the financial crisis and I was founded pretty captivating knowing

1095
01:07:33.421 --> 01:07:36.930
what really happened in the background.
But for the average person,

1096
01:07:36.931 --> 01:07:39.840
it's not going to help them get rich and retire earlier.

1097
01:07:39.841 --> 01:07:41.160
So I don't talk about it too much.

1098
01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:44.240
<v 1>Well,
on top of that,
if you want to a cautionary tale,</v>

1099
01:07:44.241 --> 01:07:47.230
so for those of you out there who love,
love,
love reading,
uh,

1100
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:51.650
at least if a book is captivating,
what you should get at the same time,

1101
01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:56.000
if you decide to get the,
you can be a stock market genius by,

1102
01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:59.590
uh,
Joel Greenblatt,
which is exceptional.

1103
01:08:00.130 --> 01:08:04.870
You should also read a book that will be a cautionary tale and it's a cautionary

1104
01:08:04.871 --> 01:08:09.630
tale because it,
it details the types of people that you are competing against.

1105
01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:15.150
If you choose to be really active in certain respects.

1106
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:16.730
And it's a fantastic read.

1107
01:08:16.731 --> 01:08:21.731
It's more money than God and it is about the birth of the Hedge Fund model and a

1108
01:08:24.131 --> 01:08:28.600
number of the characters,
uh,
and most successful managers in that world.

1109
01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.290
It's a bit like a liar's poker,
but instead of bonds,

1110
01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:37.320
they're talking about hedge funds and it will give you a very good idea of who

1111
01:08:38.701 --> 01:08:40.590
you are competing against.
And when you step on you,

1112
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:43.450
when you step onto the metaphorical,
uh,

1113
01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:49.200
golf green and you throw your money down as your participation and bet on

1114
01:08:50.031 --> 01:08:54.420
yourself,
uh,
the fact that tiger woods is probably two holes ahead of you,

1115
01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:58.470
uh,
become super,
super clear.
Uh,
and I,
I should also,

1116
01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:04.350
just to in in a sense reinforce what you said about index funds.

1117
01:09:04.771 --> 01:09:07.040
Say when I went to,

1118
01:09:07.041 --> 01:09:10.400
the only time I had a chance to go to the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting

1119
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:12.500
in Omaha,
Nebraska,

1120
01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:17.620
and I think they've stopped doing open Q and a with Warren Buffet and Charlie

1121
01:09:17.701 --> 01:09:22.660
monger.
But I actually ran in and it's,
it's insane.

1122
01:09:22.661 --> 01:09:27.100
I mean it is like a gigantic rock concert for investment nerds and people will

1123
01:09:27.101 --> 01:09:29.650
camp out overnight to try to get a good seat.

1124
01:09:30.010 --> 01:09:33.260
And I ran in and uh,
I was someone's guest,

1125
01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:38.930
which was great because I,
I was able to get in a little earlier than the entire,

1126
01:09:39.490 --> 01:09:42.430
uh,
the entire stadium full of folks effectively.

1127
01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:46.840
And I ran in and I found somebody who was volunteering or working there and I

1128
01:09:46.841 --> 01:09:49.750
said,
which microphone is the hardest to get to?

1129
01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:53.860
Cause they had microphones all throughout this,
this venue.

1130
01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:58.570
And that's where Udl to ask your question if they got to you and I,
I figured,

1131
01:09:58.571 --> 01:10:00.040
you know what,
people are going to be long winded.

1132
01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:02.830
Maybe the answers would be long winded,
although they very seldom are,

1133
01:10:02.831 --> 01:10:04.330
especially if Charlie Munger's involved.

1134
01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:09.040
And I need to find a Mike where I can be first or second person in line.

1135
01:10:09.190 --> 01:10:10.180
And so I ran up,

1136
01:10:10.181 --> 01:10:13.780
went through this crazy set of staircases and found this mic that was in the

1137
01:10:13.781 --> 01:10:14.614
middle of nowhere.

1138
01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:19.450
And I asked Warren Buffet if you were 30.

1139
01:10:19.690 --> 01:10:23.020
And uh,
I said hypothetically,
if you were 30,

1140
01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:26.920
you had say $500,000 to $1 million in savings.

1141
01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:30.430
Uh,
and there were a couple of other stipulations,

1142
01:10:30.431 --> 01:10:33.460
but what would you do with the money?
And he's,
and uh,
he said,

1143
01:10:33.461 --> 01:10:35.350
assuming you're not a professional investor,

1144
01:10:35.710 --> 01:10:40.540
I would put it into the s and p 500 or in an index fund and get back to work.

1145
01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:44.890
That was it.
That was,
that was the end of the answer.
And you know,
Charlie,

1146
01:10:44.891 --> 01:10:49.660
do you have anything more to add to add?
Nope.
And then onto the next question.
So,

1147
01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:50.600
uh,
yeah,
that's

1148
01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:53.570
<v 2>good advice.
It is,
cause there's so much more to work on in your life.</v>

1149
01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.910
Like if you're going to become a really good investor,

1150
01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.170
you're probably going to compromise in the areas of being a good parent or being

1151
01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:01.653
a good,

1152
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000
maintaining good physical fitness or in life like you're not really optimizing,

1153
01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:09.350
you're not supposed to optimize for money.

1154
01:11:09.351 --> 01:11:12.530
You're supposed to optimize for happiness,
which has a lot of dimensions.

1155
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:17.190
So you should really like take the sort of the four hour investor,

1156
01:11:17.191 --> 01:11:19.890
your approach and be like,
everyone says this is good,

1157
01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.680
I'm just going to do it and I'm going to work on all the other stuff in my life

1158
01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:27.780
that that also needs to be addressed.
Yeah.
Well let's,
let's jump into some,

1159
01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:32.070
some rapid fire questions,
uh,
as I call them.

1160
01:11:32.071 --> 01:11:33.900
But your answers don't need to be short.

1161
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:37.320
I'll just try to keep my long winded question as to a minimum.

1162
01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:42.810
So outside of your immediate family,
when you hear the word successful,

1163
01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:46.560
who's the first person who comes to mind for you?

1164
01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:49.780
Or who is a person who comes to mind for you and why?
Yeah.

1165
01:11:49.781 --> 01:11:52.680
I've racked my brain over this question because I know it's a standard,

1166
01:11:52.681 --> 01:11:57.681
a Ferris podcast question and I don't have a answer than anybody would recognize

1167
01:11:57.901 --> 01:12:02.901
because I can't judge the success of any celebrities or well known people

1168
01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:08.040
because success is such a balance thing and it depends on how happy you are at

1169
01:12:08.041 --> 01:12:12.330
home and how nice you are to the people who are close to you.
So to me,

1170
01:12:12.331 --> 01:12:15.840
the people in my life that I've seen,
um,

1171
01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:19.230
seemed to be very high and success range are a couple of friends.

1172
01:12:19.231 --> 01:12:22.590
These are male friends that run their own business.

1173
01:12:22.591 --> 01:12:24.750
They basically both fit into the same description.

1174
01:12:24.810 --> 01:12:27.570
So they run their own business,
they're a little bit older than me,

1175
01:12:27.930 --> 01:12:31.110
they're businesses,
extremely successful,
but they've scaled it right,

1176
01:12:31.111 --> 01:12:35.070
right back in order to be a lifestyle business and handed off a lot of

1177
01:12:35.071 --> 01:12:38.220
responsibility to their employees and the kind of pay them more because there's

1178
01:12:38.221 --> 01:12:40.950
so much surplus anyway.
And they were like,
okay,

1179
01:12:40.951 --> 01:12:45.300
you deal with all the junk in exchange for you never calling me on the weekends.

1180
01:12:45.330 --> 01:12:49.680
So both these friends work pretty minimal,
like 10 to 20 hours a week.

1181
01:12:49.681 --> 01:12:52.860
And yet somehow they're businesses keep doing better because of this hands off

1182
01:12:52.861 --> 01:12:56.100
approach.
So they're making even more money.
Um,

1183
01:12:56.101 --> 01:13:00.290
but yet they have a fairly mustache in lifestyle.
And this is probably because I,

1184
01:13:00.430 --> 01:13:03.010
I met these guys through the blog and then they,

1185
01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:06.260
they both have kids and they've really,
really good relationships with their,

1186
01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:07.330
their children.

1187
01:13:07.331 --> 01:13:11.280
They're semi adult children and their wife and basically just really good shape,

1188
01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:14.370
physical shape.
They do a lot of adventures.
They always say yes,

1189
01:13:14.371 --> 01:13:18.090
if I invite them to do something,
they're like,
oh yeah,
that's sure we'll,

1190
01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:21.720
we'll fly over and meet you in that random spot for some mountain biking or

1191
01:13:21.721 --> 01:13:23.250
whatever.
So they've come,

1192
01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:27.780
they've managed to combine all of these dimensions of what most people want in a

1193
01:13:27.781 --> 01:13:32.580
kind of a carefree way.
And,
and they're not overly focused on any one of them,

1194
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.550
which allows them to be extremely fun people to be around.

1195
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:40.410
So that's my definition of success and that's what I kind of hope for for
myself.

1196
01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:44.190
By the time I'm like 50 years old with a pretty old kid.

1197
01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:47.760
We're,
we're on the flip side,

1198
01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:51.330
we talked about what some of the critics get wrong.

1199
01:13:51.331 --> 01:13:54.630
What perhaps media sometimes misinterpret,

1200
01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:59.550
where do weird your fans get it wrong?

1201
01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:04.580
What are the most common mistakes that your readers make or misinterpretations?

1202
01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:09.870
Uh,
when,
when did they get the message wrong?
That's pretty rare.

1203
01:14:09.930 --> 01:14:13.300
I find it's a,
it's pretty there.
I ride a lot of stuff,
right?

1204
01:14:13.301 --> 01:14:14.740
So anybody who reads a lot,

1205
01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:20.310
they'll see all the little nuances and bits in what I try to express as a

1206
01:14:21.431 --> 01:14:26.410
philosophy.
But for those of them,
um,
those readers who don't have other details,

1207
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.710
a lot of people assume that I'm very,
you know,

1208
01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:33.310
like I would be mad at them if I ever found out that they bought something

1209
01:14:33.311 --> 01:14:35.680
luxurious.
Like,
Oh,
don't tell Mr Money Mustache,

1210
01:14:35.681 --> 01:14:39.910
I bought this $2,000 mountain bike because I really love bikes.
But you know,

1211
01:14:39.911 --> 01:14:42.220
everything else is good.
And like,
I don't,

1212
01:14:42.490 --> 01:14:47.410
I don't judge people to nearly the standards that they think I judge them too.

1213
01:14:48.730 --> 01:14:50.020
So,
and,
uh,

1214
01:14:50.050 --> 01:14:53.830
the other thing is it's the same for people who don't know my real life.

1215
01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:58.000
They often assume that it's pretty spartan.
And then I'm always penny pinching.

1216
01:14:58.001 --> 01:15:01.970
And this goes back to the same answer with the New Yorker article too,
but,
um,

1217
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:04.630
I'm,
I'm really,
I'm really in favor of,

1218
01:15:05.230 --> 01:15:09.130
of celebrating and decadence and,
and feeling like stuff is luxurious.

1219
01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:13.930
So,
uh,
so I'm really not as minimalist as people people think I am.

1220
01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:18.490
I'm really maximalist in the fun department.
Besides these studio,

1221
01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:23.300
what are some of those luxuries?
And we could tie that into,
uh,

1222
01:15:24.130 --> 01:15:29.130
let's limit it to purchases that have most positively impacted your life or that

1223
01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:32.100
you just love because they're so damn fun for you.
What,
what does,

1224
01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:37.000
what are some of those things?
Um,
while some of them,
some of it is vacations.

1225
01:15:37.090 --> 01:15:41.020
So since,
um,
since retiring from real jobs,

1226
01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:46.860
my wife and I have had a nice tradition of going somewhere semi-tropical every

1227
01:15:47.201 --> 01:15:48.760
winter for a good long period.

1228
01:15:49.150 --> 01:15:52.660
Most windows at least sometimes the school schedule messes it up a bit,
but,

1229
01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:53.531
but yeah,

1230
01:15:53.531 --> 01:15:58.210
for a month or more we'll often go and so we spend some money on these vacations

1231
01:15:58.211 --> 01:16:00.340
and we'll rent a nice house on a beach.

1232
01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:04.600
I'm like in Florida or Hawaii or Costa Rica or whatever.

1233
01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:07.330
So vacations,
um,

1234
01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:10.630
most of the money goes to rent basically like Vrvo type stuff.

1235
01:16:10.631 --> 01:16:15.631
AIRBNB is one example of indulgences that I still have a lot of warm memories

1236
01:16:16.001 --> 01:16:20.140
from.
And I really like knowing that I can do that at any time.

1237
01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:24.500
So even when I'm not on vacation right now,
in January,
and uh,

1238
01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.040
sometimes if the cold weather blows in,
I think,
man,

1239
01:16:27.041 --> 01:16:30.910
I could just press a few buttons on this computer and just fly right out to

1240
01:16:30.911 --> 01:16:35.520
anybody's Vrvo and be there within like a day or two.
And,
uh,

1241
01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:38.530
just having that freedom is a form of luxury in itself.

1242
01:16:38.890 --> 01:16:43.780
And then I can go out and shovel some snow and be happy about it.
And,
uh,

1243
01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:47.110
yeah,
the other purchases,
um,
nothing's really expensive,

1244
01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:51.910
but when I built out the current house,
the main house rather than the studio,

1245
01:16:51.911 --> 01:16:54.190
I was feeling pretty rich at the time.
So I,

1246
01:16:54.970 --> 01:16:56.740
I went a bit high end on some of this stuff.

1247
01:16:56.741 --> 01:17:00.670
Like I have this really gorgeous high efficiency wood burning wood stove,

1248
01:17:00.671 --> 01:17:05.050
fireplace thing that brings me pleasure every day even though it's more

1249
01:17:05.051 --> 01:17:07.150
expensive than a,
you know,

1250
01:17:07.151 --> 01:17:11.450
then then just a basic fireplace and the window is in my house for example,

1251
01:17:11.451 --> 01:17:16.010
are very kind of these fancy windows that cost about five times more than than

1252
01:17:16.011 --> 01:17:20.510
it would have cost if I'd gone bare bones.
So it's usually stuff related to home,

1253
01:17:20.511 --> 01:17:22.770
vacation and food.
You know,

1254
01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:27.800
we've been known to go out for Sushi a bit more than a person in debt should go

1255
01:17:28.671 --> 01:17:32.150
into Sushi.
So we take advantage of our non debt status.

1256
01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:35.660
That's the,
it's really not too much though.
Yeah.

1257
01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:41.120
Do you have any favorite documentaries or movies?
My favorite,
uh,

1258
01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:42.860
I'm actually got a huge,
huge,

1259
01:17:42.861 --> 01:17:45.620
less of documentaries that I've been meaning to watch.

1260
01:17:45.621 --> 01:17:50.480
Many of them collected from the,
from the guests on your,
um,
tools of titans book.

1261
01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:55.340
But the one that I did watch and enjoy is actually a series rather than

1262
01:17:55.341 --> 01:18:00.200
documentary,
but the,
um,
the cosmos that the remake of plasma,

1263
01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:04.090
the older grass Dyson.
Yeah.
I love Neil degrasse Tyson and uh,

1264
01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:07.550
I love his awkward but scientific way.

1265
01:18:07.551 --> 01:18:12.551
And the topics he covered in those in those episodes were like so stunning and

1266
01:18:13.431 --> 01:18:17.660
it was a great education for my son who is very,
very into science himself.

1267
01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:20.480
Um,
so that's kind of like,

1268
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:24.710
that's the documentary that stands out in my mind.
The great,

1269
01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:28.350
the most interesting thing in the last five years.
Anyway.
Yeah,
it's a,

1270
01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:29.720
it's a fantastic series.

1271
01:18:29.721 --> 01:18:33.860
I've been hoping in meaning to have Neil on the podcast.

1272
01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:37.310
We've had I guess some,
some indirect email exchanges.

1273
01:18:37.311 --> 01:18:39.110
So if anybody's good buddies with Neil,

1274
01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:42.230
give him a poke and let them know that it's totally tapped him on the podcast.

1275
01:18:44.210 --> 01:18:49.130
If you were to give a Ted talk on something that you are not known for,

1276
01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:54.500
what would you give it on?
So any,

1277
01:18:54.501 --> 01:18:57.950
any kind of pet obsession or something your lesser known for maybe your die hard

1278
01:18:57.951 --> 01:19:01.040
fans who've read every single line of everything you've ever written would have

1279
01:19:01.041 --> 01:19:05.930
heard of it.
But,
uh,
yeah,
if you had to get think I do have an answer.
Yeah.

1280
01:19:05.931 --> 01:19:10.070
So if you define the thing that I'm known for as the early retirement,

1281
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:11.750
Mr money mustache stuff,

1282
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:17.270
then the other topic that I'm super passionate about is,
is energy.

1283
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:22.270
And I'm like the world energy balance and solar power and how the humans,

1284
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:26.450
how humans consume it and how we can basically fix our energy consumption

1285
01:19:26.451 --> 01:19:28.400
related to climate change and all this stuff.

1286
01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:33.850
So I'd probably write one up about that and explain how we're at this insanely

1287
01:19:33.861 --> 01:19:38.861
close tipping point where fossil fuels are just about to be economically

1288
01:19:39.450 --> 01:19:43.040
unfeasible,
even without regulations and stuff.
And,
uh,

1289
01:19:43.041 --> 01:19:46.040
I think that can make a good title Ted talk because a lot of people are,

1290
01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:50.660
you need to popularize the ideas and right now they're kind of dry and numbers

1291
01:19:50.661 --> 01:19:50.991
based,

1292
01:19:50.991 --> 01:19:55.310
like you're talking about terra jewels and kilograms CO2 and all this stuff and

1293
01:19:55.730 --> 01:19:59.840
there's a lot more fun and emotion in that topic if you,
if you package it right.

1294
01:19:59.841 --> 01:20:02.990
So I think that'd be a good talk.
Yeah.
What is your,

1295
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:06.020
like what I've been curious about,
I know you've written about this before,

1296
01:20:06.021 --> 01:20:08.970
but when you are,
if you,

1297
01:20:08.971 --> 01:20:12.300
if you were to think of when you and your,

1298
01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:15.330
when you were in your best physical shape in the last five years,

1299
01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:20.100
what did the exercise regimen look like?
Cause I saw a photograph of you,

1300
01:20:20.101 --> 01:20:24.450
I want to say squatting outside at an outdoor squat rack.
Am I making that up?

1301
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:28.080
Yeah,
that was my most recent blog posts.
Okay.
Starting to get a little old now.

1302
01:20:28.081 --> 01:20:29.550
But yeah.
So

1303
01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:34.170
if you think back to when you were in the best shape and you can define that any

1304
01:20:34.171 --> 01:20:37.750
way you like what,
what did your exercise regimen look like?
Yeah,
it's,

1305
01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:39.510
I might be in,

1306
01:20:39.930 --> 01:20:43.830
in some ways and some of the best shape I'm in my life right now.

1307
01:20:44.370 --> 01:20:48.390
And that is just a pretty casual program,

1308
01:20:48.391 --> 01:20:52.350
but with really efficient barbell exercises combined with just a whole bunch of

1309
01:20:52.351 --> 01:20:57.140
walking and biking construction.
So,
um,
so the,

1310
01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:59.880
the barbell stuff is just squats,
dead lifts,

1311
01:20:59.881 --> 01:21:03.840
clean and press a little bit of benching and stuff with kettlebells and

1312
01:21:03.841 --> 01:21:08.841
dumbbells and generally using weights that I can just barely lift five times.

1313
01:21:11.130 --> 01:21:16.130
And the total expenditure of per week is only in that the order of like an hour

1314
01:21:16.741 --> 01:21:19.110
or two.
So I'm not like a a gym rat.

1315
01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:23.400
I'm so that right now I'm pretty happy with the way my body's working,

1316
01:21:23.401 --> 01:21:28.350
especially for a 41 year old or whatever am.
Um,
but the,

1317
01:21:28.530 --> 01:21:29.011
the strong,

1318
01:21:29.011 --> 01:21:32.310
I was slightly stronger when I was in my twenties and it was basically the same

1319
01:21:32.311 --> 01:21:32.701
stuff,

1320
01:21:32.701 --> 01:21:37.470
but just going to the gym for a longer period and training,

1321
01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.830
it was really just more hours put in.
And that's when I,

1322
01:21:40.050 --> 01:21:44.400
I've probably had my record,
um,
weightlifting in certain exercises.

1323
01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:49.740
Do you lead a quote or any quotes that you live your life by or think of often?

1324
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:53.640
Um,
I don't really think in quotes too often.

1325
01:21:54.450 --> 01:21:59.340
Maybe with the exception of use it or lose it seems to come up at least a couple

1326
01:21:59.341 --> 01:22:00.174
times a day.

1327
01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:05.260
I'd say that's often enough to to be a response.
Yeah.

1328
01:22:05.530 --> 01:22:09.450
It's so short and a and thus memorable.
You don't have to be all flowery,

1329
01:22:09.930 --> 01:22:14.180
poetic to appreciate,
lose,
use it or lose it.
But I think it's because,
uh,

1330
01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:16.860
in the current stage of my life,
uh,

1331
01:22:16.890 --> 01:22:20.250
being over 40 and then having some family members with,
you know,

1332
01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:24.000
some people have died in my family and had serious health problems like in the

1333
01:22:24.001 --> 01:22:25.870
extended family.
And uh,

1334
01:22:25.890 --> 01:22:30.890
it's really made me a more aware of mortality and how stuff doesn't

1335
01:22:31.891 --> 01:22:33.810
automatically stay in perfect condition.

1336
01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:37.110
And even if even if it does stay in perfect condition,

1337
01:22:37.111 --> 01:22:40.290
you're unlikely to live forever unless some really,

1338
01:22:40.291 --> 01:22:44.490
really big medical stuff changes before I turned a hundred.
So anyway,

1339
01:22:44.491 --> 01:22:48.780
I use it or lose it is the philosophy like brain,
body skills,

1340
01:22:48.810 --> 01:22:50.970
friendships,
relationships.

1341
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.410
Just do everything that you want to be good at as often as you can.

1342
01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:56.273
And uh,

1343
01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:59.430
don't fool yourself that you're going to keep being able to do this stuff unless

1344
01:22:59.431 --> 01:23:04.270
you continue doing it regularly in the,
and uh,

1345
01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:05.710
I don't know which,

1346
01:23:06.530 --> 01:23:08.130
<v 1>okay.
Label to use here,</v>

1347
01:23:08.131 --> 01:23:12.850
but in the safe frugality or low costs living world,

1348
01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:17.940
what is the worst advice or what is bad advice that you hear given often?

1349
01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:24.170
<v 2>I think the biggest issue with that I have with a lot of this,</v>

1350
01:23:24.171 --> 01:23:29.171
a mainstream financial advice is that there they make you think of saving as a

1351
01:23:30.891 --> 01:23:35.480
negative,
that kind of a negative obligation.
They're like,
yeah,

1352
01:23:35.481 --> 01:23:39.770
we know it's feels a lot better to buy yourself treats,
but come on and like,

1353
01:23:39.771 --> 01:23:44.360
if you can just squeeze out 5% or even 10%,
then you're,
you're doing okay.

1354
01:23:44.361 --> 01:23:48.940
Just do that every week and make a budget and all this stuff.
And uh,
so you're,

1355
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.130
you're training people to think that saving is bad and you want to minimize it.

1356
01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:56.990
Whereas I think it's a win win and most of our spending is,

1357
01:23:57.230 --> 01:23:58.370
is a sign of weakness.

1358
01:23:58.371 --> 01:24:02.990
And it's a bunch of stuff that we do to compensate for our weaknesses because we

1359
01:24:02.991 --> 01:24:07.400
couldn't solve the problem in a smarter way.
Like as we talked about earlier,

1360
01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:11.870
is possible to walk or bike to work,
which is a physical and mental when,

1361
01:24:12.230 --> 01:24:14.060
and it just happens to cost a lot less.

1362
01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:19.600
So I encourage people to radically reshape their entire lifestyle to be

1363
01:24:19.641 --> 01:24:24.641
optimized and all these dimensions and sure you happen to save 50 to 75% of your

1364
01:24:26.331 --> 01:24:27.980
income as a,
as a byproduct.

1365
01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:32.510
But the only reason that's a win is because your life is better as well.

1366
01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:36.800
And normal financial advice is it doesn't really address the life stuff.

1367
01:24:36.801 --> 01:24:40.370
And you know,
you see a lot of these totally out of shape,

1368
01:24:41.690 --> 01:24:45.740
business guru people trying to sell life insurance at the same time as they're

1369
01:24:45.741 --> 01:24:49.670
giving you financial advice and they're not really,
you know,

1370
01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:53.510
they're not really in it for making people's lives better.
I think that's where,

1371
01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:54.680
that's where it falls flat.

1372
01:24:55.940 --> 01:25:00.530
<v 1>Yeah,
for sure.
And
Yeah,
it's uh,</v>

1373
01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:05.850
it's important I think certainly in,
in almost every area,
but in the,

1374
01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:11.030
the world of financial planning and advice to ensure that the person giving the

1375
01:25:11.401 --> 01:25:13.800
advice has done what they're suggesting

1376
01:25:15.330 --> 01:25:20.330
or has some practice putting their words into action because otherwise,

1377
01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:24.070
uh,
they haven't stress test their ideas,
uh,

1378
01:25:24.170 --> 01:25:26.930
or at the very worst they're hypocrite and they're doing the opposite of them.

1379
01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:28.993
Uh,

1380
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:30.833
<v 2>okay.</v>

1381
01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:33.290
<v 1>Are there any failures that come to mind,</v>

1382
01:25:33.291 --> 01:25:38.291
which are a favorite failures of yours in the sense that they ended up sowing

1383
01:25:38.481 --> 01:25:42.020
the seeds of a later success?
Does anything like that come to mind for you?

1384
01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:46.970
<v 2>Yeah,
I have a pretty pretty serious one that I call,</v>

1385
01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:48.500
I have an article called Mr money.

1386
01:25:48.501 --> 01:25:53.501
Mustache is big mistake and it's right after I retired in 2005,

1387
01:25:53.541 --> 01:25:58.541
I kind of faded in to a my first dream retirement job,

1388
01:25:58.831 --> 01:26:02.590
which was to start a custom house building company where I was going to make

1389
01:26:02.591 --> 01:26:06.530
these beautiful ecofriendly houses or did actually we started making these

1390
01:26:06.531 --> 01:26:11.090
houses and um,
and the problem was it was way,

1391
01:26:11.091 --> 01:26:14.810
way more stressful than,
than what I wanted for retirement job.

1392
01:26:14.811 --> 01:26:19.310
And I just had this new baby boy at the same time and suddenly I had all these

1393
01:26:19.311 --> 01:26:21.980
obligations and like a construction loan to build this thing.

1394
01:26:21.981 --> 01:26:26.981
And I was doing marketing and working late and wrangling all these cats

1395
01:26:27.651 --> 01:26:32.390
together,
like the contractors to help out building the places.
And uh,

1396
01:26:32.410 --> 01:26:35.480
it wasn't really retirement at all.
And on top of that,

1397
01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:39.800
we did it right in time for the housing crisis.

1398
01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:44.800
So like we sold our first house into the 2006 boom market for housing,

1399
01:26:45.231 --> 01:26:49.790
but then by the time the second one was done as 2007 and everything was slowing

1400
01:26:49.791 --> 01:26:53.210
down and then starting to drop like a rock and then I was stuck with this

1401
01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:57.020
beautiful ready to sell house and nobody wanted to buy it for any kind of

1402
01:26:57.021 --> 01:27:01.760
reasonable sum.
So that was kind of soiled.

1403
01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:05.810
The fund spoiled the fund of my first three years of retirement is running this

1404
01:27:05.811 --> 01:27:08.270
company.
Um,
at the same time though,

1405
01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:12.710
going through hardship was,
was really good for me.

1406
01:27:12.711 --> 01:27:14.930
I had to do a lot of hard stuff that I wouldn't have done.

1407
01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:18.580
And that's how I learned a lot of my,
um,

1408
01:27:18.710 --> 01:27:22.600
best carpentry stuff.
You know,
the skills that I'm most skilled,

1409
01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:24.900
I'm most proud of is,
uh,

1410
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:27.920
like as I've always messed around with woodworking since I was a little kid,

1411
01:27:27.921 --> 01:27:32.690
but by being forced into production on these expensive modernist houses where

1412
01:27:32.691 --> 01:27:33.710
everything has to be perfect,

1413
01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:37.220
it really trained me a lot and I enjoy those skills now.

1414
01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:41.540
So the combination of shittiness and skills and then,

1415
01:27:41.930 --> 01:27:43.280
then we shut this company down.

1416
01:27:43.281 --> 01:27:48.281
And since then I've been truly retired and had so much more fun looking back and

1417
01:27:49.071 --> 01:27:53.210
like,
wow,
I'm sure glad I'm not doing that anymore.
So it lost a bunch of money.

1418
01:27:53.211 --> 01:27:57.370
You know,
some of my retirement savings went up in smoke initially.
Um,

1419
01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:00.800
and then I was started to be a bit more worried about money.

1420
01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:04.370
That was a big part of it cause I was like,
oh my hard earned savings.

1421
01:28:05.390 --> 01:28:08.030
And if I could go back and change that,

1422
01:28:08.630 --> 01:28:11.210
I would probably still do it.

1423
01:28:11.211 --> 01:28:15.470
But I would train myself to be just so much more relaxed about and be like,
dude,

1424
01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:15.861
don't worry.

1425
01:28:15.861 --> 01:28:18.620
You're going to have so much fun after this and you're not going to run out of

1426
01:28:18.621 --> 01:28:23.030
money,
so just have good time with your business.
Um,
even if even if it fails,

1427
01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:27.920
what was the process like of shutting it down in the sense that,

1428
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:32.950
was there particular dinner or conversation or bike ride or a moment when you

1429
01:28:36.141 --> 01:28:40.430
decided to start the process of shutting it down and how did that,

1430
01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:43.280
what did that look like?
Well it was pretty,

1431
01:28:43.810 --> 01:28:48.320
it was pretty quick cause I bought these two vacant lots and kind of a premium

1432
01:28:48.321 --> 01:28:51.730
new urbanist neighborhood with my business partner and the,

1433
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:53.570
and the company.

1434
01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:58.100
And then we started building the first one and it was the aforementioned stress

1435
01:28:58.101 --> 01:29:01.350
was high and was like,
Oh shit,
what have I gotten myself into?
Okay,

1436
01:29:01.351 --> 01:29:03.600
let's just get these things done and then be done with it.

1437
01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:07.620
So then I got the first one done and then like,
Woo,
that was great.
You know,

1438
01:29:07.621 --> 01:29:11.160
big success.
It sold for more than we were even asking for it.

1439
01:29:11.610 --> 01:29:15.960
And then the second one,
um,
God more and more stressful.

1440
01:29:15.961 --> 01:29:19.620
And I already knew before I even started that second one that I wanted to shut

1441
01:29:19.621 --> 01:29:22.950
down the business afterwards.
It just got drawn out longer.

1442
01:29:23.310 --> 01:29:25.530
And then we got into like renting it out,

1443
01:29:25.531 --> 01:29:29.100
but then the tenants turned out to be horrible and they had these like scam

1444
01:29:29.101 --> 01:29:32.640
artists move in that we didn't realize were scam artists.
And they were like,

1445
01:29:32.670 --> 01:29:35.760
Oh yeah,
we've got,
we just sent you the rent that's in your mailbox,

1446
01:29:35.761 --> 01:29:38.760
check your mailbox,
click in the hangup and all these like little tricks.

1447
01:29:38.761 --> 01:29:41.130
And the guy had like this,
you know,

1448
01:29:41.131 --> 01:29:45.630
fancy like brand new corvette that he had bought and he had to hide it in the

1449
01:29:45.631 --> 01:29:49.050
garage cause the repo man would take it back if he ever saw it outside.

1450
01:29:49.051 --> 01:29:50.520
So all he could do is like pull it out,

1451
01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:53.160
Polish it and rev it and then put it back in the garage.

1452
01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:57.390
And these people were just really messed up and I happen to get tangled in their

1453
01:29:57.391 --> 01:29:59.400
web for awhile and we had to use the,
uh,

1454
01:29:59.550 --> 01:30:03.690
the full on eviction with like sheriff come into the door to get them out of my

1455
01:30:03.691 --> 01:30:07.470
place.
And,
uh,
so yeah,
there was some education in there.

1456
01:30:08.090 --> 01:30:10.800
It sounds like a headache.
Uh,

1457
01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:15.510
what did it feel like when was it finally done?

1458
01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:20.430
Shut down completely.
And what did,
what did that day feel like?
Um,

1459
01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:21.580
I'd say it was shut down.

1460
01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:25.290
One of the biggest problems with this is that the relationship between me and my

1461
01:30:25.291 --> 01:30:28.780
friend who started in business partner,
it does,

1462
01:30:28.781 --> 01:30:31.440
it just soured and it became pretty bad by the end.

1463
01:30:31.441 --> 01:30:35.970
And we had totally different views about work and money and dividing stuff up.

1464
01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:39.300
So we finally got him out of there by,

1465
01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:42.810
I basically had to buy out the company.
I had to put,

1466
01:30:42.811 --> 01:30:47.811
like I'd lost all this money and I had to put like a final $460,000 into the

1467
01:30:47.851 --> 01:30:50.340
company to pay off this mortgage that was on the house.

1468
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:53.570
I'm just to kick him off the,
the deed,

1469
01:30:53.571 --> 01:30:55.680
the property deed so that I could have control of it.

1470
01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:59.730
So that day was kind of like,
you know,
we're like frowning at each other,

1471
01:30:59.731 --> 01:31:02.040
over the lawyer's table or whatever.

1472
01:31:02.610 --> 01:31:06.630
And then since then that that lifted the weight off of me and then everything

1473
01:31:06.631 --> 01:31:07.800
was so much better.

1474
01:31:08.250 --> 01:31:12.180
And then for awhile I rented out the house to great tenants and I hadn't in that

1475
01:31:12.181 --> 01:31:12.781
situation,

1476
01:31:12.781 --> 01:31:16.890
I was just using the rent for kind of our grocery money because that house was a

1477
01:31:16.891 --> 01:31:20.790
fairly big portion of our retirement savings,
uh,
income at the time.

1478
01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:24.870
And then more recently,
I think just less than two years ago,
I,

1479
01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:29.010
the market in our area here in Colorado started to boom again.

1480
01:31:29.011 --> 01:31:32.190
So I just sold it for a nice high price.

1481
01:31:32.191 --> 01:31:35.790
And then now I've been super relaxed and then that's kind of like another wave.

1482
01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:41.280
And it really taught me a lot about happiness because this negativity in my

1483
01:31:41.281 --> 01:31:44.460
life,
or at least I was choosing to perceive it negatively,

1484
01:31:44.461 --> 01:31:49.461
it was washed away and then suddenly I was happier than I could've ever imagined

1485
01:31:49.921 --> 01:31:51.170
being,
um,

1486
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:56.580
because I'd gone through this somewhat hellish situation and then remove the

1487
01:31:56.581 --> 01:32:00.100
negative.
Yeah.
Which,
uh,

1488
01:32:00.150 --> 01:32:02.770
<v 1>is,
is such a valuable question.
I,</v>

1489
01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:07.800
the question to ask before purchase that that alone will return a hundred x the

1490
01:32:12.211 --> 01:32:15.240
effort of scheduling and doing this interview.
For me,

1491
01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:17.400
that question is this removing a negative from my life?

1492
01:32:17.410 --> 01:32:22.140
That's such a powerful reframe because I think that is so true.
Uh,

1493
01:32:22.141 --> 01:32:26.290
and so,
so incredibly useful,
but did the next,

1494
01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:29.880
which is going to be completely flipping that on its head.

1495
01:32:30.670 --> 01:32:32.450
And this is not one of my usual questions,

1496
01:32:32.451 --> 01:32:36.430
but I'm so curious to know how you'll answer this.
Okay.

1497
01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:40.300
If you had had to spend,

1498
01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:44.140
you were given $100,000 and they said you have to spend this,

1499
01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:48.580
you have to buy something or some things you cannot donate,

1500
01:32:48.670 --> 01:32:53.590
donate it to charity.
Uh,
you cannot stick it into an investment vehicle.

1501
01:32:54.130 --> 01:32:57.120
You have to spend it.
Okay.
And it has to be on you,

1502
01:32:57.121 --> 01:32:58.800
your family or your close friends.

1503
01:32:58.801 --> 01:33:03.801
But it can't be charitable in the sense that you're say parent paying for the

1504
01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:07.390
college tuition of your friends' kids and so on.
Nothing like that.
How,

1505
01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:08.860
how would you spend that?
What would you do with that?

1506
01:33:09.210 --> 01:33:10.920
<v 2>That was my answer.
You just took my answer.</v>

1507
01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:14.280
I knew because I felt like it was coming cause I could pay off somebody's

1508
01:33:14.281 --> 01:33:18.060
mortgage.
There's still one family member in my close family that has a mortgage.

1509
01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:20.940
But,
but yeah,
we want,
we want to consume here.
Um,

1510
01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:24.630
can I have more than a hundred thousand?
Sure,
sure.
No,
it's not limited.

1511
01:33:24.630 --> 01:33:25.800
<v 1>It's not limited.
This is just,</v>

1512
01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:30.720
let's just say that you took a step into bizarro land where everything was what

1513
01:33:30.721 --> 01:33:33.900
it wasn't and suddenly you are the Anti Mustache,
right?

1514
01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:38.980
<v 2>Yeah.
And what w what would you do?
Well,
the thing is,</v>

1515
01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:44.280
this might actually be somewhat realistic because I still consider every day,

1516
01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:48.640
you know,
is there something I could spend money on,
um,
that would be worth it.

1517
01:33:48.641 --> 01:33:51.850
It's still an open question.
You don't want to be ideological about this stuff.

1518
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:52.743
But,

1519
01:33:52.810 --> 01:33:57.010
so one thing I've been interested in maybe buying and if I was forced to,

1520
01:33:57.011 --> 01:33:59.200
I would do it quickly,
is a,
is a building,

1521
01:33:59.710 --> 01:34:02.590
I kind of want to own a commercial building on our towns,

1522
01:34:02.591 --> 01:34:06.370
little historic main street.
This town I live in,
Longmont,

1523
01:34:06.371 --> 01:34:10.300
Colorado is kind of one of these over a hundred year old things where it's all

1524
01:34:10.301 --> 01:34:14.830
historic with big trees and the narrow main street with a tall brick buildings

1525
01:34:14.831 --> 01:34:19.510
on it.
So I could buy one of those.
And then set up,
you know,

1526
01:34:19.511 --> 01:34:22.690
some kind of fun community space in there where we,

1527
01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:26.860
we play music and we have parties and we rented out and do some teaching too.

1528
01:34:26.861 --> 01:34:27.720
Cause I like to,
uh,

1529
01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:32.440
do a bit of volunteer math and science teaching two,
uh,

1530
01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:36.430
two kids kind of advanced stuff that they don't get in the normal school.

1531
01:34:36.431 --> 01:34:39.130
So I could have like professor mustaches,

1532
01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:44.440
School of Science in my downtown building so that that'd be kind of a fun use of

1533
01:34:44.441 --> 01:34:45.430
money.
Yeah.

1534
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:48.630
<v 1>This is more of course a,
a metaphorical question,</v>

1535
01:34:48.631 --> 01:34:53.540
but if you could have one gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it,
um,

1536
01:34:53.610 --> 01:34:57.650
what would it say,
you know,
short message or image that like to

1537
01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:00.700
<v 2>impart to the world?
Right.</v>

1538
01:35:00.701 --> 01:35:04.300
I'm picturing this in a u s metropolis because that's kind of where I'm focusing

1539
01:35:04.301 --> 01:35:07.210
my efforts right now.
So I think I would say,

1540
01:35:07.211 --> 01:35:11.350
I think it would say walk or maybe you'd say just walk something that people can

1541
01:35:11.351 --> 01:35:16.260
really understand quickly.
I like without getting,
yeah,

1542
01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:20.080
back to our original thoughts.
It's the under,

1543
01:35:20.250 --> 01:35:24.860
it's the best prescription medication in the world and yet it's so under done so

1544
01:35:24.861 --> 01:35:25.694
far.

1545
01:35:25.870 --> 01:35:29.920
<v 1>So that's my billboard.
Yeah.
It's,
we've made as a species,</v>

1546
01:35:29.921 --> 01:35:34.921
so many evolutionary trade offs to be able to walk with a level head.

1547
01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:40.000
Unlike Sam pig that doesn't have a nuchal ligaments and their heads bobble over

1548
01:35:40.001 --> 01:35:43.840
the place,
like we've evolved to be able to,

1549
01:35:44.730 --> 01:35:48.450
as it would seem a survival imperative,
walk very long distances.

1550
01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:53.990
And I just feel like humans are generally better humans and lesson erotic when

1551
01:35:55.261 --> 01:35:59.410
they walk a lot.
Uh,
at least that's true for me.
I'll speak for myself.
Uh,

1552
01:35:59.550 --> 01:36:04.410
I'm like 10% less neurotic,
which is a win for me.

1553
01:36:05.170 --> 01:36:06.550
<v 2>Billboard could say,
just walk,</v>

1554
01:36:06.551 --> 01:36:10.060
you've paid a high evolutionary price for this ability and let's not squander
it.

1555
01:36:12.230 --> 01:36:16.970
<v 1>What,
what are,
what are one of your biggest challenges right now?</v>

1556
01:36:17.710 --> 01:36:20.860
How do you plan to think about it or face it?

1557
01:36:21.110 --> 01:36:26.110
<v 2>I think my biggest challenge is the over satisfied rat in a cage syndrome where,</v>

1558
01:36:30.250 --> 01:36:34.090
uh,
it's a fine line between being too satisfied.
You are with your life,

1559
01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:38.870
with your life and not doing enough.
So that you feel like a bit of a,

1560
01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:42.740
a Weenie at the end of the day for squandering one of the few days of your life,

1561
01:36:43.630 --> 01:36:48.360
uh,
versus overdrive and yourself to be like,
Whoa,
I've got to accomplish more.

1562
01:36:48.361 --> 01:36:50.480
You know,
I have all these gifts and,

1563
01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:52.980
and great situations and I have to make the most of it.

1564
01:36:53.550 --> 01:36:56.960
And taking either of those two extremes,
um,

1565
01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:01.100
can lead to a pretty unsatisfying life.
And this often,

1566
01:37:01.101 --> 01:37:05.820
I often compare myself actually because um,
this is a little bit weird,

1567
01:37:05.821 --> 01:37:08.210
but to you as Tim Ferris,

1568
01:37:08.230 --> 01:37:11.620
cause I've read some of your books and I see some of your self reflection in

1569
01:37:11.621 --> 01:37:13.360
there where you have some of these battles.
You're like,

1570
01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:16.180
well should I be perfectionist or should I relax?

1571
01:37:16.890 --> 01:37:19.330
And I have a lot of these same questions to myself.

1572
01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:20.710
And one of the differences is that I,

1573
01:37:20.770 --> 01:37:23.650
I chose to have a kid and I focus a lot of energy on that,

1574
01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:27.670
which by definition subtracts a lot of the other stuff I could do.

1575
01:37:27.671 --> 01:37:31.270
Like why am I not running my own kind of Tesla type company or whatever.

1576
01:37:32.050 --> 01:37:36.700
So that's my challenge is,
is trying to walk the line and have the,

1577
01:37:36.701 --> 01:37:41.290
at the end of each day be satisfied that I've created the right balance of like

1578
01:37:41.291 --> 01:37:46.291
stress and accomplishment versus lazy decadents which is part of the fun of

1579
01:37:46.510 --> 01:37:51.510
really being early retired is that you generally can like just smoke a bowl and

1580
01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:55.830
have some fun with your friends on a Wednesday and like sleep and it does not

1581
01:37:55.831 --> 01:37:59.850
matter and you still are going to have all the money that you need no matter

1582
01:37:59.851 --> 01:38:03.650
what.
So,
and that's still,
yeah,
I still have trouble,

1583
01:38:03.651 --> 01:38:07.620
I've been a little bit on the lazy side in the last couple of weeks because of

1584
01:38:07.950 --> 01:38:09.960
family conditions here at home.
And so I'm,

1585
01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:13.440
I'm craving to get back to work on something hard.

1586
01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:18.570
How will you,
how,
how,
how do you think you'll explore that in the coming year?

1587
01:38:18.970 --> 01:38:20.810
Uh,
testing that balance or,

1588
01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:25.710
or trying different things to try to find it or maybe it's,

1589
01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:30.000
maybe it's a matter of just oscillating between the Poles and that's how you

1590
01:38:30.001 --> 01:38:32.490
achieve balance.
It's not like you're never,
it's not like you're ever 50,

1591
01:38:32.491 --> 01:38:35.850
50 for a long period of time.
You just oscillate between the Poles.
I don't know.

1592
01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:37.770
But how are you thinking about that?

1593
01:38:37.771 --> 01:38:41.640
Because I'm also thinking about the same thing in 2017.
Yeah,

1594
01:38:41.641 --> 01:38:45.840
well it's a continuing series of experiments.
Um,
and it's always changing.

1595
01:38:45.841 --> 01:38:47.280
Like I've been at this for a long time.

1596
01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:52.050
It's been 11 years since I had a real job and I've done a lot of hard stuff and

1597
01:38:52.051 --> 01:38:55.590
then a medium amount of laziness in this time.

1598
01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:58.920
So I keep trying stuff to see if I enjoy it.

1599
01:38:58.921 --> 01:39:03.450
So like last August for example,
I wanted to see if I enjoyed the ted talk,

1600
01:39:03.451 --> 01:39:04.830
kind of public speaking,

1601
01:39:04.831 --> 01:39:06.930
and I did a whole bunch of traveling around that as well.

1602
01:39:07.650 --> 01:39:12.270
And I found it was a bit too much.
Like I enjoyed the actual stuff that I did,

1603
01:39:12.271 --> 01:39:14.730
but I was craving being at home.

1604
01:39:14.731 --> 01:39:18.690
And then that's made me realize that most of my joy comes when I'm actually

1605
01:39:18.691 --> 01:39:19.740
creating something.

1606
01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:23.040
And this is why I'm less travel oriented than other people because I can't

1607
01:39:23.041 --> 01:39:24.510
really create,
well I'm traveling,

1608
01:39:25.050 --> 01:39:30.030
so I need to do a certain amount of like nitty gritty construction and design

1609
01:39:30.031 --> 01:39:33.480
and just hanging out and having an unplanned,

1610
01:39:33.481 --> 01:39:37.740
spontaneous people coming over for a party or a barbecue or whatever.

1611
01:39:38.370 --> 01:39:40.220
So I need this village life.
Few.

1612
01:39:40.230 --> 01:39:43.020
Imagine a primitive man living in a village where he spends half the time

1613
01:39:43.021 --> 01:39:44.700
hunting some of the time,

1614
01:39:44.701 --> 01:39:48.270
like building stuff and some of the time reveling around the fire.

1615
01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:53.420
That's kind of my core of happiness and when I get too much into lifestyle guru

1616
01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:54.411
activities like,
oh,

1617
01:39:54.411 --> 01:39:57.150
I'm going to publish more articles or get this book done quickly,

1618
01:39:57.420 --> 01:40:01.410
or say yes to all these interviews so I can have more and more fans and page

1619
01:40:01.411 --> 01:40:05.820
views.
Those things sound actually,
they sound dumb when I say it like that,

1620
01:40:05.821 --> 01:40:08.580
but when you look at the,
you know,

1621
01:40:08.581 --> 01:40:11.850
when you look at news headlines about yourself,
you're like,
that's successful.

1622
01:40:11.851 --> 01:40:15.270
Or you look at page views or money,
you go,
yeah,
that's success,

1623
01:40:15.690 --> 01:40:18.540
but it's actually good.
Kind of the least happy thing that I do,

1624
01:40:18.541 --> 01:40:20.340
it's the least satisfaction bringing.

1625
01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:24.390
So I have to balance that with,
um,

1626
01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:27.730
with these much more village type of activities.
But if I die,

1627
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:30.330
if I totally neglect the internet world,

1628
01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:35.960
then I'll feel like I'm letting the world down because you can actually create

1629
01:40:36.871 --> 01:40:41.160
good positive change that way that you could never do just in your own village.

1630
01:40:41.610 --> 01:40:42.443
Right.

1631
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:48.830
What have you changed your mind on in the last safe handful of years?

1632
01:40:48.901 --> 01:40:53.350
Is there anything that you've done an about face on in any way or modified

1633
01:40:53.351 --> 01:40:54.130
substantially

1634
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:54.963
<v 1>and your thinking?</v>

1635
01:40:55.380 --> 01:40:58.220
<v 2>Um,
there've been a few little things,</v>

1636
01:40:58.550 --> 01:41:03.300
like what type of eating as healthy.
I kind of switched to the,
uh,

1637
01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:08.160
the high fat,
low carb eating on a whim after reading some books.
And uh,

1638
01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:11.110
I'm really,
really happy with that.
Whereas before,
when I was a teenager,

1639
01:41:11.111 --> 01:41:15.670
I was the ultimate low fat because I read all these bodybuilding magazines back

1640
01:41:15.671 --> 01:41:19.310
then and they were always telling you like,
Oh yeah,
10 grams of fat.

1641
01:41:19.311 --> 01:41:21.260
It would be way too much to have and other stuff.

1642
01:41:21.860 --> 01:41:23.960
So that was a change in a little way.

1643
01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:25.433
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1644
01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:30.270
<v 2>The biggest change I've had though is more in my understanding of happiness.
Uh,</v>

1645
01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:32.590
I thought that happiness came from,

1646
01:41:34.050 --> 01:41:36.480
from maximum achievement and maximum wealth.

1647
01:41:37.170 --> 01:41:42.170
And as I got into experimenting with those things sounds too much like my other

1648
01:41:42.231 --> 01:41:42.561
answer,

1649
01:41:42.561 --> 01:41:47.360
but I learned much more about the balance that's required for happiness.

1650
01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:52.570
So it's changed my goals for the rest of my life is that there's a lot more to

1651
01:41:52.571 --> 01:41:55.060
happiness than just being maxed out in one dimension.

1652
01:41:55.780 --> 01:42:00.000
<v 1>So I only have a few questions left.
I'm having a lot of fun.
I mean,</v>

1653
01:42:00.001 --> 01:42:04.270
we could keep going for many,
many hours,
but uh,

1654
01:42:05.190 --> 01:42:10.110
do you have any ask or request of my audience?
Uh,

1655
01:42:10.230 --> 01:42:13.970
any experiment you'd like them to do,
exercise,
anything.

1656
01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:16.720
It could really be anything but uh,
any,

1657
01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:21.550
any parting thoughts before I ask you where people can find out more about you

1658
01:42:21.551 --> 01:42:23.950
and so on?
Right.
Well

1659
01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:26.920
<v 2>if you are new to this stuff that I talk about,</v>

1660
01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:30.090
then I would suggest and if any of that,

1661
01:42:30.170 --> 01:42:33.880
if anything that I am advocating sounds crazy.
Like,
for example,

1662
01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:39.300
not using a car to get your groceries or not using car to get to work,

1663
01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:44.800
then try it and think of the idea of voluntary hardship to put this at phrase

1664
01:42:45.531 --> 01:42:49.160
into your mind and then see where you can apply it through the day,

1665
01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:53.160
and then you're like,
hey,
that looks hard.
I think I'm going to do it instead of,

1666
01:42:53.161 --> 01:42:54.870
that looks hard.
I'm going to try to avoid it.

1667
01:42:55.770 --> 01:43:00.770
And voluntary hardship is that the gateway drug to the rest of mustache aneurysm

1668
01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:06.350
and thus being able to save 75% of your silicon valley income while everyone

1669
01:43:06.731 --> 01:43:10.750
else is still broke.
So yeah,
find some things that are hard,

1670
01:43:10.751 --> 01:43:15.580
even if it's just skipping the elevator and taking the stairs up to the 15th

1671
01:43:15.581 --> 01:43:16.414
floor or whatever.

1672
01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:17.713
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1673
01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:20.010
<v 2>Just if the other people are not doing it,</v>

1674
01:43:20.011 --> 01:43:23.910
then that's probably a sign that it's something that you should do and then just

1675
01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:27.110
record your results,
see how much better it makes you feel,

1676
01:43:27.111 --> 01:43:28.910
and then just keep pushing yourself a bit further.

1677
01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:31.400
<v 1>I would echo that,</v>

1678
01:43:33.230 --> 01:43:38.200
spin it slightly differently.
It's not the,
these are complimentary viewpoints.

1679
01:43:38.201 --> 01:43:42.310
But even if people listening,
those folks out there listening,

1680
01:43:42.311 --> 01:43:45.490
if you do not want to focus on saving,

1681
01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:49.210
even if that is not the objective per se,

1682
01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:54.660
voluntary hardship is a fantastic way to short circuit hedonic adaptation where

1683
01:43:56.401 --> 01:43:58.320
you need more and more and more,

1684
01:43:58.350 --> 01:44:03.120
almost like an opiate to satisfy your need for x.

1685
01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:07.440
And I would highly recommend everybody read a letter.

1686
01:44:07.441 --> 01:44:10.640
You can find it in the public domain online.

1687
01:44:10.730 --> 01:44:14.120
I can also find it in tools of titans in a slightly edited fashion,

1688
01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:19.280
but on festivals and fasting.
It's letter 13 from Seneca,

1689
01:44:19.950 --> 01:44:23.180
uh,
Seneca,
the younger two,
Lou killies,

1690
01:44:23.210 --> 01:44:26.450
the moral letters to looky loose on festivals and fasting.

1691
01:44:26.451 --> 01:44:29.870
And it talks about setting aside a few days per month,

1692
01:44:29.871 --> 01:44:34.460
let's say two experienced voluntary hardship in different ways.

1693
01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:35.353
And it is,

1694
01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:40.570
it is such a fascinating psychological trick in,

1695
01:44:41.491 --> 01:44:45.370
in many respects with all sorts of beneficial side effects like cutting down on

1696
01:44:45.550 --> 01:44:50.550
expenses that I think allows you to realize it as possible to recalibrate

1697
01:44:50.951 --> 01:44:55.951
yourself to experience greater happiness and wellbeing without simply adding

1698
01:44:56.171 --> 01:45:00.300
more and more and more.
And more and more,
whether that's page views,
money,

1699
01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:03.620
fancy shit,
you don't need it or otherwise.
Uh,
as I've,

1700
01:45:03.621 --> 01:45:07.520
I definitely want to second that notion.
Uh,

1701
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:12.470
Pete work in people find out more about you and uh,
you've,

1702
01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:15.140
you've written a lot.
Where should they,
where should they start also?

1703
01:45:15.141 --> 01:45:17.750
So we're going to find you on social or they say hi,

1704
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:22.230
where can they read your stuff and where should they start?
If,
if,
if there,

1705
01:45:22.930 --> 01:45:26.320
they're just opening the doors to your writing.

1706
01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:28.510
Okay.

1707
01:45:28.510 --> 01:45:32.740
<v 2>I'm a big fan of old fashioned websites,
so there's always Mr money,</v>

1708
01:45:32.741 --> 01:45:37.450
mustache.com and you'll see start here button on there and that takes you kind

1709
01:45:37.451 --> 01:45:38.830
of to an introductory article.

1710
01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:44.270
And then the design of the website to the limited extent that it has a design is

1711
01:45:44.271 --> 01:45:48.380
just to poke around and follow links to other links and or you can start at the

1712
01:45:48.381 --> 01:45:51.890
beginning and read all the 400 plus articles,
uh,

1713
01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:56.170
dating back to 2012 or 2011.
And uh,
yeah,

1714
01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:58.380
that's how most people do it.
And then you can read it.
Yeah.

1715
01:45:58.990 --> 01:46:00.850
If you get really into the rabbit hole,

1716
01:46:00.851 --> 01:46:04.570
then there's a forum where like all these users discuss their intimate problems

1717
01:46:04.571 --> 01:46:08.380
with each other and it's got like tens of thousands of members that spend all

1718
01:46:08.380 --> 01:46:11.910
day on there and uh,
or you can just for keeping it really light,

1719
01:46:11.911 --> 01:46:16.800
you can just go to Twitter and look up Mr. Money Mustache and uh,
let's say,

1720
01:46:16.801 --> 01:46:18.120

Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that

1734
01:47:09.781 --> 01:47:11.400
I've been pondering over the week.

1735
01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:14.340
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1736
01:47:14.341 --> 01:47:17.790
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1737
01:47:17.791 --> 01:47:22.140
somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

1738
01:47:22.410 --> 01:47:27.410
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

1739
01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:30.780
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

1740
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:35.850

This episode is brought to you by wealth front.

1746
01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:53.580
Wealth Front is the future of financial advice.

1747
01:47:53.581 --> 01:47:57.990
They become incredibly popular among my friends in silicon valley and across the

1748
01:47:57.991 --> 01:48:02.100
country because they provide the same high end financial advice that the best

1749
01:48:02.101 --> 01:48:04.410
private wealth managers deliver to the ultra wealthy.

1750
01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:08.790
But for any account size and at a fraction of the cost,
for instance,

1751
01:48:08.791 --> 01:48:12.450
they monitor your portfolio every day across more than it does an asset classes

1752
01:48:12.451 --> 01:48:16.800
to look for opportunities to rebalance or harvest tax losses.
Now,

1753
01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:21.300
would you do the same?
Are you doing the same?
Probably not.

1754
01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:25.830
And the powers in the software wealth front now manages more than $4 billion in

1755
01:48:25.831 --> 01:48:28.770
assets,
which is up from around 2.5 billion.

1756
01:48:28.770 --> 01:48:30.450
When they started advertising on this podcast,

1757
01:48:30.630 --> 01:48:34.950
they're growing incredibly quickly.
Unlike old fashioned private wealth managers,

1758
01:48:34.951 --> 01:48:37.260
wealth front is powered by innovative technology,

1759
01:48:37.530 --> 01:48:42.000
making it the most tax efficient,
low cost,
hassle free way to invest.

1760
01:48:42.690 --> 01:48:45.480
They don't have bloated sales teams or retail locations,

1761
01:48:45.620 --> 01:48:49.710
so they can deliver all of this sophisticated financial advice and the services

1762
01:48:49.711 --> 01:48:52.710
at a fraction of the cost of a traditional financial advisor.

1763
01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:53.850
So at the very least,

1764
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:58.530
go to wealthfront.com forward slash Tim and take their free risk assessment

1765
01:48:58.531 --> 01:49:01.270
survey.
It only takes a couple of minutes and Wealthfront.

1766
01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:04.230
We'll recommend a personalized portfolio of investments.
In other words,

1767
01:49:04.231 --> 01:49:06.570
they'll tell you exactly where they would put your money,

1768
01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:08.640
so even if you don't use their service,

1769
01:49:08.641 --> 01:49:11.730
you have a huge leg up and you have additional information for making good

1770
01:49:11.731 --> 01:49:12.564
decisions.

1771
01:49:12.930 --> 01:49:16.920
They use investment theory to automate good financial behavior and decisions

1772
01:49:16.921 --> 01:49:18.450
that people typically don't make,

1773

but should so go to wealthfront.com forward slash Tim to get your first 15 k

1776
01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:34.380
Varidesk and I'm actually standing at my own Veritas from right now recording

1777
01:49:34.381 --> 01:49:34.980
this.

1778
01:49:34.980 --> 01:49:38.130
You've probably heard of research that shows have sitting all day is terrible

1779
01:49:38.131 --> 01:49:40.830
for your health.
Sitting is the new smoking,
et Cetera,

1780
01:49:41.310 --> 01:49:46.110
but standing all day isn't necessarily the answer for everyone.

1781
01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:47.500
Sometimes you just want to sit down.

1782
01:49:47.770 --> 01:49:51.640
And that's true for me as well as the middle ground is varidesk varidesks height

1783
01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:56.080
adjustable standing desk solutions allow you to stand when you want to sit,

1784
01:49:56.081 --> 01:49:59.990
when you need to.
And as an example,
I had this set to the lower position.

1785
01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:04.420
This is a large model and it took me clickety clack two seconds to raise this

1786
01:50:04.421 --> 01:50:07.720
thing up and it feels like it has hydraulics effectively because I didn't have

1787
01:50:07.721 --> 01:50:12.250
to use any muscle to do it.
Varidesks converts your existing desk.
For instance,

1788
01:50:12.251 --> 01:50:15.070
if you want to get a tabletop virgin,
which you could put on it,
which is very,

1789
01:50:15.071 --> 01:50:19.780
very cool or cubicle and do a sit stand workstation and allows you to raise your

1790
01:50:19.781 --> 01:50:22.330
desk from a seated to standing position in just seconds,

1791
01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:25.870
ships fully assembled so there's no Allen wrenches screwdrivers required.

1792
01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:28.180
Pull it out of the box,
put it on your desk.

1793
01:50:28.181 --> 01:50:32.110
In the case with this particular model,
no installation or fascinating required.

1794
01:50:32.111 --> 01:50:33.250
There are bunch of different options.

1795

I have one.

1797
