00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.870
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.871 --> 00:00:06.050
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.450
Posting a question.

4
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.640
I'm a cybernetic organism.

5
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.380
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by four sigmatic.</v>

6
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.230
You might remember four sigmatic for their mushroom coffee,

7
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.400
which was created by those clever finished founders and when I first mentioned

8
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.820
that coffee on this podcast,
the product sold out in less than a week.

9
00:00:37.821 --> 00:00:41.870
It lights you up like a Christmas tree,
which can be really useful.
However,

10
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.310
recently I've been testing the opposite side of the spectrum of new product and

11
00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:51.140
that is their Reishi mushroom elixir to help me end my day to get to sleep.

12
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.020
As you guys may know,
longtime listeners,

13
00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:57.740
at least I struggled with insomnia for decades.
I have a largely fixed that,

14
00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:00.860
but still shutting off my monkey brain has never been easy,

15
00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:03.570
still isn't easy very often and I found Reishi,

16
00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:06.950
which I've been fascinated by for a few years now,
has been very,

17
00:01:06.951 --> 00:01:10.880
very effective and calming their old formula.
However,

18
00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:15.800
four sigmatic old formula included Stevia and I like to avoid sweeteners,

19
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.590
all sweeteners for a host of reasons,

20
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.610
and I then just ping them and asked,
hey guys,

21
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.330
I would love to experiment with this and maybe actually suggested,

22
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.780
but I'd like a version without sweeteners if you'd be open to it,

23
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.070
if too much of a headache,
don't worry.

24
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.210
And they are always game for experimentation.

25
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.930
So they created a special custom version without the Stevia,
without sweeteners.

26
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.510
Now it is part of my nightly routine.

27
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.600
Their ratio looks comes in single serving packets,

28
00:01:44.601 --> 00:01:47.570
which are perfect for travel and in fact I'm about to leave the country right

29
00:01:47.571 --> 00:01:51.380
now and I have a packet in front of me that's just going to sit in the end of my

30
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:55.940
carry on bag.
You only need hot water and it mixes very,

31
00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:56.774
very easily.

32
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.370
Here's some recommended copy that they put in the read,

33
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.150
so I'm going to read it and then I'll give you my take quote,
a warning.

34
00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:06.680
For those in the experimental mindset,

35
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.220
Reishi is strong and bitter in parentheses like any great medicine.

36
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.750
So if the bitterness is too much,

37
00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:15.990
I recommend trying it with honey end or nut milk such as almond milk and quote.

38
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.260
So I'm going to say no,

39
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.790
you should suck it up and you should drink the tea because it's not that bitter.

40
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.990
And maybe should take the advice of all Chinese people when they're criticizing

41
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:29.540
younguns when they say Boone should.
Sure.
Cool.

42
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.910
Which means you're not able to eat bitterness.

43
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.940
Bitter is in many cases and indication of things that help liver detoxification

44
00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:39.860
and so on.
Not saying that's the case here,

45
00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:44.630
but I've tested this ratio,
Fletcher on family members,

46
00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:48.470
on friends,
everybody has liked it.
It's a little bit earthy.
It's not that hard.

47
00:02:48.471 --> 00:02:50.960
So I would just say suck it up and no,

48
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.130
don't put in honey or milk or any of that shit.
Just drink the goddamn tea.

49
00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:58.220
It's delicious I think.
Right?
If you like poo air,
that kind of stuff,

50
00:02:58.221 --> 00:03:01.780
that type of tea,
you're going to dig it.
So just try it.
Okay.

51
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.890
Back to then my read.
If you'd like to naturally improve your sleep,

52
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.780
both onset and quality,

53
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:12.781
I think in naturally you might just enjoy this ratio elixir without any sweet

54
00:03:13.371 --> 00:03:17.530
nurse.
It has organic,
Reishi extract,
organic fueled,
mint extract,

55
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:22.030
organic rose hips extract,
organic Tulsi extract.
And that's it.

56
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.190
No fancy stuff,
no artificial watching McCall at anything.

71
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.793
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

72
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.710
<v 1>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.
Every year.</v>

73
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.260
Of course people look for new ways to become healthier,

74
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.770
to take their fitness and so on to the next level.
For me,

75
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.030
step number one is having some form of nutritional insurance.

76
00:04:35.031 --> 00:04:38.840
That's how I would look at it and the nutritional insurance needs to make sure

77
00:04:38.841 --> 00:04:41.570
all of my basic needs are met.

78
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.160
All the boxes checked regardless of travel schedule,
missed meals and so on.

79
00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.150
They're going to be times in the new year when your diet and exercise will get

80
00:04:50.151 --> 00:04:54.860
interrupted.
Life will interrupt it in during those times.
You want a safety net.

81
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.220
I get asked all the time,
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

82
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.130
And my answer is inevitably Athletic Greens,

83
00:05:01.131 --> 00:05:03.620
it is your all in one nutritional insurance.

84
00:05:03.621 --> 00:05:05.360
I recommended it in the four hour body,

85
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.410
did not get paid for that and I travel with it to avoid getting sick.

86
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.410
I take it in the mornings to ensure optimal performance.

87
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.940
It just covers all my basis if I can't get what I need through whole food meals

88
00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:20.330
throughout the rest of the day.

96
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.281
Hello boys and girls.

97
00:05:49.281 --> 00:05:52.940
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

98
00:05:52.941 --> 00:05:56.810
it is my job to explore the stories,
tactic,
strategies,
habits,

99
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.320
etc. Of people who are the best at what they do.

100
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.980
And this episode is a very,
very special episode.

101
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.590
It delivers a lot of the hard tactics,

102
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:10.400
book recommendations and so on that you would expect from one of these

103
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:13.880
conversations.
But it's also very,
very unique.

104
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.720
And I say very unique to bother all of my friends who say that you cannot have a

105
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:19.490
modifier in front of unique.

106
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.190
My guest today is Catherine,
otherwise known as cat hoke.

107
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.700
After being given a second chance of her own,
which we'll get into.

108
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.740
Catherine founded defy ventures,

109
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:35.741
a national nonprofit organization that in quotations transforms the hustle of

110
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:40.340
currently and formerly incarcerated people to find produced groundbreaking

111
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:42.170
results,
including a recidivism rate.

112
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.200
That means being readmitted to prison have less than 5% and an employment rate

113
00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:52.601
of 95% defies vision is to end mass incarceration as we know it.

114
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.710
By using entrepreneurship as a tool to transform legacies and human potential.

115
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.880
Cat is amazing on many,
many different levels,
uh,
personal,

116
00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:03.680
athletic and otherwise.

117
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:08.681
And we're going to dig into the many facets of her life and lessons learned from

118
00:07:10.191 --> 00:07:11.600
her father among many others.

119
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:17.140
Catherine has also been named a make tech human agent of change by wired and one

120
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:22.490
of the 17 global influencers expanding human possibility through technology by

121
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:27.491
Nokia cat also received the MDC partners humanitarian award and was included in

122
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:32.420
Forbes 40 women to watch over 40 she has been named by Fast Company,

123
00:07:32.421 --> 00:07:36.800
one of the 100 most creative people in business and is an Ashoka.

124
00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:40.820
I think I'm getting that right,
a Shokofeh fellow among many,
many other things.

125
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.540
She is the author of the brand new book and this is how I was introduced to her

126
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:49.750
via Seth Goden called a second chance and I recommend that everybody check that

127
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:55.180
out and you can certainly find her end defy on all of the socials,

128
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.800
but we are going to get into every aspect of that and much more.

129
00:08:00.801 --> 00:08:01.581
So without further ado,

130
00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:06.581
please enjoy one of my favorite conversations I've had in a very long time with

131
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.930
Catherine cat hoke.

132
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:15.260
Kat,
welcome to the show.
Thanks Tam.

133
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:21.190
I have been excited to connect with you because I received a barrage of texts

134
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.890
from a mutual friend of ours,
Mr Seth Goden.

135
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:32.720
And I thought we'd start this with something I've been wondering that I actually

136
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:36.110
don't know the answer to,
which is how did you first meet Seth?

137
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.580
<v 3>I sat unsat aspect called email and he responded.</v>

138
00:08:40.581 --> 00:08:44.030
I invited him to five entrust the organization that I run.

139
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:48.500
He used to have a brick and mortar classroom style teaching model where we would

140
00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:52.820
have formerly incarcerated people come to a classroom in New York City.

141
00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:56.070
And then we didn't fight world class faculty to come.

142
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.630
And Seth was someone I really,
really wanted to meet.

143
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.990
I couldn't believe when he said yes.
And then he came and taught,

144
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.800
we call them [inaudible] or entrepreneurs and training.

145
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:10.950
He came and met them and he,
the way that he treated me,

146
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:15.720
it was like I was such an important person and I couldn't believe it.

147
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.520
And then,
uh,
he became my mentor

148
00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:22.650
<v 4>just like that.
It,
I mean that's,</v>

149
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.220
that's a very productive afternoon.

150
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.740
<v 3>I feel like a spoiled Brat.
Yeah.</v>

151
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:31.390
I'm really proud to say that he's not just my mentor but my friend and has

152
00:09:31.391 --> 00:09:33.940
encouraged me to shoot for the moon.

153
00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:39.060
I've done far greater things and I would have expected that I could have done

154
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.030
had it not been for Seth.

155
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:46.780
He's has believed in me when I even have not believed in myself.

156
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.260
<v 4>Well he's,
he's an incredible man.
And we may circle back to Seth,</v>

157
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:56.290
but I want to talk about this cold email because you seem to be good at cold

158
00:09:58.641 --> 00:10:03.290
emails and cold letters and I have to be careful about what I believe on the

159
00:10:03.291 --> 00:10:03.891
Internet for work.

160
00:10:03.891 --> 00:10:08.891
I'm going to circle this back to something that took place a much further back

161
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.950
than you're meeting with south.
But what did the email say?
What did the pitch

162
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.300
<v 3>I should look,
I should look.</v>

163
00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:18.640
And so I cold emailed him in one of our volunteers,

164
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.720
kind of simultaneously cold emailed him,
which always helps.
Um,

165
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.820
but typically when I cold emailed people,

166
00:10:24.821 --> 00:10:29.680
cause I've gotten amazing people to respond through cold email.
Um,

167
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:31.270
a lot of times I just say,

168
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.230
I'm going to change the world and I would like to meet with you to pick your

169
00:10:35.231 --> 00:10:40.000
smart brain for 15 minutes.
And then I'm persistent as how,

170
00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.430
and I sent it back to them like six times.

171
00:10:42.431 --> 00:10:46.510
And sometimes I leave them voicemails as well,
and I'd be friend their assistant.

172
00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:52.020
So that's how I got in to meet with Dunkin Niederauer who is the CEO of the New

173
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.590
York Stock Exchange.

174
00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:58.620
And many people who you would think would not say yes to a cold email,

175
00:10:58.961 --> 00:11:02.500
but when I asked for 15 minutes to pick their smart brain and I tell them

176
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.940
exactly what I want to learn from them too.
It's not like a random,
you know,

177
00:11:06.941 --> 00:11:10.600
I tell them,
you're an expert in this and I need to learn x.
And I,

178
00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:11.800
and I also tell them,

179
00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.630
I can talk really fast and you can kick me out of your office as quickly as you

180
00:11:16.631 --> 00:11:19.450
are if you think it's a waste of time.
So I always give them an out,

181
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.890
not like I need to do that,
but,
um,
and then I just don't stop.

182
00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:28.480
And I was trained in Cutco knife sales,

183
00:11:28.481 --> 00:11:30.520
like door to door stuff.
You know,

184
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.790
and I've been a shameless cold caller.

185
00:11:33.791 --> 00:11:37.240
I used to work for a summit partners of venture capital firms slash private

186
00:11:37.241 --> 00:11:41.860
equity where I would cold call CEOs wanting to get a piece of their pie.

187
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.240
And I don't get her or reject,

188
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:50.680
I don't get hurt by rejection,
I'm able to take it.
And um,

189
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.600
but when I've studied sales,

190
00:11:52.601 --> 00:11:57.601
like most people stop after two or three and I keep going to six and it's

191
00:11:58.181 --> 00:12:00.280
amazing how many people end up saying yes.

192
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.670
And then I always like typical sales trick,

193
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:08.410
I'll throw in like another five seconds of information of something that makes

194
00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:11.050
them go what?
Like I'll tell them something about myself.

195
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:13.600
So I tried to find something about their background that we have in common.

196
00:12:13.601 --> 00:12:17.320
So Tim,
I know that you were a wrestler,
so I would say,
and by the way,

197
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:20.240
I was also a high school wrestler and somebody makes you go what?
Like,

198
00:12:20.241 --> 00:12:21.730
and then gets your attention.

199
00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.470
<v 4>So all right,
we have so much,</v>

200
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.670
so much that we can cover so many different rabbit holes.

201
00:12:28.671 --> 00:12:32.510
We can go down to a few things.
I want to,
I want to flush out a little bit.

202
00:12:32.511 --> 00:12:34.220
So number one,
the CUTCO knives.

203
00:12:34.221 --> 00:12:37.100
I was going to ask you about the CUTCO knives and I'm going to try not to lose

204
00:12:37.101 --> 00:12:39.710
my train of thought here,
but there's so many ways I want to go with this.

205
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:44.240
Such great research.
Of course,
this is Kobe from wrong.

206
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:49.190
Started with selling hamsters at age seven or there abouts.

207
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.090
<v 3>I really went way back.
Yes I did.
Yes I did.</v>

208
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.180
I ran a hamster selling empire.

209
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.080
I would breed them and I had multiple cages and then I sold them back to the pet

210
00:12:59.081 --> 00:13:03.040
shop for a buck a piece my sister took after me and she was breeding rabbits.

211
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:04.360
So we had quite the household

212
00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.730
<v 4>and then selling golf balls.</v>

213
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.810
<v 3>Yeah.
Um,
I would go,
you know,</v>

214
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
take off my shoes and socks and go walk through the disgusting duck muck and,

215
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.910
and get the golf balls.

216
00:13:19.911 --> 00:13:24.911
But then I would also want up the golfers with donuts and all types of other

217
00:13:25.761 --> 00:13:28.340
things as well to increase my profits.
Yes.

218
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.400
<v 4>What is the key to a successful and people listening who are like,</v>

219
00:13:32.401 --> 00:13:34.440
what the fuck is going on right now?
This is all good.

220
00:13:34.441 --> 00:13:37.230
This is all going somewhere.
The CUTCO knives.

221
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.830
So this is door to door and we're talking about like knock,
knock,
wipe the feet.

222
00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:46.310
<v 3>Well,
so in Cutco,
if they were listening might cringe if I say Dora,</v>

223
00:13:46.311 --> 00:13:49.700
Dora,
because you're supposed to have it develop network and then you,

224
00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.270
every person that you go meet with you ask them for three references and you

225
00:13:53.271 --> 00:13:55.640
know,
did you have a good experience meeting with me today?

226
00:13:55.641 --> 00:13:58.430
Would you recommend me to your friends and then send me to three other people?

227
00:13:58.431 --> 00:14:02.660
So it's not totally door to door,
but um,
kind of,

228
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.850
I mean it's that same style.
Yeah.
So I,

229
00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:10.960
my biggest problem was selling Cutco is that how I was raised by a Hungarian

230
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.380
Slav immigrant who came over with $200 in his pocket and thought that buying us

231
00:14:15.381 --> 00:14:17.270
a happy meal was too expensive.

232
00:14:17.271 --> 00:14:22.271
So I was selling it Cutco $1,400 a knife sets and I was really good at it.

233
00:14:22.911 --> 00:14:23.511
And at Cutco,

234
00:14:23.511 --> 00:14:28.511
they taught me how to nod my head and smile to get that reciprocal behavior and

235
00:14:30.081 --> 00:14:32.450
say,
will you buy my $1,400 knife set?

236
00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:37.340
And people were saying yes to me all the time and I was enjoying the fact that I

237
00:14:37.341 --> 00:14:40.850
was so good at it,
but I totally felt like I was scamming people.

238
00:14:40.851 --> 00:14:45.590
And little did I realize that rich people don't mind paying $1,400 or more for

239
00:14:45.591 --> 00:14:47.900
an amazing set of cutlery,
which by the way,

240
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.510
I still own myself and completely believe in.

241
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:56.080
But because I felt like I was maybe scamming people,

242
00:14:57.171 --> 00:15:01.670
I had to stop selling Cutco knives and I reduced my own profits because I felt

243
00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:04.820
like I was ripping people's faces off.
So then you,

244
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.460
you get these free products that you can give them.
Like,

245
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:11.060
oh here I'll give you my free cake slicer or this or that.
Like in,

246
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:14.810
you're supposed to use those to like help get them to a bigger knife set.

247
00:15:14.811 --> 00:15:16.760
But I would get them to say yes to the biggest,

248
00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:21.080
most expensive set and then I would feel guilty for like selling them on

249
00:15:21.081 --> 00:15:22.250
something so big.
So it'd be like,

250
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.620
I'm going to give you these five free products as well.

251
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:27.250
<v 4>And by the way,</v>

252
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.900
can you tell me the names of three of your friends you would recommend?
I also

253
00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:33.421
<v 3>exactly,</v>

254
00:15:33.421 --> 00:15:36.960
and then I would get like economies a scale on this stuff because when I was on

255
00:15:36.961 --> 00:15:41.280
the wrestling team as the only girl,
we had to raise money for that.

256
00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:46.550
So then I would literally go door to door and after I'd win a match and my,

257
00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:50.880
um,
my wrestling photo was in the Sunday paper,

258
00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.250
I would walk around door to door and be like,
hi.

259
00:15:53.251 --> 00:15:54.750
And I'd be in a dress and I'd be like,

260
00:15:54.751 --> 00:15:57.690
I'm on the hunt Davis high school wrestling team and I'm raising money and we're

261
00:15:57.691 --> 00:16:00.450
pushing cars around the track.
So will you give us money?

262
00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:04.110
And then I would do that and sell Cutco knives at the same time.
So

263
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:09.460
<v 4>wait a second bite at the same time,
do you mean,
hey,</v>

264
00:16:09.461 --> 00:16:12.250
thanks for the $50 to support the wrestling team?
By the way,

265
00:16:12.251 --> 00:16:14.960
I noticed that you have a cutting board.
No,

266
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.390
<v 3>I would ask for a separate appointment.</v>

267
00:16:17.391 --> 00:16:19.640
I didn't want to totally overwhelmed my customer.

268
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:25.640
<v 4>That's a hell of a cross sale.
Now,
the,
the,</v>

269
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.730
the promise I made earlier to kind of wind this back,

270
00:16:28.731 --> 00:16:30.260
of course I went all the way back to seven.

271
00:16:30.261 --> 00:16:35.261
But is it true that you were originally turned down by UC Berkeley?

272
00:16:36.531 --> 00:16:39.650
It was right.
Is this,
is this accurate that you wrote them a letter?

273
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:45.210
<v 3>Well,
uh,
I was,
so,
I was admitted to UC Berkeley.</v>

274
00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.620
I tried to get rejected because my dad wanted me to go to UC Berkeley and I want

275
00:16:49.621 --> 00:16:50.970
to get so far away from home.

276
00:16:50.971 --> 00:16:54.750
I had wrestled and gone to high school in Davis and I looked up the hardest,

277
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:56.550
the hardest major to get into,

278
00:16:56.551 --> 00:17:00.690
which was bioengineering at cow had a 4% chance of admission.

279
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.771
Well,

280
00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:06.771
I got in and I didn't really want to be an engineer and I was flunking out of my

281
00:17:06.781 --> 00:17:07.950
engineering courses.

282
00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:13.340
And then I supported myself through school and I,

283
00:17:13.351 --> 00:17:14.184
um,

284
00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:19.610
I looked up a summer job that was for a management consulting firm,

285
00:17:19.771 --> 00:17:21.270
which I had no clue what that was.

286
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.560
And I remember reading the posting allowed to someone and saying,

287
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:29.490
this requires an entrepreneurial spirit and I didn't know how to pronounce a

288
00:17:29.491 --> 00:17:33.510
word.
And I was like,
what the hell is that?
To what does that mean?
Well,

289
00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:38.070
I got the job at the management consulting firm and I discovered what business

290
00:17:38.071 --> 00:17:40.620
is and decided I loved it.

291
00:17:40.621 --> 00:17:45.621
So I applied to the undergraduate costs program at Uc Berkeley and I got

292
00:17:46.021 --> 00:17:47.670
rejected.
And I'm not surprised.

293
00:17:47.671 --> 00:17:52.020
I mean I was failing literally out of my engineering courses because my brain is

294
00:17:52.021 --> 00:17:53.610
not really that of an engineer.

295
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.360
And so that's when I wrote them a seven page appeal letter and I was like,
look,

296
00:17:57.361 --> 00:18:02.190
I'm a student athlete.
I work 40 hours a week on top of it.

297
00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.100
If you let me,
and I promise I'll make you proud.
And they let me in.

298
00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.130
<v 1>So where does this come from?</v>

299
00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:14.210
This sort of aggressive drive,
right?
I mean,
you're,

300
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:17.570
you're spinning wrestling,

301
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:22.670
which is certainly even now,
but at the time,
I mean,
Margolis is really,

302
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.170
I think raised the perception of women's wrestling into the US tremendously,

303
00:18:27.171 --> 00:18:32.171
but certainly back then as a wrestler myself throughout high school and then the

304
00:18:33.711 --> 00:18:38.180
very beginning portions of college unusual that,
uh,
that,

305
00:18:38.181 --> 00:18:41.900
that not very common I should say,
that the women would go to wrestling.

306
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.960
You have this entrepreneurial drive really,
really early.

307
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.640
Where does that come from?

308
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:52.050
<v 3>So I feel like I was raised in a mini shark tank at my house.</v>

309
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.240
My Dad is an inventor still.

310
00:18:54.241 --> 00:18:58.020
He's 73 years old and he patents all types of stuff.

311
00:18:58.021 --> 00:18:59.400
He's an electrical engineer.

312
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:04.470
And he taught me to see the world through quite a different Lens.

313
00:19:04.471 --> 00:19:07.440
So when I was as young as age six or seven,

314
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.110
he would have me stand up in front of family.

315
00:19:10.111 --> 00:19:12.060
And I never knew him when he was going to do it.
But he's like,

316
00:19:12.061 --> 00:19:16.980
you have one minute to invent something and talk about the market and how you're

317
00:19:16.981 --> 00:19:21.300
going to price it and the demand and your strategy for getting it out there.

318
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:26.340
And I would come up with ridiculous things.
I can't even remember.

319
00:19:26.341 --> 00:19:31.200
I remember that one of my favorite inventions with shoes that could fly and what

320
00:19:31.201 --> 00:19:36.201
I remember about doing that with my father is that he never told me that one of

321
00:19:36.571 --> 00:19:39.450
my ideas was stupid or not feasible.

322
00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:44.070
And so he could have just raised a very delusional child who thought that she

323
00:19:44.071 --> 00:19:48.970
could do anything.
And I guess he kind of did.
Um,
but I,

324
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:50.490
I,

325
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:54.870
whenever I saw problems and I saw things that I didn't like about the world and

326
00:19:54.871 --> 00:19:56.310
I would complain about them,

327
00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:00.510
my dad would say to me instead of complaining about it,

328
00:20:00.511 --> 00:20:04.860
why don't you figure out how you can fix it?
And He,

329
00:20:04.861 --> 00:20:08.160
for example,
I was raised super weird immigrant home.

330
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.250
I was not allowed to watch television.
Like almost never,

331
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.070
we never were allowed to watch sports.
He said,

332
00:20:14.071 --> 00:20:18.990
why would you watch somebody else going out there and getting it when you could

333
00:20:18.991 --> 00:20:21.480
invest that same time in doing it yourself?

334
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:25.090
So he told me to get my butt out there and work out,
you know,
and,

335
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.300
and learn how to become the best at something.
And he said,

336
00:20:27.301 --> 00:20:30.630
if you're going to become a chimney sweep or just become a best chimney sweeper.

337
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:36.140
So I didn't really know that there was another way and I really believed I could

338
00:20:36.601 --> 00:20:41.250
do anything.
And so I thought,
um,
I was,

339
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:45.600
I was born in Canada and French was my first language and we came over to the u

340
00:20:45.601 --> 00:20:50.601
s when I was seven and when my dad got invited to come and teach at Stanford and

341
00:20:53.411 --> 00:20:57.190
he told me that we were moving to the u s I said,
I said,
no,

342
00:20:57.191 --> 00:21:00.340
I don't want to because I can't become the president of the United States.

343
00:21:00.341 --> 00:21:04.570
And I have zero political aspirations today,
by the way.
But,
um,
but when,

344
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:08.170
when I told him I couldn't become the president,
he said,

345
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.720
I'm going to give you a little time to think about that,

346
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:15.850
about how you could turn that I come up with a solution for that problem.

347
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.510
So I came back to him,
I don't know,
a week later or something,
and I said,

348
00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:23.800
I've got it where we can move to the United States.
I will become a lawyer.

349
00:21:23.801 --> 00:21:27.370
I will change the constitution of the United States so that someone who's not

350
00:21:27.371 --> 00:21:29.860
born in the United States can become the president and then it will become the

351
00:21:29.861 --> 00:21:30.694
president.

352
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:35.380
And then after we moved to the u s he introduced me to everybody as the future

353
00:21:35.381 --> 00:21:38.770
president of the United States.
When he said it,
I thought he was serious.

354
00:21:38.771 --> 00:21:41.830
So he believed in me.
And so I believed in me.

355
00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:45.240
And I guess that's why I run something called define now.
I,

356
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:49.270
I actually believe I can do it.
And like I'm like Jerry Colonna and says,

357
00:21:49.271 --> 00:21:53.140
I am pathologically optimistic about my goals.

358
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.350
<v 4>So,
all right.</v>

359
00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.640
That is a very thorough and extremely helpful answer.

360
00:22:00.641 --> 00:22:02.780
What was your dad,
uh,

361
00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:07.710
invited to teach at Stanford in electrical engineering.
Electrical engineering.

362
00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:12.980
And what,
when,
uh,
and the reason you moved to the u s was because of the,

363
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:16.720
the faculty invitation?
Uh,
from Stanford.
Yep.

364
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.840
<v 3>So he got it like a one year invitation and then it turned into two years and</v>

365
00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:23.910
then he could have stayed at Stanford,

366
00:22:23.911 --> 00:22:27.510
but my dad is like a ski freak and he just wanted to be closer to the mountains,

367
00:22:27.511 --> 00:22:31.920
so that's why we moved to Davis and he taught at Uc Davis.
But my,

368
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:37.080
I'm a lot like my dad and that he loves to like invent stuff and so he left

369
00:22:37.681 --> 00:22:41.370
university life and now it's still like he works til five in the morning.

370
00:22:41.371 --> 00:22:43.620
Just inventing new stuff.

371
00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:46.830
<v 4>Sounds like.
Sounds like a cool,
cool gig.</v>

372
00:22:46.831 --> 00:22:50.010
Would he call himself an inventor or a product developer or neither.

373
00:22:50.011 --> 00:22:54.690
He would say inventor.
Yeah.
What was your home like outside of,

374
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:59.340
of your father?
Was your,
was your mom around?
Do you have siblings?
Paint,

375
00:22:59.341 --> 00:23:00.240
paint a picture for people?

376
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:03.820
<v 3>Yes.
I'm the oldest of four kids.
I was like a mini mom.</v>

377
00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:08.500
My mother would literally want to bring homeless people back to our house.

378
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:12.280
And my mom's like really compassionate and caring.
Um,

379
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:17.700
and my mom used to be a nurse and I stayed at home to take care of the kids.

380
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.590
And uh,

381
00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:25.650
I developed a lot of my compassion and heart for serving others from my mom.

382
00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:31.420
And I remember,
you know,
my mom would tell me,

383
00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.560
eat all the food on your plate because there are starving kids in Africa.

384
00:23:35.561 --> 00:23:38.890
And I was like,
okay,
if I don't eat the food on my plate,

385
00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.500
are the starving kids in Africa going to get my food?

386
00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.770
So I think that has seven.
This is like from my dad,
right?

387
00:23:45.771 --> 00:23:47.480
Like find a solution when the problem.

388
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:52.810
So I found some like sponsorship program to sponsor a kid in Africa and the

389
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:59.630
little golf ball money is hamster selling money that I thought I was bawling

390
00:23:59.631 --> 00:24:00.620
when I was seven years old,

391
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:05.890
but I would send that money over seas to sponsor orphans.

392
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.140
So I developed a heart for

393
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:14.790
other people and not just making a buck.
I real,
I'm very competitive.

394
00:24:14.791 --> 00:24:19.791
If you can't tell and I love money because I love what money can do to create

395
00:24:20.421 --> 00:24:21.590
the world that I want to live in.

396
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:26.150
<v 4>You are a competitive,
I'm going to add some more color to that.
See if my,</v>

397
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:28.910
see if you can fact check,
tell me if any of this is incorrect.

398
00:24:28.911 --> 00:24:33.410
California state women's wrestling champ,
three to a marathon runner college,

399
00:24:33.411 --> 00:24:37.210
rugby player,
Varsity rower and you still enjoy all that.

400
00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.700
We talked about this a little bit.
There was lean Jujitsu,
uh,
which,

401
00:24:40.701 --> 00:24:45.701
which has deprived me of my structural integrity and my ankle as of last week

402
00:24:46.161 --> 00:24:47.150
with some snap ligaments.

403
00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:52.390
But you are certainly very competitive and I want to also note something that we

404
00:24:53.151 --> 00:24:54.200
discussed very briefly.

405
00:24:54.201 --> 00:24:58.220
Are you mentioned that when we're doing a sound check before hitting record that

406
00:24:58.221 --> 00:25:02.270
because I asked you what your breakfast was and you said coffee and I said okay,

407
00:25:02.271 --> 00:25:06.320
I need a few more seconds to just talk about your coffee for sound check.

408
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.930
And you said medium warm coffee.

409
00:25:08.931 --> 00:25:13.070
I put in ice cubes and then you kept on going and I thought you were making it.

410
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.610
No,
I know.
And then I thought maybe you were making it up and I was like,
wait,

411
00:25:16.611 --> 00:25:18.710
what's the story on the medium warm coffee?

412
00:25:18.711 --> 00:25:20.600
Can you tell people what the story is?

413
00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:22.830
<v 3>Well,
I,
um,</v>

414
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:28.130
I like to be very efficient and fast and I like to eat fast and drink fast.

415
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:31.710
And so I put ice cubes,
someone coffee so I can pound it.

416
00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:36.770
Cause I actually think things tend to taste better when I eat them or drink them

417
00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.210
really fast.

418
00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.240
I don't understand people who like to chew on their food for two hours.

419
00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:45.180
It annoys me.
I mean it's fine for them,
but not for me.

420
00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:51.090
<v 4>So you and I have a number of overlapping circles,</v>

421
00:25:52.871 --> 00:25:54.320
so I'm also of the fast,

422
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:56.400
<v 3>we're,
we're,
we're going to roll right after this.</v>

423
00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.110
<v 4>Oh yeah.
Well I'm going to meet you in Austin and we're going to roll.</v>

424
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:03.490
You know what?
I'll just let you triangle choke me because I don't think,

425
00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:08.350
I don't think given your credentials that I'm going to give you much of a fight.

426
00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.210
Uh,
I can talk a big game.

427
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.600
Let's see.
We talked about Seth.

428
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.190
There seemed to be a number of other people.

429
00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.210
We don't have to spend too much time on this,
but I do know for,

430
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:26.350
I've spent some time with Jerry,
Jerry Colonna.
Uh,
you mentioned

431
00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.710
<v 3>he's one of our faculty members too.</v>

432
00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:30.270
<v 4>Yeah,
Jerry's amazing.</v>

433
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:34.950
There's another also of course these two know each other.
Uh,

434
00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.480
Brad Feld who's just an incredible guy,
uh,

435
00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:42.720
and incredible investor also
where

436
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.730
<v 1>the entrepreneurs in training enter the picture.</v>

437
00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:50.250
How did that become part of your life?

438
00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.600
<v 3>So when I was 26,</v>

439
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:58.220
I was working for New York City private equity firm and I got invited to prison

440
00:26:58.221 --> 00:27:02.690
for the first time in my life and that changed everything in my life because I

441
00:27:02.691 --> 00:27:07.250
used to think that people who are incarcerated are like the scum of the earth.

442
00:27:07.251 --> 00:27:08.180
When I was 12,

443
00:27:08.181 --> 00:27:11.960
a good friend of mine was brutally murdered by two 16 year old boys.

444
00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:17.620
And so from that experience of one I extrapolated to think that anyone in prison

445
00:27:18.381 --> 00:27:23.060
could rotten die in that place.
And it was that first prison visit.

446
00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:27.560
I'm 40 years old now.
We're like three months apart,
Tim.
And,
um,

447
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:29.690
when I was 26,

448
00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:34.760
that visit opened my eyes and my heart and it ended up,
I didn't know,

449
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:37.850
it ended up becoming my life calling,

450
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:43.490
but it ended up changing my wallet and my priorities and my time.

451
00:27:43.491 --> 00:27:48.491
And it's what I've devoted my everything to now is the second chance field and

452
00:27:50.601 --> 00:27:55.601
working with people with criminal histories who uh,

453
00:27:55.701 --> 00:27:56.120
you know,

454
00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:01.120
the world caused them all types of things like ex offenders are criminals and,

455
00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.460
and I say we don't work with criminals.

456
00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:09.490
We work with people who committed criminal acts in their past and as a really

457
00:28:10.101 --> 00:28:10.934
big difference.

458
00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:15.970
So at defy I believe we're all ex dumpings and we call them e I t's or

459
00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:21.600
entrepreneurs in training and then they become full fledged entrepreneurs.
Okay.

460
00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:28.340
<v 1>It's a few notes just because I have had sufficient caffeine into,</v>

461
00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.550
to want to talk a lot.
The,

462
00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.030
the first is a really important distinction that you made.
And uh,

463
00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:40.310
also as some backstory before we hit record,
you were like,
you asked me,

464
00:28:40.311 --> 00:28:44.120
do I have the right to call you out if they call them criminals?
I said,
yes,

465
00:28:44.121 --> 00:28:45.280
you do.
Uh,

466
00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:50.560
because the language and the language we use is so important in this context.

467
00:28:52.971 --> 00:28:56.150
In many other contexts,
trends,
for instance,
uh,

468
00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:01.300
I have tried very hard for myself to not call myself an anxious.

469
00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:07.730
I am anxious to use that language or to say I am an anxious person,

470
00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:11.780
but rather to say,
you know,
I feel anxiety sort of depersonalize it in that way.

471
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:16.870
So think also people with a criminal past is very different from x criminals or

472
00:29:17.841 --> 00:29:19.760
criminals,
right?
I mean they're,
they're very,

473
00:29:19.761 --> 00:29:24.761
very distinct labels that create an entirely distinct way of relating to

474
00:29:25.581 --> 00:29:28.130
somebody with one versus the other.
Right.

475
00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:31.040
I just want to underscore how important that is,

476
00:29:31.041 --> 00:29:33.440
not just for how you would label other people,

477
00:29:33.441 --> 00:29:35.090
but also for how you label yourself.

478
00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.310
<v 3>We're big on that.
Really,
really big on how we label ourselves.</v>

479
00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:42.240
<v 1>Yeah.
Really,</v>

480
00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.250
<v 4>really important.
And the,</v>

481
00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:48.360
the question then I have is why did this stick?

482
00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:53.420
Why did this become what appears to be a lifelong passion and commitment?

483
00:29:55.650 --> 00:30:00.570
Whereas you had tried so many things in the past and you're no longer selling

484
00:30:00.571 --> 00:30:03.630
hamsters,
you're no longer doing private equity.

485
00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:06.870
Why did this stick?
Like why,

486
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:11.400
was there a specific conversation?
Was there specific moment?
What,

487
00:30:11.401 --> 00:30:14.430
what was it that made this stick for you?

488
00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:18.000
<v 3>Yeah,
so I didn't think it would stick.</v>

489
00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:23.340
And when I went to prison that very first time in Texas,

490
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.650
um,
what I saw,

491
00:30:25.651 --> 00:30:30.651
they're shocked my heart and I have made so many bad decisions and mistakes in

492
00:30:33.331 --> 00:30:37.230
my own life and I'm really grateful for the grace and second chances that I've

493
00:30:37.231 --> 00:30:42.231
received yet I was so quick to write off and label people who had been caught

494
00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.810
for something criminal.

495
00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:51.620
And so I was just convicted by the ugliness of my own heart because I,

496
00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:57.420
when I went and visited in prison,
I realized,

497
00:30:57.421 --> 00:31:01.320
and this might sound stupid,
but I realized that they were actually human beings,

498
00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:04.560
not a rap sheet,
not an number.

499
00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:09.420
And the first guy that I met in prison that weekend,

500
00:31:09.421 --> 00:31:11.970
his name is Johnny.
And when I heard Johnny story,

501
00:31:11.971 --> 00:31:13.530
when Johnny was eight years old,

502
00:31:13.531 --> 00:31:18.510
he watched as his grandfather and murdered his father right in front of him.

503
00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:21.960
And then when Johnny was 11 or 12,

504
00:31:21.961 --> 00:31:26.280
he was given drugs and he was jumped into a gang.
And by the age of 18,

505
00:31:26.281 --> 00:31:27.390
he was incarcerated.

506
00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:33.290
And empathy for the people that I serve is what made us stick because I was

507
00:31:35.311 --> 00:31:38.640
like,
wow,
had I been raised in those circumstances,

508
00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:43.680
I am certain that I would have ended up in that path as well.

509
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:49.050
And when I,
to this day,
when I hear the stories of the people that I serve,

510
00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:50.071
you know,

511
00:31:50.071 --> 00:31:55.071
I was just in a prison last week and I do this exercise called step to the line

512
00:31:56.370 --> 00:32:00.510
and we have all of our CEOs and venture capitalists and executive volunteers on

513
00:32:00.511 --> 00:32:01.470
one side of the line.

514
00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.250
And then we have our eids are entrepreneurs and training the incarcerated on the

515
00:32:05.251 --> 00:32:08.160
other side of the line.
And you step to the line.
If this statement is true,

516
00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:09.930
if it says step to the line,

517
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:15.240
if you've ever been arrested and about a third of our volunteers are at the

518
00:32:15.241 --> 00:32:17.730
line,
um,
step to the line.

519
00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:21.000
If you've ever done something for which you could have been arrested but you

520
00:32:21.001 --> 00:32:22.080
have not been arrested.

521
00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:27.140
100% of our volunteers at the line step to the line if you're arrested the first

522
00:32:27.241 --> 00:32:32.241
time before the age of 16 like maybe 75% of our of of our Eids are at the line

523
00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.130
and then I count backwards step to the line.

524
00:32:35.131 --> 00:32:40.131
If you were incarcerated before the age of 14 1210 and I get to age eight if

525
00:32:42.531 --> 00:32:42.860
you're in,

526
00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:47.860
if you were first incarcerated at the age of eight there are four guys remaining

527
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.100
at the line.
Seven there's one guy,

528
00:32:52.101 --> 00:32:57.050
Romania at the line and I'm trying to picture a seven year old or an eight year

529
00:32:57.051 --> 00:33:02.051
old in handcuffs and normally a prison style seems pretty small and stifling,

530
00:33:02.451 --> 00:33:05.090
but imagine a little seven or eight year old there.

531
00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:10.860
My empathy for the people that I serve is what made this stick for me and I

532
00:33:13.911 --> 00:33:17.660
don't have pity for them.
I have a deep compassion.

533
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:21.110
I also have mad respect for their skills.

534
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:26.200
I work with natural born entrepreneurs who started off selling gumballs out of

535
00:33:27.411 --> 00:33:31.130
their lockers,
not hamsters and gumballs,

536
00:33:31.131 --> 00:33:34.100
proceeded into drugs,
which,
you know,

537
00:33:34.101 --> 00:33:36.290
kept going and then they got arrested.

538
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:41.830
But I have a love of underdogs and I love of entrepreneurs and I hate injustice.

539
00:33:42.861 --> 00:33:46.010
Like when I grew up as a little kid and I saw somebody else get bullied,

540
00:33:46.011 --> 00:33:50.150
I would always stand up for them and defend the victim.

541
00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:55.840
And here I was in the midst of people who have been thrown away by society,

542
00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:01.850
who are not just aspiring entrepreneurs,

543
00:34:01.851 --> 00:34:04.760
by who are proven entrepreneurs with amazing talents.

544
00:34:04.761 --> 00:34:07.820
I believe that the people I serve represent America's most overlooked talent

545
00:34:07.821 --> 00:34:08.654
pool.

546
00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:14.110
And that first weekend when I was 26 years old and naive as could be in Texas at

547
00:34:16.731 --> 00:34:19.580
the last prison I went to,
I went to four prisons in the last one.

548
00:34:19.581 --> 00:34:22.460
The guys are like,
will you please come back?

549
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:24.830
And I said yes.

550
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:29.480
And my dad also taught me to be a person of my word.

551
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:32.180
And I had no idea what it meant to come back.

552
00:34:32.181 --> 00:34:36.050
I had never talked to a warden before,
but after I said yes,

553
00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:37.670
I was coming back and I did,

554
00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:44.800
<v 4>I'm going to get this pronunciation wrong most likely.</v>

555
00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:48.710
But can you tell us I'm all about second chances?
10

556
00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:54.700
yes.
Well,
I used that one before.
I May,

557
00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:01.510
I can tell you've been working on your material
costs.
Marty,

558
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:05.050
is this,
is this correct?
I think,
yeah,
cause Marty,
yeah.
Marty,

559
00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.510
can you tell us who costs Martinez?

560
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:11.210
<v 3>Yeah,
he's one of our best known success stories.</v>

561
00:35:11.211 --> 00:35:12.890
He's a graduate of defy ventures.

562
00:35:12.891 --> 00:35:16.730
He did five years in prison and the New York state prison system,

563
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:22.340
and he went to prison at age 19.
So he grew up in poverty,

564
00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.770
heroin,
needles all around him.

565
00:35:24.771 --> 00:35:28.400
And he said that the one thing you want it to become when he was older was rich.

566
00:35:28.401 --> 00:35:30.080
He didn't know how to get out of the system,

567
00:35:30.081 --> 00:35:35.081
but he saw his mother working over time to put food on the table.

568
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:38.820
And um,
so when he was a young teenager,

569
00:35:38.821 --> 00:35:43.110
he got introduced to the world of selling drugs and he got incarcerated.
Uh,

570
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:47.460
his first time I think at 12 or 13,
and bounced in and out.

571
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:52.590
And by the time that he was 19 and got arrested on a king pin case,

572
00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:58.160
he was running a drug empire in New York where he was doing $2 million a year in

573
00:35:59.041 --> 00:36:04.020
drug sales.
And he had an army of people working for him and he was a young,

574
00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:07.890
natural entrepreneur.
And when he was incarcerated,

575
00:36:07.891 --> 00:36:11.750
he realized that he was in fact very entrepreneurial.
But the,
his,
uh,

576
00:36:11.751 --> 00:36:15.720
entrepreneurial skill sets were being used to destroy communities rather than

577
00:36:15.721 --> 00:36:16.554
build them up.

578
00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:22.110
He had a wake up call in prison when he was sent to the Shu to solitary

579
00:36:22.111 --> 00:36:26.760
confinement after having an altercation with an officer.
He,

580
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:27.270
um,

581
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:32.270
he was also so overweight and unhealthy when he got sent to prison that doctors

582
00:36:32.341 --> 00:36:35.820
told him that he would die in prison even though he was only doing five years.

583
00:36:35.821 --> 00:36:38.220
And he was like,
I'm not done in prison.
So he,

584
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:42.060
while he was locked up in solitary confinement in a box that has a size of a

585
00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.050
parking spot,

586
00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:48.650
he came up with body weight bearing workout and he lost 70 pounds.

587
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.140
And then when he got out of the shoe,

588
00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:56.340
he taught other incarcerated men at that prison,

589
00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:00.480
about 20 of them had to lose a collective 1000 pounds.

590
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:05.280
So he was on to something with his prison style fitness workout and he got out

591
00:37:05.281 --> 00:37:08.460
of prison and he had always wanted to become a legal entrepreneur.

592
00:37:08.461 --> 00:37:11.850
So with defies help,
he turned that into con body.

593
00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.820
And con body is a prison stuff,

594
00:37:14.821 --> 00:37:19.821
fitness bootcamp that in less than three years has more than 14,000 customers.

595
00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:24.960
He says that he follows around women wearing yoga pants and he asked them where

596
00:37:24.961 --> 00:37:29.961
they work out and he gives him his business card and he's hired nearly 20 people

597
00:37:30.241 --> 00:37:33.030
with criminal histories.
So he's hired other defy ventures,

598
00:37:33.031 --> 00:37:35.220
graduates who have not started their own business.

599
00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:40.730
And we've helped cost to raise more than $250,000 in funding for his business

600
00:37:41.731 --> 00:37:44.880
because we run like these shark tank style pitch competitions.

601
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.770
And he killed it and all of our competitions.

602
00:37:46.771 --> 00:37:49.170
And then we introduced him to other angel investors.

603
00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:54.450
And what I love about costs is that he's not just about his financial bottom

604
00:37:54.451 --> 00:37:58.710
line,
but whenever I asked him to give back in the serve,
he always does.

605
00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:04.010
So we work with defy in the most notorious prison in America called Pelican Bay

606
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:08.340
where they have a solitary confinement facility and we run a program in solitary

607
00:38:08.341 --> 00:38:09.660
confinement costs,

608
00:38:09.661 --> 00:38:14.661
came to Pelican Bay with me and let a workout for the incarcerated guys who are

609
00:38:16.051 --> 00:38:20.490
currently in the shoe.
And I can't tell you how awesome it was to have him.

610
00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:25.880
And he was able to tell his story of going from the shoe to being a CEO.

611
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.190
And His business continues to thrive and boom.

612
00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:33.690
And Saks fifth avenue in New York City needed more foot traffic.

613
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:39.020
So they literally opened up a con body gym inside Saks and now men and women.

614
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:47.550
But mostly women are flocking through stacks to get to con body where they go to

615
00:38:47.981 --> 00:38:50.380
these workouts.
And if you go to a con body workout,

616
00:38:50.381 --> 00:38:55.381
you'll be paired up with your quotes selly and you'll have formerly incarcerated

617
00:38:56.171 --> 00:39:01.171
trainers that cost has hired yelling at you to bring out the best in you and

618
00:39:01.211 --> 00:39:02.260
your physical fitness.

619
00:39:02.261 --> 00:39:07.261
And he also has con body live.com and he now has customers from 24 different

620
00:39:07.631 --> 00:39:10.480
countries that sign up for I think five bucks a month.

621
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:15.510
And it's amazing to watch his hustling skills combined with his heart and the

622
00:39:17.741 --> 00:39:22.030
way that he uses his voice for prison reform and advocacy.

623
00:39:22.031 --> 00:39:24.920
I couldn't be more proud for us to be,
uh,

624
00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:30.170
early incubators of con body and for us to be behind class Marty.

625
00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:37.250
<v 1>And as I understand it,
more than 150 businesses,
uh,</v>

626
00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.510
the number may be outdated.

627
00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:39.370
<v 3>Yes,
it's,</v>

628
00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:43.730
it's nearly 200 businesses now that we have incubated and funded through our

629
00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:45.380
post release incubator.

630
00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:47.370
<v 1>So I'm going to,</v>

631
00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:51.270
I'm going to play devil's advocate a little bit because I'm sure there are

632
00:39:51.271 --> 00:39:56.271
people listening who have different emotional responses to the subject of the

633
00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:04.650
incarcerated or let's just with,
let's talk about the currently say incarcerated.

634
00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:10.130
How do you decide a or vet those people who should be given second chances

635
00:40:12.451 --> 00:40:17.451
versus those who should remain incarcerated because they are genuinely threats

636
00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:23.070
to society and are not fit to be in any way reintegrated.

637
00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:24.240
Uh,

638
00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:28.950
and the reason I ask that is that I know people who are incarcerated who are,

639
00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:34.220
have been repeat offenders,
violent offenders who are,
I mean,

640
00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:37.050
I hate to say it,
but it,
it,
it,
it,
they,

641
00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:41.390
they've at this point at least should not be rereleased in,

642
00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:45.660
in the short term.
Um,
based on my firsthand experience,

643
00:40:45.661 --> 00:40:50.460
I mean watching what some of these people have done,
uh,
how do you,

644
00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:55.490
how do you vet and sort of filter and train in such a way that you ensure

645
00:40:56.581 --> 00:41:00.120
because you,
your number is a very,
very impressive,
right?
I mean,
the,
uh,

646
00:41:00.121 --> 00:41:05.121
and I will have already read this in the introduction that I record separately,

647
00:41:06.091 --> 00:41:07.080
but let's,
let's,

648
00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:11.370
let's reread the bio because I think we're going to dig into a bunch of

649
00:41:11.371 --> 00:41:12.330
different facets of it.

650
00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:17.190
So if you could bear with me boring you by reading your own biome.
Here we go.

651
00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:20.580
After being given a second chance of her own,
which we're going to come back to.

652
00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:22.050
Katherine founded Defy Ventures,

653
00:41:22.051 --> 00:41:25.710
a national nonprofit organization that transforms the Hustle in quotation marks

654
00:41:25.711 --> 00:41:29.520
of currently and formerly incarcerated people to Phi produce.
Groundbreaking,

655
00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:33.920
groundbreaking,
groundbreaking could be something else.
Groundbreaking results,

656
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.500
including this is the key here.
Recidivism,

657
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:41.650
recidivism rate of less than 5% and an employment rate of 95% to [inaudible]

658
00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:45.020
vision is to end mass incarceration by using entrepreneurship as a tool to

659
00:41:45.021 --> 00:41:49.220
transform legacy and and human potential.
And then you have many,
many,

660
00:41:49.221 --> 00:41:50.300
many different accolades.

661
00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:53.810
100 most creative people in business according to fast company,
Ashoka fellow,

662
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:57.050
2013 and so on.
But I won't get into all of those.

663
00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.280
How do you,
how do you,
how do you filter,

664
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:03.650
cultivate the right people versus the wrong people?

665
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:04.660
<v 3>All right,</v>

666
00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:09.660
so although I speak with great passion about defies e I t's,

667
00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:17.010
I never take away from the fact that they have made grave mistakes,

668
00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:20.350
that they have hurt society,

669
00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:25.440
that they have hurt individuals and that nothing about that is okay.

670
00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:30.880
So I'm not a one of these like,

671
00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:35.910
oh no one should go to prison and let the prison doors fly open so everyone can

672
00:42:35.921 --> 00:42:37.610
just get out.
Um,

673
00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:43.300
when people hurt people and there are a threat to society,

674
00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:48.130
they are sent to prison and that's not a bad thing.

675
00:42:48.131 --> 00:42:48.964
In fact,

676
00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:54.570
I believe that an adult timeout is often a very important element of people's

677
00:42:57.881 --> 00:42:58.930
transformation.

678
00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:04.380
So I know that people having a consequence is really important and sometimes

679
00:43:07.751 --> 00:43:09.970
that consequence really needs to be prison.

680
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.340
Sometimes people need to be taken out of society.

681
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.110
I think we're way too liberal with the way that we hand out time.

682
00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:22.060
And I can get into into my opinions about how we sentence people and racial and

683
00:43:22.061 --> 00:43:23.440
economic disparities.

684
00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:27.280
I can get into that all day long because there's major injustice and that,

685
00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:29.020
but let's just go with this,

686
00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:32.860
that when hurt people hurt other people,

687
00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:37.870
there needs to be a consequence.
And prison is often,

688
00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:41.740
I believe,
a solid consequence for that.

689
00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:46.120
It's called the field of corrections.

690
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:49.780
And unfortunately when people are sent to prison,

691
00:43:49.781 --> 00:43:52.960
they're are usually thrown away and it's pure punishment.

692
00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:58.620
What many people in society don't realize is that 95% of incarcerated people are

693
00:43:59.291 --> 00:44:04.060
coming back out to become our neighbors.
So yes,

694
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:07.600
people I've served have done some terrible things.

695
00:44:07.601 --> 00:44:09.760
Sometimes things that make my own stomach turn,

696
00:44:09.761 --> 00:44:14.350
even though I'm around these people and the crimes that they've,

697
00:44:14.351 --> 00:44:16.360
I know their rap sheets intimately.

698
00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:21.760
So what kind of neighbor do you want coming back to live next to you?

699
00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:25.450
Do you want someone who has not been rehabilitated or do you want someone who

700
00:44:25.451 --> 00:44:26.860
has been rehabilitated?

701
00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:30.670
And at defy we actually work with,

702
00:44:30.671 --> 00:44:35.671
people have committed tougher crimes and most we work at a lot of maximum

703
00:44:35.731 --> 00:44:39.020
security facilities.
And when I say we work in solitary confinement,

704
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:44.030
you don't go to solitary confinement unless you've done some,

705
00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.400
some made some really,
really bad decisions.

706
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:52.140
And 90% of the people that we serve have committed violent crimes.

707
00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:55.560
People who commit murder,

708
00:44:55.860 --> 00:45:00.270
nearly all of them still get out of prison.
I think people don't realize that.

709
00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:06.380
And so if we lock them up like they're an animal and give them no resources and

710
00:45:07.231 --> 00:45:12.000
then when they'd get out,
offer them no opportunities to make it legally,

711
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:16.620
what are they going to go back to?
We as society decide.

712
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:22.070
So the other thing is I'm not the one who decides if they serve time or how much

713
00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:25.290
time they do.

714
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:30.800
Our American judges and juries and prosecutors determined that.

715
00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:38.120
And according to the way our laws are set up,

716
00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:42.270
when you get sentenced to a term,

717
00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:45.780
you supposedly pay your debt to society.

718
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:51.300
And unfortunately when people get out of prison,

719
00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:55.380
they're often treated like they're wearing invisible handcuffs for the rest of

720
00:45:55.381 --> 00:45:56.310
their lives.

721
00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:02.040
And especially if you've been a victim of a crime,
you might be like,

722
00:46:02.041 --> 00:46:06.600
good,
I want them to permanently suffer.
Well,

723
00:46:06.601 --> 00:46:10.530
I've been a victim of multiple crimes myself,

724
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:16.010
some of the worst crimes myself and vengeance can be a really ugly thing.

725
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:22.650
And when I get into a healthy place in my own head,

726
00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:26.550
I realized that
if,

727
00:46:26.850 --> 00:46:31.850
if I had my vengeance on every human who has hurt me and just tortured them,

728
00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:36.720
I think it might bring out even worse things in them,

729
00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:41.780
but if they could get healing for the ways that they have hurt me and then live

730
00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:47.070
the fullest life that they could like live up to their fullest potential,

731
00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:52.230
who would we be as a country if they had healing and forgiveness and then didn't

732
00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:53.760
make other victims?

733
00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:59.370
That's what I want for myself,
for the people I serve,

734
00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:01.050
we're all offenders.

735
00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:06.080
We all hurt people and I think that when it comes to people who are in prison,

736
00:47:06.601 --> 00:47:10.920
there's this real us versus them mentality like they're in prison.

737
00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:12.690
They should rotten there,

738
00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:16.830
but when when our volunteers come to prison with us,

739
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:20.820
I asked them through that step to the line exercise some pretty challenging

740
00:47:20.821 --> 00:47:23.400
questions like step to the line.

741
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:28.650
If you have ever been in a fight to prove yourself,

742
00:47:28.651 --> 00:47:32.950
go all way back to your childhood.
Like if you,
even with a sibling,

743
00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:38.220
pulled their hair or punched a boy who was picking on you at the park or

744
00:47:38.351 --> 00:47:40.120
something like that,
as a little kid,

745
00:47:40.121 --> 00:47:42.220
as a seven or eight year old step to the line.

746
00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:47.080
And I would say that 70 or 80% of our volunteers are at the line on that.

747
00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:52.600
And then I say step to the line,
if you've ever been con,

748
00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:55.810
if you've ever committed a violent crime,

749
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:59.800
and none of our volunteers are at the line,

750
00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:04.810
but I'll close to a hundred percent of our eids are at the line.

751
00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:08.980
And I tell the volunteers,
I must not be making myself clear.

752
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.530
I did not save to step to the line.
If you've been convicted of a violent crime,

753
00:48:12.531 --> 00:48:13.241
step to the line,

754
00:48:13.241 --> 00:48:17.980
if you've committed a violent crime and earlier 70 or 80% of you are at the

755
00:48:17.981 --> 00:48:21.940
line.
When I asked if you've ever been in a childhood fight,
step to the line,

756
00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:24.340
almost all of you were there.
Well,

757
00:48:24.341 --> 00:48:26.830
the volunteers roll their eyes at me because they're like,
come on.

758
00:48:26.831 --> 00:48:29.920
You know the little fight that I got in at the playground.

759
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:32.890
That's not a violent crime.
And I'm like,
actually,

760
00:48:32.891 --> 00:48:36.130
if you looked at the backstories of the people that I serve,

761
00:48:36.970 --> 00:48:41.970
about half of them were arrested the first time before they were 10 or 11 and

762
00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:44.620
when I ask them for what they say,
oh,

763
00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:49.510
my mom was strung out and I broke into my neighbor's house to steal food because

764
00:48:49.511 --> 00:48:50.380
I was hungry,

765
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:54.550
or I was 10 and a 13 year old was picking on me at the park.

766
00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:58.510
So I punched him in the face,
you know,
stuff like that.

767
00:48:58.511 --> 00:49:03.511
And so it's very easy for us to turn the other person into a villain,

768
00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:07.780
into a wild,

769
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:12.160
caged animal to dehumanize the offender.

770
00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:14.800
But I can see myself in that offender.

771
00:49:14.801 --> 00:49:18.220
And I think that if we all look deep enough,
many of us could see ourselves.

772
00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:19.580
And if you can't see herself in that,

773
00:49:19.581 --> 00:49:23.620
I bet you could see your brother or your sister or your best friend.

774
00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:28.630
And if we were all known permanently for the worst thing that we've ever done,

775
00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:33.100
we might think a little bit differently about the labels that we attach to

776
00:49:33.101 --> 00:49:35.560
people.
And unfortunately,

777
00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:40.900
once people go to prison or jail the first time,

778
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:45.160
a lot of times officers will tell them on their way out,
see you back here.

779
00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:47.320
And in our country,

780
00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:52.950
76.6% of people are rearrested nearly everybody.

781
00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:55.810
If you go in once,
it's a revolving door.

782
00:49:56.530 --> 00:49:59.980
And that is such a sad statistic.

783
00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:05.580
And another statistic that kills me is that 70% of the children of incarcerated

784
00:50:06.551 --> 00:50:10.780
people follow in their parents' footsteps.
Quite a legacy to inherit.

785
00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:16.740
And the good news is that we can break this legacy and we can break that

786
00:50:16.751 --> 00:50:20.740
revolving door and we're called defy and yeah,
we have a lesson,

787
00:50:20.741 --> 00:50:23.830
5% return to prison rate.

788
00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:27.440
And so this is a totally solvable problem,

789
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:33.160
but if we as Americans and society continue to write people off as being less

790
00:50:35.271 --> 00:50:39.920
than human and saying it's gross,
that you even give them a chance,

791
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:42.500
well you're gonna get a different kind of neighbor back.

792
00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:45.140
The kind of neighbor that is going to scare you,

793
00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:47.330
the kind of neighbor that none of us want.

794
00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:50.903
<v 2>Thank you.</v>

795
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.460
<v 1>You mentioned something earlier that I think is,
is worth underscoring,</v>

796
00:50:55.461 --> 00:50:57.360
which is the question.
Uh,

797
00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:02.420
and I'd be curious to know how people respond if you actually pose this to them,

798
00:51:02.421 --> 00:51:04.010
whether they're volunteers or otherwise.

799
00:51:04.011 --> 00:51:07.220
But what if you were only known for the worst thing you've ever done?

800
00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:10.040
Do you actually pose that or is it more of a hype,

801
00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:14.030
a rhetorical question?

802
00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:19.720
<v 3>I do a lot of speaking engagements and I opened with that in nearly every single</v>

803
00:51:21.141 --> 00:51:22.900
time.
And I asked people,

804
00:51:22.901 --> 00:51:27.320
I think back to the action that you regret the most in your life.

805
00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:32.120
Think about the labels that would be attached to that,
like drunk,

806
00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:37.400
cheater,
adult or I don't know what it is.
You know,

807
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:42.260
and now imagine if for the rest of your life,
like say it's 20 years later,

808
00:51:42.261 --> 00:51:45.530
say you've paid the consequences in full for whatever mistake you made,

809
00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:50.840
but now you are predominantly known as extra UNC x,
cheater,

810
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:53.390
acts,
embezzler x liar,

811
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:57.380
x Shitty dad x,
whatever it is.

812
00:51:57.650 --> 00:52:01.320
And you go fill out a job application and at the top of your job application and

813
00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:05.120
it's the first thing that you have to check the box on even though it's 20 years

814
00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:10.121
later and next time that you want to rent an apartment or get a mortgage.

815
00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:14.180
It's the first thing you have to write your ex label.

816
00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:19.720
They're the people that I serve have paid their debt to society,

817
00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:26.740
but for the rest of their lives they are known as an ex drug dealer or an ex

818
00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:29.060
show in the blank.

819
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:35.710
What would your life be like if you were handcuffed by your most shameful

820
00:52:36.381 --> 00:52:37.214
moment?

821
00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:38.853
<v 2>Okay,</v>

822
00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:40.061
<v 1>well this,</v>

823
00:52:40.061 --> 00:52:45.061
this is I suppose as good a place as any to segue into forgiveness,

824
00:52:47.951 --> 00:52:50.380
but the way we're going to get there,
because I,

825
00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:54.910
I remember when I was chatting with with Seth,
I wanted to know how,

826
00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:59.970
how openly we could talk about different parts of your biography and your bio on

827
00:53:02.141 --> 00:53:05.560
the website begins with after being given a second chance of her own.

828
00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:10.000
Can you explain what that refers to?

829
00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:12.493
<v 3>Sure.</v>

830
00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:17.830
And it should probably say after being given so many second chances of her own

831
00:53:18.291 --> 00:53:19.760
in third and fourth chances.

832
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:25.630
But I will share them mistake the bad decisions I am most known for since I ask

833
00:53:29.341 --> 00:53:32.700
other people,
would it be like for them if they were known for that worst thing.

834
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:34.290
So the,

835
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:39.710
the short version of it is that after devoting my life to working with people

836
00:53:41.791 --> 00:53:43.830
with criminal histories and moved to Texas,

837
00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:47.230
I started what became known as prison entrepreneurship program pep.

838
00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:50.700
And it's still going there today.
And I poured my everything into it.

839
00:53:50.701 --> 00:53:54.210
I had $50,000 in my bank account.
It wasn't enough.

840
00:53:54.211 --> 00:53:59.211
I cashed out my 401k because working with these people and making sure that they

841
00:53:59.791 --> 00:54:03.590
had a bright future was more important than my own financial stability.
I,

842
00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:08.700
I went all in on this and for five years I built up pep to be a very successful,

843
00:54:12.050 --> 00:54:12.450
uh,

844
00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:17.450
prison rehabilitation program that was equipping men in the Texas prison system

845
00:54:17.881 --> 00:54:21.660
to become successful legal entrepreneurs.
But more than that,

846
00:54:21.661 --> 00:54:26.160
also employees and fathers and voices in their communities.

847
00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:29.850
And then I tanked.

848
00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:35.060
I made decisions that I thought ruined my everything in my entire future.

849
00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:39.680
So I had been married,
I was married the first time for nine years.

850
00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:43.020
I got married when I was 22.
At the age of 31.

851
00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:48.390
I was served divorce papers and I was living in Texas and a very Christian

852
00:54:48.391 --> 00:54:52.410
community where God hates divorce and divorce this in.

853
00:54:52.411 --> 00:54:54.990
And I was so ashamed.
I said,
the one thing I would never be,

854
00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:59.970
it was a divorced woman.
And here I was,
um,
a divorced woman.

855
00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:01.860
And uh,

856
00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:06.330
following my divorce I also went through a lot of hard times.

857
00:55:06.331 --> 00:55:09.360
I was sick with pneumonia,
I was hospitalized.

858
00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:14.400
I had to move out of my house and instead of reaching out to friends or a

859
00:55:14.401 --> 00:55:19.080
community that would have been supportive of me and my own shame over my
divorce,

860
00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:22.860
I put my head in the sand and I felt so alone.

861
00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:26.610
And like when I was in the hospital and didn't know who to call to come pick me

862
00:55:26.611 --> 00:55:31.560
up,
that was one of the loneliest,
worst moments that I can remember.
Well,

863
00:55:31.561 --> 00:55:36.561
the people that I felt comfortable confiding in over my personal failure were

864
00:55:37.921 --> 00:55:41.370
released graduates from the Texas prison system.

865
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:47.150
And so the people who picked me up from the hospital graduates people packed my

866
00:55:47.431 --> 00:55:49.530
boxes and leave me out of my house.
Like,
you know,

867
00:55:49.531 --> 00:55:53.400
I had been taking care of people for a long time and now I was at my bottom and

868
00:55:53.401 --> 00:55:56.550
needed to be taken care of in a moment of weakness.

869
00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:02.000
I crossed boundaries and I had some relationships with people who had been

870
00:56:02.101 --> 00:56:04.980
released in the Texas prison system.

871
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.710
What I did was not illegal,
but I knew better.

872
00:56:11.610 --> 00:56:13.560
I absolutely shouldn't have done it.

873
00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:17.610
I regretted it right after.
Um,

874
00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:22.880
I've always taught my graduates a model of disclosure.

875
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:28.840
Own your mistakes and,
and share it.
Don't get caught.

876
00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:31.170
And so I,

877
00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:36.210
I followed my own advice and I was honest about my poor decisions and it cost me

878
00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:44.200
my everything at the time.
It cost me everything.
I,
um,

879
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:48.910
the Texas prison system,
when I learned about my decisions,

880
00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:53.080
they forced my resignation and they forced it.

881
00:56:53.081 --> 00:56:54.410
This was eight years ago now.

882
00:56:54.411 --> 00:56:58.210
And they forced it in the media too because up until that moment,

883
00:56:58.250 --> 00:56:59.170
I hadn't been known.

884
00:56:59.171 --> 00:57:02.950
People call me the prison angel who ministered to the dark side.

885
00:57:02.951 --> 00:57:07.780
That was absolutely not true,
but,
um,
uh,
people had,
uh,

886
00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:12.760
like Mother Teresa image of me.
And um,

887
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:16.390
because I was not like known for big mistakes yet.

888
00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:21.580
And then my news came crashing in the media and I became known for a sex scandal

889
00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:25.870
instead of the good work that I had poured my life into and I,

890
00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:29.350
I was already suffering from so much shame.

891
00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:34.890
So now to be known for this and to get the ejector seat from my own organization

892
00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:40.051
to lose my identity as a passionate young founder and CEO to lease my identity

893
00:57:40.181 --> 00:57:44.920
as a wife,
I felt like I had ruined God's calling from my life.

894
00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:49.030
I saw no reason to live anymore.
I didn't want to live anymore.

895
00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:54.930
And what saved my life was that shortly before my scandal went out across the

896
00:57:58.871 --> 00:57:59.950
national media,

897
00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:04.900
I sent out a full disclosure letter and at the time we had 7,500 supporters,

898
00:58:04.901 --> 00:58:08.200
top CEOs and investors and people are respected more than anyone in the world.

899
00:58:08.201 --> 00:58:12.070
And I said,
I screwed up.
I made these bad decisions.

900
00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:15.010
I'm a divorced woman.
I don't know what's next in my life.

901
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.100
Sending that letter is super painful for me.

902
00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:22.030
But within about 24 hours of sending it,

903
00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:27.540
my inbox filled up with nearly a thousand emails of love and support and you've

904
00:58:29.021 --> 00:58:33.430
always preached grace and second chances and what are you doing next with your

905
00:58:33.431 --> 00:58:36.520
life?
And if you can't tell,

906
00:58:36.521 --> 00:58:39.430
I'm an all in person and I had no plan B,

907
00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:42.070
but it was people,

908
00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:48.300
other human beings saw potential in me when I saw no potential in me.

909
00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:54.460
I used to think like what happens to leaders like me?
He screw up.

910
00:58:54.461 --> 00:58:58.430
Is there like some island for castaways?

911
00:58:58.431 --> 00:59:00.710
Like do we all go surf Starbucks similar or like what do we,

912
00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:03.730
I have no vision for a better future.

913
00:59:03.731 --> 00:59:06.670
All I could see was dark clouds and no reason to live anymore.

914
00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:12.220
And the fact that people saw potential and future in me,

915
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:16.300
and more than that,
I would say the fact that people,

916
00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:20.410
and I took a year off after my resignation to just,

917
00:59:20.411 --> 00:59:22.980
I went to massive therapy.
I've,

918
00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:25.970
I'd already been through massive therapy and I went to like these leadership

919
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:29.750
blow up camps where like other CEOs and even pastors go,

920
00:59:29.751 --> 00:59:32.270
I guess I wasn't the only person I screw up my life.

921
00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:36.260
And when I went there

922
00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:42.680
and other people had the opportunity to care for me,

923
00:59:43.410 --> 00:59:46.800
like I have these people,
I call my adopted parents and they said,

924
00:59:46.801 --> 00:59:49.680
just come stay with us for awhile.
I hardly knew these people at the time.

925
00:59:49.681 --> 00:59:51.750
And he said,
and we will love you back to life.

926
00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:55.530
I have nothing to offer people I learned for the first time.

927
00:59:56.370 --> 00:59:58.920
How did you meet these adoptive parents?

928
01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:05.360
So their names are bill and Andrea Townsend and bill had,

929
01:00:08.101 --> 01:00:11.940
Bill is a serial entrepreneur who lives in Salt Lake City,
Utah.

930
01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:16.530
And he had,
um,
sent pee pee,

931
01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:21.270
my Texas organization,
a big fat check.
And I couldn't tell it was from him.

932
01:00:21.271 --> 01:00:24.780
I had to like do a lot of due diligence to track down who it was from,

933
01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:28.500
which is weird because usually I know where the money's coming from.

934
01:00:29.010 --> 01:00:31.260
And then when I finally found out it was from him,

935
01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:36.090
I requested to meet with him and the logistics as,

936
01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:37.080
as it turned out,

937
01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:42.110
I had like a super short meeting with him in an airport for like 30 minutes.

938
01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:46.890
And when I met with him,
he was like,
thank you for the work you do.
I was like,

939
01:00:46.891 --> 01:00:49.560
thank you for the big fat check that you wrote me.
And he's like,
no,

940
01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:53.760
thank you for the work that you do.
His whole demeanor was really different.

941
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.710
He was just thankful that I was

942
01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.320
serving the world and not everybody's like that about it.

943
01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:04.680
And then we're really struck me about that meeting with Dell is like,

944
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:08.510
so bill loves God and grace and he said,

945
01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:14.090
do you serve people with sexual criminal histories?
And I said,

946
01:01:14.091 --> 01:01:18.290
no.
Uh,
the Texas prison system won't allow us to serve that.

947
01:01:18.291 --> 01:01:21.440
I believe all things can be redeemed.
And look,
I'm going to say this right now,

948
01:01:21.441 --> 01:01:25.730
Tim,
nobody likes sexual crime,

949
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:31.730
especially not me.
Um,
having been a victim of that myself,

950
01:01:32.090 --> 01:01:33.260
nobody likes that.

951
01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:39.040
But if people with even ugly crimes don't have an opportunity at rebuild it,

952
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:42.860
those are the crimes that we don't want repeated in society.
Right?
So anyway,

953
01:01:42.861 --> 01:01:46.550
Bill said to me,
do you serve people who have committed those crimes?
And I said,

954
01:01:46.551 --> 01:01:50.060
no,
because the Texas prison system won't let me.
And he said,
well,

955
01:01:50.450 --> 01:01:53.180
what if we started a different organization,

956
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:57.350
like a separate umbrella that served those people?
And I said,
well,
you know,

957
01:01:57.351 --> 01:01:58.330
maybe that'd be a nice thing.

958
01:01:58.331 --> 01:02:01.610
I think about my future because a lot of my Texas donors,

959
01:02:01.611 --> 01:02:05.540
when they find out that I don't serve people with a certain crime category,

960
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:07.360
they're relieved and they're so glad.

961
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:11.300
They sometimes tell me they wouldn't fund me if I serve those people,

962
01:02:11.301 --> 01:02:13.400
which always surprises me because I'm like,

963
01:02:13.401 --> 01:02:16.160
why wouldn't you want those people rehabilitated?
Anyway?

964
01:02:16.790 --> 01:02:19.650
I'm kind of deviating right now.
But,
um,
you know,

965
01:02:19.651 --> 01:02:24.651
Bill had a really different heart and bill had no reason to care about those

966
01:02:24.931 --> 01:02:26.550
people.
But I think bill,

967
01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:32.450
Bill cares about people who have been written off and stigmatized and bill and

968
01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.770
Andrea have this ability to see potential in anybody.

969
01:02:37.771 --> 01:02:41.400
It's like they see the world through these rosy colored glasses and they're by

970
01:02:41.401 --> 01:02:46.140
no means,
uh,
like naive human beings.
Um,

971
01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:49.590
so they're the first ones who called me after I sent out my resignation letter

972
01:02:49.591 --> 01:02:54.591
to 7,500 people and I was drowning and shame and self hate and disgust.

973
01:02:56.310 --> 01:03:00.540
And my phone rang.
Bill calls me like half an hour later or something.

974
01:03:00.541 --> 01:03:03.660
And he said,
sweetie,
we love you.

975
01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:09.300
Come stay with us.
And I was like,
who are you?
You know,
who are you?

976
01:03:09.301 --> 01:03:13.410
I'm like a scandalous divorced woman with nothing to offer.
I hardly know you.

977
01:03:13.411 --> 01:03:14.940
I've never met your wife.
And he's like,

978
01:03:14.941 --> 01:03:19.650
come stay with us and we'll love you back to life.
Well,
I had nothing to lose.

979
01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:24.710
I was at the bottom of myself and I was willing to do anything.

980
01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:28.050
And I thought I was so gross that I said yes.

981
01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:33.890
And there was a small group of amazing people who poured into me and that year

982
01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:40.740
and made me think that I still had potential.

983
01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.610
And
I don't tell my story all the time,

984
01:03:44.611 --> 01:03:46.920
so I don't know life emotional right now,
but,
um,

985
01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:49.740
it's because people

986
01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:55.860
saw something in me when I had,
I thought I had nothing left,

987
01:03:56.100 --> 01:04:00.540
that I am such a believer in.
Second,

988
01:04:00.541 --> 01:04:04.260
chances are what I believe is actually legitimate.
First chances now,

989
01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:09.320
and much of the world thinks that the people that I serve are so rotten or that

990
01:04:10.981 --> 01:04:13.890
they have no value and I know better.

991
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:18.950
I know that hope is a cure for violence and I know that they've done such

992
01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:26.440
Korbel,
hurtful things.
I know that for the most part,
horrible,

993
01:04:26.441 --> 01:04:28.210
hurtful things have been done to them.

994
01:04:28.690 --> 01:04:31.810
And I know that unless there's some intervention in,

995
01:04:31.811 --> 01:04:36.160
many people don't want to get their hands dirty and do this kind of work unless

996
01:04:36.161 --> 01:04:37.600
there's some kind of intervention.

997
01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:42.040
This will be a generational legacy of incarceration and violence and crime and

998
01:04:42.041 --> 01:04:46.810
drug abuse and so big fat waste of taxpayer dollars and it hurts more people.

999
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:52.670
And the solution that I've come up with that is not just business,

1000
01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:58.020
but it's also about love and healing and redemption.

1001
01:04:58.170 --> 01:05:02.520
It works all day long and it works with,
when I started a new,

1002
01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:03.870
a new prison system,

1003
01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:08.940
I tell the commissioner the prison system and the wardens send me to your hell

1004
01:05:08.941 --> 01:05:13.800
hole,
send me to the worst of the worst.
The guys who were fused to program.

1005
01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:19.610
And what I see time and time again is that no one is beyond redemption.

1006
01:05:21.581 --> 01:05:25.330
Some people don't want to change.
Okay.
And those guys I haven't nothing.

1007
01:05:25.331 --> 01:05:28.690
And talk to them about if they don't,
if they want to be criminals,

1008
01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:33.520
I tell them get out cause I don't cut for criminals.
Nobody likes criminals.

1009
01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:36.430
I hate criminals.
I don't work with criminals.

1010
01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:40.930
I work with people who take ownership of their past and who want a better
future.

1011
01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:49.320
<v 1>Thank you for that.
You're welcome.</v>

1012
01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.050
I'm just chewing on all that.

1013
01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:58.413
<v 3>Take your time.</v>

1014
01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:05.720
<v 1>Well there,
there are many questions and I will ask them all,</v>

1015
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:10.750
but I'll start with with one which is not related directly to the population you

1016
01:06:13.221 --> 01:06:15.080
work with.
It's much broader than that.

1017
01:06:15.110 --> 01:06:20.110
But when you talk to someone who is very unforgiving of themselves and let's

1018
01:06:22.821 --> 01:06:27.350
just say there is some catalyzing event that they are ashamed of or that they

1019
01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:32.180
find unbearable in themselves.
Right.

1020
01:06:32.330 --> 01:06:35.060
And the reason that this comes to mind is a,

1021
01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:41.200
historically I've been absolutely f minus student at forgiving myself for

1022
01:06:41.481 --> 01:06:41.961
anything.

1023
01:06:41.961 --> 01:06:46.880
And I find that that is very often paired with hyper competitiveness,

1024
01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:48.200
uh,

1025
01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:53.200
in the sense that if you look at people who are successful athletes and highly

1026
01:06:54.081 --> 01:06:58.910
competitive throughout school,
high school,
College,
whatever it might be,

1027
01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:00.043
uh,

1028
01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:07.450
it seems to very often be part and parcel of a package that includes a low level

1029
01:07:07.731 --> 01:07:10.550
of forgiveness.
I mean,
you are,
you've very,

1030
01:07:10.551 --> 01:07:15.551
very high standards for yourself and that in excess can be very damaging.

1031
01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:18.440
So when you,

1032
01:07:18.830 --> 01:07:23.400
if when you interact with someone who's has very difficult time forgiving

1033
01:07:23.450 --> 01:07:27.350
themselves,
uh,
or just for people listening for that matter,
like what are

1034
01:07:29.030 --> 01:07:31.340
the recommendations that you make?
What are the things you say,

1035
01:07:31.341 --> 01:07:35.180
what are the books you recommend?
I mean,
it could go in any number of directions,

1036
01:07:35.181 --> 01:07:40.181
but I'll leave it open ended because that's all that comes to mind at the

1037
01:07:40.221 --> 01:07:41.930
moment.
But what do you,
what do you say to those people?

1038
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:48.510
<v 3>You are not your past as hard as it might be to believe,</v>

1039
01:07:50.231 --> 01:07:54.190
especially if you're currently suffering the consequences of your past decision.

1040
01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:57.100
You are not your past.

1041
01:07:57.130 --> 01:08:01.390
You are not one decision or five decisions that you've made in your life.

1042
01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:05.470
And I don't just believe,

1043
01:08:05.530 --> 01:08:10.530
I know that every one of us is capable of having a better future than we've had

1044
01:08:12.041 --> 01:08:12.910
in our past.

1045
01:08:13.570 --> 01:08:18.570
But there are some steps that we to take to live a better future.

1046
01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:20.210
So first of all,

1047
01:08:20.211 --> 01:08:24.440
recognize that you are not your past and you're not that label because if you

1048
01:08:24.710 --> 01:08:27.500
keep calling yourself that whatever it is,

1049
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:31.910
you're going to keep probably acting that way,
that belief,
expectation cycle.

1050
01:08:31.911 --> 01:08:35.630
When we have a belief about ourselves and we expect that that's going to be true

1051
01:08:35.631 --> 01:08:36.381
about ourselves.

1052
01:08:36.381 --> 01:08:39.170
And then we ended up acting that way and we have more experiences,

1053
01:08:39.171 --> 01:08:41.840
which just confirms that belief that we have about ourselves.

1054
01:08:41.841 --> 01:08:45.890
So in prison when our volunteers,
including our CEOs come in,

1055
01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:47.450
I say,

1056
01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:54.770
talk to share with your partner what Your Voice of shame is in your head.

1057
01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:59.000
That tape of shame that he puts keeps playing in your head.
What does it say?

1058
01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.600
Say it out loud and people are regularly say the same thing,

1059
01:09:02.601 --> 01:09:06.500
whether they're incarcerated or whether the CEO of $1 billion company and that

1060
01:09:06.501 --> 01:09:11.210
voice is often you are not good enough.
You are a failure.

1061
01:09:11.690 --> 01:09:16.460
You are a sucky dad.
You're a loser.
You'll be just like your father.

1062
01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:19.970
Like these are the same messages of shame.

1063
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.130
So I don't know what your messages of shame is,

1064
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:25.850
but start by identifying that and then I say,

1065
01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:30.500
can you believe that you talk to yourself this way?
It's so ugly.

1066
01:09:30.501 --> 01:09:34.340
Would you allow anyone else to walk up to you and be like,
you're a loser.

1067
01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.080
You will never amount to anything.

1068
01:09:37.190 --> 01:09:42.190
And I don't know anyone who has any ounce of dignity or even who doesn't,

1069
01:09:42.501 --> 01:09:45.590
who would allow another human being to walk up and get in their face and say

1070
01:09:45.591 --> 01:09:46.370
that.

1071
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:51.370
But many of us are not only tolerant of that voice of shame that we feed

1072
01:09:53.391 --> 01:09:57.620
ourselves all day long.
It's almost like we encourage it.
Like we say,

1073
01:09:57.621 --> 01:10:01.670
yeah you are a loser and we keep pounding that into our own brains.

1074
01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:06.700
And so had to fi we do something called affirmations and it's cheesy and I tell

1075
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:11.330
our EIT is fake it till you make it,

1076
01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:15.140
pick your head up and I want you belting this out at the top of your lungs.

1077
01:10:15.141 --> 01:10:20.141
Like you're a proud army and they say things like I am worthy of the love I am

1078
01:10:21.171 --> 01:10:24.350
receiving,
I am an entrepreneur,

1079
01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:27.710
I forgive me,
I am forgiven.

1080
01:10:27.711 --> 01:10:32.711
And we have a whole list of affirmations and we also go through this exercise

1081
01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:37.810
where they identify what is called self limiting beliefs like lies that we tell

1082
01:10:39.111 --> 01:10:39.944
ourselves.

1083
01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:44.960
And the problem with this exercise is that sometimes it's really hard to

1084
01:10:44.961 --> 01:10:47.120
identify the log that is in our own eye.

1085
01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:50.960
So sometimes our friends can hear it come out in our,
like if I'm like,

1086
01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:55.790
oh I'm going to fail in this podcast with Tim.
Like,
if I say that aloud,

1087
01:10:55.791 --> 01:10:58.190
maybe a friend of mine can pick up on that and be like,

1088
01:10:58.220 --> 01:10:59.660
that's one of your self limiting beliefs.

1089
01:10:59.661 --> 01:11:03.350
And then we have them write out their self-freeing beliefs and then we tell them

1090
01:11:03.351 --> 01:11:05.420
to meditate on it every day,

1091
01:11:05.421 --> 01:11:10.421
every morning for a minimum of 30 days and then read it aloud to somebody else.

1092
01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:12.860
But a lot of,
a lot of

1093
01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:19.670
the message of shame is what we say is a choice to forgive.

1094
01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:26.810
And what we teach at defy is that forgiveness is not a feeling.

1095
01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.520
You're not going to feel like forgiving yourself.

1096
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:32.100
And forgiveness is not something that we earn.

1097
01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:37.160
There's no amount of good deeds that you can make up for your victims pain or

1098
01:11:37.531 --> 01:11:40.800
loss.
And if you're waiting for that to happen,
you're never going to get there.

1099
01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:43.290
And I asked the questions like,

1100
01:11:43.530 --> 01:11:48.530
who would you be if you chose to forgive yourself and why aren't you forgiving

1101
01:11:50.101 --> 01:11:54.600
yourself?
Or why aren't you forgetting somebody else?
And,

1102
01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:55.260
and I asked,

1103
01:11:55.260 --> 01:12:00.060
think back to the most painful thing that has ever been done to you.

1104
01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:03.840
The person who's a funny d the most,
a person that you cannot forgive her.

1105
01:12:03.841 --> 01:12:07.950
She used to forgive.
When you think back to that incident,

1106
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:12.060
what are the feelings that brew in your heart?

1107
01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:18.690
And the answers are usually like with revenge or vengeance or hate,

1108
01:12:19.230 --> 01:12:22.740
depression,
pain,
you know,
I've never heard of a good thing and I'm like,

1109
01:12:22.741 --> 01:12:26.670
all right,
well great.
So you have a choice here.
You want to keep that big ball.

1110
01:12:26.671 --> 01:12:28.350
I hate all to yourself.

1111
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:34.310
You know when I think back to the last time that your hate decided for you,

1112
01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:40.680
when we don't forgive ourselves or others,

1113
01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:45.740
we live in the past and at defy our program is called CEO of your new life.

1114
01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:53.190
We're all here and I bet every one of your listeners,

1115
01:12:53.191 --> 01:12:55.320
Tim is here because they want a better future.

1116
01:12:56.790 --> 01:13:00.150
So if you choose unforgiveness,

1117
01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:03.840
you're choosing to be shackled by your past,

1118
01:13:05.490 --> 01:13:08.580
your own past decisions or your past feelings of negativity.

1119
01:13:08.581 --> 01:13:13.581
But somebody else and the people I serve are physically incarcerated.

1120
01:13:15.481 --> 01:13:16.560
Their bodies are locked up,

1121
01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:21.590
but we're the only ones who can incarcerate our mind and our heart.

1122
01:13:22.770 --> 01:13:27.770
And I know so many people on this side of the fences who are not incarcerated,

1123
01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:34.940
who lives like they're locked up because you pound your brain with hateful

1124
01:13:35.701 --> 01:13:38.580
messages that keep you from living your best.

1125
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:43.440
So what I say is if you want forgiveness,
it's actually quite simple.

1126
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:48.540
People say,
Oh,
it's easier,
sounds easier than it is.
Actually.
It's really simple.

1127
01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.470
Say I forgive me or I forgive him.

1128
01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:56.100
And then I'm a super stubborn person.

1129
01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.960
And so I say get stubborn about forgiveness.
Because if I say,
oh,
I forgive me,

1130
01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:02.460
like I forgive me for my scandal,

1131
01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:06.570
then two seconds later my brain's going to shoot back.
No you don't.

1132
01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.720
You lose loser.
You suck a lot of that.
And I like that whole negative message.

1133
01:14:10.290 --> 01:14:15.100
So then if I get stubborn about forgiveness,
I say,
no brain,
I forgive me,

1134
01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:20.350
I forgive me,
I forgive me.
And I say it over and over again.

1135
01:14:20.351 --> 01:14:23.770
And then the next morning I guarantee you my stubborn Marines gonna wake up and

1136
01:14:23.771 --> 01:14:27.820
tell me how much I suck again.
And then I overpower it.

1137
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.590
And then it's not just me.

1138
01:14:29.591 --> 01:14:33.580
But if I can find a friend who believes in grace and second chances,

1139
01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:35.590
I can tell them,
hey,
I'm struggling with this.

1140
01:14:35.591 --> 01:14:37.390
My brain is telling me how much I suck.

1141
01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.890
Do you forgive me even if I didn't offend you,

1142
01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:46.630
and if that person washes the dirty water in my own brain,

1143
01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:49.720
it's pretty helpful in it.
Defy,

1144
01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:54.430
I think a reason why are amazing CEOs,

1145
01:14:54.431 --> 01:14:59.431
we have 4,400 volunteers and I think people keep coming back to us because when

1146
01:14:59.981 --> 01:15:04.390
they're there in prison with us and we have events outside of prison too,

1147
01:15:04.690 --> 01:15:09.690
people are part of a community that rallies around shared values of forgiveness

1148
01:15:10.090 --> 01:15:11.110
and second chances,

1149
01:15:11.530 --> 01:15:15.100
and I don't care how fancy your credentials are when you're in prison,

1150
01:15:15.101 --> 01:15:19.300
you're just a human who has made mistakes and even though you've made those

1151
01:15:19.301 --> 01:15:20.134
mistakes,

1152
01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:25.500
you are lovable and you are acceptable and you are worthy and you are good

1153
01:15:27.581 --> 01:15:30.190
enough and if you come with us,

1154
01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:32.860
you're going to feel that in your bones.

1155
01:15:33.730 --> 01:15:35.860
So get stubborn about forgiveness.

1156
01:15:35.890 --> 01:15:38.050
If there's one message I could share with the world,

1157
01:15:38.051 --> 01:15:39.790
if there's one impact I could have,

1158
01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:43.300
I don't think it even be about prison.

1159
01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:48.360
It would be choose forgiveness for yourself and for others who have hurt you.

1160
01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:54.580
And if you forgive them,
maybe one day your feelings will catch up,

1161
01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:58.270
but it might help you to reshape a whole new future.

1162
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:07.570
<v 1>So you mentioned a few things I'd love to repeat for myself as much as anyone</v>

1163
01:16:07.571 --> 01:16:11.440
else and maybe explore a bit.

1164
01:16:11.441 --> 01:16:13.480
The first was hope is a cure for violence.

1165
01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:18.520
And I think that that's true,
certainly true.

1166
01:16:18.521 --> 01:16:19.690
Many different senses,

1167
01:16:20.410 --> 01:16:25.020
whether that is violence towards others or violence towards yourself,
right?

1168
01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:31.020
And that violence towards yourself can just be the incessant variating and self

1169
01:16:31.751 --> 01:16:35.630
loathing and self flagellating,
which is something that I've been,

1170
01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:40.360
I've vastly improved in the last six to 12 months for a host of reasons that we

1171
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:43.030
don't have the bandwidth to get into right now.
But

1172
01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:49.800
that was the constant companion that I had for 2035 years,

1173
01:16:50.951 --> 01:16:54.400
whatever the total span of time was.
And

1174
01:16:55.990 --> 01:17:00.990
I'd also say that APP for affirmations is as cheesy as they might sound.

1175
01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:05.710
And people who are old enough to remember,
what was it,

1176
01:17:05.711 --> 01:17:09.830
Stuart smally in the mirrors.
I don't know if you ever heard of that name at all,

1177
01:17:09.831 --> 01:17:14.080
but you know,
I am good enough.
I am BN Dash Gardner people like me.

1178
01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:18.980
Sad.
I think it was Saturday night live.
I think it was Al Franken.
Now senator,

1179
01:17:18.981 --> 01:17:21.590
right?
Crazy.
In any case,
uh,

1180
01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:26.740
the fact of the matter is that many of the people I've had on this podcast use

1181
01:17:27.171 --> 01:17:29.030
affirmations in different forums.

1182
01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:33.680
And Scott Adams is one example,
the creator of Dilbert.
So he used,

1183
01:17:33.681 --> 01:17:38.510
he is used affirmations in many different ways,
uh,

1184
01:17:38.511 --> 01:17:39.830
over time and credits,

1185
01:17:39.831 --> 01:17:44.580
many of his biggest career successes to affirmations.
It's,

1186
01:17:44.581 --> 01:17:47.570
it's not just for,
uh,

1187
01:17:47.690 --> 01:17:50.810
entrepreneurs in training who you work with.
So there is,

1188
01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:55.580
there is a place for that.
And the next is something you didn't say,

1189
01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:58.610
but that I've been a suggestion.

1190
01:17:58.850 --> 01:18:03.230
It's been suggested by our mutual friend set that I ask you about it.
Uh,

1191
01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:07.250
which is a quote,
I don't know the context or the background.

1192
01:18:07.251 --> 01:18:08.810
So maybe you can give it to me.
You,

1193
01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:11.330
you can't be angry and curious at the same time.

1194
01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:13.871
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1195
01:18:13.871 --> 01:18:18.670
I learned that from a friend of mine named Dan Dakini who does some of our

1196
01:18:18.671 --> 01:18:21.970
character development courses for defy,

1197
01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:26.500
but I've seen that in my life like when I'm angry,

1198
01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:32.370
my brain seems to think it's really write about whatever I'm angry about and so

1199
01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:41.350
if I realize that my brain can't be angry and truest at the same time,

1200
01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:46.780
if I choose to set aside my own judgments or need to be right,

1201
01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:52.320
then I can ask questions and a lot of what we do at defy is working on creating

1202
01:18:52.930 --> 01:18:56.410
empathy and understanding where the other side is coming from.

1203
01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:02.170
And it's amazing what a case I can build in my own brain.

1204
01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:06.460
But then when I start to understand the other person's pain or point of view

1205
01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:09.260
how wrong I can be.

1206
01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:15.060
<v 1>What would be an example of a situation or a concrete example of an other side?</v>

1207
01:19:16.690 --> 01:19:21.520
Just so we have cause can conjure an image for people of what this looks like in

1208
01:19:21.521 --> 01:19:22.354
action.

1209
01:19:22.610 --> 01:19:27.020
<v 3>Boy,
anytime that I'm going to fight or an argument with anybody,
right?
I'm like,</v>

1210
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:31.820
my,
my side is right because I believe this and you're wrong.

1211
01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:36.020
And my decisions the right way to go.
And um,

1212
01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:37.573
and my,

1213
01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:42.050
especially when I am making a decision that I think is based on a lot of

1214
01:19:42.051 --> 01:19:46.670
experience or data,
it's so easy for my brain and just jumped to that conclusion.

1215
01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:48.500
And that's arrogance.
I mean,

1216
01:19:48.501 --> 01:19:51.470
sometimes it's experience or whatever you can call it,

1217
01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:57.040
but maybe I'm completely missing something new about the situation.

1218
01:19:57.230 --> 01:20:01.670
Or maybe I'm actually write about my conclusion or a decision about a certain

1219
01:20:01.671 --> 01:20:03.380
business situation,
for example.

1220
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:08.130
But maybe I'm completely missing the way that I'm making someone feel through my

1221
01:20:08.131 --> 01:20:12.510
decision.
And if the way that I'm making that person feel as important to me,

1222
01:20:12.511 --> 01:20:16.560
then maybe I should reconsider my course of action as well.
Does that make sense?

1223
01:20:16.990 --> 01:20:18.370
<v 1>Yeah,
that does make sense.</v>

1224
01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:23.320
And I wanted to clarify one other thing you said earlier,
which was the,

1225
01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:28.150
I think it was a morning meditation on beliefs.

1226
01:20:28.151 --> 01:20:32.950
Can you walk us through what you're entrepreneurs and training are actually

1227
01:20:32.951 --> 01:20:33.970
doing each one?

1228
01:20:34.170 --> 01:20:37.090
<v 3>Sure.
What,
what,
what does a session look like?
So,</v>

1229
01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:38.450
<v 0>okay,</v>

1230
01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:40.370
<v 3>there is self limiting beliefs,</v>

1231
01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:45.400
which is the negative tape that is playing in our brain.

1232
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:48.920
Whether we realize that,
that that tape is playing or not.

1233
01:20:49.490 --> 01:20:54.490
And then the exercise is to replace this self-freeing beliefs or sorry,

1234
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:59.950
this to replace the self limiting beliefs with self freeing beliefs.

1235
01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:05.300
Now,
according to our course and self limiting beliefs,

1236
01:21:06.170 --> 01:21:11.170
these can be lies that sometimes we don't even realize that we're telling them

1237
01:21:11.751 --> 01:21:16.751
to ourselves because we just adopted them through experiences that we might've

1238
01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.030
had when we were three years old.

1239
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:23.870
And we can have self limiting beliefs about ourselves,

1240
01:21:24.230 --> 01:21:28.310
about other people,
about God,
really about anything.

1241
01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:30.690
So I'll give you an example.
Um,

1242
01:21:30.770 --> 01:21:35.770
one of our EIT s was telling me that when he was three years old,

1243
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:41.030
he was found by CPS in a dumpster.

1244
01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:46.480
His child prior logical child protective services literally found him in a

1245
01:21:47.901 --> 01:21:52.880
dumpster and that was in his file.
So this self limiting beliefs,

1246
01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:56.300
if you're found in a dumpster that could form out of that,

1247
01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:59.830
whether you're aware of them or not,
might be,
um,

1248
01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:04.190
nobody loves me.
I can never trust authorities.

1249
01:22:04.610 --> 01:22:09.230
I do not belong.
I was not wanted in the world.
Um,

1250
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:11.060
I am trash,
right?

1251
01:22:11.061 --> 01:22:14.090
Like there's so many self limiting beliefs that could come out of that.

1252
01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:19.750
And if we never take a moment to realize the values that have shaped us and

1253
01:22:22.191 --> 01:22:26.450
where they came from because values are often just handed to us through our

1254
01:22:26.451 --> 01:22:31.130
parents or our lack of parents or through religion or culture.

1255
01:22:31.610 --> 01:22:35.060
Um,
so if that guy never stops to think about that,

1256
01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:37.220
then he's now an adult man.

1257
01:22:37.250 --> 01:22:42.050
He's 30 years old thinking I am a piece of trash.
Well,

1258
01:22:43.530 --> 01:22:46.830
if we think that we're a piece of trash and this relates to like,

1259
01:22:46.831 --> 01:22:48.150
hope is a cure for violence.

1260
01:22:48.151 --> 01:22:51.000
If I think I'm a piece of trash will never amount to anything.

1261
01:22:51.870 --> 01:22:54.180
Why not just go do destructive things?

1262
01:22:54.181 --> 01:22:57.690
Because sometimes if I do destructive things,
I get attention for it.

1263
01:22:58.350 --> 01:23:03.300
And uh,
sometimes hurting myself feels good.

1264
01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:08.050
Sometimes it makes me feel alive when I feel like I'm not worthy of living

1265
01:23:08.051 --> 01:23:11.060
anyway.
So I'll continue to hurt other people.

1266
01:23:11.061 --> 01:23:14.270
I'm throwing myself away because you know what?
My Dad was in prison too,

1267
01:23:14.271 --> 01:23:17.750
from what I learned and I belong in this place.

1268
01:23:19.050 --> 01:23:24.050
Well that's if that guy is able to replace these values with positive ones that

1269
01:23:25.411 --> 01:23:30.411
he can find from a program like defy that he can find from positive friends that

1270
01:23:31.081 --> 01:23:36.081
he can find from most religions universally like,

1271
01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:41.220
um,
my life matters.
I can have a purpose.

1272
01:23:41.970 --> 01:23:46.080
What we tell people when they're writing their self-freeing beliefs is if you go

1273
01:23:46.081 --> 01:23:46.914
from

1274
01:23:48.210 --> 01:23:52.530
a self limiting belief to an unrealistic saw belief,

1275
01:23:52.531 --> 01:23:56.580
then you're feeding yourself,
uh,
you know,

1276
01:23:56.970 --> 01:24:00.990
something that your brain is never going to believe.
And so for example,

1277
01:24:01.050 --> 01:24:05.910
say you're not a very good looking human being and so you're a self limiting

1278
01:24:05.911 --> 01:24:10.740
belief is I am ugly,
therefore I will never get a date.
Well,

1279
01:24:10.741 --> 01:24:15.270
if you replace that with a self freeing belief of I'm a supermodel and I can

1280
01:24:15.271 --> 01:24:16.560
date anyone I want,

1281
01:24:17.010 --> 01:24:20.160
your brain will know that you're trying to trick yourself and it's not going to

1282
01:24:20.161 --> 01:24:20.994
be effective.

1283
01:24:21.630 --> 01:24:26.630
But if you replace that with a cell freeing belief that it says I have some

1284
01:24:26.731 --> 01:24:31.731
really nice features and I know that some people will appreciate me for who I am

1285
01:24:35.490 --> 01:24:38.340
and I have a great personality,
therefore I will,

1286
01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:42.960
I am capable of finding love in my life.
So that's a more,

1287
01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:44.430
I just made that up on the spot.

1288
01:24:44.431 --> 01:24:48.850
But like that's a more realistic version then I'm a supermodel.
Um,

1289
01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:51.590
so the person who was found in a dumpster,

1290
01:24:51.591 --> 01:24:54.960
if he replaces his self limiting belief with,

1291
01:24:56.410 --> 01:25:01.410
I know that I matter to some people in life and I don't matter to everybody,

1292
01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:08.650
but I'm okay even when some people don't see my value because I do have a

1293
01:25:08.651 --> 01:25:12.490
community of people who see value in me and for example,

1294
01:25:12.491 --> 01:25:17.491
then there define mentors and their fellow EIT is reinforced that message for

1295
01:25:18.341 --> 01:25:21.640
them.
That's a reality that can change your life in your future.

1296
01:25:21.670 --> 01:25:26.670
Because if you think that you matter in the world and that you're not a piece of

1297
01:25:27.071 --> 01:25:29.590
trash,
and if you say,

1298
01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:34.390
I have the ability to develop skills and an education that will lend me a job,

1299
01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:37.300
I have the ability to not only stay out of prison,

1300
01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.670
but to start a legal business that will thrive.

1301
01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:43.360
I know that I am in a program that supports me toward my goals,

1302
01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:46.690
then you're actually going to start working that way.
And,

1303
01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:51.280
and when you meditate on that every single morning and 30 days is not enough to

1304
01:25:51.281 --> 01:25:56.281
reverse a life time of negative brain trash and experiences that the backup,

1305
01:25:58.481 --> 01:26:01.660
the brain trash.
Um,
but if you meditate that on that,

1306
01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:03.860
you might actually see that become true for you.

1307
01:26:03.861 --> 01:26:07.790
So I've done this in my own life and I've seen so many of my own lives in my

1308
01:26:07.791 --> 01:26:12.230
head turn,
or for example,
some of our uits,
um,

1309
01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:16.160
like our male EIT is we're say abandoned by their mother who was a drug addict

1310
01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:20.090
and it,
or they were cheated on by their,
their girlfriends or their wives.

1311
01:26:20.091 --> 01:26:22.730
So they're like,
I will never trust another woman.
Okay.

1312
01:26:22.731 --> 01:26:24.020
That's a self limiting belief.
And I say,

1313
01:26:24.021 --> 01:26:25.760
how's that been serving you and your life?
You know,

1314
01:26:25.761 --> 01:26:28.520
so it's so freeing belief that my replace that is

1315
01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:35.080
I have developed judgment and discernment to know that there are some people who

1316
01:26:37.971 --> 01:26:39.620
will not have my best interest at heart,

1317
01:26:39.621 --> 01:26:44.150
but that there are other people that I can trust and I'm willing to trust.

1318
01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:47.390
So that's a more mature stuff.

1319
01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:51.050
Freeing belief that might lead to more opportunities in our lives.

1320
01:26:51.570 --> 01:26:54.820
<v 1>And is the military,
when you say meditate on it in the morning,</v>

1321
01:26:54.821 --> 01:26:59.350
is that reading list over and over again for a set period of time?
Is it?
Yep.

1322
01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:04.360
Great question.
Reading them out loud.
Is it memorizing them?

1323
01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:05.730
Yes.
Yes.

1324
01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:09.740
<v 3>Um,
read it to yourself,
which is great.</v>

1325
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:13.580
Reading it quietly as nice,
reading it aloud as better.

1326
01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:18.410
And then we have them partner up and we have a partner pounded into their brain.

1327
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:23.420
So have someone say it to you with conviction and um,

1328
01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:26.120
one of our Eids,
I love this.
He said,

1329
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:30.590
now every morning when I wake up,
I look in the mirror and I say,

1330
01:27:30.591 --> 01:27:31.424
I love you.

1331
01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:36.390
What would all of us in this world,

1332
01:27:38.190 --> 01:27:42.150
who would we be if we woke up every morning and we said with conviction in the

1333
01:27:42.151 --> 01:27:45.390
mirror,
I love you.
I believe in you.

1334
01:27:45.570 --> 01:27:47.580
You can do it today will be awesome.

1335
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:51.660
Cause if we actually believe that about ourselves,

1336
01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:55.560
we have no idea how much we're capable of.

1337
01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:58.620
How many good and beautiful acts or capable of

1338
01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:05.680
<v 1>here.
Here.
Yeah.
What are,</v>

1339
01:28:05.681 --> 01:28:10.681
what are some of the ingredients that make defy uniquely not necessarily

1340
01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:16.630
uniquely cause that implies that all of the rest or not,

1341
01:28:16.631 --> 01:28:19.990
but uniquely effective or effective.
Right.

1342
01:28:20.010 --> 01:28:22.780
And I'll give you an example.
Not that you need the time,

1343
01:28:22.781 --> 01:28:26.800
but I'll buy some time anyway
and I'll use it.

1344
01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:31.480
It's a different environment.
I went to an event,

1345
01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:35.590
my first Tony Robbins event,
but I want to say three or four years ago.

1346
01:28:35.770 --> 01:28:39.510
Unleash the power within.
And uh,

1347
01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:44.540
there are many things that you do or during this event there's the firewalk.

1348
01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:49.030
There are many different practices,
exercises,
partner drills,

1349
01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:51.250
jumping up and down,
you name it,
right?

1350
01:28:51.251 --> 01:28:56.251
It's kind of like rave plus Pentecostal church plus like Tony Robbins who I have

1351
01:28:56.770 --> 01:28:59.920
extremely high degree of respect and admiration for.

1352
01:28:59.921 --> 01:29:04.921
I've gotten to know over the last couple of all of that said you have many

1353
01:29:05.161 --> 01:29:07.620
different tools in the toolkit that are presented in.

1354
01:29:07.621 --> 01:29:11.130
One of them is something called the dickens process,

1355
01:29:11.131 --> 01:29:14.670
which I won't get into right now,
but it,
that exercise is the reason.

1356
01:29:14.671 --> 01:29:17.910
One of my friends who's a very successful CEO has gone to unleash the power

1357
01:29:17.911 --> 01:29:19.920
within 10 or 11 times.

1358
01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:24.950
It's primarily on an annual basis to have Tony lead this exercise called the

1359
01:29:25.921 --> 01:29:30.300
dickens process to identify specifically self limiting beliefs.

1360
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:33.450
Actually now that I think about it and replace them,
uh,

1361
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:38.510
what are some of the tools in the toolkit or the ingredients that make defy

1362
01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:41.033
effective?

1363
01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:46.680
<v 3>Our volunteers regularly say that our step to the line exercise is one of the</v>

1364
01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:56.950
most eye opening profound experiences,

1365
01:29:57.100 --> 01:30:00.100
not just of defy but of their lives.

1366
01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:03.150
We build empathy through it.

1367
01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:07.990
Some of our volunteers have said that it's like free therapy and we talk about

1368
01:30:07.991 --> 01:30:10.060
forgiveness,
like align,
like step to the line.

1369
01:30:10.061 --> 01:30:12.850
If you haven't forgiven yourself stuck to the line,

1370
01:30:12.851 --> 01:30:14.050
if you haven't forgiven someone else,

1371
01:30:14.051 --> 01:30:16.540
I issue a challenge like in a step to the line,

1372
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:21.550
if not forgiving yourself for others is still hurting you to this day.

1373
01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:24.550
And then everyone who a blind,
I'm like,
you know what time it is now.
You know,

1374
01:30:24.551 --> 01:30:26.830
choose,
I forgive me.
Uh,

1375
01:30:26.930 --> 01:30:31.630
so step to the line is a really powerful exercise and it's not just for our

1376
01:30:31.631 --> 01:30:34.930
volunteers,
for our entrepreneurs in training.

1377
01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:41.580
We create a safe and incredibly emotionally and physically safe place in prison,

1378
01:30:44.110 --> 01:30:49.110
even in a maximum security prison where people can let their tough guy or girl

1379
01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:54.780
guards down and just be human and be seen and loved and accepted for who they

1380
01:30:58.451 --> 01:31:01.280
are.
And I think that's,
uh,

1381
01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:06.420
that's something that all of us want in life is to be seen and known and to not

1382
01:31:06.641 --> 01:31:08.050
have to put up a facade.

1383
01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:13.590
It's so relaxing when we can actually realize that we can just be us and I am

1384
01:31:14.141 --> 01:31:17.350
good enough.
So step to the line is a really special,

1385
01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:19.750
unique ingredient of what we do.

1386
01:31:19.870 --> 01:31:22.750
That is empathy inducing and grace inducing.

1387
01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:24.760
And then we do a lot of other things.

1388
01:31:24.761 --> 01:31:29.180
So I say that at defilements we do the worm where we uh,

1389
01:31:29.230 --> 01:31:33.460
go up and down.
We get high legally high in prison.
We actually,

1390
01:31:33.490 --> 01:31:37.870
we use a lot of fun.
Um,
we do something called the innovative dance,

1391
01:31:37.871 --> 01:31:41.920
which is you have to get from one side of the sweaty gym to the other using an

1392
01:31:41.950 --> 01:31:43.500
innovative move.
And um,

1393
01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:48.640
a lot of our volunteers are like 40 and 50 year old white dudes who have no

1394
01:31:48.641 --> 01:31:49.474
dance moves.

1395
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:52.103
<v 1>Amazing.</v>

1396
01:31:52.650 --> 01:31:55.070
<v 3>It is,
it is really wonderful.
Um,</v>

1397
01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:58.350
we tell the guys at a men's prison to work at your own risk.

1398
01:31:58.351 --> 01:32:01.370
Ladies below the waist,
I'm immobile.

1399
01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:05.320
It's not totally equal opportunity and the guy's prison,
but now we use,

1400
01:32:05.730 --> 01:32:09.670
so they don't have to be good dancers.
We say keep them g ratedG ,

1401
01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:11.140
which is g is for Goofy,

1402
01:32:11.141 --> 01:32:15.340
but we use a lot of fun emotion and intensity.

1403
01:32:15.370 --> 01:32:18.700
And then we use our love of the entrepreneurial journey to bring out the best in

1404
01:32:18.701 --> 01:32:21.070
people.
So everything that we do at defy,
not everything,

1405
01:32:21.071 --> 01:32:26.020
but almost everything is super competitive and our [inaudible] are delivering

1406
01:32:26.021 --> 01:32:27.640
the shark tank pitches and the,

1407
01:32:27.730 --> 01:32:32.730
and the volunteers are giving feedback and it brings out the best in people.

1408
01:32:33.850 --> 01:32:35.970
And then we turn the tables.

1409
01:32:35.971 --> 01:32:38.380
So I'm big on leveling the playing field all the time.

1410
01:32:38.381 --> 01:32:43.180
So sometimes these fancy CEOs and vcs come to prison and they're,
you know,

1411
01:32:43.181 --> 01:32:46.030
they're going to be the shark tank judges.
That's great.

1412
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:51.250
Well then at one point in the,
in the day,
uh,
the EIT is all get voting tickets.

1413
01:32:51.251 --> 01:32:52.540
And I'm like,
all right,
the,

1414
01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:56.970
the judges have been voting in your business ideas all day long.
Um,
now it's,

1415
01:32:56.971 --> 01:32:59.740
the EIT is turns.
So volunteers get your toes at the line.

1416
01:32:59.741 --> 01:33:04.010
So they all line up at this stretchy line of duct tape through the gym.
And,

1417
01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:04.900
and I tell him,

1418
01:33:04.930 --> 01:33:08.890
put your hands up with your best beggars body language with puppy dog eyes

1419
01:33:09.370 --> 01:33:10.990
language that says,
choose me.

1420
01:33:10.991 --> 01:33:14.380
And the EIT is go and they have 10 tickets.

1421
01:33:14.381 --> 01:33:18.340
And there are sometimes 70 volunteers in the gym and they walk up to the

1422
01:33:18.341 --> 01:33:22.240
volunteer and they look them in the eyeballs and they say,
Tim,

1423
01:33:22.690 --> 01:33:26.170
I choose you.
And that's all they're allowed to say is I choose the,

1424
01:33:26.171 --> 01:33:28.900
Oh and then the volunteers compete for who gets the US tickets.

1425
01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:30.690
And so we see who the top volunteers and,

1426
01:33:30.850 --> 01:33:34.210
and if the volunteers don't get as many tickets cause we tell the uits pick the

1427
01:33:34.211 --> 01:33:36.850
ones who are the best judges,
who give the best feedback.

1428
01:33:36.851 --> 01:33:39.850
So when the volunteers don't get as many tickets,
I'm like,
look,

1429
01:33:39.851 --> 01:33:43.240
you can say the system is rigged and you can suck your thumb,

1430
01:33:43.241 --> 01:33:48.040
the whole bus ride home and say you hate defy.
Or just like we say at defy,

1431
01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:48.641
you know,

1432
01:33:48.641 --> 01:33:51.910
you can use the feedback to up your game and come back and be a better judge

1433
01:33:51.970 --> 01:33:54.790
than next time around.
And so

1434
01:33:56.550 --> 01:34:00.820
a big thing that we do at defy,
we are a nonprofit organization.

1435
01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:04.480
We work with people who have been through a lot of things to have done a lot of

1436
01:34:04.930 --> 01:34:09.850
things.
Um,
but we say one of our driving values is partner,

1437
01:34:10.030 --> 01:34:14.800
not pity.
And if you come to prison with us,
Tim or anybody else,

1438
01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:19.060
you will see,
I instruct people when I'm leading an event,

1439
01:34:19.670 --> 01:34:23.890
you are not to feel sorry for anyone here.
This is not some like hug a thug,

1440
01:34:23.891 --> 01:34:25.480
come feel sorry for these guys.

1441
01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:30.900
Look at them in the eye with respect and empathy.

1442
01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:36.480
And that is so empowering and awesome and fun and magical and people leave

1443
01:34:39.101 --> 01:34:43.360
prison.
And I think it leaves for our volunteers at leaves a real mark on them.

1444
01:34:43.361 --> 01:34:46.000
It gives them a lot to think about for their own lives.

1445
01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:50.350
And many of our volunteers leave going,
wow,
I can be doing so much more.

1446
01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:54.790
They feel inspired by the drive of our amazing EIT.

1447
01:34:54.791 --> 01:34:56.710
So our events are super high energy.

1448
01:34:56.711 --> 01:34:58.910
I like to think we're a little Tony Robbins asks.

1449
01:35:00.030 --> 01:35:01.510
<v 1>Well that's part of the reason I brought him up.
Uh,</v>

1450
01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:05.370
Debbie and then was there some sheared DNA?
Uh,
certainly.

1451
01:35:06.450 --> 01:35:11.190
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's uh,
he's an impressive,
very,

1452
01:35:11.191 --> 01:35:12.910
very effective guy.
Uh,
yeah.

1453
01:35:15.630 --> 01:35:20.010
I did want to revisit one thing you mentioned because he caught my eye when I

1454
01:35:20.011 --> 01:35:25.011
was reading the about us page on defy ventures.org and it is the following,

1455
01:35:27.721 --> 01:35:30.210
defy offers a suite of services that includes,

1456
01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:33.300
this is in the middle of a paragraph that includes intensive personal and

1457
01:35:33.301 --> 01:35:36.540
leadership development,
competition based entrepreneurship training,

1458
01:35:36.541 --> 01:35:40.110
executive mentoring,
financial investment in business incubation.

1459
01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:43.770
Can you talk a little bit more?
We don't have to spend a lot of time on it,

1460
01:35:43.771 --> 01:35:47.580
but the competition based is very interesting to me.
Uh,

1461
01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:52.640
why competition based and and how do you do it right versus not do it right.

1462
01:35:54.610 --> 01:35:55.150
<v 3>Also,</v>

1463
01:35:55.150 --> 01:36:00.150
I'm a competitor and I believe that competition done the right way can bring out

1464
01:36:01.031 --> 01:36:02.200
the best in all of us.

1465
01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:07.750
And so when we have a hundred uits in prison,

1466
01:36:07.751 --> 01:36:10.910
and by the way we run these competitions also outside of prison.

1467
01:36:10.911 --> 01:36:14.290
So I'm for real business ideas like inside prison,

1468
01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:17.130
it's an ideation competition and an outside prison.

1469
01:36:17.131 --> 01:36:20.560
And they were actually incorporated businesses that are competing for real

1470
01:36:20.561 --> 01:36:25.561
capital and inside prison when we have a hundred guys who are competing in the

1471
01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:28.210
night before,
we ask them who's going to win?

1472
01:36:28.270 --> 01:36:30.910
And all these guys raised their hands.
So first of all,

1473
01:36:31.390 --> 01:36:35.800
the people that we work with,
um,
are very competitive.

1474
01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:39.220
They're tough guys and they like to win.

1475
01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:44.270
And many of the people that we work with,
if I tell them bed,

1476
01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:45.130
you can't do it.

1477
01:36:45.131 --> 01:36:49.090
They'll puff their chest out and they will do it and they'll define a lot of

1478
01:36:49.091 --> 01:36:53.680
odds.
And so we,
we make sure that we have the affirmation.
So we tell,

1479
01:36:53.730 --> 01:36:54.820
I know you can do it.

1480
01:36:54.821 --> 01:36:59.821
And sometimes there are people who are lacking in confidence and we certainly,

1481
01:37:00.730 --> 01:37:03.700
we go a long way to reassure them and to tell them that they can do it.

1482
01:37:03.701 --> 01:37:05.350
And we also tell them,
you know,
when you're,

1483
01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:08.260
when you're competing tomorrow in our pitch competition,

1484
01:37:08.770 --> 01:37:10.270
this is not just about you.

1485
01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:14.080
This is about what we're doing in our country.

1486
01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:18.160
Other people wish that they could be you right now participating in defy.

1487
01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:22.180
So we get stocks of jail mail at defy from all over the country where people

1488
01:37:22.210 --> 01:37:24.700
were saying,
please,
all I want is a second chance.

1489
01:37:25.390 --> 01:37:29.850
So they all want to win the competition and we have like quarter finals and then

1490
01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:34.060
semifinals and then we have finals and then the top five finalists get like

1491
01:37:34.061 --> 01:37:37.780
these IOU checks from the stage that they get to cash out when they're admitted

1492
01:37:37.781 --> 01:37:40.810
into our post release incubator.
When they want to start their actual business,

1493
01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:43.090
if they want to,
I don't care if they want to start their business,

1494
01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:46.450
we get them into jobs when they get out of present.

1495
01:37:46.451 --> 01:37:48.640
And that's why we have a 95% employment rate.

1496
01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:54.100
But the night before when we're at a pitch practice and the guys are so nervous

1497
01:37:54.101 --> 01:37:56.940
about the competition and some of them,

1498
01:37:56.970 --> 01:37:59.790
the first time we ever had a competition in prison for defy,

1499
01:37:59.791 --> 01:38:02.520
the warden called the night before and he's like,
can you come in here?

1500
01:38:02.521 --> 01:38:07.140
Cause these guys are like having anxiety tasks and they're crying.

1501
01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:09.570
And at this particular prison,

1502
01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:15.000
more than half of the guys had committed the crime of murder.
So these are,

1503
01:38:15.001 --> 01:38:19.650
you know,
tough guys.
Um,
and I walk in there,
I was like,
what?

1504
01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:23.010
You guys are crying and thinking about dropping out.

1505
01:38:23.011 --> 01:38:24.990
Like don't tell me you're a bunch of chickens now.

1506
01:38:24.990 --> 01:38:28.950
Like when you robbed that bank or when you did this or that,
like,
you know,

1507
01:38:28.951 --> 01:38:29.880
you didn't,
you didn't set,

1508
01:38:29.970 --> 01:38:34.110
let your fear stop you from doing what you wanted to do.

1509
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:38.880
And I'm playing with them and they laugh.
But then I tell them,

1510
01:38:40.110 --> 01:38:44.400
I believe in you,
I know you can do this.

1511
01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:48.540
And I know that for the past year,
defy takes about a year to complete inside.

1512
01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:50.093
Um,

1513
01:38:50.130 --> 01:38:54.660
and they take a hundred courses and some of these courses are taught by Harvard

1514
01:38:54.661 --> 01:38:56.190
and Stanford Mba professors.

1515
01:38:56.191 --> 01:38:59.070
And then they're taking a lot of like courses taught by therapists that are

1516
01:38:59.071 --> 01:39:03.750
doing deep like inner work.
And it's this whole journey.
And when they finish it,

1517
01:39:04.230 --> 01:39:09.210
they earn,
our curriculum has been vetted by Baylor University's MBA programs.

1518
01:39:09.211 --> 01:39:14.211
So the next day they're about to receive a Baylor University Mba program

1519
01:39:14.821 --> 01:39:18.390
certificate and our men and women and youth that we serve average in eighth

1520
01:39:18.391 --> 01:39:21.240
grade education.
So I tell them the day before,
I'm like,

1521
01:39:22.050 --> 01:39:26.760
you are about for many of you,
this is the biggest accomplishment in their lives.

1522
01:39:26.761 --> 01:39:27.600
And in fact I say,

1523
01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:30.660
raise your hand if this represents the biggest accomplishment of your life.

1524
01:39:30.930 --> 01:39:33.120
90% of them raising their hand.

1525
01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:36.030
Raise your hand if this is going to be your first time in a cap and gown,

1526
01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:38.460
half of them first time in a cap and gown,

1527
01:39:39.090 --> 01:39:42.150
raise your hand if your family is coming tomorrow to witness your proudest

1528
01:39:42.151 --> 01:39:47.070
moment.
Half of them,
not all of our families can make it.
Um,

1529
01:39:47.250 --> 01:39:49.920
and then I tell them,
so guess what?

1530
01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:52.980
I know for the past year you have been working on your pitch,

1531
01:39:52.981 --> 01:39:57.270
but only about 20 or 30% of device program is around entrepreneurship and their

1532
01:39:57.271 --> 01:40:01.710
pitch,
like the other 70% is around employment readiness and shame reduction and

1533
01:40:01.711 --> 01:40:04.620
forgiveness and technology skills and parenting courses and all that.

1534
01:40:05.010 --> 01:40:05.550
So I tell them,

1535
01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:08.220
although you've been working for the past year in your pitch and this pitch,

1536
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:11.490
you feel like your life is on the line.
Guess what?

1537
01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:16.700
Your life is not on the line and tomorrow if you fail in your pitch,

1538
01:40:18.510 --> 01:40:19.890
you are not a failure.

1539
01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:24.060
And more than that I do not care about your pitch.

1540
01:40:24.270 --> 01:40:25.920
And they all kind of like look at me.

1541
01:40:25.921 --> 01:40:30.921
They feel offended when I say that I feel he don't care about your pitch,

1542
01:40:31.530 --> 01:40:36.140
I care about you and I care about your future and I have given so many pitches

1543
01:40:36.141 --> 01:40:40.290
in my life and sometimes I give a great one and sometimes I'm like,
man,

1544
01:40:40.291 --> 01:40:45.120
I bombed that.
And your pitch doesn't matter.

1545
01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:46.440
Your future,

1546
01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:50.460
you and your future matters and you are arriving to this moment of graduation

1547
01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:56.020
and you crossing the stage and earning this MBA certificate and making your

1548
01:40:56.021 --> 01:40:59.650
family's proud and making yourself proud you have defied the odds.

1549
01:40:59.650 --> 01:41:02.650
How many of you have thought about quitting at some point into defy?

1550
01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:05.410
And every hand goes up and I'm like,
see,
you know,

1551
01:41:05.411 --> 01:41:09.670
and sometimes you guys say that quitting is not an option.
Well,
guess what?

1552
01:41:09.671 --> 01:41:13.750
Quitting is always an option.
You just chose not to take that option.

1553
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:18.760
I am proud of you.
I'm proud of what we are accomplishing together.

1554
01:41:19.090 --> 01:41:24.090
Our country needs to see more success stories like yours of people who have made

1555
01:41:25.601 --> 01:41:29.770
grave mistakes and who are getting back on their feet and who are trying again,

1556
01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:33.490
because you could have given up on yourselves.

1557
01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:35.920
You could have given up on your future.

1558
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:41.020
You could give up on being a father going forward.
So I,
I'll tell you what,

1559
01:41:41.050 --> 01:41:44.260
I care about your pitch because I care about you.

1560
01:41:44.350 --> 01:41:45.400
I really don't care about your pitch,

1561
01:41:45.401 --> 01:41:49.300
but because you want to win and you're competitive.
Tough guys.
All right,
fine.

1562
01:41:49.301 --> 01:41:51.820
I care about your to pitch.
So when you stand up tomorrow,

1563
01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:56.110
there's going to be a panel of five to 10 of these sharks.
First of all,

1564
01:41:56.111 --> 01:41:59.050
these sharks want you to when they're coming here because they believe in second

1565
01:41:59.051 --> 01:42:02.470
chances and underdogs when you stand up in front of the panel.
And then we say,

1566
01:42:03.310 --> 01:42:07.660
what's the worst thing that could happen?
And they're pretty funny.
They're like,

1567
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:10.100
oh,
I pass out.
Or,
um,

1568
01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:13.960
I forget my words or I freeze up or I look stupid and I'm like,

1569
01:42:13.961 --> 01:42:17.980
what's worse than that?
What's worse than that?
And one of them once said,
um,

1570
01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:21.130
I dedicate myself and I'm like,
yeah,
that would suck.
Okay,
that would suck.

1571
01:42:21.370 --> 01:42:24.220
But the worst thing that will probably happen is that maybe you freeze up and

1572
01:42:24.230 --> 01:42:25.540
you forget some of your words.

1573
01:42:26.290 --> 01:42:30.510
I say if you stand up in front of the panel and you just go,
Ooh,

1574
01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:34.270
and you can't think of a single word,
you still,
when you graduate,

1575
01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:37.600
you cross the stage,
you make yourself proud,

1576
01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:40.000
you make our country proud.

1577
01:42:41.110 --> 01:42:46.110
And then they graduate and they deliver their pitches in an amazing way.

1578
01:42:47.950 --> 01:42:51.160
Every time they surprise themselves,
I what they're able to do.

1579
01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:01.970
<v 1>Is there a place where people can learn more about the curriculum that you use?</v>

1580
01:43:02.590 --> 01:43:05.890
<v 3>Yeah,
our website defy ventures.
Dot.</v>

1581
01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:10.930
O R G or a nonprofit.
Um,
because a lot of information about defy.

1582
01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:16.120
So we have 100 courses inside a hundred courses outside.
Um,

1583
01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:20.090
and with our donors,
we even share,
uh,

1584
01:43:20.230 --> 01:43:24.250
some of our online courses that are amazing.
So in,
in prison,

1585
01:43:24.251 --> 01:43:27.790
people don't usually have online access.
And so our courses,

1586
01:43:27.791 --> 01:43:31.720
our DVD based outside,
they're on an online platform.

1587
01:43:31.721 --> 01:43:34.780
And so for our donors we are even able to share them because I tell our

1588
01:43:34.781 --> 01:43:35.261
volunteers,

1589
01:43:35.261 --> 01:43:38.530
I don't want you to start guys to forgive themselves and to be the CEOs of their

1590
01:43:38.531 --> 01:43:40.720
new lives.
I want you to live your fullest life too.

1591
01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:43.630
So we're happy sharing is caring.

1592
01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:46.361
<v 1>What about,</v>

1593
01:43:46.361 --> 01:43:51.361
I'm looking@theresourcessectiononthedefyventures.org right now.

1594
01:43:52.090 --> 01:43:56.690
<v 4>Uh,
what about the actual classes themselves,</v>

1595
01:43:56.691 --> 01:43:59.970
those that have been vetted by Baylor and so on.

1596
01:43:59.971 --> 01:44:03.830
If the actual content of what you are teaching,

1597
01:44:03.831 --> 01:44:05.120
is that available anywhere?

1598
01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:09.160
<v 3>Um,
so we don't just make it available to anybody.
So for example,</v>

1599
01:44:09.161 --> 01:44:12.340
some of our courses that are taught by Henry Cloud,

1600
01:44:12.341 --> 01:44:16.900
a top therapist or the Harvard and Stanford Mba courses,
uh,

1601
01:44:16.901 --> 01:44:21.550
Harvard and Stanford don't want us just like making that available to anybody.

1602
01:44:21.551 --> 01:44:25.090
So it's available to people who are in our program.

1603
01:44:25.091 --> 01:44:30.040
So I guess you have to go commit a felony first.
But,
um,
um,
but many,

1604
01:44:30.070 --> 01:44:34.120
most of our courses actually don't have those kinds of restrictions on them.

1605
01:44:34.121 --> 01:44:38.870
And so we're happy to make those available to people.
But I would say,
uh,

1606
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:43.490
my little hook is I want you doing something for a second chances in our
country.

1607
01:44:43.491 --> 01:44:46.870
So don't just come and take a course commercial attributor too.

1608
01:44:47.110 --> 01:44:48.940
If you become a contributor to defy,

1609
01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:54.060
we would be glad to make are we make our courses available on our online

1610
01:44:55.181 --> 01:44:57.190
platform where you have to have this secret code,

1611
01:44:57.191 --> 01:45:02.191
but we make our online courses available because I want our volunteers having

1612
01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:05.110
access to this amazing stuff to,
for example,

1613
01:45:05.560 --> 01:45:10.560
we have eight courses in etiquette training taught by an Emily post instructor

1614
01:45:11.530 --> 01:45:12.363
and um,

1615
01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:17.400
many of our volunteers have told me anyway that my husband can get access to

1616
01:45:19.031 --> 01:45:23.170
those forces.
And I say,
sure,
if y'all make them,
watch them.

1617
01:45:23.290 --> 01:45:26.860
So yes,
we'd be,
we'd be glad to share the resources.

1618
01:45:27.810 --> 01:45:29.100
<v 4>Cool.
Yeah,
no,
there's,</v>

1619
01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:33.090
just to come back to something you mentioned in passing as we were chatting,

1620
01:45:33.091 --> 01:45:35.210
you know,
if I were to ever join you at a prison,

1621
01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:40.220
I'm happy to do that so we can figure out the specifics of that visit at some

1622
01:45:40.591 --> 01:45:43.030
point,
but I think it'd be very helpful also.

1623
01:45:43.170 --> 01:45:45.820
<v 3>Can that meant Tim,
did I just hear that and that's not going to get cut out.</v>

1624
01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:49.780
Yeah,
that's a commitment.
Sure.
Tim,
Tim Ferris comes to prison.

1625
01:45:50.190 --> 01:45:53.200
You're a hundred classes friends.
He's sign up from this podcast.

1626
01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:57.300
<v 4>Yes.
We'll figure out the,
the,
the specifics of that.</v>

1627
01:45:57.330 --> 01:46:02.040
I do think the what people didn't know what to what Kat just did there.

1628
01:46:02.041 --> 01:46:06.360
That's a very,
very seasoned pitch artist at work.
Closing the deal

1629
01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:09.870
is the,

1630
01:46:10.110 --> 01:46:14.550
I do think even just having the names of the courses that you're incorporating

1631
01:46:14.551 --> 01:46:19.551
from say Stanford GSB and elsewhere would be a very useful way to drive traffic

1632
01:46:19.861 --> 01:46:21.060
to your site.
Also,

1633
01:46:21.170 --> 01:46:26.000
<v 3>I love making sure that we update our website before this podcast is launched.</v>

1634
01:46:26.450 --> 01:46:27.050
Perfect.

1635
01:46:27.050 --> 01:46:32.050
So people has taught a course or multiple courses for us on ideation strategies.

1636
01:46:35.361 --> 01:46:40.361
Jerry Colonna has taught a course on the fear of the entrepreneur and how to get

1637
01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:46.190
to the other side of that.
We Union square venture is venture capitalist,

1638
01:46:46.191 --> 01:46:51.000
have we've recorded live pitches of are released men and women pitching in their

1639
01:46:51.001 --> 01:46:54.270
offices.
And then the feedback that they're giving to entrepreneurs.

1640
01:46:54.271 --> 01:46:57.600
Tim Draper has taught a course for us.
Kleiner Perkins,

1641
01:46:57.601 --> 01:47:00.150
one of the partners from there has recorded a course.

1642
01:47:00.151 --> 01:47:05.151
So we have amazing courses in entrepreneurship that range from how to come up

1643
01:47:06.691 --> 01:47:09.720
with a smart business idea to how to scale it.
Uh,

1644
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:14.750
we have courses in how to market your business and hiring and hiring and firing

1645
01:47:17.731 --> 01:47:19.050
and creating culture.

1646
01:47:19.650 --> 01:47:24.650
But the other 70% of our courses that are on parenting and for example,

1647
01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:30.780
how to answer tough questions when you're a kid asks you,
Daddy,

1648
01:47:30.781 --> 01:47:35.740
have you ever used drugs?
What to say about that?
Um,
so that the,

1649
01:47:35.741 --> 01:47:40.741
the parenting courses and the forming a new identity courses are really

1650
01:47:42.421 --> 01:47:43.111
valuable.

1651
01:47:43.111 --> 01:47:48.060
And then I also like to think that our employment series is pretty sweet.

1652
01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:52.920
Like I teach a course called how to write a resume when you've done 19 years in

1653
01:47:52.921 --> 01:47:54.840
prison.
Um,

1654
01:47:55.230 --> 01:47:58.710
and the creative things that you can come up with to put on his man,

1655
01:47:58.711 --> 01:47:59.610
not lie about it.

1656
01:48:00.070 --> 01:48:03.890
<v 4>Yeah.
The,
uh,
what is it?</v>

1657
01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.390
Additional skills or special skills section could be very improvised,

1658
01:48:08.450 --> 01:48:13.130
I would imagine.
Uh,
what,
uh,
well let me,

1659
01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:17.240
let me jump into just with the time that we have remaining,

1660
01:48:18.370 --> 01:48:21.640
uh,
a number of the questions that I like to,

1661
01:48:21.690 --> 01:48:26.690
to ask towards the tail end of a conversation like this and the fur.

1662
01:48:27.940 --> 01:48:31.430
Okay,
good.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
Well I'm going to get there.
I'm going to get there.
Yeah.

1663
01:48:31.431 --> 01:48:34.940
I'm going to get there.
This is,
so the first question I was going to ask you,

1664
01:48:35.570 --> 01:48:40.570
which is going to lead naturally there is what book or books have you gifted the

1665
01:48:40.821 --> 01:48:43.910
most to other people?
Or do you

1666
01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:48.120
<v 3>gift to other people?
And up until recently,</v>

1667
01:48:48.121 --> 01:48:52.200
the book that I have the most regularly gifted as Sheryl Sandberg's book option

1668
01:48:52.201 --> 01:48:56.130
B because it's closely related to the work that I do.

1669
01:48:56.190 --> 01:48:58.710
And Cheryl is the most inspiring

1670
01:49:00.570 --> 01:49:03.000
woman that I know.
And I really respect her.

1671
01:49:03.001 --> 01:49:06.180
She's on my executive council and H and.
M,

1672
01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:11.240
so I love her book option B on healing and building a new future.

1673
01:49:11.970 --> 01:49:15.270
And a Cheryl.
I feel very spoiled about this share.

1674
01:49:15.271 --> 01:49:20.271
I'll read the foreword to my own book called a second chance.

1675
01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:26.190
And so now the book that I'm gifting even more than option B is my own buck a

1676
01:49:26.191 --> 01:49:28.620
second chance and

1677
01:49:31.060 --> 01:49:31.893
<v 4>Amazon.</v>

1678
01:49:32.980 --> 01:49:33.460
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1679
01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:38.460
And Seth Godin has been working as my pro bono publisher.

1680
01:49:38.831 --> 01:49:43.831
Every dollar from the book goes directly to creating life changing opportunities

1681
01:49:44.651 --> 01:49:46.960
for people through scholarships for defy.

1682
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:50.560
And so it's not going into a publisher's pocket.

1683
01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:55.620
And speaking of gifting like Seth is buying and has donated 20,000 copies of the

1684
01:49:58.301 --> 01:49:59.290
book back to defy,

1685
01:49:59.291 --> 01:50:04.291
he's so generous to us and I'm really inspired by his generosity and Sheryl

1686
01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:09.670
Sandberg's generosity and in the way that they have supported our second chance

1687
01:50:09.671 --> 01:50:12.910
work.
I hope that this book,
yes,

1688
01:50:12.911 --> 01:50:17.911
it will open the eyes of people about topics that we've been talking about for

1689
01:50:18.071 --> 01:50:20.050
the incarcerated,
but my,

1690
01:50:20.890 --> 01:50:25.890
my other even greater purpose for our readers of this book.

1691
01:50:26.291 --> 01:50:31.291
A second chance is that you will decide to give yourself a second chance.

1692
01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:34.570
I talk a lot about forgiveness,
like we've talked about,
Tim,

1693
01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:40.560
that you will choose to forgive or give a second chance to other people in your

1694
01:50:41.051 --> 01:50:43.780
life or if you know other people who have been made big mistakes,

1695
01:50:43.781 --> 01:50:47.620
who are down on themselves that you don't use this book as a resource for them

1696
01:50:47.621 --> 01:50:50.800
to achieve freedom as well.

1697
01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:55.180
<v 1>Yeah,
Seth,</v>

1698
01:50:55.181 --> 01:51:00.170
and that was the context with which Seth first reached out to me was related to

1699
01:51:01.070 --> 01:51:05.060
related to the book,
so I encourage everybody to check it out for sure.

1700
01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:06.290
A second.

1701
01:51:06.330 --> 01:51:06.541
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1702
01:51:06.541 --> 01:51:11.541
The idea is if people who have royally screwed up their lives and the lives of

1703
01:51:12.841 --> 01:51:13.740
other people,

1704
01:51:14.190 --> 01:51:19.190
if they can forgive themselves and gain forgiveness from other people,

1705
01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:23.010
get back on their feet,
start legal businesses,

1706
01:51:23.550 --> 01:51:28.500
and build an incredibly successful new future,
you can do it too.

1707
01:51:28.650 --> 01:51:30.720
And many of us suffer from this.

1708
01:51:30.721 --> 01:51:34.680
Shame of mine is worse than yours.
Like,
Oh,

1709
01:51:34.681 --> 01:51:39.360
if you really knew what I did,
it's so much worse,
or mine is not recoverable,

1710
01:51:39.361 --> 01:51:44.361
and that's a message that place inside our heads and I don't think it's true.

1711
01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:48.780
Yours isn't worse.
You're human and you can bounce back to,

1712
01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:52.750
<v 1>it's also not helpful.
I mean,
I think that if that makes sense.</v>

1713
01:51:52.751 --> 01:51:55.180
Even if it is worse,
it's,
it's the,

1714
01:51:56.590 --> 01:51:58.420
the replaying of that story.

1715
01:51:58.421 --> 01:52:03.421
Using that as your defining narrative is not going to help create the future

1716
01:52:03.911 --> 01:52:05.770
that you want to have.
Right.

1717
01:52:06.070 --> 01:52:06.700
<v 3>You have a choice.</v>

1718
01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:11.700
You can keep yourself locked up in your head over a past decision forever or we

1719
01:52:12.731 --> 01:52:15.400
can help you to get out of your own prison.
Your choice.

1720
01:52:15.900 --> 01:52:16.733
<v 1>Yup.</v>

1721
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:22.830
If you could have a message on a billboard,

1722
01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:27.000
metaphorically speaking,
getting a message out to millions or billions of people.

1723
01:52:27.001 --> 01:52:31.350
So it could be one line,
can't be an advertisement,
but just a,

1724
01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:35.250
a word,
an expression,
a quote from someone else,
anything.

1725
01:52:35.251 --> 01:52:36.420
What would you put on that billboard

1726
01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:40.430
<v 3>were warning me an advertisement.
So I can't say,
give me all your money.
Show me.</v>

1727
01:52:41.850 --> 01:52:44.570
I say,
I would say forgive yourself,

1728
01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:48.080
and I would,

1729
01:52:49.370 --> 01:52:53.990
maybe I would put it in Vegas,
but I think a better place in Vegas would be,

1730
01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:59.560
I have a big heart for people who live in a culture of judgment and oppression

1731
01:53:07.310 --> 01:53:12.310
and sometimes well meaning religions for example,

1732
01:53:13.490 --> 01:53:18.490
can create this environment where we can say that yes,

1733
01:53:19.011 --> 01:53:21.800
we've sinned in the past or we've made a mistake in the past,

1734
01:53:21.801 --> 01:53:25.010
but now when we show up at church on Sunday,

1735
01:53:25.011 --> 01:53:28.940
we're all wearing the perfect outfit.
How's your wife blessed?
How's your job?

1736
01:53:28.941 --> 01:53:32.720
Great,
how are you happy?
And this,

1737
01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:34.880
there's a culture of oppression.

1738
01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:39.260
And then I believe that sin thrives and secrecy.

1739
01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:42.920
And so if there's like a s an audience,

1740
01:53:42.921 --> 01:53:46.280
especially I could say forgive yourself.
You're just human too.

1741
01:53:46.820 --> 01:53:51.820
It's especially in environments where people are forced to act more perfect than

1742
01:53:53.451 --> 01:53:55.940
others.
And that might be,
for example,

1743
01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:59.300
in the deep south where there's religion,

1744
01:53:59.301 --> 01:54:02.180
it might be a Stanford business school where everyone has to be the a plus

1745
01:54:02.181 --> 01:54:04.370
student too and it has to be the very best.

1746
01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:11.600
<v 1>What do you do when you were feeling overwhelmed or temporarily unfocused or</v>

1747
01:54:13.021 --> 01:54:17.280
that you've lost your focus when you've lost your morning,
so to speak,

1748
01:54:17.281 --> 01:54:18.930
and any of the,
any of the above.

1749
01:54:18.931 --> 01:54:23.040
What do you do just in a very kind of practical tactical sense?

1750
01:54:23.540 --> 01:54:26.120
<v 3>Yeah.
Well it depends on how overwhelmed I'm feeling,</v>

1751
01:54:26.121 --> 01:54:28.790
so if I'm feeling like sort of overwhelmed,

1752
01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:33.820
then I'll make a list of my priorities and I will bounce them off of a staff

1753
01:54:36.681 --> 01:54:40.160
member that I really trust to help me to get my priority straight because when I

1754
01:54:40.161 --> 01:54:42.440
have like clear marching orders and priorities,

1755
01:54:42.441 --> 01:54:44.150
it helps me to become less overwhelmed,

1756
01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:48.070
<v 1>bounce them off of them.
What are you asking them to do?
What's,</v>

1757
01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:48.913
what does that look like?

1758
01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:51.330
<v 3>I'll show them the list and be like,</v>

1759
01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:56.100
can you help me decide what is really important and what I can say no too.

1760
01:54:56.130 --> 01:55:00.120
Because sometimes the more overwhelmed I get,
the less good of a decision maker.

1761
01:55:00.121 --> 01:55:02.550
I also become and things can get cloudy.

1762
01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:07.620
So I recently read the book essential ism and I loved old framework for making

1763
01:55:07.621 --> 01:55:08.221
decisions.

1764
01:55:08.221 --> 01:55:12.300
And I shared that with some staff that helps me to control my calendar and

1765
01:55:12.301 --> 01:55:15.690
opportunities and when to say yes to or no.
And so if I get overwhelmed,

1766
01:55:15.691 --> 01:55:17.490
I'll be like,
all right,
let's take a step back.

1767
01:55:17.550 --> 01:55:22.550
I also have a one sheet with my priorities right in front of me and I look at it

1768
01:55:23.371 --> 01:55:27.540
every day and it says,
for example,
as my favorite place to be is in prison,

1769
01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:31.740
but because I love the journey of transformation and the amazing,

1770
01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:34.710
I feel like I've seen miracles every day.
Um,

1771
01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:39.540
but my sheet says if I really love our EIT is my strict number one

1772
01:55:39.541 --> 01:55:42.720
responsibility will be fundraising so that I can make sure that I'm creating

1773
01:55:42.721 --> 01:55:45.150
more for people who are incarcerated,

1774
01:55:45.151 --> 01:55:48.450
who have been praying for a shot at a second chance.

1775
01:55:48.930 --> 01:55:52.500
So I keep my priorities not just top of mind,

1776
01:55:52.501 --> 01:55:53.970
but physically in front of me.

1777
01:55:53.971 --> 01:55:57.750
I like need to be able to see it and then I'll ask other people for help.

1778
01:55:57.751 --> 01:55:58.584
I'll say timeout.

1779
01:55:58.830 --> 01:56:03.830
When I get super overwhelmed I'll actually take a timeout and cancel stuff and

1780
01:56:04.501 --> 01:56:07.230
just I need to,
I need to have some space.

1781
01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:11.950
I take like I take a monthly monk days,
what I call it,
no phone,

1782
01:56:11.951 --> 01:56:15.300
no email.
It's one of the best things I do.
I recommend it to everybody.

1783
01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:20.010
And is does that typically fall on a certain day of the week?

1784
01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:23.430
No.
It can be any day,
but it's during the week.

1785
01:56:23.431 --> 01:56:28.080
I don't do it during the weekend and it's a time for me to reflect on my

1786
01:56:28.081 --> 01:56:31.320
leadership and my priorities.
New Initiatives,

1787
01:56:31.321 --> 01:56:36.240
it's when I get creative and my whole life is so extroverted.

1788
01:56:36.241 --> 01:56:39.570
I travel all the time.
I'm speaking on a stage,

1789
01:56:39.571 --> 01:56:44.571
I'm in prison and my life is like a flurry and so quiet.

1790
01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:50.840
Reflective time is deeply important to me and it's usually when I scheme up.

1791
01:56:52.230 --> 01:56:55.620
Good,
exciting ideas too and get perspective.

1792
01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:59.190
When you wake up on Monk Day,
what does it look like mean?

1793
01:56:59.250 --> 01:57:02.220
What does reflecting actually look like?

1794
01:57:02.221 --> 01:57:06.270
What does the the monk schedule look like?
So for me,

1795
01:57:06.271 --> 01:57:10.950
Monk Day is just like working out the process leading up to is really painful.

1796
01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:14.190
It's because I know that for a full day,
this sounds silly,

1797
01:57:14.191 --> 01:57:16.980
but for a whole day I'm not going to be able to email or talk to people.

1798
01:57:17.250 --> 01:57:21.600
So the day before I'm like trying to squeeze in every last thing and it just

1799
01:57:21.601 --> 01:57:22.500
like with a workout,

1800
01:57:22.530 --> 01:57:26.280
I'm usually like procrastinating and trying to put it off until I start working

1801
01:57:26.281 --> 01:57:28.020
out.
And then I feel really good about it.

1802
01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:31.110
I tried to make excuses for what I need to cancel it,
but I,

1803
01:57:31.111 --> 01:57:32.930
it's very important to me say discipline.

1804
01:57:32.940 --> 01:57:36.360
So I come into my monk date already with a list of things that I'm going to do

1805
01:57:36.361 --> 01:57:37.050
on that Monday,

1806
01:57:37.050 --> 01:57:42.050
which might include go for a long walk or read this book or think about this

1807
01:57:43.381 --> 01:57:47.250
issue.
And so my email's off,
my phone's off,

1808
01:57:47.251 --> 01:57:52.230
my staff knows they can't reach me and I usually do something that is really

1809
01:57:52.231 --> 01:57:56.190
nice to me to start off the day.
Um,

1810
01:57:56.430 --> 01:57:58.890
so eat my favorite food.

1811
01:57:58.891 --> 01:58:01.440
Or what's one of your favorite foods?

1812
01:58:03.540 --> 01:58:06.870
I don't eat it in the morning,
but like an awesome medium.

1813
01:58:06.871 --> 01:58:11.040
Rare steak is my favorite food is steak,
oysters,
red wine.

1814
01:58:11.130 --> 01:58:14.850
I'm a happy camper,
so I don't eat that for breakfast.
Usually

1815
01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:20.520
eggs,
I love poached eggs as up,

1816
01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:24.180
but when I'm,
when I do something,
it's kind to myself.

1817
01:58:24.181 --> 01:58:27.600
Sometimes on a monk day I'll even go and get a massage for example,

1818
01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:30.210
because it shows me out and I'm super hyper.

1819
01:58:30.211 --> 01:58:34.230
Normally I wake up and I'm like a crazy honeybadger first thing in the morning.

1820
01:58:36.090 --> 01:58:40.470
Or like if I take a bubble bath that calms my spirit to,
you know,

1821
01:58:40.770 --> 01:58:45.770
and I play like sweet violin music and I actually have like baby lullabies on my

1822
01:58:47.171 --> 01:58:49.720
playlist.
I,
that's probably sounds really creepy,
but

1823
01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:53.260
I do think it's the quiet,

1824
01:58:53.950 --> 01:58:57.890
<v 4>I'm just imagining you eating a medium rare steak and drinking red wine while</v>

1825
01:58:57.891 --> 01:59:01.450
the lullabies are playing around with that stop judging

1826
01:59:04.930 --> 01:59:09.190
while doing a bicep curl,
like a concentration curl with one.
Oh yeah.

1827
01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:14.500
<v 3>So I have a walking treadmill desk and I absolutely love it because I feel like</v>

1828
01:59:14.501 --> 01:59:16.540
when I'm on it,
I'm being kind to myself.

1829
01:59:16.541 --> 01:59:21.400
Like I'm burning free calories and I like to be fit and work out.
So sometimes,

1830
01:59:21.450 --> 01:59:25.960
um,
first thing in the monk day I'll get on my walking treadmill desk with a book

1831
01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:29.400
that I love to read and I just start reading it and I stayed,

1832
01:59:29.450 --> 01:59:34.450
start taking notes and I have these awesome headphones and on some like blaring,

1833
01:59:35.740 --> 01:59:36.071
yeah,

1834
01:59:36.071 --> 01:59:41.071
my little nerdy violin or piano music and it calms me and it takes me out of the

1835
01:59:42.521 --> 01:59:45.910
world.
And then I start taking notes.
Like right before I turned 40,

1836
01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:51.720
I had a series of really amazing monk days and I spent the last six months of

1837
01:59:53.771 --> 01:59:58.000
monk days before I turned 40 doing an in depth like evaluation,

1838
01:59:58.020 --> 02:00:03.020
like a review of my first 40 years and then thinking about my impact on the

1839
02:00:03.761 --> 02:00:07.690
world and thinking about what I wanted my voice and impact to be for the next 40

1840
02:00:07.691 --> 02:00:07.990
years.

1841
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:12.220
And I didn't make like really turbo plans for like my 80th birthday or anything.

1842
02:00:12.670 --> 02:00:14.350
But I have it,

1843
02:00:14.410 --> 02:00:19.180
I have a pretty strong plan until I'm 53 and that's far enough for me.

1844
02:00:19.181 --> 02:00:24.181
But I felt like so good about taking that time out to evaluate and to say what

1845
02:00:25.781 --> 02:00:27.220
do I really want?

1846
02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:30.860
And then reading a lot of books that help to guide me in that direction.

1847
02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:35.920
So I like to have a good plan because I'm like a freight train and if I have the

1848
02:00:36.101 --> 02:00:40.030
right direction,
I,
I hit it in that direction.
I,

1849
02:00:40.031 --> 02:00:44.860
and then I bounced my plans after my mum's Day off of mentors and people who

1850
02:00:44.861 --> 02:00:49.090
look out for me to make sure that I'm making good plans.

1851
02:00:50.090 --> 02:00:55.090
<v 4>Do you have any suggested artist or album or track for either the violin or</v>

1852
02:00:55.941 --> 02:00:59.540
piano music for people who want to,
oh my gosh.

1853
02:01:00.830 --> 02:01:01.663
Um,

1854
02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:06.350
if not looking at it right and all you're looking for it.

1855
02:01:06.830 --> 02:01:10.100
I can keep going.
The uh,

1856
02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:14.720
<v 3>baby lullaby piano and like Spotify or something.</v>

1857
02:01:15.870 --> 02:01:16.770
<v 4>Okay,
perfect.</v>

1858
02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:21.130
<v 3>The vitamin string quartet as well.</v>

1859
02:01:21.430 --> 02:01:25.000
<v 4>Vitamin vitamin string quartet,</v>

1860
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:27.730
vitamin like vitamin C.
Yeah,

1861
02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:32.380
I went to their concerts trippy.
Alright.
And then,

1862
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:34.100
uh,
anytime.

1863
02:01:34.100 --> 02:01:36.630
<v 3>Sometimes there are songs are not all that much relaxing.</v>

1864
02:01:36.631 --> 02:01:41.060
Might they play a lot of pop in vitamin for him.

1865
02:01:41.061 --> 02:01:45.380
But sometimes I listen to that like while I'm cooking I like to sew a lot too.

1866
02:01:45.381 --> 02:01:48.140
So when I'm sewing and stuff I jam out to let them string

1867
02:01:48.230 --> 02:01:52.520
<v 4>quartet.
And uh,</v>

1868
02:01:53.330 --> 02:01:55.490
how often do you do monk days?

1869
02:01:55.680 --> 02:01:59.120
So on they'll say the monkeys leading up to your 40th birthday.
How often?

1870
02:01:59.150 --> 02:02:00.620
What was the interval on the moment

1871
02:02:00.700 --> 02:02:01.533
<v 3>sound?</v>

1872
02:02:01.670 --> 02:02:06.670
I have a personal monk day once a month and I've done this for like,

1873
02:02:08.190 --> 02:02:12.320
I don't know,
12 years or 15 years or something,
a long time in my life.

1874
02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:14.090
It's been a longstanding habit.

1875
02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:19.910
And then I separately have business Monday.
So personal Mondays,

1876
02:02:20.030 --> 02:02:22.610
no email,
no phone business.
Monk Day is,

1877
02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:27.170
I can have email and I can work on work stuff with some of my closest

1878
02:02:27.530 --> 02:02:30.080
colleagues,
but I have no scheduled appointments,

1879
02:02:30.081 --> 02:02:35.081
which is freedom for me because my calendar is usually scheduled two insanely.

1880
02:02:36.441 --> 02:02:37.480
But on a business Monday,

1881
02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:41.570
it's like time for me to just work and get work done in a staff answer emails

1882
02:02:41.571 --> 02:02:42.404
too.

1883
02:02:42.630 --> 02:02:43.420
<v 4>Got It.</v>

1884
02:02:43.420 --> 02:02:46.660
<v 3>Well then I have one to three of those per month.</v>

1885
02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:48.470
<v 4>One to three of those per month.</v>

1886
02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:51.890
<v 3>Yeah.
Sometimes I go away like in an ideal world,</v>

1887
02:02:52.010 --> 02:02:56.030
and I say ideally because I haven't executed perfectly on this,
but sometimes I,

1888
02:02:56.031 --> 02:03:01.031
every quarter I'll take a three day business monk day and sometimes even I've

1889
02:03:02.541 --> 02:03:06.260
even gone away for a one leak business monk day,

1890
02:03:06.261 --> 02:03:07.850
meaning no scheduled appointments.

1891
02:03:07.851 --> 02:03:11.210
And what I've found to be most effective for me,
this might sound silly,

1892
02:03:11.211 --> 02:03:12.740
but like when I get out of the country,

1893
02:03:12.741 --> 02:03:17.741
so I got to Mexico and I set my bar like a cool resort.

1894
02:03:18.201 --> 02:03:21.350
I go by myself and for some reason when I'm out of the country,

1895
02:03:21.351 --> 02:03:24.050
I'm not going to schedule phone calls or other appointments with people.

1896
02:03:24.051 --> 02:03:27.320
So then I just work and,
and like at defy we have,

1897
02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:31.940
we're working currently on 2,400 pages of new curriculum.

1898
02:03:31.941 --> 02:03:36.440
So it's a time for me to get away,
but it's a dedicated work time.

1899
02:03:37.610 --> 02:03:39.380
But away from the daily scramble.

1900
02:03:41.250 --> 02:03:41.590
<v 4>What,</v>

1901
02:03:41.590 --> 02:03:46.590
what books helped you when you were leading up to your 40th birthday in the

1902
02:03:48.070 --> 02:03:52.720
assessing or reassessing and planning and so on and closer related to that,

1903
02:03:53.470 --> 02:03:57.310
why did the planning take you to exactly 53 years old?

1904
02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:03.600
<v 3>Oh boy.
I'm so terrible at recalling names of the books that I love,</v>

1905
02:04:03.870 --> 02:04:06.230
like just randomly like this.
Um,

1906
02:04:06.630 --> 02:04:11.300
I will say that the book has centralism really had a big impact on me.
Yeah.

1907
02:04:11.610 --> 02:04:14.940
Um,
so I,
to answer that,

1908
02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:18.060
<v 4>we can work backwards.
53 years,
wife,
wife,
53.</v>

1909
02:04:18.490 --> 02:04:19.840
<v 3>Okay.
Well,</v>

1910
02:04:19.841 --> 02:04:24.841
so for defy on my vision is that I would like to Phi to be able to serve in

1911
02:04:26.740 --> 02:04:29.440
every major prison in America,

1912
02:04:29.530 --> 02:04:32.290
to find us having more than 500 incarcerated people.

1913
02:04:32.291 --> 02:04:36.610
They're in every major city within my lifetime.

1914
02:04:36.611 --> 02:04:40.650
So I modeling kind of back of the envelope,
well,

1915
02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:45.680
a little excel involved on a reasonable growth rate for what we can accomplish.

1916
02:04:46.770 --> 02:04:49.560
And according to my projections,
if we keep going right now,

1917
02:04:49.561 --> 02:04:52.920
defy as of 2017,

1918
02:04:52.921 --> 02:04:57.820
we're in five states,
five state prison systems.
And,
uh,

1919
02:04:57.821 --> 02:04:59.250
so by the time we were at 53,

1920
02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:04.200
I think we can serve in every major prison and have corresponding post release

1921
02:05:04.290 --> 02:05:08.130
employment and mentoring and an incubator.
So,
um,

1922
02:05:08.700 --> 02:05:12.840
so you know,
if I miss the mark and I'm 58,
that's fine.

1923
02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:17.700
But right now I actually believe that will make it by the time I'm 53,
my,

1924
02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:19.080
my vision,

1925
02:05:19.140 --> 02:05:23.460
I would love to put defy out of business by ending mass incarceration.

1926
02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:28.230
I know that there will always be incarceration in the world.

1927
02:05:29.190 --> 02:05:32.760
There doesn't always need to be mass incarceration

1928
02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:35.500
<v 4>the way that we do that in America.</v>

1929
02:05:36.460 --> 02:05:40.120
What would be the defining characteristics of

1930
02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:46.000
getting rid of mass incarceration as you as you're using it?

1931
02:05:46.680 --> 02:05:51.680
<v 3>So America has 5% of the world's population and 22% of the world's prison</v>

1932
02:05:56.610 --> 02:05:57.443
population.

1933
02:05:58.230 --> 02:06:01.860
We love to lock people up and throw away the key.

1934
02:06:01.980 --> 02:06:06.980
We are the only country in the world that routinely sentences children to life

1935
02:06:07.921 --> 02:06:08.640
in prison.

1936
02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:12.330
So we have a 14 year old who makes a bad decision and then they're going to die

1937
02:06:12.331 --> 02:06:13.164
in prison.

1938
02:06:13.590 --> 02:06:18.590
And according to everything I've seen five years in present as a turning point

1939
02:06:19.471 --> 02:06:23.160
for many people after they've served five years as long enough to take ownership

1940
02:06:23.190 --> 02:06:25.860
and then to not recidivate.

1941
02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:30.480
And there are other countries that are far more progressive about rehabilitation

1942
02:06:30.930 --> 02:06:33.660
efforts and about not just making it to be about punishment,

1943
02:06:33.661 --> 02:06:35.160
but about being correction.

1944
02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:40.460
So I am looking forward to the day one 76.6% of people in prison don't

1945
02:06:42.150 --> 02:06:44.240
recidivate,
but,
uh,

1946
02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:49.280
beyond pres preventing recidivism and also preventing generational

1947
02:06:50.700 --> 02:06:55.410
incarceration.
Since 70% of the children of incarcerated people go to prison.

1948
02:06:55.980 --> 02:07:00.260
The other piece of this that I want to tackle is,
uh,

1949
02:07:00.330 --> 02:07:03.960
the way that we sentence people,

1950
02:07:03.961 --> 02:07:08.370
the way that we even arrest people.
So in our country,

1951
02:07:08.490 --> 02:07:13.490
some people look more arrestable than others because of the color of their skin

1952
02:07:14.191 --> 02:07:18.810
or their economic status,
how beat up of a car they drive.

1953
02:07:18.811 --> 02:07:22.200
And a lot of studies show that white people in black people use and sell drugs

1954
02:07:22.201 --> 02:07:25.950
at same rates.
But in some states,
if you're a person of color,

1955
02:07:25.951 --> 02:07:30.951
you'll be sentenced that 20 x the amount that a white person might be sentenced.

1956
02:07:31.291 --> 02:07:36.291
Or like the Brock Turner case that the cute little swimmer boy who raped a girl

1957
02:07:37.571 --> 02:07:39.280
and got six months for that.

1958
02:07:39.910 --> 02:07:44.530
I mean if he were not so cute or so whiter,
such a fast swimmer,

1959
02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:48.460
he would have gotten life in prison.
And so I,

1960
02:07:48.670 --> 02:07:53.670
I look forward to working on sentencing reform efforts and bail and bond reform

1961
02:07:55.421 --> 02:07:59.710
efforts because right now if you're picked up by the police,
um,

1962
02:07:59.870 --> 02:08:04.870
you haven't been given due process and your bail is 500 bucks and you're sitting

1963
02:08:05.981 --> 02:08:07.050
in jail and you,

1964
02:08:07.660 --> 02:08:10.780
you can't prove your innocence because you don't have an attorney.

1965
02:08:11.290 --> 02:08:15.820
You're going to sit there maybe for six months until they wear you out.

1966
02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:19.480
And then they convince you to plead guilty to a charge.

1967
02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:22.010
And if you are a,

1968
02:08:22.100 --> 02:08:25.060
if you don't have economic resources to get a good attorney,

1969
02:08:25.450 --> 02:08:28.930
you're probably going to plead guilty.
And they'll tell you,
oh,

1970
02:08:28.931 --> 02:08:31.820
if you plead guilty to this lesser felony or this misdemeanor,

1971
02:08:31.821 --> 02:08:36.640
it won't be a big deal in six months.
Maybe your girlfriend has left you,

1972
02:08:36.641 --> 02:08:40.210
your employer has dropped you like the world has changed by the way.

1973
02:08:40.211 --> 02:08:44.620
Now you have a criminal history to good luck getting a job and you're super down

1974
02:08:44.621 --> 02:08:48.880
on yourself because you've just spent six months waiting in a cell getting

1975
02:08:48.881 --> 02:08:52.690
dehumanized every single day.
That's the kind of stuff.

1976
02:08:53.170 --> 02:08:58.170
The way that people of color in particular and the harshness and the disparities

1977
02:09:00.281 --> 02:09:05.281
of sentencing is something that I really want to be able to use my voice and not

1978
02:09:06.041 --> 02:09:07.480
just my voice,
our opinions,

1979
02:09:07.481 --> 02:09:12.160
but defies results and defies amazing community of supporters.

1980
02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:13.390
I want to fix it.

1981
02:09:15.140 --> 02:09:16.550
<v 1>Well.
I've been very impressed with</v>

1982
02:09:18.180 --> 02:09:22.110
defy the end,
the story and certainly the results,

1983
02:09:22.111 --> 02:09:24.900
which is the first thing that I,
I look at.

1984
02:09:24.901 --> 02:09:29.901
So I do encourage people to check out a second chance and a that'll be linked to

1985
02:09:29.971 --> 02:09:32.550
in the show notes,
which I'll remind people of shortly.

1986
02:09:34.450 --> 02:09:36.250
I want to come back for a second too,

1987
02:09:37.940 --> 02:09:39.500
ask you a question.

1988
02:09:40.190 --> 02:09:45.190
What questions do you ask yourself to help you get centered or focused or

1989
02:09:45.471 --> 02:09:46.880
anything else?
And I'll,

1990
02:09:46.970 --> 02:09:51.380
I'll buy time by bringing up one that is a paraphrase from Jerry Colonna.

1991
02:09:51.620 --> 02:09:53.900
So I've spent a good amount of time with Jerry on the phone.

1992
02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:59.120
And one of the questions that I found very helpful and insightful,

1993
02:09:59.210 --> 02:10:03.380
which I'm sure I'm going to be mangling a little bit that he asks,
is,

1994
02:10:03.381 --> 02:10:07.460
how are you complicit in the conditions you say you don't want,
right?

1995
02:10:07.461 --> 02:10:12.440
So how are you contributing to the things you say you don't want?

1996
02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:16.970
Uh,
whether those are conflicting goals,
whether those are conflicting priorities,

1997
02:10:16.971 --> 02:10:21.650
whether those are goals you have without any accountability,

1998
02:10:21.651 --> 02:10:23.450
whatever it might be.
But that question,

1999
02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:26.070
how are you complicit in the conditions you say you don't want?

2000
02:10:26.071 --> 02:10:28.790
And I found very helpful over the last few years.

2001
02:10:28.791 --> 02:10:33.791
Are there any questions or exercises you use

2002
02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:37.220
<v 3>for yourself on a regular basis?</v>

2003
02:10:38.210 --> 02:10:42.930
So when I was going through my resignation,
I have,
I've had a lot of,
uh,

2004
02:10:43.010 --> 02:10:47.660
opportunity to study what leads to people bombing out and failing.

2005
02:10:47.740 --> 02:10:50.900
And I read a book called leading on empty by Wayne Cordero.

2006
02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:54.680
It has sorta like a Christian spend to it as a disclaimer for your audience.

2007
02:10:54.681 --> 02:10:55.514
But um,

2008
02:10:56.360 --> 02:11:01.360
I mean a lot of us leaders or people who have big goals will,

2009
02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:04.520
uh,
lead on empty or drive ourselves to empty.

2010
02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:09.880
And this book similar to essential ism or a lot of other good business books,

2011
02:11:10.251 --> 02:11:11.480
ask the question like,

2012
02:11:12.020 --> 02:11:17.020
what is the 5% that only I can do that no one else can do and why am I spending

2013
02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:24.290
all this time doing other things that so many other people can do,

2014
02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:27.170
even if I can maybe do them better in my own arrogance,
right?

2015
02:11:27.500 --> 02:11:31.610
So asking myself,
what's my 5% like,

2016
02:11:31.611 --> 02:11:33.350
what's my secret sauce?

2017
02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:38.440
What is my gift that I bring into this world is something I ask myself nearly

2018
02:11:39.020 --> 02:11:41.960
every day.
And I've really been honing in on this lately.

2019
02:11:42.260 --> 02:11:46.640
I just hired a president for defy ventures and his name is Roger Gordon and I'm

2020
02:11:46.641 --> 02:11:48.470
so excited to partner with this guy.

2021
02:11:48.710 --> 02:11:52.580
He will run the day to day operations of defy because that's not me.

2022
02:11:52.581 --> 02:11:54.920
It's not what I like to do.
I don't love managing people.

2023
02:11:54.921 --> 02:11:56.810
I don't pretend that I'm the best in the world at it,

2024
02:11:56.811 --> 02:12:01.811
but I do know that I'm highly innovative and I can see problems and come up with

2025
02:12:02.031 --> 02:12:03.050
solutions.

2026
02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:07.550
I know that I'm a strong extra journal representative for defy,

2027
02:12:07.551 --> 02:12:12.380
so doing more speaking engagements,
although I don't love raising money,

2028
02:12:12.381 --> 02:12:16.070
I'm good at it.
So I'm going to keep doing that.
But I also,

2029
02:12:16.730 --> 02:12:21.730
I know that I have the ability to earn the trust of the people that we work

2030
02:12:23.091 --> 02:12:27.530
with.
And so for example,
lately I've been working,

2031
02:12:27.980 --> 02:12:29.090
um,
within,

2032
02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:34.610
within some pretty intense gang culture is that some reconciliation efforts.

2033
02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:39.470
And for some reason this white girl here is,
um,

2034
02:12:39.590 --> 02:12:41.660
trusted enough by,

2035
02:12:42.290 --> 02:12:46.220
by these people to talk about some,

2036
02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:49.490
some big transformation efforts.
So that's what I'm focusing on.

2037
02:12:49.730 --> 02:12:54.730
And then I'm working very hard and swiftly to get other things off of my plate

2038
02:12:55.220 --> 02:12:57.080
so I don't have responsibility for them,

2039
02:12:57.270 --> 02:13:00.140
scary to me to lose control over them too.

2040
02:13:00.740 --> 02:13:04.760
But I have such amazing staff at defy now nationally,

2041
02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:09.920
that I'm glad to give away that responsibility.
So I can focus on my type top 5%.

2042
02:13:10.910 --> 02:13:13.970
Like if I died in a year,
what would I spend my time doing?

2043
02:13:14.150 --> 02:13:17.270
I ask myself that all the time and I know that that might sound like a little

2044
02:13:17.271 --> 02:13:21.990
bit.
Um,
what's the word?
Morbid.
Morbid.

2045
02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:24.260
Yeah.
I don't care how morbid it sounds.

2046
02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:27.400
At defy we have our EIT,

2047
02:13:27.800 --> 02:13:32.800
right their eulogies and in and I've done that and in fact we have them write

2048
02:13:32.821 --> 02:13:37.260
two eulogies and this is a pretty good exercise.
Then other people can try to,

2049
02:13:37.290 --> 02:13:38.790
one of them is your current trajectory.

2050
02:13:38.791 --> 02:13:42.750
You would you like if you died now doing your same old same old and unit,

2051
02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:44.190
make major changes in your life,

2052
02:13:44.191 --> 02:13:48.180
what would your eulogy say and how do you feel about it?
Most people wouldn't.

2053
02:13:48.190 --> 02:13:53.190
We super satisfied with it and then we have them write their ideal but realistic

2054
02:13:53.521 --> 02:13:58.521
you'll achieve like if you lived your best life that is realistic for you also,

2055
02:13:59.130 --> 02:14:00.090
what would that look like?

2056
02:14:00.330 --> 02:14:04.500
And then the most important part is read out the 10 changes that you need to

2057
02:14:04.501 --> 02:14:08.490
make to get from a to B and then prioritize them.

2058
02:14:08.491 --> 02:14:13.020
And pick your top three things that you can start doing today to live a better

2059
02:14:13.021 --> 02:14:17.400
life.
And so I applied all these little defy exercises to my own life.

2060
02:14:17.460 --> 02:14:22.110
And yeah,
I guess I live in a sort of morbid thing,

2061
02:14:22.140 --> 02:14:23.370
morbid sense,

2062
02:14:23.371 --> 02:14:27.510
but like time is limited for all of us and I want to have the greatest impact in

2063
02:14:27.511 --> 02:14:28.800
the shortest amount of time.

2064
02:14:28.801 --> 02:14:33.801
So how do I use the gifts that I have been given to?

2065
02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:36.360
This is my generous hustle.

2066
02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:41.390
This is my ability to share something with a world that only I can create.

2067
02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:49.500
<v 1>Well,
Kat,
thank you for developing,</v>

2068
02:14:49.501 --> 02:14:54.000
sharing and communicating your gifts with the world.

2069
02:14:54.001 --> 02:14:55.230
You're doing really important work.

2070
02:14:55.920 --> 02:15:00.430
And thank you for taking the time to hang out.
Maybe,
uh,

2071
02:15:00.450 --> 02:15:05.370
maybe someday I'll give you a chance to heal.
Hook me,
uh,
in person.

2072
02:15:05.430 --> 02:15:09.510
Maybe we can,
we can coordinate that with the prison visit that I did commit to.

2073
02:15:09.570 --> 02:15:12.940
So do you have me on the hook for that?
And uh,

2074
02:15:12.941 --> 02:15:16.980
I really appreciate you doing what you do in number one.
But number two,

2075
02:15:16.981 --> 02:15:21.270
also taking the time to to share today and to have this conversation.

2076
02:15:22.150 --> 02:15:26.740
<v 3>Well,
Tim getting to speak with you as one of the greatest honors that I've had.</v>

2077
02:15:26.741 --> 02:15:31.741
I was really excited about this because I know how influential your audiences

2078
02:15:33.250 --> 02:15:35.740
and am I allowed to share my email address?
Tim,

2079
02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:38.360
<v 1>we talked a little bit about this.
Yes.</v>

2080
02:15:38.361 --> 02:15:43.361
If you are willing to get the hug of death with mass numbers of people emailing,

2081
02:15:43.881 --> 02:15:45.560
you're welcome to share your email address.

2082
02:15:46.180 --> 02:15:50.990
<v 3>I,
here's what I will say to anyone who's listening is if you email me,</v>

2083
02:15:50.991 --> 02:15:52.460
I'm in prison all the time,

2084
02:15:52.490 --> 02:15:57.230
so please keep it really short and sweet and to the point,
um,

2085
02:15:57.530 --> 02:15:59.150
I'm not trying to be rude or anything but,

2086
02:15:59.240 --> 02:16:01.400
but if you want to get involved with defy,
first of all,

2087
02:16:01.401 --> 02:16:05.990
you can go to defy ventures.org but if you want to email me my email address is

2088
02:16:06.890 --> 02:16:11.890
a cat@defyventuresdotorgexceedateaatdefyventures.org and tell me if you would

2089
02:16:17.031 --> 02:16:21.410
like to come to prison or if you'd like to have us come speak at your

2090
02:16:21.411 --> 02:16:24.380
organization or how you would like to get involved.

2091
02:16:24.381 --> 02:16:26.990
If you want to provide a scholarship to one of our [inaudible],

2092
02:16:27.230 --> 02:16:32.200
we would be really grateful you would become even more of an advocate of second

2093
02:16:32.201 --> 02:16:36.970
chances and share this message with other people.
Because I always say,

2094
02:16:37.660 --> 02:16:38.830
who would our country be?

2095
02:16:38.831 --> 02:16:43.780
Who would we all be if we lived up to being the land of second chances that we

2096
02:16:43.810 --> 02:16:45.370
claim to be?
So Tim,

2097
02:16:45.371 --> 02:16:50.350
thank you for the opportunity to share our mission and my story.

2098
02:16:50.351 --> 02:16:55.351
And I see it as a big responsibility and a huge privilege to be a voice on

2099
02:16:58.541 --> 02:17:00.820
behalf of people who are incarcerated,

2100
02:17:00.821 --> 02:17:04.810
who become voiceless and often written off and vote less.

2101
02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:10.390
And so it's my honor to get to share some of our story with all of you.

2102
02:17:10.450 --> 02:17:11.283
Thank you.

2103
02:17:11.740 --> 02:17:14.500
<v 1>My pleasure.
It's everybody.
Check it out a second chance.</v>

2104
02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:19.240
And for those long term listeners,
you know this part already,

2105
02:17:19.241 --> 02:17:21.070
but as always,

2106
02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:25.720
you can find links to everything we talked about the books,
a second chance,

2107
02:17:26.260 --> 02:17:28.090
the defy website and much,

2108
02:17:28.091 --> 02:17:31.270
much more in the show notes at Tim Dot.

2109
02:17:31.271 --> 02:17:34.420
Blog forward slash podcast or you can find the show notes for all episodes.

2110
02:17:34.421 --> 02:17:38.860
This one included.
So Tim.
Dot blog slash podcast.
So Kat,

2111
02:17:39.250 --> 02:17:44.250
thank you once again for the time and a lovely conversation that has given me a

2112
02:17:44.291 --> 02:17:48.910
lot of food for thought and also things to look forward to,

2113
02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:54.060
including that visit that we're going to take together and to everyone

2114
02:17:54.131 --> 02:17:56.200
listening,
as always,

2115
02:17:56.710 --> 02:18:01.150
thank you for listening and until next time,
keep experimenting,

2116
02:18:01.151 --> 02:18:06.010
keep testing assumptions and uh,
give yourself a second chance.

2117
02:18:07.420 --> 02:18:11.110
Take a moment for forgiveness.
And uh,

2118
02:18:11.180 --> 02:18:15.970
that will in turn affect how you are better able to forgive others.

2119
02:18:16.930 --> 02:18:17.763
Thanks everybody.

2120
02:18:19.850 --> 02:18:23.240
<v 7>Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

2121
02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:26.240
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

2122
02:18:26.540 --> 02:18:29.450
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2123
02:18:29.510 --> 02:18:33.650
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

2124
02:18:33.651 --> 02:18:37.220
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

2125
02:18:37.221 --> 02:18:41.540
short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

2126
02:18:41.541 --> 02:18:43.040
pondering over the week.

2127
02:18:43.070 --> 02:18:45.830
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

2128
02:18:45.831 --> 02:18:49.310
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2129
02:18:49.311 --> 02:18:53.600
somehow dug up in the other world of the esoteric as I do.

2130
02:18:53.900 --> 02:18:58.900
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

2131
02:18:59.541 --> 02:19:02.270
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

2132
02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:07.340
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

2133
02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:09.560
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

2134
02:19:09.860 --> 02:19:14.510
Just go to four hour work week.com that's four hour work week.com all spelled

2135
02:19:14.511 --> 02:19:18.380
out and just drop in your email and you will get the very next one and if you

2136
02:19:18.381 --> 02:19:19.790
sign up,
I hope you enjoy it.

2137
02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:24.860
This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens every year.

2138
02:19:24.980 --> 02:19:26.900
Of course people look for new ways to become,

2139
02:19:27.710 --> 02:19:30.980
to take their fitness and so on to the next level.
For me,

2140
02:19:31.010 --> 02:19:35.240
step number one is having some form of nutritional insurance.

2141
02:19:35.241 --> 02:19:39.050
That's how I would look at it and the nutritional insurance needs to make sure

2142
02:19:39.051 --> 02:19:41.720
all of my basic needs are met.

2143
02:19:41.900 --> 02:19:46.370
All the boxes checked regardless of travel schedule,
missed meals and so on.

2144
02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:50.360
They're going to be times in the new year when your diet and exercise will get

2145
02:19:50.361 --> 02:19:55.010
interrupted.
Life will interrupt it in during those times.
You want a safety net.

2146
02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:58.430
I get asked all the time,
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

2147
02:19:58.760 --> 02:20:01.370
My answer is inevitably athletic Greens.

2148
02:20:01.371 --> 02:20:03.830
It is your all in one nutritional insurance.

2149
02:20:03.860 --> 02:20:05.540
I recommended it in the four hour body,

2150
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:09.590
did not get paid for that and I travel with it to avoid getting sick.

2151
02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:12.620
I take it in the mornings to ensure optimal performance.

2152
02:20:12.860 --> 02:20:17.150
It just covers all my basis if I can't get what I need through whole food meals

2153
02:20:17.151 --> 02:20:20.570
throughout the rest of the day.

2156
02:20:30.861 --> 02:20:31.760
covers my basis.

2157
02:20:31.761 --> 02:20:35.540
Each day is part of my routine and that leaves me with less to worry about.

2158
02:20:35.630 --> 02:20:38.900
If for instance,
I have to skip a meal or just can't get high quality,

2161
02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:49.100
This episode is brought to you by four sigmatic.

2162
02:20:49.160 --> 02:20:51.950
You might remember four sigmatic for their mushroom coffee,

2163
02:20:52.040 --> 02:20:56.120
which was created by those clever finished founders and when I first mentioned

2164
02:20:56.210 --> 02:20:59.540
that coffee on this podcast,
the product sold out in less than a week.

2165
02:20:59.541 --> 02:21:03.620
It lights you up like a Christmas tree,
which can be really useful.
However,

2166
02:21:03.890 --> 02:21:08.030
recently I've been testing the opposite side of the spectrum of new product and

2167
02:21:08.031 --> 02:21:12.830
that is their Reishi mushroom elixir to help me end my day to get to sleep.

2168
02:21:13.610 --> 02:21:15.770
As you guys may know,
longtime listeners,

2169
02:21:15.771 --> 02:21:19.430
at least I struggled with insomnia for decades.
I have a largely fixed that,

2170
02:21:19.460 --> 02:21:22.580
but still shutting off my monkey brain has never been easy.

2171
02:21:22.581 --> 02:21:26.630
It still isn't easy very often and I found ratio which had been fascinated by

2172
02:21:26.631 --> 02:21:28.700
for a few years now has been very,

2173
02:21:28.701 --> 02:21:32.600
very effective and calming their old formula.
However,

2174
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:37.490
four sigmatic old formula included Stevia and I like to avoid sweeteners,

2175
02:21:37.550 --> 02:21:42.550
all sweeteners for a host of reasons and I then just ping them and asked,

2176
02:21:43.760 --> 02:21:48.050
hey guys,
I would love to experiment with this and maybe actually suggested,

2177
02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:51.500
but I'd like a version without sweeteners if you'd be open to it.

2178
02:21:51.620 --> 02:21:52.790
If too much of a headache,
don't worry.

2179
02:21:53.180 --> 02:21:56.930
And they are always game for experimentation.

2180
02:21:56.990 --> 02:22:00.650
So they created a special custom version without the Stevia,
without sweeteners.

2181
02:22:00.980 --> 02:22:03.170
Now it is part of my nightly routine.

2182
02:22:03.740 --> 02:22:06.320
Their ratio looks or comes in single serving packets,

2183
02:22:06.321 --> 02:22:09.290
which are perfect for travel and in fact I'm about to leave the country right

2184
02:22:09.291 --> 02:22:13.130
now and I have a packet in front of me that's just going to sit in the end of my

2185
02:22:13.131 --> 02:22:17.660
carry on bag.
You only need hot water and it mixes very,

2186
02:22:17.661 --> 02:22:18.494
very easily.

2187
02:22:18.890 --> 02:22:23.030
Here's some recommended copy that they put in the read,

2188
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:27.230
so I'm going to read it and I'll give you my take quote,
a warning for those.

2189
02:22:27.231 --> 02:22:28.380
In the experimental mindset,

2190
02:22:28.500 --> 02:22:31.920
Reishi is strong and bitter and France sees like any great medicine,

2191
02:22:32.130 --> 02:22:33.480
so if the bitterness is too much,

2192
02:22:33.481 --> 02:22:37.650
I recommend trying it with honey end or nut milk such as almond milk and quote.

2193
02:22:38.310 --> 02:22:39.960
So I'm going to say no,

2194
02:22:40.050 --> 02:22:44.460
you should suck it up and you should drink the tea because it's not that bitter.

2195
02:22:44.910 --> 02:22:48.720
And Matey should take the advice of all Chinese people when they're criticizing

2196
02:22:48.721 --> 02:22:51.210
young ins.
When they say when I'm sure cool.

2197
02:22:51.270 --> 02:22:56.210
Which means you're not able to eat bitterness.
Bitter is in many cases,

2198
02:22:56.211 --> 02:22:59.760
an indication of things that help liberty toxification.
It's on,

2199
02:23:00.120 --> 02:23:01.590
not saying that's the case here,

2200
02:23:01.591 --> 02:23:06.360
but I've tested this ratio lecture on family members,

2201
02:23:06.361 --> 02:23:08.850
on friends,
everybody has liked it.
It's a little bit,
or if the,

2202
02:23:08.851 --> 02:23:12.660
it's not that hard.
So I would just say suck it up and no,

2203
02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:16.830
don't put it in honey or milk or any of that shit.
Just drink the goddamn tea.

2204
02:23:16.831 --> 02:23:19.950
It's delicious I think.
Right.
If you like poo air and that kind of stuff,

2205
02:23:19.951 --> 02:23:23.490
that type of tea,
you're going to dig it.
So just try it.
Okay.

2206
02:23:23.640 --> 02:23:27.510
Back to then my read.
