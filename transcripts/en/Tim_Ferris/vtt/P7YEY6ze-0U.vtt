00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.710
Evokes Tim Ferriss here.

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.740
I thought I would talk a little bit about accelerated learning in specifically

3
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:10.560
the capacity of memorizing foreign vocabulary.
How do you learn a language?

4
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.701
Thought a lot about this.

5
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:15.420
And I thought I was terrible at languages up until about 15.

6
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.400
I had done very poorly.
It's Spanish.
And when I moved from one school to another,

7
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:23.130
I had a chance to choose from other languages.

8
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.520
And since I had friends who were going into Japanese,
I figured,
well,

9
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:30.120
if I'm going to fail in languages,
I might as well fail in a class or my friends,

10
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.210
or at least in the same room or went to Japanese and eventually went to Japan as

11
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:36.714
an exchange student.

12
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.050
And that triggered an entire discovery of my own ability to learn languages and

13
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:45.060
your ability to learn languages.
I was not bad at languages,

14
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:46.230
I just had the wrong method.

15
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.390
I had teachers who really weren't enabling me to

16
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.900
create approaches that would make the language stick.
So I'm going to help you,

17
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.280
uh,
with a few different approaches and examples that I've used over and over and

18
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:03.114
over again.

19
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.800
So I'm not going to talk about learning languages ad nauseum in every respect

20
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:10.710
cause that could be hours and hours long.
If you want some of that,

21
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:13.710
I highly recommend that you just go to tim.blog.

22
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.830
There's a topics section and it has language learning.

23
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:20.910
I have a bunch of different articles that I've written as well as articles by

24
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:22.740
Benny Lewis who's fantastic.

25
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.550
Irish polyglot is his nickname and a handful of other folks which are

26
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.880
spectacular and have links and links and links to tons of resources.

27
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.140
I'm going to talk about vocab because most people are very intimidated by

28
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:39.141
learning a high volume of words and if you approach it the right way,

29
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:43.110
you can actually learn hundreds of words per day if you want it to make that

30
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:46.440
effectively your fulltime job.
If you want to make it just a part time Gig,

31
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.360
you can still learn 10 to a hundred words per day if you really make an effort

32
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:52.710
of it.
And if you do that,

33
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.250
you don't have to learn a hundred thousand words to be functionally

34
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.460
conversationally fluent in a given language.

35
00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:04.320
Meaning you can hold a long conversation.
You really only need about 2000 words.

36
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.640
Very rough approximation and there are some fantastic flashcards for instance,

37
00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:13.641
from companies like visit Ed vis hyphen e d.com which compiles the flashcards

38
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.520
from high frequency word lists based on usage in newspapers,

39
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:22.020
books and so on.

40
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.820
What I would say though is that this is best illustrated by example.

41
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.880
So rather than wrote I e the repetition of this in English,

42
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:37.620
is this in Spanish,
this an English is this in Spanish?

43
00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:39.990
And just hoping that that is going to get a foothold in your mind.

44
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.220
Let's just say call and Vacca the ACA.
All right,

45
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:48.570
so vodka is cow vaca,
fuck on cow,
etc. How would you remember this?

46
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.350
That we are highly,
uh,
visually adapted.

47
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:57.351
We are evolved to be very visually acute and we are driven that way and our

48
00:02:57.631 --> 00:03:01.030
memory is highly tagged,
cued by any type of imagery.

49
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:04.630
So what I would suggest in such a case is that you use something that has been

50
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:08.320
nicknamed the link word,
mnemonic.
There are other ways to label it.

51
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.300
Really all this entails is creating a link between the words that is image
based.

52
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.330
So if we have a word like vodka and I would encourage you when you're first

53
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:22.870
learning vocab to the extent possible not to fixate on the spelling because it

54
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:27.130
can throw you off vodka vodka,
what does that sound like?
Vacuum maybe.
All right,

55
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:30.280
so what could you imagine you could imagine cow,

56
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.330
because you want to use the Q and English because if you can recall the Spanish,

57
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:35.800
let's say in this case from English,

58
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.310
you can always recognize the Spanish but not vice versa,

59
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:43.270
which is why if you're looking in a book and it has say the Spanish terms listed

60
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:46.960
first and then the English terms listed,
I wouldn't use it.

61
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.070
I would switch the order.

62
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.450
So I would even use a piece of paper potentially to cover up the Spanish and

63
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:55.210
only use the English as a cue,
as as your native language.

64
00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.450
So Vaka let's imagine that there is a cow and it has a really oddly shaped head

65
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.750
that looks like the end of a vacuum and it's sucking up the grass on the ground.

66
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.030
All right,
so it's cow with a head like a vacuum sucking up grass.

67
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.190
Cow Vacuum.
Vacca all right.
That would be a very simple example.

68
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.990
Other approaches you could take a which are a little more flexible,

69
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.080
but more or less the same thing if you have something much more complicated.

70
00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:27.690
So let's say you have a term like Momoko hockey.
Well,

71
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.380
Michael Huckabee is detached retina in Japanese.

72
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.760
So number one,

73
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.840
you have something that's a lot longer Momoko how could it all right,
the hell,

74
00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:40.630
does that sound like an English?
Not a whole lot.
Uh,

75
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.480
it's also something a little more complex,
detached retina.

76
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.010
And what you realized quickly is that you generally just need a cue,

77
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.750
which is why,
for instance,

78
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:53.380
you'll see a higher hit rate on the wheel of fortune if you give people the

79
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:58.300
first few letters than say,
last few letters.
So taking that as an analogy,

80
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.530
the way we would work with that Momoko how could you,
what is the first part?

81
00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:07.300
Sounded like Moma.
Moma.
Moma.
Okay.
Maybe it sounds like the Moma.

82
00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:12.100
So he live in a place like San Francisco,
New York,
and the Museum of Modern Art.

83
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.540
So it sounds like the Moma.
All right,

84
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:18.520
well you could imagine then people walking into the Moma and looking at displays

85
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.190
and just having their eyeballs blow out of there.
Okay.

86
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.350
So just imagine a bunch of people walking into the Moma and getting detached

87
00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:28.390
retinas because their eyeballs blow out of their heads,

88
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.520
like splatter the paintings in front of all right.

89
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.590
And then that because you have Moma,

90
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.850
there's a decent chance that you will then remember more Mako hockey.

91
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.610
And in the case of say Japanese,

92
00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:42.880
you have the characters which you would learn later and it becomes even easier

93
00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:46.570
because you will be breaking that word into mole Mako.

94
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:50.800
How could into a few characters.
Okay.
Uh,
if you are learning,

95
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.230
so that is how you would tackle,

96
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.560
say something in a slightly more complex in terms of a longer word.
For instance,

97
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.730
if are learning a tonal language such as Mandarin.

98
00:06:00.731 --> 00:06:05.540
So I've studied mandarin and uh,
spent time in China at two universities.

99
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.190
How should you learn tons?
That is of course part of learning the vocabulary.

100
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.850
This is something that just slaughters a lot of students of Chinese,

101
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.180
particularly if they have lax teachers.
Number one,

102
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:22.181
you need merciless hard as teachers because they will bludge in you and they

103
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:26.150
should into training your vocal chords to make the proper sound.

104
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.980
I don't care how many times you hear something like [inaudible] if you haven't

105
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.280
developed the actual vocal cord ability,

106
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.980
which is just like doing any type of stretching or strength training,

107
00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:40.880
you have to condition your throat to build,
make those sounds.
You are Sol,

108
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:44.420
you're shit out of luck and if they don't reinforce that and force you to get it

109
00:06:44.421 --> 00:06:46.220
correct and train properly,

110
00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:49.910
you're going to do a lot of bad repetitions and I met many students after six

111
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:53.390
months of doing Chinese,
had a ton of what they thought was great vocabulary.

112
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.000
They went to China and nobody understood a thing.

113
00:06:56.001 --> 00:06:59.450
They were saying they had to start from scratch.
So don't do that.

114
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.450
Now we come down to choosing materials.
And what I would say is that if possible,

115
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:07.250
and this is an unpopular position,

116
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.760
but you want to use a writing system in English,

117
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.860
so the Romanizing of say Chinese that indicates the tone in the spelling.

118
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.910
This is very controversial.
So there's a system,
for instance called Gr,

119
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.600
which stands for goal.

120
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.610
You'd Oman and you would say have first tone in Chinese for wall.

121
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.640
Well,
Gee,
you owe then Guam,
second tone.

122
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.880
Should it be country like glowy country language,

123
00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:40.430
which is kind of a long story and we'll piss off a bunch of mainlanders,

124
00:07:40.431 --> 00:07:42.740
but that's okay.
Uh,
so Guam,

125
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.820
Gwo and then if I wanted to say Chook Wa uh,

126
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.850
so he has gone,
I have gone,
gone forth.
Tony,
G.
U.
O.
H.

127
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:58.270
This helps dramatically with memorization of vocab and specifically retaining

128
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.480
the tones.
The more popular system that is used in textbooks for Chinese,

129
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.323
for Mandarin,

130
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:11.350
certainly probably for Cantonese to his pinion pinion is where you would have

131
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.890
say this.
Well,

132
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:21.080
and then they would use a diacritical mark at the top to say wall,

133
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.680
second tone or fourth tone.

134
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.360
Well with these funky little lines on the top and the bottom students do not

135
00:08:31.971 --> 00:08:35.150
remember that stuff from all I can tell and everything I've seen.

136
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.080
The problem is,
as a teacher in a university,

137
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:45.040
you are oftentimes rewarded by how many students you can keep in a class or get

138
00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:49.610
to a passing grade.
Gr is a huge pain in the ass in the beginning.

139
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.130
But if we're thinking like Abe Lincoln,

140
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.960
if I'm given six hours to chop down a tree,

141
00:08:53.961 --> 00:08:56.220
I'll send the spend the first four hours sharpening the ax.

142
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.240
You want to do the heavy lifting in the beginning so that you can have a much

143
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.660
smoother ride later on.
And in a total language,

144
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:08.250
part of that is choosing the right Romanization of that language.

145
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:12.270
And in my opinion,
Gr is highly,
highly,
highly underrated.

146
00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:15.480
It's just a huge pain in the ass in the beginning.

147
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.630
So you'll be very frustrated for the first couple of weeks maybe.

148
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.650
And then looking back,
if you actually stick with it,
you'll think to yourself,

149
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:23.670
my God,

150
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.050
that was just a divine gift that I learned a Gr instead of pinion.

151
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.830
Uh,
alright.
And then there are of course,

152
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.070
the tools that if you want to space your repetition,

153
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.600
even if it's practicing the recall of something like cows in Spanish,

154
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.710
what was that cow vacuum vodka,
right?

155
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.410
Or if you're trying to think,
ah,
detached retina,

156
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:47.940
which you probably won't have much use for,

157
00:09:47.941 --> 00:09:49.800
but I learned it because I read comic books.

158
00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:51.720
I had a lot of fighting in them to learn.
Japanese,

159
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.970
talked about detachment and has a fair amount,

160
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:59.660
well detached retinas blowing onto the paintings were at the Moma Moma.

161
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.690
How could he Mamak awkward is detached retina.
All right?

162
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.270
But you still have to figure out how frequently,

163
00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:10.890
how often to use these types of say,
flashcards or cues.

164
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.600
Remember that you're gonna look at the English first,

165
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.310
not the target language first.
And there are many different things you could use.

166
00:10:17.311 --> 00:10:20.670
You could read an article,
say in wired magazine,
written about super memo,

167
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.990
which is a very fascinating spaced repetition approach.
Super memo,

168
00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:26.490
which has then been turned into say,

169
00:10:26.491 --> 00:10:30.020
software programs and apps like unkeen a and Kai,

170
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.750
which in Japanese is actually wrote memorization.
So it's,

171
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.260
there's some irony to that,

172
00:10:34.261 --> 00:10:38.860
but Ankeny a and the KPI and then of course in a biased here because I,

173
00:10:38.861 --> 00:10:43.080
I've been involved with the company and help them,
uh,
Duolingo,

174
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.660
it is the most popular free language learning software on the planet,

175
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.940
100 million plus users.

176
00:10:47.941 --> 00:10:52.080
And they also have a separate app that is used for flashcards.

177
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.680
So there are many different ways to approach this,
many ways to learn languages,

178
00:10:55.681 --> 00:11:00.180
but it is my,
my firm belief that if you approach it in a rational,

179
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:07.170
methodical way that you can become conversationally fluent in just about any

180
00:11:07.171 --> 00:11:11.130
language in eight to 12 weeks.
And that is coming from someone who quit,

181
00:11:11.131 --> 00:11:14.700
gave up on Spanish for years and years and years.

182
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:19.600
But now having practiced with Chinese,
Japanese,
Spanish,
Italian,

183
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.920
Portuguese,
Indonesian,
I,
he Bahasa I've,

184
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.500
I've played with and toyed with Turkish,
Greek,

185
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:29.580
all of these languages for just a few weeks at a time for fun in many cases,

186
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.440
I believe eight,
12 weeks,

187
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:36.470
you can be conversationally fluent or the very least functional in almost any

188
00:11:37.261 --> 00:11:39.120
language.
Certainly any language that I've encountered.

189
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.450
So that should be very reassuring.
You can tackle many,
many languages,

190
00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:46.380
not just one.
And if you learn another language,
just one additional language,

191
00:11:46.381 --> 00:11:49.890
you have a brand new lens through which to view everything in life.

192
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.710
You're changing,
your thinking changes,
your perspective changes,

193
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.100
your empathy changes.

194
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.970
So if you're trying to figure out a way to hack your lifespan,

195
00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.920
think val is drugs,
metformin,
wrap mice,

196
00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.940
and whatever you think about all these ways you might double your lifespan.
Well,

197
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:08.350
one way you can do it right now is by learning a second language.
So Godspeed.

198
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.990
Good luck.
I hope that helps.
And if you want more on mnemonic devices,
uh,

199
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.480
certainly I wrote quite a bit about mnemonic devices and learning things like

200
00:12:16.481 --> 00:12:19.150
languages in the four hour chef because it's actually a book on accelerated

201
00:12:19.151 --> 00:12:23.170
learning.
There's also a fantastic book by,
I believe the name is Higbee.

202
00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.680
I haven't read it in decades.
Your memory and how to improve it.

203
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:27.761
It's an excellent,

204
00:12:27.761 --> 00:12:32.110
excellent book on tactical and very concrete mnemonic devices that have been

205
00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:35.410
used for centuries,
uh,
that are very easy to implement.

206
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.490
So there you have it folks.
Good luck gum.

207
00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:44.140
But they go with a sigh as they would say in Japanese.
Good luck or add oil.

208
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.700
That means good luck in Chinese.
Jai y'all jai Ya Ya,
Ya,

209
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.280
Ya hope you enjoyed the video.

210
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.640
If you would like to see my favorite piece of content that I put out every week,

211
00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.970
it is a short newsletter.
Five bullet Friday.
It's free.

212
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:02.440
It's five bullet points with the coolest things that I have been finding using

213
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.990
testing in a given week.
I put it out every Friday.

214
00:13:04.991 --> 00:13:08.500
You can digest it in about five minutes.
Take a look Bible of Friday.
