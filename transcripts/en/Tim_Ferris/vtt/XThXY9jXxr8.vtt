00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.580
Alex,
welcome to the show

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.540
Alex.
Optimal.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.030
<v 1>At this altitude,</v>

4
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:12.210
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.650
I'm a cybernetic organism living this year.

6
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.930
<v 0>This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where</v>

7
00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:37.820
I deconstruct world class performers of all sorts of types ranging from

8
00:00:37.821 --> 00:00:41.480
billionaire investors to chess prodigies to actors,
to writers,

9
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.460
to athletes and everything in between.

10
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.760
In this episode we have a real treat and it's a two part episode with Alex

11
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.780
Bloomberg who is very well known as a producer for this American life cohost of

12
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:57.980
planet money and also the cofounder of gimlet media,

13
00:00:57.981 --> 00:01:01.130
which has currently to blockbuster podcasts.

14
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.640
Start up and reply all and in the first part,

15
00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:05.870
which you're currently listening to,

16
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.230
we're going to talk to Alex about all sorts of aspects of the business of

17
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:15.320
storytelling,
the art of storytelling,
including gear that he uses,

18
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.360
etc. The second part is going to be an excerpt from a class that he taught on

19
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:23.510
creative live.com normally costs about a hundred dollars.

20
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.340
And I advised that company,

21
00:01:25.341 --> 00:01:30.341
so I was able to pull out about a half hour of his teaching a class about the

22
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.340
art of the interview,
crafting the perfect question,
et cetera.
That is part two.

23
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.530
I implore you to listen to both.
I really enjoyed this.
And without further ado,

24
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.870
please enjoy Alex Bloomberg.
Alex,

25
00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:47.540
welcome to the show.
Great to be here.
Thanks for having me.

26
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.380
And I have to start off because we have been scheduling and I know you're racing

27
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:58.520
to get a show out the door.
Does it ever get any easier?

28
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.240
<v 2>I hope so.
I really hope so.
Uh,</v>

29
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.080
it is,
it has been.
Yeah,
I mean it's just been,

30
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.680
I mean it's sort of an insane project when I'm doing,
which is it,

31
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.110
which is trying to,
you know,
uh,

32
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.890
create a regularly occurring documentary podcast about a company that's starting

33
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:21.870
up while at the same time trying to start that company.

34
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.330
So it's been sort of like,
I don't,

35
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.180
it's a cause both of them are sort of full time jobs.
Um,

36
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.370
so,
yeah.
And how do you,
how do you balance,

37
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.470
<v 0>because I've listened to every episode of startup and he followed a very closely</v>

38
00:02:35.471 --> 00:02:36.940
for a whole host of reasons.

39
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.990
How do you balance the realtime documentary nature of,
uh,

40
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.700
of the show with planning,

41
00:02:42.701 --> 00:02:47.701
say an editorial calendar and actually having things locked and loaded and ready

42
00:02:47.981 --> 00:02:48.820
to go in advance?

43
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.880
<v 2>Oh,
uh,
well I don't balance it.
That's the problem.</v>

44
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.970
Like that we don't have things locked and loaded and ready to go in advance.

45
00:02:55.971 --> 00:02:59.800
Like we don't,
we,
we were,
uh,
editing

46
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.410
<v 3>the,
we were,</v>

47
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.530
we'd just finished editing this week's episode this morning and then we just

48
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:09.430
tracked it.
That's why I was a little late with you.

49
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.480
[inaudible] I was tracking it in the studio today and then it'll go up tonight.

50
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.510
So that's how close to the wire we are.
I mean we're just,
we're,
you know,

51
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:18.880
things are,
and you'll hear this episode is all about,

52
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.210
it's all about burnout and it's all

53
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.870
how,
I was wondering,
I was wondering when that episode would come.
Yeah,
yeah.

54
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.010
Um,
cause there was a period where,
where I think there's a period in a,

55
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:35.410
in a company's life where people are like,
well this is just the startup.

56
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:36.460
This is the start of experience.

57
00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:39.580
And then there's a point at which maybe like probably about right about Ron

58
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:41.530
where we are at four or five months into it,
we're like,

59
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.090
it's a startup but it shouldn't be this hard.
Uh,
and so,

60
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.860
uh,
so we,
it sort of realizing like we have to,
um,
we had to,
we have to,

61
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.360
we have to change.
Some things,
have to add some more support.
Um,
and part of it,

62
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:58.540
it's just like,
you just don't know,
you know,
like I didn't know,
I mean,

63
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.260
you know,
you,
you don't know what's possible.
And so,
so we started out,
I think we,

64
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.000
we just didn't have enough capacity to do what we were trying to do.

65
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.680
<v 0>And what is,
what is your current team look like if,
well,</v>

66
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:14.770
first question is what is tracking?
I'm still a novice at this and um,

67
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.980
I have a ton of questions,
but what is tracking exactly?

68
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.900
<v 3>Yeah,
so tracking.
So when,
when you're doing sort of a documentary style podcast,</v>

69
00:04:21.901 --> 00:04:26.610
which is sort of the kinds that we do where,
where you're,
uh,
we have a script.
Um,

70
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.120
and so what I'll do is I'll go out and I'll gather tape in the field and I'll

71
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.270
record different conversations with people and then I will edit those down.

72
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.470
And so I have a bunch of sort of like basically selects tape tape that I've

73
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.070
gathered and I've edited down and cut.
So it's like,
you know,
I'll have like a,

74
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.990
maybe like,
you know,
25 minutes of edited tape.

75
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.480
And then what I have to do is stitch that together with a script.

76
00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:52.230
And so I'll write the script and then we'll do edits on that script.

77
00:04:52.231 --> 00:04:55.680
And so I'll read it aloud in the office.
We'll all sit around a table,

78
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.080
sort of like a table read,
I guess I'll sit around,

79
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.650
I'll read my script and I'll play the tape that I've cut from the computer where

80
00:05:01.651 --> 00:05:05.370
it's supposed to go in the story and then people will give us notes on the

81
00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:08.730
script and sort of say this part was dragging and this part should come earlier.

82
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.090
And this part you can just totally get rid of,
it's boring,
whatever.

83
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.430
And then you rewrite and rewrite and rewrite.

84
00:05:14.431 --> 00:05:17.880
And then finally you get to the final script and then you go into the studio and

85
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.660
track it.
And that's when you actually just lay down your,
your,
your voice tracks.

86
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.290
Um,
and then those all get mixed together into the final product.

87
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.520
<v 0>Got It.
And the,
the,</v>

88
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.060
the actual reviewing of the tape.
So you capture a lot of interview,

89
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.870
uh,
obviously,
and I,
in one of the episodes of startup,

90
00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:41.750
you had one of your employees reviewing those tapes.

91
00:05:41.751 --> 00:05:45.320
Do you personally review those tapes or do you have someone do a first pass and

92
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.650
attempt to pull out the interesting stuff?
It

93
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.210
<v 3>goes both ways.
I mean,
usually I've been the one getting the tape.
Uh,</v>

94
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.210
so I have heard it at,
because I was there,
you know,
I was there.
Right.
You know,

95
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.970
with the,
you know,
with the microphone and the,
and the recorder.
Uh,

96
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.560
but usually it's my producer who actually does a first pass through and pulls

97
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:10.250
all the,
all the selects.
Got It.

98
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.960
And what are,
what are the criteria for pulling the selects?
What,

99
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.870
what is what makes something worth being in the show?

100
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.940
I think what you're asking Tim is what makes good tape,
uh,
we just,
which is,

101
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.590
that's right.
That's exactly what I'm asking.

102
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.130
That's the question that has consumed my life for the vest one years.
Uh,

103
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.640
so I have an answer for you.
Um,
so I think,
I think when,
you know,

104
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:32.390
one of the things that,

105
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.900
there's a couple of things that you looking for when you're going through the

106
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:39.110
tape.
So,
because I have a script,
because I'm narrating it,

107
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.430
I can sort of say pretty much all the,
all the basic information,

108
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.810
usually better than anybody that I'm talking to.
So what I'm going for,

109
00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:49.820
our specific moments when I'm talking to people,

110
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:54.821
I'm going for a specific moments that have some kind of deep emotional resonance

111
00:06:55.070 --> 00:07:00.070
or where something very live and unexpected has happened or where,

112
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.770
um,

113
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:05.770
there is just a very authentic emotion has been expressed.

114
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:07.970
And those are the moments that I go for.

115
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:11.840
It's almost sort of like if I'm talking to somebody about whatever,
I don't know,

116
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.050
just to borrow an example from my planet,
money days,
bond prices,

117
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.200
what I don't want is somebody talking about bond prices.

118
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.910
I want somebody expressing some sort of emotion about it,
if that's possible.

119
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.410
Uh,
you know,
because I can do all the nuts and bolts,
uh,
you know,

120
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.630
sort of information transfer.

121
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.090
And so what you're looking for in your interview subjects,
it's something,

122
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.900
something that,
that you can't provide yourself,
some unique perspective.

123
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.210
The other thing that you're going for.
The other thing.

124
00:07:38.211 --> 00:07:42.500
So that's one whole category of good tape is sort of like emotionally resonant,

125
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.551
uh,
you know,

126
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:47.060
emotionally authentic or something where something interesting or unexpected has

127
00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:48.530
happened sort of in the moment.

128
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.300
The other category is somebody just telling you a really good yarn,

129
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.430
like a really good narrative.

130
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.560
And so that's the other thing that we look for is sort of like,
um,

131
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.670
sort of at this American life.
We had a term for this,

132
00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:05.940
we just call it an anecdote,
but what we really meant was a little story.
Um,

133
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:10.370
and so like,
like just for an example,

134
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.430
if I start to talk to you and I said,
you know,
Tim,

135
00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:16.430
this morning I was leaving my house,
I was walked out the door and I was like,

136
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:21.260
I looked up in the sky and I saw something that I couldn't believe.

137
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.610
Like you want to hear what I said next?
Right,
right.

138
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.810
It's very unfulfilling story has,
so that's the story.

139
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.820
Like we are hardwired to be like a seat,

140
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:34.970
one sequence of action,

141
00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:37.790
another sequence of action and it's going to build towards something.

142
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:41.000
We want to hear what it's building toward.
And if I say to you,

143
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.700
I saw something I couldn't believe a cloud,
you'd be like,

144
00:08:43.701 --> 00:08:46.850
that's a boring ass story.
But if I said,
you know,
a Ufo,
then you're like,
oh,

145
00:08:46.851 --> 00:08:51.050
that's an interesting story.
So,
so,
but,
but,
but the,

146
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.280
the mechanics of it,

147
00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:54.440
the fact that it's a story and it has a beginning and sort of,

148
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.550
and it like a narrative progression and sort of,
you know,
sort of rising action.

149
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.650
Human beings I think are sort of hardwired to want to pay attention to that.

150
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.030
That's,
that's what we've been telling each other for,
you know,
40,000 years.

151
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.530
And so,
um,

152
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.130
so those are the other things you're going for is like people telling you
stories

153
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.850
<v 0>and the,
the process,
I'm so fascinated because I'm struggling with this myself,</v>

154
00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:21.500
the process of putting together an episode,

155
00:09:21.501 --> 00:09:26.000
especially when you currently have the,
the real time aspect of it,

156
00:09:26.001 --> 00:09:30.800
which seems to complicate matters tremendously.
Uh,
I,
if,

157
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.770
how many people do you currently have working,

158
00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:38.300
working on each episode of let's just say startup and what are their roles?

159
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.350
<v 3>Yeah,
I mean,
so that's the thing about this stuff is that it's like,</v>

160
00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.890
it's so much more time consuming then,
um,

161
00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.100
then then the other sort of main kind of podcasts which is out there,

162
00:09:48.101 --> 00:09:50.260
which is a straight interview podcasts like which we're doing,

163
00:09:50.261 --> 00:09:53.500
which is w which are also like all these elements can be possible and those

164
00:09:53.501 --> 00:09:56.290
kinds of podcasts as well.
And so what we're doing is sort of,

165
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.240
so like I go back and forth,
like,

166
00:09:58.241 --> 00:10:03.241
is this insane to be spending on this time producing 20 minutes of one kind of

167
00:10:03.401 --> 00:10:06.340
podcast when another kind of podcasts you could produce in 20 minutes.

168
00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.890
You know what I mean?
Uh,
and uh,

169
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.610
and so what we have is we have,
um,

170
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.860
so right now on startup,

171
00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.240
it's just me and my producer Kaitlin,

172
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.590
and then another employee,
Lisa,
who's,
um,

173
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.350
who's going to be producing the second season of startup.

174
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.630
That's not quite enough.
Um,
startup comes out every two weeks.

175
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.970
So we can bear.
And,

176
00:10:32.971 --> 00:10:36.970
and because I've been doing this for so long and I've internalized so much of

177
00:10:36.971 --> 00:10:40.300
this stuff,
like I'm a probably more productive at it than than somebody else.

178
00:10:40.301 --> 00:10:43.960
But so we can bear,
we're not quite getting by with that,

179
00:10:43.961 --> 00:10:46.120
but we would definitely need,
you know,
we need some more.

180
00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.190
We need another body or two for sure.

181
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:54.270
<v 0>And aside from the producer,
you also have an engineer who does yes.</v>

182
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.620
Post cleanup and that type of thing?

183
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.240
<v 3>Yes.
All right.
So we had,
yeah.
So,</v>

184
00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.680
so on staff is me and Caitlin,
our producer and,

185
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:02.543
and Lisa.

186
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.530
And then we also have other people on staff who can help with the edit,

187
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:11.880
which is a really,
really important part of it.
So,
um,
so there's other people.

188
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:15.660
So then we'll usually have one or two other people sitting in to do the edit.

189
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:17.580
So where I sit around and do the table read,

190
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.190
they'll give me notes and sort of say,
this part was slow,
this part wasn't.

191
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.640
So that's a really important thing.
And then we,
and then we,
uh,

192
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.270
we also outsource our transcripts,
so we have people logging all that tape.

193
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.550
So that it's easier to go through.
Um,

194
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.700
so we have people providing transcripts of the tape,
uh,

195
00:11:32.701 --> 00:11:37.320
and then we have an engineer who mixes the episode,
which is,
you know,

196
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.010
basically everything from doing all sorts of things that I don't understand,

197
00:11:41.011 --> 00:11:43.230
like putting compression on it and making it sound really good,

198
00:11:43.231 --> 00:11:47.100
but also just sort of like putting it all together,
making it sound good,

199
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.160
making the levels right,
all that stuff.
Got It.

200
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:54.850
<v 0>And the one thing that struck me about reply all the other show that I've been</v>

201
00:11:54.851 --> 00:11:57.550
listening to from,
from gimlet media is,

202
00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:02.580
was listening to the launch of that and how the host's decided to join forces

203
00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:05.110
with you.

204
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:09.970
And one of the things they mentioned was wanting you as an editor or having you

205
00:12:09.971 --> 00:12:14.500
run to them,
run to and from the two shows,
working with them as an editor,

206
00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:18.400
does that primarily mean that your,
uh,

207
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:23.170
working on the script and reviewing the transcripts or what,
what,
what is,

208
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:24.820
uh,
what are you doing as an editor?

209
00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:28.400
<v 3>Yeah,
I mean I think what I think of myself as,</v>

210
00:12:28.401 --> 00:12:31.040
and I think one of the reasons that I started this company,

211
00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.210
I think my primary skill,
like the probably if I had to say like,

212
00:12:35.211 --> 00:12:36.380
here's the thing that I am best at,

213
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.490
it is at being an editor and being an editor means,

214
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:45.020
um,
that you like.
And the way I think about it,

215
00:12:45.021 --> 00:12:46.070
it's sort of like from the beginning,

216
00:12:46.071 --> 00:12:51.071
it's basically being a collaborator with the hosts with a talent to getting,

217
00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:56.120
you know,
the best show that you can get.
Um,
and so I tried to,

218
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.170
so you know,

219
00:12:57.171 --> 00:13:01.280
like what that means is that when we have a weekly story meeting for reply all,

220
00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:03.170
where we'll sit around for,
you know,
we'll talk for two hours,

221
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.090
we talked for an hour about,
you know,

222
00:13:05.091 --> 00:13:08.840
what are the stories that they want to want to pursue and we'll think about

223
00:13:08.841 --> 00:13:11.610
interesting angles to go at that story with.
We'll decide if they're,

224
00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:15.140
if it's worth it or not.
And then we'll sort of plan like,
okay,

225
00:13:15.141 --> 00:13:16.160
who do we want to talk to?

226
00:13:16.161 --> 00:13:18.320
Who would be some interesting people to talk to in the story?

227
00:13:18.321 --> 00:13:21.950
What questions do we want to ask them?
Like the questions are really important.

228
00:13:21.951 --> 00:13:24.530
Like if you go out and you ask and you don't ask the right questions,

229
00:13:24.531 --> 00:13:26.870
you can come back with nothing.
You can come back with no good tape.

230
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.380
And so you have to sort of design your questions so that you're sort of giving

231
00:13:30.381 --> 00:13:34.190
yourself a higher chance than average of getting good tape.
Uh,

232
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.460
and then so we do all that.
And then when they do,

233
00:13:37.461 --> 00:13:39.550
when they come back and they write the script,
then I'll,

234
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.550
I'll go through the script with them.
And usually we do at least one pass,

235
00:13:43.551 --> 00:13:44.750
but sometimes too,

236
00:13:44.751 --> 00:13:49.000
and maybe even three passes depending on how tricky a story is,
um,

237
00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.460
where we'll really dive in deep and sort of get into the language and sort of

238
00:13:52.461 --> 00:13:56.240
say this,
you know,
you're saying this,
but it's not quite right.
And so it's just,

239
00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:00.200
it's,
I mean,
it's,
I think when people see it for the first time from the outside,

240
00:14:00.201 --> 00:14:04.310
it's like they can't believe how much,
how much actual work goes into,

241
00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:09.530
into the making of this stuff.
Um,
and I'm not sure,

242
00:14:09.531 --> 00:14:10.020
you know,

243
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.620
like one of the big questions is sort of like how much of that work is actually

244
00:14:12.621 --> 00:14:14.660
necessary,
where it can,
how much of that work is like,
are we,

245
00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.810
are we spinning our wheels?
Um,
but my,

246
00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.920
my contention has been that like,
to really like,
you know,

247
00:14:21.921 --> 00:14:24.170
if you look at the very top of the charts and Itunes,

248
00:14:24.171 --> 00:14:27.320
like a lot of those shows have that,

249
00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:31.910
that amount of labor embedded in the programs that they're putting out.
Like,

250
00:14:31.911 --> 00:14:35.570
I come from this American life,
which is where I learned all this stuff.
And like,

251
00:14:35.571 --> 00:14:36.404
you know,

252
00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.690
there's even more sort of editing and production work that goes into making

253
00:14:41.691 --> 00:14:46.410
those shows.
Uh,
and I know certainly cereal,
um,

254
00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:52.070
they were working on that for a year at least.
Um,
so,
so the,
so it,

255
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.870
you know,
so yeah.
So I,
so I think it's related,
but I'm not,
I'm not sure.

256
00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:00.610
<v 0>Oh,
it's massive.
I mean,
I was,</v>

257
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:04.870
I was blown away and not terribly surprised when I heard that serial had a team

258
00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:08.920
working on it for a year prior to the launch.

259
00:15:08.921 --> 00:15:10.090
Didn't surprise me at all.
I mean,

260
00:15:10.091 --> 00:15:14.530
as someone who's a very plotting writer himself didn't really surprise me.

261
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.370
Uh,
how did you,
how did you decide,
well,
actually before,

262
00:15:18.371 --> 00:15:20.320
before I jump away from the editing,

263
00:15:20.321 --> 00:15:24.430
what do you do as an editor differently from other people?

264
00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.493
<v 3>MMM,</v>

265
00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.020
<v 0>I think is,
you're,
you're clearly,
you're clearly very good at it.
I mean,</v>

266
00:15:29.021 --> 00:15:32.590
the output of the shows reflects that.
So the question is,
you know,

267
00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.010
maybe why aren't other people better editors or what do you do differently?

268
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.640
<v 3>Um,
I think,
I think there's a bunch of things.
Like I said,</v>

269
00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:45.620
at first I think I learned,
I think this American life was a real editing shop.

270
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.380
Uh,
and I think it was,
it's a pretty special place.
Um,

271
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:53.840
like in that IRA is really,

272
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:58.340
he's a really great editor,
but he's also very encouraging to people to sort of,

273
00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.700
um,
do their own thing.
Like it's his show,

274
00:16:01.701 --> 00:16:06.110
but he really encourages you to do your own thing within that show.
Um,

275
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.620
so every,
when I worked there,
every story that I thought I,

276
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:13.760
that I wanted to do that I could,
that I could sort of make a good case for,

277
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.950
I was able to do and I was able to write it myself.

278
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:19.910
So I think part of being a good editor is being sort of,

279
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:25.990
is wanting to encourage others to sort of like having that feeling that like if,

280
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.690
if we're working on this together,
I can take my ego,

281
00:16:29.691 --> 00:16:32.540
feels like I got some of the credit because I was in there from the beginning.

282
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:36.320
But you're also happy to share the credit with the person who's doing the story.

283
00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.500
Um,
so I think part of it is it goes back to that sort of,

284
00:16:39.501 --> 00:16:43.580
how do I think of myself as an editor,
uh,
and it,
and at this American life,

285
00:16:43.581 --> 00:16:46.610
it was like sort of an elevated job.
Um,

286
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:52.030
and then I think partly it's sort of like when I got to NPR I realize that like

287
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:57.410
the conception of the job was,
you know,
your report,
it goes out,

288
00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.410
they come back and then they play you a story and you're basically,

289
00:17:00.411 --> 00:17:03.500
it's not the time,
it's the time.
You know,
you make a couple suggestions.

290
00:17:03.501 --> 00:17:05.120
I didn't understand this part.
I didn't understand that part.

291
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.120
But you're not like thinking big about like,

292
00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:11.630
well what's the idea that we're trying to go towards with this story?

293
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.670
What's the new thing we're trying to say?

294
00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:19.010
And so I think partly also what makes a good editor is getting in there from the

295
00:17:19.011 --> 00:17:23.090
beginning and talking with the reporters about what are we trying to say?

296
00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.340
What you know,
what,
what's the interesting thing?

297
00:17:25.341 --> 00:17:27.440
What's the new thing that we're going for here?

298
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.020
If we're doing a story that's been done a lot like,
I don't know,

299
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.180
politics or homelessness or whatever it is,

300
00:17:32.181 --> 00:17:34.490
like something that you've heard about in the news a lot race.

301
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.910
Like how are we going to talk about it in a different way in a new subway in a

302
00:17:37.911 --> 00:17:41.510
surprising way.
And a lot of like,
you know,
half the f you know,

303
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:47.390
a lot of the,
um,
work that makes a story good.

304
00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.820
It goes into the very beginning.
And I think that's a lot of editors

305
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.720
don't think about their jobs that way.
And I think that's,
that,
that's why it's a,

306
00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:59.300
and so I think that's,
that helps me,
you know,

307
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:02.250
if I'm in there from the beginning and sort of talking about it,
it's easier.

308
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:03.751
The other thing,

309
00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:08.220
one other thing that I think about about editing and just quickly is that like

310
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.750
one of the biggest jobs of the editor is just being paying attention to your own

311
00:18:12.751 --> 00:18:14.820
boredom.
Uh,
you know,

312
00:18:14.821 --> 00:18:17.790
I think people would get into people who get into journalism,

313
00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.390
get in because like I'm interested in the world and I have a natural curiosity

314
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:24.660
and I want to satisfy that curiosity.
But you know,

315
00:18:24.661 --> 00:18:27.690
you gotta you're still like,
you've got to keep,

316
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:31.650
keep your audience interested and,
and,
and the editor can help do that.

317
00:18:31.651 --> 00:18:33.280
Like the editor,
if you,

318
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.700
you have to be curious about the world that you also have to know,

319
00:18:35.701 --> 00:18:38.460
like if to have as a sense and you're listening to your boredom.

320
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:40.650
It's something that I had to learn to do,
but once I did,
it's,

321
00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:41.550
it's really helpful.

322
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:47.970
<v 0>What are the symptoms of boredom?
So I know that might sound funny,</v>

323
00:18:47.971 --> 00:18:50.160
but uh,
what are the things,

324
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:53.760
what are these symptoms of boredom that maybe you didn't listen to?
Uh,

325
00:18:53.761 --> 00:18:56.730
in the early days as much?
Well,

326
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:59.750
<v 3>thank you.
Tried to sort of like,
if there's some,</v>

327
00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.510
if somebody reads something that is like,
it's something that you like,

328
00:19:03.511 --> 00:19:04.191
that you work together,

329
00:19:04.191 --> 00:19:08.390
they're sitting across the table from you and they read something that doesn't

330
00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.990
it like maybe like sort of a boring sentence or they've come through a boring

331
00:19:11.991 --> 00:19:14.300
thing or somebody is talking on tape and you don't quite know what they're

332
00:19:14.301 --> 00:19:18.410
saying or what the point is because you like the person and because you know

333
00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.440
you're a human being with decent team in emotions,
you'll,
you'll,

334
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:23.570
you'll be trying to think to like,
oh,
well,

335
00:19:23.571 --> 00:19:28.490
probably what the person was saying was this.
And so therefore,
you know,
though,

336
00:19:28.491 --> 00:19:33.020
that all make sense because you,
you make up for the reporter who,
who's,

337
00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.420
who's doing the read and it's,
and that's good.

338
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:41.150
That's decent human behavior to try to sort of meet somebody halfway and be

339
00:19:41.151 --> 00:19:43.840
understanding and empathetic to what they're saying.
Um,

340
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.700
but there's something that happens on the radio or on an audio when you're

341
00:19:46.701 --> 00:19:49.370
listening,
you don't listen or it doesn't do that.

342
00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.760
And so you have to train yourself out of that instinct to make up,

343
00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.480
to sort of fill in the gaps with what people are saying.
So one,

344
00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.710
one sign is just the sort of glimmer of like,
wait,
I'm confused here.

345
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:04.670
And it's a very,
very,
it's often at the back of your head you don't quite get it,

346
00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.430
but you didn't have to pay attention to it cause you sort of get what's going
on.

347
00:20:07.431 --> 00:20:10.070
But there's like some,
like there's some question in your mind is like,

348
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.800
is that the thing that's going on that I think is,
I think it is,
but it's a very,

349
00:20:12.801 --> 00:20:13.271
very slight,

350
00:20:13.271 --> 00:20:15.500
and you have to train that to sort of come to the beginning of your brain,

351
00:20:15.501 --> 00:20:18.260
to the head,
to the forefront of your brain.
That feeling,

352
00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.360
because the minute that feeling happens,
you know,

353
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:24.410
this is a spot that needs to be edited.
And the other part is just sort of like,

354
00:20:24.411 --> 00:20:28.500
you know,
you,
you,
you,
you know,
you find yourself drifting and in,

355
00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:32.840
in an edit and if you're drifting in and edit,
it's not,
it's not your fault,

356
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:37.250
it's theirs.
You know what I mean?
That's hard shot.
That's what you have to do.

357
00:20:37.251 --> 00:20:40.640
If I'm reading through and somebody who's listening to my story is drifting,

358
00:20:40.641 --> 00:20:43.250
that is my fault.
I have to keep you from drifting.

359
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.520
So and so at the same thing as if the shoe's on the other foot,

360
00:20:46.521 --> 00:20:50.320
then the thing is true.
If you're the editor,
your job is not to be engaged.

361
00:20:50.321 --> 00:20:53.530
They're job is to engage you and,
and so and so you,

362
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.630
so the minute you feel yourself drifting,

363
00:20:55.631 --> 00:20:57.190
that's another section that needs to be edited.

364
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.730
<v 0>No,
definitely.
And,
and uh,</v>

365
00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:05.860
you brought up things being unclear or hard to understand.

366
00:21:05.861 --> 00:21:09.430
When I found as a writer,
when I send things to my friends who are writers,

367
00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:10.810
to have them proof of chapter,

368
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.520
if I ask them to indicate if I first asked them to indicate what they like and

369
00:21:15.521 --> 00:21:18.850
dislike,
they might try to appease me or feel badly about hurting my feelings.

370
00:21:18.851 --> 00:21:22.570
So I always start with just point out what isn't clear.

371
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.530
Usually yields a much better result because it's,

372
00:21:26.531 --> 00:21:30.680
they don't feel like they're being as judgemental towards me personally.
Um,

373
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.360
I always find that a really helpful place to start.

374
00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:36.260
<v 3>And that's even more important in audio because audio is like,</v>

375
00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:39.740
you can't go back and reread audio.
You know what I mean?
Well,

376
00:21:39.741 --> 00:21:41.870
now in the age of on demand audio,
you can go back,
this is true.

377
00:21:41.871 --> 00:21:45.590
Or back in the radio days when there was literally no mechanism to go back and

378
00:21:45.591 --> 00:21:50.150
relisten.
But,
but,
and so what happens is the minute you're listening,

379
00:21:50.151 --> 00:21:52.280
if you're confused,
you're like,
wait,
what was that thing?

380
00:21:52.281 --> 00:21:54.440
And you've been trying and you try to figure it in your brain,

381
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:56.570
what was the thing that was confusing you?

382
00:21:56.571 --> 00:21:59.870
And then your brain has taken it's eye off the ball basically and had not

383
00:21:59.871 --> 00:22:01.640
listened to the next sentence,
right?
It's coming at it.

384
00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:05.270
And then it's like a train wreck.
Like you never catch up.
You know what I mean?

385
00:22:05.271 --> 00:22:10.271
So one moment of confusion can utterly destroy an otherwise beautiful story,

386
00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.650
you know?
And so you have to be on,
you have to be on,
you know,

387
00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:16.340
a special garden about that.
And in audio,
I think particularly

388
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.210
<v 0>what,
uh,
what does a producer do?
So this,
this has come up quite a bit.</v>

389
00:22:22.211 --> 00:22:27.040
You mentioned you have a producer,
a for instance.
What,
what does the,
what does,

390
00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:30.700
uh,
what does for startup in particular,
what does the producer do?

391
00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:31.520
What is their job?

392
00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.750
<v 3>I know it's one of those jobs.
It's the one whose words like manager,</v>

393
00:22:33.751 --> 00:22:38.570
which is like,
wait,
what with a manager?
Uh,
yeah.
Uh,

394
00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:43.440
um,
so a producer I think has also has many meanings,
but in my case,

395
00:22:43.441 --> 00:22:47.280
what a producer does.
Uh,
so my producer,
um,

396
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.680
helps me think through the interviews I'm going to do.

397
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:57.060
Um,
often we'll listen back through the tape,

398
00:22:57.061 --> 00:23:01.870
transcribed the tape sometimes or make sure that it's transcribed.
She will pull,

399
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:06.000
pull the interesting pieces of tape,
you know,
usually we'll consult about it,

400
00:23:06.001 --> 00:23:10.980
but then she'll go and actually produce us a session in the editing software

401
00:23:10.981 --> 00:23:13.830
that we use that has the polls that we want.

402
00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:19.230
She'll also think through like how to structure each episode,
um,

403
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:24.030
and all sorts of other things.
Like when,
like when I was at this American life,

404
00:23:24.031 --> 00:23:27.720
I was,
my job was producer.
Um,
that was what it was called.

405
00:23:27.721 --> 00:23:32.250
[inaudible] and you basically help build the story with the reporter.

406
00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:32.911
You know,

407
00:23:32.911 --> 00:23:37.560
you're really sort of like a partner in the creation of the story and the

408
00:23:37.561 --> 00:23:42.340
reporter has voices doing it.
And the reporters often sort of like writing and,

409
00:23:42.341 --> 00:23:42.581
and,

410
00:23:42.581 --> 00:23:46.430
and in some cases finalizing the writing in some cases really doing most of the

411
00:23:46.431 --> 00:23:48.990
writing.
But really you're a team.
And,

412
00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:53.870
and structuring the story is so important again in audio especially I think just

413
00:23:53.871 --> 00:23:56.580
because you can get so confused easily.
So,
so,

414
00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.080
so generally what the producers are in the audio world are,

415
00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:05.360
are there experts that sort of structuring the story,
like how do you,
what's,

416
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:09.470
how does the story begin and what are the emotional moments that were leading to

417
00:24:09.471 --> 00:24:13.070
and how do we contextualize those moments with script?
Um,

418
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:14.960
so often when I was a curious at this American life,

419
00:24:14.961 --> 00:24:18.380
we'd be working with writers who are really good writers who had not done that

420
00:24:18.381 --> 00:24:19.214
much audio.

421
00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.970
And often what I would do is I would cut the tape and then I would have,

422
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:27.020
and then we would meet and I would just sort of talk them through like,

423
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.540
so we would have gone out and done a bunch of interviews.

424
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:32.300
I would cut down to the moments that we were going to use and then we'd get back

425
00:24:32.301 --> 00:24:34.940
in the room and I would tell them like,
okay,

426
00:24:34.941 --> 00:24:37.340
here's how I think you can start and here's what I think you want to say to

427
00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:38.001
start it up.

428
00:24:38.001 --> 00:24:40.070
And then we're going to go to this piece of tape and this is the first piece of

429
00:24:40.071 --> 00:24:42.650
tape we're going to use.
And it introduces this character in the story.

430
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.860
And then from there you're going to want to write something like this.

431
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:49.280
And sometimes I would have dummy language in there and I would basically provide

432
00:24:49.281 --> 00:24:52.640
a roadmap for the,
for the reporter or the writer,

433
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.900
they would sort of lead through the tape and get to a finished piece.

434
00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.410
So that's,
that's,
that's got it.
That's what they do.
Yeah.

435
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:03.680
<v 0>And into ATS at gimlet media,</v>

436
00:25:03.681 --> 00:25:06.890
which is of course a much smaller operation than this American life who's

437
00:25:06.891 --> 00:25:10.070
handling releases and all that kind of stuff.

438
00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.710
<v 3>Yeah,
the producer would be doing that as well.
Um,
so the,
the,
yeah,
so the,</v>

439
00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:18.340
so producer is sort of like do sort of the high level conceptual structuring

440
00:25:18.341 --> 00:25:22.330
stuff and then they also sort of like transcribed Cape and they also sort of

441
00:25:22.331 --> 00:25:25.450
like handle all the details and make sure that the plane tickets are purchased

442
00:25:25.451 --> 00:25:27.020
and you know,
you know,

443
00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:30.460
various people have been set up and booked into various studios and all that

444
00:25:30.461 --> 00:25:31.294
sort of stuff

445
00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.900
<v 0>with,
with,
uh,
I know we're getting into some nitty gritty stuff,</v>

446
00:25:34.901 --> 00:25:37.510
but I'm so fascinated by it.
And then we're going to go kind of broader picture.

447
00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:40.150
The what type of editing software do you use?

448
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:42.390
<v 3>Uh,
uh,
pro tools,</v>

449
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:47.590
<v 0>protools and uh,
with,</v>

450
00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:51.130
with reply all for instance,
which is,
is perhaps a little more,

451
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.920
can be planned a little more in advance.

452
00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:58.950
How from the initial idea pitch meeting to the finished episode,

453
00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:04.110
How long does that currently take and how far out have you planned already?

454
00:26:04.541 --> 00:26:07.150
Not necessarily gathering all the Info and doing the interviews,

455
00:26:07.151 --> 00:26:09.580
but decided on the subject matter for episodes.

456
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:15.540
<v 3>Well,
I mean we not as far as planned out as we want to be.
Um,
you know,</v>

457
00:26:15.541 --> 00:26:17.550
we have,
we have,
we're,

458
00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:23.240
we have things on the calendar going out maybe a month or month and a half.

459
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:29.590
Um,
but you know,
it's always a race every week to get everything done,
uh,

460
00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:34.350
so as especially as you'll hear in the next episode of startup.
Uh,
but,
uh,

461
00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:40.100
but,
um,
but,
uh,
and,
and,

462
00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:43.740
and so some of those are just ideas.
Some of those are like,
you know,

463
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:46.740
there's all the,
all the tape is in and it's been edited and we,

464
00:26:46.741 --> 00:26:51.330
and we just have to sort of wrangle it into shape.
Um,
so,

465
00:26:51.331 --> 00:26:55.800
uh,
yeah,
so,
but I would say that we don't have anything we've never had.

466
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:59.850
Our goal is to sort of get to a point where we can have everything where we can

467
00:26:59.851 --> 00:27:02.550
have,
we can be a week ahead.
Like,

468
00:27:02.551 --> 00:27:07.410
we can have next week's episode in the can this week,
like done,
recorded the ads,

469
00:27:07.411 --> 00:27:10.830
put in everything done,
mixed the music in.

470
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:15.390
And I would say we're several months away from that goal.

471
00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.990
Like we just,
we just need to get better at it and build that muscle.

472
00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:24.260
<v 0>What tools,
what tools do you guys currently use?
I,
I of course take,</v>

473
00:27:24.261 --> 00:27:27.560
I'm an avid sort of hyper graphic note taker.

474
00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.520
I heard Chartbeat mentioned in one of the episodes.
Uh,

475
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:35.420
what type of tools do you guys use for organizing all this stuff besides

476
00:27:35.421 --> 00:27:40.070
protools?
What are the,
the,
you know,
the,
the software or the,
the,

477
00:27:40.071 --> 00:27:42.530
the whiteboard.
I mean,
what,
what do you guys use?

478
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:47.060
<v 3>We used actual whiteboards.
Um,
we use,
we have like little white boards,</v>

479
00:27:47.061 --> 00:27:48.330
the float around the office that have the,

480
00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:53.120
sort of like the checklist of everything that needs to be done every episode.
Uh,

481
00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.240
you know,
sort of like,
just sort of like this,
the basic stuff that you forget,

482
00:27:56.241 --> 00:28:00.310
like,
you know,
did we,
did we get the ad copy correct and we'd get the,
um,

483
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.770
did we email all the people that we write the copy for the web,
that we,

484
00:28:03.771 --> 00:28:06.190
all that stuff,
you know,
um,

485
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:08.870
did we get the list of songs that we're using in the episodes that we can put

486
00:28:08.871 --> 00:28:12.380
them on the website?
Um,
and then,
um,

487
00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:17.950
and then we use,
and then we co we have a lot of,
we do a lot of collaborations.

488
00:28:17.951 --> 00:28:20.390
So the w most of the stuff that we write,

489
00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.290
our scripts are all written in a Google doc.
Um,

490
00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:27.450
and we have multiple people editing through the Google Doc.
Um,

491
00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:32.360
that really changed my world when that came around.
Um,
uh,

492
00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:35.240
and that's fantastic.
Uh,
you know,
um,

493
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:38.360
we use slack at the office like the younger guys do.

494
00:28:38.361 --> 00:28:42.830
I don't really know how to use it really.
Um,
uh,
we,

495
00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:47.690
we,
uh,
um,
but there's,
I think those are the main ones.
Like the Google,

496
00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.990
Google docs are sort of the main thing that we use to sort of collaborate right

497
00:28:50.991 --> 00:28:55.260
on.
Um,
and then,
and then actual light boards.
Um,

498
00:28:55.261 --> 00:28:57.370
we've scheduled stuff through Google calendar.
Awesome.

499
00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:01.460
<v 0>Do you use any kind of project management software,</v>

500
00:29:01.461 --> 00:29:04.190
like a base camp or a sauna or Trello or anything like that?

501
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:08.720
<v 3>I have,
I have worked on projects where I've used base camp before.
Um,</v>

502
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:10.900
like when we did our website design,

503
00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:15.590
we use base camp with the design team that was designing the website and that

504
00:29:15.591 --> 00:29:19.640
was really useful.
Like I find base camp too useful for like distributed teams.

505
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:20.803
Um,

506
00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:25.160
when I was at planet money we did this big sort of crazy project where we

507
00:29:25.161 --> 00:29:26.930
followed a tee shirt around the world as a cup made.

508
00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:31.550
And we did this sort of elaborate web interactive website,

509
00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.430
uh,
about the project where we had all these videos and stuff like that.

510
00:29:34.431 --> 00:29:36.500
And that was like a couple of different teams when in New York,

511
00:29:36.501 --> 00:29:39.440
one in DC and we use base camp for that project as well.

512
00:29:39.441 --> 00:29:43.420
And that was really helpful.
Um,
on a day to day basis.
I don't,
I don't,

513
00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.730
I don't use it as much.
Uh,
just cause you know,

514
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.690
it's pretty simple what we're doing.
The bulk of our work is sort of like,

515
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:54.370
you know,
managing,
you know,
wrangling tape and writing scripts.

516
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.960
That's sort of like the day to day.
That's what I'm doing every day is,

517
00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.670
is that essentially,
what do you,

518
00:30:00.671 --> 00:30:05.230
what do you guys currently use for capturing tape in the field?
We use,
um,

519
00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:09.750
in terms of equipment,
we use flash card recorders and uh,
and you know,
Nice,

520
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.580
nice microphones.
Uh,
we use,
um,
we use these tasks Cam,
uh,

521
00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:19.030
task cam recorders.
Um,
some of us use Sony's,
but they're just,

522
00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:23.290
they're pretty nice,
you know,
broadcast quality,
you know,
sort of,
uh,

523
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:27.020
they're not the nicest,
but the pretty nice ones.
And then we have a nice night.

524
00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.140
<v 0>No,
what type of,
uh,
if,
if you know,
offhand and I,</v>

525
00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:36.430
I'm involved with creative live,
so I managed to grab a pdf of your,

526
00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:40.120
some of your gear.
I don't know if it's changed since then,
but I'm a,

527
00:30:40.121 --> 00:30:43.780
I'm an advisor for creative live.
And by the way,
it's,
I,
I'm going to,

528
00:30:43.781 --> 00:30:45.760
I'll link to it in the show notes for everyone,
but the,

529
00:30:45.761 --> 00:30:49.700
I've been very impressed with the class.
So what,
we'll come back to that,

530
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:54.400
but it's just,
it was just the,
the masterclass in asking questions.

531
00:30:54.401 --> 00:30:56.020
So of of course I have performance anxiety

532
00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:56.893
<v 3>right now.</v>

533
00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.790
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

534
00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:06.901
<v 0>Well that's why,</v>

535
00:31:06.901 --> 00:31:09.780
that's why I decided to swing completely the opposite direction and ask very

536
00:31:09.781 --> 00:31:11.120
boring hyper-specific

537
00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:16.410
<v 3>no questions.
I mean the concrete details,
that's another one that people forget.</v>

538
00:31:16.411 --> 00:31:17.640
Like people go too broad.

539
00:31:17.641 --> 00:31:21.840
And I think what's often interesting is the nuts and bolts of people's process.

540
00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:24.840
So these like,
I must,
you know,

541
00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.560
like I think often I'll ask these exact kind of questions like sort of like on a

542
00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.980
day to day basis.
Like what are you,
when are you actually doing?
Um,

543
00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:36.130
like I like I did,
yeah,
I did the Squarespace.
I do these ads,
right.
And um,

544
00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:39.750
where I just interviewed somebody in the company about what their job is like

545
00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.720
and the company that's,
you know,
that's sponsoring us.

546
00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:46.050
I guess we're going to do one of these ads later.
But,
but my,
my,

547
00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:50.730
my uh,
goal there is just to try to find one sort of like,

548
00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:54.060
I call it like a,
um,
like a vivid moment,

549
00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:57.900
a moment where it sort of like,
you know,
like if it's a,

550
00:31:57.901 --> 00:31:59.900
one time I found myself talking to a treasurer of,

551
00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:03.120
of one company and I was like talking and like that wasn't getting very much

552
00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:04.800
vivid stuff.
I was like sort of like,

553
00:32:04.801 --> 00:32:07.100
what's it like to be a treasurer and wasn't getting very much.

554
00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:09.870
And finally I was like,
dude,
what's the,
you know,
do,

555
00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:13.320
do you actually sign your name on the checks?
And he was like,

556
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:15.960
we have an auto center but sometimes actually sign the checks.

557
00:32:15.961 --> 00:32:18.570
And then we got into this whole discussion of sort of where he sits,

558
00:32:18.571 --> 00:32:21.420
when he signs the checks and how he signs them and how much time,

559
00:32:21.421 --> 00:32:24.210
how long it takes and does he block it off in his calendar.

560
00:32:24.211 --> 00:32:27.630
And that was like by far the best moment of the interview because it felt all of

561
00:32:27.631 --> 00:32:30.420
a sudden you were like,
you actually,
it felt real,
you know,

562
00:32:30.421 --> 00:32:33.360
and you've got a real sense of sort of like the details of this guy's life.

563
00:32:33.361 --> 00:32:36.210
So I'm all for these kinds of,
these kinds of concrete questions.

564
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:41.000
<v 0>Okay.
Well I'm going to follow on with,
with some digging then the,</v>

565
00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:42.710
I noticed in the list of equipment,
and again,

566
00:32:42.711 --> 00:32:45.710
I'll link to all of this in the show notes for people,
the,

567
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.840
that you have a boom mic.
And I have for instance,
a zoom recorder,

568
00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:54.380
a h four n and I have a,
another model.
It's a two two follow up questions.

569
00:32:54.381 --> 00:32:58.280
Is there any reason you chose the tascam over zoom or anything else?

570
00:32:58.281 --> 00:33:01.280
And then the second is what do you use the boom for?
Because I'm just,

571
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:06.200
when I'm sitting down with someone,
I find the,
these,
these handheld,
you know,

572
00:33:06.201 --> 00:33:10.970
h the zoom recorders for instance,
uh,
work quite well by themselves.

573
00:33:10.971 --> 00:33:15.050
They work even better with a lav mic or something like that or just a handheld

574
00:33:15.051 --> 00:33:19.010
stage stage.
Mike connected with XLRs.
What do you use the boom mic for?

575
00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.900
<v 3>I mean I can give you a lot of bs about it,
but the truth is I don't,</v>

576
00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:24.820
it's like habit basically.

577
00:33:24.821 --> 00:33:28.240
Like these are the microphones that we started using it,
this American life.

578
00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:30.310
When I first got there,
I didn't know anything about audio.

579
00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:33.010
I am not a super technical Lee.

580
00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.150
Like I know a lot about like the story structure.
I don't know.
I don't know.

581
00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:41.470
I know exactly what I need to know about a recording equipment.

582
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:46.240
Um,
I'm not super tech savvy that way.
And so,
um,

583
00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:48.610
so partly it's just sort of like that's the,

584
00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:52.670
those are the ones we use and I got used to them and I can hear this ad like

585
00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:55.210
right now I understand like when I'm out in the field I know exactly what I

586
00:33:55.211 --> 00:33:58.150
needed to do with that particular Mike to get the exact sound that I want to get

587
00:33:58.151 --> 00:34:01.180
and I don't have to like mess around with something new.
Um,

588
00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.900
the one thing that I will say that I think the reason,

589
00:34:04.901 --> 00:34:06.310
so the task cam that was just,

590
00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:09.910
that was the recommendation that I read on a website and I bought it and it's

591
00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:12.550
worked for me,
although there are certain things that I don't love about it,
so,

592
00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:17.710
um,
so I feel like you're,
you're fine.
Whatever works for you,
you're fine.

593
00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:21.330
Fine with their,
um,
the,
uh,

594
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:26.320
the mic is more important than the recorder.
Um,
and,
and my,

595
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:29.350
so that was,
so part of it is just sort of habit part of it.

596
00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.660
The real part I guess is,
is that

597
00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:36.100
as long as it's a directional mic,
um,

598
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:40.060
what I'm trying to do often is get intimate sounding,

599
00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:45.910
you know,
conversations.
And so if you have an omnidirectional mic,

600
00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.130
uh,
which is the mix,

601
00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.970
the Mike's Recording pattern is picking up from all around the whole field of,

602
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:56.680
you know,
where you're recording,
you know,
just,
you,
you,

603
00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.720
you just have to be,

604
00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:01.060
you have to worry a little bit more about placement and you just,

605
00:35:01.061 --> 00:35:05.120
you sometimes don't get,
it doesn't feel like they're as present.
Um,

606
00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:09.340
whereas if you're using one of these,
um,
sort of unidirectional boom mikes,

607
00:35:09.341 --> 00:35:13.570
like the one I use,
it's really weird.
Like when you point it at somebody,

608
00:35:13.571 --> 00:35:14.890
you can hear them and when you pointed away,

609
00:35:14.891 --> 00:35:16.000
you really don't hear them very well.

610
00:35:16.001 --> 00:35:17.830
It really drowns out all the surrounding sound.

611
00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:21.700
And so what that means is you get this pretty nice,
very,
very intimate sound.

612
00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:25.570
And then if you,
and then if you're in a,
in a place where life,

613
00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.660
lots of other stuff that's happening around and you want to document the fact

614
00:35:28.661 --> 00:35:31.450
that you're out in the field and there's a rodeo going on behind you or
whatever,

615
00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:33.280
you can just,
when you're done with the interview,

616
00:35:33.281 --> 00:35:37.740
you just point the Mike at the Rodeo and get that ambiance and then you can just

617
00:35:37.741 --> 00:35:41.910
use it as an ambiance bed.
Um,
so,
so I like,

618
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.990
so I like the intimacy that you get with the,
with a,
with a nice tight boom mic.

619
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:49.300
<v 0>What?
No,
that makes perfect sense.
Uh,</v>

620
00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:52.870
what numbers do you check on a daily or weekly basis?

621
00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:56.680
And not to beat a dead horse,
but this,
do you guys use chirpy?

622
00:35:56.681 --> 00:35:58.570
Did you end up using that?
And what other,

623
00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:03.880
what other numbers besides just straight forward kind of revenue numbers for

624
00:36:03.881 --> 00:36:08.140
sponsors will kind of stuff do you guys check?
I mean,
if anything,

625
00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.340
<v 3>I again,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,</v>

626
00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:16.330
I was obsessive Lee checking our soundcloud numbers because we hosted on

627
00:36:18.021 --> 00:36:21.080
soundcloud and so I could see,

628
00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:25.040
so and soundcloud feeds or iTunes.
So every time somebody,
any,

629
00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:28.940
anytime somebody who subscribed to start up,
it downloads to their phone,

630
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:34.010
that registers as a play on soundcloud.
So soundcloud was documenting,

631
00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.740
was sort of capturing both the,
the people who are listening,

632
00:36:36.741 --> 00:36:39.080
streaming it through the web or through our website or whatever,

633
00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.560
and the people who are downloading it onto their phones through iTunes or some

634
00:36:42.561 --> 00:36:46.370
other pod catcher.
So it was a one stop shop for our,
for our,

635
00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:50.690
for our listening numbers basically.
Um,
and so I would check that.

636
00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:55.940
Um,
and that was pretty much everything that I checked.
Uh,
I didn't,
you know,

637
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:57.870
I know PJ and Alex,
the host,

638
00:36:57.871 --> 00:37:02.180
the reply all are much more tech savvy,

639
00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:06.290
uh,
and much more,
you know,
sort of aware of what's going on.

640
00:37:06.291 --> 00:37:08.570
And so every once in a while I'll ask them sort of like,

641
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:12.470
what are they looking at?
And they look at Chartbeat a lot.
Um,
but,
but we haven't,

642
00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.150
I don't look at that that much.

643
00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:20.220
<v 0>Got It.
So I want to rewind the clock a little bit and just,
uh,</v>

644
00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:20.960
I'm looking at,

645
00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:25.170
I'm looking at your bio and it says you've worked as a social worker,
a caterer,

646
00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:29.840
eighth grade science teacher,
and a graduate level journalism professor.
Uh,

647
00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:32.390
tell me the story of how you got to radio.

648
00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:37.600
<v 3>Uh,
yeah,
the story,
I guess the story starts.
I was in,</v>

649
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:42.430
I was in,
um,
I was a teacher.

650
00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.760
I taught eighth grade science.
Um,

651
00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:50.830
and I was,
I did that for four years and I,
this was in Chicago.

652
00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:54.650
How old were you?
How old were you at the time?
Basically right at,

653
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:59.440
around what time was,
this was in my mid to late twenties.
So starting at like,

654
00:37:59.441 --> 00:38:03.970
maybe like 24 to the time I was 28 or something like that,
28,
29,

655
00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:08.530
I was teacher and um,
and I had,

656
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:14.320
um,
basically it starts like,
I'd always been interested in this kind of,

657
00:38:14.321 --> 00:38:18.070
I guess what you'd call long form narrative nonfiction.

658
00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:23.440
You know,
like I had read,
uh,
you know,

659
00:38:23.441 --> 00:38:26.140
a couple of magazines since the time I was in high school.

660
00:38:26.141 --> 00:38:29.530
Like I liked the New Yorker magazine and I liked Harper's magazine and,

661
00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:32.800
and I liked these kind of,
and I would read these books of like,
you know,

662
00:38:32.801 --> 00:38:36.700
sort of like,
um,
you know,
Joseph Mitchell,

663
00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:41.200
<v 2>who's the sort of famous olds,
you know,
nonfiction writer.
And I would read,</v>

664
00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:44.800
you know,
he be white and stuff like that.
Uh,

665
00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:50.560
John Hershey,
you know,
the guy who wrote Hiroshima.
So,
um,

666
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:56.170
I was at Hersey Hershey,
right.
Uh,
and,
uh,

667
00:38:56.290 --> 00:39:01.150
and so I was,
I was into that kind of stuff and then I would,

668
00:39:01.151 --> 00:39:05.170
um,
but I never,
for some reason,
and I was pretty,

669
00:39:05.171 --> 00:39:07.990
I was pretty good student and I like,
you know,
I did,
I did okay.

670
00:39:07.991 --> 00:39:12.370
But some of it never occurred to me that I could actually do that.
As for living,

671
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:16.960
I don't,
and I don't know why.
Like I really don't know why I thought,
um,

672
00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.290
I just somehow thought that like,

673
00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:22.780
the people who did that where some sort of different world of people that like,

674
00:39:22.781 --> 00:39:26.920
I would never be able to access that world.
And like now it's ridiculous.

675
00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.210
Like the thought that like,
you know,

676
00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.110
an upper middle class Jewish kid could ever make it in the media world.

677
00:39:32.111 --> 00:39:33.550
Like what,
you know,
of course,

678
00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:39.940
how could that happen?
I don't know why it was so,
uh,

679
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.190
I don't know why I was,
so,

680
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:46.060
I think it was just like a profound lack of,

681
00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:50.230
I didn't know anybody who'd ever done that.
I grew up in Cincinnati,
Ohio,

682
00:39:50.231 --> 00:39:54.010
which was like,
you know,
not,
not super provincial,
but just,
you know,

683
00:39:54.011 --> 00:39:58.450
certainly not a media capital.
Uh,
and so,
you know,

684
00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:02.650
people who have succeeded became doctors and lawyers and that was sort of it.

685
00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:07.730
Um,
so,
so anyway,
so then,
but then I started dating a,
uh,
uh,

686
00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:12.520
a girl from New York,
uh,
when I was in Chicago.
And,
um,

687
00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:17.350
she,
that was more of where media happened and she knew people who are actually

688
00:40:17.351 --> 00:40:18.750
getting jobs at magazines.
And I was like,
oh,

689
00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:22.360
getting a job at a magazine is actual thing.
And then we dated for awhile.

690
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.770
We did it for like four or five years.
And then,
um,

691
00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:26.890
she eventually broke up with me,

692
00:40:26.891 --> 00:40:29.470
which was like one of the more profound experiences of my life.

693
00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:34.000
And that was really what kicked me in the ass and sort of was like,

694
00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.540
that happened.
Right.
You know,
in my late twenties.
And that was when I was like,

695
00:40:37.541 --> 00:40:41.440
okay,
well if,
if you're going to like,
I don't know what you're,
you know,

696
00:40:41.441 --> 00:40:44.320
I was telling myself like,
it was basically spite.

697
00:40:44.321 --> 00:40:48.880
Like I was worried her plan was to go back to New York and go to film school and

698
00:40:48.881 --> 00:40:49.511
I was just like,

699
00:40:49.511 --> 00:40:53.590
terrified that she was going to become a famous director and I was going to be

700
00:40:53.591 --> 00:40:57.660
sitting around supervising recess.
And so,

701
00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:02.770
and so it was really that,
that was like,
okay,
you gotta,
you gotta try to,

702
00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:06.640
you know,
this has been this dream that you haven't really admitted to yourself,

703
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:10.000
so you should just try to do it.
So,
um,

704
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:15.070
so I started trying to freelance and I had an internship at Harper's magazine

705
00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:19.270
that I,
that I successfully applied to and got over the summer in between,

706
00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:23.410
in between one of those years when I was teaching.
And,
uh,

707
00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:28.280
and then eventually through Harper's I met,
I got to,

708
00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:31.330
I got a job as the administrative assistant at this American life,

709
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.450
which was the public radio program and podcast.
It was just starting,

710
00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:40.050
this is back in the,
like,
I guess back in [inaudible] 97,
uh,

711
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.880
October of [inaudible] 97 when I got that internship and when I got the,
uh,

712
00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:48.500
administrative assistant assistant job,
um,
and it,
it had been the air on the air,

713
00:41:48.501 --> 00:41:52.850
I think two years at that point and had become sort of,
you know,

714
00:41:52.851 --> 00:41:56.570
had already made a name for itself but wasn't,
uh,
you know,
the,

715
00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:02.060
you know,
beast that had that.
It is today,
uh,

716
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:06.130
the podcast king maker that it is today.
Um,
so,
uh,

717
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:10.690
so that's where,
that's,
that's that.
And that got me started,
you know,
I,

718
00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:13.550
so I was an administrative assistant.
I sort of learned on the job.

719
00:42:13.551 --> 00:42:17.600
It was like four of us back then.
It was IRA,
three producers and me.
Um,

720
00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:22.350
and uh,
what a perfect,
perfect timing man.
What a great job.
Yeah,

721
00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:25.940
just the four of you.
That's amazing.
And I learned a lot on the job,

722
00:42:25.941 --> 00:42:28.470
but then I eventually,
but then,
you know,
so,

723
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:31.190
but I was the administrative assistant,
right?
I was like the one writing,

724
00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:31.401
you know,

725
00:42:31.401 --> 00:42:35.230
answering the mail and sort of like running to the post office and doing all

726
00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.650
this stuff that needed to be done.

727
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:41.390
And because we were so short staffed back then and because like,
you know,

728
00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:43.550
I really had no idea what he was getting himself into,

729
00:42:43.551 --> 00:42:48.551
like a weekly hour of documentary radio where like the standards are higher than

730
00:42:49.431 --> 00:42:52.970
anybody has ever had before.
Like he is a perfectionist,
you know,

731
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:57.410
and I learned a lot about the value of being a perfectionist from him.
Uh,

732
00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:02.000
so,
but like,
you know,
the fact that he was trying to produce that with,
you know,

733
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:05.600
three producers who didn't really know what they were doing.

734
00:43:05.601 --> 00:43:07.370
Cause then nobody knew what they were doing.
You know,
like he was,

735
00:43:07.371 --> 00:43:10.790
he was trying to invent it.
So it was all hands on deck.

736
00:43:10.791 --> 00:43:13.820
And so occasionally I would get to produce stuff or like help with the editorial

737
00:43:13.821 --> 00:43:15.560
side of things.
And so I learned on the job,

738
00:43:15.561 --> 00:43:18.110
but then there came a moment where I was like,
I produced this,

739
00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:22.010
I'd actually produced semi,
like,
not what I would call producing now,

740
00:43:22.011 --> 00:43:25.820
but I assisted in the creation of one of one of our big early shows,

741
00:43:25.821 --> 00:43:30.620
which was a hour long documentary about Harold Washington and,
uh,

742
00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:34.860
the first black mayor of Chicago.
And it was sort of a hit,
you know,
in the,

743
00:43:34.861 --> 00:43:37.730
in the early days.
And,
and I came in after it had been,
you know,

744
00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:41.540
just the bare to produce and I was working all kinds of crazy hours and I came

745
00:43:41.541 --> 00:43:44.060
in after it aired the day,
the Monday after it aired.

746
00:43:44.061 --> 00:43:47.660
And you fully expecting like,
okay,
now I've succeeded.

747
00:43:47.661 --> 00:43:51.400
I passed this test and now I'm going to be made up producer.
And I said,
I wanted,

748
00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.810
you know,
what would,
what did he think was he gonna make me produce it?

749
00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:57.400
And he was like,
no,
I can't.
I don't,
I don't have money to make you a producer.

750
00:43:57.401 --> 00:44:00.590
I don't have a position open and I need an administrative assistant.

751
00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:05.990
And I was like,
oh,
well if you ever did have money and the position open,

752
00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:08.690
would you hire me?
And he was like,
I don't know,

753
00:44:08.691 --> 00:44:11.750
probably not because you don't have the experience still that I need.
You know,

754
00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:14.570
there other people now who have that experience.
And it was like,
well,

755
00:44:14.571 --> 00:44:16.700
what do I need to get that experience?
And he said,
well,
I don't know.

756
00:44:16.701 --> 00:44:20.720
You probably should quit and start freelancing.
And I don't think he thought.

757
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.930
And now as a CEO of my own company,

758
00:44:23.931 --> 00:44:28.010
I have this experience all the time where I'll sort of think out loud and I

759
00:44:28.011 --> 00:44:32.130
don't realize that the people I'm talking to are like hanging on every word.

760
00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.850
I'm sure that will happen with him.
But to me,
I was like,
okay,

761
00:44:35.851 --> 00:44:38.010
well you've just given me the map of how I want to get my dream job,

762
00:44:38.011 --> 00:44:42.410
so I'm going to quit.
So,

763
00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:43.361
so I,

764
00:44:43.361 --> 00:44:47.730
I put in my notice and I arranged like a loan from my parents to help me live

765
00:44:47.731 --> 00:44:50.570
for the year,
uh,
like 10 grand.
I was like,
Oh,

766
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.950
if you give me 10 grand in lieu of graduate school,

767
00:44:52.951 --> 00:44:57.660
I will get to make it as a freelance writer.
Uh,
and,
and we,

768
00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:59.820
and I,
you know,
I,
I did,

769
00:44:59.821 --> 00:45:03.780
I just tried to freelance and I've got stories in magazines and newspapers and

770
00:45:03.781 --> 00:45:07.440
stuff like that,
and I continue to do radio.
And then a year and a half later,

771
00:45:07.441 --> 00:45:09.660
I'd sort of built a little freelance career for myself,

772
00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:10.920
which was going pretty well.

773
00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:13.440
And then there was finally an opening at this American life and things hadn't

774
00:45:13.441 --> 00:45:14.880
been going so well that I actually was like,
oh,

775
00:45:14.881 --> 00:45:17.670
I'm not going to apply for that because now I'm doing this other thing.

776
00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:22.470
And then finally somebody was like,
this was your dream job,
right?
And I was like,

777
00:45:22.471 --> 00:45:24.720
yeah,
I guess it was.
And then I applied and then immediately I was like,

778
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:28.590
I really want this job.
So I that I got it.
So that was,
that was,

779
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.633
that was how that happened.

780
00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:34.660
<v 0>Wow.
So when you were freelancing,
the,
how did the,</v>

781
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.890
let's see here,
the writing that you were doing,

782
00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:43.570
did you find the writing took off more so than the radio where they taking off

783
00:45:43.571 --> 00:45:47.500
in tandem?
Did the radio start to outpace the writing?
How did that,

784
00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.410
how did that go on during your year of freelancing?

785
00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:52.310
<v 2>Well,
one of the things that I learned at that,</v>

786
00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:57.370
one of the biggest lessons I learned is never ever return your key card.

787
00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:02.330
Uh,
so I still had my key card from Wbz,

788
00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:05.970
uh,
the radio station where I was working,

789
00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:13.720
<v 0>coming up,
why good radio doesn't necessarily apply to television.</v>

790
00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:18.460
The value of perfectionism and the good end bad habits that Alex picked up from

791
00:46:18.461 --> 00:46:22.840

813
00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:47.650
And now back to the show.

814
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.093
Did the

815
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:59.440
radio start to outpace the writing?
How did that,

816
00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:02.350
how did that go on during your year of freelancing?

817
00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:04.270
<v 2>Well,
one of the things that I learned at that,</v>

818
00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:09.450
one of the biggest lessons I learned is never ever return your key card.

819
00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:14.290
Uh,
so I still had my key card from Wbz,

820
00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:18.880
uh,
the radio station where I had been working.
And so I would,

821
00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.950
I could come in and I was,

822
00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:25.210
I had some freelance projects that I was still working on at that,

823
00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:28.440
at that station.
So they had hired me,
um,

824
00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:32.410
to help produce this like poetry series that we're doing and,
and I,

825
00:48:32.411 --> 00:48:36.430
and so I was picking up freelance work both in radio and on the writing side and

826
00:48:36.431 --> 00:48:37.840
it was pretty equal.

827
00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:41.290
Like I did a big radio documentary and I did something for a show called the

828
00:48:41.291 --> 00:48:43.720
savvy traveler,
which was a travel show back then.

829
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.630
So within the public radio world there was like,

830
00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:51.040
there was enough stuff that needed to be done and not that many people who were

831
00:48:51.041 --> 00:48:54.310
like sort of free to do it,
that I can pick up,
you know,

832
00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:58.540
sort of work at that point as well.
So it was about half and half.

833
00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:03.280
<v 0>Got It.
And,
uh,
how,
how did you come to then,
uh,</v>

834
00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:07.150
cofound planet money because,
uh,
I mean,
and,

835
00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:12.180
and what was the timeline between getting landing that dream job as producer and

836
00:49:12.601 --> 00:49:13.440
getting to planet money?

837
00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:17.600
<v 2>So that was,
I guess there was a year,
I mean,
there was a,</v>

838
00:49:17.601 --> 00:49:21.510
there was a decade in between,
uh,
uh,
getting the job.

839
00:49:21.511 --> 00:49:26.511
I got the job in [inaudible] 99 and then a plan of money started in 2009 and one

840
00:49:28.381 --> 00:49:31.620
of the nice things about working at this American life was that like the job was

841
00:49:31.621 --> 00:49:35.460
constantly changing as I was there.
So I never had to,
like,

842
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.320
I never got bored like I started and I sort of took a long time.

843
00:49:40.321 --> 00:49:43.350
That learning curve is pretty steep to get good at producing documentary radio.

844
00:49:43.351 --> 00:49:47.490
So the first couple of years I was just trying to get my head above water and

845
00:49:47.491 --> 00:49:50.970
figure out how this stuff worked and what people were talking about in these

846
00:49:50.971 --> 00:49:52.410
edits and you know,

847
00:49:52.411 --> 00:49:56.130
how to become better at recognizing good moments and all that stuff.
Um,

848
00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:01.320
and then,
and then,
and then,
you know,
nine 11 was,

849
00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:04.360
I mean it sounds cheesy and tried to say it,

850
00:50:04.361 --> 00:50:08.370
but like not 11 sort of changed the focus of the show quite a bit.
We became,

851
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:13.240
you know,
we did a couple of shows on nine 11 and then we,
we,
we just got,
I think,

852
00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:16.740
I think it made us a little bit more,

853
00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:18.870
maybe we'd always been serious journalistically,

854
00:50:18.871 --> 00:50:23.400
but I think it like felt like we were able to tell kinds of stories that were

855
00:50:23.401 --> 00:50:27.560
both sort of journalistic and,
and human in a way that like,

856
00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:31.430
felt like it filled a niche a little bit.
Um,
so,

857
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:36.200
so we did a lot of reporting on that and on the war and we went to an aircraft

858
00:50:36.201 --> 00:50:38.990
carrier.
So that sort of changed.
Uh,

859
00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:42.080
and then we did a TV show in there too.
So we did it,

860
00:50:42.081 --> 00:50:46.310
this big TV show for showtime and I was an executive producer on the TV show.

861
00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:50.450
So then I was like spending,
you know,
three or four years learning how to do TV,

862
00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.900
which is a whole other huge learning curve.
And Man did,

863
00:50:53.901 --> 00:50:55.690
we got our asses handed to us.
They're like,
oh,

864
00:50:55.691 --> 00:50:58.000
we thought we were sort of storytelling experts.

865
00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:01.370
Then we got into this new medium and we were like,
nothing we know works.

866
00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:07.370
You know.
Can you give some examples because yeah,
I'd love some examples.

867
00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:11.360
Yeah.
Well I mean it's like a y or an explanation of why it doesn't work.
Why,

868
00:51:11.361 --> 00:51:13.180
why didn't it translate?
Well,

869
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:16.370
everything that I laid out to you about like what's good tape,
you know,

870
00:51:16.371 --> 00:51:20.960
what you're going for in a radio interview.
Like that stuff doesn't apply to TV.

871
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:23.420
So like what I'm often,
you know,

872
00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:28.600
you can make an amazing radio story out of one or two people telling a story

873
00:51:28.941 --> 00:51:32.990
that happened to them in the past.
Like,
you know,

874
00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:37.580
one of I first I won a big award called the third coast audio where at this

875
00:51:37.581 --> 00:51:38.031
American life,

876
00:51:38.031 --> 00:51:42.230
which was essentially two people at brother and a sister talking about a story

877
00:51:42.231 --> 00:51:45.830
that happened to them,
you know,
60 years ago.

878
00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:48.680
And it was just the two of them talking and we intercut them and we put in a

879
00:51:48.681 --> 00:51:52.100
little bit of script and it was like one of the most moving stories that I've

880
00:51:52.101 --> 00:51:56.360
ever produced.
And that's death on television.

881
00:51:56.361 --> 00:52:01.361
You can't watch people telling a story about something that happened a long time

882
00:52:01.821 --> 00:52:05.720
ago,
something about it just does not work.
Uh,

883
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:08.390
and we would try to produce these things and we'd be watching them and we'd be

884
00:52:08.391 --> 00:52:11.450
like bored out of our skulls because there's just like you,

885
00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:15.680
you just need so much more visual information than just watching people's,

886
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:17.510
you know,
watching people talk.

887
00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:21.230
So that was one of the big lessons is sort of like,
it made me realize like,

888
00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:25.400
oh TV.
That's why,
that's why reality television is so,

889
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:29.030
it's so big.
Like you can do it,

890
00:52:29.031 --> 00:52:33.920
you can produce a story from the past,
but it's best to do it.

891
00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.890
You have to just fill,
you have to give people something to watch.

892
00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:41.920
And so you have to invent an entire visual story to go along with the story that

893
00:52:43.731 --> 00:52:47.240
the person that's telling.
And that's just,
and that's really expensive.

894
00:52:47.241 --> 00:52:50.240
So if you look at like an Errol Morris documentary or something like that,

895
00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:54.230
where like there was that one where he will be an example of,

896
00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:58.630
of one of those dongles war.
The fog of war was one that I saw.

897
00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:04.240
So that's the one where he interviews,
um,
who's the interview,
um,
uh,
are,

898
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:08.090
are,
what am I,
what's his name?
The guy from Vietnam,
I haven't seen the movie.

899
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.451
Okay.

900
00:53:08.451 --> 00:53:13.451
He interviews a famous general from Vietnam who is one of the ones that sort of

901
00:53:14.541 --> 00:53:18.080
like was came under a lot of criticism.
He,

902
00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:22.730
and it's a lot about like what went on back then,
you know,
in Vietnam.

903
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:24.170
And if you watch the movie now,

904
00:53:24.171 --> 00:53:26.070
and I watched that movie around this time and I was like,

905
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:27.450
<v 3>oh look at what he did.</v>

906
00:53:27.451 --> 00:53:32.451
Like he filled every second every frame with like invented imagery that he had

907
00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:35.160
that he had to invent and come up with.

908
00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:40.370
And it's so time consuming and so expensive versus sounds like sounds like man

909
00:53:40.861 --> 00:53:44.280
on wire and man I'm why are exactly the same type of thing.

910
00:53:44.281 --> 00:53:45.570
And if you watch that movie now,

911
00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:49.950
so they have to do so much work to keep the screen covered with interesting

912
00:53:49.951 --> 00:53:54.630
things to watch versus if you just take your average reality show where you've

913
00:53:54.631 --> 00:53:59.520
got like two family members fighting with each other,
that's the,

914
00:53:59.521 --> 00:54:02.040
that's the narrative crack in visual terms.

915
00:54:02.041 --> 00:54:06.240
Like we are hardwired to watch that stuff.
It's so much cheaper.

916
00:54:06.241 --> 00:54:09.660
You can turn the camera on and you watch two people fighting and you want to

917
00:54:09.661 --> 00:54:12.960
watch it,
you know,
whether I mean,
and so and so it made me realize,
oh,

918
00:54:12.961 --> 00:54:16.530
that's why TV is the way it is because that's what we want to watch.
You know,

919
00:54:16.531 --> 00:54:20.820
we don't want to watch,
you know,
we want to watch things moving on screen.

920
00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:25.590
Um,
so,
so it was really,
it was really hard.
And so we had to think,

921
00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:29.070
think entirely differently.
We had to think entirely visually.

922
00:54:29.071 --> 00:54:33.480
Like what's an interesting visual story versus an interesting audio story.

923
00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:34.920
<v 2>Okay.</v>

924
00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:39.180
<v 0>Yeah.
And I,
I suggest anyone listening who enjoys reality television,</v>

925
00:54:39.181 --> 00:54:43.530
not learn too much about how it's produced because it will,

926
00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:46.920
it will shatter the veneer.
Uh,
I remember I was,

927
00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:50.310
I was talking to this guy who's worked on a bunch of reality shows you would

928
00:54:50.311 --> 00:54:51.300
recognize and he said,

929
00:54:51.301 --> 00:54:54.840
have you ever noticed how many of the arguments happen with people standing up

930
00:54:54.841 --> 00:54:57.880
in the kitchen and someone's always mixing something psych.

931
00:54:57.930 --> 00:55:02.400
Do you think that happens naturally?
I thought it was like,
that's a good point.

932
00:55:02.401 --> 00:55:05.340
They are always arguing in the kitchen and someone's just absent mindedly

933
00:55:05.341 --> 00:55:08.640
stirring something that we never really find out about it.

934
00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:15.360
I wanted to come back to perfectionism because you mentioned you,

935
00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:19.860
you learn the benefits of working with a perfectionist or maybe you said being a

936
00:55:19.861 --> 00:55:23.640
perfectionist and you also mentioned the New Yorker.
So I had a chance,
very,

937
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:29.000
I was very fortunate to have the chance to study nonfiction writing for semester

938
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:34.140
with John McPhee,
who's a staff writer for the New Yorker and just a phenomenal,

939
00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:36.330
phenomenal writer with a,

940
00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:40.380
the the greatest attention to detail and structure of anyone I've ever met.

941
00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:45.600
Uh,
but I'd be curious to hear sort of what,
what did you learn from working with,

942
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:48.840
with IRA?
What are the benefits of being a perfectionist or working for one?

943
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:51.543
<v 3>MMM,</v>

944
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:55.830
<v 2>I think,
I think it basically,
it just,</v>

945
00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:01.400
what I learned is that,
um,
a lot of it is,

946
00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:05.070
is just about the effort you put in.
And it's not about like,
you have to have,

947
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:08.370
you know,
you have to have a creative brain and like,
part of it is that,
you know,

948
00:56:08.371 --> 00:56:12.240
you're just,
you're just sort of born with,
I guess partly you're,
you're,

949
00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:15.120
you're sort of born with part of it at least.

950
00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:18.600
But like watching IRA,

951
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:22.470
like sort of like work a lot of times he's just,

952
00:56:22.471 --> 00:56:25.990
he just thinking about it longer than other people keep thinking about it and

953
00:56:25.991 --> 00:56:29.170
then eventually he comes up with an idea.
That's good.
Uh,

954
00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:32.110
and it just made me realize like that's how people get to good ideas as they go

955
00:56:32.111 --> 00:56:36.880
through a lot of bad ideas first.
Um,
and that there's not really,

956
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:40.390
like,
occasionally a good idea comes to you first if you're lucky.
Uh,

957
00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:43.300
but like usually it only comes after a lot of bad ideas.

958
00:56:43.301 --> 00:56:47.260
And so what being a perfectionist is this sort of just like putting it a little

959
00:56:47.261 --> 00:56:52.261
bit more time to think through the level one or the level two ideas and try to

960
00:56:52.571 --> 00:56:56.410
get to something that's a little bit deeper.
Um,

961
00:56:57.190 --> 00:57:01.180
and I think that's why we do as many edits as we do because often what happens

962
00:57:01.181 --> 00:57:04.420
in an edit is you'll take a bad idea and you'll make it into a good idea over

963
00:57:04.421 --> 00:57:08.080
the course of several edits.
Um,
and you'll have a,
an idea that's an,

964
00:57:08.081 --> 00:57:09.860
a script that sort of like,

965
00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:12.640
that's just getting you from one point to another point and then you'll be like,

966
00:57:12.641 --> 00:57:14.050
you know what this is like,
it's like this.

967
00:57:14.051 --> 00:57:16.420
And you'll come up with a good metaphor and then you'll be able to like,
oh,

968
00:57:16.421 --> 00:57:18.190
that's a good metaphor to put in this part of the script.

969
00:57:18.191 --> 00:57:19.090
It will really make it sing.

970
00:57:19.091 --> 00:57:21.340
And then eventually you'll get to a part where you're like,
oh,

971
00:57:21.341 --> 00:57:25.630
it feels like a revelation will now happen at this point in the piece.

972
00:57:25.631 --> 00:57:28.570
Whereas before it was just moving from one,
you know,

973
00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:32.920
from one thing that happened to the next.
Um,
so,

974
00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:37.960
so I think that I learned that.
Um,
and then

975
00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:40.420
<v 0>are there any examples,
I'm sorry,
go ahead.
Ahead.</v>

976
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:42.660
I'm going to come back and I was just going to ask you,

977
00:57:42.661 --> 00:57:47.661
are there any examples of May perhaps from startup and reply all,

978
00:57:48.121 --> 00:57:52.440
but it could be from previous shows of specific bad idea that was turned into a

979
00:57:52.441 --> 00:57:55.300
good idea or that became a good idea?
Ah,

980
00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:59.690
<v 2>yeah.
I mean it happens every single time.
So,</v>

981
00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:00.903
um,

982
00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:05.840
I'm trying to think of one that I could share that was like,
that's like,

983
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:08.810
it's easy enough to explain.
Um,

984
00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:12.830
let me think for one more second.
I don't know.
This might be hard to do.

985
00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:15.970
<v 0>Uh,
sure.
We can,
we can,
we can come back to it.
I want to</v>

986
00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:20.190
pick up where you left off.
Let me,
yeah,
let me think about it.

987
00:58:20.191 --> 00:58:23.900
It's like I couldn't come up with an example for you,
but,
okay.
Uh,

988
00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:27.870
are there any habits that you picked up from IRA or the,

989
00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:29.880
this American life team otherwise that you,

990
00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:33.780
you still have a particular,

991
00:58:34.090 --> 00:58:38.760
any particular working habits?
Either either or both.

992
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:44.230
<v 2>So the good habit that I picked out is that I picked up is sort of like,</v>

993
00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:49.250
um,
like being committed to excellence.

994
00:58:49.251 --> 00:58:52.760
Like that is something that I learned and I learned it from Iraq.

995
00:58:52.790 --> 00:58:57.790
Like I think he really just hated to have something go out when it could have

996
00:58:59.391 --> 00:59:01.610
been better.
And if he had an idea of how to make it better,

997
00:59:01.611 --> 00:59:06.440
he would always almost always try to make it better.
Um,
and still does.

998
00:59:06.590 --> 00:59:10.250
And that's like,
that was,
that was,
and I was not that way.

999
00:59:10.251 --> 00:59:12.830
I was sort of like the kind of guy who was like,
yeah,
it's good enough,
you know?

1000
00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:18.080
And,
um,
and I,
what I realized is that,
and I,
and I,
but I,

1001
00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:22.400
I,
that was sort of a,
I think being way is a little bit of a,

1002
00:59:22.401 --> 00:59:27.020
of a dodge or a rationalization or an emotional sort of like thing you do to

1003
00:59:27.021 --> 00:59:30.920
sort of like,
not actually try to make things good.
Um,
you know,

1004
00:59:30.921 --> 00:59:34.460
cause trying to make things good as scary and you might fail and people might

1005
00:59:34.461 --> 00:59:36.380
say it sucks.
And we all know that.

1006
00:59:36.381 --> 00:59:40.910
And so we all like find our ways of rationalizing with it and a rationalizing

1007
00:59:40.930 --> 00:59:43.430
and that's,
and that's what I was doing.
I was like,
Hey,
it doesn't matter.

1008
00:59:43.431 --> 00:59:47.210
It's okay.
Uh,
and so working with IRA,
like I was like,

1009
00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:51.380
I know this is a guy who really cares about making it good and of all the things

1010
00:59:51.381 --> 00:59:55.040
to care about in the world,
that's one of the better ones,
you know,

1011
00:59:55.041 --> 00:59:56.870
just to try to make something excellent.

1012
00:59:57.050 --> 00:59:59.420
Like there's a lot of things that you can care about and that's a good thing to

1013
00:59:59.421 --> 01:00:03.980
care about.
So I learned that from him.
Uh,
and,

1014
01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:07.430
um,
there's a certain

1015
01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:13.970
comfort with crisis that he had that I'm afraid we're off on me also,

1016
01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:21.440
but I don't think it's a good thing.
I think that's a bad thing.
Um,
uh,

1017
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:22.970
keep,
can you give any,
any,

1018
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.650
any particular moment come to mind and we'll slip it in.
I mean,
I think,

1019
01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:31.010
I mean he just,
the show would,
was always like every,

1020
01:00:31.011 --> 01:00:32.780
for the entire time I worked at this American life,

1021
01:00:32.781 --> 01:00:35.720
it was always like up until the very last minute it was,

1022
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:40.310
it was getting produced and edited and you know,
it was always like,
it was,

1023
01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:40.701
you know,

1024
01:00:40.701 --> 01:00:45.701
you'd be shocked the probably like 20 to 30% of the time you were like,

1025
01:00:45.921 --> 01:00:49.960
is it even going to go up?
And that's crazy.
You know,
over like 15 months old.

1026
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.120
That's a lot to be like maybe 30% of the time we're really going to make it this

1027
01:00:53.121 --> 01:00:55.520
time.
I mean,
and,
and then at a certain point I was like,
Oh yeah,

1028
01:00:55.521 --> 01:00:59.270
we're always going to make it,
cause we always make it.
Uh,
but still,
it's like,

1029
01:00:59.271 --> 01:01:02.990
it's always right up into the right up until the last minute.
And um,

1030
01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.120
and it's better now.
It's way better now and a,

1031
01:01:05.121 --> 01:01:09.800
and like they've gotten like processes in place and stuff,
but uh,

1032
01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:12.410
and part of it is just audio is real time.

1033
01:01:12.411 --> 01:01:14.420
So even if you've been doing it for a long time,

1034
01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:19.050
you just can never quite get your head around how long it takes.
Um,

1035
01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:20.510
but part of it is a,

1036
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:23.390
but part of it is just sort of like he's comfortable with that.

1037
01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:26.000
And I think in a certain way it focused his mind,
I think.

1038
01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:28.730
And I think it also focuses my mind.

1039
01:01:28.731 --> 01:01:33.170
I think like I've noticed myself doing like this,
this episode recently.
Like,

1040
01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:35.781
you know,

1041
01:01:35.781 --> 01:01:39.800
I'm the one who's writing it and I've got a whole bunch of other things that

1042
01:01:39.801 --> 01:01:43.190
have to do.
And on top of writing the script for this week's episode,

1043
01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:47.000
and it's like,
I sit down and I try to think,

1044
01:01:47.001 --> 01:01:49.430
but I'm like worried about this thing and I'm worried about that thing.
And I,

1045
01:01:49.431 --> 01:01:53.690
and in the back of my mind,
in this bad part that I learned,
I think is,

1046
01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:59.420
but it's gonna it'll,
I still have,
you know,
you know,

1047
01:01:59.421 --> 01:02:02.470
Monday morning at 5:00 AM I'll just get up early,
you know,
uh,

1048
01:02:02.550 --> 01:02:05.360
I still have that in,
in my,
in the back of my mind.
And then,

1049
01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:08.780
and at that point I'll have no choice and I will have to make it good.

1050
01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:11.610
And so I'll just leave it til that moment.
Um,

1051
01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:14.960
and I don't think that's not good.

1052
01:02:14.961 --> 01:02:19.470
And I like what it does is it drags everybody else into your crisis.
And so my,

1053
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:20.940
you know,
Caitlin,

1054
01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:25.941
my producer is like dragged into my way of dealing my way of managing my time

1055
01:02:27.061 --> 01:02:30.270
and my way of sort of trying to make things good.
Um,

1056
01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:32.730
and that's,
I don't think,

1057
01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:35.730
I don't think she likes it and I didn't like it when I was a producer.

1058
01:02:35.790 --> 01:02:39.480
Like I felt like,
why is he saving everything until the last minute?

1059
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:44.630
And I'm doing my exact same thing,
you know,
two minds.
Uh,

1060
01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.900
so that's,
uh,
that's because they learned all those,
you know,

1061
01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:52.260
I had 20 years of learning,
like,
yeah,
that was,
comes out.
It's fine.
It's so,

1062
01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:54.750
it's bad.
It's been bad,
you know?
So

1063
01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:59.200
<v 0>yeah,
I've,
uh,
I've learned that that,
um,</v>

1064
01:02:59.390 --> 01:03:03.340
have developed a similar level of comfort with crisis and last minute

1065
01:03:03.341 --> 01:03:04.660
turnarounds and,
uh,

1066
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:09.710
I know from personal experience learn the hard way that that is a very fast way

1067
01:03:10.421 --> 01:03:15.421
to burn people out who haven't been conditioned and how you can lose really good

1068
01:03:15.701 --> 01:03:19.180
talent unfortunately.
Um,
the,
uh,

1069
01:03:19.810 --> 01:03:20.950
the commitment to excellence.

1070
01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:25.630
Are there any stories that come to mind of particular time?

1071
01:03:25.631 --> 01:03:26.830
For instance,
you handed,

1072
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:30.220
you pass something on to Ira that you thought was good enough and he was like,

1073
01:03:30.221 --> 01:03:32.950
no,
not good enough and give it back to you.
Did that happen?

1074
01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:37.620
<v 2>Oh,
I mean all the time,</v>

1075
01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:42.450
like every single thing I ever read or did,
ah,

1076
01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.440
was it was never,
I never,

1077
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:48.120
and this is not an exaggeration,

1078
01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:51.150
I don't think anybody ever in the history of this American life has ever had

1079
01:03:51.151 --> 01:03:53.190
this happen where though they'll read a draft,

1080
01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:57.720
even if it's the second or third draft and it'll be like,
and the,

1081
01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:59.760
and the answer is like,
all right,
it's all done.

1082
01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:06.510
There's always a new tweak and there's always something they can make it better.

1083
01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:09.570
Uh,
and um,

1084
01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:14.490
often there's like big thoughts and so,
and,
and again,

1085
01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:18.520
like,
and in the beginning it would sting a little bit.
It would be like,
God,

1086
01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:22.050
I just want to do one thing where it's like done and I'm,
I did it.
Right.

1087
01:04:22.410 --> 01:04:24.570
I took it really personally,
like I'm not doing it right.

1088
01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:28.680
And then it was only over time that I realized that like,
no,
you're not,

1089
01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:30.100
nobody does it.
Right?
Like the,

1090
01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:35.240
the first draft always sucks always for everybody.
And,

1091
01:04:35.241 --> 01:04:38.580
and,
and,
and you just got to get over yourself a little bit.
Like,
it's not,

1092
01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:42.060
it's not about you and your ego is just about trying to make it better.
Um,

1093
01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:47.130
and then,
and then I realized that it was like that.

1094
01:04:47.131 --> 01:04:51.180
It was like,
that's really useful,
um,

1095
01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.760
to be able to have that muscle of like sort of like,
okay,

1096
01:04:53.761 --> 01:04:57.220
I trust myself enough that I'm not completed yet.
Uh,

1097
01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.610
but that it's always,
you know,

1098
01:04:59.611 --> 01:05:02.430
and I can be made better by other people's input and ideas.

1099
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.620
That's essentially what an edit is.

1100
01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:09.330
And that's also a really good way of going through the world,
you know,
um,
is to,

1101
01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:13.110
is to try to be open to what people are telling you.
Um,

1102
01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:16.920
so that was a really,
I think that's,
you know,

1103
01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:20.470
the commitment to excellence means being comfortable,

1104
01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:25.990
hurting people's feelings and being comfortable,
having my feelings hurt.

1105
01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:31.200
Uh,
and to try to take the feelings out of it.
Um,
and,

1106
01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:36.310
and,
and just talk about like what the thing you're trying to do is,
uh,
and that,

1107
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:41.410
that's,
that was,
that was really useful to learn and would,
uh,

1108
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:44.020
would I ever just say,
this isn't good enough?

1109
01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:47.530
Give it another shot or was it always a very specific feedback?

1110
01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:52.450
Always very specific feedback.
Always very specific.
Got It.
Not do it again.

1111
01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:54.820
Better like that.
That's sort of like,
um,

1112
01:05:55.090 --> 01:05:58.360
and that's also I think what being a good editor is because he's such a,

1113
01:05:58.361 --> 01:06:01.390
he was such a master of like the form that he,

1114
01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:04.690
he could tell you what was wrong and he could tell you like,

1115
01:06:04.691 --> 01:06:07.750
this isn't working for this reason.
And often it's like,

1116
01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:12.610
it's like really stupid little things.
Like,
so for example,

1117
01:06:12.611 --> 01:06:14.260
I can give you an example of this,
like from,

1118
01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:18.880
from this current episode of startup that we just did,
we,

1119
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:23.890
it's all about burn out and basically we made the stupid decision to,

1120
01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:25.360
uh,
it's coming out today.

1121
01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:28.180
I think it will be up by the time this posts so you can,
people can listen to it.

1122
01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:33.430
Um,
but it's,
it was,
it basically we,
you know,
we,
we had this,

1123
01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:37.780
um,
we had the situation where like the hosts of reply all were working.

1124
01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:39.490
They ended up,
they were working late,

1125
01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:43.510
sort of like every day for like weeks.

1126
01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:44.920
And this was over the holidays.

1127
01:06:44.921 --> 01:06:49.570
When we made the stupid decision to try to put up a show on Christmas and on new

1128
01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:52.690
years eve.
Uh,
I don't know why we didn't take the week off,
but we didn't,

1129
01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:56.050
I think we felt like we were just knew we were just starting,
so it wasn't,

1130
01:06:56.290 --> 01:06:59.050
was too early to take time off or something.
Um,

1131
01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:03.550
so there were crashing trying to get these shows up on Christmas eve and on New

1132
01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:06.220
Year's eve and the shows weren't coming together very well and that we're just

1133
01:07:06.221 --> 01:07:10.420
working really,
really late.
And then,
uh,
one of our,

1134
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:14.380
when Lisa started recording conversations with them about like how they were

1135
01:07:14.381 --> 01:07:17.470
feeling,
they were feeling super burned out and it was really good.

1136
01:07:17.471 --> 01:07:22.170
It's really good tape.
Um,
and so that's what the episode is about.
Um,

1137
01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:26.110
and we were scripting the episode and I started by,
this all happened,

1138
01:07:26.111 --> 01:07:30.370
it came to a head when I was out of town.
I was in San Francisco where my,

1139
01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:34.570
where my wife's family lives and we brought the kids out there over the
holidays.

1140
01:07:34.571 --> 01:07:37.780
But I was like,
it's supposed to be sort of a vacation,

1141
01:07:37.781 --> 01:07:39.070
but I was basically working the whole time,

1142
01:07:39.071 --> 01:07:42.040
but there was a day or two that I didn't work.
Uh,

1143
01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:45.310
and so I started the story by saying like,

1144
01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:49.510
all this happened while I was on vacation.
Uh,
it was just like one line.

1145
01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:52.150
Um,
but it,
it,

1146
01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:57.220
that one line put this whole like in the story was pretty good and we're just

1147
01:07:57.221 --> 01:07:58.220
telling the story and we,
like,

1148
01:07:58.250 --> 01:08:00.670
we were playing all this pretty entertaining tape of people talking about how

1149
01:08:00.671 --> 01:08:03.880
burned out they were and how their whole feelings about their jobs had changed.

1150
01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:08.050
And it's all very real,
very raw,
very entertaining.
Um,

1151
01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:13.320
but something about me saying that I was on vacation had this whole scoldy tone

1152
01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:15.040
all the way through it,
which is sort of,

1153
01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:18.220
I leave for one day and the whole place goes to hell.
Sorry,

1154
01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:21.980
which was not intended at all.
But that was,
it had that feeling,

1155
01:08:21.981 --> 01:08:25.340
it sort of cast the entire episode and this sort of like unpleasant light.

1156
01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:28.580
And so that's what I'm saying,
like it was,

1157
01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:31.220
and we were doing these edits and we were like,
this should be good.

1158
01:08:31.221 --> 01:08:32.900
Like the tape should be good.
But when we're listening,

1159
01:08:32.901 --> 01:08:37.640
we were like the s I have this,
I don't like it.
It's making me feel bad.
Not Good.

1160
01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:39.680
And,
uh,
and,
and it was,

1161
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:43.010
and it wasn't until I was like one of our Starley put,

1162
01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:47.470
I think one of our other employees put,
uh,

1163
01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.830
put her finger on it.
She was like,
it's that,
that's the,

1164
01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:53.570
that's the thing that's making it feel bad.
Um,
is that,

1165
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:57.890
is that just that line in the beginning where you just sort of give it colors

1166
01:08:57.891 --> 01:08:59.120
the whole way you're hearing this thing?

1167
01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:03.770
And so we just recrafted the beginning to be about like this transition in a

1168
01:09:03.771 --> 01:09:07.430
startup's life where you go from trying to raise the money to all of a sudden

1169
01:09:07.431 --> 01:09:09.770
you're running the running the organization.
Right.

1170
01:09:09.771 --> 01:09:11.360
And they're two totally different jobs.

1171
01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:15.920
And like this is an episode about how we were trying to manage the second phase

1172
01:09:15.921 --> 01:09:18.830
of actually running the company and dealing with our employees.

1173
01:09:18.831 --> 01:09:23.190
And so that gave it a much better context basically to listen to the story.

1174
01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:29.270
<v 0>How far into the episode did you put your finger on that and,
and fix it.</v>

1175
01:09:29.271 --> 01:09:30.104
So from the,

1176
01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.740
from the first kind of pitch meeting or decision to make the episode about

1177
01:09:33.741 --> 01:09:38.450
burnout,
what,
what amount of time elapsed before you're like,
oh,

1178
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:41.330
okay,
that's the,
that's this issue we need to fix.

1179
01:09:42.150 --> 01:09:45.630
<v 2>Uh,
it was probably like we did the first,</v>

1180
01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:47.970
we did this edit and we actually put together a rough mix,

1181
01:09:47.971 --> 01:09:51.060
which we all listened to over the weekend and that was the one we were all like

1182
01:09:51.061 --> 01:09:53.490
freaking out because it wasn't working at all.
And we were like,
oh my God,

1183
01:09:53.491 --> 01:09:56.490
this is a stinker.
Uh,
and,

1184
01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.120
<v 0>and the rough mix is like missing music.</v>

1185
01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:01.010
It's just a bunch of tape strung together.

1186
01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:01.963
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1187
01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:04.460
I mean there's a little bit more than that cause it was like we had a really

1188
01:10:04.461 --> 01:10:05.870
good guy doing it.
But yes,
it was like,
uh,

1189
01:10:06.190 --> 01:10:08.660
the levels went all mastered and everything like that and we knew that we were

1190
01:10:08.661 --> 01:10:09.000
going to come.

1191
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.500
<v 0>Do you do Skype?
Do you do like scratch audio for the script as well or,
no,</v>

1192
01:10:12.610 --> 01:10:15.170
<v 2>we,
we had recorded the script.
We had recorded the script,</v>

1193
01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:17.360
so we'd done the whole thing like weed.
It was,

1194
01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:20.090
this was actually more work than we normally do.

1195
01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.740
Normally this would have been the second edit,

1196
01:10:21.741 --> 01:10:25.340
but we were like sort of behind the guns were like,
well maybe this will work.
So,

1197
01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:28.550
but it didn't.
Um,
so,

1198
01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:32.990
so it was essentially like a second edit and we did the second edit.
Um,

1199
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:36.800
and we realized that it wasn't working and then it was over the weekend

1200
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:38.360
basically that we were thinking about it.

1201
01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:41.420
And then this morning was when we sort of like,
I came in and rewrote,

1202
01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:45.680
rewrote the top based on sort of notes that certainly had given me last night,

1203
01:10:46.330 --> 01:10:47.990
a 10.
Um,

1204
01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:50.360
and there's a couple other things that were happening in the episode that we're

1205
01:10:50.361 --> 01:10:54.560
also sort of like robbing it of its,
of its power,
uh,
that we changed as well.

1206
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:56.510
But,
uh,
but yeah,
it took,

1207
01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:59.600
it was probably like a couple days of sort of like sitting and thinking with it.

1208
01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:03.380
That's another thing that I learned from Iraj also about excellence.

1209
01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.890
Excellence is just tricks,
you know,

1210
01:11:06.891 --> 01:11:10.970
it's just managing your time and your expectations.

1211
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:14.100
Um,
because there's this panic where you do,

1212
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:17.460
like when I first heard the rough mix,

1213
01:11:17.550 --> 01:11:22.020
I was panicked because I was like,
this is bad,
this is a bad show.

1214
01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:27.210
Um,
but like,
but I have seen,

1215
01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:29.760
but then I had to remember like,
okay,

1216
01:11:29.761 --> 01:11:33.900
but you thought some part of it was good in the beginning and you have to go

1217
01:11:33.901 --> 01:11:35.820
back and remember what was the part that was good.

1218
01:11:35.821 --> 01:11:39.330
And there's some reason that something that was good has not become bad.

1219
01:11:39.331 --> 01:11:42.660
There's something that you're doing wrong,
you have to fix.
It's not a,

1220
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:45.510
it's not a crisis.
You know what I mean?
It's just sort of like,

1221
01:11:45.511 --> 01:11:49.230
it's a problem to solve.
Uh,
and you know,
and that's,

1222
01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:52.050
it's just hard to remember that sometimes.
Like you just get.

1223
01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:54.600
And I think that's what,
you know,
with experience,

1224
01:11:54.601 --> 01:11:56.490
you start to realize like you've done it enough times,

1225
01:11:56.491 --> 01:11:59.610
like you've taken something that was bad and you've made a good that you realize

1226
01:11:59.611 --> 01:12:01.740
like it's,
it's,
uh,

1227
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:04.860
it's not the end of the world or it's not even,

1228
01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:07.740
it's not like something that can't be fixed because that's the feeling you feel

1229
01:12:07.741 --> 01:12:09.300
like,
oh my God,
there's nothing to be done.

1230
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:11.490
Like the thing that I thought was good is bad.

1231
01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:16.780
<v 0>So I'd love to talk about,
um,
ask just a few more long form questions,</v>

1232
01:12:16.781 --> 01:12:19.620
a couple of fast ones and then,
then we can wrap up.
But the,

1233
01:12:19.630 --> 01:12:22.330
I want to talk about turning a bad situation into a good one.

1234
01:12:22.540 --> 01:12:27.320
A very specifically,
I'd love to chat about startup episode number nine.

1235
01:12:27.321 --> 01:12:32.230
And we made a mistake.
So,
uh,
and,

1236
01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:36.430
uh,
about being attacked and villainized.
So maybe just for context,

1237
01:12:36.431 --> 01:12:41.050
if you could explain to people what that mistake was and then I'd love to dig

1238
01:12:41.051 --> 01:12:41.884
into that a little bit.

1239
01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:45.270
<v 2>Yeah.
So we,
we,
we do these ads on the show there.</v>

1240
01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:49.600
We have two ads in the middle of the show.
Uh,
and we,
we,

1241
01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:52.440
we produce our ads documentary style.

1242
01:12:52.441 --> 01:12:54.840
So what we tried to do is we just try to interview people,

1243
01:12:54.841 --> 01:12:58.680
either in the company or users of the company about their own real experiences.

1244
01:12:58.681 --> 01:12:58.951
And we,

1245
01:12:58.951 --> 01:13:03.951
and we turn those into little 45 minute long segments for,

1246
01:13:04.230 --> 01:13:06.110
for as our advertisements.
Um,

1247
01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:10.260
and one of our sponsors with Squarespace and the website company.

1248
01:13:10.261 --> 01:13:14.520
And what we were doing is we were talking to different Squarespace users about

1249
01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:18.000
their Squarespace sites.
Uh,

1250
01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:21.960
and we'd found this kid,
this lovely,

1251
01:13:21.961 --> 01:13:26.370
charming little boy who had a Squarespace site,
uh,
that he used for,

1252
01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.330
for Minecraft.

1253
01:13:27.690 --> 01:13:31.590
And we'd done this interview with them and it would have been lovely.
And,
um,

1254
01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:37.250
and then we put it up and we realized that we had never told him or his mother

1255
01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:40.500
that it was for an ad.
We had just,

1256
01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:45.270
and she had the impression that this kid was going to be on this American life,

1257
01:13:45.330 --> 01:13:48.750
like that her son was gonna be on this American life.
Um,
and then she got,

1258
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:52.110
and then she heard from a friend that it was actually used in this ad.

1259
01:13:52.111 --> 01:13:52.680
And then she,

1260
01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:56.490
she got very upset and she went on Twitter and was talking about it on Twitter

1261
01:13:56.491 --> 01:13:58.500
and she had a lot large Twitter following.

1262
01:13:58.501 --> 01:14:03.090
And so a lot of her Twitter followers were,
were you know,
upset as well.

1263
01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:06.150
And then we started digging into the details and it was like a little bit even

1264
01:14:06.151 --> 01:14:10.380
worse because like it turned out that the email that we'd sent to her sort of,

1265
01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:14.980
you know,
given the impression that I did still work at this American life,

1266
01:14:14.981 --> 01:14:18.800
which was made it seem even sleazier.
I know it was just the,
it was less,

1267
01:14:18.850 --> 01:14:23.850
it was like really bad screw up on our part that that seemed to her quite

1268
01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:30.370
logically and rightfully that had been on purpose and an intentional deception.

1269
01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:35.210
<v 0>And I enjoyed the episode for a host of reasons,</v>

1270
01:14:35.211 --> 01:14:37.670
but I mean the first of,
first of which is we all make mistakes.

1271
01:14:37.671 --> 01:14:42.671
The second of which is how quickly things can spiral or seemingly spiral out of

1272
01:14:42.831 --> 01:14:46.850
control with the Internet and social media.

1273
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:50.120
And how much of a crisis it can seem like.

1274
01:14:50.150 --> 01:14:53.780
And just like you working as a producer,
uh,
you know,

1275
01:14:53.781 --> 01:14:57.890
I've been sort of on the front lines online for a good period of time now.

1276
01:14:57.891 --> 01:15:00.080
So when when someone's like,
oh,
like this,

1277
01:15:00.081 --> 01:15:04.250
this like parody piece came out about your book in The New York Times and now

1278
01:15:04.251 --> 01:15:05.810
I'm just like,
Huh,
interesting.

1279
01:15:05.811 --> 01:15:08.630
I guess I should take a look at it later this afternoon.
I don't have the like,

1280
01:15:08.631 --> 01:15:12.920
oh my God,
the sky is falling.
Everything is over.
Uh,
response.

1281
01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:14.203
Not Always,

1282
01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.820
<v 2>which we very much had.
I definitely realize that now.</v>

1283
01:15:16.821 --> 01:15:17.840
Like it was like sort of like,

1284
01:15:18.010 --> 01:15:20.150
and there was a couple of people who are sort of visiting the office around that

1285
01:15:20.151 --> 01:15:24.280
time and they were like,
we think you're overreacting.
And it was like,
it just,
it,

1286
01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:29.890
which we definitely were,
I think.
Uh,
but it definitely,
it did feel like this,

1287
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:34.670
like the company was so new and so young and we,
and you know,

1288
01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:37.430
we've managed to do this thing,
which,

1289
01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:41.210
which I wasn't sure I was going to be able to pull off,

1290
01:15:41.211 --> 01:15:45.500
which was sort of like to document making all these mistakes,

1291
01:15:45.710 --> 01:15:49.940
you know,
and still have people like along for the ride with you.

1292
01:15:50.210 --> 01:15:52.970
You know what I mean?
Right.
And like,
cause a lot of times when you,

1293
01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:55.760
a lot of times when you make mistakes,
you're not at your best or your worst,

1294
01:15:55.761 --> 01:15:57.020
you know,
you're sort of the,

1295
01:15:57.021 --> 01:16:00.500
your unpleasant side or the part of you that's sort of a dick or whatever is

1296
01:16:00.501 --> 01:16:02.660
sort of coming forward and uh,

1297
01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:06.620
to sort of air all that and still have people sort of on our side and supporting

1298
01:16:06.621 --> 01:16:07.790
the company and supporting the show.

1299
01:16:07.970 --> 01:16:11.240
We felt like we were already walking a tight rope and this felt like this was

1300
01:16:11.241 --> 01:16:14.310
going to be the thing that knocked us off.
Um,
and

1301
01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.870
<v 0>no,
definitely.
And what I was curious to ask you is,</v>

1302
01:16:18.710 --> 01:16:22.460
as someone who's been on the documenting side for so long,

1303
01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:27.170
uh,
looking at different situations,
documenting other people's lives,

1304
01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:30.200
perhaps painting them not in a negative light but in a,
in a,

1305
01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:34.820
in a neutral or a comprehensive light,
if you went back,

1306
01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:37.080
uh,
to say,
uh,

1307
01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:41.030
interviewing people in covering people for hard hitting news or something like

1308
01:16:41.031 --> 01:16:46.010
that.
Um,
like has your viewpoint changed or your,
your feelings about that?

1309
01:16:46.011 --> 01:16:51.011
Because a lot of journalists absolve themselves of the damage they might do to

1310
01:16:51.021 --> 01:16:53.990
someone if it gets a lot of clicks are a lot of views or a lot of listens.

1311
01:16:53.991 --> 01:16:57.850
And I'm just,
I know that this American life is,
is,
uh,

1312
01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:01.760
at least all of the episodes I've heard or are very constructive.

1313
01:17:01.761 --> 01:17:03.530
But I'm just wondering how,

1314
01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:08.680
how your feeling about how your feelings as a journalist or documentarian,

1315
01:17:09.630 --> 01:17:12.590
uh,
changed as a result of becoming a target yourself?

1316
01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:17.360
<v 2>Well,
this is a bad cause.
I was like,</v>

1317
01:17:17.361 --> 01:17:20.480
this is bad mix.
I was panicked,
recorded the script.

1318
01:17:20.481 --> 01:17:21.960
We had recorded it as well or no,

1319
01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:25.280
do like scratch audio for the screw going to come do you do Skype,

1320
01:17:25.281 --> 01:17:27.290
do you do it and everything like that.
And we knew that we were kind of,

1321
01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.760
the levels went all math,

1322
01:17:28.890 --> 01:17:31.320
<v 0>the internet spiral out of control.</v>

1323
01:17:31.410 --> 01:17:35.970
Things can spiral or seemingly the second of which is how quickly,

1324
01:17:36.090 --> 01:17:38.010
first of which is,
we all make mistake of reasons,

1325
01:17:38.011 --> 01:17:42.060
but I mean the first [inaudible] for a host,
I enjoyed the episodes

1326
01:17:42.490 --> 01:17:47.490
<v 2>and then an intentional disassembly that had been on purpose logically and</v>

1327
01:17:47.561 --> 01:17:52.561
rightful to her quite seemed part that that really bad screw up on are there was

1328
01:17:54.091 --> 01:17:56.160
this,
it was like a year.
I know.

1329
01:17:56.170 --> 01:17:59.380
It was just the made it seem even sleazy to work at this American life,

1330
01:17:59.381 --> 01:18:03.460
which was not always,
which we've uh,
response.
Everything is over.

1331
01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:04.920
Oh my God.
The size.
Yeah.

1332
01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:07.140
<v 0>Balling afternoon.
I don't have the like home,</v>

1333
01:18:07.141 --> 01:18:09.510
I guess I should take a look at it later.
The sentence leg.
Huh?

1334
01:18:09.570 --> 01:18:12.920
Interesting book in The New York Times and now I'm parody piece came out about

1335
01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:17.010
your this like when when someone's like,
oh,
like the good period of time now.

1336
01:18:17.011 --> 01:18:21.840
So online for,
I've been sort of on the front lines,
uh,
you know,

1337
01:18:21.841 --> 01:18:25.650
I've think you working as a producer it seemed like and just allow much of a

1338
01:18:25.651 --> 01:18:27.540
crisis.
It can cedia and,

1339
01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:31.930
<v 2>yeah,
and social media given the impression that I did,
you know,</v>

1340
01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:36.760
her sort of email that we'd sent to us because like it turned out that the

1341
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:39.650
wasn't,
it was like a little bit even where all these mistakes,
you know,

1342
01:18:40.690 --> 01:18:44.290
making like to document or I was going to be able to pull off which was,

1343
01:18:44.530 --> 01:18:49.360
which I wasn't sure which you this thing,
you know,

1344
01:18:49.361 --> 01:18:53.230
we've managed to and we knew new and so young,

1345
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:57.760
it's like the company was solely,
it did feel like a,
but it definitely,

1346
01:18:57.761 --> 01:19:01.870
definitely where I think
and it was like it just,

1347
01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:04.660
we think you're overreacting visiting the office around that time.

1348
01:19:04.661 --> 01:19:05.370
And they were like,

1349
01:19:05.370 --> 01:19:07.720
and there was a couple of people who are sort of dies that now like it was like

1350
01:19:07.721 --> 01:19:09.280
sort of like already much had.
I would definitely

1351
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:13.350
<v 0>different situations documenting uh,
looking at it for so long.</v>

1352
01:19:14.050 --> 01:19:18.810
The documenting side as someone who's been on you is from Elaine.

1353
01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:20.070
What I was curious to ask him.

1354
01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:22.170
<v 2>No.
Um,</v>

1355
01:19:22.710 --> 01:19:25.760
it's going to be the thing that knocked us off a rope and this felt like this

1356
01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:28.430
was like we were already walking,
attempting,
supporting the show.

1357
01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:31.730
We felt on our side and supporting the kind of still have people.

1358
01:19:31.731 --> 01:19:35.840
So not to sort of air all that coming forward and Dick or whatever.

1359
01:19:35.841 --> 01:19:38.480
It's sort of tied or the part of you that's sort of,
you're sort of the,

1360
01:19:38.481 --> 01:19:40.830
your unpleasant see your best or your worst,
you know,
it's just,

1361
01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:45.770
<v 0>I know a lot of listens and if it gets a lot of clicks are a lot of the damage</v>

1362
01:19:45.771 --> 01:19:48.130
that they might do to someone that's absolve themselves.

1363
01:19:48.170 --> 01:19:52.630
A lot of journal about that because I'll be judged or you or your feelings.

1364
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:57.130
Like has your viewpoint changed that were hard hitting news or something like

1365
01:19:57.131 --> 01:20:00.880
people in covering people for interviewing,
uh,

1366
01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:02.860
to say you went back

1367
01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:08.130
if neutral or comprehensive light light but in a,
in,
in an APP's painting,

1368
01:20:08.131 --> 01:20:10.080
them not in a negative leather people's lives

1369
01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:12.840
<v 2>when you make mistakes,
you're not injured and everything like that.</v>

1370
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:13.800
We knew that we were going to come.

1371
01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:17.330
<v 0>Do you do Skype?
Do you do like scratch audio for the script as well or no,</v>

1372
01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:19.830
<v 2>we,
we had recorded the script.
We had recorded Amex.</v>

1373
01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:22.320
I was panicked because I was like,
this is bad.

1374
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:26.500
This is a bad show self.
Hmm.

1375
01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:28.200
<v 0>Well,
salt of becoming a target.</v>

1376
01:20:28.201 --> 01:20:31.230
You're a changed as a journalist or documentarian.

1377
01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.700
How your feelings as a Ji Ling about how,
how your feet,

1378
01:20:35.701 --> 01:20:38.700
but I'm just wondering,
a constructive,

1379
01:20:38.730 --> 01:20:41.840
I've heard or are very sa at least all of the episodes of the,

1380
01:20:41.841 --> 01:20:46.470
this American life is,
is my God.
The Sky is falling.
Everything is over.
Uh,

1381
01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:48.480
response.
Not Always,

1382
01:20:48.670 --> 01:20:52.450
<v 2>which we will work at this American life,
which was made it seem even sleazier.</v>

1383
01:20:52.810 --> 01:20:54.130
I know it's just the,
there was this,

1384
01:20:54.131 --> 01:20:59.131
it was like a really bad screw up on our part that that seemed to her quite

1385
01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:05.080
logically and rightfully that had been on purpose because like it turned out

1386
01:21:05.081 --> 01:21:09.460
that the email that we'd sent to her sort of,
you know,

1387
01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:12.180
given the impression that I did still yes,

1388
01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:17.400
<v 0>social media and how much of a crisis it can seem like and just like you working</v>

1389
01:21:18.101 --> 01:21:20.170
as a producer,
uh,
you know,

1390
01:21:20.171 --> 01:21:24.250
I've been sort of on the front lines online for a good period of time now.

1391
01:21:24.251 --> 01:21:26.440
So when when someone's like,
oh,
I like this,

1392
01:21:26.441 --> 01:21:30.640
this like parody piece came out about your book in The New York Times and now

1393
01:21:30.641 --> 01:21:33.740
I'm just like,
Huh,
interesting.
I guess I should take a look at it later.
The side

1394
01:21:33.810 --> 01:21:35.310
<v 2>is that now,
like it was like sort of like,</v>

1395
01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:37.620
and there was a couple of people who are sort of visiting the office around that

1396
01:21:37.621 --> 01:21:40.890
time and they were like,
we think you're overreacting.
And it was like,
it just,

1397
01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:45.960
which we definitely were,
I think.
Uh,
but it definitely,

1398
01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:50.560
it did feel like this,
like the company was so new and so young and we,

1399
01:21:50.670 --> 01:21:54.900
and you know,
we've managed to do this thing,
which,

1400
01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:58.650
which I wasn't sure I was going to be able to pull off,

1401
01:21:58.651 --> 01:22:03.651
which was sort of like to document making all these mistakes and it was like a

1402
01:22:03.961 --> 01:22:07.650
little bit even were sort of the your unpleasant side or the part of you that's

1403
01:22:07.651 --> 01:22:09.330
sort of a dick or whatever is sort of

1404
01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:13.490
<v 0>people's lives perhaps painting them not in a negative light but in a,
in a,</v>

1405
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:18.110
in a neutral or a comprehensive light.
If you went back,

1406
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:20.480
uh,
to say,
uh,

1407
01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:24.290
interviewing people and covering people for hard hitting news or something like

1408
01:22:24.291 --> 01:22:27.870
that.
Um,
like has your viewpoint changed or your,

1409
01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:30.140
your feelings about that?
Because I'll,

1410
01:22:30.150 --> 01:22:34.640
a lot of journalists absolve themselves of the damage they might do to someone

1411
01:22:34.641 --> 01:22:37.820
if it gets a lot of clicks are a lot of views or a lot of listens.
And I'm just,

1412
01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:39.510
I know sa,

1413
01:22:39.710 --> 01:22:43.550
at least all of the episodes I've heard or are very constructive.

1414
01:22:43.551 --> 01:22:45.350
But I'm just wondering how,

1415
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:50.470
how your feeling about how your feelings as a journalist or documentarian

1416
01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:54.380
changed as a result of becoming a target yourself?

1417
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:59.130
<v 2>Well show this is a bad cause.
I was like,</v>

1418
01:22:59.131 --> 01:23:02.280
this is bad mix.
I was panicked,
recorded the script

1419
01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:06.000
<v 0>ripped as well or no,
we do like scratch audio for the screw going</v>

1420
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.200
<v 2>to come.
Do you do Skype,
do you do it and everything like that.</v>

1421
01:23:08.230 --> 01:23:10.000
We knew that we were at times when you make mistakes,

1422
01:23:10.001 --> 01:23:12.700
you're nodding logically and rightful to her.

1423
01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:17.880
Quite seemed part that that really bad screw up on are there was this,

1424
01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:20.140
it was like a year,
I don't know,

1425
01:23:20.141 --> 01:23:23.350
it's just made it seem even sleazy and work at this American life,

1426
01:23:23.351 --> 01:23:27.430
which was not always,
which we've uh,
response.
Everything is over.

1427
01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:31.960
Oh my God,
the sky is falling.
This American life is,
is your best or your worst,

1428
01:23:31.961 --> 01:23:34.410
you know,
it's you coming forward and uh,

1429
01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:38.410
to sort of air all that and still have people sort of on our side and supporting

1430
01:23:38.411 --> 01:23:39.550
the company and supporting the show.

1431
01:23:39.730 --> 01:23:43.000
We felt like we were already walking a tight rope and this felt like this was

1432
01:23:43.001 --> 01:23:47.740
going to be the thing that knocked us off.
Um,
no,
definitely.

1433
01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:51.310
And what I was curious to ask you is just like,
Huh,

1434
01:23:51.370 --> 01:23:54.520
interesting and look in the New York Times and now I'm parody piece came out

1435
01:23:54.521 --> 01:23:57.580
about your this like when when someone's like,
oh,

1436
01:23:57.581 --> 01:24:00.340
like the good period of time now.
So online for,

1437
01:24:00.730 --> 01:24:03.640
I've been sort of on the front lines.
Uh,
you know,

1438
01:24:03.641 --> 01:24:07.960
I think you working as a producer it seemed like and just low,
much of a crisis.

1439
01:24:07.961 --> 01:24:12.550
It can cedia and how social media given the impression that I did,

1440
01:24:13.210 --> 01:24:14.043
you know,

1441
01:24:14.170 --> 01:24:18.910
her sort of email that we'd sent to us because like it turned out that the blade

1442
01:24:18.911 --> 01:24:23.480
that had been on purpose as someone who's been on these mistakes,
you know,

1443
01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:27.580
making like to document where I was going to be able to pull off,
which was,

1444
01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:32.650
which I wasn't sure do this thing,
you know,

1445
01:24:32.651 --> 01:24:36.520
we've managed and we ate and new and so young.

1446
01:24:36.610 --> 01:24:41.020
It's like the company was solely,
it did feel like a,
but it definitely,

1447
01:24:41.021 --> 01:24:45.160
definitely where I think it and it was like it just,

1448
01:24:45.370 --> 01:24:47.980
we think you're overreacting visiting the office around that time.

1449
01:24:47.981 --> 01:24:48.660
And they were like,

1450
01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:50.440
and there was a couple of people who are sort of has that now.

1451
01:24:50.441 --> 01:24:52.630
Like it was like sort of like,
I guess I should take a look at it later.

1452
01:24:52.631 --> 01:24:55.000
The side or the part of you that's sort of,
you're sort of the,

1453
01:24:55.001 --> 01:24:55.980
your unpleasant southern.

1454
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:59.060
It was like a little bit even where I'm the documenting side user,

1455
01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:00.310
a lot of listens and I'm just,

1456
01:25:00.311 --> 01:25:03.260
if it gets a lot of clicks are a lot of the damage they might do to someone

1457
01:25:03.261 --> 01:25:07.940
that's absolve themselves.
A lot of journal about that because I'll be finished.

1458
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:12.820
Are you or your feelings like has your viewpoint changed that were hard hitting

1459
01:25:12.821 --> 01:25:17.400
news or something like people in covering people for interviewing,
uh,

1460
01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:22.440
to say you went back if neutral or comprehensive light,

1461
01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:26.620
but in a,
in a,
an APP's painting them not in a negative leather people's lives.

1462
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:30.500
Pred Dick or whatever.
It's sort of for so long it was less,

1463
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:35.550
it was like really bad screw up on our part that that seemed to her quite

1464
01:25:37.810 --> 01:25:40.660
logically and rightful items when you make mistakes you're not used it and

1465
01:25:40.661 --> 01:25:43.120
everything like that.
And we knew that we were going to come.
Do you do Skype?

1466
01:25:43.121 --> 01:25:45.960
Do you do like scratch audio for the script as well or no,
we,

1467
01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:49.780
we had recorded the script.
We had recorded Amex.
I was panicked for lane.
What?

1468
01:25:49.781 --> 01:25:53.030
I was curious to ask.
No.
Um,

1469
01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:55.570
it's going to be the thing that knocked us off.
Hey Rope.

1470
01:25:55.571 --> 01:25:58.250
And this felt like this was like,
we were already walking a,

1471
01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:01.540
in supporting the show we thought of on our side and supporting the kids still

1472
01:26:01.541 --> 01:26:02.560
have people.

1473
01:26:02.561 --> 01:26:06.530
So now to sort of air all that coming forward and your best or your worst,

1474
01:26:06.531 --> 01:26:09.800
you know,
you see this American life is God,
the sky is falling,

1475
01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:13.940
everything is over.
A response,
not always,

1476
01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:17.870
which we will work at this American life,
which was made it seem even sleazier.

1477
01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:20.680
I know it,
it's just the cause.
I was like,
this is bad.
I wasn't,

1478
01:26:20.690 --> 01:26:23.960
it was like a little bit even where you're sort of the your unpleasant side or

1479
01:26:23.961 --> 01:26:26.240
the part of you that's sort of,
I guess I should take a look at it later.

1480
01:26:26.241 --> 01:26:28.070
The size that now,
like it was like sort of like,

1481
01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:30.380
and there was a couple of people who are sort of visiting the office around that

1482
01:26:30.381 --> 01:26:33.650
time and they were like,
we think you're overreacting.
And it was like,
it just,

1483
01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:38.720
which we definitely were,
I think.
Uh,
but it definitely,

1484
01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:43.330
it did feel like this,
like the company was so new and so young and we,

1485
01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:47.660
and you know,
we've managed to do this thing,
which,

1486
01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:51.410
which I wasn't sure I was going to be able to pull off,

1487
01:26:51.411 --> 01:26:56.170
which was sort of like to document making all these mistakes,
you know,

1488
01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:00.110
as someone who's been on laid that had been on purpose because like it turned

1489
01:27:00.111 --> 01:27:04.610
out that the email that we'd sent to her sort of,
you know,

1490
01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:07.320
given the impression that I did still yes.

1491
01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:12.420
<v 0>And social media and how much of a crisis it can seem like and just like you</v>

1492
01:27:12.941 --> 01:27:16.570
working as a producer,
a dick or whatever,
it's sort of other people's lives.

1493
01:27:16.810 --> 01:27:19.630
Perhaps painting them not in a negative light but in a,
in a,

1494
01:27:19.690 --> 01:27:24.220
in a neutral or comprehensive light.
If you went back,

1495
01:27:24.610 --> 01:27:26.540
uh,
to say,
uh,

1496
01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:30.430
interviewing people in covering people for hard hitting news or something like

1497
01:27:30.431 --> 01:27:35.410
that.
Like has your viewpoint changed or your,
your feelings about that?

1498
01:27:35.411 --> 01:27:40.330
Because a lot of journalists absolve themselves of the damage that they might do

1499
01:27:40.331 --> 01:27:43.570
to someone if it gets a lot of clicks are a lot of use are a lot of listens and

1500
01:27:43.571 --> 01:27:46.120
I'm done.
The documenting side recorded the script.

1501
01:27:46.121 --> 01:27:49.750
We had recorded it as well or no,
we do like scratch audio for the screw.

1502
01:27:49.751 --> 01:27:51.220
Gonna come do you do Skype,
do you do

1503
01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:52.660
<v 2>and everything like that.
We knew that we were,</v>

1504
01:27:52.661 --> 01:27:56.560
a lot of times when you make mistakes you're not logically and rifle to her

1505
01:27:56.710 --> 01:28:01.330
quite seemed part that,
that really bad screw up.

1506
01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:02.530
It was this,
it was like

1507
01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:05.880
<v 0>for so long.
Uh,
you know,</v>

1508
01:28:05.881 --> 01:28:09.960
I've been sort of on the front lines online for a good period of time now.

1509
01:28:09.961 --> 01:28:12.150
So when when someone's like,
oh,
like this,

1510
01:28:12.151 --> 01:28:16.320
this like parody piece came out about your book in The New York Times and now

1511
01:28:16.321 --> 01:28:18.630
I'm just like,
Huh,
interesting you is,

1512
01:28:19.610 --> 01:28:23.520
<v 2>this is a bad show self.
Hmm.</v>

1513
01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:25.240
<v 0>Well,
salt of becoming a target,</v>

1514
01:28:25.241 --> 01:28:30.050
you're a changed as a journalist or documentarian.
How your feelings as a year.

1515
01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:33.930
<v 2>I know it's just the made it seem even sleazy or work at this American life,</v>

1516
01:28:33.931 --> 01:28:38.010
which was not always,
which we've uh,
response everything is over.

1517
01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:41.310
Oh my God,
the sky's falling ever.
That this American life is,

1518
01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:44.920
is your best or your worst,
you know,
it's you coming forward and uh,

1519
01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:48.990
to sort of air all that and still have people sort of on our side and supporting

1520
01:28:48.991 --> 01:28:50.160
the company and supporting the show.

1521
01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:53.580
We felt like we were already walking a tight rope and this felt like this was

1522
01:28:53.581 --> 01:28:58.320
going to be the thing that knocked us off.
Um,
and no,
definitely.

1523
01:28:58.321 --> 01:29:01.320
And what I was curious to ask next.
I was panicked like this,

1524
01:29:01.321 --> 01:29:05.550
like the company was solely,
it did feel like a,
but it definitely,

1525
01:29:05.551 --> 01:29:09.690
definitely where I think it and it was like,
it just,

1526
01:29:09.870 --> 01:29:12.480
we think you're overreacting visiting the office around that time.

1527
01:29:12.481 --> 01:29:13.170
And they were like,

1528
01:29:13.170 --> 01:29:15.510
and there was a couple of people who are sort of eyes that now like it was like

1529
01:29:15.511 --> 01:29:17.130
sort of like,
I guess I should take a look at it later.

1530
01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:19.530
The side or the part of you that's sort of,
you're sort of the,

1531
01:29:19.531 --> 01:29:22.560
your unpleasant southern.
It was like a little bit even worse cause I was like,

1532
01:29:22.561 --> 01:29:23.170
this is bad.

1533
01:29:23.170 --> 01:29:26.290
<v 0>Did you lean about how,
how your feet,</v>

1534
01:29:26.291 --> 01:29:30.700
but I'm just wondering a constructive I purred or are very,

1535
01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:36.040
at least all of the episodes just I,
I know,
uh,
looking at different situations,

1536
01:29:36.041 --> 01:29:36.620
documenting

1537
01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:38.560
<v 2>very much had I definitely real afternoon,</v>

1538
01:29:38.561 --> 01:29:41.320
I don't have the like homeless and an intentional deception

1539
01:29:41.770 --> 01:29:45.880
<v 0>and I enjoyed the episode like,
and just low,</v>

1540
01:29:45.881 --> 01:29:50.080
much of a crisis.
It can cedia and how social media,

1541
01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:52.530
<v 2>given the impression that I did stuff,
you know,</v>

1542
01:29:53.010 --> 01:29:57.720
her sort of email that we'd sent to us because like it turned out that the blade

1543
01:29:57.721 --> 01:30:01.950
that had been on purpose as someone who's been on all these mistakes,
you know,

1544
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:06.390
making like to document or I was going to be able to pull off,
which was,

1545
01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:11.490
which I wasn't sure which do this thing,
you know,

1546
01:30:11.491 --> 01:30:16.491
we've managed to do and we ate and new and so young seemed to her quite

1547
01:30:18.690 --> 01:30:21.260
logically and rightful items.
When you make mistakes,
you're not here.

1548
01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:23.820
<v 0>Next,
next time you're in San Francisco to visit the,
uh,</v>

1549
01:30:23.821 --> 01:30:25.270
the inlaws are the wife's family.

1550
01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:28.080
Should we should put together a dinner of some time just for,

1551
01:30:28.380 --> 01:30:31.260
just for the hell of it.
I got that done.
That,
that'd be a good time.

1552
01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:35.760
<v 2>I mean,
who do you,
do you have people like that that you're like,
oh,
that's,</v>

1553
01:30:35.761 --> 01:30:38.890
that guy is doing her.
Well,
she's,
she's really got to go on like

1554
01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:43.550
<v 0>I do.
I do.
I do.
Uh,
and you know,
one of them is a friend,</v>

1555
01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:49.100
a close friend of mine who was in your first episode.
Uh,
that's Chris Saka.

1556
01:30:49.130 --> 01:30:52.340
So as,
as,
as an as an investor of Eight,

1557
01:30:52.341 --> 01:30:56.240
I've been a early stage investor and a lot of companies like whether it be

1558
01:30:56.241 --> 01:31:00.620
Twitter or advisor to Uber,
et Cetera,
Evernote.
And,
uh,

1559
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:05.510
Chris was one of the,
the very early mentors I had and he's a close friend,

1560
01:31:05.511 --> 01:31:08.940
but he also is very,
very good,
obviously at the early stage startup game.

1561
01:31:08.941 --> 01:31:12.580
So it was really Mike maples junior initially.
Uh,

1562
01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:17.420
and then Chris Saka and also a guy named naval Ravikant who,

1563
01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:20.650
uh,
are spectacularly good at what they do.
And they have a mythos,

1564
01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:26.120
a methodical way of dissecting certain types of problems.

1565
01:31:26.121 --> 01:31:27.200
And so I tried to,

1566
01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:32.120
I enjoy learning their respective recipes.
You know,

1567
01:31:32.121 --> 01:31:35.410
they're kind of algorithms that they use for evaluating things because,
uh,

1568
01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:40.100
they're all clearly effective,
but they're also sometimes very different,

1569
01:31:40.101 --> 01:31:44.930
which I find fascinating.
Um,
so in the,
in the startup world,
since I'm not,

1570
01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:48.530
there are people just because I'm running,
you know,
I,
I've,
I'm,
I have my,

1571
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:52.490
my own fledgling podcast,
uh,
and then the,
the blog,

1572
01:31:52.491 --> 01:31:56.740
which is much more established and so on.
There are people in the,
uh,

1573
01:31:56.750 --> 01:32:00.590
and I don't really love the content creation label,
but people in the,

1574
01:32:00.591 --> 01:32:01.780
the content sphere,

1575
01:32:01.781 --> 01:32:06.781
whether it be audio or spoke or a written word or even video and television

1576
01:32:07.751 --> 01:32:10.370
that,
that I really respect a lot.
Um,
you know,

1577
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:13.840
I find what Morgan Sperlock does very fascinating,
for instance,

1578
01:32:13.841 --> 01:32:17.200
who was kind of in front of the camera and behind the camera,

1579
01:32:17.201 --> 01:32:18.870
but now it does both,
uh,

1580
01:32:19.130 --> 01:32:23.950
including things that make him very much behind the scenes.
Um,

1581
01:32:24.130 --> 01:32:28.930
so yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
I,
I guess I've been on my own.
I'm sorry,

1582
01:32:28.931 --> 01:32:29.630
go ahead.

1583
01:32:29.630 --> 01:32:31.400
<v 2>No,
I know a couple people who are,</v>

1584
01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:34.760
who are working with his company and he seems to,
yeah,
it seems like a great,

1585
01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:39.430
you know,
he seems like he's doing a really good job running.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's a,

1586
01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:43.850
he had a nice hub for,
for where,
you know,
where cool things can happen.

1587
01:32:44.970 --> 01:32:45.241
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1588
01:32:45.241 --> 01:32:50.241
He's very good at the establishing rapport with just any,

1589
01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:55.470
any group you can imagine.
Uh,
so with,
you know,
inside,
inside man I think it is.

1590
01:32:55.471 --> 01:32:58.970
I don't think it's inside job inside man.
It's a,
it's really split.
Yeah.

1591
01:32:59.010 --> 01:33:03.480
Just incredible to see how quickly he can establish rapport with,
with people.
Um,

1592
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:08.130
so I'm going to ask you the UPPP reps,
the,
the opposite of the word successful,

1593
01:33:08.131 --> 01:33:12.420
not failure,
but what's the first face that comes to mind when you think of the,

1594
01:33:12.450 --> 01:33:16.290
and you're a very nice guy,
so this might be hard to,
hard to answer,
but what's,

1595
01:33:17.190 --> 01:33:20.670
what's the first face that comes to mind when you think of the word?
Punchable

1596
01:33:22.610 --> 01:33:23.443
<v 2>punchable</v>

1597
01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:29.590
Oh,
Tim,

1598
01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:36.000
<v 0>that could be your answer too.</v>

1599
01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:41.650
<v 2>Yeah,
no,
I uh,
I'm just trying to decide.
I will tell you this,
like,</v>

1600
01:33:41.651 --> 01:33:44.580
I feel like coming from,
um,

1601
01:33:47.950 --> 01:33:52.950
I guess coming from the not like the nonprofit world,

1602
01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:57.760
like where I,
I never had,
um,
this is the first,

1603
01:33:58.150 --> 01:34:00.520
this is my first fulltime job in the for profit sector.

1604
01:34:01.630 --> 01:34:03.920
Being the CEO of my own company,
uh,

1605
01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:06.610
since I was a hell of a way to a hell of a way to start.

1606
01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:12.820
And I think,
and coming from the public radio world and the,

1607
01:34:12.821 --> 01:34:15.640
and the not nonprofit world at large,

1608
01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:18.580
like I do think there is a,
um,

1609
01:34:19.530 --> 01:34:21.430
a way that we conceive of,

1610
01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:26.500
we conceive of ourselves as punchable in that world.
Like that we're like,

1611
01:34:26.501 --> 01:34:28.770
not that we need,
um,

1612
01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:33.580
that like we need to be shielded from this,
this world of profit.

1613
01:34:33.610 --> 01:34:36.690
And like somehow that there's like a,
that it's,
that it's,

1614
01:34:36.890 --> 01:34:39.580
that it's dangerous and it's filled with people who will sort of eat you for

1615
01:34:39.581 --> 01:34:42.250
breakfast.
And,
and I think,
you know,
I mean,

1616
01:34:42.251 --> 01:34:45.460
that's like a gross exaggeration and lots and lots of people in the nonprofit

1617
01:34:45.461 --> 01:34:48.730
world or like,
you know,
like this is like buy,
this is a gigantic,

1618
01:34:48.731 --> 01:34:51.460
gigantic overgeneralization just so you know.
But like,

1619
01:34:51.610 --> 01:34:55.850
but I do think there's like a slight attitude that I ran into at a public radio

1620
01:34:55.851 --> 01:34:59.060
and other places that like the,
the,

1621
01:34:59.190 --> 01:35:04.040
that we're shielded in this world from having to do,
uh,

1622
01:35:04.730 --> 01:35:08.840
you know,
from like some sort of like,
you know,
angry or,
or sort of like,

1623
01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:14.000
you know,
macho or malevolent forces in the for profit world.
And,
uh,

1624
01:35:14.450 --> 01:35:18.110
and that's like,
you know,
and that,
that's been one of the nice things.
And maybe,

1625
01:35:18.111 --> 01:35:19.970
you know,
who knows,
maybe I'm going to like,

1626
01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:25.130
get like my ass kicked so soon.
I probably will.
And like,

1627
01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:26.810
I'll be like,
you know,
God,

1628
01:35:26.811 --> 01:35:29.930
I wish I was still in the nonprofit sector or whatever,
but,
but there was like,

1629
01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:30.830
there's something about like,

1630
01:35:30.831 --> 01:35:34.820
just sort of going out and being part of this sort of,
you know,

1631
01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:40.370
market economy in a really,
really straight forward way.
Uh,

1632
01:35:40.610 --> 01:35:44.930
that's freeing.
And it doesn't feel like it doesn't,
you know,

1633
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:49.810
doesn't it feels like the way it should be and not scary.
You know,
it's like,

1634
01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:51.373
Yep.
That's it.

1635
01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:54.630
<v 0>Yeah.
No,
it makes it makes perfect sense.
I mean,
I think that it gives you,
I,
I've,</v>

1636
01:35:54.990 --> 01:35:59.460
uh,
I work with a number of,
of nonprofits like donors choose in New York,

1637
01:35:59.790 --> 01:36:02.940
which is run really leanly actually very much like a for profit in that way.

1638
01:36:02.941 --> 01:36:03.990
But yeah,

1639
01:36:04.020 --> 01:36:09.020
the for profit world gives you some metrics that are very clear to play with.

1640
01:36:09.390 --> 01:36:12.570
Uh,
that,
that I think can be freeing in a way.
Um,
because there's,

1641
01:36:12.571 --> 01:36:15.240
there's very little ambiguity about it.

1642
01:36:15.550 --> 01:36:15.810
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

1643
01:36:15.810 --> 01:36:18.990
<v 2>no,
that metric thing was huge for me.
Yeah.
That we didn't have,</v>

1644
01:36:19.050 --> 01:36:21.740
like it was like sort of decisions you didn't,
it's a very,

1645
01:36:21.790 --> 01:36:23.060
you make decisions for,

1646
01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:26.340
then you end up making decisions for all sorts of other weird sort of arbitrary

1647
01:36:26.341 --> 01:36:29.880
reasons which like what does the director like it or do our donors like it or

1648
01:36:30.630 --> 01:36:33.220
not?
Like,
do people like it?
It doesn't,

1649
01:36:33.230 --> 01:36:35.520
this is something that should exist in the world,
you know,

1650
01:36:35.521 --> 01:36:37.050
that people value enough to pay for.
Yeah.

1651
01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:42.970
<v 0>Yeah,
definitely.
Uh,
if now on that point,
you've,
you've,
uh,
you've,</v>

1652
01:36:43.180 --> 01:36:46.990
you've kind of,
uh,
not switched teams.
It's not like they're opposing teams,

1653
01:36:46.991 --> 01:36:50.560
but you've,
you've done a lot since you,
you were,

1654
01:36:50.590 --> 01:36:55.060
you were first teaching eighth grade science obviously.
Uh,
what would the old,

1655
01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:59.470
what would the old you say to the new you or what would the old you think of the

1656
01:36:59.471 --> 01:37:00.304
new you?

1657
01:37:00.630 --> 01:37:01.530
<v 4>Uh,</v>

1658
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:06.800
<v 2>owns me with,
think of the new me.
I think it depends on which,</v>

1659
01:37:06.801 --> 01:37:11.550
which stage you go to,
but like,
um,
you know,

1660
01:37:11.551 --> 01:37:12.590
going back to like,
you know,

1661
01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:16.620
sort of the college and post college like the old me would think would probably

1662
01:37:16.621 --> 01:37:20.370
think the new me with some kind of sellout maybe.
Um,

1663
01:37:20.670 --> 01:37:25.290
I was never that,
like,
sort of like that strident ever.
Uh,

1664
01:37:25.291 --> 01:37:29.700
but I was definitely more strident that I am now.
Uh,
and I definitely would have,

1665
01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:32.730
you know,
and I was definitely a sort of a little bit more suspicious of

1666
01:37:34.380 --> 01:37:38.610
the profit motive when I was younger.
Uh,
so I would probably be like,
what,

1667
01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:41.820
you know,
like what have you done with your life?
I mean,

1668
01:37:41.821 --> 01:37:42.930
the old me would also be like,

1669
01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:46.950
you're an old man and all you do is like go and you have like these two kids

1670
01:37:46.951 --> 01:37:49.500
that are just,
you know,
I would've looked at myself with horror,

1671
01:37:49.501 --> 01:37:53.910
I'm sure like my life.
I never,
I haven't seen a movie and God knows out along.

1672
01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.910
I don't travel anymore.
Uh,
you know,
so.

1673
01:37:57.020 --> 01:37:59.070
<v 0>All right,
one more question for you.
So if,</v>

1674
01:37:59.690 --> 01:38:03.920
if you could give your 20 year old self one piece of advice,
what would it be?

1675
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:11.390
<v 2>Um,
this is gonna Sound Corny,
but,
uh,</v>

1676
01:38:12.710 --> 01:38:16.490
don't be,
don't be so afraid.
You know,
I think,

1677
01:38:16.530 --> 01:38:19.820
I think I organized a lot of my choices based on sort of what I thought I could

1678
01:38:19.821 --> 01:38:22.040
do rather than what I wanted to do.

1679
01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:25.940
And I did that because I didn't want to try to do the things that I wanted to
do.

1680
01:38:26.570 --> 01:38:28.640
Um,
because I was afraid I would fail at them.

1681
01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:33.830
So I think I organized a lot of my life around fear for this first,

1682
01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:38.310
you know,
that first decade after college.
Uh,
and I'd tell my Scott,

1683
01:38:38.630 --> 01:38:40.010
don't be afraid to,
you know,

1684
01:38:40.011 --> 01:38:43.570
go out and just like fall on your face a little bit more.
Sorry.

1685
01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:45.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1686
01:38:45.310 --> 01:38:48.030
<v 0>Oh,
that's good advice.
Alex,
just in closing,</v>

1687
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:51.840
I know you have to run a where can people find more about you?

1688
01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:52.733

1689
01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:53.460

1725
01:41:15.870 --> 01:41:18.800
<v 6>So this is starting with on this American life a while ago.
And um,</v>

1726
01:41:20.130 --> 01:41:24.150
the setup is that if this actor Tate Donovan Donovan is,

1727
01:41:24.151 --> 01:41:26.680
it was a sort of a character actor.
He'd been,
you know,

1728
01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:29.010
sort of on a couple of different shows,
but he didn't get recognized very much.

1729
01:41:29.250 --> 01:41:32.160
And then he had a like a stint on friends and all of a sudden he was trying to

1730
01:41:32.161 --> 01:41:37.161
get recognized and it was really exciting for him to be recognized because he

1731
01:41:37.681 --> 01:41:42.030
finally got to be the celebrity that he always wished that he could be the

1732
01:41:42.031 --> 01:41:46.340
celebrity that he would have wanted to meet before he was famous.
Uh,

1733
01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:51.440
so when he got recognized and so one and this story happens when one night he

1734
01:41:51.451 --> 01:41:54.480
was out at this Broadway show and a lot of people were coming up to him and be

1735
01:41:54.481 --> 01:41:55.440
like,
Hey,
I saw you.

1736
01:41:55.680 --> 01:42:00.680
And he was able to like talk to people and be very magnanimous and say thank you

1737
01:42:00.751 --> 01:42:01.980
so much.
It really means a lot.

1738
01:42:01.981 --> 01:42:04.920
And he was like posing for pictures for people and it was at the show.

1739
01:42:04.921 --> 01:42:07.470
It was happening over and over and over again.

1740
01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:12.050
<v 0>I was,
I was,
I was exactly how I wanted to be.
I was doing it,
I was doing great.</v>

1741
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:13.833
<v 7>And then</v>

1742
01:42:14.630 --> 01:42:16.220
<v 0>the kid with the camera came along,</v>

1743
01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:25.220
this nervous kid,
I know he must have been 16 years old.

1744
01:42:25.221 --> 01:42:26.840
He's in a rented Tuxedo,

1745
01:42:27.170 --> 01:42:30.230
unbelievably like shy and awkward.

1746
01:42:30.231 --> 01:42:35.231
And he's got acne and he's got a camera in his hand and underneath the marquee

1747
01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:40.070
is his date.
Who is it?
Literally like a Po,
a prom dress,

1748
01:42:40.150 --> 01:42:43.880
and she's got a corsage and she's really,
you know,

1749
01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:46.070
nervous and sort of clutching your hands.

1750
01:42:46.071 --> 01:42:50.870
And he sort of comes up to me and he sorta mumbles something like,

1751
01:42:51.180 --> 01:42:55.070
you know something about a picture.
And I'm like,
I just feel for him.
So I'm like,

1752
01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:59.960
oh,
absolutely my gosh.
Or I have no problem,
my God,
you poor thing.
And,

1753
01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:04.370
and I go up to his,
his girlfriend,
I wrapped my arms around her and I'm like,
Hey,

1754
01:43:04.371 --> 01:43:08.390
where are you from?
Fantastic.
Going to see the play.
It's great.

1755
01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:11.750
And the guys sort of not taking the photograph very quickly.

1756
01:43:11.770 --> 01:43:15.030
He's just sort of staring at me and he's got his camera's hands and it's done by

1757
01:43:15.031 --> 01:43:17.720
is like chin,
you know,
and,
and uh,

1758
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:21.200
she's very stiff and awkward and I don't know what to do.

1759
01:43:21.201 --> 01:43:26.150
So I just leaned across and I kiss her on the cheek and I'm like,

1760
01:43:26.151 --> 01:43:27.980
all right,
God,
take the picture,
hurry up.

1761
01:43:30.670 --> 01:43:34.920
<v 6>Do you guys want to find out what happens next?
That's a story.</v>

1762
01:43:35.650 --> 01:43:38.970
Uh,
when you want to wait.
So what,

1763
01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:43.410
that is the power of a good narrative.
So when I talk about,

1764
01:43:43.411 --> 01:43:45.420
I'm talking about like those two basic things,

1765
01:43:45.421 --> 01:43:50.420
you're going for emotion and narrative.
We as humans are hardwired,

1766
01:43:50.430 --> 01:43:54.600
I believe,
to listen to narrative and,

1767
01:43:54.710 --> 01:43:58.040
and it's a very simple sort of the mechanics of narrative or very simple.

1768
01:43:58.041 --> 01:44:02.180
There's like a sequence of actions and those sort of rising action and it's

1769
01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:04.830
culminating in something.
Um,

1770
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:08.780
and you were in the middle of that sequence of actions and you were about to get

1771
01:44:08.781 --> 01:44:12.950
to the culmination and I stopped it and it's frustrating and you really want to

1772
01:44:12.951 --> 01:44:16.010
know what happens next and you would never,
if you are listening to this,

1773
01:44:16.011 --> 01:44:19.010
have turned off that podcast or that radio story at that moment.

1774
01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:23.480
And that is a good story.
And that's why you want to operate in stories.

1775
01:44:23.481 --> 01:44:24.980
That's why you,
when you're interviewing people,

1776
01:44:24.981 --> 01:44:28.050
you want to get their stories out of them.
Um,

1777
01:44:28.051 --> 01:44:31.290
and you want to get them talking in stories because stories are what

1778
01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:32.153
<v 8>we want to hear.</v>

1779
01:44:37.570 --> 01:44:38.270
