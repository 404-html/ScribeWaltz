1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.820
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:06.040
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start to shake.

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.530
I'm a cybernetic organism.

4
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:24.271
<v 1>Hello,</v>

5
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:27.390
this is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

6
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.060
This is a special edition.

7
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.410
It is brought to you sponsor free and I would like to ask a favor in exchange,

8
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.370
ah,
but we're going to get to that in a second.

9
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.070
The first thing is a description of this episode.

10
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:46.071
This episode is actually a presentation by yours truly that I wanted to share

11
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:49.890
because I get asked all the time,
how did you build your network?

12
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.980
And if you look at the say guest list from this podcast or people that I invest

13
00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:56.581
alongside,

14
00:00:56.581 --> 00:01:00.480
it seems like a very impressive list and I'm impressed by a lot of these people,

15
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.380
but it was built in a very strategic,

16
00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:08.700
a very methodical way and that doesn't mean it has to be artificial and not

17
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:12.270
looking at these friends as transactions.
These are relationships that I value,

18
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.230
but there is a right and a wrong way to network.
And in fact,

19
00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:20.940
I think the best way to build a world class network is to spend very little time

20
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.210
networking per se,
collecting business cards and whatnot.

21
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.310
So this presentation really encapsulates my approach and what I've done,

22
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.780
uh,
particularly since about 2007 and I gave this presentation at south by

23
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:35.580
southwest,
which is a huge conference.

24
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:39.810
It started off with music than the interactive technology portion exploded.

25
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.640
And don't worry about the slides,
the visuals in each case,
if I bring up a slide,

26
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.600
I explain it via voice.
So you really don't need the visuals.

27
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.490
I was able to experience a tipping point for the four hour work week when I gave

28
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:55.530
my first presentation at south by southwest,

29
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.400
and I won't go into all the story because I do it in the presentation,

30
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.080
but it really triggered everything that came after it.
So it was a game changer,

31
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:05.190
a life changer for me.

32
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.490
So what did I do exactly at south by southwest that helped it become it the most

33
00:02:11.311 --> 00:02:14.940
surprising self-help hit of the decade?
And quote according to Menstrual,

34
00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:15.780
how did that happen?

35
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.170
And in the session I talk about exactly what I did that led to a higher

36
00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:25.170
likelihood of that type of black swan event and the positive.

37
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.880
So I talk about biohacks for surviving and optimizing the booze marathon or

38
00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:32.370
sleep deprivation,
which is inherent to events like this,

39
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:35.100
whether it's south by southwest Ted,
uh,

40
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.950
any number of other events that are multi day.

41
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:42.450
This is an important point and a very important subject to master the top

42
00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:47.100
mistakes that I think 90% of attendees make,
how to pick your sessions,
parties,

43
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:49.320
et Cetera,
to make the most of all the madness,

44
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.040
how to interact with a listers or not.
And this is a very,

45
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.910
very important subject that I delve into and how to set yourself apart,

46
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.010
enjoy the ride and come away from the whole thing.
Because it is,

47
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.100
it is my opinion that if you choose one event properly and you build a network,

48
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:13.291
they're in the right way and a methodical way that really focuses on sort of

49
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:16.810
long term mutual relationships as opposed to transactions.

50
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.200
And a lot of the advice I think is counterintuitive or non obvious,

51
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:22.540
but it's very specific,
uh,

52
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.240
that you never have to network again ever.

53
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.110
And once you set that ball in motion,
it's like a snowball going down a hill.

54
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:30.010
And before you know it,

55
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:35.011
you have this unstoppable Goliath of inertia that can carry you forward four

56
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:38.980
years and in fact,
decades.
And that is what happened for me.

57
00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:40.420
It's south by southwest and two,
that's seven.

58
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.730
And I want to explain exactly how that happened,

59
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:44.020
which is what the session will go into.

60
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.300
And the favor that I would love to ask you guys is I would love to try to

61
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:51.580
minimize sponsorships if possible,

62
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.820
because I only take sponsorships from companies whose products I use and have

63
00:03:56.951 --> 00:04:01.480
vetted and so on.
Uh,
at the very least.
So I don't want to take a lot of sponsors.

64
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.810
I want to really limit it to that subset.
Um,

65
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.010
but the way that I can do that is by having you do something like subscribed to

66
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:11.140
my newsletter.
So for instance,
five bullet Fridays,

67
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:13.540
if you haven't been receiving these every Friday,

68
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:16.030
I send out a very short email of five bullets,

69
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.160
a containing the coolest things that I have found or been playing with that
week,

70
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:24.250
which could include favorite articles that I've shared with friends.

71
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:28.990
It could include Gizmos and gadgets that I've dug up somehow through experts and

72
00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:31.810
purchased and played with all sorts of randomness,

73
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:34.960
but a lot of awesome stuff that you can use immediately.
And it's a very,

74
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:38.440
very short,
hence five bullet email.
So to check that out,

75
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:42.960
it's free and you can sign up very easily.
Tried out for a week,
see what you

76
00:04:42.961 --> 00:04:47.961
think@fourhourworkweekdotcomforwardslashfridaysallspelledoutfourhourworkweek.com

77
00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:54.901
forward slash Fridays so if you would like me to cut back on sponsors,

78
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.260
then please go sign up.

79
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.290
It would mean a lot to me and I think you will love it if you go on Twitter and

80
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:02.710
just look at Hashtag five the number five,
five bullet Fridays.

81
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:06.220
You will see a lot of people are excited about this.
That is it.

82
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.820
So without further ado or volume peaking,

83
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.270
I hope you enjoy this presentation on exactly how I built my network,

84
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.870
which is one of the most common questions that I get.
So enjoy it.

85
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.310
Please let me know your feedback.

86
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.760
I am at t Ferris TFE are our ISS on Twitter and thank you for listening.

87
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.510
Hey guys,
I'm flanked by dignitaries.

88
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.450
I used to have a rat tail.
How did I get invited to this party?

89
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.880
Well thank you all for coming.

90
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:44.881
I feel like a huge debt of gratitude to south by southwest because in 2007 prior

91
00:05:46.421 --> 00:05:51.280
to that the four hour work week had been turned down by 26 publishers violently

92
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.310
in many cases and then at south by that year was the tipping point for the four

93
00:05:56.381 --> 00:05:58.820
hour work week,
went on to hit the New York Times,

94
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.060
stayed there for almost four years on broken millions of copies,

95
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.530
30 plus languages later.

96
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.870
Here I am presenting kind of crazy and I've been back basically every year
since.

97
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.440
So I feel like I have a playbook,
a couple of tips,

98
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.010
tactics that hopefully you can use over the next few days to get the most out of

99
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:19.730
this event because I really feel like if you do south by properly,

100
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:23.150
once you never have to network ever again.

101
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.460
You don't have to Schmooze,
you can just coast and write it out.

102
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:31.850
So I'll try to give you a quite a bit of actionable information.

103
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.060
The subject matter of the previous presenter and the one after me,

104
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:35.990
far more important,

105
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:40.850
but I guarantee probably more profanity and crassness in this one said this

106
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:45.851
particular slide is me at burning man in 2008 after being thrilled with what

107
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:48.410
happened at south by,

108
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.210
I have very little recollection of this particular incidence and I suspect that

109
00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:58.100
may be true for many of you over the next few days.
So let's start with Avocados.

110
00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:58.910
No,
not Avocados.

111
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.830
We're going to talk about booze and specifically how you can mitigate the damage

112
00:07:03.831 --> 00:07:07.370
that you're going to inflict on yourselves over the next few days.

113
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.910
And I'm not going to necessarily stop you from getting drunk.

114
00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:12.440
I think that's part of the fun of being here.

115
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.530
I'm not going to stop you from getting dragged out of a club yelling.

116
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.440
Do you know who I am?
You can do that too,

117
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.310
but I want to help minimize the hangovers and the missing of sessions,

118
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.530
the missing of days here because that's a real travesty.

119
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.610
So a couple of recommendations.
If you've ever time traveled on alcohol,

120
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.370
what I mean by that is you're at a club,

121
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.980
then suddenly you're at Denny's eating moons over my Hammy and you're like,

122
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:37.970
how did I get here?

123
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.650
You've experienced a lack of vasopressin.

124
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.680
Vasopressin is a hormone that is associated with short term memory and ethanol.

125
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.080
The booze inhibits its release.
All right?

126
00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:54.500
So you can compensate for that by let's say inhaling desmopressin which is a

127
00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:59.060
synthetic version.
Don't do that.
I don't recommend that.
Uh,
but you can,

128
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.550
I'll retain more water.
Or why is this key?

129
00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:03.560
Because it's also an antidiuretic hormone.

130
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.550
The reason you piss like a race horse is also related to this facet precedents.

131
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.270
And the reason you feel so hung over is because you've been dehydrated for a

132
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:15.410
long period of time.
So a very easy way to get around this,
especially in Austin,

133
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.490
is to have a bunch of guacamole before you go out.
Have some Avocados,

134
00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:21.530
has more potassium than bananas.

135
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.130
Also a bunch of things that counter inflammation.
Okay?
So super simple.

136
00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:27.620
Put a bunch of salt on it.
If you want to be indulgent,

137
00:08:27.621 --> 00:08:29.540
you can put some balsamic vinegar in the middle as well,

138
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.900
which will lower your glycemic response to the pizza that you have.

139
00:08:32.901 --> 00:08:37.670
Five pieces of when you're drunk later.
Uh,
it actually has a tremendous effect.

140
00:08:37.671 --> 00:08:40.760
Have one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you have.

141
00:08:40.761 --> 00:08:45.761
Another way that you can mitigate the damage is to have clean drinks.

142
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.020
What would be an example of a clean drink?
Well,

143
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:52.490
if you want to get as drunk as possible with the least amount of effort and the

144
00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:53.031
least hanging over,

145
00:08:53.031 --> 00:08:56.580
you could have something called the nor cal Margarita in nor cal Margarita

146
00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:01.610
popularized by a guy named Rob Wolf in the Paleo community is quite simply say

147
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.900
two shots of high great Tequila.

148
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.970
Reposado is a good choice mixed with a bunch of club soda and as much Lyme as

149
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:11.790
you can tolerate,
lemon will also work just,
it doesn't taste quite as good.

150
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.490
The club soda will allow you to absorb it very,

151
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:18.840
very quickly so you can be a cheap date.
And the the lime,

152
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.860
we'll also just like the vinegar,
inhibit your glycaemic response to food later.

153
00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:26.640
So if you end up bingeing,
you won't have a carbon insulin coma the next day.

154
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.140
All right.
The last tip related to boost,
because I think this is such a key,

155
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:36.650
a key subject to master while you're here is activated charcoal or carbon.

156
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.090
So if you want to again,

157
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.180
minimize some of the damage you could go,

158
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:45.870
try to find that probably late for a lot of you to try to do that.
Burnt toast.

159
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.040
Okay.
Eat some burnt toast before you go out.
Uh,
if that doesn't sound appealing,

160
00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:53.880
you can scrape off the burnt bits into yogurt and eat that,

161
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.580
which has actually been done in studies looking at trying to,
uh,

162
00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:01.860
alleviate overdose of Acetaminophen so it can work.
Surprisingly enough.

163
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:06.300
Burnt toast,
Avocados,
Norco,
Margarita.
There you go.
All right.

164
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.450
Who is this person and why is she very,
very important?

165
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.500
So this woman,
lovely,
lovely woman is named Miriam.

166
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:19.050
And I met Marianne when I went to ces for the first time,

167
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.380
the consumer electronic show.
I'd never made it to the trade show.

168
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:24.330
And this is highly relevant to south by southwest.

169
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.920
I instead went to a sponsored lounge,
was the Seagate blog house,

170
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.210
h a u s and it was where they gave bloggers at the time.
That was social media,

171
00:10:33.211 --> 00:10:36.870
basically gave bloggers free booze,
power outlets,

172
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.250
a place to rest and do work.

173
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.810
And I just went there and I hung out all day for several days and I had a
laptop.

174
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:46.140
So I was able to do work and I struck up casual conversations with people.
Hey,

175
00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:48.090
what's the most interesting session you've seen so far?

176
00:10:48.091 --> 00:10:51.330
Any cool products you've bumped into?
Didn't pitch anyone.

177
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:55.740
I got to spend time with Miriam because she was checking people in and we just

178
00:10:55.741 --> 00:10:59.220
very casually had got into long conversations about where we were from,

179
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:04.020
et cetera.
Now the,
the big dog at the time,
and he's still very influential,

180
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:08.220
is Robert Scoble.
So he was in the blog house.
Everyone was crowded around him,

181
00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:11.970
dozens of people vying for his attention.
And I knew I didn't stand a chance.

182
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.750
I didn't have a honed pitch for him.
I didn't even try.

183
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.210
And that's generally what I recommend.
Now.

184
00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:23.211
It turned out that Miriam is Robert's wife and Marian said,

185
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:27.600
oh yeah,
you should totally hang out with Robert.
Like here,
just like shoot me,

186
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.120
shoot me a text or send me an email and we'll just meet up when you're back in

187
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:33.660
the bay area.
Fantastic.
And so,
uh,

188
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.370
Robert ends up getting a copy of the book.

189
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.730
He sends out a short mention in a blog post.

190
00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:43.731
It takes the book to top 10 on Amazon for several days compared to morning

191
00:11:44.791 --> 00:11:48.420
television.
At the time,
which would only take it to say top 50 for several hours.

192
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:53.590
That all came about because I follow these rules.

193
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.140
Don't dismiss people,
don't be a dick and don't rush.

194
00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:00.640
Those are the three core tenants of success at an event like south by southwest.

195
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.200
Don't dismiss people.

196
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.940
You should behave here like everyone you interact with has the potential.

197
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.620
I can't wait to see the drawing for this.

198
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:14.920
Everyone has the potential to get you a cover story in the New York Times

199
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:20.350
because many of them do and it's just a good way to behave.
All right,

200
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.170
but you should behave like everyone here has a potential to get you a cover

201
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:27.520
story at the New York Times.
Uh,
don't be a dick.
Pretty self explanatory.

202
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.700
But let me give a couple of examples of all three so don't dismiss people.

203
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.240
I already gave you one.
I'll give you another one.
Specific to south by southwest.

204
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:38.860
I was going to a few movie screenings.
I went to one called big rig,

205
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.860
pretty cool movie and I was standing in line and the guy in front of me,

206
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.380
older gentleman had huge forearms.

207
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.280
And this is the kind of thing I noticed and I was like,
dude,

208
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.070
what is up with the forearms?
And we started talking.

209
00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:52.740
Turns out he's a rock climber.
We talked,
we talked,

210
00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.210
we talked about nothing business related whatsoever.

211
00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.990
It turned out to be Morgan Spurlock's brother Morgan Spurlock showed up.

212
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:03.070
Maybe 10 minutes later.
We sat right next to each other,
the movie.

213
00:13:03.071 --> 00:13:06.220
And then a few years later I ended up collaborating with him and he profiled me

214
00:13:06.221 --> 00:13:08.410
for a day in the life.
Okay.
So again,

215
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:13.390
treat everyone like they're important because they are,
uh,
don't dismiss people.

216
00:13:13.391 --> 00:13:14.800
I'll give you the converse example.

217
00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:19.150
Last year I was here with my girlfriend at the time and had dozens of people

218
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.700
basically face Paul,
my girlfriend,

219
00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:25.870
to push her out of the way to try to talk to me.
Not good politics.

220
00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.800
Uh,
don't be a dick.
Again.
Pretty explanatory.
Self explanatory.

221
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:35.650
Not Limited to men by the way.
Um,
I've seen a couple of instances where,

222
00:13:35.651 --> 00:13:36.250
for instance,

223
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:40.780
a friend was speaking to a female attendee and she asked if she could see the

224
00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:45.100
apps on his home screen.
And he did this,
she grabbed the phone,

225
00:13:45.101 --> 00:13:45.911
turned around,

226
00:13:45.911 --> 00:13:50.290
and then sent a text to her number from his phone so she would have his phone

227
00:13:50.291 --> 00:13:54.100
number.
Don't do that.
Don't rush.

228
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:58.900
This is the most important because it turns otherwise good,
reasonable,

229
00:13:58.901 --> 00:14:02.920
wonderful people into those who do the the aforementioned too.

230
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.490
Don't rush play the long game.
All right,

231
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.330
and the mission that I would like to offer to all of you,

232
00:14:10.331 --> 00:14:14.470
the job should you accept it,
is to realize that at south by southwest,

233
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:18.310
there are hundreds of people who could change your life completely.

234
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:22.780
Who could satisfy all of your wildest dreams financially,

235
00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:26.050
reputationally,
phantasmagoric Lee,

236
00:14:26.051 --> 00:14:29.950
I have no idea they can really make magic happen for you.

237
00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:35.140
And your job should be to try to have a deep human connection with one of those

238
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:39.400
people before you leave.
That's it.
It makes south by southwest.
Very,

239
00:14:39.401 --> 00:14:42.700
very manageable.
Uh,
an example of rushing,

240
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:45.700
and this has happened to be perhaps half a dozen times here at south by,

241
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.050
is the urinal encounter.
What is the urinal encounter?

242
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:54.620
It's when I'm trying to have my moment of Zen.
I'm at a urinal and I'm like,
ah,

243
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:55.850
deep breath,
deep breath,

244
00:14:55.851 --> 00:14:58.490
and I'm thinking of the penguin in the caves chilling out.
I'm like,
okay,

245
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:03.230
I'm getting ready to go back into the melee in some startup founder will come

246
00:15:03.231 --> 00:15:05.510
running up to me and skid to a stop.

247
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.870
He was like sweating cause he's nervous and starts like panting on the back of

248
00:15:08.871 --> 00:15:10.580
my neck,
giving me a bitch.

249
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:15.740
If you want to make any human male that I'm aware of,
really uncomfortable.

250
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:19.010
Wait until they're staring at a wall holding their penis and come up and breathe

251
00:15:19.011 --> 00:15:22.850
on the back of their neck.
Don't rush.
It.

252
00:15:22.851 --> 00:15:24.710
Makes good people do bad things.

253
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:31.250
I promised to crass.
Alright,
next read bio's not sessions.

254
00:15:31.251 --> 00:15:34.490
So how do you choose among all of the sessions?

255
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.310
You probably have some big fat book.
Then you're like,
oh my God,

256
00:15:37.311 --> 00:15:40.370
how am I possibly going to tackle any of this?
Number one,

257
00:15:40.371 --> 00:15:41.600
read the bio is not the sessions.

258
00:15:41.601 --> 00:15:46.010
The session titles may not tell you the whole story.
Look for interesting people,

259
00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.700
not titles of sessions.
And secondly,

260
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.240
don't just look at the people on the panel.
Look at the moderators.

261
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.330
And so what I did my first time to south by southwest is I would go to a panel,

262
00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:00.200
I would listen to these amazing people on the,
on a given panel,

263
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.620
and then I would go up not to the A-listers on the panel.
Afterwards,

264
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:04.880
I would go up to the moderator,

265
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.210
many of whom are equally impressive in their own right now.

266
00:16:08.211 --> 00:16:11.480
I would go to the moderator who is usually not nearly as mobbed,

267
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.020
and I would give them a quick explanation.
That's a,
Hey,

268
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:18.560
this is my first time at south by,
I don't know anyone,
Kinda lost,

269
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.250
just finished my first book.
It's about a,
B and c.
Uh,

270
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.610
personally I'm interested in at the time as a Brazilian Jujitsu,
this,

271
00:16:25.611 --> 00:16:26.444
this and this.

272
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.050
Is there anyone here you think I might really hit it off with anyone you think I

273
00:16:30.051 --> 00:16:33.080
should talk to?
I'm pretty good at this and this.
And they'd be like,
yeah,
sure,

274
00:16:33.081 --> 00:16:36.020
yeah,
I think a,
yeah,
you should talk to this person and this person.

275
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:41.240
And I just repeated that line of questioning over and over and over again.

276
00:16:41.241 --> 00:16:44.270
And that's how I met many of the people who led to the tipping point for the

277
00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:47.580
book and when I went up to those people who were referred,
by the way,

278
00:16:47.581 --> 00:16:51.320
I don't say so and so said,
we should really meet.
Don't,
don't oversell it.

279
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.840
Just say,
I went up to them.
I asked them this,
they said this,

280
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.360
I figured what the hell,
maybe we'd hit it off.
Can I buy you a drink?

281
00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.190
It's a very methodical way to go about tackling this delusion of sessions.

282
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.790
Next one.
Don't make an impression.
Leave a memento,

283
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.840
and I did a lot of research online,
pinged my audience on Facebook,
Twitter,

284
00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:11.540
asked for questions.
One of them was,
how do I make a positive first impression?

285
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:16.790
Your job at south by southwest is to not make a bad impression,
right?

286
00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.900
Because if all you're doing is trying to sell someone,

287
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.590
there are many different ways to do it.
Aside from coming to south by southwest,

288
00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.610
what I would recommend,
especially in an instance where you're trying to reach,

289
00:17:28.611 --> 00:17:29.990
say an a lister,
right?

290
00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:33.230
Somebody who's getting mobbed and pitched all day long like an Anthony Bordain

291
00:17:33.231 --> 00:17:36.590
or whoever it might be.
Don't try to give the pitch in person,

292
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:42.310
give them a folded up piece of paper with a page that you've painstakingly

293
00:17:42.441 --> 00:17:46.250
crafted.
That is the perfect pitch.
Include your phone number.

294
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.770
You'd be surprised how many VIP folks like to call via Skype to have a

295
00:17:50.771 --> 00:17:54.090
conversation as opposed to send you their personal email.
For instance,

296
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.720
don't make an impression.
Leave a memento.
Just say,
Hey,

297
00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:00.780
I realize you're super busy.
You've got this long line of people,

298
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.960
you're under a lot of pressure.
I've thought about this.

299
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:07.680
I think this will be of great interest to you and just give them a teaser,
right?

300
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:11.190
Like if you have an impressive number of stat,
a client who's using it,

301
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:12.960
something like that.
Here you go.

302
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.720
I hope you have a great south by read it when you're on the toilet or have an

303
00:18:15.721 --> 00:18:19.130
extra five minutes on the plane.
Thanks so much and you leave it at that.

304
00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.090
That also shows you that you know how to play the game.

305
00:18:21.091 --> 00:18:22.500
You know how busy they are.
You know,

306
00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:25.410
the stress of the dealing with and immediately that will separate you from

307
00:18:25.411 --> 00:18:29.400
everyone else as opposed to getting up and just micro machining through a pitch.

308
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.400
They won't remember even if they have spectacular memory.

309
00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:35.383
<v 0>Okay,</v>

310
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.830
<v 1>ignorance is bliss be the idiot.</v>

311
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.770
I don't have to try very hard for this one.
So the key here,

312
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:49.100
and this is mostly a problem with men in my experience or boys or guys,

313
00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:54.330
anything in between,
is we try to impress people.
So we stroll up and we're like,

314
00:18:54.331 --> 00:18:56.220
well that's a good point.
You know what's even better point.

315
00:18:56.221 --> 00:18:57.450
Or someone says something and you're like,
you know what,

316
00:18:57.451 --> 00:19:02.310
that reminds me of this story.
That one ups your story.
Don't do that.
Uh,

317
00:19:02.311 --> 00:19:03.990
and in fact you should do the opposite.

318
00:19:03.991 --> 00:19:07.650
So one of the experiences that I had and challenges that many of you will have

319
00:19:07.651 --> 00:19:11.790
is how do you get into a group conversation?
How do you interrupt people?

320
00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.770
So my rules for that are,
number one,

321
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:18.810
if it's two people who are deep in conversation,
don't interrupt.
Okay?
Remember,

322
00:19:18.811 --> 00:19:22.650
don't rush play the long game.
If it's two people just don't interrupt.

323
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:26.760
Wait if fits more people,
three,
four,
et Cetera,

324
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:31.560
you can saunter up and do what I did in 2007 which was say,
hey guys,

325
00:19:31.561 --> 00:19:34.140
do you mind if I join?
You just eavesdrop.
It's my first time here.

326
00:19:34.141 --> 00:19:36.420
I don't know anybody.
I'll buy you guys a round of drinks.

327
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.340
It's usually a place where he can get free drinks.

328
00:19:38.341 --> 00:19:42.540
So it works out really easily and they're like a,
yeah,
okay,
sure.

329
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.540
Now the reason you don't just walk up and say like,
hey guys,

330
00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:48.630
I'm just going to eaves drop is even though they're never going to say no,

331
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:52.650
at least you asked.
Be Polite.
All right.
So then they'd be like,
oh,
whatever man.

332
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:57.210
So I'd hang out and typically there'd be a lot of engineers.
I'm not a coder,

333
00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.113
not an engineer.

334
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.070
And if someone said something that I was genuinely interested in clarifying,

335
00:20:02.071 --> 00:20:03.570
so they'd be like,
well we did Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

336
00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:06.810
And of course we ended up with ruby on rails and I'd say,
you know,

337
00:20:06.811 --> 00:20:10.320
I'm really sorry to interrupt,
but I'm deep in the ignorance pool here.

338
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.680
Why was ruby on rails the obvious choice?
I don't know what it is,

339
00:20:13.681 --> 00:20:15.360
but why was it such an obvious advantage?

340
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:19.830
And that will oftentimes spark a debate,
a debate among the people in that group.

341
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.610
And so every once in a while you throw out one of these questions again being

342
00:20:23.611 --> 00:20:27.270
the idiot,
which is what good NPR host also do by the way.

343
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.650
And eventually someone will say,
Oh wait,
who the hell are you again?

344
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:36.510
Like what's your story?
And then you give them the shortest answer possible.

345
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:41.050
Do not launch into a really rushed long ass pitch.
So I would say,
well,
you know,

346
00:20:41.051 --> 00:20:45.210
it's,
it's my first time here and I just finished my first book.

347
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.430
And the publishers basically controlling everything except for digital.

348
00:20:48.431 --> 00:20:50.950
So I'm here to try to figure it out.
Pause.

349
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.840
Then you wait to see who asks if they do,
what's it about?
Great.

350
00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:58.420
And then you say,
well,
it's about this,
this and this.

351
00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.450
But I think most people here probably find this interesting.

352
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.230
And you see who digs deeper.
All right.
You'll see the logic to this in a second.

353
00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:06.850
So let's just say you have a group of six people.

354
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.510
There's one person who has expressed extreme interest by digging and digging.

355
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.330
In the case of the four hour work week,
maybe they're interested in world travel,

356
00:21:13.331 --> 00:21:17.020
virtual assistants,
that type of thing.
Then at the very end,
you know,

357
00:21:17.021 --> 00:21:20.830
we'd bounce around and talk about all sorts of subjects and that's the,
you know,

358
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.920
uh,
zero pressure.

359
00:21:23.921 --> 00:21:26.740
I would never expect you to write about it or do anything like that,

360
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.820
but I have a bunch of promotional copies from the publisher.

361
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
I could very easily just tab the 15 to 20 pages that I think you would find most

362
00:21:36.941 --> 00:21:38.770
interesting based on what we just talked about.

363
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.770
And I can mail it to you and you know,
you can use it as a doorstop if you want.

364
00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:47.770
And because I'd already honed down to the point where I knew who was interested,

365
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.520
I would say probably 90% of those folks said,
yes,

366
00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:52.810
we're enthusiastic about it.

367
00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.490
And then at least half of them ended up promoting it in some way because they

368
00:21:57.491 --> 00:22:01.450
loved it,
not because I asked them to do it.
Does that make sense?

369
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.520
And if you say no strings attached,

370
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.460
do not fucking followup and bugged the shit out of them.

371
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:10.690
It's a great way to get a huge amount of negative backlash.

372
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.580
Don't do it and we'll come back to that.

373
00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:17.581
But I tend to do very little followup except for something people have asked for

374
00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.290
because people get enough email as it is.

375
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:26.770
Don't be a traffic bigot.
What does this mean?
This means that you may be,

376
00:22:26.771 --> 00:22:30.670
if you have something to promote,
if you have a service websites,
start up book,

377
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.040
album,
whatever it might be,
movie,

378
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.600
you might be tempted to go straight for the person who has the biggest
megaphone,

379
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.150
the biggest site,
the most Twitter followers.
And the,

380
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.230
the problem with that is that you are going to be one of a thousand people who

381
00:22:44.231 --> 00:22:48.550
pitch this person while they're here.
It 99.9% of the time,

382
00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.880
it won't work.
You can try.
There's no harm in doing it tactfully.

383
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:53.080
It usually won't work.

384
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:58.030
What I did in 2007 and there were blog rolls at the time.
Do you remember those?

385
00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:02.350
Uh,
is I tried to figure out,
and you can ask people right upfront,

386
00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.570
moderators are good people to ask as well.

387
00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.470
Who Do these people view as a thought leader?
Okay,

388
00:23:08.471 --> 00:23:12.190
so you have this group of 10 traffic leaders.
Who Do they read?

389
00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.790
Who are the niche folks that they read,
who were very influential,

390
00:23:15.791 --> 00:23:18.940
who are the thought leaders?
And then you approached the thought leaders,

391
00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:23.800
invite them out to a drink and you do the same thing that I just described and

392
00:23:23.801 --> 00:23:26.890
be very,
very candid.
Basically do like the puss in boots,
you know,

393
00:23:26.891 --> 00:23:30.430
holding the hat with the big eyes.
And uh,

394
00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.930
and it's amazing what miracles can come of that because if you get covered by

395
00:23:34.931 --> 00:23:37.810
one of those thought leaders in an interview,
for instance,
or anything like that,

396
00:23:37.811 --> 00:23:41.530
or you send them an exclusive excerpt,
even though they have a small site,

397
00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.650
you send them an exclusive excerpt of the book.
What happens?

398
00:23:44.651 --> 00:23:47.270
They put it up and you're like,
AH,
who cares?
20,000 readers.

399
00:23:47.271 --> 00:23:49.790
But guess who those 20,000 readers are?
Okay?

400
00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:53.150
It's like being in front of 20,000 Ted Attendees.
Okay,

401
00:23:53.151 --> 00:23:54.440
so don't be a traffic bigot.

402
00:23:55.130 --> 00:24:00.130
And I would also say that don't necessarily focus on the people who you perceive

403
00:24:00.261 --> 00:24:04.940
as the a listers are VIP.
Now try to find the pre VIP is,

404
00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:10.190
does that make sense?
You're trying to find the up and comers.
So you ask again,

405
00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.840
ask people who've been here a few times,

406
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:15.530
who are the best like up and coming hot designers,
you know the,
the,

407
00:24:15.531 --> 00:24:17.750
the folks that are not very well known,

408
00:24:17.751 --> 00:24:20.210
who should be well known or who are the hot dog,

409
00:24:20.211 --> 00:24:23.480
the hot up and coming filmmakers who haven't had any press,
who were they?

410
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:28.670
Go meet those people.
And by the way,
if you did that just in safe film,

411
00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.560
but you're actually based in tech,

412
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:34.370
you did that and film you met the best up and comers,
the best up and comers.

413
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:37.970
No one another.
The best VIP is an A-listers.
No one another.

414
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:42.740
It's not industry specific.
Okay,
so don't be a traffic bigot.

415
00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:48.350
They'll also have a much better time while you're here.
Questions for a listers.

416
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.830
So if you're like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
All right.
Ferris,
you know,
I'm still,

417
00:24:51.831 --> 00:24:54.980
I'm still going to go for the gold.
I'm going to sprint up to,
you know,

418
00:24:54.981 --> 00:24:59.780
Al Gore and give them a pitch.
Well,
how should you do it?
What are the questions?

419
00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:01.970
What are the ice breakers for the a listers?

420
00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:06.650
And the first rule as far as I'm concerned,

421
00:25:06.651 --> 00:25:08.660
is ask if they have a second.

422
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.230
Don't just run up and pitch because a great pitch,

423
00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:16.070
the perfect pitch at a bad time is a bad pitch.

424
00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:19.790
It won't work.
And like I said at the beginning,

425
00:25:19.791 --> 00:25:21.050
it's not about making a good impression.

426
00:25:21.051 --> 00:25:23.780
That's about not making a bad impression.
If you make a bad impression,

427
00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:27.800
they won't want to communicate with you later,
even if you correct things.
Okay.

428
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:31.130
So Mr Ms. May may bother you for 30 seconds.

429
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:35.570
Mr Ms x is now an okay time for one question.
If you say that,

430
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.830
don't ask three questions.
One question.
Uh,

431
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.470
now number two and number three here actually worked very well together.

432
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.320
You know,
Mr and Mrs x is now an okay time for one question.

433
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:50.090
Who on your team could I email about whatever you're interested in?
Okay.

434
00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:51.980
They're not going to give you their personal email,

435
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.860
they're not going to give you their personal phone number usually,

436
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:57.590
and it's going to make them very uncomfortable to say no.

437
00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.660
So realize that and ask about their team.

438
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.710
That will immediately put you in the pro category as opposed to the amateur

439
00:26:03.711 --> 00:26:07.550
category.
And another thing,
if you're in a group,

440
00:26:07.551 --> 00:26:09.710
let's just say at a book signing or something like that,
you have to realize,

441
00:26:09.711 --> 00:26:12.650
even if they wanted to give you their personal email phone,

442
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:15.170
they can't say it out loud because 10 other people are gonna hear it.

443
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.620
So who on your team could email about blah?

444
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.120
And if they have entourage around them,

445
00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:25.580
meaning let's just say you go to a book signing for,
fill in the blank,

446
00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:29.330
right?
Michael Pollan,
and you see someone who's just kind of patiently waiting,

447
00:26:29.331 --> 00:26:30.380
they're 10 feet away.

448
00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:35.680
That is probably his publicist or his publisher or someone along those lines get

449
00:26:36.771 --> 00:26:37.604
to know them.

450
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:42.110
They are probably the gateway to communication with Mr Pollen.

451
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.820
So you don't have to pitch directly.

452
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.350
And this relates to everything I've just said.

453
00:26:49.351 --> 00:26:50.580
I'm not gonna spend a ton of time on it,

454
00:26:50.581 --> 00:26:55.140
but you have to prove the messenger before the message you are the Messenger.

455
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:56.071
So for instance,

456
00:26:56.071 --> 00:27:01.071
I had a startup come up to me while I was headed to this room today and uh,

457
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:04.620
I'm not going to mention the company name,

458
00:27:04.621 --> 00:27:08.250
but they came up and the first thing they said was,
hey,

459
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:10.470
your assistant hasn't replied to my emails.

460
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:17.010
So I'm like,
what do you expect me to respond with?

461
00:27:17.011 --> 00:27:21.060
How do you want me to respond to that?
Uh,
I get a lot of emails.
I don't know.

462
00:27:21.061 --> 00:27:23.910
You know,
my assistant is pretty good.
I had a,
he ain't,
I dunno.

463
00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.940
And then his buddy with them,
it's like,
yeah,
Mr Four hours,

464
00:27:29.941 --> 00:27:32.480
like give me some four hour equip.
And I'm like,
if,

465
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.530
and then he gave me his business card and I'm like,
all right,

466
00:27:34.531 --> 00:27:35.550
if I go to your site,

467
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.250
let's just say it's the most amazing sight I've ever seen in my life.

468
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.760
Am I going to want to be associated with that so that he can go up to somebody

469
00:27:41.761 --> 00:27:44.550
else?
And be like,
yeah,
Ms. Dot.
Polin Mr Ferris works with us.

470
00:27:44.551 --> 00:27:47.430
And that was like or no,
hell no.
That would destroy my reputation.

471
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:49.440
So you just screwed the pooch.
All right,

472
00:27:49.441 --> 00:27:52.920
so be a good messenger before you deliver the message.

473
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:55.470
It doesn't matter how good the pitches,
if you fuck it up first

474
00:27:57.450 --> 00:27:58.320
f bombs are coming.

475
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.160
How to pick people out of a crowd.
These are all related.

476
00:28:03.161 --> 00:28:06.390
The questions that I get repeatedly,
how do you pick someone out in a crowd?

477
00:28:06.391 --> 00:28:08.430
You're scanning the room.
You want to work the room.
Number one,

478
00:28:08.431 --> 00:28:11.640
don't work the room.
Number two,
if you had to pick people out of the crowd,

479
00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:15.510
I would say go for the most relaxed,
unrushed looking person.

480
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:21.150
Not necessarily the a listers surrounded by a huge Phalynx of people,

481
00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:25.140
if that's the right word.
Because unless you just want to listen.

482
00:28:25.141 --> 00:28:27.210
If you want to listen,
that's fine,
but you're not gonna get a lot of airtime.

483
00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:30.390
Look for the most relaxed people in the room there.
They either have very,

484
00:28:30.391 --> 00:28:34.170
very little going on or they've kind of already made it and they don't feel

485
00:28:34.171 --> 00:28:38.130
rushed.
So hit or miss.
But if you have to pick people out of the crowd,

486
00:28:38.131 --> 00:28:42.950
I would say go for the most relaxed unrushed looking person.
Alright.

487
00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:46.890
Icebreakers in general and as a preface to this,

488
00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.520
and I know you're reading the slide while I talk,
that's okay.
Uh,

489
00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:54.960
the small talk is the big talk.
All right,
I'll repeat that.

490
00:28:54.961 --> 00:28:57.570
The small talk is the big talk.
What that means is,

491
00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:02.760
and that is an expression that has been said to me in many different words.

492
00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:05.400
You know,
small talk is everything by friends of mine,

493
00:29:05.401 --> 00:29:08.580
like a Ido Leffler who's a cofounder of yes to carrots.

494
00:29:08.581 --> 00:29:13.140
They're distributed more than 30,000 locations.
And the point that he would make,

495
00:29:13.141 --> 00:29:16.350
and the point that I would also make is that if you're just going to pitch

496
00:29:16.351 --> 00:29:17.184
people,

497
00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:22.350
you can probably do that in a more effective way by staying at home,

498
00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:25.080
not coming to Austin and just sending out cold pitches,

499
00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:28.560
working on your email skill here in person,

500
00:29:28.561 --> 00:29:32.640
you have an opportunity to dig deeper and talk about other things.

501
00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.070
That is how you become memorable.

502
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.730
That is how you have that one deep human connection that I was talking about.

503
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.820
So instead of asking what do you do,

504
00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:46.150
and there are people who will ask that of you and you can be like,
Whoa,

505
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:48.190
shoot a lot of heroin or what about you?
That's a good way to

506
00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:49.213
<v 0>end it.</v>

507
00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:54.980
<v 1>Or you can give it a really boring answer and like,
ah,</v>

508
00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.280
sometimes I'll just be like,
yeah,
I'm a freelance writer.
You know,

509
00:29:57.281 --> 00:29:59.990
I was still trying to make it work.
And they're like,
ah,

510
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.200
they're already scanning for their next prey.

511
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.670
So instead of what do you do,
what do you ask?

512
00:30:07.671 --> 00:30:10.670
And I understand why this is difficult because people are like,
ah,
I don't know.

513
00:30:10.671 --> 00:30:12.890
And then they come up with something like if you could be a breakfast cereal,

514
00:30:12.891 --> 00:30:14.690
what breakfast cereal would you be?
And people are like,

515
00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.330
that's Kinda what the hell is happening.
So don't do that.

516
00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:24.440
You can make it pretty natural.
So for instance,
if you ask,
oh,
so and so,
Hey,

517
00:30:24.441 --> 00:30:26.840
nice to meet you,
where are you from?
And they say,
Oh,
I'm from New York City.

518
00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:30.440
Are you from New York City originally?
Say No,
I'm from Cincinnati.

519
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:33.920
Well how do you get from head ended up going from Cincinnati and New York City?

520
00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:36.650
You're going to get all the information you could possibly need for context.

521
00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.110
Okay,
boom,
you've got it.

522
00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:42.290
And you'll oftentimes have a very good personal story to go with it.

523
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:45.560
All right now if you don't want to do that or later on,

524
00:30:45.561 --> 00:30:48.440
if you want to sort of expand a little bit,
you could ask,
you know,

525
00:30:48.441 --> 00:30:49.940
what session are you most excited about?

526
00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.210
What's been your favorite session so far?
If it's a few days from now,

527
00:30:53.211 --> 00:30:55.610
for instance,
you know,
what are you most excited about these days?

528
00:30:55.910 --> 00:31:00.050
And it's not that you can't talk about work,
but you can do that anywhere.

529
00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:04.910
The any medium in person is a unique opportunity.

530
00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.640
So optimize for meat space.

531
00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:13.160
Take advantage of the fact you probably have some booze involved and you have a

532
00:31:13.161 --> 00:31:14.600
chance to talk about the personal stuff.

533
00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:20.320
How do escape slash pause conversations?
So,
you know,

534
00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.690
what do you do if you get cornered by someone's selling timeshares?

535
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:27.570
Or what do you do if someone is just on meth and will not start talking about

536
00:31:27.571 --> 00:31:31.140
their startup and they're just going and going and going?
What do you do?
Well,

537
00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:32.340
I would say a few things and I,

538
00:31:32.341 --> 00:31:36.060
and I put escape slash pause because I think pause is the better way to think

539
00:31:36.061 --> 00:31:40.200
about it.
You could try to pull the bathroom maneuver.

540
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:44.970
People always try this,
uh,
and it can work and be like,
you know,
that's awesome.

541
00:31:44.971 --> 00:31:47.040
So fascinating.
I really have to go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

542
00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:50.670
The dangers of doing that,
number one,
if you don't come back,

543
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.990
you kind of look like a dick.
So violates the don't be a dick role.
Uh,

544
00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:56.070
if you don't even go to the bathroom,
if you're like,
yes,

545
00:31:56.071 --> 00:31:56.890
I need to go to the bathroom,

546
00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:59.340
then you just walk 20 feet and then just start talking to someone.

547
00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:03.870
They're going to be like,
picture at So-and-so.
What did Dick so don't do that.

548
00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:08.520
Uh,
the easiest way to do it,
you don't have to make up.
So,
oh my God,

549
00:32:08.521 --> 00:32:10.890
my house is on fire,
my wife is going,
I have to go.
You don't have to do that.

550
00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:15.150
You can just say,
and this is what I do and I do this with people I find very,

551
00:32:15.151 --> 00:32:17.100
very interesting.
Also,
if it's just like,
okay,

552
00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:19.650
we've been talking for an hour in your head,
you're thinking this,

553
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.190
I just want to wander around a little bit.
Say that.
So you asked them,
hey,

554
00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:26.790
you know,
James or whatever,
you know.
Hey James,

555
00:32:26.791 --> 00:32:30.510
you're going to be here for the rest of the,
uh,
for the rest of south by,

556
00:32:30.511 --> 00:32:32.070
are you gonna be here for a couple of days?
Yeah,

557
00:32:32.071 --> 00:32:34.500
I'm going to be here for the next two days.
Cool.
Well,

558
00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.240
do you have a card or something?
I'd love to connect,

559
00:32:36.241 --> 00:32:39.470
but I just want to wander around.
Maybe take a little breather,
grab a cup,
coffee.

560
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:43.850
You're done.
That's great.
It's polite.
It's honest.
That's all you have to do.

561
00:32:43.851 --> 00:32:45.410
Are you going to be here for the rest of south by?

562
00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:48.770
Are you gonna be here for the next couple of days?
Cool.
Can I get your card?

563
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.500
Greatest?
Want to wander around?
Take a break,
hit the bathroom,

564
00:32:51.501 --> 00:32:53.600
grab a cup of coffee,
but I'm sure I'll see you around.

565
00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:57.710
Nobody's offended and you accomplish the purpose of pausing the conversation.

566
00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.750
Next follow up.
All right,
so during the event,
after the event,

567
00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:06.780
how do you follow up?
Uh,
first of all,

568
00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:11.940
don't do anything to keep in touch.
It will just make enemies.
All right?

569
00:33:11.941 --> 00:33:15.330
You don't need to paying busy people.
Just be like,
hey,
how's it going?

570
00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:20.700
How are you doing?
You know,
I imagine that you are calling them at like 3:00 PM.

571
00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.460
All right?
So you call them.
They're like,
as an investment banker running around,

572
00:33:23.461 --> 00:33:25.650
Oh my God,
you're a startup.
You're like,
we need an underwriter.

573
00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.980
So you call this busy and this isn't bagger.
At 3:00 PM,
you're like,
Hey John,

574
00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:33.730
it's uh,
it's Tim from south by Zach,
uh,
Tim,
Tim Ferris.
Hey Doug,

575
00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:39.510
how's it going today?
Don't do that.
It's just be like,
what the fuck?

576
00:33:39.511 --> 00:33:40.980
I'm really busy.
Hey,
don't do that.

577
00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:47.030
So follow up is a dish best served cold but I mean by this is most people are

578
00:33:47.431 --> 00:33:51.960
going to walk out of south by pockets full of business cards,
big ideas,

579
00:33:51.961 --> 00:33:55.050
people to follow up with paypal,
the Pang brains to pick.

580
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:57.420
Don't ever ask anybody if you can pick their brain over coffee by the way.

581
00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:02.370
But that's a separate story.
So follow up.
Wait two weeks.
Okay,

582
00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:05.850
wait two weeks.
Why two weeks?
Because if you do it now,

583
00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.820
it's going to get lost in the avalanche of similar stuff.

584
00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:12.030
If you do it right after south by,
it'll be even worse.

585
00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:14.820
You're going to get lost in it.
Another hundred followup email.

586
00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:19.890
So it takes people time to catch up from neglecting other things during south by

587
00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:22.890
wait two weeks.
And then in terms of time,

588
00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:28.080
I would do it on a Wednesday afternoon their time or a Friday afternoon.

589
00:34:28.410 --> 00:34:30.390
Their time.
Sunday night also works pretty well.

590
00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:34.350
So for responses from Max response rate and read rate,

591
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:36.840
those tend to be the times that I find most effective.

592
00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.500
Play the long game,
play the long game.

593
00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.130
All this means is you don't have to rush.
Why?

594
00:34:45.131 --> 00:34:49.960
Because you just have to have one deep human connection with one person.

595
00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:55.510
That's it.
If you can accomplish that and develop a longterm relationship,

596
00:34:56.410 --> 00:34:59.170
you can potentially never have to network again.

597
00:34:59.171 --> 00:35:00.670
I know that sounds like an exaggeration,

598
00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:04.690
but if you look back at the people I spent the most time with in 2007

599
00:35:04.691 --> 00:35:06.580
realistically you probably,

600
00:35:06.581 --> 00:35:10.900
it'd be able to have a couple of these human interactions try to get out of
tech.

601
00:35:10.901 --> 00:35:12.540
By the way,
don't do all tech.

602
00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:17.170
If you look at the people I spent the most time with in 2007 but 90% of them,

603
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.930
this is 2007 what does that seven years ago,
my God,

604
00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:22.420
there's still some of my closest friends to this day.

605
00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:27.460
That is what you want because if you don't do that,
you play the short game.

606
00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:31.570
You have to then do this very time consuming,

607
00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:32.980
very energy consuming,

608
00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:38.250
very likely to offend a transactional stuff every for the rest of your life.

609
00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:42.750
Do you really want to do that?
No.
No you don't.
So play the long game guys.

610
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.970
That is it for my formal presentation.

611
00:35:44.971 --> 00:35:48.960
So I am going to open it up to the rest of Twitter Q and.
A.

612
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:52.860
But I hope you all have a wonderful,
wonderful experience to south by southwest.

613
00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:57.150
If you do it right,
it will change your life.
So again,

614
00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.700
just in summary,
don't dismiss people,

615
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:03.150
don't be a dick and Dora rush play the long game.
Thank you.

616
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.000
<v 3>Thanks so much Tim.</v>

617
00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.470
If you guys have specific questions that you want to ask,

618
00:36:18.471 --> 00:36:21.530
if you want to Hashtag your tweet with ask Tim,

619
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:25.550
we will pull them up and he will answer all of your lovely questions,

620
00:36:25.551 --> 00:36:30.551
concerns ponderings I and here is our first question.

621
00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.260
I really should have worn my glasses for this.

622
00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:38.060
<v 1>I can read it.
All right,
so this is from Wendy Perry.
Uh,</v>

623
00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:39.421
can you guys read this is,

624
00:36:39.421 --> 00:36:41.700
well maybe I don't have to read all of these but I will just for those who are

625
00:36:41.701 --> 00:36:44.280
getting this on audio,
after I read the four hour work week,
years ago,

626
00:36:44.281 --> 00:36:47.880
I took my family on a mini break once a month.
Can you have too many?
This is,

627
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:51.720
this is in reference to mini retirements and taking these sabbaticals.

628
00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:54.510
So distributing retirement throughout life as opposed to

629
00:36:56.190 --> 00:37:00.420
waiting until say 50,
60,
72,
uh,

630
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:05.100
to load it up at that point.
Uh,
I think that this is a deeply personal question.

631
00:37:05.101 --> 00:37:09.540
So in terms of mini retirements,
I tried to take one to three months,

632
00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:12.990
usually two to three months of these mini sabbaticals per year.

633
00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:17.430
I think that if you use these mini retirements as a way of postponing other

634
00:37:17.431 --> 00:37:20.500
important decisions,
and of course it could be too many.
So the,

635
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:25.380
if you look at your to do list and usually the most uncomfortable item is the

636
00:37:25.381 --> 00:37:27.960
most important.
If you're using these trips to avoid that,

637
00:37:27.961 --> 00:37:31.680
then I'd say it's too many.
All right.
Next is from Zachary Barker.

638
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:35.340
If you were launching a new company with only a thousand dollars to get started,

639
00:37:35.341 --> 00:37:38.780
what would you start?
So we get a lot,
I get a lot of questions like this.

640
00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.700
It's like,
um,
if you had no connections and no money,

641
00:37:41.701 --> 00:37:43.530
how would you make $100,000 in the next quarter?

642
00:37:43.531 --> 00:37:46.710
And what business would you start?
Uh,

643
00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:50.670
this is a question of what I would say.

644
00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:54.960
I'd spend the first $10 getting the 22 immutable laws of marketing and now to

645
00:37:54.961 --> 00:37:58.470
figure out which market you're going after first and then design your product.

646
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:03.800
And specifically I would also read 1000 true fans by Kevin Kelly and identify

647
00:38:04.141 --> 00:38:05.010
who your,

648
00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:10.290
what the demographic and psychographic is of the thousand people you want to

649
00:38:10.291 --> 00:38:13.260
have us die hard fans first and foremost.
Non Celebrities.

650
00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:17.550
In my case with the four hour work week,
I knew that my first market,

651
00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:18.600
not my entire market,

652
00:38:18.601 --> 00:38:23.130
but my first market would be 25 to 40 year old tech savvy males in New York City

653
00:38:23.131 --> 00:38:25.830
and San Francisco.
How do I reach those people?

654
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:29.430
How can I seem say ubiquitous by being on five websites when in fact I'm not

655
00:38:29.431 --> 00:38:32.310
ubiquitous,
I'm just everywhere that they happened to look.
Okay.

656
00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.970
That's where I would start.
But I can't say,
you know,

657
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.230
<v 4>put all your money in bitcoin or something like that,
which I think,
uh,</v>

658
00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.380
it would be dangerous,
especially if you only have 1000 bucks.

659
00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:46.390
So test often test small.
I think Facebook is a great place to thin slice,
but,
uh,

660
00:38:46.391 --> 00:38:51.070
that would be my advice.
Do you meditate or do yoga?

661
00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:52.510
Uh,
I do meditate.

662
00:38:52.511 --> 00:38:57.130
I meditate almost every morning for ideally 20 minutes.

663
00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:01.570
It's only something that I've done consistently for the last year or so.

664
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:07.210
All right.
Uh,
and uh,
I personally use TM,

665
00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:10.060
transcendental meditation.
I find some of the gurus stuff a little woo.

666
00:39:10.061 --> 00:39:13.750
I'm not for that,
but just the repetition of a sound I find very,

667
00:39:13.751 --> 00:39:18.100
very effective as opposed to say concentrative meditation,
uh,
or,
uh,

668
00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:22.660
other types of Vipassana also very,
very helpful.
Um,
I am not a,

669
00:39:22.661 --> 00:39:26.100
I don't do a lot of yoga.
I become fascinated with acro yoga,

670
00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:30.040
which is more like a Cirque de Solei strength performance than anything else.

671
00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:34.900
But those are the two I meditate a lot more than I do yoga.
Uh,
Anthony Blattner,

672
00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:39.190
how do you find the good events and parties instead of the overpacked events?

673
00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:43.930
Uh,
good events and parties.
All right.
So I plan my sessions,

674
00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.560
although there's room to improvise,
I let the parties pick me.

675
00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:50.170
What that means is I choose the sessions,

676
00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:54.100
I interact with people in the way that I described.
And then you just ask,
okay,

677
00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:58.360
try to have some spontaneity and just wander around and get lost.

678
00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:02.360
In terms of events,
if we're talking about conferences in general,
um,

679
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.350
this is going to sound haphazard,

680
00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:09.360
but my policy has generally been go to at least one event per year,

681
00:40:09.401 --> 00:40:11.650
which is the most expensive event you can afford to go to.

682
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.690
You're going to end up with a smaller crowd.

683
00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:18.340
And I find that at least interesting to experiment with.
Uh,

684
00:40:18.341 --> 00:40:21.750
but obviously you don't want to bet the farm on it.
Uh,

685
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:24.430
next question from a littlest gator.

686
00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:29.520
And I like that name.
If you've ever heard little baby alligators,

687
00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:32.470
like a rare,
rare when they're calling their mother,
it's amazing.

688
00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:35.000
I really want this guy to make that noise.
All right.

689
00:40:35.001 --> 00:40:39.160
And now that you are a big deal,
what are your goals at South by southwest?
Um,

690
00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:42.310
I don't think I'm a big deal compared to a lot of folks,

691
00:40:42.311 --> 00:40:45.160
but my goal is to south by southwest.
Honestly,
I,

692
00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:50.230
I was offered the opportunity to do how to rock south by southwest.

693
00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:52.240
And I feel a huge debt of gratitude to south by,

694
00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:56.290
I think it's one of the most incredible events out there.
And if you do it right,

695
00:40:56.291 --> 00:40:59.380
it can be totally life changing.
So I don't have,
I don't have a new book,

696
00:40:59.381 --> 00:41:01.450
I don't have a new thing to promote this time around.

697
00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:02.950
It's really just to have fun,

698
00:41:02.951 --> 00:41:07.270
eat some barbecue and hopefully allow you guys to do the same.
Next.

699
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:11.400
Mark Marshall or Michelle,
uh,

700
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:13.180
what thought leaders do you follow

701
00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:20.220
or are there specific writers,
bloggers that I read?
Uh,

702
00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.510
right now at this point in time,
uh,
there,

703
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:23.980
there's some very interesting folks out there.

704
00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:27.580
I mean a Nasim Tala is one that comes to mind immediately.

705
00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:32.770
But in terms of reading,
I'm trying to actually read really old ideas right now.

706
00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:35.540
So trying to focus on books that had been around for a hundred plus years

707
00:41:35.541 --> 00:41:39.720
whenever possible.
Uh,
because uh,
in a,
in a,
in an age of,

708
00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:40.580
of Femora.

709
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:45.740
And is it a neo mania and float and obsession with the new,
the new,
the new.

710
00:41:45.741 --> 00:41:50.050
I like ideas that have stood the test of time for awhile.
How do I stay focused?

711
00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:55.910
I'm not convinced I am focused,
but meditation helps a lot.

712
00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:59.420
Uh,
and really the purpose of that session in the morning,

713
00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:03.620
I might just be thinking of like some guy cut me off in the salad line and

714
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:07.340
college that I want to like punch in the nose for 19 minutes of that.

715
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:10.880
But if I'm thinking of that and I'm like not productive and then I go back to

716
00:42:10.881 --> 00:42:12.410
what I'm supposed to be doing just once,

717
00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:16.460
that will translate to being able to do the same thing in your normal life.

718
00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:20.910
So I think that's very,
very helpful.
In terms of books on meditation,
uh,

719
00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:27.470
the first book by Tick Not Hun,
is very,
very good.
All right,

720
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.830
melody towel.
How do you deal with criticism?

721
00:42:30.831 --> 00:42:35.240
You get for not replying to email right away?
You know what,
I'm going to,

722
00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:35.870
I'm going to head,

723
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:39.260
I'm going to dodge this one just because I answered it at length in the four

724
00:42:39.261 --> 00:42:43.590
hour workweek.
Um,
so I apologize guys,
but that's a long,
long answer so that,

725
00:42:43.591 --> 00:42:45.400
that one we're going to save for the four hour work.

726
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:48.680
I'm sure it's on torrent somewhere if somebody wants to read it for free,
uh,

727
00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:52.220
or her.
But Morielle question,

728
00:42:52.221 --> 00:42:55.370
what part of your four hour work week do you personally find hardest to follow?

729
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:59.450
What I've found hardest and what I still find hardest to saying.
No.

730
00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:04.040
You have to say no to a thousand things before you can say yes to the one big

731
00:43:04.041 --> 00:43:07.070
thing that's going to change your life.
And I still find that difficult.

732
00:43:07.071 --> 00:43:11.900
I think we all like people to like us and some people take it very personally

733
00:43:11.901 --> 00:43:13.580
when you don't get back,
get back to them quickly.

734
00:43:13.581 --> 00:43:16.850
Like this startup founder kind of accosted me outside.
It's like,

735
00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:20.510
and I feel badly,
uh,
but at the same time I'm just like,

736
00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:23.780
try to walk a mile in my shoes.
If you could just think about it,

737
00:43:23.781 --> 00:43:25.130
because I used to take it personally too.

738
00:43:25.131 --> 00:43:27.440
I'd send an email to a really busy person.
They would never respond to be like,

739
00:43:27.441 --> 00:43:28.550
wow,
what a dick.

740
00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:33.590
You have to try to imagine yourself in their shoes.

741
00:43:33.591 --> 00:43:37.070
And the reality is they're getting thousands of email,
thousands of pitches.

742
00:43:37.071 --> 00:43:40.220
I probably 90% of the interactions I have at south by southwest,

743
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:41.600
we'll be people pitching me.

744
00:43:41.601 --> 00:43:45.560
So just imagine how that would feel and how tiring it would be before,
uh,

745
00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:49.400
taking it personally.
But I still find saying no quite challenging.
Uh,

746
00:43:49.401 --> 00:43:53.210
Ryan Bond Heart.
How do I want people to remember me?
Uh,

747
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:57.770
I would say I don't need people to remember me.
If they remember the ideas,

748
00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.810
that would be fantastic.
Um,

749
00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:02.840
most of which I've borrowed from other people or just collected.

750
00:44:02.841 --> 00:44:07.841
But I would say that my goal is to be a world class teacher and to create people

751
00:44:08.841 --> 00:44:13.430
who are better than I am.
So if I can create armies,

752
00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:15.170
thousands,
tens of thousands,

753
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:18.630
millions of people who are worldclass learners and in turn can be worldclass

754
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:23.390
teachers then and better than I am.
Which is necessary,

755
00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.640
then,
uh,
I think the world be a better place.

756
00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:28.770
So hopefully that's something I can do.
John Adelai,

757
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:33.300
what tricks do you have for retaining info?
If it's factual,

758
00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:37.740
declarative information,
facts and figures?
Uh,

759
00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.970
there's a book written by a gentleman named Higbee,

760
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:44.400
I think it's called your memory and how to improve it,

761
00:44:44.401 --> 00:44:49.401
but the last name is Higbee mnemonic devices as used by Cicero and for several

762
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:54.330
thousand years work really well.
Ed Cook,
c.
O.
O.
K.
E also fascinating guy,

763
00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.180
a worldclass memory competitor.
I interviewed on the podcast.

764
00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:02.910
What's the next project book that I'm working on?
Well,

765
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:07.350
uh,
more details to come shortly,
but uh,
well okay,
I'll give you guys some,

766
00:45:07.351 --> 00:45:09.000
some breaking news.
No one knows this.

767
00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:14.480
I was able to negotiate back the rights for a TV show that I filmed sometime ago

768
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:20.510
and I will be digitally distributing the Tim Ferriss experiment to the,

769
00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:24.540
well,
I would like to say the world,
there are some constraints geographically,

770
00:45:24.541 --> 00:45:28.620
but I will be distributing it and making it available to as many people as

771
00:45:28.621 --> 00:45:33.030
humanly possible in the next few months.
So that's,
that's very exciting for me.

772
00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:39.120
Hopefully I can come back to south by next year and do something in the film

773
00:45:39.121 --> 00:45:41.580
track and talk about these new avenues for distribution,

774
00:45:41.581 --> 00:45:44.480
which I think are really exciting.
Uh,
homeless coder.
That's the grant.

775
00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:51.180
Uh,
it's funny,
I saw a guy,
I saw a guy two days ago in San Francisco.

776
00:45:51.181 --> 00:45:54.330
He was like slow motion karate,
chopping this tree.

777
00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:59.730
And in my mind I was like either that guys high as balls on Lsd or he's coming

778
00:46:00.811 --> 00:46:02.670
up with the next billion dollar idea.
It,
he's a coder.

779
00:46:02.671 --> 00:46:04.980
It's gotta be one of the two homeless gutter.

780
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.660
You've advocated mini retirements and travel.

781
00:46:06.661 --> 00:46:10.780
Where's the best place in the world besides Austin?
I,
you know,
it,

782
00:46:10.781 --> 00:46:13.240
this is like what's the best pair of shoes in the world?
You,

783
00:46:13.241 --> 00:46:15.930
you have to find a pair that fits.
And it's not the same for everybody.

784
00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:19.650
Some people like those crazy like pointy witch of the west shoes.

785
00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.070
I've seen a lot of guys in those.
Not My thing.
You know,
I'm,

786
00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:26.430
I'm not like a flip flop guy.
Uh,
I love Japan.

787
00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:31.620
I have a huge affinity for Japan.
I lived there for a year in high school.

788
00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:35.340
That's,
that's the Argentine is a lot of fun too.

789
00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:40.350
It's amazing how they can get anything done.
There's beautiful areas,
people,

790
00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:42.960
a great wine,
great steak.

791
00:46:42.961 --> 00:46:47.961
Japan is amazing because it is a place where you can be completely confused and

792
00:46:49.561 --> 00:46:53.640
illiterate and lost and not be in danger.
So if you want to be a really,

793
00:46:53.641 --> 00:46:58.000
really uncomfortable but not really in any particular danger,
Japan is a,

794
00:46:58.001 --> 00:47:02.160
a great place to do it.
Uh,
Melanie curtain,

795
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:05.070
what are you most excited about for this year?
South by,

796
00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:10.440
I'm most excited about eating a lot of animals.

797
00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:13.980
Uh,
I don't,

798
00:47:13.981 --> 00:47:16.800
I don't have a real agenda while I'm here.

799
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:19.980
There are a number of friends of mine who have moved to Austin because it is the

800
00:47:19.981 --> 00:47:22.140
best place in the world.
Uh,

801
00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.240
and I'd like to just reconnect with some of my friends,

802
00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:25.800
many of whom I met in the,

803
00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:28.380
actually two of them I'm meeting in the next three days.

804
00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:32.980
I met for the first at south by in 2007 and they've continued to be to my best

805
00:47:32.981 --> 00:47:35.770
friends.
So that's about it.
Uh,

806
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:40.800
this is from be cursed 77 on your podcast with Matt Mullenweg.

807
00:47:40.901 --> 00:47:44.080
You guys spoke briefly about poly synchronous sleep.
Have you tried it?

808
00:47:44.081 --> 00:47:48.190
Does it work?
Uh,
supply synchronous?
I've,
I've never heard it phrased that way.

809
00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:51.210
Most people have heard if they have heard it,
um,

810
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:55.600
polyphasic sleep where you take instead of a single hour,
or I'm sorry,

811
00:47:55.601 --> 00:47:57.010
a single block of eight hours,

812
00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:00.190
you can break it down into fractions where you can get down to two,

813
00:48:00.191 --> 00:48:04.390
two and a half hours of sleep.
If you do it,
take a 20 minute nap every few hours.

814
00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:09.040
I have tried it and it can work.
And I still am a,

815
00:48:09.041 --> 00:48:11.200
I'm a huge believer in naps,
huge,

816
00:48:11.201 --> 00:48:13.780
huge believer in naps despite the fact that I have a lot of trouble with them,

817
00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:16.760
a pro tip for naps that I've realized it's not about falling into,

818
00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:17.860
it's not about falling asleep.

819
00:48:17.861 --> 00:48:20.830
It's about laying down and closing your eyes and just blocking out some sensory

820
00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:21.071
input.

821
00:48:21.071 --> 00:48:23.470
So don't get stressed out if you can't fall asleep for 20 minutes and just lay

822
00:48:23.471 --> 00:48:27.100
down and chill out.
Um,
I've tried it.
It works.

823
00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:31.300
It's massively antisocial.
You can have no social calendar whatsoever.

824
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:35.530
So I don't typically follow it.
Luigi linguine though.

825
00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:39.610
What's the most memorable thank you note that I've received?
Ooh,

826
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:43.900
that's a good question.
I've been very fortunate.
I've had a good,

827
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:47.490
a good tear over the last couple of years and uh,
there's,

828
00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:50.650
there's a luck component.
There's a timing component.
Uh,
you know,

829
00:48:50.651 --> 00:48:53.740
hopefully there's some kind of competency component.

830
00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.370
<v 2>But uh,</v>

831
00:48:58.050 --> 00:48:59.820
<v 4>you know,
the first one that's coming to mind,
I've,
I've,</v>

832
00:48:59.821 --> 00:49:03.430
I've received a lot of really lovely thank you letters,

833
00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.430
but the first one that comes to mind has nothing to do with the four hour work

834
00:49:06.431 --> 00:49:09.130
week.
It's actually a collection of thank you notes from,

835
00:49:09.131 --> 00:49:13.570
I think they were third graders or fourth graders from doing work with donors,

836
00:49:13.571 --> 00:49:16.330
choose.org,
which is an educational nonprofit.
Uh,

837
00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:18.880
I really love and spend a lot of time with them on their advisory board.

838
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:23.470
And I got this collection of thank you notes for supplying some basic materials

839
00:49:23.471 --> 00:49:24.880
like books or pens or pencils.

840
00:49:24.881 --> 00:49:28.640
So that's the first one that comes to mind is just these,
these hand,
you know,

841
00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:32.380
crack a lot of,
I'm not a parent yet,
so I don't have the,
uh,
you know,

842
00:49:32.381 --> 00:49:37.240
the like poorly drawn brontosaurus to stick on my refrigerator and I got,

843
00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:40.480
you know,
30 hand drawn and letters from these kids,
which was just awesome.

844
00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:46.170
A GD m l are you recording a podcast while here at south by if yes.

845
00:49:47.231 --> 00:49:52.090
With whom?
I don't have any plans to record here at south by,
I might,
uh,

846
00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:55.840
who knows.
I might,
they'll do a man on the street,
walk around,

847
00:49:55.900 --> 00:50:00.220
see how many drunk people I can get to say incriminating things.
I Dunno,
but no,

848
00:50:00.221 --> 00:50:05.110
no plans right now.
Uh,
what animal best describes you?

849
00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:08.860
Edwin Lee.
Also a good question.
This is a good one.
Um,

850
00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:13.420
Alexis Ohanian of y Combinator likes to ask people in job interviews,

851
00:50:13.421 --> 00:50:17.640
what is your spirit animal,
uh,
which I think gets a pretty good answer.
Uh,

852
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:21.700
or causes some awkward as the very least a coyote,
I'd say.

853
00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:26.460
I'd say a prankster joker.
It's we,

854
00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:28.790
we go into that for a while,
but I'll just leave it.

855
00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:31.880
I think coyote is pretty good one.
Jackie Bloom.

856
00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:35.880
I have a nine to five job can for our work.
We actually transformed my life.

857
00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:40.520
Hope not in a position to leave my regular job.
Uh,
I would say yes.
And the,

858
00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:44.990
the reason I say that is that the four hour work week is a really a cult,

859
00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:48.200
a portfolio of tools for maximizing your power output.

860
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:50.930
So there was somebody actually just on Twitter a couple of days ago,

861
00:50:50.931 --> 00:50:54.500
if you look at my favorites,
if you look at my favorites on Twitter at t Ferris,

862
00:50:54.501 --> 00:50:59.400
you can see tons and tons of real life case studies from the four hour workweek

863
00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:01.080
for our body.
And one of them was,
you know,

864
00:51:01.081 --> 00:51:04.460
it took me five months to negotiate it,
but I now have a room up,

865
00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:07.400
a remote work agreement.
So he's in his current job,
same job,

866
00:51:07.401 --> 00:51:10.340
getting paid the same amount,
but it has complete freedom of mobility.

867
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:13.140
That's a big deal.
And uh,
cause that,

868
00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:16.610
that helps to reward performance over presence and at least a great thing.

869
00:51:16.611 --> 00:51:21.410
So it's a,
it's not about getting to a four hour work week for everyone.

870
00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:25.730
It's about maximizing your output and then making better decisions with more

871
00:51:25.731 --> 00:51:28.640
options.
Andrew Berg,
uh,

872
00:51:28.641 --> 00:51:32.600
what are the three to four best bodyweight exercises for business travelers?

873
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:38.420
Well,
uh,
I would say you can keep it really simple

874
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:43.280
pushups,
planks.
If you want to make planks harder,

875
00:51:43.281 --> 00:51:47.330
you can put the soles of your feet against the wall so your feet are off the

876
00:51:47.331 --> 00:51:50.900
ground and you have to press them back into the wall to make it work.

877
00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:56.150
That's quite challenging.
Uh,
and a pull ups,
if you have access to pull ups,

878
00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:59.690
I would say that if you do just that pistols,
if you can handle it.

879
00:51:59.691 --> 00:52:03.380
But pistols are hard for a lot of people.
There's one legged squats,
uh,
otherwise,

880
00:52:03.381 --> 00:52:08.300
just two tips.
If you train your abs and your grip,
you can keep the entire,

881
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:11.900
your entire body in really good shape.
Uh,
abs,
we were talking about planks.

882
00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:15.080
Listen to my podcast with Pavel Tsatsouline for more details on that.

883
00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:18.140
Get some hand.
Grippers as a,
as a dude,

884
00:52:18.141 --> 00:52:20.390
I'm not sure was all the ladies here and wanting like thick,

885
00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:21.950
calloused meat hooks,

886
00:52:21.951 --> 00:52:26.180
but a gripper is grippers or are incredible travel with.

887
00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:29.300
And you can also,
if you're really aggressive and want to go for it,

888
00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:34.070
you can get a kayaking dry bag that people use to put their wallets and so on.

889
00:52:34.071 --> 00:52:35.700
I phones inside to keep dry wall.

890
00:52:35.701 --> 00:52:38.780
It turns out you can use a dry back to contain water also.

891
00:52:38.781 --> 00:52:41.960
So you can roll up a dry bag,
travel with it,
fill it up with water,

892
00:52:41.961 --> 00:52:44.090
sat in the bathtub and get it up to like 30,
40 pounds.

893
00:52:44.091 --> 00:52:47.210
And you can just use that as a kettle bell or as a dumbbell.
So you can,

894
00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:49.130
you can get around the space constraints.

895
00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:53.750
Jesse Conover what's the best way to respond to,

896
00:52:53.751 --> 00:52:58.630
do you have a business card when I don't have one?
What's this?

897
00:52:58.730 --> 00:53:02.360
Ah,
no,
I I just say I'm sorry.
I'm really unprofessional.

898
00:53:02.361 --> 00:53:06.440
I don't have business cards.
That's it.
I have no,
uh,

899
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:09.950
I think that does,
it does the job.
And then usually I say,
I'm sorry,

900
00:53:09.951 --> 00:53:11.420
I don't have your business cards,
but you know,
I'll,
I'll,

901
00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:15.680
I'll shoot my info if you mean it.
If not,
then don't say that.
Uh,
all right,

902
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:16.543
next question.

903
00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:18.030
<v 2>Okay.</v>

904
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:22.220
<v 4>Eric Coleman.
What do you most entrepreneurs do wrong?</v>

905
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:26.330
<v 2>Okay.</v>

906
00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:28.340
<v 4>What most entrepreneurs do are all,
uh,</v>

907
00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:31.370
I think they try to do what was most entrepreneurs

908
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:38.870
invest too much in their business before they test product market fit.

909
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:43.430
So do what I mentioned before and read the 22 immutable laws of marketing.

910
00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:45.230
Read a thousand true fans by Kevin Kelly,

911
00:53:45.231 --> 00:53:50.231
which is free and figure out exactly who your ideal customer is and who those

912
00:53:50.601 --> 00:53:53.870
thousand people are,
where they're located,
what they read,

913
00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:57.620
where they'd be on Facebook,
which pages they've probably liked,

914
00:53:58.190 --> 00:54:00.020
and test your landing page.

915
00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:04.220
Use something like unbounce or lead pages or something to test the offer before

916
00:54:04.221 --> 00:54:09.220
you invest in a ton of inventory or a ton of software development.
And,
uh,

917
00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:11.660
I think that's,
that's the right way to approach it.

918
00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:13.580
Along the same lines as Luigi at Dell,

919
00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:18.710
what's the most memorable Momento I've received?
Uh,
boy.

920
00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:22.293
<v 2>Okay.</v>

921
00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.210
<v 4>Uh,
again,
it's just the first one that comes to mind.
Uh,</v>

922
00:54:25.211 --> 00:54:30.040
I was in Japan at one point filming a TV show where I was attempting to learn

923
00:54:30.041 --> 00:54:35.020
Japanese horseback archery in a week.
A really dangerous turns out.

924
00:54:35.021 --> 00:54:37.850
I don't recommend it.
You can,
you can find it online if you,

925
00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:42.280
if you just search Japanese horseback archery and my name of all of the things.

926
00:54:42.730 --> 00:54:47.230
Uh,
and the teacher there gave me a,

927
00:54:47.231 --> 00:54:51.840
an a,
an out of prints,
tiny book on job with Ami,

928
00:54:51.850 --> 00:54:56.560
which it's called in Japanese that he was featured in with an inscription from

929
00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:57.160
the,
the,

930
00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:02.080
the foremost family who used to work with the shogunate teaching.

931
00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:06.390
Uh,
Ya'll was not me.
And,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,

932
00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:08.920
sort of prodigy right now who's an incredible writer,

933
00:55:08.921 --> 00:55:11.630
incredible archer has a jacket.
He didn't give me the jacket.

934
00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.620
I would have loved the jacket,
but it said,
oh God.

935
00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:17.020
Salata Yabu thought since 1157,

936
00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:21.340
or something like that instead of 11,
since 11 something.
And I was like,

937
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:24.580
that is amazing.
I want that jacket.
I didn't get the jacket.
I got the book.

938
00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:27.870
But that was enough.
All right.
Advice for introverts.
Uh,

939
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.530
advice for introverts is a take time.
Timeouts.
So I,

940
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:36.430
I can play the extrovert,
but I get exhausted at events.

941
00:55:36.431 --> 00:55:39.700
I get exhausted and crowds,
I get exhausted at book signings.
I get really,

942
00:55:39.701 --> 00:55:43.750
really drained.
I recharge my batteries by myself.
So if you need to take a break,

943
00:55:44.530 --> 00:55:47.050
go outside,
chill out for 10 minutes and leaned against the wall,

944
00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:51.550
like laid out on the park,
uh,
take time to recharge.

945
00:55:51.551 --> 00:55:53.560
If you try to play the extrovert for too long,

946
00:55:53.561 --> 00:55:56.070
you'll just get burned out and then the next day you won't even participate.

947
00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:59.710
So drink a lot of water and recharge.

948
00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:02.050
Josh,
Janssen,

949
00:56:02.590 --> 00:56:06.370
what are some of the biggest lessons you've learned from starting my podcast?

950
00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:10.330
Uh,
the podcast started as a lark.

951
00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:15.360
It was really a commitment to do six episodes because I wanted to get better at

952
00:56:16.450 --> 00:56:18.490
conversation and asking questions.

953
00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:21.910
My favorite part of writing books is not actually the writing,

954
00:56:21.911 --> 00:56:26.200
it's the research and it's worldclass experts and trying to deconstruct what

955
00:56:26.201 --> 00:56:26.501
they do.

956
00:56:26.501 --> 00:56:30.010
And I viewed the podcast as a way of practicing that and getting much better at

957
00:56:30.011 --> 00:56:33.370
it.
And I'd had some wonderful experiences being interviewed on say,

958
00:56:33.371 --> 00:56:34.870
Joe Rogan's podcast or Mark Marin.

959
00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:38.140
And I wanted to see if I enjoyed being the host.
Uh,

960
00:56:38.141 --> 00:56:42.160
so I would say first and foremost,
what I've learned is that,

961
00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:43.913
uh,

962
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:50.840
it's not enough to have the right question,
uh,
to have the right answers.

963
00:56:50.841 --> 00:56:53.360
You need to have the right questions so you can get,

964
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:57.530
you can get a great answer to the wrong question and it ends up meaning very

965
00:56:57.531 --> 00:56:59.480
little.
But if you have,

966
00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:02.870
if you have a portfolio of really good questions,
man,

967
00:57:02.871 --> 00:57:06.500
you can do just about anything.
And,
uh,
that's number one.

968
00:57:06.501 --> 00:57:10.550
Number two is ask simple follow on questions.

969
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:15.080
So someone says,
well,
I did this,
I did this,
this,
why did you choose to do that?

970
00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:18.010
What did you learn from that?
You know,

971
00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:22.190
what did you learn from that that you haven't talked about before?
Uh,
these,

972
00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:26.270
these follow up questions are often where the gems really come out.

973
00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:29.030
All right,
next question.
Gabby did.
Leon,

974
00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:34.420
what are some tips for executing on all the great ideas gathered at I a Iowa?

975
00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:41.240
Oh,
interactive.
What was I,
I'm not sure.
Uh,

976
00:57:41.241 --> 00:57:44.960
once we returned home,
I'm guessing that is from the conference.
Uh,

977
00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:50.300
you don't want to execute on all the great ideas.
It's way,
way,
way too much.

978
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:52.700
So I would look at your ideas,

979
00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:56.630
the potential collaborations and all of that and ask yourself which one of
these,

980
00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:58.190
if,
if executed,

981
00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:02.570
will make all of the others irrelevant or easier and then focus on that one.

982
00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:05.480
So find the lead domino and focus on that.

983
00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:09.800
I think we'll take one more question and then direct everyone to the signing.

984
00:58:10.110 --> 00:58:13.850
Sure.
All right.
Next one is gender,
which for Borsky.

985
00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:15.531
Let's do it.

986
00:58:15.531 --> 00:58:17.540
Let's do one more question after this cause I don't think I have a good answer

987
00:58:17.541 --> 00:58:21.200
for this.
Is there any particular session that south by that you want to attend?

988
00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:24.530
At least one.
Um,
I wasn't able to get my badge yet,

989
00:58:24.531 --> 00:58:28.850
so I haven't had a chance to get the book with the sessions.
Uh,

990
00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:29.713
let's do one more.

991
00:58:31.170 --> 00:58:32.003
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

992
00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:34.300
<v 4>This is a good one.
Alex.
Why cough?</v>

993
00:58:34.301 --> 00:58:38.680
What questions do you use for reflection and why?
So reflection,

994
00:58:38.681 --> 00:58:40.890
meditation,
I view those as the same thing.
Uh,

995
00:58:40.930 --> 00:58:44.070
I will journal in the mornings quite often and,
uh,

996
00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:49.060
whenever I'd say every four to eight weeks at longest,

997
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:51.820
uh,
I will wake up in the morning and I will do an 80,

998
00:58:51.821 --> 00:58:54.370
20 inventory of my emotional states.
So what does that mean?

999
00:58:54.371 --> 00:58:57.580
That means that I'll sit down before checking email during any of that,

1000
00:58:57.581 --> 00:59:00.250
checking my phone and I will ask the question,
you know,

1001
00:59:00.251 --> 00:59:05.020
water 20% of the activities and relationships that are producing 80% of my

1002
00:59:05.021 --> 00:59:06.430
positive emotional states.

1003
00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:11.650
And then what are the 20% of activities and people who are creating 80% of the

1004
00:59:11.651 --> 00:59:16.570
negative emotional states,
the overwhelm,
that guilt and so on and uh,

1005
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:19.600
put together a to do list and,
and not to do list accordingly.

1006
00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:22.130
Specifically the not do list the things to cut

1007
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:25.900
<v 1>out.
So those are,
that is the,
uh,</v>

1008
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:29.870
the set of questions that I find most valuable.
Good question and good answer.

1009
00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:32.660
Well,
cool.
Thanks again Tim and thanks everyone here for joining us.

1010
00:59:32.661 --> 00:59:34.120
Everybody have a great soundbite.

1011
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:41.060
They
guys,
this is Tim again.

1012
00:59:41.061 --> 00:59:44.270
Just a few more things before you take off.
Number one,

1013
00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:49.460
this is five bullet Friday.
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1014
00:59:49.461 --> 00:59:53.600
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

1015
00:59:53.601 --> 00:59:57.590
little morsel of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very short

1016
00:59:57.591 --> 01:00:02.120
email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been pondering

1017
01:00:02.121 --> 01:00:05.810
over the week.
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

1018
01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:09.260
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1019
01:00:09.261 --> 01:00:13.580
somehow dug up in the other world of the esoteric as I do.

1020
01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:18.850
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

1021
01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:22.250
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

1022
01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:27.290
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

1023
01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:31.030
So if you want to receive that,
