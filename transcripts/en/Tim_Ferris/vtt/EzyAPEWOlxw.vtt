00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.790
Optimal.
At this altitude,

2
00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:06.000
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.530
I'm a cybernetic organism,

4
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.830
<v 1>so does brought to you by headspace.</v>

5
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.040
More than 80% of the people I've interviewed,

6
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.050
world class performers across the military,
entertainment,
sports,

7
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.070
and beyond all have some type of meditative practice.

8
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.280
I tried for years and years and failed miserably.

9
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.300
The key is making it simple and you can dramatically improve your life in just

10
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:47.160
10 minutes a day and technology can help you.

11
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.630
This change comes through guided meditation and headspace is by far the most

12
00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:55.980
popular app for this purpose.
More than 4 million users.

13
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.600
It's meditation made simple,

14
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.080
so what I recommend is that you take this practice meditation,

15
00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:02.940
which is rooted in thousands of years of tradition,

16
00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:07.941
supported by thousands of scientific studies and try it for 10 minutes a day for

17
00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:11.240
10 days.
That's all you need to do.

18
00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:15.020

That's all it takes.

this episode is brought to you by exo protein.

27
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.540
It's one of the startups that I work with.
I love what they do.

28
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.050
These guys are making protein bars using crickets,
protein powder,

29
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.020
and before you screw your face up and look disgusted,

30
00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:56.990
I bet they taste better than any protein bar you've ever had before.

31
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.800
I devour these bars after lifting sessions.
I take them with me on the road.

32
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.680
The recipes were developed by a three Michelin Star Chef,

33
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.660
former head of r and d at the fat duck,

34
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.540
which was ranked the number one restaurant in the world during his tenure.

35
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.580
The bars are paleo friendly,
no gluten,
no grains,
no soy,
no dairy,
et cetera.

36
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.900
They are high in protein and flavor and extremely unique and they do not pop

37
00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:20.390
your glycemic response up oddly enough,

38
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.720
and you can look that up on line to see some stories on that Ferran Stein,

39
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.550
that's the journalist who looked at it on top of all that.

40
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:31.910
They are less processed than nearly all protein bars.
You'll be able to find.

41
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.390
This is your chance to see what the hype is about and the founders were just on

42
00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:39.740
the Forbes 30 under 30 list and they are offering a deep discount to Tim Ferriss

43
00:02:39.741 --> 00:02:42.510
show listeners.

00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:50.750
10 bucks.

47
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.560
That's [inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim and I would recommend doing it

48
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:58.220
relatively fast and that's not a bs scarcity thing.

49
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.360
They're startup with limited inventory and they sell out all the time.

50
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.810
That is what happened last time I mentioned them,
so check it out.

Hello Ladies and germs.

53
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:14.800
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

54
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:18.640
each episode is my job to deconstruct world class performers,

55
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:23.170
to tease out the lessons,
routines,
habits,
breakfasts,

56
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.033
favorite books,

57
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.190
etc. That you can use and borrow from world class performers whether they are

58
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.250
military strategists,
chess prodigies,
athletes,
actors,

59
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:36.280
politicians or anything and everything in between.

60
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:39.980
And this episode we have a very exciting guest,
uh,

61
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.930
with whom I've been spending a ton of time.
Christopher Sommer,

62
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:47.620
Christopher Sommer,
you can find them on Instagram and Facebook.

63
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.420
I highly recommend checking it out.

64
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.450
Gymnastic bodies is the account name is the former US national team gymnastics

65
00:03:56.291 --> 00:04:00.070
coach.
He's also the founder of gymnastic bodies.com a training system that I am

66
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:04.930
currently testing the hell out of and I have no affiliation with it in so much

67
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:07.990
as I get no kind of affiliate anything,
pay out,
whatever.

68
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.250
I'm just fascinated by bodyweight training and reached out to coach summer to

69
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:17.251
try to finally practice gymnastics as a 38 year old and I've learned a lot.

70
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:23.920
We've been toying around with things for about six weeks now as of this

71
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:24.754
recording.

72
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.960
And we're doing a 90 day custom tests so I hope to have some very interesting

73
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:33.610
before and afters for you guys so we will be doing a round to followup as a

74
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:35.080
world renowned Olympic coach.

75
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.930
Summer is known for billing his students into some of the strongest,

76
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:42.931
most powerful athletes in the world and you got to check out his Facebook page.

77
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:45.970
He features a lot of these athletes.
It is bonkers.

78
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.700
During his extensive 40 year coach and career coach,

79
00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:51.670
summer took meticulous notes on his training techniques,
his wins,

80
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:55.570
failures and so on so that he could translate the best elements and do a

81
00:04:55.571 --> 00:04:59.620
superior exercise system for both high level end beginner athletes.

82
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.790
His four decades of careful observation led to the birth of gymnastic strength,

83
00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:08.440
Chin.
Let's try that again.
Gymnastics,
strength training,

84
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.470
not vocal strength training,
some failing in that department,

85
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.000
otherwise known as GST.

86
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.710
In this episode we cover a ton of stuff and I think it's going to light up the

87
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:20.650
Internet's because everybody has a strong opinion these days,

88
00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:25.270
but coach summer is very well qualified to have the opinions that he holds.

89
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.300
We talk about the biggest mistakes of self taught handstands.

90
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.410
Why recreational athletes who tried gymnastics get injured?

91
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.400
Most commonly we talk about the three to five exercises everyone should be
doing.

92
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.560
Chances are you've never heard of some of them.

93
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.940
We talk about mental prep for athletes who are going into big competition.

94
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.930
The questions you should ask a coach before sending your kid to gymnastics.
Uh,

95
00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:51.130
we get into what is wrong with Yoga handstands,

96
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:52.060
Eh,

97
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.060
the questions or opinions that he might pose or have related to kipping pull

98
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.420
<v 2>ups in crossfit and elsewhere.
And uh,</v>

99
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.010
I asked that question because a mutual friend said,

100
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:05.330
if you want him to lose his shit,

101
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.390
ask about kipping we have the determination of GST,

102
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:13.310
this gymnastic strength training goals.
If you could only pick one,

103
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:16.040
what would it be and why?
Who are the best coaches he's met?

104
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.580
What characterizes them?
It just goes on and on and on.
I mean,

105
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:21.890
if you want to build,
say mass in the biceps,

106
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:26.891
how you can utilize straight arm work and why you must turn your hands out past

107
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:31.820
parallel.
Well,
when training the rings,
why is that important?

108
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.790
How does it affect muscular development in strength development?

109
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.460
Why do you need to fix the lats to fix the shoulders?

110
00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:41.330
But it goes on and on and on.
This is a very in depth conversation.

111
00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:44.690
We get into the weeds and I would just say be patient.

112
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:49.691
They're on a lot of gems here and similar to the Dominic D'agostino episode on

113
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:52.340
Ketosis and the end of cancer and so on and so forth.

114
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.680
We really get into some nitty gritty detail on that is why many people listen to

115
00:06:57.681 --> 00:07:01.100
this podcast.
So just bear with me if you're like,

116
00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:04.460
what the hell are these guys talking about?
Give it 30 seconds.

117
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.510
Chances are that we'll zoom back up to 30,000 feet or change topics,

118
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.660
so stick with it and please enjoy this very wide ranging intense conversation

119
00:07:14.631 --> 00:07:16.730
with coach Christopher Sommer.

120
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.950
Coach,
welcome to the show.
Thanks Jen.

121
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.460
I am excited to finally have you on the show.

122
00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:30.461
We've had so many conversations in the last month or two and I've been so

123
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:36.680
impressed with the,
the subtlety and nuance of the training that you do.

124
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.780
Uh,
so I've been very eager to have you on the show to explore,
uh,
all things,

125
00:07:41.781 --> 00:07:45.440
gymnastics and gymnastics,
strength training related.

126
00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:49.010
So thanks for making the time.
First of all,
my pleasure.
You come forward to it.

127
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.610
And I thought,
I thought we could,
we could start with just some definitions.

128
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.640
So what would you or how would you define gymnastic strength training?

129
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:02.970
Gst?
Ah,
that's a good question.
Uh,
in a nutshell,

130
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.850
gymnastic strength training I define as um,

131
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.470
high level body weight strength training.
So,
uh,
none,

132
00:08:10.471 --> 00:08:15.120
none of the technical training that we do for world class performance or the

133
00:08:15.121 --> 00:08:19.680
acrobatics or technical gymnastics,
just purely the strength,

134
00:08:19.681 --> 00:08:21.600
joint prep and mobility components.

135
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:26.350
<v 1>And one,
one example of what not to do perhaps or,</v>

136
00:08:26.351 --> 00:08:31.351
or how gymnastic strength training might differ from the aesthetics that some

137
00:08:31.601 --> 00:08:34.210
people,
I'm not going to say compromise with,

138
00:08:34.211 --> 00:08:37.870
but shoes we were talking about doing a pike,

139
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:42.370
I guess a Pike handstand press or holding that position.

140
00:08:42.371 --> 00:08:45.880
And the example,
and I feel free to correct my recollection,

141
00:08:45.881 --> 00:08:50.881
but was of how a lot of folks kick their hips way out to counterbalance instead

142
00:08:51.911 --> 00:08:56.040
of doing what,
what would the gymnastic strength training version that look like?

143
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:01.230
<v 3>A good example.
So what we see,
and this is kind of getting into some handstands,</v>

144
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:03.360
some skill training,
but um,

145
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:08.390
handstand done correctly is a reflection of physical preparation that athlete

146
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:12.300
either has or does not have.
So if they lack strength,

147
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:13.680
if they lack mobility,

148
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.130
then of course their technical Hanson is going to lack refinement.

149
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.550
So though in terms of that pike can Stan,

150
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.690
if they lack middle trap,
if they lack lower traps string,

151
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.110
then they're going to try to counterbalance by really arch in the chest out,

152
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.830
stick in the boat,
way back behind them.
Uh,
goodness,

153
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.760
not even sure how to describe it like a pike in an arch at the same time.

154
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:37.920
Sorry to interrupt.

155
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.460
Coach just lets people who I realize I should have probably defined some terms

156
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:45.000
myself.
So Pike for people who are not familiar with this.
Uh,

157
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.810
the easiest way to visualize it if you don't have any background with that is

158
00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:50.280
imagine you're sitting on the floor.

159
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:54.970
It's Kinda like PE class legs straight and together,
uh,

160
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.680
bending at the waist,
towards your toes,
forward,

161
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.770
bending forward towards your toes.
Uh,
and so if you were in,

162
00:10:01.771 --> 00:10:06.771
imagine you're sitting down with your legs out in front of you at a just to like

163
00:10:07.621 --> 00:10:10.260
hypothetically at a 90 degree angle and you put your arms up over your head.

164
00:10:10.261 --> 00:10:12.660
Let's just flip you upset outs here and a hand stamp position.

165
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.950
That's effectively what we're talking about,
exactly what we're talking about.

166
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.820
And to hold that because center of mass is way out in front of the body.

167
00:10:20.821 --> 00:10:22.260
Then in order to hold that,

168
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:26.100
the traps are what's responsible to keeping the back and the shoulders straight.

169
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.820
So if you're not strong enough,
and is it,
some people say,
well,

170
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:33.990
it's just skill training.
Well,
everything builds upon everything else.

171
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.560
So got Olympics coming up,
people are going to be pumped.

172
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.420
They're getting to see our Olympic team,

173
00:10:39.421 --> 00:10:42.780
they're going to see the other monsters around the world competing on rings.

174
00:10:42.781 --> 00:10:46.760
And there are,
I want to do that and they're going to jump right up.
You know,

175
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.460
I've got friends who are former seal team six and first thing they did is jump

176
00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:54.240
up and of course they failed at early and then they come see us.
Cause it's,

177
00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.030
it's like anything,
you know,
you don't jump right into calculus.

178
00:10:57.031 --> 00:11:00.060
You learned to count and we learn a dish and we learned subtraction,

179
00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:03.900
Yada Yada Yada.
Whether enough time and enough layers,
not progression.

180
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:08.770
Then we get to advanced math.
So advanced ring strain,
same deal.
And we,

181
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:13.970
I remember we were talking not too long ago about the importance of pacing when

182
00:11:14.731 --> 00:11:18.600
you're dealing with connective tissue tendons and ligaments,
which is something,

183
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.600
uh,
I'm not per se,

184
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:24.110
I'm not particularly well known for in terms of patients and things,

185
00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.740
but I've noticed that,
uh,
the,
uh,
the,

186
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:33.240
at any of the guys who say do outdoor bar workout,
so of Witcher,
I'm very,

187
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.260
very impressive.

188
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.450
Physical specimens will jump up on the rings and they'll be doing,

189
00:11:39.451 --> 00:11:40.560
I'm not sure what they would even call them.

190
00:11:40.561 --> 00:11:44.440
They're kind of like what would be looked at as like a typewriter on the pullup

191
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.950
bar when you move back and forth from one arm to the other side,

192
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:51.000
decide pulled up,
I decide pull up and they were like,

193
00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.660
I was feeling fine coach.
And then suddenly,
you know,
I tore my Bicep,
right,

194
00:11:54.661 --> 00:11:59.560
tore my package and it was fine until it wasn't up.
What are some,
if you look at,

195
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.570
uh,
the

196
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:08.190
muscles or types of strength that most non gymnast's will not have,

197
00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:12.580
even if they consider themselves reasonably athletic,
what would be on that list?

198
00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:17.080
And we already mentioned one,
which is say mid and lower traps.

199
00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:19.090
And of course,
I mean I,

200
00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:22.450
I would like to think I came to the table with kind of hat in hand because I

201
00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:25.450
recognize how hard a lot of this is.
But the more I practice it,

202
00:12:25.451 --> 00:12:30.451
the more I'm astounded at how unprepared my body is for these movements.

203
00:12:30.911 --> 00:12:34.720
I mean it's a,
as someone who has done a lot of pulling from the floor,

204
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:39.580
for instance,
who has,
you know,
decent deadlift,
I would like to think,
uh,

205
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:44.620
I was just astonished at how weak my mid back was.
It was just,

206
00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:48.070
it blew my mind.
It was,
it was,
it was completely flabbergasted.
And what other,

207
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.610
what other muscles are movements do you find?
Uh,

208
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:56.650
normals just cannot perform even if they view themselves as athletic.
Uh,
for the,

209
00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:57.760
for the lifters,

210
00:12:57.761 --> 00:13:02.670
the one that always jumps out at us is their lack on shoulder extension.
So,
um,

211
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.620
if I pick my,
if I'm standing upright and I lift my hands forward,

212
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.510
that's flection and I can go all the way up to my arms are overhead fine picking

213
00:13:10.511 --> 00:13:14.680
my hands up behind me.
That would be shoulder extension.
Right?

214
00:13:14.681 --> 00:13:16.240
So just to paint another picture for folks,

215
00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:21.241
like if you stand up and then interlace your fingers behind your tailbone with

216
00:13:21.941 --> 00:13:25.360
your arms straight and then tried to lift them up towards the ceiling,

217
00:13:25.361 --> 00:13:27.200
keeping your back straight.
Uh,

218
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.150
so the shoulder extension and what we find,
as you know,

219
00:13:31.151 --> 00:13:33.670
and a lot of what we'll get sometimes from people as well.

220
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.670
I don't want to be in the circus.
I don't want to be an acrobat.
I,

221
00:13:36.671 --> 00:13:39.940
I'm not interested in skill training.
I want,
I want strength.

222
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.290
And what they don't understand is if you want to achieve world class levels of

223
00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:45.071
performance,

224
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:49.780
technically that comes first from adding a solid foundation of physical

225
00:13:49.781 --> 00:13:53.860
preparation,
which means correct range of motion,
right?
Good Mobility,

226
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:58.000
good connective tissue.
So shoulder extension become,
so for example,

227
00:13:58.001 --> 00:13:59.200
a lot of people fail.

228
00:13:59.201 --> 00:14:02.530
They can't do muscle ups because they can't do shoulder extension.

229
00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.770
They think in their head that a muscle up his chin up,

230
00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.430
a little bit of transition that they don't understand.
And then it dip.

231
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:13.690
What really happens as we do a pull up and we get our hands to our chin and then

232
00:14:13.691 --> 00:14:18.010
the elbows pull back behind the torso behind them and there's their shoulder

233
00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:22.360
extension.
If they can't do shoulder extension,
now they're stuck.
And they,

234
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:26.140
they had spent all this time working technique and doing rap and doing rap.

235
00:14:26.141 --> 00:14:30.100
And what they're doing is they're treating the symptom,
not actually the problem.

236
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.910
Well I was,
uh,
so just as some background for folks,

237
00:14:33.911 --> 00:14:38.911
the way that we connected was I at 38 finally decided enough is enough.

238
00:14:40.691 --> 00:14:44.800
I've been fantasizing about trying to learn gymnastics in a structured way for

239
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:49.000
20 plus years.
Much like my postponing of getting a dog for 20 years.

240
00:14:49.001 --> 00:14:52.310
It's just like why,
why did it take me so long to do this?
And

241
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.400
<v 4>I was in Venice,
I'm going to give these folks a shout out.</v>

242
00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.650
So there is a crossfit gym there named to parody.

243
00:14:57.651 --> 00:15:02.250
So crossfit and I just love the folks who run the gym and I would go there and

244
00:15:02.251 --> 00:15:05.540
train cause they would let me use chalk and do all the things that a lot of gyms

245
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:08.250
will not allow me to do.
And uh,

246
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.900
I met a gent who was doing a bodyweight workout.

247
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:14.150
He's the only person doing a body weight only workout.

248
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.890
And he suggested that I follow a gymnastic bodies on Instagram.

249
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:24.190
And so I started following your company on Instagram and saw older,

250
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:30.110
uh,
let's just call it middle aged men,

251
00:15:30.111 --> 00:15:33.560
sort of my demo as it stands right now,
uh,

252
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:36.860
who had started from scratch doing impressive things.

253
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:41.920
And I had used age as my crutch and excuse for not pulling the trigger in the

254
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:46.580
last few years.
So I reached out to rob wolf who was kind enough to introduce us.

255
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.940
And then,
yeah,
we've,
uh,

256
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.050
collaborated in this experiment that we're currently doing,

257
00:15:54.051 --> 00:15:59.051
which is roughly 90 days with a handful of goals that we'll get to you.

258
00:15:59.871 --> 00:16:01.850
But I want people to understand how we connected.

259
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.600
So I'm in the middle of training right now and it's a,
I have to say,

260
00:16:05.601 --> 00:16:08.560
I feel better than I've felt,
um,

261
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:12.440
with the exception of a little bit of elbow nonsense that is,
uh,

262
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.920
is not from this specifically.
It's a recurring thing,
uh,

263
00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:18.210
feel better than I have in,
in years.
Uh,

264
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.470
the going to hear just from this little bit already.

265
00:16:21.471 --> 00:16:25.560
We just from the little bit that we've done and uh,
the,
the,

266
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:30.110
the follow up question to that is,
uh,
for instance,
um,

267
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.880
when people are training for handstands at home,

268
00:16:34.881 --> 00:16:38.330
so self taught,
what are the biggest mistakes that they make?

269
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:42.440
<v 2>Well,
they won't like the answer and a,</v>

270
00:16:42.441 --> 00:16:46.490
this is a little bit of national team coach attitude coming out beat people tend

271
00:16:46.491 --> 00:16:50.660
to want what they want when they want it.
And that's fine if,

272
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:55.480
if I'm looking for
mediocre to average results,

273
00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.530
if,
if I'm looking to,
to really do best effort,
then I've got,

274
00:16:59.531 --> 00:17:02.440
I've got a back shit.
Um,
and I've got to take care of my business.

275
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.870
And for most of the adults it's going to be,

276
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.130
they have severe compromises in their mobility.

277
00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:14.050
Their shoulders don't work well,
their hips don't work,
their knees don't work,

278
00:17:14.051 --> 00:17:17.680
their elbows are shot.
Their forums are tight from all the desk patrol.

279
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:22.630
Their calves are like piano wire from sitting all the time.
Uh,

280
00:17:22.631 --> 00:17:26.350
when we won't even talk about hip flexor there scabs don't move.

281
00:17:26.351 --> 00:17:29.740
Their scapula have no motion.
They can't protract,
they can't retract.

282
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.430
Their spine is locked in,

283
00:17:33.431 --> 00:17:36.790
just a flat or a Chi Floyd's for they're hunched over,

284
00:17:36.791 --> 00:17:41.260
their lower back is continually arched and they're just kind of frozen in this

285
00:17:41.261 --> 00:17:44.920
position.
And then they want to try to move their body.

286
00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:50.040
Now the common one that we get from people as well,
these are extreme of motion.

287
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.810
<v 3>These are artificial ranges of motion and actually these are your natural range</v>

288
00:17:54.811 --> 00:17:59.790
of motion problem as they quit using it.
And so I just atrophied.
So we're not,

289
00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:03.900
we're not doing anything special or just how we have to recreate that natural

290
00:18:03.901 --> 00:18:08.730
range of motion first.
Uh,
this we've,

291
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.710
we've been doing,
gosh,
I don't know now,

292
00:18:10.711 --> 00:18:14.840
maybe since 2006 working with the adults and uh,

293
00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:15.990
the thing that just,

294
00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:19.200
we keep having my nose rubbed in it over and over and over again.

295
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:22.590
Every time I think I have it down,
I find I need to take it further.

296
00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:26.190
It's just the complete other lack of joint prep and mobility they come to the

297
00:18:26.191 --> 00:18:30.070
table with.
And if we do,
even even your,

298
00:18:30.071 --> 00:18:33.900
your own cases and excellent example,
we haven't done anything advanced yet.

299
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.310
We're doing all basic or doing fundamental stuff and you're already feeling

300
00:18:38.311 --> 00:18:40.410
better than in years.
Well,

301
00:18:40.411 --> 00:18:44.100
I think it's a lot of it has to do with two things.

302
00:18:44.101 --> 00:18:45.980
If I'm trying to self diagnosed,

303
00:18:45.981 --> 00:18:50.981
the first is absolutely identifying musculature and motor patterns that I simply

304
00:18:52.081 --> 00:18:55.440
had not developed properly previously.
Um,

305
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.370
even even if I had a passing familiarity,
like the,
uh,

306
00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.460
let me frame this in the form of a question.
So how do most people,

307
00:19:02.461 --> 00:19:06.360
can you define what the hollow position as,
why it's important and how,

308
00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.750
how do most normals do when they do a,
say a hollow body rock?

309
00:19:09.751 --> 00:19:13.590
And maybe you can explain that too.
Ah,
so what,
what people,
they're going to,

310
00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:18.120
most people when they think of abs,
they think lower abs.
They think upper abs,

311
00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.120
they're not going to think about Oh,
leaks at all.

312
00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:25.680
And they're not gonna think transverse abdominis at all.
So lower abs are easy.

313
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:29.520
Upper Ab,
easy.
Bleaks.
Okay.
They,
they understand the sideways.

314
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.520
They don't understand how obliques wrap around into the lats and to the lower

315
00:19:32.521 --> 00:19:37.020
back.
Okay,
that's fine.
But transverse abdominis,
they're like,
excuse me,
did it,

316
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.570
was that English?
They don't have a clue.

317
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.350
And that's what supports the body when it's in a straight body position.

318
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:48.130
So you know for,
for example,
ab rollers were,

319
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.150
we don't use them in our program,
but just as an example,

320
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.800
ab rollers were getting a,
a bad knock that if you do an ab roller,

321
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:58.770
you're going to hurt your lower back.
Well,
yes and no.
You'll,

322
00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:03.800
you'll hurt your back if you're doing it wrong if you are arched and your lower

323
00:20:04.201 --> 00:20:08.850
back.
So for definitions,
if my lower back is arched,
I'm an anterior pelvic tilt.

324
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.430
If I'm the opposite movement and I'm kind of,

325
00:20:11.431 --> 00:20:16.230
my tailbone tucked under and my lower back is flat,
that's posterior pelvic tilt,

326
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.070
I'll move my body's horizontal.
Then my,
uh,

327
00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:24.180
back is supported when I'm posterior pelvic tilt.
If I'm arched,

328
00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.810
it's unsupported by the Moscow's churn.
I'm hanging by the disc,

329
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.090
which is true for a ton of exercises that we do in terms of thing.

330
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:37.260
If I feel it in my lower back,
almost universally when I send you videos,

331
00:20:37.261 --> 00:20:39.270
the feedback is more PPT posts,

332
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:43.550
posterior pelvic tilt as it should just be a mantra for,

333
00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.630
for people who need a way to visualize this,

334
00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.260
because I realize a lot of this is new.
So,

335
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:53.200
<v 4>and coach,
feel free to interrupt at any point.
But an easy way to think about,</v>

336
00:20:53.201 --> 00:20:58.030
and remember,
anterior pelvic tilt is imagine that your,
your,

337
00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.640
your waist is the top of a wine glass.

338
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.940
If you have anterior pelvic tilt to the front,

339
00:21:03.941 --> 00:21:07.270
you're going to be pouring wine out the front of that glass,

340
00:21:07.271 --> 00:21:10.390
basically out of your belly button.
And if you have posterior pelvic tilt,

341
00:21:10.391 --> 00:21:11.590
you're talking that tailbone,

342
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:16.060
you're going to be pouring wine basically down your sacrum,
you know,
down,
down,

343
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.110
down the back of your body.
It's just an easy way for me to,

344
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:21.550
to remember as that is clever.

345
00:21:21.551 --> 00:21:25.570
I got to say 40 years of national team and I've never heard it described that

346
00:21:25.571 --> 00:21:30.450
way.
Yeah,
it may,
it may be our go to definition.
Well that's uh,
I,
you know,

347
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.860
I can't do the gymnastics so I'm going to,
I'll have to stick on,

348
00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:35.170
stick with the refining my definitions.
Although I am,

349
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:39.000
I'm making progress at the fundamentals and the Sui.

350
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:44.020
I'd like to talk about the assessment that we did.
So I flew out to a great gym,

351
00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:49.050
awakened gymnastics in Colorado and we met up RGB master Phillip.

352
00:21:49.711 --> 00:21:54.700
We only have one in the world and a awaken in Denver is our number one GB

353
00:21:54.701 --> 00:21:58.450
affiliate.
They're the best at what they do.
Yeah,
it's a,
it's a fantastic Jim.

354
00:21:58.451 --> 00:22:02.830
And we did quite a few hours of various assessments.

355
00:22:02.831 --> 00:22:07.831
If somebody wanted to try to self assess or videotape themselves to have,

356
00:22:09.401 --> 00:22:12.370
say someone qualified in gymnastics,
assess them.

357
00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.860
If you were to do an 80 20 analysis,

358
00:22:14.861 --> 00:22:19.750
like which movements or exercises give you the most data?

359
00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:24.280
Most banks,
most of the bang for the buck.
Okay.
Let's see.
No,

360
00:22:24.281 --> 00:22:27.030
so what we went over with you,
we checked hanging leg lift,

361
00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.770
hanging leg lift automatically is going to tell me the dynamic range of motion.

362
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.560
Is that right?
That's a like on a stall bar.
You don't want to be free swinging.

363
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:40.600
I'm good.
Most of them.
You know what,
whatever.
They can do it to my eye.

364
00:22:40.601 --> 00:22:42.760
As soon as I see it or our staff side there,

365
00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:46.060
they're going to know right away whether or not that person has adequate,

366
00:22:46.061 --> 00:22:49.120
it's going to tell us your core strength and it's going to tell me hamstring

367
00:22:49.121 --> 00:22:51.880
flexibility that that'll do that.

368
00:22:51.881 --> 00:22:56.050
And one bridge bridge is a huge one for adults.

369
00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.280
That's been one of our,

370
00:22:57.281 --> 00:23:01.630
we have a Thoracic Bridge Corp stretch series and that's,

371
00:23:01.631 --> 00:23:04.720
that's been one of our bestselling products.
That's what I'm doing this evening.

372
00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.220
Yeah.
Yeah.
Notice,
notice guys,
that Tim's real happy right now.

373
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:12.760
That'll change in just a few.
Yeah.
What,
what characterizes,

374
00:23:12.761 --> 00:23:16.450
this is a really important question.
What characterizes a good bridge?

375
00:23:16.451 --> 00:23:18.160
And for people who are thinking of bridge,
I mean it's,

376
00:23:18.161 --> 00:23:19.900
imagine you're laying on your back,
you put your,

377
00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:23.230
your palms down by your sort of ears,

378
00:23:23.231 --> 00:23:27.470
let's say feet flat on the ground and then you go up into an arch.
Now,
uh,

379
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:32.690
W I was extremely surprised and found it quite hilarious how bad my bridge was.

380
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:40.240
I mean terrible,
uh,
in the assessment,
but your standards.
Yes.

381
00:23:40.241 --> 00:23:45.010
By what I see on a normal basis,
yours was,
yours was medium.
Medium.

382
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:45.980
It was like a d plus.
It

383
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.390
<v 3>was like on the verge of passing.</v>

384
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:52.880
But I realized despite all of my many years of wrestling where we did tons of

385
00:23:52.881 --> 00:23:55.590
bridges,
almost all of my bridging,

386
00:23:55.591 --> 00:23:58.790
it comes from bending at the low back,
right?

387
00:23:58.791 --> 00:24:03.770
So my lumbar a huge issue.
So what is a good bridge?
Little background.

388
00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:10.170
So the lumbar and the lower back is not designed to have a ton of movement in

389
00:24:11.241 --> 00:24:15.260
it.
And Big Arch,
your thoracic spine,
your upper in your middle back.

390
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:18.320
They're designed to have a lot of movement.
They're designed to rotate.

391
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:22.540
Your lower back is not,
but when most people do their bridgework there,

392
00:24:22.541 --> 00:24:27.420
they're so compromised now,
okay,
even back up a little bit more,

393
00:24:27.421 --> 00:24:30.470
I'm there.
There are so compromised in range of motion,
their upper body,

394
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.720
because they'd been hitting the weights hard.

395
00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:37.280
They've been doing just a lot of high intensity training.
Now to preface that,

396
00:24:37.281 --> 00:24:40.700
there's nothing wrong with that.
There's nothing wrong with that at all.

397
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:43.370
If you weren't one of God's gifts when you were born,

398
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.710
you've got to do something to make up the deficit.

399
00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:49.370
The problem is when they do all that weight training,

400
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:54.200
they're not doing it in balance and maintaining their mobility.
If they had,

401
00:24:54.201 --> 00:24:56.240
they wouldn't have the issues that they ran into.

402
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.100
So if all you do is strength string,
string,

403
00:24:58.101 --> 00:25:00.410
string strength and you can always tell someone who has their,

404
00:25:00.411 --> 00:25:02.120
their the curl king in there,

405
00:25:02.121 --> 00:25:05.330
the bench press king and they come in and they're hunched over and their elbows

406
00:25:05.331 --> 00:25:08.180
don't straighten their arms don't go behind them and all they are like,

407
00:25:08.181 --> 00:25:13.181
you know my shoulders are killing me most of the time what we found is yeah

408
00:25:13.431 --> 00:25:16.070
their,
their shoulders are completely after up.
I agree.

409
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:20.930
But their biceps are crazy tight also and that bicep runs up through the front

410
00:25:20.931 --> 00:25:24.410
of the shoulder and it's manifesting itself as a shoulder issue.

411
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:29.300
So kind of all of these come together and long story short to cause them a huge

412
00:25:29.301 --> 00:25:31.430
problem being able to get into a proper bridge,

413
00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.820
which should be all upper body,

414
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:39.290
no lower back almost at all.
But people are doing the exact opposite.

415
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:42.230
They hurt their lower back.
And I say,
man,
these,
these bridges are dangerous.

416
00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.360
Now the bridge bridges aren't dangerous.

417
00:25:44.361 --> 00:25:47.750
And doing them halfassed and wrong without vetting your sources of information,

418
00:25:47.751 --> 00:25:48.584
it is dangerous.

419
00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:54.790
And I found it incredibly therapeutic as someone who's had a,

420
00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.970
basically a frozen thoracic for God knows how long,

421
00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:03.380
10 years.
Sure.
When we were worried about that I remember were like,
hmm,

422
00:26:03.381 --> 00:26:07.820
I wonder what through this Tim,
as the upper body mobility of a lego figure,

423
00:26:07.821 --> 00:26:12.710
what are we going to do?
So the,
but just the progression of doing,

424
00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:16.880
uh,
and of course people should look for visual references and,
and I'll,

425
00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.350
I'll point them in there exactly when they're on all our courses and that's all

426
00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.280
of them to a bunch of resources in the show notes.
But the,

427
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:29.180
can you walk through the check boxes because I know we've done this even

428
00:26:29.181 --> 00:26:33.470
recently.
Uh,
the,
the concept,
I don't know why this didn't even occur to me,

429
00:26:33.471 --> 00:26:37.670
but of helping to take the lower back out of the equation by elevating the feet,

430
00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.780
elevating the fee.
Yup.
And elevating them as high as necessary.

431
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.010
Uh,
some,

432
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:49.010
<v 2>some people are so tight that they basically start in a handstand and it is what</v>

433
00:26:50.281 --> 00:26:51.114
it is,
right?
The,

434
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:55.050
the main thing that we try to always hammer with students is they're always in a

435
00:26:55.051 --> 00:26:58.440
hurry.
I've got to get it right now.
Even even our conversation,

436
00:26:58.441 --> 00:27:01.590
you remember way back when it started that way and I was like,
dude,

437
00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:05.550
this if you can handle it,
we need,
we need to change gears here.

438
00:27:05.551 --> 00:27:08.610
We need to go slow now in order to go fast later.

439
00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.620
If you want to be a stud later,

440
00:27:10.621 --> 00:27:14.430
you have to be a Pud now I think where your words,
yeah,
that,

441
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:19.080
that sounds like a smart ass remark.
That's a good one.
I wrote that down.

442
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:25.640
I've corrupted you all your great podcast and I've corrupted you.
Uh,

443
00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.690
so what are the other check boxes?

444
00:27:27.691 --> 00:27:31.220
So let's just say they get the feel and they're like,
okay,
feed,

445
00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:36.240
elevate it feet elevated to the point where they're not feeling stress on the

446
00:27:36.241 --> 00:27:37.074
lower back.

447
00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:42.660
Then now it'll depend on pressing strength also.

448
00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:45.810
So if they're,
if they're very weak in the shoulders,

449
00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.750
then they're going to have to start from the handset in and work their way down.

450
00:27:48.751 --> 00:27:50.700
But we'll assume they've got feet elevated,

451
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.770
hip high or higher if necessary.
It doesn't matter a bit.

452
00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:58.380
Then from there we're going to work on,

453
00:27:58.381 --> 00:28:00.780
most people are going to be up there going to have bent elbows.

454
00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:04.620
So we're going to work on straightening the arms no matter how close they are.

455
00:28:04.621 --> 00:28:08.250
They could be wide.
These why?
Yeah,
because,
gosh,

456
00:28:08.251 --> 00:28:12.750
I had one special forces guy that came to me years ago.
Uh,
tough,
tough guy,

457
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:16.860
first name mark and uh,
he had gained 80 pounds of muscle,

458
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:21.420
80 pounds a month.
Oh yeah.
He always just like,
holy moly.
And he was,

459
00:28:21.421 --> 00:28:23.760
he just a beast.
But uh,

460
00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:28.620
he had completely after himself up cause all he did was gaining strength without

461
00:28:28.621 --> 00:28:31.880
mobility and athletically.
If I'm not,
unless,

462
00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.830
unless my sport is just purely lifting,

463
00:28:34.831 --> 00:28:39.480
unless I'm a power lifter on less,
I'm an Olympic lifter.
Okay.

464
00:28:39.481 --> 00:28:44.190
Then then maximal strength is not my sole criteria for being successful.
In fact,

465
00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:48.870
usually the strongest athletes in the weight room are not the best athletes on

466
00:28:48.871 --> 00:28:51.420
the field of play.
And in fact,
I,

467
00:28:51.421 --> 00:28:54.990
I don't know a single exception and there may be one there somewhere that

468
00:28:54.991 --> 00:28:58.080
someone can share with us and letting me know.
But I've,

469
00:28:58.081 --> 00:29:00.960
I've been around the world.
You,

470
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.480
I won't say as many people as you know,

471
00:29:03.481 --> 00:29:07.170
but in 40 years of worldclass gymnastics,
I've,

472
00:29:07.171 --> 00:29:11.520
I've met a ton of people.
I've never seen an exception.
Uh,

473
00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:15.690
he couldn't even hang on a bar anymore without,
with his arms straight,

474
00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.770
without hitting his head.

475
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:22.430
Why you think your shoulders are tight?
Pull mark.
And he was like,
coach,
what,

476
00:29:22.431 --> 00:29:26.550
what can you do for me?
For once I was at a loss for words,

477
00:29:26.551 --> 00:29:31.510
which is rare for me.
I as I,
you know,
I,
I,
I think you're screwed dude.

478
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:34.860
I can fix this one.
It's a,

479
00:29:34.861 --> 00:29:38.010
what did you do with him when the bridge was he just stuck?

480
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:41.070
We couldn't even desk.
This was hanging on a bar.

481
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.660
We couldn't even get number there.
That was,
it was impossible.
Uh,

482
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:49.230
what we would do with someone like that.
And Mark,
so you're,
you're a more,

483
00:29:49.231 --> 00:29:52.540
it's all guys.
Just,
just to give the audience some,
some feedback.

484
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.970
I went into Tim's assessment

485
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.650
expecting medium,
medium,
and Tim.

486
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:04.120
Tim was much more mobile,
a much more athletic,

487
00:30:04.121 --> 00:30:07.930
much more well prepared than I had anticipated.
So we,

488
00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:12.700
I had spent a lot of time putting a custom program together for Tim that because

489
00:30:12.701 --> 00:30:14.410
he did so well in his assessment,

490
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:19.000
I had to throw the whole damn thing away and started over from scratch because

491
00:30:19.001 --> 00:30:20.650
basically you're [inaudible] was too,

492
00:30:20.651 --> 00:30:25.090
he was too advanced for what we had assumed.
He was coming to the table with,
uh,

493
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:29.290
someone who is crazy compromised.
Uh,

494
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:31.030
we're going to have to sneak up on it,
Oregon,

495
00:30:31.031 --> 00:30:34.500
where I have to get in there and we're going to have to first do pec minor when

496
00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:35.740
now this is not pec minor.

497
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:38.740
We got to get in there and we got to work on the BICEP tendon.

498
00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.400
Like I get the bicep tendon gone and we got to work on forearms,

499
00:30:42.401 --> 00:30:46.300
get forearms loose,
we've got to break the SCAP.
So there's some motion there.

500
00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:50.230
We have to do all of that.
And it's,
it's not high intensity work,

501
00:30:50.231 --> 00:30:55.230
but it's gotta be done.
And as you heard Tim say,
the body thrives on it.
It's,

502
00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.100
it's like a tonic for the body.

503
00:30:57.101 --> 00:31:00.730
The body feels so much better because it's what the body's supposed to do.

504
00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:04.390
And it's,
it's,
it's not,
what's the word I want?

505
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:08.290
It's not a lot of people don't care for it cause it's not the high intensity,

506
00:31:08.291 --> 00:31:09.310
sexy work,

507
00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:14.670
but it's that fundamental work that makes the high intensity sexy work possible

508
00:31:15.881 --> 00:31:20.290
later.
Well,
bloodily possible.
That's safer.
Uh,
that's,

509
00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.850
that's a good point.
Cause we had,
I think one of the questions that people asked,

510
00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.270
you know,
I date,
uh,

511
00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:30.060
I think one of the Tim asked for questions on Twitter and,
um,
you know,

512
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:31.630
what would you like me to ask coach?
Some are,

513
00:31:31.631 --> 00:31:33.610
and some of the people came back with,
you know,

514
00:31:33.611 --> 00:31:38.230
I know someone who's a gymnast and they're just beat the shit.
And My,

515
00:31:38.231 --> 00:31:43.030
my answer to that is simple.
They weren't my athlete,
they weren't my athlete.

516
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.120
We don't train through pain.
Uh,

517
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.410
as a national team coach for a long time,
uh,

518
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:54.370
physical preparation was always our number one priority.

519
00:31:54.371 --> 00:31:58.240
We built the physical structure first because if you think about it,

520
00:31:58.241 --> 00:31:59.230
it's kind of silly.
We,

521
00:31:59.231 --> 00:32:01.980
and we see this a lot with people who are getting into weightlifting there,

522
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:05.380
crossfitters there,
Olympic lifting and they're,
they're enthusiastic,

523
00:32:05.381 --> 00:32:09.400
they're excited and they want to get that weight on the bar and they're,

524
00:32:09.401 --> 00:32:12.790
they're trying to build technique with a flawed range of motion,

525
00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:15.460
which of course gives them FDIC technique and it doesn't work.

526
00:32:15.461 --> 00:32:18.130
And then they get hurt.
Or You,
you hear someone,
Oh,

527
00:32:18.131 --> 00:32:21.370
I changed my shoe and I blew my knee.
Seriously,

528
00:32:21.371 --> 00:32:24.820
your knee is that tight that because your heel,
if you're new,

529
00:32:24.821 --> 00:32:28.360
she was a fraction of an inch higher or a slightly different angle that your

530
00:32:28.361 --> 00:32:32.590
need blue words.
And in our training program,
we need to call everything.

531
00:32:32.591 --> 00:32:37.060
You need an optimal surplus.
You need an optimal surplus.
Range of mobility,

532
00:32:37.061 --> 00:32:39.890
range of motion.
You need optimal surplus strength.

533
00:32:39.891 --> 00:32:42.650
You need the optimal surplus of stability.

534
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:47.830
You need what you need to perform and a little extra for when things go south.

535
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.260
Not if things go south when things go south.

536
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:56.570
And if you're just riding the edge of what you're capable of,
it's and they hope,

537
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.900
oh,
nothing will go wrong.
I open other than a little wrong,
oh,

538
00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:01.920
it is going to go wrong.
It's absolutely going to go wrong.
And so you,

539
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:05.690
you prepare the body for that ahead of time.
So when it does go wrong,
it's like,

540
00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:10.280
oh,
that didn't hurt.
I didn't get nothing.
Nothing's injured.
Moving on.
Next turn.

541
00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:11.221
<v 4>Well,</v>

542
00:33:11.221 --> 00:33:14.670
one of the questions that you've asked me multiple times when we've been going

543
00:33:14.671 --> 00:33:18.210
over different workouts,
and I would mention for instance,
uh,

544
00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:23.080
I felt it in my Bicep,
I felt an extreme stretch in my bicep.

545
00:33:23.081 --> 00:33:27.120
So for instance,
there's a movement that we've been calling a German hang.

546
00:33:27.121 --> 00:33:31.140
A lot of people would call it skin the cat.
Uh,
perhaps,
uh,

547
00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:34.560
very similar where you would hold on to say a bar or rings in this case.

548
00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:39.150
And I'm just,
I'm going to get to simplify this of course,
but talking up,

549
00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:43.350
going back in between the rings and then hanging down,

550
00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:47.470
um,
with my,
with as little of a,

551
00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:53.160
a pike at the hips as possible.
Right.
Nice.
Flat back,
nice straight hips.
Exactly.

552
00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.620
And uh,
sort of palms facing towards the ground.

553
00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:58.950
And I was saying I really felt an incredible stretch in my biceps more than in

554
00:33:58.951 --> 00:34:00.330
the shoulders.
And your question would be,

555
00:34:00.331 --> 00:34:02.220
and this is applied to different body parts,

556
00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:04.440
where did you feel that in the Bicep,

557
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:09.470
this is getting back to the not training through pain comment and you,

558
00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:15.360
can you describe why that would have loved to the whole,

559
00:34:15.361 --> 00:34:19.260
the middle of your,
like if it's in the middle,
I don't really care.
Um,

560
00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:22.290
in same for like the ABS.
Like we can smash those all day long.

561
00:34:22.291 --> 00:34:24.390
If it's at the attachment points though,

562
00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:28.620
then I want to know about it or we're going to dial it back.
Yeah.
So why is that

563
00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:33.840
<v 2>real quick?
So most people,
I'm going to sneak around to it.</v>

564
00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:37.930
So most people when they,
when they do their training,
they,
uh,

565
00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:40.500
meaning well meaning well,
and I'm not,

566
00:34:40.501 --> 00:34:45.030
I'm not slamming anyone by any means and they only reason that we know this and

567
00:34:45.031 --> 00:34:47.970
are able to share is because all these years I've been doing this,

568
00:34:47.971 --> 00:34:50.220
I made the same f and mistakes that they make.

569
00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.610
We just survived my stupidity and learn how to do better.

570
00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.950
The store it story of my life.
A story of all of our lives,
right?

571
00:34:58.951 --> 00:35:00.780
I used to tell my athletes there,

572
00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:03.120
there are stupid gymnast and there are old gymnast,

573
00:35:03.121 --> 00:35:06.060
but there are no old stupid gymnast cause they're all dead.

574
00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:09.300
But most people,

575
00:35:09.301 --> 00:35:14.301
most beginners that they want to base all their training off muscular fatigue,

576
00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:17.070
which is a problem.

577
00:35:17.071 --> 00:35:21.600
It's problematic because muscle tissue regenerates about every 90 days,

578
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:26.070
about every 90 days,
you know,
from,
from end to end.
All,
all the cells,

579
00:35:26.071 --> 00:35:29.340
everything's done in 90 days.
Okay,
that's,
well that's fine.

580
00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:33.030
But connective tissue takes 200 to 210 days.

581
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:38.250
So we have a huge gap.
So if I get in and just saying,
you know,
I'm,
I'm,

582
00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:39.990
I'm,

583
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:44.880
I'm not a big fan of beginner's training to failure simply because of their

584
00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:48.690
structure isn't mature enough yet to handle it safely.

585
00:35:48.691 --> 00:35:52.230
And by mature I simply mean enough productive,

586
00:35:52.231 --> 00:35:55.280
well structured hours under their belt and you know,

587
00:35:55.310 --> 00:36:00.020
it has nothing to do in new ranges of motion,
right.
If they've just really,

588
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:03.960
if there's joints,
you know,
if it's,
if it's a muscle belly for like you said,

589
00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:05.730
if we're doing core,
you know what,

590
00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.570
I will beat your core down all day long and I'm not worried about it at bay

591
00:36:09.571 --> 00:36:13.620
because it's just muscular fatigue.
But as soon as we get joints involved,

592
00:36:13.621 --> 00:36:17.540
everything changes and it's actually really easy for people to verify cause they

593
00:36:17.541 --> 00:36:21.440
ain't think back over all the injuries they've had over their training career
in,

594
00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:24.450
on their athletic career,
playing around with the kid in the backyard.

595
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:29.680
The vast majority of those injuries are all joint related.
I'll almost always is.

596
00:36:29.681 --> 00:36:34.170
It's extremely rare for someone to have a muscle belly injury.
It just,

597
00:36:34.171 --> 00:36:37.830
it just doesn't happen yet.
Their training,
especially in the beginning,

598
00:36:37.831 --> 00:36:41.970
is all skewed just towards muscular develop and not connective tissue

599
00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:44.310
development.
And that's,
that's where they get into trouble.

600
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:49.290
So when they come to us,
the first thing we like is for them to spend.
And it's,

601
00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:54.000
is it going to be boring?
It is,
you know,
200,
200,
10 days.
We're talking six,

602
00:36:54.001 --> 00:36:58.260
seven months of dial it back guys,
dial it back.

603
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:02.310
I think that the,

604
00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:07.850
it's important to emphasize too that dialing it back doesn't mean it means that

605
00:37:09.601 --> 00:37:12.090
you're not rushing,
but it doesn't mean that you,

606
00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:16.290
it doesn't mean you won't experience a lot of progress.
If that's fair to say.

607
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:20.610
I mean,
I think that's crazy.
Say,
and you,
you found that yourself.

608
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:24.720
But what happens is some of them we run into this.

609
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:29.490
Maybe you have also as we get some people who are addicted to the rush there,

610
00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.700
they're addicted to the adrenaline rush.
They're addicted to lay in there,

611
00:37:32.701 --> 00:37:36.930
in a pile of sweat.
Uh,
you know,
they want to do the sweat angels,

612
00:37:36.931 --> 00:37:38.640
they want to crawl out of the gym.

613
00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.810
And the problem with that is if you're a world class athlete,

614
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.090
you can't do that.

615
00:37:45.091 --> 00:37:48.000
Cause I have to be back in the gym the next day and train again.

616
00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:52.170
I can't afford a destroy myself or the special operations guys we work with.

617
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.330
You know,
we've,
we've gotta be able to do both.

618
00:37:54.331 --> 00:37:58.170
They've got to be operational and increase their performance through their

619
00:37:58.171 --> 00:37:59.970
training,
but they have to go hand in hand.

620
00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:04.840
And so it's only in beginners that we see that,
uh,
they,

621
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:09.300
they think somehow they can cheat time and it can't be done.
I mean,

622
00:38:09.301 --> 00:38:12.810
connective tissues Gunna take 200 to 210 days.

623
00:38:12.811 --> 00:38:16.020
There's no supplement.
You can't paint yourself blue.

624
00:38:16.021 --> 00:38:17.640
You can't dance under the moon.
There's,

625
00:38:17.641 --> 00:38:21.270
there's nothing you can do to speed that up.
It's going to take what it takes.

626
00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:26.610
And so we work as hard as we can within those parameters.
If there's joint pain,

627
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:31.650
we shut it down.
It's like you,
your elbows,
a good example.
Years ago,

628
00:38:31.651 --> 00:38:35.980
pushing too hard now that,
that,
oh,
if we tweaked that elbow a little too much,

629
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.670
<v 3>it flares up on Ya,
we'll repair it.
It's going to take time,</v>

630
00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:43.510
but it takes much longer to repair it than it does to avoid it in the first

631
00:38:43.511 --> 00:38:46.130
place.
Yeah,
for sure.
And uh,

632
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:49.690
it just a couple of of notes and then I'm going to swing back to the,

633
00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.900
the diagnostics,
you know,
how people can,
can assess.

634
00:38:52.901 --> 00:38:57.100
But another conversation that,
that uh,
you know,
topic that came up,

635
00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.790
I think I'm sure I brought it up in,
uh,

636
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:04.860
at dinner once was the use of anabolics or anytime growth agents and the,

637
00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.530
the point that you've made,

638
00:39:08.531 --> 00:39:13.531
which makes perfect sense is that would just increase the likelihood of having

639
00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:18.190
connected tissue problems and gymnast because,
uh,

640
00:39:18.191 --> 00:39:22.630
the muscular strength and growth will outpace the development of and the

641
00:39:22.631 --> 00:39:27.460
adaptation of the tissues.
Uh,
I'd come completely went backfire,

642
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:32.500
huge backfire because we like our r s w a lot of our power come where we'd like

643
00:39:32.681 --> 00:39:35.770
to get where students make their,
their greatest gains in strength has,
did,

644
00:39:35.771 --> 00:39:40.490
enabled to do dynamic plyometric work and straight on ring strength.

645
00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:45.690
Those are your two biggest bangs for the buck and what we have learned the hard

646
00:39:46.061 --> 00:39:46.400
way.

647
00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.750
That's different than main difference between working with young developmental

648
00:39:49.751 --> 00:39:54.040
athletes and full grown adults is the order in which we need to present the

649
00:39:54.041 --> 00:39:57.700
material we have to do.
As a young,
a young athlete,
I,

650
00:39:57.701 --> 00:40:00.870
I can do all physical components at once.
I can do plyometric,

651
00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:05.260
I can do straight arm,
I can do their mobility bent arm,
it doesn't matter a bit.

652
00:40:05.261 --> 00:40:06.520
I can do it all at one time.

653
00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:11.740
But an adult who's now fragile from years of making a living right,

654
00:40:11.741 --> 00:40:15.760
sitting at a desk,
uh,
day in,
day out.
So they get a little older,

655
00:40:15.761 --> 00:40:18.700
kids get bigger levels of activities,
drop,
drop,
drop,
drop,

656
00:40:18.701 --> 00:40:21.960
drop and they're compromised.
So we'd got,

657
00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:24.310
we have to build these things in a different order.

658
00:40:24.311 --> 00:40:29.220
We have to first go rebuild mobility,
then we have to rebuild core Rico,

659
00:40:29.221 --> 00:40:34.000
I'm talking not just avs but it'll bleaks and lower back.
Uh,
most adults,

660
00:40:34.001 --> 00:40:38.740
a lot of their lower back pain isn't lower back related.
It's sill bleak related.

661
00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.730
And um,
we,
we have to go in and we have to correct that.

662
00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:46.270
Then we can worry about regular strength.
Once those things are done,

663
00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.270
then we can get to the moneymaker,
which is their dynamic strength.

664
00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:51.130
But with an adult,

665
00:40:51.131 --> 00:40:55.120
especially a strong adult who's been athletically inactive,

666
00:40:55.210 --> 00:41:00.100
so they've been doing strength training but not out moving,
doing sports,

667
00:41:00.101 --> 00:41:01.810
being active,
you know,

668
00:41:01.811 --> 00:41:05.650
outside of their conditioning or let's say for example,

669
00:41:05.651 --> 00:41:10.651
all they're doing is squats and they're very linear and the path of their knee

670
00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:15.640
and there's no meniscus work.
There's no MCL work,
there's no ACL work.

671
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:18.910
Then they go outside,
they play a little softball here at all the time.
Yeah.

672
00:41:18.911 --> 00:41:23.620
When I was playing softball,
I blew my knee going around first base.
Really?

673
00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:28.270
How many kids blow a knee running around first base?
Well that's,

674
00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:32.860
I mean the supplemental knee exercises that look Wacky as hell when you first

675
00:41:32.861 --> 00:41:33.980
look at them that you've had

676
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.490
<v 4>me do,
and maybe we can,
we can show some of this to two people in the show notes.</v>

677
00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:41.810
I'm sure even in the span of three or four weeks,

678
00:41:41.811 --> 00:41:46.640
I've seen a huge difference in knee stability improvement because I haven't ever

679
00:41:46.641 --> 00:41:50.270
done,
I haven't ever performed these types of targeted movements before.

680
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.180
And going back to the diagnostics,

681
00:41:53.181 --> 00:41:56.750
so we talked to about the bridge,

682
00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.800
we talked about the hanging leg lifts,
uh,
what,

683
00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:06.140
uh,
are there any other movement?
Shoulder,
shoulder extension will be huge,

684
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:10.470
so sure.
Extension would be sitting on the floor,
say

685
00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:15.560
has sitting in that pike that you described earlier.
Uh,

686
00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:19.850
hands touching behind them and then without letting the hands move,

687
00:42:19.851 --> 00:42:23.390
trying to scoot the but as far forward away from the hands as they could.

688
00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:27.560
And so that's a meeting and they just,
that one movement right there,

689
00:42:27.561 --> 00:42:31.910
it's kind of,
let us see.
It's going to show me their scapular health.

690
00:42:31.911 --> 00:42:36.200
Can they protrack and they retract and it's going to tell me how tight their Pec

691
00:42:36.201 --> 00:42:37.034
minor is.

692
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:42.980
It's going to tell me how tight their bicep is and it's going to tell me how

693
00:42:42.981 --> 00:42:47.540
tight their brachy Alice down by the elbow is.
Oh,
the Brachy Alice?

694
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:51.500
Yes.
Your favorite.
And my good friend.
The brachialis,

695
00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.950
the and also just the,
and this relates to kind of daily living.

696
00:42:54.951 --> 00:42:58.430
A lot of people who have back pain,
myself included quite a few years ago.

697
00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:01.130
If you're wondering if you have a tight pec minor,

698
00:43:01.131 --> 00:43:03.200
you can just Google Pec minor figured out where it is,

699
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:07.940
but basically think right under the clavicle,
get a Lacrosse ball and uh,

700
00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:12.110
you know,
go on the wall and try to roll out your Pec minor with a Lacrosse Ball.

701
00:43:12.111 --> 00:43:13.760
And if it's,
if you have back pain,

702
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:18.800
you don't always fix that back pain by just focusing on the location of that

703
00:43:18.801 --> 00:43:23.150
pain a once a good point and you start addressing the Pec minor.

704
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:25.130
And a lot of that stuff just alleviate is,
is,

705
00:43:25.131 --> 00:43:30.131
is alleviated and I want to throw one thing out there just for people who might

706
00:43:30.201 --> 00:43:32.810
be interested in that.
And,
and that is,

707
00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:38.000
I think part of the reason I seemed or was better prepared for the assessment

708
00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:39.860
then I would have been otherwise,

709
00:43:39.861 --> 00:43:44.030
is that I started doing really just one thing,

710
00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:46.580
one type of new exercise,

711
00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:51.140
which was compression strength training in that pipe position.

712
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:57.350
And did that for just baby,
uh,
two times per week,
uh,

713
00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:00.950
prior to doing the assessment as I was traveling and for people who are

714
00:44:00.951 --> 00:44:05.840
wondering what this is like,
if you really want to feel humbled,
uh,

715
00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.510
as I did.
So I was in,
I was traveling,

716
00:44:08.511 --> 00:44:11.570
I was in Columbia and very close friend of mine,
uh,

717
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:15.770
almost got to PR professional rugby in New Zealand.
He's a beast.

718
00:44:15.771 --> 00:44:20.330
I mean athletically,
extremely strong,
extremely fast.

719
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:22.100
Uh,
I mean he,
he's,

720
00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.280
he's always going to be one of the top performers in the gym when he walks into

721
00:44:25.281 --> 00:44:27.410
a weight room.
And,
uh,

722
00:44:27.411 --> 00:44:31.440
he saw me doing pike pulses and so I'll explain what this is folks,

723
00:44:31.441 --> 00:44:33.120
because he was Kinda laughing at me and he's like,

724
00:44:33.121 --> 00:44:35.340
what kind of Jane Fonda Bullshit are you doing here?
You know,

725
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:40.470
and I love that name.
And I said,
all right,
I like it.
All right,
big guy.

726
00:44:40.471 --> 00:44:42.390
You're so used to just tough guy.
Let's see you do these.

727
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:45.090
So for those people who were interested in,
so you're sitting in this,

728
00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.070
this seated pike position we're talking about,
right?

729
00:44:47.071 --> 00:44:49.750
So you're sitting on your ass on the floor,
uh,

730
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:54.600
the upper body perpendicular with the floor and your legs out straight in front

731
00:44:54.601 --> 00:44:58.260
of you and point your toes kind of tense your quads to push the back of your

732
00:44:58.261 --> 00:45:03.090
knees into the floor.
Then reach forward and stretch forward as far as you can.

733
00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:06.300
Get your fingers out on either side of your legs as far out as you can.

734
00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:08.250
And then just try to lift your heels off the ground,

735
00:45:08.251 --> 00:45:12.830
keeping your legs completely straight and just pulse it up and down.
Uh,

736
00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:16.410
I got a three to four inches.
Maybe if you can manage that and just do,

737
00:45:16.411 --> 00:45:17.820
try to do 30 of those.
And My,

738
00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:23.220
my buddy could not lift his heels off the ground and just fell over laughing.

739
00:45:23.221 --> 00:45:26.700
He's like,
yeah,
okay.
Those are hard.
But that compression,
it's,

740
00:45:26.701 --> 00:45:30.750
if you think about the range of motion than most people train for core,

741
00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:31.973
uh,

742
00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:37.130
they're doing sit ups or maybe they're doing hanging leg lifts up to like an l

743
00:45:38.161 --> 00:45:41.130
sit,
right?
So they're,
their legs are getting up to kind of parallel height.

744
00:45:41.131 --> 00:45:45.930
Well that last 90 degrees and especially the last like 45 degrees where you're

745
00:45:45.931 --> 00:45:49.890
bringing your thighs towards your chest is so hard.
I mean,

746
00:45:49.891 --> 00:45:52.560
I had zero strength there,
uh,

747
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:57.490
prior to doing just a few weeks of this stuff,
which just,
it just amazed me.
Um,

748
00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:00.870
and for those people also were talking about the transverse abdominous coach.

749
00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:01.711
Feel free to veto this,

750
00:46:01.711 --> 00:46:05.160
but I think it's also nicknamed the corset muscle if you're trying to think of

751
00:46:05.161 --> 00:46:09.420
what they might look like is,
it wraps around the abdomen.
So if you can,

752
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.780
if you cough a lot or laugh a lot and get really,
really sore,

753
00:46:12.781 --> 00:46:17.700
it's very frequently,
often,
or it's engaging that transverse.

754
00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:23.130
Um,
but let me ask you,
so you mentioned crossfit.

755
00:46:23.131 --> 00:46:26.370
You mentioned a couple of things he knew drenched in sweat,
doing the snow,

756
00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:28.950
not snow angels,
but a sweat angels.

757
00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:33.130
What are your feelings about,
uh,

758
00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:35.610
kipping movements like kipping pull ups

759
00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:39.150
<v 2>had open that can of worms.</v>

760
00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.470
<v 4>Well,
I was asking a mutual friend,
I won't name him and I said,</v>

761
00:46:44.471 --> 00:46:47.200
what should I talk to coach summer about?
And he said,
kipping pull ups,

762
00:46:47.201 --> 00:46:49.440
he'll lose his shit.
So I said,
okay,
I got it.

763
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:51.730
<v 2>We started,</v>

764
00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:55.850
I was the original gymnastics guy for crossfit and way back in the early two

765
00:46:55.851 --> 00:46:58.820
thousands then ended up leaving.
I was,

766
00:46:58.821 --> 00:47:02.990
I was there before there was the first crossfit affiliate when all there was,

767
00:47:02.991 --> 00:47:07.460
was classmen working out of that little gem in Santa Cruz,
uh,

768
00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:13.430
left.
Just because you know,
to,
to do gos t right.
Like anything,
you know,

769
00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:17.000
a dichotomy that I always find curious with people,

770
00:47:17.001 --> 00:47:22.001
especially the cross fitters is they will be so on point with dissecting

771
00:47:24.381 --> 00:47:28.930
everything they do in terms of their Olympic lifting.
You know,
my pool is here,

772
00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:32.020
my era,
my knee was the quarter inch this way,
diamond.
They,

773
00:47:32.021 --> 00:47:35.170
they're just methodical and they don't bring,

774
00:47:35.171 --> 00:47:39.250
and I shouldn't say just just crossfitters,
but then they other people,

775
00:47:39.251 --> 00:47:44.251
they don't bring that same degree of attention to detail to their bodyweight

776
00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:44.950
work.

777
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:48.850
So want one is supposed to be meticulous and one is somehow just supposed to be

778
00:47:48.851 --> 00:47:53.020
thrown together and yet they expect the same quality results.

779
00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:58.030
So if we,
if we look back
back in the day,

780
00:47:58.031 --> 00:48:02.080
crossfit,
you know,
they're lifting was,
was nothing by national standards.

781
00:48:02.081 --> 00:48:06.640
Now they get people who are qualifying to go to nationals fast forward all those

782
00:48:06.641 --> 00:48:08.980
years in terms of their gym,
massive strength training.

783
00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:13.630
And they're not even remotely close.
They don't match a national team.

784
00:48:13.631 --> 00:48:18.631
They don't match a state level athlete who let alone a national level,

785
00:48:19.211 --> 00:48:22.570
let alone an international level there.
They're not even in the same ballpark.

786
00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.270
And part of the issue is because

787
00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:31.810
the kipping pull ups were,
we're a huge big deal.
It was a money maker.
You know,

788
00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.970
man,
I'll,
I'll be straight out of piss some people off,

789
00:48:33.971 --> 00:48:38.800
but it was a money maker as advertising for a program they could bring someone

790
00:48:38.801 --> 00:48:41.800
in and uh,
who's never been able to do a pull up,

791
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:45.700
have them hold their gen by the bar and uh,
let them fall,

792
00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.010
hit the bottom of that movement,

793
00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:51.940
bounce back to the top and the person's eyes light up and they're like,
you know,

794
00:48:51.941 --> 00:48:55.400
this is the best effing thing ever.
I've never done a pull of my entire life.

795
00:48:55.401 --> 00:48:58.540
All my God,
Oh my God.
And they're pumped and they're pumped.

796
00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:03.670
What they didn't realize is that this person has compromised basic strength and

797
00:49:03.671 --> 00:49:05.230
compromise shoulder flection.
They don't,

798
00:49:05.231 --> 00:49:07.000
they don't have mobility in their shoulder,

799
00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:10.660
so they're hitting the bottom of that movement with multiples of body weight.

800
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:12.580
So they weren't strong enough to do a regular pullup.

801
00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:16.360
So now we're going to drop them on connective tissue with multiples of body

802
00:49:16.361 --> 00:49:18.910
weight that's gotta go somewhere.

803
00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:22.960
So it's going to force that shoulder to open further than it can handle.

804
00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:26.200
And I'm going to bounce off that connected tissue like a trampoline back to the

805
00:49:26.201 --> 00:49:29.470
top of the bar,
and then to make,
to pour salt on the wound.

806
00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:33.040
Now I'm going to do a shitload of reps at the same time.
I'm just,

807
00:49:33.041 --> 00:49:34.090
I'm just going to crank on it.

808
00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:37.840
And they were getting people who were coming in and you know,
cross well there's,

809
00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:41.830
there's,
there's no proof.
There's auto de,
you know,
bullshit bullshit you got,

810
00:49:41.831 --> 00:49:45.430
you guys can live in a dream world all you want.
It was,
it was blowing people up.

811
00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:49.690
And now the good thing though,
and to their credit,
you know,
it took time.

812
00:49:49.691 --> 00:49:52.580
There was a denial.
No it has nothing to do with it.
But uh,

813
00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:54.970
now we're seeing our recommendation of,
you know,
what guys,

814
00:49:54.971 --> 00:49:58.150
we got to start getting some basic strength built first,

815
00:49:58.450 --> 00:50:02.920
some basic mobility and then at that time kipping pull ups.
Yeah,
absolutely.

816
00:50:02.921 --> 00:50:04.450
There's nothing wrong and that they're healthy.

817
00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:08.740
They're good to do on a healthy shoulder joint with a good foundation of basic

818
00:50:08.741 --> 00:50:12.400
strength.
But it'd be Ginter doing kipping pull ups.
Really that's,

819
00:50:12.401 --> 00:50:15.400
that's insanity.
That's,
that's just pouring gasoline on a fire.

820
00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:19.690
So kipping then is the finishing edition.

821
00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:23.830
It is not the starting and a little bit we,
we would never,
you know,
we were,

822
00:50:23.831 --> 00:50:28.550
we started working with adults.
So our first,
we do all around the world,
you know,

823
00:50:28.551 --> 00:50:33.500
we spend,
we spend a lot of time doing hands on and our very first one we did,

824
00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:35.900
I don't know,
2007 or so.

825
00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:39.680
And we've got all these people who've got all these bees here and they're
strong.

826
00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:45.070
And I tried to do my entry level plyometric work on some floor work with them

827
00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:51.590
and the stronger the athlete,
the faster they went down.
Knees,

828
00:50:51.591 --> 00:50:56.060
lower back,
ankles on baby stuff,
baby stuff.
I,

829
00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:57.200
we're not talking anything hard.

830
00:50:57.201 --> 00:50:59.840
We're talking about standing in place and with knees straight,

831
00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:04.250
being able to bounce down the floor using just your calves.
No Way.
Their,

832
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:06.200
their tissues couldn't take it.
They hadn't,

833
00:51:06.201 --> 00:51:10.880
they hadn't done anything like it or we had 15 minutes on the schedule.

834
00:51:10.881 --> 00:51:15.140
For example,
how bad mobility was.
We had 15 minutes on the schedule to stretch.

835
00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:18.650
Nothing hard,
nothing intricate,
nothing intense,

836
00:51:18.651 --> 00:51:22.190
just an easy basic stretch.
Get on,
loosened up for the day.

837
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:27.680
That stretch took an hour and a half to complete and I was,
oh man,

838
00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.560
it was an hour and a half,
10.
It was an hour and a half.

839
00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:32.840
There were bodies lying everywhere.

840
00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:37.570
It was like I was in Vietnam or a longer filming,
filming a war movie and I,

841
00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:41.300
I turned,
I turned to my staff.
I'm like,
what the fuck am I supposed to do now?

842
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:45.180
They failed warmup.
They failed warm up.

843
00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:50.420
<v 4>No,
it fair.
It is.
This stuff is really you,
you,</v>

844
00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:52.320
you would look at it and just like my friend is like,

845
00:51:52.321 --> 00:51:55.530
what is this Jane Fonda Bullshit?
And I'm like,
hey man,

846
00:51:55.560 --> 00:52:00.030
why don't you try this for 10 minutes?
It is really taxing.

847
00:52:00.031 --> 00:52:04.260
I mean I remember doing one of the stretching routines,

848
00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:06.030
which I'll note I think is,

849
00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:11.060
is might be of interest to people is I'm hitting each once per week.

850
00:52:11.131 --> 00:52:15.210
So there's one that is [inaudible] split focus safari hamstring focus.

851
00:52:15.211 --> 00:52:20.211
There's one that is bridge focus to another that is a middle split.

852
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:23.520
I'll add doctor and middle split focus inside of the thigh.

853
00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:28.260
And the point that you make is doing this twice a week will not double your

854
00:52:28.261 --> 00:52:29.700
progress.
It,
we'll cut it in half.

855
00:52:29.701 --> 00:52:31.830
So you're only really hitting each of these once per week.

856
00:52:31.831 --> 00:52:34.680
I mean there are different daily limber protocols,

857
00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:39.590
but I remember doing at the very beginning of one of these workouts,
uh,

858
00:52:39.591 --> 00:52:44.580
I believe it was and it was absolutely the uh,
the front split workout.

859
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:49.240
A shit ton for me.
A shit ton of,
of Ah,

860
00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:51.510
calf raises with a different number.

861
00:52:51.511 --> 00:52:54.540
You Moan in about like different foot placements.
It's like,
okay,

862
00:52:54.541 --> 00:52:59.460
180 calf raises later of different variations.
I was like,
okay,

863
00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:03.750
and I'm only three minutes into this an hour long straight sequence.

864
00:53:04.170 --> 00:53:05.130
Uh,
but,

865
00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:07.590
and I know we're bouncing all over the place because I want to give people kind

866
00:53:07.591 --> 00:53:10.620
of a buffet sampling of,
of how this training differs.

867
00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:15.890
But one of the reasons I respect the programming that you put together and the

868
00:53:16.081 --> 00:53:19.680
nuance that you bring to this is that the observation then is,

869
00:53:19.681 --> 00:53:22.470
and correct me if I'm,
or you can elaborate on this if I'm missing something,

870
00:53:22.471 --> 00:53:26.250
but that a lot of the hamstring issues

871
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:29.160
<v 3>or limitations that people perceive our,</v>

872
00:53:29.161 --> 00:53:33.840
at least in part due to lower leg absolutely issues,

873
00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:38.880
including the huge amount of,
Huh.
Yeah.
Including the Achilles.
So you,
you,
uh,

874
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:43.230
in this,
in this particular progression,
in the beginning you're hitting,

875
00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:47.240
you're stretching the urine gorging and then stretching the,

876
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:51.690
the insertion point basically around the heel and then again at the knee and

877
00:53:51.691 --> 00:53:55.940
working your way up to the hamstrings.
And,
um,
there's a,
uh,

878
00:53:56.040 --> 00:54:00.630
an athlete has been on the podcast,
a Amelia Boone,
one of the most successful,
uh,

879
00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:02.610
obstacle course racers in the world.
And in,

880
00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:05.040
she's basically point out the same thing.
And she said,
yeah,

881
00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:07.500
you can take someone who's really inflexible in their hamstrings,

882
00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:11.400
have them roll out their feet with sale lacrosse ball or something like that.

883
00:54:11.401 --> 00:54:16.170
And all of a sudden they gain two inches in there to set with the hamstrings.

884
00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:19.080
Uh,
because it's,
it's all connected,
you know,
we,

885
00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:23.460
we found by accident so that we never intended this and it,
we just,

886
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.900
we're very methodic.
So part,

887
00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:30.220
part of what maybe helps people to understand the layers of complexity though,

888
00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:34.520
that I approached training with is that for years my,

889
00:54:34.521 --> 00:54:37.950
my bread and butter was to produce best athletes in the country.

890
00:54:37.951 --> 00:54:40.320
That that was my job.
In order to have a job,

891
00:54:40.321 --> 00:54:43.410
I had to produce some of the best athletes in the world and we,

892
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:47.840
we had to do it from scratch.
And so that it becomes an issue of one,

893
00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:52.730
an injured in athlete is no good to United States.
My Dad,

894
00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.840
doesn't matter how talented has,
how strong he is,

895
00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:58.880
if he can't go out on the floor with USA on his chest,
we,

896
00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.590
we can't not win a medal with him.
So he's got to be healthy.

897
00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:05.910
And then the second caveat that goes with that is that

898
00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:08.680
<v 5>okay,</v>

899
00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:13.510
<v 3>we,
we have to,
so where I have,
I have to describe it correctly.</v>

900
00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:19.180
All right,
we're trying to find a way to make the best better.

901
00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:21.401
Is He,
these are,

902
00:55:21.401 --> 00:55:25.120
these athletes are already the best on the planet and you're going head to head

903
00:55:25.121 --> 00:55:26.770
with other athletes who are the best.

904
00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:31.900
So then how do you find a way to make something which is almost already perfect,

905
00:55:32.170 --> 00:55:33.610
even closer to perfect.

906
00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:37.390
And if you do what everybody else is doing right,

907
00:55:37.391 --> 00:55:39.910
without kind of going out into the jungle,
if you will,

908
00:55:39.911 --> 00:55:42.580
into Indian country and learning new things,

909
00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:47.740
then you can't get a leg up on your competitors though the way knowledge off we

910
00:55:47.741 --> 00:55:50.140
go.
We have PhDs who come through on this and,
and we,

911
00:55:50.141 --> 00:55:51.910
we always give them major shit,

912
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:56.950
major shit because the way people think the world works is that they do their

913
00:55:56.951 --> 00:56:01.480
research,
they write about it,
they publish it,
we learn about it,

914
00:56:01.481 --> 00:56:04.200
and we implement it with our athletes that need,

915
00:56:04.210 --> 00:56:06.280
that is not how the way the world works.

916
00:56:06.281 --> 00:56:11.050
The way it really works is you've got high level worldclass coaches who are

917
00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:15.750
super bright,
decades of experience.
You know,
just my last senior athlete alone,

918
00:56:15.751 --> 00:56:18.730
I had 16,000 hours into training,
Alan,

919
00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:24.250
16,000 hours spread over 12 years.
What does Alan's last power

920
00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:27.490
<v 2>power.
So yeah,
you guys got to celebrate Allen.
He uh,
oh,</v>

921
00:56:27.491 --> 00:56:32.440
you just a one national NCAA championships again,

922
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:37.470
major blowout by the largest margin in NCA history as of this recording very

923
00:56:39.641 --> 00:56:43.510
recently.
Yeah.
That was just a,
this uh,
goodness.

924
00:56:43.511 --> 00:56:45.310
The weekend of the 15th.

925
00:56:45.740 --> 00:56:49.660
So I think we're scheduled here to come out sometime in May,
but yeah,
very,

926
00:56:49.661 --> 00:56:54.250
very big deal.
But,
uh,
you know,
to,
to go back to the other.

927
00:56:54.251 --> 00:56:56.290
So we're looking for looking for an edge.

928
00:56:56.590 --> 00:57:00.610
And so we don't know why some things work.
We just know it works.

929
00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:04.960
And I started getting notes from therapists around the world because there are,

930
00:57:04.961 --> 00:57:09.070
for example,
therapists are taught that they should have a neutral spine.

931
00:57:09.460 --> 00:57:10.720
You should have a neutral spine.

932
00:57:10.721 --> 00:57:12.850
And I was getting people from around the world and they were writing me.

933
00:57:12.851 --> 00:57:15.700
But athletically,
I'm sorry,
I'll be direct,

934
00:57:15.701 --> 00:57:19.750
but neutral spine athletically is the biggest load of horse shit I've ever heard

935
00:57:19.751 --> 00:57:22.780
in my life.
It's,
you can't run with neutral spine.

936
00:57:22.781 --> 00:57:25.690
You can't throw with neutral spine.
You can't climb with neutral's fine.

937
00:57:25.691 --> 00:57:26.530
I can't swim.

938
00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:30.730
I can't do anything with a neutral spine except lay in a box,

939
00:57:30.731 --> 00:57:33.190
Doug in a hole and they get ready to bury me.
I mean that's,

940
00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:34.660
that's the only thing I can do it.

941
00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:37.390
There's nothing athletically I can do with a neutral spine.

942
00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:41.080
So we know just automatically to produce athletes.

943
00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:44.590
We're not going to do a neutral spine because torso wise there's only two

944
00:57:44.591 --> 00:57:45.011
movements.

945
00:57:45.011 --> 00:57:49.300
I can go from an arch snap to a hall or I couldn't be hauling and snap back to

946
00:57:49.301 --> 00:57:50.350
extension to the arch.

947
00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:53.920
Those are the only two movements the torsos capable of athletically.

948
00:57:54.310 --> 00:57:58.660
Everything else has a variation off that we can add rotation with some throws

949
00:57:58.661 --> 00:58:01.600
and some this and that.
But that's,
that's all there is.

950
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:06.870
So we spend a lot of time building power for that and these therapists around

951
00:58:07.451 --> 00:58:08.470
the world started taking,

952
00:58:08.471 --> 00:58:13.060
are really gentle introductory work and they'd train it on themselves first.

953
00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:15.970
And I'm like,
you know,
just real similar what you said to him.
You know,

954
00:58:15.971 --> 00:58:17.740
I feel better than I have in years coach.

955
00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:22.030
I feel better in years and this is completely different from what I was taught

956
00:58:22.031 --> 00:58:25.060
in school.
Well let's say absurd,
but maybe,

957
00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:29.680
maybe we could use an example that we've discussed before,

958
00:58:29.681 --> 00:58:32.650
which was a new movement for me,
which is the Jefferson curl.
And uh,

959
00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:36.520
yeah,
there's,
there are having some fun with that.

960
00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:38.920
So we look at Jefferson curl right now.

961
00:58:38.921 --> 00:58:43.780
So it wasn't that many years ago that if you squat below parallel,
you were,

962
00:58:43.781 --> 00:58:48.100
it was heresy.
It was heresy.
If you want,
if you went below parallel,
the knees,

963
00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:51.100
the knees couldn't possibly adapt to it,
you're just going to blow your knees.

964
00:58:51.101 --> 00:58:53.320
Your,
your kneecaps were going to just pop off.

965
00:58:53.321 --> 00:58:58.090
The front of our eyes can be shrapnel knee shrapnel and now,
yeah,

966
00:58:58.570 --> 00:59:00.700
but everybody accepts now that you know what,

967
00:59:00.701 --> 00:59:05.290
there is nothing wrong with the body being exposed to it's natural range of

968
00:59:05.291 --> 00:59:09.160
motion.
Now do you have to build it up gradually?
I saw,
obviously you do,

969
00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:13.120
but Jefferson curl falls into that.
So Gosh,

970
00:59:13.121 --> 00:59:16.270
how do we explain Jefferson Crow?
We're going to give it a,
I can give it a shot.

971
00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:19.900
Yeah,
you'll be better.
Good.
This would be a good exam review for me anyway.

972
00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:21.680
So Jefferson curl

973
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:25.250
<v 3>is a gradually rounded,</v>

974
00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:29.900
stiff legged deadlift.
That's the simplest way to visualize it.

975
00:59:29.901 --> 00:59:34.880
So if you're looking at an athlete from the side doing a Jefferson curl,

976
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:39.390
they will,
they will most likely be standing on a box,
uh,

977
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:44.160
holding on to an Olympic barbell right in front of their hips,

978
00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:47.930
slash,
legs.
So it's just like the,
the very top of a dead lift position.

979
00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:53.380
But when they start the descent and it's elevated so that when you have plates

980
00:59:53.811 --> 00:59:57.290
on and whatnot,
there's room for it.
But when,
when they come down,

981
00:59:57.291 --> 01:00:02.291
they're going to tuck their chin and then vertebra by Vertebra round their back

982
01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:08.090
down all the way into the bottom position where the objective would be,

983
01:00:08.091 --> 01:00:11.960
or one of the objectives would be to get basically your wrists to the front of

984
01:00:11.961 --> 01:00:15.790
your toes.
Or at least in a perfect world if you're advanced enough.
Yeah.

985
01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:16.910
In a perfect world.

986
01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:21.530
And of course doing this very gradually with supervised,

987
01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:26.060
uh,
attention from somebody who knows what they're doing and then reversing that.

988
01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.740
And again,
going from this sort of a,

989
01:00:29.741 --> 01:00:34.430
a vertebra by vertebra rounding up until you end up in that top position and

990
01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:39.050
then repeating,
uh,
is that a fair description?
Fair description?
Yeah,
the,

991
01:00:39.051 --> 01:00:40.010
the easiest.
Just,

992
01:00:40.011 --> 01:00:43.640
just think of it as a string of pearls and we're just curling one parole at a

993
01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:48.060
time.
We'd been,
we'd been having some fun with that one.
So we,

994
01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:52.430
we have done Jefferson Cross,
I don't know,
12,
15 years now,
uh,

995
01:00:52.431 --> 01:00:54.890
expected standard,
his body weight for us.

996
01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.560
A note to people listening,

997
01:00:57.561 --> 01:01:01.670
do not try this with bodyweight right out of the gate.
Don't.
So for example,

998
01:01:01.671 --> 01:01:06.290
one of our senior students in,
um,
in Australia,
uh,
in his training,

999
01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:10.010
physical therapists has his own clinic doing really well.
And um,

1000
01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:14.510
he tried it with just the,
the empty bar,
you know,
the 20 kilo bars first trashed,

1001
01:01:14.511 --> 01:01:18.760
then he dropped all the way down to I think a kilo or two,
right,

1002
01:01:18.761 --> 01:01:21.530
which is completely fine.
And what we'll talk about why in just a sec.

1003
01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:26.000
And then he'd built up.
And last time I checked with mark over the course of on,

1004
01:01:26.001 --> 01:01:27.650
and I'm,
I'm forgetting there's too many students,

1005
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:32.900
but around 12 to 18 months he'd dealt out to either three quarter body weight or

1006
01:01:32.901 --> 01:01:37.820
maybe up to full body weight.
Now,
and a back feels better than it ever has.

1007
01:01:38.090 --> 01:01:42.350
But the key there is people gotta understand is that this was a gradual process

1008
01:01:42.351 --> 01:01:46.850
over 12 to 18 months.
It wasn't just go.
Now we get,

1009
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:51.370
we've got a very good,
I'll throw Quinn out.
Uh,

1010
01:01:51.371 --> 01:01:56.210
I'm going to butcher Quinn's last name.
Quinn's a phd and physical therapy.
Quinn.

1011
01:01:56.211 --> 01:01:59.520
He not does some really good work.
And uh,

1012
01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:03.890
how do you spell being last name?
Oh,
you're going,
you had to ask me that.

1013
01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:07.540
We can get it for the show notes.
Yeah,
we'll,
we'll get it for the show.
Uh,
we,

1014
01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:12.630
we chat a lot on Facebook in that and a queen likes to stir the pot,

1015
01:02:13.491 --> 01:02:17.780
if you will.
Your Nostra up some shit.
And he's experimented with Jefferson.

1016
01:02:17.781 --> 01:02:20.130
Carl himself for,
I think going in about three

1017
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:25.130
<v 2>or four years now now and feels wonderful and he'll toss it out.</v>

1018
01:02:25.411 --> 01:02:28.010
And so one of the things that will always be come up is,
you know,
the,

1019
01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:33.050
the Miguel experiments where they would take a connective tissue from a pig

1020
01:02:34.261 --> 01:02:38.190
cadaver and put it under such and such amount of strain.

1021
01:02:38.191 --> 01:02:42.840
And if we put it in this position with this much load in snaps,
okay.

1022
01:02:42.841 --> 01:02:46.470
And everyone runs around in,
the sky is falling,
the sky is falling.
Oh my God.

1023
01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:48.840
Oh my God.
Don't,
don't bend your spine,
stay neutral.

1024
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:53.580
What everyone kind of missed the big elephant in the room was the pig was

1025
01:02:53.581 --> 01:02:57.900
fucking dead,
the tissue was dead.
It can't adapt.
It's dead.

1026
01:02:57.901 --> 01:02:58.920
It's no longer living.

1027
01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:04.190
And it wasn't exposed to very gradual loads so that there could be progressive

1028
01:03:05.071 --> 01:03:08.370
adaptation,
which is what our bodies are really good at.

1029
01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:10.410
So they kind of overlooked all that.

1030
01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:13.890
So if I take this completely unprepared tissue and I do this to it,
it'll break.

1031
01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:18.330
So some very interesting discussions right now on it.
I've obviously,

1032
01:03:18.331 --> 01:03:19.890
everyone's fine,
you know,
we've,

1033
01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:23.080
we've got athletes doing great adults who are doing wonderful and the,

1034
01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:26.640
the physical therapist will come around simply because it's healthy.

1035
01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:28.170
Now they've got to understand,

1036
01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:32.010
and other people who are listening should understand also is that our weighted

1037
01:03:32.011 --> 01:03:36.660
mobility work needs to be approached with a different mentality,

1038
01:03:36.661 --> 01:03:38.250
a different level of intensity.

1039
01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:43.520
Then conditioning work because connective tissue has one 10th the metabolic rate

1040
01:03:43.981 --> 01:03:47.730
of muscular tissue.
So it heals,
it heals slower to adapt sore.

1041
01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:52.770
So you have to kind of come to the table with a very patient attitude or,

1042
01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:54.750
or as I consider myself like I'm,

1043
01:03:54.751 --> 01:03:57.900
I'm extremely impatient naturally,

1044
01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:01.350
but I've learned order to get what I want and to go where I want to go.

1045
01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:06.380
I've had to learn to be patiently impatient and if I give into the urge,

1046
01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:10.530
then I get hurt.
Athletes get hurt,
we fall apart and we,
you know,

1047
01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:15.420
nationals or Olympic trials are every four years nationals or once a year and

1048
01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:18.120
you don't get another nationals,
you don't get another Olympic trials.

1049
01:04:18.121 --> 01:04:22.280
If you blow it,
you've got to be on point that day.
So it teaches us and our,

1050
01:04:22.281 --> 01:04:27.281
and our environment was actually a blessing because it's very much a practical,

1051
01:04:27.751 --> 01:04:32.610
it's very much results oriented there.
There's no room for opinion,
I think.

1052
01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:37.440
I feel,
I prefer it's,
it works.
If it doesn't work,

1053
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.330
it produces results.
It doesn't produce results.
You are the best in the country.

1054
01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:45.840
You aren't the best in the country.
I mean it's very clear.

1055
01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.790
It's very clear and it can't be argued with.

1056
01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:52.850
And now that was actually something when we segwayed into a kind of the fitness

1057
01:04:52.921 --> 01:04:53.940
world,
if you will,

1058
01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:57.960
where a you come out of national team and that and everyone knows who the studs

1059
01:04:57.961 --> 01:05:02.640
are.
In the fitness world though,
everyone's proclaiming their,
the stud,

1060
01:05:02.641 --> 01:05:05.600
everyone's proclaiming their,
the national champion and there's,

1061
01:05:05.601 --> 01:05:08.310
there's nothing to support it,
there's no results.
There's,

1062
01:05:08.311 --> 01:05:11.850
there's no great athletes,
there's no great abilities that have been generated.

1063
01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:13.900
There's just the marketing and that,

1064
01:05:13.901 --> 01:05:17.160
that was hard to wrap my head around cause a national team that doesn't exist

1065
01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:20.260
and you can't go to the Olympics and the guy who talks the loudest gets the

1066
01:05:20.261 --> 01:05:24.820
metal.
It didn't have the loudest voice.
I'm champion.

1067
01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:28.970
<v 4>I think that's national politics right now.
Oh wait,
no,
nevermind.
Different Times.</v>

1068
01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:29.923
Different pod.

1069
01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:33.730
I did want to ask you how your visits to the White House but I figured it will

1070
01:05:33.731 --> 01:05:37.600
save that one for another time.
Yeah.
Tim,

1071
01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:39.600
Tim went to the White House last week guy.
So I'll,

1072
01:05:39.601 --> 01:05:44.500
I'll pick his brain for you later.
Uh,
so I,
I interrupted.

1073
01:05:44.501 --> 01:05:48.790
But yeah,
you get to the fitness world.
And I mean another,

1074
01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:51.490
another one of the differences that you pointed out for me,
which I really liked,

1075
01:05:51.491 --> 01:05:55.270
was that in the fitness world it's,

1076
01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.190
it's exercise and diet,

1077
01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:01.570
whereas in your world it's always been eaten,
trained,
right?

1078
01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:03.250
<v 2>Shrank.
Yeah.</v>

1079
01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:07.510
He eat and train because if what the people are trying to do,

1080
01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:11.940
and we,
we,
and I'll throw a little,
a little blurb in here.
We,

1081
01:06:11.941 --> 01:06:16.030
we have an outstanding nutrition program.
Uh,

1082
01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:20.470
the guy who wrote it,
former seal team six,

1083
01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:22.990
when he started buds back in the day,

1084
01:06:22.991 --> 01:06:27.991
he was like one 41 45 and then Jeff got all the way up to two 20,

1085
01:06:29.981 --> 01:06:34.981
just shy of two 25 solid muscle in his waist was the same size as 20 was thin

1086
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:39.610
and he looked like two vikings,
two,
two shoulders on top of his bio.

1087
01:06:39.611 --> 01:06:42.460
He came walking out was like,
what the fuck?
It had been a couple of years.

1088
01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:46.540
What the Hell did you do?
And uh,
it's these,

1089
01:06:46.541 --> 01:06:49.750
it's these basic nutritional concepts that we teach.

1090
01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:54.670
But what we tried to do with the,
with adults is they're trying to,

1091
01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:59.650
they're trying to stay ahead of a bad diet through exercise or trying to outrun

1092
01:06:59.651 --> 01:07:03.340
a bad diet and it can't be done.
It can't be done.

1093
01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:07.150
And then what happens is if they somehow find this,

1094
01:07:07.151 --> 01:07:12.151
this crazy combination of a massive amounts of cardio and they can kind of keep

1095
01:07:15.221 --> 01:07:18.640
their weight in check a little bit and then they stopped that cardio,

1096
01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:22.060
they immediately start gaining weight,
weight gain,
weight loss,

1097
01:07:22.061 --> 01:07:25.600
all of that should be separate from your conditioning.
You know,

1098
01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:28.480
you've got to get your nutrition dialed in.
If your nutrition's dialed in,

1099
01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:32.200
your body's going to find its natural healthy weight that it's going to operate

1100
01:07:32.201 --> 01:07:33.370
at.
Now,
if you're,

1101
01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:36.940
if you want to be that giant muscle guy and that's not your phenotype,

1102
01:07:36.941 --> 01:07:40.030
which is your body type,
you know what?
It's tough shit.
Deal with it.

1103
01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:43.480
You know it's not going to change.
You're not going to change your phenotype.

1104
01:07:43.481 --> 01:07:48.190
You're not going to change your body's genetic expression game.
That being said,

1105
01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:53.050
right,
you can maximize what you,
what's your potential as well?

1106
01:07:53.051 --> 01:07:56.530
We hammer through door students as you're not responsible for the hand of cards

1107
01:07:56.531 --> 01:08:01.190
you were dealt,
you're responsible for maxing out what you were given.
No.

1108
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:04.420
So who knows what your strengths will be.
Maybe you'll be more endurance.

1109
01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:08.260
Maybe you're going to carry easy muscle mass.
Maybe you're a Max Strength Guy,

1110
01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:12.220
maybe you're very skill oriented.
It doesn't matter.
Maybe you're very explosive,

1111
01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.860
but whatever it is,
you know,
make the most it.
So

1112
01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:20.930
<v 3>on that point,
uh,
and then I want to come back to,
uh,</v>

1113
01:08:20.931 --> 01:08:24.110
I want to ask you about,
I think it's,
I wrote this down during our assessment,

1114
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:28.310
Tony Fay quote,
no routines and quote.
That's all I wrote down.

1115
01:08:28.311 --> 01:08:32.150
So that's a cue for a story,
I believe that you told me that we'll come back to,

1116
01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:35.450
does that make any sense or is that just like a cryptic 3:00 AM note that I

1117
01:08:35.451 --> 01:08:37.310
wrote to myself?
I don't know,
but,
uh,

1118
01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:41.750
the guys stay away from the wine did and never,
never,

1119
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:46.890
uh,
in Vino Veritas we'll get back to that.
But the,
uh,
the,
Oh,
I know.

1120
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:51.140
I kind of know what it is.
I think,
I think I can actually queue it up.

1121
01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:54.550
The basics.
Uh,
yeah,
we're going to come back to that one second.

1122
01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:58.910
The question I wanted to ask first is one that came up a lot from listeners of

1123
01:08:58.911 --> 01:09:00.080
this podcast,
which was,

1124
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:05.450
and I'm going to create sort of a a composite of these questions,

1125
01:09:05.451 --> 01:09:07.910
but like if,
if someone is 35 years old,

1126
01:09:07.911 --> 01:09:12.320
let's just say former athlete does basic gym work,

1127
01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:15.810
diet is okay,
not terrible.
Uh,

1128
01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:20.090
they feel reasonably athletic but they're not competing in anything.

1129
01:09:20.091 --> 01:09:24.560
Certainly should have never done any gymnastics.
What would,

1130
01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:30.220
what would good goals be for such a person and what would bad goals be baby at

1131
01:09:31.701 --> 01:09:34.370
the same time?
Well,
I'm bat without question.

1132
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:39.430
Bad goal would be for them to jump right into a kind of full body weight,

1133
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.830
a straight arm strength.
For example,
a back lever,

1134
01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:46.430
which doesn't require a ton of strength,

1135
01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:49.550
but they love to do it because it looks so cool.

1136
01:09:49.551 --> 01:09:52.550
It's kind of like their first thing they can do that,
you know,
wow,
look at me.

1137
01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:54.170
The problem is,

1138
01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:59.320
is that it puts them in extreme load while in shoulder extension.

1139
01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:04.250
So let me,
can I paint a picture for people?
So back lever just to,

1140
01:10:04.251 --> 01:10:07.690
just to create the image and coach carpet from wrong.

1141
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:12.650
Imagine you're laying on your stomach,
on the floor,
arms by your sides,

1142
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:18.770
and then you turn your hands palm down so that your thumbs are pointing out away

1143
01:10:18.771 --> 01:10:19.604
from your body.

1144
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:24.410
And then you lift your arms off the ground as high as possible with your arms

1145
01:10:24.411 --> 01:10:28.760
straight and then place a bar in your hands and then lift your body off the

1146
01:10:28.761 --> 01:10:31.130
ground off the ground and kind of hold yourself there.

1147
01:10:31.450 --> 01:10:34.120
That'll they're holding somebody would be horizontal.
Yup.

1148
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:39.470
And what they don't realize is that when the shoulders are in shoulder extension

1149
01:10:39.471 --> 01:10:44.270
like that is that the biceps are under maximum stretch.
So it's nothing,

1150
01:10:44.271 --> 01:10:48.740
it's not a problem to do with being strong enough on the bicep is,
is to loading.

1151
01:10:48.741 --> 01:10:53.660
They're going to tear a bicep.
So we,
for a young adult now,
not a problem at all.

1152
01:10:53.661 --> 01:10:58.250
And,
uh,
we went through,
you know,
we,
we get some,
uh,
and we're,
we're lucky now.

1153
01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:01.760
We have a lot of people who use our material but some of us,

1154
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:05.710
some of our material and I'll coach you're,
you're too conservative coach.
It's,

1155
01:11:05.711 --> 01:11:08.690
it's a new world coach.
We don't have time.

1156
01:11:08.691 --> 01:11:12.860
I had someone who was 21 or 23 ones.
Coach,
I don't have time to take my,

1157
01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:14.160
I'm already 23.

1158
01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:18.690
<v 2>Okay.
All right.
I,
I think you're misreading this.</v>

1159
01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:22.470
But they want to jump right into their strength training and they do well but

1160
01:11:22.471 --> 01:11:25.260
they don't do the mobility work.
So it wasn't last year.

1161
01:11:25.261 --> 01:11:28.410
I think it was a year before.
I think maybe the street work out community,

1162
01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:33.310
five of their top guys around the world snapped biceps and the,

1163
01:11:33.311 --> 01:11:36.330
these are crazy strong guys,
right?
I mean we've seen them.
These guys are beasts.

1164
01:11:36.331 --> 01:11:38.910
They're doing one arm chins are doing this and that and they,

1165
01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:43.290
and they all snapped him on back labor stuff cause they're,
the mobility wasn't,

1166
01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:44.460
was an inline.

1167
01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:48.900
Now we all know when you're young you can get away with a lot of stupid shit.

1168
01:11:49.190 --> 01:11:53.220
Cause the body heals so fast,
you know,
he luckily right are,

1169
01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:57.450
I certainly wouldn't have survived being 21 if it wasn't that the case,

1170
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:59.850
but as an adult,
all right,

1171
01:12:00.810 --> 01:12:03.600
the structure is mature now and I think,

1172
01:12:03.630 --> 01:12:08.220
I think maybe a better way to look at it is people think I'm getting older,

1173
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.270
ligaments are breaking down,
tendons are breaking down,

1174
01:12:12.271 --> 01:12:13.530
joints are getting brittle,

1175
01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:17.790
and actually that's not the case because if we go back in time when you were a

1176
01:12:17.791 --> 01:12:20.550
little guy,
when I was a little guy,
when all listeners were a little guy,

1177
01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:23.790
we ran around like mad men,
right?
It wasn't,

1178
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:27.960
oh today I'm going to ride my bike three miles it was sun was up,

1179
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:31.980
go jump on my bike and I'm gone all day and I'm running and jumping and climbing

1180
01:12:32.050 --> 01:12:35.910
and we're just,
we're just being crazy little guys.
Then we had,

1181
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:39.690
so we had this huge matrix of activity that the body is used to.

1182
01:12:40.410 --> 01:12:44.370
Then we hit high school and for most people that's our first exposure to

1183
01:12:44.371 --> 01:12:48.000
structured athletic training.
Okay.
And the body does well with it.

1184
01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:53.420
Now the mistake is thinking that the body did well solely because of that

1185
01:12:53.761 --> 01:12:58.410
structured athletic training.
What they're overlooking is all that activity,

1186
01:12:58.411 --> 01:13:02.160
that matrix of activity that occurred for those years prior to that.

1187
01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:06.330
Then if they're a high enough level athlete,
structured training,

1188
01:13:06.331 --> 01:13:10.440
my continue into college,
graduate time to get a job.

1189
01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:14.240
All right,
I'm still,
you know,
I'm young,
right?
Hormones are pumping.

1190
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:17.130
I'm going to go to work and then I'm going to go play basketball with the guys

1191
01:13:17.131 --> 01:13:19.140
in the unions are going to hit the gym,
this and that.

1192
01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:23.400
That goes good for a couple of years.
Right?
I'm getting vibe,
having fun.
Weekends,

1193
01:13:23.401 --> 01:13:28.200
weekends are full.
Then you meet the Qt,
right?
You meet the love of your life.

1194
01:13:28.450 --> 01:13:32.500
You get married suddenly.
I can't go play basketball every night now.
Okay,

1195
01:13:32.501 --> 01:13:34.440
so we do this and that and a little at a time.

1196
01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:38.670
Our levels of physical activity outside of conditioning,

1197
01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:43.260
her dropping down and they're dropping down a lot.
Then kids come,
right.

1198
01:13:43.261 --> 01:13:47.070
Well there is another huge chunk of time gone.
Then before you know it,

1199
01:13:47.071 --> 01:13:51.750
you're 30 you're 35 you haven't been doing hitting the gym very often.

1200
01:13:51.930 --> 01:13:56.930
There's certainly no time for just playful activity or doing sports or this or

1201
01:13:57.061 --> 01:13:59.760
that on a regular basis for most people,
right?

1202
01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:04.760
And they spend most of the time hunched over that desk and now the body wants to

1203
01:14:05.281 --> 01:14:08.520
be healthy.
It wants to be healthy.
That's the you're,
you're a prime example.

1204
01:14:08.521 --> 01:14:08.831
We get,

1205
01:14:08.831 --> 01:14:13.831
we feed it the right movements in the dosages and it blooms and blossoms is like

1206
01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:17.500
weeding and watering the garden,
right?
The body wants to be healthy,

1207
01:14:17.710 --> 01:14:20.860
but we have to do it in the right dosage.
And so for example,

1208
01:14:20.861 --> 01:14:24.220
those street worker guys,
they hurt themselves because it was the wrong dosage.

1209
01:14:24.221 --> 01:14:27.610
They want it to go too hard too soon without the mobility.

1210
01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:32.770
So for an adult to come back around answering that question along way 35 year

1211
01:14:32.771 --> 01:14:37.730
old,
very first thing we gotta do,
we've got to fix joints.
We,

1212
01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:41.020
we've,
we've got to repair joints.
We've got to get that range of motion back.

1213
01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:44.440
If you were to look at all of the adults that you've dealt with,

1214
01:14:44.441 --> 01:14:49.120
let's just say 35 year olds are then if you had to pick,

1215
01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:51.700
and of course this does not cover all the bases,

1216
01:14:51.701 --> 01:14:56.701
but if you had to pick say three to five movements or exercises or stretches for

1217
01:14:58.750 --> 01:15:03.520
addressing the most common deficiencies,
like getting this joints back into play,

1218
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:07.750
what would you,
what would some of your selections,
so just just for joint joint,

1219
01:15:07.751 --> 01:15:08.080
I think,

1220
01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:13.080
I think we'd put Jefferson Curl at top of the list is Jefferson crawls and began

1221
01:15:13.230 --> 01:15:15.160
to let us,
it's gonna cause remember we have,

1222
01:15:15.190 --> 01:15:18.760
we have multiple sections of the spine,
right?
We've got the cervical,

1223
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:22.570
thoracic and lumbar.
That's going to come through also into glutes.

1224
01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:25.690
That's going to go down into our hamstrings.
That's going to hit our calves.

1225
01:15:25.691 --> 01:15:28.930
It's going to hit our Achilles as well.
So far for one,

1226
01:15:28.931 --> 01:15:32.020
that's a lot of bang for your buck,
for one exercise.

1227
01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:37.090
Even if that was all you did,
Ryan and you just did Jefferson crow,

1228
01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:42.040
a lot of aches and pains are going to go away because of that.
Uh,

1229
01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:47.320
next fund west tough.
It's always,
it's always hard to boil it down,

1230
01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:51.820
boil it down.
We took care of Pike,
we've got,
we've got to get extension,

1231
01:15:51.821 --> 01:15:54.300
we've got to get some thoracic extension.
I,

1232
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:58.330
I'd throw elevated bridge in there if arm strength was sufficient to handle it.

1233
01:15:58.930 --> 01:16:01.520
If,
if not,
we can scale it down to a,

1234
01:16:01.630 --> 01:16:04.900
some weighted work with some bars or some,
some barbells,

1235
01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:07.730
either some Dow with a plate.
Uh,

1236
01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:11.470
we've got to get shoulder extension in there because what happens a lot,

1237
01:16:11.471 --> 01:16:15.070
a lot of the conditioning we're exposed to is all front delt,
heavy.

1238
01:16:16.230 --> 01:16:20.440
Right?
Right.
It's all,
it's all anterior delp and the pecks get tight.

1239
01:16:20.441 --> 01:16:24.320
The interior delts are getting tight and we start pulling our own shoulders for

1240
01:16:24.321 --> 01:16:28.120
it.
We create our own impingement,
you know,
and it doesn't matter.
You know,

1241
01:16:28.121 --> 01:16:31.320
so I'll do more exercises,
I'll do more exercises.
We'll know you're,

1242
01:16:31.321 --> 01:16:32.620
you're just making it worse.

1243
01:16:32.621 --> 01:16:36.370
What the problem is is there is not balanced in the shoulder joint,
right?

1244
01:16:36.371 --> 01:16:36.760
There's no,

1245
01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.150
there's no retraction and it's easy to tell what is their posture look like?

1246
01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:43.000
What,
what do we see with everyone now?
We've got that,

1247
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:45.130
what are they even have a term now?
Texting neck.

1248
01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:51.890
Is that just a kind of that that turtle forward distended forwards,

1249
01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:57.080
the Wally power down look and you know the scary thing there.

1250
01:16:57.341 --> 01:17:00.490
And again we have some pts who use our stuff around the world,

1251
01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:05.140
a lot of success and they're the ones who come in and educate us for,
we'll say,

1252
01:17:05.141 --> 01:17:07.300
you know,
we've noticed this and they can,
they tell us,

1253
01:17:07.330 --> 01:17:11.690
they teach us well to the limit can right because we're not professionals but to

1254
01:17:11.691 --> 01:17:15.080
the limits weekend they started teaching us the mechanics of what is really

1255
01:17:15.081 --> 01:17:19.730
going on.
So we have a very good student,
uh,
Wesley 10 runs,

1256
01:17:19.731 --> 01:17:24.200
one of our affiliates,
he's a fulltime osteopath in the UK,

1257
01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:29.410
runs another one of our GB affiliates forma GST and a Wesley's the one who

1258
01:17:30.261 --> 01:17:32.630
taught me that,
you know,
there,

1259
01:17:32.631 --> 01:17:37.490
there's a point coach or if you abuse the body it's not going to come back.

1260
01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:39.650
And so for example,

1261
01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:44.300
you see some older adults who are extremely hunched forward,
neck,
distended,

1262
01:17:44.301 --> 01:17:44.841
forward,

1263
01:17:44.841 --> 01:17:48.950
Chin up cause they're trying to see where they're going and it's not that they

1264
01:17:48.951 --> 01:17:51.290
have bad posture and they could fix it,

1265
01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:56.320
it's that they can't fix it because the vertebrae are or rectangle.

1266
01:17:57.110 --> 01:18:00.530
And if you spend after spending years of hunched forward like that,

1267
01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:04.970
it compresses the front edges of that rectangle until it becomes a trap as oid.

1268
01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:09.620
Right.
And that doesn't come back once.
Once that happens,
it's done,

1269
01:18:09.621 --> 01:18:13.880
it's over,
it's done.
Same thing happens with the muscle bellies.

1270
01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:18.440
So people who get frozen shoulder impingements and this that is,

1271
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:20.180
if you're not using the muscle belly,

1272
01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:24.620
the body doesn't want to support it because muscle tissues expensive and buy

1273
01:18:24.621 --> 01:18:28.790
expensive.
The body looks at it,
it's expensive to feed is expensive to maintain.

1274
01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:32.690
So you can't your for example,
your body isn't a painting.

1275
01:18:32.690 --> 01:18:36.740
You can't get to a certain degree of muscle mass mobility,

1276
01:18:36.741 --> 01:18:38.330
athletic ability,
endurance,

1277
01:18:38.331 --> 01:18:43.331
whatever you want to say and then just stop and have it continue me to exist

1278
01:18:43.701 --> 01:18:45.960
like a painting you did right.
The,

1279
01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:49.280
it has to be maintained because if you're not using it,

1280
01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:53.450
it costs too much resources for the body to continue to keep it.

1281
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:57.680
So it's going to start breaking it down.
And that's why you get a few days right.

1282
01:18:58.010 --> 01:19:01.040
And then you start losing strength and you start losing mobility.

1283
01:19:01.041 --> 01:19:03.230
You start losing when,
uh,

1284
01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:07.400
easiest physical attribute to build endurance.

1285
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.480
Simple,
super simple.
Endurance is what endurance is.

1286
01:19:11.481 --> 01:19:15.530
Simply strength repeated over and over at a lower load.
No big deal.
That's,

1287
01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:19.160
that's a six to an eight week process.
Simple.
No problems at all.

1288
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:24.680
Mobility is going to take some time.
What's,
what's the easiest one to fix?

1289
01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:29.780
Muscular strength.
Okay.
Nope,
no problem at all.
So for,

1290
01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:31.780
it's super important then that we,

1291
01:19:31.781 --> 01:19:34.670
we use that muscle mass cause if it's not being used,

1292
01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:37.460
you're not only gonna lose the size of the muscle mass,

1293
01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:41.560
the body's going to start doing deposits of college and on it and it's going to

1294
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:44.490
start shrinking that muscle belly on the traps.
For example,

1295
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:48.410
going back to those older adults we discussed and it's gonna,

1296
01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:52.850
it's gonna Shrink until a lot of it is connective tissue.
On the edges.

1297
01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:55.700
Now what people need to realize,
and they don't,

1298
01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:59.860
is that when they see an adult who's hurting,
right?
They're older,

1299
01:19:59.890 --> 01:20:03.500
they're shuffling,
they can't pick their knees up,
their hips are frozen,

1300
01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:08.040
they're hunched over,
their next displaced they,
that way when

1301
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:08.873
<v 4>they were younger,</v>

1302
01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:14.840
this is all the result of inactivity and poor progressions in their exercises

1303
01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:18.990
and it didn't have to be.
And then they need to date.

1304
01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:23.770
<v 2>Next step of connecting is that if it happened to that guy or that woman,</v>

1305
01:20:24.370 --> 01:20:28.450
it can sure as hell happened to me also if I go down the same road that they

1306
01:20:28.451 --> 01:20:29.284
went down.

1307
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:34.510
<v 4>So returning to the shoulder extension because I noticed in our assessment that</v>

1308
01:20:34.671 --> 01:20:38.510
I had terrible shoulder extension and I had kind of accepted it and written it

1309
01:20:38.511 --> 01:20:41.900
off with stupid reasons.
Like,
well,
you know,
I've done too much dead lifting,

1310
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:45.570
add too much huge slabs of muscle in my back.
I can't do shoulder extension.

1311
01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:50.960
Total Horse Shit.
I mean,
especially notices must those huge,

1312
01:20:50.961 --> 01:20:55.350
massive slabs of muscle,
the imaginary lats syndrome that I have.
And,

1313
01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:58.520
uh,
I mean that was just blown to smithereens when I met.
Uh,

1314
01:20:58.610 --> 01:21:03.350
let me make sure I get his name correct as Paul Watson,
is that right?
Oh yeah.

1315
01:21:03.351 --> 01:21:07.610
Big Deal in New York City who's gigantic and extremely flexible.

1316
01:21:07.611 --> 01:21:09.290
So as soon as I hung out with him I was like,
okay,

1317
01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:15.470
can let people know Paul is why we say six feet to 30.
I mean,

1318
01:21:15.471 --> 01:21:17.870
and just in four,
he's about 40,

1319
01:21:17.871 --> 01:21:22.060
I want to say and just probably walked around at 6% body fat and can do,

1320
01:21:22.490 --> 01:21:26.630
you can do a flat chest to ground pancake.
No problem.

1321
01:21:26.631 --> 01:21:31.580
Can Do dislocates with a weighted dowel or a barbell.
No problem.

1322
01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:33.230
It with all different types of grips,

1323
01:21:33.231 --> 01:21:37.340
which I can't do at all even though I'm making progress.
Uh,
the,

1324
01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:41.660
the shoulder extension,
what is your preferred way to work on shoulder extension?

1325
01:21:41.661 --> 01:21:46.250
What does,
is it the sitting down arms behind you scooting the hips forward?

1326
01:21:46.251 --> 01:21:50.240
Is there something else that you would add to that mix?
We

1327
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.400
<v 2>hafting sneak up on now on a little bit.</v>

1328
01:21:54.730 --> 01:21:59.320
So sometimes we can't even work shoulder extension at first if the elbows are

1329
01:21:59.321 --> 01:22:03.940
deconditioned.
So if Brachialis just inside the elbow is weak,

1330
01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:07.180
if the insertion of the bicep tendon is weak,

1331
01:22:07.181 --> 01:22:10.720
then when the arm is extended as they stretch,
there might be some discomfort.

1332
01:22:11.170 --> 01:22:14.710
So if that's the case,
we have to give that time to adapt.

1333
01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:17.290
So he noticed that's one of the questions that I ask is your,
how has your break,

1334
01:22:17.291 --> 01:22:19.570
how's it feel?
How's your bicep feel?
How's your elbow feel?

1335
01:22:19.930 --> 01:22:24.460
Cause we never push through pain.
I mean,
you can,
you can,

1336
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:28.360
but that's,
have you noticed that um,

1337
01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:31.030
the guys who push through pain,
right?

1338
01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:36.060
They've got a shelf life of somewhere between two and four years and then the

1339
01:22:36.521 --> 01:22:41.521
body is so beat up and so painful and so chronically injured that it's just

1340
01:22:41.801 --> 01:22:46.801
easier to be a fat slob sitting on the couch and had at least my pain drop than

1341
01:22:47.381 --> 01:22:51.600
to try to continue pushing through and being a stud.
I,
it's,

1342
01:22:51.601 --> 01:22:55.960
it's so common and it's also unnecessary.
Uh,
for example,

1343
01:22:55.961 --> 01:22:58.450
and I don't get this one,
I don't get this one a lot.

1344
01:22:58.750 --> 01:23:01.480
I'll bring it cause where there's a lot of people,
and don't get me wrong,

1345
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:06.070
I really like weightlifting.
I think the Olympic lifting is uh,

1346
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:07.660
there's a lot going for it.

1347
01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:13.140
I think the way that it is approached here in the states is not as efficient as

1348
01:23:13.571 --> 01:23:16.540
it's approached in China for example,
or in Russia.

1349
01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:21.940
So for example in both of them before there's any weight at at,
at all,

1350
01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:25.870
they they build complete mobility throughout the body.

1351
01:23:25.871 --> 01:23:29.740
They can straddle their legs,
chest on the floor,
sit with legs together,
Pike,

1352
01:23:29.770 --> 01:23:33.010
they've got bridge,
they have all these basic mobility,

1353
01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:35.910
ankle flexibility and mobility.

1354
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:40.810
We talked about this as it related to huge and especially exactly you watch

1355
01:23:40.811 --> 01:23:44.870
cloak off to be every logo and work should watch this guy.
She got some videos.

1356
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:47.200
God,
he is such a beast.

1357
01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:50.950
But what they also need to do is not just watch the weight he's putting up,

1358
01:23:50.951 --> 01:23:51.550
right?

1359
01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:56.080
They need to watch his warmup in the training hall and look at how amazingly

1360
01:23:56.081 --> 01:23:57.790
flexible and mobile he is.

1361
01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:02.410
Now what's important to understand is that a world class level,
right?

1362
01:24:02.411 --> 01:24:05.710
At a world class level,
resources are limited.

1363
01:24:06.010 --> 01:24:08.080
Energy you have for training is limited.

1364
01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:10.540
The amount of time you have for training is limited.

1365
01:24:10.541 --> 01:24:13.570
The amount of time you have for recovery is limited,
right?

1366
01:24:13.571 --> 01:24:16.120
You have to maximize these things cause you're going,

1367
01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:18.640
it's one thing to be the best stud in the town.

1368
01:24:19.150 --> 01:24:22.300
It's another thing to be best stud in the state.
Now the one in region,

1369
01:24:22.301 --> 01:24:23.320
number one in the country,

1370
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:28.420
completely different animal to be the best in the entire world,

1371
01:24:28.421 --> 01:24:30.310
to be the best at what you do.

1372
01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:35.460
How to billions of people were talking slivers of difference between the very

1373
01:24:35.681 --> 01:24:40.270
top guys.
So with all those restrictions and all those parameters in place,

1374
01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:45.720
if the best in the world are stretching their ass off in order to get strong,

1375
01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:51.430
why aren't you
agreed and not you,

1376
01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:54.990
not you personally put me on the spot,
coach?
No.

1377
01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:58.750
Now you as an all of us as an all of us,
right?

1378
01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:02.830
And what'll happen is the people just kind of get blinders on.

1379
01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:05.080
They want to watch the technical,
they want to watch progressions,

1380
01:25:05.081 --> 01:25:06.310
what do you do for this and that.

1381
01:25:06.490 --> 01:25:10.420
And then they'll blow off the mobility work that they do early.

1382
01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:15.660
Not realizing that the mobility work was the gold nugget they were looking for.

1383
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:19.630
They just didn't brush the dirt off in order to see that it was gold underneath.

1384
01:25:19.631 --> 01:25:21.640
They just thought,
oh it's just another rock.
Who Cares?

1385
01:25:21.641 --> 01:25:26.020
No it was the gold that was the suite and they missed it.
So if we're looking at,

1386
01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:27.641
again this,

1387
01:25:27.641 --> 01:25:32.641
this 35 year old former athlete maybe never was super competitive but he has

1388
01:25:32.951 --> 01:25:34.930
kept in decent shape,

1389
01:25:34.931 --> 01:25:39.580
maybe does some form of exercise two or three times a week in terms of a

1390
01:25:39.610 --> 01:25:44.170
understanding that the mobility and working with Jay Curl,
elevator,
bridge,

1391
01:25:44.171 --> 01:25:45.820
shoulder,
et Cetera,
et Cetera is going to be,

1392
01:25:46.090 --> 01:25:48.100
those are going to be ingredients in the recipe,

1393
01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:50.800
in their possession to gymnast of some type.

1394
01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:54.400
What would be not not,
not even gymnast.

1395
01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:58.810
I would say a little human being functional human being.
Right.

1396
01:25:58.811 --> 01:26:03.040
Cause if you don't cause I'm,
we don't train,
I'd like to point out people,

1397
01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:04.310
we don't train

1398
01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:09.020
<v 3>gymnast,
we do gymnastic strength training.
Right.
But there,
I don't have,</v>

1399
01:26:09.021 --> 01:26:12.050
I just got off the phone with our Olympic coast today,
Kevin Magicka.
Right.

1400
01:26:12.051 --> 01:26:15.440
We had a great conversation,
but guys,
regardless of how good you are,

1401
01:26:15.441 --> 01:26:17.420
a rope climbs and plans and this and that.

1402
01:26:17.690 --> 01:26:20.630
I wouldn't hold my breath that Kevin's getting ready to give you a call and say

1403
01:26:20.631 --> 01:26:23.580
please come and be on our team this year.
And I saw,

1404
01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:26.180
I saw your rope climbs and you are kick ass.

1405
01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:29.690
You are the one for us where we got a uniform waiting here for you.

1406
01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:32.720
We're a department for Rio in July,
man,
be ready.

1407
01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:37.520
Pack your bag is not going to happen guys.
So I think that's correct.

1408
01:26:37.521 --> 01:26:41.270
You know,
athletes,
functional human being covers it all.

1409
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:46.250
So let me,
let me just jump to the uh,
the punchline question,

1410
01:26:46.251 --> 01:26:49.940
which is let's say we look at a,

1411
01:26:49.941 --> 01:26:53.690
if I wanted to give someone a stretch goal to inspire them to train
consistently,

1412
01:26:53.691 --> 01:26:58.100
right?
So the mobility might not be enough,
but if I wanted it to give them a,
a,

1413
01:26:58.101 --> 01:26:59.840
a light at the end of the tunnel.
So I'm like,

1414
01:26:59.841 --> 01:27:03.890
I know this shoulder extension stuff is going to be very unpleasant.

1415
01:27:03.891 --> 01:27:07.100
Maybe not super exciting,
but this is the objective.

1416
01:27:07.101 --> 01:27:11.090
This is why this is what you might be able to do in three,
six,
nine,

1417
01:27:11.091 --> 01:27:13.060
12 months from now.
Right.
The,

1418
01:27:13.090 --> 01:27:18.090
the back liver we've talked about is not necessarily a good goal because you

1419
01:27:18.981 --> 01:27:21.360
might think you have the strength and perhaps you do,
but you don't want them.

1420
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:24.220
They'll definitely have this strike calls almost without question,
right?

1421
01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:28.490
But they don't have the mobility.
So snap goes the BICEP,

1422
01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:31.250
nasty surprise waiting in that box.

1423
01:27:31.370 --> 01:27:36.370
What would be a good gymnastic strength training goal to have?

1424
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:43.270
Uh,
or goals and as just as context for people who are wondering,
you know,

1425
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:47.990
the after trying to do my best to survey the landscape and figure out what might

1426
01:27:47.991 --> 01:27:52.730
not be the stupidest goals I wanted to,
you know,
nothing is as the best goals,

1427
01:27:52.731 --> 01:27:56.300
but I decided,
okay,
well press strict press handstand,

1428
01:27:56.330 --> 01:27:58.880
which we can define in a second seems like a good one.

1429
01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:00.590
And it just seems like a sweet thing to be able to do.

1430
01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:04.700
And then front lever and then lever straddle.

1431
01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:08.900
Planche then straddle planche.
Exactly.
So,
uh,
we,
we can,

1432
01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:12.290
we can talk about what each of those are.
But would it,
would the press handstand,

1433
01:28:12.291 --> 01:28:12.711
for instance,

1434
01:28:12.711 --> 01:28:16.970
be something that incorporates the strength of the mobility and all these
pieces?

1435
01:28:16.971 --> 01:28:20.180
If you had to pick one,
you had to pick one.
That would be the one,

1436
01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:22.940
that'd be the one.
Okay.
So let's,
do you want your line,
cause it's,
it's gonna,

1437
01:28:22.970 --> 01:28:27.710
it's gonna have all strength,
all mobility,
balance,
agility,

1438
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:32.360
everything rolled into one movement.
How do you want to take a stab at,
uh,

1439
01:28:32.450 --> 01:28:34.910
at describing what that looks?
What does it,
what does a,

1440
01:28:35.210 --> 01:28:39.590
what does a perfect press handstand look like in your perfect press handstand?

1441
01:28:39.970 --> 01:28:43.580
So I'm just trying to keep it simple,
right?
Ben Dover,

1442
01:28:43.970 --> 01:28:47.960
hands on the ground by your toes and they can be put your palms on the floor so

1443
01:28:47.961 --> 01:28:52.160
they're just in front of your toes.
Shoulder width,
leg,
straight leg straight.

1444
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:56.240
And now if they needed to,
Ben,
we could what we're talking about perfect world,

1445
01:28:56.241 --> 01:28:59.360
right?
And then so hands on the floor,

1446
01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:03.480
shoulders directly over the hands.
And then no jumping,

1447
01:29:03.810 --> 01:29:08.240
using just the middle back,
just the traps because every,
everyone thinks traps,

1448
01:29:08.241 --> 01:29:13.230
traps,
traps,
anything traps just for shrugging.
While your traps are huge muscle,

1449
01:29:13.290 --> 01:29:14.041
very huge muscle.

1450
01:29:14.041 --> 01:29:16.530
And they don't just lie in the top of your shoulders or in the middle of your

1451
01:29:16.531 --> 01:29:21.480
back and down towards your lower back as well are giant muscle and they're

1452
01:29:21.481 --> 01:29:25.980
capable of a huge amount of power.
And when you fix those,
right,

1453
01:29:26.010 --> 01:29:29.580
a lot of shoulder pain goes away.
A lot of lower back pain goes away.

1454
01:29:29.970 --> 01:29:34.260
But to go back to our other hands on the floor,
shoulders over the hands,

1455
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:38.730
using that middle back,
those traps,
pull the hips up on top of the shoulder,

1456
01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:40.980
maintain that flat back position.

1457
01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:45.600
Then we continue on with lower back finishing the legs up to the handstand.

1458
01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:51.340
And so a couple of things that make this particularly challenging.
Uh,

1459
01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:52.471
so one,

1460
01:29:52.471 --> 01:29:56.430
obviously you need to have the flexibility in the hamstrings and everyone,

1461
01:29:56.440 --> 01:30:00.570
the mobility,
the mobility,
you have to have the compression strength.

1462
01:30:00.630 --> 01:30:04.340
Like we were talking about doing those,
those murderous,
uh,

1463
01:30:04.350 --> 01:30:08.940
embarrassing pike pulses,
which look like they should be easy.
And they are not,

1464
01:30:09.410 --> 01:30:10.020
uh,
you know,

1465
01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:15.020
bringing your legs basically to your chest in that lasts like 10 to 12 inch

1466
01:30:15.211 --> 01:30:19.350
range,
really challenging.
Um,
and then the,

1467
01:30:19.351 --> 01:30:22.740
I think where you see a lot of people online do this incorrectly,

1468
01:30:22.741 --> 01:30:27.741
at least from the standpoint of having the objective of gymnastic strength

1469
01:30:27.991 --> 01:30:28.570
training,
right?

1470
01:30:28.570 --> 01:30:31.340
There are all sorts of ways you can cheat with this stuff to make it

1471
01:30:31.341 --> 01:30:36.150
biomechanical easier.
But if we're trying to do it strictly,
uh,
can be in why,

1472
01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:39.630
why do it?
And maybe this is a nice thing to throw in because people say,
well,

1473
01:30:39.690 --> 01:30:44.070
it's just a matter.
It's personal tastes coach.
It's personal taste.
You,

1474
01:30:44.071 --> 01:30:46.410
you do it this way because you prefer this form.

1475
01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:51.300
Now we do it a particular way because this is what builds the most strength

1476
01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:54.780
that's transferable to other activities.
For example,

1477
01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:58.530
Nessel I'll continue.
So who are,
who have all by pissed off so far?

1478
01:30:58.531 --> 01:31:02.040
Dad pissed off crossfitters.
I don't know how I'm going to

1479
01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:08.310
piss off yoga right now.
So I once had,
and I like Yoga,
don't get me wrong,

1480
01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:10.860
but they're,
their approach to handstand is flawed.

1481
01:31:11.250 --> 01:31:13.890
They want a to go bone on bone,

1482
01:31:14.370 --> 01:31:19.110
so they want to have their shoulders a depressed,
so they're bone on bone.

1483
01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:24.240
They want to have pipe shoulders.
So shoulder shoulders can elevate.

1484
01:31:24.241 --> 01:31:27.330
So if I'm,
if I'm standing up right and I elevate my shoulders,

1485
01:31:27.331 --> 01:31:32.130
that would be like me shrugging my shoulders to my ear and then doing the

1486
01:31:32.131 --> 01:31:36.930
opposite as the other direction.
While when we do a handstand,
it's,

1487
01:31:36.990 --> 01:31:39.360
and if I describe it this way,
it's gonna make sense,
right?

1488
01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:44.610
I want muscle and connective tissue to be doing the work.

1489
01:31:44.611 --> 01:31:48.870
I don't want bone grinding on bone.
That's,
that's not a recipe for longevity.

1490
01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:53.010
It's not going to work.
Okay?
But the easy one is as they'll say,
well,
there's,

1491
01:31:53.011 --> 01:31:55.940
there's a yoga handstand and there's a gymnastics handstand,

1492
01:31:56.170 --> 01:31:58.500
and my answer that as well,
you're almost right.

1493
01:31:58.530 --> 01:32:02.710
There's a handstand and there's a fucked up gymnastics,
handstand,
low.

1494
01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:05.470
Those are the only two there are in here.

1495
01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:10.210
Here's how we evaluated a gymnastics handstand,
right?
Done with Nice,

1496
01:32:10.211 --> 01:32:14.080
flat back,
Nice.
And all,
all being a smart ass aside,
right?

1497
01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:18.100
We're going to look at it just from a purely practical viewpoint which one leads

1498
01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:19.293
somewhere,

1499
01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:23.410
so if I do a yoga type pants and what that arch and the flex shoulders,

1500
01:32:24.210 --> 01:32:26.890
I'm not going any farther and that I can work on duration.

1501
01:32:26.891 --> 01:32:29.110
I can do some other things but I'm not going any further.

1502
01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:34.720
I do the gymnastics hand sand where it's flat now I have nice range of motion in

1503
01:32:34.751 --> 01:32:38.790
the shoulders.
I have strength through the middle,
back through the traps her I'd,

1504
01:32:38.791 --> 01:32:40.150
I've got good core strength.

1505
01:32:40.151 --> 01:32:43.810
I've got good compression strength now I can move on to good press,

1506
01:32:43.811 --> 01:32:48.340
handstand work.
Why?
What?
We want to get stronger.
That in turn allows me to go on.

1507
01:32:48.341 --> 01:32:49.900
If I'm in a mood and I want to do more,

1508
01:32:49.901 --> 01:32:54.340
I can go into more advanced one arm handstand were pure wedding work.
All,

1509
01:32:54.490 --> 01:32:59.490
all those things are all results of a proper nice straight line handstand that

1510
01:33:02.081 --> 01:33:06.730
you can't do with.
The flawed approach is is it's not aesthetics.

1511
01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:11.020
It's being practical because we don't do anything in gymnastics.
Right?

1512
01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:15.010
That's just purely aesthetics.
Why?
Why do we do things a certain way?

1513
01:33:15.011 --> 01:33:19.500
It lets us generate more power.
Why do we want more power?
Let's us get more air,

1514
01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:24.040
lets us do more.
Flips lets us do more.
Twists lets us do harder things on rings,

1515
01:33:24.250 --> 01:33:29.080
which means more points,
which means more gold medals.
And his,
let me,

1516
01:33:29.110 --> 01:33:33.490
let me throw out a couple of observations and you can correct me if this is

1517
01:33:33.491 --> 01:33:34.930
wrong,
but like one of them,

1518
01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:38.530
an example of something that people might think is f as theoretics and it

1519
01:33:38.650 --> 01:33:42.880
there's an aesthetic appeal but it's a side effect and not the reasoning behind

1520
01:33:42.881 --> 01:33:46.570
it would be a strong point in the toes,
right?

1521
01:33:46.570 --> 01:33:49.170
A strong plot on the legs.
See good.

1522
01:33:49.630 --> 01:33:53.680
So you see a lot of people doing handstands and I was guilty of this,
uh,

1523
01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:56.110
certainly.
And they have kind of a,

1524
01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:59.170
what I heard what one acrobat called Tofu feet.
They're like,

1525
01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:01.870
they're not fully dorsiflex to like,

1526
01:34:01.871 --> 01:34:04.920
they're not pulling the toes back to the knees,
which I think looks terrible.

1527
01:34:04.921 --> 01:34:06.160
So pretty common in yoga,

1528
01:34:06.161 --> 01:34:09.340
but they don't have that and they don't have a strong point.

1529
01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:12.430
And so they're there.
They're at the very least,

1530
01:34:12.431 --> 01:34:16.600
their quads and their adductors are really fully engaged,
loose.
They're loose.

1531
01:34:16.690 --> 01:34:20.020
And so they're,
they're,
they're leaking energy and all sorts of directions.

1532
01:34:20.021 --> 01:34:22.780
And it makes,
I liked that leaking energy.
Yeah.

1533
01:34:22.781 --> 01:34:24.670
It makes a very good description and it makes,

1534
01:34:24.671 --> 01:34:27.710
I think I probably stole it from Pavel Tsatsouline,
but the,
the,
uh,

1535
01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:31.290
this is a good buddy.
I follows a good friend of mine.
I like Paulo hobbles.

1536
01:34:31.291 --> 01:34:35.140
Paul was great and the,
and they're all,
and when,
what is the consequence?

1537
01:34:35.141 --> 01:34:37.090
The consequence,
there are consequences,

1538
01:34:37.091 --> 01:34:40.810
one of which is you're wasting energy so you're not going to be able to train as

1539
01:34:40.811 --> 01:34:43.990
efficiently.
Number two is you're not going to have the,

1540
01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:49.020
you're not going to develop the proper balance and alignment because you're

1541
01:34:49.151 --> 01:34:52.450
going to be flopping all over the place and having to correct more so than you

1542
01:34:52.451 --> 01:34:55.630
should.
And,
um,
so that just,

1543
01:34:55.631 --> 01:34:58.250
that pointing has a huge impact

1544
01:34:58.250 --> 01:35:02.540
<v 4>on your ability to train the hand stance like us.
Really strong point.
And,
uh,</v>

1545
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:07.970
the,
uh,
the other point I wanted to make is,

1546
01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:09.450
uh,
because I've,
I've of course in the,

1547
01:35:09.451 --> 01:35:11.840
in the attempt to try to work on this in the past,

1548
01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:15.500
which failed and I've made a ton of progress in the last few months,

1549
01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:16.430
but when doing it solo,

1550
01:35:16.431 --> 01:35:19.700
I would watch videos online and of course not all videos are created equal.

1551
01:35:20.150 --> 01:35:23.940
And you had see and preaching to the choir on that and you would,

1552
01:35:23.970 --> 01:35:26.720
and you would see people doing a press handstand,
but they would,

1553
01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:31.880
they would plant really hard.
Right?
So you would,
in other words,
you'd see people,

1554
01:35:31.881 --> 01:35:35.660
they put their hands flat on the ground in front of their toes and then they

1555
01:35:35.661 --> 01:35:39.290
shoot their head really far forward to their shoulders,
travel.

1556
01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:41.090
If you were to drop a plumb line,

1557
01:35:41.091 --> 01:35:44.390
like a string with a way to the end from their shoulders,
it would hit the floor,

1558
01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:48.620
say like eight inches in front of their branches in front.
Sure,
exactly.

1559
01:35:49.010 --> 01:35:52.910
And then they go up into the handstand and they have this arch in the back and

1560
01:35:52.911 --> 01:35:55.790
maybe their feet are pointing straight up.
And what does that look like?

1561
01:35:55.791 --> 01:35:59.660
It looks a lot like what was the gold standard in sort of muscle beach,

1562
01:36:00.650 --> 01:36:02.510
Venice or Santa Monica,

1563
01:36:02.511 --> 01:36:07.511
like 19 circa 1960 40 1950 [inaudible] 1940 [inaudible] 1950s but that's going

1564
01:36:08.991 --> 01:36:12.890
to place a lot more structural strain on the spine.
So then if the,

1565
01:36:12.891 --> 01:36:16.970
what is the proper version look like?
I mean roughly,
right?
You're,
you're,

1566
01:36:16.971 --> 01:36:20.120
you're years or roughly in between your shoulder blades.

1567
01:36:20.121 --> 01:36:24.620
Your in between your arms.
Yeah.
In between your arms fully,
uh,

1568
01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:29.180
shoulder,
shoulders extended up or not extended.
What am I looking for here?

1569
01:36:29.210 --> 01:36:29.750
Pressing,

1570
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:33.740
pressing down through the ground and keeping the hand the shoulders directly on

1571
01:36:33.741 --> 01:36:35.520
top of the hands.
Yeah.
And,
and for,

1572
01:36:35.530 --> 01:36:39.650
for people who want to just do a little experiment,
obviously goods do it safely.

1573
01:36:39.650 --> 01:36:43.370
But I was blown away the first time that someone showed this to me.

1574
01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:47.570
If you do a normal,
say kickup to handstand on the wall,

1575
01:36:47.650 --> 01:36:49.850
just the way that everybody does it,
right.
So you're,
you're,

1576
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.250
you're kind of flipping up and you end up looking away from the wall and there

1577
01:36:53.251 --> 01:36:54.740
are million ways to do well.
Let's see you do that.

1578
01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:57.860
And then instead of doing it the way you've always done it,

1579
01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:00.680
you see before you put your hands on the ground,

1580
01:37:00.710 --> 01:37:05.180
you start with your arms overhead in the position that you want to assume on the

1581
01:37:05.181 --> 01:37:08.210
ground and shrug your shoulders up as high as possible.

1582
01:37:08.211 --> 01:37:10.280
Trying to get your deltoids to the size of your ears,

1583
01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:12.620
maintain that position and then go up.

1584
01:37:12.621 --> 01:37:16.340
And the stability is just a world of difference.
I mean,
it's night,
nine day.

1585
01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:20.360
It's a completely different movement.
Uh,
the,
uh,

1586
01:37:21.370 --> 01:37:24.500
all right,
I have to ask this because a million people asked,

1587
01:37:24.530 --> 01:37:29.510
since we're on a roll here,
we've already checked off yoga.
Uh,
that's true.

1588
01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:30.740
And I have to come back guys.

1589
01:37:30.741 --> 01:37:33.090
I like everything else about yoga except your handstands.

1590
01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:37.960
So only a small amount of hate mail for the hands down.
Uh,

1591
01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:42.710
and,
uh,
some of the coaches,
and it doesn't have to be in gymnastics,

1592
01:37:42.711 --> 01:37:43.310
but some of the sea,

1593
01:37:43.310 --> 01:37:47.150
but certainly could be some of the coaches who have impressed you the most.

1594
01:37:47.210 --> 01:37:47.631
And I,

1595
01:37:47.631 --> 01:37:52.631
I took down in between like my bouts of hand shaking and like accidentally

1596
01:37:52.821 --> 01:37:55.490
getting chocked in my mouth during the assessment.
And like what,

1597
01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:56.160
when I could bend

1598
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:59.910
<v 2>my arms then do something.
I took these cryptic notes,</v>

1599
01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:04.950
I wrote down one name,
which was Alexander world champion,

1600
01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:09.840
male and female.
Does that ring any bells?
So,

1601
01:38:10.380 --> 01:38:14.970
you know,
I've been extremely,
extremely fortunate in my career.

1602
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:15.940
I have,
uh,

1603
01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:20.520
just a multitude of friends who are world and Olympic champions,

1604
01:38:20.521 --> 01:38:22.590
world and Olympic team members,
uh,

1605
01:38:22.650 --> 01:38:25.560
world and Olympic coaches and

1606
01:38:27.410 --> 01:38:29.270
for all,
for a long time.
And I just kind of,

1607
01:38:29.271 --> 01:38:30.870
cause if that's your environment day in,

1608
01:38:30.871 --> 01:38:33.000
day out and just kind of becomes your norm.
Right?

1609
01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:36.210
And then after a while you kind of stop and think.
Like one day I was,

1610
01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:40.800
I was at a competition and I was visiting with some friends of mine and I came

1611
01:38:40.801 --> 01:38:42.360
back and,
uh,
my,

1612
01:38:42.361 --> 01:38:47.361
my oldest daughter was maybe around 12 at the time and,

1613
01:38:47.371 --> 01:38:51.900
uh,
she was like,
oh my God,
do you know,
you know who you were talking to dad?

1614
01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:52.880
And I said,
well,
yes sweetie.

1615
01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:56.460
I know they're my friends who says that that was the Olympic champion and that

1616
01:38:56.461 --> 01:39:00.240
was the world champion.
So,
yeah,
I know big.
I know.
She's just like,

1617
01:39:00.570 --> 01:39:02.400
oh my good God.
Well,

1618
01:39:02.490 --> 01:39:07.490
Dimitri billows or Jeff is a good friend of mine and Dimitri is,

1619
01:39:07.711 --> 01:39:11.760
um,
one worlds in 83 at 16 years old,

1620
01:39:12.570 --> 01:39:15.300
16 years old,
just unbelievable.

1621
01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:19.500
Then he won again in [inaudible] 87.

1622
01:39:20.250 --> 01:39:24.090
What p what a lot of people don't know is in between there.
Dimitri,

1623
01:39:24.091 --> 01:39:25.620
obviously Russian,
uh,

1624
01:39:25.650 --> 01:39:30.650
Dimitri had a car accident and broke his left lower leg between the knee and the

1625
01:39:32.521 --> 01:39:37.350
ankle and 42 places.
Oh,
42 places a.
So basically,

1626
01:39:37.351 --> 01:39:41.580
you know,
as powder,
it's powder and uh,
he's,
you know,
they put a man,

1627
01:39:41.581 --> 01:39:43.470
he's unconscious,
he's on the table and he's,

1628
01:39:43.471 --> 01:39:47.370
he's covered up and they're getting ready to remove his,
uh,
his lower leg.

1629
01:39:47.610 --> 01:39:50.660
They're going to,
you know,
taking it off and,
uh,

1630
01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:56.120
the surgeon pulls the towel down the sheet down because he's prepped for

1631
01:39:56.161 --> 01:39:58.920
surgery.
I mean,
he's out and he sees it's Dimitri.

1632
01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:02.730
Now this is Russia right in the early eighties.

1633
01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:06.970
So know it's not,
it's not warm friendly Russia.
And,
uh,

1634
01:40:06.990 --> 01:40:10.170
the doctor,
he,
the doctor immediate like,
Holy Shit,

1635
01:40:10.171 --> 01:40:13.690
I am not cutting his leg off because of the surgeon who takes Dimitri bellows.

1636
01:40:13.730 --> 01:40:17.100
Chevs leg off is probably going to lose his hands shortly thereafter.

1637
01:40:17.101 --> 01:40:20.430
Also national hero.
So they,

1638
01:40:20.510 --> 01:40:24.960
they save his leg and Dimitri comes back from it and,
uh,

1639
01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:29.370
wins worlds and 87,
uh,
goes 88 Olympics.

1640
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:34.110
Does Greg Metal,
gold metals.
Uh,
well,
Dimitri was a,

1641
01:40:34.210 --> 01:40:36.900
I was lucky enough we're at different training camps in that.

1642
01:40:36.901 --> 01:40:40.980
Dimitri was my roommate and you know,
Russians are Russians,
right?
It takes,

1643
01:40:41.370 --> 01:40:43.980
it takes a long time for them to warm up to you.
So it took,

1644
01:40:43.981 --> 01:40:45.060
I don't know how many years,

1645
01:40:45.061 --> 01:40:48.390
but we started getting along real well after some years and he started sharing

1646
01:40:48.391 --> 01:40:51.630
some stuff and I'm like,
you know,
Dimitri,
because of his leg is trashed.

1647
01:40:51.670 --> 01:40:55.660
It was like a strategy.
She had eight.
And I said,
Dimitri,
you know how,

1648
01:40:55.870 --> 01:40:59.350
how the hell dude?
He says,
God only last for a few seconds.

1649
01:40:59.351 --> 01:41:03.910
I can do anything for a few seconds.
I said,
I don't know dude.

1650
01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:08.800
Well,
so this is great.
Right?
So He's,
you know,
a legend in gymnastics.

1651
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:12.730
If we get together with a room full of world and Olympic champions who are

1652
01:41:12.731 --> 01:41:16.630
Russian,
they will all differ to Dimitri.
He's,
he's that big a legend.

1653
01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:21.080
And this is in a room full of massive egos,
bandy.
These guys.
Yeah,
there's,

1654
01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:24.010
there's no shortage of confidence here.
And if Dimitris in the room,

1655
01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:27.760
they treat Dimitrios and it's,
it's a very,
very cool thing to see.

1656
01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:32.890
Well,
we go forward.
Ah,
Gosh,

1657
01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:37.690
I'm gonna forget my name.
Is it out?
Not Alexander,

1658
01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:42.490
while Alexandra and the reason that God had houses like my Alzheimer's,

1659
01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:46.930
my Alzheimer's is kicking up anyway,
we had um,

1660
01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:51.640
a world champion from the Russian on the women's side who a won worlds and

1661
01:41:51.641 --> 01:41:55.420
Dimitris coach Alexander was responsible for training both of them.

1662
01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:59.950
So Alexandra is the only one in history who produced a war,

1663
01:41:59.951 --> 01:42:04.780
a male world champion and a female world champion.
He's the only one.

1664
01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:09.040
And Alexander Right now is down coach in the a Brazilian team.

1665
01:42:09.490 --> 01:42:11.710
What is El Genders?
Is that his first or last name?

1666
01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:14.970
Slash I always screw up all the Russian pronunciations.

1667
01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:17.620
All my Russian friends are going to laugh because they're totally used to me

1668
01:42:17.621 --> 01:42:21.220
butchering this,
but it's like Alexander Alexander and off or something.

1669
01:42:21.490 --> 01:42:25.270
Got One of those and I'm like Sandra north of,
I know with my Russian friends,

1670
01:42:25.271 --> 01:42:27.490
I just say Alexander and everybody knows who I mean,

1671
01:42:27.491 --> 01:42:30.370
so I don't have to embarrass myself.
What,
what makes him,

1672
01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:36.310
what do you think allowed him,
made him,
makes him him.
Yeah,
exactly.

1673
01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:40.750
What makes them different?
What makes him him is the ability.

1674
01:42:40.990 --> 01:42:42.130
So it starts with

1675
01:42:43.690 --> 01:42:47.530
depth of knowledge to have enough depth of knowledge that you can look in an

1676
01:42:47.531 --> 01:42:52.270
athlete and plan what you need to be doing four years from now,

1677
01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:56.890
eight years from now,
and then reverse engineer all of it to today.

1678
01:42:57.910 --> 01:43:01.780
All the training cycles,
the strength,
the deloads,
uh,

1679
01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:05.350
it was from Dimitri that I for,
so back in 83,

1680
01:43:05.351 --> 01:43:09.430
Dimitri was the only gem and I think today probably one of the only ones who

1681
01:43:09.790 --> 01:43:14.200
every fourth week was a deload week.
Why?
To give the body a chance to recover.

1682
01:43:15.010 --> 01:43:17.890
Now there's a lot of people who talk to you load,
but way back then,
right?

1683
01:43:17.891 --> 01:43:20.260
The training,
if you'd visit with Dimitri ride,

1684
01:43:20.261 --> 01:43:23.140
it's always Chris it sits is mathematics.

1685
01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:27.670
It's all mathematics we do to them.
You take these correct pieces,

1686
01:43:27.671 --> 01:43:31.810
would you be like doing the correct numbers that creates your equation if you

1687
01:43:31.811 --> 01:43:34.330
put the equation together correctly and then you solve it,

1688
01:43:34.331 --> 01:43:37.780
there's your answer and your answer is the physical preparation at the end in a

1689
01:43:37.781 --> 01:43:42.280
successful competition.
So Alexander has great,

1690
01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:47.530
great at knowing we're going to just be consistent over this training block.

1691
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:50.470
So,
you know,
an Olympic cycle is four years long.

1692
01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:53.690
So we're getting ready to finish this to Olympics.
Right.

1693
01:43:53.691 --> 01:43:58.400
And then the next cycle starts.
So it could take,
for example,

1694
01:43:58.670 --> 01:44:03.560
to get someone to
75,

1695
01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:08.420
80% of their genetic capacity with a good,
with a good coach,

1696
01:44:08.421 --> 01:44:11.690
a good world class coach is going to take three to four years.

1697
01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:16.490
It's gonna take three to four years just to let the body grow,
adapt.

1698
01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:21.680
Do you think that's also true for 30 flight training and adult?
I do.

1699
01:44:21.890 --> 01:44:25.160
Okay,
great.
I do.
Uh,

1700
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:29.300
now that's a healthy adult.
That's a healthy adult.

1701
01:44:29.301 --> 01:44:33.800
So if they're severely compromised and I saw that,
you know,

1702
01:44:33.801 --> 01:44:36.740
to get through our whole,
our whole curriculum should take three to four years.

1703
01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:42.110
If they're severely compromised and we have to do damage repair,

1704
01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:45.750
we've got to heal some injuries.
We've got some chronic things.
Cause what,

1705
01:44:45.751 --> 01:44:46.880
what's a chronic injury?

1706
01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:51.170
A chronic injury is simply an injury that you kept abusing until it became

1707
01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:52.130
semipermanent.

1708
01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:55.670
That's all chronic injury as it means you slammed your hand in the door and it

1709
01:44:55.671 --> 01:44:57.080
hurt.
Okay.
And your,

1710
01:44:57.081 --> 01:45:00.560
your response to slamming your hand in the door to earning was to keep slamming

1711
01:45:00.561 --> 01:45:04.970
your hand in the fucking door.
You kept slamming in the door and you say,
God,

1712
01:45:04.971 --> 01:45:07.550
my hand really hurts.
Where at,
what should I do?
What should I do?
I said,
well,

1713
01:45:07.820 --> 01:45:12.020
quit slamming your hand in the damn door and it will get better.
But people,

1714
01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:15.110
they don't,
they don't really,
they don't think that way.
There's like,
well I,

1715
01:45:15.111 --> 01:45:15.681
but I really,

1716
01:45:15.681 --> 01:45:20.030
really like doing this and we get people coming to us really beat up cause we're

1717
01:45:20.031 --> 01:45:24.920
taught no pain,
no gain.
Well we flipped that around.
We say no brain,
no game.

1718
01:45:25.670 --> 01:45:28.640
Now we're not talking about the pain of fatigue.
They're the easy way to know.

1719
01:45:28.641 --> 01:45:33.641
The difference between fatigue and injury is simply the sharpness of the pain.

1720
01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:38.480
So for example,
and it's some experience also.
So if you,

1721
01:45:38.481 --> 01:45:40.760
if you're feeling you feeling pain right,

1722
01:45:40.761 --> 01:45:44.090
and maybe it's from a core workout and you stop,
you're doing hollow body rocks,

1723
01:45:44.091 --> 01:45:47.780
whatever it via,
it doesn't matter what you're doing,
sit ups,
you stop.

1724
01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:50.810
If it's fatigue,
it's immediately going to start to lessen.

1725
01:45:51.310 --> 01:45:53.900
As soon as soon as you stop,
the pain starts going away.

1726
01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:59.300
If it's an injury and you stop,
it's immediately gonna continue,

1727
01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:04.250
begin increasing.
That's your oh shit moment.
That's Ah,

1728
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:08.180
I have screwed myself up.
Right.
And so you Kinda,

1729
01:46:08.210 --> 01:46:09.830
you kinda have to ride that we want,

1730
01:46:09.831 --> 01:46:14.000
we want to work to where the body is working,
but we don't want to work so hard.

1731
01:46:14.001 --> 01:46:17.720
It's like for a long time it was a big thing for people doing kipping pull ups

1732
01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:22.010
to take pictures of their hands being raw and bloody from their rips.

1733
01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:24.770
And they were looking at it as a badge of honor.

1734
01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:29.420
You know that I worked so hard and in the short term for that,

1735
01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:33.650
for that moment,
yes.
Yeah.
They worked really hard.

1736
01:46:33.890 --> 01:46:37.850
Now I looked at it differently.
I looked at as like you stupid shit.

1737
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:42.020
What are you going to do tomorrow now?
Right.
Cause there's,
there's,

1738
01:46:42.021 --> 01:46:46.490
there's no amount of work you can do to day that could offset the amount of

1739
01:46:46.491 --> 01:46:49.320
progress you could have made throughout a properly structured week.

1740
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:50.100
Can't it can't

1741
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:53.660
<v 4>be done.
You see,
you see that with kettle bells a lot too.
I remember the,</v>

1742
01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:57.240
I remember when I was really deepened in Kettlebell training.
It was a,

1743
01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:02.130
yeah,
you take yourself out for God knows how long you rip all your calluses off,

1744
01:47:03.670 --> 01:47:06.300
<v 2>but they mean well,
they mean while we we,</v>

1745
01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:09.160
we tend to use two terms with our athletes.

1746
01:47:09.161 --> 01:47:14.161
We have immature athletes and mature athletes and definition,

1747
01:47:15.281 --> 01:47:19.090
and it's not an age deal.
It's,
it's an attitude DL,

1748
01:47:19.091 --> 01:47:23.320
so an immature athlete is someone who wants what they want right now.

1749
01:47:24.730 --> 01:47:25.540
Okay.

1750
01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:30.010
A mature athlete is someone who's willing to do what needs to be done now to

1751
01:47:30.011 --> 01:47:32.710
Gary awarded for it later.
The delayed gratification,

1752
01:47:33.490 --> 01:47:37.990
and it's the mature athlete that in the long run always comes out on top.

1753
01:47:37.991 --> 01:47:41.140
They're always the ones with the greater longevity in the greater success.

1754
01:47:41.470 --> 01:47:44.410
The other ones,
the image.
Sure ones,
if they're really talented,

1755
01:47:44.411 --> 01:47:46.030
they may stay ahead for a while,

1756
01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:50.710
but eventually you're going to get so dinged and broken and beat up that they

1757
01:47:50.711 --> 01:47:53.950
have to step aside and the mature guy in the mature athlete,

1758
01:47:53.951 --> 01:47:57.130
or I'm a woman right there,
they're just doing their thing day in,
day out.

1759
01:47:57.400 --> 01:48:01.810
It's like a writing a book that has 365 pages in it.

1760
01:48:02.380 --> 01:48:04.390
If I,
if I ask you tomorrow,
Tim,

1761
01:48:04.391 --> 01:48:07.810
go home tonight and write me a book with 365 pages.
You like,
Chris,

1762
01:48:07.811 --> 01:48:10.930
you've lost your fucking mind.
But if I say,
Tim,

1763
01:48:11.170 --> 01:48:14.590
I want you to write me a page,
a single page.

1764
01:48:14.970 --> 01:48:19.970
Every day in a year we've got a book with 365 pages and if you picture that,

1765
01:48:21.210 --> 01:48:23.940
that thickness of a novel that that's a lot of pages there.

1766
01:48:24.330 --> 01:48:26.970
But if I look at that thickness of a single page,

1767
01:48:27.690 --> 01:48:31.580
it's so thin that it seems negligible and it doesn't even matter.
It's like,
why?

1768
01:48:31.581 --> 01:48:34.090
Why did I bother?
Well,
it's,

1769
01:48:34.091 --> 01:48:38.100
it's the consistency that adds up over time.
That's where you see,

1770
01:48:38.101 --> 01:48:40.680
you see these great athletes,
got to understand,

1771
01:48:40.710 --> 01:48:45.270
they see you see a world class athlete that did not start training yesterday.

1772
01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:47.490
There's a multi year process.

1773
01:48:47.580 --> 01:48:52.580
<v 4>Well also I think that there is a behavioral modification and a component of</v>

1774
01:48:52.711 --> 01:48:53.550
this,
which you know,

1775
01:48:53.551 --> 01:48:57.210
if you wanted to dig in the resource into the researchers is supported this

1776
01:48:57.211 --> 01:49:02.211
point which is doing each day less than you feel maximally capable of is it's,

1777
01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:08.010
it's a fantastic sort of po positive reinforcer.

1778
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:10.920
And this applies in the supplies in sales.

1779
01:49:10.921 --> 01:49:15.090
This is what IBM did way back in the day when their salesforce was slaughtering

1780
01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:16.080
the competition.

1781
01:49:16.190 --> 01:49:21.190
They had the lowest quotas in the industry because they wanted their salespeople

1782
01:49:21.721 --> 01:49:25.250
to be unintimidated to pick up the phone so we could substitute intimidated and

1783
01:49:25.260 --> 01:49:28.410
I got the phone with intimidated to go to the gym or start a session.

1784
01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:33.120
You can also apply it to writing.
I'll leave a little in the bank.

1785
01:49:33.150 --> 01:49:34.900
They've lived in the bank.
I remember,
uh,
the,

1786
01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:38.550
there were two examples offhand as it applies to writing.

1787
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:43.350
A friend of mine who's very,
very consistent,
prolific writer and he said,

1788
01:49:43.351 --> 01:49:46.470
my key is every day I write less than I feel capable of.

1789
01:49:47.010 --> 01:49:49.900
And they know a guideline that I was given was two crappy pages per day.

1790
01:49:49.930 --> 01:49:51.640
That's all you have to do.
Two crappy pages.

1791
01:49:51.641 --> 01:49:54.130
And sometimes you overshoot that and you have a great workout and you're feeling

1792
01:49:54.131 --> 01:49:56.470
as you put it froggy,
right,
you're feeling fancy,

1793
01:49:57.010 --> 01:50:01.000
they're feeling fantastic and you just blow through it and set a bunch of prs.

1794
01:50:01.001 --> 01:50:05.140
But you didn't go into the workout with the pressure of having to achieve prs

1795
01:50:05.141 --> 01:50:09.820
and every exercise and uh,
you know,
Hemingway not maybe not the gray,

1796
01:50:09.850 --> 01:50:11.110
the best life model,

1797
01:50:11.140 --> 01:50:15.130
but was prolific writers still listed and he would,

1798
01:50:15.131 --> 01:50:16.990
he would end mid sentence,

1799
01:50:16.991 --> 01:50:20.590
he would end still feeling like he had more to say in a specific paragraph or

1800
01:50:20.591 --> 01:50:24.130
sentence so that he had a place to pick up the next day,
the a of that.

1801
01:50:24.250 --> 01:50:26.110
And so on the point of consistency,

1802
01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:29.110
and actually I want you to finish your last thought because I totally hijacked

1803
01:50:29.710 --> 01:50:34.000
the conversation,
but you said it takes three to date.
Jack my thoughts.
So three,

1804
01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:35.110
three to four,

1805
01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:40.210
three to four years to to get them to what percentage of their genetic

1806
01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:43.210
<v 2>and that,
and this is ballpark 75 to 80 and this,</v>

1807
01:50:43.211 --> 01:50:45.820
this is just an example to people cause the body,

1808
01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:49.960
the body will not let you run it.
100% won't do it.
Won't do it.

1809
01:50:49.961 --> 01:50:52.300
There's not enough optimal surplus that we mentioned earlier,

1810
01:50:53.230 --> 01:50:58.230
three to four years to get to 75 80% it will take me another three to four

1811
01:50:59.291 --> 01:51:03.640
years,
another three to four years to get to about 90%

1812
01:51:05.170 --> 01:51:06.820
another three to four years.

1813
01:51:07.150 --> 01:51:12.150
And then after that it will take me another three to four years to get to about

1814
01:51:13.031 --> 01:51:17.560
95% and that's me riding herd on them.

1815
01:51:17.561 --> 01:51:20.260
That's my standards.
Right?
Cause member,

1816
01:51:20.261 --> 01:51:24.910
it's easier for me to maintain that immaculate standard because I'm not the one

1817
01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:27.840
feeling the fatigue right now.
Okay.

1818
01:51:27.850 --> 01:51:31.060
As much easier you gets very difficult for a world class athlete to train

1819
01:51:31.061 --> 01:51:32.350
themselves.
Right.

1820
01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:36.820
And it doesn't do a good a worldclass coach any good to have all that knowledge

1821
01:51:36.821 --> 01:51:39.130
in his head.
It takes a partnership,
right?

1822
01:51:39.131 --> 01:51:43.360
It takes both of them working together to create this great athletic animal.

1823
01:51:43.810 --> 01:51:44.560
So,

1824
01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:48.580
but the interesting thing is that another three to four years to get the 95% and

1825
01:51:48.581 --> 01:51:49.870
as soon as they ease up,

1826
01:51:51.300 --> 01:51:55.950
the body drops back down to that 75 80 that's where likes now to build back up,

1827
01:51:55.951 --> 01:52:00.030
won't take nearly as long as to build it in the first place.
Okay.

1828
01:52:00.060 --> 01:52:03.240
Because the structures are already in place,
nervous systems are developed,
Yadi,

1829
01:52:03.241 --> 01:52:06.930
Yadi Yada,
Yada Yada.
But that's where the bodies comfortable.

1830
01:52:07.710 --> 01:52:11.700
So as far as adults are concerned,
okay,
are they,

1831
01:52:11.730 --> 01:52:16.730
does a 35 year old need to be able to produce at 90% no,

1832
01:52:18.210 --> 01:52:21.750
they don't.
Do they need at 95% no,
they're,

1833
01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:23.820
they're not full time professional athletes.
They don't,

1834
01:52:23.821 --> 01:52:24.930
they don't have time for that.

1835
01:52:25.620 --> 01:52:29.880
Can they produce at 75 80% yes they can.

1836
01:52:29.881 --> 01:52:34.860
And the interesting thing is is,
well that puts you on the Olympic team now.

1837
01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:39.900
Absolutely.
Absolutely not.
Are you going to be close to it now?
But is it,

1838
01:52:40.050 --> 01:52:43.650
well it puts you being better than 99 out of 100 people around you.

1839
01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:45.980
Absolutely.
Yeah,

1840
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:49.630
<v 4>absolutely.
It will pay you there.
And if we put a percentage on that,</v>

1841
01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:52.040
that means that just by being consistent,

1842
01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:57.020
putting some years consistent years of training in that puts you in the top 1%

1843
01:52:57.021 --> 01:53:00.080
of the human population in terms of physical ability.

1844
01:53:01.250 --> 01:53:05.310
That is not a bad consolation prize.
No,
it's,
it's not.

1845
01:53:05.340 --> 01:53:09.320
I want to underscore the consistency point because I've always been an intensity

1846
01:53:09.321 --> 01:53:11.750
guy.
Right.
I mean,
for the most part because that's my easy,

1847
01:53:11.810 --> 01:53:16.810
that's my default mode and it's served me when everybody's right.

1848
01:53:16.861 --> 01:53:20.600
Yeah,
it's served.
It's served me well.
Uh,
but there's a,
there's a point where,

1849
01:53:20.630 --> 01:53:24.680
you know,
the,
the,
the sword cuts both ways and uh,

1850
01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:29.330
you sent me an email recently,
I'm going to replace the name just in,

1851
01:53:29.331 --> 01:53:30.620
unless we decide to,

1852
01:53:30.650 --> 01:53:34.170
as going to say or maybe take out the profanity just in case.
Yeah.

1853
01:53:34.171 --> 01:53:38.660
I'll take out the f bombs
dear you lazy bastard.
No,

1854
01:53:38.661 --> 01:53:41.660
that's not how it started.
So,
so this,
this,
I just want to,

1855
01:53:41.670 --> 01:53:45.650
because I want to talk about older students who have picked up gymnastics and

1856
01:53:45.710 --> 01:53:46.340
okay.

1857
01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:51.340
So there are a lot of people who are rightly I think naturally skeptical of the

1858
01:53:51.381 --> 01:53:56.381
ability of say 35 38 40 plus year old to acquire these skills that are

1859
01:53:56.481 --> 01:53:58.910
associated with people who start when they're five six seven years old.

1860
01:53:59.270 --> 01:54:02.180
So I'm going to replace the name with Frank.
Okay.

1861
01:54:02.181 --> 01:54:07.181
So I was having a hell of a lot of trouble with Tuck hops and to to just explain

1862
01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:14.140
that and I fully plan for everyone listening to put a lot of of video examples

1863
01:54:14.210 --> 01:54:18.740
in the show notes.
You'll have visual references for a lot of this,
but top cops,

1864
01:54:18.741 --> 01:54:22.670
it's a great exercise and there are different ways to practice this but it Tuck

1865
01:54:22.671 --> 01:54:26.480
handstand is instead of having your body ramrod straight from your,

1866
01:54:26.780 --> 01:54:30.200
your hands all the way to your pointed toes at the very top,
your,

1867
01:54:30.350 --> 01:54:35.350
you're basically bringing your knees to your chest or rib cage while you're in

1868
01:54:35.841 --> 01:54:39.020
the handstand position with your feet still pointed.

1869
01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:42.800
But your heels kind of touching your ass.
Is that a fair,
fair description?

1870
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:47.180
I agree with that.
And I was having a lot of trouble with range of motion.
Uh,

1871
01:54:47.210 --> 01:54:51.350
I just couldn't get low enough.
And so coach sent me an email,
which was,
you know,

1872
01:54:51.351 --> 01:54:53.360
frank is one of my senior students.

1873
01:54:53.361 --> 01:54:56.120
Here's a video of him working his Tuck handstand compression.

1874
01:54:56.780 --> 01:54:59.870
While it's not exactly the same exercises does provide a nice visual example.

1875
01:54:59.871 --> 01:55:03.920
Now the part that stands out for me is what follows the video cause I watched

1876
01:55:03.921 --> 01:55:07.580
the video and was like,
okay,
that's,
that's,
that's pretty solid.
Uh,

1877
01:55:07.790 --> 01:55:11.750
and you said,
you know,
he started roughly two years ago out of shape,

1878
01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:15.860
weak and rather pudgy on his first workout.
I believe that he failed three times,

1879
01:55:15.861 --> 01:55:18.500
12 seconds bent hollow body hold.

1880
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:23.720
And I've been there.
There are people in wheelchairs that are stronger in that.

1881
01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:24.291
Yeah.

1882
01:55:24.291 --> 01:55:28.070
And I prob probably going to get the [inaudible] not going to do this exercise

1883
01:55:28.071 --> 01:55:28.491
justice,

1884
01:55:28.491 --> 01:55:33.260
but I mean a bent hollow by they hold is effectively like imagine if you're in
a,

1885
01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:36.710
in a crunch position on the floor.
Right.

1886
01:55:36.770 --> 01:55:41.770
And then you put your arms just kind of kind of pick your feet up,

1887
01:55:42.231 --> 01:55:44.070
like you were going to do a sit up,
except don't

1888
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:47.970
<v 2>set up shoulders up a little off the ground,
feed off a little ground,</v>

1889
01:55:48.150 --> 01:55:50.160
and then just try to rock back and forth.

1890
01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:53.820
<v 4>That's it.
So he filled that 12,
couldn't do three sets of that times 12 second,</v>

1891
01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:57.650
couldn't do it.
Not a chance.
Fast forward two years,
and he's a beast in there.

1892
01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:01.940
There were two recipes.
There are two points here that really,
uh,

1893
01:56:02.970 --> 01:56:05.490
left the market meets.
The first was,
he's very consistent.
Okay,

1894
01:56:05.491 --> 01:56:08.550
we've talked about that.
But here it has the part that I really liked.

1895
01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:10.170
So he never rushes through exercise.

1896
01:56:10.171 --> 01:56:13.470
And every time he gets stuck on a progression and is not able to break through

1897
01:56:13.471 --> 01:56:14.670
that particular plateau,

1898
01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:18.480
he simply drops all the way back to the first progression and begins working his

1899
01:56:18.481 --> 01:56:18.930
way up.

1900
01:56:18.930 --> 01:56:23.580
So I want to try to illustrate this because this is a really,

1901
01:56:23.730 --> 01:56:25.470
cause most people,
myself included,

1902
01:56:25.471 --> 01:56:29.910
we'll just bang their heads against a wall with the,
with the plateau movement,

1903
01:56:30.110 --> 01:56:34.980
right?
So let's,
let's take the talk.
Uh,
I'm not,
I'm sorry not to talk,

1904
01:56:34.981 --> 01:56:36.570
but the,
uh,
the press handstand,

1905
01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:39.660
which we've been talking about as a great kind of bang for the buck objective

1906
01:56:39.690 --> 01:56:42.330
because it incorporates so many different elements and attributes that you need

1907
01:56:42.331 --> 01:56:43.164
to develop.

1908
01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:48.300
What would a series of progressions,

1909
01:56:48.301 --> 01:56:51.330
like four or five progressions for that look like?

1910
01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:55.360
And does it literally mean that if,
if,

1911
01:56:55.410 --> 01:56:57.870
if he couldn't get through movement five,

1912
01:56:57.871 --> 01:57:00.990
that he would drop all the way back to number one or would he go back to number

1913
01:57:00.991 --> 01:57:01.824
two and number three?

1914
01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:06.640
<v 2>All right,
back to number one.
Okay.
Now he might,
he might go to,</v>

1915
01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:13.000
he might not start with,
uh,
the very weak one programming have,

1916
01:57:13.001 --> 01:57:17.830
you know,
three by one rep.
He might,
he might drop back to a week 11.

1917
01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:18.731
You know,

1918
01:57:18.731 --> 01:57:22.540
where it's where we provide the programming where it's five by five and you see

1919
01:57:22.541 --> 01:57:27.400
demonstrate mastery then next workout bump.
But basically what,

1920
01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:31.780
what he's doing as if he failed on that exercise,

1921
01:57:32.140 --> 01:57:34.630
that means there was a chink in the armor somewhere.

1922
01:57:34.631 --> 01:57:39.631
There was a hole and the preparation there was at some deficit or super add.

1923
01:57:40.201 --> 01:57:43.930
It add up to a deaf said that had been overlooked or some part of the body that

1924
01:57:43.931 --> 01:57:48.340
had not yet super compensated.
So by stepping off,

1925
01:57:48.430 --> 01:57:50.110
so basically you want,

1926
01:57:50.111 --> 01:57:52.870
we want people to go through when they're in training to just be super

1927
01:57:52.871 --> 01:57:53.501
simplistic.

1928
01:57:53.501 --> 01:57:58.501
We want their training to go through a period of overload where whatever they're

1929
01:57:58.691 --> 01:58:02.110
doing is kicking their ass.
Okay?
It's hard.
It's intense.

1930
01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:04.930
And then without changing reps or sets,
right,

1931
01:58:05.170 --> 01:58:10.170
we want the body then to go into a period of load or that same amount of work,

1932
01:58:10.481 --> 01:58:14.350
that same load,
same exercise,
same rep,
same sets,

1933
01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:17.680
feels moderately difficult.
So it's,

1934
01:58:17.710 --> 01:58:20.770
it's feeling easier because the body's gotten stronger.

1935
01:58:21.460 --> 01:58:24.070
And then where people always cut it short,
where they,

1936
01:58:24.071 --> 01:58:29.071
where they undermine themselves here is they don't go into underload.

1937
01:58:29.530 --> 01:58:32.620
So to be super simplistic underload is where,
damn,

1938
01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:35.920
I'm just not feel like I'm working very hard.
You're moving the same way.

1939
01:58:36.670 --> 01:58:39.790
You're doing the same reps,
you're doing the same sets,
right?
But you're just,

1940
01:58:39.791 --> 01:58:40.870
you're just cutting it short.

1941
01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:45.670
People tend to do is they want to ride that razor's edge.
I did this much today.

1942
01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:48.310
I'm going to do this,
Ma,
I'm going to do more next week.

1943
01:58:48.430 --> 01:58:52.990
That typical five pounds on the bar.
Okay,
well that's,
that's great.
You know,

1944
01:58:52.991 --> 01:58:56.500
if that was the case,
I remember my first way to pull up work out.
I was excited.

1945
01:58:56.800 --> 01:59:00.610
I was excited way back when I was a teenager,
I came home and hit my five pounds.

1946
01:59:00.611 --> 01:59:04.500
I pulled out my calendar,
did five pounds,
I'm gonna do pound every week.
I said,

1947
01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:09.070
Holy Shit.
How could it be pulling 1500 pounds in a year?
Man,
I'm world champion.

1948
01:59:09.100 --> 01:59:12.660
World champion in the making.
Well,

1949
01:59:13.330 --> 01:59:16.300
linear doesn't work that way.
It doesn't work that way.

1950
01:59:16.860 --> 01:59:18.460
So what happens is that you hit,

1951
01:59:18.490 --> 01:59:23.170
you hit that point of where you're maxed out currently and then you got to step

1952
01:59:23.171 --> 01:59:27.100
off and we got to give the body a chance to accommodate.
So for example,

1953
01:59:27.101 --> 01:59:30.760
you mentioned,
you mentioned Rob Wolf.
Rob is a good buddy.
Rob,
super sharp.

1954
01:59:30.761 --> 01:59:33.370
For those of you who don't know,
he's a nutrition of Guru.

1955
01:59:33.371 --> 01:59:37.540
Checkout is stuff BB for people are OPB the ice guy.

1956
01:59:37.541 --> 01:59:42.440
He's got two bs there.
Well,
you know,
rob,
rob is a high intensity guy like you,

1957
01:59:42.441 --> 01:59:43.150
Tim.

1958
01:59:43.150 --> 01:59:47.800
And so I shared with them the year Allen One national sown and national

1959
01:59:47.801 --> 01:59:52.480
champion.
Imagine you have defeated the entire country right there.

1960
01:59:52.481 --> 01:59:57.310
There's one champion and your it.
Everyone.
You kicked their ass.

1961
01:59:57.890 --> 02:00:01.330
Unbelievable feeling extreme.
Extremely awesome.
Well,

1962
02:00:01.331 --> 02:00:06.331
that year I didn't change anything on Alan's conditioning the entire year.

1963
02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:13.000
Not,
not a damn thing.
I didn't change an exercise.
I didn't change a rep.

1964
02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:18.010
I didn't change a set,
not for that entire year.
So,

1965
02:00:18.190 --> 02:00:21.100
so,
so you mean that they're the,
for the,

1966
02:00:21.101 --> 02:00:25.500
for the progressive resistance purists out there,
there,

1967
02:00:25.501 --> 02:00:28.000
there might be another way.
Well,

1968
02:00:28.450 --> 02:00:32.570
but remember he wasn't a beginning and he wasn't a beginner at this point.
No,

1969
02:00:32.580 --> 02:00:33.610
because I beginner,
right?

1970
02:00:33.670 --> 02:00:38.140
It wouldn't do any good if I can do a wall push up inclined on the wall.
I mean,

1971
02:00:38.141 --> 02:00:40.870
Alan was strong.
He was already doing hollow back process.
You know,

1972
02:00:40.871 --> 02:00:44.740
rope climbs were for maintenance of healthy elbows,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada.

1973
02:00:45.190 --> 02:00:48.160
But for that year,
I didn't change anything.

1974
02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:53.890
All that changed was workout.
That took an hour,

1975
02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:57.880
got to the point where it was taken 40 to 45 minutes.

1976
02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:01.390
At which point do your stretching it out because the less time you're in the gym

1977
02:01:01.391 --> 02:01:05.200
the better.
Okay.
Cause it's less wear and tear on the body.
Think,
think of it.

1978
02:01:05.530 --> 02:01:07.210
You know when,
when I hear what you mentioned,

1979
02:01:07.211 --> 02:01:11.690
you know people who love to be high intensity.
Okay,
it's cool.
But the,

1980
02:01:11.691 --> 02:01:15.160
the analogy that comes to mind is someone who wants to be high intensity all the

1981
02:01:15.161 --> 02:01:15.850
time.

1982
02:01:15.850 --> 02:01:19.810
It's like having a new set of tires and every time you come up to a stop sign,

1983
02:01:20.140 --> 02:01:24.610
you don't gradually break.
You slam those brakes hard.
Use Skid to a stop.

1984
02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:28.960
Every single stop sign.
How long has that pair of tires going to last?

1985
02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:32.860
It's not,
it's going to wear out pretty quick.
And the body now,

1986
02:01:32.861 --> 02:01:34.090
the body's not like tires.

1987
02:01:34.091 --> 02:01:39.091
It can rebuild itself as long as you don't put it too deep into a hall are

1988
02:01:39.531 --> 02:01:40.460
physically

1989
02:01:40.670 --> 02:01:45.020
<v 3>break the structure,
damage the structure beyond repair.
So you know as long,</v>

1990
02:01:45.021 --> 02:01:48.590
as long as you show some degree of care,
you rebuild yourself.

1991
02:01:48.591 --> 02:01:53.090
But if you keep skin to that stop every single day,
right?
Matter of time,

1992
02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:58.320
now advertise,
not if it's,
it's guaranteed.
So let's,
let's,
let's uh,

1993
02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:02.420
throw out a couple of,
I'll use another automotive metaphor.

1994
02:02:02.421 --> 02:02:07.421
Let's switch gears and I will ask just a couple of questions that I think people

1995
02:02:08.091 --> 02:02:09.710
would love to hear answers to.
Uh,

1996
02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:13.160
the first is someone's listens to this,

1997
02:02:13.161 --> 02:02:18.161
they're extremely excited to do gymnastic strength training and maybe they go

1998
02:02:18.441 --> 02:02:21.890
out and they're like sampling different things from all sorts of different

1999
02:02:21.891 --> 02:02:24.290
places.
Uh,
and uh,
you know,

2000
02:02:24.291 --> 02:02:27.960
of course I have no business I should say with full disclosure.

2001
02:02:27.961 --> 02:02:31.730
I have no business association.
I'm not getting any kind of affiliate.

2002
02:02:31.731 --> 02:02:34.790
Anything from you.
I just am a real fan of how you train.

2003
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:38.210
So I think people should check out and shape your,
your,
your training programs.

2004
02:02:38.211 --> 02:02:43.211
But what exercises should people not attempt or just removed from consideration

2005
02:02:44.001 --> 02:02:48.980
for the first say six months of gymnastic strength training?

2006
02:02:50.210 --> 02:02:53.270
Probably such a good question.

2007
02:02:53.810 --> 02:02:58.240
I would say muscle ups.
I would say muscle ups.
Um,

2008
02:02:58.910 --> 02:03:00.890
the issue becomes,
is nothing wrong with the pole.

2009
02:03:00.891 --> 02:03:02.700
There's nothing wrong with the debt.
Uh,

2010
02:03:02.750 --> 02:03:05.120
the shoulders will adapt relatively quickly and you know,

2011
02:03:05.121 --> 02:03:07.040
they'll get up on rings at first and they're shaking.

2012
02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:10.720
And that's simply because the stabilizers aren't used to the load.

2013
02:03:10.750 --> 02:03:15.200
But that that'll adapt within,
you know,
two weeks,
four weeks,
there'll be fine.

2014
02:03:15.530 --> 02:03:19.190
The issue they run into is because their shoulder extension as weak.

2015
02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:21.560
They can't get the elbow behind the torso.

2016
02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:24.920
So instead of doing a dip with bodyweight,

2017
02:03:25.220 --> 02:03:28.940
now they're trying to do a tricep extension with bodyweight.

2018
02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:33.530
Completely different animal,
completely different animal.
As you know,

2019
02:03:33.531 --> 02:03:35.360
they're kind of have,
their elbows can't go,

2020
02:03:35.361 --> 02:03:38.240
their elbows are trapped at their side and now their hands are in front of them

2021
02:03:38.241 --> 02:03:40.520
and they're just trying to press himself up.
Of course,

2022
02:03:40.521 --> 02:03:44.210
they're just trash and they're always,
no,
some people,
okay,
we do see it.

2023
02:03:44.211 --> 02:03:48.620
Some people have incredible joints that you can just pound and pound and pound

2024
02:03:48.621 --> 02:03:52.370
and pound and pound.
Nothing happens to him.
Run him over with a car.

2025
02:03:52.630 --> 02:03:54.200
I all you're going to do is hurt your car.

2026
02:03:56.210 --> 02:03:59.210
Everyone assumes they're that guy there,
that woman.

2027
02:03:59.510 --> 02:04:04.490
The reality is you're not guys,
you are not that person.
If you were that person,

2028
02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:06.590
I would see you at training camps right now,

2029
02:04:06.591 --> 02:04:09.140
or you would be a celebrator professional level athlete.

2030
02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:14.210
So accept the fact that you're human and those are not your joints.
And so you,

2031
02:04:14.211 --> 02:04:17.570
you can't take that approach and have longevity is not going to happen.

2032
02:04:18.570 --> 02:04:22.220
So there you guys,
a muscle ups go out,
it must loves go out.

2033
02:04:22.221 --> 02:04:25.190
Now how do they get around the muscle up?
How do they get,

2034
02:04:25.191 --> 02:04:28.730
cause it's their elbows hurt and they can't do a slow,
we need to build strength.

2035
02:04:28.731 --> 02:04:33.140
We got to do it slow.
Right?
How do they get around?
They do the kipping muscle up.

2036
02:04:33.980 --> 02:04:36.740
Okay,
well that gets me on top of the rings.

2037
02:04:37.050 --> 02:04:41.460
But where I get the benefit of muscle ups is through that transition is I'm

2038
02:04:41.461 --> 02:04:45.900
going between the pullup through my chest,
up of them.
That's where it crosses,

2039
02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:48.960
that's where plan jazz,
that's where Maltese is.

2040
02:04:48.961 --> 02:04:52.620
That's where all advanced ring strength is.
It's,
it's that strength when you,

2041
02:04:52.740 --> 02:04:57.360
when you see a gymnast,
right when you see him this summer at the Olympics,
right?

2042
02:04:57.361 --> 02:04:59.590
And we're,
we just as an aside guys,
we've got,

2043
02:04:59.591 --> 02:05:02.580
and we've got some podcasts coming out for gymnastic by,
sorry,

2044
02:05:02.581 --> 02:05:04.120
Tim competing with here.
That's all right.

2045
02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:06.720
And we're going to talk some train and right with,

2046
02:05:06.721 --> 02:05:11.490
with summer by the Olympic guys.
And when you,
when you see them,
right,

2047
02:05:11.790 --> 02:05:12.930
you are a,

2048
02:05:12.990 --> 02:05:16.350
you're going to see this massive musculature and it didn't come from pushups and

2049
02:05:16.351 --> 02:05:20.430
it didn't come from dips.
It came from that advanced ring strength.
They do.

2050
02:05:20.820 --> 02:05:24.300
So if you're doing a kipping muscle up and you're going from below the rings too

2051
02:05:24.301 --> 02:05:25.620
on top of the range and it's gone,

2052
02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:30.080
you just skip the most beneficial part of the muscle up.
[inaudible]

2053
02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:34.140
let me ask you a related question because of course,
every four years,
uh,

2054
02:05:34.230 --> 02:05:35.520
I watch gymnastics.

2055
02:05:35.521 --> 02:05:39.030
I love watching gymnastics as do a lot of people when they go,
Holy Shit,

2056
02:05:39.031 --> 02:05:44.031
if I can get arms that look like that by hanging from a bar for an hour a day,

2057
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:48.330
I need to start hanging from a bar.
How much of,
I know we talked about the rings,

2058
02:05:48.660 --> 02:05:51.960
how much of the musculature in the upper arms,

2059
02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:56.880
biceps specifically comes from straight arm work versus some form of bent arm

2060
02:05:56.881 --> 02:06:00.210
work?
Excellent.
Excellent question.

2061
02:06:00.570 --> 02:06:05.280
So the majority of the massive biceps they see is going to come from the

2062
02:06:05.281 --> 02:06:09.810
straight arm work.
Uh,
we use self for example,

2063
02:06:09.811 --> 02:06:11.430
when the guys would,
uh,

2064
02:06:11.820 --> 02:06:16.400
at that level of training at that level of strength.
Uh,

2065
02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:21.480
rope climbs for example.
So my,
my guys had to do a triple on a seven meter rope.

2066
02:06:21.510 --> 02:06:26.340
So that's what,
no,
all rope climbs are done with no legs.
Okay.
And GST,

2067
02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:29.880
we do ropes without legs.
We get,
some people say,

2068
02:06:29.881 --> 02:06:32.130
and all the rope is used for transportation.

2069
02:06:32.490 --> 02:06:35.790
As soon as they take out the escalators in a mall and they put ropes in,

2070
02:06:35.791 --> 02:06:38.460
in place of it,
or they take the elevators out and they put ropes,

2071
02:06:38.490 --> 02:06:42.750
I'll buy that argument that we use a rope for transportation until that happens.

2072
02:06:42.930 --> 02:06:46.890
Or rope is used for getting freaking strong.
Right?

2073
02:06:46.950 --> 02:06:49.860
That's the point of how in a row.
So they would,

2074
02:06:49.861 --> 02:06:53.010
they would in five minutes they would do a triple on a seven meter rope,

2075
02:06:53.250 --> 02:06:55.650
get in the back of the line,
do a double on a seven meter,

2076
02:06:55.710 --> 02:06:58.980
get back in the line and do another and that'd be about five minutes worth of

2077
02:06:58.981 --> 02:07:02.190
work.
Okay.
Now for them,
what we did notice,

2078
02:07:02.191 --> 02:07:06.780
and a lot of people miss this oriented two things here at once.

2079
02:07:06.780 --> 02:07:10.470
So for the maximal strength component of it,
it's the straight arm work,

2080
02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:15.010
Maltese work in particular or it just blows the body out,
Blah.

2081
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:19.440
And people listening don't just go into your garage and try a Maltese on your

2082
02:07:19.441 --> 02:07:24.240
rings,
but you can,
you can totally cause I don't think Maltese will hurt you.

2083
02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:28.860
That ball is won't hurt you,
but you are landing on the concrete,
on your face.

2084
02:07:28.861 --> 02:07:31.920
Underneath the rings is probably going to hurt.
The multis won't.

2085
02:07:31.921 --> 02:07:34.800
It's the sudden stop at the end.
That will be uncomfortable.

2086
02:07:36.490 --> 02:07:40.090
But uh,
now what we found out with the guys though is,
uh,

2087
02:07:40.150 --> 02:07:43.750
you know we did over the years,
the,
the weight vests,
the weights,
the heavy,

2088
02:07:43.780 --> 02:07:48.780
the heavy weighted row kinds pullups nothing better mass on a bicep secondary

2089
02:07:50.201 --> 02:07:54.670
from the ring strength,
then high volume rope climbs,
nothing.

2090
02:07:54.910 --> 02:07:58.660
Nothing blew them up.
Now the key though is,
is for everybody listening.

2091
02:07:58.660 --> 02:08:02.680
If you go and you jump right into ropes right now and you haven't built a

2092
02:08:02.681 --> 02:08:05.290
foundation of rows pull ups,

2093
02:08:05.291 --> 02:08:08.950
multiplane pulling and then get to rope climbing,
right?

2094
02:08:09.100 --> 02:08:12.820
You're going to give yourself a raging case of elbow tendonitis.
Yeah.

2095
02:08:12.821 --> 02:08:17.030
Your elbows are going to just
disintegrate.
Yup.

2096
02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:20.020
So like anything else,
you gotta pay your dues.

2097
02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:24.250
But if you go through the proper steps and you're prepared to do rope climbs

2098
02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:24.581
there,

2099
02:08:24.581 --> 02:08:28.810
there is nothing American is the Bicep is an endurance muscle that that's its

2100
02:08:28.811 --> 02:08:33.670
job,
right?
It,
it,
it,
it's,
it's job isn't to how am I now it can do this,

2101
02:08:33.850 --> 02:08:38.500
but its primary function is not to how much can I do that heaviest load for one

2102
02:08:38.501 --> 02:08:42.040
rep,
it's primary function is go out and kill something,

2103
02:08:42.460 --> 02:08:47.460
pick it up and carried it a long ass way back home that that's its primary job.

2104
02:08:48.250 --> 02:08:52.300
That's his primary job.
So it just blossoms from high volume work.

2105
02:08:52.301 --> 02:08:57.301
Now the key is is that it's got to be high volume with her reasonably high load,

2106
02:08:58.151 --> 02:09:02.170
which on the rope climbs his bodyweight.
But we,
we've got to build to that.

2107
02:09:02.260 --> 02:09:05.500
So to two things that I'll throw out there just because people might find it

2108
02:09:05.501 --> 02:09:10.390
interesting.
So the first is you can build extremely muscular biceps.

2109
02:09:10.391 --> 02:09:14.440
This is not gymnastics related,
but with purely straight arm,

2110
02:09:14.830 --> 02:09:19.480
heavy,
heavy pulling in the deadlift can unwind with let's just,

2111
02:09:19.481 --> 02:09:24.481
let's just say you had one day of heavy polling and by heavy I mean two to three

2112
02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:25.990
reps,
like to the knees,

2113
02:09:25.991 --> 02:09:29.680
kind of like the Barry Ross Protocol and the four hour body stop.

2114
02:09:29.970 --> 02:09:31.480
No centrix you know,
drop it.

2115
02:09:31.481 --> 02:09:36.160
And then let's say you do that on Mondays and then on Fridays or Thursdays,

2116
02:09:36.170 --> 02:09:39.010
whatever it might be,
you do higher up kettle bell swings,

2117
02:09:39.070 --> 02:09:41.650
two armed kettlebell swings.
You can get really,

2118
02:09:41.710 --> 02:09:46.040
really muscular arms without doing any work whatsoever.
Um,

2119
02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:47.800
and uh,

2120
02:09:47.940 --> 02:09:52.310
also when we're talking about an easy enough to switch that high rep Kettlebell

2121
02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:56.770
work to a throw rope climb on Friday,
if you are advanced enough,

2122
02:09:56.800 --> 02:10:00.730
if your elbows are bulletproof enough,
which mine are not as,

2123
02:10:00.731 --> 02:10:04.930
as an example for folks like I've done plenty of rowing but my,
when I have,

2124
02:10:04.980 --> 02:10:08.860
here's the difference though,
when I have a parallel grip,
right?
So if you all,

2125
02:10:08.861 --> 02:10:10.270
if you're like,
I can pull fuck that,

2126
02:10:10.690 --> 02:10:14.080
I can do bet rows of the barbell with 225 pounds and whatever,

2127
02:10:14.081 --> 02:10:16.090
and you think that you're the king of pulling.

2128
02:10:16.270 --> 02:10:21.270
If you don't do a lot of parallel grip work or a fat bar work and then you go to

2129
02:10:21.611 --> 02:10:25.700
a thick rope,
you're in for a surprise surprise.

2130
02:10:26.780 --> 02:10:31.000
They maybe we should touch base on the difference real quick between the various

2131
02:10:31.001 --> 02:10:34.010
grips.
Yeah,
please.
Okay.
So

2132
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:38.510
<v 2>guys in,
in terms of GST specific strength,</v>

2133
02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:41.630
if you were doing just pull up work,

2134
02:10:41.660 --> 02:10:46.660
your parallel grip is by far by far going to have the greatest return on

2135
02:10:46.701 --> 02:10:50.000
investment,
uh,
simply because that parallel grip,

2136
02:10:50.430 --> 02:10:53.600
it's the brachy Alice.
So hard down in the elbow.

2137
02:10:54.030 --> 02:10:56.450
The reason we need that is when you climb a rope,

2138
02:10:56.480 --> 02:10:59.960
you're going to have more of a parallel grip.
You do that parallel Grep pull up.

2139
02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:04.550
Obviously you're developing that when we're on the rings were on top of the

2140
02:11:04.551 --> 02:11:05.630
range,
right?
Cause we always,
every,

2141
02:11:05.631 --> 02:11:10.550
everything is aimed for eventually getting under the rings to build strength.

2142
02:11:11.090 --> 02:11:15.320
So when you're on the rings,
we need the grip turned out past parallel.

2143
02:11:15.380 --> 02:11:19.630
Now back in the day,
Greg Glassman and I,
Greg is the,
you know,

2144
02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:21.890
he's super bright guy,
founder across fit,

2145
02:11:22.250 --> 02:11:26.480
but he just didn't understand why we would turn the rings pass parallel.

2146
02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:29.870
He thought it was just the aesthetics coach.
It's just aesthetics.
Well,

2147
02:11:29.871 --> 02:11:33.770
the problem is if I'm on the rings and I do a dip,
I do a muscle up,

2148
02:11:33.771 --> 02:11:34.790
I do whatever,

2149
02:11:35.090 --> 02:11:39.230
and I straighten my arms and I don't turn the rings past parallel.
Nope.

2150
02:11:39.710 --> 02:11:42.860
I apologize for interrupting just for people to visualize this.

2151
02:11:43.130 --> 02:11:47.510
So let's just say you're on tips.
You're in between the straps,
your,
I'm sorry,

2152
02:11:47.511 --> 02:11:47.660
you're,

2153
02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:52.310
you're up on rings and you're doing dips and you're in between the straps.

2154
02:11:52.311 --> 02:11:55.490
What in,
correct me if I'm wrong here coach,
but when you get to the top,

2155
02:11:55.580 --> 02:11:57.340
that means top of the rep onto,

2156
02:11:57.350 --> 02:12:01.190
I'm straight off of the rep and your arms are straight that your,

2157
02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:04.400
the rings are concerned the thumbs out slightly.

2158
02:12:04.820 --> 02:12:09.320
So instead of having the rings parallel pointing straight ahead or turned in,

2159
02:12:09.321 --> 02:12:10.940
which is what most port turned in,

2160
02:12:10.970 --> 02:12:15.670
they would be at say 10:00 PM and 2:00 PM or something like that.
Exactly.

2161
02:12:15.730 --> 02:12:17.990
Then it will vary.
As long as they're out.

2162
02:12:18.290 --> 02:12:20.510
Now they're re the reason is is all straight.

2163
02:12:20.511 --> 02:12:23.060
What's the weak link and straight arm strength is the elbow.

2164
02:12:23.780 --> 02:12:26.710
The weak link is the elbow.
And what a lot of people will do is we,

2165
02:12:26.711 --> 02:12:28.590
we've had people who were taught,
well,

2166
02:12:28.610 --> 02:12:31.670
elbow pain is just part of doing ring strength.
No,
it's not.

2167
02:12:31.671 --> 02:12:35.780
Elbow pain is an indicator that your ring strength is aft up and you need to do

2168
02:12:35.781 --> 02:12:39.380
better programming and it hurts for a reason.

2169
02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:42.500
And I took you off track though just because I wanted people to,

2170
02:12:42.550 --> 02:12:43.700
to visualize the proper thing.

2171
02:12:43.701 --> 02:12:45.770
So you were saying to Greg that when you get to the top,
you know,

2172
02:12:45.771 --> 02:12:48.880
the issue is it's not just aesthetics.
When you get to the top,
not a settings,

2173
02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:53.610
you've got to turn past parallels so that the brachy Alice is activated.
Right?

2174
02:12:53.630 --> 02:12:57.740
There's a reason that after all these years of crossfit being on reigns and

2175
02:12:57.741 --> 02:13:02.741
doing thousands upon thousands of kipping pull ups and dips and all that stuff,

2176
02:13:03.111 --> 02:13:07.760
that there are no iron crosses unless they are previous gymnast,
right?

2177
02:13:07.761 --> 02:13:11.360
There's no homegrown crossfitter who has an iron cross,

2178
02:13:11.550 --> 02:13:16.550
snow home fit homegrown crossfitter who has a plant or a malt because right from

2179
02:13:17.151 --> 02:13:20.960
the beginning and those very basic movements,
they didn't turn pass parallel.

2180
02:13:20.961 --> 02:13:24.170
They didn't turn the rings out.
The brachy Alice wasn't trained.

2181
02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:27.440
The brachy owls is what supports the elbow when it's straight.

2182
02:13:28.490 --> 02:13:30.110
So if it never got trained,

2183
02:13:30.170 --> 02:13:33.090
they can never move forward into the money making exercises.

2184
02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:35.790
So that's why in those parallel,
those pull ups,

2185
02:13:35.791 --> 02:13:38.670
if we use a parallel grip and it's easy enough to do something,

2186
02:13:38.671 --> 02:13:41.940
just just do a set right,
do a nice parallel,

2187
02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:47.010
a nice parallel grip workout and then compare the soreness that you feel on the

2188
02:13:47.011 --> 02:13:49.530
inside of the elbow from fatigue,
right.

2189
02:13:49.650 --> 02:13:54.510
Compared to regular chin ups and regular pullups it's night and day then then we

2190
02:13:54.511 --> 02:13:57.750
would do chins and then pull ups.
Got It.

2191
02:13:58.130 --> 02:14:01.210
But so the,
the um,

2192
02:14:03.210 --> 02:14:05.460
other exercises to remove,
if any.

2193
02:14:05.461 --> 02:14:09.870
So we have muscle ups back lever down and he's the love back lever.

2194
02:14:09.950 --> 02:14:14.280
And you would add to that list,
you know,
and this,

2195
02:14:14.281 --> 02:14:17.190
this one is a little unfortunate.
It's a,

2196
02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:22.640
and I don't know that it's so much of a removing has a deep prioritizing.

2197
02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:29.220
Yeah.
A cautionary tale.
So it takes,

2198
02:14:29.221 --> 02:14:33.690
it takes time to rebuild connective tissue and it's connective tissue right

2199
02:14:33.691 --> 02:14:34.830
through the,
through the ligaments.

2200
02:14:34.831 --> 02:14:38.790
And the joints that generate power through the body when they're doing

2201
02:14:38.791 --> 02:14:41.920
plyometric work.
So there,

2202
02:14:42.010 --> 02:14:47.010
there was a rash of Achilles ruptures when there was a couplet done of hot.

2203
02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:51.360
So they were doing deads I believe with 225 pounds.

2204
02:14:52.140 --> 02:14:54.480
And then that was coupled with box jumps

2205
02:14:56.370 --> 02:14:59.130
and they were doing that for rounds.
Okay.
And,
and there's,

2206
02:14:59.131 --> 02:15:01.920
there's not a problem with either one of those in isolation.

2207
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:07.230
The problem came when he was in a competitive environment with most of the

2208
02:15:07.231 --> 02:15:07.891
adults.
Right.

2209
02:15:07.891 --> 02:15:10.970
We're in there their later twenties and their thirties you know that the,
the,

2210
02:15:10.971 --> 02:15:14.520
the typical people who are working out and because it's a race,

2211
02:15:14.521 --> 02:15:18.540
the box jumps turned into jumping down also,

2212
02:15:18.541 --> 02:15:20.610
which turned into rebounding,

2213
02:15:20.611 --> 02:15:24.750
apply a metric off the floor cause I got to get these done right.
I'm in a race.

2214
02:15:25.140 --> 02:15:26.700
So they had pre fatigue,

2215
02:15:26.701 --> 02:15:30.930
the Achilles with the deadlift and then when into the plyometric of the box
jump.

2216
02:15:32.070 --> 02:15:35.460
Nothing wrong with either one of them,
but in combination it took some people,

2217
02:15:35.461 --> 02:15:40.350
I think they had,
there were like nine ruptures that year of which is,
you know,

2218
02:15:40.351 --> 02:15:44.160
one okay.
It happens.
Right?
Yvonne cough had it,
had his achilles,

2219
02:15:44.161 --> 02:15:48.520
he was one of the leading guys were looking to from a Russia,
Yvonne,

2220
02:15:48.550 --> 02:15:51.570
Yvonne cough,
former world champ who uh,
he was,

2221
02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:56.050
he was the top guy that was favored to win the gold at the 96 games cause it

2222
02:15:56.051 --> 02:15:58.260
killed these pop to walking across the parking lot.

2223
02:15:58.530 --> 02:16:01.710
Now is it because walking across the parking lot is a dangerous thing and we

2224
02:16:01.711 --> 02:16:03.900
should all avoid parking lots?
No,

2225
02:16:04.090 --> 02:16:08.250
it just happened to be the last straw and it had been damaged prior to that,

2226
02:16:08.430 --> 02:16:11.610
which I,
long story short,
you went back to the front split series.

2227
02:16:11.970 --> 02:16:16.470
That is the very reason that there is that high rep calf work there to promote

2228
02:16:16.471 --> 02:16:20.250
Achilles' hell because there is connective tissue,

2229
02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:24.870
the tendons and that do not have their own blood supply.
Okay.

2230
02:16:24.871 --> 02:16:27.160
So they get fed,
they heal,

2231
02:16:27.161 --> 02:16:31.150
they strengthen through muscles moving around them and gravity.

2232
02:16:31.151 --> 02:16:34.480
That's what flushes the area.
So if we only do very high,

2233
02:16:34.690 --> 02:16:36.370
high intensity low rep work,

2234
02:16:36.460 --> 02:16:39.220
there's not enough blood flow for them to be healthy.
And this,

2235
02:16:39.221 --> 02:16:44.100
this isn't mine room.
A friend of the Bulgarian Olympic coach for,
um,

2236
02:16:44.140 --> 02:16:48.190
the seventies and eighties is a good friend of mine and genius genius at

2237
02:16:48.191 --> 02:16:50.430
programming room.
And it makes me look like a,
uh,

2238
02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:53.650
tottering idiot who she'd be sat in a corner and no one talked to me.

2239
02:16:54.550 --> 02:16:58.210
What's his name?
I can never pronounce Rumens last name.

2240
02:16:58.211 --> 02:17:01.180
You guys can can look them up.
Go Gary and Olympic coach for the women.

2241
02:17:01.210 --> 02:17:05.060
Seventies and eighties.
Our Room,
and I want to say our bastardized,

2242
02:17:05.061 --> 02:17:09.940
a American spelling is a r u,
m I n or m,
a n,

2243
02:17:10.270 --> 02:17:14.530
uh,
sadly room and had a,
a really heavy accent.

2244
02:17:14.890 --> 02:17:17.020
So a lot of the American coaches,
you know,
they,

2245
02:17:17.021 --> 02:17:19.630
they didn't want to take the time to talk to them,
but you know,

2246
02:17:19.650 --> 02:17:22.990
I was a linguist in the military way back when.
So accidents not as good as you,

2247
02:17:22.991 --> 02:17:25.540
Tim.
But accidents don't bother me.
So I would,

2248
02:17:25.570 --> 02:17:27.490
I would just pinned it and he was older gentleman.

2249
02:17:27.730 --> 02:17:31.720
I would keep this guy up late so many days or how he be Chris,

2250
02:17:31.721 --> 02:17:34.210
I gotta go get some say hi.
It's okay.
Just one more question.

2251
02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:37.150
Just one more question.
Just one more.
So our,

2252
02:17:37.151 --> 02:17:40.210
our knee series that we do came from Roman.
Uh,

2253
02:17:40.240 --> 02:17:44.470
the one now that I've been doing that's the skiers directly from Reuben.

2254
02:17:45.670 --> 02:17:50.500
He,
he saw Alan when he was eight and Alan was incredibly powerful at eight years

2255
02:17:50.501 --> 02:17:53.200
old.
It's just unreal.
And uh,

2256
02:17:53.230 --> 02:17:56.650
he was getting too powerful for his frame at that age.
You know,
about a,

2257
02:17:56.651 --> 02:18:01.651
we're starting to hit a preliminary growth spurt and a roommate gave me that

2258
02:18:01.871 --> 02:18:05.860
knee series and it was about a week,
week and a half.

2259
02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:07.600
He knows knees weren't hurting.

2260
02:18:07.601 --> 02:18:11.110
They were starting to get slightly uncomfortable room and showed us that boom,

2261
02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:14.950
Nia,
she was gone.
Never,
never,
never again,
nothing with niece ever.

2262
02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:20.100
<v 4>Wow.
So I have,
uh,
we,
we could talk for hours and hours more.
Uh,
but I,</v>

2263
02:18:20.101 --> 02:18:23.820
I want to be respectful of your time and we can always do around two sometime if

2264
02:18:24.030 --> 02:18:28.920
you have the,
the,
uh,
the willingness and a,
if the audience wants,

2265
02:18:28.950 --> 02:18:29.551
wants more.

2266
02:18:29.551 --> 02:18:33.390
But I do have a couple of questions before I get into some of my usual rapid

2267
02:18:33.391 --> 02:18:36.660
fire that I'd love to ask him.
Do you have,
do you still have some time to chat?

2268
02:18:36.820 --> 02:18:41.290
<v 2>Um,
I,
I'm you,
you've opened a can of worms.
I'll talk training all night.</v>

2269
02:18:41.370 --> 02:18:46.350
<v 4>All right,
here we,
here we go.
Then the next question is,
uh,</v>

2270
02:18:46.390 --> 02:18:48.950
from one of my listeners and it's,

2271
02:18:48.951 --> 02:18:53.800
it's quite simply how do you mentally prep your athletes for big competition?
Uh,

2272
02:18:54.460 --> 02:18:58.810
when the,
when you're down to that beauty,
you go to the nationals where any,

2273
02:18:58.811 --> 02:19:01.450
any competition,
but specifically big competitions.

2274
02:19:01.451 --> 02:19:04.210
How do you and bye bye prep.

2275
02:19:04.211 --> 02:19:07.150
I mean mentally prep like the day of.

2276
02:19:07.390 --> 02:19:10.780
Is there anything in particular that you do?
It's,
it's,
it's very,

2277
02:19:10.781 --> 02:19:14.860
it's a very different,
um,
it kind of,
so

2278
02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:18.220
it starts with repetition.

2279
02:19:19.820 --> 02:19:22.220
<v 2>So we,
we talked a little bit about training,
so,
and in,</v>

2280
02:19:22.221 --> 02:19:24.890
in a nutshell and what we'll come back around and we'll fill this out.

2281
02:19:24.980 --> 02:19:29.750
So in the preparation prior,
right?
Successful repetitions,

2282
02:19:30.860 --> 02:19:31.210
right?

2283
02:19:31.210 --> 02:19:36.140
It takes a certain number of repetitions to lead to competence and its

2284
02:19:36.141 --> 02:19:38.510
competence that leads to confidence.

2285
02:19:38.780 --> 02:19:41.900
And that's what leads to a successful competition.

2286
02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:45.350
So as Americans,
right,

2287
02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:49.570
we tend to be in a rush,
be in a hurry.
We,

2288
02:19:49.770 --> 02:19:52.220
we don't want to take a lot of Reps.

2289
02:19:52.221 --> 02:19:56.840
We want to get something we do at correct a few times and then we want a bump on

2290
02:19:57.230 --> 02:19:59.330
completely different from the Chinese approach.

2291
02:19:59.331 --> 02:20:02.720
Completely different from the Russian approach where they'll literally do

2292
02:20:02.930 --> 02:20:07.630
hundreds of repetitions before they move on to the next drill and then they're,

2293
02:20:07.650 --> 02:20:11.750
they're not upset about it because I understand it's a process.
As Americans,

2294
02:20:11.780 --> 02:20:13.940
we tend to,
we're always look now answer.

2295
02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.100
It's both a good thing and it's a curse one.

2296
02:20:16.101 --> 02:20:20.720
It's a good thing because it forces us to be so creative.
We're so hard charging,

2297
02:20:20.721 --> 02:20:23.450
we get so many things done physically.

2298
02:20:23.451 --> 02:20:27.890
Sometimes it kind of works against us because we don't give the body and the

2299
02:20:27.891 --> 02:20:29.900
nervous system a chance to stabilize.

2300
02:20:30.650 --> 02:20:34.850
So if you want to be confident at a competition,

2301
02:20:35.150 --> 02:20:37.880
you have to pay your dues and prep example.

2302
02:20:37.881 --> 02:20:42.680
And that's mentally and physically.
For example,
72 Olympics.

2303
02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:46.340
Okay.
And these are,
I was talking with about this with Dimitri billows,
her chat,

2304
02:20:46.341 --> 02:20:49.580
my friend world and Olympic champ.
So in [inaudible] 72 Olympics,

2305
02:20:49.610 --> 02:20:54.610
Olga Corbett was by all accounts going to crush everyone at the games.

2306
02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:02.180
She was going to crush everyone in training as they went back and the Russians

2307
02:21:02.181 --> 02:21:04.010
went back and they reviewed all her training.

2308
02:21:04.011 --> 02:21:07.880
She had over a 98% hit rate on her routines.

2309
02:21:07.880 --> 02:21:11.330
That meant she was almost perfect,
almost perfect.

2310
02:21:12.050 --> 02:21:15.470
When she went to the Games,
she had a major meltdown.

2311
02:21:16.130 --> 02:21:17.720
Now the question of course raises,

2312
02:21:17.870 --> 02:21:22.870
how is it possible for someone who was this perfect for this long in training to

2313
02:21:23.241 --> 02:21:26.090
go to the competition and just fall apart?

2314
02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:31.550
As they dug into it,
they found out the error was not in physical preparation.

2315
02:21:31.551 --> 02:21:36.350
The error was in mental preparation,
so as Olga was cranking at home,

2316
02:21:36.920 --> 02:21:41.510
she was the one who decided when to go.
Coach waited on her,

2317
02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:44.090
judges waited on her,
everything was structured around her.

2318
02:21:44.091 --> 02:21:46.070
She was very comfortable.
Okay.

2319
02:21:46.071 --> 02:21:49.850
She didn't start till she was ready should equipments.
She's ready for lighting.

2320
02:21:49.851 --> 02:21:52.250
She's ready for magnums.
Familiar.
Everything is good.

2321
02:21:52.940 --> 02:21:55.670
When you get to the worlds and you get to the Olympics,

2322
02:21:56.080 --> 02:21:59.540
the judges don't give a fuck if you're ready or not when they raise that flag.

2323
02:21:59.840 --> 02:22:04.670
Yeah,
it's,
it's brutal.
It's brutal.
In fact,
to give everyone a little taste,

2324
02:22:05.460 --> 02:22:08.180
okay.
The warmup,
Jim is not there.

2325
02:22:08.780 --> 02:22:13.780
The warmup Jim might be 10 minutes away or it might be a 10 minute while I have

2326
02:22:14.091 --> 02:22:17.240
five minute walk down this concrete hallway.
So you go and you warm up,

2327
02:22:17.241 --> 02:22:19.160
you walk down this hallway,
right?

2328
02:22:19.161 --> 02:22:23.780
And then your ass weights there and then at the flag goes up and you got to go

2329
02:22:23.781 --> 02:22:27.900
to 100% within seconds,
you got 30 seconds to be on the equipment.

2330
02:22:28.440 --> 02:22:31.020
Massive head.
Yeah.
Massive head game.

2331
02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:34.800
So they went back and they found out that old cause problem was that everything

2332
02:22:34.801 --> 02:22:39.260
had gone her way.
She controlled too many variables,
too many variables.
And it,

2333
02:22:39.261 --> 02:22:42.060
there was,
they were too easy.
They were to accommodating.

2334
02:22:42.180 --> 02:22:46.050
And so what they did is the Russians changed their training just to screw with

2335
02:22:46.051 --> 02:22:48.450
people.
So if I'm coaching someone right and it's going,

2336
02:22:48.451 --> 02:22:52.140
there's going to be a mental component.
I'm going to fuck with them,
right.

2337
02:22:52.141 --> 02:22:55.530
I'm going to tell him and not,
not in a mean way,
but all right,

2338
02:22:55.531 --> 02:22:59.730
you're up and then walk away.
They will wait.
And you know,
let him,

2339
02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:03.570
let him get antsy.
Make them go when they're not ready.
Make them do a cold set.

2340
02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:06.710
Okay?
Don't,
don't let any,
any and everything.

2341
02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:10.980
You can have a crowd of people around them trying to mess with them any and

2342
02:23:10.981 --> 02:23:13.320
everything.
And I,
and I will also say it's,

2343
02:23:13.380 --> 02:23:18.380
it's much harder for women than it is for guys simply because women are more

2344
02:23:20.041 --> 02:23:21.420
caring and nurturing than guys.

2345
02:23:21.510 --> 02:23:24.810
Guy Goes out to compete and he's worried about one thing he's worried about

2346
02:23:24.811 --> 02:23:26.580
kicking ass.
Okay.

2347
02:23:26.730 --> 02:23:29.280
The girl goes out there and she's worried about kicking ass also,

2348
02:23:29.370 --> 02:23:32.880
but she's also worried about not wanting to let anybody down.

2349
02:23:33.970 --> 02:23:36.000
Are they going to be disappointed with me?
Are they going to like me?

2350
02:23:36.001 --> 02:23:39.930
She has this whole range of other emotional burdens that a guy doesn't give a

2351
02:23:39.931 --> 02:23:42.150
shit about.
They didn't just don't care.

2352
02:23:42.151 --> 02:23:46.910
I've seen girls who are just amazing and training and get out there and it's

2353
02:23:46.911 --> 02:23:50.820
just cause they have this other load that they place on themselves at guys don't

2354
02:23:50.821 --> 02:23:51.654
have to deal with.

2355
02:23:51.900 --> 02:23:56.580
And the way you handled that and training is we just have to get more reps in a,

2356
02:23:56.650 --> 02:24:00.150
you gotta have more reps and do everything you can to put them in a situation to

2357
02:24:00.151 --> 02:24:02.280
where,
for example,

2358
02:24:02.910 --> 02:24:06.540
2004 I was doing some of the prep,

2359
02:24:06.541 --> 02:24:11.490
I was doing some of the floor and the tramp and helping with vault and doing the

2360
02:24:11.491 --> 02:24:14.580
physical preparation for a girl we had trying out for the Olympics.

2361
02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:19.050
She did not make it done.
I mean,
you had to be top six.
She was ninth.
Okay.

2362
02:24:19.380 --> 02:24:23.670
And Carly,
fantastic girl.
Great girl.
They,
uh,

2363
02:24:24.030 --> 02:24:27.270
their approach though for mental training,
I thought was flawed.

2364
02:24:27.390 --> 02:24:30.120
They brought someone in and you know,
I won't,
I won't say names,
I'll just say,

2365
02:24:30.121 --> 02:24:32.280
I'll just say that disagreed.
And it was,
it was a very,

2366
02:24:32.400 --> 02:24:35.100
they're trying to be really,
really positive.
So,
you know,

2367
02:24:35.101 --> 02:24:39.060
30,000 square footage and big giant yes.
Signs everywhere.
Yes,
you can.
Yes,

2368
02:24:39.061 --> 02:24:40.740
it will be great.
Yes,
that'd be wonderful.

2369
02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:45.480
And the reality is it's not going to be wonderful.
It's going to be stressful.

2370
02:24:45.481 --> 02:24:49.830
It's going to suck.
When you are in a competition at that level,

2371
02:24:49.860 --> 02:24:53.560
the pressure is,
is crushing it.

2372
02:24:53.570 --> 02:24:57.420
It's a physical pressure that you feel on you and you still have to produce

2373
02:24:58.140 --> 02:25:00.150
performance at a world class level.

2374
02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:05.280
And the only way to handle that as we have to try to replicate that in training,

2375
02:25:05.730 --> 02:25:07.680
right.
So that the pressure's not going away.

2376
02:25:07.681 --> 02:25:10.710
The air that was known at Carly was trying to downplay the pressure.

2377
02:25:10.740 --> 02:25:13.980
I would say do the exact opposite.
Do the opposite.

2378
02:25:13.981 --> 02:25:18.750
You should go to the training to the competition and hopefully competition is

2379
02:25:18.900 --> 02:25:22.000
less pressure than what you go through and training now.

2380
02:25:22.001 --> 02:25:24.010
And that's not going to be true at and such.
But at

2381
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:27.850
<v 4>most things,
it should be,
the case shouldn't be the case.</v>

2382
02:25:27.851 --> 02:25:29.140
So mentally,

2383
02:25:30.980 --> 02:25:31.700
<v 5>okay.</v>

2384
02:25:31.700 --> 02:25:35.500
<v 4>No,
if you're scared,
oh,
let's,
let's say if you're feeling unconfident,</v>

2385
02:25:35.501 --> 02:25:39.110
if you're feeling threatened,
uneasy,

2386
02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.320
your preparation was flawed.
Well that's,

2387
02:25:42.410 --> 02:25:45.470
it brings up an anecdote that I heard from,
uh,

2388
02:25:45.650 --> 02:25:47.630
Paul Levesque better known as triple h,

2389
02:25:47.631 --> 02:25:50.900
the professional wrestler who's also an incredible,
uh,

2390
02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:54.980
business executive for WWE,
but he visited,

2391
02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:00.380
uh,
let me get this right.
Why am I blanking on his name?
I've caught whatever you,

2392
02:26:00.440 --> 02:26:05.120
you,
you were,
you were dealing with earlier.
Uh,
not Roy Jones,

2393
02:26:05.180 --> 02:26:08.390
very famous boxer,
a Floyd Mayweather.
That's it.

2394
02:26:08.990 --> 02:26:12.210
And he visited Floyd,
uh,

2395
02:26:12.500 --> 02:26:17.240
maybe an hour before a huge title fight for a championship belt or to retain his

2396
02:26:17.241 --> 02:26:22.040
belt.
And at one point Paul said,

2397
02:26:22.041 --> 02:26:24.890
you know,
I'm going to leave.
I don't want to interrupt your prep.
And he goes,

2398
02:26:24.891 --> 02:26:28.220
why would you interrupt me,
interrupt my prep?
He goes,
if I'm not ready now,

2399
02:26:28.280 --> 02:26:32.610
nothing I do between in the next 60 minutes,
it's going to make me ready.
He said,

2400
02:26:33.180 --> 02:26:35.770
I love that attitude.
Yeah.
Feel free to hang out.
He's just walking,

2401
02:26:35.771 --> 02:26:39.260
you're watching basketball or something.
And,
uh,
it also,

2402
02:26:39.530 --> 02:26:43.790
you brought up the,
uh,
this seal team,
six members and so on earlier.
I mean,

2403
02:26:43.791 --> 02:26:46.490
that's a,
I think a great example of a parallel track,
right?

2404
02:26:46.491 --> 02:26:51.290
In the sense that they very much want to sweat more,
in some cases,

2405
02:26:51.291 --> 02:26:56.291
bleed more in training so that they can avoid dying in real battle.

2406
02:26:56.921 --> 02:27:00.740
So the simulations are extremely brutal.
Uh,

2407
02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:05.330
and intended to be a sort of along the lines of on,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm not,

2408
02:27:06.020 --> 02:27:09.770
not really up on my ancient name pronunciation,

2409
02:27:09.771 --> 02:27:12.140
but I think it's archaea locusts,
uh,
who said,

2410
02:27:12.141 --> 02:27:15.590
we do not rise to the level of our hopes.
We fall to the level of our training.

2411
02:27:16.220 --> 02:27:17.460
Um,
perfect.

2412
02:27:17.690 --> 02:27:22.020
So making the conditions equivalent of perfect side,
my,

2413
02:27:22.100 --> 02:27:26.320
my buddy would tell he they are so well trained,
no stress,
how,

2414
02:27:26.390 --> 02:27:31.100
how in the world you can be in 145 gun fights and not feel stressed when you're

2415
02:27:31.101 --> 02:27:35.100
heading out to another one.
He just,
yeah,
fall asleep on the helicopter.
You know,

2416
02:27:35.300 --> 02:27:39.530
I'll do my thing and get back on.
And I was seriously,
he was like,
oh yeah,
I mean,

2417
02:27:39.531 --> 02:27:43.790
Gosh,
and just,
just another day in the office.
I,
holy moly.
So,
uh,
so on the day,

2418
02:27:43.970 --> 02:27:48.650
on the day of assuming you've done the requisite preparation,
you've,

2419
02:27:49.130 --> 02:27:53.570
you've,
you've conditioned them to perform well under stressful circumstances,

2420
02:27:55.490 --> 02:27:59.720
any type of change,
change,
change,
nothing changed,
nothing changed,

2421
02:27:59.721 --> 02:28:04.310
nothing for where people fail.
Okay?
So this,

2422
02:28:04.311 --> 02:28:06.230
this is the end.
This is this an important lesson,

2423
02:28:06.231 --> 02:28:08.810
not just in competing but in everything.

2424
02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:14.680
So a lot of people psych themselves out of doing as well as they could have by

2425
02:28:15.171 --> 02:28:18.050
prematurely comparing themselves to the people around them

2426
02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:22.040
instead of just out,
take

2427
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:26.990
<v 2>care of your business,
do your best,
and see where it falls,
right?</v>

2428
02:28:26.991 --> 02:28:31.310
If,
if you're going up against the best who's ever been born,
right?
You're not,

2429
02:28:31.311 --> 02:28:33.170
you're not going to beat them.
There's not going to be a miracle.

2430
02:28:33.171 --> 02:28:34.310
This guy's not going to open,

2431
02:28:34.311 --> 02:28:38.480
guys not going to reach down and bless you with extra athletic ability and
y'all,

2432
02:28:38.550 --> 02:28:43.190
this is not going to happen.
So you just,
you just ignore that,
you know,

2433
02:28:43.191 --> 02:28:46.640
you go out and you just stay in your own head and do your thing.
Now,

2434
02:28:46.641 --> 02:28:50.820
psychologically,
people handle it differently.
Some people.
I know we had,

2435
02:28:50.860 --> 02:28:53.960
we had the same,
the same chemistry on Olympic teams.

2436
02:28:54.260 --> 02:28:58.520
Some people like to be left alone,
you know,
let,
let me go do my thing.
You know,

2437
02:28:58.530 --> 02:29:01.250
they'll come together for the team,
but then when they're prepping for their set,

2438
02:29:01.251 --> 02:29:02.570
you know,
they got to go off on their self.

2439
02:29:03.110 --> 02:29:06.380
There's other guys where they feed off that interaction,
right?

2440
02:29:06.381 --> 02:29:10.160
They want people coming around and getting them pumped up and then there's all

2441
02:29:10.161 --> 02:29:13.820
in between.
None of them are right and none of them are wrong.

2442
02:29:13.970 --> 02:29:17.960
It just is what it is and it's important to just deal with who you are.

2443
02:29:18.230 --> 02:29:20.030
St Same and training.
Right.

2444
02:29:20.031 --> 02:29:24.040
There are some people who thrive on multiple training per day,
right.

2445
02:29:24.050 --> 02:29:26.030
And they just blossom.
They do awesome.

2446
02:29:26.330 --> 02:29:29.810
There's other people who have to train just a few times a week.

2447
02:29:30.860 --> 02:29:34.130
It doesn't matter.
There's been Olympic champions who trained both ways.

2448
02:29:34.430 --> 02:29:37.370
It just depends on what your body does best with.

2449
02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:42.160
<v 4>If,
if you were sending a,</v>

2450
02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:46.090
I'm very curious to hear the answer to this.
This was from a,
I think it was,

2451
02:29:46.210 --> 02:29:49.170
it might've been a mother.
I think it was a father who said,
uh,

2452
02:29:49.300 --> 02:29:54.300
what questions would coach summer ask a gymnastic coach at the,

2453
02:29:56.021 --> 02:29:56.490
you know,

2454
02:29:56.490 --> 02:30:01.120
fee a nearby facility before sending his own five to 10 year old off to train

2455
02:30:01.121 --> 02:30:05.170
with them.
Yeah.
And I went through that.
So I didn't,
I didn't coach my daughter,

2456
02:30:05.440 --> 02:30:08.830
I didn't coach my daughter.
I want it to be dad and uh,

2457
02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:12.160
<v 2>yeah.
And I'll,
I I didn't get involved with it.</v>

2458
02:30:12.170 --> 02:30:16.610
Were there things I would have done very differently?
Yes.
But uh,

2459
02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:20.660
her happiness in the process was more important to me than her 6,000.

2460
02:30:20.661 --> 02:30:24.560
She was state champion but that was more important to me then stepping in and

2461
02:30:24.561 --> 02:30:28.510
making sure everything was worldclass Lao,
I didn't want to go there.
Um,

2462
02:30:28.670 --> 02:30:32.300
first thing I would do if I'm reviewing someone cause everyone,

2463
02:30:32.301 --> 02:30:36.200
have you noticed that if we look at the bell curve is reality,
right?

2464
02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:37.820
The bell curve shows that there are,

2465
02:30:37.821 --> 02:30:40.040
there is a huge majority of people who are average.

2466
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:42.890
There's too few are at the top and there are a few are at the bottom.

2467
02:30:43.280 --> 02:30:47.210
But if you talk to someone,
you've never met anyone who says,
yeah,

2468
02:30:47.211 --> 02:30:51.560
I'm in the middle of the bell curve.
Every fucker you talked to his exceptional,

2469
02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:53.300
every single person,
right?

2470
02:30:53.360 --> 02:30:56.210
Every person has another millionaire in the making there or another,

2471
02:30:56.211 --> 02:31:00.260
they're going to win the voice.
They got academy award.
It's common.
Nobody says,

2472
02:31:00.261 --> 02:31:03.200
yeah,
I'm average.
And it's the same thing with gyms.

2473
02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:06.440
So first thing I would do is look at competitive record.

2474
02:31:06.890 --> 02:31:10.100
How have they done and at what level have they been successful?

2475
02:31:10.101 --> 02:31:13.010
So are they successful at a local level,
at a state level?

2476
02:31:13.310 --> 02:31:15.200
How have they done in terms of regionals?

2477
02:31:15.201 --> 02:31:19.230
How have they done in terms of nationals a,
are they on national team?

2478
02:31:19.231 --> 02:31:23.070
How consistently have they been on national team as a year in,
year out?

2479
02:31:23.370 --> 02:31:26.490
Was it a onetime deal?
After I look at that,

2480
02:31:26.790 --> 02:31:29.760
the very next thing I'm going to look at it,
I'm going to look at injury rates.

2481
02:31:30.750 --> 02:31:33.870
You know,
how how healthy and successful are these athletes?

2482
02:31:34.020 --> 02:31:38.130
How would you find that data?
Or would you just ask them point blank?
Well,

2483
02:31:38.230 --> 02:31:42.390
well there if,
if they're,
if they're a worldclass coach,

2484
02:31:43.320 --> 02:31:44.910
they're always going to be straight with you.

2485
02:31:45.210 --> 02:31:49.200
The only people in my experience who talk shit or the wannabes

2486
02:31:51.570 --> 02:31:54.600
in everything that I've in everything I had.

2487
02:31:54.630 --> 02:31:57.320
So 2003 uh,
yeah,

2488
02:31:57.321 --> 02:32:02.321
it's 2003 I'm at a training camp and Paul Hom has just won the world

2489
02:32:02.551 --> 02:32:06.850
championships.
He's just won worlds.
And Alan is a little guy who are,

2490
02:32:06.851 --> 02:32:11.851
were at a training camp and in Paul's coach Stacy Malani is there and we're,

2491
02:32:12.421 --> 02:32:16.530
we're at a technical meeting and it's on round off on round offs of all things.

2492
02:32:16.560 --> 02:32:19.860
And so Stacey comes and he sits down next to me.
He says,
Chris,

2493
02:32:19.930 --> 02:32:22.740
what do you think about this?
Now in my head I'm thinking,

2494
02:32:23.160 --> 02:32:26.790
who gives a fuck what I think about this?
You just won world championships.

2495
02:32:27.090 --> 02:32:30.600
I want to know what you think about this.
But he asked my opinion.

2496
02:32:30.690 --> 02:32:33.270
I don't say I'm not going to be rooted Stacy,
but in my head I'm thinking that.

2497
02:32:33.510 --> 02:32:36.420
So we talk about it for a little bit and then Stacy gets up and he goes around

2498
02:32:36.421 --> 02:32:40.170
the room visiting with other coaches that he respect and you wants their opinion

2499
02:32:40.171 --> 02:32:44.310
and then he,
he makes his own opinion that a print out,
he had just won world.

2500
02:32:44.311 --> 02:32:47.700
So it had been so easy for him to be kind of aloof and snooty and arrogant.

2501
02:32:47.701 --> 02:32:48.810
You know,
I'm this and that.

2502
02:32:49.350 --> 02:32:52.950
But the point is that that's the reason that Casey,

2503
02:32:53.010 --> 02:32:54.780
that Stacy one worlds,

2504
02:32:55.080 --> 02:32:58.800
that he was a coach of that caliber because he was always open to learning more.

2505
02:32:58.920 --> 02:33:02.490
He never said,
I know everything.
Right.
And like you said,

2506
02:33:02.491 --> 02:33:03.970
I've never met an exception.
It's,

2507
02:33:04.170 --> 02:33:08.700
it's the ones who aren't at a high level who think,
you know,
I know everything.

2508
02:33:08.760 --> 02:33:13.690
There's nothing left to be learned and it's just not the case.
So I would,

2509
02:33:13.691 --> 02:33:16.170
I would check that chuck around Y'all talk to people,

2510
02:33:16.410 --> 02:33:20.940
watch the athletes and training,
you know,
they'll go and watch some workouts.

2511
02:33:20.941 --> 02:33:24.900
How does the coach handle it?
Is there a lot of tears now?
If it's,
if it's,

2512
02:33:24.901 --> 02:33:29.130
if it's a guy and there's tears in the work and he's got a broken leg,
right?

2513
02:33:29.820 --> 02:33:33.000
The first deaf and girl and girls,
you know,
girls are girls.
I,
I live in,
uh,

2514
02:33:33.150 --> 02:33:36.450
I've got two daughters,
a wife,
even my dog is female.
There's,

2515
02:33:36.451 --> 02:33:40.860
there's tiers here constantly.
This is part of being female.

2516
02:33:41.300 --> 02:33:43.350
So if it's an occasional tier,
no big deal.

2517
02:33:43.351 --> 02:33:47.220
But if there's a lot of crying all the time there a problem,
I'd,

2518
02:33:47.221 --> 02:33:50.070
I'd moved down the road.
But if,
if they're happy now,
doesn't

2519
02:33:53.790 --> 02:33:57.090
healthy doesn't mean a free for all.

2520
02:33:57.480 --> 02:34:01.920
Healthy and happy doesn't mean indulging,
you know,
there should be structured,

2521
02:34:01.921 --> 02:34:05.490
there should be accountability,
but it should be pleasant.
You know,
kids,

2522
02:34:05.491 --> 02:34:07.680
kids or any athlete,
adults as well.
Well,

2523
02:34:07.690 --> 02:34:11.370
either live up to the standards you set or they will live down to the standard

2524
02:34:11.371 --> 02:34:14.730
you set.
So I can just kind of go in and try to try to get a feel,
you know,
is,

2525
02:34:14.731 --> 02:34:18.010
is this a place where you are?
Is that the compound petition?
Record

2526
02:34:18.010 --> 02:34:22.390
<v 4>is good.
Is this an environment that I'm content with my child being in?</v>

2527
02:34:23.310 --> 02:34:26.740
You know,
if you get a good feeling.
Okay.
As an adult,

2528
02:34:26.741 --> 02:34:31.570
if you were assessing a gymnastics coach for yourself and you could observe a

2529
02:34:31.571 --> 02:34:36.220
workout,
uh,
let's just say you could only watch the warmup,

2530
02:34:37.030 --> 02:34:38.200
what would excellent,

2531
02:34:38.230 --> 02:34:42.400
what would you look for to be there or not be there?

2532
02:34:42.401 --> 02:34:45.700
Or what would the characteristics be?
Do they,

2533
02:34:45.730 --> 02:34:50.710
do they take the time to warm up the joints or did they jump right into work?

2534
02:34:51.250 --> 02:34:54.520
You know,
do they actually take time to mobilize?

2535
02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:58.630
Are they doing stall bar work?
Are they doing Jefferson curl work?
Are they,

2536
02:34:58.920 --> 02:35:02.010
are they loosen up their rest and their knees and their ankles or anything

2537
02:35:02.020 --> 02:35:03.940
loosening their back before they get gone?

2538
02:35:04.270 --> 02:35:07.810
Are they doing some type of pre strength?

2539
02:35:08.150 --> 02:35:12.850
Are they doing lower level strength elements to get the muscles warm and firing

2540
02:35:12.851 --> 02:35:15.910
before jumping into the hard work?
A lot.

2541
02:35:15.911 --> 02:35:19.840
You can tell a lot from how a program warms up.
No,

2542
02:35:19.841 --> 02:35:22.480
that's why I was asking and a great question.
Yeah,
there's,

2543
02:35:22.481 --> 02:35:27.070
I mean there's a movement that also from an evolutionary standpoint,

2544
02:35:27.071 --> 02:35:30.990
it makes a lot of sense.
Just like we were talking about the biceps and high,

2545
02:35:31.050 --> 02:35:35.970
high capacity for volume,
the QL walks,
which you introduced me to it,

2546
02:35:36.020 --> 02:35:39.310
which if you really want to have people laugh at you,
this is,
uh,
this is,
uh,

2547
02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:43.690
this is a great move to do a,
although you had mentioned,

2548
02:35:43.691 --> 02:35:45.670
and this doesn't surprise me at all,
it's that you've,

2549
02:35:45.671 --> 02:35:48.540
you've seen high level power lifters use it doing this.
That's where,

2550
02:35:48.580 --> 02:35:51.380
that's where I got it.
Yeah.
Holding onto kettlebells,

2551
02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:54.910
kind of with the goblet squat type of grip.
And so what this looks like folks,

2552
02:35:54.911 --> 02:35:57.610
we've already talked about this,
this seated pike position.

2553
02:35:57.610 --> 02:35:59.950
So you're sitting on your ass legs together like straight.

2554
02:36:00.970 --> 02:36:04.660
So basically keeping your legs completely straight.
If there are other,

2555
02:36:04.840 --> 02:36:07.900
if there are other elements,
please let me know.
Coach t technical points.

2556
02:36:07.901 --> 02:36:12.400
But basically you're like walking your ass cheeks,
uh,

2557
02:36:14.040 --> 02:36:18.370
back and back and feel it.
You look like a retard doing a speed walking,

2558
02:36:18.371 --> 02:36:22.120
sitting down.
Yeah.
That's actually,
that's a great description.

2559
02:36:22.150 --> 02:36:27.130
That's exactly what it looks like.
And uh,
you,
uh,
Ql,
uh,

2560
02:36:27.620 --> 02:36:31.780
or I say refers to the quality.
I would screw it up.
Yeah.
Quadratus lumborum yeah.

2561
02:36:31.830 --> 02:36:32.501
Quarters,
Laura,

2562
02:36:32.501 --> 02:36:36.820
which is sort of like the grand central of all sorts of muscles and Fascia in

2563
02:36:36.821 --> 02:36:38.410
the back and uh,

2564
02:36:38.590 --> 02:36:43.300
it's incredible how much that loosens up my entire lower back and hips,

2565
02:36:43.680 --> 02:36:47.050
uh,
doing this very,
very simple QL walk.
But uh,

2566
02:36:47.720 --> 02:36:52.390
I'll pick up guys sometimes three,
four inches.
Oh yeah.
Just,

2567
02:36:52.540 --> 02:36:56.840
just from loosening up from those first.
Yeah.
And the uh,
you know,

2568
02:36:57.400 --> 02:37:02.400
how long should a proper gymnastics warmup take and,

2569
02:37:04.110 --> 02:37:06.850
and one more,
which is warming up the joints.
Other,

2570
02:37:06.940 --> 02:37:11.940
any specific movements that that hit the shoulders from any angle or perspective

2571
02:37:13.780 --> 02:37:16.070
that would see they would indicate a

2572
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:20.930
<v 2>better warmup for gymnastic strength training than others?</v>

2573
02:37:21.810 --> 02:37:26.180
It would depend on duration,
duration of the workout.
So if you're,

2574
02:37:26.181 --> 02:37:29.390
if you're in there for an hour,
yeah,
I'll,
I'll,
I'll preface it,

2575
02:37:29.391 --> 02:37:34.370
say you're in for an hour.
I would say probably 10 to 15 minutes is reasonable.

2576
02:37:35.240 --> 02:37:37.520
Now at the same time,

2577
02:37:37.640 --> 02:37:41.810
if I have significant mobility deficits,

2578
02:37:42.290 --> 02:37:46.610
then perhaps the majority of the workout and needs to be mobility work.

2579
02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:51.890
So a,
it could kind of shift possibly as high as a half hour.

2580
02:37:51.891 --> 02:37:54.830
If I have a multi hour training coming up,
it's,

2581
02:37:54.850 --> 02:37:59.400
it's complicated enough and we've,
we've tried this over the years there,

2582
02:37:59.420 --> 02:38:04.420
there are enough things to address that that should be addressed on a semi

2583
02:38:04.571 --> 02:38:09.571
regular basis that you can't really get everything in to a single warmup.

2584
02:38:10.100 --> 02:38:13.370
So you probably going to have two or three variations.
You know,

2585
02:38:13.371 --> 02:38:14.570
if you're doing an advanced work,

2586
02:38:14.900 --> 02:38:17.990
you're probably going to have two or three variations in order to get to

2587
02:38:17.991 --> 02:38:22.430
everything.
Like for example,
rings,
drank before a good heart during strength.

2588
02:38:22.431 --> 02:38:26.750
It's very nice to do theraband series for the shoulders,
you know,
different,

2589
02:38:27.140 --> 02:38:30.980
different shapes and poles and circles and all these things with their Urbana.

2590
02:38:30.981 --> 02:38:34.790
Really great for warming up the interior of the shoulder on other days.

2591
02:38:34.791 --> 02:38:37.250
Do I need to do that as much for shoulder?
No,

2592
02:38:37.251 --> 02:38:41.230
it might be more weighted shoulder work as appropriate for other days is a

2593
02:38:41.231 --> 02:38:45.950
necessary,
you do all of them at the same time?
Most of the time.

2594
02:38:45.951 --> 02:38:50.480
No.
Uh,
we have one senior student really,
really good.

2595
02:38:50.740 --> 02:38:54.570
Um,
Matt started training with me in his late forties.
Uh,

2596
02:38:54.620 --> 02:38:58.190
he's now 50 to be east press handstands,

2597
02:38:58.191 --> 02:39:02.810
plan judges a front levers,
uh,
at 52 ridiculous shape.

2598
02:39:03.620 --> 02:39:08.060
And he went through a period where just for shoulders to feel better,

2599
02:39:08.180 --> 02:39:10.340
he did every shoulder prep.

2600
02:39:10.341 --> 02:39:15.200
We had all our integrated mobile at our courses are set up very unusually where

2601
02:39:15.201 --> 02:39:18.500
for our introductory courses,
uh,
the students,

2602
02:39:18.510 --> 02:39:23.480
adult students come in alternate an exercise with an integrated mobility because

2603
02:39:23.481 --> 02:39:25.730
we want them 50,
50.
It's,
we found if I,

2604
02:39:25.760 --> 02:39:29.330
if I told people how important stretching was,
they always blew me off.

2605
02:39:29.630 --> 02:39:33.020
But if I required it do a set and before your next set you have to do this

2606
02:39:33.021 --> 02:39:36.230
stretch than back and forth.
And we just had great results.

2607
02:39:36.530 --> 02:39:41.210
So mats is a crazy maniac still.
It's still skateboard still.

2608
02:39:41.220 --> 02:39:46.220
Waterskiis does all does as GST and a shoulder get a little finicky.

2609
02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:50.180
So he just did extra mobility and it just fixed a shoulder right up.

2610
02:39:51.290 --> 02:39:53.630
I was introduced to a,

2611
02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:58.960
an exercise by a masters crossfit competitor actually that really helped with

2612
02:40:03.050 --> 02:40:04.010
shoulder,

2613
02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:09.280
I would say warm up more than mobility but for pressing exercises even in GST,

2614
02:40:10.101 --> 02:40:14.040
including any type of hand balancing or his dad work,
which then you have

2615
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:15.540
<v 3>to have a decent man of grip strength for this.</v>

2616
02:40:15.541 --> 02:40:18.840
But I was very skeptical as skeptical of this,

2617
02:40:18.841 --> 02:40:20.670
even as someone who's done a lot with kettle bells.

2618
02:40:20.671 --> 02:40:24.710
But I've never been a huge fan of the bottoms up work with kettlebells.

2619
02:40:24.720 --> 02:40:28.530
Meaning you're,
it's got it flipped up.
You're gripping it by the handle.

2620
02:40:28.531 --> 02:40:32.580
The fell on top A.
Exactly.
But this,
I was like,
you know what?
Screw it.

2621
02:40:32.700 --> 02:40:35.640
I'll try it with a lightweight.
And I started with say whatever it is,

2622
02:40:35.641 --> 02:40:39.690
might be like 15,
16 pounds and I've,
I've,
I've increased that I'd be,
he's 35 now,

2623
02:40:39.691 --> 02:40:43.110
but it a little bit of chocolate goes a long way here.
But you,
you would,
uh,

2624
02:40:43.170 --> 02:40:48.170
you basically say swing it up to a clean and then press it overhead and then you

2625
02:40:48.661 --> 02:40:50.100
just do rotations,

2626
02:40:50.160 --> 02:40:55.160
some doing like side to side rotations and it's incredible how well that

2627
02:40:56.581 --> 02:41:01.260
activates the smaller musculature eyes and the shoulders.
So wonderful in it.

2628
02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:05.910
Oh it's cool.
We didn't do them with kettle.
We'll do on with a light dumbbells.

2629
02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:10.560
So basically guys will,
what Tim's is driving is just take,
take a Dumbbell,

2630
02:41:10.590 --> 02:41:12.360
push it up,
overhead,
turn,

2631
02:41:12.690 --> 02:41:16.810
turn the thumbs externally rotated just a bed and then just do how it words

2632
02:41:16.820 --> 02:41:21.600
circles and uh,
keep a flat back.
Shoulders open,

2633
02:41:21.690 --> 02:41:25.860
no arching and uh,
doing for time.
One to two minutes.

2634
02:41:26.550 --> 02:41:30.660
How just good gracious,
wonderful,
warm up.
And then,
you know,

2635
02:41:30.661 --> 02:41:33.930
something we didn't address and I'll throw it in just real,
real,
real quick.

2636
02:41:33.931 --> 02:41:36.250
I know,
I know we're running out of time,
but um,

2637
02:41:36.330 --> 02:41:41.330
some people who are experiencing shoulder issues in terms of mobility and on to

2638
02:41:41.341 --> 02:41:43.740
do with the shoulder or necessarily the Bicep,

2639
02:41:43.741 --> 02:41:46.710
but some ninjas cause the lats are so strong and tie.

2640
02:41:47.730 --> 02:41:51.300
And so I have absolutely,
exactly.
I'll a lot of and because,

2641
02:41:51.301 --> 02:41:53.950
and a lot of the lifters to cause those are,
those lats are working on,

2642
02:41:53.970 --> 02:41:57.330
you guys are moving some serious weight and those lats are coursework and,

2643
02:41:57.380 --> 02:42:00.810
and if there's not a corresponding mobility going with it,

2644
02:42:00.811 --> 02:42:04.020
it's real easy for those last to kind of get chronically contracted,

2645
02:42:04.140 --> 02:42:05.220
losing their mobility.

2646
02:42:05.460 --> 02:42:08.670
So a lot of times you get in there and just stretch the heck out of that lot.

2647
02:42:09.060 --> 02:42:13.860
Automatically get relief on the shoulders.
Okay.
Coach,
I got,

2648
02:42:14.040 --> 02:42:18.450
I am going to do a couple of rapid fire than a couple of closing questions and

2649
02:42:18.451 --> 02:42:21.800
then maybe,
uh,
I mean you and I are talking quite a bit these days,
so we'll look,

2650
02:42:21.810 --> 02:42:26.480
consider doing a followup and I'm,
I definitely want to share the sort of,

2651
02:42:26.481 --> 02:42:28.230
the results of our experiment with people also.

2652
02:42:28.231 --> 02:42:31.620
So we'll certainly be in constant contact,
but the,

2653
02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:36.810
the first rapid fire question is,
and the answer doesn't have to be short,

2654
02:42:36.811 --> 02:42:39.300
but it certainly can be.
When you think of the word successful,

2655
02:42:39.330 --> 02:42:41.910
who is the first person who comes to mind for you and why?

2656
02:42:45.260 --> 02:42:48.530
Wow,
good question.
Well,
it's not Obama,

2657
02:42:49.850 --> 02:42:52.430
not Obama piss all the people off out there

2658
02:42:56.720 --> 02:43:01.070
and on.
Someone I have admired for years and years is a Tony Robbins.

2659
02:43:02.290 --> 02:43:05.270
So he would be very high on my list.
Uh,

2660
02:43:05.660 --> 02:43:08.510
I tend to be very eclectic.
I'm not,
uh,

2661
02:43:08.960 --> 02:43:12.160
not trapped just in what,
what

2662
02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:16.090
<v 2>I found in terms of a business,
arts,</v>

2663
02:43:18.340 --> 02:43:21.010
politics.
I,
it,
it's,
it's all the same.
When,

2664
02:43:21.011 --> 02:43:24.940
when people get to that level of success,
they all have the same attitudes.

2665
02:43:24.941 --> 02:43:29.080
They bring the same tools and attitudes to the table.
And,
uh,

2666
02:43:29.260 --> 02:43:34.120
I found it surprising that I can sit down,
I can sit down with you Tim and visit.

2667
02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:38.060
I can sit down with special operators and visit and uh,

2668
02:43:39.130 --> 02:43:41.020
I can sit down with a,
you know,

2669
02:43:41.270 --> 02:43:46.270
worldclass ballerinas and dance and artists in that I just did this weekend as

2670
02:43:46.301 --> 02:43:49.500
it,
where they'll worldclass artists and we all,

2671
02:43:49.540 --> 02:43:51.370
you would think there's no common ground there,

2672
02:43:51.610 --> 02:43:55.810
but there is common ground because what's required to head chief success in all

2673
02:43:55.811 --> 02:43:58.240
of those requires the same skills.
You gotta be consistent.

2674
02:43:58.510 --> 02:44:00.640
You got to master the basics.
You gotta be patient.

2675
02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:03.680
Now you've got to constantly reinvent yourself.
Look,

2676
02:44:03.681 --> 02:44:07.810
look for a flaw hole on the preparation,
they exit,
move forward.

2677
02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:12.250
But you also have to be very observant and I think part of training yourself to

2678
02:44:12.251 --> 02:44:16.720
be observant as I like that,
asking questions,
right?
So I think that's,

2679
02:44:16.990 --> 02:44:19.510
and being willing to hear the answer,
definitely.

2680
02:44:19.511 --> 02:44:21.700
That's why you take a bunch of people who are the best at what they do and you

2681
02:44:21.701 --> 02:44:25.660
put them in the room,
generally speaking,
they're going to get along just fine.

2682
02:44:26.300 --> 02:44:31.120
Absolutely.
Uh,
the,
now why Tony Robbins?
I mean,

2683
02:44:31.121 --> 02:44:32.890
I'm a huge fan of Tony Robbins.
He's,
he's,

2684
02:44:32.891 --> 02:44:36.370
he's been on the podcast and I have tremendous respect for him,

2685
02:44:36.760 --> 02:44:40.570
but I want to just hear your reasons.
I like,
I like that.

2686
02:44:41.110 --> 02:44:45.250
I firmly believe,
especially in the u s I firmly believe that if,

2687
02:44:45.400 --> 02:44:49.690
if someone isn't as successful in any arena,
you toss it out,

2688
02:44:49.691 --> 02:44:54.220
whether it's professionally,
personally in your life,
financially,

2689
02:44:54.221 --> 02:44:56.730
if you're not as successful as you would like to be,

2690
02:44:56.740 --> 02:44:59.290
are making progress towards that.

2691
02:45:00.400 --> 02:45:04.570
It's our own fault we have,
we have so many opportunities here that,

2692
02:45:05.800 --> 02:45:10.720
gosh,
so,
so much wealth of knowledge that a lot of times,
so for example,

2693
02:45:10.780 --> 02:45:12.940
when GB got started,
okay,

2694
02:45:12.941 --> 02:45:16.600
there were two years,
a year and a half,

2695
02:45:16.660 --> 02:45:21.430
two years in the beginning where I was doing 18 hour days and didn't make a

2696
02:45:21.431 --> 02:45:25.570
nickel,
nothing.
And everyone around me was like,
what are you doing?

2697
02:45:26.210 --> 02:45:29.020
And Nah,
I've got plans for this.
And we talk about a little bit and they're like,

2698
02:45:29.021 --> 02:45:31.690
well,
you know,
if you need some extra money,
you could go get a job.

2699
02:45:31.691 --> 02:45:35.170
Think about how much further ahead you'd be right now.
But you kind of Hit,

2700
02:45:35.171 --> 02:45:38.950
you have to have that vision,
right?
And then you,
once you had the vision,

2701
02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:41.890
you've got to be able to put practical steps to it.

2702
02:45:42.220 --> 02:45:43.660
And then everyone's good at that.

2703
02:45:43.661 --> 02:45:45.940
And I outlines the people outlined stuff all the time.

2704
02:45:45.940 --> 02:45:50.740
But then can you stick with it?
Right?
Because when you,
you know,

2705
02:45:50.741 --> 02:45:53.110
when you run your business,
Tim,
when I run my business,

2706
02:45:53.111 --> 02:45:57.490
there's no one telling us what to do,
right?
We're the ones to monitor ourselves.

2707
02:45:57.520 --> 02:45:59.170
This needs to be done,
I'm going to get it done.

2708
02:45:59.680 --> 02:46:02.230
And it's kind of that difference between

2709
02:46:04.510 --> 02:46:08.620
letting someone else being in control of your life and you choosing to be in

2710
02:46:08.621 --> 02:46:11.750
control of your own life now.
No,
and I,
and I this,

2711
02:46:11.751 --> 02:46:14.420
I know some people are going to be upsetting a coach.
You know,
I'm a single mom.

2712
02:46:14.421 --> 02:46:16.940
It's this,
it's that I can't,
I can't do everything I want to do.
And,

2713
02:46:16.941 --> 02:46:20.870
and I get that.
I get that.
I've been there,
I've gone through that and I'm not,

2714
02:46:20.871 --> 02:46:24.170
I'm certainly not saying there are,
there are quick fixes.
Cars,
he's,

2715
02:46:24.171 --> 02:46:26.090
fixes can take years.

2716
02:46:26.540 --> 02:46:29.690
But I think if someone's willing to put the time in that there's so much

2717
02:46:29.691 --> 02:46:34.190
opportunity and they're willing to do that for years.
Right.
That,
you know,

2718
02:46:34.250 --> 02:46:37.460
it's kind of a big giant blank check.
A lot can change you.

2719
02:46:37.461 --> 02:46:41.240
You really have a lot of control.
And so that,
that was a message that,
you know,

2720
02:46:41.241 --> 02:46:45.860
and I didn't say it nearly as well as Tony Robbins does and I am going to twist

2721
02:46:45.861 --> 02:46:49.250
your arms.
I gate at an introduction someday to Tony.
That's high on my list.

2722
02:46:50.510 --> 02:46:54.720
<v 4>Yeah.
I throw a little jam session for,
for the people who are on the podcast.</v>

2723
02:46:54.721 --> 02:46:56.160
So if both of you will be invited,

2724
02:46:57.730 --> 02:47:01.600
<v 2>totally awesome.
So looking forward to that,
but you know,
way back when,
you know,</v>

2725
02:47:01.660 --> 02:47:05.350
poor as could be,
uh,
hadn't been,

2726
02:47:05.351 --> 02:47:07.330
hadn't made national team coach yet,

2727
02:47:07.331 --> 02:47:10.420
was just going to starting in my coaching career,
uh,

2728
02:47:10.450 --> 02:47:15.280
everything that could go wrong went wrong.
And uh,
here,
here's this guy saying,

2729
02:47:15.281 --> 02:47:19.690
you know what,
just uh,
think clear,
plan ahead and be willing to work.
And that,

2730
02:47:19.980 --> 02:47:24.070
that really resonated with me.
That resonated with me and uh,

2731
02:47:25.270 --> 02:47:25.650
you know,

2732
02:47:25.650 --> 02:47:30.490
it's like kind of just had this discussion with someone this morning.

2733
02:47:30.850 --> 02:47:35.080
You know,
they're,
you're young.
It's a,
it's so challenging.

2734
02:47:35.110 --> 02:47:38.980
It's so difficult to be patient when you're 35 and you're starting to get back

2735
02:47:38.981 --> 02:47:42.520
in shape again.
And the hardest thing they need to do is they've got to,

2736
02:47:42.700 --> 02:47:44.620
especially if they were a good athlete previously,

2737
02:47:44.621 --> 02:47:49.120
you've got to set that attitude of having been a stud before aside,

2738
02:47:49.540 --> 02:47:53.920
because that body you have right now is not that studs body that you had

2739
02:47:53.921 --> 02:47:56.470
previously.
It could be again,

2740
02:47:56.860 --> 02:47:58.990
but it took time to build it the first time.

2741
02:47:59.170 --> 02:48:03.430
It's going to take time to rebuild it this time or personally in your life if

2742
02:48:03.431 --> 02:48:07.060
things aren't where you want it to be,
it's going to take time to build it there.

2743
02:48:07.360 --> 02:48:12.090
<v 4>Yeah,
right.
I am this,
I had this Olympic weightlifting coach,
uh,</v>

2744
02:48:12.130 --> 02:48:14.830
who,
uh,
I think you guys would hit it off famously,

2745
02:48:14.831 --> 02:48:19.420
especially if if you were both a couple of drinks in,
but,
uh,
he's dangerous,
very,

2746
02:48:19.570 --> 02:48:24.370
very similar approaches.
And,
uh,
he said,

2747
02:48:24.510 --> 02:48:28.720
uh,
you have a Ferrari engine in a Toyota Corolla chassis

2748
02:48:30.940 --> 02:48:32.250
that's not love.
That said,

2749
02:48:32.260 --> 02:48:37.240
you can't just slam on the accelerator and expect good things to happen.
But,

2750
02:48:37.390 --> 02:48:41.450
uh,
yeah,
Tony,
Tony is very tactical,
practical,
and I apologize if you,

2751
02:48:41.470 --> 02:48:45.240
if you and everybody else can hear,
uh,
metal bowls being spun around.

2752
02:48:45.250 --> 02:48:48.100
That's what my dog,
Molly does when she's trying to tell me that she was hungry.

2753
02:48:48.101 --> 02:48:51.910
She just licks and empty empty bowl and sends it spinning.
I'm like,
yes,
I get it.

2754
02:48:51.911 --> 02:48:56.270
I know you're hungry.
But in subtle.
Yeah,
being very subtle.
Uh,

2755
02:48:56.290 --> 02:49:00.730
what book or books have you given the most to other people as gifts?

2756
02:49:01.730 --> 02:49:06.260
<v 2>Ooh,
I like that one now.
You know,</v>

2757
02:49:06.270 --> 02:49:08.280
it's not so much as I'm

2758
02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:12.090
<v 3>a big fan of,
uh,
Robert Heinlein.
Oh yeah.</v>

2759
02:49:12.180 --> 02:49:16.280
Sign [inaudible] stranger in a strange land at all and just,

2760
02:49:16.850 --> 02:49:20.400
just all of them.
I come back to those over and over again.
The,
uh,

2761
02:49:20.910 --> 02:49:25.380
the theme of self reliance,
you know,
cause I,
I came from a really,

2762
02:49:25.381 --> 02:49:26.520
really humble,

2763
02:49:26.521 --> 02:49:31.110
modest family background and so I think that instills a hunger and a work ethic.

2764
02:49:31.111 --> 02:49:33.840
It's a little bit kind of,
uh,
kind of embarrassing actually.

2765
02:49:33.841 --> 02:49:36.280
It's a little bit of a Charles Dickens theme there.
You know,

2766
02:49:36.290 --> 02:49:37.950
it's a frustration thing.

2767
02:49:37.951 --> 02:49:41.490
Things weren't where we wanted them to be or where I wanted him to be and that,

2768
02:49:41.820 --> 02:49:45.360
you know,
how big a price,
how hard are you willing to work in order to change it?

2769
02:49:46.020 --> 02:49:50.550
Um,
one I'm enjoying right now and I'm just getting into it is a,

2770
02:49:50.551 --> 02:49:54.660
the hops tickle is the way by Ryan holiday.
Very close friend of mine.

2771
02:49:56.010 --> 02:49:57.920
You're killing me dude.
You're killing me.

2772
02:49:58.590 --> 02:50:01.230
I'm just going to hang out in your living room so I can meet all these people.

2773
02:50:01.750 --> 02:50:05.370
You and Ryan would hit it off.
Oh yeah,
that's,
that's a great book.
I actually,

2774
02:50:05.730 --> 02:50:09.360
this is a really small world,
so I actually produced the audio book for that.

2775
02:50:10.410 --> 02:50:11.243
He kidding me.

2776
02:50:13.050 --> 02:50:18.030
And you know when you were talking about preparing your athletes for the stress

2777
02:50:18.031 --> 02:50:22.740
as opposed to paint a painting it over with yes,

2778
02:50:22.741 --> 02:50:26.430
you can,
and positive psychology and really kind of sowing the seeds of their own

2779
02:50:26.431 --> 02:50:29.700
destruction by doing so I was thinking about stoic philosophy.

2780
02:50:29.760 --> 02:50:32.790
So it doesn't surprise me that you're reading the obstacle's the way,

2781
02:50:32.791 --> 02:50:37.791
which has become an extremely popular book among professional sports teams and

2782
02:50:38.100 --> 02:50:40.800
coaches.
I mean,
the Patriots Seahawks,
they've,
they've all read this.

2783
02:50:41.790 --> 02:50:42.810
Someone else that,

2784
02:50:42.811 --> 02:50:46.440
that caught my eye who had read in that led me to it was Swarts and Egger.

2785
02:50:46.920 --> 02:50:49.860
Oh yeah.
Gosh,
I mean comes,

2786
02:50:49.890 --> 02:50:53.760
comes to the states with no money in his pocket and then,

2787
02:50:53.761 --> 02:50:57.510
and then becomes world champion in athletics,

2788
02:50:57.870 --> 02:51:02.670
becomes a millionaire in business and becomes a movie star and becomes a

2789
02:51:02.671 --> 02:51:07.160
governor success and for different arenas in life.
Oh yeah.
Good Lord.
He's the,

2790
02:51:07.180 --> 02:51:08.970
he said,
he said he liked that book and I was like,
well,

2791
02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:13.090
good enough for me or our loads.
Uh,
he's an impressive unit.
Wouldn't really,

2792
02:51:13.130 --> 02:51:15.970
that's the two things that I know we're about to do it,

2793
02:51:15.971 --> 02:51:19.200
but the two things that also a starfish me when,
uh,

2794
02:51:19.230 --> 02:51:21.630
when I interviewed him for the podcast was number one,

2795
02:51:21.631 --> 02:51:26.631
I didn't realize in doing the research until I did the research that he became a

2796
02:51:26.731 --> 02:51:30.810
millionaire before he ever had his first starring role in real estate in real

2797
02:51:30.811 --> 02:51:35.250
estate.
Yes,
absolutely.
That gave him the ability to only audition,

2798
02:51:36.450 --> 02:51:39.240
not out of financial necessity,
but for the roles that he wanted.

2799
02:51:39.241 --> 02:51:41.460
So he could say no,
and uh,

2800
02:51:41.490 --> 02:51:45.900
that his highest grossing film of all time for him personally was twins because

2801
02:51:45.901 --> 02:51:46.920
no one wanted to make it.

2802
02:51:46.921 --> 02:51:51.921
And so he took a cut of the upfront payment for the salary per se to in exchange

2803
02:51:53.431 --> 02:51:57.480
for back end points that were abnormally large for the film,

2804
02:51:57.481 --> 02:52:01.860
for the film history at that point.
Yeah.
Fascinating guy.
Uh,
love that.

2805
02:52:02.250 --> 02:52:05.740
Uh,
let's see.
What's,
uh,

2806
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:10.610
<v 4>do you have any particular morning rituals?
What does the first thing you do?</v>

2807
02:52:10.640 --> 02:52:13.870
Morning rituals I'm sposed to do now.
The ones,

2808
02:52:14.020 --> 02:52:15.760
the ones that you actually have or don't have.

2809
02:52:17.140 --> 02:52:20.670
<v 2>I tend to find as I've gotten older,</v>

2810
02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:24.930
because I'm in my fifties now,
early fifties,
as,
as I've gotten older,

2811
02:52:24.931 --> 02:52:26.580
I find that my,
uh,

2812
02:52:27.300 --> 02:52:30.840
by far my most productive times or early morning,

2813
02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:35.310
that's when I'm sharpest.
I'm clearest.
Saw I'll,
I'll tend to get up,
you know,

2814
02:52:35.311 --> 02:52:37.490
pretty early before everybody else in the house,

2815
02:52:37.491 --> 02:52:42.300
all this up and I'll get when you get up,
it varies.

2816
02:52:42.301 --> 02:52:46.830
I'll get up somewhere usually between four and five.
And,
uh,
you know,

2817
02:52:46.831 --> 02:52:47.521
it gives me a chance,

2818
02:52:47.521 --> 02:52:50.910
my girls get up in a few hours and it gives me a chance for that to three hours

2819
02:52:50.911 --> 02:52:55.140
of just clear thought.
Maybe.
Maybe it's working on a project,

2820
02:52:55.141 --> 02:52:58.680
maybe it's a new manuscript in homemade,
maybe it's just an,

2821
02:52:58.681 --> 02:52:59.820
I indulged some reading.

2822
02:52:59.821 --> 02:53:04.350
The house is quiet and then I do my best if after that girls had to school and

2823
02:53:04.351 --> 02:53:07.860
then I get my workout in and if I'm,
if I'm consistent with that,

2824
02:53:07.861 --> 02:53:10.140
then my rest of the rest of my day is usually pretty golden.

2825
02:53:10.250 --> 02:53:13.820
<v 4>Yeah.
You've already,
you've already won I him or somebody said to me,
if you win,</v>

2826
02:53:14.030 --> 02:53:16.670
if you win the morning,
you've won the day.
I'm still working on it.

2827
02:53:16.671 --> 02:53:21.500
That's work in progress.
But I,
I definitely agree with that.
Uh,

2828
02:53:21.560 --> 02:53:24.860
do you drink coffee?
Do you do eat breakfast?
Do you drink coffee?

2829
02:53:26.090 --> 02:53:29.700
<v 2>Yeah,
that's,
that's I,
I went for years.
And you know,</v>

2830
02:53:29.701 --> 02:53:32.880
you're always told them I'm not a coffee drinker.
I'm,
I'm one of those few,

2831
02:53:32.881 --> 02:53:37.320
I think what it just tastes like cough medicine to me.
And so it's,
it's not,

2832
02:53:37.530 --> 02:53:41.430
it's not me being virtuous.
It's just me mean despising the taste.

2833
02:53:43.170 --> 02:53:46.080
Now my wife is,
and it's funny cause my wife is a big coffee drinker.

2834
02:53:46.081 --> 02:53:50.490
She loves us and she's got her Gorman grinder and all this stuff.
But for me now,

2835
02:53:50.491 --> 02:53:54.130
no way.
Uh,
what was the second question,
Tim?
Cough off.

2836
02:53:54.210 --> 02:53:57.990
Do you drink breakfast or Drake breakfast?
Do you eat breakfast?
You know,
I,

2837
02:53:57.991 --> 02:54:02.260
I found as I got older that uh,
I,

2838
02:54:02.300 --> 02:54:07.290
I do best if I don't do breakfast.
I do best as a,
I used to be heavy,

2839
02:54:07.291 --> 02:54:11.250
heavy protein.
And then,
uh,
after I got over 50,
if I cut,

2840
02:54:11.251 --> 02:54:15.210
and this is me personally,
would it work for a younger athletes who are training?

2841
02:54:15.211 --> 02:54:19.590
I doubt it.
It's bigger engine,
need more fuel,
but for me older it's slowing down.

2842
02:54:20.010 --> 02:54:24.860
I find that,
uh,
not doing breakfast,
uh,
reasonable lunch.
My,

2843
02:54:24.861 --> 02:54:27.240
my protein sizes are so much smaller now.

2844
02:54:27.540 --> 02:54:31.800
Mostly vegges have a good healthy starts.
Usually it's rice or potatoes,

2845
02:54:32.190 --> 02:54:34.110
reasonable little protein there,

2846
02:54:34.111 --> 02:54:38.760
some fat at lunch way do the same at dinner,
you know,
and I'm,
I'm done.

2847
02:54:38.761 --> 02:54:39.820
I'm good.
I'm on.

2848
02:54:39.830 --> 02:54:43.980
I was amazed how much I was overeating just from habit.

2849
02:54:44.710 --> 02:54:46.810
<v 4>Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Eating by the clock.
I mean,</v>

2850
02:54:46.811 --> 02:54:51.380
I've noticed the same thing for myself and it's,

2851
02:54:51.490 --> 02:54:56.110
I've been amazed how many people I've interviewed for this podcast who are the

2852
02:54:56.111 --> 02:54:59.700
best at what they do,
who do not eat breakfast.
Um,
you're kidding.
Really not done.

2853
02:54:59.701 --> 02:55:03.530
Or it was alone in the Pavel,
you know,
his answer was coffee.
Tim.

2854
02:55:03.680 --> 02:55:08.510
I keep it simple.
You know,
and then,
um,
Wim Hoff,
same story.
Uh,

2855
02:55:08.511 --> 02:55:13.280
you look at Stan,
the general state or former General Stan Mcchrystal,
same story.

2856
02:55:13.790 --> 02:55:15.740
And it just goes on and on and on.

2857
02:55:15.741 --> 02:55:20.150
It's a good third of the men specifically.
Uh,

2858
02:55:20.210 --> 02:55:22.490
not sure if the female body responds as well to it,

2859
02:55:22.491 --> 02:55:25.220
although I'm sure there are intermittent fasting people out there who would,

2860
02:55:25.360 --> 02:55:28.790
who would say that,
that,
uh,
women responding in the same way,

2861
02:55:28.791 --> 02:55:31.100
but a very high percentage?

2862
02:55:31.101 --> 02:55:34.760
I'd say maybe a third of the men I've had on the podcast do not eat breakfast.

2863
02:55:34.760 --> 02:55:39.170
Now,
specifically,
these are men probably over the age of 45.
So I don't know.
I,

2864
02:55:39.171 --> 02:55:42.560
I would imagine that they're dying has probably changed over time and

2865
02:55:42.830 --> 02:55:46.460
interestingly enough,
if you do dig into the literature,

2866
02:55:46.461 --> 02:55:49.790
there is a,
or if I wanted to be a nerd,

2867
02:55:49.791 --> 02:55:54.791
there are data to suggest that as we get older it is possible that we absorb

2868
02:55:56.751 --> 02:56:01.751
protein more effectively when we have larger doses of protein less frequently.

2869
02:56:03.530 --> 02:56:06.170
So having them see that is interesting.

2870
02:56:06.430 --> 02:56:10.520
That is very interesting because I find myself every once in awhile getting a

2871
02:56:10.521 --> 02:56:14.390
big steak.
Yup.
You know,
once a week,
once every two weeks I'll go on,

2872
02:56:14.391 --> 02:56:16.700
I'll just get this massive thing of protein and then I'm,

2873
02:56:16.760 --> 02:56:20.540
then I'm good for a while and just marry modest.
Yeah,

2874
02:56:20.541 --> 02:56:23.840
so this is like Bolus of protein for like older women.

2875
02:56:23.841 --> 02:56:27.480
I think I saw one particular study,
it could have been an observational.
Ah,

2876
02:56:27.481 --> 02:56:30.140
now I get,
no,
I doubt it if they're trying to standardize the protein amount,

2877
02:56:30.141 --> 02:56:31.140
but it was some large amount.

2878
02:56:31.141 --> 02:56:35.270
It was like 70 80 grams of protein in a single feeding was absorbed better than

2879
02:56:35.271 --> 02:56:39.210
that same amount split over several meals in the day.
Really fascinating stuff.

2880
02:56:40.760 --> 02:56:43.670
What would you put on a billboard?

2881
02:56:43.760 --> 02:56:47.060
If you could put a billboard anywhere,
what would it just,

2882
02:56:47.061 --> 02:56:50.330
what's on just what's on top of my mind right now.
Yeah.

2883
02:56:50.480 --> 02:56:52.000
What's the top of the head?
Doesn't have to,

2884
02:56:52.010 --> 02:56:55.820
we're not looking for universal truth,
but just,
what's a,

2885
02:56:55.821 --> 02:56:58.730
I wouldn't say probiotic,
probiotic,

2886
02:56:59.240 --> 02:57:04.020
<v 2>probiotic.
When we went,
uh,
I don't know if it had,
was a history of a,</v>

2887
02:57:04.021 --> 02:57:08.390
I had to cut them out,
you know,
too much.
Margarita's uh,
you know,

2888
02:57:08.391 --> 02:57:10.910
and it's kind of funny now as you get older it starts creeping in more and more

2889
02:57:10.911 --> 02:57:14.750
and more.
But I went through a phase where it didn't matter what I ate,

2890
02:57:15.140 --> 02:57:19.280
didn't matter what I ate.
If I ate fat,
if I eat low fat,
if I eat veggies,

2891
02:57:19.490 --> 02:57:23.990
if I high protein,
terrible digestion,
just terrible digestion.

2892
02:57:24.410 --> 02:57:27.080
And I happened to come across something that's,
that said you,

2893
02:57:27.090 --> 02:57:30.740
if you have Dadadada,
Dadadada might be a probiotic issue.

2894
02:57:31.400 --> 02:57:35.140
And so through,
through a good buddy,
I had a laboratory grade.
Uh,

2895
02:57:35.150 --> 02:57:38.690
these particular ones were from Klaire labs.
He kind need prescription forum.

2896
02:57:38.720 --> 02:57:43.700
There are laboratory grade probiotic.
Klaire want to say it was k,

2897
02:57:43.760 --> 02:57:47.900
l a.
I.
R.
E.
Got it.
Okay.
No,
I'm not paid by them guys.

2898
02:57:47.901 --> 02:57:50.770
And there are a son of a bitch to track down cause you need a prescription for

2899
02:57:50.771 --> 02:57:55.280
them.
And I got get them the health provider but uh,
hooked me up in 12 hours.

2900
02:57:56.150 --> 02:58:01.000
And so I,
uh,
I was like,
Holy Molly,
cause I'd,
I'd,
I'd been uncomfortable or,

2901
02:58:02.130 --> 02:58:05.490
and in 12 hours this,
this took care of it,
uh,

2902
02:58:06.630 --> 02:58:09.630
contacted a buddy of mine who,
uh,
is,
you know,
great,

2903
02:58:09.690 --> 02:58:13.860
great at a nutrition he went over.
So,
you know,
know coach,
you should,

2904
02:58:13.861 --> 02:58:16.200
you should go ahead and probably take,
you know,
two,

2905
02:58:16.201 --> 02:58:20.340
four weeks and just really hit these probiotics hard and repopulate the guy,

2906
02:58:20.341 --> 02:58:25.080
you know,
years of too much Margarita was,
uh,
too much protein,

2907
02:58:25.081 --> 02:58:27.050
not enough Vage vegetable matter to fit,

2908
02:58:27.060 --> 02:58:32.010
to feed the good bacteria and sell gun night,
night and day difference.
I bet.

2909
02:58:32.190 --> 02:58:34.860
Simply because of that I dropped eight pounds.

2910
02:58:35.680 --> 02:58:37.380
<v 4>Yeah,
I bet.
I'm in the,</v>

2911
02:58:37.870 --> 02:58:41.800
I am currently taking a VSL three and a few other probiotics,

2912
02:58:41.801 --> 02:58:45.460
but one of the points you made that I think is really worth underscoring is the

2913
02:58:45.461 --> 02:58:48.220
vegetable matter and prebiotics.
Uh,

2914
02:58:48.250 --> 02:58:53.250
so providing the food that creates the environment in which bacteria that you

2915
02:58:54.851 --> 02:58:59.830
want to grow can grow effectively.
Whether that's through foods,
where I think,

2916
02:58:59.860 --> 02:59:04.090
you know,
one of the ways I had this,
uh,
biologists tell me at one point he said,

2917
02:59:04.091 --> 02:59:06.570
I think slow carbs going to be vindicated because you know,

2918
02:59:06.580 --> 02:59:09.190
the beans and lentils and so on are vilified by Paleo,

2919
02:59:09.191 --> 02:59:12.430
but they provide the perfect,
uh,

2920
02:59:13.270 --> 02:59:18.270
they provide the perfect vehicle for a prebiotic environment that can foster the

2921
02:59:20.681 --> 02:59:25.600
development of and growth of these areas,
bacteria and the gut.
And if not that,

2922
02:59:25.990 --> 02:59:28.030
you know,
if you're,
if you are a Paleo purist,

2923
02:59:28.540 --> 02:59:30.910
you could also consume something like foss,
you know,

2924
02:59:30.911 --> 02:59:34.270
flipped oligosaccharides or email it or any of these other things.
But,
um,

2925
02:59:35.770 --> 02:59:38.720
wow.
I had no idea that you had that experience.
Uh,
yeah,
it was,

2926
02:59:38.830 --> 02:59:39.521
<v 2>it was shocking.</v>

2927
02:59:39.521 --> 02:59:43.250
Prior to that I would've said number one supplement was lik I'm also high

2928
02:59:43.251 --> 02:59:44.410
vitamin D drops.

2929
02:59:45.300 --> 02:59:46.320
<v 4>How much were you consuming,</v>

2930
02:59:46.321 --> 02:59:48.990
just out of curiosity and of course the amount you'd take depends on what your

2931
02:59:48.991 --> 02:59:50.180
levels are dependent.

2932
02:59:50.410 --> 02:59:53.540
<v 2>Yeah,
just,
just a little background there.
So I was at,
um,</v>

2933
02:59:53.620 --> 02:59:57.250
our winter nationals seven years ago and uh,

2934
02:59:57.790 --> 03:00:01.120
just kind of the environment,
you know,
national team kids everywhere,

2935
03:00:01.240 --> 03:00:05.410
middle of the winter,
it's always in a February.
And I would just get sick,

2936
03:00:05.411 --> 03:00:07.120
really bad,
kind of bronchitis,

2937
03:00:07.121 --> 03:00:11.860
like sickness once or twice a year for Gosh,
decades.

2938
03:00:12.310 --> 03:00:16.140
And uh,
at one of the A's I was,
I was half dead.
And,
uh,

2939
03:00:16.210 --> 03:00:19.300
my assistant coach is trying to run my athletes.
He's doing his best,

2940
03:00:19.301 --> 03:00:23.440
but it's not going real well.
I'm,
I'm hanging under,
I'm trying to coach,

2941
03:00:23.441 --> 03:00:28.210
hanging over a railing and I'm visiting with Rob Wolf later that night and I'm

2942
03:00:28.211 --> 03:00:31.570
just like,
you know,
this,
this is ridiculous.
And Rob's the one who tagged,
he said,

2943
03:00:31.571 --> 03:00:34.870
coach,
you know,
it's,
it's always in the middle of other winter.
Try some,

2944
03:00:35.140 --> 03:00:39.850
try some vitamin D.
And I just started the liquid vitamin D.

2945
03:00:40.660 --> 03:00:44.160
I have not been,
if we don't count food poisoning in Hong Kong,
I,

2946
03:00:44.170 --> 03:00:48.750
I've not been sick sense.
Yeah.
And that,

2947
03:00:48.790 --> 03:00:49.900
and that's quite a swing,
you know,

2948
03:00:49.901 --> 03:00:53.680
once or twice pretty serious per year to nothing for seven.

2949
03:00:53.681 --> 03:00:57.940
And the only thing that changed in that time was that was the vitamin D.
So I,

2950
03:00:58.120 --> 03:01:00.220
I am,
I'm,
I'm,
you know,
I'm pretty,
pretty

2951
03:01:00.220 --> 03:01:03.760
<v 3>practical.
If that was the one variable I changed now as a result,
while boom,</v>

2952
03:01:04.030 --> 03:01:05.650
that's,
that's the doorstep I budded at.

2953
03:01:05.830 --> 03:01:08.020
What to do you have a particular brand that you use for that?

2954
03:01:09.190 --> 03:01:12.760
I want to say I,
I've looked at it as so many years.

2955
03:01:12.761 --> 03:01:16.750
I just cannot pick it up off the shelf.
And I want to say it was biotest perhaps.

2956
03:01:17.710 --> 03:01:20.200
Got It.
And so I can't,
I can't swear about other ones.

2957
03:01:20.201 --> 03:01:23.890
I just know I've always used that particular one.
I've done,

2958
03:01:24.640 --> 03:01:25.420
gosh,

2959
03:01:25.420 --> 03:01:30.010
all kinds of different protocols from one or two drops a day.

2960
03:01:30.070 --> 03:01:33.780
It's like,
it's like a runny Elmers glue for those who haven't had it.
Uh,

2961
03:01:34.880 --> 03:01:39.370
yeah.
It's the taste isn't,
you know,
anything to get upset at all.
My daughters,

2962
03:01:39.371 --> 03:01:42.380
when they were young,
disagree,
they say Jose,
who was the worst thing about it?

2963
03:01:42.450 --> 03:01:46.780
It's,
it's not bad at all.
Uh,
we've done a daily,

2964
03:01:46.810 --> 03:01:51.810
a few drops all the way up to once or twice a week with a eight to 10 drops,

2965
03:01:53.850 --> 03:01:56.050
you know,
and just mix it up.
It just seems like,
you know,

2966
03:01:56.380 --> 03:01:59.700
as long as you're consistent,
it almost doesn't matter.
Yes.

2967
03:01:59.710 --> 03:02:02.960
I'm guessing each of those drops is probably an ICU and one internationally,

2968
03:02:02.980 --> 03:02:07.900
but ah,
gosh,
it seems like,
um,
then I'm,
I'm tied to a computer right now.

2969
03:02:07.901 --> 03:02:09.320
Right.
I'd go,
I'd go grab it for you.

2970
03:02:09.321 --> 03:02:14.010
It seemed like the dosage is surprisingly high in each drop and you know,

2971
03:02:14.110 --> 03:02:16.780
and I'm,
I'm a big fan,
especially as you get older,

2972
03:02:17.530 --> 03:02:21.520
you've got to go get blood work and anything else is guessing.
Yeah.

2973
03:02:21.521 --> 03:02:23.890
You need to get blood work,
period.
I mean,
if you get your choice,

2974
03:02:23.950 --> 03:02:27.040
if you get your car checked out more often than you get your blood work done,

2975
03:02:27.041 --> 03:02:30.570
then you need to rearrange your priorities.
Uh,

2976
03:02:30.860 --> 03:02:32.980
so last,
uh,

2977
03:02:33.610 --> 03:02:37.120
last question and this is where I'd like you to certainly,
uh,

2978
03:02:37.121 --> 03:02:40.540
among other things to point people to where they can learn more about you and

2979
03:02:40.541 --> 03:02:43.060
gymnastic bodies.
But,
uh,
what's,
uh,

2980
03:02:43.090 --> 03:02:47.350
what ask or request would you have for my audience?
For the people listening?

2981
03:02:49.320 --> 03:02:50.680
I'm not understanding the question.

2982
03:02:50.860 --> 03:02:52.750
So the question there actually kind of two separate things.

2983
03:02:52.900 --> 03:02:55.030
So one is outside of gymnastics,

2984
03:02:55.210 --> 03:02:58.900
a gymnastic bodies and the work that you're up to and pointing people to that,

2985
03:02:59.290 --> 03:03:01.900
do you have any ask or request for the people listening?
I mean,

2986
03:03:01.901 --> 03:03:06.250
they're going to be hundreds of thousands at the very least in the first week,

2987
03:03:06.460 --> 03:03:10.240
maybe millions of people listening to this.
What would you like them to think on,

2988
03:03:10.270 --> 03:03:14.020
do or consider?
Oh,
okay.
Very good.
Actually.

2989
03:03:14.021 --> 03:03:17.440
I love that question.
I would like them to consider two things.

2990
03:03:17.560 --> 03:03:21.430
I would like them to consider where's the fire?

2991
03:03:22.690 --> 03:03:26.010
Where's the fire?
Where's wars?
The rush?
Where's the rational?

2992
03:03:26.011 --> 03:03:30.670
Why are they trying to accomplish everything?
Their current goals yesterday?

2993
03:03:31.630 --> 03:03:35.110
Why?
Why not slow down a little bit.
Not saying not to work hard,

2994
03:03:35.111 --> 03:03:38.950
but why don't we just slow down a little bit,
little more reasonable pace,

2995
03:03:39.310 --> 03:03:43.000
some more consistency so that,
that,
that would be number one ask.

2996
03:03:43.570 --> 03:03:47.920
And then second one is mobility.
Whether it's my material,

2997
03:03:47.980 --> 03:03:50.200
when it's just the stuff that Tim posts for you,

2998
03:03:50.201 --> 03:03:54.250
whether it's someone else's material and um,
it's,
it's fine with me guys,

2999
03:03:54.251 --> 03:03:58.010
but we've,
we've got to get those bodies moving.
We've to get natural range

3000
03:03:58.010 --> 03:04:02.150
<v 2>of motion back again,
that,
that alone,
if we did the hierarchy,</v>

3001
03:04:02.151 --> 03:04:04.220
what will increase quality of life?

3002
03:04:04.221 --> 03:04:09.140
The fastest for them is going to be mobility first,
then core,

3003
03:04:09.470 --> 03:04:12.470
then you know,
your more conventional strength,
your arms,
your shoulders,
Yada,

3004
03:04:12.471 --> 03:04:13.304
Yada,
Yada.

3005
03:04:14.530 --> 03:04:19.230
<v 4>And where can people find you online,</v>

3006
03:04:19.290 --> 03:04:20.700
on social media,
et Cetera.

3007
03:04:20.730 --> 03:04:24.090
W W what would you recommend as a next step for somebody who's never done

3008
03:04:24.091 --> 03:04:27.150
gymnastics?
Anything who wants to dip their toe in the water?

3009
03:04:27.890 --> 03:04:32.600
<v 2>Uh,
first sang goto gymnastic bodies.
Dot.
Come on now.
We are,
we are putting a,</v>

3010
03:04:32.700 --> 03:04:36.530
we have a special landing page for your,
for your listeners,
Tim,

3011
03:04:36.531 --> 03:04:37.970
with a nice discount forum.

3012
03:04:38.330 --> 03:04:43.180
But we have a nice introductory program that's just gymnastic bodies,
Gui,

3013
03:04:43.260 --> 03:04:46.280
m,
N,
a,
s,
t,
I,
C,
B,
o,
d,
I,
e,

3014
03:04:46.281 --> 03:04:50.660
s.com/tim and we've got,
we've got a nice discount,

3015
03:04:50.661 --> 03:04:55.010
therefore you for a nice intro program.
Uh,
it's about a 24 day program,

3016
03:04:55.460 --> 03:04:59.570
a gentle introduction to kind of the language we speak,

3017
03:04:59.750 --> 03:05:03.880
get started on some mobility,
some great follow along videos forum,
you know,

3018
03:05:03.890 --> 03:05:07.670
kind of hold their hand,
make sure they get started off on the right foot.

3019
03:05:08.480 --> 03:05:11.980
<v 4>Yeah,
it's a,
it's been a tremendous learning experience for me so far.</v>

3020
03:05:12.210 --> 03:05:13.400
It's only been,

3021
03:05:14.150 --> 03:05:18.200
I mean really a handful of weeks that we've been digging into this deeply,

3022
03:05:18.201 --> 03:05:22.410
although we had some prep time and talking about it prior to that.
Uh,

3023
03:05:22.850 --> 03:05:27.410
and uh,
definitely guys,
if you are like,
ah,
you know,
I'm so busy,

3024
03:05:27.411 --> 03:05:30.170
I'm doing this,
that and the other thing,
take a look at the program.

3025
03:05:30.171 --> 03:05:34.310
But at the very least,
follow a gymnastic potties on Instagram.

3026
03:05:34.730 --> 03:05:38.850
And every time you see a video from a student,
uh,

3027
03:05:38.930 --> 03:05:43.400
who seems to throw one of your excuses at the window,
like pick a take a second.

3028
03:05:43.850 --> 03:05:47.660
I just admire what someone has done from scratch.

3029
03:05:47.990 --> 03:05:52.280
Like Matt who you mentioned who started in his late forties,
uh,

3030
03:05:53.030 --> 03:05:54.680
awesome.
Like one by one.

3031
03:05:54.681 --> 03:05:56.720
If you just watch that and straight on account for a week,

3032
03:05:56.780 --> 03:06:01.640
you'll run out of excuses a very,
very,
very,
very quickly.
Uh,

3033
03:06:01.760 --> 03:06:04.230
what about,
uh,
elsewhere on social media?
Is there any,
well,

3034
03:06:04.250 --> 03:06:05.680
where else people can see how do you

3035
03:06:06.500 --> 03:06:10.850
<v 2>are a Facebook page is gymnastic bodies.com.
Little,</v>

3036
03:06:10.870 --> 03:06:15.050
a little more proper there.
Uh,
my personal page,
Christopher Sommer,

3037
03:06:15.110 --> 03:06:18.290
s o m m e r,
m,
a little more,

3038
03:06:19.220 --> 03:06:23.900
no rules there.
And I'm not,
I'm not insane,
but my,
my interests are wide ranging.

3039
03:06:23.901 --> 03:06:25.640
So if you come to my page,
you a,

3040
03:06:25.641 --> 03:06:28.580
you're taking your chances what I'm going to torture you with that day.

3041
03:06:29.200 --> 03:06:32.510
So it might be conditioning or it might be,
you know what I think such,

3042
03:06:32.511 --> 03:06:35.480
such as Kik,
gas,
and I like it.
So you're going to like it too.

3043
03:06:36.160 --> 03:06:37.950
<v 4>And you do throw up some,</v>

3044
03:06:38.090 --> 03:06:43.090
some ridiculous in the best way possible videos of just monsters doing some

3045
03:06:43.610 --> 03:06:47.810
absurd,
absurd stuff.
I mean,
the,
who's the Gent you sent me?

3046
03:06:48.140 --> 03:06:50.690
You encouraged me to check this out.
This guy who was going from,

3047
03:06:50.990 --> 03:06:54.860
you're trying to explain the,
uh,

3048
03:06:55.080 --> 03:06:58.920
let me get this right.
I want to say plate planches that I was doing while back,

3049
03:06:58.921 --> 03:07:01.770
which you're kind of like a front raise holding onto a plate with the shoulders.

3050
03:07:01.771 --> 03:07:05.070
Super,
super protracted and the massive,

3051
03:07:05.450 --> 03:07:10.410
a posterior pelvic tilt I sent,
I sent you that clip of a world champ on rings.

3052
03:07:11.900 --> 03:07:12.840
It was,
it might've been,

3053
03:07:12.990 --> 03:07:16.560
I think you said you sent me of one of Van Gelder on rings and then he sent me

3054
03:07:16.561 --> 03:07:20.930
one of this guy on parallel bars going forward.
Hand Gelder again.
Okay.

3055
03:07:20.970 --> 03:07:25.530
Going from the handstand to the,
uh,
the,
uh,
the straight body plant.

3056
03:07:26.310 --> 03:07:30.780
Oh Holy God.
We do it.
We do it with 10 or 25 pounds.

3057
03:07:30.781 --> 03:07:33.330
He was doing it with full body way.
Oh my God.
How do you,

3058
03:07:33.390 --> 03:07:37.490
how do you spell van Gelder you're a hearing so much Uri.

3059
03:07:37.650 --> 03:07:41.790
A van.
Gelder I think he's from Netherlands,
if I'm remembering right.

3060
03:07:41.791 --> 03:07:46.680
Former world champ,
a v a n space g.
E l d e r,

3061
03:07:47.160 --> 03:07:49.500
just a monster.
Oh my God.
Oh such.

3062
03:07:49.501 --> 03:07:53.010
So just Raisie strong and not,

3063
03:07:53.070 --> 03:07:56.500
I mean it doesn't look like a small guy either.
I mean,
Scott,

3064
03:07:57.210 --> 03:08:01.200
he's a big boy.
He's got like two people's back.
He has got a wide back.

3065
03:08:01.230 --> 03:08:05.100
It's a people's check that out and I'll link to everything in the show notes.

3066
03:08:05.490 --> 03:08:10.140
A well coach,
thank you so much for the time.
Uh,
I know it's precious and I uh,

3067
03:08:10.170 --> 03:08:14.640
I think people will get a real kick out of this and we crammed a lot into the

3068
03:08:14.641 --> 03:08:19.560
talk.
So he did talk a lot.
It was good.
So I look forward to chatting again soon,

3069
03:08:19.561 --> 03:08:22.140
which I'm sure we will do.
And to everybody listening,

3072
03:08:31.230 --> 03:08:35.670

everywhere in the show notes.
A,

3074

Forward Slash podcast all spelled out for our work week.com forward slash

3075
03:08:42.121 --> 03:08:46.200
podcast and as always,

3076
03:08:46.470 --> 03:08:47.610
Thank you for listening.

3077
03:08:53.760 --> 03:08:57.150
<v 1>Hey guys,
this is Tim again.
Just a few more things before you take off.</v>

3078
03:08:57.480 --> 03:09:00.120
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

3079
03:09:00.420 --> 03:09:03.420
Do you want to get a short email from me?

3080
03:09:03.421 --> 03:09:07.560
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

3081
03:09:07.561 --> 03:09:11.100
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

3082
03:09:11.101 --> 03:09:15.450
short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

3083
03:09:15.451 --> 03:09:16.770
pondering over the week.

3084
03:09:16.980 --> 03:09:19.740
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered.

3085
03:09:19.741 --> 03:09:23.190
It could include Gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've

3086
03:09:23.191 --> 03:09:27.510
somehow dug up in the,
uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

3087
03:09:27.810 --> 03:09:32.810
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my

3088
03:09:33.480 --> 03:09:36.180
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

3089
03:09:36.270 --> 03:09:41.250
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

3090
03:09:41.310 --> 03:09:43.470
So if you want to receive that,

3093

next one.

3094
03:09:57.620 --> 03:10:00.260
This episode is brought to you by exo protein.

3095
03:10:00.350 --> 03:10:03.020
It's one of the startups that I work with.
I love what they do.

3096
03:10:03.350 --> 03:10:06.590
These guys are making protein bars using crickets,
protein powder,

3097
03:10:06.650 --> 03:10:09.560
and before you screw your face up and look disgusted,

3098
03:10:09.561 --> 03:10:12.530
I bet they taste better than any protein bar you've ever had before.

3099
03:10:12.890 --> 03:10:16.340
I devour these bars after lifting sessions.
I take them with me on the road.

3100
03:10:16.610 --> 03:10:19.250
The recipes were developed by a three Michelin Star Chef,

3101
03:10:19.280 --> 03:10:21.200
former head of r and d at the fat duck,

3102
03:10:21.530 --> 03:10:24.080
which was ranked the number one restaurant in the world during his tenure.

3103
03:10:24.430 --> 03:10:29.150
The bars are paleo friendly,
no gluten,
no grains,
no soy,
no dairy,
et cetera.

3104
03:10:29.390 --> 03:10:33.470
They are high in protein and flavor and extremely unique and they do not pop

3105
03:10:33.471 --> 03:10:35.960
your glycemic response up,
oddly enough,

3106
03:10:36.320 --> 03:10:40.700
and you can look that up on line,
uh,
to,
to see some stories on that.

3107
03:10:40.700 --> 03:10:44.090
Ferran Stein,
that's the journalist who looked at it on top of all that.

3108
03:10:44.120 --> 03:10:47.450
They are less processed than nearly all protein bars.
You'll be able to find.

3109
03:10:47.840 --> 03:10:49.910
This is your chance to see what the hype is about.

3110
03:10:49.960 --> 03:10:54.020
The founders were just on the Forbes 30 under 30 list and they are offering a

3111
03:10:54.021 --> 03:10:55.910
deep discount to Tim Ferriss show listeners.

3112
03:10:55.911 --> 03:10:58.910
If you go to exo protein.com forward slash Tim,

3113
03:10:58.911 --> 03:11:01.730
that's e x o protein.com forward slash Tim today,

3114
03:11:02.030 --> 03:11:05.570
you can try a sampler pack with all of their most popular flavors for less than

3115
03:11:05.571 --> 03:11:06.270
10 bucks.

3116
03:11:06.270 --> 03:11:10.130
That's extra protein.com forward slash Tim and I would recommend doing it

3117
03:11:10.131 --> 03:11:13.760
relatively fast and that's not a bs scarcity thing.

3118
03:11:13.970 --> 03:11:16.880
They're startup with limited inventory and the side all the time.

3119
03:11:17.210 --> 03:11:20.380
That is what happened last time I mentioned that,
so check it out.
EXO,

3120
03:11:20.390 --> 03:11:22.310
protein.com forward slash

3121
03:11:22.640 --> 03:11:23.473
<v 0>yep,</v>

3122
03:11:27.940 --> 03:11:30.130
<v 1>so does brought to you by headspace.</v>

3123
03:11:30.460 --> 03:11:33.310
More than 80% of the people I have interviewed,

3124
03:11:33.340 --> 03:11:37.450
world class performers across the military,
entertainment,

3125
03:11:37.720 --> 03:11:42.340
sports and beyond all have some type of meditative practice.

3126
03:11:42.790 --> 03:11:45.520
I tried for years and years and failed miserably.

3127
03:11:45.670 --> 03:11:49.570
The key is making it simple and you can dramatically improve your life in just

3128
03:11:49.571 --> 03:11:51.430
10 minutes a day and technology can help you.

3129
03:11:51.760 --> 03:11:55.900
This change comes through guided meditation and headspace is by far the most

3130
03:11:55.901 --> 03:12:00.190
popular app for this purpose.
More than 4 million users.

3131
03:12:00.490 --> 03:12:01.840
It's meditation made simple,

3132
03:12:02.110 --> 03:12:05.350
so what I recommend is that you take this practice meditation,

3133
03:12:05.351 --> 03:12:07.210
which is rooted in thousands of years of tradition,

3134
03:12:07.211 --> 03:12:12.211
supported by thousands of scientific studies and try it for 10 minutes a day for

3135
03:12:13.271 --> 03:12:17.230
10 days.
That's all you need to do.
You could also check out the founder,

3136
03:12:17.231 --> 03:12:21.460
Andy Puddicombe,
a ted talk,
which has more than 5.5 million views.

3137
03:12:21.461 --> 03:12:26.020
His last name is Pud,
