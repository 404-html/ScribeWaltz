00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.820
Sir Richard,
what did you have for breakfast?

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.750
I had a yogurt with pistachios,

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.870
some coffee and water.

4
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.780
That was once it got to the airport and I've had some almonds.
Good man.

5
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.540
More water,
more water,

6
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.110
<v 1>flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.</v>

7
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.640
I'm a cybernetic organism.

8
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.150
<v 0>Soda is brought to you by me undies.
If I'm not going commando,
I'm in me.
Andy's,</v>

9
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.550
I have been testing these underwear for three to four months now,

10
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.660
pretty much every day and in fact throughout bunch of my other underwear this

11
00:00:52.661 --> 00:00:55.840
morning and on the road in the house,

12
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.380
they are extremely comfortable.
They look good,
feel good.

13
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.400
They are made of micro model two times softer than cotton as scientifically

14
00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:07.150
tested using the call.
Bought to method sounds very fancy.
Of course.

15
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.020
And I get a lot of compliments from ladies for these.
You don't get diaper butt,

16
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.940
you don't get the tired elastic band.

17
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.920
They look great and they have underwear for both men and women.

18
00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:21.660
Check out [inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim and you can see everything I've

19
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.020
been wearing.
They're ridiculous.
The sublime,
everything in between and colluding.

20
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.370
My favorite,
which is called out.

21
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.880
And I would be remiss if I didn't mention their lounge pants.

22
00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:34.630
This is a new thing and I have been wearing their lounge pants when I record

23
00:01:34.631 --> 00:01:35.440
podcast.

24
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.710
I've been wearing them out and about when I'm walking the dog meeting people for

25
00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:42.580
coffee.
And they are extremely comfortable though.

26
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.880
They're made from the same material as the underwear,
but some of them,

27
00:01:45.881 --> 00:01:46.481
like the blue ones,

28
00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:51.481
I have have pockets so you can walk about without seeming like you're off of

29
00:01:51.851 --> 00:01:55.330
your meds and completely crazy.
So that is awesome.

30
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.940
And if you're not happy with the first pair you try on,

31
00:01:57.941 --> 00:01:59.290
I assume that it refers to the underwear,

32
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.080
they'll refund you completely and you can keep the pair you tried on for free.

33
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.310
But if you're that kind of person,

34
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.980
you should be ashamed because that's disgusting.
Uh,

35
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.950
me on [inaudible] dot com slash Tim check it out.

This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.
I get asked all the time,

37
00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:17.170
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

38
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.080
And my answer is inevitably Athletic Greens,

39
00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:22.570
it is your all in one nutritional insurance.

40
00:02:22.571 --> 00:02:24.310
I recommended it in the four hour body,

41
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.330
did not get paid for that and I travel with it to avoid getting sick.

42
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.360
I take it in the mornings to ensure optimal performance.

43
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.830
It just covers all my basis.

44
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.850
If I can't get what I need through whole food meals throughout the rest of the

45
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.680
day,
and you can get 50 oh my God,
50% off.
Yes,

49
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.250

Hello ducks,
hoons and melanoma looked that one up.
Belgian malinois.

53
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.040
If you want to see a flash of a creature,

54
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.140
go across your screen and take out a criminal.

55
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.700
Just look for Canine Belgian malinois on Youtube.
This is Tim Ferriss.

56
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:25.420
Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.
And every episode,

57
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.560
as you may know,

58
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.550
it is my job to deconstruct world class performers to try to seize out.

59
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.800
She's out.
I'm not sure if that was English,
the habits,
the morning routines,

60
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:37.360
the influences,
the favorite books,

61
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.170
etc. That have made them so exceptionally good at what they do.

62
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:43.570
And that ranges from the Arnold Swartz,
niggers of the world,

63
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:47.740
literally to Jon Favreau to stand up,
comedians,
athletes,

64
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.310
musicians,
chess prodigies,
everyone in between.

65
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:55.960
And today we have a tattoo to heretic Richard Bets.

66
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.200
He's known for wine and whiskey.
Why is that?
Well,

67
00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:03.040
Richard Bets served as the wine director at the little Nell,
very,

68
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:07.390
very famous spot and Aspen from 2000 to 2008 but that's not so interesting

69
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:08.560
compared to the next point,

70
00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:13.220
which is Richard passed the court of Master [inaudible] master exams.

71
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.150
So becoming a master lea on his very first attempt,

72
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.260
and that's meant he was only the ninth person in history to do so.

73
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.790
And I first met Richard through the investing mastermind.

74
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.350
Vonda Kinte himself,

75
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:30.430
Chris Sacca who will no doubt be the most successful venture capitalist of all

76
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:34.360
time if things keep going as we see them moving.

77
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:38.080
And I also had him on the podcast and Richard and I hit it off immediately.

78
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.100
He can help train your senses for anything including wine whiskey,

79
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.310
his current obsession of mezcal and far beyond that.

80
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.430
He's also done a ton of experimentation,
gotten a lot of tattoos,

81
00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:52.750
almost been shot in Mexico and uh,
developed along the way and incredibly,

82
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.200
incredibly uncanny lot of adverbs in this intro to simplify the complex.

83
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:02.020
So we get along.
He's very good at deconstructing and simplifying himself.

84
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.080
And in this conversation we talk about nearly everything imaginable,

85
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.510
ranging from the value of quitting a,

86
00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.480
I didn't expect this to be such a big part of his story,

87
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.800
but from that to tricks of the trade,
meaning related to tasting wine,

88
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.090
the test itself,

89
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:21.091
travel tips because he travels something like 300 plus days a year and starter

90
00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:25.030
wines,
all sorts of things.
We also,
as we are doing the interview,

91
00:05:25.031 --> 00:05:28.030
drink a boatload of whiskey.
I taste,

92
00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:33.031
he teaches and I have pictures on the blog post or in the blog posts that show

93
00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:36.130
you what Richard looks like,
what we drank,
et cetera.

94
00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:39.490
So that that may be a good visual reference for you.
So just go a four hour work,

95
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:42.460
week.com,
forward slash podcast all spelled out,

96
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.970
or it's got a four hour work week.com and click on podcast and you will find

97
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.960
Richard,
uh,
the,
uh,
the whiskeys were amazing.

98
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.640
And a side note,
by the way,
maybe you didn't know this,
that it's whiskey,

99
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.620
w,
h,
I s K,

100
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.010
e y when it's from countries that have an e in their names such as America,

101
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.270
but it's whiskey,
w,
h,
I,
s,
k,
y without any,

102
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.450
when the country names don't have any.
That is the,

103
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:12.260
where the origin is of the given whiskey.
So Scotland,
Japan,

104
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:16.190
that's whiskey without me.
Richard taught me that among many,
many other things.

105
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.230
So last but not least,

106
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:22.520
I must say it because I love it and I've already given it out as a gift.
A,

107
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:24.230
Richard is the author of brand new book,

108
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.950
the essential scratch and sniff guide to becoming a whiskey.
No,
it all,

109
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.100
which is sitting right in front of me with whiskey stands all over it.

110
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.980
It distills,
see what I did there.

111
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:36.950
A couple of lifetimes worth of study down to 24 pages.

112
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:41.510
It's super short and I shook it out at the very least it gives you a bunch of

113
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:42.201
rules of thumb,

114
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:45.680
like the whiskey whiskey trick with the e versus knowing so that you can impress

115
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:48.410
your friends and not look like a dumb ass at the bar,

116
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:52.310
which is pretty awesome because less dumb ass and more smart ass always good.

117
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.000
So with that said,
and without further ado,

118
00:06:57.001 --> 00:06:59.750
some of you have given me shit online for saying without further ado,

119
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:01.970
and then talking for another two minutes like I'm doing right now.

120
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.410
So without further ado,
please enjoy my conversation with Richard Bets.

121
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.220
Richard,
welcome to the show.
Thanks to him.
Good to be here.
Yeah man,

122
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.030
it's been a little while since we hung out.
Has Been,
and uh,

123
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.920
let's start at the beginning.
For those people who don't know you,
why wine,

124
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.090
how did you get into wine?
And

125
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.550
<v 2>I got into wine,
um,
because of my seventh grade German teacher,</v>

126
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.680
Mrs Mrs Pritchard,
and she was,
she's a total bitch.
Um,

127
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.430
and I didn't learn anything about German in seventh grade,
but I did learn.
Um,

128
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.700
and sometimes I'm slow to digest the lesson,

129
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.530
but I definitely learned that you gotta do what you love.
So I walked in,

130
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.430
I walked into class that day and um,
first is cool.
I was like,

131
00:07:48.431 --> 00:07:50.670
this lady is intense and I don't like this subject.

132
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.340
And I didn't go and it didn't matter.
And at that,

133
00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:56.050
I did know at that time that it just didn't matter.

134
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.020
Like if I don't go to the class,
the other class I never went to with typing,

135
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.680
just not doing it,
just not doing it.
Um,

136
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.870
I don't have the student council hall passes,
Let,
let you screw off like that,

137
00:08:04.871 --> 00:08:08.860
you know,
20 some years ago.
But,
um,
it was,

138
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.890
it felt great at the time.
Felt bad at the time,
but,

139
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.950
and I didn't understand the larger lesson and I'll put it,

140
00:08:14.951 --> 00:08:19.900
came back to me over over time where I went to school and we talks at home and

141
00:08:19.901 --> 00:08:22.060
did my undergraduate work there and just struggled,
you know,

142
00:08:22.061 --> 00:08:25.180
is what did you study Undergrad?
I tried a lot of things.
Uh,

143
00:08:25.181 --> 00:08:30.181
I went with the idea of doing marine biology specifically and the whole biology

144
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.960
department was populated by young kids that didn't really have an interest in

145
00:08:34.961 --> 00:08:35.351
biology.

146
00:08:35.351 --> 00:08:38.470
They had an interest in going to med school and when you grade on the curve,

147
00:08:38.471 --> 00:08:40.000
that means that intense things happen.

148
00:08:40.001 --> 00:08:43.930
Like your slides are broken and it's very cutthroat,
backstabbing.
I was like,

149
00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:48.310
this is just anathema to everything that I believe in and how I want to live.

150
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:53.830
Um,
so bailed on that and then had this wild hair that I should study econ.

151
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.400
And that was just foolish.
That was all so boring.

152
00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.930
And so they went to poly psy and ended up with a minor in Poli Sci.
But,

153
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.600
and that was interesting and that's kind of how the world turns and was as cool.

154
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:06.540
But I need to be outdoors.
And that was,

155
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:08.310
that's really my compass is being outdoors.

156
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:12.560
I don't think I wore shoes until I was five.
Um,
and,

157
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.680
and so I found my way to the geology school,
you know,

158
00:09:15.681 --> 00:09:18.620
and it's definitely not rocks for jocks there.
Um,
that's a,

159
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.370
that's a funny thing that should be dispelled at some point.
Um,

160
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:26.290
but it's actually jocks meeting and easy way for the jocks to pass trek.

161
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.031
Totally.

162
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:30.600
So the lesson then from the German class was you could opt out of things that

163
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:35.450
you disliked.
He exactly.
Totally.
You know what,
I'm just not doing that.
And so,
um,

164
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.300
geology was great.
Got me outside again,
got me out of Los Angeles,

165
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:41.730
which was awesome.
I mean,
I love La.
I love being there.

166
00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:45.210
Then I like being there now,
but you know,
I need to spend time outdoors.

167
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:47.790
And if you're in the middle of Los Angeles as a student,
it's kind of,
you know,

168
00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:52.740
it's hard to do.
Um,
so geology was the thing.

169
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.210
And then,
um,
I took a break from it blow off my senior year.
I lived in Italy.

170
00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.940
Um,
all my friends thought I was a nut.
It is great.

171
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.430
And then after my own heart and I was on the five year plan,
awesome.

172
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:07.050
That was great.
Um,
came back,
finished and um,

173
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.740
I really wanted to do environmental law.
That was really a thing.
So I thought,

174
00:10:10.741 --> 00:10:13.470
well,
if I'm not a marine biologist,
I want to work to conserve this stuff.

175
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.230
You know,
how do we do this?
Well,
I thought,
well,

176
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:20.310
I think one approach could be to speak the language of the scientific community.

177
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.570
Take that the law school,

178
00:10:21.571 --> 00:10:24.270
then speak the language of the legal community and do your job well.

179
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.520
So I went and did a graduate thesis in Paleo Fluvial Morphology.

180
00:10:29.521 --> 00:10:32.820
So ancient river system makeup.
Is that what that translates to?

181
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.790
What was this like?
I'm worth fluvial fluvial that's the river part.

182
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.670
And it wasn't,
it wasn't so much about that topic at hand.

183
00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:41.970
It was about digging deep in the scientific method and what it means to be an

184
00:10:41.971 --> 00:10:45.270
investigator at that level.
Um,
and that was great.

185
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.440
I did find,
um,
through that time that the farther you go with it,

186
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.660
the smaller the scale.
At which you investigate.
So,
you know,

187
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:58.320
I spend a lot of time in a small dark hot room with a scanning electron

188
00:10:58.321 --> 00:11:00.360
microscope.
And this is what I'm in,
you know,

189
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.360
during the summers I'm living in Flagstaff,
Arizona,
which is beautiful.
I mean,

190
00:11:03.361 --> 00:11:06.540
right next to the Grand Canyon.
It's amazing.
I didn't see any of it,
you know,

191
00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:11.470
cause you're in the lab.
So that was that,
that was happening simultaneously.
Um,

192
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.560
I was clerking at a small firm there.
I clerked for,

193
00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:19.380
for my senator and on Capitol Hill,
Dennis Deconcini from Arizona.
Um,

194
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:24.280
I clerked at Skadden,
arps and the world's largest law firm because big,

195
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.230
uh,
big Kahuna.
Totally.
Um,
that was when I was in la.

196
00:11:28.231 --> 00:11:31.590
And then when I was in Grad School in Flagstaff,

197
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.630
I was clerking for a small environmental firm.

198
00:11:33.631 --> 00:11:37.950
And I found it didn't matter whether you were doing environmental or you're

199
00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:40.590
doing bankruptcy,
it was the same board,

200
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:44.040
like the monopoly board making the same motions,
you know,
past park place.

201
00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:48.090
Every time you just traded the hat for the shoe or whatever your piece was,

202
00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:51.870
you know,
it's still the same game.
Right.
And I found I didn't like the game.

203
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.700
And so I was really ripe for this moment.

204
00:11:54.701 --> 00:11:58.720
And this is what brought back Mrs Pritchard and seventh grade is that at the end

205
00:11:58.721 --> 00:12:03.340
of a,
of a very long day with that scan electron microscope,
um,

206
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.840
it was,
I was bout to be thesis defense weekends,

207
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.290
a couple of days in advance of this moment.
Um,
I walked out and I was,

208
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:14.240
I was just not feeling it.
Um,
thesis was great.
I was ready to defend it.
Uh,

209
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.620
and I was supposed to go to law school six weeks later.
So,
uh,

210
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:22.600
I walked out of the lab,
I hopped over the fence and ran across,
what is route 66,

211
00:12:22.601 --> 00:12:26.260
they're in Flagstaff to a small restaurant slash wine store.

212
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.450
And I walked in and I didn't know anything about wine.

213
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.070
I just know that I drank it on the daily and in Italy and how much that meant to

214
00:12:33.071 --> 00:12:36.940
me.
And I walked in and I bought totally based on site and I was like,

215
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.140
I kind of recognize that label and I pull off the shelf and I took it home and I

216
00:12:41.141 --> 00:12:43.870
popped the cork and I poured a glass.
And that first smell,

217
00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.680
that first smell took me back to a moment that I had lived almost four years

218
00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:49.090
earlier when living in Italy.

219
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:53.380
And I remembered a dinner I had had specifically at the Australia Ching Galley

220
00:12:53.381 --> 00:12:56.170
Bianco,
which is on board vote,
was on Jaco and Florence.

221
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.920
And I remember where I sat and where my compaigns sat and what she ate and what

222
00:12:59.921 --> 00:13:03.040
she wore and what I eat and what the waitress did right and wrong that night.

223
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:06.070
And all that just came rushing back from one smell.

224
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:11.550
And the next day I was describing this experience to a friend,

225
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.380
um,
really good friend,
best friend in life,
actually,
uh,

226
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.890
Bobby Stuckey and who was getting into food,
wine himself.
And I said,
you know,

227
00:13:17.891 --> 00:13:18.131
Bobby,

228
00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:21.350
I don't want to go to law school and I don't want to do the science anymore

229
00:13:21.351 --> 00:13:24.310
longer.
I want to do food wine.
And he's like,
well you should.
I was like,

230
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.710
well then I will.
And so I walked back to the firm.

231
00:13:26.711 --> 00:13:30.010
I was supposed to be an illegal library at that point on someone's billable
hour,

232
00:13:30.011 --> 00:13:33.370
which wasn't happening.
Um,
so walk with a permanent and I quit.
Um,

233
00:13:33.371 --> 00:13:36.400
I did defend my thesis cause then it was that week.
Um,

234
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:37.390
but I call it law school and said,
look,

235
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:42.190
I'm not coming and hopped off the cliff and got into food and wine.
And that was,

236
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.790
that was a big moment.
You know,
your parents,
everyone has expectations for you.

237
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.840
He's like,
you know what,
I'm just not doing,
it just doesn't feel good.
Did

238
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.090
<v 0>what else in your family have that,</v>

239
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.400
that confidence or compunction?
My dog is,

240
00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.350
is Klein the bottom of her crate just for,

241
00:13:59.351 --> 00:14:01.240
for notice her and will reason for enjoyment really.

242
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:06.250
Was there anyone else in your family who
had that ability to show,

243
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.370
to switch gears and to quit?

244
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.980
Not In such a negative connotation,

245
00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:14.770
but in the w in the sense of changing directions.
Did you,

246
00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:17.100
did you get that from anywhere else?
You know,
I,
I

247
00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:22.220
<v 2>has to have come from my parents,
I think,
but they,
they switched gears</v>

248
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:27.410
in to me a much more impressive way and they both came from very,

249
00:14:27.411 --> 00:14:31.820
very tough places.
Um,
you know,
complete poverty,

250
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:34.430
very rough,
particularly in my father's case,

251
00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:38.900
very nomadic in my mother's case and her large family.
Where did they grow up?

252
00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.120
Um,
my mom all over the eastern seaboard,

253
00:14:41.121 --> 00:14:45.710
but really settled in Syracuse in my father in Syracuse.

254
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:50.660
Um,
and his dad was a really rough dude.
Yeah.
You know,
it's treat brawls,

255
00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.650
nickels,
his fist and drugs,
alcohol,
all kinds of intense stuff.

256
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:59.410
Um,
and so they,
I mean,
they're the people I'm most proud of to,

257
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:03.890
to come from such intense circumstances like that be the first of your families

258
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.420
ever to go to college and then make your way out west and actually make your
way.

259
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:12.200
I mean,
that's,
that's,
they definitely change relative to what came before them.

260
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.480
So heroes in a different way.

261
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.930
<v 0>What did your,
what did your parents do when you were growing up?
So my mom,</v>

262
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.360
<v 2>um,
educator and she ran for a long time,</v>

263
00:15:23.361 --> 00:15:27.800
something called the teenage parent program,
which gave kids an opportunity.

264
00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:30.810
If you were pregnant,
you could stay in school.
Um,

265
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.040
they had a daycare facility in the school and this is everything from sixth

266
00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:38.390
graders through high school.
Um,
so when you can bring your kids as cool but two,

267
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.270
you actually are in school and you graduate in three,

268
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.670
learn how to take care of your kid at the same time.
So she really,

269
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.370
she kept so many kids in school,
which is huge.
Just huge.
Yeah.
Um,

270
00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.080
she eventually made her way to the University of Arizona.
Um,

271
00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:55.760
and she did her phd and then ended up as a researcher there at the U of a and my

272
00:15:55.761 --> 00:15:56.220
dad,

273
00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:00.980
a biomedical engineer at the University Hospital there has his whole life.

274
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.370
<v 0>So I can see now we're,
I'm skipping ahead in my own mind,</v>

275
00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:09.371
but I can see how the sort of biomedical engineer scientist aspect and the

276
00:16:10.911 --> 00:16:14.570
educator aspect tie pretty neatly into a lot of what you do now.
Totally.

277
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.400
But I'm skipping ahead.
I don't want to,

278
00:16:16.401 --> 00:16:19.070
I don't want to give away too much of the middle of the movie,

279
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:23.630
so we'll go back to the beginning.
So you decide law.
Thanks.

280
00:16:23.631 --> 00:16:24.810
But no thanks.
Yup.

281
00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.840
Food and beverage then what and how old were you at the time?

282
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:33.880
<v 2>So just finishing Grad School in 96.</v>

283
00:16:33.881 --> 00:16:37.420
I'm 25.
And um,
you know,

284
00:16:37.421 --> 00:16:39.850
I always think that I'm somewhat late to the party.
You know,

285
00:16:39.851 --> 00:16:43.690
like people decide I'm into food wine when they're like 18,
17,
16.

286
00:16:43.691 --> 00:16:46.660
And you see it as very young people into it today and that's great.

287
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.320
I'm always slow to make my decision.
Um,

288
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.420
but when it's made it happens.
And so we moved.
Um,

289
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.470
I just gotten married to my first wife,
uh,

290
00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:00.370
at the time we moved to Missoula,
Montana,

291
00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:05.410
not known as a bastion of great food or wine.
No offense.

292
00:17:05.411 --> 00:17:07.510
If there are any Montanans out,
there's all,
I've eaten very well.

293
00:17:07.511 --> 00:17:09.170
They're very frequently.
But,
um,

294
00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:12.040
if you want to go learn about this stuff is probably not the best place to do
it.

295
00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:13.450
But,
uh,

296
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:16.750
my first wife had gotten a tenure track job at the University of Montana job

297
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.960
tenure track or tenure track job at the University of Montana,

298
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.950
not unlike the legal profession.
And so wisely.
Yup.
Sign up and here it is.

299
00:17:23.951 --> 00:17:27.400
Here's your life before you.
Um,
that's an intense thought.

300
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:32.880
So we moved there and I worked in all kinds of places,

301
00:17:33.311 --> 00:17:33.581
but the,

302
00:17:33.581 --> 00:17:37.780
the first place I worked and cooked was I walked into the Red Lion Motor Inn,

303
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:41.880
which in 1996 was for sure the nicest restaurant in town,
you know,
and,

304
00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.260
and it was a motor and you park your car in front of your room,

305
00:17:44.261 --> 00:17:48.850
that kind of place.
Um,
so I walked in and there is a master chef,

306
00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.630
which is a real designation.
Um,
I think it means,

307
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.750
it means you can do all kinds of things including put on a brunch for like 3000

308
00:17:54.751 --> 00:17:57.750
people and carve the hell out of a block of ice and turned into a swan or

309
00:17:57.751 --> 00:18:02.570
something.
But,
um,
that,
that's a real thing.
And I walked in and his name was,

310
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:07.380
was Hans and Hans said,
Oh,
you want to learn to cook?
Huh,
okay,
yeah,
sure.
Here,

311
00:18:07.381 --> 00:18:10.770
hold this.
And he puts an egg pan in my hand,
a little Saute Pan,
I'm holding it.

312
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.970
And he slaps a piece of toast in it and he says,
flip it.
And I flip it.
He says,

313
00:18:14.971 --> 00:18:18.750
great,
you're the breakfast cook for the whole hotel,

314
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:21.300
whole hotel.

315
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:27.050
And so we're really working on our super hippy mantra at that time.
Um,

316
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.350
which meant no car,
nothing automated riding bikes,

317
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.810
which is great in the summer,
you know,
and that,
that's the,

318
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.890
that's the big like bait and switch with Montana is that summer's Eden and

319
00:18:37.891 --> 00:18:40.480
winter is the opposite.
Um,

320
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:45.330
so October came and the sun went away and uh,
you know,

321
00:18:45.331 --> 00:18:48.560
then you're on your bike at 4:00 AM and the snow and the bitter cold peddling.

322
00:18:48.561 --> 00:18:51.870
And to open up this huge hotel and cook breakfast for everybody.

323
00:18:51.871 --> 00:18:56.040
And it was thrilling.
It was be,
remains one of my favorite jobs ever.
Um,

324
00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.650
you know,
it's a funny point in life when you don't,

325
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:03.270
you don't really have the same stake in things as you do later in life.

326
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:04.980
Um,
so it was great.
Like,
yeah,

327
00:19:04.981 --> 00:19:07.080
I'm going to open this thing up and you've a flat top,
you know,

328
00:19:07.081 --> 00:19:10.200
like that flat griddle you cook on that's 20 feet long.
Wow.

329
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:13.560
Rocking eight waffle irons and you're cooking oven,
you know,

330
00:19:13.561 --> 00:19:16.530
by the sheet pan in the back.
And you know,
while you're doing that,

331
00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:19.230
you're steering though it's,
and getting the whole thing ready,
just open up.

332
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:23.100
Then you open that huge line by yourself and the order start flooding in.

333
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.790
And I think I'm a big believer that in the restaurant business you either have

334
00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:30.630
the synapse or you don't,
it doesn't mean you're a good person or bad person,

335
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.630
but it does mean you either shouldn't be in the business or you shouldn't be in

336
00:19:33.631 --> 00:19:37.660
the business.
And you mean like back of the house,
like boom,
boom,
boom,

337
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:42.340
multitasking.
Exactly.
Order sequencing and all of that timing,
etc. Yeah,
it's a,

338
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:45.100
it's a real thing.
It's tough.
Yeah.
Um,

339
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:49.080
and some people find it thrilling and do it really well and some people find it

340
00:19:49.081 --> 00:19:51.900
thrilling and don't do it really well.
And some people don't find it either,

341
00:19:51.901 --> 00:19:55.680
you know?
Um,
but if,
if you've have that in an imagine,

342
00:19:55.681 --> 00:20:00.000
some of you that are listening do you,
it's thrilling and I loved it.
What,

343
00:20:00.001 --> 00:20:03.330
what is a way that someone who hasn't worked in that type of circumstance?

344
00:20:03.331 --> 00:20:05.580
I've worked in restaurants,
I worked in restaurants for many summers,

345
00:20:05.581 --> 00:20:06.630
but I was never,

346
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.360
I was never on the line are cooking in the back or anything like that.

347
00:20:09.361 --> 00:20:11.250
And I was always from the house as a bus boy or whatnot,

348
00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:14.580
getting abused by patrons.
But the,
uh,

349
00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.170
you can get that to you in the back of the house.

350
00:20:16.171 --> 00:20:20.190
But what if someone wanted to try to predict if they would be good and that type

351
00:20:20.191 --> 00:20:24.840
of environment,
what are characteristics or experiences or traits?

352
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.470
Like if you had to pick some of you do recruit for the back of the house,

353
00:20:28.471 --> 00:20:30.500
but you couldn't test them in the back of the house?
I would,

354
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:35.450
I would look for someone who,
um,
for sure can handle stress,
uh,

355
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.150
because everyone around you has the possibility to just totally lose it.

356
00:20:39.151 --> 00:20:41.400
And if they start freaking out,
are you going to freak out with them?

357
00:20:41.401 --> 00:20:44.970
And then the whole ship thing.
So,
so stress management's huge.
Um,

358
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:47.770
this seems silly,
but you gotta be able to deal with the heat,

359
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:51.910
like the physical heat.
Later,
a few years later I had a,

360
00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:55.330
or a year later I had a different cooking job and standing in front of,

361
00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.900
I was Greer Danesh means he worked the grill and standing between the grill on

362
00:20:58.901 --> 00:21:01.670
the line and have the little pocket thermometer in my,

363
00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:05.890
my chef's coat pocket and he'd read 130 degrees all night long.

364
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.850
It was a real thing.
It's really,
really warm and some of these places,

365
00:21:09.851 --> 00:21:11.830
so you've got to do with eat,
you have to deal with the stress,

366
00:21:11.831 --> 00:21:15.280
the pressure and keep cool.
And you have to be able to multitask,
you know?

367
00:21:15.281 --> 00:21:20.180
I mean if you,
if you get,
if you were like a,
a myopic thinker,
it's not for you.

368
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:22.300
But if you can say,
I'm doing this,
I'm doing this.

369
00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:25.450
And meanwhile you have all these little timers going off in your head,
you know,

370
00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:27.440
it probably means you don't sleep well all the time.
Um,

371
00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.840
I'm that guy woke up three times last night just thinking about stuff.
Right.

372
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:34.840
And it doesn't bother me,
you know,
it just is.
Um,
so those,

373
00:21:34.841 --> 00:21:35.950
those would be the three things.

374
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.270
So you're in Montana biking through October,

375
00:21:40.271 --> 00:21:44.900
snow to open up the line.
What,
what did you like about that?
I mean,
what,

376
00:21:44.901 --> 00:21:48.850
what excited you about that?
The pace for sure.
Um,
you know,

377
00:21:48.851 --> 00:21:53.590
it was really important to me,
Tim,
is that,
um,
it was on the job learning.

378
00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:57.580
And so before,
before I actually got that first job,
we got to Montana,
I was like,

379
00:21:57.581 --> 00:21:57.851
okay,

380
00:21:57.851 --> 00:22:00.310
well I guess I'm going to figure this out or am I going to take time off and

381
00:22:00.311 --> 00:22:01.860
then go to culinary school?
And I was like,
you know what,

382
00:22:01.861 --> 00:22:06.250
I've done a lot of school,
right?
And I'm kind of done with that.
A lot of prep,

383
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:10.720
a ton of prep,
let's do something.
And so I went and talked to a chef and I said,

384
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:11.830
hey man,
this is what I'm thinking about.

385
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:15.220
Like I'm either going to like ask you for a job or,
um,

386
00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.460
this was after I was already working at the red line in,
uh,
I mean,

387
00:22:18.461 --> 00:22:20.980
they're gonna ask you for a job or I'm thinking about culinary school.

388
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.420
And he's like,
well,
here's the deal.

389
00:22:22.421 --> 00:22:26.680
You can come here today and you can ask me for a job.
And I'll say,
yeah,
great.

390
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:30.340
Here are the potatoes and get peeling.
Or you can go to culinary school,

391
00:22:30.341 --> 00:22:33.790
spend two more years of your life preparing,
spending,
you know,
30,

392
00:22:33.791 --> 00:22:36.070
40 grand a year in bills to be there.

393
00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.410
Then you can come to me and asked me for a job and I'll say,
yeah,
sure.
Here's,

394
00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:43.770
here's a,
you know,
big pot of potatoes.
Get peeling.
Same thing up to you.
Yeah.

395
00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:48.430
Same,
same.
Like,
okay,
I,
I'm,
I'm pretty good at math.
I got this,

396
00:22:48.431 --> 00:22:53.410
we're the potatoes.
Let's do it.
That simple.
Yeah,
no,
that makes perfect sense.

397
00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:58.570
And when,
when then did the,
the,
the nectar of the gods,

398
00:22:58.571 --> 00:23:02.290
when did the wine entered the picture?
Yeah,
so I was,
um,

399
00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.580
while in the kitchen I was always reading about wine.

400
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:11.700
I knew that I wanted to do both cook and work as a similar Yay.
Um,

401
00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.820
I thought working in the back of the house made the most sense to start.
Um,

402
00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:19.000
I do like that self reliance of really learning how to feed yourself and feed

403
00:23:19.001 --> 00:23:23.240
others and you know,
make your table warm and interesting.
That matters to me.
Um,

404
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:27.980
so I started there but all the while read,
read,
read,
taste,
taste,
taste.
And um,

405
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:32.830
I had an early mentor who said,
beg,
borrow,
steal,
but taste,
taste,
taste.

406
00:23:32.831 --> 00:23:34.000
And that's,
that's the everything.

407
00:23:34.001 --> 00:23:37.180
If you don't have a context and we'll talk more about that later,

408
00:23:37.181 --> 00:23:38.380
but if you don't have a context,
you don't,

409
00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:41.020
you don't have any framework within which to hold anything together.

410
00:23:41.021 --> 00:23:45.190
Even accumulate knowledge.
You've got to have a context.
Context,
meaning,
uh,

411
00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.230
like the,
like having the letters of the alphabet to spell words,

412
00:23:48.231 --> 00:23:52.940
having just like the descriptors that you can only acquire through developing a

413
00:23:52.941 --> 00:23:56.390
database of exactly that.
Different flavors actually that,
yeah,

414
00:23:56.391 --> 00:23:59.840
I mean it was actually no different than geology.

415
00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:03.350
You only know what sandstone is because it relates to mudstone and it's more

416
00:24:03.351 --> 00:24:03.921
coarse grain.

417
00:24:03.921 --> 00:24:06.560
And you know that mudstone is only mudstone because it's more coarse grained

418
00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:09.140
than siltstone.
Yeah.
So on and so forth.
It was not to geek out on,
but yeah,

419
00:24:09.141 --> 00:24:13.310
it's just how things relate to each other.
Um,
so I was taste,
taste tasting.

420
00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:18.680
We left Montana about 11 months later,
almost to the day.
Um,
cause we,

421
00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.560
we moved there,
we bought a house and old house remodeled it.

422
00:24:21.561 --> 00:24:24.050
The Sun went away as I said.
And uh,

423
00:24:24.051 --> 00:24:27.050
I'm a solar powered kid growing up in the southwest.
Um,

424
00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:32.410
so that house was sold before the sun came out in May and we moved to Tucson

425
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:38.030
where I worked for the second chef.
I cooked for him,
really loved Alan Zeeman,

426
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:42.420
who's,
if you didn't use a rubber spatula to get the gloss,
you know,

427
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:46.460
the intense beef protein that you worked on two days to reduce down from beef

428
00:24:46.461 --> 00:24:48.980
bones.
If he didn't use a rubber spatula to get that out of the Pan,

429
00:24:48.981 --> 00:24:51.170
he would dock your pay check and make you make soap.

430
00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:56.840
It was a real learning experience.
You made everything.
Nothing came in a box.

431
00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.000
Um,
so while I worked for him,

432
00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:01.520
that's where I had this Greer damn position where you're on the grill and it was

433
00:25:01.521 --> 00:25:02.750
130 degrees all night.

434
00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:07.250
It was also that where the waiters had to walk by and they knew that I was

435
00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.210
really into wine.
So then they start asking questions like,
oh,
I know Richie,

436
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:12.080
you know,
the wine list.
And like,
what should I pair with this?

437
00:25:12.081 --> 00:25:12.980
What should I pay with that?

438
00:25:12.981 --> 00:25:16.310
So I became the sort of defacto volunteer similarly from the kitchen.

439
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:21.150
And had you been,
had you been acquiring,
uh,
tastes at that point?
Yup.

440
00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:25.480
I spending,
I mean,
still had basically no money.
You're earning minimum wage.
Um,

441
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:29.630
and I spent every dime I could on every bottle of wine I could find.
Yeah.

442
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:33.260
And so you bought,
how did you choose bottles to taste?

443
00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:38.260
Things I hadn't had before and in areas I wanted to explore.
So,
um,
you know,

444
00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:41.660
I don't drink much Chilean wine today,
but at that point I was like,
okay,

445
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:43.820
this people are talking about this.
So what is this about?

446
00:25:43.821 --> 00:25:46.190
So then it was a deep dive into to Chile,
like how do these,

447
00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.410
what are these things about how they relate to each other?

448
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:50.420
He's this one just an outlier or does it,

449
00:25:50.421 --> 00:25:54.410
how does it fit in the context of the whole,
really very methodical about that.

450
00:25:54.411 --> 00:25:58.970
So you thought you then categorize mostly geographically yes.

451
00:25:58.971 --> 00:26:02.120
In the beginning.
Yep.
Yeah.
Well that makes sense.
I mean,
it gives you,

452
00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:07.550
it gives you at least a plan for starting,
right?
Totally.
Much as you can,

453
00:26:07.551 --> 00:26:11.420
like compartmentalize in an orderly way so you're not just helter skelter trying

454
00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.900
capriciously this wine after the next.
Exactly.
Exactly.
And ultimately wine,

455
00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:21.530
the intellectual value of wine comes from this idea of terroir and terroir.

456
00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:22.880
It's a French word for this,

457
00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:27.380
this notion that everything that makes up the wine makes up the place that goes

458
00:26:27.381 --> 00:26:28.820
into the wine is this idea of terroir.

459
00:26:28.821 --> 00:26:30.890
So you should pick up a glass and it should reflect,

460
00:26:30.891 --> 00:26:35.180
reflect a place just like that ordinary bottle of soil,
the climate,
the end,

461
00:26:35.181 --> 00:26:38.690
the barometric farm down the road and everything.
Everything goes in there.

462
00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.230
And so I mean that's what got me into it in the first place.
You know,

463
00:26:42.231 --> 00:26:44.730
because I picked up that bottle of wine,
I didn't know anything about it,

464
00:26:44.731 --> 00:26:48.990
but that sensory memory got me to blow off law school.
Right?
So,

465
00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:53.040
so I kept on that path like,
okay,
well what is it about this place that makes,

466
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:55.050
you know,
that's a common thread amongst these wines.

467
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.300
Be at Merlo or Cabernet or whatever it may be.
And,

468
00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:01.830
and when you can take that trip and a glass of wine that that's the intellectual

469
00:27:01.831 --> 00:27:03.360
value,
that's the part that matters.

470
00:27:03.361 --> 00:27:07.080
And how I convince myself I'm getting smarter when I'm drinking.
And so your,

471
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:11.100
so your waitstaff start asking you questions and you're on the line.

472
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.640
I'm on the line cooking,
like do this,
do that.
And you know,

473
00:27:14.641 --> 00:27:17.910
it was like a free swing because I didn't have to face the guests,

474
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:21.600
I didn't have any consequences and totally practice without God's got to see

475
00:27:21.601 --> 00:27:25.440
what,
what might a question be that w like a waiter would ask what,

476
00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:30.090
what goes with this entree?
Yeah.
Or Hey,
you know,
your special tonight.
Like how,

477
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.350
where's the acid at?

478
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:34.320
Like is it going to work with the Soviet block or is it lower acid and I should

479
00:27:34.321 --> 00:27:38.500
use chardonnay?
Or Hey,
I saw you put Sarell with grapes and you know,

480
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:42.110
how is that going to work with this,
you know,
those sorts of things.
Cool.
Yeah.

481
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:47.250
Very cool.
Yeah,
it's super cool.
And then what them then,
um,

482
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.970
this was in Tucson and you're like,
well,
why would you go from Montana to Tucson,

483
00:27:50.971 --> 00:27:54.740
another place?
It's not necessarily known as a,
as a culinarily hot,
uh,

484
00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.710
important hotbed.
Um,

485
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:01.440
I went to Tucson after going to Portland and San Francisco both,

486
00:28:01.441 --> 00:28:06.210
and this is in 97,
97 98.
And,

487
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:11.100
um,
I believe in myself and really believe that,

488
00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:12.300
you know,
in,

489
00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:16.230
in my ability to make a decision to do something I love and then when I'm doing

490
00:28:16.231 --> 00:28:18.840
it,
then I'm going to put everything I have into it.
And in my,
the best at it,

491
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:22.690
I have no idea,
but I know I'll try harder than most.
Um,

492
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:24.570
so I went to Portland and it's like,
man,

493
00:28:24.571 --> 00:28:27.300
there's so many kids getting into the food scene that I'm just going to have to

494
00:28:27.301 --> 00:28:30.930
get in line with these kids.
And I went to San Francisco,
same story,

495
00:28:30.931 --> 00:28:35.470
like just super expensive to be here,
um,
although less,
less than now.
Um,

496
00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.190
but also just huge lines of kids competing for positions.

497
00:28:38.191 --> 00:28:41.160
And then there were two,
these two chefs that,
um,
I wanted to work for in Tucson.

498
00:28:41.161 --> 00:28:42.300
They were actually great,

499
00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.410
well regarded on national level and nobody wanted to move there to work with

500
00:28:46.411 --> 00:28:48.600
them.
So it was like,
I can get immediate access,

501
00:28:48.601 --> 00:28:51.300
supercharged my learning and my path.
And I did.

502
00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:55.200
So I went to that second chef and I said,
hey man,
I want to Yano someone to work,

503
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:59.190
work with you.
This is why I'm in Arizona.
And he said,
great,

504
00:28:59.191 --> 00:28:59.821
what have you been doing?

505
00:28:59.821 --> 00:29:03.450
I told him how about my work with the alzine and the other chef.
And he's like,

506
00:29:03.451 --> 00:29:05.160
okay,
cool.
Well why don't you audition?

507
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.890
And so you spend a week auditioning in the kitchen and doing all this different

508
00:29:07.891 --> 00:29:11.040
stuff.
The end of the week we sit down in his office and he was like,
okay,

509
00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:14.340
so I understand you've also been spending time learning about wine.
It was like,

510
00:29:14.341 --> 00:29:17.100
yeah,
yeah,
doing this and pass my first quarter master.

511
00:29:17.101 --> 00:29:21.310
So many A's exam and your first one court of Master sommeliers of masters of

512
00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:24.900
Court of exactly.
Yeah.
It's like,
it's a big mouthful like that.
Um,

513
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.680
which is a certifying body for some ways and it's therefore exams in the,

514
00:29:28.681 --> 00:29:29.670
in the process.

515
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.360
And I taken the first one while cooking at that first restaurant in Arizona.

516
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.510
So just so we can just,
so we can lay out that for people,

517
00:29:36.511 --> 00:29:37.530
what are the four tests?

518
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:42.950
There's an introductory lecture and exam and that's not a very hard test.

519
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.540
Um,
but you,
you have to know a little something.
Um,
if you're a quick learner,

520
00:29:46.541 --> 00:29:49.960
you can pick it all up in the lecture.
Then there's the certified,

521
00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:53.150
they give you a lecture and then they test you on what's in the lecture.
Yeah.

522
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.380
Got,
ideally you've read something before you get there are,
you know,

523
00:29:56.381 --> 00:30:00.310
you have more than a passing interest.
Um,
but it's,
uh,
it's,
uh,

524
00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:04.860
that's an course slashing seem,
that's very much meant to inspire.
Like,
hey,

525
00:30:04.861 --> 00:30:07.990
here's the cool world of wine and if you're into it,

526
00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:10.360
you're going to read about it,
check it out,

527
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.410
build yourself a plan to acquire the knowledge and then come back and see us for

528
00:30:14.411 --> 00:30:17.170
more exams as you go.
So,
so that's the first one.

529
00:30:17.171 --> 00:30:22.171
The second level is the certified exam because there is an organization that's

530
00:30:22.991 --> 00:30:25.840
called the court of Masters,
the court of Master sommeliers.
Okay.

531
00:30:25.841 --> 00:30:29.740
Court of Master sommeliers.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Um,
different than the master of wine.

532
00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:34.690
Those are there to,
um,
organizations are certifying bodies.

533
00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:38.770
Yeah.
To Patty anally for diving's.
Exactly.
It exactly it.

534
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.100
Which are you?
I am patty.
I'm the other.
Yeah.

535
00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:46.780
So this podcast is over now.
Um,

536
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.380
so anyways,
I'd taken it.
Oh yeah.
Right.

537
00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:53.890
So certified exam is the second step and that was necessary because people are

538
00:30:53.891 --> 00:30:55.720
like,
oh miss somebody,
Yay.
I passed the first exam.

539
00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:59.740
And just from the court's perspective,
and I'm,

540
00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.190
I'm not intimately involved with it,
um,
on day to day basis,

541
00:31:03.191 --> 00:31:07.960
but it people are going to use this as a,
this is the standard and I am now this.

542
00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.820
Then we felt like we actually ought to make it a real standard.

543
00:31:09.821 --> 00:31:10.720
So we inserted the,

544
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.770
the certified exam where you have to be proficient in certain elements of wine

545
00:31:14.771 --> 00:31:18.730
service and you know,
champagne service,
old decanting wine service,

546
00:31:18.731 --> 00:31:21.100
all these sorts of things.
Um,
so that's level two.

547
00:31:21.101 --> 00:31:24.640
Level three is the advanced exam,
which is indeed really,
really hard.

548
00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:26.470
And it's three days of examination.

549
00:31:26.471 --> 00:31:29.710
There's a blind tasting exam where you blind taste six wines.

550
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:30.970
And I don't mean blindfold,

551
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.790
you just walk into a room and there's six glasses with wine and them and you

552
00:31:33.791 --> 00:31:37.130
have no idea what they are until you sit down.
And get after it.
Um,

553
00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.640
so six months in,
25 minutes,
you know,
what are they,

554
00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.140
how specific do they expect you to yet?
I,
you know,
if it's,
um,

555
00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:48.880
Ridge Lytton springs,
infidel from 2010,
you should come up with,
hey,

556
00:31:48.881 --> 00:31:53.470
this is infidel,
California,
north coast,
2010.

557
00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.320
You should be,
you don't have to say rich,
but you got to get,

558
00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.820
you're not that far off.
Exactly.
Okay.
Um,
that's one part of the exam.

559
00:32:00.821 --> 00:32:05.020
The second part is a theory examination.
Anything,
um,
that you eat,

560
00:32:05.021 --> 00:32:09.970
drink or smoke could be on that exam.
That's a written paper.
Oh,

561
00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:14.940
it's a written paper.
Yeah.
Well,
pardon me.
Multiple choice or in some,
in some is,

562
00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:19.570
what would a hypothetical question on that,
what there's so many,
um,

563
00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:23.890
that we all are sworn that we'll never,
oh,
I gotta eat,
drink or smoke.

564
00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:26.700
Not A,
not a precise question.
We're just wondering like,

565
00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:30.720
you could it be something about pipes or cigarettes or smoking or,
uh,

566
00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:34.510
cigars predominantly.
And that's actually,
it's super DNF for that.

567
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:35.351
Deemphasize now.

568
00:32:35.351 --> 00:32:38.200
And I'm not even sure that there are test questions that deal with it any
longer.

569
00:32:38.201 --> 00:32:40.340
But at that time you need to know that she's,

570
00:32:40.341 --> 00:32:42.080
the guard service is actually done from the left side.

571
00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.320
Whereas everything else you've done in that test to that point,

572
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.990
wine service for example,
has done from the right side.
And you know,

573
00:32:47.991 --> 00:32:52.430
it's things like that ring gauges which is,
which is right is wine service,

574
00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:53.293
left leftist.

575
00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:58.250
And then memorizing ring gauges of cigar sizes and like things that are for me,

576
00:32:58.251 --> 00:33:00.380
completely worthless.
You know,
it's like the periodic table.

577
00:33:00.381 --> 00:33:03.350
I learned it for a moment and I forgot it the next day to make room for

578
00:33:03.351 --> 00:33:04.370
something different.
Let's say,

579
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.670
same thing about that with cigar ringside and that's the advanced,

580
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:10.520
well that's part two of the advanced part two.

581
00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.710
Part three of the advanced is actually service.

582
00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:16.770
So you walk into a room filled with um,
master som ways.

583
00:33:16.771 --> 00:33:20.240
Ostensibly it's a restaurant situation and you go from table to table and

584
00:33:20.241 --> 00:33:24.440
perform different tasks that you're asked to,
to do,
um,
and their heart.

585
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:28.760
And it's a real thing and it's amazing actually.
But,
um,

586
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.300
and then the fourth and final level is exactly that again.

587
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:35.210
But the volumes cranked all the way up.
And the,
uh,

588
00:33:35.211 --> 00:33:39.730
the theory portion is not written.
It's oral.
Is that,
got it.
Is that the masters?

589
00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.990
That's the masters familiar test.
Exactly.

590
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:45.620
There are just about 200 of us in the world today.

591
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.780
And you were the ninth person to pass it on your first attempt?
I was,
it's that,

592
00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:51.440
you know,

593
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.710
I just got done bagging on my opiate when it comes to working in the kitchen,

594
00:33:54.711 --> 00:33:59.330
but I definitely had myopia when it came to studying for that test.
We'll look,

595
00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:01.800
we'll come back to that.
So the,
so you,

596
00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:06.860
you're talking to the chef,
you want it to work for all along?
Yup.

597
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:09.740
And he's like,
so you've been getting into this wine stuff.
Yup.

598
00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:15.070
And you give him the replay having already past the first year level of

599
00:34:15.501 --> 00:34:20.030
examination.
Yup.
And then what?
And he says,
okay,
you cook well.

600
00:34:20.031 --> 00:34:23.840
So do you want to be the same way or do you want to cook?
I was like,

601
00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:26.240
you've never had a [inaudible].
He's like,
exactly right.

602
00:34:26.241 --> 00:34:28.960
We're going to move the restaurant to the foothills and it'd be a bigger space.

603
00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:32.180
We're going to have a 10,000 bottles seller and someone's got to fill it and

604
00:34:32.181 --> 00:34:34.910
sell it.
You want to do that?
And I was like,
I absolutely want to do.

605
00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:39.950
It was incredible.
First Godson.
Yeah,
it was amazing.
It was really amazing.

606
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:43.250
And you learn so much when you build your own list and you're responsible for

607
00:34:43.251 --> 00:34:45.530
budgets and you work for a chef owner who are,

608
00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:50.610
I mean chef owners are notoriously maniacal
and I'm friends with a lot of origin.

609
00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:55.310
Yeah,
it's true.
They are.
Um,
so that was an amazing experience.

610
00:34:55.311 --> 00:34:57.800
I'd walk in with my order sheet every week,
which is,
you know,

611
00:34:57.801 --> 00:34:59.810
he had the standardized or sheet,
this is what I want order,

612
00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.690
this is who it's from,
this is how much it costs,
how many bottles,
blah,
blah.

613
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:06.260
And it would be so well reasoned and I would have thought out everything and

614
00:35:06.261 --> 00:35:08.180
everything would have been researched from a point of view.

615
00:35:08.181 --> 00:35:11.330
Like how good is the wine?
How well is it going to age?
What if it doesn't sell?

616
00:35:11.331 --> 00:35:13.440
What's its trajectory?
Does it pair with the food?

617
00:35:13.441 --> 00:35:14.960
I guess asking for these sorts of things.

618
00:35:14.961 --> 00:35:18.380
I was totally armed to the hilt and I'd go in there and I hand it to him.

619
00:35:18.381 --> 00:35:21.620
He'd slide it across the desk to him and he'd sit there and put on his reading

620
00:35:21.621 --> 00:35:25.040
glasses and looked down and pull out a pen and just start crossing things out

621
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:29.390
without even asking questions.
It was brutal.
Brutal.

622
00:35:29.391 --> 00:35:33.470
Is it mostly pricing based the those that got crossed out and I think it was,

623
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:37.100
I think I approached that with the wrong philosophy.
Like I went,

624
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:40.920
this is exactly what we need and he probably thought I was coming with more.

625
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:44.550
No one ever get cut down to less,
which is what I ended up doing over time.

626
00:35:44.551 --> 00:35:45.560
So you learned the lesson,

627
00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:48.990
you learned to negotiate with the chef owner by actually bringing in a couple of

628
00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:52.980
gimmes that you're happy to let go.
It's totally real obvious ones.

629
00:35:52.981 --> 00:35:56.280
Expensive neon lights on them.
Right?
Right.
Yeah.
And just watch him.

630
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.830
When you said if they don't sell,

631
00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:02.490
does that mean just looking at return policies and things like that or how you

632
00:36:02.491 --> 00:36:06.240
would resell them?
How they would age,
how they would age Heatherwood eight.
Yeah.

633
00:36:06.241 --> 00:36:10.860
There's really no return policy,
you know,
in any real way.
So,

634
00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:13.710
and it's funny,
I'll go look at lists now and you'll be like,
wow,

635
00:36:13.711 --> 00:36:16.370
there's a whole bunch of,
you know,

636
00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:20.640
2004 California Sauvignon Blanc.
Well,
yeah,
that's probably,

637
00:36:20.641 --> 00:36:24.690
most of those are no good any longer because it's not something that from this

638
00:36:24.691 --> 00:36:28.290
particular place is known to age well,
and someone was enthusiastic for it.

639
00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:29.190
They bought a bunch,

640
00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:34.020
but in reality that restaurant only needed two or buy one,
sell it out.

641
00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:37.380
Then by the next like 20 Avocados at a time.
It's like,
that's exactly it.

642
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:39.850
That's exactly it,
you know?
But,
um,

643
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:44.580
if it's something that's meant to age or will improve and actually appreciate,

644
00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:48.300
then it's,
then it makes some sense to do it.
Yeah.
So you're building this list,

645
00:36:48.301 --> 00:36:53.130
you're getting wise to,
uh,
the sort of horse trading that you do with your boss.

646
00:36:53.131 --> 00:36:56.730
Yep.
Uh,
what do you,
what are the,

647
00:36:56.731 --> 00:36:59.100
what other things do you learn in that,

648
00:36:59.101 --> 00:37:04.101
in that first one or it's one of my most humiliating experiences as a some way.

649
00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:05.851
Uh,
I mean,

650
00:37:05.851 --> 00:37:10.650
I remember the first time I even the table table one 10 walked down the stairs,

651
00:37:10.651 --> 00:37:15.490
first one on the left and someone ordered a bottle of,
um,
Roman [inaudible].

652
00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.940
So can you say that again?
Roman?
A cold tea ashes though,

653
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
which today is fantastically expensive in 1999 or it could have been fall of

654
00:37:25.411 --> 00:37:29.190
[inaudible] 98 that was all like $448 on the wine list.

655
00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:32.940
And I was trembling and I remember going to the table and my hands were

656
00:37:32.941 --> 00:37:37.590
trembling and shaking and you know,
super nervous and,
and uh,
you know,

657
00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:42.270
since then I've served bottles that 50 grand or a hundred grand and 50 grand or

658
00:37:42.271 --> 00:37:46.050
a hundred grand and that all goes away.
But,
um,
but it was right,

659
00:37:46.051 --> 00:37:50.520
it was not shortly after I sold that vary that I'd be nervous of an a $450

660
00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:53.760
bottle of wine.
Yeah.
So that's not where the embarrassment came.

661
00:37:53.761 --> 00:37:56.450
But that was the first one.
And then it was like a week later,
you know,

662
00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:59.700
I was on a roll and we were selling these things that you know,
at a real clip,

663
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:00.930
really expensive things.

664
00:38:00.931 --> 00:38:05.931
And it was an 85 Berenger specialists or Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa on the

665
00:38:08.041 --> 00:38:10.440
table with an 85 Mouton Raul Shield,

666
00:38:10.441 --> 00:38:14.160
which is a first growth Bordeaux from France from the big deal,
five big deal.

667
00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.220
Chateau in Bordeaux recognizes one of the great wines of the world.

668
00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:20.610
And this guy had a table of six,
the order both bottles at once.

669
00:38:20.611 --> 00:38:23.660
He wanted him to serve side by side and they were just going to compare it,

670
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:24.630
enjoy these things.

671
00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:29.280
And so I decant them both and serve them both as he wishes.
And then,

672
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:30.330
I don't know,

673
00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:34.080
30 minutes later I go back to refill and of course I pour the Mouton on top of

674
00:38:34.081 --> 00:38:38.170
the Berenger
and I'm going,
Oh boy,

675
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.370
this is going to be horrible.

676
00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:42.910
And he just smiles and laughs and he looks at me and probably knows I have no

677
00:38:42.911 --> 00:38:45.460
possibility of paying for this whatsoever.

678
00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:48.840
And he couldn't have been more gracious about it and uh,

679
00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:51.820
I thought it was going to die at that moment.
It was for sure.
Because I mean,

680
00:38:51.821 --> 00:38:55.120
you come on how much we're both of those combined more than a thousand bucks.

681
00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:59.490
That's a lot.
It's a lot.
Yeah.
And 99 and young someway it's like,
oh,

682
00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:04.140
I shouldn't $169 on my suit.
There's my rent for the next four months.

683
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:05.350
Exactly.
The whole thing,

684
00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:09.340
the whole thing and he couldn't have been more gracious with was actually the

685
00:39:09.341 --> 00:39:11.530
real lesson.
And apart from like paying attention,

686
00:39:11.531 --> 00:39:15.480
it was really about what does it mean to be graceful and thoughtful and,

687
00:39:15.481 --> 00:39:18.040
and so on and so forth.
So that was,
that was an amazing moment.

688
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:23.910
I worked at that restaurant until 2000 and remember the guy who sold me that

689
00:39:25.481 --> 00:39:29.240
bottle of wine that changed my life in Flagstaff.
In Grad School?
Yeah.
Yeah.

690
00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:32.320
About 30 minutes ago.
The way you're talking about the bottle,

691
00:39:32.321 --> 00:39:35.890
that was across route 66 exactly.
That one.
In the meantime,

692
00:39:35.891 --> 00:39:40.120
he had gone to Aspen and taking the job with the little nail for sure.

693
00:39:40.121 --> 00:39:43.720
The worlds,
one of the world's best places to drink wine.
What was the name again?

694
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:46.420
The in at the little Nell or just the,
the little nail.

695
00:39:46.421 --> 00:39:50.650
Even just the nail it as it's commonly in ELL and ELL and Aspen,
Colorado,

696
00:39:50.651 --> 00:39:54.490
right at the base of the mountain and ski in,
ski out.
It's an amazing spot.

697
00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.960
Sounds incredible.
It's special.
Um,

698
00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.610
so he'd been to so many there and um,

699
00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:03.820
he was leaving to go become the same way at the French laundry and said,
hey,

700
00:40:03.821 --> 00:40:05.670
I'm leaving.
You should apply for my job.
I was like,
yeah,

701
00:40:05.671 --> 00:40:08.860
of course I'm gonna apply for a job.
Great.
And,
you know,
huge shoes to fill.

702
00:40:08.861 --> 00:40:11.840
I had no idea what it meant to be an aspen.
And I mean,

703
00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:16.530
the caliber of wine drinker at that time is like,
it's as big as it can be.
It,

704
00:40:16.531 --> 00:40:19.210
it doesn't get any bigger.
It's,
it's an amazing place.

705
00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:24.040
You mean in terms of the clientele,
Zachary,
like way over my head.

706
00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:28.000
Um,
but I applied for the job and I'm flying to Aspen and we do the whole dance

707
00:40:28.001 --> 00:40:31.570
there and I fly and meet the GM.
He's in Los Angeles for a day.

708
00:40:31.571 --> 00:40:35.120
We meet there and then the food and beverage director comes to Tucson and you

709
00:40:35.121 --> 00:40:39.130
know,
you saved your best suit all week for when she comes in and,
and uh,

710
00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.790
and it was great.
And I got the job.
I,

711
00:40:40.791 --> 00:40:43.360
they probably had no business giving it to me at that time,

712
00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:47.590
but I got the job as it's suddenly a slash wine buyer at the little Nell where I

713
00:40:47.591 --> 00:40:51.900
had no budget and had a ton of storage and everybody drinks everything.
And Yeah,

714
00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.340
we sold a lot of really great,
you said you had no budget,

715
00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:58.450
no budget by what you want and it was,
oh,
I see.
Okay.
Unlimited budget,

716
00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.490
unlimited budget.
There was no one crossing things out across the desk from,

717
00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:03.490
you just had to count it once a month,

718
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:07.930
which is also a reason not to go crazy.
But,
um,

719
00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:12.420
it was outrageous and it very quickly,
I mean,
I very quickly,

720
00:41:12.421 --> 00:41:15.820
I realized how big the shoes where I had to fill,
uh,
which is good.

721
00:41:15.821 --> 00:41:19.810
I very much respond to pressure.
Um,
you know,
it's like if you want to get fit,

722
00:41:19.811 --> 00:41:22.780
I signed up for an event,
I will run.
I don't want to suck.

723
00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:24.310
What were the pressures like what,

724
00:41:24.311 --> 00:41:27.340
what were some concrete realizations that you had?

725
00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:32.560
Almost all the guests knew more than I did and that was intense.
That's a lot.

726
00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:37.130
That's huge.
And so what that mean?
It means like sleepless nights,
read,
read,
read,

727
00:41:37.131 --> 00:41:40.530
read,
read,
read,
taste,
taste,
taste,
taste,
taste,
practice for the master Somme test.

728
00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:41.330
Exactly.

729
00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:44.780
And part of the tastings I did healthy education that's in a place I did have a

730
00:41:44.781 --> 00:41:47.060
budget quote unquote.
It was an education budget,

731
00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:50.870
open whatever you want and you know,
certain number over tasting.
Yeah.

732
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:55.040
So you can learn really quickly.
That's cool.
Yeah.
That came back to that.

733
00:41:55.370 --> 00:42:00.020
What is the right way to taste when you're given an opportunity to like that?

734
00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:03.320
Yeah,
I mean is there like palate fatigue?
Do you have to do,

735
00:42:03.321 --> 00:42:06.320
is it just like kind of physical training where it's like you can overdo it?

736
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:09.650
You can definitely overdo it.
I don't really,

737
00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.700
I think everybody can overdo it no matter how much you practice at it.
Um,

738
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:16.430
either some,
some obvious things like,
you know,

739
00:42:16.431 --> 00:42:19.070
don't eat Jalapenos before you're going to go taste wine.
Don't,

740
00:42:19.071 --> 00:42:23.000
don't mess up your receptors in any strange way.
Similarly,
walnuts or artichokes,

741
00:42:23.001 --> 00:42:25.550
you know,
all those things while it's an art chokes,
contain tannins,

742
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:28.790
which dry out your palate and make,
make it feel strange.

743
00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:32.900
That's very funny considering that.
But I just had before we started talking,

744
00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:37.250
I know we're going to have a few things to drink and a bit was a iced artichoke.

745
00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:41.420
Yup.
Oh Ferris.
Yeah.
Here we go.

746
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:44.790
Definitely not a good way to store your wine tasting.
Um,

747
00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:48.440
so there are a few rules like that,
but for the most part,

748
00:42:48.441 --> 00:42:51.830
it's the thing that you really have to have as a method.

749
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:57.080
And I spoke earlier about a context that's half of the program.

750
00:42:57.081 --> 00:43:00.590
The other half of the program to do this well is you have to have a method.

751
00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:04.460
And by that I mean you do the exact same thing every single time.

752
00:43:04.461 --> 00:43:06.650
It's an experiment.
Exactly.
Yeah.
I mean,

753
00:43:06.651 --> 00:43:11.360
I'm a big fan of this.
I have a friend that articulated this,

754
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:15.310
um,
he's in the,
he's a winemaker in California and there's a,

755
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:18.650
there's all kinds of fun experimentation.
But if you don't control the variables,

756
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:20.000
you know,
what do you actually learn?

757
00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:25.240
And so Terry wax is on about the importance of data,
not dogma.
And I,

758
00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:28.340
I love that saying,
and so when you have this method,

759
00:43:28.341 --> 00:43:32.150
it's really about collecting the data in the same way the every,

760
00:43:32.151 --> 00:43:35.750
every single time.
And it,
and it's objective.
It's not subjective.

761
00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.600
It doesn't start with,
do I like this one or don't I?

762
00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.580
That happens when you decide what you're gonna put on your table,

763
00:43:40.581 --> 00:43:43.430
but when you're trying to learn about wine,
it's not about you.

764
00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:46.370
It's about doing the same thing every single time and collecting the same

765
00:43:46.371 --> 00:43:49.450
observations.
And you're taking this down in a notebook or some.
Exactly.

766
00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:52.040
What do you,
um,
so to someone who's listening,
it was like,
you know,

767
00:43:52.041 --> 00:43:55.850
I'd like to give that a shot.
Yeah.
How would they go about it?
Potentially.

768
00:43:55.940 --> 00:44:00.290
So well,
shameless plug is start with buying the scratch and sniff wine book.

769
00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:04.280
Yeah,
I've uh,
I've read it,
I've mentioned it,

770
00:44:04.281 --> 00:44:07.220
I've given it as gifts to people.
Yup.
Within that,

771
00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:11.780
it's really a subset of the method that I use to get through the master

772
00:44:11.781 --> 00:44:16.010
sommelier exam.
And that's looking at three main areas of wine.

773
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:17.570
And that's fruit,
earth and wood.

774
00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:22.730
And essentially those three categories populate almost everything that you're

775
00:44:22.731 --> 00:44:24.620
going to smell and therefore taste in wine.

776
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.290
So make the same observations every single time.

777
00:44:27.291 --> 00:44:28.820
What are the fruit elements I smell?

778
00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:32.610
What are the elements that could be in part of by wood,
if the wind was Asian,

779
00:44:32.611 --> 00:44:35.450
would that I smell?
What are the earthy elements I smell?
And that's,

780
00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:37.650
that's the place to start.
Right?
And you do it with what you,

781
00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:40.440
what you smell and then with what you taste,
um,

782
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:44.210
beyond that you have to make observations on what you see.
You know,

783
00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.450
you talk about color,

784
00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:49.700
you talk about visual clues for alcohol levels and all these things lead you to,

785
00:44:50.170 --> 00:44:54.540
or visual cues for alcohol levels.
Like legs,
legs,
exactly.
Legs,
tears,

786
00:44:54.541 --> 00:44:57.000
whatever you want to.
How does it,
how does it,
how does it correspond?

787
00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:01.520
So the slower the legs fall,
the higher the alcohol level.
Got It.

788
00:45:01.521 --> 00:45:05.550
Assuming there's no sugar,
those are the,
I mean I'm going to mass be from here,

789
00:45:05.551 --> 00:45:09.180
but then are sacrilegious,
it's the,
it's the drips.
Like if you swirl the wine.

790
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.970
Exactly.
It's the drips down the side of them.
Lastly.
Yup.

791
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.850
From the high point of the liquid,
what trips back down to the glass.

792
00:45:14.851 --> 00:45:16.440
Those are the legs of the tiers.

793
00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:20.040
And so it seemed counterintuitive to me when I first learned this.
Like,
well,

794
00:45:20.041 --> 00:45:24.690
alcohol is thinner than water or,
or the fruit juice.

795
00:45:24.691 --> 00:45:27.570
So why if you have more alcohol,
why would it run more slowly?

796
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.880
But there's actually this capillary action that,

797
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:32.730
that pushes it back up the side of the glass.
So it's,

798
00:45:32.731 --> 00:45:35.550
and plus it's always evaporating,
condensing on the size of the glass.

799
00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:39.580
So the more alcohol there is,
the slower those tears fall.
Right.

800
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:44.820
And the reason you want to know that is if you're going to be geeked out wine

801
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.250
tasters,
it talks about a wine making style.
It talks about an origin,
right?

802
00:45:49.251 --> 00:45:53.310
So in Germany you'll have thick tears by virtue of the sugar,

803
00:45:53.311 --> 00:45:58.080
but not by virtue of the ripeness.
It's a cold place.
Right.
Or even,
you know,

804
00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:00.810
go through the Loire Valley in France and Sophia and blogging,

805
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:03.960
cabernet franc and all these very beautiful varietals.
But they don't,

806
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:05.220
they don't have much alcohol,

807
00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:08.130
which is as it should be because it's not a warm place.

808
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:11.850
And you come to California in particularly this year where it's really a warm

809
00:46:11.851 --> 00:46:15.070
place,
you're going to develop riper fruit,
which is,
you know,

810
00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.530
riper fruit means more sugar,

811
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.890
which means more food for the yeasts and more potential alcohol.

812
00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:24.120
And once the eat it and create the alcohol there,
there it is.
Right.
So is that,

813
00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.550
would that be for instance why,

814
00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:30.000
and I'm just kind of making this up on the spot,

815
00:46:30.001 --> 00:46:35.001
but why you find like a lot of zinfandels and mall backs have a high alcohol

816
00:46:35.191 --> 00:46:38.940
content.
Exactly.
These exact world ones.
Yup.
What would,

817
00:46:38.941 --> 00:46:41.370
if people wanted to try now when you're taking this down,

818
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:46.080
let's get 'em sort of prescriptive on the tasting.
Okay.

819
00:46:46.081 --> 00:46:50.640
How much,
how much wine do you do?
Drink it.

820
00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.610
I know a lot of people spit when you go to the wineries do drink it.

821
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:56.400
And how do you taste like what's the,

822
00:46:56.610 --> 00:47:01.110
you have a bottle of wine glass.
Yeah.
Pour yourself a glass.

823
00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:02.480
The first thing you do is you,

824
00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:05.700
you turn it over sideways and you don't want to spill it out away from you.

825
00:47:05.701 --> 00:47:10.260
So tip the glass away from you and look down through the wine against a white

826
00:47:10.261 --> 00:47:13.080
background and the color tells you a lot.

827
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:17.260
So we don't smell color and we don't taste color.
Um,

828
00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:19.970
it's very important to know that.
But color is an,

829
00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:24.720
is an indication of the varietals and potentially also the climate.

830
00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:29.290
So pinot noir should have the,
the versatile meaning the type of grape,

831
00:47:29.291 --> 00:47:32.650
the type of grip he was asked,
Cabernet Sauvignon,
Sauvignon Blanc,
whatever.

832
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:33.543
Exactly.

833
00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:38.350
So cabernet Sauvignon is a thin or a thick dark skinned varietals.

834
00:47:38.351 --> 00:47:41.080
So it's going to make a dark skinned red wine.
In fact,

835
00:47:41.081 --> 00:47:45.040
if you bite any grape that you want to make red wine from in half,

836
00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:46.630
it's white in the middle.

837
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:49.270
So all the color that in a red wine comes from the skins.

838
00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:52.570
So be it as cabernets is thick and dark.

839
00:47:52.571 --> 00:47:54.990
You're going to have the result and thick and dark or permit,

840
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.110
dark colored red wine.
Whereas Pinot noir is thinner and lighter in color.

841
00:47:59.111 --> 00:48:01.360
And so you're going to have a lighter color wine.

842
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:02.410
It doesn't have any less flavor,

843
00:48:02.411 --> 00:48:06.160
isn't worth less of your attention or interest is just different.

844
00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:11.050
So the first thing you wanna do is look at that color and it should give you,

845
00:48:11.051 --> 00:48:13.240
if you don't know what the wine is,
it'll give you a visual clue.

846
00:48:13.241 --> 00:48:16.690
Like if it's light red,
well don't,
don't think about Cabernet,
right?

847
00:48:16.691 --> 00:48:20.050
Start crossing it off your list.
It's about deduction.
Um,

848
00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:22.490
but if you know it's Cabernet and it's light red boy,

849
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.190
then you might think something's wrong,
right?

850
00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.080
Because that's not a typical color for it.

851
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:28.720
So the first thing you do is you look at it,
um,

852
00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:32.160
and you look for color and you look for sediment.
You know,
it.

853
00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:35.380
Is there anything solid in there?
He looked for gases at bubbling.

854
00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:37.420
If it's red and it's bubbling,
there's kind of,
you know,

855
00:48:37.421 --> 00:48:40.590
maybe two or three possibilities on the planet of what it could be.
Um,

856
00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:44.140
including things like sparkling Shiraz,
which is totally gross and I don't drink.

857
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:48.730
Um,
but those visual cues tell you a lot.

858
00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:51.070
And then if it starts to Brown,
if you,

859
00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.670
if we assume our glass of wine is tipped away from us and we look out to the far

860
00:48:54.671 --> 00:48:58.210
northern edge,
if it starts to Brown,

861
00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:01.570
it tells you that potentially is made it an oxidative style.

862
00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:05.080
So the wine saw some oxygen while I was being made or it's older,

863
00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:10.060
and that's probably,
you know,
more common.
Um,
and let me ask you this.

864
00:49:10.061 --> 00:49:12.880
So what happens to an avocado if you cut it and leave it on the counter?

865
00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:14.950
It oxidizes it was brown.
It turns Brown.

866
00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:17.350
Same thing with old bananas or whatever it is.

867
00:49:17.351 --> 00:49:19.910
And so the same thing happens with wine.
It's just grapes,
right?

868
00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:22.930
And so grape juice goes through the same process.
It starts to turn Brown.

869
00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:26.530
So if you see that sort of British Browning at the edge of the glass,

870
00:49:26.531 --> 00:49:29.710
you can start just from my,
it's like,
oh,
okay.
So it's showing signs of oxidation,

871
00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:31.990
therefore it's older,
right?

872
00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:36.580
And then you do the exercise you look at at the legs or the tears and um,

873
00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:39.610
you can start to discern like what's the alcohol level.

874
00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:44.830
And so that brings us back to the context.
So we'll take a quick tangent on that.

875
00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:48.340
If you don't,
I can look at that and say,
okay,
those are medium,

876
00:49:48.341 --> 00:49:51.310
medium plus viscosity based on how those tears fall.
Well,

877
00:49:51.311 --> 00:49:55.060
you only know what medium plus viscosity is if you've had all the wines of the

878
00:49:55.061 --> 00:49:57.820
world.
So that's the context,
right?
You got to have a method,

879
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.390
got to have a content.
You have to experience the extremes.
Exactly.

880
00:50:01.391 --> 00:50:04.600
And the spectrum,
right?
So for everyone who wants to do this is your homework,

881
00:50:04.601 --> 00:50:08.190
it means you just have to taste a lot of wine.
It's great.
And you do a no,

882
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:12.670
I've heard for instance that,
and I want to be corrected if this is not correct,

883
00:50:12.671 --> 00:50:17.671
but that you should sort of take the first swish of wine and just rinse your

884
00:50:20.231 --> 00:50:23.440
mouth with it because that's not the,

885
00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:27.160
that's not the sip that you want to try to evaluate.

886
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:31.010
Is that necessary?
Uh,
incorrect?
Well,
it depends.

887
00:50:31.011 --> 00:50:35.840
If you just brush your teeth,
you know,
you should just drink a whole glass.
Right?

888
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:39.830
But,
um,
yeah,
it's definitely first pallet impression is,

889
00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:43.300
is not necessarily the right one.
So spend some time with it.
Um,

890
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:46.820
before you do that though,
you definitely wanna smell it.

891
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:51.080
The things that we really taste are sweet,
sour,
salty,
bitter.

892
00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:53.570
And if we're fortunate,
this idea of Umami,

893
00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:57.950
this savory jasmine just had Umami Burger last night.
I like it.
Very delicious.

894
00:50:57.951 --> 00:51:01.310
Nice.
So,
um,
everything else we think we taste,

895
00:51:01.311 --> 00:51:03.980
we're actually smelling and so it makes sense to smell the wine.

896
00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:07.340
So when I smell the wine,
I always think about this acronym few,

897
00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:09.320
which stands for fruit,
earth and wood.

898
00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:14.450
And so you want to smell for those things and force yourself require diligence

899
00:51:14.451 --> 00:51:16.970
to answer all three of those questions.
Don't just blow by it.

900
00:51:16.971 --> 00:51:20.420
So you might pick up a wine and it's just like,
oh my God,
strawberries,

901
00:51:20.421 --> 00:51:23.240
Raspberries,
cherries.
Great.
All right,
cool.
Let's taste it.
Well,

902
00:51:23.241 --> 00:51:26.870
what about the earth and the would cause those are two huge pieces that inform

903
00:51:26.871 --> 00:51:27.530
the wine.

904
00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:30.920
I think give that intellectual value and make it complete and make you smart.

905
00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:34.880
So I'm always come up with at least three fruits,
whatever they are.

906
00:51:34.881 --> 00:51:37.840
And use your own,
use your own language.
There is no wind speed.
That's it.

907
00:51:37.841 --> 00:51:40.790
So I guess to,
to do that,

908
00:51:40.791 --> 00:51:43.190
you probably also have to get into the habit of tasting.
I mean,

909
00:51:43.191 --> 00:51:48.170
you should taste every that have fruit,
earth and wood characteristics.
Totally.

910
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:50.570
Yup.
So I mean we can talk about,

911
00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:54.420
talk about all kinds of things we can juxtapose to supercharge that process.
Um,

912
00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:56.840
but you definitely got to do it.
What do you mean by juxtapose?

913
00:51:56.900 --> 00:52:01.060
So if you want understand what is earth?
Okay,
well let's buy,
you know,

914
00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:05.030
Napa Valley Cabernet and compare it to Cabernet from Bordeaux,

915
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:08.810
both the same gray,
but the place really makes a huge difference.

916
00:52:08.811 --> 00:52:12.410
They're likely made in very similar ways,
their age in the same oak,

917
00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:16.430
but it's that soil that gives the Bordeaux the earthy thing that,

918
00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:19.100
that will isolate that for you.
Right.
That's pretty cool.

919
00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:24.220
So if people wanted to say get a handful of reds and a handful of whites,

920
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.990
all of which were very different.
Yup.
Just to start developing this,

921
00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.720
what would a,
what would a few choices being?

922
00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:37.700
So let's think about three whites by German Riesling,
right?
There'd be no oak.

923
00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:39.860
So that's an example of an oak free wine.

924
00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:44.160
It will likely have a little residual sugar depending on what kind you buy.
Um,

925
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:47.210
which is really interesting because you say,
I don't like sweet wine.
Well that's,

926
00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.230
this isn't about you right now.

927
00:52:48.231 --> 00:52:50.800
This is about your learning right now to buy a pallet.
So,
um,

928
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:53.690
what you will learn there is that it's about balance.

929
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:58.550
And so the sugar will be balanced by acidity.
It's all about balancing anyone.

930
00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:02.900
Um,
so you'll also have earth.
So in the German wine you'll Hudson the earthy,

931
00:53:02.901 --> 00:53:06.620
you'll have a great example of balance with residual sugar and you won't have

932
00:53:06.621 --> 00:53:11.621
any oak or woody characteristics and compare that to California Chardonnay,

933
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:15.530
which won't very likely have any earth.
Um,

934
00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.850
it won't have the same level of sweetness.
It will have oak.

935
00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:23.060
So you can start to say,
oh yeah,
there's that Caramel,
there's that vanilla,

936
00:53:23.061 --> 00:53:25.440
there's that butterscotch,
that's the Oak,
right?

937
00:53:25.441 --> 00:53:28.680
So then you can like put your finger right on that and then compare it to

938
00:53:28.681 --> 00:53:33.540
something like,
um,
you know,
maybe French sauvignon blanc or even Bordeaux Blanc.

939
00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:37.440
So which is Sauvignon Blanc and semillon together in a blend,

940
00:53:37.441 --> 00:53:39.030
but it speaks to the place Bordeaux.

941
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:44.130
And so you will have oak like the,
um,
like the California Chardonnay,

942
00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:47.830
but you will have earth like the German Riesling.
And so you,

943
00:53:47.831 --> 00:53:50.370
you have little bits of each one.
And when you can triangulate,

944
00:53:50.371 --> 00:53:53.310
that's when you start to get really smart.
Like,
okay,
that's the wood.
Okay.

945
00:53:53.311 --> 00:53:57.300
That's where it smells like,
right.
When you're removing one element at a time.

946
00:53:57.330 --> 00:54:01.380
Exactly.
Or examining one element of time.
What about for uh,

947
00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:06.780
Rudd's red?
I would,
you know what the pretty interesting to do would be?

948
00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:11.490
Um,
well I'm a big fan of same as we just chatted about same varietals from

949
00:54:11.491 --> 00:54:14.640
different continent that can be pretty interesting if we want to do different

950
00:54:14.641 --> 00:54:16.800
varietals.
Um,
you know,

951
00:54:16.801 --> 00:54:19.710
do something like Dolcetto from Piedmont,

952
00:54:19.711 --> 00:54:21.630
say in Italy there's lots of Great Schultz,

953
00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:26.270
bad at remembering Italian wine names.
Yep.
So dual chateaus,

954
00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:29.910
the actual,
the name of the grape.
And unlike most of the wines in Italy,

955
00:54:29.911 --> 00:54:33.570
this is actually named for the grape and not the place,
not the region.
Exactly.

956
00:54:33.571 --> 00:54:36.960
So,
but Joel Choteau is most frequently,
so it's a red wine,

957
00:54:36.961 --> 00:54:41.961
but it's most frequently made in stainless steel or with the absence of new oak.

958
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:45.360
So you'll taste grape and you'll taste place earth,

959
00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:49.950
but you won't taste any influence of wood.
And then why don't we,

960
00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:54.750
you can even go right next door and a and drink Barbaresco or Barolo.

961
00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:56.880
So same region,
different grape.

962
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:59.730
So you can identify with what that grape is about almost.

963
00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:04.490
I mean 99% of the good cases,
definitely Asian oak in.

964
00:55:04.491 --> 00:55:08.340
So you can feel what oak does there and you'll probably find a tie in,

965
00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:10.290
in terms of the earth,
right?

966
00:55:10.291 --> 00:55:13.080
So as long as they have like one tether to each other,

967
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:16.200
then then it makes it really useful to see like,
okay,
well what's different?

968
00:55:16.290 --> 00:55:18.790
Right?
And then you grab a Zinfandel from,

969
00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:21.660
from Napa Valley and there you'll see like,
okay,

970
00:55:21.661 --> 00:55:24.180
the alcohol is really different and that,
what does that feel like?

971
00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:28.200
And Oak will be different because it'll be new oak and maybe it'll be American

972
00:55:28.201 --> 00:55:32.790
oak,
which tastes like dill,
you know?
Uh,
so,
so all these little things,

973
00:55:32.791 --> 00:55:34.320
we just start to triangulate.

974
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:37.530
But you gotta you gotta keep notes and keep it organized in some way.

975
00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:40.620
Actually don't keep notes physical any longer.
I just keep it in my head.

976
00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:42.990
But you did keep physical notes for a long time.
I God,

977
00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:47.810
stacks and stacks of notebooks.
They fell over,
they'd hurt you.
Other stuff,

978
00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:50.130
that's all.
What is a,
what is one of your favorites?

979
00:55:50.131 --> 00:55:54.510
Zinfandels just out of curiosity,
because I tend to like zinfandels.
Yeah,
I have,

980
00:55:54.511 --> 00:55:58.730
well,
lots of favorites.
I love the wines of Charlie.
Um,
Turley.

981
00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:03.260
Truly.
Yeah.
T u.
R.
L.
E.
Y.
Um,
they're based in Napa.
They make Zinfandel from,

982
00:56:03.261 --> 00:56:06.820
from all over.
Um,
and Christina Turley.
Uh,

983
00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:09.180
it was Larry's Larry Turley who founded it.
It's his daughter.

984
00:56:09.181 --> 00:56:12.780
She's working with Teagan Pos,
all aqua to make some of the really,

985
00:56:12.810 --> 00:56:17.070
really special zinfandels from California.
And then Ridge is a classic.

986
00:56:17.071 --> 00:56:21.840
Paul draper has been making wine at Ridge for north of 40 years.
Um,
and it's,

987
00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:24.970
it's as blue is infidel can get.
Cool.
Yeah.

988
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:28.600
What are some underrated,
uh,

989
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:30.760
wines and to be,

990
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:34.720
I'd love to get as specific as possible just for people who were looking to try

991
00:56:34.721 --> 00:56:39.230
some wines that perhaps they wouldn't be exposed to that haven't been sorta

992
00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:42.580
overloaded.
Yep.
What,
uh,
what are some that you could bring up?

993
00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:46.840
So pinot noir is all the rage,
right?
It's for sure an overindulged princess.

994
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:50.950
I am I,
there's so much sweet,
expensive,

995
00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:54.370
unduly expensive Pinot noir that I look elsewhere,

996
00:56:54.371 --> 00:56:58.780
but I look for that same set of characteristics and I call him the s words,

997
00:56:58.781 --> 00:57:02.690
wines that are silky,
sexy,
supple,
soft,
um,

998
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.710
things are full of allure.
That,
and those are wines that appealed to me.
Um,

999
00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:11.440
and peanut noir doesn't have a proprietary right to those as I described them,

1000
00:57:11.441 --> 00:57:15.730
Pino characteristics,
they happen in things like we're notch.
Um,
in fact,

1001
00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:18.910
I'm a huge proponent of Bernache and believe that it's just the warm climate

1002
00:57:18.911 --> 00:57:22.960
analogy of Pinot Noir.
So think about peanut with just a little extra warmth,

1003
00:57:22.961 --> 00:57:27.790
a little extra give.
Um,
but all those same s words and it's,
it's great.

1004
00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:32.710
It would be a specific ganache that people could try to find online to check
out.

1005
00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:36.900
Um,
I'm a big fan of Ruston ganache resident.
Yeah,

1006
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:41.070
our u s d e n roses and they make a Christine's vineyard granola.

1007
00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:44.110
It's from the Barossa valley in Australia.
I spent a lot of time there.
Um,

1008
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:48.930
but to me that Australia is a,
is a whole other thing,
um,

1009
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.260
that we could talk about for days.

1010
00:57:50.261 --> 00:57:55.261
But that wine in particular exhibits so much elegance when Australia may be as a

1011
00:57:56.561 --> 00:57:57.910
country is not known for elegance

1012
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:06.970
and where everything is.
I know I butchered that,
but my Kiwis friends,

1013
00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:09.780
I let her influence.
Um,
it's,

1014
00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:14.140
it's something very elegant and it punches way above its weight.
Very cool.
Yeah.

1015
00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:18.750
Uh,
what are some common,
we're going to talk about other things like,
um,

1016
00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:22.960
whiskey and Miss Gallon,
all,
all,
all sorts of goodness.
But before we get to that,

1017
00:58:22.961 --> 00:58:27.580
what are some common misconceptions about one or old wives tales,

1018
00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:31.270
things that annoy you?
That's it.
That's an interesting question.
Um,

1019
00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:35.650
well the first one is that more expensive?
As better.
That's definitely not true.

1020
00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:40.390
I mean,
it's absolutely not true.
It's slight.
It's a,
the supply and demand thing,

1021
00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:44.710
um,
to a large degree.
And so you know why you know,

1022
00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:48.580
and hype,
you know,
that that Mouton that I poured the Berenger on top of,

1023
00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:52.870
you know,
20 minutes ago,
you know,
my most embarrassing simile,
a moment that,

1024
00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:53.630
you know,

1025
00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:58.240
on unreleased maybe 500 euros a bottle in Europe today before you even get it to

1026
00:58:58.241 --> 00:59:02.950
America.
Why is it,
how much money?
You know,
who,
who knows other than,

1027
00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:06.670
um,
I mean,
they make something like 20,000 cases of it.
That's a lot of why.

1028
00:59:06.930 --> 00:59:09.760
So why,
why does it cost that much money?
Because someone said,
hey,

1029
00:59:09.761 --> 00:59:13.120
this is the best thing in the world.
And so everybody has to have it.
Right.

1030
00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:16.330
But isn't it really,
but is it really worth that?
Right.
It's like fashion.

1031
00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:19.180
It's like fashion.
Exactly.
And importantly,
people,

1032
00:59:19.181 --> 00:59:20.920
I actually get asked that question a lot.
They say,

1033
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:24.770
is this wine worth as much money?
I say,
well,
it depends on the individual.
I mean,

1034
00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:28.940
yeah,
it's an marketplace question,
not necessarily quality question.
100%.
Exactly.

1035
00:59:28.941 --> 00:59:32.780
And so for someone it might be worth it and for someone else it might not be.
Um,

1036
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:36.880
but more expensive is definitely not better.
It's a big thing.
Um,

1037
00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:42.020
you holler if somebody wanted to apply a positive constraint to themselves where

1038
00:59:42.501 --> 00:59:45.440
they couldn't buy wine over x number of dollars.
Yes.

1039
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:49.670
A and let's say this is somebody who's,
you know,
not,
not poor,

1040
00:59:49.671 --> 00:59:53.990
but makes $50,000 a year.
Yup.
Right?
So they're not extremely wealthy either.
Yup.

1041
00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:58.220
Super easy to do.
Yeah.
What is,
what is like the sweet spot,
right?

1042
00:59:58.221 --> 01:00:02.500
In terms of between 15 and 20 bucks,
15 and 20 bucks.
Yep.

1043
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:06.470
Two to find a bottle of wine for under $10.
You probably don't want to drink it.

1044
01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.380
Yeah.
And I mean there are of course exceptions,
there's,
you know,

1045
01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:12.740
people get in the weeds,
they blow things out,
you know,
so on and so forth.

1046
01:00:12.741 --> 01:00:16.250
And so maybe you get a steal every now and again.
But as a rule,
it's very,

1047
01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.670
very hard to make something for under 10 bucks.
Um,
I mean,

1048
01:00:19.671 --> 01:00:24.671
you do it by using fermentation tanks or as large as a city block with

1049
01:00:24.681 --> 01:00:29.180
mechanically harvested grapes that were mechanically grown in a place that's

1050
01:00:29.181 --> 01:00:33.560
probably environmentally very bad.
I've seen this stuff in,

1051
01:00:33.561 --> 01:00:36.140
in process and it's,
it's gnarly.
Um,

1052
01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:39.440
and you won't have any connection to the land.
So between 15 and 20 bucks,

1053
01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:42.540
you can actually get real wine from real people.
Um,

1054
01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:46.670
it probably won't come from,
you know,
the fancy Appalachians,
but that's great.

1055
01:00:46.671 --> 01:00:48.400
I mean,
those are always there.
Who Cares?
You know,

1056
01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:51.710
go explore the margins and learn something and there there's so many thrills.

1057
01:00:51.711 --> 01:00:54.890
What's another wine between say 15 and 20?

1058
01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:00.400
We're in that range that people probably haven't tried that you would suggest

1059
01:01:00.441 --> 01:01:02.180
they give ago.
Um,

1060
01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.430
like I haven't had much grenache so I'm going to try some organized.

1061
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:06.450
Please do you get a lot of guilt?

1062
01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:10.730
A lot of great ganache from Spain where it's actually for a long time,

1063
01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:14.900
the most widely planted red variety in Spain.
And so there's just tons of it.

1064
01:01:15.290 --> 01:01:19.460
Sometimes it goes by the name of Rio,
Huh?
Where it might be in a blend real.
Okay.

1065
01:01:19.461 --> 01:01:23.630
So real high is grenache with tempered O'Neil and little interest.
Okay.

1066
01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:26.740
I really am a big fan of Johan.
Yeah.
We can drink white Rio.

1067
01:01:26.741 --> 01:01:28.090
How to no one and no one thinks about that.

1068
01:01:28.091 --> 01:01:31.040
And we say real hot and everyone thinks red but white were Johan can be great.

1069
01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:34.620
It can be super age where they can be very affordable.
Um,

1070
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:38.330
I drink a lot of,
uh,
I drink a lot of Jose from the south of France.

1071
01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:42.200
That's 1215 bucks.
And I,
you know,
a new producer I'm really smitten with,
uh,

1072
01:01:42.290 --> 01:01:46.870
from the lower,
um,
name is Mohs,
m.
O.
S.
S.
E.
Uh,

1073
01:01:46.890 --> 01:01:51.770
the wines are made from the Shannon Blanc grape.
They're totally cheap,
20 bucks.

1074
01:01:52.110 --> 01:01:55.280
Um,
and amazing.
Really,
really,
I mean world class special.

1075
01:01:55.281 --> 01:01:59.090
I would drink them before pretty much any white wine from California for which

1076
01:01:59.091 --> 01:02:04.070
you could spend $300.
Wow.
Yeah.
Very cool.
Uh,
so I interrupted you though.

1077
01:02:04.071 --> 01:02:08.090
You're saying,
uh,
misconceptions more expensive as better.

1078
01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:12.170
And then you said,
I want to say you said color.
Oh yeah.
So color,

1079
01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.070
that was a real pet peeve of mine is a simile.

1080
01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:19.890
You opened bottle of something and pour the tastes and before the tasered even

1081
01:02:19.891 --> 01:02:23.310
tasted it would be like,
oh,
that's great.
Or Oh,
that's going to be terrible.

1082
01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:27.090
Completely based on the color.
And you know,
as we chat about,

1083
01:02:27.091 --> 01:02:31.890
you don't smell color and you don't taste color and color has no bearing on

1084
01:02:31.891 --> 01:02:36.360
quality at all.
Um,
so just because it's dark doesn't mean it's going to be good.

1085
01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:40.140
You know,
I'd much rather look at my beautiful date and smell and taste something

1086
01:02:40.141 --> 01:02:44.360
beautiful.
Then just be impressed by a big inky glass of whatever.
Yeah.
Um,

1087
01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:47.520
the only bearing color has is on the,
on the actual type of grape,

1088
01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:48.720
not whether it's good or not.

1089
01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:51.970
<v 0>Bear with me one second.
My puppy is eating my documents.</v>

1090
01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.750
The dog is literally eating my homework.
One Sec.

1091
01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:04.300
No,
it's all good.
All good.
All right.
So we are,

1092
01:03:04.330 --> 01:03:08.740
we are still rolling.
Uh,
so we got the color and uh,

1093
01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:10.510
what else,
I mean,
I know you've,

1094
01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:15.220
you've said before that you think of wine as a grocery.

1095
01:03:15.630 --> 01:03:16.840
Yeah.
Could you elaborate on that?
Yeah,

1096
01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:18.210
<v 2>definitely.
That's um,</v>

1097
01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:23.250
that's also born out of that time living in Italy that the table's not set until

1098
01:03:23.251 --> 01:03:27.030
there's wine upon.
It might come out of a pitcher and poured into a tumbler,

1099
01:03:27.031 --> 01:03:30.090
but it's always their lunch and dinner.
It's on the table.

1100
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:34.380
And I lived at when I was living there and I actually brought that back and live

1101
01:03:34.381 --> 01:03:36.540
it now.
Um,
and so that,

1102
01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:40.440
that's an idea that isn't a very American idea because we're,

1103
01:03:40.441 --> 01:03:45.060
we're so new in terms of,
of wine drinkers.
As a wine drinking community,
we're,

1104
01:03:45.061 --> 01:03:48.780
we're still so young.
Um,
but there it's well established,
um,

1105
01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.820
for centuries,
Millennia.
Um,

1106
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:54.750
and it's that idea that wine ought to be a part of your everyday life.

1107
01:03:54.751 --> 01:03:56.760
It makes your life better.
And so,
yes,

1108
01:03:56.761 --> 01:03:59.010
I have this isn't that wine is grocery not a luxury

1109
01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:01.800
<v 0>and I never,
this is embarrassing to admit,</v>

1110
01:04:01.801 --> 01:04:06.450
but it had been in the bigger 15 years and I didn't become interested in wine

1111
01:04:06.451 --> 01:04:08.670
until I lived in Argentina for a year.
Awesome.

1112
01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:11.310
And wine was on the table every single meal.

1113
01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:14.310
Always everyone drank wine at dinner.

1114
01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:17.190
It was just that is part of the process.

1115
01:04:17.191 --> 01:04:20.160
It's like setting the table with a knife and fork.
Yup.

1116
01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:24.510
You put the wine on the table and then came back with a renewed interest in sort

1117
01:04:24.511 --> 01:04:28.380
of exploring,
um,
I mean similar to the Pinot Noir,

1118
01:04:28.381 --> 01:04:30.420
I feel like mall Beck kind of flooded the market,

1119
01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:34.210
totally became very popular and is as a result people could get away with sort

1120
01:04:34.211 --> 01:04:37.020
of murder in terms of low quality and high prices,

1121
01:04:37.021 --> 01:04:40.680
but the have been exploring more.
I just liked the,
the,

1122
01:04:40.681 --> 01:04:45.480
the really kind of fruity high alcohol content actually in and uh,
you know,

1123
01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:49.470
Carmen areas and whatnot.
But um,
you know,

1124
01:04:49.471 --> 01:04:52.700
you have expanded though since,
uh,

1125
01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:56.460
all of your time in the wine world that I'm sure there maybe they're similar

1126
01:04:56.461 --> 01:05:01.080
languages.
Like wine is Spanish and Whiskey is Portuguese.

1127
01:05:01.081 --> 01:05:05.940
But we have,
we have,
we have,
we have a bunch of bottles sitting behind me.

1128
01:05:05.941 --> 01:05:10.320
Should I go grab those?
We should.
Okay.
And Six classes and six glasses.
All right,

1129
01:05:10.321 --> 01:05:13.500
so we're going to pause this and go get a number of things,

1130
01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:16.670
a number of tools to have alcoholic.

1131
01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:20.003
We'll be right back.

1132
01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:29.280
So we're laying out six glasses.
I asked what type of glasses and the,

1133
01:05:29.370 --> 01:05:34.370
the answer was they really just need to be large enough that you can smell.

1134
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:37.740
So,
you know,
like a sock aid glass wouldn't be large enough.

1135
01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:42.210
But I'm using for those people interested beakers because I'm a Weirdo and I

1136
01:05:42.211 --> 01:05:45.750
like to scare people who come over for dinner and to thinking that it might be

1137
01:05:45.751 --> 01:05:50.310
drinking out of something I put urine in previously.
There are 250 milliliter,

1138
01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:55.490
Kai Max Kimball beakers and 250 milliliters is exactly one third,

1139
01:05:58.111 --> 01:06:02.400
a bottle of wine,
a standard bottle of wine.
And I love these glasses.

1140
01:06:02.401 --> 01:06:07.401
I was first exposed to them at a place called the flour and water.

1141
01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:11.170
Uh,
and I'm actually an investor in that groups,
uh,

1142
01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:14.250
one of their other restaurants called central kitchen in San Francisco,
but they,

1143
01:06:14.310 --> 01:06:17.310
they used beakers and they also use speakers for candles.

1144
01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:20.790
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1145
01:06:20.790 --> 01:06:25.350
<v 0>And that is,
that is all,
we have a lot of booze laid out in front of us.</v>

1146
01:06:25.351 --> 01:06:30.080
I'm excited about this.
And uh,
the,
um,

1147
01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:31.750
<v 4>okay.</v>

1148
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:34.540
<v 0>The whiskey story,
I mean,</v>

1149
01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:38.320
how did you segue?
I'll let you finish this.

1150
01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:41.430
The last porks we have six of these.
Uh,

1151
01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.350
but I'd love to hear how you segwayed

1152
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:49.450
from wine to whiskey wharf.
That's always been present.

1153
01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:51.910
<v 2>No,
it's definitely a segway.
It's,</v>

1154
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:56.890
I think of my job as to help people enjoy their lives.

1155
01:06:57.730 --> 01:07:01.360
And I think we do that by helping people find easy ways to get smart about

1156
01:07:01.361 --> 01:07:05.650
things,
which can then increase their air enjoyment.
Frankly.
You know,

1157
01:07:05.651 --> 01:07:06.610
mine was scary.

1158
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.530
So we write a scratch and sniff wine book that makes it not scary.
Yeah,

1159
01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:12.850
knock it off the pedestal.
Make it easy,
make it accessible,

1160
01:07:12.851 --> 01:07:16.700
and tell people that it's actually super democratic.
It's up to you.
What's,

1161
01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.550
what's good.
It's not up to me,
you know,
don't,

1162
01:07:18.551 --> 01:07:20.080
don't drink them because I said drink it.

1163
01:07:20.081 --> 01:07:23.250
Drink something because you figured out that you like that.
Right.
That's,

1164
01:07:23.251 --> 01:07:27.610
that's the key.
Um,
and so in,
in creating that,

1165
01:07:27.611 --> 01:07:31.330
that book,
you create a methodology and,
and it's again,

1166
01:07:31.331 --> 01:07:34.450
breaking it down into its component pieces.
It's just like dissecting a frog.

1167
01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:35.980
Like,
okay,
where's this?
Where's this?

1168
01:07:35.981 --> 01:07:39.760
Where's this and how do they make the thing tick?
Um,
and we did that with wine.

1169
01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:44.320
So you understand that it's again about fruit and earth and wood and those,

1170
01:07:44.321 --> 01:07:47.890
those things populate all the smells that you're gonna smell and then you can

1171
01:07:47.891 --> 01:07:50.480
put them back together in whatever order you want to make,
what you want,

1172
01:07:50.490 --> 01:07:53.170
you know,
make what you want to drink,
what'll make you happy.
Um,

1173
01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:57.190
and that same methodology applies to whiskey.
Um,

1174
01:07:57.370 --> 01:07:58.960
there are some things tuition doesn't apply.

1175
01:07:58.961 --> 01:08:00.850
Like I don't think it applies very well to beer,

1176
01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:03.970
particularly with the explosion in craft brewing.
Why is that?

1177
01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:09.210
Because the place part has been so obscured and so now with,

1178
01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:13.970
um,
you know,
we can make a beer in California.
Exactly.
Yeah,
yeah.
The origin part.

1179
01:08:13.971 --> 01:08:15.980
So whereas years ago I think

1180
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.580
<v 0>it really mattered.
Um,
we would say,
okay,</v>

1181
01:08:19.581 --> 01:08:20.990
well this has to be Belgian.

1182
01:08:20.991 --> 01:08:24.440
And because you recognize certain flavors that come from certain yeasts that

1183
01:08:24.441 --> 01:08:25.460
only happened in this place,

1184
01:08:25.461 --> 01:08:29.390
but now those are imported here and there's all kinds of souring techniques and

1185
01:08:29.391 --> 01:08:33.170
things that people do to really obscure place.
So it doesn't,

1186
01:08:33.171 --> 01:08:37.880
it doesn't apply to beer,
but it applies really well to whiskey.

1187
01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:42.140
Now whiskey.
Uh,
I'm cheating a little bit here.

1188
01:08:42.141 --> 01:08:45.830
This is because I know the answer but I was so excited to see this cause I've

1189
01:08:45.831 --> 01:08:50.180
always felt like a dumb ass when trying to write the word whiskey with or

1190
01:08:50.181 --> 01:08:53.900
without an e at the end.
It depends on the country of origin and that's it.

1191
01:08:53.901 --> 01:08:58.790
So it's a great,
it's a great rule.
It's w I s k.
Y if you,

1192
01:08:58.791 --> 01:09:02.270
if the whiskey comes from a country that doesn't have an e in the name Scotland,

1193
01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:06.800
Scotland,
Japan.
If it comes from a country and Canada,

1194
01:09:06.801 --> 01:09:10.970
if it comes from a country with an e in the name Ireland or America and it's

1195
01:09:10.971 --> 01:09:15.170
spelled w,
h.
I.
S.
K.
E.
Y.
Pretty cool.
I love that.

1196
01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:18.800
I love that truck.
It's,
it's very,
very cool.
There's,
there's another one.

1197
01:09:18.830 --> 01:09:19.663
This is a,

1198
01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:24.440
this is just for people like me who are maybe a little slow perhaps born in a

1199
01:09:24.441 --> 01:09:27.530
place like long island like I was,
I always forget

1200
01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:32.840
this may reflect how ill suited I am to something like a master Somme test.

1201
01:09:32.841 --> 01:09:37.490
But I always forget which bread is mine in which water is mine.
Yeah.
So I,

1202
01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:41.270
I'm stealing bread.
I'm drinking other peoples drinks.
And if you,

1203
01:09:41.271 --> 01:09:44.870
if you touch your index finger to your thumb on both hands,

1204
01:09:44.871 --> 01:09:48.200
like you're making an okay symbol,
your left hand will make a B.

1205
01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:51.830
That's bread in your right hand.
We'll make a d,
which is drink.

1206
01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:55.070
And that's what I will do under the table sometimes when I'm unsure of which to

1207
01:09:55.071 --> 01:09:57.260
crack to my love that that's super smart.

1208
01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:03.530
And then fork or if you're setting a table fork knife,

1209
01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.290
it's the letter of,
it's the number of letters.

1210
01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:10.880
So a fork is four letters left is four letters.

1211
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:16.030
So they,
they,
they,
they fit on the side associated with the number of letters.
I,

1212
01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:20.210
let's uh,
so,
so you're talking about whiskey.

1213
01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:24.680
So a lot of the wine is few is whiskey,

1214
01:10:24.681 --> 01:10:28.810
also few.
It is fruit,
earth and wood.
And so,
um,
but it's,

1215
01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:32.810
but the fruit in this case isn't fruit as an a grape.
It's grain.
Right.

1216
01:10:32.811 --> 01:10:36.500
And so the first thing that affects the outcome of Whiskey,
I mean,

1217
01:10:36.501 --> 01:10:39.950
the first thing to know about whiskey is this just distilled beer.
That's it.

1218
01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:42.770
Like you take beer and you put it in a still and you turn on the heat,

1219
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:46.880
not too high,
but just high enough so that only the alcohol evaporates,
right?

1220
01:10:46.881 --> 01:10:48.980
Because it evaporates at a lower temperature than water.

1221
01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:52.640
And then you condense it and you capture that on the other side of this thing.

1222
01:10:52.641 --> 01:10:55.100
And you've separated the alcohol from the water and genius,

1223
01:10:55.101 --> 01:10:59.960
it's called distillation.
Um,
so what we put in at the beginning is just beer.

1224
01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:03.500
So you make your beer and what do you make the beer from?
Makes a big difference.

1225
01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:07.160
Um,
predominantly corn,
wheat,

1226
01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:12.350
rye and malted barley are the,
are the four big grain type cereal.

1227
01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:13.770
Cereal grains are used

1228
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:18.330
<v 2>to make that beer to become whiskey.
Um,
in America,</v>

1229
01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:23.040
corn is king.
Um,
and now rye is,
is sharing the stage as well.

1230
01:11:23.041 --> 01:11:27.750
But if you're drinking,
bourbon has to be at least 51% corn.
Now I'm going to,

1231
01:11:28.530 --> 01:11:31.620
I'm going to ask is,
uh,
an embarrassed yet.
Another embarrassing question.

1232
01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:34.180
What is the difference between Bourbon and whiskey?

1233
01:11:34.181 --> 01:11:38.250
Is Bourbon a subset of whiskeys that are regional name for whiskey?
It's,
um,

1234
01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:41.220
so bourbon has set of laws,
has to come from America.

1235
01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:43.830
It doesn't have to come from Bourbon County,
Kentucky,
as,

1236
01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:47.010
as there is a Bourbon County,
Kentucky,
but we make bourbon all over the country.

1237
01:11:47.011 --> 01:11:48.270
So it has to come from America.

1238
01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:52.470
It has to have been made from at least 51% corn.

1239
01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:56.760
So the balance can be that Rye,
it can be the wheat,
whatever.
Um,

1240
01:11:56.790 --> 01:12:01.530
and it has to be aged in charred new oak barrels and charge.
Yeah.

1241
01:12:01.531 --> 01:12:05.580
So you,
you fell a tree,
you cut the tree into planks,

1242
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.620
or in this case they're called staves.

1243
01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:10.650
And then you bend them using heat to make a barrel,

1244
01:12:11.010 --> 01:12:13.500
and then you actually char the inside of the barrel with a flame.

1245
01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:16.260
And when you do that,
it obviously it changes its color,

1246
01:12:16.261 --> 01:12:21.261
but it also pulls that all kinds of flavors and caramelizes things in that tree,

1247
01:12:21.301 --> 01:12:24.240
which also contribute flavors.
So it's that,
you know,

1248
01:12:24.250 --> 01:12:28.390
it's the brown sugar if the Brown spices like cardamom and cinnamon.
Um,

1249
01:12:28.391 --> 01:12:30.870
it's the Nela,
lots of vanilla,
butterscotch.

1250
01:12:30.871 --> 01:12:32.640
All those flavors come from that oak barrel.

1251
01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:36.600
So if you age it in that barrel and it's made from 51% corn,
you did in America,

1252
01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:40.720
you have bourbon.
That's Bourbon.
Yup.
Cool.
So didn't want to interrupt.
So the,
the,

1253
01:12:40.721 --> 01:12:44.850
the main options again,
key role through that.
You've got corn,
wheat,
wheat,

1254
01:12:44.970 --> 01:12:49.750
Rye and malted barley,
malted barley.
What is molted meter?
So it means you,

1255
01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:53.460
you sprout it and you know,
just like we would eat sprouts,
you know,
they,

1256
01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:57.210
the sprout the grain and then you arrest that process so you,

1257
01:12:57.211 --> 01:13:00.690
you kill it essentially with heat.
Um,
and so they,

1258
01:13:00.691 --> 01:13:03.670
it's a big deal and scotch production.
Um,

1259
01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:06.900
and in Japanese whiskey production as well.
So what a scotch.

1260
01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:11.730
So Scotch is any whiskey that comes from Ireland.
Ah,
Harmeet,
Scotland,
Scotland,

1261
01:13:12.030 --> 01:13:16.260
Scotland,
and of course Irish whiskey coming from Ireland.
Got It.
Got It.
Okay,

1262
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:21.240
cool.
This is making a lot more sense now because I,
I've never really felt

1263
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:23.611
confident.

1264
01:13:23.611 --> 01:13:25.920
I think part of it is that I'm usually drunk when I'm trying to have these

1265
01:13:25.921 --> 01:13:29.340
conversations,
but to have a whiskey conversation,

1266
01:13:29.341 --> 01:13:32.460
which has been actually a handicap for me in some cases because I spend quite a

1267
01:13:32.461 --> 01:13:35.790
lot of time in Japan and they love their whiskey and well,

1268
01:13:35.791 --> 01:13:40.580
I mean it doesn't help that we're also speaking Japanese,
but uh,
so what,

1269
01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:42.300
so what are we looking at here?
We have similar,

1270
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:46.920
looking at a Bourbon for Jack Daniels.
We're looking at e h Taylor,

1271
01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:51.840
a rye,
which is so whiskey made in America,
but rise predominant grain.

1272
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:55.020
You're looking at Jamieson straight up Irish whiskey.

1273
01:13:55.530 --> 01:14:00.270
We're looking at a nica Takut soro 17 year old Japanese whiskey.

1274
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:03.360
Yup.
Um,
we're looking at Edward Hour,

1275
01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:07.590
which is low lower part of the highlands in Scotland,
a region in Scotland,

1276
01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:11.980
a whiskey,
but mainland Scotland is the key.
Um,
so Azure dour 10

1277
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.910
<v 5>year old and we're looking at Ardbeg,
um,
specifically,
it's called [inaudible],</v>

1278
01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:19.660
which is a,
it's a scotch made on the island of Islah,

1279
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:21.160
which is off the coast.

1280
01:14:21.161 --> 01:14:24.010
And so very different than mainland Scotland because you're right on the ocean.

1281
01:14:24.850 --> 01:14:29.260
And so we'll see in the six glasses that the difference that grain contributes

1282
01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:33.160
and we'll see the different types of oak and what that contributes and then how

1283
01:14:33.161 --> 01:14:36.700
place really influences the final product.
Cool.
I'm going to,

1284
01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:40.390
I'm going to go grab a camera because I want to take a photograph of this for

1285
01:14:40.391 --> 01:14:41.620
folks.
Before we get into it,

1286
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:46.660
could you please describe or explain the tattoos that you have?

1287
01:14:46.661 --> 01:14:48.820
Why do you have the tattoos that you have and where do they have?

1288
01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:52.990
So on my right arm is a dandelion.

1289
01:14:54.190 --> 01:14:57.320
It's a love note to a woman named Carla [inaudible],

1290
01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:01.220
who I love more than I've ever loved anybody.
Actually.

1291
01:15:01.221 --> 01:15:04.810
It didn't think it was possible.
It's great.
Uh,
and she has something very,

1292
01:15:04.811 --> 01:15:08.940
very similar,
very similar to analyze Candyland.
Why a dandelion,
you know,
it's,
I,

1293
01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:14.100
I'm a big fan of how a dandelion changes so rapidly through its life.

1294
01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:18.490
And I loved the part where it ends up with a great big shoot and it actually

1295
01:15:18.491 --> 01:15:22.510
depends on the wind to disburse it seeds.
I think that's just a,
it's a beautiful,

1296
01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:26.790
quiet,
profound thing that poetic.
Yeah,
it's really,
really pretty.
And uh,

1297
01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:30.940
put a left arm.
It's a collection of memories of and of things that,

1298
01:15:30.970 --> 01:15:34.180
that have made me happy,
um,
over time.
And there's Mount Vesuvius,

1299
01:15:34.181 --> 01:15:38.230
which I had probably the most amazing single day of my life on.
Um,
where is that?

1300
01:15:38.410 --> 01:15:42.640
It's just off of,
of Naples and central southern Italy.
Um,

1301
01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:43.690
there's a fish on a bun,

1302
01:15:43.691 --> 01:15:48.640
so think of Fish Burger and a mermaid and a heart and that's an Ode to a

1303
01:15:48.670 --> 01:15:53.020
mermaid.
I fell in love with Carla.
Uh,
fell in love with eating fish on a bun,

1304
01:15:53.021 --> 01:15:56.860
sandwiches at the cup and saucer diner on the corner of canal and Eldridge in

1305
01:15:56.861 --> 01:15:59.050
Chinatown in Manhattan.
Um,

1306
01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:03.680
there's a seashell with some,
uh,

1307
01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:06.770
sea critters in it that are from a,
um,

1308
01:16:07.450 --> 01:16:12.190
a story I spun for my daughter called Samuel the sea cucumber and he and his

1309
01:16:12.191 --> 01:16:16.090
friends managed to travel around the entire globe,
um,

1310
01:16:16.150 --> 01:16:20.570
in a sea shell tethered to a piece of seaweed and we use it as a,

1311
01:16:20.571 --> 01:16:22.780
as a lesson in a geography.

1312
01:16:22.781 --> 01:16:26.170
And this is a story that you made up or story that you read that I made up.

1313
01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:29.860
That's awesome.
I would spin it to her every night at bed.
And so just keep going.

1314
01:16:29.861 --> 01:16:32.350
And you know,
that's how the princess bride came to be.
Also.

1315
01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:35.560
That was a story that William Goldman would tell his I think might've been his

1316
01:16:35.561 --> 01:16:38.920
daughter or his son and then eventually put it down.
Oh,
that's awesome.

1317
01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:43.210
That's really great.
What's the 27 27 born in the 27,

1318
01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:46.120
27 is a lucky number for me.

1319
01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:49.420
And over and over and over it keeps repeating itself.
And in this case,

1320
01:16:49.450 --> 01:16:51.060
the red above the gold,
um,

1321
01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:54.850
are from an apartment that I shared with a Carla in Chinatown.

1322
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:57.460
And there were actually three 27 from the building where they were just,

1323
01:16:57.850 --> 01:17:00.280
there was the original address and then I'll got painted over and they stuck

1324
01:17:00.281 --> 01:17:04.150
another 27 on it and 100 years later it had Patina and they stuck another 27 on

1325
01:17:04.151 --> 01:17:08.470
it and they just as beautiful,
such cool.
And he said it was very cool.
Be Nice,

1326
01:17:08.471 --> 01:17:10.100
be nice.
Um,

1327
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.600
<v 2>it's,
you know,
it started as a B and it was in there for 10 years all by itself.</v>

1328
01:17:14.690 --> 01:17:17.740
Sbe No,
just,
just the letter B.
And it was,
it was,

1329
01:17:17.850 --> 01:17:20.750
it's kind of on the inside so it was a note to self to just be kind,

1330
01:17:20.751 --> 01:17:25.740
be thoughtful,
benevolent,
take your time,
just be a good guy,
you know?
And,

1331
01:17:25.741 --> 01:17:30.260
and sometimes I thrash about and it's a little reminder note to self.

1332
01:17:30.330 --> 01:17:35.270
Right.
Um,
and it just grew into be nice and just plain and simple.

1333
01:17:35.570 --> 01:17:38.990
What about the safety meeting and what is that?
So,
oh,

1334
01:17:38.991 --> 01:17:41.720
it's some type of a mythological creature between the safety and the meeting.

1335
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:46.700
Yeah,
it's a dragon off with the corona bottle.
What's the story there?

1336
01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:49.010
It's a shout out of my homeys from the little nowhere.

1337
01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.930
We would have safety meetings if you were,

1338
01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:53.090
this is like one of the joys of restaurant work.

1339
01:17:53.091 --> 01:17:56.240
He'd be on the floor and you'd be in the weeds or someone be yelling at you

1340
01:17:56.241 --> 01:17:59.870
about something and you just look at your favorite waiter and we'd say safety

1341
01:17:59.871 --> 01:18:02.570
meeting.
And we both knew that meant walk into the kitchen,

1342
01:18:02.571 --> 01:18:06.620
walk into my white wine cooler,
lock the door from the inside,
pound a corona,

1343
01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:12.190
walk back out on the floor and rock service.
Very

1344
01:18:14.130 --> 01:18:17.830
[inaudible].
See if team meeting,
uh,

1345
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:21.560
I was just talking to someone who shall remain unnamed but very,

1346
01:18:21.561 --> 01:18:25.890
very high performer and uh,
uh,
he,

1347
01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:28.550
he with his friends would have,

1348
01:18:28.551 --> 01:18:32.120
they'd have some harebrained question that usually had dangerous implications

1349
01:18:32.121 --> 01:18:33.410
and they would say,
well,
let's play,

1350
01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:37.910
let's find out was let's play the game of,

1351
01:18:37.911 --> 01:18:42.290
let's find out.
So good.
Oh,
so I,
I interrupted you the cause I was,

1352
01:18:42.291 --> 01:18:45.110
I want to take photos of this for people and for those people,

1353
01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:46.730
go to the show notes and you'll get,

1354
01:18:46.970 --> 01:18:48.620
you'll find links to everything we're talking about,

1355
01:18:48.621 --> 01:18:51.110
but you also find the photographs.
Who does,
that's just four hour work,

1356
01:18:51.111 --> 01:18:53.660
week.com all spelled out and click on podcast.

1357
01:18:53.661 --> 01:18:56.300
And you'll also see photographs of some of the audio gear that I'm using here.

1358
01:18:56.690 --> 01:19:00.470
But,
um,
so I'm excited about this.
So what's,
what's the next step then?

1359
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:04.070
So the next step is you're going to smell the first,

1360
01:19:04.190 --> 01:19:07.400
which is Jack Daniels Bourbon.
Okay.
And the second,

1361
01:19:07.401 --> 01:19:11.000
which is the e h Taylor Rye.
Okay.
Am I,

1362
01:19:11.001 --> 01:19:13.510
am I looking for anything in particular or just impressions?

1363
01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:15.710
So the real thing here is,
okay,

1364
01:19:15.711 --> 01:19:18.890
so they're both aged and new charred American oak,
not,

1365
01:19:18.891 --> 01:19:20.930
they're both made in America and Asian America.

1366
01:19:20.931 --> 01:19:23.810
So wood in place are relatively equal.

1367
01:19:24.230 --> 01:19:29.230
The big difference is that the Bourbon is 51% at least corn and the rye is rye.

1368
01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:34.970
And so when we talk about what are the three things that inform a whiskey while

1369
01:19:34.971 --> 01:19:37.790
the first one is grain,
and that's what I want to illustrate for you here.
I'm,

1370
01:19:37.791 --> 01:19:39.230
I'm,
hopefully you can smell the difference.

1371
01:19:39.231 --> 01:19:44.150
The Rice should be more pungent and spicy.
Okay.
Let's see.
One moment folks.

1372
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:47.720
He's got his nose all the way in that beaker.

1373
01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:53.630
This is like golf commentary like Yup.
Oh yeah.
It's crazy,
isn't it?
Yeah,

1374
01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:57.680
it's a huge difference.
Yeah.
To rise actually.
Classically,

1375
01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:02.020
I mean it's been around forever,
but also it's using a Manhattan.
Yeah,
it's got,

1376
01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:07.140
it has almost like a,
a more of a pain like bite to it.

1377
01:20:07.230 --> 01:20:09.570
Okay,
so that maybe not paint,

1378
01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:12.480
maybe it's paint thinner that I'm thinking of her like a Turpentine,

1379
01:20:12.481 --> 01:20:16.830
you get that barn.
She thing with protracted aging in a barrel so it does take,

1380
01:20:16.831 --> 01:20:20.820
take that on.
So that's a function of time.
I spend time.
Got It.
Got It.

1381
01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:24.600
The spice from the grain itself should also be there and you know it plays in

1382
01:20:24.601 --> 01:20:27.060
the same,
in the same area.
When I smell things,

1383
01:20:27.061 --> 01:20:31.680
I think about it a lot like musical ranges.
And so the base,
you know,

1384
01:20:31.681 --> 01:20:36.240
hangs out down here and there's rich things like chocolate and the vanilla can

1385
01:20:36.241 --> 01:20:37.980
happen down in there.
Sometimes.
A question,

1386
01:20:37.981 --> 01:20:40.020
does it ever take your nose time to warm up?

1387
01:20:40.021 --> 01:20:42.960
Cause I feel like I just smelled this like the fourth time and I'm getting a lot

1388
01:20:42.961 --> 01:20:47.520
more from 100% is that as another key would be open your mouth.
When you smell,

1389
01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:51.720
everyone likes slams,
their mouth shut and you actually get less information.

1390
01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:55.350
It's really open to,
what is it called?
The retroactive retro nasal hot.
Damn it,

1391
01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:59.160
it was so close,
but it makes a huge difference.

1392
01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:04.020
And don't,
you know,
for those of you listening,
don't like take a hard pull on it,

1393
01:21:04.021 --> 01:21:05.940
like you do wine or it'll actually really burn.

1394
01:21:05.941 --> 01:21:09.060
So with spirits you can smell really gently.
Yeah.

1395
01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:13.860
The alcohol will want to give yourself a alcohol awry.
Nasal irrigation.

1396
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:17.410
Yeah.
So I mean it almost smells like a Rye bread.
Yeah.

1397
01:21:17.490 --> 01:21:21.810
Which is so interesting that that actually comes through.
Yeah,
it does.

1398
01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.530
You're right.
Yeah.
And then this guy,
the,

1399
01:21:23.531 --> 01:21:27.450
the Jack Daniels just smells her suite and round and it doesn't have any of that

1400
01:21:27.451 --> 01:21:32.100
same spice.
So that's the first piece.
Grape.
The next piece,

1401
01:21:32.650 --> 01:21:36.690
we're green in this compartment.
Grain exactly.
Of Grape and grain.
My favorite.

1402
01:21:36.730 --> 01:21:40.170
That's,
that could be,
it could be your next book title.
It should be,

1403
01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:45.060
um,
well we have to throw a Gavi and they're so succulence.
Um,

1404
01:21:45.210 --> 01:21:47.190
the next is Irish.

1405
01:21:47.370 --> 01:21:50.640
And so as Jamieson and just straight Jamison,

1406
01:21:50.641 --> 01:21:54.630
which is a brand going crazy,
but what makes Irish,
Irish,

1407
01:21:54.631 --> 01:21:57.480
and I just want you to think about it as it compares to the things before,

1408
01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:02.280
is that I'm frequently,
they distill more than twice,

1409
01:22:02.281 --> 01:22:03.920
three times.
Um,

1410
01:22:04.230 --> 01:22:08.430
and the farther you go with the distillation or you can even use a column still,

1411
01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:12.210
which means not bother ourselves with the point is the farther you go with the

1412
01:22:12.211 --> 01:22:15.120
distillation,
the more you take out of it.
Right?

1413
01:22:15.121 --> 01:22:18.090
So if we start with our beer is a hundred liters and we distill it,

1414
01:22:18.091 --> 01:22:21.450
we ended up with,
I don't know what,
at 30 liters.
And if you distill that again,

1415
01:22:21.630 --> 01:22:26.100
maybe now you're at 15 liters and he was still at again and now you're at seven

1416
01:22:26.101 --> 01:22:26.820
and a half liters.

1417
01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:31.620
Is it subsequently removing more of the characteristics that make it unique?

1418
01:22:31.621 --> 01:22:35.640
And that's exactly what you're getting closer to rubbing alcohol.
That's 100%.

1419
01:22:35.641 --> 01:22:39.640
You're all over vodka essentially.
So it has nothing to say,
um,

1420
01:22:39.810 --> 01:22:42.540
that has something to say,
but it's not saying it very loudly.

1421
01:22:42.541 --> 01:22:47.010
So that's a very Irish thing to do.
This is like the Catholic school version,

1422
01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:51.720
exact last spoke when spoken to a hundred percent,
hundred percent.
So it's,

1423
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:55.860
it's um,
it's,
this is where process is a function of place.

1424
01:22:55.890 --> 01:22:59.700
And so this is typically what happens with the vast majority by volume of,

1425
01:22:59.790 --> 01:23:02.390
of Irish whiskey idea.
Why they do that.
Because I would,

1426
01:23:02.490 --> 01:23:06.100
I'm just thinking back to like Ireland,
potato famine.
Why would

1427
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:10.190
<v 0>they take such a high volume of stuff and make it smooth and make it,</v>

1428
01:23:10.430 --> 01:23:14.880
make it so much smaller?
Reducing.
Yeah.
Now it's a,
it's a great question.
Um,

1429
01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:18.560
I think it was really a matter of,
of what people favored in terms of drinking.

1430
01:23:19.090 --> 01:23:21.430
And so it's so different than Scotland in,

1431
01:23:21.431 --> 01:23:25.130
each of them were competing for the royal favor.
You know,
what are,

1432
01:23:25.140 --> 01:23:29.170
what are people gonna drink and what's going to be the drink?
Right.
They're very,

1433
01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:31.510
very different and they've each enjoyed popularity at different times.

1434
01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:32.840
So Jamieson [inaudible].

1435
01:23:33.100 --> 01:23:37.090
This should bring back some memories for me because I remember being in Dublin

1436
01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:39.700
and this was in for those of you who read the four hour work week,

1437
01:23:39.701 --> 01:23:44.701
this was in 2000 late 2004 I had just landed,

1438
01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.700
I was in London than Ireland was recommended,

1439
01:23:48.701 --> 01:23:50.500
landed in Dublin and later they said,

1440
01:23:50.501 --> 01:23:52.720
what the hell are you doing in Dublin and should go to Galway and that's how I

1441
01:23:52.721 --> 01:23:54.790
ended up there.
But the,

1442
01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:58.480
I got really into hurling and getting sponsors,

1443
01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:02.710
the senior sort of nationals and the competition for this,

1444
01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:04.450
for those who haven't seen hurling,

1445
01:24:04.630 --> 01:24:06.790
not the puking game that's also popular in Ireland,

1446
01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:09.640
but it's the fastest field sport in the world.

1447
01:24:09.641 --> 01:24:14.641
It's like Lacrosse plus baseball with axe handles on a soccer field.

1448
01:24:15.611 --> 01:24:17.980
It's extremely violent.
Fantastic game.

1449
01:24:18.250 --> 01:24:21.160
But I want to take a tour of the Guinness Factory as a result.

1450
01:24:21.190 --> 01:24:23.980
I was just curious.
I don't really drink beer.
Yup.
Got on a bus.

1451
01:24:23.981 --> 01:24:25.450
It was a hop on hop off bus,

1452
01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:30.160
got to the Guinness factory or a brewery I suppose.

1453
01:24:30.161 --> 01:24:34.280
Massive as you'd imagine.
And the line was,

1454
01:24:34.350 --> 01:24:36.850
this was probably nine 30 in the morning and the line was just hundreds of

1455
01:24:36.851 --> 01:24:41.440
people now.
And I opted out.
I was like,
Nah,
I don't even really drink beer.

1456
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:45.010
If it were easy,
I would do it,
but no thanks.
A few stops later,

1457
01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:49.840
the Jamison distillery shows up and I'm like,
okay,
sure,
let's check it out.

1458
01:24:49.841 --> 01:24:50.800
I go in and they go,
okay,

1459
01:24:50.801 --> 01:24:53.220
well for later we're going to need a few volunteers and raise my hand.

1460
01:24:53.230 --> 01:24:57.280
They pick maybe two or three of us and later we have to do a tasting,

1461
01:24:57.790 --> 01:24:59.970
but a marathon tasting.

1462
01:24:59.971 --> 01:25:04.490
And so all of us wander out at like 10:00 AM completely shit faced.

1463
01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:08.310
Awesome.
Awesome.
That was my introduction to Jameson.
I love it.
So am I,

1464
01:25:08.330 --> 01:25:12.340
should I smell for anything in particular?
I think just relative to the last one.

1465
01:25:12.341 --> 01:25:12.671
So again,

1466
01:25:12.671 --> 01:25:16.450
this is like developing your context and I mean I have some things that I

1467
01:25:16.990 --> 01:25:19.390
attribute to Irish whiskey,
um,

1468
01:25:19.810 --> 01:25:22.120
but I would rather you smell unfettered.

1469
01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:28.990
Ain't no,
it's a very subtle part here.
Let us just a little bit.
Yeah,

1470
01:25:28.991 --> 01:25:33.400
it is subtle.
Exactly.
God,
I'm getting anxious.

1471
01:25:33.401 --> 01:25:37.840
Like a school child who Nada the exam naked.
No wrong answer.

1472
01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:41.370
It's that,
that's the whole key to this is that you just use your own vernacular.

1473
01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:45.220
I had a DVD that I have a deviated septum on one side of my,
in one nostril,

1474
01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:47.500
which has been bothering me for years.
Uh,

1475
01:25:48.010 --> 01:25:49.480
but I just thought I was at a stuffy nose.

1476
01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:52.573
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1477
01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:54.040
<v 0>I know that it's,</v>

1478
01:25:54.370 --> 01:25:59.030
it's much understated compared to the other two totally but are not sure.

1479
01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:03.770
And so why is vodka so popular?
Because it doesn't taste like,
you know,

1480
01:26:03.771 --> 01:26:04.700
and you can mix it with things.

1481
01:26:05.370 --> 01:26:10.370
So that subtlety and it's Amie ability make it actually quite popular for

1482
01:26:11.361 --> 01:26:14.490
flexible,
very flexible,
very easy to drink.
Um,

1483
01:26:14.690 --> 01:26:17.880
it's a little bit lower proof than the rye porridge you,
um,
you know,

1484
01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:21.860
more percentage alcohol.
Um,
so for me that,

1485
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:25.820
that comes from the process associated with the place,
you know,
keep distilling,

1486
01:26:25.821 --> 01:26:28.740
you keep thinking,
taking things out.
It has less to say and it's means.

1487
01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:29.960
So it was kind of grassy,

1488
01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:34.370
kind of urby and a little bit of like a honey thing maybe.
But you know,

1489
01:26:34.371 --> 01:26:38.000
those are just personal adjectives.
What would it,
I mean,
have you found,

1490
01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:43.820
is the nose like
height,

1491
01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:48.380
meaning like you are born with a certain knows and uh,
it's,
it's,

1492
01:26:48.381 --> 01:26:51.620
it's maybe malleable a little bit,
but not very,

1493
01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:56.680
or is it like muscle where you can develop it?

1494
01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:00.110
I think it's totally trainable.
My Dad's a great example.
He was like,

1495
01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:01.740
I can't smell anything.
And you know,

1496
01:27:01.741 --> 01:27:05.450
and her sons getting into wine and now he can smell everything and it's just,

1497
01:27:05.451 --> 01:27:09.300
it's like a radio.
You just have to tune it in.
Right.
And once you get there,
um,

1498
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:13.820
I think it fits a greedy.
I'm like my dog,
I've stuck my nose right into it.
It's,

1499
01:27:13.821 --> 01:27:16.760
um,
you know,
when,
when we were hunter gatherers,

1500
01:27:16.761 --> 01:27:19.940
we depended on this scent of smell for life.
Right?
You know,

1501
01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:23.300
I can eat that or I can't eat that.
That's rod and that's poison,
whatever it is.

1502
01:27:23.301 --> 01:27:26.840
And it's,
we don't have to rely on it at all to the same degree.

1503
01:27:26.841 --> 01:27:30.890
So it's the first of the senses that we tune out.
And so when you get into this,

1504
01:27:30.891 --> 01:27:32.390
it's a matter of just tuning in back in.

1505
01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:35.930
I think part of that is the amount and the frequency with which we eat.
When I,

1506
01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:39.650
I've done a number of fascinating experiments and for instance,
I just fasted,

1507
01:27:40.130 --> 01:27:44.090
I broke a fast last night,
so I fasted for,
uh,
the short fast for me,

1508
01:27:44.091 --> 01:27:45.320
like 48 hours.
Okay.

1509
01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:50.210
And your evolutionary biology upgrades,
your smell immediately,

1510
01:27:50.330 --> 01:27:55.330
like whatever brainpower is dedicated elsewhere is suddenly harnessed for the

1511
01:27:57.081 --> 01:28:00.290
nose.
It's really interesting.
That's super cool.
Very,
very cool.

1512
01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:04.310
They do that for a falconry also.
I understand it is.

1513
01:28:04.311 --> 01:28:09.080
If they're doing hunting or any type of precision work with Falcons,

1514
01:28:09.081 --> 01:28:12.110
they will,
lab starves a hard word,

1515
01:28:12.111 --> 01:28:16.010
but they'll restrict their food so their senses are sharpened.
That's amazing.

1516
01:28:16.011 --> 01:28:19.490
Yeah.
Pretty good.
Uh,
yeah,
if you guys want to see something crazy,

1517
01:28:19.491 --> 01:28:23.660
you can watch falconry in Mongolia where they hunt deer with falcons.
Uh,

1518
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:26.180
so what's,
let's see,
we were here.
Yup.
The Jameson,

1519
01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:29.300
we're gonna leave Ireland and we're going to go to Japan.

1520
01:28:29.710 --> 01:28:33.290
And so the Japanese model is very much based on the Scotch model,

1521
01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:37.460
which you're going to have in the last two glasses.
Um,
so malted barley.

1522
01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:40.940
So this is really a single malt when it's a single mall or you read that on a

1523
01:28:40.941 --> 01:28:43.700
bottle,
just means that it's made from malted barley.
The Jamison,

1524
01:28:43.730 --> 01:28:48.200
what are the grains and the Jamison?
Um,
so barley,
wheat,
rye.

1525
01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:52.130
Okay.
No corn.
That makes sense.
I,
you know,
they're born could be corner here,

1526
01:28:52.131 --> 01:28:54.230
but it's definitely the primary.
Exactly.

1527
01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:58.190
And then the Japanese is the malted barley is malted barley.

1528
01:28:58.220 --> 01:29:00.920
And so those guys took their cues from Scotland as to how to do,

1529
01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:02.790
and they're very much trying to,

1530
01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:06.570
to your tried to emulate what they did in Scotland,

1531
01:29:06.930 --> 01:29:11.460
but it happens to Japan.
So it has,
the place factor is a,
is a big,
big difference.

1532
01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:13.080
And I always get some,
um,

1533
01:29:13.230 --> 01:29:17.130
for me it feels you have a much deeper understanding of Japan than I do.
But I,

1534
01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:21.930
I always find things to be very subtle and very beautiful and very complicated,

1535
01:29:21.931 --> 01:29:26.680
but not outwardly.
So it's not Austin tissue.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Um,

1536
01:29:26.890 --> 01:29:31.110
so I love Japanese with smells delicious.
It smells very floral to me.
Yeah.

1537
01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:35.690
So that's it.
You're right on it.
Tim's actually great taster.
Give me,

1538
01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:40.590
I appreciate the pad on the podcast to your bag,
but I got the floral.
Uh,

1539
01:29:40.650 --> 01:29:44.730
so that's,
that's definitely is also love barley.
So one of my favorite things,

1540
01:29:44.731 --> 01:29:49.500
the part of the reason that I'm liking this artichoke tea that I'm keeping cold

1541
01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:50.010
Yup.

1542
01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:55.010
Is I really became a fan of huge fan of barley tea.

1543
01:29:56.101 --> 01:29:59.190
I think it's barley tea.
Mcgee Cha.
Yeah,
go for it.
Uh,

1544
01:29:59.310 --> 01:30:04.200
there's a tea called [inaudible],
m u g I cha is just t c h a,
c h,

1545
01:30:04.201 --> 01:30:06.840
a.
W.
It's like,
you know,
if you have,

1546
01:30:06.841 --> 01:30:09.780
even in Chinese it's the same like Oo Long Cha Cha is the same thing,

1547
01:30:09.781 --> 01:30:11.280
but the Mcgee Char,
they,

1548
01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:16.080
they use in the summer and drink cold.
Cool.
Uh,
so they,

1549
01:30:16.110 --> 01:30:20.550
there barley's is used elsewhere in Japan,
but I get a very,
yeah,

1550
01:30:20.551 --> 01:30:22.340
you guys should try that out if you have the chance.
Uh,

1551
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:26.430
or you can trust them if some children artichoke t without anything else.
But,
uh,

1552
01:30:27.450 --> 01:30:30.060
I really liked the smell of this.
And this is,
what is this called again?

1553
01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:35.300
So this is from a Nika and it's specifically Taketsuru Taketsuru and 17 years

1554
01:30:35.371 --> 01:30:39.860
old kids that it's like Tuck it to do is like,
uh,
uh,

1555
01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:43.980
bamboo crane.
I think somebody can correct me here,
but so do I think is crane.

1556
01:30:43.981 --> 01:30:47.670
It might be heron,
but pocket is,
uh,
uh,

1557
01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:50.910
I think it's like she talk it or no,
maybe those are two different,
uh,

1558
01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:54.990
that maybe isn't the mushroom but bamboo.
That's cool.
That's very cool.

1559
01:30:55.020 --> 01:30:55.801
It's very cool.
Well,

1560
01:30:55.801 --> 01:30:59.190
that floral thing you hit on and sometimes referred to as the old temple and

1561
01:30:59.191 --> 01:31:02.250
this whole whiskey temple see incense,

1562
01:31:02.251 --> 01:31:06.270
Cedar and Sandalwood.
Oh,
what an amazing smell.
Isn't that cool?

1563
01:31:06.330 --> 01:31:11.040
That smells really good.
So that's made a whole lot like this next one is made,

1564
01:31:11.630 --> 01:31:16.200
entered our front is dot Edward Hour.
Had a hell do you spell that?

1565
01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:20.940
E.
Spell it.
E.
D.
R.
A.
D.
O.
U.
R.
[inaudible].
Got It.

1566
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:25.980
And so that's from mainland Scotland.
So the big variable here is place.

1567
01:31:26.490 --> 01:31:29.760
Right?
And so all things being equal,

1568
01:31:29.761 --> 01:31:31.860
you've got Japan versus mainland Scotland.
Yeah.

1569
01:31:34.090 --> 01:31:34.770
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1570
01:31:34.770 --> 01:31:37.080
<v 0>Very different.
So differently.
Different.
Right.</v>

1571
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.970
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1572
01:31:38.970 --> 01:31:41.040
<v 0>God,
you know,
I need to smell more things.</v>

1573
01:31:41.041 --> 01:31:44.910
I need to like follow my puppy around and smell everything or most things,

1574
01:31:44.911 --> 01:31:46.350
not everything my puppy likes.
I'd like,

1575
01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:51.150
I'm having a really tough time penny down,
but it has a very,

1576
01:31:51.151 --> 01:31:54.000
very particular scent to it.
What would you,

1577
01:31:56.290 --> 01:32:00.250
Oh man,
it's fun to poke at it.
And then when,
when all of you are at smelling,

1578
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:01.450
<v 2>they shouldn't,
you shouldn't rush.</v>

1579
01:32:01.451 --> 01:32:06.451
I would say one of the great joys of smelling and tasting things and if I had to

1580
01:32:07.211 --> 01:32:10.300
pick one particular moment,
um,
I,

1581
01:32:10.301 --> 01:32:12.520
first time I smelled of Rutherglen Muscat,

1582
01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:17.290
Muscat dessert wine made in Ruther Glen Australia and I'd never had one before.

1583
01:32:17.291 --> 01:32:20.830
And I picked it up and I smelled the glass and immediately I was back in fifth

1584
01:32:20.831 --> 01:32:23.980
grade afterschool running through my grandmother's front door and she just

1585
01:32:23.981 --> 01:32:26.860
pulled ginger snaps out of the oven.
And that memory,
I mean,

1586
01:32:26.890 --> 01:32:28.840
I was 35 years old when that happened.

1587
01:32:28.841 --> 01:32:33.640
And like the Ratatouille in the movie one Anton Ego.
It's the routed to exactly.

1588
01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:37.600
So it's a cool but and so however old each of us are,

1589
01:32:37.601 --> 01:32:40.780
we have that many years of memory based on smell.

1590
01:32:40.810 --> 01:32:43.960
And it's so cool to let those just come floating back to you.

1591
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:45.160
I can't pin this down.

1592
01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:49.870
I want to say it's like a very dark chocolate or something.
But I,
I'm with you.

1593
01:32:49.930 --> 01:32:53.740
Yeah,
I,
I can't,
I can't quite nail it.

1594
01:32:53.741 --> 01:32:58.350
It's a very familiar smell to me that isn't Scotch.
But what would you,
I mean,

1595
01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:01.090
how would you describe this?
What descriptors would you use?
For me,
this is,

1596
01:33:01.091 --> 01:33:03.820
this is actually quite rich and it's actually,

1597
01:33:03.821 --> 01:33:06.850
it does have this sort of malted milkshake thing,
the vanilla park,

1598
01:33:06.851 --> 01:33:09.220
but it also has a lot of oak on it.

1599
01:33:09.730 --> 01:33:14.290
So it does have that richness that almost milk chocolate caramel,

1600
01:33:14.690 --> 01:33:17.230
the Nela.
That's a thing.
I mean it's,

1601
01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:21.430
it's pretty round and voluptuous for Scotch.

1602
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:25.120
I stuck a milkshake as I kind of milkshake type smell too.
Exactly.

1603
01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:28.320
So what did they put in the milkshake?
Just Malt.
That's true.

1604
01:33:28.330 --> 01:33:31.090
That's all from the milkshake.
That's smells like the mall.

1605
01:33:31.570 --> 01:33:32.680
That's what I'm associating on.
Right.

1606
01:33:32.681 --> 01:33:36.580
Because I've had more milkshakes and I have had scotch if Nicole that is cool.

1607
01:33:36.610 --> 01:33:41.110
That's super cool.
Okay,
so the last glass,
same country,
Scotland,

1608
01:33:41.111 --> 01:33:44.980
but now you're out on an island where the,
the cast,

1609
01:33:44.981 --> 01:33:47.410
so this is really about place.
And so,

1610
01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:51.340
so same process in terms of making this stuff,
um,

1611
01:33:51.670 --> 01:33:55.870
in terms of distillation and cask gauging,
but were cascading.
Yeah,
exactly.

1612
01:33:55.871 --> 01:33:59.050
But when you're a type of wood or the aging and end,
so great question.

1613
01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:04.080
Used barrels from Jack Daniels amongst other bourbon producers and you Sherry

1614
01:34:04.451 --> 01:34:06.460
barrels.
So from the south of Spain,

1615
01:34:06.490 --> 01:34:10.210
use Madeira barrels from the island of Madeira and Sherry barrels are made out

1616
01:34:10.211 --> 01:34:13.500
of what type is that also oats.
All Oak to all.
Okay.
And so if you,

1617
01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:17.470
or any type of cascading that is not done in Oh yeah,
there's a chestnut,

1618
01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:21.370
which is common in northern Italy,
but that's,
that's more for wine.
Got It.
Got It,

1619
01:34:21.371 --> 01:34:25.900
got it.
Exactly.
All right,
so these,
this all happens by the ocean.

1620
01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:29.170
So there's the use of Pete.
This last one.
Yeah,
exactly.

1621
01:34:29.171 --> 01:34:33.480
So place matters a lot here because Pete is used,
um,

1622
01:34:33.610 --> 01:34:36.610
in a really profound way.
So when we malt the barley,
right,

1623
01:34:36.611 --> 01:34:39.250
you're taking the borrower,
you're getting it wet,
you're letting it sprout,

1624
01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:44.050
and then we halt that sprouting process with heat and the heat comes from

1625
01:34:44.051 --> 01:34:48.790
burning peat.
And so in this case,
in this case,
Alaska on the island.
Yeah.

1626
01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:53.620
What is it's a moss,
right?
Or,
yeah,
it's,
it's essentially a stage short of coal.

1627
01:34:53.621 --> 01:34:58.010
So it's compressed dead grass,
dead moss and it sorts of,
uh,

1628
01:34:58.370 --> 01:35:02.380
<v 0>cut it out in like bricks of really dark looking Adobe almost you're saying.</v>

1629
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:05.780
So it's like cow dung that you would burn for fuel and Mongolian eight.

1630
01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:08.840
Interesting.
So that flavors it,

1631
01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:13.580
but then also you age these casks by the Se side.
Yeah.

1632
01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:16.070
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1633
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:20.870
<v 0>I get things like in addition to smoke iodine brine salty.
Yeah.</v>

1634
01:35:20.871 --> 01:35:25.580
It does have a briny.
Yeah.
A briny uh,
Bryony smell to it.

1635
01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:28.373
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1636
01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:31.670
<v 0>So different,
isn't it crazy?
Yeah.
That's cool.
Yeah.
This is fun guys.</v>

1637
01:35:31.671 --> 01:35:36.440
You should definitely do this.
Um,
is the short strokes with it.

1638
01:35:36.441 --> 01:35:38.300
So you just put some things next to each other.

1639
01:35:38.301 --> 01:35:41.540
And you can really supercharge your learning since,
okay.

1640
01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:44.900
So what is place do well,
you've just seen,
what does OIC do?
Well,

1641
01:35:44.901 --> 01:35:46.550
you've just seen,
you can treat it like a workout.
I mean,

1642
01:35:46.551 --> 01:35:49.190
you treat it like an actual learning session.
Exactly.
Yeah.

1643
01:35:49.191 --> 01:35:52.150
So you're sort of separate the recreation from learning,

1644
01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:55.970
even though you can transport the learning then to the enjoyment by exactly.

1645
01:35:56.390 --> 01:36:00.950
Keep the training separate.
So,
uh,
what's next?

1646
01:36:01.670 --> 01:36:04.430
What's next?
Uh,
we release a book on this stuff.

1647
01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:10.430
What's next as it relates to me with this,
this,
this plethora of drinking,

1648
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:15.770
drinking.
How would you know?
So I have six of these.
Yes.
In front of me.

1649
01:36:16.190 --> 01:36:20.690
Any particular order?
I would go in the same order that we taste it.
Actually,
no,

1650
01:36:20.691 --> 01:36:24.050
I'm going to put the Irish first.
It has the least to say.
Let's start.

1651
01:36:24.051 --> 01:36:27.780
There was the lightest it got it.
Okay.
So this is the Jamison.

1652
01:36:27.781 --> 01:36:31.280
There was the Jameson.
Exactly how much when you're tasting something like this,

1653
01:36:32.090 --> 01:36:36.380
um,
you know,
just a little bit enough to get it down your throat,
I think.
Um,

1654
01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:37.850
you know,
you see a lot of wine tasting,

1655
01:36:37.851 --> 01:36:41.750
everyone's spirits and so on and so forth,
and you should,
I mean,
first of all,

1656
01:36:41.751 --> 01:36:44.300
I want to advocate responsibility.
That's important.
You got it.

1657
01:36:44.301 --> 01:36:45.380
You got to do what's right for you.

1658
01:36:45.650 --> 01:36:48.350
But if you're really going to get the information and you have nowhere to go,

1659
01:36:48.351 --> 01:36:51.920
you got to swallow a little bit because you feel certain things in certain parts

1660
01:36:51.921 --> 01:36:56.720
of your mouth and they're also taste receptors.
Yeah.
Outside of the mouth.

1661
01:36:56.721 --> 01:37:00.170
A lot of people don't realize this and all the way down to the stomach even or,

1662
01:37:00.171 --> 01:37:03.040
I mean further through the Gi process.
Yeah.

1663
01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:09.890
Okay.
Since your first of the day,
see you probably feeling the alcohol.
Yeah.

1664
01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:13.670
But beyond that,
you know,
what do you feel?
Oh God,

1665
01:37:13.671 --> 01:37:16.610
I just feel like I lack the vocabulary here and be,

1666
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:19.970
I'm being asked to name musical notes,
but I don't know how to read sheet music.

1667
01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:22.640
Don't you don't read sheet music.
He's your own vocabulary.

1668
01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:26.973
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1669
01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:30.960
<v 0>This is like for those of you who've seen the chess lesson between Josh Waitzkin</v>

1670
01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:35.870
to myself,
it was an extra for the Tim Ferriss experiment.
My face,
uh,

1671
01:37:36.050 --> 01:37:37.770
looks about the same right now.
Uh,

1672
01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:42.380
the Irish should really have an answer and I don't have an answer yet.

1673
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:44.330
It doesn't really have a lot to say.

1674
01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:47.900
I it tastes kind of boozy and it tastes kind of thin and there's not a whole lot

1675
01:37:47.901 --> 01:37:51.280
that's,
that's okay.
That's pretty much what I would say.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1676
01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:53.750
I don't have a lot more to add to that.
Totally.
I mean,

1677
01:37:53.751 --> 01:37:55.800
you could add ginger ale and maybe make it,
I mean,

1678
01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:58.710
there's nothing wrong with Jamison,
but you know,
point,
point being like,
you know,

1679
01:37:58.711 --> 01:38:03.150
that's why it gets mixed with things.
Got It.
Got It.
Okay.
And Jack Daniels.

1680
01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:07.320
Jack Daniels,
and this is seven.
Yup.

1681
01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:11.340
Got It back to me.
Well,
corn,
essentially it's 10.
It's Tennessee whiskey.

1682
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:13.000
Tennessee whiskey.
Yeah.
Okay.

1683
01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:16.990
So what's the difference?
That's,

1684
01:38:17.010 --> 01:38:19.800
this is a question while you're tasting the difference between Tennessee whiskey

1685
01:38:19.801 --> 01:38:21.130
and Bourbon,
um,

1686
01:38:21.330 --> 01:38:25.880
is that Tennessee whiskey actually does have to come from Tennessee.
Hmm.
Um,

1687
01:38:25.950 --> 01:38:27.330
and it has,
if you come from Tennessee,

1688
01:38:27.331 --> 01:38:29.610
you actually have to go through this other thing called the Lincoln county

1689
01:38:29.611 --> 01:38:34.611
process where they filter the booze through a 10 foot column of charcoal,

1690
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.240
and that just takes out impurities.
And so it makes it smoother,
right?

1691
01:38:39.690 --> 01:38:43.230
But essentially the,
the Tennessee process,
apart from that,

1692
01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:47.880
that filtering and Bourbon are very,
very similar.
So I want to say,

1693
01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:48.780
I think I'm just,

1694
01:38:49.050 --> 01:38:52.680
I might be pulling rabbits out of a hat here and I don't even know there are

1695
01:38:52.681 --> 01:38:56.320
rabbits in the hat is a terrible metaphor,
but,
uh,

1696
01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:03.030
I get a more viscous sort of caramelly type experience.

1697
01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:04.580
Absolutely.
I'm

1698
01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:11.360
totally different from the Jamison that's due to the heavy corn use here,

1699
01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:13.980
and it's due to the new wood that's used here.

1700
01:39:14.190 --> 01:39:18.870
So the Jamison doesn't use the near the same amount of the charred new barrels

1701
01:39:18.871 --> 01:39:22.710
that the jack does.
And so it gives it that richness,
gives that viscosity.

1702
01:39:23.610 --> 01:39:28.530
Now what about,
um,
how would you explain?
For instance,

1703
01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:33.090
I went to Kentucky to visit drew Curtis,
who's a friend of mine.

1704
01:39:33.091 --> 01:39:35.730
At one point he runs a site called FARC,

1705
01:39:35.731 --> 01:39:39.150
which fark.com which is hilarious and amazing.
You should all check it out.

1706
01:39:40.110 --> 01:39:40.943
And we went,

1707
01:39:41.970 --> 01:39:46.970
we went through a lot of bourbon and whiskey and whatnot and I didn't really gel

1708
01:39:49.831 --> 01:39:54.831
with Bourbon until I had bullet bourbon and then have a bunch of,

1709
01:39:54.990 --> 01:39:59.820
you know,
kind of behind us in the,
in the cabinet a,
B,
u,
l,
l,
e,

1710
01:39:59.821 --> 01:40:04.410
I t in the way that someone explained that to me was it has a higher rye content

1711
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:06.070
and that's probably why you like it.

1712
01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:11.880
If you had to guess or two to explain that,
what would you say?

1713
01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:16.820
Like is it,
why did,
why was bought so much easier for me to drink?
I think it's a,

1714
01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:21.320
it's a little mean that compared to the Jack,
which I find somewhat showy,

1715
01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:25.530
you know,
it has a lot of,
the volume is turned up on just a couple of things.

1716
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:26.370
Yeah.
Um,

1717
01:40:26.370 --> 01:40:29.700
to me the volume is turned up quite as loud with the bullet and there may be

1718
01:40:29.701 --> 01:40:32.370
more pieces to it.
You know,
got almost a little finer,

1719
01:40:32.730 --> 01:40:35.880
has a little bit more cut on the pallet.
And I don't mean bludgeoned like,

1720
01:40:36.230 --> 01:40:39.780
you know,
straight punch in the face of flavor.
It just,
it's almost,
um,

1721
01:40:40.410 --> 01:40:44.430
more live and go in a certain noise.
Subdued.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Got It.

1722
01:40:44.431 --> 01:40:49.431
So it's like if you're listening to music and the base is out of control and

1723
01:40:49.441 --> 01:40:52.110
shaking your car yup.
The rest of it might be fine,

1724
01:40:52.111 --> 01:40:55.630
but you can't listen to it for long.
Exactly.
God,
that's interesting.
Yeah.

1725
01:40:55.631 --> 01:40:58.660
The bullets tasty.
I do.
I do like the bullet quite a bit.
So let's see,

1726
01:40:58.661 --> 01:41:02.110
we are on the e h Taylor Rye.
All right.

1727
01:41:05.230 --> 01:41:07.630
What did you think?
Sorry guys.

1728
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:13.190
These silences must be fascinating.
It's,
yeah,

1729
01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:17.470
it's,
it's very,
has a lot of bites.
So I struggled to,

1730
01:41:18.330 --> 01:41:21.190
Ooh,
Yup.
It comes from two things.
It has a lot of bites.

1731
01:41:21.191 --> 01:41:24.010
So I was still really struggling to try to separate the,

1732
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:28.590
and this is the one that I said smelled more like Turpentine.
To me it's,
um,

1733
01:41:29.650 --> 01:41:33.430
I was struggling to sort of separate that,

1734
01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:39.490
that like kick in the nuts from the flavor profile.

1735
01:41:39.491 --> 01:41:42.090
But I just,
I was having trouble.
I was traveling trouble doing it.

1736
01:41:42.091 --> 01:41:46.120
It takes practice,
practice,
practice,
practice.
So the,
the bite comes from,

1737
01:41:46.150 --> 01:41:49.630
you have 10% more alcohol here,
then the last one you to drink.

1738
01:41:49.631 --> 01:41:50.950
So I'm sure you feel that.

1739
01:41:51.310 --> 01:41:54.960
But also the rye gives it a bite and they sort of play in the same range.

1740
01:41:54.961 --> 01:41:57.840
When we were talking about musical ranges,
Turpentine,
um,

1741
01:41:57.970 --> 01:42:01.060
can also play in the same range as the ride.
They're all high toned aromatics.

1742
01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:04.510
What desire,
what do you mean by that?
So when I,
when I smell,

1743
01:42:04.511 --> 01:42:06.160
I think about the musical range and you know,

1744
01:42:06.170 --> 01:42:10.450
the fat notes or the base and then there's this Meza,
which everything has,

1745
01:42:10.451 --> 01:42:13.090
it's kind of,
uh,
you know,
neither here nor there.

1746
01:42:13.091 --> 01:42:17.230
But the alto tends to be where these,
these high tone notes of,

1747
01:42:17.470 --> 01:42:21.370
of flowers,
of spice,
um,
something like Turpentine,
these,

1748
01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:24.520
it's the stuff that lives up,
up high and you know,

1749
01:42:24.521 --> 01:42:28.150
you can almost physically feel that in your nose when you smell.
Oh,
oh yeah,

1750
01:42:28.151 --> 01:42:31.090
I did 100%.
Yeah.
Yeah,
it's pretty,
it's pretty interesting.

1751
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:35.500
And so the rye on the palate plays almost in the same vein as the alcohol that

1752
01:42:35.501 --> 01:42:39.010
serves to make it spicy and give it cut.
Huh?
No,
I was just wondering,

1753
01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:41.970
there are standardized tests for vision,
uh,

1754
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:43.870
and people have eye checks up checkups.

1755
01:42:43.870 --> 01:42:48.580
They go to the ophthalmologist or whatever their standardized tests for hearing.

1756
01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:53.180
Yes.
I can't think of anytime in my life where an iPad,
my smell tested.
Yeah.

1757
01:42:53.230 --> 01:42:56.320
Unless he faint.
They put the salts hundred those exist though.

1758
01:42:56.321 --> 01:43:00.980
I mean are there standardized smelling ability measurements of any time?

1759
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:05.290
Not that I know of.
Know what the hell's got.
I'll put that.
You know what,

1760
01:43:05.291 --> 01:43:07.190
I wouldn't endorse him even if there were,
I'm,

1761
01:43:07.191 --> 01:43:11.260
I'm a big believer in making this thing inclusive.
Not Exclusive.
No,
no,
no.

1762
01:43:11.261 --> 01:43:14.920
Understood.
But like for instance,
if you wanted to,
not exclusive in the same way,

1763
01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:17.200
like some people say if you have a mixed dog,

1764
01:43:17.201 --> 01:43:20.050
you shouldn't try to find out what the breed is because then you will impose on

1765
01:43:20.051 --> 01:43:24.370
that dog expectations.
And in the same way,
if you found out you had,
uh,

1766
01:43:24.870 --> 01:43:26.410
a low,
I'm interested in it.

1767
01:43:26.410 --> 01:43:29.970
Not so much to decide if I am a good or a bad smeller,

1768
01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:34.120
but to be able to track some type of progress.
Sure.
It goes a metric that's fair.

1769
01:43:34.121 --> 01:43:37.300
But just,
you know,
like if you wear glasses,
you can never fly a fighter plane.

1770
01:43:37.330 --> 01:43:40.000
I wouldn't want anyone to feel like they can't be a happy drinker if they,

1771
01:43:40.001 --> 01:43:43.930
you know,
I have a bad nose.
Right.
You feel condemned to not participate.

1772
01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:44.441
Fair enough.

1773
01:43:44.441 --> 01:43:48.670
I guess it depends on how quirky they're nerd them is when it comes to metrics

1774
01:43:48.671 --> 01:43:52.460
and tracking.
I have lots of foibles and a neuroses,

1775
01:43:52.461 --> 01:43:53.930
but fortunately I guess I can,

1776
01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:57.170
I can get a bad report card and just want to improve it.
Totally.
Totally.

1777
01:43:57.590 --> 01:44:01.430
So this is that Japanese Yen,
Japan.
Exactly.
Well,

1778
01:44:01.431 --> 01:44:05.270
he saw she put it on there.
That means long time.
No,
see basically,

1779
01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:09.740
which by the way is from Chinese actually.
It's,
um,
how'd y'all put yet?

1780
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:14.140
Which literally means well,
yeah,
it's like long time.
No,
see how'd y'all,

1781
01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:18.830
what's yen?
Uh,
which is the same gin is sites yet and see you again.

1782
01:44:19.250 --> 01:44:21.800
Uh,
all right,
so this is the Japanese Tonkotsu.
Yup.

1783
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:26.450
He's thoughtfully tasting everyone.

1784
01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:34.940
That is amazing.
That,
I love that.
That's very,
it's just very silky.
It's not,

1785
01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:40.070
there aren't any kind of rough aspects to it.
Nope.

1786
01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:44.500
Like I could just sit there for hours.
Me Too.
And they do.
Wow.
It's um,

1787
01:44:44.590 --> 01:44:47.600
I'm going to write that one down.
This is the,
what was it,
17 years?

1788
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:53.000
17 year and Nika and I.
K.
K.
A.
Yup.
Taketsuru.

1789
01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:57.530
Taketsuru T.
A.
K.
E.
T.
S.
U.
R.
You.
Wow,

1790
01:44:57.531 --> 01:45:01.810
that's good stuff.
Yeah.
So it comes back to that idea of balance,
right?
And,

1791
01:45:01.811 --> 01:45:06.290
and use.
So like the first four you tasted or maybe bounced in different ways,

1792
01:45:06.291 --> 01:45:08.870
but I don't think he liked the ry quite as much.

1793
01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:14.080
The riot I could like on the rocks as one drank with some bros before we play

1794
01:45:14.901 --> 01:45:17.870
pool fine.
But I couldn't sit down and nurse that right.

1795
01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:21.590
For like hours of a poker guy.
He's an interesting,
and then similarly you might,

1796
01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:25.160
you might not take the Taketsuru Sudu and make a Manhattan with it.

1797
01:45:25.190 --> 01:45:28.400
Like you would the rye.
Right.
So then you add sweet vermouth.

1798
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:29.420
It calms the write down.

1799
01:45:29.450 --> 01:45:33.680
You stir it over rocks and temperature calms the right down.
Right.
So all these,

1800
01:45:34.010 --> 01:45:37.460
you know,
sick where,
where's the end point for these things?
So I'm with you.

1801
01:45:37.461 --> 01:45:41.990
I'm probably not sipping the h Taylor know very often unless I'm around a

1802
01:45:41.991 --> 01:45:42.950
campfire and it's all there is.

1803
01:45:42.951 --> 01:45:47.450
But the Takotsubo the it is really fascinating.
Hell,

1804
01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:52.250
uh,
whether it's the Irish distilling process,

1805
01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:55.910
the characteristics of the Japanese Scotch,

1806
01:45:55.940 --> 01:46:00.280
they really match the sort of cultural stereotypes.
Yeah.

1807
01:46:00.290 --> 01:46:04.550
Well totally.
Um,
there's a,
there's a really,
I think it's a fascinating book.

1808
01:46:04.580 --> 01:46:09.230
There are gems in it,
even though some of it may be found very boring to people,

1809
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:12.260
uh,
to shrimp up called in praise of shadows.

1810
01:46:12.410 --> 01:46:17.240
And it's a book on sort of architecture and aesthetics written by a Japanese

1811
01:46:17.241 --> 01:46:19.880
fellow whose name is escaping me right now,
I want to say like honeys Aki.

1812
01:46:19.881 --> 01:46:24.850
But I could be making that up and just talks about how,
for instance,

1813
01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:30.820
people in the West will buy objects from Japan that have a gold foil or

1814
01:46:31.851 --> 01:46:35.450
embroidering and put it in their homes.
But it looks gaudy.
Yup.

1815
01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:37.490
And the reason that was,

1816
01:46:37.820 --> 01:46:42.380
or the reason that's the case is that Japan and Japanese aesthetic makes use of

1817
01:46:42.381 --> 01:46:44.870
shadow and darkness more.
So they,

1818
01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:49.860
they compensated for that darkness by having a more ornamentation with things

1819
01:46:49.861 --> 01:46:54.000
like gold smart cause you'd be seeing it in low light settings and just the

1820
01:46:54.001 --> 01:46:56.880
whole,
the whole book is really interesting.
Talks about,
you know,
the,
the,
uh,

1821
01:46:57.290 --> 01:47:01.140
he has very strong opinions about Gad Japanese versus Western toilets and

1822
01:47:01.141 --> 01:47:05.740
whatnot.
It's just,
it's,
but that type of sensibility,
uh,

1823
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:08.940
you can detect even in the absence of the Scotch,
which is cool.

1824
01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:12.930
It applies to wine too.
Same,
same parable,
Huh?
Yeah.
Uh,

1825
01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:16.560
and then this and now we have the mainland mainland Edward,

1826
01:47:16.561 --> 01:47:18.660
our 10 year old scotch.
All right.

1827
01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:24.780
Now I'll,
while I taste all that you answer this,
I think that a lot of people,

1828
01:47:24.781 --> 01:47:25.680
myself included,

1829
01:47:25.681 --> 01:47:30.660
tend to assume or have a bias towards older age.
Like,

1830
01:47:30.661 --> 01:47:33.960
oh,
it must be better if it's older.
It's the same once the,

1831
01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:38.550
it's the same rule with wine.
More expensive isn't better,
older as in better.
Um,

1832
01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:42.390
and in some cases you can actually go really too far.
I mean,

1833
01:47:42.391 --> 01:47:45.150
I feel like for you that the,
the,
the Rye,

1834
01:47:45.151 --> 01:47:50.151
which is 10 years old is probably beyond the pleasure principle for Tim and

1835
01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:52.920
things age at different rates depending on where they are.

1836
01:47:52.921 --> 01:47:55.680
So it's cold and wet in Scotland.

1837
01:47:55.950 --> 01:47:58.590
Proof can actually tend to come down in the aging.

1838
01:47:58.591 --> 01:48:02.410
You can lose some alcohol through evaporation and um,

1839
01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:07.560
whereas you lose less water because it's so humid,
but it takes,

1840
01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:08.880
because it's cooler and wetter,

1841
01:48:08.881 --> 01:48:12.660
it takes more time to develop the Patina that happens with age.

1842
01:48:13.170 --> 01:48:15.030
Whereas if you're in a,
uh,
Rick House,

1843
01:48:15.031 --> 01:48:19.560
which is just an aging warehouse in Kentucky,
like even today and to summer,

1844
01:48:19.561 --> 01:48:21.300
it's hot,
it's really hot.

1845
01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:26.430
So that whole thing proceeds at a much greater pace,
much faster.

1846
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:27.300
And you can,

1847
01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:30.910
you can blow right by the sweet spot and get to something that just becomes a,

1848
01:48:31.110 --> 01:48:36.060
a varnish sheet Turpin tiny extract of Oak and you've lost all the other

1849
01:48:36.061 --> 01:48:40.140
character in nuance,
which makes perfect sense,
right?
I mean,

1850
01:48:40.141 --> 01:48:42.450
because if you have that added heat,

1851
01:48:42.451 --> 01:48:45.960
all the metabolic processes are accelerating.
What was the name of this again?

1852
01:48:45.961 --> 01:48:50.961
I'm so bad at spelling anything from Scotland because there are lots of o u g h

1853
01:48:51.271 --> 01:48:54.380
is and so on that I actually can't make sense of.
But what was the name of that?

1854
01:48:54.410 --> 01:48:59.160
This is Edward Hour.
So e d r a d.
O.
U.

1855
01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:03.570
R tenure.
I think it'll actually Scotland's smallest distillery.

1856
01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:07.890
I like this a lot.
It's my favorite in Scotland.
Oh,
no kidding.
Yep.
This is done.

1857
01:49:07.891 --> 01:49:11.190
The mainland.
Yeah.
Really,
really nice.
And I don't,

1858
01:49:12.930 --> 01:49:16.830
words are failing me.
Uh,
which suppose happens a fair amount,

1859
01:49:16.831 --> 01:49:20.740
but particularly in this case,
how would you describe this to me?
It's,

1860
01:49:21.150 --> 01:49:25.620
it's pretty and rich,
which is kind of a,
again,

1861
01:49:25.621 --> 01:49:29.150
back to balance.
It's a hard balancing point.
It's easy to get rich.
Well,

1862
01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:32.940
I feel like it.
How do you stay pretty well,
I also feel like it's strong.

1863
01:49:32.970 --> 01:49:35.130
Like it has,
uh,

1864
01:49:36.690 --> 01:49:39.060
and look guys,
for those people listening,

1865
01:49:39.061 --> 01:49:44.061
like I get really irritated by sort of the snobbery that can come with a lot of

1866
01:49:47.561 --> 01:49:51.190
this,
but I'm lacking better words to use.
But if so,
yeah,
there's,

1867
01:49:51.191 --> 01:49:55.060
there's a lot of ridiculous stuff out there when it comes to beverages at the

1868
01:49:55.061 --> 01:49:56.800
high end and so on.
However,
with this,

1869
01:49:56.801 --> 01:50:00.460
like the way I would describe this is it's a lot stronger,

1870
01:50:00.461 --> 01:50:02.980
not necessarily an alcohol content,
but the,

1871
01:50:03.370 --> 01:50:06.380
the characteristics and the flavors are a lot stronger than Japanese.
Exactly.

1872
01:50:06.510 --> 01:50:11.500
But just short of like really headbutting me in the face,

1873
01:50:11.501 --> 01:50:13.590
like the,
uh,
the Rye,
the Rye.
Yeah.

1874
01:50:13.930 --> 01:50:17.230
And so this I could do for a longer period of time total.
You know,

1875
01:50:17.231 --> 01:50:20.620
it's kind of like 75 is perfect.

1876
01:50:21.610 --> 01:50:23.410
85 if you're in the sun can be too much.

1877
01:50:23.411 --> 01:50:27.370
And this is like a hanging out right below that threshold.
Yup.
I totally agree.

1878
01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:31.090
It feels like more,
I mean,
when I take this,
I actually tastes raising nets.
Oh,

1879
01:50:31.091 --> 01:50:34.150
interesting.
It's such a trip.
I mean,
I get the malted milkshake thing,

1880
01:50:34.151 --> 01:50:39.151
but also like that the chocolate over the reason and it's rich and it's yummy

1881
01:50:39.341 --> 01:50:43.690
and it,
where's the alcohol?
Well,
hmm.
Yeah,
I do get it.
Yeah.
I mean,

1882
01:50:43.691 --> 01:50:48.100
power of suggestion being what it is.
Yeah.
Um,

1883
01:50:50.050 --> 01:50:53.560
what about,
uh,
let's,
so this is the,
the islander,
exactly.

1884
01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:58.420
This is full gas on a lot of friends.
Big.
It's rich.

1885
01:50:59.080 --> 01:50:59.913
It's a,

1886
01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:04.390
the most alcoholic on the table as 54.2% alcohol.

1887
01:51:04.391 --> 01:51:07.720
So that's a 108.4 proof.

1888
01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:13.840
<v 5>Not for the meek.
From Ardbeg who?
Goodall.</v>

1889
01:51:19.610 --> 01:51:24.290
<v 0>Yeah.
I'll put her on your chest.
Trouble with that.
I was trying to do the,</v>

1890
01:51:25.050 --> 01:51:28.310
the,
what is it,
the aeration and swishing and whatnot.
I was like,
oh my God,

1891
01:51:28.311 --> 01:51:29.600
I could barely get the first part down.

1892
01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:34.580
Fuck it is put a little bit in your mouth and it just fills your whole cranium

1893
01:51:34.581 --> 01:51:39.170
head crazy perfume.
Yeah.
It's um,
very perfumed.

1894
01:51:39.730 --> 01:51:44.410
I'm very smoky.
Yeah.
Just like before,
I love sipping on these,

1895
01:51:44.411 --> 01:51:48.400
but just in small amounts a drink,
it's like it's a sip.
Yeah.

1896
01:51:48.430 --> 01:51:52.480
That would have to be like sitting reading a book someplace at your own speed

1897
01:51:52.540 --> 01:51:55.600
someplace cold,
cold,
snowing outside.

1898
01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:58.990
Sounds like an island in Ireland maybe.
Yeah,
exactly.

1899
01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:02.260
To Scotland are Scotland.
I'm so sorry.

1900
01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:07.830
I'm supposed to know punching them that your phones as we see.
Uh,

1901
01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:13.030
so the,
now let's,
let's talk about one other thing and then we can introduce it.

1902
01:52:13.031 --> 01:52:16.410
Maybe is,
is a,
a story.
So tell me this,

1903
01:52:16.930 --> 01:52:21.930
the story you told me about the convoy and let's use that as a segue to mezcal.

1904
01:52:22.150 --> 01:52:27.040
Yes,
let's do.
Um,
so I was telling you a story about a,

1905
01:52:27.041 --> 01:52:29.800
I have a mezcal Brian,
it's called Sombra.
Um,

1906
01:52:29.970 --> 01:52:34.750
I started 10 years ago actually when everybody thought I was selling Mescalin

1907
01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:38.560
rich,
you're going to go to jail.
I was like,

1908
01:52:38.770 --> 01:52:41.890
what do you mean I'm gonna go to jail?
I think,
well,
Mescalin is illegal.

1909
01:52:41.891 --> 01:52:45.830
It's a drug.
I was like,
no,
no,
no,
no.
It's not masculine.
It's Mescal,
you know,

1910
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:47.880
<v 2>without going through the long strokes.
Um,</v>

1911
01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:50.990
10 years has taken us a long ways and we've gone from a time when everybody

1912
01:52:50.991 --> 01:52:54.260
thought that sits actually,
you know,
on everybody's lips.
Um,

1913
01:52:54.261 --> 01:52:57.680
so miss gal is really the authentic,
a Gob,
a spirit of Mexico.

1914
01:52:57.740 --> 01:52:58.800
Everyone talks about Tequila.

1915
01:52:59.190 --> 01:53:03.860
Tequila is really changed and in a lot of ways it's been bastardized over the

1916
01:53:03.861 --> 01:53:08.690
last,
well since 1860 when it became tequila.
Before that it too was misco.

1917
01:53:09.170 --> 01:53:12.320
So for me,
the idea is how you were ways,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1918
01:53:12.321 --> 01:53:13.700
And in what ways does it become bastardized?

1919
01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:18.650
So at a certain point you could have used dozens of different types of a Gavi to

1920
01:53:18.651 --> 01:53:23.060
make and you can still mescal and Tequila was one of those things.
Um,

1921
01:53:23.090 --> 01:53:28.010
and when it went from being Vayner Dmexco to being Tequila,

1922
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:31.130
they legislated for industry,
not for artistry.

1923
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:36.060
So no longer could you use these,
you know,
20 some flavors and,
and Gaba is blue,

1924
01:53:36.070 --> 01:53:38.900
Gavi or just blue.
And they'd say,
because the best,
well,

1925
01:53:38.901 --> 01:53:41.960
it's not necessarily the best.
It's the best if you want something to grow big,

1926
01:53:42.140 --> 01:53:47.090
fast,
soft.
So it's easy to cut.
And now they carry this monoculture of,

1927
01:53:47.091 --> 01:53:50.750
I mean,
it's like in Cheetahs there's no DNA variability.

1928
01:53:50.751 --> 01:53:52.700
And so the first sibling cheetahs,
yeah.

1929
01:53:52.701 --> 01:53:55.910
You know how they're about to be extinct because there's,
there's low no.
Oh yeah.

1930
01:53:55.911 --> 01:53:59.960
Their,
their gene pool is so tiny that if like they,
everyone's afraid.

1931
01:53:59.961 --> 01:54:03.560
If one of them catches the flu,
they're all going to die.
No variability.

1932
01:54:03.561 --> 01:54:07.790
None whatsoever.
So the same thing's happened in Tequila with Bluecava and that.

1933
01:54:07.791 --> 01:54:11.120
So that's why they have these blights that take out all these plants as a

1934
01:54:11.121 --> 01:54:15.380
production.
Yeah.
It's a huge time.
Yeah.
Alright.
And so in addition to the plant,

1935
01:54:15.381 --> 01:54:18.080
it was the processing methods have changed and you,

1936
01:54:18.110 --> 01:54:22.400
you are so far from what was originally produced and Tequila,
um,

1937
01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:26.140
to get to what they're making today that hey,
I still drink this stuff,
but um,

1938
01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:28.670
but it's not,
if you drink tequila,
what do you drink?

1939
01:54:28.910 --> 01:54:32.000
It's kind of like the DOS Equis guy.
I don't drink it took you a long time,

1940
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:33.590
but when I do,
I drink,

1941
01:54:33.770 --> 01:54:37.600
I drink a lot of [inaudible] leg was I think the physical yet they was okay.

1942
01:54:37.670 --> 01:54:42.610
They do a great job I think to get this seven linguals Lagos,
Lagos?
Yup.

1943
01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:47.600
L E.
G.
U.
S.
Um,
I like the guys that's Keela Oto.
Actually,

1944
01:54:47.601 --> 01:54:50.770
I don't know the guys to get hit.
We'll try like their tequila a lot.
Um,

1945
01:54:50.900 --> 01:54:54.260
and then we make one called us thrall,
like astral.
Yeah.

1946
01:54:54.530 --> 01:54:59.030
Which is really a deliberate throwback to what was it like before 1860 when they

1947
01:54:59.090 --> 01:55:03.580
legislated for,
got it.
Basically if I could production.
Um,

1948
01:55:04.010 --> 01:55:08.390
so for me,
mescal is,
it's the,
it's the real thing.
You know,

1949
01:55:08.391 --> 01:55:11.060
what it embodies that intellectual value we've been talking about and it

1950
01:55:11.061 --> 01:55:11.860
embodies plot,

1951
01:55:11.860 --> 01:55:16.070
a process in place and people on geology and the geography and history and

1952
01:55:16.071 --> 01:55:18.770
cuisine.
It's all in there.
So that's,
that's interesting to me.

1953
01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:20.660
And so we've been down there doing this stuff,

1954
01:55:20.661 --> 01:55:24.410
but it's definitely what is miss golf with.
So for people who haven't had it,

1955
01:55:24.770 --> 01:55:27.110
so think of it as Tequila from the rest of Mexico,

1956
01:55:27.530 --> 01:55:31.940
but for sure it's going to be more full flavored.
So much like this last Scott,

1957
01:55:31.941 --> 01:55:36.110
you had that,
um,
where they use peat in the process that gives it that sense.

1958
01:55:36.111 --> 01:55:39.080
Key quality.
Yeah.
It has the very smoky in characteristic.

1959
01:55:39.110 --> 01:55:44.070
So if we just take a step back and you think,
okay,
well what is,
if

1960
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:45.780
<v 5>mezcal is made from Gavi,
what's it Gavi?</v>

1961
01:55:45.810 --> 01:55:50.250
Gavi has starch and you need yeast to eat sugar,

1962
01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:54.100
to make alcohol use.
Don't eat starch.
So you may,
well,

1963
01:55:54.101 --> 01:55:58.830
you turn starch into a sugar is with heat and today,
um,

1964
01:55:58.860 --> 01:56:03.600
it's done with steam or even with enzymes and some strange cases,
um,

1965
01:56:04.050 --> 01:56:06.750
cases I try to avoid personally,
but,
um,

1966
01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:11.310
traditionally it's done with fire.
And so in my scalp production,

1967
01:56:11.311 --> 01:56:14.100
you actually dig a hole in the ground.
You build a fire,

1968
01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:15.750
you put rocks over that fire,

1969
01:56:15.751 --> 01:56:18.960
and then you put the Gavi hearts in there and you roast them for two days,

1970
01:56:19.230 --> 01:56:22.860
buried in the ground in that that heat converts the starch to sugar.

1971
01:56:22.861 --> 01:56:26.880
It also much like this last scotch,
it imbues it with a smoky flavor.

1972
01:56:26.940 --> 01:56:30.750
And so that's why miss call has that smokey equality.
And so think of it like,

1973
01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:32.040
you know,
the original Tequila,

1974
01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:36.540
a smoke and a that's based in Mexico,

1975
01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:38.390
that's based in Wahaca,
Wahaca,
Mexico.

1976
01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:42.150
So almost the very most of them is for a molar,
also famous from Olin,
great food,

1977
01:56:42.190 --> 01:56:47.120
amazing people,
amazing traditions.
Um,
and little unpredictable or,

1978
01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:51.180
yeah,
it's definitely unpredictable.
Um,
you can,
you know,

1979
01:56:51.181 --> 01:56:54.300
there's so much beauty and so many wonderful things and you definitely have to

1980
01:56:54.301 --> 01:56:57.300
watch your step.
So what,
what happened with the convoy?
So what happened?

1981
01:56:57.301 --> 01:57:02.070
The coffee where there was some,
some friends and business associates.
And um,

1982
01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:06.200
after being out at our Polanque K or two cars pulled back on,
you know,

1983
01:57:06.270 --> 01:57:10.890
says 17 pulling keys where you distill and after driving from the distillery and

1984
01:57:10.891 --> 01:57:15.060
the mountains,
17 kilometers down a dirt road back to the main highway,

1985
01:57:15.061 --> 01:57:16.100
which is the Pan American,

1986
01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:21.120
we turned onto the Pan American highway and two trucks of state police soldiers

1987
01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:24.060
pulled in front of our two cars and start slowing down.

1988
01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:28.980
And the guy was driving the car in front of us,
didn't understand the clues,

1989
01:57:28.981 --> 01:57:33.120
which is we were also supposed to slow down and stop.
[inaudible]
yeah,
he was,

1990
01:57:33.150 --> 01:57:37.800
yeah.
Lot.
We'll Hawkin.
Yeah.
Yup.
He's the son of the guy that was driving our car.

1991
01:57:37.890 --> 01:57:41.820
Got It.
Um,
and just didn't want to know the clues didn't pick up on the hint,

1992
01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:43.740
which was a little scary cause you know,
and you know,

1993
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:48.180
in a half a breath you had two trucks of soldiers with their rifles pointed at

1994
01:57:48.181 --> 01:57:52.740
the car.
And My,
my,
uh,
the guy that works for us down there,
he's an amazing guy.

1995
01:57:52.741 --> 01:57:55.450
He's been there forever.
He knows the clothes and he's like,
grabbing the kid,

1996
01:57:55.451 --> 01:57:58.410
stop the car,
stop the car.
And I would imagine,

1997
01:57:58.411 --> 01:58:03.210
I mean the averting faster and they're stopping the car.
I would imagine,
I mean,

1998
01:58:03.211 --> 01:58:04.440
I've had this experience in Panama,

1999
01:58:04.441 --> 01:58:09.120
I've had at many other places to extract potentially extract like a more like a

2000
01:58:09.121 --> 01:58:13.650
little,
have a nice day.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Have a nice day.

2001
01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:14.960
Yeah.
You know,
I,

2002
01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:18.840
I don't think I've actually been on that road without having been stopped and

2003
01:58:18.841 --> 01:58:22.770
had the car empty that at one point or another.
Um,
you know,

2004
01:58:22.771 --> 01:58:26.310
I'm told from our local friends that it's always better when we're in the car.

2005
01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:31.830
You know,
I wouldn't obviously know the converse situation.
Um,
but you know,

2006
01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:33.900
all in all,
everybody is okay and that's all that matters.

2007
01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:35.360
I had a scary experience and uh,

2008
01:58:36.210 --> 01:58:40.260
well scary because I'm not accustomed to this happening elsewhere in the United

2009
01:58:40.260 --> 01:58:42.040
States.
Been Panama where I was driving out

2010
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:43.750
<v 0>from Panama City to,</v>

2011
01:58:43.751 --> 01:58:48.340
I want to say book it there or I was actually driving to an,

2012
01:58:49.450 --> 01:58:53.950
to the coast to go to the [inaudible] marine reserve,
which is amazing.

2013
01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:55.210
And uh,

2014
01:58:55.210 --> 01:59:00.210
I got stopped a million times because he's just like obvious white dude in a

2015
01:59:00.881 --> 01:59:03.630
pickup truck driving.
And uh,

2016
01:59:03.730 --> 01:59:06.440
the tip I got before arriving in Panama,

2017
01:59:06.441 --> 01:59:10.330
I was getting an international drivers license because when they pull you over,

2018
01:59:10.331 --> 01:59:13.150
they're going to ask you for your passport and if you handed over,

2019
01:59:13.180 --> 01:59:13.901
you don't get it back.

2020
01:59:13.901 --> 01:59:17.170
Now you won't get it back until you do everything that they ask you to do.
Yup.

2021
01:59:17.410 --> 01:59:19.990
But if you have an international drivers license and you say you don't have a

2022
01:59:19.991 --> 01:59:21.250
passport,
and then they say,

2023
01:59:21.251 --> 01:59:24.850
well we were supposed to find you but then you have to go to trial and this

2024
01:59:24.851 --> 01:59:27.790
place and the other and then they protocol the dance is,

2025
01:59:28.030 --> 01:59:30.340
is there any way I could pay my fine now,

2026
01:59:31.690 --> 01:59:35.470
but the price is going to be 10 20 a hundred acts if they've your passport as

2027
01:59:35.471 --> 01:59:37.130
opposed to the international driver's license.
Yup.

2028
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:40.240
Same thing happens in France all the time in France.
Oh,

2029
01:59:40.300 --> 01:59:42.970
the joke used to be with myself and my friends and we were doing a lot of wine

2030
01:59:42.971 --> 01:59:45.660
work.
There is that,
you know,
don't let Richard drive right off the plane.

2031
01:59:45.661 --> 01:59:48.820
I said at some point,
first day getting pulled over.
Same Story.

2032
01:59:48.821 --> 01:59:51.670
Give me your passport.
Of course.
I'm never giving them my passport.

2033
01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:56.520
You can have my driver's license.
Plenty of those.
But um,
same,
same story.
Oh yeah.

2034
01:59:56.740 --> 02:00:01.390
Pay This fine.
Right on the side of the road.
It's so wild.

2035
02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:06.160
Yeah.
It happens more places than not,
I would say for sure.
Brazil's the scariest,

2036
02:00:06.161 --> 02:00:10.600
but that's another podcast.
Yeah.
Uh,
you can see what is it?
Throughput the Elitch,

2037
02:00:10.630 --> 02:00:14.920
the,
uh,
elite squad or elite team.
There's a movie.

2038
02:00:14.921 --> 02:00:16.690
You could watch that and then you'll know what I'm talking about.

2039
02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:20.830
Now the second one is pretty good as well.
Uh,
so the,
uh,
let me,

2040
02:00:20.831 --> 02:00:25.831
let me ask you a couple of rapid fire questions as I nursed this Tonkotsu to do

2041
02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:31.150
it.
Uh,
when you think of the word successful,

2042
02:00:31.151 --> 02:00:34.810
who's the first person who comes to mind and why?
My folks,

2043
02:00:35.020 --> 02:00:39.910
both of them equally,
my parents,
why they were able to come from a place that's,

2044
02:00:40.780 --> 02:00:43.720
I mean I,
I consider myself successful,
but when I look at what they did,

2045
02:00:43.750 --> 02:00:47.770
I think of their road is having been so much harder,
so much harder.

2046
02:00:47.771 --> 02:00:52.600
I'm super impressed.
So his,
his success then in the overcoming of obstacles,

2047
02:00:53.290 --> 02:00:55.830
it's finding your way to happiness and that's what it is.
And,

2048
02:00:55.831 --> 02:00:59.110
and that doesn't have to be associated with anything material or not.

2049
02:00:59.111 --> 02:01:01.960
And for them it was just changing the surroundings and finding a way out.

2050
02:01:02.490 --> 02:01:04.000
You know,
there was no helping hand.

2051
02:01:04.030 --> 02:01:06.700
You gotta you gotta do it yourself when do you,

2052
02:01:06.701 --> 02:01:08.410
so if you had to pick someone besides your parents,

2053
02:01:10.490 --> 02:01:14.080
someone beside my parents.
Oh,
I,
you and I share lots of friends,

2054
02:01:14.081 --> 02:01:19.060
many of whom are successful and it's really anyone that makes their own way.
Um,

2055
02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:22.690
so our buddy,
I mean,
yeah.
Soka he's been on the podcast,

2056
02:01:22.691 --> 02:01:26.850
extremely safe to say he's cut his own way.
He's cut his own way.
Um,
I mean,

2057
02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.900
Obama's cut his own way,
you know,
so many people.

2058
02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:31.430
Just to be clear to folks that is not a mutual friend or at least,
yeah,

2059
02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:33.790
I don't know him on a first name basis,
but you know what I mean.

2060
02:01:33.791 --> 02:01:37.030
It's someone that maybe against odds has,

2061
02:01:37.031 --> 02:01:40.280
has figured out how to do what they love do and

2062
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:44.030
<v 5>that's pretty cool.
When do you lose track of time?</v>

2063
02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:50.600
I lose track of time on airplanes or I spend a lot of time and I actually,
Tim,

2064
02:01:50.601 --> 02:01:52.570
I really tried to take that time for myself.
I,

2065
02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:55.580
I like getting on the airplane and there are times like this morning when,

2066
02:01:55.610 --> 02:01:58.490
when I flew here I was like,
you know what?
I'm going to fly backs.
Afternoon,

2067
02:01:58.700 --> 02:02:02.030
I have to work.
But 99% of the time when I got in the plane,

2068
02:02:02.031 --> 02:02:06.200
that's Richard Time and I shut it off and I get in a book and what used to be

2069
02:02:06.201 --> 02:02:09.830
long flights are over in a minute and we're even just think or anything.

2070
02:02:09.831 --> 02:02:11.960
But that's,
that's where I actually lose track of time.

2071
02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:16.010
How many days a year do you fly?
I am,

2072
02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:20.990
I sleep in a hotel more than 300 nights a year.
Wow.
Yeah,

2073
02:02:21.220 --> 02:02:24.230
I'll,
I'll do 117 hundred and 80,000 miles is here.

2074
02:02:24.260 --> 02:02:29.180
What book are you currently reading?
Um,
it's the,
um,
El,

2075
02:02:29.181 --> 02:02:33.650
please don't be mad when I slightly title wrong.
Mus the intersection option.

2076
02:02:33.670 --> 02:02:36.860
Yeah.
I haven't read over there in the corner.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Elle Luna.

2077
02:02:36.861 --> 02:02:38.320
Check it out guys.
I actually buy,

2078
02:02:38.330 --> 02:02:43.330
actually bought 2000 plus copies of that to mail out with this quarter quarterly

2079
02:02:43.431 --> 02:02:46.190
mailing that I sent out to people.
That's amazing.
That's a really,

2080
02:02:46.220 --> 02:02:49.010
really excellent book.
What book will,
so speaking of gifting,

2081
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:53.900
what book do you gift have you gifted most often to other people?
For sure.

2082
02:02:53.901 --> 02:02:57.620
It's my favorite book ever.
It's called a fan's notes,
a fan's notes,

2083
02:02:57.621 --> 02:03:01.470
a fan's notes by Fred Exley.
What does that,
um,
I don't know.

2084
02:03:01.471 --> 02:03:04.190
It was probably 50 years on since it was written.

2085
02:03:04.670 --> 02:03:09.120
And Fred's amazing,
super smart for,

2086
02:03:10.220 --> 02:03:13.190
for me,
there's,
this is like first,
second and third place in terms of best book.

2087
02:03:13.250 --> 02:03:14.750
Oh Wow.
That's a strong,

2088
02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:19.880
it's a brilliant guy who keeps messing up his life over and over again.

2089
02:03:20.391 --> 02:03:23.230
Is this autobiographical?
He says patient.

2090
02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:26.170
He says that certain events may resemble his own life.
Okay.

2091
02:03:26.570 --> 02:03:30.560
That's considered a novel.
Yes,
it is.
Got It.
Okay.
Yeah.
And it's,
um,

2092
02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:34.250
it's painful and I'm,
I'm not,
I don't see sad movies.

2093
02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:39.230
I don't read overtly sad things.
Um,
but this is,

2094
02:03:39.670 --> 02:03:43.190
it's neither of those things,
but man,
it's such a lesson.
It's really,

2095
02:03:43.191 --> 02:03:46.990
really special.
What,
what are,
and it's funny and it's literary and it's,

2096
02:03:46.991 --> 02:03:51.350
it's nuts.
What is one of the,
what do you get from it when you,
when you read it?

2097
02:03:51.351 --> 02:03:55.010
So I take it you've read it more than once.
I'm probably on it.

2098
02:03:55.150 --> 02:03:57.440
It's actually about a third through again,

2099
02:03:57.441 --> 02:04:01.130
it's next to next to my bed and I'm probably on my 12th or 13th reading.

2100
02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:05.810
What do you get from it?
Resolve.
Resolve.
Resolve.
Oh,

2101
02:04:05.811 --> 02:04:09.260
that's good.
Yeah,
it's huge.
That's the everything.
I mean,

2102
02:04:09.261 --> 02:04:14.090
I'd be a liar if I didn't say I'm not totally motivated by many factors,

2103
02:04:14.091 --> 02:04:17.640
including a fear of failure.
It's,
I,

2104
02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:22.130
I would like to say that that's not true,
but I'm supremely motivated by it.

2105
02:04:22.190 --> 02:04:25.670
What is failure in your mind?
And it could be something very specific.

2106
02:04:25.671 --> 02:04:27.830
I mean like whether it's related to business or whatever,

2107
02:04:27.831 --> 02:04:30.020
but like in your mind right now,
what is the fear?

2108
02:04:30.050 --> 02:04:33.470
What is the failure that you're afraid of not achieving the things I want to

2109
02:04:33.471 --> 02:04:38.040
achieve?
Like,
well,
continuing to work for myself,
which is great.
That's huge.

2110
02:04:38.041 --> 02:04:39.900
I mean time is everything.
I mean there's,

2111
02:04:39.901 --> 02:04:44.901
there's nothing in my mind besides time and having your opportunity to decide

2112
02:04:45.391 --> 02:04:46.224
how to spend it.

2113
02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:49.020
That's because it's going to be over and only what you want to believe.

2114
02:04:49.020 --> 02:04:51.390
I believe that we get one swing and that's it.

2115
02:04:51.450 --> 02:04:56.130
I want to make it great and not having the occasion to decide what I do not have

2116
02:04:56.131 --> 02:04:58.860
any occasion to express myself in whatever way.

2117
02:04:58.861 --> 02:05:02.760
I feel like that's failure.
Yeah.

2118
02:05:02.790 --> 02:05:07.080
It's a horrifying thought.
Like I'd be physically ill thinking about it.
If you,

2119
02:05:07.081 --> 02:05:09.750
I think you're a spectacularly good teacher.
Uh,

2120
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:14.220
if you were teaching a ninth grade class,

2121
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:19.080
you could teach anything you wanted.
Yep.
What would the class be?
Love Yourself.

2122
02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:22.710
Love Yourself.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You've got to love yourself before you love others.

2123
02:05:22.711 --> 02:05:23.544
And without it,

2124
02:05:23.700 --> 02:05:27.390
nothing productive is going to happen when we can all bang our heads on the
wall.

2125
02:05:27.391 --> 02:05:30.990
But unless you really,
really come from place of like,
this is who I am,

2126
02:05:30.991 --> 02:05:32.910
this is what I,
I have,

2127
02:05:32.911 --> 02:05:37.440
which is like a mind trapped in a physical being trapped in a,
in a meat cube.

2128
02:05:37.500 --> 02:05:38.820
Yeah.
Trapped in a meat cube.

2129
02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:42.630
Like you have to like acknowledge that and then make the most of it.

2130
02:05:42.990 --> 02:05:45.600
I mean really appreciate yourself.
And especially in ninth grade,
that was like,

2131
02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:48.240
I mean my daughter actually just entered 10th grade,

2132
02:05:48.241 --> 02:05:50.220
but that's like such a tough time on kids.

2133
02:05:50.221 --> 02:05:54.820
I remember I won a tough time I had in you,
it's very easy to lose your bearings.

2134
02:05:54.821 --> 02:05:57.750
Like are they doing it right?
Are they doing it right?
Am I doing it wrong?

2135
02:05:57.751 --> 02:06:00.360
Like all that,
just like,
you know,
love yourself.

2136
02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:03.980
I always thought I was going to be a night like a teacher and specifically want

2137
02:06:04.050 --> 02:06:08.010
teach ninth grade because that's,
that's the uh,

2138
02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:11.320
so the fork and so many paths,
you know what I mean?
Total.
What,

2139
02:06:11.350 --> 02:06:15.750
so how would you help someone cultivate loving themselves?

2140
02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:17.790
It's,
I'll be honest,
I have trouble with that.

2141
02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.880
I beat the shit out of myself all the time.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2142
02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:24.720
I think I'm helping some cultivate that.
I think,

2143
02:06:26.220 --> 02:06:28.820
well,
it's probably what I'm starting to feel,
but it's stuck it sooner.
Yeah,

2144
02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:33.630
it's good.
I would say it probably comes with context again.
You know,
I mean,

2145
02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:36.960
we're always like,
grass is always greener.
Well why don't you taste that grass,

2146
02:06:37.020 --> 02:06:40.290
right?
And see what it is and see what it actually feels like.
Try It on,

2147
02:06:40.350 --> 02:06:44.910
tasted it,
put your toes in it.
And if you,
if there's a way to,

2148
02:06:45.180 --> 02:06:49.350
again,
give people context of other things.
We've done it with our daughter by,

2149
02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:51.420
with travel.
Um,
you know,

2150
02:06:51.421 --> 02:06:55.470
we just got back from the Galapagos islands two weeks ago by far the best place

2151
02:06:55.471 --> 02:06:58.350
I've ever been in the Galapagos themselves are really amazing.

2152
02:06:58.351 --> 02:07:01.890
And then you spent some time in why Akil and that's a real story of have and

2153
02:07:01.891 --> 02:07:06.020
have nots.
And it's an amazing thing.
But know,
just as one example of,
you know,

2154
02:07:06.030 --> 02:07:10.140
what is it like to,
to live these other lives and everybody struggles,

2155
02:07:10.141 --> 02:07:14.280
but the happiest people are,
that's the real wealth is being happy.

2156
02:07:14.281 --> 02:07:17.730
And if you can show people,

2157
02:07:18.060 --> 02:07:21.150
give examples of people that are happy,
you know,

2158
02:07:21.151 --> 02:07:24.180
regardless of their material circumstances,
I think that's,

2159
02:07:24.210 --> 02:07:28.770
that's a way to share with kids that it's worth loving yourself and making the

2160
02:07:28.771 --> 02:07:32.200
most of it.
You know,
when you look at,
uh,

2161
02:07:32.880 --> 02:07:36.040
your financially successful friends,
both of us know a

2162
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:39.190
<v 0>lot of people that have achieved extraordinary levels of financial success.</v>

2163
02:07:39.820 --> 02:07:40.421
And we'll,

2164
02:07:40.421 --> 02:07:43.000
we'll exclude Chris from this conversation because I don't want anyone to think

2165
02:07:43.001 --> 02:07:46.690
that we're referring to him.
I think Chris is a,
uh,
a case study.

2166
02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:48.430
I'm very fascinated by him because he's,

2167
02:07:48.431 --> 02:07:50.830
he's crafted an incredible life for himself.
Absolutely.

2168
02:07:50.990 --> 02:07:54.280
But of those financially successful people who are

2169
02:07:55.870 --> 02:08:00.190
unhappy,
Yup.
Generally unhappy.
Yup.
What do you think they have in common?

2170
02:08:00.410 --> 02:08:04.840
What did the,
what are the,
why are they unhappy?
Misplace goals.

2171
02:08:05.230 --> 02:08:06.190
Misplace goals.

2172
02:08:06.300 --> 02:08:08.520
<v 3>Yeah.
And you know,
chasing,</v>

2173
02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:14.580
<v 5>chasing the financial award purely for the financial award is not the right way</v>

2174
02:08:14.581 --> 02:08:18.540
to do it in my esteem.
You know,
that first chef that gave me that first wine job,

2175
02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:20.340
he was great.
We were,

2176
02:08:20.341 --> 02:08:23.100
we were overlooked for a couple things in the press and I'm,
you know,

2177
02:08:23.101 --> 02:08:26.370
I'm new in this,
this world food wine world and he's like,
look,
Richard,

2178
02:08:26.371 --> 02:08:29.610
do you know,
if you work for the awards,
you know,
you don't,

2179
02:08:29.611 --> 02:08:33.060
you don't do good work,
but if you do good work,
the awards will come.

2180
02:08:33.390 --> 02:08:35.490
And they might not even be the specific press things.

2181
02:08:35.491 --> 02:08:40.491
But I think that that people that do have that fantastic wealth and are unhappy,

2182
02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:42.113
um,

2183
02:08:42.660 --> 02:08:43.050
<v 3>okay.</v>

2184
02:08:43.050 --> 02:08:47.290
<v 5>You know,
they,
maybe they worked for the wrong thing.
Maybe,
you know,</v>

2185
02:08:47.300 --> 02:08:50.000
barring things like traumatic loss of a loved one or something like that.

2186
02:08:50.001 --> 02:08:50.960
You know,
all that aside,

2187
02:08:53.230 --> 02:08:55.510
<v 0>maybe they don't love themselves.
Maybe they don't know how to share.</v>

2188
02:08:55.680 --> 02:08:57.550
Sharing is a big deal.
Like,
you know,

2189
02:08:57.790 --> 02:09:00.700
or maybe you just maybe just believing the wrong thing,
you know,

2190
02:09:00.730 --> 02:09:03.790
asking for help is a big deal too.
Yeah,
it is a big deal.
It's a huge deal.

2191
02:09:03.820 --> 02:09:04.391
There's a,

2192
02:09:04.391 --> 02:09:08.950
there's a book by Amanda Palmer has also been on the podcast partially because I

2193
02:09:08.951 --> 02:09:12.310
read her book,
the art of asking,
yeah.
Incredible musician,

2194
02:09:12.311 --> 02:09:16.740
but just fucking ask for help already.
You know what you want.
I,

2195
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:18.430
because I grew up as such a bookworm,

2196
02:09:18.431 --> 02:09:23.410
I constantly try to revert to like pro and con lists and writing and research to

2197
02:09:23.411 --> 02:09:26.530
solve problems and like nine times out of 10,
especially after I read that book,

2198
02:09:26.531 --> 02:09:28.510
I was like,
Jesus Christ Ferris.

2199
02:09:28.511 --> 02:09:32.920
Like you could've just called this friend for that.
Yeah.
This friend for that.

2200
02:09:32.980 --> 02:09:34.390
And they would have been happy to help.
Yeah,

2201
02:09:34.490 --> 02:09:38.750
<v 5>totally.
Another thing I think is a little bit out of left field,</v>

2202
02:09:38.751 --> 02:09:40.220
but I think that some of those people,

2203
02:09:40.340 --> 02:09:44.790
people forget you'd have meat box he said were contained and you got to take

2204
02:09:44.791 --> 02:09:45.760
care of that thing.
Yeah.

2205
02:09:45.820 --> 02:09:49.110
You see so many people that are unhappy because they doubt.
Yeah.
You know,
and,

2206
02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:53.010
and I,
I live in this weird place.
Like I make people happy by sharing booze,

2207
02:09:53.011 --> 02:09:55.800
knowledge and accessibility with them too much.

2208
02:09:55.801 --> 02:09:58.530
There is such thing as too much of a good thing and that,
you know,

2209
02:09:58.531 --> 02:09:59.880
and so you see a lot of that too.

2210
02:10:00.590 --> 02:10:03.680
<v 0>I mean you are,
you know,
a trafficker of,</v>

2211
02:10:04.190 --> 02:10:07.010
of goodness but also vices for a lot of hundred percent.
Right.

2212
02:10:07.100 --> 02:10:08.900
I struggle with that actually.
Well,
no,
no,
no.

2213
02:10:08.901 --> 02:10:11.330
And I'm not saying that in an accusatory fashion cause I've got an,

2214
02:10:11.331 --> 02:10:15.650
I mean I have an entire closet full of booze behind us.
Yeah.
Uh,
but the,

2215
02:10:17.570 --> 02:10:20.570
uh,
my question for you,
I mean,
you're in very good shape.

2216
02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:23.980
You travel 300 days of the year or more.
Yup.

2217
02:10:25.070 --> 02:10:26.090
What are some of the keys?

2218
02:10:26.370 --> 02:10:30.570
<v 5>What do you choose your hotels wisely as in make sure that the gym is real.</v>

2219
02:10:30.571 --> 02:10:33.170
In fact,
the best hotels don't have a gym at all,

2220
02:10:33.171 --> 02:10:35.540
but they have a relationship with a real gym,
you know,

2221
02:10:35.541 --> 02:10:37.480
across the street or down the block or something that,

2222
02:10:37.490 --> 02:10:42.050
that actually probably guides my hotel choice tend to one to any other factor.

2223
02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:46.130
How do you determine that?
Well,
you know,
that's big thing.

2224
02:10:46.131 --> 02:10:47.510
Part of it's experience,
right?

2225
02:10:47.540 --> 02:10:51.230
So like I love to stay at the standard East village in Manhattan,

2226
02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:53.720
not the high line,
but east village because they don't have a gym,

2227
02:10:53.721 --> 02:10:56.260
but they have a relationship with the New York health club right across his

2228
02:10:56.261 --> 02:11:00.050
drinking.
I said he just kind of like,
you dig around,
you can find that stuff.
But,

2229
02:11:00.051 --> 02:11:04.580
um,
I mean,
physical fitness is,
it's Paramount's me.

2230
02:11:04.581 --> 02:11:08.380
I know that I think better when I'm healthy.
Oh yeah.

2231
02:11:08.450 --> 02:11:12.470
I'm a nicer guy when I've exercised and actually I actually,

2232
02:11:12.530 --> 02:11:15.620
I really try to peak.
So if I'm at home,
I have the most amazing trainer,

2233
02:11:15.621 --> 02:11:19.640
Aaron Carson and Boulder.
She's awesome.
And we've figured out the schedule,

2234
02:11:19.641 --> 02:11:22.040
so let's do a real,
um,
you know,

2235
02:11:22.041 --> 02:11:25.340
build over seven or if I'm the home for even 10 days,
which is rare,

2236
02:11:25.580 --> 02:11:28.460
even four days,
like let's make it hard,
hard,
hard,
hard,
hard,

2237
02:11:28.461 --> 02:11:32.080
and then I need a rest day when I have to get on the lane.
Travel that smartly.

2238
02:11:32.220 --> 02:11:36.770
Yeah.
Yeah.
So you really try to fit him in there.
What,
uh,
what is your week?

2239
02:11:36.771 --> 02:11:39.740
Let's just say you're traveling for a month at a time.
Yep.

2240
02:11:40.010 --> 02:11:44.010
What is your week of exercise look like?
Minimum seven,
her apartment,

2241
02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:46.430
five out of seven days,
minimum of five.
And you know,

2242
02:11:46.431 --> 02:11:50.000
sometimes that might be tried to do mornings,
mornings.

2243
02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:54.620
What time as you know what I have to caffeinate I would be whole hire fire.

2244
02:11:54.621 --> 02:11:58.760
Didn't say I'm uh,
I'm fully addicted to caffeine for it from tea to coffee,

2245
02:11:58.761 --> 02:12:02.600
but I'll take it however I can get it.
A type of tea we drink.

2246
02:12:02.601 --> 02:12:06.350
A lot of people belong,
a lot of poo air.
Um,
those are the two that matter a lot.

2247
02:12:06.351 --> 02:12:10.220
I have a friend,
he,
I would have considered myself like a coffee geek.

2248
02:12:10.250 --> 02:12:14.130
Xtrordinair um,
everything dialed in and the Scales and the,
you know,

2249
02:12:14.140 --> 02:12:17.570
the temperature,
everything would be like perfect.
Um,

2250
02:12:17.930 --> 02:12:20.270
and then I met this guy,
Sebastian,

2251
02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:23.780
who taught me all about tea and I had tried so hard,
like,
you know,
I read,

2252
02:12:23.781 --> 02:12:25.790
read something like,
Oh man,
I should really know about tea.

2253
02:12:25.791 --> 02:12:29.450
Like it appeals to my wine minder.
Sure.
And I could never do it.

2254
02:12:29.451 --> 02:12:32.690
And I met Sebastian.
He just ruined me.
And it's a ruined you in a good way.

2255
02:12:32.750 --> 02:12:36.310
I want a good way.
So it's all about in pursuit of tea now.
It's cool.
Yeah,

2256
02:12:36.350 --> 02:12:40.700
it's the best.
Yeah.
So caffeine and then try to exercise right away.

2257
02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:44.390
And certainly before you get into the email or your phone or any of that stuff,

2258
02:12:44.391 --> 02:12:47.180
what time do you wake up when you're on the road?
Or do you try to wake up?

2259
02:12:47.210 --> 02:12:51.170
I try to get a minimum of eight hours.
So the time is a moving target,

2260
02:12:51.180 --> 02:12:54.790
especially when,
you know,
I've been in five times zones in the last seven.

2261
02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:58.190
You have to socialize at night with.
It's huge.
No.
When you,

2262
02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:02.930
there's the travel to talk to retailers and distributors,

2263
02:13:03.260 --> 02:13:08.090
is that primarily like what accounts for the bulk of the travel?
Um,
you know,

2264
02:13:08.091 --> 02:13:11.960
it's,
I can't,
it's a lot of two things.

2265
02:13:12.350 --> 02:13:17.210
Making and selling,
right?
So the making part is easy.
It's easy to,
I mean,

2266
02:13:17.211 --> 02:13:20.430
for me,
dream something up and you go and you create it,
you know,

2267
02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:24.290
and it's a physical thing and you have something,
it's done.
Um,

2268
02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:27.420
but that takes work.
I mean,
I make things,
um,

2269
02:13:27.890 --> 02:13:32.240
on three continents today,
which continent?
Uh,
Australia,
um,

2270
02:13:32.490 --> 02:13:35.760
wine.
Yeah.
We,
so we make wine Australia.
What's it gone?

2271
02:13:35.850 --> 02:13:40.580
It's a called sue set,
which is s u.
C.
E.
T.
T.
E.

2272
02:13:40.740 --> 02:13:43.860
First one comes out next month actually.
Oh,
that's exciting.
So let's put,

2273
02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:46.170
let's put a date on that because people will listen to this for months.
Okay.

2274
02:13:46.171 --> 02:13:49.870
So that's going to be Tobar of 2015.
Yeah.
Cool.

2275
02:13:50.220 --> 02:13:54.570
And Suzette means to suckle and old French since it's a,

2276
02:13:55.050 --> 02:13:58.350
yeah,
it's a cool,
exactly.
You let your mind run wild with that.

2277
02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:01.190
I wasn't going to say it.
Yeah.
So,
uh,

2278
02:14:01.220 --> 02:14:04.770
the white wine will be called Nisha phone and I'll let you look that up.
Um,

2279
02:14:05.340 --> 02:14:08.990
have you smell it?
I'll let everybody will look at I c.
H.
O.
N.
Yeah,

2280
02:14:09.780 --> 02:14:14.650
you guys can put that together.
We make some rosé under my essential,
uh,

2281
02:14:14.690 --> 02:14:18.300
brand in the south of France.
And of course it makes number mescaline.

2282
02:14:18.380 --> 02:14:21.960
Wahaca um,
so what I meaning shadow some remaining shadow.

2283
02:14:21.961 --> 02:14:25.260
How did you choose that name?
Uh,
two ways.
First of all,
I mean,

2284
02:14:25.261 --> 02:14:29.580
I think mescal is a little,
even still a little forbidden,
a little dangerous.

2285
02:14:29.581 --> 02:14:34.060
And I believe everybody has a dark side.
I'm certain of it.
I know I do.
Um,

2286
02:14:34.290 --> 02:14:38.710
and the second is maybe a little bit more,
um,
historically referential of Mescal,

2287
02:14:38.820 --> 02:14:40.620
very much in the shadow of Tequila.

2288
02:14:40.890 --> 02:14:45.580
<v 0>Ah,
I like that.
Yeah.
I have a friend who's done a lot of work with,
uh,</v>

2289
02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:51.830
shall we say plant medicine,
psychedelics and awesome.
And oddly enough,
he,

2290
02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:56.390
that's true,
right?
The little people and Mushrooms,

2291
02:14:56.420 --> 02:15:01.370
sacred mushrooms have been used for Millennia and Mexico of course.

2292
02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:05.540
Uh,
and he did not spend time in Mexico,

2293
02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:07.100
but for whatever reason,

2294
02:15:07.101 --> 02:15:11.300
he drank all sorts of different alcoholic beverages before this work.

2295
02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:16.040
And now for whatever reason,
he can only drink miss gow.
Yeah,
no,
I believe that.

2296
02:15:16.610 --> 02:15:21.170
I don't know why,
but that's,
it's the only beverage that he can consume.
Uh,

2297
02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:24.740
he does it very irregularly,
but when it comes to alcohol,
Miss Gallon's,

2298
02:15:24.741 --> 02:15:28.370
all he can consume.
That's amazing.
Out of nowhere.
Yeah.
Wow.
Crazy.
Really Weird.

2299
02:15:28.371 --> 02:15:31.760
Or It's good for Ya.
Yeah,
apparently.
So a and M,

2300
02:15:32.110 --> 02:15:37.090
<v 5>well,
the other half of that travel question,
why so much is the selling piece,
so,</v>

2301
02:15:37.091 --> 02:15:39.760
right.
So if you the listener one to buy a bottle of Sombra,

2302
02:15:39.820 --> 02:15:42.100
the first thing I had to do was important to America,

2303
02:15:42.580 --> 02:15:44.760
then you have to sell it thanks to um,
you know,

2304
02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:48.040
the repeal of prohibition and all the laws that followed that I have to sell it

2305
02:15:48.041 --> 02:15:48.874
to distributor.

2306
02:15:49.690 --> 02:15:52.900
So then we have to sell it to a retailer and then the retailer has to sell to

2307
02:15:52.901 --> 02:15:54.460
you.
So there all these things.

2308
02:15:54.461 --> 02:15:58.450
So I can't just assume that you'd make the first sale and then it ends up on

2309
02:15:58.451 --> 02:16:02.020
your shelf.
We'll find somewhere like for those people listening,

2310
02:16:02.140 --> 02:16:06.160
thankfully everywhere,
10 years later,
all across America,
everywhere,
everywhere.

2311
02:16:06.550 --> 02:16:11.410
<v 0>So like if I went to,
I'm just making one up here,
what does it KNL here?</v>

2312
02:16:11.411 --> 02:16:15.220
Am I making absolutely k and l wine there or he's not wine the candle.

2313
02:16:15.460 --> 02:16:18.770
I Dunno if Kaino has it,
but we're certainly all over San Francisco.
Okay.
Yeah.

2314
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:20.940
Well you guys can search for it.
So,
uh,

2315
02:16:21.130 --> 02:16:26.130
what is the hundred dollars or less purchase that comes to mind that has had the

2316
02:16:27.191 --> 02:16:29.980
biggest impact on life?
That's

2317
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:31.450
<v 5>interesting.
Um,</v>

2318
02:16:34.240 --> 02:16:35.500
I'm not a material guy.

2319
02:16:35.501 --> 02:16:39.190
And having that set of like next who's got something free,
something what?

2320
02:16:39.250 --> 02:16:42.010
It could be something free.
It could be something free.

2321
02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:48.930
Can it be donation?
Can it be a donation?
Sure.
Yeah.

2322
02:16:48.931 --> 02:16:53.130
I mean we try to support small things in many ways all the time.

2323
02:16:53.131 --> 02:16:54.880
So my daughter and I just,
um,

2324
02:16:55.950 --> 02:17:00.930
gave to donors choose and Oh yes,
she's amazing.
Dollar shoes is amazing.

2325
02:17:00.931 --> 02:17:02.700
I'm on their advisory board.
Oh,
that's so cool.

2326
02:17:02.701 --> 02:17:04.830
I've been doing stuff donor shoes for like seven years.
Yeah.

2327
02:17:05.020 --> 02:17:09.600
So to have the occasion to like sit with her and figure out like,
hey,

2328
02:17:09.601 --> 02:17:12.450
we want to give it to this class near our community.

2329
02:17:12.451 --> 02:17:17.160
Here's why mean it's enriching because you get to enrich that experience and

2330
02:17:17.161 --> 02:17:17.731
donors choose.

2331
02:17:17.731 --> 02:17:20.550
But it's enriching for my daughter and I to have that discussion and it

2332
02:17:20.551 --> 02:17:22.850
facilitates so much more,
you know,

2333
02:17:22.860 --> 02:17:27.480
and father daughter time and her education and that's,
that's meaningful.
Totally.

2334
02:17:27.540 --> 02:17:28.740
Yeah.
Yeah.
I um,

2335
02:17:29.190 --> 02:17:34.140
my parents used to help me.
I want to see it was a UNICEF,

2336
02:17:34.141 --> 02:17:37.950
but I could be giving that completely wrong.
I think I am.

2337
02:17:38.250 --> 02:17:42.660
But determining what to donate to someone in a third world country,

2338
02:17:42.661 --> 02:17:47.661
whether it be like a number of chickens or a goat or a this or that.

2339
02:17:48.241 --> 02:17:52.230
And the,
the the conversation,
uh,

2340
02:17:52.231 --> 02:17:54.240
and walking your kid through,

2341
02:17:54.241 --> 02:17:59.241
helping them walk themselves through the decision is a fascinating,

2342
02:18:00.150 --> 02:18:01.540
it's very valuable.
Yeah.

2343
02:18:04.930 --> 02:18:08.320
Do you have favorite movie or documentary?

2344
02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:13.330
Several.
Um,
you,

2345
02:18:13.900 --> 02:18:16.610
it's funny also on the topic of the kid.
Uh,

2346
02:18:17.650 --> 02:18:22.630
we watched the breakfast club last night.
Oh Wow.
First blast from the past.
Yeah.

2347
02:18:22.631 --> 02:18:26.260
So she's just started high,
uh,
sophomore year in high school and new school.

2348
02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:28.090
And I was like,
this is,

2349
02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:32.430
I remember this being so formative 30 years ago for me and we watched it and

2350
02:18:32.431 --> 02:18:35.140
just,
you know,
shooting tears and laughter and the whole thing.

2351
02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:38.260
But there's so many great movies like that.
I wouldn't say that's my favorite,

2352
02:18:38.261 --> 02:18:41.830
but for sure that,
that's the most recent my mind.
Um,
I love the movie.

2353
02:18:41.831 --> 02:18:45.460
Baraka is actually a good one.
Yeah.
Very visual.

2354
02:18:45.780 --> 02:18:50.710
And it really reminds me of,
of a lot of things.
We one B a r a.
K.
A.

2355
02:18:50.711 --> 02:18:51.760
Exactly.
Yeah.

2356
02:18:52.030 --> 02:18:57.030
Baraka for me is meaningful because it talks about how amazing our planet is,

2357
02:18:59.230 --> 02:19:00.700
how fragile our planet is.

2358
02:19:01.420 --> 02:19:04.990
It reminds me of the geologic timescale.

2359
02:19:05.050 --> 02:19:08.080
This is like a profoundly important thing to me at the geologic timescale.

2360
02:19:08.081 --> 02:19:11.950
When you look at how long it's taken,
everything and how,
I mean,

2361
02:19:11.951 --> 02:19:14.800
what's San Francisco gonna look like in several hundred years and what we're all

2362
02:19:14.801 --> 02:19:17.110
going to be long gone.
In fact,
humanity might be gone.
Who knows?

2363
02:19:17.111 --> 02:19:21.510
Who knows what will happen,
but that we're just this tiny little blip in,

2364
02:19:21.690 --> 02:19:26.380
in time,
like we matter,
not at all.
And so just reminds me to party.

2365
02:19:27.230 --> 02:19:31.580
Have a great time here.
You're barely here.
Get after it and crush your life.

2366
02:19:31.581 --> 02:19:35.320
It's awesome.
Don't take everything so seriously.
Totally.
Yeah,
totally.

2367
02:19:36.370 --> 02:19:40.640
That's,
that's it.
Um,
with your workouts,

2368
02:19:40.700 --> 02:19:45.050
if you could only choose three exercises or types of exercise for your workouts,

2369
02:19:45.051 --> 02:19:48.400
what would you choose?
Burpees.
Burpees?
Yup.

2370
02:19:49.420 --> 02:19:53.870
Um,
squats
and intervals.

2371
02:19:54.420 --> 02:19:58.690
What type?
Short intervals.
The 40 seconds on,
20 seconds off running.

2372
02:19:59.330 --> 02:20:03.680
Got It.
Yeah,
that's a good combo.
You're ready for the military?
Uh,
Tim,

2373
02:20:03.681 --> 02:20:05.540
I used to run a lot.
Um,

2374
02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:11.000
the longest I ever ran it once was 82 and a half miles.
That's fucking long.

2375
02:20:11.310 --> 02:20:13.780
Well,
the race was a hundred,
so that was a problem.

2376
02:20:15.260 --> 02:20:18.790
82 and a half miles is no joke.
Yeah.
Any.

2377
02:20:18.860 --> 02:20:23.390
So can you just like fuck off at any given moment and just like run 20 miles?
Um,

2378
02:20:23.391 --> 02:20:26.450
I think I can probably get 20 miles done.

2379
02:20:26.451 --> 02:20:29.720
I don't know if I could run them and that and I quit.
So after that summer,

2380
02:20:30.540 --> 02:20:32.570
after the [inaudible] 82 and a half,
yeah,
I,
you know,

2381
02:20:32.571 --> 02:20:36.050
I started running in the year 2000 when I moved to Colorado and it was great.

2382
02:20:36.060 --> 02:20:38.840
I loved it and I started competing and then,
you know,

2383
02:20:38.841 --> 02:20:43.100
as a citizen did pretty well,
um,
by no means a professional,

2384
02:20:43.101 --> 02:20:48.101
but I really liked it and it was a way to clear my head and they say about

2385
02:20:49.071 --> 02:20:51.950
runners either running from something or to something and there is for sure an

2386
02:20:51.951 --> 02:20:56.060
element of that to my running also.
Which one was,
which one was a real for both.

2387
02:20:56.810 --> 02:21:01.580
I can name both pieces.
Um,
so,
but I found,

2388
02:21:01.640 --> 02:21:05.080
okay,
let's go farther,
let's go farther.
And then it was,
um,
you know,

2389
02:21:05.120 --> 02:21:07.240
I'll trail marathons and then ha,
you know,

2390
02:21:07.250 --> 02:21:09.290
50 mile races and there and that was great.

2391
02:21:09.291 --> 02:21:13.570
And then you cross that threshold and,
and it becomes really catabolic.
Yeah.

2392
02:21:13.820 --> 02:21:18.260
And I was almost 30 pounds lighter than I am now.
And you're not a huge guy.

2393
02:21:18.261 --> 02:21:21.080
I mean you're not thin,
but you're not like a huge totally,

2394
02:21:21.110 --> 02:21:25.370
you don't have 30 pounds to spare.
No.
And then,
but you know,
it's about,
you know,

2395
02:21:25.371 --> 02:21:28.020
strength to weight ratio and how quickly you're going to get over that mountain

2396
02:21:28.021 --> 02:21:29.810
and then over the next mountain,
the next mountain.

2397
02:21:30.380 --> 02:21:33.620
And I wanted to get stronger and as things start to break,

2398
02:21:33.980 --> 02:21:37.610
but as you would like get strong in the gym and then you go start renting again

2399
02:21:37.611 --> 02:21:41.750
and your body just eats itself,
then it all goes away and you're like,
oh wow.

2400
02:21:41.750 --> 02:21:45.620
And then with that comes so much inflammation and I'm a big believer,

2401
02:21:45.650 --> 02:21:48.200
at least for me,
it's just not him.
I actually believe for people,

2402
02:21:48.201 --> 02:21:52.160
it's not good to run that long a distance sound.
But so feel free not to answer,

2403
02:21:52.161 --> 02:21:56.780
but what were you running from and running to?
Oh,
you know what,
I am,
um,

2404
02:21:57.590 --> 02:22:00.920
I think probably not that dissimilar to you.

2405
02:22:00.921 --> 02:22:05.921
I'm also very hard on myself and you know,

2406
02:22:06.021 --> 02:22:07.940
when I do something I want to do it very,
very well.

2407
02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:12.800
And I think everything was really working very,

2408
02:22:12.801 --> 02:22:16.640
very well for me except for my marriage.
And it wasn't working well at all.

2409
02:22:16.670 --> 02:22:18.900
In fact,
that was was brutal.
Um,

2410
02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:24.290
and I was running to a place of candor where,
again,

2411
02:22:24.291 --> 02:22:28.800
part of being hard on yourself as being honest with yourself and I,

2412
02:22:29.460 --> 02:22:34.230
I treasure candor and the occasion to sit just live in it.
Right.

2413
02:22:34.590 --> 02:22:39.590
So I'm running to that place where I was honest about all of it and you know,

2414
02:22:41.880 --> 02:22:43.650
where I was wasn't that place.

2415
02:22:44.450 --> 02:22:46.670
<v 0>But yeah,
I'm not,</v>

2416
02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:50.390
I'm not particularly good at intimate relationships.
Yeah.

2417
02:22:50.510 --> 02:22:54.980
I don't think I'm the worst [inaudible] abusive.
I'm not,
you know,
total bastard,

2418
02:22:54.981 --> 02:22:59.570
but I,
uh,
I shut off a lot.

2419
02:23:00.030 --> 02:23:04.820
And intimate relationships.
Yup.
It's like,
I don't like the uncontrollable,

2420
02:23:04.850 --> 02:23:07.910
unpredictable nature of a lot of it.
I feel you completely,
you know what I mean?

2421
02:23:08.260 --> 02:23:09.093
Because you're the guy,

2422
02:23:09.210 --> 02:23:12.920
you're the guy who has like the seven foot stack of notes on wine.
Yeah.

2423
02:23:13.100 --> 02:23:15.440
I that you win the game,
right?
I mean,
so to speak.
Yeah.

2424
02:23:15.441 --> 02:23:18.440
We're used to and it's like we're sitting for those people who aren't here,

2425
02:23:18.441 --> 02:23:19.610
which is everyone.
Uh,

2426
02:23:19.640 --> 02:23:23.330
we're right next to a bookshelf and I have an entire shelf of notebooks.
Yeah.

2427
02:23:23.390 --> 02:23:24.021
Right.
And it's like,

2428
02:23:24.021 --> 02:23:29.021
that's how I can predict the trajectory of exactly on the blank.

2429
02:23:30.770 --> 02:23:33.020
Yup.
But with a relationship,
oh wait,

2430
02:23:33.021 --> 02:23:36.500
there's another person with their own ideas and feelings and concepts and

2431
02:23:36.501 --> 02:23:39.140
preconceptions just like me.
Free radical.

2432
02:23:40.190 --> 02:23:44.900
My dog just stretched and kicked the crate door open and,

2433
02:23:45.020 --> 02:23:48.830
but is not moving.
It's hilarious.
She's still beautifully asleep.

2434
02:23:49.820 --> 02:23:54.110
Completely asleep.
Yeah.
Um,
if you could give your,
let's see,

2435
02:23:56.750 --> 02:23:58.040
when you were 25,
where were you

2436
02:23:59.380 --> 02:24:00.680
<v 5>when I was 25?</v>

2437
02:24:00.860 --> 02:24:05.860
I had just finished my graduate thesis and was about to take that first cooking

2438
02:24:06.141 --> 02:24:10.100
job in Montana.
What advice would you have given yourself at 25?

2439
02:24:10.580 --> 02:24:14.870
Don't be so fucking shy.
Don't be so fucking shy.
Yeah,
that's what you were shy.

2440
02:24:14.930 --> 02:24:18.740
Oh Dude,
I even really until recently,

2441
02:24:18.741 --> 02:24:21.890
I can still think of instances like within the last 24 months were like,
man,

2442
02:24:21.891 --> 02:24:25.340
Richard,
I wish you had been more forward.
I wish you'd,
you talked about,

2443
02:24:25.341 --> 02:24:29.300
I wish you would ask for x instead of being so subtle and implying it.

2444
02:24:29.301 --> 02:24:32.990
And I try to go for that subtle elegant thing,
which sounds really nice.

2445
02:24:32.991 --> 02:24:36.800
I think part of that is actually being shy and I am,

2446
02:24:37.460 --> 02:24:40.550
you know,
ferociously competitive with myself.

2447
02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:45.880
But sometimes the clues that you put outwardly are too subtle to be heard or

2448
02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:50.720
someone's just talking louder than you.
Yeah,
exactly.
And,
and that's,

2449
02:24:50.750 --> 02:24:53.780
that's actually more and more the case I think.
So,
um,

2450
02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:56.930
I would have told myself to then much more forward.

2451
02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:01.180
<v 0>And what about at 30?
So let's,
let's put a tire mark on that.</v>

2452
02:25:01.210 --> 02:25:02.110
Where were you at 30,

2453
02:25:03.170 --> 02:25:07.850
<v 5>30?
Um,
my daughter had been born four months prior.</v>

2454
02:25:08.480 --> 02:25:11.270
I had the best wine job in the world.
Um,

2455
02:25:11.930 --> 02:25:16.160
I was getting fit living in Aspen,
learning a ton,

2456
02:25:17.170 --> 02:25:21.710
um,
very,
very focused on this master.
So my exam.
Um,

2457
02:25:21.950 --> 02:25:26.860
and that
would I do there,
I would probably party a little less,

2458
02:25:26.950 --> 02:25:30.400
which I,
you know,
I keep coming back to this thing of balance.

2459
02:25:30.730 --> 02:25:35.710
And so yeah,
you're an aspen and the party like a rock star,
it's party time.

2460
02:25:35.790 --> 02:25:40.150
Wow.
What that means for me is I also want to be competitive and all these other

2461
02:25:40.151 --> 02:25:43.810
levels so you have to balance it with exercising like an Olympian.

2462
02:25:43.900 --> 02:25:46.930
And I did that and so everything was very,

2463
02:25:46.931 --> 02:25:50.830
very full and it was great.
You know,
the exercise was crazy,

2464
02:25:50.831 --> 02:25:53.290
the party was crazy,
the sleep wasn't much.

2465
02:25:53.680 --> 02:25:57.440
Family Time was interesting and wonderful on so many levels,
um,

2466
02:25:57.550 --> 02:26:01.030
and not on others.
And then you're working and you're studying for this exam.

2467
02:26:01.060 --> 02:26:05.380
Right.
And so if,
um,
I don't believe in regret.

2468
02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:09.760
I do not believe in regret.
And so I don't want this to come across as that.

2469
02:26:09.761 --> 02:26:14.680
But if I had that piece to Redo,
I would dial back some of the party.

2470
02:26:14.950 --> 02:26:18.430
Not all of it.
I still love,
I still party.
I love it.
But,
um,

2471
02:26:19.540 --> 02:26:23.200
but I would take some of that back and then reallocate that time elsewhere.

2472
02:26:24.250 --> 02:26:25.150
Where would you allocate it?

2473
02:26:26.250 --> 02:26:29.380
I probably would have started my first business sooner than later.

2474
02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:31.750
It wasn't that far afterwards.
Yeah.

2475
02:26:31.900 --> 02:26:36.310
I passed the master som examine and started my first wine company the next day.

2476
02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:38.150
What are your first company do?
Um,

2477
02:26:38.180 --> 02:26:41.260
so it was called Betson shoal and I founded it with a,
an amazing guy,

2478
02:26:41.261 --> 02:26:45.880
Dennis Shul.
Uh,
he's,
he's really,
really a special s c h o l l s c h o.

2479
02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:48.040
L.
L.
And Dennis.
Um,

2480
02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:51.690
I mean that's is mainly for a lot of reasons,
uh,

2481
02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:56.740
that you guys can look up and you should,
he's,
he's really,
he's really very,
very,

2482
02:26:56.741 --> 02:27:00.640
very driven also.
And we started making wine in Australia,
then we added France,

2483
02:27:00.641 --> 02:27:03.130
then we had a Napa valley than we co founded.

2484
02:27:03.131 --> 02:27:05.590
Another company called Scarpetta making wine in Italy.

2485
02:27:06.110 --> 02:27:08.500
And in 2009 we sold all of it.

2486
02:27:08.950 --> 02:27:12.580
Scarp passes who an investor group and bets and shoal to a small public company.

2487
02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:17.230
That was a great day.
Um,
but yeah,
you know,

2488
02:27:17.231 --> 02:27:21.370
it comes back to that time function.
I'm always thinking about can,

2489
02:27:21.371 --> 02:27:24.790
I don't want to beat myself up over something where I see an inefficiency in my

2490
02:27:24.791 --> 02:27:27.970
past.
But I,
you know,
if you have it to do over,

2491
02:27:27.971 --> 02:27:30.220
I would try to get rid of those inefficiencies.

2492
02:27:31.630 --> 02:27:33.760
What do you think are things that

2493
02:27:34.780 --> 02:27:35.310
<v 1>yeah,</v>

2494
02:27:35.310 --> 02:27:38.190
<v 5>many people do automatically or,</v>

2495
02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:40.793
<v 1>okay,</v>

2496
02:27:40.910 --> 02:27:41.743
<v 5>well I'll leave it at that.</v>

2497
02:27:41.930 --> 02:27:45.890
What are things that a lot of people do automatically or assume they have to do

2498
02:27:46.190 --> 02:27:50.310
that they should question.
Go to college.
Totally.
Shit.
Like,

2499
02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:56.990
I went to,
to college and I learned,
I mean,
we went to Occidental,

2500
02:27:56.991 --> 02:27:59.570
I made the Dean's list and not the good Dean's list.

2501
02:27:59.571 --> 02:28:01.470
I Made Dean can hours blacklist.

2502
02:28:04.330 --> 02:28:07.520
So what did you do to earn a place on the blacklist?
Oh,

2503
02:28:07.521 --> 02:28:09.800
a bunch of D's and F's and I partied.
I was just,

2504
02:28:09.860 --> 02:28:12.170
I mean it was in la as long ways from the beach,
but you know,

2505
02:28:12.171 --> 02:28:15.950
like take a kid from the desert and stick him in the city and he loves the
ocean.

2506
02:28:15.980 --> 02:28:16.850
I grew up on,
you know,

2507
02:28:16.851 --> 02:28:20.540
also in the ocean almost every weekend in Mexico with my family.
Um,

2508
02:28:21.620 --> 02:28:26.060
so I spent,
you know,
five days a week riding waves and not in class.

2509
02:28:26.510 --> 02:28:31.280
Um,
so Emma was,
that was fantastic.
I wouldn't take that back.
Um,

2510
02:28:31.340 --> 02:28:35.780
I learned a ton and I learned about myself.
It wasn't so much like,
you know,

2511
02:28:36.230 --> 02:28:40.010
I don't know a whole lot about Macbeth and I don't care and I don't feel bad

2512
02:28:40.011 --> 02:28:43.340
about it,
but I learned a lot about Richard Bets and that was really,

2513
02:28:43.341 --> 02:28:47.830
really meaningful.
I don't think I needed to go to,
you know,

2514
02:28:47.870 --> 02:28:51.290
a liberal arts school and spend as much money as they did,
which was all alone,

2515
02:28:51.291 --> 02:28:53.330
you know,
so on and so forth.
He paid it back and deal with it.

2516
02:28:53.331 --> 02:28:57.800
But I don't think that that was necessarily the only path to achieve that.

2517
02:28:58.610 --> 02:29:01.940
Whatever level of self awareness was achieved by spending that time there.

2518
02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:03.740
If you hadn't gone to college,

2519
02:29:03.800 --> 02:29:08.180
how do you think your trajectory would have been different?
I think,

2520
02:29:08.930 --> 02:29:12.770
you know,
I look on the bright side.
I'm hopeful that it would,

2521
02:29:13.770 --> 02:29:14.290
<v 1>yeah.</v>

2522
02:29:14.290 --> 02:29:18.040
<v 5>B,
those,
um,
be more abbreviated.</v>

2523
02:29:18.190 --> 02:29:19.900
So those inefficiencies and time,

2524
02:29:19.930 --> 02:29:22.870
I think that some of those would have gone away.
Uh,
you know,

2525
02:29:22.871 --> 02:29:27.310
probably would have been useful to go volunteer somewhere and just work,

2526
02:29:27.490 --> 02:29:30.250
um,
you know,
for,
for a good cause.
Yeah.

2527
02:29:30.400 --> 02:29:33.280
And come back and you develop that self awareness.

2528
02:29:33.281 --> 02:29:36.550
You'd be thankful for so much.
Um,

2529
02:29:36.890 --> 02:29:40.320
eh would have avoided some of those distractions.
Although,
I don't know Tim,
like,

2530
02:29:40.321 --> 02:29:45.321
I don't know if if the need to like hit the wall is genetic or not.

2531
02:29:45.731 --> 02:29:49.300
Like I definitely had a need to hit the wall and,
you know,
hit it hard,

2532
02:29:49.600 --> 02:29:53.590
hit the wall and was,
um,
yeah,

2533
02:29:53.591 --> 02:29:58.480
just find the guardrails,
be it with substances,
with grades,

2534
02:29:58.481 --> 02:29:59.260
with right.

2535
02:29:59.260 --> 02:30:03.460
Significant others with just a push of deliberates with physical things or you

2536
02:30:03.461 --> 02:30:06.430
could have died,
you know?
Yeah.
Um,
so,

2537
02:30:07.420 --> 02:30:08.160
<v 1>okay.</v>

2538
02:30:08.160 --> 02:30:12.660
<v 5>Those finding that,
finding those guard rails is important,</v>

2539
02:30:12.661 --> 02:30:14.910
however you find them.
What a

2540
02:30:16.410 --> 02:30:17.820
dean and a fancy school

2541
02:30:18.840 --> 02:30:19.400
<v 1>yeah.</v>

2542
02:30:19.400 --> 02:30:22.770
<v 5>Facilitated a whole lot more fucking off.
Yeah.
It was,
Scott,</v>

2543
02:30:22.780 --> 02:30:24.410
it sounds sort of care and treatment is strange,

2544
02:30:24.411 --> 02:30:28.250
but you're in this isolated bubble.
Yeah.
You're facing the real world.
Yeah,
yeah,

2545
02:30:28.310 --> 02:30:29.900
yeah.
Until you get out and you face your loans,

2546
02:30:29.901 --> 02:30:31.640
but you're really not facing the world.

2547
02:30:31.641 --> 02:30:35.780
Worald so I don't think that was super productive.
What's

2548
02:30:36.580 --> 02:30:40.240
<v 0>would you put on a billboard if you could have a billboard anywhere?</v>

2549
02:30:40.350 --> 02:30:43.050
<v 5>Oh,
it average highs.
My ninth grade class.
Love Yourself.</v>

2550
02:30:43.830 --> 02:30:47.010
<v 0>Yeah,
there's a book that helped me quite a bit with that.</v>

2551
02:30:47.380 --> 02:30:49.830
I called love yourself like your life depends on it.

2552
02:30:49.831 --> 02:30:52.420
It's got a very scary congress.
Uh,
yeah,

2553
02:30:52.470 --> 02:30:56.210
I was this guy with a gun against his head with like a heart.
It's a bike.

2554
02:30:56.280 --> 02:31:00.870
Come all Ravi Khan,
who is the brother.
He has the best hair in the world.
Also.

2555
02:31:00.871 --> 02:31:02.790
You should look up Google images.
Come over.
I've gotten had,

2556
02:31:02.880 --> 02:31:04.830
I wish I had his hair.
Uh,

2557
02:31:04.860 --> 02:31:08.220
but his brother was also interviewed on this podcast novel.
Um,

2558
02:31:10.200 --> 02:31:15.050
any other,
well first of all,
I want to Segue to,
uh,

2559
02:31:15.080 --> 02:31:15.780
obviously the book book

2560
02:31:15.780 --> 02:31:16.950
<v 5>that is right here in front of me,</v>

2561
02:31:17.010 --> 02:31:20.070
the central scratch and sniff guide to becoming a node.
All

2562
02:31:20.490 --> 02:31:23.670
<v 2>whiskey with an e w,
h,
I.
S.
K,</v>

2563
02:31:23.671 --> 02:31:28.570
e y given us country of publishing in this case.
Yeah,
exactly.
And the,
the what,

2564
02:31:28.571 --> 02:31:32.880
what are people gonna find in this book?
You know,
your booze before you choose.

2565
02:31:32.910 --> 02:31:37.050
Exactly.
You're going to find democracy is essentially it.
I think,

2566
02:31:37.140 --> 02:31:42.140
I think the role of the critic has never been less important.

2567
02:31:42.900 --> 02:31:46.470
I really believe that,
you know,
it's one thing to curate something,

2568
02:31:46.471 --> 02:31:48.390
but it's another thing to prescribe something.

2569
02:31:48.870 --> 02:31:53.870
And I'm really interested in helping people enjoy their lives.

2570
02:31:54.630 --> 02:31:59.340
We don't do it with stuffed shirts now.
Ascots no talking down to people,

2571
02:31:59.341 --> 02:32:02.430
no fancy language,
none of that.
None of that matters.

2572
02:32:02.890 --> 02:32:05.040
And it's certainly not inclusive.

2573
02:32:05.250 --> 02:32:08.220
All those things do serve to intimidate and make it exclusive.

2574
02:32:08.790 --> 02:32:11.150
So much like the wine book,
um,

2575
02:32:11.340 --> 02:32:16.340
my cocreators crystal English Sacca and Wendy McNaughton and I have tried to

2576
02:32:18.300 --> 02:32:23.280
apply a methodology to knock whiskey off the pedestal and say,
look,
this is it.

2577
02:32:23.310 --> 02:32:25.410
It's not that hard.
This is what goes in it.

2578
02:32:25.740 --> 02:32:27.660
This is what makes it taste the way it does.

2579
02:32:28.260 --> 02:32:32.010
And then decide which pieces you like and put those back together to find the

2580
02:32:32.011 --> 02:32:34.950
drink that's going to make you smile.
And that's,
that's the key.

2581
02:32:35.090 --> 02:32:38.220
You have some beauty.
I mean the format is beautiful.
I mean the layout.
Yeah,

2582
02:32:38.790 --> 02:32:42.900
you guys are a hell of a team.
I mean,
the crystal obviously is amazing.
Uh,
Wendy,

2583
02:32:42.901 --> 02:32:47.190
just incredible artists.
And uh,
for instance,
there's,

2584
02:32:47.220 --> 02:32:50.460
there's a a two page spread here.
It's uh,

2585
02:32:50.520 --> 02:32:53.100
it's Richard naked laid out on a bear hug.
No,
I'm kidding.

2586
02:32:53.101 --> 02:32:56.700
It's true language of the label,
uh,
in the United States and everywhere else.

2587
02:32:56.701 --> 02:32:59.790
And it's this bottle split in half and it allows you,
it helps,
it shows you in,

2588
02:32:59.791 --> 02:33:04.791
in a very graphic way or very visual way how to make sense of labels.

2589
02:33:07.380 --> 02:33:09.180
And then you have,
I haven't explored this yet,

2590
02:33:09.181 --> 02:33:12.810
but I'm excited to the map to your whiskey desires.
Exactly.

2591
02:33:12.811 --> 02:33:14.400
So can you explain this,
this,
that.

2592
02:33:14.401 --> 02:33:17.970
So once he's looked like an astrological chart,
but it's not exactly.

2593
02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:21.570
Essentially the book is,
it's 20 pages,
10 spreads,
um,

2594
02:33:21.600 --> 02:33:23.860
hardcore hard cardboard pages.

2595
02:33:23.861 --> 02:33:26.880
So it's that kid's book feel except for adults obviously.

2596
02:33:27.540 --> 02:33:29.760
And when you scratch and sniff your way through it,
you understand,
okay,

2597
02:33:29.761 --> 02:33:32.970
this is what the different grains smell like next.

2598
02:33:33.300 --> 02:33:36.660
This is what the different wood components smell like.
Finally,

2599
02:33:36.661 --> 02:33:40.350
this is what place smells like this is what the place where the whiskey is made

2600
02:33:40.351 --> 02:33:42.840
and how it's aged in parts to the different whiskeys.

2601
02:33:42.841 --> 02:33:46.920
So you've scratched and sniffed your way through this thing and now you put them

2602
02:33:46.921 --> 02:33:50.450
back together.
So you start in the middle and the first question is,
you know,

2603
02:33:50.460 --> 02:33:52.260
what do you do?
You want it spicy?
Okay,

2604
02:33:52.261 --> 02:33:56.880
well I'm guessing you probably don't because you didn't go for this Rye,
right?

2605
02:33:57.030 --> 02:34:01.920
Yup.
But you do like the malty thing,
right?
So,
so you were an old chick science.

2606
02:34:01.921 --> 02:34:05.330
So then I ended up heading outward.
This looks like a um,

2607
02:34:05.940 --> 02:34:07.600
a series of concentric circles.

2608
02:34:07.601 --> 02:34:12.270
It's kind of like a choose your own adventure map to finding your ideal group

2609
02:34:12.490 --> 02:34:14.100
total of whiskey.
Exactly.

2610
02:34:14.130 --> 02:34:18.070
And as you travel from question to question from inside to outside,

2611
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:20.680
<v 0>then you end up with your,</v>

2612
02:34:21.430 --> 02:34:25.570
your selection of whiskey to start with.
And what's really cool,

2613
02:34:25.571 --> 02:34:27.940
I didn't notice until right now is,
and they,

2614
02:34:27.941 --> 02:34:32.941
they traverse a spectrum from mixed slash rocks to sip to sip slow.

2615
02:34:34.450 --> 02:34:37.620
He's like this last guy that we had,
we'd be in the sips low category low.

2616
02:34:37.630 --> 02:34:41.980
Exactly.
So cool.
Yeah.
So,
so cool.
We'll do this is,

2617
02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:45.970
this is fantastic.
I everybody's check this out.

2618
02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:51.000
I have given away the scratch and sniff guide that Richard and his,

2619
02:34:52.061 --> 02:34:56.230
uh,
his cocreators put together for wine many,

2620
02:34:56.231 --> 02:34:58.550
many times.
And uh,

2621
02:34:58.940 --> 02:35:03.040
I'm very excited about this because as insecure as I was around wine,

2622
02:35:03.041 --> 02:35:04.300
I could bullshit my way through it,

2623
02:35:04.510 --> 02:35:07.810
but I could never bullshit my way through whiskey.

2624
02:35:07.811 --> 02:35:09.490
And this actually gives you more than bullshit.

2625
02:35:09.491 --> 02:35:11.980
It gives you a very solid fundamental understanding,

2626
02:35:12.400 --> 02:35:14.470
not only for yourself but that you can explain to other people.

2627
02:35:14.470 --> 02:35:18.640
So you should definitely check that out.
Richard Bets,
B e t t.

2628
02:35:18.641 --> 02:35:23.641
S where can people find you on the interwebs and so on at Yo bets every old

2629
02:35:24.211 --> 02:35:28.810
beds.
Yeah.
Yo Bets.
Why Ovi tts and that's true of everything.
Facebook,
Twitter,

2630
02:35:28.860 --> 02:35:31.630
Instagram,
like Gmail.
So people can,

2631
02:35:31.660 --> 02:35:34.990
people can holler at you and say hello in Twitter.
Yep.
Yo Bets.

2632
02:35:35.010 --> 02:35:38.980
Why obts if there's any,
is there any ask,

2633
02:35:39.100 --> 02:35:43.360
recommendation suggestion that you have for the people listening that is not

2634
02:35:43.361 --> 02:35:47.170
related to the book?
I love that.
Um,

2635
02:35:47.950 --> 02:35:50.950
well first of all,
I'm psyched you're listening.
That's,
that's a really big deal.

2636
02:35:52.210 --> 02:35:53.700
My,
you know,
I mean I,

2637
02:35:53.701 --> 02:35:58.150
I can only speak from personal experience and that's Ah,
to be candid,

2638
02:35:58.690 --> 02:35:59.830
that's been the biggest

2639
02:36:02.430 --> 02:36:05.560
touch point is that you see,
I'm still struggling with it.

2640
02:36:05.561 --> 02:36:10.390
It's the biggest thing that I've,
I've really worked on over the last decade.

2641
02:36:10.391 --> 02:36:11.710
I mean,
my whole life being candid,

2642
02:36:11.711 --> 02:36:16.480
meaning being direct and with be with each other,
with yourself,

2643
02:36:16.660 --> 02:36:19.630
that's really where it starts.
You sure love yourself to love others,

2644
02:36:19.631 --> 02:36:22.450
but be candid with yourself.
Then you can be candid with others.
But like,

2645
02:36:22.451 --> 02:36:25.570
you know,
I don't want,
obviously we're all getting older.

2646
02:36:25.571 --> 02:36:30.571
I live in a business of excess and I want to get old gracefully so I can't lie

2647
02:36:31.091 --> 02:36:34.180
to myself and say,
Oh,
you're in good shape.
Or Ah,
you did push ups yesterday,

2648
02:36:34.190 --> 02:36:36.220
whatever,
you know,
like,
be honest with yourself.
Like,
look dude,

2649
02:36:36.221 --> 02:36:41.110
get up and do them.
You know,
or it matters.
You have to,
um,
or hey look,

2650
02:36:41.111 --> 02:36:41.381
you know,

2651
02:36:41.381 --> 02:36:44.290
maybe you're not being as good a partner as you can be to your partners.
Like,

2652
02:36:44.291 --> 02:36:47.890
you know,
wake up and think about how to be a great partner.
Um,

2653
02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:52.020
which generally means,
you know,
what's the mission of the partnership,
um,
and,

2654
02:36:52.021 --> 02:36:53.080
and do that or I need,
you know,

2655
02:36:53.081 --> 02:36:55.490
there are a million examples in all of our lives if we look around like,

2656
02:36:55.630 --> 02:36:58.690
and it's a matter of like,
what can we do better?
That's it.

2657
02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:02.530
What can you do better?
Be Candid.
Yeah.
With yourself and others.
Yep.
I love it.

2658
02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:05.580
Richard,
this is fantastic.
Thank you.

2659

This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.
I get asked all the time,

2672
02:37:55.801 --> 02:37:57.990
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

2673
02:37:58.340 --> 02:38:00.900
My answer is inevitably athletic Greens.

2674
02:38:00.901 --> 02:38:03.390
It is your all in one nutritional insurance.

2675
02:38:03.391 --> 02:38:05.100
I recommended it in the four hour body,

2676
02:38:05.160 --> 02:38:09.090
did not get paid for that and I travel with it to avoid getting sick.

2677
02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:12.180
I take it in the mornings to ensure optimal performance.

2678
02:38:12.390 --> 02:38:13.650
It just covers all my basis.

2679
02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:17.670
If I can't get what I need through whole food meals throughout the rest of the

2680
02:38:17.670 --> 02:38:22.500
day,
and you can get 50 oh my God,
50% off.
Yes,

If I'm not going commando,
I'm in the Andes.</v>

2688
02:38:52.741 --> 02:38:56.790
I have been testing these underwear for three to four months now pretty much

2689
02:38:56.791 --> 02:39:01.791
every day and in fact throughout bunch of my other underwear this morning and on

2690
02:39:02.011 --> 02:39:06.960
the road in the house,
they are extremely comfortable.
They look good,
feel good.

2691
02:39:07.230 --> 02:39:08.880
They are made of micro modal,

2692
02:39:08.910 --> 02:39:11.930
two times softer than cotton and scientifically tested using the call.

2693
02:39:11.931 --> 02:39:14.700
Bottom method sounds very fancy of course,

2694
02:39:15.030 --> 02:39:18.600
and I get a lot of compliments from ladies for these.
You don't get diaper butt,

2695
02:39:18.630 --> 02:39:20.490
you don't get the tired elastic band.

2696
02:39:20.760 --> 02:39:25.470
They look great and they have underwear for both men and women.

2697
02:39:25.471 --> 02:39:29.230
Check out [inaudible] dot com forward slash Tim and you can see everything I'd

2698
02:39:29.250 --> 02:39:31.170
been wearing.
They're ridiculous to the sublime.

2699
02:39:31.410 --> 02:39:34.950
Everything in between and colluding.
My favorite,
which is called out,

2700
02:39:35.190 --> 02:39:38.460
and I would be remiss if I didn't mention their lounge pants.

2701
02:39:38.460 --> 02:39:39.720
This is a new thing,

2702
02:39:39.780 --> 02:39:42.810
and I've been wearing their lounge pants when I record podcasts.

2703
02:39:43.050 --> 02:39:46.290
I've been wearing them out and about when I'm walking the dog meeting people for

2704
02:39:46.291 --> 02:39:49.960
coffee.
And they are extremely comfortable.

2705
02:39:50.190 --> 02:39:53.460
They're made from the same material as the underwear.
But some of them,

2706
02:39:53.461 --> 02:39:55.410
like the blue ones,
I have have pockets.

2707
02:39:55.440 --> 02:40:00.210
So you can walk about without seeming like you're off of your meds and

2708
02:40:00.211 --> 02:40:02.880
completely crazy.
So that is awesome.

2709
02:40:03.060 --> 02:40:05.700
And if you're not happy with the first pair you try on ice,

2710
02:40:05.701 --> 02:40:08.070
and that refers to the underwear,
they'll refund you completely.

2711
02:40:08.071 --> 02:40:09.660
And you can keep the pair you tried on for free.

2712
02:40:09.690 --> 02:40:10.890
But if you're that kind of person,

2713
02:40:11.070 --> 02:40:14.130
you should be ashamed because that's disgusting.
Uh,
me,
Andy's

2714
02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:19.110
<v 1>dot com slash Tim,

thank you for listening.</v>

2715
02:41:14.460 --> 02:41:14.520
<v 7>Okay.</v>
