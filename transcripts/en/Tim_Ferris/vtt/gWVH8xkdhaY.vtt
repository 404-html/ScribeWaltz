00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.490
Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.
Thank you for tuning in.

2
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.730
I'm going to start with a quote.
This one is from Steve Jobs.

3
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.290
Your time is limited,
so don't waste it living someone else's life.

4
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.341
Good advice.

5
00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:18.320
The second thing I'm going to give you to start off is a probably useless way to

6
00:00:18.321 --> 00:00:23.321
remember how large Mount Fuji is and that's 12,365 feet in terms of altitude and

7
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:30.980
the way you remember that is 12 months in a year,
365 days in a year.

8
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.820
So you're welcome.
This episode features Dan Carlin.

9
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.920
Dan Carlin is hugely impressive to me,

10
00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:41.921
which is obvious when you listen to my initial ramblings and I am clearly

11
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:46.400
nervous and I stumble over a bunch of words,
uh,
which is hilarious.

12
00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:50.660
So I hope you enjoy that awkwardness.
Dan has done many things in his life.

13
00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:52.430
He's been on radio,
he has been on television,

14
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.120
but the way I came to know him was through hardcore history,

15
00:00:56.121 --> 00:01:01.121
which is an incredible podcast and you should put aside for the moment any

16
00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:05.630
reservations or doubts you have about a podcast based on history.

17
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.531
Of course,

18
00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:11.531
this podcast Tim Ferriss show is about deconstructing excellence and if you

19
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:13.220
listen to one episode of hardcore history,

20
00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:18.221
you will realize how absolutely stupendous and amazing Dan Carlin is.

21
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.140
So we,
we get into,
among other things,

22
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.390
his early beginnings stumbling in the beginning first versions of the podcast,

23
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.070
how he grew into it as a full time profession,
his influences,

24
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.360
his habits,
his rituals,
the things that he would do differently,

25
00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.690
the things that he would tell himself when he was 20 years old and on and on and

26
00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:42.350
on.
The point being to pull out tactics,
routines,

27
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.380
tools that you can use not only in podcasting but well outside of podcasting

28
00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:52.010
makes people who are good in a particular arena tend to have a lot in common

29
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:56.090
with people who are the best in other arenas.

<v 1>at this altitude I can and start shaking from all else.</v>

40
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.560
Are you posting a question?

41
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.070
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

42
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.780
<v 0>Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.
Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

43
00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:56.610
and I have a treat for you.

44
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.210
We have Dan Carlin on the phone and Dan,
I have to tell you,

45
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.130
I have had uh,
some,

46
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.840
some fantastic folks on this podcast so far and I've met a lot of people in my

47
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:12.490
life and I have been so nervous about this particular conversation.

48
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:17.491
For weeks now and the part of the reason is there are very few podcasts that I

49
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:21.730
actually listened to on a regular basis and I'm hoping that by the end of this

50
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:22.541
conversation,

51
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:27.541
everyone who listens to this will at the very least listened to one full episode

52
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.790
of hardcore history and this is somewhat akin given that I'm a novice in the

53
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:34.090
podcasting arena.

54
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.200
To me getting in front of a crowd of tens or hundreds of thousands of people and

55
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:43.201
trying to say have a pass with a famous NFL quarterback or do a foul shot

56
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:47.350
competition with the top NBA player or something like that.

57
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.100
I've been so impressed by the quality of your podcasts and we've talked about

58
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:54.124
this before,

59
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.350
recognizing the amount of time and energy that you put into each one of these,

60
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.360
and we'll jump into things in a second,
but just as context I,

61
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.630
I had asked a number of my very close friends who are involved with audio

62
00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:10.300
production and podcasts as well as video,

63
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.490
what their favorite podcasts where and almost without exception hardcore history

64
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:18.010
was listed in the top three for every single person.

65
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:20.200
And of course the first question I asked myself was,

66
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.590
how could a history podcast be one of the most popular podcasts out there?

67
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.290
And I remember downloading the very first episode that I heard of hardcore

68
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:33.460
history,
which was the prophets of doom.

69
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.800
And I looked at the length and I think it's well over four hours if I'm not

70
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:41.830
mistaken.
And I remember thinking to myself,
I'm going to download this.

71
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.820
I'm going to just get a taste for it for the first five to 10 minutes to see if

72
00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:48.880
I can learn anything about the style.
And then that's going to be yet.

73
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.910
And I have digested now dozens and dozens and dozens of hours of your content.

74
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:55.420
So first and foremost,

75
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.990
thank you for putting so much effort into each of these episodes.

76
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.850
<v 2>I don't always know how to react to such nice things that people say.
I mean,
uh,</v>

77
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.280
it,

78
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.280
it's a fantastic compliment and I always tell people that I would love everyone

79
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.060
in their lives to get that feeling of that something you did was so well

80
00:05:14.061 --> 00:05:15.560
received by people.
It's,
it's,

81
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.270
I feel very fortunate and a little like I stumbled into this and like you can't

82
00:05:20.271 --> 00:05:21.980
even really take credit for it.

83
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.600
You just kind of fall into something that after you fall into it seems like

84
00:05:26.601 --> 00:05:28.010
where you should have been all along.

85
00:05:28.011 --> 00:05:32.480
So I feel like a really lucky guy to have stumbled into something that seems to

86
00:05:32.481 --> 00:05:37.370
be so well received.
I appreciate that.
And uh,
yeah,
four hours.
I mean,

87
00:05:37.371 --> 00:05:40.040
if you had told me when we started doing hardcore history that I was going to be

88
00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:43.940
doing for our shows,
I think I would've canceled right then and there.

89
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.100
So you don't want to listen to it.
I didn't want it do.

90
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.350
<v 0>So that's actually where I was hoping to start naturally at the beginning and</v>

91
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.000
give people a little bit of background on how hardcore history came to be.

92
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.020
Because I remember you mentioned in a previous conversation that it started off

93
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.320
very,
very differently.

94
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:08.321
So I'm curious to know how it came to be and what your expectations were at the

95
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:09.590
time,

96
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.590
because certainly it's become an entity unto itself and it's turned into

97
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:16.430
something very,
very big.
But how did it,

98
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.530
how did it come together and how did it start off?

99
00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.220
<v 2>Well maybe other podcasters listening to you will be able to relate to this.</v>

100
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.780
I've started a lot of shows in my life and a lot of them were radio shows and

101
00:06:27.781 --> 00:06:31.860
whatnot and the one thing you learn when you start these shows is that all you

102
00:06:31.861 --> 00:06:36.810
can do is come up with a concept and then try to take that concept where you

103
00:06:36.811 --> 00:06:40.320
think it should go initially.
And then once you do that,

104
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.720
whatever you create is going to evolve.

105
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.010
And some of that evolution is in your control and some of it isn't in your

106
00:06:47.011 --> 00:06:49.740
control.
I always say find your favorite TV series.

107
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.350
Take something like Seinfeld for example,

108
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.640
and then go look at the first five episodes and you'll notice that it's not

109
00:06:56.641 --> 00:06:58.920
really Seinfeld yet.
They haven't figured,

110
00:06:58.921 --> 00:07:01.920
it hasn't evolved into what really works and they haven't find,

111
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.050
but then eventually it finds its stride.

112
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.990
And so when you listen to our early episodes,

113
00:07:06.991 --> 00:07:09.330
they don't sound a lot like what we're doing now either.

114
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.600
And I mean length is a perfect example.

115
00:07:12.601 --> 00:07:17.601
There was a time where we were really scared of approaching an hour long program

116
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.770
and we used,
I remember one time,
it was,

117
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.720
I think it was with our Apache tears episode,

118
00:07:21.721 --> 00:07:26.000
the ones we did on the Apaches and we were approaching an hour and then I got a

119
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:29.130
finished product and it was like one hour and 15 minutes and I said,

120
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.480
we're canceling the show.

121
00:07:30.481 --> 00:07:34.920
We have to have to dial it back over an hour because no one will listen.

122
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.560
And so I think the fact that the audience had proven,

123
00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:41.400
receptive gave us a feeling that there was some freedom here to go a little

124
00:07:41.401 --> 00:07:42.720
farther and then a little farther.

125
00:07:42.721 --> 00:07:47.100
And I'm shocked that everybody can listen to it that long.
Editing it for us.

126
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.510
We dread the hearing it over and over and over again.
So,

127
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.850
so I'm really not on the same wave length with a lot of the listeners.

128
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:59.620
<v 0>Well speaking as someone who's written a 420 page book than a 592 page book and</v>

129
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:03.430
then a 670 some odd pages.

130
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:04.990
<v 2>Yeah,
same thing.</v>

131
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.990
<v 0>It really does take on a life of its own.</v>

132
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:14.460
And I'm really glad you brought up the Seinfeld example because I remember

133
00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.640
looking at say some of the,

134
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.140
the current versions of podcasts when I,
when I was considering doing my own,

135
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.990
looking at some of your newer episodes,

136
00:08:24.991 --> 00:08:28.470
looking at some of the more polished Joe Rogan episodes,

137
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.120
which are also monsters looking at uh,
many different types.

138
00:08:33.121 --> 00:08:36.810
And then someone recommended that I go back and look at say the first one or two

139
00:08:36.811 --> 00:08:41.640
episodes that Joe did on video and they're hilariously amateur.

140
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.110
I mean really,
really hilarious.
And if I hadn't done that,

141
00:08:46.111 --> 00:08:50.460
I think I would have been too intimidated to get started because I would have

142
00:08:50.461 --> 00:08:55.461
falsely assumed that the polished format that you've arrived at where you

143
00:08:55.531 --> 00:09:00.531
started and that that reflects an intrinsic ability that I entirely lack,

144
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:03.690
which could also still be true.
But what I'd,

145
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.110
I'd love to know is with hardcore history in particular,

146
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.930
and we'll talk about the podcast.
I also want to talk about history,

147
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:15.290
but were there any particular tipping points that that helped you start to form

148
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.270
it into what it is now?
And I'm sure it's still evolving,
but were,

149
00:09:19.271 --> 00:09:22.470
were there any particular tipping points,
whether it was in popularity,

150
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:27.060
specific episodes,
Aha moments that come to mind for you?

151
00:09:27.061 --> 00:09:28.560
Content or format wise?

152
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.620
<v 2>I think we had ideas when we started it,</v>

153
00:09:32.621 --> 00:09:35.380
a things we wanted to do and then a couple shows into it.

154
00:09:35.381 --> 00:09:39.700
You could start to sense that these were elements that you should have in every

155
00:09:39.701 --> 00:09:44.350
single episode.
So for example,
uh,
somewhere along the line I'd always had these,

156
00:09:44.351 --> 00:09:49.000
these sort of twilight zone kind of ideas about history.

157
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.280
And when we could start to say,
okay,

158
00:09:51.281 --> 00:09:55.960
every episode really is successful if it has some of those,
some of the drama,

159
00:09:55.961 --> 00:09:57.930
some of the narratives.
So you start to,

160
00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:01.750
to figure out what the ingredients in your creation are.

161
00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.670
And once that's the case,
then you can start to say,

162
00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.650
it's not so much a formula as a checklist and say,
okay,

163
00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.340
every good episode that we do should have a,
B,
c,
d,

164
00:10:12.341 --> 00:10:16.690
and e and I'm not sure when you start that you're totally aware of that.

165
00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.570
You're still playing around with the ingredients and the mix.
And,

166
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:20.710
and we still do that.
I mean,

167
00:10:20.711 --> 00:10:24.910
each episode's going to sound different because we want to put extra cumin in

168
00:10:24.911 --> 00:10:27.560
this one and less hot sauce in that one.
But,

169
00:10:27.561 --> 00:10:31.480
but at the same time you don't really know what's working in the first few

170
00:10:31.481 --> 00:10:34.890
episodes.
And so somewhere,
somewhere around like,
um,

171
00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.840
we did one called step stories early on,

172
00:10:37.841 --> 00:10:41.410
which is sort of a loose look at all the different people in the culture and

173
00:10:41.411 --> 00:10:44.830
history of the,
of the giant flat area,
you know,

174
00:10:44.831 --> 00:10:47.860
that starts in eastern Europe and goes almost all the way to the Pacific Ocean.

175
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.520
And we did a show like that and it was the first time I think we hit the sweet

176
00:10:51.521 --> 00:10:55.030
spot with all of those elements in it.
And when you heard it,
you just said,
okay,

177
00:10:55.031 --> 00:10:58.390
that that's significantly better than anything else we've done.

178
00:10:58.391 --> 00:10:59.890
And that's what you sit there and go,
okay,

179
00:10:59.891 --> 00:11:03.550
well w w we figured out how to do this kind of and we're going to start to not

180
00:11:03.551 --> 00:11:04.480
mass produce it,

181
00:11:04.481 --> 00:11:08.290
but we're gonna make sure that we do a better job in every later episode.

182
00:11:08.291 --> 00:11:11.440
That incorporates all these things that we think started have started to blend

183
00:11:11.441 --> 00:11:12.274
well.

184
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.760
<v 0>I am currently listening,
or I should say relistening to the wrath of the cons,</v>

185
00:11:16.761 --> 00:11:21.761
which is a a audio book or three worth of content in and of itself.

186
00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:27.220
And it seems like having pulled my being a 500,000 or so people on Twitter,

187
00:11:28.041 --> 00:11:32.990
that that is one of the most popular series,
so to speak.

188
00:11:32.991 --> 00:11:33.221
And I'm,

189
00:11:33.221 --> 00:11:38.221
I'm curious to know if there are any episodes that you thought were going to be

190
00:11:38.271 --> 00:11:43.271
a huge hit that we're not or if there are any episodes that were completely

191
00:11:43.521 --> 00:11:46.190
added,
left field.
A huge,
a huge home run.

192
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:47.160
<v 2>Well,</v>

193
00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.450
it's nice to hear you say that because I think I left a little bit of my sanity

194
00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.760
with that wrath of the con series,
and the truth is,

195
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:59.380
is that the longer multipart series where we take on some big issue and it takes

196
00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:02.680
four or six episodes hours long each,

197
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.420
and you have an audio book at the end to do,

198
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:09.340
are so challenging because you have all these loose threads that developed while

199
00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:12.550
you're doing the story,
and then by the time you hit the middle of the series,

200
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.590
you have to start tying those threads together and it becomes,
you know,

201
00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.510
I'm in one of these things now we're talking about the first world war and we're

202
00:12:19.511 --> 00:12:22.750
in episode four and all of a sudden the whole thing is unraveling in front of my

203
00:12:22.751 --> 00:12:26.290
face and it does it.
Does Tat Challenge your sanity a bit?

204
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.610
I'm always surprised when the shows are well received,

205
00:12:30.611 --> 00:12:33.670
so I don't have anywhere I was going,
oh,
this is going to be a home run.

206
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.210
I'm always sure I screwed up one way or the other.
So it's never,

207
00:12:37.211 --> 00:12:38.980
never happens that I'm sure it's a hit.

208
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.150
Oftentimes I released something and I just braced myself for what I'm sure is

209
00:12:43.151 --> 00:12:47.240
going to be this negative response,
prophets of doom,
uh,
that you like.

210
00:12:47.241 --> 00:12:50.020
I didn't think at the end where I said I earned it.
Yeah.

211
00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:52.750
It was like a disclaimer saying this didn't come out the way I want it.

212
00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:55.570
And people liked it anyway.
So that's usually what happens.

213
00:12:55.571 --> 00:12:57.380
I'm a little bit more of a perfectionist.
I,

214
00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.820
I was reading a book the other day on the rolling stones and they have this

215
00:13:00.821 --> 00:13:02.890
picture in it of their guitarist,

216
00:13:02.891 --> 00:13:07.750
Keith Richards just hanging over this audio board and you can see he's been up

217
00:13:07.751 --> 00:13:11.180
for like days and they're,
and they're unlike the hundredth taken.

218
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.590
This song in this album is overdue and the whole time,
and I thought to myself,

219
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:19.210
it's not all that different than what we're doing here.
And so,

220
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:23.020
so I'm always sure that this next show we're going to release is going to

221
00:13:23.021 --> 00:13:27.040
destroy our brand forever and that I'm never going to live up to the hype and

222
00:13:27.041 --> 00:13:31.600
that,
that,
uh,
I'm,
the sanity is,
has been left in the studio somewhere.

223
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.740
Profit to doom is a perfect example.
The Apache tears show where we,

224
00:13:35.741 --> 00:13:38.800
I think it was the first one either we were near over an hour.

225
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.050
I was sure people were going to freak out about that.

226
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:44.620
So pretty much every episode I release,
I'm sure that's the end we screwed up.

227
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:49.960
<v 0>And you mentioned the aspect of tying loose ends together,</v>

228
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.510
and this is something I feel very familiar with,

229
00:13:52.511 --> 00:13:57.100
just having put together books with multiple storylines and dozens of different

230
00:13:57.101 --> 00:14:00.100
components.
However,
with the printed word,

231
00:14:00.101 --> 00:14:04.510
I have the luxury of being able to go back,
copy and paste,
cut out sections,

232
00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.450
translate them to other areas.
But with audio,

233
00:14:07.451 --> 00:14:11.860
after you've recorded say two,
three episodes,

234
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:13.420
you really have to work with,

235
00:14:13.421 --> 00:14:15.670
I would imagine on some level what you've already done.

236
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:20.560
So I'd love to hear how on earth you prepare for these things,

237
00:14:20.561 --> 00:14:22.510
what the process currently looks like.

238
00:14:22.511 --> 00:14:26.200
Because when I listened to the prophets of doom and at the end,
like you said,

239
00:14:26.201 --> 00:14:30.550
the disclaimer came out where you say that it didn't really turn out the way you

240
00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:34.060
expected it to or wanted to two and that you'd,
you'd actually recorded,

241
00:14:34.061 --> 00:14:38.710
and I have to just hear it from the horses mouth here are recorded a complete

242
00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:41.290
version of that episode that you then scrapped.

243
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:46.320
I just couldn't fathom taking the time to record that and then scrap it and

244
00:14:46.691 --> 00:14:48.940
start over.
I mean it just blew my mind.

245
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.880
So could you talk a little bit about the process?
How do you research,

246
00:14:52.881 --> 00:14:56.330
how do you choose topics when you're going after an episode like this?

247
00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.210
Because it sounds very masterfully delivered.
So one of the,

248
00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.730
the thoughts that occurred to me for instance,
was how often do you stop?

249
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.360
Like how long does it take,
in other words,
and so on and so forth.

250
00:15:08.361 --> 00:15:11.810
So that I'd love for you to just discuss if you would be open to,

251
00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:16.010
it's kind of start to finish what the process looks like for putting one of

252
00:15:16.011 --> 00:15:16.850
these shows together.

253
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.090
<v 2>Well,
let me back up because you had talked about doing a book and,
and,</v>

254
00:15:20.091 --> 00:15:20.710
and there are,

255
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:24.030
there are similarities when you do these really long podcast and especially in

256
00:15:24.031 --> 00:15:28.750
these series,
we have a name for it in house,
I call it the blue room and,
and the,

257
00:15:28.751 --> 00:15:32.080
and the Blue Room is when you've heard the piece so often,

258
00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:33.820
and this happens with reading too,

259
00:15:33.821 --> 00:15:36.100
so I'm sure you have the same problem with books where you were,

260
00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:41.101
you've now seen it so often that you lose the ability to absorb it the way a new

261
00:15:41.321 --> 00:15:43.810
listener would or a new reader would definitely.

262
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:48.340
And it destroys your ability to judge what you have.

263
00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:52.450
So I mean it's the only time I get jealous of like the TV networks and stuff

264
00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:56.440
where they're able to bring in test audiences and show them something that they

265
00:15:56.441 --> 00:15:59.050
put together and just say,
okay,
so what's your reaction to this?

266
00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.990
Because they have the same problem we do.
Right?
They get the blue room,

267
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:05.470
but they have the chance to expose a few people to it and say,
okay,

268
00:16:05.471 --> 00:16:08.320
is this good when we've lost all sense of direction on this?

269
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.980
Now the bad part of that is then you can then the audience can start driving it.

270
00:16:11.981 --> 00:16:13.930
You don't want that either from a creative sense,

271
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.630
but when we hit where we are in this show now,

272
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:21.280
I haven't the slightest idea if that even make sense anymore or like you'll hear

273
00:16:21.281 --> 00:16:22.031
something and you'll go,

274
00:16:22.031 --> 00:16:26.920
this sounds remarkably similar to something I think I said seven hours ago in

275
00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.740
art too.
And so you,
you,
and like you said,

276
00:16:29.741 --> 00:16:31.750
at least it's easier to do that in the written sense,

277
00:16:31.751 --> 00:16:35.860
but the same problem exists.
So when you say,
how do you do these things?

278
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.720
The reason it gets complicated where we are now is that I have to write some of

279
00:16:40.721 --> 00:16:44.230
that stuff down and say,
no,
you talked about this already.

280
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:48.910
Don't talk about this again.
As opposed to saying what I'm going to do.

281
00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.330
And it's part of keeping the,
you know,
don't cross the streams.

282
00:16:52.331 --> 00:16:53.470
Like they said in Ghostbusters.

283
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.100
It's trying not to cross tangents and streams and,
and,

284
00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.360
and the only part that's a saving grace in the episode we're doing now is in the

285
00:17:01.361 --> 00:17:06.280
first world war,
things are repetitive and it's actually a part of the story.

286
00:17:06.281 --> 00:17:08.560
That's how people at the time felt like,
oh my God,

287
00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.590
we're still going through the same,
it's the same movie over and over again.

288
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.410
So if I make the listeners feel that way in the show,
I can,

289
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:16.270
if the cop out is going to be able to say,

290
00:17:16.271 --> 00:17:19.240
and I'm going to say it well now you feel just like the people in the story.

291
00:17:19.241 --> 00:17:23.920
So if I sound repetitive,
we were after that.
Um,
so,
so if you ask how I do it,

292
00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.270
I really do.

293
00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:30.070
I pick subjects that I already know about and then I begin the research from

294
00:17:30.071 --> 00:17:31.900
there.
Cause I always tell people,
someone will say,

295
00:17:31.901 --> 00:17:35.950
can you please talk about the history of southeast India or something?

296
00:17:35.951 --> 00:17:40.300
And I'll say,
you don't want me to talk.
I don't know anything about that.

297
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:45.310
And you can't educate yourself to a reasonable standard in the short period of

298
00:17:45.311 --> 00:17:49.710
time we have.
I have,
it's enough for me to pick a subject I know lot about.

299
00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:54.711
I know a lot about the first world war and I've read 50 books since we started

300
00:17:54.781 --> 00:17:56.220
this.
They grew on top of that.

301
00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:00.660
What's amazing to me is how much has changed since I thought I learned about

302
00:18:00.661 --> 00:18:03.300
these things.
Maybe,
maybe the 1980s I,

303
00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.720
I was really into that subject for a few years and you go back and you think,

304
00:18:06.721 --> 00:18:11.160
well there can't be that much more about this 100 year old subject since then,

305
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:12.990
you couldn't be more wrong.
Right.

306
00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:16.200
There's books and revisions and new points of view and it,
it's,
it's insane.

307
00:18:16.201 --> 00:18:21.030
So I picked these topics I already have a good foundation for and I've thrown

308
00:18:21.031 --> 00:18:22.770
away by the way you're talking about throwing away shows.

309
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:26.640
I threw away a show on the Greeks and the ancient Persians.

310
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:30.240
I think I threw away one of the Apache shows.
So I've done this before,

311
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.710
but I pick a,
something I know a bunch about and I,
I think about it.

312
00:18:34.711 --> 00:18:38.370
And this is the thing that listeners never give me any time for because

313
00:18:38.371 --> 00:18:42.330
basically I'm behind schedule what I start and the listeners are always

314
00:18:42.331 --> 00:18:43.350
wondering what I'm doing.

315
00:18:43.351 --> 00:18:47.940
But you actually have to sit down a little bit and think and just,

316
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.040
and just sit in the shower and just go,

317
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.680
what's weird about this story and what turns me,
you know?

318
00:18:52.681 --> 00:18:56.370
And that's where you come up with these weird sort of things.

319
00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:59.700
And those things are,
the pillar is we sort of build the showrunner.

320
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.760
We say it's a little like our style is a jazz like or led Zepplin used to have

321
00:19:05.371 --> 00:19:08.160
a,
a line for how they constructed their work.
They said,

322
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.360
they said our format is tight but loose and that,

323
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.190
and that's kind of how artists is.
Where,

324
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.830
where there are these mileposts that I set that I want to get to.

325
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:21.810
But within those mile posts I have all this room to sort of go off on a,
yeah.

326
00:19:21.811 --> 00:19:25.950
Guitar Solo for a long period of time or like tangents.

327
00:19:25.951 --> 00:19:29.070
If you can't stand tangents,
you can't listen to my stuff.
Cause that's,

328
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.550
I mean it's like the tangents or maybe the pillar of the show.

329
00:19:32.551 --> 00:19:34.620
We just go off on all these avenues.

330
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:38.670
You couldn't structure it if you tried to write it out that way wouldn't work.

331
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:42.970
But I think it does come across perhaps as disjointed sometimes.

332
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:47.430
Or maybe this solo has gone on too long and we need to get back to the format or

333
00:19:47.431 --> 00:19:48.600
whatever.
But I do,

334
00:19:48.601 --> 00:19:53.410
I go into the studio with kind of a concept and an approach.
I want to try to,

335
00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.650
to make work and it doesn't always work out.

336
00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.100
And I'll go in there and usually I'm,
you know,

337
00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.890
coffee used to work so much better for me in the old days,
but,

338
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.820
but I'll have a bunch of cups of coffee.

339
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.220
I'll get in there and I'll just start talking about it.

340
00:20:05.221 --> 00:20:09.390
And usually it's pretty good for a while and then it breaks down at some point

341
00:20:09.391 --> 00:20:11.250
and that's where I'll stop and then I'll,

342
00:20:11.251 --> 00:20:16.251
I'll pick up from just before it broke down the session before and we'll try to

343
00:20:16.471 --> 00:20:20.460
string something together now.
Sometimes I'll go and listen.
I'll go,
oh wow,

344
00:20:20.461 --> 00:20:23.460
we really left this part out.
Or Oh that's a,

345
00:20:23.461 --> 00:20:25.470
there's a mistake in there we have to fix.

346
00:20:25.471 --> 00:20:29.520
And so there's going back and pulling the rolling stones and the in the studio

347
00:20:29.521 --> 00:20:33.480
obsessing over,
take 99 of,
you know,
uh,
one of their songs.

348
00:20:33.481 --> 00:20:34.740
And we do some of that now too.

349
00:20:34.741 --> 00:20:38.310
And we do a lot more than we used to because when you're doing four and five

350
00:20:38.311 --> 00:20:40.950
hour episodes,
you can't keep it straight.

351
00:20:40.951 --> 00:20:45.951
So we're constantly relistening to the stuff and it's become a lot more

352
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.930
structured than it used to be.
I used to be able to walk in there and say,

353
00:20:49.931 --> 00:20:50.890
if we get lucky,

354
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.160
I'll walk out in the studio with a whole hardcore history show for you.

355
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:58.090
That doesn't happen anymore.
Um,
so,
so you go to run out of gas,

356
00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:58.990
I guess is what I'm saying.

357
00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:02.420
<v 0>And when you're planning,
let's just say a single episode,
not a series,</v>

358
00:21:02.421 --> 00:21:05.930
but a single episode that could be two to four hours in length.

359
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:11.350
How much of what I hear as a listener is scripted out is written out in long

360
00:21:12.561 --> 00:21:16.760
form.
What are your prompts?
Look like or your props so to speak,

361
00:21:16.761 --> 00:21:20.480
because I'm thinking about how I prepare for say a keynote presentation,

362
00:21:20.481 --> 00:21:22.100
a 60 minute keynote presentation.

363
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:26.540
There are cases where I'll have portions that are verbatim that I'll memorize a

364
00:21:26.541 --> 00:21:29.000
just for delivery sake,
say at the beginning and the very end.

365
00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:33.700
Then there are in some cases bullet points that I use to break say a section

366
00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:38.660
into three parts so that it's easier to rehearse as well as as nail repeatedly,

367
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:43.610
but I've been mystified trying to figure out because I'm just purely guessing

368
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:48.110
what you have in front of you when you're recording and sort of generally

369
00:21:48.111 --> 00:21:51.770
speaking,
how often you take breaks,
for instance,
say 10 minutes,
20 minutes,

370
00:21:51.771 --> 00:21:52.604
30 minutes.

371
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.480
What does that look like these days when you're doing a single episode as

372
00:21:56.481 --> 00:21:57.410
opposed to a series?

373
00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:01.320
<v 2>Well,
I hope you can tell that there is no script because there is,</v>

374
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:05.610
there is no script and that and we hope that that's why it sounds natural like

375
00:22:05.611 --> 00:22:06.444
it does.

376
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.520
<v 0>Well,
the only reason that I ask is because it's so,</v>

377
00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:14.550
it sounds so polished without the ums and Ahs and I'm accustomed to hearing for

378
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.800
almost everyone that I've ever heard in long form conversation that it just

379
00:22:22.121 --> 00:22:25.840
seemed like a super power to not have a script,
I guess.
So

380
00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.490
<v 2>that's understand that there's definitely editing going on there.
I mean,</v>

381
00:22:29.491 --> 00:22:34.350
I'm sure that we've taken out some ums and things like that before,
but I mean,

382
00:22:34.351 --> 00:22:34.681
you know,

383
00:22:34.681 --> 00:22:39.681
I did radio for a dozen years before I did podcasts and I did television before

384
00:22:40.471 --> 00:22:44.920
then.
And ums are a pretty basic thing.
You work on it.

385
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:49.670
It doesn't mean we're Umphrey,
it just means that I'm less likely to pull an um,

386
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.900
and then I might have been,
and I always said,
you know,

387
00:22:51.901 --> 00:22:55.500
we kind of had an advantage when we got into podcasting.
Well,
first of all,

388
00:22:55.501 --> 00:22:59.000
we got in so early,
it was a little like the Oklahoma Land Rush.
So it was right.

389
00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:02.100
It was nice to get in there so early and sort of claim your little zone.

390
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:07.340
But also I wasn't learning how to do proper mic technique.

391
00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:11.160
You know what,
I was starting at a little bit of an advantage.

392
00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:16.140
And so with the oms fall into that category a little bit in terms of,
um,

393
00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.940
I mean we do write down,
for example,

394
00:23:17.941 --> 00:23:21.270
if I've got a twisty idea that I want to make sure to include,

395
00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:26.010
I might write down the twisty idea and then post that up on the cork board to

396
00:23:26.011 --> 00:23:31.011
remind myself that in this 20 minute segment today you want to hit that idea.

397
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:35.280
I also find,
you know,
what you call primary source account.

398
00:23:35.281 --> 00:23:37.650
So somebody is in the first world war war and there's,

399
00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:41.130
they talk about what it's like in the trenches and I'll know that I have that

400
00:23:41.131 --> 00:23:45.800
piece.
And so I'll have a note that says,
okay,
page two 46 of this book.
You know,

401
00:23:45.801 --> 00:23:49.580
and I'll have mark that guy as quote.
And so I'll know I have that,

402
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:53.030
but I don't know exactly when I'm going to get to it.

403
00:23:53.031 --> 00:23:55.730
I just know that some were in today's session,

404
00:23:55.731 --> 00:23:59.690
you're probably gonna run into the point where it's logical to put that primary

405
00:23:59.691 --> 00:24:03.650
source quote in so that that's how I organize it.
Otherwise it's,

406
00:24:03.651 --> 00:24:07.580
it's a free form sort of improvisational talk.

407
00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:09.190
<v 0>God,
it's amazing.</v>

408
00:24:09.191 --> 00:24:12.220
I want to give people a couple of different options for places to start with

409
00:24:12.221 --> 00:24:13.930
hardcore history because it really,

410
00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:19.200
I'm seldom as impressed as I have been with the entire show,

411
00:24:19.241 --> 00:24:23.050
but stop it dude.
You're,
I know,
I know.
I'm making things awkward.

412
00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:25.850
Everybody was not of good people out there.

413
00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.640
There are a lot of good people out there,

414
00:24:27.641 --> 00:24:29.890
but I've sort of gotten stuck on hardcore history.

415
00:24:29.891 --> 00:24:32.170
So I feel like I need to satisfy that fixed first.

416
00:24:32.171 --> 00:24:35.740
But one thing I think that you do very,
very well,
and I,

417
00:24:35.741 --> 00:24:39.010
I'd like to ask you how much of this was learned over time.

418
00:24:39.011 --> 00:24:41.200
And also I'll get to the second part,

419
00:24:41.201 --> 00:24:45.670
but you do a very good job of pulling listeners into the episodes.

420
00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:50.050
And the example that jumps to mind is you might have a description,

421
00:24:50.051 --> 00:24:54.790
say in the case of wrath of the cons of some of the historical context,

422
00:24:54.791 --> 00:24:55.810
some of the,

423
00:24:56.010 --> 00:25:00.550
the various cultures and step communities in different areas.

424
00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.680
And then you'll say,
you know,
imagine if you will,

425
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:08.190
that you have an entire army comprised of circus trick archers.

426
00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:13.660
And then not only do they have Bose with the bows are 130 pound poll,

427
00:25:13.661 --> 00:25:16.330
which happens to mean more to me these days because I've been playing around

428
00:25:16.331 --> 00:25:21.010
with archery and I know how hard it is,
at least for me to repeatedly pull,

429
00:25:21.011 --> 00:25:25.900
say a 55 or 60 pound.
So the fact that they get unleashed,
you know,

430
00:25:25.901 --> 00:25:29.530
60 hours a minute or whatever it was,
but you pull people in with the,
you know,

431
00:25:29.531 --> 00:25:30.341
imagine if you were,

432
00:25:30.341 --> 00:25:32.800
and then doing hypothetical's with of course the Martians and so on,

433
00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.160
the verbal delivery that you have,
which is very polished.

434
00:25:36.161 --> 00:25:38.710
And of course you've done a lot of radio and a lot of television,

435
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:43.950
but if someone feels self conscious about their own vocal delivery and they want

436
00:25:45.071 --> 00:25:46.810
to podcast,
maybe I'm projecting here,

437
00:25:46.811 --> 00:25:51.811
but how would you suggest that people work on that skill and try to refine their

438
00:25:53.381 --> 00:25:56.530
delivery to get a little closer to what I would consider very,

439
00:25:56.531 --> 00:25:57.880
very professional in your case?

440
00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:58.760
<v 2>Well,</v>

441
00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:03.440
I appreciate you saying that because I came up in radio at a time,

442
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:08.470
the tail end of what maybe you could call the big voice era where radio was

443
00:26:09.561 --> 00:26:12.740
still,
this won't mean anything to all of the young listeners,

444
00:26:12.741 --> 00:26:15.890
but like a Gary Owens deep classical,

445
00:26:15.891 --> 00:26:19.210
almost a stereotypical old fashioned broadcast.

446
00:26:19.211 --> 00:26:23.420
Your style with the deep pipes or the way the guys used to describe their voices

447
00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.770
and when I came up,
I remember the boss at the radio station where I worked,

448
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:32.150
I mean at one time he actually suggested I have like adenoid surgery or

449
00:26:32.151 --> 00:26:32.984
something.

450
00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:37.400
Maybe get that deep voice that that was the classic that they were looking for

451
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.430
and I not only didn't have that,
I didn't want that.

452
00:26:40.431 --> 00:26:44.010
I just wanted to talk the way I talk.
And then somewhere while I was doing that,

453
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:48.270
that whole deep voice thing went out of fashion and everybody was more looking

454
00:26:48.271 --> 00:26:51.600
for a unique,
you were looking for your own voice,
right?

455
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.870
A unique voice that sounded like no one else.

456
00:26:54.871 --> 00:26:57.030
And luckily just having your own voice,

457
00:26:57.031 --> 00:27:00.030
as long as it didn't great like nails on a blackboard,

458
00:27:00.031 --> 00:27:03.690
which some people said mine did.
So it's,
it's an acquired taste maybe.

459
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:08.460
But having your own voice became the real preferred format and all of a sudden

460
00:27:08.461 --> 00:27:10.950
everybody is saying,
gosh,
it's so great you have your own voice.

461
00:27:10.951 --> 00:27:13.680
And all I'm thinking about is all those years that that was the one thing

462
00:27:13.681 --> 00:27:16.770
everybody didn't want me to have.
So when you say to a listener,

463
00:27:16.771 --> 00:27:20.850
how do you get more polished and broadcasts or like there's a process you're

464
00:27:20.851 --> 00:27:23.610
going to go through if you start podcasting or whatever,

465
00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:27.600
where you figure out what your voice is and it shouldn't be something fake.

466
00:27:27.601 --> 00:27:29.340
It should be your voice.

467
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.720
But maybe you take it down a range maybe because we've all got a vocal range

468
00:27:33.721 --> 00:27:36.810
right from the highest.
You speak to the lowest you speak.

469
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:40.440
There may be a sweet spot in there and it might not be the way you always talk

470
00:27:40.441 --> 00:27:43.110
are you or you might want to talk in that in that tone more.

471
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:48.410
I think personally that there is no perfect voice and I think that that as long

472
00:27:48.511 --> 00:27:52.800
as as you like it and you sound the way you want to sound that that's,

473
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:54.210
especially in this world,

474
00:27:54.211 --> 00:27:59.211
I mean what I love about the podcast and the the Internet is that there's so

475
00:27:59.251 --> 00:28:03.810
many potential people out there listening that if you just be yourself,

476
00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:09.050
you're going to attract listeners who like that and then you never have to fool

477
00:28:09.091 --> 00:28:11.980
around with trying to be someone else to please your audience because the people

478
00:28:11.981 --> 00:28:15.420
that you've attracted are there because they like you are ready.
Right?

479
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:19.290
I don't think you should try to develop some style other than just Polish your

480
00:28:19.291 --> 00:28:23.880
own style.
The oms are a perfect example,
but listen,
I bet if you wanted to,

481
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:28.920
you could weave that into your style where that's almost your thing,
right?

482
00:28:28.921 --> 00:28:29.490
I mean,

483
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:34.170
we talk around here a lot about turning negatives into positives or lemons into

484
00:28:34.171 --> 00:28:38.250
lemonade or creatively taking a weak spot and making it a strong spot.

485
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.700
I always was heavily in the red as they say,

486
00:28:41.701 --> 00:28:46.470
when I was on the radio where I yelled so loud and I still do that.

487
00:28:46.471 --> 00:28:49.320
The meter just jumps up into the red and they would say,
you need,

488
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:53.240
you need to speak in this one zone of of loudness or you'll screw up the,

489
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.530
the radio stations compression.
Well,

490
00:28:55.531 --> 00:28:59.480
after a while I just started writing liners for the big voice guidance.
You know,

491
00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:03.660
here's Dan Carlin.
He talks so loud or whatever.
I said,

492
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:07.850
this is who am I?
That's my style.
I meant to do that.
And it's a matter of fact.
I,

493
00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.080
if you do it,
you're imitating me.
So,

494
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:14.760
so it's the hardly partly taking what you already do and saying,
no,
no,
no,

495
00:29:14.761 --> 00:29:18.840
this isn't a negative.
This is the thing I bring to the table buddy.
Right?

496
00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:23.820
You know,
I copyrighted that.
I talk real loud and then I talked really quietly.

497
00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:25.290
And if you have a problem with that,

498
00:29:25.291 --> 00:29:30.000
well you don't understand what a good style is.
Tim.
I like that.

499
00:29:30.001 --> 00:29:33.690
I will.
I will.
I think I shall capitalize on this hobby,
right?
Your faults,

500
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:40.470
you reminded me of actually an experience that I had with writing the four hour

501
00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:42.040
workweek.
What was my first book?
I

502
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.280
<v 0>was very nervous about it and when I first started,</v>

503
00:29:45.281 --> 00:29:47.020
and I'm not sure how many people know this,

504
00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:50.740
I wrote the first four or five chapters and ended throwing them all out because

505
00:29:50.741 --> 00:29:54.910
I was writing in this very pompous sort of Ivy League style that I thought

506
00:29:54.911 --> 00:29:58.040
sounded very smart and it came off stilted and it just,
it,

507
00:29:58.050 --> 00:29:59.380
it was very unattractive.

508
00:29:59.381 --> 00:30:03.760
So I tossed it and then I tried to write an amusing fashion.

509
00:30:03.761 --> 00:30:06.460
I thought I needed to be funny.
So I was like,
all right,
I'll,
I'll be funny.

510
00:30:06.461 --> 00:30:11.170
I should stop being so serious.
And it came across very slapstick.
Three stooges.

511
00:30:11.171 --> 00:30:12.130
So yet again,

512
00:30:12.131 --> 00:30:17.131
I had to take these four or five chapters that I'd spent weeks on and throw them

513
00:30:17.351 --> 00:30:20.710
out and ultimately found my own voice,

514
00:30:20.711 --> 00:30:24.670
which was really just discovering something that was latent and that people felt

515
00:30:24.671 --> 00:30:27.530
in conversation by having two glasses of wine and,

516
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:31.180
and starting to write as if it were an email to two specific friends.

517
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:35.410
And that is when I finally found the proper balance,

518
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:40.470
which was intrinsically how I spoke to my close friends about serious subjects.

519
00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:42.570
Uh,
after a couple of glasses,

520
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:46.800
one was there a point and also brings to mind a,
there's a,

521
00:30:46.801 --> 00:30:50.680
a friend of mine named Gary Vaynerchuk who became well known after doing

522
00:30:50.681 --> 00:30:52.390
something called Wine Library TV.

523
00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.950
And if you look at the very first say 10 episodes,
especially the first few,

524
00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:00.690
he's really subdued and you learn later,
of course he,

525
00:31:00.691 --> 00:31:05.691
he sort of grown into himself and he has a very bombastic style,

526
00:31:06.251 --> 00:31:09.040
but that's who Gary is.
But it took them a long time to get there.

527
00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.440
And were there any sort of,
uh,

528
00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:15.190
points for you aside from embracing this,
uh,

529
00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:19.870
this extremely flexible vocal range that you talked about where you kind of got

530
00:31:19.871 --> 00:31:24.871
comfortable in your own shoes and we're able to not no longer conform to other

531
00:31:25.511 --> 00:31:29.860
expectations people had of what a good say radio host was or podcaster?

532
00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:34.100
<v 2>Well,
if you go listen to even my earlier podcast,</v>

533
00:31:34.101 --> 00:31:38.960
the one thing you're going to notice is I talked faster,
I was louder,

534
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:43.280
I was more aggressive and all,
and people go and listen to it now and go,
God,

535
00:31:43.281 --> 00:31:47.300
when did you slow down?
Or I'm glad you slowed down or something like that.

536
00:31:47.301 --> 00:31:49.820
And I always say,
but it wasn't,
it wasn't intentional.

537
00:31:49.821 --> 00:31:53.990
I just got older and the coffee doesn't work as well.
And yet,

538
00:31:53.991 --> 00:31:58.820
and yet it slowed me down to a level that more people are comfortable with and

539
00:31:58.821 --> 00:32:01.670
the way I used to be.
But it wasn't intentional.
I mean,

540
00:32:01.671 --> 00:32:06.110
I would've been perfectly happy attracting whatever audience liked that style

541
00:32:06.111 --> 00:32:09.830
more.
But I think there's a natural aging,
and I mean,

542
00:32:09.831 --> 00:32:14.030
I think you hear it with singers or anyone else where the style doesn't change

543
00:32:14.031 --> 00:32:17.120
because the singer doesn't like singing the way that they used to sing.

544
00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.600
They just,
their voices different and their energy is different.

545
00:32:20.601 --> 00:32:24.410
And Luckily for me,
me getting older and slower and,

546
00:32:24.411 --> 00:32:27.950
and Mellower is easier on more listeners I guess,

547
00:32:27.951 --> 00:32:29.870
than the style I had when I was younger.

548
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.870
And I'll tell you what I missed as I get older,
you know,

549
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.680
I've gotten to the age now where where sometimes I'll reach for some fact or

550
00:32:36.681 --> 00:32:41.681
something that's in my memory banks and it longer to get than it used to.

551
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:45.860
In the old days,
I was so fast and it wasn't just vocally,
it was,

552
00:32:45.861 --> 00:32:49.520
it was indicative of how fast my brain was working in my mouth,

553
00:32:49.521 --> 00:32:52.790
was trying to keep up with my brain and now my brain has slowed down.

554
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:57.200
And so I feel like an athlete who's past their prime,
right?

555
00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.840
Who's who say I used to be able to run a four,

556
00:32:59.841 --> 00:33:04.460
three 40 man and now I can't do it anymore.
But the people like it slower.

557
00:33:04.461 --> 00:33:05.450
So in a funny way,

558
00:33:05.451 --> 00:33:09.350
I've aged to a point where more people are comfortable listening to my

559
00:33:09.351 --> 00:33:11.830
middle-age style than they weren't listening to me when,

560
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:16.070
when they used to call me the angry young wolf back on,
if you can believe that.

561
00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.910
<v 0>Yeah.
So it could be worse,
could be worse.</v>

562
00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.040
That was one of the better nicknames until he gets a lot worse.

563
00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:23.510
A lot worse than that.

564
00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:29.030
So who are some of your favorite podcasters or radio personalities or people on

565
00:33:29.631 --> 00:33:30.141
audio?

566
00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:33.830
I guess what I'd love to know are people who have inspired you or people you

567
00:33:33.831 --> 00:33:36.890
admire in the audio medium as it were.

568
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:40.010
They could be living dead current,

569
00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.500
up and coming really doesn't matter.

570
00:33:42.501 --> 00:33:47.000
But I'd be curious to know who you have looked up to or admire in that world.

571
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:47.621
<v 2>Well,</v>

572
00:33:47.621 --> 00:33:51.880
I appreciate you saying living dead long because here's the dirty little secret

573
00:33:51.881 --> 00:33:54.370
of my life and it's very hard to explain to people.

574
00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:59.320
I do not consume much media anymore.
That is not text based.

575
00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:03.790
So people will say,
have you seen this show or have you seen this movie?

576
00:34:03.791 --> 00:34:07.960
Or have you listened to this podcast?
And I can almost say with 100% certainty,

577
00:34:07.961 --> 00:34:10.120
no,
and it's going to get me into trouble.

578
00:34:10.121 --> 00:34:14.980
I tell other people I'm going to rip off some well known movie or TV show theme

579
00:34:14.981 --> 00:34:18.400
or something someday without knowing that I've ripped it off.
You know,

580
00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.530
I almost did once I did this thing once where I,

581
00:34:20.531 --> 00:34:24.130
I had this break comparison for this one episode we did and somebody who

582
00:34:24.131 --> 00:34:27.040
listened to it before I released it,
thank goodness,
had to tell me that.

583
00:34:27.041 --> 00:34:30.100
I was just giving the listeners the plot of Avatar,
which was,

584
00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:33.910
which was the big movie out then that I hadn't seen and I thought that's a great

585
00:34:33.911 --> 00:34:36.730
way to stumble into a copyright infringement or look like you're ripping

586
00:34:36.731 --> 00:34:37.564
somebody off.

587
00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:42.580
So I haven't really consumed media in a long time and it's not on purpose.

588
00:34:42.581 --> 00:34:45.880
I just,
I'm not in a place in my life where I have that kind of time right now.

589
00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:49.690
But of course we were all influenced by people I had 'em in the same way you

590
00:34:49.691 --> 00:34:51.590
were talking about how much you're,
you're,
you know,

591
00:34:51.650 --> 00:34:54.820
you like interviewing me while I like interviewing people and I like to

592
00:34:54.821 --> 00:34:57.400
interview James Burke and we did it in a show,

593
00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:00.670
the guy who was the famous host of the connections series,

594
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:06.510
the day the universe changed in an Irish guy and as someone with a Irish genes

595
00:35:06.791 --> 00:35:11.500
myself had I admired Burke from a long time ago and the way has wonderful mind

596
00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:15.970
thought and the way he would,
he would string ideas together.
And so for me,

597
00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:17.290
it'll Gwynne Dyer.

598
00:35:17.291 --> 00:35:20.470
We had Gwynne Dyer on the program with a Canadian journalist who did a wonderful

599
00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:25.540
series when I was growing up on war.
That got me where I live somewhere deeply.

600
00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:28.420
You know,
I,
I was an old,
um,
when I was a TV reporter,

601
00:35:28.421 --> 00:35:31.390
I was on a CBS affiliate and at CBS,
the,

602
00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:35.110
the soul of Edward r Murrow sort of runs deep.

603
00:35:35.111 --> 00:35:38.880
And so those of us who were serious reporting,
which was not all of us,

604
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:43.290
took a real,
I mean that that was a really important thing for people,

605
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:47.310
especially of a tradition history minded kind of thing to look up to and to

606
00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:47.851
shoot for.

607
00:35:47.851 --> 00:35:51.360
I mean you know sometimes you aspire to be things that you know you can never

608
00:35:51.361 --> 00:35:52.320
quite achieve,

609
00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:57.360
but the attempt to reach those heights even if you fall short is a good goal to

610
00:35:57.361 --> 00:36:00.420
set.
And so those are the kinds of people that I look up to.

611
00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.520
And I think a lot of times when we're doing,

612
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:04.350
especially the hardcore history podcast,

613
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:09.570
you look at people like Orson wells and people who were involved in audio when

614
00:36:09.571 --> 00:36:14.430
audio was the main medium and say that those people did a lot of things that we

615
00:36:14.431 --> 00:36:18.990
could recreate.
Again,
when you talk about like a theater of the mind approach,

616
00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:23.160
the little known fact we used to do theater of the mind stuff on the older

617
00:36:23.161 --> 00:36:26.510
history shows and if you listen really carefully with,

618
00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:29.490
it's crazy cause we put this immense amount of effort.

619
00:36:29.491 --> 00:36:34.491
It's hard to even describe how much effort basically composing an audio score

620
00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.110
for these episodes.

621
00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:41.460
But we wanted to make it optional so that you didn't have to hear the score if

622
00:36:41.461 --> 00:36:43.740
you didn't want to.
So we made,
so we,

623
00:36:43.741 --> 00:36:45.930
cause we didn't know if it was a plus or a minus,

624
00:36:45.931 --> 00:36:48.360
and we thought it might be a plus to the people who liked it,

625
00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.830
but a minus to the people who didn't.

626
00:36:49.831 --> 00:36:53.670
So we made it so quiet that you literally have to,

627
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:58.410
I have to sit in a room and put your headphones on and crank it up and get into

628
00:36:58.411 --> 00:37:02.760
it.
We have candles on or whatever the listeners do and then you can enjoy it.

629
00:37:02.761 --> 00:37:05.580
But if you're in your car or on the bus or what,
you won't hear it.

630
00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.120
And people love that.
It was all theater of the mind.
And I,
I,

631
00:37:09.121 --> 00:37:12.900
that's the way I loved it too.
I mean,
if I could do it anyway,
again,

632
00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:16.410
I would throw the theater and the optional theater of the mind stuff back in it.

633
00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:21.090
But it was like doing an episode after you'd already finished an episode.

634
00:37:21.091 --> 00:37:26.091
I mean we'd have to do the show and then score the show and it just at a certain

635
00:37:26.341 --> 00:37:27.570
point in order to free up,

636
00:37:27.571 --> 00:37:31.140
I mean we already weren't getting shows out fast enough.
We had to drop that.

637
00:37:31.141 --> 00:37:33.690
But if I could ever do it the way I want to,

638
00:37:33.691 --> 00:37:38.580
again I would go back to scoring the shows with sound effects and little hums

639
00:37:38.581 --> 00:37:41.880
and drones and because we've got a whole,
I mean you can go back and listen.

640
00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.530
A bunch of our shows have all these,

641
00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:47.280
it's not quite put on the wizard of Oz at the same time.

642
00:37:47.281 --> 00:37:50.190
We start the podcast and you'll follow along.
But there's,

643
00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:53.250
we do a lot of fun stuff that I miss.
I mean in bubonic nukes,

644
00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:55.770
the one we did on the black plague,

645
00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:59.880
my favorite part of that whole episode is at the very end.

646
00:37:59.881 --> 00:38:04.610
We're talking about how you may think that this is a long time ago,
but you know,

647
00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.030
it might not be as long as you think.

648
00:38:06.031 --> 00:38:11.010
And then we have the sound really quiet in the background of a laboratory beaker

649
00:38:11.011 --> 00:38:15.240
dropping.
And then you hear a here,
a red alert alarm going off like,

650
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:19.200
like you just,
the CDC lost a flu virus or something.

651
00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:24.410
And so I used to love the potential of throwing in the Orson Welles theater of

652
00:38:24.631 --> 00:38:29.100
the mind type stuff.
And so when I look back on,
on the greats of the past,

653
00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:29.911
at this point,

654
00:38:29.911 --> 00:38:33.780
I'm almost looking back on them the way led Zeppelin looked at blues men that

655
00:38:33.781 --> 00:38:34.770
they could rip off.

656
00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:38.890
I'm going to try to find little techniques they can steal that they used to do.

657
00:38:38.891 --> 00:38:40.210
But,
but yeah,
so I mean,

658
00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:43.870
I wouldn't say that there are specific individuals as much as,
oh my gosh,

659
00:38:43.871 --> 00:38:48.400
that's a great show or that's a great idea.
So I'm not listening to a great song.

660
00:38:48.401 --> 00:38:50.080
I'm listening to a great riff and going,
Oh,

661
00:38:50.081 --> 00:38:53.870
I love that little drum beat right in there.
I could rip that off.
Or you know,
so,

662
00:38:53.871 --> 00:38:55.150
so,
so right now that,

663
00:38:55.151 --> 00:38:58.860
that's more influential to me than any particular broadcast.
But yeah,
I,

664
00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:01.060
I loved so much growing up.
Obviously

665
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:06.820
<v 0>you mentioned text.
I am a really avid reader.
I love books,
always have,</v>

666
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:10.210
and it's clear that you do a ton of research for these shows.

667
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.250
A couple of questions related to books.

668
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:16.780
What is the book that you've given most as a gift to other people?

669
00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:20.840
<v 2>Oh my goodness.
Or books,
you know,
I have to tell you the truth.</v>

670
00:39:20.841 --> 00:39:23.300
I don't do that either.
And people say to me all the time,

671
00:39:23.301 --> 00:39:25.880
can you recommend a book for a,
B or c?

672
00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:30.680
And I rarely do because I'm not reading general stuff.

673
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:35.420
A lot of times I'm reading really weird sort of books that would like,

674
00:39:35.421 --> 00:39:37.880
like you get into this world war one subject that I meant to you now.

675
00:39:37.881 --> 00:39:41.150
So then you're finding these weird little things that aren't gonna mean anything

676
00:39:41.151 --> 00:39:44.540
to someone unless they've read some of the other books that I read before that.

677
00:39:44.541 --> 00:39:48.350
So my stuff is not really useful to people.
I'm trying to think what,

678
00:39:48.351 --> 00:39:52.100
if anything I gave to and I've really horrible gift giver to Tim.

679
00:39:52.101 --> 00:39:56.060
Thanks for exposing all of my weaknesses here publicly.
That's what,

680
00:39:56.061 --> 00:39:59.910
that's why my wife is so fantastic.
A gift giving.
She makes up for me.
Um,

681
00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:01.880
I'm going to have to pass on that.

682
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:06.960
<v 0>Okay.
No problem.
The answer.
All right.
No problem.
Gift Giver.
That's my answer.</v>

683
00:40:06.961 --> 00:40:10.120
I would give,
give her,
are there any,
all right,
let's take a different tech.

684
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:13.240
Do you have any favorite documentaries or movies?

685
00:40:13.241 --> 00:40:15.970
I know you don't consume a lot of media these days,

686
00:40:15.971 --> 00:40:20.080
but what I'm trying to figure out is what,
and maybe this is a separate question,

687
00:40:20.081 --> 00:40:24.940
but what made you so fascinated in history,
and I know you've studied it before,

688
00:40:24.941 --> 00:40:28.540
but for a lot of people they take the,
the viewpoint that,
well,

689
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:33.220
histories in the past,
I don't feel like getting into esoteric aspects of,

690
00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:38.020
of old civilizations when I should be focusing on ABC theory.
Of course,

691
00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:40.260
there's a lot of practicality I think in,
in,
uh,

692
00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:43.420
in studying quite a bit of history,
which tends to repeat itself.

693
00:40:43.421 --> 00:40:46.930
But I'm trying to identify for someone who is not,

694
00:40:46.931 --> 00:40:49.060
aside from listening to the podcast of course,

695
00:40:49.061 --> 00:40:53.980
which I think is the easiest answer to get someone hooked on history,

696
00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:57.580
even indirectly.
Are there any documentaries,
movies,
books,

697
00:40:57.581 --> 00:40:58.750
anything that come to mind?

698
00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:03.350
That's a bunch of different questions that was loaded.

699
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:08.320
<v 2>Let me take them one at a time.
Um,
some of the movies that I enjoy watching,</v>

700
00:41:08.321 --> 00:41:12.430
it's so perverse and to bring them up because they're,
they're not good movies.

701
00:41:12.431 --> 00:41:15.730
A lot of times,
like for example,
I tell my wife,

702
00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:19.330
if it has time travel in it,
I'm likely to watch it.

703
00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.410
Whether or not I have any interest in,
I mean that's what gets me forget about,

704
00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.770
oh,
this is a great film.
I have to,
I'll give you a perfect example.

705
00:41:26.771 --> 00:41:27.580
There was a movie,

706
00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:31.840
I think they did it in late 1970s or maybe 1980 I think it came out called the

707
00:41:31.841 --> 00:41:35.840
final countdown.
And it's relatively horrible as the movie goes,

708
00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:36.920
but it doesn't matter.

709
00:41:36.921 --> 00:41:41.921
The story is about what if a modern aircraft carrier went back to the eve of the

710
00:41:42.741 --> 00:41:44.920
Pearl Harbor attack and,

711
00:41:44.921 --> 00:41:48.980
and so it's taking on Japanese zeroes with modern airplanes and forget it.

712
00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:52.970
The story can suck.
No,
I man,
right.
That's all I need.

713
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:56.080
The acting can be Tara.
I don't care.
See,
so,
so,

714
00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:59.540
so that's a perfect example of a movie that we grabbed me just,
okay,

715
00:41:59.541 --> 00:42:01.340
conceptually I'm all in.

716
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:06.410
You don't even have to execute it and lizard with our podcast.
I mean,

717
00:42:06.411 --> 00:42:07.850
we kind of go there sometimes too.

718
00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.990
Hopefully these twists or enough to disguise the fact maybe we didn't tie this

719
00:42:11.991 --> 00:42:15.740
other thought together so well or,
or,
or I go off on too many tangents.

720
00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.630
The other point about you're,

721
00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:22.760
I think you're striving to try to find how the history bug got started in me and

722
00:42:23.331 --> 00:42:26.120
I think we've been trying to figure that out in my family forever.

723
00:42:26.121 --> 00:42:31.121
My Mother's concept is that I was somehow born with it because I was into it.

724
00:42:31.641 --> 00:42:32.760
It's such a,
you know,
I mean you,

725
00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:37.540
you could give me history related things at Christmas when I'm four and I'm into

726
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:39.290
it and there's no explanation.

727
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:44.180
I just think you have to suggest that a lot of us are hardwired to like this or

728
00:42:44.181 --> 00:42:46.350
that.
And in my case,
you know,

729
00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.190
I mean some people you give a musical instrument too,
and Oh my God,

730
00:42:49.191 --> 00:42:52.910
they're four years old and they're playing like a teenager.
For me it was,

731
00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:55.550
it was stuff from the past and,
and I don't know,

732
00:42:55.551 --> 00:42:58.290
but I've been into it since I was very little,
which is,
it's so,

733
00:42:58.291 --> 00:43:03.020
it's so weird to me to be able to make a living doing something.

734
00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:06.410
That's what I mean.
When I,
when we started this conversation,
I said,
you know,

735
00:43:06.411 --> 00:43:10.760
I've really been fortunate to fall into something that you almost seem to have

736
00:43:10.761 --> 00:43:14.180
been born to do.
And I don't know how I got so lucky,

737
00:43:14.181 --> 00:43:17.780
but everybody should have this feeling,
you know,
to feel like,
God,

738
00:43:17.781 --> 00:43:20.360
I eye catching a football.
It's just,
I've been doing it since I was two.

739
00:43:20.361 --> 00:43:23.930
It's the thing I do best in life and somebody gave me a job catching a football.

740
00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:27.350
So I mean,
that's how I feel that,
that there's a little bit,
you know,

741
00:43:27.351 --> 00:43:29.390
when you talk about being born to something,

742
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:33.710
I guess what I do is storytelling because that's what people tell me.
I do.

743
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:37.700
I think there's a storytelling gene and you know,
and I think,

744
00:43:37.701 --> 00:43:39.830
I think it runs in families.

745
00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:44.840
I think the Irish people in my family could tell a hell of a story long before I

746
00:43:44.841 --> 00:43:48.470
was on this planet.
And if you're lucky,
you get some of that.

747
00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:51.840
And so I think there's a bunch of those elements that just work in,

748
00:43:51.841 --> 00:43:54.860
in our favor and we're,
and we're taking our strengths and running with them.

749
00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:57.770
And so when you talk about how you put a podcast together,

750
00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:01.040
one of the things I would suggest that people do is build it around what you do

751
00:44:01.041 --> 00:44:02.810
well,
you know,
and,
and so,

752
00:44:02.811 --> 00:44:07.811
and so I feel like I'm just utilizing whatever talents I was born with and it's

753
00:44:08.721 --> 00:44:09.291
working out.

754
00:44:09.291 --> 00:44:13.310
I mean that I can do this instead of working on the assembly line is one of the

755
00:44:13.311 --> 00:44:16.970
great gifts in my life.
You know,
it seems,
and please correct me if I'm wrong,

756
00:44:16.971 --> 00:44:20.660
that that hardcore history at least has existed since 2006 is that right?

757
00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:24.410
You might know better than I do something along those.
Someone.

758
00:44:24.411 --> 00:44:28.460
I think the other podcast is 2005 and hardcore history come sometime after that.

759
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:32.070
Right.
So this,
like you said,
you've,
you've been in

760
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.260
<v 0>this game,
we're in this medium for some time.</v>

761
00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:38.730
When did it occur to you that you might be able to do this full time?

762
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:41.820
When did that transition take place and when?

763
00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:45.330
Was there a particular moment that stands out to you when you realized that

764
00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:49.320
people have been telling me for a long time that we could do this?

765
00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.300
Long before I thought we could do this,

766
00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.740
<v 2>I had a guy hire me,
a tech guy,</v>

767
00:44:53.741 --> 00:44:58.720
hire me back in 96 off the radio to do our show on the Internet.

768
00:44:58.721 --> 00:45:01.950
And I look at him like he was crazy because I didn't because,

769
00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:06.850
well one the Internet wasn't,
that wasn't that
there wasn't,

770
00:45:06.851 --> 00:45:09.880
the mechanisms didn't exist.
And he said,
well,
that's what my company,
we'll do.

771
00:45:09.881 --> 00:45:14.200
We'll invent the mechanisms to do this.
And you'll be like the test case,
right?

772
00:45:14.201 --> 00:45:16.990
You'll show people,
uh,
it never went anywhere.

773
00:45:16.991 --> 00:45:21.220
But ever since then the discussion of how do we put Dan on the Internet has been

774
00:45:21.221 --> 00:45:24.580
going on amongst people that I just had to trust knew better than I did about

775
00:45:24.581 --> 00:45:25.414
that.
Um,

776
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:29.650
and the implication always was that you would have more listeners,

777
00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:32.580
cause I was always,
I always say I was,
I was the,

778
00:45:32.581 --> 00:45:37.180
the messed up part of the radio stations Dave part whenever I was on because I

779
00:45:37.181 --> 00:45:38.830
just was a Martian,
I never fit.

780
00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.080
I mean I'm apparently it was good enough to stay employed,

781
00:45:41.081 --> 00:45:43.900
but I never fit with the programming.
And so,

782
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:46.600
so the attitude was that's what the Internet's for.

783
00:45:46.601 --> 00:45:50.530
You'll be able to reach this mass of people that are above and beyond your

784
00:45:50.531 --> 00:45:54.400
normal talk radio show demographic.
And that turned out to be true.

785
00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.730
But the implication was that if you had a bunch of listeners,

786
00:45:58.150 --> 00:46:01.780
you'd be an idiot not to be able to figure out one way or another how to get,

787
00:46:01.781 --> 00:46:06.040
how to make money off of that.
For me,
what saved me was the listeners.

788
00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:07.590
They treated,

789
00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:11.110
I mean I went to a bunch of people before we started asking for donations.

790
00:46:11.111 --> 00:46:15.040
We had done the show for years before we asked for any donations or any money or

791
00:46:15.041 --> 00:46:15.790
anything.

792
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:19.090
And I went to a bunch of experts I trust in business and law and a bunch of

793
00:46:19.091 --> 00:46:21.490
other areas and I solicited their advice and said,

794
00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:25.780
if we ask the listeners to donate to this,
will that work?

795
00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:30.600
And every single one of them said,
not a chance in hell.
Really,

796
00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:35.140
really intelligent,
smart people.
And I,
and I was dissuaded and I thought,

797
00:46:35.141 --> 00:46:39.100
oh my goodness,
all these people are.
And we thought,
well,
let's just do it anyway.

798
00:46:39.101 --> 00:46:42.550
What are you going to lose?
We're just asking the listeners if,
if you,

799
00:46:42.551 --> 00:46:45.910
if you think what you heard was worth a dollar,
give us the dollar.

800
00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:50.650
Save up so you have five and then give us five,
whatever.
And Oh my gosh,

801
00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:52.120
that's changed our lives.

802
00:46:52.121 --> 00:46:55.000
And so when I talk about how fortunate I feel to be doing this,

803
00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:59.680
let's not forget who I owe for this.
A bunch of people who didn't have to pay,

804
00:46:59.681 --> 00:47:02.890
we give them away for free.
They didn't have to do this.
I mean,

805
00:47:02.891 --> 00:47:06.910
it's like what Radiohead did when they put that song out on the Internet instead

806
00:47:06.911 --> 00:47:10.240
of instead of putting it on the radio or selling it as a CD and saying,

807
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:13.600
just give us what you think it's worth.
And it worked out better.

808
00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.480
Now I don't know if this is sustainable,
right?

809
00:47:16.481 --> 00:47:19.210
I don't know if this is a flash in the pan or whatever,

810
00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:24.480
but at the moment what people have done is make possible professional and mature

811
00:47:25.571 --> 00:47:28.420
media.
I know that sounds like a contradiction in terms,

812
00:47:28.421 --> 00:47:33.421
but that's what we and and so I owe a lot of people out there listening to your

813
00:47:34.181 --> 00:47:39.181
show in mine and lots of other podcasts for giving me this blessing that I do

814
00:47:39.401 --> 00:47:42.010
and I mean I talk about it too much.
I'm sure it gets old,

815
00:47:42.011 --> 00:47:45.520
but I wake up in the middle of the night and just say thank you.
You know,

816
00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:46.510
it's crazy to me.

817
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:50.480
<v 0>I'm going to tone down my over the top praise.
But I mean it's,</v>

818
00:47:50.481 --> 00:47:52.250
it's very clear that you put a lot of effort,

819
00:47:52.251 --> 00:47:54.830
a ton of effort in prep into the episodes,

820
00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:58.220
which I think is part of the reason why people are so willing to donate.

821
00:47:58.221 --> 00:48:01.220
For instance,
what has been the most popular episode to date?

822
00:48:01.221 --> 00:48:03.440
If you had to guess or popular episodes

823
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:08.400
<v 2>they say in history,
like if you're,
the history channel for example,</v>

824
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:12.840
that the subject that people get the most excited about is the second world war

825
00:48:12.841 --> 00:48:16.110
and that's why I think they did it to death on the history channel and stuff

826
00:48:16.111 --> 00:48:20.160
like that because it's almost something you have to screw up to not do well
with.

827
00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:25.640
The only real time that we've touched that subject dead on is when we talked

828
00:48:26.131 --> 00:48:29.580
about in a multipart series,
the eastern front in the Second World War,

829
00:48:29.581 --> 00:48:32.610
so basically the war between the Germans and the Soviet Union.

830
00:48:32.611 --> 00:48:35.700
Although there are a lot of other people involved,
most Americans,

831
00:48:35.701 --> 00:48:40.140
and I didn't realize this actually don't know much about that because they hear

832
00:48:40.141 --> 00:48:45.000
so much about the stuff that our side was involved with that to them as a part

833
00:48:45.001 --> 00:48:48.450
of the war that that essentially gave us the advantage of stuff.

834
00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:51.870
Taking that subject.
That's gold,
right?
Second World War.

835
00:48:51.871 --> 00:48:55.320
It's history gold and yet a part of it that people weren't aware of.

836
00:48:55.321 --> 00:48:58.020
So it's like finding new world war two stuff.

837
00:48:58.830 --> 00:49:01.500
I mean it's give you the history channel and go guess what all this World War

838
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:03.440
Two stuff you haven't explored yet.
I mean all my,

839
00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:05.820
it's like finding gold and so we,

840
00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:10.630
we told this story and people love it.
This is the ghost of the oss friends.

841
00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:14.250
So of the oss from,
yeah,
lost friend is the German word for eastern front.

842
00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:17.100
You know,
if you took,
and we,
I think we said this in the show,

843
00:49:17.101 --> 00:49:19.410
I can't remember what we said yesterday much this what we said that,

844
00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:24.390
but if you take just the eastern front of the Second World War and isolate that

845
00:49:24.391 --> 00:49:25.560
as its own war,

846
00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:29.640
it by itself is the biggest war in human history all by itself.

847
00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:34.110
And so I think the stories that come out of that and the horrific newness and

848
00:49:34.111 --> 00:49:38.610
the feeling of the people who must have been trapped in that dynamic are such

849
00:49:38.611 --> 00:49:42.300
that people listen to it and I think can really relate.
And,
and again,
having,

850
00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:46.620
having a new World War II subject,
especially one that's so big,
I mean,

851
00:49:46.621 --> 00:49:47.251
when you hear that,

852
00:49:47.251 --> 00:49:51.330
you really understand that the war was probably won or lost on the eastern
front.

853
00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:55.200
And so I think it had all the elements right there to be a really popular

854
00:49:55.201 --> 00:49:57.860
episode.
If I don't screw it up right,
uh,

855
00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:02.460
it doesn't seem like you did the w what,
what episode did you have?

856
00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:05.780
I know how stressful it must be.
It is.
I want to,

857
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:10.020
people don't understand it.
It's become a lot more stressful than it used to be.

858
00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:14.820
All good stuff.
I'm glad to be doing it,
but,
but we're stressed right now,

859
00:50:14.821 --> 00:50:15.654
for example.

860
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:21.100
<v 0>So what,
Eh,
whether it's with stress or without which,</v>

861
00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:24.930
which episode are episodes,
did you have the most fun personally recording?

862
00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.670
Whether it's researching,
we're recording.

863
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:28.040
<v 2>Oh,
I could cheat on</v>

864
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:28.761
<v 0>this answer though,</v>

865
00:50:28.761 --> 00:50:33.761
because we did a three interview shows before the audience informed me that they

866
00:50:34.401 --> 00:50:38.720
get hugely let down when they finally see a hardcore history show,
you know,

867
00:50:38.721 --> 00:50:42.770
after waiting forever for a new one.
And instead of being what they expect,

868
00:50:42.771 --> 00:50:43.910
they get an interview show.

869
00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:48.320
But I like the interviews are fun because you can do them in real time.
I mean,

870
00:50:48.321 --> 00:50:52.430
you basically take an hour to talk to someone you admire for an hour and then

871
00:50:52.431 --> 00:50:54.320
you have a show,
oh my gosh,

872
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:58.980
I want three months now working on the latest hardcore history show.

873
00:50:58.981 --> 00:51:03.080
So I love that.
And I get to talk to two people that I admire,
like James Burke.

874
00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:07.760
But in terms of the other shows,
I won't lie to you.
And none of them were easy.

875
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:11.510
And they get harder and,
and I don't know why I keep doing that to myself.
I'm,

876
00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:15.020
my wife was saying,
why don't you just pick a nice small,

877
00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:18.590
easy topic and do that?
And I don't know why.

878
00:51:18.591 --> 00:51:23.180
Because there's something about feeling like I'm pushing myself.

879
00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:26.390
I mean,
if I have some creative brain cells,

880
00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:28.820
I am using every single one of them.

881
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.560
I will not be able to say as I'm laying on my death bed somewhere that I didn't

882
00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:36.830
push myself to the limit.
And on these shows,

883
00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:39.260
we'll go from that Mongol series,
which like I said,

884
00:51:39.261 --> 00:51:43.940
I think I left some of my sanity in the studio and decided to do the first world

885
00:51:43.941 --> 00:51:48.260
war after that.
What's sort of Masochists does that cam?
Um,

886
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:50.670
I think,
yeah,
I think we're cut from the same cloth

887
00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:55.510
<v 2>who she was doing the thinking in this company.
Right.
But,
but,
but,</v>

888
00:51:55.511 --> 00:51:59.440
but so the answer is it's just when I think I'm going to have some fun with one

889
00:51:59.441 --> 00:52:03.550
of these things,
I decided to take on something that,
listen,
there's no question.

890
00:52:03.551 --> 00:52:07.780
By the time it's done,
it's very satisfying to say,
hey,
people like that.

891
00:52:07.781 --> 00:52:10.180
We get a lot of good,
hard work and it paid off.

892
00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:13.060
But while you're in the midst of it,
and first of all,

893
00:52:13.061 --> 00:52:16.900
I'm not sure it isn't going to crumble like an airplane crash,
you know,

894
00:52:16.901 --> 00:52:17.620
I don't know that,

895
00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:20.290
that we're going to get to show five and the whole thing's just going to fall

896
00:52:20.291 --> 00:52:24.160
apart.
So it's nice when it's over to know that it worked out.

897
00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:28.960
But I'm always feeling like,
like I'm not having a ton of fun while I'm doing it,

898
00:52:28.961 --> 00:52:32.290
but uh,
but,
but I am,
it's like working on some big account.

899
00:52:32.291 --> 00:52:36.040
If you're an account executive and you're so happy when it's over and you go and

900
00:52:36.041 --> 00:52:36.750
you toast the,

901
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:39.520
the team you worked with and all that at the end and very satisfying,

902
00:52:39.521 --> 00:52:40.930
but while you're in the midst of it,

903
00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:43.960
there's a lot of stress and pressure and deadlines and all that.
But listen,

904
00:52:43.961 --> 00:52:47.020
that's life,
right?
Nothing's like you always have that.

905
00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:48.240
<v 0>No,
it's a,</v>

906
00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:52.510
it makes me think of my experience with publishing where after each book I tell

907
00:52:52.511 --> 00:52:54.850
myself,
you know,
the next book's going to be a short book.

908
00:52:54.851 --> 00:52:57.400
I always say that the next book is going to be a really short book,

909
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:58.780
going to take it easy,

910
00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:00.020
<v 2>break it down,
fast</v>

911
00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.980
<v 0>cranking off.
It'd be nice and bite sized and a,</v>

912
00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:07.420
then of course after I have some type of series of nervous breakdowns every year

913
00:53:07.421 --> 00:53:11.260
and a half or three years,
someone asks me,
well or they imply,
you know,

914
00:53:11.261 --> 00:53:14.200
I assume the books must get easier after you do the first book.

915
00:53:14.201 --> 00:53:15.730
The second must be much easier than,

916
00:53:15.731 --> 00:53:17.710
than the third must be just rote by that point.

917
00:53:17.711 --> 00:53:22.510
And I say no because I take everything that I've learned that w that should and

918
00:53:22.511 --> 00:53:27.060
could make it easier and then I just double what I want to do or triple what I

919
00:53:27.061 --> 00:53:32.061
want to do based on that new efficiencies up doing just as much if not more.

920
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:36.410
<v 2>Oh,
it sounds exactly the same.
Exactly.
Listen,</v>

921
00:53:36.411 --> 00:53:41.030
from a creative standpoint,
you shouldn't want to have it any other way.
Right?

922
00:53:41.031 --> 00:53:43.160
If you're the rolling stones and you're Keith Richards in that,

923
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:45.080
in that studio on the hundredth thing,

924
00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:48.710
you want to be working that hard because you want to,
I mean,
you know,

925
00:53:48.711 --> 00:53:53.030
there's an old line that that when you reach the top,
the only way to go is down.

926
00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:56.870
Right?
And so when we hear that,
we just did an episode that people say,
well,

927
00:53:56.871 --> 00:54:00.290
that's the best episode you ever did.
We instantly think to ourselves,
well,

928
00:54:00.291 --> 00:54:02.000
you don't want to do anything worse than that.

929
00:54:02.001 --> 00:54:06.440
That becomes the new minimum standard.
Right?
And truthfully,

930
00:54:06.441 --> 00:54:09.530
if you don't give them something as good as that next time,
they're going to say,

931
00:54:09.531 --> 00:54:14.030
wow,
you know,
it's not as good as that other thing.
So,
so we always feel,

932
00:54:14.031 --> 00:54:17.210
and I think you do too.
I think everybody does,
when they're doing creative work,

933
00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:19.700
the next thing needs to be better than the last thing.

934
00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:22.620
So you're continually saying,
oh,
sure,
I didn't go in.

935
00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:26.210
I almost went insane the last time.
I'm going to go in saying the next time.

936
00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:30.030
It's the only way to ensure that I'm,
I'm a,
I'm pushing the limits.
Right,

937
00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:32.840
<v 0>right.
Yeah.
The high water mark must be surpassed.</v>

938
00:54:33.110 --> 00:54:35.770
<v 2>How does Michael Jackson do better than thriller?
Right.</v>

939
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:40.080
<v 0>Oh God.
I don't even want to think about that,
but that would be a,
yeah,</v>

940
00:54:40.081 --> 00:54:41.820
I can't even imagine the,
um,

941
00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:46.940
one of the many things that comes up listening to hardcore history is military

942
00:54:47.551 --> 00:54:50.460
history and certainly with wrath of the cons,

943
00:54:50.461 --> 00:54:53.850
the explanation of different techniques and approaches,

944
00:54:53.851 --> 00:54:58.290
like the false flights or the false fleeing I found endlessly fascinating.

945
00:54:58.320 --> 00:54:59.950
And it sounds like that's,

946
00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:02.490
that's something that has fascinated you in military history.

947
00:55:02.491 --> 00:55:06.450
Are there any particular people or techniques or strategies that you've found

948
00:55:06.451 --> 00:55:08.880
most interesting?
I know that's a very,

949
00:55:09.830 --> 00:55:13.100
<v 2>I'm thankful that you find it interesting because I think,
and again,</v>

950
00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:15.380
something for podcasters who are,

951
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:20.090
who are just starting out maybe to pay attention to is if you talk about what

952
00:55:20.091 --> 00:55:21.410
you find interesting,

953
00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:26.240
eventually you will acquire a listenership that likes that too.

954
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:28.190
And so a lot of times I'll,
I'll,

955
00:55:28.191 --> 00:55:31.340
I'll wonder if I'm not getting too deeply military on some of this stuff.

956
00:55:31.341 --> 00:55:33.380
But then I realized that the people who are listening,

957
00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:34.820
if they're still listening,

958
00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:40.100
like liked that military stuff from earlier episodes that that was my focus in

959
00:55:40.101 --> 00:55:44.240
college was military history.
And so that's what I've always been interested in.

960
00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:48.710
I don't do rainbows and Unicorns is what I always tell people and it's dark.

961
00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:51.650
I'll tell you something on your show.
No one else even knows Tim.

962
00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:55.730
We're working on artwork for the specific shows that we've done.

963
00:55:55.731 --> 00:56:00.510
I've got an artist cool and it is so dark and our artwork is dark.
Anyway,
my,

964
00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:02.990
and I showed my wife the other day,
I was so proud of it and I said,

965
00:56:02.991 --> 00:56:03.824
how do you look at this,

966
00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:07.640
look at this art and and she comes over all excited to see the art and I can

967
00:56:07.641 --> 00:56:12.350
watch her face drop and she goes,
it's horrible.
I said,
I said,

968
00:56:12.351 --> 00:56:15.920
do you mean it's bad?
She goes,
no,
it just so dark and terrible.
I go,

969
00:56:15.921 --> 00:56:18.540
the listeners will love it.
Then I said,
it'll just be present.

970
00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:22.250
Just what we're after.
It matches the subject matter perfectly.
So,
I mean,

971
00:56:22.251 --> 00:56:23.130
but look at,

972
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:28.270
it's what I like and you just figure if you try to make a show based on what you

973
00:56:29.291 --> 00:56:33.130
think other people will like eventually you will have a show that you don't
like.

974
00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:36.430
And so you have to do what you like.

975
00:56:36.431 --> 00:56:39.550
And that's why this Internet is so wonderful and all these billions of people

976
00:56:39.551 --> 00:56:40.150
out there,

977
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:45.150
if you only suck up one 10th of 1% of the pie of Internet users that like your

978
00:56:46.451 --> 00:56:50.350
weird stuff that you bring up,
that translates into a lot of people.

979
00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:53.680
I always tell folks,
I'm like a street performer really Tim.

980
00:56:53.681 --> 00:56:55.570
I mean that's what I do.
I'm like that guy,

981
00:56:55.571 --> 00:56:59.410
the mime on the street corner or the guy who plays the violin and he opens up

982
00:56:59.411 --> 00:57:02.170
his violin case and you throw pennies on the street corner.

983
00:57:02.171 --> 00:57:06.740
The guy who plays the violin,
I just work a really busy street corner and,

984
00:57:07.050 --> 00:57:10.030
and that,
and that's what this is,
is that,
is that it?
You know,

985
00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:14.900
if you're a niche market product,
the Internet is a place where that niche can,

986
00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:19.840
can still translate into a ton of actual people.
So don't water it down.
You know,

987
00:57:19.841 --> 00:57:21.970
there's a,
there's a phrase and we've all heard it,

988
00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:26.560
but we don't think about what it means.
If you go on television,
on a TV network,

989
00:57:26.561 --> 00:57:31.510
you are broad casting,
right?
You are reaching a broad segment of the audience.

990
00:57:31.511 --> 00:57:33.400
The problem is,
is that to broadcast,

991
00:57:33.401 --> 00:57:37.420
you have to water things down and widen them out to the lowest common

992
00:57:37.421 --> 00:57:41.310
denominator.
We,
podcasters are narrow casters,

993
00:57:41.311 --> 00:57:44.950
not broadcasters.
And you can't lose sight of the fact that that's,

994
00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:47.890
that's not a bug.
It's a feature.
You know,

995
00:57:48.110 --> 00:57:51.250
you want to be a narrow caster and you want to have this niche.

996
00:57:51.251 --> 00:57:52.051
That's all yours is.

997
00:57:52.051 --> 00:57:56.290
So if you're talking about invisible unicorns that you see on the weekend,

998
00:57:56.410 --> 00:57:58.110
make that yours,
man,

999
00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:02.290
your physical Unicorn on the weekend podcast and anyone else who does,

1000
00:58:02.291 --> 00:58:06.490
it's ripping you off,
right?
So I told you never to tell anyone about that.

1001
00:58:06.491 --> 00:58:11.020
I'm really
the Sasquatches him in my house podcast.

1002
00:58:11.021 --> 00:58:13.120
I mean that,
that's how it should be.

1003
00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:18.130
I don't think that when you're talking about a program that you should do it for

1004
00:58:18.131 --> 00:58:22.110
other people,
do it for yourself and military histories where I live.
Um,

1005
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:25.120
I think the other thing that I have to keep emphasizing,

1006
00:58:25.330 --> 00:58:26.770
and I don't think you should be afraid of this too,

1007
00:58:26.771 --> 00:58:29.020
if I've learned anything from the podcasting,

1008
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:34.370
it's don't be afraid to do something you're not qualified to do.
Yeah.

1009
00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:37.780
I tell the story all the time is that I didn't come up with the hardcore history

1010
00:58:37.781 --> 00:58:38.530
idea.

1011
00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:43.000
I have far too much respect for historians to a thought that I could have done

1012
00:58:43.001 --> 00:58:45.670
that as a history major with a degree.
I mean if the one,

1013
00:58:45.671 --> 00:58:48.970
the history majors know is how great historians are because we read them all the

1014
00:58:48.971 --> 00:58:49.804
time.
Right.

1015
00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:53.830
So I used to tell my stories that I've told my whole life and I was telling him

1016
00:58:53.831 --> 00:58:57.550
around the dinner table and my mother in law said to me,
you know,

1017
00:58:57.551 --> 00:59:00.760
cause I was already doing one podcast on current events and stuff and she said,

1018
00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:04.000
why don't you do a podcast on the stuff you're talking about here at dinner?

1019
00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:05.790
And I said,
oh,
I couldn't do that.
I said,

1020
00:59:05.791 --> 00:59:08.260
it's history and I'm not qualified to talk about history.

1021
00:59:08.261 --> 00:59:11.020
I don't have a doctorate.
I'm not a historian.
And she said,

1022
00:59:11.021 --> 00:59:13.900
I didn't realize you had to have a doctorate to tell stories.

1023
00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:16.630
And I thought about that for a minute.
I thought,
well listen,

1024
00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:21.780
most of the great historians from the non modern era didn't have doctorates

1025
00:59:21.981 --> 00:59:24.860
either.
They're just storytellers to it.

1026
00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:27.890
As long as I'm not purporting to be a historian,

1027
00:59:27.891 --> 00:59:29.990
and as long as I'm using their work.

1028
00:59:29.991 --> 00:59:32.810
And what I always will say is let's say there's a historical controversy,

1029
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:35.390
I will tell you the controversy.
Then I will say,
well,

1030
00:59:35.391 --> 00:59:39.530
here's what historian a says about it and here's what historianB says about it.

1031
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:43.250
And I've been surprised how much the listeners like to hear about what's called

1032
00:59:43.251 --> 00:59:44.180
historiography,

1033
00:59:44.181 --> 00:59:47.990
which is the process of how history gets written and made an interpreted.

1034
00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:51.650
They love hearing that.
And so you'll actually talk about the different theories.

1035
00:59:51.651 --> 00:59:54.020
And so I'm not making this stuff up.

1036
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:58.400
I'm using the experts to tell you a story and the stories,

1037
00:59:58.401 --> 00:59:59.960
the part I'm qualified to tell you.

1038
01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.730
<v 0>Oh No,
I that,
that's one of the,</v>

1039
01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:06.660
one of the aspects of the show that I most appreciate is that you'll,

1040
01:00:06.661 --> 01:00:09.300
you'll point out the contradictions and you also talk about the different

1041
01:00:09.301 --> 01:00:13.050
schools of histories.
You'll have certain types of revisionist history.

1042
01:00:13.051 --> 01:00:16.320
You'll have different political leanings and how they interpret events,

1043
01:00:16.321 --> 01:00:19.820
say in the,
uh,
the Spanish American war,
uh,
founded,
you know,

1044
01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:23.280
the events and Cuba fascinating as well.
It's Philippines.
And,
uh,

1045
01:00:23.281 --> 01:00:28.281
it really helping people to realize that the biases at play in a lot of the

1046
01:00:29.491 --> 01:00:34.410
reporting in writing that we might otherwise assume to be objective.

1047
01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:39.410
<v 2>Perfect example.
We talked about Rome,
ancient Rome and the republic period.</v>

1048
01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:40.460
And you know,

1049
01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:43.610
the reason that people look at that period and think it looks a lot like our own

1050
01:00:43.611 --> 01:00:47.000
is because you can see some of the same political dynamics at work,

1051
01:00:47.001 --> 01:00:50.000
broadly speaking.
Right?
You know,
obviously there's a lot of time elapsed.

1052
01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:51.590
I often say to people,

1053
01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:56.740
imagine that there's a Fox News in ancient Rome and an MSNBC in ancient Rome.

1054
01:00:58.071 --> 01:01:01.760
So a left wing version of events and a right wing version of events.

1055
01:01:01.761 --> 01:01:05.510
Because what they always say is history journalism is the first draft of
history,

1056
01:01:05.511 --> 01:01:05.900
right?

1057
01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:10.490
So then imagine that only one of those narratives made it into your history

1058
01:01:10.491 --> 01:01:11.324
books,
right?

1059
01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:16.330
Roam as seen by Fox News or Roman politics as seen by MSNBC and how you can tell

1060
01:01:19.011 --> 01:01:21.430
the Roman story that way and it,

1061
01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:25.730
and if you do it and you contrast the two views,
it sounds even more modern.

1062
01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:30.620
So I do think that it actually sheds light on the events to point out the

1063
01:01:30.621 --> 01:01:33.620
different,
well,
I mean the Apaches,
uh,
a hundred years ago,

1064
01:01:33.621 --> 01:01:38.621
those are red murderers killing good Christian White settlers 30 years ago.

1065
01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:42.800
It's terrible,
horrible white people murdering blameless Indian.

1066
01:01:42.801 --> 01:01:46.250
I mean if you go through these periods where the entire focus and then the

1067
01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:49.580
public mood changes and we write history of different way,

1068
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:54.200
those are fascinating in and of itself because it also teaches you that there

1069
01:01:54.201 --> 01:01:56.450
isn't necessarily truth here.

1070
01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:59.820
There's just the current perspective that's Invo.

1071
01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:05.090
<v 0>Oh,
absolutely.
And I'm actually reading a book right now called dying every day,</v>

1072
01:02:05.091 --> 01:02:08.720
which is a subtitle,
Seneca at the court of Nero,

1073
01:02:08.721 --> 01:02:13.721
and it's a very fascinating account of Seneca that tries to reconcile at some

1074
01:02:15.771 --> 01:02:20.771
level the opposing views and mythologies and facts surrounding this character.

1075
01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:26.430
Seneca,
who was a very famous stoic but at the same time was very,
very wealthy.

1076
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:31.590
Some people called him opulent and just trying to point out the backgrounds of

1077
01:02:31.591 --> 01:02:35.310
the people who wrote these histories or who had these accounts were sending some

1078
01:02:35.311 --> 01:02:40.230
cases,
his political enemies.
It's really fascinating bus far because I,
I'm a,

1079
01:02:40.231 --> 01:02:41.730
I'm a huge fan of,
uh,

1080
01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:45.230
of Seneca and Marcus are released and a lot of these philosophers,
let me

1081
01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:49.850
<v 2>stick stoics.
That's my favorite exact,
as you point out,
how much money,</v>

1082
01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:51.900
the best kind of stoic to be the hedonist,

1083
01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:56.190
like premeditated spontaneity,
know

1084
01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:01.310
<v 0>the media.
If I could shift gears a little bit,</v>

1085
01:03:01.311 --> 01:03:04.760
ask just a handful of kind of rapid fire questions and a,

1086
01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:05.690
I'm having a lot of fun.

1087
01:03:05.691 --> 01:03:08.240
We could do this for a long time but I want to be respectful of your time but

1088
01:03:08.241 --> 01:03:09.050
I'd look to,

1089
01:03:09.050 --> 01:03:12.560
to throw off a couple of rapid fire questions and you can take as little or as

1090
01:03:12.561 --> 01:03:16.820
much time answering them as you'd like.
You have your hands in a lot these days.

1091
01:03:16.821 --> 01:03:18.230
You're doing quite a few different things.

1092
01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:23.060
What are the first say a hour or two of your day typically look like?

1093
01:03:23.061 --> 01:03:24.620
What are your morning rituals?

1094
01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:28.220
<v 2>Oh,
I've had the same morning ritual for a long time.</v>

1095
01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:32.510
It's the old talk radio show host or reporter ritual where I get up and I'm

1096
01:03:32.511 --> 01:03:35.510
really going to summit one of these days when books and newspapers go away.

1097
01:03:35.511 --> 01:03:36.840
I'm going to be really sad cause I,

1098
01:03:36.841 --> 01:03:41.240
I have to start with the newspaper like an idiot nowadays and I,
I bring it in,

1099
01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:45.410
I get the Cup of coffee out,
I start with the newspaper,
then I go online.

1100
01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:48.890
If I see any stories that piqued my interest,
I'll print them out.

1101
01:03:48.891 --> 01:03:51.710
I'll put them in a folder and then the next time it's time to do a current

1102
01:03:51.711 --> 01:03:54.350
events program.
I'll look in the folder and see,
you know,

1103
01:03:54.351 --> 01:03:57.230
we're on like 275 of those or something.

1104
01:03:57.231 --> 01:04:00.950
So it's getting awful hard to find new things to talk about that I don't feel

1105
01:04:00.951 --> 01:04:01.880
like we've already done.

1106
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:06.260
But I spent the early morning while I'm waking up the First Cup of coffee or 10

1107
01:04:06.590 --> 01:04:10.920
catching up and reading mostly,
uh,
current events stuff.
What you do,

1108
01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:14.960
you wake up?
Oh goodness.
Well,
it's summer vacation now here at my house.

1109
01:04:14.961 --> 01:04:19.070
It's based on the children's schedule.
So when,
when it's school time,
it's like,

1110
01:04:19.071 --> 01:04:21.290
you know,
7:00 AM and we're up and at 'em,
uh,

1111
01:04:21.370 --> 01:04:23.810
now I can sleep a little bit later sometimes,
but I have a,

1112
01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:29.020
I have a sweet spot in my production ability where I'm at my best talking and

1113
01:04:29.751 --> 01:04:33.740
it's usually from about like nine to noon or one.

1114
01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:35.780
And so that's when I like to be in the studio.

1115
01:04:35.781 --> 01:04:38.660
I hit like two o'clock and all the coffee in the world's not keeping them,

1116
01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:42.590
you know,
and,
and so that,
that's why we're having this interview now,
Tim,

1117
01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:46.280
I remember the scheduling.
Yeah.
So I have this awful problem.

1118
01:04:46.290 --> 01:04:48.650
And when I'm dealing with east coast people,
it's really awful.

1119
01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.640
So I tried to get into the studio when,

1120
01:04:51.641 --> 01:04:55.010
when I've got a decent amount of energy and then by the time I'm out of there

1121
01:04:55.011 --> 01:04:55.371
and done,

1122
01:04:55.371 --> 01:04:59.120
then I'm spend the afternoon getting back into reading research cause there's a

1123
01:04:59.121 --> 01:05:03.800
lot of reading to do and I'm not,
I'm not the world's quickest reader.
And so,
um,

1124
01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:09.080
I also have a very tough time trying to figure out opportunity costs.

1125
01:05:09.081 --> 01:05:10.100
You know,
one of the things that,

1126
01:05:10.101 --> 01:05:14.810
that a lot of podcasters start to learn once their podcast becomes popular is

1127
01:05:14.811 --> 01:05:18.850
you're running a business now and that's not the part that most people,

1128
01:05:18.851 --> 01:05:22.060
yours truly included thought of when we got into podcasting.
Right?

1129
01:05:22.061 --> 01:05:24.580
You think about the product,
you don't think about the,

1130
01:05:24.590 --> 01:05:28.900
the edifice and structure that you have to maintain to keep the product going.

1131
01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:33.910
And I'm not gifted at that stuff.
And so where people will often say,

1132
01:05:33.911 --> 01:05:34.990
like on Twitter and stuff,

1133
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:38.980
I'm wonder what you're doing in the three months since the last time you put a

1134
01:05:38.981 --> 01:05:42.940
history podcast and you can't,
you can't even begin to tell them all.
I mean,

1135
01:05:42.941 --> 01:05:47.230
just the website alone that I've been working on for a year is the time wasting

1136
01:05:47.231 --> 01:05:50.170
that goes on in my life and that you certainly,
I could do it better,

1137
01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:53.810
but like people will come to me and say,
Dan,
could you do this?
Or you do,

1138
01:05:53.811 --> 01:05:56.770
then you get these opportunities thrown your way because of the podcast and you

1139
01:05:56.771 --> 01:06:00.160
think to yourself,
I can't get a podcast out in three months.

1140
01:06:00.161 --> 01:06:03.700
How am I going to take advantage of any of these other opportunities that come

1141
01:06:03.701 --> 01:06:05.170
my way?
And so,

1142
01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:10.200
so I'm wrestling with how I do more because people have given me these chances

1143
01:06:10.301 --> 01:06:13.660
based on the fact that these listeners are so kind to listen to the show.

1144
01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:16.540
I don't know how to do them.
I don't know how to run this business.

1145
01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:18.940
So it's all I can do to get these shows that,

1146
01:06:18.941 --> 01:06:21.160
so when you talk about how you do these things,

1147
01:06:21.161 --> 01:06:25.120
and I wrestled with the business side of this every day to be honest.

1148
01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.880
<v 0>Well I will,
uh,
we've,
we've chatted about this before,</v>

1149
01:06:27.881 --> 01:06:31.900
but if I can help with any website stuff or whether it's wordpress related or

1150
01:06:31.901 --> 01:06:33.610
otherwise,
I'm happy to.

1151
01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:37.220
<v 2>Tim,
I could abuse worse than you've ever been.</v>

1152
01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:41.600
I've,
I've heard,
I've,

1153
01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:46.590
<v 0>I've,
I've heard about your bookshelf full of tomes about medieval torture.</v>

1154
01:06:46.591 --> 01:06:47.424
I know how you want it.

1155
01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:49.600
<v 2>People who promised to help me with websites.</v>

1156
01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.430
<v 0>What is the newspaper that you read?
Is,</v>

1157
01:06:52.431 --> 01:06:54.510
is there one newspaper that you consistently read?

1158
01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:56.960
<v 2>Yes,
the stupid local one here</v>

1159
01:06:58.550 --> 01:07:02.120
that just gets delivered to my front door easily.
And the funny thing is,

1160
01:07:02.121 --> 01:07:06.110
is everything I read in,
it's been printed two weeks ago on the Internet,

1161
01:07:06.350 --> 01:07:09.680
but I still just like some old person have to do an,

1162
01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:13.220
and I have to read it all the way to the end of the comics.
Like some,

1163
01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:17.330
like some person with OCD or something.
I just,
I can't help myself.

1164
01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:21.440
When I was in TV news before the Internet was doing news,

1165
01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:24.700
I used to get like five newspapers and you know,
and,

1166
01:07:24.701 --> 01:07:27.620
and I go through every one of them all day,
like an idiot.
I don't,

1167
01:07:27.621 --> 01:07:28.790
I don't do that anymore,
but,

1168
01:07:29.010 --> 01:07:32.570
but this is a silly local paper here in my local Berg.

1169
01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:35.440
<v 0>I love it.
Uh,
and,
and when you're,</v>

1170
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:40.160
when you go online to potentially find a interesting current events or,

1171
01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:43.130
or angles to print out,
what are those sources?

1172
01:07:43.131 --> 01:07:45.500
Are there any particular sources that you repeatedly visit?

1173
01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:46.831
<v 2>Um,
well,</v>

1174
01:07:46.831 --> 01:07:50.820
a lot of Twitter has turned out to be really good way for listeners to share

1175
01:07:50.821 --> 01:07:53.580
with me.
Things that I think I'd be interested in.

1176
01:07:53.581 --> 01:07:57.150
And then they get a pretty good idea of the sort of things I like.
But no,

1177
01:07:57.151 --> 01:08:00.560
I go everywhere and I might start with Google news and then just,
you know,
I,

1178
01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:03.240
I check out all the British newspapers.
I check out the,

1179
01:08:03.241 --> 01:08:07.170
a major American newspapers,
there's some in Canada.
And then I liked going.

1180
01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:10.290
Wonderful thing about the internet,
the ability to kind of go local,

1181
01:08:10.291 --> 01:08:14.430
so if you're reading about stuff in between the Israelis and Palestinians,

1182
01:08:14.431 --> 01:08:17.450
for example,
like looking at the newspapers from the Middle East.

1183
01:08:17.451 --> 01:08:20.810
I like looking at various,
for example,
if you're looking for the Israeli side,

1184
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:24.660
there are different Israeli newspapers with different perspectives and so,

1185
01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:26.300
so when I'm delving deep,

1186
01:08:26.301 --> 01:08:30.770
it's wonderful to have the internet that allows you to three dimensionalize in a

1187
01:08:30.771 --> 01:08:35.771
way that was not possible when I was getting five American newspapers in one day

1188
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:40.550
to really,
I don't know if you end up being more intelligent on the subject,

1189
01:08:40.551 --> 01:08:44.120
but you could certainly give multiple viewpoints.
Does that make sense?

1190
01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:44.900
<v 0>Oh definitely.</v>

1191
01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:49.900
I remember my first real extended trip abroad in college.

1192
01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:52.490
This was after being in Japan as an exchange student,

1193
01:08:52.491 --> 01:08:57.491
but I was in China and I found the local English newspaper is contrasted with

1194
01:08:59.571 --> 01:09:04.430
the International Herald Tribune to be really mind opening because I'd never

1195
01:09:04.431 --> 01:09:09.431
been exposed to extremely different viewpoints on what I perceived to be exactly

1196
01:09:09.741 --> 01:09:13.340
the same phenomena or current events really was a,
was a,

1197
01:09:13.341 --> 01:09:14.810
was an eye opening experience for me.

1198
01:09:15.090 --> 01:09:19.280
Reviews what we always read when we're out of the country as those was all I

1199
01:09:19.281 --> 01:09:23.390
could get my hands on.
I know I've been there.
Uh,
what,

1200
01:09:23.810 --> 01:09:27.560
just to completely shift gears,
when you think of the word successful,

1201
01:09:27.561 --> 01:09:29.270
who's the first person who comes to mind?

1202
01:09:29.830 --> 01:09:32.930
<v 2>Oh my goodness.
You know,
Tim,
I don't know.
I,</v>

1203
01:09:32.931 --> 01:09:36.580
I you throwing some questions at me today and I'm this verbal person and I'm

1204
01:09:36.581 --> 01:09:38.020
usually pretty quick on my feet,

1205
01:09:38.021 --> 01:09:43.021
but I don't know how to answer that because my definition of success is perhaps

1206
01:09:43.301 --> 01:09:45.220
a little,
a little different.
You know,

1207
01:09:45.221 --> 01:09:49.690
I was arguing with somebody once about ambition and we were talking about

1208
01:09:49.691 --> 01:09:53.080
whether ambition was genetic or not,

1209
01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:55.840
and we were discussing happiness.

1210
01:09:55.841 --> 01:09:59.740
And I was trying to make the point that that successful being successful in life

1211
01:09:59.741 --> 01:10:00.970
means you're happy,

1212
01:10:01.450 --> 01:10:06.450
but that some people have to achieve certain things to be happy.

1213
01:10:06.730 --> 01:10:08.350
Right?
Right.
So,
so in other words,

1214
01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:13.100
I know people who can do nothing in their lives and be happy with that,
right?

1215
01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:17.590
So to me,
they're successful,
right?
But there's a lot of people who say,
well,
no,

1216
01:10:17.591 --> 01:10:18.041
no,
no.
If I,

1217
01:10:18.041 --> 01:10:21.220
if I don't make a bunch of money or if I don't achieve something or if I don't

1218
01:10:21.221 --> 01:10:26.050
create something or,
or if I don't,
if you don't reach these particular goals,

1219
01:10:26.230 --> 01:10:28.150
then I'm not happy.
So in other words,

1220
01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:32.230
success for them requires in order to be happy,

1221
01:10:32.231 --> 01:10:36.190
requires that they do these other things to find happiness.
So to me,

1222
01:10:36.191 --> 01:10:37.840
being successful is being happy.

1223
01:10:37.841 --> 01:10:41.140
And so there's lots of people out there that I think have managed to be

1224
01:10:41.141 --> 01:10:45.910
successful.
Who,
who most of us have probably never heard of.
I tell you what,

1225
01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:49.840
there's a part of me that's even jealous of the people that can manage to be

1226
01:10:49.841 --> 01:10:54.740
happy without having to do a bunch of things to get there.
You know?
And I,
yeah,

1227
01:10:54.741 --> 01:10:55.990
I think,
I mean,
people look and say,

1228
01:10:55.991 --> 01:10:57.640
isn't it great what's going on with your podcast?

1229
01:10:57.850 --> 01:10:59.830
And I said yes because it makes me happy,

1230
01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:05.160
not because of any other amorphous or even concrete goals making this much money

1231
01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:08.530
or getting this much notoriety or whatever,
you know,

1232
01:11:08.710 --> 01:11:11.860
going on Tim Ferriss show and having him say all these nice things about me is

1233
01:11:11.861 --> 01:11:16.230
wonderful,
but the show itself makes me happy and,
and that's,

1234
01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:19.890
that's where the success comes in.
Now,
if we didn't make enough money to live,

1235
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:22.500
I wouldn't do the show,
so I wouldn't be happy,
you know?
So I mean,

1236
01:11:22.501 --> 01:11:24.060
it all kind of boils down to the same thing.

1237
01:11:24.061 --> 01:11:25.680
We need different things to be happy,

1238
01:11:25.681 --> 01:11:30.210
but happy and successful are the same thing to me.
Does that make sense?

1239
01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:35.300
<v 0>Yeah,
no,
that makes sense.
The roundabout way of answering your question.
No,
no,
no.</v>

1240
01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:38.440
That's a good answer.
They did the whole goal of the question,

1241
01:11:38.441 --> 01:11:40.960
sorry about very clever of you know,
the what,

1242
01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:44.440
what would be failure to you then it would it be being unhappy or is it

1243
01:11:44.441 --> 01:11:46.180
something,
is it something else entirely?

1244
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:49.350
And that that could even be as it relates to the podcast if we wanted to,

1245
01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:51.920
to try to constrain it a bit to make it easier to answer it.

1246
01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:53.110
<v 2>I'll tell you,
I'll tell you,
here's,</v>

1247
01:11:53.111 --> 01:11:57.400
here's the worst part about having a podcast that people think are successful is

1248
01:11:57.401 --> 01:12:01.390
if you've never made it successful,
then you haven't screwed anything up.

1249
01:12:01.391 --> 01:12:05.050
You took a chance and you failed and that's part of life and it's part of

1250
01:12:05.051 --> 01:12:06.820
learning and it's part of success actually.

1251
01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:12.180
But if you manage to create something that's successful and then you screw it up

1252
01:12:12.251 --> 01:12:13.084
and blow it,

1253
01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:17.710
that that to me seems much more of a tragedy at a personal failure.

1254
01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:20.500
Then the never having gotten one off the ground at all.

1255
01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:25.330
So I think I was rather devil may care when we started these podcasts.
Now,

1256
01:12:25.570 --> 01:12:29.050
all I'm thinking about is if I don't do this blueprints of Armageddon part four

1257
01:12:29.051 --> 01:12:33.190
and have it be really good,
then then I've screwed up the golden goose.
Right.
So,

1258
01:12:33.191 --> 01:12:35.500
so failure to me is really,
you know,

1259
01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.310
like Keith Richards would have said in that rolling stones a studio,

1260
01:12:39.370 --> 01:12:41.470
you're only as good as the last thing you put out.

1261
01:12:41.471 --> 01:12:44.830
So failure is not putting out a piece of good work at this point in my mind.

1262
01:12:45.070 --> 01:12:49.330
<v 0>Yeah,
no,
I definitely get it.
I mean,
I think especially with the Sophomore Act,</v>

1263
01:12:49.331 --> 01:12:51.130
for me at least with the second book,

1264
01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.530
brought a lot of stress with it and it really,

1265
01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.920
really under the gun with the second book.
It's a perfect example,

1266
01:12:57.250 --> 01:13:01.030
very similar feeling.
Uh,
if you could change one thing about yourself,

1267
01:13:01.031 --> 01:13:01.864
what would it be?

1268
01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:05.150
<v 2>I'd be more productive.
I think that's pretty easy.</v>

1269
01:13:05.450 --> 01:13:09.700
I got out of the booth today in the studio and I didn't have anything useful.

1270
01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:12.140
I've been working on the same part for like three days now.

1271
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:14.150
And you're just ready to smack walls.

1272
01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:19.100
I mean to sit there and feed so unproductive,
even though,
you know,

1273
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:22.640
and I learned this,
I learned this writing as well,
where,
you know,

1274
01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:26.810
I remember writing something and setting myself a weekly total that I wanted to

1275
01:13:26.811 --> 01:13:27.351
hit,
right?

1276
01:13:27.351 --> 01:13:30.470
So every day I wanted to write this many hundred words and I would feel

1277
01:13:30.471 --> 01:13:33.170
productive and then you will get to the end of the week and you need to edit

1278
01:13:33.171 --> 01:13:37.420
what you wrote and you get rid of the 5,000 words or something and you just,
you,

1279
01:13:37.421 --> 01:13:41.600
you think to yourself,
oh my God,
what did I waste all that time for?

1280
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:46.100
And I think that that's how creative endeavors often are.
So,
so like,
you know,

1281
01:13:46.101 --> 01:13:47.600
you asked me how these programs go.

1282
01:13:47.601 --> 01:13:51.410
There are days when I'll go in there and not like anything I do.

1283
01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:53.660
And they just feel like such a waste.

1284
01:13:53.661 --> 01:13:56.390
I could have used that time so much more constructively.

1285
01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:00.530
Had I only known it was going to be a wasted day at the microphone.
Right.

1286
01:14:00.710 --> 01:14:03.530
So yeah,
productivity.
I'd love to be more productive.

1287
01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:06.500
I'd love to be able to multitask.
I can't multitask either.

1288
01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:09.740
<v 0>Don't you think,
just to,
to touch on what you just said,</v>

1289
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:12.010
don't you think though sometimes

1290
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:17.010
<v 2>that that day of seemingly wasted recording is necessary to just state get to</v>

1291
01:14:20.771 --> 01:14:25.771
that one paragraph that is the one that everyone quotes you are absolutely 1000%

1292
01:14:27.761 --> 01:14:31.600
right and that is what it,
yes.
You're,
you're fumbling your way to glory.

1293
01:14:32.290 --> 01:14:36.800
That's my,
that's my,
my emo glory.
He should be the name of my next book,

1294
01:14:36.801 --> 01:14:40.520
text book.
I think we have a t shirt.
At least you're,

1295
01:14:40.570 --> 01:14:42.070
you couldn't be more right about that.

1296
01:14:42.071 --> 01:14:46.050
And I keep trying to console myself saying that it wasn't actually a wasted

1297
01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:49.600
created day even though 500 people on Twitter said,

1298
01:14:49.601 --> 01:14:51.460
where the hell is the next show,
Carl?

1299
01:14:51.461 --> 01:14:55.120
And get off the beach where you're my tie and I,
you know what?
I loved him.

1300
01:14:55.121 --> 01:15:00.121
I love that there are people out there who literally think I wait until the last

1301
01:15:00.491 --> 01:15:04.840
second and then I walk in and four hours later we have a show and I was just

1302
01:15:04.841 --> 01:15:08.650
making you wait.
I love those.
Those people think I'm Frank Sinatra.

1303
01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:11.980
I love those people.
Right.
And you know what,

1304
01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.000
and I'm going to start to cultivate that image that I really don't do anything

1305
01:15:17.231 --> 01:15:20.530
until the last second and then,
yeah.
Okay.
I'll give you a show.

1306
01:15:20.531 --> 01:15:23.500
Maybe tonight after dinner I'll crank one out for you.

1307
01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:27.340
Talk about making yourself in the immortal legend,
right?
I,

1308
01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:31.580
I just do those shows in real time to absolutely.
Yeah.
At one take Carlin

1309
01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:37.080
midnight and keep the band up late.
And then I just,
you know,

1310
01:15:37.090 --> 01:15:41.560
we're out there with an album.
So speaking of my ties,
you walk into a bar,

1311
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:45.940
what do you order from bartender?
Something's straight.
You know,

1312
01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:47.980
I come from a family on both sides of,

1313
01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:51.370
of old fashioned men and that's the seamless way to describe him.

1314
01:15:51.371 --> 01:15:53.740
I don't smoke cigarettes like they did,

1315
01:15:54.130 --> 01:15:57.940
but it's hard to totally get away from your roots.

1316
01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:01.460
And they were hard drinking.
See,
they were so much tougher than I am too.

1317
01:16:01.930 --> 01:16:05.700
I don't have the toughness,
but I can drink like they drank.
And so,

1318
01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:09.040
so if I'm going to sit there,
if I'm going to go to a bar and drink,

1319
01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:14.070
I'm going to drink a straight whiskey or a straight rum or a straight vodka or

1320
01:16:15.551 --> 01:16:20.170
something like that.
I don't fool around.
Right,
right.
Skip the fourplex.

1321
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:24.070
Right.
Come on.
It's a production done.
Right.
So I'm,

1322
01:16:24.071 --> 01:16:27.490
so I'm going with the Sinatra theme that you said.
So we talked about snotor.

1323
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:28.540
Are we talking about drinking?

1324
01:16:28.541 --> 01:16:33.541
What's the first face that comes to mind when you think punchable punchable Oh,

1325
01:16:34.301 --> 01:16:37.960
you know,
I get,
so I have seen,

1326
01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:41.320
and this is where like if you get to my old shows on politics and current
events,

1327
01:16:41.321 --> 01:16:43.090
I sound so much angrier.

1328
01:16:43.450 --> 01:16:48.400
I think when I got into politics as a teenager,
I got in it from,
uh,
from,

1329
01:16:48.401 --> 01:16:51.970
uh,
and I think a lot of teenagers when they get to politics or early college

1330
01:16:51.971 --> 01:16:53.830
students,
it's out of anger.

1331
01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:58.150
You start to see the world as it's been created by the generations before you,

1332
01:16:58.330 --> 01:17:00.220
and you just feel like it's so screwed up.

1333
01:17:00.221 --> 01:17:03.610
And how can they deal with all the injustice in the world,
you know?

1334
01:17:03.850 --> 01:17:07.750
And so that's how I got into political talk radio for example.
It's just,

1335
01:17:07.751 --> 01:17:12.751
I was so mad at things that I saw that were just wrong in my opinion.

1336
01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:16.760
As I've gotten older,
I think I've been able to see more perspectives and,

1337
01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:21.380
and maybe be able to walk a mile in the other guy's moccasins a little bit

1338
01:17:21.381 --> 01:17:23.190
better.
But so when you say you know,

1339
01:17:23.210 --> 01:17:28.040
people that you would just want to punch and maybe it's a holdover wanting to

1340
01:17:28.041 --> 01:17:32.240
punch them from years and years ago,
but the people that drive me crazy,

1341
01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:35.660
I'm going to answer this question a certain way.
We did,
we did downgrade.

1342
01:17:35.661 --> 01:17:39.580
It's a slap also.
I'm not recrafting I just want to tell you that there,

1343
01:17:39.581 --> 01:17:42.920
there was a wonderful series called hell and the Pacific and it's uh,

1344
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:43.730
it's on the,

1345
01:17:43.730 --> 01:17:47.300
the Second World War in the Pacific theater and I think it was made by a British

1346
01:17:47.301 --> 01:17:50.780
company.
And I remember being shocked because it had footage that we don't,

1347
01:17:50.830 --> 01:17:55.040
where we didn't show much in the United States of really horrifying Pacific

1348
01:17:55.041 --> 01:17:59.150
battles.
And they interview a US veteran who didn't die that long ago.

1349
01:17:59.151 --> 01:18:02.720
His name is Eugene Sledge and his nickname when he was in the Marines was

1350
01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.490
sledgehammer and he is,

1351
01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:08.420
he went on after he got out of the service to teach a school,

1352
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:13.100
a college in I think it was Georgia and he's the most soft spoken,
wonderful,

1353
01:18:13.190 --> 01:18:15.080
sweet southern gentleman you've ever met.

1354
01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:20.090
And the whole hell in the Pacific series starts with him saying that no one

1355
01:18:20.991 --> 01:18:25.991
who's even yards behind the front line in war knows what it's really like and

1356
01:18:26.121 --> 01:18:27.560
nobody who does,

1357
01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:31.610
who hasn't been up there should be able to send young people off to war if you

1358
01:18:31.611 --> 01:18:35.480
haven't been.
And he means right on the front lines,
you have no place doing that.

1359
01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:40.190
The people that drive me crazy are the people in American politics who are,

1360
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:43.460
I mean who,
who see war is the answer to everything and I don't even mean war.

1361
01:18:43.461 --> 01:18:46.790
I mean some of these,
John Bolton's,
the guy I always use,

1362
01:18:46.791 --> 01:18:49.880
he's the former you a American ambassador to the UN.

1363
01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:51.740
Just another one of these guys.

1364
01:18:51.741 --> 01:18:56.741
The himself avoided military service but sees sending other people to go do that

1365
01:18:56.841 --> 01:18:58.400
as his answer to every problem.

1366
01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:02.750
And I guess that just drives me nuts because as a guy who talks about military

1367
01:19:02.751 --> 01:19:06.710
history all the time and here's these accounts of veterans and realizes how

1368
01:19:06.711 --> 01:19:11.711
often their lives are forever altered even when they come home and seemingly one

1369
01:19:11.961 --> 01:19:12.710
piece,

1370
01:19:12.710 --> 01:19:17.710
you just want that to be such a really well thought out decision when you decide

1371
01:19:18.681 --> 01:19:23.681
to have people suck up that that lifetime of damage for some cause.

1372
01:19:24.170 --> 01:19:26.360
Just like Eugene sledge was saying,
you know,

1373
01:19:26.361 --> 01:19:29.180
anyone who's going to send someone off,
you've got to have a really good reason.

1374
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:33.350
And I feel we've got a lot of people in the public sphere that didn't do this

1375
01:19:33.351 --> 01:19:34.280
themselves,

1376
01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:37.610
but for any reason are willing to go sell it to their people and they just make

1377
01:19:37.611 --> 01:19:41.360
me angry.
Like I'm 16 years old and into punk rock,

1378
01:19:41.361 --> 01:19:44.930
which I'm still into and mad and,
and you do,
you get Irish and just,

1379
01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:49.010
I'm ready to become a stereotypical,
you know,
punch somebody in the mouth.

1380
01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.170
And it's really,
it's really a,

1381
01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:55.180
a piece of me that's mostly dead now that comes back and haunts me at moments

1382
01:19:55.611 --> 01:19:59.270
just at the wrong time.
It's always at the wrong time.

1383
01:19:59.330 --> 01:20:03.500
It's always at the wrong time.
So speaking of,
of Punk Rock,

1384
01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:08.070
what are the most frequently played bands or songs on your,
whether it's

1385
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:10.470
<v 0>a computer,
iPhone or otherwise?</v>

1386
01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:12.720
<v 2>Oh God.
I go through,</v>

1387
01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:17.130
I go through phases where I just kill something,
you know,
and I,
I'll just,

1388
01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:20.700
I'll get back into the dead Kennedys and then it's like two weeks of just

1389
01:20:20.701 --> 01:20:24.080
nothing but that until I can't listen anymore.
And then I'll move to,

1390
01:20:24.330 --> 01:20:28.500
I've never quite discovered the variety is the spice of life thing.

1391
01:20:28.501 --> 01:20:33.220
I have to like eat all Sushi for like two weeks until I can't have anymore.

1392
01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:35.600
You know,
and I don't like Sushi,
but I just,

1393
01:20:35.601 --> 01:20:38.130
it was an example and that's how I am with music.
I mean,

1394
01:20:38.131 --> 01:20:40.560
I would buy it back in the days of record albums,
the new record album,

1395
01:20:40.561 --> 01:20:43.800
and play it 200 times and then never want to hear it again or you know.

1396
01:20:43.801 --> 01:20:45.990
So I like all the old stuff too.

1397
01:20:45.991 --> 01:20:49.830
When you go back to like Lou reed or the seeds or to me,

1398
01:20:49.831 --> 01:20:54.030
even Jerry Lee Lewis is punk rock.
To me that's an attitude.
Not a,

1399
01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:57.540
not a sound.
So I just like all those,

1400
01:20:57.541 --> 01:21:01.200
to me music is about so much more than the listening experience that just a

1401
01:21:01.201 --> 01:21:02.790
basic philosophy and music.

1402
01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:06.630
Is it about the technical expertise of the musician or the busyness of the

1403
01:21:06.631 --> 01:21:10.950
melody?
Or is it about tribal drums that get your blood going and you know,

1404
01:21:10.951 --> 01:21:14.500
and I'm much more of the tribal drum person than I am about,

1405
01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:18.510
I worked with a lot of audio people and for them they want to hear technical

1406
01:21:18.511 --> 01:21:22.740
expertise and wonderfully crafted and I want to hear something from the soul,

1407
01:21:22.770 --> 01:21:23.370
you know?

1408
01:21:23.370 --> 01:21:27.160
<v 0>Oh for sure.
I'm just getting into hand drums.
So I'm,
I'm all about the drums.</v>

1409
01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:31.520
<v 2>Very,
it's very emotional and ancient story.</v>

1410
01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:34.250
<v 0>I love it.
So last question,
potentially,</v>

1411
01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:39.520
if you could give one or two pieces of advice to your 20 year old self,

1412
01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:41.233
what would it be?

1413
01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:43.620
<v 2>Oh,
I think about this all the time.</v>

1414
01:21:43.710 --> 01:21:47.190
I remember coming out of the television station where I was a TV reporter and I

1415
01:21:47.191 --> 01:21:51.840
was working the night shift and I had just worked on some stories all day and

1416
01:21:51.841 --> 01:21:55.590
was just thoroughly unsatisfied with them by the time they hit a hair.

1417
01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:58.890
And I remember walking out of the station at like midnight and it was up on the

1418
01:21:58.891 --> 01:22:02.060
top of this mountain,
beautiful place.
Uh,
and,
and I,

1419
01:22:02.061 --> 01:22:06.000
and I remember looking out and just say,
oh my God,
when am I going to like this?

1420
01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:09.120
You know,
when,
when am I gonna what am I going to really be,

1421
01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:11.970
be happy with the work that I'm churning out.

1422
01:22:12.570 --> 01:22:16.530
So I look back on that all the time when I think of where I am now and just

1423
01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:20.520
think if I could go back and just tell myself,
don't stress about it.

1424
01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:23.940
It's all gonna work out in the end.
What did any of us like to know that?

1425
01:22:23.941 --> 01:22:28.670
Just just tell me it's all going to be okay and I can get by in my twenties

1426
01:22:28.670 --> 01:22:30.780
twenties were really,
really hard for me.
I thought,

1427
01:22:30.781 --> 01:22:34.440
and if you could have just said stop worrying,
it's all going to be okay.

1428
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:38.700
Although I'm assuming it's all going to be okay,
Tim.
I still don't that,
but I,

1429
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:43.380
but I think I would have saved a ton of emotional stress and worry.
I'm a,
I'm a,

1430
01:22:43.381 --> 01:22:45.780
I'm a natural born worrier and I think it would have been nice,

1431
01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:49.320
although if you'd have told me that I might relaxed so much that that reality

1432
01:22:49.321 --> 01:22:51.020
might never have occurred.
So you know,

1433
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:53.820
that's why you can't go back in the time machine and step on the butterfly.

1434
01:22:53.821 --> 01:22:58.440
You'll screw up everything.
So I won't go back and tell myself that Tam,

1435
01:22:58.441 --> 01:22:59.580
because I'll screw up my future.

1436
01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:03.160
<v 0>That's right.
But if there's an aircraft carrier headed back to Pearl Harbor,</v>

1437
01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:04.870
you'll at least sit down and watch the,

1438
01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:08.530
<v 2>I don't know how I,
I don't know how I can apply that.</v>

1439
01:23:09.630 --> 01:23:11.500
Come up with a good concept that I'm here.

1440
01:23:12.270 --> 01:23:14.970
<v 0>So then this,
this has been a lot of fun.</v>

1441
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:17.490
I want people to listen to more of your stuff.

1442
01:23:17.670 --> 01:23:20.490
What episodes would you like people to listen to?

1443
01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:23.700
What's the starter kit if you want to get people hooked?

1444
01:23:23.850 --> 01:23:25.140
I have my own thoughts but,

1445
01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:29.100
but what episodes of hardcore history would you recommend people start with?

1446
01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:33.150
<v 2>Well,
I wouldn't start with the really old ones because I don't think they are</v>

1447
01:23:33.151 --> 01:23:37.050
representative of what we've evolved into.
It's not that I don't like them,

1448
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.501
it just,

1449
01:23:37.501 --> 01:23:41.250
I think that people who liked the really old episodes sometimes miss the way

1450
01:23:41.251 --> 01:23:45.360
they sounded and the people that like the current ones don't as much like the

1451
01:23:45.361 --> 01:23:46.830
old ones.
So I'd still,

1452
01:23:46.831 --> 01:23:49.980
I'd start with something new just because if you like that you might get more of

1453
01:23:49.981 --> 01:23:52.380
it.
If you listen to the old stuff,
you're not getting any more of that.

1454
01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:57.870
I think I would simply pick it based on the subject matters.
So pick,

1455
01:23:58.050 --> 01:23:59.340
we have a certain number of shows.

1456
01:23:59.341 --> 01:24:02.790
We usually leave the new shows up for a year or two before we,

1457
01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:05.700
or three before we were moved them to the paid archives.

1458
01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:08.100
So we should have a decent mix of things.

1459
01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:10.770
We do something called blitz additions sometimes,

1460
01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:13.680
which we're supposed to be shorter but they aren't shorter.
Uh,

1461
01:24:13.710 --> 01:24:15.960
cause I'm too long winded.
But,
but they just,

1462
01:24:15.961 --> 01:24:18.600
they turned out to be about slightly different focuses.

1463
01:24:18.601 --> 01:24:20.430
So instead of focusing on an event,

1464
01:24:20.850 --> 01:24:24.600
one of the blitz additions that we did focused on,
you know,

1465
01:24:24.601 --> 01:24:27.420
where people in the old days tougher than we are.

1466
01:24:28.190 --> 01:24:32.400
I think the question we asked is could you beat your grandparents in a war?

1467
01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:36.710
And then we did another one on,
I think we called it intoxicated priority.
Oh No.

1468
01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:40.290
History under the influence we called it and it was the hidden effect of

1469
01:24:40.291 --> 01:24:42.780
intoxicating substances may be on the past.

1470
01:24:43.050 --> 01:24:48.030
And so those are the wave blitz additions.
More look at weird subjects like that.

1471
01:24:48.031 --> 01:24:50.640
And then the other episodes look at historical events.

1472
01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:54.630
So I would say pick one that sounds like it's an interesting piece of subject

1473
01:24:54.631 --> 01:24:56.610
matter and then keep your fingers crossed that we,

1474
01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:00.110
that we pulled off that episode halfway decently and that's how I would

1475
01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:02.950
<v 0>do.
And that's the,
that's the gateway drug into hardcore history.</v>

1476
01:25:02.951 --> 01:25:06.850
I would say for those interested in my personal recommendations,

1477
01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:09.700
I have yet to dislike any of the episodes.

1478
01:25:10.210 --> 01:25:13.450
I think wrath of the cons is,
is outstanding.

1479
01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:18.340
If you're interested in in warfare and tactics and uh,
the lore of,

1480
01:25:18.370 --> 01:25:23.150
uh,
not Gingiss Khan,
but Genghis Khan,
I guess it turns out then I,

1481
01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:27.700
I think that's a fantastic series of the prophets of doom.
I got to say,

1482
01:25:27.701 --> 01:25:31.650
I know you,
I know,
I know you weren't happy with it for whatever reason.
Uh,

1483
01:25:31.651 --> 01:25:32.890
I know you have your reasons,
but

1484
01:25:32.940 --> 01:25:36.010
<v 2>no,
I'll tell you why.
I'll tell you why.
Because I was saving that story.</v>

1485
01:25:36.011 --> 01:25:41.011
That is one of the great twisted history stories of all time and I remember

1486
01:25:41.381 --> 01:25:42.640
thinking to myself,
okay,

1487
01:25:42.641 --> 01:25:46.900
you are halfway to a good show before you say your first words with this story.

1488
01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:51.730
And so I had really high hopes for how great cause it's just the story itself is

1489
01:25:51.731 --> 01:25:53.500
so wonderful.
You don't need Dan Carlin,

1490
01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:55.820
<v 0>you're too much performance anxiety.</v>

1491
01:25:57.770 --> 01:26:01.760
I really enjoyed that episode.
You teased the hell out of it.

1492
01:26:01.761 --> 01:26:06.560
In the beginning I got to say was I was getting antsy for for a little bit in

1493
01:26:06.561 --> 01:26:07.450
the very beginning,

1494
01:26:07.570 --> 01:26:09.220
<v 2>but it's giving you context though.</v>

1495
01:26:09.221 --> 01:26:12.600
You have to understand that the reformation for that thing.

1496
01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:17.560
<v 0>Oh No,
I love the reformation,
but uh,
the,
the lead is fantastic.</v>

1497
01:26:17.561 --> 01:26:19.660
I'm not going to give away too much of the story.

1498
01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:22.600
<v 2>I would tell you,
listen,
don't listen to that when there's too much setup.</v>

1499
01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:23.633
<v 0>Uh,</v>

1500
01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:29.970
so I'm going to let people explore where can people best find you on the

1501
01:26:29.971 --> 01:26:32.910
interwebs?
Where would you like people to find you online?

1502
01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:34.630
<v 2>Listen,
you can,
you can,
uh,</v>

1503
01:26:34.670 --> 01:26:38.330
you can get the free shows from our website@dancarlin.com.

1504
01:26:38.331 --> 01:26:40.310
There were obviously on iTunes as well.

1505
01:26:40.311 --> 01:26:42.860
You can get the old shows off our website.
Uh,

1506
01:26:42.970 --> 01:26:45.020
I think they were a little cheaper off our website,

1507
01:26:45.021 --> 01:26:46.700
but you can get them on iTunes as well.

1508
01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:50.480
Type my name into the search engine somewhere,
the right thing you should pop up.

1509
01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:54.410
Uh,
listen,
I'm just happy you're sharing my stuff with your listeners.

1510
01:26:54.411 --> 01:26:55.700
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

1511
01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:56.940
<v 0>Oh,
my pleasure.
This,</v>

1512
01:26:56.941 --> 01:27:01.941
I just having attempted to do some form of a podcast myself now for a little bit

1513
01:27:02.011 --> 01:27:04.290
and having listened to a lot of podcasts,

1514
01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:09.480
the amount of effort that you've put into each of these episodes is I think

1515
01:27:10.230 --> 01:27:14.190
magnitudes of order better than most audio books.
And that's saying,
well,

1516
01:27:14.191 --> 01:27:15.180
I've listened to hundreds,

1517
01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:18.130
<v 2>Oh man,
think about this.
This is the real key.</v>

1518
01:27:18.131 --> 01:27:22.690
The real key is that we live in an era where we can do this stuff because I can

1519
01:27:22.691 --> 01:27:23.530
tell you right now,

1520
01:27:23.531 --> 01:27:27.880
you look at podcasting and there's about 20 or 30 really creative podcasts out

1521
01:27:27.881 --> 01:27:31.770
there that you would never be allowed to do in a million years in the movie of

1522
01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:35.230
20 years ago.
And yet when you listen to them,
you just think is just brilliant,

1523
01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:38.980
right?
And so if we're lucky enough to be in that category where you go,
oh gosh,

1524
01:27:38.981 --> 01:27:41.470
this is something that would never be in the mainstream media,

1525
01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:45.250
and I'm so glad I found it,
then we're really fortunate.
I,
I,
to me,

1526
01:27:45.251 --> 01:27:48.400
that's as somebody who came from that media and by the time I left it,

1527
01:27:48.401 --> 01:27:52.170
it was so the opposite of creative.
The fact that we could,

1528
01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:55.000
we've got this blank canvas where we can be creative again.

1529
01:27:55.001 --> 01:27:56.440
What a great time to live,
right?

1530
01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:01.630
<v 0>Oh,
it's amazing.
It's amazing.
I mean,
you've got,
you know,
everything from,</v>

1531
01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:05.710
of course,
what you might expect,
like the,
this American life,
uh,

1532
01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:09.370
to say welcome to Nightvale,
which is like one of the weirdest things imaginable,

1533
01:28:09.371 --> 01:28:13.390
which is a,
as it stands,
I mean,
always in the top 10 on iTunes.

1534
01:28:13.930 --> 01:28:17.940
It's a hell of an open playing field.
And like you said,
narrow casting,
it's,
uh,

1535
01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:19.800
it's,
it's just ripe for the picking.

1536
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:21.490
People can be as weird as they want to be in.

1537
01:28:21.491 --> 01:28:23.670
They'll find their audience if they're passionate enough about it.

1538
01:28:23.950 --> 01:28:26.500
<v 2>Well,
listen,
if you're gifted,
I always think about it this way.</v>

1539
01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:30.550
Can you imagine someone has gifted as Eddie Murphy when he first showed up on

1540
01:28:30.551 --> 01:28:33.670
the comedy scene,
or Richard Pryor when he first showed up at the comedy scene.

1541
01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:38.500
If they simply,
you know,
the,
the Mike can be bad,
the audio can be bad.

1542
01:28:38.501 --> 01:28:40.960
You might not get shows out very frequently,

1543
01:28:41.110 --> 01:28:45.250
but if Eddie Murphy were simply doing a podcast today when he first started out,

1544
01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:50.560
that would be his ticket to fame and fortune without ever needing to make it on

1545
01:28:50.561 --> 01:28:53.410
a Saturday night live first or anything like that.
I mean,
this is,

1546
01:28:53.530 --> 01:28:55.960
this is direct media to the public.

1547
01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:59.620
We've never had it like this and I'm not even sure it's going to last.
This is,

1548
01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:02.370
this may be a wonderful little golden opportunity

1549
01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:04.410
<v 0>in human communication.
Take advantage.</v>

1550
01:29:04.411 --> 01:29:08.280
Now if you've ever thought of having a podcast,
it's a good time to get in.
Yeah,

1551
01:29:08.490 --> 01:29:12.480
absolutely.
Well then this has been a blast.
I really appreciate your time.

1552
01:29:12.481 --> 01:29:17.481
I'm going to continue to listen again to the entire series of wrath of the gods,

1553
01:29:18.210 --> 01:29:20.880
which I use for my morning walks.
Everybody,

1554
01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:23.940
everybody as twisted as me.
I know,

1555
01:29:23.941 --> 01:29:26.180
I know you're going to start getting weird letters from Mason,

1556
01:29:26.190 --> 01:29:28.440
but I recommend everybody check it out.

1557
01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:31.080
And if you've ever thought of starting a podcast,

1558
01:29:31.081 --> 01:29:35.460
well maybe now's the time to do it and I'll be writing a lot more about that.

1559
01:29:35.461 --> 01:29:38.340
So then I appreciate it.
I will,
uh,

1560
01:29:38.370 --> 01:29:40.920
I will talk to you soon and a really good hanging out.

1561
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:43.890
Thank you very much for having me on,
man.
It looks continuous success.

1562
01:29:43.891 --> 01:29:48.300
You're doing great.
Thanks man.
I'm,
uh,
I'm just,
uh,
I'm stolen the training wheels,

1563
01:29:48.301 --> 01:29:52.320
but I'm learning as I go,
so thanks.
Thanks again.
I'll talk to you soon.
Anytime.

1564
01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:53.333
All right.
