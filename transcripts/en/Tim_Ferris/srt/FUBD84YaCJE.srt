1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,920
I will just do a sound check. What did
you have for breakfast this morning

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,501
for breakfast?

3
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:09,501
I had a cup of coffee with two shots
and heavy cream and actually uh,

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,870
an Americano with two shots of coffee
and heavy cream and I had a smoothie with

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,700
apple and yogurt and some shit and it,

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,130
well we, we will talk more about the
shit part. Uh, that, that's good.

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:26,973
It's going to be real

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,520
relevant to mold at this altitude.

9
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:33,730
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,980
No,
it just seem like

11
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,080
I'm a cybernetic organism
living this show metal go up.

12
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,100
This episode is brought to you by
Athletic Greens. I get asked all the time,

13
00:00:55,101 --> 00:00:57,260
if you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

14
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,200
And my answer is
inevitably Athletic Greens,

15
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:02,690
it is your all in one
nutritional insurance.

16
00:01:02,691 --> 00:01:05,600
I recommended it in the four hour
body did not get paid for that.

17
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,450
And I travel with it
to avoid getting sick.

18
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,450
I take it in the mornings to
ensure optimal performance.

19
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,920
It just covers all my basis.

20
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,940
If I can't get what I need through whole
food meals throughout the rest of the

21
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,800
day, and you can get 50 oh my

Hello my lazy kittens.

48
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,290
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss show where

49
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:04,291
I attempt in each interview to deconstruct
world class performers to tease out

50
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,690
the things you can use,
not just act with integrity,

51
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:10,180
but what does that actually
mean on a daily basis?

52
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:12,940
What are your morning routines?
What are your habits?

53
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,070
What are your favorite books?
What are your influences,

54
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,890
what are your favorite documentaries,
so on and so forth.

55
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,930
I really want specific tactics that you
guys can apply toolkits that you can use

56
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,420
in your daily life and lives.

57
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,620
That's a plural for you guys and
this episode is no exception.

58
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:34,650
I'm very excited to have Sophia Amoruso
that's at Sophia underscore Emma Russo

59
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,610

fastest growing retailer in 2012 by ink

Thanks.

64
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:57,190
I suppose in part two it's
11200% three year growth rate.

65
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,850
It's a very big number.
Sophia has been called to quote fashions,

73
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:27,850
We talk about tactics testing,
the genesis story of Nasty Gal,

74
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,740
early successes, early mistakes, uh,

75
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,730
the last time she accidentally
crapped in her pants.

76
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:39,010
We really go all over the place and
there is a lot of personality in this

this conversation with Sophia. Amoruso.

79
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,880
Sophia, welcome to the show.
Hi Tim, how are you? I am,

80
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,400
I'm fantastic and uh,

81
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,410
we've had such an adventure putting this
together and getting all the tech to

82
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:07,200
work, but I'm stoked to be chatting
with you. I've wanted to have a,

83
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,930
a, a jam session with you for so long
and I know we've met very briefly before,

84
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,670
but, uh, let's,

85
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,700
let's start with some basics for people
who may not be familiar with you and,

86
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,970
and I know your role has changed
in the last, uh, year or so,

87
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:25,390
but when people ask you, what do
you do, how do you answer that? Now.

88
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,010
And how did you answer that two years ago?

89
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,660
If I don't know them,

90
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:32,290
I just say like I have an online fashion
business and I try to leave it at that

91
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,580
and if they ask, it
depends on who it is. Um,

92
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,480
but I started a company called Nasty
Gal in 2006 as an Ebay store selling

93
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:43,480
vintage clothing and you know,
whatever,

94
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,810
like all a lot of entrepreneurs
just did everything myself.

95
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:47,980
Did what needed to happen.

96
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,600
Just ran a little ebay store but
it wasn't little for very long. Um,

97
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,900
left Ebay about a year and a half later
and launched nasty gal.com which is now

98
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,940
kind of a full on fashion ecommerce,
commerce,

99
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,600
a destination.
We carry brands,

100
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,650
we design our own product and
we still sell vintage. Um,

101
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,170
and I guess I'm an author,
so there's that too.

102
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:16,490
I wrote a book last year that
spent a bunch of time on the,

103
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,040
on the bestseller list and
it was called girl boss.

104
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,430
It's called Hashtag girl boss, but thing
Hashtag out loud. It's kind of weird.

105
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,120
I mean you're a multihyphenate,

106
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:32,020
you've done a lot to to put
some numbers or stats to it. Uh,

107
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,240
and I'm reading off of a, just the
reading that I've done, so I'd love for,

108
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,501
feel free to correct me,

109
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:42,501
but it sounds like company has
customers in more than 60 countries.

110
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,040
It was the fastest growing retailer
in 2012 according to ink magazine.

111
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,473
Uh,

112
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:53,340
and I guess at one point at
least it sounds like, and again,

113
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,660
I'm reading from online, so who
knows how verified this is. But, uh,

114
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,990
I guess in 2011 when it was
started in 2006 and by 2011,

115
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,480
revenue is like 24 million or so marking
I guess in 11,000 plus three year

116
00:07:09,931 --> 00:07:14,100
growth rate. So very impressive
stuff. Uh, very impressive. Uh,

117
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,970
and the, uh, I have to,

118
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,560
I cannot resist asking about some of these
bullets before we get into that whole

119
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:25,320
story. I apologize in advance. So for,

120
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:28,830
for those who are wondering how
this podcast gets put together, uh,

121
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:32,580
I usually like to,
not not rehearsed,

122
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:36,600
but send some prompts for
guests are on the show.

123
00:07:36,601 --> 00:07:41,010
So one of the sentences that I send out
is can you please send some bullets with

124
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:44,220
a handful of topics and are questions
that will lead to actionable tips, advice,

125
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,210
comma, funny stories, comma or
resource and how to recommendations.

126
00:07:48,211 --> 00:07:49,680
So funny stories.

127
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:55,110
The first I just went straight for
funding. Oh No, it was awesome.

128
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,430
So I'm just going to read the first five
and then we're going to dig into one.

129
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,610
So bullet number one,
I once poop my pants in high school.

130
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,040
We're going to come back to that.
Number two.

131
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,470
I have three poodles that are all related.
Number three,

132
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:08,281
and I'm paraphrasing here,

133
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:11,730
I lived on a street called called orange
blossom twice in different parts of

134
00:08:11,731 --> 00:08:16,390
California. I love Karaoke and
the then the, the last bill it,

135
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:16,820
I'll read it.

136
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,070
I'm a big supporter of reality TV because
it's cheaper and healthier than weed

137
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:24,660
or alcohol.
So people love the embarrassing stories.

138
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:26,220
I woke up this morning for the first time,

139
00:08:26,221 --> 00:08:29,700
I just adopted a rescue puppy about
six weeks ago. She's five months old.

140
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,240
I woke up and she's never pooped
in the house and woke up and she,

141
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,490
she's been crate trained
and looking at the crate,

142
00:08:38,491 --> 00:08:42,660
it looked like someone had taken a
handful of mud and throwing it into a

143
00:08:42,661 --> 00:08:47,610
Cuisinart. She somehow managed
to diarrhea in every direction,

144
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:52,230
including on the top of the cage. I don't
know how this is possible. Yeah, yeah.

145
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,860
Unless you're like a Cirque de
Solei athlete who's had whatever,

146
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,940
a two I should drink. But in any case,
so this is on the mind, obviously,

147
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:03,990
it's all clean up. She's
fine. She's chilling. Molly's
good. But tell me about this,

148
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:07,440
this high school incident.
I, uh, I have to,

149
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,720
I have to ask since it was sent over.

150
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,730
Oh my God. Well, um, I
was at this guy's house.

151
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,760
I was like 16 years old.
I was at this guy's house who was like,

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,720
it's amazing basis. He played this thing
called a war guitar, which is base.

153
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,500
It's like a, it's like a
base with, I don't have a ton
of strings on it. And you,

154
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,850
it's, you basically just play
the fret board. And he was
just thinking, it's weird.

155
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:34,770
Like proggy musician and I thought
was super cool. Um, and he was like,

156
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,780
I don't know, maybe he was like 19.
I thought that was amazing. And, um,

157
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,970
I went to his house, he like lived with
his dad and got there like, I don't know,

158
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:49,170
after like 15 minutes and my
stomach was just like, uh, oh. Um,

159
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,450
I had eaten some,
some pepperoni pizza.

160
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:56,040
I think like the kind that has cheese
that you can almost drank, like not, um,

161
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,570
not the, not like, you know,

162
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,400
not like Boutiquey La Pizza or
whatever. It's like, it was like,

163
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,870
it was like gnarly pepperoni pizza, just
like mouthfuls of cheese. Anyway. Um,

164
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,300
I was like, oh no, I don't want
to use this guy's bathroom.

165
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:11,790
I'm not sure what's going on here,
but I should probably leave.

166
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:16,720
So after like 15 minutes at
his house, I, I left, um,

167
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,780
and I started driving down the
street. It wasn't like, oh Geeze,

168
00:10:19,781 --> 00:10:22,740
well if I find a toilet then I'll
be happy about it. It was like, oh,

169
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:24,850
I really need it toilet.
Um,

170
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,040
and I stopped at this liquor store
and walked inside and I was like,

171
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,290
do you guys have a restroom I can
use? And they were like, no, sorry.

172
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,120
It's for employees only.
I thought age,

173
00:10:34,121 --> 00:10:37,080
it would have been confusing if I had
like lied and said I was pregnant.

174
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,040
I've done that before. Um, oh,
you won an awful person. Oh.

175
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,700
Um, and then so I got
back in my car and drove,

176
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:51,560
I was in like 1991 Honda civic with
a little like, like a little like,

177
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,850
like a racing steering wheel.
It was pretty funny. Um,

178
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,830
and I drove it on the street and stopped
at a gas station and got out and it was

179
00:10:58,831 --> 00:11:03,590
like step step, frankly, just like, oh,

180
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,460
I didn't even make it inside.
And it was just like, you know,

181
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:10,140
when something like that happens to you,

182
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,250
you wonder if you're going to spend
the rest of your life doing that like

183
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:17,080
uncontrollably because it's just
so, it's so shocking. Like it,

184
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,530
it just shouldn't happen. Um, and, and I,

185
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:25,290
I just like I had to get back in my
car and like finish, like finish.

186
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,360
And then I had to drive home and,
and you know, sitting in my, in my,

187
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm sorry. That's, that's,
that's, that's my pitch.

188
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,740
I apologize for that.
But so you see

189
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,050
same story

190
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,293
and uh,

191
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:47,310
so I have number of friends
who swapped the stories.

192
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:52,350
Sorry, my dog's freaking
out guys. Ah, okay.

193
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:56,800
This is a podcast verite.
Uh, are you there?

194
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:01,390
Yeah. Okay. Coming back
to the topic at hand.

195
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:06,370
So I have a number of friends who are
athletes and I've been competitive

196
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:11,371
athletes and guys take all sorts of
disgusting preworkout products and so on.

197
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:15,370
And these guys trade stories
of what they call fouling out.

198
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:18,800
So what happened to you? They would
call fouling out and, Oh my God,

199
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:24,770
I'm not alone. People are out there.
No, you're not alone. And, um, so I'll,

200
00:12:24,771 --> 00:12:28,720
I'll trade of just a really quick one
because I think that most guys who've

201
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:33,490
tried to gain muscle and taken a lot
of horrible supplements will somehow

202
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:37,600
identify with this. So I was on my
way driving on my way to Sfo, right?

203
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:42,370
Driving to the airport. And I had
had a bunch of creatine monohydrate,

204
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:46,660
a bunch of coffee,
and then I think what's called MCT oil,

205
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:51,340
which is the ultimate recipe for disaster
pants. I now realize in retrospect,

206
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,260
but got halfway to the airport,

207
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:57,840
I'm racing to the flight deck and had
the exact experience that you did like

208
00:12:57,841 --> 00:13:00,680
just viciously shat myself.
And so I,

209
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,290
it's like throwing up,
it comes in waves.

210
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,540
Oh I was the worst. That's
like throwing up. It's so true.

211
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:11,541
So then I had to basically like
clean myself up with my own boxers,

212
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,920
like running to the airport,

213
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,670
get through security and
then go deal with myself.

214
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,880
But so for those people out there who've
had this experience, you're not alone.

215
00:13:20,881 --> 00:13:24,870
And that what you said also like the
steps kind of like steps, step, Bang.

216
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:31,250
It made me think of like San Francisco
Doula midwifery and whatnot because

217
00:13:31,951 --> 00:13:35,220
they're like, oh, when you're
trying to have a natural birth,

218
00:13:35,221 --> 00:13:36,060
if you're doing it at home,

219
00:13:36,061 --> 00:13:40,560
you can have a pregnant woman like
walk on a curb just like one foot on,

220
00:13:40,561 --> 00:13:45,390
one foot off. And that's a one way to
like kind of pop the baby out. So wow.

221
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,860
You know, all kinds of stuff. Well, yeah,

222
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,200
for our baby before baby
sounds like a horrible tragedy.

223
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,110
Uh,
but uh,

224
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,830
how did the business start in yet?

225
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,630
And I think a lot of people know, they
know you, they know your photograph,

226
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,670
they've seen the book.
Uh,

227
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,930
they're very familiar with the company
as it exists now. But like what was the,

228
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:15,060
what was the moment in which you
decided to start selling clothing?

229
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,410
Yeah. Um, I'd never worked in a club
thing store and it wasn't, you know,

230
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,620
this is the, Ebay was definitely not
my way into the fashion industry.

231
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:27,150
That was not my intention.
I just was kind of flailing.

232
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:28,530
I want it to be a photographer,

233
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:32,880
but I figuring out how to like schmooze
in the art world or talk about my

234
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:37,020
photography and make stuff up about why
it was important or all of that stuff

235
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:39,270
just seemed like now,
right for me.

236
00:14:39,271 --> 00:14:42,300
And not like people were
inviting me to do shows,

237
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,930
although I did have a show at Adobe
books before they went extinct.

238
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,860
Do you ever go there?

239
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,360
No, this is, this is here in the bay area.

240
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,090
Yeah. It was a super cool book
store in San, but I don't know,

241
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:57,050
I was like working at the Academy of Art
University in downtown San Francisco.

242
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,130
On how, how old were you at that
point? I was 22. Okay. Got It.

243
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,890
And I got that job because I
needed to have a hernia fixed.

244
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:07,030
I don't know how I got a hernia,
but I had no health insurance.

245
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:10,520
I had to get a job so I could get health
insurance so I could get my hernia

246
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:11,354
fixed.

247
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,310
And I had to work at this job for
three months to get health insurance.

248
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,720
So I did,

249
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,170
but I was working in the lobby just
like checking student ids and sometimes

250
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:25,910
worked like late at night
and was [inaudible] had time
to kill on the Internet.

251
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,270
Um, and was getting friend
requests on my space.

252
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:32,840
I'm not sure if anyone remembers.
I'm kidding.

253
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,530
Um, and so I was getting friend requests
on my space from Ebay sellers that were

254
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:44,531
promoting their businesses on my space
and I wore almost entirely vintage at the

255
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:47,570
time and I knew where to find it.

256
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,630
And I saw the prices that these vintage
pieces were fetching on Ebay and said,

257
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:59,000
hey, you know, I can find them for way
cheaper. Um, I know how to take a picture.

258
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,780
I'm pretty sure I know how to
use the Internet. Um, and Ebay,

259
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,700
Ebay was a great place to start.
You know,

260
00:16:04,701 --> 00:16:08,500
there's a kind of like a
framework for you to sell online.

261
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:13,100
It's really easy today. But then building
a website like a web shop wasn't,

262
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,050
you know,
it wasn't as easy.

263
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,370
So I started with Ebay and you also
have a built in customer base there.

264
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:21,020
You put something and you can test,

265
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,070
you can test like what works
or if people like your taste,

266
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,080
your taste or what you
have to bring to the table.

267
00:16:27,081 --> 00:16:30,950
So I bought on Ebay for dummies and uh,

268
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,580
had a friend model for free, you
know, and just found some vintage,

269
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:37,120
sold some of my stuff.
And it was very, you know,

270
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,320
you can get a read on
what people like really,

271
00:16:39,321 --> 00:16:42,220
really quickly on Ebay because
they watch stuff. Right.

272
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,660
There's something called watching,
which is basically like you're,

273
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,000
you're like monitoring it.
Are you adding to your favorites?

274
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:50,930
You want to see what happens with the
auction over the course of the week or 10

275
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:51,764
days?

276
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,950
How did you know where
to find vintage clothing?

277
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,630
I, it was like all I wore,
so I just, I had spent,

278
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:02,750
I've just spent my youth in thrift stores,
like discovering,

279
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,810
just unearthing stuff
that no one else wanted,

280
00:17:05,811 --> 00:17:09,430
that I thought it was really special
and I made a, made a career out of it.

281
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,750
Did you have a favorite thrift
store at the time? In the bay area?

282
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,230
Um, let me think. Uh,

283
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,200
at the time, I don't know. No,

284
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,460
none of them are just, none of them
are a real like gold mine anymore.

285
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,290
I like to state sales a lot because you
can encounter people who have no idea

286
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,960
what they have that's
becoming rarer and rarer.

287
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:38,670
And thrift stores are like onto
vintage being valuable. Um,

288
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,370
how would you find at the time,
how would you find the estate sales?

289
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,660
Just look in the newspaper or like a
craigslist. I'm nothing man. I'm chilling.

290
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,240
Yeah. Craigslist and the newspaper. Yeah.

291
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,170
And I like line up with all these
people that were, I don't know,

292
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:55,530
way older than me at like 6:00
AM to be the first people in.

293
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:59,640
And I just run straight for the closet
and hope whoever died had great style.

294
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,300
I saw the end. I didn't watch,
I didn't see the entire thing.

295
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:09,510
My girlfriend is watching it at the
end of this documentary about a,

296
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,340
I want to say a fashion icon named Iris
who's now or when it was recorded or

297
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:17,940
filmed in her nineties 93
and she has awesome style,

298
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:22,020
but I think it'll be hard to get to
her estate still. I, yeah. So you got,

299
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,880
you get Ebay for dummies,

300
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,390
you know where to find
the vintage clothing.

301
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,730
Um, take a picture. No,
I how to take a picture

302
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:37,410
and you're getting an indication of
what works or what people are at least

303
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:40,890
interested in. Right through
the watching. What was,

304
00:18:40,891 --> 00:18:43,890
do you remember your first sale
or your first day of sales?

305
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,340
Yeah, it was like, well it was, uh,
it was, it was a week of auctions.

306
00:18:48,341 --> 00:18:51,110
So I watched what happened over the
course of the week. And at the very end,

307
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,850
some stuff goes crazy because people swoop
in at the last minute trying to steal

308
00:18:55,851 --> 00:19:00,260
it from whoever was in the lead. And,
you know, sometimes nothing happens,

309
00:19:00,261 --> 00:19:03,110
but I learned really quickly what,
you know,

310
00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:06,920
what was working and what wasn't
and tweak that, you know, every,

311
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,530
with every auction,
with everything I,

312
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,690
I bought and I watched my competitors
and I watched what they were doing and I

313
00:19:13,731 --> 00:19:17,390
just, I tried to do a
better job and I don't know

314
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,740
what, what, uh,

315
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:23,860
what are some examples of maybe some
of the things that you noticed in those

316
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,960
initial tests and that
you could be better at?

317
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,310
Yeah.
Um,

318
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,800
well the thumbnails are the
thing that attract that Amy, you,

319
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,080
you evaluate everything
as you browse Ebay,

320
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:39,750
buy a thumbnail and the title of the item.

321
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,790
And those are two things that you can
optimize just to kind of infinity.

322
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,440
I mean there's a limited amount of space,

323
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:51,441
but I knew that using images that were
really bright where you could see the

324
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:54,390
silhouette of the item,
Ebay thumbnails had gotten a lot bigger,

325
00:19:54,391 --> 00:19:58,230
but at the time they were
teeny tiny, teeny tiny. Um,

326
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:02,940
so making it really obvious what the,
what the item was and even showing,

327
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,340
you know, I had a, uh,

328
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,440
I would split the image in half and
have half of the thumbnail be a full,

329
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,060
like a full length shot of the item.

330
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,530
And then I'd have like a detail shot
like on the maybe the right hand side and

331
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:19,880
the description. So I mean,
the selling vintage is,

332
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,910
is such an incredible way
to learn perceived value
because unless you're selling

333
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:27,720
something that's like a designer,
like a Chanel jacket or whatever,

334
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,830
you're buying stuff that you're buying
it for the style and you're buying things

335
00:20:31,831 --> 00:20:33,930
that have no inherent value,
that could be,

336
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,040
that are really are someone
else's throwaway and
exalting them to a level that

337
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:41,970
makes them worth more and,
and worth more. I mean,

338
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,100
Eva was the customer who
determined the price.

339
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:46,860
They started everything at
nine 99 and let them choose,

340
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,460
I'll let them fight over it,

341
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,350
but only they only thought over it
because I turned it into something really

342
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:54,650
special.
Um,

343
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,420
and I breathed new life into
these forgotten about things.

344
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,060
And what were, I mean,
as a, as a copywriter,

345
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,450
how did you accomplish that?
Um,

346
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,870
and maybe that's a nonspecific
question that's unhelpful.

347
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:14,050
I'm just first for instance. I
mean a lot of people bring up, uh,

348
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,030
I think it's influenced by Robert
Kel Deni and they talk about,

349
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,800
say you'd get a scarcity
time, restrictions, et Cetera,

350
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:27,630
eh, as sort of tools of persuasion that
can be used for, for good or ill means.

351
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,830
Um, but there, what did you, how did
you learn to write persuasive copy?

352
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,920
Um, I don't know. My mom
was a writer and write it.

353
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:40,520
Reading and writing was always, I
mean, it sounds like so, so basic,

354
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:45,140
but it was just something that she
always took a lot of pride in. And,

355
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:49,730
um, something that I really cared
about and I guess I had a voice.

356
00:21:49,731 --> 00:21:52,580
I didn't realize that until
later on when I re, you know,

357
00:21:52,581 --> 00:21:57,170
when I realized it was building a brand
because there were so many specific

358
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:02,060
things that were, had become
part of the nasty y'all DNA. Um,

359
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:06,140
but you can take something
that may be like an eighties,

360
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,060
like big ass, you know, coat
KP thing that, you know,

361
00:22:11,061 --> 00:22:15,220
some, you know, overweight
lady might've bought. Um,

362
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,110
and turn it into like this,
like avant garde. I mean,

363
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:21,740
you can use a word like avant garde for
something that could be perceived as

364
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:23,780
like outdated and funky
on the wrong person,

365
00:22:23,781 --> 00:22:28,430
like a lady with a perm or just like the
coolest thing on some like kid with a

366
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:33,050
weird haircut, you know, on the
sidewalk. So it's all about context,

367
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,400
right?
Yeah.

368
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:38,220
So a couple of things. Um, the,

369
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,380
the first is thumbnails. We're
doing this over Skype, uh,

370
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,850
for those people who always ask me,

371
00:22:44,851 --> 00:22:49,851
I'm using he cam call recorder to record
this and the Audio Technica Atr 2100

372
00:22:51,151 --> 00:22:54,300
Mike, which is about
60 bucks on Amazon. Uh,

373
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,360
but your thumbnail for Skype
is this rad looking chick.

374
00:23:01,441 --> 00:23:05,850
I don't know who, she is a
hoot. It's a bunch of bikers,

375
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:09,180
naked female bikers and one of them has,

376
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:13,290
it looks like a tattoo of flowers and
something over one breast and she's

377
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:16,170
holding a knife. I can't really
tell exactly what's going on.

378
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,600
Yep.
That's pretty accurate.

379
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,500
Where is this from or how did you,

380
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:25,610
um, so I'm, I'm working on,
I'm working on my second book.

381
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,780
Um,
and I've been like pulling images.

382
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:32,870
There's all kinds of inspiration.
Some of it will be used in the book.

383
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:37,760
And this is actually an image from
a movie called girl boss, Girl boss,

384
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:38,594
gorilla

385
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,800
gorilla, g. U. E. R.

386
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,660
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

387
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:48,661
So that was a film that I saw a long
time ago that was kind of the inspiration

388
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:52,550
for the name of girl boss.
And very few people know that

389
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,080
there's a whole genre of Japanese,
um,

390
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,950
like cinema called pinky
violence or just pinky films.

391
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:06,080
And it's pretty much like all female
revenge and like girl gangs and they're so

392
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:10,520
cool. Like they're super stylish and
Terentino's ripped a lot from them.

393
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,390
Um, and this, this one, this
is from girl boss gorilla,

394
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,960
I think battle royale,
I want to say is one of those comic books,

395
00:24:18,961 --> 00:24:20,370
one of the most violent.

396
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,590
Uh Huh.
I've seen it.

397
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,570
Violent things you could possibly imagine,

398
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:28,250
which makes you then think of some of
say the fight scenes in like kill bill in

399
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:31,880
some capacity. But coming back
to the writing for a second,

400
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,360
let me start with a question that I
always ask and we'll go from there.

401
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,840
What is the book that you've
gifted most to other people?

402
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,990
So the book that I have gifted
most to other people is uh,

403
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,730
the richest man in Babylon,

404
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:49,290
which I talk about in girl boss and it's
was written like a hundred years ago

405
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,210
and it's written as though it was
written in biblical times or something.

406
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,770
A parable.

407
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,810
Oh yeah, it's a parable or, yeah, it'd
be a parable. It'd be like the alchemist.

408
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,870
Yeah.
It's like,

409
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:05,870
it's basically parable set in ancient
times describing someone who goes about

410
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,840
this guy who goes about,
I forget his name,

411
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:12,090
trying to find out how he can make money.
How can you,

412
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,420
you can make a life for himself and
his family and he encounters all these

413
00:25:15,421 --> 00:25:20,410
different people and lessons along
the way. Um, and the advice is very,

414
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,540
there's some really simple advice like
save 10% of everything that you earn.

415
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,780
Don't take advice from the baker if
you want to be a cobbler, you know? Um,

416
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,420
and it's something that anyone can
read and understand. It's like a,

417
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,230
it's like a one hour or two hour read.

418
00:25:37,231 --> 00:25:41,100
It's the tiniest little book and a hundred
years later all of the advice still

419
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:44,250
holds up, which I find really
great. Um, and it's like a, it's a,

420
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,840
it's a cheap book and I'm a cheap
giver, so I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

421
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,080
So it would be that, it would
be that in my book, I guess

422
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,880
the richest man in Babylon. And
what, uh, what other writers,

423
00:25:56,881 --> 00:26:00,240
just from a writing perspective,
so you said your, uh,

424
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,420
you said your mother was
right or your father, my mom.

425
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,370
What type of writing did she do?

426
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:05,921
Well,

427
00:26:05,921 --> 00:26:10,450
she sold houses for a long time and
then kind of quit doing that and started

428
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:11,860
writing about real estate.

429
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:16,420
And now she writes about all kinds of
stuff and she's working on her own book.

430
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:20,840
Um, but yeah. Wait, what was the question?

431
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,820
The question was, I was, I was stuttering
and stammering my way to the question,

432
00:26:24,821 --> 00:26:29,821
which was what do you have any favorite
writers or writers that you admire have

433
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:33,520
influenced you?
Any of the above?

434
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:38,490
Yeah. So, uh, Rainer Maria Roca,

435
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,240
I think it's just such like, great.
Can you say that one more time please?

436
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:46,590
I think it's Maria Rilke. Oh
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Um,

437
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:50,670
so on love and other, what's
it called on loving other, um,

438
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,190
maybe it's just on love.
I don't know.

439
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:58,191
Everything I read almost like everything
that I learned from actually reading

440
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:00,750
things or,
um,

441
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:06,050
on earth thing culture happened before
I started the business because after,

442
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:11,220
basically, since I was 22, so
it's been almost a decade. Um,

443
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,290
I feel like my personal,
I dunno, my quest for,

444
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:21,120
for for knowledge was
fulfilled by all this shit,

445
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,600
all the challenges that come
with building a business.

446
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:29,630
And so things like books that I read for
fun and not books that I read to learn

447
00:27:29,911 --> 00:27:34,080
stuff kind of went out the door.
Right. It's like all nonfiction.

448
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,910
The discretionary extracurricular
just kind of got consumed,

449
00:27:38,911 --> 00:27:40,170
are displaced by the work

450
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,290
kind of.
Yeah.

451
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:44,800
It's like I only read things that I can
do something practical with now. Just,

452
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,960
I don't know, not, not, not something
that makes for a lot of relaxation, but

453
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,110
fun. So Rainer Maria,
Rilke, uh, if that's,

454
00:27:54,111 --> 00:27:55,580
I'm sure I'm pronouncing that incorrectly,

455
00:27:55,581 --> 00:27:59,570
but he's come up actually in my life
in the last 48 hours of a two separate

456
00:27:59,571 --> 00:28:03,560
people recommend reading. And I
did read this long, long time ago,

457
00:28:03,561 --> 00:28:07,670
but letters to a young
poet. Yes. From 1929. Uh,

458
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,410
so what did you do?

459
00:28:09,411 --> 00:28:11,690
You said it's not relaxing and I
know we're hopping around a lot,

460
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:14,870
but what do you do to relax?
Let's just say,

461
00:28:14,871 --> 00:28:19,871
looking back at some of the either tougher
periods or fastest growing periods in

462
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:24,130
your company, what did you
do to decompress? I mean,

463
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:28,010
when you felt overwhelmed or burned out,
what did you do?

464
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,330
How did you manage that?

465
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:34,240
God, sometimes you just kind of explode
and hopefully no one else is around.

466
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:39,160
Um, when I was like, I was
like crying last night. Uh,

467
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,120
also,

468
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,890
why were you crying last night?
I can't let that go.

469
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:47,380
Oh my God. I don't know. Just because,
because running a business is really hard.

470
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,840
Um, and what do you mean?
What do you do? I mean,

471
00:28:50,841 --> 00:28:52,880
do you cry for like five
minutes and you're done?

472
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:54,410
Do you cry for longer than that?
Do you?

473
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,540
Yeah, I cried for like five minutes and
then I was done. She was kind of like,

474
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:01,820
this feels good, so I'm going to just
let it happen for a second. Yeah. Um,

475
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,580
yeah. It's just like, fuck it.

476
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:09,570
It was just one of those
was the long day. Um, yeah.

477
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,460
But right now,

478
00:29:11,461 --> 00:29:16,461
the thing that relaxes me the most is to
tuning in and turning off with reality

479
00:29:17,761 --> 00:29:21,150
TV. Hmm. Uh, I don't know.

480
00:29:21,151 --> 00:29:24,690
I just finished watching the entire
season of the worst show. It's not,

481
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:29,250
the people are not even compelling.
They're like not funny. It's, it's,

482
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:33,240
it's so bad, but it, you can't stop
watching it. It's called dating naked,

483
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,200
eating naked. Oh my God. I've seen,

484
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,520
I remember I saw a few minutes of this
in like a waiting room at a doctor or

485
00:29:40,521 --> 00:29:42,310
something. And I was like,
that is the most ridiculous

486
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,560
premise I've ever seen,
but I couldn't stop watching it.

487
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,470
So dumb. So, um, but I can't,
you can't stop watching it.

488
00:29:49,471 --> 00:29:53,630
You're like, Ooh, they're buds. And you're
like, but I'm like watching this show.

489
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:59,050
I Dunno. Um, yeah. What else do I
do to relax? Hang out with my dogs?

490
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,680
They're cool.
Um,

491
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:04,620
these are, these are, these are
the three poodles that are related.

492
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,880
They're all siblings. Yeah.
And they're different ages.

493
00:30:07,881 --> 00:30:12,260
They're like from different letters,
but their parents like, yeah,

494
00:30:12,261 --> 00:30:13,520
their parents have been busy.

495
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,450
What are their,
what are their names?

496
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,300
Um,

497
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:21,300
Donna summer is the oldest one and she
was like three and the next one's cozy

498
00:30:22,271 --> 00:30:25,750
dozer and cozies like,
I dunno,

499
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:27,310
maybe just over a year old.

500
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:32,370
And then there's one named Gino who was
named after my husband's grandfather.

501
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,780
Um, and he's like, I don't
know, maybe eight months.

502
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:42,460
That's that. Gino, I want to talk about
naming cause naming and titling is really,

503
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:47,230
I, I've, I've enjoyed reading about how
you've gone about it in a few cases.

504
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:49,150
So the girl boss gorilla,
I had no idea.

505
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:53,170
So that's new and I need to get that
made into a poster in my house cause it's

506
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:56,770
amazing. Uh, second. So Gina's,

507
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,540
after the grandfather would
have with the two other dogs,

508
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,730
how did you come up with those names?
Or how were the named,

509
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,580
I dunno. Donna was just like,
well it was kind of like,

510
00:31:04,581 --> 00:31:08,060
can we name her Donna bummer. And then
it was like, but that's not very nice.

511
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:12,560
Caleb's name. They were Donna
summer. I Dunno. I Dunno why.

512
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,030
So it's like she's a cool
haircut and then a cozy,

513
00:31:18,031 --> 00:31:21,560
it was just like super sleepy. And
you know, when we brought Donna home,

514
00:31:21,561 --> 00:31:23,750
she was like screaming her head off,

515
00:31:23,751 --> 00:31:27,350
just like don't take me away
from my parents. And we were
like, oh no, we're awful.

516
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,850
And then we brought cozy, homey and cozy,
just like kind of slapped. There's no,

517
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:35,240
it was just like, I'm cool and she's still
like that. So it was just like, let's,

518
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,070
let's name our cozy dozer

519
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,500
cause he does her now. Nasty
Gal. [inaudible] this is Pete.

520
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,060
A lot of folks don't know the origin.
Where's the name from?

521
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,960
So the name Nasty Gal.
Um,

522
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,030
so I used to work at a record store in
San Francisco that's no longer around, um,

523
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,910
and Noe valley called street light
records and spent a lot of time,

524
00:31:56,911 --> 00:32:00,120
I think music was probably like
my first love way before fashion.

525
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:05,250
I'm not even sure if I'm in
love with fashion. Um, and this,

526
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,560
I'm not sure if it was
just reissued at that time,

527
00:32:07,561 --> 00:32:12,561
but I somehow on covered this album
called a nasty out by a woman named Betty

528
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:17,630
Davis, who I think is becoming,
become more well known. But, um,

529
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:22,830
she is the ex wife of miles Davis and
she's just like super outspoken funk

530
00:32:22,831 --> 00:32:27,450
singer with a really great band behind
her and just the Super Raunchy like

531
00:32:27,451 --> 00:32:31,050
awesome lyrics and she just
doesn't give a fuck. Um,

532
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,010
so when I was choosing a name for my
Ebay store, which I never thought I'd be,

533
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:38,580
you know, I never thought I'd be
talking about it this much, you know,

534
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,290
nine later you just fine.
I still like the name. Um,

535
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,140
I thought I thought nasty gal would be
good because there were so many other

536
00:32:45,141 --> 00:32:46,550
ebay sellers who,

537
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:50,750
whose business names were like lady
standing in the desk or you know, like,

538
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,630
or like lady in tall grass or like Boho,

539
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:58,250
just like so like Bohemian and kind
of like expected. And I was like,

540
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,740
I'm going to name it nasty
Gal. I Dunno. I'm just like,

541
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:06,160
I'm an m antagonistic and
I don't know I'm at work.

542
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:12,380
What uh, looking back at Nasty
Gal, I guess a couple of questions.

543
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,950
One is I've read in different places,

544
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:21,250
well different accounts of
this. Why Levy Vba? What uh,

545
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,460
what?
Yeah,

546
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:26,130
one second. Did I actually say that
she has an album called nasty gal?

547
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,060
Because I think I didn't,

548
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,180
cause I think I just talked
about this lady named Betty do.

549
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:33,300
Ah, all right, well that, that's
helpful to have that tidbit then.

550
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,900
So the album name is nasty
gal. Hence yes. Bang. Okay,

551
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,510
cool. Uh, the transition off of Ebay,

552
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,540
how did that have that happy? What's
the, what's the story behind that?

553
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,160
Well, it wasn't much of
a transition, you know,

554
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:51,410
I like to make promises that I'm not
sure I can keep and then figuring out how

555
00:33:51,411 --> 00:33:54,350
to keep them.
It's happened a few times in my life,

556
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,100
um,
that we will come back to that.

557
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,630
Yeah,
it's good.

558
00:33:58,631 --> 00:34:03,631
I think you can like will things into
happening by just like committing to them

559
00:34:04,301 --> 00:34:07,580
sometimes. Um, and so I was started,

560
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:12,360
started to promote the idea of this, you
know, coming soon. Nasty Gal, Dotcom,

561
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,900
Nasty Gal, vintage.com was actually the
first URL I had to buy nasty gal. Dot.

562
00:34:16,901 --> 00:34:21,310
Come from, you can guess who? Um, but I,

563
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:24,160
I had started to leave
feedback from my customers

564
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:28,850
second. All right. I actually
kick guess. I'm like, Bet Davis.

565
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,690
I can't imagine that's no.

566
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:36,770
Who did you have to buy from one of
the boring company? Yes. All right,

567
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,870
got it.
Can you do that through a broker?

568
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,820
Do you to reach out to
them directly or how did it

569
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,130
and did it through a broker.

570
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,053
Got It.

571
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,180
And where does someone find such a broker
to help them if they want to do that?

572
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,470
I don't remember. Someone introduced
me to this guy and it was like,

573
00:34:49,471 --> 00:34:50,790
it was $8,000.

574
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:55,850
Nice. That's a good investment
right there. So sorry to
interrupt, but I had to,

575
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:00,000
my head was spinning with all
these incorrect answers so,

576
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,570
so you get the domain
you've put up coming soon.

577
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,020
But at the domain domain. Yeah, coming
soon, you know, nasty gal vintage.

578
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,550
And I had started to leave feedback
for my customers on Ebay saying like,

579
00:35:10,551 --> 00:35:14,690
hey come come the coming soon as y'all
vantage.com. And I was like, Oh shit,

580
00:35:14,691 --> 00:35:18,440
I better build a website. Better
actually do this. So I figured it out.

581
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:22,190
I launched the website, um, and
when I launched the website,

582
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:26,810
Ebay decided to suspend me at around the
same time. So it was not a transition.

583
00:35:26,811 --> 00:35:29,840
It was literally like,
I'm going to try this website thing.

584
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:33,680
I hope I can go back to Ebay if it doesn't
work out. But it'd be, it was very,

585
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:37,440
it became apparent pretty quickly that
that wasn't going to be an option.

586
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:42,020
I got suspended for leaving a
URL in the feedback for yeah.

587
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:43,770
Ebay,

588
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:44,830
if it doesn't want to send,

589
00:35:44,831 --> 00:35:47,080
they don't want you sending
traffic off their website.

590
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,013
Yeah.

591
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,440
[inaudible] on the stealing our
customers a from there. Yeah,

592
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,040
nay on the Ebay.

593
00:35:55,910 --> 00:36:00,650
Right, exactly. Uh, so the,
so what the hell did you do?

594
00:36:00,651 --> 00:36:02,780
I mean if,
if suddenly Bam,

595
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,560
that entire ecosystem is turned off.

596
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,710
What happened in the next kind of like 24,
48 hours?

597
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:14,060
Um, I had, well some people, some,

598
00:36:14,061 --> 00:36:17,900
some editors had heard or seen on the my
space profile that I was going to watch

599
00:36:17,901 --> 00:36:22,460
your website and they did a little
coverage. I bet when they, when it,

600
00:36:22,461 --> 00:36:24,800
when it launched and it launched,
it was his kind of like,

601
00:36:24,801 --> 00:36:29,420
there was a lot of pent up demand I had,
I didn't know I would have any traffic,

602
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:31,430
but the website sold out just instantly.

603
00:36:31,431 --> 00:36:36,431
It was like an hour and there was maybe
150 items on the website when we launch,

604
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,530
but there's only one of each of those
things that are just one of a kind of,

605
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:44,531
you just 150 orders still seems like a
lot for your first day of doing business.

606
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:45,981
It was just like,

607
00:36:45,981 --> 00:36:49,730
I had like Kelly Ripa stylist calling
me asking if I had another one of those

608
00:36:49,731 --> 00:36:53,060
like extras though, isn't it like vintage
jacket and an extra small? It's like, no,

609
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:56,060
it's one of was crying and I don't know,
it was,

610
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,660
it was very serendipitous that it, that
it worked at all and that, you know, I,

611
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:05,130
I was able to not have to go back
to Ebay is even a sentence somehow.

612
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:09,860
No, I think we, I think we
can work without punctuation
in this conversation. Okay.

613
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:14,620
The, uh, especially since I've
had enough enough tea now, uh,

614
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,513
and uh,

615
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:19,780
butter and coconut oil two to
last me for like a Siberian trek,

616
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:24,781
but I'm digressing the Ebay transition
slash booting off of slash jumping,

617
00:37:28,661 --> 00:37:30,790
jumping headfirst and growing
wings on the way down.

618
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,510
That was how long after
you started selling on Ebay

619
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:39,370
that was a oh gosh,
a year and a half.

620
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,520
And at the,
at the point that you launched your site,

621
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:46,750
what we did sales look like on
Ebay for you, if you recall?

622
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:51,310
Yeah, so the first year on Ebay
was like 75,000 in revenue,

623
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:55,420
which, you know, I wasn't paying
myself. I mean I didn't need stuff.

624
00:37:55,450 --> 00:38:00,070
I lived in a pool house for $500 a month.
Like I drove an 87 Volvo. Like I didn't,

625
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:04,750
I hate Boston market and subway, you
know, like all the time. So it was,

626
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,340
that was like winning a lottery.

627
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:10,780
Yeah. Oh for sure. I think Boston
markets underrated. I used it kind of,

628
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,570
that's like trader Joe's
and Boston markets.

629
00:38:14,571 --> 00:38:17,300
Like don't knock it until you try it.
Uh,

630
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:22,420
and then you start getting these
inquiries from say Kelly Ripa style.

631
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:28,790
She is extra small. Um, having
been on that show on, she is tiny,

632
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:33,070
such great shape. She
is an amazing shape. Uh,

633
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:36,010
how did you develop those

634
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,880
relationships with editors and so on?
Or was it all out of the blue? I mean,

635
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:43,450
did you ping them? No, it was sitting here

636
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:47,680
like totally inbound at that point and
there wasn't like a giant, you know,

637
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:51,850
there wasn't a ton of news
embryo. It was daily Candy, um,

638
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,680
you know, rest in peace and uh, who, what,

639
00:38:55,681 --> 00:38:59,260
where and they just kind of, they
had, they followed me on my space,

640
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:02,680
they heard about the launch and they
decided to talk about it and the kind of

641
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:07,000
coverage I got with stuff that
brands like car, we'll pay, you know,

642
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,830
tens of thousands of dollars you know,
for. But when you're doing something cool,

643
00:39:11,831 --> 00:39:13,990
people want to talk about it.
And I guess it was cool.

644
00:39:13,991 --> 00:39:16,420
I mean I hate saying that I'm cool,
but

645
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,080
no, you can say it was cool
because if you were like,

646
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:22,450
let me tell you how I'm cool,
it would be one thing.

647
00:39:22,451 --> 00:39:25,640
But you're talking about how the, how the,
the launch was cool. That's fair. Okay.

648
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,650
They liked it. So they talked about
it. If you have something great,

649
00:39:28,651 --> 00:39:29,670
people will talk about it.

650
00:39:29,671 --> 00:39:31,890
I think that's just kind of
like a rule of the Internet.

651
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:35,390
And if,
if someone were launching now,

652
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:38,570
not necessarily fashion or
anything like that, but they say,

653
00:39:38,571 --> 00:39:42,290
I have this idea for x, let's just, let's,

654
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,460
we can think something up
like a vintage toy cars,

655
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:50,030
let's just say I'm sure it's been
done, but, and they say, you know,

656
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:54,530
I would like to figure out, I would
like to build a business based on this.

657
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,570
What,
uh,

658
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:02,530
what advice would you give them in terms
of kind of testing or de-risking or

659
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,480
testing the waters in any way?
Um,

660
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,910
or you can answer that in any
way really that you'd like,

661
00:40:07,911 --> 00:40:09,500
but if you had that
conversation with someone,

662
00:40:09,501 --> 00:40:13,880
and I'm sure you have had
probably ad Nauseum, these
types of conversations, but,

663
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,090
uh, assuming they're pretty smart,
they're willing to do the work,

664
00:40:17,091 --> 00:40:19,370
they're detail oriented,
like what would you say to them?

665
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:24,350
I would say it's, it's really great
to test your product. Um, I'm,

666
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,610
my mom is like,

667
00:40:25,611 --> 00:40:28,820
I'm going to talk about something before
I even launched it and make a big stink

668
00:40:28,821 --> 00:40:31,820
about it. The thing that I'm not, you
know, who knows if it's gonna work out.

669
00:40:31,821 --> 00:40:36,300
And that's just, just me being kind
of like short attention span, um,

670
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,830
instant gratification. But I really
think there's a lot of value and,

671
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:44,870
and being patient and testing things
with like a small group before you go out

672
00:40:44,871 --> 00:40:49,160
there and tell the world today, you
know, here I am fully formed, you know,

673
00:40:49,161 --> 00:40:52,430
buy into my style, you know,
buy into what I'm doing. Um,

674
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I think there's just a lot of
resources for, I mean it's,

675
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,640
as far as selling online
goes, it's, I mean,

676
00:40:58,641 --> 00:41:00,590
it's like having a lemonade
stand at this point.

677
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,560
So it's incredibly easy thing to do.

678
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:08,590
Your product should be
really differentiated and the
way you talk about it, um,

679
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:13,780
should be unique and really thoughtful
and regardless of whether you're selling,

680
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:19,250
you know, use diapers or
use toy cars, um, sorry,

681
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,030
um, you, you should, you
should, you should really,

682
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,490
really invest in presenting yourself well,

683
00:41:25,491 --> 00:41:28,490
and there's websites like
Squarespace obviously, that,

684
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:32,990
that make that so easy now, um,
so much easier than it used to be.

685
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:36,350
Finding a graphic designer that can make
something look like what you can plug

686
00:41:36,351 --> 00:41:40,700
into now for almost no money is,
is incredible.

687
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:45,650
Yeah. No, the, the infrastructure, I mean
the, the rentable infrastructure per se,

688
00:41:45,651 --> 00:41:50,190
whether it's a Squarespace or a
wordpress or someone else. Uh,

689
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:50,900
I mean you can,

690
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,900
you can have a site up and running within
an hour or two and then you could use,

691
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,000
you'd, I've mentioned them
in the four hour work week,

692
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:03,290
but even the marketplaces that exist
now for things like designers, writers,

693
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,760
illustrators, like in 99 designs or
Fiverr or something like that. I mean,

694
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:12,120
I'm having no illustrations
done for a book right now. Um,

695
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:16,210
with the non Spec version of 99 designs,

696
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,540
these kind of one on one projects and
the quality is obscene. Lee High, I mean,

697
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,920
I've been very, very impressed.
So it is a lot easier. Uh,

698
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,290
in particularly with
things like Kickstarter,

699
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:31,100
I think you have also the ability to
see how strong your pitches right before

700
00:42:31,101 --> 00:42:34,080
you buy inventory or manufacturer things.
Yeah,

701
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:36,800
yeah. No one cares. You
don't have a customer.

702
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:38,210
It's like you got to see if anyone cares.

703
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:42,920
Burst. Yeah, exactly. And if they're
willing to part ways with their dollars.

704
00:42:42,921 --> 00:42:47,921
What were some books or resources that
helped you in the first few years or

705
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,910
overall build in building nasty gal

706
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,160
early? Um, I would say,

707
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,700
I would say in the dummies guides
or not. I mean, they're fine.

708
00:42:59,701 --> 00:43:03,000
They're really fine. When I went to raise
venture capital, there's one called,

709
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:05,940
I think it's something like how to be
smarter than your venture capitalists,

710
00:43:05,941 --> 00:43:09,450
like literary something like that.
And I I that and I was like, you know,

711
00:43:09,451 --> 00:43:13,950
I've raised $70 million. So I
guess I figured that out. Um,

712
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,730
and there was a book called no man's
land that I thought was really good.

713
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:21,600
It was about just that period of time
or you're too small to be big and you're

714
00:43:21,601 --> 00:43:25,440
too big to be small. And most
people, higher middle management,

715
00:43:25,441 --> 00:43:27,360
but middle management
have never seen the top.

716
00:43:27,361 --> 00:43:30,840
So then you hire more senior management.
And I've done that.

717
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:34,950
And even that's challenging. So,
I mean there's no silver bullet,

718
00:43:34,951 --> 00:43:36,840
but reading other people,

719
00:43:36,841 --> 00:43:40,410
reading about other people's experiences
of growing and struggling with scaling

720
00:43:40,411 --> 00:43:42,690
a business always makes you feel better.

721
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:48,370
Is the book that you were thinking of
venture deals be smarter than your lawyer

722
00:43:48,371 --> 00:43:49,420
and venture capitalists?

723
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,673
No.
It's,

724
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,280
maybe it's called like how to outsmart
your venture capitalist or something.

725
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:58,330
How to train your venture
capitalist. Yeah. Basically. Um,

726
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,460
how to be smarter than
your venture capitalists.

727
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:06,460
That's what it's called. At least that's
what's coming up in the search results.

728
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:10,180
Let me see how to be smarter than
your venture capitalist. No. Oh,

729
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:14,360
venture deals be smarter than your lawyer,
I guess. That's it. Yeah. Okay. All right,

730
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:15,170
cool.
Yeah.

731
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:18,590
Venture deals for people interested
in this world is a, is a great book.

732
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,300
That's Brad Feld and his partner.
Um, very, very good investors.

733
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,160
Uh,
what,

734
00:44:25,161 --> 00:44:28,940
what were some of the biggest challenges

735
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,200
for scaling an ecommerce business?

736
00:44:34,201 --> 00:44:37,320
What were some of the harder things that
you guys, that you had to contend with?

737
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,310
Let's just, let's just keep it focused
on, on you. But the company of course,

738
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:43,130
as it's growing,
um,

739
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:46,460
and I've spoken with people like Phil
Libin of Evernote on the podcast and he's

740
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:50,460
like, well, like this, you
know, Gent who runs Rakuten.

741
00:44:50,461 --> 00:44:53,370
He's saying you should always plan on
like what if it's three times bigger?

742
00:44:53,371 --> 00:44:56,940
What if it's 10 times bigger?
They're sort of these phase shifts where,

743
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,580
where systems have to be
completely redone. But for,

744
00:44:59,581 --> 00:45:03,240
for you in growing the company,
what were some of the,

745
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,100
what were some of the
hardest periods for you?

746
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:09,430
Yeah, I would say I would,
scaling is really hard.

747
00:45:09,431 --> 00:45:11,470
So I would say infrastructure,

748
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:16,360
so systems and we still don't have the
systems that we would like to have to be

749
00:45:16,361 --> 00:45:21,250
able to plan our business and evaluate
our business and talk about it.

750
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,750
What would be some
examples of what systems?

751
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:28,630
I mean it's really kind of like
unglamorous stuff, like an Erp system,

752
00:45:28,631 --> 00:45:33,540
like enterprise resource planning, which
basically connects the dots between, uh,

753
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,520
you know, different departments like
finance and, um, you know, merchandise,

754
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:40,800
whatever. Austin. Right now,

755
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:45,420
everything that we do is living in kind
of disparate systems that don't talk as

756
00:45:45,421 --> 00:45:50,340
much as they could. Right. Um, so
that's, that's a struggle today. Um,

757
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:56,220
what else? I mean, I would say
people, I would say like, you know,

758
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:57,054
being,

759
00:45:57,270 --> 00:46:02,190
having never really been a manager prior
to starting the business that has asked

760
00:46:02,191 --> 00:46:07,110
to gal. Um, you know, my dream
scenario at one point was, you know,

761
00:46:07,111 --> 00:46:10,540
it was not getting out of a bathroom and
eating Boston market, like, you know,

762
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:16,080
with my hands and then, you know, and
then, and then encountering, you know,

763
00:46:16,081 --> 00:46:20,250
hundreds of, uh, you know, a team of
hundreds who are looking up at you.

764
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,650
That's like a really scary
thing. And they all assume, yeah,

765
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:27,970
I thought you meant your dream was walking
into the office of hundreds of people

766
00:46:27,971 --> 00:46:30,920
in your bathroom. And it's like, that's
very wolf of Wall Street. Like, oh wow.

767
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:31,960
I kind of liked that visual,

768
00:46:31,961 --> 00:46:34,390
like eating lobster tails while
you walk through the office.

769
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,730
I would totally, I would
do that, but I have, um,

770
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,370
should I start over
because I didn't make it?

771
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:45,870
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. It
does make sense. I be how,

772
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:51,300
what did you view your, now
you are, you are no longer CEO.

773
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,570
Is that correct? No. Yes.
Correct. When you were Ceo,

774
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,750
what did you view as your job?
Like

775
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:00,010
as entrepreneurs to you?

776
00:47:00,011 --> 00:47:03,700
It's really tough because there's so
many things that I've been a part of and

777
00:47:03,701 --> 00:47:07,450
done over the course of the company's
history. And I'm also kind of the brand,

778
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:11,820
the brand cop. Um, and
the brand is my voice. Um,

779
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,340
and the vision has kind of grown
out of the, the beginnings,

780
00:47:15,341 --> 00:47:18,390
the DNA of what was
nasty gal origin story.

781
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,400
So there's never been a point where
I could just be like the cut and dry.

782
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,490
I'm the CEO kind of person, you know,
I'm the cultural leader and the,

783
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:32,620
all of these things, it was so things,
um, so you know, when, when you're,

784
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,770
when you're growing a business,
it's really hard to say, no,

785
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:38,620
I'm not going to plug that hole.
I'm not going to edit the photos.

786
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:42,060
I'm not going to, you know, companies
spring leaks and when you have, when,

787
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:44,250
when you've done so many different things,
it's,

788
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,000
it's easy to sprout arms and
fingers and just start like,

789
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:49,470
you know,

790
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:54,470
over extending yourself by filling in
the gaps as they present themselves,

791
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:58,840
um, over the course of, you
know, so it was, it was not,

792
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:01,030
I don't think I got to choose my,

793
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:05,290
what I did as much as I
perhaps would have liked to.

794
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,480
And I'm even today,
I'm not,

795
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:12,540
I'm not sure if I have that privilege
because you kind of have to do what the

796
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:18,001
company needs you to do for it to
continue operating or to be its very best.

797
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,780
And nine years of that is
a really long time. Um,

798
00:48:22,781 --> 00:48:26,530
and I th I think my greatest
strengths are with the brand and with,

799
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,960
with marketing the brand and
with the creative and um,

800
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,000
the things that in the
beginning built built nasty gal.

801
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:37,690
And that's what I'm hoping
I can focus on today.

802
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:39,750
How do you,
how do you keep,

803
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:46,160
try to keep the team on the same page
so that that sort of brand aesthetic and

804
00:48:46,651 --> 00:48:51,570
spirit doesn't get fragmented and turn
it into some Frankenstein monster where

805
00:48:51,571 --> 00:48:55,250
you've become brands that you loathe
or whatever you get there. How do you,

806
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,030
how do you try to do that?

807
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:01,710
You're going to really quickly become a
caricature of yourself. I'm like, yeah.

808
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,910
Um, uh, yeah,

809
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:07,740
like a spoof of like
what you've done best.

810
00:49:07,741 --> 00:49:11,190
And I think it's a, it's a matter
of talent but it's also coaching.

811
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:16,220
But at the end of the day I think you
really need to have tools that everyone

812
00:49:17,101 --> 00:49:21,450
can rally around and say, Hey, this is
what it is. This is what the brand is,

813
00:49:21,451 --> 00:49:23,160
this is what we're all signing up to do.

814
00:49:23,161 --> 00:49:26,430
Not this is my idea versus
your idea versus your idea.

815
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:29,760
Cause I think culture
like in a, um, in a, in a,

816
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:33,600
in a business that people really excited
or excited to work at culture can be

817
00:49:33,601 --> 00:49:37,620
used as a weapon. I think the brand
can be used as a weapon. I think there,

818
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:37,861
you know,

819
00:49:37,861 --> 00:49:42,540
there have been times where people who
are really cool and actually do get yet

820
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:43,410
what the brand is,

821
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:46,950
find themselves really frustrated because
not everybody gets it the way did they

822
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:50,640
do. And they start to say, well, Sophia,

823
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:54,060
Sophia said this or Sophia wouldn't like
that. And it's like, I don't want to be,

824
00:49:54,061 --> 00:49:58,140
don't sling me around.
Like that's not cool. Um,

825
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:01,080
and so we've been
spending the last several,

826
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:05,310
several months actually working
on some what of a brand bible,

827
00:50:05,311 --> 00:50:10,311
but also just filters for how we make
decisions about what the voices and how

828
00:50:10,651 --> 00:50:13,730
we, how we take pictures and
you know, the, the world that,

829
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:17,160
that is a nasty gal world and what the,
you know,

830
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:20,970
what the guard rails are that
people can explore within.

831
00:50:20,971 --> 00:50:25,260
We always want to leave room for people
to be creative, but it takes out a,

832
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:29,570
it takes out the, uh, the objectivity,

833
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:34,580
uh, or wait, yeah, the, all
the subjectivity. I'm like,
God, my brain's not working.

834
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:37,190
Basically it makes it not personal.

835
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:40,620
So it makes it makes it more
objective or depersonalized.

836
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,060
Yeah. So it's easy for it to be like, oh,

837
00:50:43,061 --> 00:50:46,720
well that's not on brand because
I said so. It's like, Oh hey,

838
00:50:46,721 --> 00:50:48,310
we're all trying to do the same thing.

839
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:53,440
Let's look at this thing that's just sits
outside of us and our tastes, our ego,

840
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:57,070
whatever. Let's talk about what it
is rather than what we think it is.

841
00:50:57,071 --> 00:51:01,150
So you have to have those things defined
for people to have conversations about.

842
00:51:01,151 --> 00:51:03,220
And that's something I'm
really excited to have.

843
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:07,340
There's a, there's a
really cool handbook. Um,

844
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:11,190
I think it's just called the handbook
for new employees for a company called

845
00:51:11,191 --> 00:51:14,070
valve, which is a software company. Uh,

846
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:19,100
it's one of the coolest sort of employee
orientation handbooks that I've ever

847
00:51:20,551 --> 00:51:21,001
seen.

848
00:51:21,001 --> 00:51:26,001
I had a chance to meet because it was
Gabe Newell at one point in Seattle and I

849
00:51:26,641 --> 00:51:30,600
was somebody else then recommended. I
see this handbook. It's really cool.

850
00:51:30,601 --> 00:51:31,350
You should check it out.

851
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:34,530
I think he might enjoy it and people
listening might get something out of it.

852
00:51:34,531 --> 00:51:38,220
You can find the free pdf if you just
search valve employee handbook is pretty

853
00:51:38,221 --> 00:51:39,050
sweet.

854
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:42,790
I think I've seen that. It's
really beautiful. It's this
teeny little cool thing.

855
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:46,680
Yeah. Yeah. It's really well done.
Great illustrations. But, uh,

856
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,990
lays out the basic ground rules,
right.

857
00:51:48,991 --> 00:51:52,780
For working within this
somewhat unusual culture, uh,

858
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:55,950
that you mentioned the,

859
00:51:55,951 --> 00:52:00,951
before I derailed us with the wolf of
Wall Street analogy and you walking around

860
00:52:02,101 --> 00:52:03,600
in a bathroom eating lobster tails,

861
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:09,780
which actually I have two
quick, uh, quick anecdote.

862
00:52:09,781 --> 00:52:13,020
So when I was in college,
one of my buddies and I was in,

863
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:18,090
I was in New Jersey and one of my buddies
ends up calling us from Atlantic city

864
00:52:18,091 --> 00:52:20,220
and he's like,
there are limos coming to get you.

865
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:22,080
You have to come to Atlantic city.

866
00:52:22,081 --> 00:52:27,081
We show up and he's just been on a bender
and made like $200,000 blackjack and

867
00:52:28,531 --> 00:52:31,740
proceeds to spend it all
in the next 48 hours.

868
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:35,760
And he was walking around the casino in
a bathrobe eating any ordered lobster

869
00:52:35,761 --> 00:52:39,490
tails for everyone on the, on
the like blackjacks floor. Wow.

870
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:42,510
It sounds kind of imagining like
you could, you could be that person,

871
00:52:42,511 --> 00:52:44,430
but with like a Martini glass,

872
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:49,720
I love absurd,
just doing absurd things like that can.

873
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,120
Uh,
so I was going to ask you about,

874
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:55,270
I was going to ask you about managing
and I will, but absurd things.

875
00:52:55,271 --> 00:52:56,890
What are some absurd
things that you've done?

876
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:02,540
Oh my gosh,
I'm getting on a bus to call it that.

877
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:05,000
I'm calling a girlboss Hashtag girlboss

878
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:11,470
and well it's like later at the
end of this month and we're,

879
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,670
it's just the paperback.

880
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,850
It's the girl boss paperback and it
has a new introduction and it as the

881
00:53:16,851 --> 00:53:18,200
introduction to the introduction,

882
00:53:18,201 --> 00:53:21,380
I guess just talking about what's
happened over the last year a little bit.

883
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:25,650
And we're going to like 10 different
cities on this crazy tour bus.

884
00:53:25,651 --> 00:53:29,100
It's like I'm a spice girl
or something and you know,

885
00:53:29,101 --> 00:53:32,610
throwing events at different venues
and some bookstores and it's just like,

886
00:53:32,611 --> 00:53:36,000
it's really absurd to be riding around
like Hillary Clinton and I'm like a

887
00:53:36,001 --> 00:53:38,790
campaign bus basically.
But Penguin,

888
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,630
penguin wanted to do it and I thought
it was just like too good to pass up.

889
00:53:42,631 --> 00:53:46,020
And it's, it's really funny to have your
face and the cover of your book. Like,

890
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:49,680
he likes, you know, slathered across
the side of like a giant were us.

891
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:53,790
Yeah. But I would imagine. What about um,

892
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:59,160
managing, let's talk about
that. So the managing of people,

893
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:03,030
you had no experience prior to nasty gal.

894
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:06,810
Now it's grown of course tremendously.
Um,

895
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:08,820
what were,

896
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:13,950
who were the mentors or what were the
things that helped you learn to manage to

897
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:15,150
the extent that you were able,

898
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:21,660
oh my God, I think I'm
still learning. Um, wait,

899
00:54:21,661 --> 00:54:22,494
say that again.

900
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,320
Yeah, that was, but that was
a word salad question. Okay.

901
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:28,060
Who are the mentors or the,

902
00:54:28,061 --> 00:54:32,010
the resources that helped you
learn to manage other people?

903
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,900
Because I think that's a
weakness of mine quite frankly.

904
00:54:33,901 --> 00:54:38,850
I'm good at defining systems,
but I'm not always a,

905
00:54:38,851 --> 00:54:43,340
for instance, I mean I was
raised by, are not raised by us.

906
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:43,950
That's weird.

907
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:48,950
I was coached by a lot of athletic
coaches who were always kind of very short

908
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:53,580
with praise. They would, they would
not, they didn't do a lot of head pats,

909
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:57,240
but heavy on criticism
and very meticulous.

910
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:02,660
And so I am often very bad at providing
praise when I probably should because I

911
00:55:05,581 --> 00:55:09,330
don't feel like I was ever given it.
Therefore it's not really necessary.

912
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:14,340
Uh, I think I'm the same, but that
causes all sorts of problems. Right?

913
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,530
We don't feel appreciated. And it's like,
oh my God, I totally appreciate you.

914
00:55:18,531 --> 00:55:23,330
But like I respect your intelligence
enough not to like be like,

915
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:24,463
I don't know.

916
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:27,390
Yeah, it's tough. I mean, because I've
always been told by the good stuff,

917
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:28,111
the good stuff.

918
00:55:28,111 --> 00:55:31,260
I remember I had a VP of sales at one
point when my first job out of college and

919
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:32,610
he said, you know, I,

920
00:55:32,611 --> 00:55:35,530
I would give him all the story and the
backs or tell him all this stuff about a

921
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,850
reclined. He's like, Tim, I don't need
the story. I just need to know next steps.

922
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:42,570
And second, I don't need to know the good
news cause that takes care of itself.

923
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,120
I need to know the bad news.
And I was like, oh, okay.

924
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:46,920
And so I've kind of adopted that.

925
00:55:46,921 --> 00:55:50,970
But you end up in a position where
people can get very demoralized in,

926
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:54,100
in a culture where people
aren't getting uh, the,

927
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:57,250
or don't have the ability to
celebrate little wins and so on. Who,

928
00:55:57,290 --> 00:56:01,920
who has helped you to become a better
CEO when you were a CEO or a better

929
00:56:01,921 --> 00:56:02,754
manager?

930
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,310
I've had some executive
coaches along the way.

931
00:56:05,311 --> 00:56:09,060
I think knowing the difference and then
actually living the difference are two

932
00:56:09,061 --> 00:56:12,360
different things. And I think I'm
pretty aware of the things that I'm,

933
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:17,340
what my shortcomings are as a manager,
as a leader, as a fill in the blank.

934
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:20,310
Um, I'm not, you know,

935
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:24,070
I think I experienced the
same thing when you are,

936
00:56:24,071 --> 00:56:26,960
especially if you're entrepreneurial,
which I think we like,

937
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:30,860
we can both like safely say we are.
No one's giving you,

938
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,490
no one's giving you
those pats on the back.

939
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:38,650
And when you find yourself in a position
to be doling those out, you don't,

940
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,830
you don't really relate because that's
not something that you ever required.

941
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:45,430
I'm an only child. I had a really
mean dad. I mean, he's often now,

942
00:56:45,431 --> 00:56:50,230
but like it was criticism after criticism
and it makes you self aware enough to,

943
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:53,710
uh, to calibrate on your
own. And a lot of ways,

944
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:57,550
even though I'm totally open to, I
love, you know, criticism and I love,

945
00:56:58,130 --> 00:57:00,530
but I think when you,

946
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,940
when you're like a solo act at any
point in your life and have to manifest

947
00:57:04,941 --> 00:57:08,660
things without, without the team, without
the amazing team that we have today,

948
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:12,410
you become really good at being your own
critic and your own and also your own

949
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:15,230
pat on the back or you're motivated
maybe by different things.

950
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:18,950
And that's a hard thing to relate
to as an entrepreneur who's leading,

951
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:22,250
who's leading people. And I think that's
definitely been one of my shortcomings.

952
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,930
Um, but I've, I've,

953
00:57:23,931 --> 00:57:27,230
I'm always like seeking advice and
I'm always seeking to better myself.

954
00:57:27,231 --> 00:57:31,010
I think leadership management chops,
whatever you want to call it,

955
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,930
is something that comes over time.

956
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:36,620
A lot of things are just learned
over time with repetition.

957
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,530
And that's something that I
have, you know, I've been,

958
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:44,210
that's one part of the job that I've had
is managing people or leading people,

959
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:48,200
but there's been a million other things
that I've done, uh, over the course of,

960
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:52,250
you know, nasty Gal's trajectory
and having someone like Sherry,

961
00:57:52,251 --> 00:57:57,251
our CEO who has a lifetime of those
chops behind her who wakes up every day

962
00:57:57,321 --> 00:57:58,154
inspired,

963
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:03,170
not just inspired to lead people but
knows how to do it in a way that will work

964
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:06,260
is such a real,
it's such a cool thing to witness.

965
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:10,330
When you were in the CEO role,

966
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:15,530
who were the other CEO's out there alive
or dead that you admired and really

967
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,810
looked to as role models?

968
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,570
Hmm, good question. Um, I mean,

969
00:58:23,571 --> 00:58:28,310
I've always admired Natalie Massenet
who founded net-a-porter. Um,

970
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:32,540
and she hasn't been the CEO
for a long time, but she's,

971
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:36,470
she's just like an incredible
woman. Um, why she incredible.

972
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:41,630
Um, she's, she's a mother of I to, uh,

973
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,560
she started a company a long,
you know,

974
00:58:45,561 --> 00:58:50,300
like she started an ecommerce business
long before most of us had the idea to,

975
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:53,870
um, she's been told, you know, I mean,

976
00:58:53,871 --> 00:58:56,870
I think people like Kinda scoffed
when she, you know, she said,

977
00:58:56,871 --> 00:59:00,830
I'm going to sell a $30,000 handbag
on the internet or sell shoes on the

978
00:59:00,831 --> 00:59:04,700
internet or these things that
have become really common place.

979
00:59:04,701 --> 00:59:09,530
And she's also just a super duper down
down to Earth woman who's funny and sweet

980
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:14,300
and gives great advice and who's
seen a lot. And um, there's not,

981
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:18,590
there's not a ton of examples that
I think are, are similar to hers.

982
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:22,400
Mickey Drexler's also
an incredible like CEO

983
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:26,430
Mickey Drexler. Yeah. Do you know
who Mickey Drexler is? I don't,

984
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:29,760
I'm embarrassed to say, but
I shan't tell the lie. Okay.

985
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:30,580
He's the,

986
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:34,810
he's the CEO of j crew right now and he
used to be the CEO at gap and he's kind

987
00:59:34,811 --> 00:59:38,290
of like a retail legend. Um, he's,

988
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:42,580
I think he's called like the merchant
prints or merchant king or something like

989
00:59:42,581 --> 00:59:47,260
that. Cool. Cool. Nickname. I
know, right. I know he's just,

990
00:59:47,261 --> 00:59:49,690
he's someone who's given
me advice along the way,

991
00:59:49,691 --> 00:59:52,960
just really great advice and connected me
to people that I've ended up, you know,

992
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:56,230
great people be, get great
people. And you know,

993
00:59:56,231 --> 01:00:00,190
it's just when you meet someone
awesome, you've eats off. It's, it's,

994
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:03,760
it's common that I find the people
that they surround themselves with,

995
01:00:03,761 --> 01:00:07,840
the people that I also like. And that's,
it's just such a cool thing. It's like a,

996
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:12,580
I dunno. It's like you don't have
to, it's like, it's like going to,

997
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:14,023
nevermind.

998
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:17,100
No, no, no. I want you to
finish that thought. That was
good. That was interesting.

999
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,860
I was going to start babbling like
about Yelp reviews and it's like,

1000
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:22,530
it's like a Yelp review for a person.
It seems like it wasn't that,

1001
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,000
it was not an intelligent thought.
Yeah.

1002
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:27,590
So I brought up, you know, I
should learn to do that more often.

1003
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:32,320
I would embarrass myself a
lot less. Uh, what were, what,

1004
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:37,640
what was some of the advice that,
uh, Mickey has given you that to,

1005
01:00:37,641 --> 01:00:41,390
that has stuck with you? It doesn't
have to be specifically business.

1006
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,233
Could be anything.

1007
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:45,200
I mean, his advice was to stay
CEO, which is really funny.

1008
01:00:45,201 --> 01:00:48,140
It's definitely stuck with me,
but I ignored it.

1009
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:53,030
Um,
let me think.

1010
01:00:56,740 --> 01:01:00,740
Oh, I get, I can give you an escape
hatch for this. My memory blows.

1011
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:05,870
We can, we can I get an a, I
can give you a whole slew of,

1012
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:09,950
of pills and potions for that. Uh, but,
uh, we, we will do that separately. The,

1013
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:15,350
have you met David Cho?
No. You haven't? Okay.

1014
01:01:15,351 --> 01:01:19,760
Somebody asked online what you,
what you learned from him? Yeah,

1015
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,330
yeah, yeah. The, uh, the,

1016
01:01:23,331 --> 01:01:26,300
the graffiti artists
slash artist who ended up,

1017
01:01:26,301 --> 01:01:29,270
I guess worth 500 million after Facebook,
I believe I'm saying his last name.

1018
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:33,050
Oh, cool. What did I learn from
him? No, I didn't. I, that's cool.

1019
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:34,230
But you haven't met him.

1020
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,200
What I learned about him was
everything that you just told me.

1021
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:42,210
Okay. Okay. Got It. I've been hoping
to, I find his story fascinating,

1022
01:01:42,211 --> 01:01:45,690
so I'm hoping to connect
with him at some point.

1023
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:47,281
Yeah.

1024
01:01:47,281 --> 01:01:51,960
He's just made some really fascinating
creative decisions that da I'd love to

1025
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:56,340
love to dig into. But, uh, anyway,
that's a whole separate story.

1026
01:01:56,730 --> 01:01:59,670
Uh, the, uh, what,

1027
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:02,580
what do you struggle with the
most and how do you deal with it?

1028
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,320
I struggle with doing it all most.

1029
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:11,120
I struggle with feeling like I don't
have time for everyone who I want to have

1030
01:02:11,121 --> 01:02:15,700
time for and who I,
I assume once my time,

1031
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:17,400
um,
for,

1032
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:22,170
for my friends and for my husband and
for my parents and for my team. Um,

1033
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:27,200
it's just time is a really finite thing
and prioritizing it so that you can,

1034
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,940
you know, so you can be your
best so that you can, you know,

1035
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,520
have real solid time with people so you
can also find time to be alone or to

1036
01:02:35,521 --> 01:02:38,920
take a vacation. It's just,
there's not enough time. Um, so I,

1037
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:43,680
I'm always feeling like I'm
letting someone down or I'm just,

1038
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:44,370
you know,
it's like,

1039
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:49,140
it's like my calendar is booked up for
the next month and a half now and it's

1040
01:02:49,141 --> 01:02:52,050
just, I, I, it's, it's
not always like that,

1041
01:02:52,051 --> 01:02:55,320
but to look out at the rest of the year,
it's kind of like,

1042
01:02:55,321 --> 01:02:59,910
it's over like the years, you know,
years over. That's, that's something,

1043
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:03,000
I dunno if I, you know, I kind of hoped
that my life isn't always like that,

1044
01:03:03,001 --> 01:03:06,030
but there's gotta be great things if
you're planning that far out. I guess,

1045
01:03:06,031 --> 01:03:10,200
you know, I feel very lucky for that.
Any answer to your question really is,

1046
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,050
is you're feeling like I
don't have all the time.

1047
01:03:13,051 --> 01:03:18,051
I wish I had to spend with all the people
that I wish I could spend it with and

1048
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:19,770
how do I deal with that?

1049
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:24,030
Yeah. How do you deal with it?
And let me ask, uh, just uh,

1050
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:28,610
in combination with that,
and this is maybe a very silly question,

1051
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:33,640
you obviously are very driven and that
is sometimes leads people to find it

1052
01:03:34,191 --> 01:03:37,820
difficult to hit the
pause button or downshift.

1053
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:42,440
But you've stepped out of the CEO role
I would think as an outsider looking in,

1054
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:45,800
uh, of course you're still
going to be very involved as,

1055
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:48,350
as a chairman is chairman.

1056
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:52,280
But why can't you create more time?
Why can't you block out time?

1057
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:56,690
Cause the company still needs me for
my things and I still partner with my,

1058
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,900
my CEO and still spend a lot
of time with her. You know,

1059
01:03:59,901 --> 01:04:02,510
I'm drumming up opportunities
for the business,

1060
01:04:02,511 --> 01:04:06,260
whether it's a collaboration or
um, you know, weighing in on,

1061
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:10,790
on something creative. You know, I still
spend time there. Uh, you know, I've,

1062
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:15,380
I've signed up for more things that then
I probably should have, but you know, I,

1063
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,730
I, I, everyone should be.
So I don't know. I feel,

1064
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,440
I feel like saying no is just,

1065
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:24,840
it doesn't create opportunity.

1066
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:29,690
So I'm throwing all that I can into
the air and just to see how much I can

1067
01:04:29,691 --> 01:04:34,030
actually handle. I think, I don't
know. I'm a glutton for punishment. Um,

1068
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:37,480
so, you know, it's like I'm
launching a podcast next month.

1069
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:40,910
I'm like promoting this paper
paperback. I'm Finna, you know,

1070
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:44,120
I'm working on another book.
I'm like, who knows. I mean,

1071
01:04:44,121 --> 01:04:47,580
I want girl boss to become its own
thing. Girl boss should be, is,

1072
01:04:47,581 --> 01:04:51,260
is so much more than a book. It
should be a business. It should be,

1073
01:04:51,261 --> 01:04:53,090
it should be conferences.
It should be.

1074
01:04:53,091 --> 01:04:56,180
It shouldn't be so many things
beyond what it, what it is.

1075
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:00,080
It's just a matter of of
doing it. Um, as of making,

1076
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:02,390
making the time and finding
the team and Oh my God,

1077
01:05:02,391 --> 01:05:06,650
what am I going to start another business.
I'm not sure, you know, but just doing,

1078
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:11,690
doing all I can with all that I have
and connecting things that shouldn't

1079
01:05:11,691 --> 01:05:15,500
connect is what really, really gets me
excited because that's where you would,

1080
01:05:15,501 --> 01:05:19,600
that's where invention happens and that's,
that's where I get,

1081
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:23,110
that's where I just get like really,
really excited about things. So

1082
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:27,840
what, what were some of the
key inflection points for,

1083
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:30,270
uh,
for the company?

1084
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:34,290
So if you look back over the
last 10 years or whatever it is,

1085
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:35,723
um,

1086
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:40,850
what were some of the key inflection
points that allowed nasty gal to become

1087
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:43,560
what it is right there? Cause
I can think back, for instance,

1088
01:05:43,561 --> 01:05:44,400
with the four hour work week,

1089
01:05:44,401 --> 01:05:49,401
I can think very specifically to like the
day that Robert Scoble at the time put

1090
01:05:49,531 --> 01:05:54,531
something on his blog was
a clear inflection point
that was a clear inflection

1091
01:05:55,771 --> 01:05:58,920
point. The appearance on Doctor
Oz clear inflection point.

1092
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:04,050
So a meeting certain people
getting advice from say, uh,

1093
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,120
Michael Gerber who wrote
the e myth revisited.

1094
01:06:06,121 --> 01:06:08,160
And before I even wrote the
four hour work week, he said,

1095
01:06:08,161 --> 01:06:10,350
if you're gonna write a book,
write a fucking book.

1096
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:14,070
Like don't half ass it because a mediocre
book is more of a liability than a

1097
01:06:14,071 --> 01:06:16,820
help and blah, blah, blah. Right. So,

1098
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:21,630
so I can point to very clear
introductions, meetings.

1099
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:25,050
What are some of those
four for you and nasty gal?

1100
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:26,163
Yeah,

1101
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:30,430
I would say it was launching,

1102
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:33,190
I mean the first one would be
just launching the Ebay store.

1103
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:38,530
The next one would be selling a Chanel
jacket that I bought for $8 for a over a

1104
01:06:38,531 --> 01:06:40,400
thousand.
Um,

1105
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:45,460
so the next one would
probably be launching,

1106
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:48,730
launching the website and having
it sell out just overnight.

1107
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,990
And then pretty soon after that,
hiring my first employee, um,

1108
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:57,910
after that it would be buying
things that weren't vintage.

1109
01:06:57,911 --> 01:06:59,470
So buying a small,

1110
01:06:59,471 --> 01:07:04,450
medium and large of something from a
trade show and bringing in new brands and

1111
01:07:04,451 --> 01:07:09,451
testing and seeing if our customer had
an appetite for more than just vintage,

1112
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:12,910
um, which they did. And then it was like,

1113
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:17,380
I think just didn't just, you know,
scale scaling isn't, that's not a,

1114
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:22,180
that's an inflection point.
But what happened? We outgrew
our space and Venetia,

1115
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:24,190
I mean,
we've moved so many times,

1116
01:07:24,191 --> 01:07:29,191
but I would say after that it was
raising $50 million from index ventures.

1117
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:34,060
Um,
for me personally,

1118
01:07:34,061 --> 01:07:37,150
it was four pages in Forbes in 2012.

1119
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:40,530
How did the four pages in Forbes happen?

1120
01:07:40,531 --> 01:07:43,770
Because there's often some
backstory, right? Not,

1121
01:07:43,771 --> 01:07:46,350
not all of them are just gifts from
heaven that get dropped in your lap.

1122
01:07:46,351 --> 01:07:48,840
And maybe this was, but how did that
come together? I mean, that's a,

1123
01:07:48,841 --> 01:07:52,770
that's a significant weight.
How did one drop in my lap? No,

1124
01:07:52,771 --> 01:07:55,680
how did it come together? I'm not saying
it did jump in your lap. Forbes. Yeah.

1125
01:07:55,910 --> 01:08:00,710
Um, oh my God. The way, the way
media works as well. It was, it was,

1126
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:04,400
it was someone who I'd met through index,
her name was Julie Soopat.

1127
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:06,200
And she was friends with
someone who wrote it,

1128
01:08:06,201 --> 01:08:10,940
Forbes and they were getting brunch. And
she mentioned me and this, the reporter,

1129
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,890
um,
got interested.

1130
01:08:12,891 --> 01:08:16,790
And then I had no idea what I was
and never talked to the media before.

1131
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:21,410
And then Julie, Julie used to run,
um, like PR at Youtube and she's,

1132
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,550
she consults for,

1133
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:27,770
for startups and she's kind of like a
master of all things, uh, publicity.

1134
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:29,510
And she was like,
well,

1135
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:34,310
now that you have someone writing
a profile on you in Forbes,

1136
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:36,650
you,
you probably need my help.

1137
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:41,330
So I don't know if she did
a great job and you know,

1138
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:44,780
so I hired her and she helped me,
helped me, just coach me through it.

1139
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:47,690
She was like, they're going to want
you to look like a billionaire. That's,

1140
01:08:47,691 --> 01:08:48,680
that's there.
You know,

1141
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:51,920
we've had to reshoot other stuff that
I worked on with Forbes because they

1142
01:08:51,921 --> 01:08:55,700
didn't think that the entrepreneur and
his hood, he looked like a billionaire.

1143
01:08:55,701 --> 01:08:59,480
So it's so funny.
It's really funny just how all that works.

1144
01:08:59,481 --> 01:09:02,540
And so now I show up at photo shoots
and I'm like, what do you want me to be?

1145
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:06,020
Okay, I'm bringing it, you know,
it's like so Dorky, but you know,

1146
01:09:06,021 --> 01:09:09,350
it's like whatever. He just tried to
do your best, you do your best. Um,

1147
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,020
what was that, what was
that like? That was cool.

1148
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:16,400
That was was, what were some other
pieces of advice that you got a,

1149
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,730
or things you've learned
about interacting with media?

1150
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:23,980
Um, God, I've learned so much.

1151
01:09:24,010 --> 01:09:25,350
I feel like I could do it.

1152
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:30,010
Give one, always do fact check
corrections via email and not fun.

1153
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:34,990
Yeah,
you need a paper trail of that stuff.

1154
01:09:34,991 --> 01:09:38,940
I've been missing misquoted so
many times. Really? Ah, yeah.

1155
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:41,890
And then that will sneak its way
into Wikipedia and then it's a big,

1156
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,930
big quagmire to fix.

1157
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:45,021
Hey,
I mean,

1158
01:09:45,021 --> 01:09:50,021
I think it's just that like the media
always wants something to talk about and

1159
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:55,280
um, they can, they can skew
things or their own, you know,

1160
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:59,120
for their own fun. And it's, you know,

1161
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:03,230
there was a time where I think I believed
a lot of what I read out there and I

1162
01:10:03,231 --> 01:10:04,730
still believe a lot of it,

1163
01:10:04,731 --> 01:10:09,140
but when there's controversy
it's often just to serve.

1164
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:13,970
Um, you know, it's clicks and you
know, get, yeah. I don't know.

1165
01:10:13,971 --> 01:10:16,070
It's like I don't know what
I'm just kind of babbling,

1166
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:19,270
but be careful with what you say.
Um,

1167
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:22,640
and if you don't have anything to
say then just don't say anything.

1168
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:24,760
I think it's okay to say no.
Yeah,

1169
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,490
definitely. And also, I mean
one thing that I've learned,

1170
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:31,010
cause see if you take
something out of context,

1171
01:10:31,011 --> 01:10:34,260
like one sentence out of a paragraph,
it can make you look like, you know,

1172
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:38,870
a hero or a complete ass or a misogynist
or an asshole or any number of things

1173
01:10:38,871 --> 01:10:41,090
so that the context is so important.
You know,

1174
01:10:41,091 --> 01:10:42,920
what I've been doing for
the last couple of years,

1175
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:45,290
if I send a response
via email to journalist,

1176
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:49,190
I'll just say thank you for
using this in its entirety.

1177
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:53,420
I do not give permission to slice and
dice this if it's going to be cut down.

1178
01:10:53,421 --> 01:10:57,620
I need to give you permission. And A,
not everybody responds well to that,

1179
01:10:57,621 --> 01:11:00,210
but usually the ones who
respond poorly to that,

1180
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:05,060
if it's diplomatically worded or the
people who already had an agenda to slant

1181
01:11:05,061 --> 01:11:09,490
something and it really controvert
unnecessarily sort of, uh,

1182
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:10,900
Cindy Arie waves

1183
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:13,590
and even like the most,
you know, the best.

1184
01:11:13,591 --> 01:11:16,110
Some of the best
journalists I worked with,

1185
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:18,800
they'll write a really positive
story and then their throat,

1186
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:22,500
they'll throw in some shit just for
their own credibility to make sure they

1187
01:11:22,501 --> 01:11:24,280
don't sound like some big fan.
Yeah.

1188
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,900
So there's always going to be some shit
that they like say that you're going to

1189
01:11:27,901 --> 01:11:28,820
be like grumpy about,

1190
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:32,970
but it makes them credible and you just
kinda have to like stomach it. Yeah.

1191
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:37,120
And you can actually, I mean,
you can help them. Also,

1192
01:11:37,121 --> 01:11:41,290
you can facilitate things by saying like,
here are two or three of my detractors,

1193
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:45,160
but that'll, that can also give you, um,

1194
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:49,450
as long as they're safe, factual
attackers. Does that make sense?

1195
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:54,300
Yeah. One you walk like an ogre and heels
and it's like, no. Like, I'm like, go, go,

1196
01:11:54,301 --> 01:11:58,830
go dance in public in fucking heels.
I'm pretty sure I can. It was just like,

1197
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:03,440
no, like, it's fine. But like of all
the things like I can walk in heels,

1198
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:09,300
you know, like, um, just
like pick something, just,

1199
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:13,170
there's plenty of things to criticize
Jesus. If you, if you catch me in like a,

1200
01:12:13,171 --> 01:12:16,690
you know, it's in the corner. I'm
probably picking my nose. Like, you know,

1201
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:20,630
it's just like find something real fun.
Hey,

1202
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:23,860
uh, when, when are you,
when are you happiest?

1203
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:25,910
Oh, God. Um,

1204
01:12:26,270 --> 01:12:31,270
I'm happiest when I'm like running
down a trail in big Sur downhill,

1205
01:12:32,601 --> 01:12:35,830
a little, just a little
downhill, like any,

1206
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:40,460
any jump and you feel like you fly,
like 20 feet is almost like a dream. Um,

1207
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:45,440
I think that's the best feeling is being
like, I'm in a video game, but it's real.

1208
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:48,500
Like this is real life.
And I'm like, yeah,

1209
01:12:48,501 --> 01:12:53,090
I think just like running down a trail
in the forest is like maybe the best

1210
01:12:53,091 --> 01:12:53,924
feeling ever.

1211
01:12:55,440 --> 01:13:00,300
That's such a good answer.
That's a cool, uh, do you,

1212
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:01,253
side note,

1213
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:05,310
if you come back to San Francisco and
I'm sure that'll happen at some point,

1214
01:13:05,311 --> 01:13:06,810
there's a place called house of air,

1215
01:13:06,811 --> 01:13:11,811
which is basically a humongous building
full of trampolines at different angles

1216
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:16,930
and you can feel like you're in
the matrix. It's amazing. Uh,

1217
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:21,770
do you struggle with depression
or anything like that
and you don't have to not

1218
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:22,693
oh,
totally.

1219
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,810
I just struggle with
depression my whole life.

1220
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:27,670
I've been in an hour
therapy my whole life.

1221
01:13:27,671 --> 01:13:30,670
They tried to tell me I had add and give
me some stuff in high school and they

1222
01:13:30,671 --> 01:13:34,540
tried to give me the stuff for depression.
It's make me, made me feel super wired.

1223
01:13:34,930 --> 01:13:37,610
Um,
I,

1224
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:42,070
I think when I got busy that went away.
Um,

1225
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:45,310
more than anything.
I think I started with anxiety so I,

1226
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:48,970
I can hit the ceiling by like 11:00 AM.
Um,

1227
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:52,480
if something just doesn't go right, I
mean, I don't like yell or pound my fists.

1228
01:13:52,481 --> 01:13:56,290
I'm not like a person in the office
who throws things. But if I'm like,

1229
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:59,830
if I'm not happy, ain't nobody
happy. Like in the room, basically.

1230
01:13:59,831 --> 01:14:04,570
It's just kind of like, it's not, so I
don't, I'm not good at hiding my feelings.

1231
01:14:04,571 --> 01:14:05,770
It's,
it's unfortunate.

1232
01:14:05,771 --> 01:14:09,520
And then there's people who value it
and I try to keep those people around.

1233
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:13,680
Um, but um, yeah. Had Depression.

1234
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:16,300
Depression's like a gnarly,
gnarly thing.

1235
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:20,440
How do you, how do you
contend with that? Uh,

1236
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:25,460
and I ask as someone who has similar ups
and downs and has for as long as I can

1237
01:14:26,251 --> 01:14:28,980
remember, but what, what are you,
what are your coping mechanisms?

1238
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,670
Um, if it's, you know, I,

1239
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,690
it's easy to point at things in your
life that are out of your own control.

1240
01:14:35,691 --> 01:14:38,930
Like I've pointed at who I got married
like three months ago, but I have,

1241
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,870
there's been times where I pointed at
Joel and I was like, you're the problem.

1242
01:14:41,871 --> 01:14:45,590
It's like, no, you're just not,
you're not solving your own problems.

1243
01:14:45,591 --> 01:14:50,591
Like I think you can just look everywhere
outside of yourself to fix your

1244
01:14:50,871 --> 01:14:52,700
problems. And thank God
I'm not like, I don't know.

1245
01:14:52,701 --> 01:14:56,150
It's like addiction issues or anything.
Cause I'm totally, if that was,

1246
01:14:56,170 --> 01:15:00,390
if that was it that ran in my family,
I'd be a total mass. I think. Um,

1247
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:06,500
um, I, I know that I've been, I'd taken
antidepressants at different times, um,

1248
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,430
and some are better than
others. Um, but I just,

1249
01:15:10,431 --> 01:15:15,110
I generally like to stay pretty kind of,
I know alcohol,

1250
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:17,210
alcohol can help. Yeah. Yeah.

1251
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:22,160
Wow.
That's so,

1252
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:23,550
yeah.
I'm not sorry,

1253
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:28,390
alcohol reality. I'm
telling you I'm playing,

1254
01:15:28,391 --> 01:15:30,660
I'm playing not to lose
more now though, but, um,

1255
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:34,900
I mean I can have one glass of wine
and I'm like the happiest, most like,

1256
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:38,470
uh, like charismatic, like, you know,

1257
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:42,690
just fun person when and if uses.
Yeah.

1258
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:45,640
And when I'm not drinking, I'm like, you
don't want to walk up and talk to me.

1259
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:49,570
Like I'm not friendly. Like I'm not
unfriendly, I'm just not open, you know,

1260
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:53,290
I'm just Kinda like stuck in
my head, you know. I Dunno.

1261
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:57,820
What, what's your go to
wine drink or your go to?

1262
01:15:58,030 --> 01:16:01,960
Yeah. Um, I, I like white
wine. A lot of bars don't have

1263
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:08,800
white wine, but it would just
be like, uh, I don't know.

1264
01:16:08,801 --> 01:16:13,450
I started drinking chardonnays. I like
those. Oh, I got to go. Verts demeanor,

1265
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:15,710
which is really good.
Right?

1266
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,710
It's really good. Yeah. Good

1267
01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:21,560
one is the cliff family,
the cliff bar people.

1268
01:16:21,561 --> 01:16:24,200
I went to this thing in Napa and my God,
it's so,

1269
01:16:24,201 --> 01:16:29,090
I sound like so cool now, but
I took a, I I like went on a,

1270
01:16:29,091 --> 01:16:31,010
on a bike ride was basically my,

1271
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:35,810
my investors have a retreat every year
and all of the entrepreneurs and they're

1272
01:16:35,811 --> 01:16:37,280
in the, in the, the, um,

1273
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:41,210
the partners at their firm get together
and this is at the cow at cal state

1274
01:16:41,211 --> 01:16:45,260
grants, which is like a really beautiful
place in Napa. Gorgeous. Super.

1275
01:16:45,261 --> 01:16:48,410
Should be pretty schmancy. And then
they have these activities, you know,

1276
01:16:48,411 --> 01:16:50,900
so you don't hear people talk
and there's really cool people.

1277
01:16:50,901 --> 01:16:54,610
Like Jerry Yang spoke at
the last one and um, just,

1278
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:58,000
it's really interesting. And then they
have this, you know, this, these, um,

1279
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:01,190
activities. And one of
them was, um, you know,

1280
01:17:01,191 --> 01:17:04,730
road biking and road biking up to a
winery and then having a glass of wine.

1281
01:17:04,731 --> 01:17:06,770
I was like, yeah, I'm getting
in shape for my wedding.

1282
01:17:06,771 --> 01:17:11,420
Like I'm going to drink wine. I should
get on a bike first. And Oh my God,

1283
01:17:11,421 --> 01:17:15,620
these all these guys, they're all European
for one and they're like, you know,

1284
01:17:15,621 --> 01:17:20,060
they're like wealthy guys who like have
their own shoes and like all the clothes

1285
01:17:20,061 --> 01:17:21,050
and like

1286
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,540
do this. They like to do
it as a thing. You know,

1287
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:27,530
they're like those guys who've had the
cycling so that they're like $5,000 I

1288
01:17:27,531 --> 01:17:28,364
just thought it was,

1289
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:29,331
I thought it was like,

1290
01:17:29,331 --> 01:17:32,400
I was just like going on a bike ride
for fun and I was just, Oh my God.

1291
01:17:32,401 --> 01:17:34,400
It was the only person
that didn't finish it.

1292
01:17:34,401 --> 01:17:39,350
I did get in the car and like get a
ride to the top of the hill anyway,

1293
01:17:39,351 --> 01:17:42,740
and the top of the, at the top of
the hill was cliff family winery.

1294
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:45,580
I don't know why I'm like, I'm like, I
don't know them. I'm not, I'm trying,

1295
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:47,210
I'm not trying to plug anything.
It was just like a,

1296
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:51,710
I'd never heard of governor [inaudible]
and I bought a few bottles into and had

1297
01:17:51,711 --> 01:17:56,270
it shipped to my house. And um, yeah,
I guess, I guess a white crispy wine.

1298
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,890
Yeah, super. That's super
tasty stuff. Uh, sons,

1299
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:04,960
Sarah's pretty good go to
for a lot of folks. The uh,

1300
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:08,380
I guess I usually do it a
gin tonics of Hendrickson,

1301
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:13,330
Hendrickson soda is kind of my go
to if I don't want to have a nasty,

1302
01:18:13,331 --> 01:18:16,000
nasty headache or Tequila as you've seen

1303
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:19,683
really,

1304
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:23,470
you have to, you have to go with the
good stuff if you're going to do Tequila.

1305
01:18:23,471 --> 01:18:24,670
So the costs of that are going to,

1306
01:18:24,730 --> 01:18:28,930
is very expensive but very tasty with
that no head. I mean, you saw me,

1307
01:18:28,931 --> 01:18:31,810
I had a fair amount to drink,
but a no headache the next day.

1308
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:36,820
No cognitive disfunction
felt just fine. Uh, the,

1309
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:39,460
uh,
when you think of the word successful,

1310
01:18:39,461 --> 01:18:43,210
and I know that's a gnarly dicey word,

1311
01:18:43,211 --> 01:18:45,550
but who's the first person
who comes to mind for you?

1312
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:48,800
Yeah,
successful.

1313
01:18:48,801 --> 01:18:53,801
The word success is really conflicted
for me because it sells people this idea

1314
01:18:54,441 --> 01:18:58,520
that there's like a destination.
I think there's people who can,

1315
01:18:58,521 --> 01:19:02,720
man may have manifested things in the
world that make more noise than other

1316
01:19:02,721 --> 01:19:07,550
people, but success can just be as being
a stay at home mom if that's your dream.

1317
01:19:07,551 --> 01:19:09,580
Success can be,
um,

1318
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:13,490
having a small business and keeping
it that way and keeping in laying low

1319
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,450
because that's what you want and
that's the life that you want. Um,

1320
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:22,640
I really want, you know, and as someone
who's public, it's kind of like a,

1321
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:26,870
it's a, it's a, it's a hairy thing
because I'm out there and I'm, I'm,

1322
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:30,560
I have a book and you know, I have a
business and I sell things and whatever,

1323
01:19:30,561 --> 01:19:31,790
but it's,

1324
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:36,940
I just really want people to remember
that they're capable of doing everything

1325
01:19:37,161 --> 01:19:40,190
that the people they admire or doing.
Maybe not everything,

1326
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:44,570
but if your own don't be so impressed.
I guess that's where, you know where,

1327
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:46,670
where my head goes is,
you know,

1328
01:19:46,671 --> 01:19:50,900
there's no reason that you can't have
the things that the people that you

1329
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:53,330
admire,
that you admire have.

1330
01:19:53,331 --> 01:19:57,650
And so it like access just sells this
kind of like ultimate destination when

1331
01:19:57,950 --> 01:20:01,460
even though I've accomplished something
and you've accomplished something and

1332
01:20:01,461 --> 01:20:03,600
whatever, it's like you, I,

1333
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:07,710
I told you I was crying last night and
it's not like we who like my, you know,

1334
01:20:07,711 --> 01:20:11,700
I'm done. I've, I've arrived
or anything like that.

1335
01:20:11,701 --> 01:20:16,110
If you have any amount of hustle and
any amount of humility, you know,

1336
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:21,111
that it all can go away tomorrow and that
you should do everything you can with

1337
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,300
what you have today.
Um,

1338
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:29,880
so I guess it's a very philosophical way
of saying, when I hear the word success,

1339
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:34,830
I don't know what Warren Buffett, I
don't, you know, it's like, I dunno.

1340
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:35,950
Yeah,

1341
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:36,783
it's tough on you.

1342
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:40,970
You said don't ask the cobbler if
you're a brick layer or whatever. Yeah.

1343
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:43,390
I was thinking of Warren Buffett when
you said that because he often says,

1344
01:20:43,391 --> 01:20:48,090
don't ask a barber if you need a
haircut. He's full of those. Totally.

1345
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:50,380
Uh,
the,

1346
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,550
let me ask you just a couple
of a rapid fire questions.

1347
01:20:54,551 --> 01:20:57,210
You don't have to have
rapid fire answers, but, uh,

1348
01:20:57,250 --> 01:21:02,250
just because I know that people will
ask me why I didn't ask them if I leave

1349
01:21:02,351 --> 01:21:04,990
them out. What is your
favorite documentary or movie?

1350
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:10,080
My favorite movie might be
I phone called the color,

1351
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:13,690
the color of pomegranates and that's by,
um,

1352
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,350
this guy served Sergei Haragei snob.

1353
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:20,430
I'm not even sure if I pronounce it
correctly. He was like a Georgian, um,

1354
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:24,180
filmmaker and it's basically a moving
painting. It's just one of the most,

1355
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:25,530
there's almost no dialogue.

1356
01:21:25,531 --> 01:21:29,310
It's just one of the most beautiful
songs I've ever seen. And um, I've been,

1357
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:33,900
you know, I grew up Greek Orthodox and
I'm just still kind of enchanted with the,

1358
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,850
with Eastern,
um,

1359
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:40,020
the visuals of like Eastern Europe.
Um,

1360
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:41,813
yeah.

1361
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:44,580
Sounds, sounds gorgeous. Yeah.

1362
01:21:44,581 --> 01:21:49,490
I need to sort of fill up my roster
so I'll add that to the list. Uh,

1363
01:21:50,190 --> 01:21:53,550
what are you world class at that people
might not realize or what do your

1364
01:21:53,551 --> 01:21:56,620
friends know you're world class at that
the rest of world doesn't know about it.

1365
01:21:56,730 --> 01:22:00,330
Um, wait. Um, what, what
did I put on my thingy?

1366
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:06,330
I Dunno, I didn't read it. So for
those people listening, I, um, I send,

1367
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:08,350
I could look it up.
I,

1368
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:12,180
I send some of these questions in
advance just so people don't get totally

1369
01:22:12,181 --> 01:22:14,460
stumped. Um, which happens, uh,

1370
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:19,280
but I didn't look at the answers because
I want it to be fresh for conversation.

1371
01:22:19,590 --> 01:22:24,030
Uh, I could pick it up. I can
look it up. Uh, bear with me
a second. I'll pick it up.

1372
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:26,830
Oh my God. I can use my brain. Hold on.

1373
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:30,510
That's okay. That's okay.
It's a, so let's see.

1374
01:22:30,511 --> 01:22:35,511
We got a plane catch.

1375
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:40,640
Oh my God. Yeah. Um, yeah,
I guess playing catch.

1376
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:47,050
Yeah, no, I, I'm like, I,

1377
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:51,500
I can have really good coordination
to the point of it like being freaky.

1378
01:22:51,501 --> 01:22:54,110
Like if I dropped something,
I can be like looking the other direction,

1379
01:22:54,111 --> 01:22:56,750
like scratching my arm pit
with one hand and then like,

1380
01:22:57,020 --> 01:23:01,250
like swooping and like cat,
like reflexes like that happens sometimes,

1381
01:23:01,251 --> 01:23:04,820
but it always even surprises me.
And also I'm good at playing catch.

1382
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,860
Did you play athletics or
sports growing up or no?

1383
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:15,470
Um, yeah I played soccer.
I mean I played basketball,

1384
01:23:15,471 --> 01:23:19,310
I played softball when I was like in third
grade and then I played soccer a lot.

1385
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:24,080
Um, I snowboarded a lot.
It never hacky sack.

1386
01:23:27,190 --> 01:23:30,590
San Francisco awaits. Okay. We can have a,

1387
01:23:30,591 --> 01:23:35,500
if we can do some like Hula hooping
devils, teach me how to break down.

1388
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:40,370
I could teach you, I can give some basics.
We can do six stepping next time you,

1389
01:23:40,371 --> 01:23:45,040
you've come along. Uh, what are the
most common misconceptions about you?

1390
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:48,420
Um, oh, I think people,

1391
01:23:48,450 --> 01:23:51,480
well I met some people
yesterday who thought they were
like, I was like, what is,

1392
01:23:51,530 --> 01:23:53,790
what it's fun surprises. He mass.
We spent some time and they,

1393
01:23:53,791 --> 01:23:57,300
I showed them the office and talk to
them about my business and it was like,

1394
01:23:57,301 --> 01:24:01,890
well, you know, what do you,
what surprised you? And they
said, well, you're, you're,

1395
01:24:01,891 --> 01:24:06,330
you're not as egotistical as I
thought. You'd be like, wow. I mean,

1396
01:24:06,331 --> 01:24:08,970
that's not insulting you from any outside.
You know,

1397
01:24:08,971 --> 01:24:12,360
you put yourself on the cover of a book
with your hands on your hips and you

1398
01:24:12,361 --> 01:24:16,980
know, whatever. And, and maybe you
expect something different. But that was,

1399
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:18,270
that was,
that was pleasant.

1400
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:22,970
Yeah. It's better than the
other way round. Like, wow,

1401
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,510
you're so much were mega maniacal. And
I couldn't, God get me away from you.

1402
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:32,270
Uh, if you could have a billboard anywhere
with anything on it, what would it,

1403
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:33,303
where would you,

1404
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:40,370
I could have a billboard. I put
nothing on it and I put it everywhere.

1405
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:46,930
Just an empty, you know,
I'm going to cheat here.

1406
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:51,960
I'm going to go back and see if there's
anything else that you'd stop telling

1407
01:24:53,291 --> 01:24:54,020
women to smile.

1408
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:57,200
Yeah. That's just like such a grumpy
billboard. The right teams. My mind,

1409
01:24:58,490 --> 01:25:01,790
I'd rather have nothing. You project
what you want them to their billboard.

1410
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:07,480
But that's, that's, and
since I've given you this,

1411
01:25:07,481 --> 01:25:10,090
this imaginary billboard,
you're entitled to do that,

1412
01:25:10,091 --> 01:25:12,910
but I want to hear the backstory on
stop telling women to smile. What's the,

1413
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:15,410
what's the, what's the
store? Baxter? Well,

1414
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:18,140
it's something that I've said. I
mean, I've said just like, stop,

1415
01:25:18,230 --> 01:25:22,020
don't tell me to smile or like, I mean,
if you're a girl who's not, like who,

1416
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:25,280
who a guy wants to talk to and you
intimidate them because you aren't like

1417
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:29,660
giggling or whatever, they'll like take
a, it's like you're, you're there for,

1418
01:25:29,661 --> 01:25:32,630
you're there for your pleasure
or I don't know what it is,

1419
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:35,900
but it's happened to me from as
early as I can remember. Just like,

1420
01:25:35,901 --> 01:25:39,680
you should smile more. Just like,
Oh, you look really pretty new smile.

1421
01:25:39,681 --> 01:25:41,930
And it's like, that's nice. Thanks. Um,

1422
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:45,740
but there's something that's like,
you're,

1423
01:25:45,770 --> 01:25:50,360
you're here for me, so can you just smile
if I have to like look at you. You know,

1424
01:25:50,361 --> 01:25:52,310
cause you're making like a woman,

1425
01:25:52,370 --> 01:25:56,270
a woman evaluating me just makes me feel
like emasculated or something kind of,

1426
01:25:56,271 --> 01:25:58,160
you know, like they just like
don't know how to handle it.

1427
01:25:58,190 --> 01:26:02,150
And it's really frustrating
and honestly pretty insulting.

1428
01:26:02,151 --> 01:26:06,500
And then I found out that there's
a woman named, what is her name?

1429
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:08,840
I mean she has like this,
she's an artist,

1430
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:13,700
I think she's in Brooklyn and she started
something called stop telling women to

1431
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:18,560
smile and someone's telling me about the
other day and her name is Tatiana Fuzz.

1432
01:26:18,561 --> 01:26:22,070
Lee's Foz La [inaudible].
Oh my God.

1433
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:27,290
Foz Law leads a day. Yeah.
It's just real long name.

1434
01:26:27,291 --> 01:26:30,680
I'm, I'm embarrassed of
how I did that. But um,

1435
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:35,030
she has like a like wheat paste posters
and like kind of like a campaign,

1436
01:26:35,031 --> 01:26:38,810
like stop telling women to smile. Like
I'm not your baby. That kind of shit.

1437
01:26:38,811 --> 01:26:41,810
Which is just, I wouldn't put, you know,
if I could put one thing on a billboard,

1438
01:26:41,811 --> 01:26:46,490
it would probably be nothing, maybe
nasty gal if it was free, you know?

1439
01:26:50,710 --> 01:26:55,670
Yeah. What was your, what was
your thinking process around,

1440
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:59,450
um, stepping down? Stepping
out of the CEO role?

1441
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:02,073
Yeah.
I just,

1442
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:07,180
my the things that I find myself that I
think I'm good at or not the things that

1443
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:10,390
a CEO wakes up everyday to do,

1444
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:15,640
I'm running an executive team of
sea levels who have more experience,

1445
01:27:16,390 --> 01:27:20,590
you know, then I've been in, you know,
that I've been in business for or,

1446
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:23,920
um, it's just, it's like
there's a, like I said earlier,

1447
01:27:23,921 --> 01:27:27,760
there's just a totally different
skillset that comes with leading,

1448
01:27:27,790 --> 01:27:29,950
leading people and um,

1449
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:35,860
and giving praise and repeating what
you're there, what we're all here to do.

1450
01:27:35,861 --> 01:27:39,280
There's a lot of repetition actually,
and I'm the kind of person that's like,

1451
01:27:39,281 --> 01:27:41,470
what, you didn't hear me the
first time, which is not,

1452
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:46,390
I'm not saying I'm proud of that. Um,
I just think that's kind of how I,

1453
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:51,040
that's just how I roll and I,
you know, I, it, it's a whole,

1454
01:27:51,041 --> 01:27:55,780
if there's an art to leadership
and, um, yeah, I wanted,

1455
01:27:55,781 --> 01:27:59,170
I wanted to focus on the creative parts
of the business, you know, I want,

1456
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,900
you know,
the book kind of had its own it be,

1457
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:06,070
it kind of made me the face of
the company, which I wasn't prior.

1458
01:28:06,070 --> 01:28:10,090
And so there's things that come along with
that that, um, are good for nasty Gal,

1459
01:28:10,091 --> 01:28:12,730
but take my time and take
me out of your office.

1460
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:15,790
And there's nothing worse
than feeling like your,

1461
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:19,570
you've abandoned the people who are
reporting to you who need your time.

1462
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:23,920
It's just a matter of choosing. Um, so I,

1463
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:26,770
you know, I chosen, it was
something that had been,

1464
01:28:26,910 --> 01:28:30,240
that I've been thinking
about for a long time. Um,

1465
01:28:30,910 --> 01:28:31,301
what was,

1466
01:28:31,301 --> 01:28:36,301
what was the first day like or a night
after you made the decision and it was

1467
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:39,120
okay,

1468
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:43,020
you'd finally kind of made the call and
knew that you are no longer going to be

1469
01:28:43,021 --> 01:28:43,854
CEO.

1470
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:46,500
I think it was just a lot of relief,

1471
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,490
a lot of relief and just feeling
like I had done the right thing.

1472
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:53,910
I was really happy for Sherry,
my CEO,

1473
01:28:53,911 --> 01:28:57,420
and it just seemed kind of
like a non event to our team.

1474
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:00,540
I expected more of a reaction, but
they were like, what's the difference?

1475
01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:04,810
Sherry's in all of the all hands meetings
and she speaks and we don't know who

1476
01:29:04,811 --> 01:29:06,180
she is.
What's different?

1477
01:29:06,181 --> 01:29:10,650
That I don't think it was a huge
change for most of our team,

1478
01:29:10,651 --> 01:29:15,530
which felt good. Yes. Yeah. That's great.

1479
01:29:15,690 --> 01:29:16,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

1480
01:29:16,711 --> 01:29:19,590
I expected a lot more questions and I
was kind of bummed that people weren't,

1481
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:22,320
they weren't like, they weren't like, they
were like freaked out and they're like,

1482
01:29:22,321 --> 01:29:26,610
okay, cool. Got It. We've
been waiting for you.

1483
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:32,560
Don't let the door hit you on
the way. I'm just kidding. Uh,

1484
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:38,760
what a $100 or less purchase has most
positively impacted your life in recent

1485
01:29:40,031 --> 01:29:40,690
memory?

1486
01:29:40,690 --> 01:29:43,330
Um,
I had a hamburger yesterday.

1487
01:29:45,020 --> 01:29:45,853
Amber,

1488
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:48,540
what kind of have, what kind
of hamburger and we're, I mean,

1489
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:49,970
was it a particularly early?
Huh?

1490
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:54,640
Interesting hamburger or I no, no, I
mean the one thing, I mean I could, yeah,

1491
01:29:54,641 --> 01:29:56,700
let me, I can think harder on this, but I,

1492
01:29:57,300 --> 01:30:00,780
yeah, no, it's basically just inexpensive
stuff that you get a lot of value.

1493
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:05,090
I'm looking at my,

1494
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:09,470
I mean a manicure
manicures are like pretty,

1495
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:14,090
they're good. They're like, they make you
feel better, but they cost like, you know,

1496
01:30:14,210 --> 01:30:18,510
I get Gel so I don't know, maybe
they're like 20 or 30 bucks. Then. Um,

1497
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:23,600
you're, you don't hit your hands as
much. I don't know what else. Um,

1498
01:30:23,810 --> 01:30:26,720
under $100 not a lot is
under a hundred dollars.

1499
01:30:26,721 --> 01:30:30,920
It's like a hamburger or you know,
probably,

1500
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:34,510
I mean probably a glass of lion.
Oh God,

1501
01:30:34,970 --> 01:30:36,110
that's the theme here.

1502
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:38,850
That's a glass glass wine.
It's good.

1503
01:30:38,851 --> 01:30:43,080
I actually bought one of my favorite
bottles of wine I've ever had.

1504
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:45,240
A I bought from trader Joe's.

1505
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:49,830
They have great wine service that people
really know what they're talking about.

1506
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:54,450
It's for $4 for a bottle of white wine.
And if you want to upgrade that,

1507
01:30:54,451 --> 01:30:56,970
you get the, um, I, I
really like Rombauer. Sure.

1508
01:30:57,070 --> 01:30:58,780
Oh yes.
Ron is good.

1509
01:30:59,570 --> 01:31:04,510
Yeah. 2004 I think I had,
which was amazing. Uh, and uh,

1510
01:31:04,550 --> 01:31:08,270
not that expensive. That was the first
white wine I ever bought a case of.

1511
01:31:08,271 --> 01:31:10,640
I thought I would never buy
a case of white wine ever.

1512
01:31:10,641 --> 01:31:14,630
I've always been a red wine guy and
Rombauer Chardonnay was the one that made

1513
01:31:14,631 --> 01:31:16,820
the difference. Um, what does,

1514
01:31:16,821 --> 01:31:19,460
what does the first 60
minutes of your day look like?

1515
01:31:19,490 --> 01:31:22,250
Now I'm going to ask that
a little retrospectively.

1516
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:26,930
When you were CEO of the company,
uh,

1517
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:31,360
on a, on a, on a, on a day where you
look back and you're like, fuck yeah.

1518
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:35,690
Kicked ass today. What did the first
60 to 90 minutes of your day look like?

1519
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:37,190
Or what were your morning routine?

1520
01:31:37,420 --> 01:31:41,860
Yeah, I mean I usually, and a day that
ends wells one that started with exercise,

1521
01:31:41,890 --> 01:31:45,610
that's for sure. Um, yeah, so cute. Um,

1522
01:31:45,790 --> 01:31:49,510
I usually eat, you know,
for breakfast, so I wake up.

1523
01:31:50,410 --> 01:31:54,550
What time, what time do you
wake up? I Dunno, like six 37.

1524
01:31:55,230 --> 01:31:59,680
Um, most people are like exercising at six
30 or seven, but I'm just, I don't know.

1525
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:04,360
I stay up, I'm like, I keep,
I, I just keep weird hours. Um,

1526
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:06,033
so I wake up,

1527
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:10,210
I take my Invisalign out of my mouth
because I sleep with these braces in

1528
01:32:10,211 --> 01:32:10,751
basically.

1529
01:32:10,751 --> 01:32:13,690
And before that it was a mouth guard
cause they clench my teeth cause I'm a

1530
01:32:13,691 --> 01:32:14,051
freak.

1531
01:32:14,051 --> 01:32:19,051
But I recently botox my jaw so that
I can't clench my teeth as much.

1532
01:32:19,790 --> 01:32:22,220
Whoa, sweet. You injected fat.

1533
01:32:24,690 --> 01:32:29,690
Just something that basically makes your
muscle weaker so that you don't aren't

1534
01:32:30,111 --> 01:32:32,180
such a, I'm like, I'm like hulk smash.

1535
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:34,430
Like I've clenched my teeth
like the fucking hawk.

1536
01:32:35,270 --> 01:32:38,820
Oh No. I, I sometimes
wake up with blow, my God,

1537
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:41,670
why don't you call this way
looking at your face. That's

1538
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:48,030
what I like really over developed
jaw muscles. Like a pitfall I do.

1539
01:32:48,031 --> 01:32:51,420
Let me look at, hold on, let
me look at, I'll just go.

1540
01:32:51,570 --> 01:32:54,720
Okay. Right now. No, but it does,
that's what happens. You know,

1541
01:32:54,721 --> 01:32:57,690
I have a jaw muscle that no,
you don't have a strong job,

1542
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:01,590
but when you're a girl that is like a
kind of a masculine thing, whatever.

1543
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:04,810
But yeah, I'd also just, you wake
up with a headache. So I did that.

1544
01:33:04,890 --> 01:33:09,870
That I think that's helping actually.
Um, yeah. And then I wake up, I probably,

1545
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:14,310
I might pee. Um, I chug
water. I'll try a bunch.

1546
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:16,650
I tried to check a bunch of
water but it don't always,

1547
01:33:17,010 --> 01:33:21,930
and then I drink coffee with
heavy cream in it. Um, yeah.

1548
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:25,440
What to, how do you make your coffee?
We have a thing called a Jura,

1549
01:33:25,470 --> 01:33:30,470
like j u r a some company and it's
just like basically put the beans in.

1550
01:33:30,811 --> 01:33:33,330
It grinds them and it's
just a coffee maker I guess,

1551
01:33:33,331 --> 01:33:38,090
but it's like a fancy coffee maker
and it does it give you ra? Yeah. Um,

1552
01:33:38,370 --> 01:33:41,290
and, but I put, I put hot water
in the glass. I filled that,

1553
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:44,970
filled the mug up about halfway with
hot water and then I put the shots of

1554
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:47,110
costly. I guess it's
a suppressor. I Dunno.

1555
01:33:47,970 --> 01:33:50,190
Are coffee beans and espresso
beans the same thing?

1556
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:55,580
Uh, they are often roasted
slightly differently. Um,

1557
01:33:55,880 --> 01:34:00,880
but my understanding is you're just using
kind of more beans for the volume in

1558
01:34:00,951 --> 01:34:03,890
the case of espresso.
But the darker the roast is,

1559
01:34:03,891 --> 01:34:07,640
my understanding is the lower the
caffeine is interestingly enough. But uh,

1560
01:34:07,730 --> 01:34:09,370
but yeah, you're making, you're
basically making an American,

1561
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:12,860
we use David Lynch,

1562
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:20,360
David Lynch, like are you serious?

1563
01:34:20,570 --> 01:34:22,460
He not,
he not only has trends,

1564
01:34:22,470 --> 01:34:27,170
it'll meditation foundation in
schools for at risk at risk youth.

1565
01:34:27,171 --> 01:34:31,340
He also has his own. Wow
Man. I'm really lisping now,

1566
01:34:31,341 --> 01:34:33,170
but he also has his own coffee.

1567
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:36,970
Look up David Lynch copy. I
just did. It's pretty good. Um,

1568
01:34:37,090 --> 01:34:41,110
that's how my husband
found it. But um, and then

1569
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:44,640
so how can I see, so you have your coffee
with h, why heavy cream? I don't know.

1570
01:34:44,641 --> 01:34:46,610
Someone,
I'm a big fan of him.

1571
01:34:47,910 --> 01:34:51,250
And now the whole thing is that like
fat's good for you? So I carry the last,

1572
01:34:51,251 --> 01:34:54,550
but I already knew that, so. Yep. Um,

1573
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:59,120
and then I'll have, um,
one of maybe three things.

1574
01:34:59,121 --> 01:35:01,970
I have rolled oats with,
um,

1575
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:06,500
a little bit of honey and a little bit
of milk and a little bit of salt was

1576
01:35:06,510 --> 01:35:11,420
raisins usually, um, just made
on the stove top and that,

1577
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:15,250
or I will have, um, a pancake
that I make out of rolled oats.

1578
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:20,350
So I crack four egg whites into a bowl
and then I put two cups of dry rolled

1579
01:35:21,351 --> 01:35:21,951
oats in,

1580
01:35:21,951 --> 01:35:26,951
and then I stirred around and the eggs
kind of help the oats congeal and then,

1581
01:35:27,670 --> 01:35:31,670
yeah. And then I shape it
into a pancake in a pan.

1582
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:34,340
And then I cook,
I like heat it up a little bit,

1583
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:38,840
and then I put it on a plate and I put
apple sauce on it and a little bit of

1584
01:35:38,841 --> 01:35:43,810
maple syrup and I eat it. And
it's really good. Um, I mean,

1585
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:48,170
but it's two ingredients, which
is crazy. Um, and it's, it looks,

1586
01:35:48,171 --> 01:35:51,810
it doesn't look as good as it
tastes. It's pretty decent. It's, um,

1587
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:54,690
yeah, I bet that'd be really
good with like some nuts.

1588
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:58,550
Yeah. Or I eat, drink like a
white smoothie, which is like a,

1589
01:35:58,850 --> 01:36:03,850
has apple and Greek
yogurt and some cinnamon.

1590
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:08,330
Um, and it's just like a pretty
simple, but so some of that stuff,

1591
01:36:08,331 --> 01:36:11,900
some of those recipes came from this
guy that I trained with named Harley

1592
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:12,733
Pasternak.
Have you heard of him?

1593
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:17,230
I have heard that name. Yeah, it isn't.
He trains with UFC fighters probably.

1594
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:18,280
Probably.

1595
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:21,430
He's like a celebrity trainer type and
he has people that work for him and I

1596
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:22,250
mostly,

1597
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:26,330
oh, you know what I'm thinking about? Mike
Dolce is okay. Instead of Harley. Yes,

1598
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:28,150
yes, pastor. But pastor neck

1599
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:32,750
Spock's and stuff, he's awesome. And I've
just gotten some cool recipes from him.

1600
01:36:32,751 --> 01:36:37,190
So those are his recipes. Um,
and then I'll, I don't know,

1601
01:36:37,191 --> 01:36:42,020
I guess I shower, you know, and then I'll,
I'll go work out, you know, depending,

1602
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:44,960
sometimes I do, sometimes they
don't. And then start my day.

1603
01:36:44,961 --> 01:36:48,860
Sometimes I'll roll out of bed and have a
phone call and you know, I've, you know,

1604
01:36:48,861 --> 01:36:51,590
it's like we have a call, we're on a
kind of like a call now and it's like,

1605
01:36:51,591 --> 01:36:53,420
I haven't showered. I
don't know. I'm at home.

1606
01:36:53,690 --> 01:36:56,180
Sometimes I'll have calls for a
while before I go into the office.

1607
01:36:56,181 --> 01:36:59,450
Sometimes I won't go into the office
because I'm working on something that I

1608
01:36:59,451 --> 01:37:01,820
need to focus on.
And that's hard to do in the office.

1609
01:37:01,821 --> 01:37:05,600
And I remember every day is different,
but they all start pretty much the same.

1610
01:37:06,710 --> 01:37:08,930
When you work out,

1611
01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:13,370
what if you could only choose a couple
of exercises for the rest of your life?

1612
01:37:13,371 --> 01:37:13,881
What would they be?

1613
01:37:13,881 --> 01:37:18,680
And the reason I'm asking is I saw this
photograph on your Instagram account, um,

1614
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:20,150
which,
uh,

1615
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:24,730
which I thought was hilarious and it was,
it was you on this,

1616
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,180
I'd want to say an elliptical.

1617
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:31,210
And it said preparing the center for
her wedding day or something like that.

1618
01:37:32,690 --> 01:37:37,380
And because you have a very well,
a very well developed and pollutes,

1619
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:38,980
uh, put it that way. Very,

1620
01:37:43,010 --> 01:37:47,240
no, this is purely anatomical speaking
as a, as an exercise physiologist. And

1621
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:54,040
so those don't look like they came from
ellipticals or is that just a god given?

1622
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:56,100
That's,
I like,

1623
01:37:56,100 --> 01:38:00,420
I can't cause when I think
now you're Greek, Greek,

1624
01:38:00,421 --> 01:38:01,680
Italian and Portuguese.

1625
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:06,760
Oh, all right. That explains it. Okay. So
I, I, I knew only about the Greek part.

1626
01:38:06,761 --> 01:38:11,740
I'm like, not usually, like if it was
like, yes, I'm 80% Brazilian, I'd be like,

1627
01:38:11,741 --> 01:38:12,540
okay,
that makes

1628
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:17,510
no, and people actually like get surgery
and make their butts. It's like, yeah,

1629
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:20,360
if I wear a dress like the top fits,
but then the Bot,

1630
01:38:20,361 --> 01:38:23,450
I can't get the bottom over my hips or,
and then,

1631
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:27,150
or if like at the hips fed and like the
top is too big and I'm not gonna like,

1632
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:29,160
I don't know. I don't, I
don't, I don't want big boobs.

1633
01:38:29,490 --> 01:38:34,230
And then like if I wear pants,
it's just weird. It's not,

1634
01:38:34,650 --> 01:38:36,200
it's, it's like, it's,

1635
01:38:36,340 --> 01:38:39,970
it's weird that like our culture is like
into bots because I think they're kind

1636
01:38:39,971 --> 01:38:41,210
of gross, but, okay.

1637
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:42,871
Well,

1638
01:38:42,871 --> 01:38:46,350
I mean I think you just have to watch
like discovery channel for 15 minutes and

1639
01:38:46,351 --> 01:38:48,360
see like presentation,
posture and all that stuff.

1640
01:38:48,361 --> 01:38:52,800
And mammals have that
fixation I think. But, uh,

1641
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:56,700
the, uh, hmm. Not My
intention to go there,

1642
01:38:56,701 --> 01:38:58,860
but the exercises,
so if,

1643
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:02,190
if you're exercising before
you get started with the
day and you could only pick

1644
01:39:02,191 --> 01:39:03,210
a couple of exercises,

1645
01:39:03,860 --> 01:39:07,110
I mean, you basically asked me why. I
have a big butt, like that's what it is.

1646
01:39:07,111 --> 01:39:12,080
That there's no, no, no, no, it's fine.
I'm not, it's funny. Um, no it's not.

1647
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:14,360
It's not just you do,
what do you do? Well,

1648
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:18,770
if you had to only choose a couple of
types of exercise, not just for the bud,

1649
01:39:19,250 --> 01:39:22,790
not having big, but is that like,
I can go to hell really fast.

1650
01:39:22,791 --> 01:39:27,320
So you have to, you kind of
have to exercise. Um, uh,

1651
01:39:27,321 --> 01:39:32,320
I do deadlifts for my bat or just in
general. I do dead lifts, dead lifts or,

1652
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:35,780
um,
I do a lot of lunges.

1653
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:39,920
I do some walking lunges and like some,
I dunno,

1654
01:39:39,950 --> 01:39:44,840
we just go out sometimes. Um, I'll um,

1655
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:49,200
like resistance training. Um, well, no.

1656
01:39:49,430 --> 01:39:53,070
When you do dead lifts, are you doing
sumo stance with your legs wide?

1657
01:39:53,071 --> 01:39:54,810
Are Your legs closer together?
Kind of like,

1658
01:39:55,090 --> 01:39:58,600
um, there are a little beyond
shoulder width and like slightly bent.

1659
01:40:00,130 --> 01:40:00,963
Right.

1660
01:40:02,250 --> 01:40:02,540
Indeed.

1661
01:40:02,540 --> 01:40:07,340
If you had to choose three types of extra
says just for the combination of like

1662
01:40:07,341 --> 01:40:11,570
enjoyment and benefits for you overall,
what would you choose?

1663
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:16,160
Um,
probably like squat jumps,

1664
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:22,820
box jumps and um,

1665
01:40:23,270 --> 01:40:27,190
let's see, like shoulder presses. I Dunno.

1666
01:40:27,630 --> 01:40:29,060
It seems like you could get a lot.

1667
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:32,420
He's like a lot of different things
happen with those three exercises.

1668
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:37,160
Right. And then you have the mountain,
you have the trail running at a slight,

1669
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:42,500
if I'm in big Sur for the flying effect,
uh,

1670
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:46,490
well I only want to ask a couple more
questions then I will let you get back to

1671
01:40:46,491 --> 01:40:49,880
your day. But this is, this
has been very fun. What did,

1672
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:52,310
what advice would you give
your 30 year old self?

1673
01:40:52,610 --> 01:40:54,100
MMM,
it

1674
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:58,800
doesn't get easier. Uh,
I need, tell me more.

1675
01:40:58,870 --> 01:41:02,710
Oh, I don't know. I mean, I think, I
think when you're, you're like, yeah,

1676
01:41:02,711 --> 01:41:06,130
I'm like onto something. My business
was grinding and I, this is so cool.

1677
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:09,850
I can't wait for a time when you
know, I can just like, you know,

1678
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:12,250
let go or a time where I can,
oh man,

1679
01:41:12,251 --> 01:41:16,030
this is just going to be running itself
someday or I'm going to, I dunno. Like,

1680
01:41:16,031 --> 01:41:20,080
or just you think, you know, as you
get older, I mean, yeah, you know more.

1681
01:41:20,081 --> 01:41:24,550
You can handle things better, but it's
the same. It's the same, you know,

1682
01:41:24,610 --> 01:41:27,310
it's just, it's, it's just
different stuff I guess.

1683
01:41:27,311 --> 01:41:31,840
And the challenges are bigger
with bigger things. Um,

1684
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:33,010
and you know,
I think,

1685
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:37,120
I think if it's easier to sell yourself
or for maybe other people to sell you

1686
01:41:37,570 --> 01:41:41,050
that it's just like one vacation after
the next and hey, I have a great life.

1687
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:44,320
I really appreciate everything that
happened. I've taken some great vacations,

1688
01:41:44,321 --> 01:41:48,850
but just that, like the, the,
the hustle never ends, you know,

1689
01:41:48,910 --> 01:41:53,400
that it was just a year ago
is 30 a year ago. So, hmm.

1690
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:56,770
It would be like hi.
I don't know.

1691
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:03,550
That's right. I keep forgetting that
you're, you're such a young age. Uh,

1692
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:08,560
what, um, what are you most looking
forward to in the next 12 months?

1693
01:42:10,410 --> 01:42:10,810
So far

1694
01:42:10,810 --> 01:42:15,100
in the next 12 months? I'm looking
forward to going to Tokyo. Um, yeah,

1695
01:42:15,101 --> 01:42:16,150
we're going to Tokyo,

1696
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:20,470
my husband and I for like a week and I
haven't been since I was in high school

1697
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:21,910
and it's just,

1698
01:42:21,970 --> 01:42:25,720
I know it's a cool place and
I have some memory of it,

1699
01:42:25,721 --> 01:42:30,100
but things are so different when you're
an adult and I'm excited to to check it

1700
01:42:30,101 --> 01:42:33,790
out and eat food. Now I eat
Sushi. I didn't mean Sushi
when I was in high school.

1701
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:34,570
Weird.

1702
01:42:34,570 --> 01:42:38,330
Oh yeah. Now that opens up
all sorts of doors. The uh,

1703
01:42:38,410 --> 01:42:41,740
well if you ever want to chat about
that. Oh yeah. Just feel free to ping me.

1704
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:43,510
Gimme gimme a call.

1705
01:42:43,511 --> 01:42:48,511
I've spent a lot of time
there and actually have a
two part article on Tokyo on

1706
01:42:49,931 --> 01:42:53,740
the blog that goes through some of the,
the smaller spots that I love,

1707
01:42:54,130 --> 01:42:56,170
but that is exciting. Oh yeah, we can,

1708
01:42:56,171 --> 01:42:57,970
Tokyo is something I
think everyone should do.

1709
01:42:57,971 --> 01:43:02,971
It's one of those completely alien places
for English speakers where you can get

1710
01:43:04,901 --> 01:43:07,240
completely lost,
completely confused,

1711
01:43:07,690 --> 01:43:11,280
even in the middle of the night and not
really be in any danger whatsoever. Yeah.

1712
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:13,970
Yeah. We can leave your purse, you know,

1713
01:43:14,570 --> 01:43:19,040
on like you can like give it to a bomb
and it's probably safe for an hour,

1714
01:43:19,090 --> 01:43:19,923
you know,

1715
01:43:21,870 --> 01:43:26,310
you're right. Perse check.
It's just a fascinating,

1716
01:43:26,311 --> 01:43:27,540
fascinating country.
Yeah.

1717
01:43:27,620 --> 01:43:31,950
It forces you to question a lot of your
own sort of social norms and behaviors,

1718
01:43:31,951 --> 01:43:34,980
which I think is really helpful.
So that's a, that is exciting.

1719
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:39,210
I'm super stoked for it. I'm going to
be headed to Korea for the first time.

1720
01:43:39,211 --> 01:43:41,730
I've only been in the,
some of the hoping to,

1721
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:46,800
hoping to head to Seoul and within
the next month or two. But, uh,

1722
01:43:47,250 --> 01:43:52,130
what, uh, do you have any ask
or requests for my audience?

1723
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:53,810
And, um, we'll, we'll,

1724
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:56,870
the question after this is going to be
where they can find you online and learn

1725
01:43:56,871 --> 01:43:58,910
more about you and so on.
But just in general,

1726
01:43:58,911 --> 01:44:02,720
any like recommendation
or request of my audience,

1727
01:44:02,721 --> 01:44:05,090
any action they should take or
things they should think about

1728
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,170
that's for their own good.

1729
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,500
Uh, yeah, sure. Let's do that.

1730
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:16,970
Um,
I dunno if you compliment someone today.

1731
01:44:17,910 --> 01:44:20,330
I don't know.
Say something nice to someone.

1732
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:25,420
Yeah, it'd be nice. Be
Nice. Uh, awesome. Well,

1733
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:29,140
I would love people to check
out what you're up to. Um,

1734
01:44:29,350 --> 01:44:33,750
you've done such, you've done so
much for such a young man. Uh,

1735
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:39,520
yeah.
Well that,

1736
01:44:39,521 --> 01:44:44,270
that of course is a, uh, a sort of high
praise in mind in my world. But yeah,

1737
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:47,530
the, of course they have. You have to,

1738
01:44:47,860 --> 01:44:51,610
but where can people learn more about
you? Uh, find out what you're up.

1739
01:44:51,650 --> 01:44:56,000
Cool. Um, well nasty gal.com

my reason for existing. And then, uh,

1741

1742
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:07,750
It's Sophia Underscore Amoruso
and I'm launching a podcast.

1743
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:12,380
Uh, I dunno, launching a podcast
next month called girlboss radio.

1744
01:45:12,470 --> 01:45:14,930
And you can read my book. It's
called girl boss. No ma'am.

1745
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:19,610
Cool. Yeah. And uh, people will be
listening to this for quite awhile.

1746
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:22,570
So look for girlboss radio guys.

1748
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:31,580
Four and a half stars,
more than I want to say.

1749
01:45:31,581 --> 01:45:34,530
I'm looking right here.
More than 70% are five stars.

1750
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:37,840

fantastic reception and uh,
