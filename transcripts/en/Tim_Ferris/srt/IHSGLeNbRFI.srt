1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:05,730
All right. What's up guys and Shay?
Carl, thanks for the inspiration.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,560
A number of you reminded me that I was
supposed to do my first vlog no later

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,580
than today as a start to my 30
days of continuous with logging.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,880
I'm on book deadline and it just so
happens the next 30 days exactly coincides

5
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:24,390
with when I'm supposed to finish the book.
So maybe that'll make it exciting. Uh,

6
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:29,391
and certainly anybody who is not watching
this can ask me questions and I will

7
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:34,260
answer for a bit. I'm not going
to do it too, too, too long. Um,

8
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,480
but today was exciting.
Had A,

9
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:41,481
someone land here as a researcher to
help me for the next 30 days with putting

10
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:45,690
things together and didn't get very
much done today. To be quite frank,

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,890
got to about 3:00 PM and realized
I hadn't done much at all.

12
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:52,410
I was just one of those
days and I forget the quote,

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,440
but I believe that somebody said at
some point you could find the quote that

14
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,420
courage isn't always some grant thing.

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,600
It's just going to bed
and saying to yourself,

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,930
I will try harder tomorrow.
Along those lines.

17
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,070
So ask me some questions guys,
and then I'm going to hop off.

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,730
I see they removed the
timer from Facebook.

19
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:19,731
So I'll just do a couple of minutes
and then I'm going to get to bedtime.

20
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,280
Jim Jacobs, how do you
monetize your podcasts? Well,

21
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:26,790
there's direct and indirect income.
Direct income would be sponsorship.

22
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,820
Indirect would be all the relationships
and so on that I develop in terms of

23
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:36,150
network through the podcast. My Favorite
Mall Beck, I like close into the CFA.

24
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,400
I like, uh, here's one she

25
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,820
goes through. CFA is one of
my favorite mall backs. Uh,

26
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,210
thoughts on feeding dogs a raw diet.
Uh,

27
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,960
I think that uh,

28
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,440
feeding some raw food is
probably a good idea. Uh,

29
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,470
I feed my dog some freeze dried
and then reconstituted raw rabbit,

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,750
lamb,
things along those lines.

31
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,100
But modern dogs are scavengers,

32
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,510
so I think that they're pretty well
adapted to eat just about everything. Uh,

33
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,940
I do think they are omnivores,

34
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:19,300
which means including a carnivorous fair.

35
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,910
Uh, let's see. One of my drinking
and not drinking any wine right now.

36
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,620
Uh, how's my compound bow coming
along? It's coming along well.

37
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,820
I'll show you what it looks like and
actually have some tweaks that I'll be

38
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,080
making tomorrow to it.

39
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,200
You can make that out

40
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,860
is currently what I'm experimenting
with and training with.

41
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,950
So I am very much looking forward to a
two hour training session tomorrow with a

42
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:57,240
coach. All right, well
let's keep scanning.

43
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,760
Uh, all right. Why haven't I had Neil
Gaiman all the podcast yet? Well,

44
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,690
I've tried deal is a good guy, but
when he's on deadline, unlike me,

45
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:11,930
perhaps he doesn't get caught up in
using social media to push it off.

46
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,160
Although I made a commitment to Shay
that I would do this and to you guys.

47
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:20,930
So here we are.
A best advice for marriage.

48
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,480
Uh, listen more than
you talk probably. Uh,

49
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,590
let's see.

50
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,120
Thoughts on going from Quito to slow carb.

51
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,600
It's a lot easier than
going from slow carb Kido,

52
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,820
so it shouldn't be too terribly difficult.
Uh,

53
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,030
row the hair hat. Nah, I think, uh,

54
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,130
I think this is my default
these days guys. Uh,

55
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,510
Josh says your dog eats
better than my wife. Well,

56
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,670
you know, I do what I
can. From my pooch, uh,

57
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,070
thoughts on jumping in
the last five pounds.

58
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:04,610
This from Ashley's see the last
mile in the four hour body.

59
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,090
Uh,
let's see.

60
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:09,650
Okay.

61
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,450
All right. A lot of people
are asking about interviews,

62
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,730
not doing interviews right now
because I'm on book deadline.

63
00:04:14,731 --> 00:04:15,810
So that's one of my rules.

64
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:20,811
I'm not doing any media interviews and uh,

65
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,960
alas that is non negotiable cause I
have a lot to do in the next four weeks.

66
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,600
Uh,

67
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,160
uh, what is the scariest part
about stepping into success? Uh,

68
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,490
losing privacy I would say in the privacy
of your family and people you care

69
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:40,290
about that can be very dangerous.

70
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,220
What is most rewarding you
have in Archimedes lever
for doing a lot of positive

71
00:04:44,221 --> 00:04:48,560
good in the world. And uh, and,

72
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,510
and I suppose I'm answering this from
the perspective of someone who's in the

73
00:04:51,511 --> 00:04:56,280
public eye and that's not always the
case for everyone who achieved success as

74
00:04:56,281 --> 00:05:00,320
they may define it. Of
course. Uh, but that is my,

75
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,290
my current answer.
Best piece of advice to youth.

76
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,710
Take risks when you're young
and you are the average of,

77
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,180
actually we were reverse it.

78
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,840
You are the average of the five people
you associate with most and in terms of

79
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,600
entrepreneurial risks,
uh,

80
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,660
ideal to take those when you don't have
any dependence. No Morgan should, etc.

81
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,940
Uh,

82
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,700
all right. Landon. Yes,
please. Please keep doing this.
Yeah. If you guys like this,

83
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,360
let me know. I will
continue to do these. Uh,

84
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,700
okay.
And this is from Brent,

85
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,010
which is related to the earlier answer
in my pit bulls on the raw freeze dried

86
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:43,900
and raw freeze dried vegetables. Their
health is amazing. Yeah. Molly's health.

87
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,720
My dog is just a fantastic,
uh,

88
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,660
okay.
Why the goatee?

89
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,740
Oh yeah.
You know,

90
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:58,520
when I shave I usually use clippers and
if I'm like running out to dinner and I

91
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:01,580
just don't want to look like a homeless
person, I'll take this stuff off.

92
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:03,410
But this is delicate work here.

93
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,030
Now you can really like
Nicco lip or Nicole,

94
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,200
nick a nostril. So this is just
laziness. It's not a stylistic thing.

95
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:16,520
I'll take it off eventually. I don't
actually like having it. Uh, all right.

96
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,320
I look tired. I am tired. I'm on book
deadline and I have a month left.

97
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:25,400
So, uh, no huge surprise
there. But yeah, I am tired.

98
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,050
That's why I liked hired a business coach.
Would I hire,

99
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:34,910
I don't know how to hire a business coach.
I'm afraid. Uh, would I interview Trent?

100
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:39,870
Reznor absolutely. Uh, big booty,

101
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,140
Asian woman.
Where are they and how do I find them?

102
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,360
Not sure I can help you there. Maybe you
go to Brazil and find some mixed blood,

103
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:53,340
I suppose. Uh, let's see.

104
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,210
How do you get rid of bags
under your eyes? Sleep less.

105
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:05,211
Coffee and coconut oil topically
coffee is usually the culprit for me.

106
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:10,470
That's what gives me bags
under my eyes. Uh, alright.

107
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:16,710
Longest time of held my breath is actually
over seven minutes with hyperbaric

108
00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:20,280
oxygen treatment and Wim Hoff
method and a few other things.

109
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,870
But under normal circumstances
with some breath training,

110
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:29,160
I've done more than four
minutes with David Blaine.

111
00:07:29,161 --> 00:07:33,630
I did three minutes and I want to
say 33 seconds. But in general,

112
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,420
my breath hold times are very, very bad.
So if I were to hold my breath right now,

113
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:40,500
I'd probably be 45 seconds. Something
like that. You can do a lot with training,

114
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:44,310
but you don't want to do any type of,
um,

115
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,290
very rarely want to do any kind of breath
work related to extending breath hold

116
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:54,270
time because you're blowing off CO2, uh,
around water. I highly advise against it.

117
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,500
Um, I know a number of people who've
had horrifyingly dangerous shallow water

118
00:07:58,501 --> 00:08:01,920
blackouts from that. Uh, let's see,

119
00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:06,900
best sales book out there for beginner.
I would get persuasion by cal Deni.

120
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,770
Alton Brown, the podcast. Yeah, I'd
love to have them on a low volume.

121
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:16,050
Okay.
Why Paris for the trip?

122
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,930
Because it's a beautiful city and I never,
I'd never spent any real time there.

123
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:23,460
Last time I was in Paris I
couldn't afford a real meal,

124
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,930
so I was staying in hostels where people
were farming and having sex and so on,

125
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:32,970
which is fun I suppose. But I was nice
to have a change of pace and do Paris,

126
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,660
uh,
without any real constraints.

127
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:43,110
Alright. Tried oil pulling and sardine.
It's worked for whitening teeth.

128
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,370
Congratulations. Rigor. I believe it. Uh,

129
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:52,560
am I still on Kido? Uh, Stephanie?
No, I'm not in Quito right now,

130
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:56,670
although I am consuming powdered
oil from quest nutrition.

131
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,360
Uh,
Kido is very boring and um,

132
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,640
it was the choir's a level of adherence
and I'm not willing to follow right now

133
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:10,020
with, uh, with the book stuff. All right.

134
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,020
I'm just going to take a few more guys
and then I'm going to bed because I'm

135
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:15,750
tired. Look at me. Uh,

136
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,580
all right. A wash wash. She,

137
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,330
Robert, you're welcome. Good
Day from Melbourne Cup Day.

138
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,410
Uh, let's see. What would you,

139
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:35,080
what would you set as an average
budget for a year of vagabonding? Well,

140
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:38,890
that varies tremendously and it also,
um,

141
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,450
I think implies that you need to
make all that money in advance,

142
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,560
which I'm not sure is the case.
I know it's not the case. Um,

143
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,340
so I would actually just refer to
the book vagabonding pick it up.

144
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,420
That'll help you with
that question. Uh, right.

145
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,380
I haven't read Ray Pete's work.
Uh,

146
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,070
two to three actions.

147
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,920
Would I take move to the bay area with
the goal of starting a tech business?

148
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:08,460
Mark,

149
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,440
I would volunteer at events where you
can interact with people above your pay

150
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:18,000
grade. So find organizations handling
events, nonprofits and whatnot,

151
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,580
and volunteer and do a great job.

152
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,540
Even if takes you a while to meet any of
the higher ups or people you'd like to

153
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:29,160
meet. Uh, best book to
learn about stoicism.

154
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:29,994
There are quite a few.

155
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,350
I think that Ryan holiday does good work
with the obstacle's the way ego is the

156
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:36,200
enemy. Uh, I,

157
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,900
I really think you can dive right
into the deep end of the pool and get

158
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:43,140
something like the Tao of
Seneca. Um, those, those,

159
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:48,170
that's the audio version of the moral
letters to local leaders and you can get a

160
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,370
paperback version of that
called letters from a Stoic,

161
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,650
uh, which is also very, very good. Okay.

162
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,610
Can't do too many along ones here.

163
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,880
Metallica eighties or after,

164
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,400
I would say master of
puppets and justice for all.

165
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,500
That's it. For me, a handstand work has,

166
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,330
has a stalled a bit,

167
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,100
a damaged a ligament in my
right wrist doing ring work.

168
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,570
I thought I actually broke my wrist.

169
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:31,550
So unfortunately my wrist and goes
back about that far right now.

170
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,090
So I'm not doing any handstand word.

171
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,970
All right.

172
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,200
Who are you and why are you in my
newsfeed? I Dunno. I know who I am.

173
00:11:44,201 --> 00:11:46,900
I don't know why in your newsfeed if
you don't have any interest in me,

174
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,640
any book on how to not
get offended easily. Yes.

175
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:56,530
And this will be where I
stopped this particular evening.

176
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,870
Um, this blog as it were. Um,

177
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,530
the book is radical
acceptance by Tara Brock.

178
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:05,500
If you have issues with getting offended
easily, if you have issues with anger,

179
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:10,450
a few issues with any, a runaway
emotions, reactive emotions.

180
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,470
It's a fantastic book. I loved it so
much that I had her on the podcast.

181
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,750
She's an incredible, incredible woman.
So it also encouraged checking out the,

182
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,400
uh,
checking out the podcast with Tara Brock.

183
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,970
