1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,790
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:06,060
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,303
Question,

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,370
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

5
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,960
This episode is brought to you by audible,
which I've used for years.

6
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,860
I love audiobooks and I've two
to recommend right off the bat.

7
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,190
Number one is pressed my
favorite audio book of all time,

8
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:36,920
and that is the graveyard
book by Neil Gaiman.

9
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,180
The only audiobook I've wanted to
immediately listen to a second time.

10
00:00:41,181 --> 00:00:45,560
As soon as I finished. It's amazing.
You will thank me. The graveyard book.

11
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,290
The second is vagabonding by Rolf Potts,

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,940
which had a huge impact on my life and
formed the basis for a lot of what became

13
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:53,990
the four hour work week.

14

35
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,880
Hello Ladies and germs.

36
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:22,820
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

37
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:27,530
it is my job to deconstruct world class
performers, whether they are from chess,

38
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,250
sports, military,
entertainment or otherwise.

39
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,260
I tease out the routines, the
habits, the favorite books,

40
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,940
etc. That you can use.

41
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:42,941
At least that's the goal and this
episode was a massive success because the

42
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:48,041
guest Seth Goden 10 x to my expectations
and I already expected him to be

43
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:51,200
incredible,
which of course he was.

44
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,740
Seth Goden is probably the best
known marketing mind in the world.

45
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,490
The author of 17 bestselling books that
have been translated into more than 35

46
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:02,470
languages. He writes about the way
ideas spread, marketing of course,

47
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,480
strategic quitting leadership,

48
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,160
and most of all challenging the status
quo in all areas and he does this

49
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:13,960
personally in his own life
in many different ways.
His books include linchpin,

50
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:16,870
tribes, the dip, purple cow,
your turn and many others.

51
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,400
He's also founded several companies
including Yoyodyne and Squidoo, his blog,

52
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,360
which is easy to find.

53
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,810
Just type Seth into Google is one
of the most popular in the world.

54
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,660
He's been inducted into the
direct marketing hall of fame.

55
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:32,200
He's done all sorts of amazing
things and generally speaking,

56
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:36,220
Seth doesn't get into his personal life,
his personal habits.

57
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,650
This interview is an exception. He tells
a lot of stories he's never told before.

58
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:46,540
We get into a lot of details that he has
never disclosed or shared before and we

59
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,520
cover a ton and we had a blast.

60
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,580
His favorite list of audio books
that he listens to repeatedly,

61
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:54,700
some of them once per month, his morning
routine, breakfast, dietary habits,

62
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,460
how he processes email
meditative practices,

63
00:03:57,461 --> 00:04:00,760
why he's fixated on among other things,
coffee and vodka,

64
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,430
despite the fact that he
consumes neither of them,

65
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,470
how to go from wantrepreneur to
entrepreneur and it goes on and on.

66
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,180
We really had a great time.

67
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:15,010
I hope that you also have a great time
listening to it. So without further ado,

68
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,180
please enjoy my conversation
with none other than Seth Godin.

69
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,350
Seth,
welcome to the show,

70
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,590
Tim. It's a pleasure. What
a thrill at the talk to you.

71
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,790
I have over the years just become more
and more fascinated by your entire life.

72
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,780
And I really admire not only the work
you've put out but the entire life you've

73
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:40,740
crafted for yourself.

74
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:45,741
And since day one I think my fans
have been asking me to not will I,

75
00:04:46,471 --> 00:04:51,330
but when will you have Seth on the
podcast? So it's really fun to,

76
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:53,460
to set aside the time and
I really appreciate it.

77
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,240
And we've also ended up having quite a
few mutual friends and I thought perhaps

78
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,020
a fun place to start would be with
something I only learned recently. And uh,

79
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,860
I guess the best way to approach this
would be to just ask you to talk about

80
00:05:07,861 --> 00:05:12,420
maybe your,
how do you prepare coffee or vodka.

81
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,650
Okay. Um, the coffee thing,

82
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,450
we'll start there. I don't drink
coffee. I wish I did. I need a vice.

83
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:26,400
But I like making it, I like the, uh,

84
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,580
act of trying without being one of those
people who's like measuring everything

85
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,780
because that's not my shtick.

86
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,590
To have an intuitive sense of what
makes a good pool of espresso.

87
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,040
And I used to have a fancy slayer machine,

88
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:45,041
which is this super digital hunk of a
device that did not belong in anyone's

89
00:05:45,741 --> 00:05:48,950
kitchen, particularly mine.
So when it started acting up,

90
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:53,390
I was able to sell it for a fair price
and switched in the completely opposite

91
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:56,600
direction to a Swiss made 17 year old,

92
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,590
totally manual machine.
Like you got to pull a handle and um,

93
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,190
I roast my own beans,
which is key.

94
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:08,900
Marco Arment taught me that roasting
your own beans is more important than any

95
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,060
other thing you can do if
you want to make coffee.

96
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,750
And I think there's a metaphor there.
I know there's a metaphor there,

97
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,470
which is you can spend a lot of
time trying to fix stuff later,

98
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,770
but starting with the right raw
materials makes a huge difference.

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,930
Garbage in, garbage out. There you
go, Marco. Just for context for folks,

100
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:29,200
that's Marco and I don't know why I'm
having this mental blank right now.

101
00:06:29,201 --> 00:06:32,410
Of course,
the Tumbler and now overcast,

102
00:06:32,411 --> 00:06:34,870
which is a great podcast
player that I use myself,

103
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,980
really fascinating guy in his own right.
Uh,

104
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,000
why don't you drink coffee and
it hurts my stomach. Uh, and

105
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,680
some people, here's the thing,
some people are gluten intolerant.

106
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,850
I'm just intolerant,

107
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:53,170
intolerant of, we're talking about
food products, food, not humans.

108
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,300
Good with humans. And if you have to pick
one, it's better to be tolerant of you

109
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,790
and the, the, the vodka. Can
we dig into that for a second?

110
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,060
So there's a place near my house called
stone barns that is actually used to be

111
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:11,990
the Rockefeller his summer house
and it's a nice restaurant.

112
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:15,380
And at the bar, I don't
drink either, but uh,

113
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:19,250
I'm told that at the bar they
serve honey oatmeal vodka.

114
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,500
And I reverse engineered the
recipe and have, it sounds still,

115
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,000
but I make it in my basement.

116
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,380
The recipe for those who are interested
is you take a bottle of vodka,

117
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:31,790
you don't want the super cheap stuff,

118
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:34,160
but you don't want the expensive stuff
cause that's a little bit of a rip off

119
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,050
and you pour it over,
uh,

120
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,340
like a pound of just plain old oatmeal,

121
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,010
uncooked and half a jar of honey.

122
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,630
And you let it sit in the fridge for
two weeks during it now and then,

123
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,140
and then you strain it out back into
the original bottle and you're done.

124
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,630
The, the, the feedback and the feedback,

125
00:07:55,631 --> 00:07:58,100
it sounds so odd like an
employee interview or something,

126
00:07:58,101 --> 00:08:01,940
but when I was chatting with a couple
of mutual friends, they said what,

127
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:03,380
what impresses me most,

128
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,400
or one of the things that impresses me
most about Seth is how well thought out

129
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:10,760
and meticulous all of these
various activities are,

130
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:14,120
is that something that started very,
very early?

131
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:18,860
Have you had that attention to detail
for as long as you can remember or did

132
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:22,610
some experience or collection
of people instill that in you?

133
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,580
Well, I think it's really important
that we get the scale properly here.

134
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:28,763
Um,

135
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,970
I am meticulous compared to
an amateur house painter.

136
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:39,180
I am a slob compared to you.
I, if they're not, it's right.

137
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,640
There is nothing about any of these tasks
that could be described as meticulous.

138
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,180
The, for example, the amount of
oatmeal, honey varies wildly.

139
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,570
Every single time there's,
uh, you know, the coffee,

140
00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:55,150
probably a coffee snob,

141
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,630
just turn up his nose at what I'm trying
to do. I don't enjoy being meticulous.

142
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,550
I enjoy,
um,

143
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,200
sort of running roughshod
over the status quo,

144
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,760
learning what I can learn as I go.
But no one has ever accused.

145
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,470
All right. So putting that that,
uh, so derisive term aside,

146
00:09:17,471 --> 00:09:21,250
I think maybe the word that it would
be more appropriate in my mind is

147
00:09:21,251 --> 00:09:23,770
thoughtful. Uh, yes, I'm very thoughtful.

148
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,320
That's what I do because
I'm not good at sports

149
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,590
and uh, I just have to,
I have, because these,

150
00:09:32,591 --> 00:09:34,420
these are things I just
only recently learned.

151
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,730
So I heard from a chef friend of ours,

152
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,080
then you have the most impressive
cookbook collection he has ever seen.

153
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,210
How and why?

154
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,890
Well, okay. So before Amazon,

155
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,540
I was a book packager and what book
packagers do for a living is come up with

156
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,370
ideas for books and then make them,

157
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,410
and I made 120 books in 10 years,
a book a month. I made bestsellers.

158
00:09:59,411 --> 00:10:00,880
I made books that sold no copies.

159
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:04,030
I made books on gardening
and I did trivia projects.

160
00:10:04,031 --> 00:10:07,120
I made a books all over the map.

161
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,190
And the way you do that is a,
you work with an expert.

162
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:15,940
So my second book was professor
heard Barns on the spot,

163
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:21,010
spot and stain removal guide and herb
was the world's expert on spot and stain

164
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:24,850
removal. And the deal was I got his
notebook, he got half the money,

165
00:10:24,851 --> 00:10:29,800
I did all the work. Um, and, but sometimes
you don't have an expert with you.

166
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:33,820
So what you do is you go to the bookstore
and buy every book on the topic.

167
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,480
And that's how my book collection grew
to many thousands of books because a book

168
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:43,510
is a bargain,
still a screaming bargain.

169
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,770
You pay 1520 bucks and you have
something that might change your life.

170
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:51,670
You have something that reminds you 20
years later sitting on the shelf where

171
00:10:51,671 --> 00:10:54,670
you were when you read it.
I love buying books.

172
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:00,190
And so the cookbook thing started with
my mom's copy of the joy of cooking.

173
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,670
And every time I saw a
cookbook that seemed like I
would get three good insights

174
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:06,070
out of it,

175
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:10,540
I bought it because it was a screaming
bargain and then it grew and it grew.

176
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,900
And then Amazon showed up and one click
shopping and maybe you should buy this

177
00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:16,030
one next. And every once, you know,

178
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,230
growing up there,
you know,

179
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,840
people were in my house with the
doorbell would ring and everyone go,

180
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,980
Amazon's here because every
night the doorbell would ring.

181
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,530
So there,
that's where the cookbooks,

182
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,030
if you were, if you had someone
over for dinner, and I've,

183
00:11:34,031 --> 00:11:38,260
I've heard you're an incredible cook and
they said they wanted to learn how to

184
00:11:38,261 --> 00:11:38,890
cook.

185
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:43,420
Are there any particular books that you
would recommend to them or approaches

186
00:11:43,421 --> 00:11:44,200
for that matter?

187
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,640
Okay, so for just about anybody, the
right answer is the four hour chef.

188
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:54,130
Well that wasn't, I intended to be
a softball. I wasn't trying to set

189
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:59,130
that up because before that
book you had a weave together,

190
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,390
you know, a 30 minute narrative to help
somebody think about what cooking meant.

191
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,693
Uh,

192
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,720
my wife got me a Chris Schlesinger
cooking class and it was the only cooking

193
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:11,740
class I'd ever taken.

194
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,960
And in 20 minutes I learned more about
cooking than I think I've learned before

195
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:17,794
or since,

196
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,280
because Chris Basically taught me how to
think about what you were trying to do

197
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:28,810
and basically said a,
you should taste the food as you go,

198
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,890
which is surprisingly small
number of people do. And B,

199
00:12:32,891 --> 00:12:37,891
he said salt and olive oil actually are
cheating and their secret weapons and

200
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:42,440
they always work. You can even add them
to ice cream. They just always work.

201
00:12:42,441 --> 00:12:43,780
So for me,

202
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,430
part of the thoughtfulness is I don't
use a lot of salts and I don't use it a

203
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:52,240
lot of oil because I know I
could, but it's cheating. And uh,

204
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,750
I like to think about cooking again as
a metaphor for most of what you are,

205
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,920
have been teaching the real lesson
that you have been teaching,

206
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:04,930
not the detailed stuff,

207
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:09,910
which is that it costs
very little to find out.

208
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,610
And yeah,
exactly.

209
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,700
Lots of people are afraid to find out
and that's why they're bad at cooking.

210
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:23,380
And there are thing I love about
cooking because my projects like yours

211
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:27,640
sometimes last for years is
that cooking lasts for an hour.

212
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,560
And at the end you have success
or failure. And that cycle of,

213
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,710
I have an idea at four and we're sitting
down at six is one that I liked very

214
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:42,280
much. And I'll tell you a story that
I don't think I've ever told out loud.

215
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,500
Um, I used to go shopping
every single night cause I,

216
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,010
I cooked for the family
for many, many years, every
single night, still mostly do.

217
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:56,290
And um, I would stop at the
Korean Deli near my house. Um,

218
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,060
and it was a fish store.

219
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,920
It was a flower shop and it was
a nice fresh vegetable place.

220
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,590
And the man who owned
it was a friend of mine.

221
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,620
I used to bring him my books when
they were translated into Korean,

222
00:14:08,621 --> 00:14:10,530
which was fun. And, um,

223
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,430
every single night I would go to
get the freshest stuff. Anyway,

224
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,120
a giant evil drugstore chain bought the
place and tore it down and put up an

225
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,130
evil drugstore. And, uh,

226
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,550
so I didn't know how to
commemorate this loss.

227
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:32,590
I ended up going online to one of
those places that sell those brass

228
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:37,591
architectural plaques and I had a brass
architectural plaque made honoring the

229
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:41,590
place and I fixed it to the side
of the drug store where it has,

230
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,900
where it has been for the last five years.
Unmolested it's amazing,

231
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,100
the tangible aspect of
cooking and is something I,

232
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,210
I completely agree with you on compared
to say some of the more abstract or

233
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:57,170
longer term projects.

234
00:14:57,171 --> 00:15:02,171
When you have something to show for your
effort at the end that is very tangible

235
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,940
and tactile, uh, is,

236
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,120
is that part of the reason that you are
as interested in audio equipment as you

237
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:18,140
are of our peer to be?
I've never been to your house,

238
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:21,770
but so I hear that you have the
most incredible sound system

239
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:28,120
many people have ever seen is,
is it's, I mean, is there a, uh,

240
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,700
I don't know what, what, what the
details are, but is, is there a,

241
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:35,870
an analog of tactile drive behind
that or what is the, what is the,

242
00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:36,890
or the reason behind that?

243
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:42,380
Well. Okay, so here's the, you
know, the arc for me for many,

244
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:46,590
many years has been railing against,
uh,

245
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,080
various industrial complexes,
the TV industrial complex,

246
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,200
the educational industrial complex,

247
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,790
and this corporatization
of just about everything.

248
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,980
Uh, there is, I was in China eight weeks
ago. There's a village outside of, uh,

249
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,090
Shen Zen called Dolphin where they paint
one third of all the oil paintings in

250
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:12,740
the world over and over as fast as
they can. These paintings are art.

251
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,330
They're merely paintings.

252
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,840
They are what happens if a giant big
box store needs 10,000 oil paintings?

253
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:24,650
This is how they get them.
Uh, what I discovered,

254
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:28,700
I was at my friend Steve's house 20
years ago and he had a big pile of this

255
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:30,350
magazine called stereophile.

256
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,480
Stereophile is handmade magazine about
handmade audio equipment with people

257
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:39,530
arguing with each other about this, that,
and the other thing, a lot of arguing.

258
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,580
And it was really fun
to read. And, you know,

259
00:16:43,581 --> 00:16:45,440
I have no interest in baseball whatsoever,

260
00:16:45,441 --> 00:16:49,970
but this was like baseball and that you
could track the careers of the various,

261
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:54,800
uh, artisans and you could be on one
side or the other of these discussions.

262
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,290
So for me, uh, you know,

263
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:01,940
I started by buying inexpensive used
stuff and there's a marketplace online

264
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:06,860
called audio gone with no e at the end
where you can find people who buy things

265
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:10,190
new and sell them six months
later in perfect condition. Uh,

266
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:14,240
and I found that
connecting to the artisan,

267
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,840
understanding their point of
view of finding the guy in,

268
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,830
I think he's in Cleveland who
makes speaker wires by hand,

269
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,400
finding the, uh, Paul McGowan in Boulder,

270
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:29,240
Colorado who is at the cutting edge
of certain parts of the stereo,

271
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:33,920
but not other ones. Making them in
boulder with a team of people. Uh,

272
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:38,960
it gives me pleasure and that pleasure
is a placebo that makes the music sound

273
00:17:38,961 --> 00:17:40,200
better.
Um,

274
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,780
and the act of carefully choosing what
you're going to listen to and knowing

275
00:17:44,781 --> 00:17:48,770
that the heritage and the
terroir of the thing behind it,

276
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,460
it feels to me, uh, like a productive
hobby that doesn't hurt anybody.

277
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,380
So it's something I spent some time on.

278
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,440
How do you consume media or if or what
type of media do you consume as it is,

279
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,880
is the bulk of it's still in
book form that is a hard copy or,

280
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,420
uh,
how do you consume media?

281
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,660
Well,
I'll start with,

282
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:16,490
I don't watch any television that's live
and I feel strongly that most people

283
00:18:16,491 --> 00:18:21,460
shouldn't. Um, I think that one
of the single best hacks, uh,

284
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,620
is that after Seinfeld lawn off the air,
that was it.

285
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:29,650
And we ripped it out and it frees up
hours and hours every day to explore media

286
00:18:31,641 --> 00:18:36,320
or content that's up to you as
opposed to somebody else. Um,

287
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:41,300
so, and I don't watch any TV at
home recorded or otherwise, but,

288
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,560
so that leaves me with books
and kindle and music mostly. Uh,

289
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,510
the thing with books is,
uh,

290
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,830
I really don't have the
patients for literature.

291
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,540
I didn't grow up with literature.
I was an engineering college. Uh,

292
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:02,550
and I just never got the knack
for decoding really dense fiction.

293
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,080
Um,
and so on the other hand,

294
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:11,110
like you every day the mailman
brings unsolicited books in the mail.

295
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,160
So there's a,

296
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,240
a very high throughput of reading books
before most good people get to see them.

297
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,320
And once you do enough, you don't have
to read the whole thing to get the joke.

298
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,470
And every once in a while it's good enough
that you keep going. Uh, if I blurb it,

299
00:19:29,471 --> 00:19:32,480
it means I went all the
way to the end. But, um,

300
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,890
I love reading books on paper.

301
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:41,430
It's harder for me to read books on the
kindle when I'm not traveling because it

302
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,320
doesn't have that Proust.
Ian,

303
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,500
a reminder to me of what
a book actually means.

304
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,920
So one of the things
people in my generation are
discovering is that people who

305
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:58,021
are 20 or 30 are coming up viewing
books as nothing but a reminder of to

306
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:03,310
drudgery of high school.
And if a book is on an electronic device,

307
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:04,930
it's one click away from email.

308
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:09,910
And email is always better than
reading a book if you're 25. Um,

309
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and so I fear for the future
of our medium because it's not,

310
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,980
it doesn't have the,
the place in our culture that he,

311
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,080
he's too.
How do you

312
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,960
determine,

313
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:29,961
and if the book blurb of particular
example is going to just create a delusion

314
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:32,840
that you don't want, we don't have
to address that one, but I've,

315
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:37,350
I've been very impressed in some of our
conversations by the rules that you've

316
00:20:37,351 --> 00:20:42,100
established for yourself for saying
yes or no to certain things. Uh,

317
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,230
and perhaps we could start if you're
willing to talk about it with speaking

318
00:20:46,231 --> 00:20:46,830
engagements,

319
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:51,830
like how do you speaking engagements
as you've experienced it if you have a

320
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:54,460
successful book.
I went from kind of zero to 60,

321
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:59,461
very quickly unexpectedly and said yes
to everything and it just turned into a

322
00:21:00,071 --> 00:21:01,840
parody of up in the air.
I mean,

323
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:05,500
I felt like a traveling salesman or
Jack Lemmon and Glengarry Glen Ross was,

324
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,820
it was horrible. How do you,
what are your rules for,

325
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,770
for instance,
speaking engagements,

326
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,820
it for whatever your to whatever extent
you're comfortable talking about them.

327
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:20,210
Oh, I'd be happy to. And then I'll scroll
back a little bit and tell you why.

328
00:21:20,211 --> 00:21:24,020
I have to have rules for things like that.
Um,

329
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,880
for speaking engagements,

330
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:31,340
I don't want to do more than
30 a year because they are,

331
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,680
at least for me,
uh,

332
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,740
not additive to the joy of my day
except for the hour I'm on stage.

333
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,700
So I am prepared to do an unlimited
number of speaking engagements in Zip Code

334
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:46,850
One oh seven Oh six, um, you know,

335
00:21:46,851 --> 00:21:49,500
Monday I'm going to Carnegie Hall to talk,
uh,

336
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:54,730
for free to 25 music students who have
devoted their lives to doing what they

337
00:21:55,851 --> 00:21:59,300
do. And it's a privilege to
do something like that. Um,

338
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,330
if I have to get on an airplane,
it's a whole other project.

339
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:07,180
So I think really hard about what
impact am I trying to make. Um,

340
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,630
and will this help me,
uh, move things forward,

341
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,630
which is the, where this nests into. Uh,

342
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:19,220
my mentor and late friend Zig
Ziglar used to talk about, uh,

343
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,930
the idea he used to say,

344
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,590
I've never changed anyone's
life with a speaking Gig,

345
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,630
but sometimes I do a speaking gig and
they buy my cassettes and if they buy my

346
00:22:29,631 --> 00:22:33,650
cassettes, I got a shot at
changing their life. And for me,

347
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,330
my mission and has been for a long time
is to make a certain kind of change

348
00:22:38,331 --> 00:22:42,230
happen. I want to help people
see the world differently.

349
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,550
And if they choose to make a different
choice after they see the world

350
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:47,384
differently,

351
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:52,450
I want to help people connect to each
other and to use that connection to make

352
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:57,620
things better.
And I don't want to be a TV personality.

353
00:22:57,621 --> 00:23:02,120
So the question is how do I
bring that teaching to people?

354
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:07,420
And what I've found is it's a very unique
situation when you have 500 or 5,000

355
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:13,340
high powered people in a room who didn't
expect that you were going to be there.

356
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:18,230
But now that you're there are
eager to hear what you have to say.

357
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:23,240
And they set aside their Twitter account
and they set aside their preconceptions.

358
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,910
And for 45 minutes or an hour,

359
00:23:25,911 --> 00:23:30,170
you have a screen that's 30 feet by 20
feet and you have a microphone that's

360
00:23:30,171 --> 00:23:34,370
amplified. And maybe just maybe
you can get under their skin.

361
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:39,260
And if you do, maybe just, maybe they
go back to their office and you know,

362
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:42,200
get 10 copies of your turn and
hand them out to their team.

363
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:47,510
And then I can, you know, do
that practice that I seek,

364
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:52,340
which is to change the conversation.
So that's why I do it at all.

365
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,900
And the,

366
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:59,140
uh, and the further away it is, the less
likely you are to say yes. Does that act,

367
00:23:59,150 --> 00:23:59,983
is that fair?

368
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,980
Oh yeah. Well, yeah. What I did was, uh,

369
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:06,840
having studied a little bit of economics
is I changed, I changed the price.

370
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,590
Uh, Los Angeles costs three
times as much as New York.

371
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,740
And if you don't think that's fair,
then don't make me go to Los Angeles.

372
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,640
And you said, um, you're going to
elaborate on why you need rules.

373
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:21,020
And maybe you just did.
Maybe that was

374
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,480
the, the, the answer. But you
know, the phone rings, right?

375
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:30,510
And lots of people want a thing and if
it doesn't align with the thing that is

376
00:24:31,141 --> 00:24:35,100
your mission and you say yes,
then now it's their mission.

377
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:40,770
And there's nothing wrong with being
a wandering generality instead of a

378
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:45,771
meaningful specific but don't expect
to make the change you seek to make if

379
00:24:45,781 --> 00:24:49,740
that's what you do. That did you
know the thing is, and Derrick,

380
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,650
I thought your interview with Derek was
one of the best ones you've ever done.

381
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,390
Thanks Derek. Makes it quite
easy. Derek Sivers is awesome.

382
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:58,650
I adore him.

383
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:03,710
And he talked about offense versus
defense and if you think hard about one's

384
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:06,204
life,

385
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,370
most people spend most of their
time on defense in reactive mode,

386
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,330
definitely in playing with the cards
they got instead of moving to a different

387
00:25:15,331 --> 00:25:19,890
table with different cards instead
of seeking to change other people,

388
00:25:19,891 --> 00:25:21,270
they are willing to be changed.

389
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:26,690
And part of the arc of what I'm trying
to teach is everyone who can hear this

390
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:32,970
has more power than they think they do.
And the question is,

391
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:34,470
what are you going to do with that power?

392
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,190
Because it comes with a
responsibility right out of Spiderman.

393
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,200
But that responsibility is you're going
to make change happen or you're going to

394
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,790
ignore it. And if you make
change happen and that's on you.

395
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,500
Yeah,
it does.

396
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,170
Just pausing as I was thinking of how
well anyone who's listening to this

397
00:25:53,171 --> 00:25:58,120
podcast relative to the vast
majority of people on the planet,

398
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,420
uh, how well they are
doing for whatever reason.

399
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,970
I was just bridging the gap between
our little text exchange, uh,

400
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:10,480
before the call where I asked you if
you are ready and you said born ready.

401
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:15,010
Not Actually, I was born naked
and afraid and unable to read,

402
00:26:15,011 --> 00:26:17,770
unable to type in SAP.
If you look at that progression,

403
00:26:17,771 --> 00:26:21,100
making it from there to
where we are collectively,

404
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:24,840
everyone listening to this podcast
or being on it, it's, it's,

405
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,980
it's pretty astonishing. Uh, the,

406
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,300
can I just interrupt you
for a second? Yes, sir.

407
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,040
I think that's part of the
secret plan of Tim Ferriss,

408
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,550
which is that when you
came out of the gate,

409
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:42,580
it was or felt like here
are some techniques and some
shortcuts and it was seen

410
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:49,080
as a, uh, you know, an early
version of the life hacking thing.

411
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,990
But I don't think that's
what you're really doing.

412
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,650
I think what you are really doing
is saying to people, all right,

413
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:01,070
now that you are so much
more fit in every area,

414
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,100
mentally, physically,
emotionally, spiritually, what
are you going to do with it?

415
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,330
And when you think about the
Seneca stuff and the podcast,

416
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,660
that's where you've been going
for a long time. And I, for one,

417
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,440
just wanting to call you out and applaud
you on it because it's not the easy

418
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:17,250
path.

419
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,720
It's the path that's important and you
have been consistent and shown up and

420
00:27:21,721 --> 00:27:22,554
done the work.

421
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:27,930
Thank you. Uh, that means,
uh, that means a lot to me.

422
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:30,680
And you're correct.
I,

423
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:34,500
the tactics get people
in the door so to speak.

424
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:38,010
But then the question is,
all right,

425
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:42,210
once you have more of this finite resource
called time and you've sharpen the ax

426
00:27:42,211 --> 00:27:46,910
in these various areas, where do you
apply your effort? Uh, and you know,

427
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,820
I would, this is, this is maybe going to
turn into a therapy session for myself,

428
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:53,790
but I've found myself,
I mean,

429
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:56,160
we're just talking about books
and their place in culture,

430
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:01,920
feeling like I'm in a transition point
and you've been so consistent and so

431
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:05,880
present for so many people for
so long, your readers, et cetera.

432
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:11,250
Uh, how do you navigate big
transitions in your own life?

433
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:14,280
And that's a very general question.
But for instance, I find my,

434
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,800
the reason the podcast started
as cause burned out on books,

435
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:19,680
it was after the four hour chef,
670 some odd pages.

436
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,430
I just felt so battle weary and,

437
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,110
and run down by publishing
that I wanted to take a break.

438
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:33,140
And the podcast was a side project
that then became its own entire thing

439
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,223
altogether.

440
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,510
But when you find yourself wondering
maybe what to do next, I mean,

441
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:44,400
how do you navigate some of those
larger transitions? And I mean,

442
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:46,500
if you have any examples
that come to mind,

443
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:52,350
I, well, the good news is you did
exactly the right thing and I applaud it.

444
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,560
It's not easy to do that because it
means going from a place where by outside

445
00:28:57,691 --> 00:29:02,280
measures you are about to succeed again
to a place where by outside measures you

446
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:05,790
might not. And hence the
model of this might not work.

447
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:11,100
And so on a good day,
my story to myself is this might not work.

448
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,250
That's my job to do something
that might not work.

449
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,910
And the number of projects I've done a
big and small exceeds most people's and

450
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:25,200
the number of failures I have
dramatically exceeds most people's.

451
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:26,550
And I'm super proud of that.

452
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:31,610
More proud of the failures
than the successes because
it's about this mantra of

453
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,130
Wa is this generous?
Is this going to connect?

454
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,040
Is this going to change people for
the better? Is it worth trying?

455
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:43,370
If it meets those criteria and I
can control myself into doing it,

456
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,880
then I ought to write.

457
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,540
And the transitions aren't easy.

458
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:54,460
I regularly spend months telling people
that I'm unemployed and in between

459
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:56,980
projects. And, um,

460
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,700
I regularly publicly quit
the book business, uh,

461
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,270
which I did maybe for the last
time a year, two years ago,

462
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,740
more than two years ago. Uh,
your turn came out a year ago,

463
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,260
November. So what is that, 15 months ago?

464
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,660
And I haven't written one
word of a book since then.

465
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,180
What was the word I'm smelling? I
haven't written. Oh, I basically,

466
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:22,000
I've written one word of
a book, sorry. And uh,

467
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:27,510
and the reason is the people who I seek
to serve don't want me to write another

468
00:30:28,271 --> 00:30:32,290
book. They want me to do
something else instead. And uh,

469
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,980
they people come up to me as they
might come up to you and say,

470
00:30:38,081 --> 00:30:40,760
you should be really proud of me.
I finished your book. You don't,

471
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,260
no one goes up to Steven Spielberg and
says, you should be pretty proud of me.

472
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:48,470
I finished all of Vt. I made
it. Did he ended the VP. Right.

473
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:53,080
And so, you know, with your turn, I
designed it. I illustrated it myself.

474
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:58,081
I made it so that people would
happily share it with each other.

475
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,430
Because when you share a book,

476
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,790
sometimes you feel a little guilty
cause someone might feel guilty for not

477
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:05,230
finishing all 600 pages.

478
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,940
But when you share maybe a podcast or
a blog poster and illustrated book,

479
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:14,980
it makes you feel closer to that person
in the sense that you're both going to

480
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:19,890
enjoy this journey.
And just,

481
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,110
just to peek behind the curtain a
little bit with some of your decisions,

482
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:29,370
how did you decide or what is the
thinking behind a daily blog versus,

483
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:30,670
say,

484
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:35,050
a longer blog post once a week
or at some other frequency?

485
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,030
So the daily blog,
uh,

486
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:43,590
evolved and it's one of the
top five career decisions
I've ever made in terms of

487
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:52,140
having a practice that resonates with
the people who I needed to resonate with,

488
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,900
that I can do forever and have been
doing for more than eight years now.

489
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:03,430
Um, and that leaves a trail behind.
I don't need anyone's permission.

490
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,850
I don't need to go out and promote it.
I don't use any analytics.

491
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,200
I don't have comments.

492
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:11,740
It's just this is what I noticed today
and I thought I'd share it with you.

493
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,060
And for awhile,
uh,

494
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,200
it was an intermittent blog and then it
was a five times a day blog and that,

495
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:24,040
you know, I do write five posts a day.
I just don't publish five posts a day.

496
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,090
Uh,

497
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:30,090
but it became clear that I could get
the appropriate amount of mind space in

498
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:33,760
that period of time. Now
I'll tell you, I got,

499
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,990
I've gotten this note maybe eight
times in the last couple of years.

500
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,640
It's enraging and the note says,

501
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:44,120
I wish you wouldn't post every day.

502
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,050
I can't read that fast.
Please post fewer.

503
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,180
And the thing is,

504
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,140
it's so selfish because all you
gotta do is just skip some of them.

505
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:59,600
These people don't want other people
that we reading the posts if they can't

506
00:32:59,601 --> 00:33:00,434
read it.

507
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,070
Oh Man.
And the uh,

508
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,910
when you say you wrote where you write
five posts today, just don't publish five.

509
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:14,380
Is that because you are writing them in
advance to publish all of them later or

510
00:33:14,381 --> 00:33:18,070
you write five and discard four and
keep the best one or something else?

511
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:22,580
There is no ritual. They're just, I
just notice things. I write them down.

512
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,900
I look at them,

513
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:28,550
I look at the post before
is next in the queue. I say,

514
00:33:28,551 --> 00:33:33,200
could I do better than that? I tried
different one. So it just averages out.

515
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:36,260
I mean it's not like there's this method,
I have no method.

516
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:41,940
Do you draft by hand in word
in a particular program?

517
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:46,480
I typewrite into typepad
right when I'm in tech.

518
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,960
So I learned this from chip Conley. Have
you had chip on the show? I haven't,

519
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,030
but I'd love, chip is
a great guy. Great Guy.

520
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:56,100
So chip and I went to business
school together and um,

521
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,720
he was the,
uh,

522
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:02,110
third youngest person in the class and
I was the second youngest person in the

523
00:34:02,111 --> 00:34:04,960
class. So he, he got five of us together.

524
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:10,140
And every Tuesday night we met in the
anthropology department for four hours and

525
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:15,900
we brainstormed more than 5,000 business
ideas over the course of the first year

526
00:34:16,481 --> 00:34:21,160
of business school who was magnificent.
It wasn't official, it wasn't sanctioned.

527
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:23,260
It was just chip said,
let's do this. And we did.

528
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:26,650
And he picked the anthropology department
cause he knew someone there and could

529
00:34:26,651 --> 00:34:31,480
get the conference room. And he said, this
is the only place we will ever do this.

530
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,510
And the reason is when
you walk into this room,

531
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,740
you will associate this room
with what we do here. That's all.

532
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:44,260
And I feel the same way about my blog.
If I am in the typepad editor,

533
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,350
I know exactly what my
brain needs to feel like.

534
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,330
And then the writing happens.

535
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,030
Do you,
uh,

536
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:56,450
what is your writing warmup look like?

537
00:34:56,451 --> 00:35:00,050
And when do you typically write a, one of
my fans said that you'd, at some point,

538
00:35:00,051 --> 00:35:00,801
this could be a misquote,

539
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:05,801
but said that you had an elaborate or
extreme sort of mental warmup for writing.

540
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:09,230
But what, what is, what
is the f what is your,

541
00:35:09,231 --> 00:35:11,750
do you write in the mornings or
what time do you typically write?

542
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:16,530
Okay, so now I needed to tell you about
Stephen King's pencil. Yes, please.

543
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,200
Cause I feel very strongly about this.
Um,

544
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:23,730
Stephen King often goes to writer's
conferences and there'll be this question

545
00:35:23,731 --> 00:35:25,380
and that question.
The next question.

546
00:35:25,381 --> 00:35:28,440
And inevitably someone raises
their hand and says, Steven King,

547
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:32,670
you're one of the most successful,
revered writers of your generation.

548
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,800
What kind of pencil do you use

549
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,920
and I won't go there. It doesn't
matter. It's a way to hide.

550
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:46,950
It's not interesting to me to talk
about how I do it because there's no

551
00:35:47,471 --> 00:35:52,471
correlation that I have ever encountered
between how writers write and how good

552
00:35:52,571 --> 00:35:56,530
their work is. So you should just
move on because it doesn't matter.

553
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:02,260
All right. So I will, let me, I'll
make a confession then, which is,

554
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:06,970
uh, I've been given certain
types, what I feel blocked,

555
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,920
which does happen with writing.

556
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,730
I take a long time to get to the point
where I feel like I have the balls in the

557
00:36:12,731 --> 00:36:15,100
air well enough to put pieces together.

558
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:19,270
It's just takes me a long
time to synthesize, but not
unlike some coders I guess.

559
00:36:19,271 --> 00:36:24,190
But the point I was going to make is
that I went to a conversation between Po

560
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,230
Bronson or writer and,
and another gent.

561
00:36:26,231 --> 00:36:30,340
I'm blanking on his name and
I asked Po during the Q and a,

562
00:36:30,341 --> 00:36:34,210
what he did when he felt blocked or
couldn't figure out what to do next in

563
00:36:34,211 --> 00:36:37,930
writing. And he said, right,
what makes you angry? Write
about what makes you angry.

564
00:36:37,931 --> 00:36:40,600
And I,
I found that very helpful.

565
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:45,630
It was a very helpful way to at least
get the hand or the brain moving to break

566
00:36:46,631 --> 00:36:48,930
the ice. Uh, I totally agree. Yeah.

567
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,520
That's not the question. But if
you, if you said to Po Bronson,

568
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:57,200
how do you write these books that are
remarkable and thoughtful and generous?

569
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:02,000
I don't think his answer is every morning
I get as angry as I can and no. Agreed.

570
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,230
Agreed.
I agree.

571
00:37:03,231 --> 00:37:08,231
So you and I could list 25 tricks that
help us get past the resistance and stark

572
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:12,050
the flow of writing.

573
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:17,830
But that's different than saying I need
to do it like those other people do it.

574
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,130
Agreed. Agreed. I guess, uh, the,

575
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:26,200
in the buffet of things that have
been helpful along those lines, if,

576
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:30,040
if for whatever reason didn't get
a good night's sleep feeling off,

577
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,120
you sit down to write

578
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,050
right? This I got, this is
easy. All right. The answer
to this question is right.

579
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:39,080
Write poorly,
continue writing poorly.

580
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:44,270
Write poorly until it's not bad anymore
and that you will have something you can

581
00:37:44,271 --> 00:37:48,320
use that people who have trouble
coming up with good ideas.

582
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,330
If they're telling you the truth will
tell you they don't have very many bad

583
00:37:53,331 --> 00:37:56,960
ideas.
But people have plenty of good ideas.

584
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,990
If they're telling you the truth will
say they have even more bad ideas.

585
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,480
So the goal isn't to get good ideas.

586
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,780
The goal is to get bad ideas because
once you get enough bad ideas,

587
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,850
then some good ones have to show up.

588
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:14,540
Yeah, that's, I remember this brings to
mind a, I have a photo of it somewhere,

589
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:19,541
but all of the title that all of the
brainstorm titles for the four hour work

590
00:38:21,551 --> 00:38:23,000
week,
that we're not the four hour work week.

591
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:26,420
I mean for those people who think the
four hour work week sounds like a bad

592
00:38:26,421 --> 00:38:30,260
infomercial product. I mean you should
have seen some of the, some of the, uh,

593
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,160
the outcast on this page. They
were horrible. I mean I can't even,

594
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,130
I atrocious just

595
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:40,690
to even look back at some of them,
but the, the blog and the daily,

596
00:38:40,691 --> 00:38:44,400
Blake said it was one of your
top five business decisions. Uh,

597
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:48,520
what are some of the other top
business decisions that you've made?

598
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,590
Uh,
okay.

599
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:55,591
So we'll go way back and I would say the
first one which is useful to everybody

600
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,390
is sell something that people want to buy.
A,

601
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:04,240
my friend Lynn is a brilliant,
brilliant thinker and designer.

602
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:09,570
And for years she was in the business
of designing toys and a soft goods for

603
00:39:11,621 --> 00:39:12,850
moms with toddlers.

604
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:18,310
And every toy company in America
was mean to her, rejected her,

605
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:21,790
had nothing to do with her.
And I said, Lynn, it's simple.

606
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,370
Toy companies don't like toy designers.

607
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,160
They're not organized to do
business with toy designers.

608
00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:30,130
They're not hoping toy designers
will come to them. I said,

609
00:39:30,131 --> 00:39:35,131
come with me into the book
business because every day
there are underpaid really

610
00:39:35,171 --> 00:39:40,171
smart people in the book business who
wake up waiting for the next great idea to

611
00:39:40,691 --> 00:39:44,200
come across their desk. They're
eager to buy what you have to sell.

612
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:48,580
And within two months she
did the decks of cards,

613
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:53,080
the 52 decks and so more than
5 million decks of cards.

614
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,650
Um,
and that's because they appreciated her.

615
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:01,330
So if you think about how hard
it is to push a business uphill,

616
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,650
particularly when you're just getting
started, one answer is to say,

617
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,500
why don't you just start a
different business? A business
you can push down hill.

618
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:17,210
This is a, this is a good lesson. Yeah.
Sometimes I, there's a fetishizing of the,

619
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:21,780
the sort of rolling of the stone like
sis, is that, am I getting that right?

620
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:24,860
[inaudible] and uh,
you know,

621
00:40:24,861 --> 00:40:28,610
in Silicon Valley and it's just like
fetishizing of its, uh, of the pain.

622
00:40:28,611 --> 00:40:33,140
And I'm like,
maybe your model is just too difficult.

623
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:37,780
Amazing. She's a different business.
Uh, okay. That is a good lesson. Uh,

624
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,810
any other,

625
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,180
well, so then the, the other
lesson happens all the time,

626
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:48,270
which is knowing when I'm
wrong is a useful skill.

627
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:56,820
And lots of people who do good work have
trouble knowing when they haven't done

628
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:01,780
good work and they think
they should stick with it.

629
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:05,890
Other people have done good work. Don't
think they have and they pivot too soon.

630
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,550
So figuring that moment out,
1994,

631
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,460
I'm running one of the
first Internet companies.

632
00:41:12,461 --> 00:41:17,461
We invented commercial email and Mark
Hurst shows me this thing called the world

633
00:41:18,121 --> 00:41:21,460
wide web. And I say, that's stupid.

634
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:26,490
It's just like prodigy except it's
slower and there's nobody to pass money.

635
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:33,930
And for six months I persisted in pointing
out that the worldwide web make no

636
00:41:33,981 --> 00:41:34,850
sense whatsoever.

637
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:40,370
And I then one day just woke up and said,

638
00:41:40,371 --> 00:41:41,930
wait a minute,
let me look at that again.

639
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:46,880
And we completely changed how we decided
we were going to do our business.

640
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:47,750
Uh,

641
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:52,750
the same thing is true with the cover
of all marketers are liars because the

642
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:56,900
cover and the title was
super clever and wrong.

643
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:02,260
It was not a matter of me persisting in
persuading people that they needed to

644
00:42:03,051 --> 00:42:06,770
get the joke. It was merely a
matter of persuading the publisher.

645
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:11,240
We should make the paperback have a
different cover and a different title, uh,

646
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:15,620
that if you're going to try a lot of
things, you're going to fail a lot.

647
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,660
And figuring out the difference between
the failures of your judgment versus the

648
00:42:20,661 --> 00:42:24,560
failures of not persisting long
enough, uh, is a useful skill.

649
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:27,200
And I'm still not great at it,
but I'm better at it than I was.

650
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,730
You've interacted with, uh, many
more entrepreneurs than I have.

651
00:42:32,731 --> 00:42:33,600
I would say at this point,

652
00:42:33,601 --> 00:42:37,830
and one of the questions that I get
constantly that you might have a better

653
00:42:37,831 --> 00:42:40,800
answer for it because I don't have
a great answer for it right now, is

654
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,730
when do I know,

655
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:50,120
how do I discern between an idea that
I should keep persisting with despite

656
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,440
many, many, many,

657
00:42:52,441 --> 00:42:57,441
many rejections versus a bad idea that I
should abandon that is getting the same

658
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:03,120
type of rejection but that I'm equally
enthusiastic about [inaudible] that's a

659
00:43:03,121 --> 00:43:06,540
very wordy way to put it.
But I get some question.

660
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:09,150
I get some version of that
question all the time. How do you,

661
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,170
how would you answer that?

662
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:11,990
Well,
first we have to scroll back.

663
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:15,140
There's a difference between
freelancers and entrepreneurs.

664
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,030
Most people who are independent are
freelancers. They get paid when they work.

665
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:25,390
They do good work and get paid for a
few people are entrepreneurs building a

666
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:27,260
business bigger than themselves,

667
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:30,950
a business that makes them money when
they sleep a business where they don't

668
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:35,090
actually do the work that the customer
is buying and a business that they can

669
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:39,280
sell one day. So, uh, you
know, we, we look at, uh,

670
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:42,530
Larry Ellison,
Larry Ellison doesn't code at Oracle.

671
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:46,910
Larry Ellison doesn't make most of the
sales calls. What does Larry Ellison do?

672
00:43:46,911 --> 00:43:47,570
Actually,

673
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:52,250
his job is to think about something that
needs to be done and hire someone else

674
00:43:52,251 --> 00:43:55,970
to do it over and over again,
building something bigger than himself.

675
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,600
So the first thing I would say to
the person who's confused as well,

676
00:43:59,601 --> 00:44:03,470
are you an entrepreneur or a freelancer?
If you're an entrepreneur,

677
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:09,540
then you have signed up for a
series of choices and challenges.

678
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,370
And again, start with selling
something people want to buy.

679
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:20,580
There's no reason to try to invent a need
when there are so many needs and wants

680
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:25,270
that are unfilled,
right?

681
00:44:25,271 --> 00:44:29,770
So people didn't wake up 10 years
ago and say, I need an Uber.

682
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:33,330
But they did up 10 years ago and say,
I need an easy,

683
00:44:33,331 --> 00:44:36,510
inexpensive way to get from a to B.
Correct.

684
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,490
Once you could go to someone and say, I
have that. People would say I want that.

685
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:46,560
But if you're just saying, I'm really
clever, I know what you should want.

686
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,620
And when you tell people what it is,
they don't want it.

687
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:53,190
You're either talking to the wrong
people or you made the wrong thing.

688
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:54,960
So the blog post,

689
00:44:54,961 --> 00:44:59,961
I point people to the most is called
first 10 and it is a simple theory of

690
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:05,730
marketing that says, tell 10 people,
show 10 people, share it with 10 people,

691
00:45:05,731 --> 00:45:08,670
10 people who already trust
you and already like you.

692
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:14,120
If they don't tell anybody else it's
not that good and you should start over.

693
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:17,090
And if they do tell other
people you're on your way.

694
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:24,060
And for those people who hear your
description of entrepreneur and they say,

695
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:27,150
that's what I want, that is what I
want. I want it to be an entrepreneur.

696
00:45:27,151 --> 00:45:29,610
They currently have nine
to five job or maybe more,

697
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:33,750
maybe 80 to a hundred hours a week
management consultant job. Who knows,

698
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:38,290
uh, this is also a fan
question and they, they,

699
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:43,030
they desperately want to go from
wantrepreneur to entrepreneur. Uh,

700
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,240
the specific question was,

701
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:49,110
if I had a sticky note to put on my
computer to help me make that jump,

702
00:45:49,111 --> 00:45:52,920
what would it say? Do you have any
thoughts? And you can, you can,

703
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,590
you can rephrase the question if you'd
like or rip to shreds. Well, let's pick,

704
00:45:56,591 --> 00:45:57,350
pick

705
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:01,040
two different kinds of entrepreneurs.
One kind of entrepreneur. You say,

706
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,780
uh,
whose need am I satisfying today?

707
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:10,810
And can I assemble assets who I satisfy
it in a defensible way so I don't have

708
00:46:11,031 --> 00:46:15,710
to be the cheapest? And
by that I mean, uh, I,

709
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:19,340
and I've, I've written about
this snow shuffling, right?

710
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,350
We know that there's a
need for snow shuffling.

711
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,020
We know that if you spend time and effort,

712
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:28,220
you can arrange a team of
10 snow shovelers who don't
have the initiative you

713
00:46:28,221 --> 00:46:29,054
have.

714
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:33,900
And you can use existing
almost free technology to, uh,

715
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:36,500
assign the snow shovelers
to where they need to go.

716
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:40,550
And you're not going to win because
you're the cheapest snow shoveling company

717
00:46:40,551 --> 00:46:41,151
you're going to win.

718
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:45,530
Because you can get to customers
faster and better and more efficiently.

719
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:49,010
That's a very straightforward
form of entrepreneurship.

720
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:54,160
It is available to everyone without an
enormous amount of talent or artistic

721
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,540
creativity required because you just
make a list of the thousand things around

722
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:00,650
you that people need and want.

723
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:04,940
You make a list of the kinds of assets
and connections you can build and you go

724
00:47:04,941 --> 00:47:07,580
do it and you do it and you do it and
you do it until you're big enough.

725
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:13,450
The other kind to quote Michael Schrage
here is to say the purpose of my

726
00:47:14,241 --> 00:47:19,100
business is to change people, to change
them from something into something else.

727
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,140
And this is the kind of business
that we remember generations later.

728
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:29,330
So Harley Davidson, my favorite
example, changed. Disrespected,

729
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,920
disconnected outsiders into
respected family members,

730
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:39,880
insiders. That's what you get when
you pay $12,000 for a motorcycle.

731
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,550
Because if you, all you want is
transport bias, the Zucchini,

732
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:47,380
and the way to think about it
is no one gets a Suzuki Tattoo.

733
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,780
You can decide that you
want to be tattoo worthy,

734
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:57,520
that you want to change a population
in a way that makes you indispensable.

735
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:02,830
That kind of entrepreneurship
requires insight at a different level.

736
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:07,510
There's nothing, uh,
unattainable about it.

737
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,820
I encourage people to go do it,

738
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:13,870
but know that it is a higher stakes game.

739
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:19,260
Then being the person who apply systems
thinking to an existing clear need.

740
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:25,100
This is,
this is going to seem big posted by them

741
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:29,170
big posted or, or maybe, uh,

742
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:34,730
are there any check boxes that people
could use to determine if they should not

743
00:48:35,221 --> 00:48:39,480
become an entrepreneur or the,
because if you, if you look at the,

744
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:42,660
let's just say the narrative on
the covers of business magazines,

745
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:45,790
it seems like,
uh,

746
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:50,370
to the untrained eye perhaps of that
or the train die for that matter,

747
00:48:50,371 --> 00:48:53,910
that everyone is being encouraged to
become an entrepreneur and start their own

748
00:48:53,911 --> 00:48:55,380
company.
Um,

749
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:01,470
and I'm curious to hear if,
if you,

750
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:06,420
in what cases do you actively discourage
people from starting their own company?

751
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:10,450
The first thing I would say is the uh,

752
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:16,280
discerning reader of business magazines
differentiates between the articles were

753
00:49:16,281 --> 00:49:21,281
written for people who are voyeurs and
the articles that are written for you and

754
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:27,630
98% of the covers aren't written for you.
You should skip those.

755
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:30,690
You should skip the,
uh,

756
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:35,900
articles that lie and eyes people without
actually explaining anything about

757
00:49:36,781 --> 00:49:39,390
them other than they are
different than better than you.

758
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:45,450
Um, that said, uh, you know, we,

759
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,120
we've gotten this far without
talking about Steve Pressfield.

760
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:53,010
The resistance runs deep and the same
thing that causes writer's block is what

761
00:49:53,011 --> 00:49:54,870
Causes Entrepreneurial Block.

762
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,600
And just for people listening,
Steven Pressfield,

763
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:03,360
the war of art and among other
books, very, very worth reading,

764
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:07,240
right? The war of art is one of
those books, at least for me.

765
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:11,140
When I finally was exposed to it,
I said, why wasn't I informed?

766
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,860
Why did it take this long for
this book to land on my desk?

767
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,650
There aren't very many
books I could say like that.

768
00:50:17,651 --> 00:50:19,540
Most of my books don't
fall into that category.

769
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:23,410
You're a book stuff like there are
there in the world. You find our books.

770
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:27,980
Steve's book was hidden in some little
corner and I'm super glad I found it.

771
00:50:27,981 --> 00:50:31,010
I tracked him down. I published
the sequel called do the work. Um,

772
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:32,690
and now he's the publisher of that book.

773
00:50:32,691 --> 00:50:37,400
But reading the war of artists is
really essential, painful and essential.

774
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:41,600
Anyway. People get entrepreneurial
block for only one reason.

775
00:50:41,601 --> 00:50:43,730
It is not because they are not qualified.

776
00:50:43,731 --> 00:50:47,390
It is not because they are not passionate.
It is because they are afraid.

777
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:51,590
And you need to be clear with
yourself about what you are afraid of,

778
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,060
why you are afraid,

779
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,860
and whether you care enough to dance
with that fear because it will never go

780
00:50:57,861 --> 00:50:58,694
away.

781
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:01,790
Sounds a lot like,
uh,

782
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:06,210
I mean there's so many parallels of
course with the stoicism meditation,

783
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:06,421
you know,

784
00:51:06,421 --> 00:51:11,190
not trying to suffocate these so called
negative emotions because they're going

785
00:51:11,191 --> 00:51:12,510
to be constant companions.

786
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:16,950
So you have to learn how to navigate and
be friend them or at least accept them

787
00:51:16,951 --> 00:51:21,360
in a way. But if we look
at fear, uh, I remember,

788
00:51:21,361 --> 00:51:23,670
I think it was the four hour
body, I said that, uh, you know,

789
00:51:23,671 --> 00:51:26,280
the fears of modern man can
be boiled down to two things,

790
00:51:26,281 --> 00:51:27,720
getting fat and too much email.

791
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,610
If we look at email,
uh,

792
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:37,920
you are very well known for
responding extremely quickly to many,

793
00:51:37,921 --> 00:51:41,700
many people who pin you.
And this we can,

794
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:45,880
I can get more specific if it's helpful,
but how do you process email?

795
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:47,560
Right.

796
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:52,000
Let's also point out for those of you
who are considering sending me an email,

797
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:54,760
that according to the surgeon general,

798
00:51:55,270 --> 00:52:00,270
one out of every 300 people who send me
an email spontaneously burst into flame.

799
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:05,750
This is all you have to decide.
Is it worth the risk?

800
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:08,970
Okay. So, um,

801
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:14,850
it's the email thing is a real problem
for me and I don't have a way out and I'm

802
00:52:14,981 --> 00:52:18,460
not sure I want the way out because if
I wanted one I would probably find one.

803
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:22,030
I decided a very long time ago,
um,

804
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:27,330
as the author of permission marketing
a book about anticipated personal and

805
00:52:28,601 --> 00:52:30,880
relevant messages to
people want to get them,

806
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:35,230
that this medium was going to be a place
I was going to spend a lot of time in.

807
00:52:35,231 --> 00:52:40,210
And if someone cared enough to
send me a generous non anonymous,

808
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:44,590
uh, email, I could certainly try
to spend the time to write back.

809
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:48,640
And it worked for a really long time.

810
00:52:48,641 --> 00:52:50,530
And for someone with add like mine,

811
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,650
it's a thrill because every time you
look over on your computer there's

812
00:52:53,651 --> 00:52:58,540
something that looks like productive
work, just waiting to be done. But

813
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,900
at the end of the day,
if all you've done is answer email,

814
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:07,370
unless you work in help scout or
some tech support job, it's probable.

815
00:53:07,371 --> 00:53:09,860
You haven't created any
enormous amount of value.

816
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:15,820
And I need to work ever
harder at disciplining myself
to not live in my email

817
00:53:19,971 --> 00:53:24,200
box because I'm really good at it.
It makes people happy,

818
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:27,960
but it's not part of the
change I'm trying to make.

819
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,650
I don't want to say to people,
oh, you were the last one.

820
00:53:31,651 --> 00:53:33,660
The person after you
doesn't get a response.

821
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:38,130
I don't want to hire someone to answer
my email cause every word I have ever

822
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,890
written has been written by me.
Um,

823
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:45,690
and so I soldier on. But I say to
people like you who have a platform,

824
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:50,670
please ask people to do the world a
favor and write to Tim instead of,

825
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:58,810
well, I've been, uh, I've, I've
thrown myself to the wolves in a way,

826
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:03,040
uh, with, with email just because
I tend not to respond to many,

827
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:07,120
but it's in the,
in a world where many,

828
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:10,600
many folks in, it'd be curious to hear
how you handle this particular instance.

829
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:14,140
Make unsolicited introduction.
So people you know,

830
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:17,260
who should probably know better and
maybe you've only met them three or four

831
00:54:17,261 --> 00:54:20,650
times, but somehow they have your
email address, email you and say,

832
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:25,730
uh, Hi Seth, I'd love for
you to meet Doug So-and-so,

833
00:54:25,731 --> 00:54:30,731
CEO of such and such who's
Blahblahblahblahblah and he
wanted to connect because

834
00:54:31,151 --> 00:54:34,420
of this, this, and this. I'm
sure you guys will get along. Uh,

835
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,640
do you have a coping mechanism for,
for that if you experience it?

836
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,660
Wow. Okay. So this is a problem you
have created largely for yourself?

837
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:45,910
Like most of my problems,
I'm sure

838
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,530
I don't invest in any companies.

839
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:55,210
I don't take pitches for my
blog and I don't go to meetings.

840
00:54:56,170 --> 00:55:00,610
So it's easy for me to generously right
back to someone and say, I don't invest,

841
00:55:00,611 --> 00:55:03,280
I don't take pitches and I don't
go to meetings. How can I help you?

842
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:07,060
Because most of the time they
want one of those three things.

843
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,880
And so if they're being honest,
we're now done.

844
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:16,420
Uh, and if, if you get,

845
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,390
do you then therefore something like,

846
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,910
I mean Rick Rubin is very similar
in this way. The music producer.

847
00:55:21,911 --> 00:55:26,650
Do you have people always come to you
if you want to meet them or it is deemed

848
00:55:26,651 --> 00:55:29,620
worth your time or are
there exceptions and if so,

849
00:55:29,621 --> 00:55:31,300
how do you decide what makes the cut?

850
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:36,240
So going to La to have lunch
with Rick is on my list.

851
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:40,860
I haven't even begun to
schedule it because the
thought of flying somewhere not

852
00:55:40,861 --> 00:55:45,540
to do my speaking work is really
an Fmla. But one day, hi Rick,

853
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:46,740
I'm going to come have lunch with you.

854
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:52,050
One of the things that happens if you
live 40 minutes from the world's greatest

855
00:55:52,051 --> 00:55:57,051
city is that people in New York don't
want to make the last 40 minutes.

856
00:55:57,091 --> 00:56:01,890
So I end up, if I'm meeting
someone, but I don't go to meetings,

857
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:03,720
I usually ended up in New York City.

858
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:08,060
Got It. What other, what other
things do you categorically,

859
00:56:08,061 --> 00:56:10,700
and I'm not quite done with the email,
we're going to maybe come back to that,

860
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:14,450
but what other activities do
you categorically say no to

861
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,000
and so on?

862
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:19,780
It
tastes like soap to you is that is

863
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,260
well known.
The,

864
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:26,330
the gastropod podcasted an episode
about me and my Salon trow aversion.

865
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:33,310
All right, so no Cilantro. So
there, there a couple of cuisines.

866
00:56:33,311 --> 00:56:37,960
It'd be very challenging to navigate.
Uh, I mean a Vietnamese noodles,

867
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:39,460
very tough.
Uh,

868
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:44,490
but the part of the reason
I ask is that you see,

869
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:48,880
you have had just tremendous longevity
as a writer and as a thinker,

870
00:56:48,881 --> 00:56:49,714
as a speaker.

871
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:55,020
There are many people who have
one or two successful books get,

872
00:56:55,690 --> 00:57:00,190
gets inundated with various
opportunities, good, bad in between,

873
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,350
say yes,
become very scattered,

874
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:07,740
flameout become irrelevant somehow and
the wider world never hears from them or

875
00:57:09,011 --> 00:57:10,000
sees their gifts again.

876
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,320
And I think in part it's because as I
did with speaking engagements early on,

877
00:57:14,321 --> 00:57:18,520
I was so flattered that anyone would pay
me anything to speak and just amazed at

878
00:57:18,521 --> 00:57:19,061
these sums.

879
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:23,590
It seemed just insane at the time that
I said yes to everything and it made my

880
00:57:23,591 --> 00:57:26,920
life quite miserable. And people do that
with many, many different things. Right.

881
00:57:26,921 --> 00:57:27,550
The investing,

882
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:31,890
which is why I'm not taking any investing
meetings or investing in any startups

883
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:36,220
anymore at this point. Uh, I just
realized I had to say no to all of it.

884
00:57:36,221 --> 00:57:40,330
I couldn't say yes to just the top 1%
because that's still meant that I had to

885
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,900
filter the other 99%.

886
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:47,450
No. Yes, exactly. Why this is about
cognitive load and it's about,

887
00:57:47,650 --> 00:57:48,483
um,

888
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:53,680
the dip and it's about
seeking to be a crafts person.

889
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:57,710
So the reason I don't use
Twitter is I saw Twitter early,

890
00:57:57,711 --> 00:58:00,530
which is unusual for me, and I said, wow,

891
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,020
I could do this and have a lot of
followers. And then I said, well,

892
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:05,300
what would that mean?
A,

893
00:58:05,301 --> 00:58:10,301
it would mean less time spent writing
my blog be it would mean exposing myself

894
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:15,830
to anonymous comments from people
who want me to pay attention to them.

895
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,940
We'll either of those two things make me
better at the things I want to be good

896
00:58:19,941 --> 00:58:20,840
at.
No.

897
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:26,290
Will it be a thrill in the sense that
there'll be a little fearful edge to it

898
00:58:26,751 --> 00:58:28,430
every time I interact,
yes,

899
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:33,880
but I have conservation of fear and I
have to be really careful because if I'm

900
00:58:35,061 --> 00:58:37,010
busy sorting through more stuff,

901
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:41,750
the cognitive load goes up and I
can't do what Neil Gaiman does.

902
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:46,930
Like Neal famously has said that the
way he writes a book is he makes himself

903
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:49,580
extremely bored.

904
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:55,180
And if he's bored enough of book's
going to come out because it's it.

905
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:57,110
He needs to entertain himself.
Well,

906
00:58:57,111 --> 00:59:00,830
the problem with most people don't
understand about social media.

907
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:04,880
Social media wasn't
invented to make you better.

908
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:07,460
It was invented to make
the company's money.

909
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:12,530
And you are an employee of the company
and you are the product that they sell

910
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:16,130
and they have put you in a little hamster
wheel and they throw a little treats

911
00:59:16,131 --> 00:59:16,964
and now and then.

912
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:21,170
But you got to decide what's the
impact you're trying to make.

913
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:26,530
And this still comes back to the
fear thing and one of the biggest

914
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:31,541
misunderstandings of the people who are
into that whole quantified self thing is

915
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:39,460
they are confusing quantifying the
self with dancing with the fear.

916
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:45,290
And they're completely different
things to do in a given day.

917
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:49,490
That one is Taylorism.
It's scientific management,

918
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:54,110
it's productivity. It's we need to move
these widgets from one place to another.

919
00:59:54,111 --> 00:59:55,460
What's the most efficient way?

920
00:59:55,850 --> 01:00:00,850
And I'm glad we got good at industry
because it makes our lives way more rich,

921
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:04,250
right?
But our economy,

922
01:00:04,251 --> 01:00:08,150
our world and our soul
aren't fulfilled by that.

923
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:13,210
They're fulfilled by people who do
something that has never been done before.

924
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,050
And if it's never been done before,

925
01:00:15,051 --> 01:00:18,920
you can't quantify it because
it's never been done before.

926
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:23,060
And so to be good at it doesn't mean
you quantify your weight into it.

927
01:00:23,061 --> 01:00:25,820
To be good at it means
you're clear the decks.

928
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:31,270
So that all that's left
is you and the Muse,

929
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:37,040
you and the fear you and the change
you want to make in the world.

930
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:42,200
I can't think of something that's more
productive for the kind of people who are

931
01:00:42,201 --> 01:00:46,790
lucky enough and blessed enough to be
rich enough to be listening to this,

932
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:50,690
to focus their energy on.
We don't need folks like that to be,

933
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:54,650
to go from 90 words per minute to
105 words per minute when they type,

934
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:56,450
it's not a factor.

935
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:59,600
What we need is for them to type
something that's worth reading.

936
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:04,980
I'm so glad you brought up Neil Gaiman
and he's one of my favorite writers.

937
01:01:04,981 --> 01:01:09,090
Favorite people out there.
Someday I'll get him on the podcast.

938
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,730
It will happen eventually. Uh, but the,

939
01:01:11,731 --> 01:01:15,630
I guess it's make good art is that his
commencement speech of this is just such

940
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:19,770
an incredible message.
I needed that at a particular point.

941
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:23,310
It just happened to cross, you
know, come across the transom. Uh,

942
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:25,500
I encourage everybody to listen to.

943
01:01:25,501 --> 01:01:28,920
Do you think if you were coming off of,

944
01:01:28,921 --> 01:01:33,921
let's just say your first bestseller
and you were thrust into the limelight,

945
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:37,980
would you choose to,

946
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:42,540
would you choose again to do the blog and
to do it the way you're doing it or do

947
01:01:42,541 --> 01:01:44,280
you think you would
choose different tools?

948
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:45,660
Well,

949
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:49,170
the first thing I would say is everyone
should blog even if it's not under their

950
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,300
own name every single day.

951
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:56,850
If you are in public making
predictions and noticing things,

952
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:02,780
your life gets better because you will
find a discipline that can't help but

953
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:06,570
benefit you. If you want to
do it in a diary, that's fine,

954
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:09,990
but the problem with diaries
is because they're private.

955
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:14,490
You can start hiding in public in
this blog, there it is. Six weeks ago,

956
01:02:14,491 --> 01:02:16,200
you said this,
12 weeks ago you said that,

957
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:21,530
are you able every day to say thing
that's new that you're willing to stand

958
01:02:21,931 --> 01:02:25,080
behind? I think that's just
a huge, wonderful practice,

959
01:02:25,081 --> 01:02:26,610
but that wasn't your question.

960
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:32,240
Your question was trust and attention
because those are the two things that are

961
01:02:32,761 --> 01:02:36,840
scarce. In an economy where
things that used to be scarce,

962
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,370
not so much anymore,

963
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:44,060
and attention is as you have built your
arc around is scarce because we're not

964
01:02:46,411 --> 01:02:51,411
making any more of it and there are
ever more tools to interrupt evermore

965
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:52,763
people.

966
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:57,950
But interrupting people well is not
easy and it doesn't really scale.

967
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:02,370
So first thing we have
to do is earn attention.

968
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:07,170
And if we earn attention over time,
we gain trust.

969
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:11,580
So if someone says, Tim Ferriss is
coming to give a speech tomorrow,

970
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:15,090
the other person doesn't say,
tell me exactly what he's going to say.

971
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:19,620
And then I'll decide if I want to come.
They say, oh, Tim Ferriss, I trust him,

972
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:22,730
I'll come.
That's what we seek to build.

973
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:27,880
So the book industry is magical because
the book industry 500 Years of the book

974
01:03:28,161 --> 01:03:31,790
industry is someone at a publisher picked,

975
01:03:31,791 --> 01:03:34,070
you said to their readers,

976
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:38,150
I care enough about this idea that I'll
spend x number of dollars to bring it to

977
01:03:38,151 --> 01:03:40,100
you.
The bookstore said,

978
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:43,250
this is before there was
an infinite shelf space.

979
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,110
There are a lot of
books we could sell you,

980
01:03:45,111 --> 01:03:49,130
but we picked this one
because the publisher is so
excited and then when by the

981
01:03:49,131 --> 01:03:52,220
time the reader touches it,
it's a trustworthy object.

982
01:03:52,790 --> 01:03:55,190
Now that's being hacked and
hacked and hacked some more.

983
01:03:55,191 --> 01:03:58,520
You can buy your way into the New York
Times bestseller list for not much money.

984
01:03:58,521 --> 01:04:01,880
You can self publish a book that
looks like a real book. You can put,

985
01:04:01,881 --> 01:04:04,610
anyone can publish for the kindle,
therefore anyone does.

986
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:09,910
So we're stripping away the trust
building element of the book industry.

987
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:15,310
But if your book did work and people
encountered it and now they trust you,

988
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:18,650
then the job is to find
a social media platform.

989
01:04:18,651 --> 01:04:23,100
There isn't one right answer
where you can continue to connect.

990
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:27,830
People continue to tell stories and so
you earn more trust, more permission,

991
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:30,800
which gets you more attention,
which gets more trust,

992
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:33,620
which lets you make the change
you want to make in the universe.

993
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:38,180
What opportunities were you offered?

994
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:41,220
Doesn't have to be specific that
you're glad you turned down. Are there,

995
01:04:41,221 --> 01:04:45,150
are there any, are there any particular
examples that come to mind? And if not,

996
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:46,770
I can,
I can move on.

997
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:50,790
But I'm just curious if there are any
opportunities that you've turned down for

998
01:04:50,791 --> 01:04:51,421
me.
For instance,

999
01:04:51,421 --> 01:04:56,421
one of them would be like every
reality TV show invite I've ever had.

1000
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,350
I'm thrilled. And I was singing, I
was extremely tempted early on. Uh,

1001
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:06,540
but in retrospect, extremely happy.
I said no to all of that. Uh,

1002
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:11,580
yes, that's, these does a great
point. TV runs deep in our culture,

1003
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:16,060
so they wanted me to be on that super
famous one and then that other one.

1004
01:05:16,061 --> 01:05:19,360
And I never hesitated in saying no,

1005
01:05:19,361 --> 01:05:24,100
because that's the moment when you
decide who you want to be. Right.

1006
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:28,840
And so I paid extra careful attention
to the question and after careful

1007
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:31,480
attention to my answer,
and it resonated.

1008
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:36,370
I would say the biggest
shift, uh, which is, uh,

1009
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:42,240
for Silicon Valley people hard to get
your arms around because there's a game

1010
01:05:42,761 --> 01:05:43,541
being played there.

1011
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:48,250
And it's just a game I've opted out
of is when I was at Yahoo during the

1012
01:05:48,251 --> 01:05:52,930
renaissance in 1999. Uh, uh, Bill Gross,

1013
01:05:52,931 --> 01:05:54,250
who's a super nice guy,

1014
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:58,990
came to me and asked me to be a
head of marketing for the company.

1015
01:05:58,991 --> 01:06:02,290
He was building a,
it had Steven Spielberg on the board.

1016
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:04,880
It was teed up to be,
you know,

1017
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:09,900
the seventh next IPO and there were $1
billion in stock options on the table.

1018
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:16,060
And I said to myself,
well, if I say yes to this,

1019
01:06:16,061 --> 01:06:18,250
I've decided what I do
for the rest of my life,

1020
01:06:18,251 --> 01:06:23,110
which is say yes to the next one because
I don't need to say yes to anise to buy

1021
01:06:23,111 --> 01:06:27,310
Cilantro and vodka.
Why would I say yes?

1022
01:06:27,311 --> 01:06:30,430
It's because I liked the
game and I didn't say yes.

1023
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:34,030
And even though the billion dollars
in stock options never came around,

1024
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:36,700
I think I'd be even more
proud of it if they had,

1025
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:40,420
because the money is a story.

1026
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:44,680
Once you have enough for beans and rice
and taking care of your family and a few

1027
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:45,251
other things,

1028
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:50,251
money is a story and you can tell yourself
any story you want about money and

1029
01:06:51,251 --> 01:06:56,251
it's better to tell yourself a story about
money then you can happily live with.

1030
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:59,950
Could you, could you elaborate
on that a little bit? What is,

1031
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:03,340
what is your story about money?
Is that what you just said? Uh,

1032
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,590
because this is a really important point.

1033
01:07:05,591 --> 01:07:10,480
It's something I've been trying to
mull over and in the last year or so in

1034
01:07:10,481 --> 01:07:15,250
particular, well let me start with the
marketing story about money, which is,

1035
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:17,650
uh,
take uh,

1036
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,690
a $10 bill and go to the bus station
and walk up to someone and say,

1037
01:07:22,691 --> 01:07:27,340
I'll sell you this $10 bill for a
dollar and you should actually do this.

1038
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:31,440
Uh, no one will buy it from you. And,

1039
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,550
and there are a few reasons for this.

1040
01:07:33,551 --> 01:07:36,640
The first reason is no one goes to the
bus station hoping to do a financial

1041
01:07:36,641 --> 01:07:37,474
transaction.

1042
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:42,810
The second one is only an insane person
would try to sell you a real $10 bill

1043
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:47,320
for a dollar.
And dealing with insane people is tricky.

1044
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:51,460
So it must not be a real $10 bill.
You should just walk away.

1045
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:53,740
Now let's try a different thing.

1046
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,910
Put a $10 bill in your neighbor's
mailbox when he's not home and runaway.

1047
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:02,620
Do it the next day.
Do it the third day on the fourth day.

1048
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:05,560
Ring your neighbor's
tent a doorbell and say,

1049
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:09,550
I'm the guy who left three
$10 bills in your mailbox.

1050
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,190
Here is another one.
You want to buy it for a dollar,

1051
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:16,250
you'll sell it because
your knows you're crazy,

1052
01:08:16,251 --> 01:08:21,230
but you're crazy in a very particular
way and you've earned the trust that it's

1053
01:08:21,231 --> 01:08:22,550
a real $10 bill,
right?

1054
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:28,120
So we assume that $10
bills are worth $10 but no,

1055
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:31,760
it's a, it's a mutual belief.
And if the belief isn't present,

1056
01:08:31,761 --> 01:08:32,594
they're worth nothing.

1057
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:37,130
Now we get to our internal
narrative about money.

1058
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:41,180
Is money that number,
it's not even pieces of paper anymore.

1059
01:08:41,181 --> 01:08:45,890
It's a number on a screen. Is that a
reflection of your worth as a human?

1060
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:46,820
Right.

1061
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:50,150
One of the things that Derek said on
your podcast that I sort of disagree with

1062
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:55,100
is that being rich is a signal,

1063
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:59,660
a symbol that you've created a lot
of value for a lot of people. Uh,

1064
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:02,480
I think lots of times
that's actually not true.

1065
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:08,030
And there are lots of ways to create
value for people and most of them do not

1066
01:09:08,031 --> 01:09:08,864
involve money.

1067
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:13,670
So what we have to decide once we're okay,

1068
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:18,930
once we're not living on $3 a day, once
we have a roof, once we have healthcare,

1069
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:23,450
is we have to decide how much more money
and what am I going to trade for it

1070
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:26,330
because we always trade something for it.

1071
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:30,350
Unless we're fortunate enough that the
very thing we want to do is the thing

1072
01:09:30,351 --> 01:09:32,750
that also gives us our maximum income.

1073
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:38,440
And I don't think that merely because
some blog decides that people with big

1074
01:09:39,531 --> 01:09:43,670
valuations are doing better. That
doesn't mean you should listen to them.

1075
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:49,950
So when you think of the word,
if you even think of this word,

1076
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:51,900
but when you hear the word successful,

1077
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:54,990
who's the first person who
comes to mind for you and why?

1078
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:59,020
MMM.
You know,

1079
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:04,290
my parents were successful because of
how many people they mattered to. Uh,

1080
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:07,540
my friend Jacqueline Novogratz,
who I think should win the Nobel prize,

1081
01:10:07,541 --> 01:10:10,870
who runs the Acumen Fund
is insanely successful.

1082
01:10:10,871 --> 01:10:15,871
She is changing whole continents of the
earth by bringing an idea to the fore

1083
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:22,250
and doing it relentlessly for
year after year after year. Um,

1084
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,780
and then I think about, you know, uh,

1085
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:29,850
people in my neighborhood
who are successful because
they get to shovel their

1086
01:10:30,041 --> 01:10:33,190
neighbor's walk whose elderly
and it's snowed last night.

1087
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:38,560
And that privilege and that trust,
that's some live a successful life.

1088
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:45,500
Is there anything you've changed your
mind about in the last few years?

1089
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:51,340
Other than the web being dumb, other
than the web being dumb? Yeah, there are,

1090
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:55,480
there are, there are bunch of
things. Um, you know, I have, uh,

1091
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:59,870
changed my mind in each direction
about the book industry,

1092
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:02,750
about it not mattering
that about it mattering.

1093
01:11:02,751 --> 01:11:07,080
And now at about it being in
a sad but slow decline. Uh,

1094
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:12,100
I've changed my mind about
the big companies in the,

1095
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,820
of our Internet.

1096
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:20,210
I think that they changed around the
same time I changed my mind maybe before

1097
01:11:21,241 --> 01:11:22,190
that.
Uh,

1098
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:26,790
they went from being
really profoundly useful,

1099
01:11:26,791 --> 01:11:31,791
important public goods that created
enormous value to being public companies

1100
01:11:33,451 --> 01:11:38,451
where there's so much pressure
on management by everyone
who works there to make

1101
01:11:39,421 --> 01:11:40,500
the stock price go up,

1102
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:45,920
that they don't often make decisions
in the public good and a more,

1103
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,900
and I was probably naive to think
that they would keep doing it,

1104
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,340
but they are stopping.

1105
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:52,980
Uh,

1106
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:57,980
what is something that you believe that
other people think is crazy or insane?

1107
01:11:58,321 --> 01:12:02,070
And this is a bastardization of Peter
Teal question that he's as an interview

1108
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,000
sometimes, but, um, I think,

1109
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:10,470
I think that deep down I am certain
that people are plastic in the positive

1110
01:12:10,721 --> 01:12:14,010
sense, flexible and able to grow. Uh,

1111
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:19,040
I think almost everything is made not
born and that makes people uncomfortable

1112
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,600
because it puts them on the hook.
But I truly believe it.

1113
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:30,050
What is the book or the books that
you've given most as a gift or as gifts

1114
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:34,470
besides your own,
if you've given your own?

1115
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:37,970
Well, I want to talk about my own
because, yeah. Well let you know,

1116
01:12:37,971 --> 01:12:39,110
definitely we can talk to your spouse.

1117
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,910
You're talking about your
movie if you're an actor,

1118
01:12:40,911 --> 01:12:45,140
but you're not supposed to talk about
your book. If you're an author. I wrote,

1119
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:47,930
I wrote your turn so I could give it away.

1120
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:52,130
And so I spoke at a high
school two weeks ago.

1121
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:55,100
I gave every student to copy
a month before I got there.

1122
01:12:55,640 --> 01:13:00,640
And there are very few books that are
written to be given away in the sense

1123
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:02,210
that,
uh,

1124
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:07,240
most books are purchased by the person
in 10 done reading them and you write a

1125
01:13:07,851 --> 01:13:11,900
book differently if you think
it's going to be given away. Um,

1126
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:17,120
but I've also given away many copies of
Cory Doctorow is books if you're into

1127
01:13:17,121 --> 01:13:18,650
three d printing and stuff makers,

1128
01:13:18,651 --> 01:13:23,000
if you're into a security
and privacy little brother,

1129
01:13:23,390 --> 01:13:23,720
uh,

1130
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:28,720
I've given away tons of copies of
the right kind of science fiction.

1131
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:32,690
Uh, let me distinguish
between a couple of kinds.

1132
01:13:32,691 --> 01:13:37,580
The movies have ruined science fiction
because they have created this sort of

1133
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:40,750
violent Dystopian,
uh,

1134
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:47,080
we all ought to become survivalists,
Zombie fueled science fiction.

1135
01:13:47,081 --> 01:13:49,990
That isn't what science fiction was for.
Uh,

1136
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:54,130
the other kind of science fiction is
the science fiction that fundamentally

1137
01:13:54,131 --> 01:13:58,540
rewires your brain.
And this is one reason why,

1138
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:02,920
uh, live tweeting a speech
is it makes no sense.

1139
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:07,480
And why taking tons of notes on
certain kinds of books make no sense.

1140
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:11,980
Because as a Scott McCloud
pointed in his brilliant book,

1141
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,140
understanding comics,
which I have given away many,

1142
01:14:14,141 --> 01:14:19,141
many copies of all the action in comics
happens in between the panels that

1143
01:14:20,351 --> 01:14:23,350
that's why comics are an art form.
Because in panel a,

1144
01:14:23,351 --> 01:14:25,270
something happened in panel B,
something happened,

1145
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:28,630
but it's what happened between a and B.
The changed your mind about anything,

1146
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,400
the actions in your head.
Well,

1147
01:14:30,401 --> 01:14:33,160
the same thing is true in a
great science fiction book.

1148
01:14:33,161 --> 01:14:36,410
If you read snow crash c for
sure. Good Book. Such a good book.

1149
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,400
It's such a good book, but you can't
give it to someone. Now I've tried,

1150
01:14:39,401 --> 01:14:43,750
it doesn't work. You have to read it
before you've been on the Internet. Uh,

1151
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:46,750
and then then it changes your mind.
Right?

1152
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:51,900
Or if you read diamond age before you've
thought about molecular anything or

1153
01:14:52,751 --> 01:14:55,920
three d printing, then it changes
your mind. You know, he, he,

1154
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,990
he wrote that book before the Ipad,
before the kindle.

1155
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:04,050
It's just that shift is now I tell you
this shift and now the book doesn't work

1156
01:15:06,161 --> 01:15:08,200
the way it would have if I
hadn't told you that the shift,

1157
01:15:08,201 --> 01:15:11,110
cause it's when it shifts in your head.
So if you,

1158
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:16,380
if you read Dune and you don't read
it for the plot but you read it for

1159
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:19,870
understanding geopolitics,

1160
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:22,150
suddenly something clicks in your head.

1161
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:24,820
If you read pattern
recognition by William Gibson,

1162
01:15:24,821 --> 01:15:25,780
you don't even have to finish it.

1163
01:15:25,781 --> 01:15:30,550
Just read the first five chapters and
suddenly you will now understand what a

1164
01:15:30,551 --> 01:15:32,770
brand is.
And it's just,

1165
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:37,720
those are the kinds of books that I
give away a lot separate from the books

1166
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,570
in audio that I give away,

1167
01:15:40,571 --> 01:15:44,770
which I had been saving for you to ask
me about because audio is my focus for

1168
01:15:44,771 --> 01:15:45,430
today.

1169
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:47,800
Oh, let's get into it. No, I mean I, I've,

1170
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:53,070
I'm a by virtue of doing this podcast
and a also becoming involved with audio

1171
01:15:54,371 --> 01:15:57,890
books. I'm all about audio
right now, so please just, I'll,

1172
01:15:57,891 --> 01:16:00,010
I'll let you take them up.
Here we go.

1173
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:01,340
So what we explained,

1174
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:06,110
I explained was certain kinds of books
work cause they cause something to flip

1175
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:08,270
in your head.
They cannot be digested.

1176
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,880
They set you up and they
take it to the next step.

1177
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:16,660
Audio is different because you can listen
to it again and again and again and

1178
01:16:17,511 --> 01:16:21,410
you listen to it when you don't think you
are paying attention and it's working.

1179
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:27,370
And when I make a list of books
that have profoundly influenced me,

1180
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:32,120
they tend to be books that I have listened
to. Well, in the case of the first one,

1181
01:16:32,121 --> 01:16:37,121
I'll start with so many times
that I wore out 72 cassettes.

1182
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:41,720
They could not be played anymore.
And I had to buy another $500 set.

1183
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:46,190
That's when I didn't have
$500 to spend on 72 cassettes.

1184
01:16:46,191 --> 01:16:47,300
And that Zig Ziglar,

1185
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:52,970
zig is your grandfather
and my grandfather, he's
Tony Robbins grandfather.

1186
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:57,530
None of us would be here if
it weren't for zig. And uh,

1187
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:01,760
some of his politics and some of his
outlook on life are extremely dated.

1188
01:17:01,761 --> 01:17:02,870
And I disagreed with them.

1189
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:08,320
But the fundamental principles of goal
setting and motivation and the fear

1190
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:11,750
people have of saying yes
when you sell to them.

1191
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:17,500
Those were the three sections
of the stuff just kept me going.

1192
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:21,560
And again and again and again.

1193
01:17:21,561 --> 01:17:24,410
And I told him the one time
we worked together, I said,

1194
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:28,670
anytime you need me to stand in for you,
I, you can even do it with the accent

1195
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:32,870
because that's how many times I listened.
So that's the first one.

1196
01:17:32,871 --> 01:17:37,730
Is there a particular name to the series
or is there just one audio set by zig?

1197
01:17:38,110 --> 01:17:42,220
Well now there's, so there's one series,
I guess it's a collection, right? Right.

1198
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:44,390
Three series,
one series on goal setting.

1199
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:49,460
One series called how to stay motivated
and one series called secrets of closing

1200
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:52,280
the sale. Yeah. On secrets
of closing the sale.

1201
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:57,580
Zig tells a 17 minute story about a
guy in St Louis shining his shoes.

1202
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:05,330
So just if you just listen to one story,
if you're into selling,

1203
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,400
you're just listening to that story.

1204
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:12,380
10 Times can listen once 10 times you'll
become a different kind of salesperson.

1205
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:17,330
And if you, if you listen to this
story about his friend in Canada,

1206
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:21,710
you will understand what motivation is.

1207
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:26,740
If you listen to him talking about how
we rewire our brains with goal setting.

1208
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:30,950
I mean you, Tim, I've
talked about it so much,

1209
01:18:30,951 --> 01:18:35,951
but it's a really fascinating
glimpse at 1960 and I encourage it.

1210
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,720
Number two, almost the flip side, uh,

1211
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:45,320
the recorded works of Pema
Chodron, c h. O, d r. O. N.

1212
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:49,460
And I'm guessing you've talked about
her in the past. She has come up. Yeah.

1213
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:54,350
She is a Buddhist nun who has
a monastery in Nova Scotia.

1214
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:57,960
And, uh, Pema, uh,

1215
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:00,680
we'll also get under your skin
in a totally different way.

1216
01:19:00,681 --> 01:19:04,960
She is a disciple of Chung Trump.
RMP Shea, who was the first, uh,

1217
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:08,390
full Buddhist monk in the u s uh,

1218
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:13,420
the way to understand his teaching
is in one tiny little parable,

1219
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:17,570
which is this,
we are falling,

1220
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:21,650
falling with nothing to hold on
to and nothing to slow us down.

1221
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:26,180
The good news is there
is no ground to land on.

1222
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:33,710
So those are two then, uh, inspired by
the two of them and some work I did,

1223
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,650
I did it something for
charity called leap first.

1224
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:41,330
That's a short audio book that captures
some of the things I was trying to teach

1225
01:19:41,331 --> 01:19:45,320
people, uh, about this. And you
can get that at sounds true.

1226
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,710
I have four more,
uh,

1227
01:19:47,810 --> 01:19:52,810
working our way from the
nonfiction to more lyrical,

1228
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:54,680
uh,
the art of possibility,

1229
01:19:54,770 --> 01:19:59,240
which is very hard to find on audio
and is totally worth seeking out.

1230
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:04,430
It's by Roz Zander and her
husband Ben Friends of mine. Uh,

1231
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:09,460
Ben is the a symphony conductor in Boston
and Roz is a social worker and the two

1232
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:16,560
of them will completely change the
way you think about possibility,

1233
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:19,980
about enrollment, about
leadership. And again,

1234
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:23,550
I listened to it probably
once a month in the car.

1235
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:26,460
Just put it on in the middle.
It doesn't matter where you start.

1236
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:30,660
The next one is the war of art.
Also hard to find that audio.

1237
01:20:30,690 --> 01:20:35,460
I find Steve's voice to be fascinating.
And um,

1238
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,720
even before I knew him, I was fascinated
by listening to him speak his own work,

1239
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:43,110
uh, to left, uh, just kids,

1240
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:48,150
which is the single best audio
book ever recorded by Patti Smith.

1241
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:52,500
It is not going to change
the way you do business,

1242
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:54,510
but it might change the way you live.

1243
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,600
It's about love and loss and art.

1244
01:20:58,050 --> 01:21:02,590
It's about non confidence and confidence.
Uh,

1245
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:06,030
and it's mostly about having
a best friend. It's magic.

1246
01:21:06,990 --> 01:21:11,730
And I can just hear her quoting Robert.
Patty.

1247
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:17,090
So curt and then the last one I'm going
to tell you outta left field is a book

1248
01:21:17,671 --> 01:21:20,950
called debt by David Graber.
Uh,

1249
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:26,090
I recommended an audio because David
is sometimes repetitive and a little

1250
01:21:26,671 --> 01:21:30,570
elliptical, but in audio it's all okay
because you can just listen to it again.

1251
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:35,490
Debt is a,
David was on tenure track at Yale.

1252
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:40,470
Then he cofounded the occupy movement and
sort of looks like they threw him out.

1253
01:21:40,810 --> 01:21:41,310
Um,

1254
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:46,310
he's an anthropologist and he studies
lots of things in our ancient history.

1255
01:21:47,130 --> 01:21:52,130
His theory about where did
money come from is mind blowing.

1256
01:21:53,190 --> 01:21:56,230
And I'll give you the short
version, which is, uh,

1257
01:21:56,580 --> 01:22:01,580
every economics textbook and he quotes
seven of them teaches that people got

1258
01:22:02,401 --> 01:22:04,950
tired of carrying around a
goat to trade for a sheep.

1259
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:08,490
And it's hard to cut it up to trade
for some butter and some bread.

1260
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:11,850
So with all that trading in the little
village square that looks something like

1261
01:22:11,851 --> 01:22:15,900
Salem, Massachusetts, one day someone
said, let's have money instead.

1262
01:22:15,901 --> 01:22:17,040
And everyone was happy.

1263
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:22,170
It turns out there's no evidence
that this ever happened once,

1264
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:27,030
anywhere in the universe
never,

1265
01:22:27,031 --> 01:22:28,380
never stops the writing though.

1266
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:33,600
And instead he argues very
persuasively that, um,

1267
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:39,040
money was invented to keep track of debt.
And that debt predates money.

1268
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:44,560
And this is a book about simple
debt and then the debt that leads to

1269
01:22:44,561 --> 01:22:48,040
prostitution and then the debt that
leads to marriage debt and then the debt

1270
01:22:48,041 --> 01:22:53,041
that leads to developing nations being
billions of dollars in debt to the rich

1271
01:22:53,531 --> 01:22:57,370
world merely because a
dictator stolen a lot of money.

1272
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:03,050
And I found it completely rewired the
way I thought our world actually worked.

1273
01:23:06,970 --> 01:23:11,440
Uh, I'm not ready to go stand on the
battle lines of the next occupy movement,

1274
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:16,740
but I really have far more color and
insight now as to what money is and how it

1275
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,940
changed everything because
it's all about debt.

1276
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:28,020
Which of these going from Zig to Pema
and onward down to debt with David,

1277
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:30,190
which of these do you
think I should start with?

1278
01:23:30,510 --> 01:23:34,060
Or which one would you
suggest I start with? Well,

1279
01:23:34,061 --> 01:23:39,061
I think it's important to realize that
audio books are a practice that real

1280
01:23:40,271 --> 01:23:45,160
books are not. You can, uh, read
real books the way you and I do,

1281
01:23:45,161 --> 01:23:49,580
which is read a chapter and then decide
if chapter two has earned it or not. Um,

1282
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:52,390
but I find that like dieting,

1283
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:56,470
you're not going to get any benefit
if you just start and see how it goes.

1284
01:23:56,920 --> 01:24:00,580
So for me,
if you're feeling stuck,

1285
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:04,090
it's all about the war of art
and the art of possibility.

1286
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:08,350
If you are feeling stressed,
it's about Pema.

1287
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:13,860
If you need to see a path that is more
colored than the one you're already on,

1288
01:24:14,741 --> 01:24:17,830
which is pretty technicolor,
then it zig.

1289
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:21,070
And if you just want to cry a little,
it's just kids.

1290
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:24,640
And then debt is the one that's
as closest to reading a book.

1291
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:28,030
I don't think many people
should listen to debt 10 times.

1292
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:34,810
And uh, this is not exactly debt,
but just on a, on a money theme,

1293
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:35,920
uh,

1294
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:40,920
can you think of any $100 or less purchase
that has heavily impacted your life

1295
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:47,020
in the last six months or recent memory?
So,

1296
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:49,390
you know,
once the Stereo is working,

1297
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:55,080
it doesn't make sense to buy more stereo
equipment because that's just silly and

1298
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:57,620
you can do better than that.
Um,

1299
01:24:58,570 --> 01:25:01,560
but where you could do is
become obsessed with our teas.

1300
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:06,300
Anol bean to bar chocolate. Okay. I'm,

1301
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:09,550
I'm saying one could not that one should,
but one could.

1302
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:13,450
So I did and I worked my
way up the ladder, uh,

1303
01:25:13,451 --> 01:25:18,451
about a year ago I was about to start my
own chocolate company because it's not

1304
01:25:18,461 --> 01:25:19,900
that hard.
Um,

1305
01:25:20,230 --> 01:25:25,230
and then I bumped into a few brands that
were doing it better than I ever could.

1306
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:30,940
And so there is a company in
western Massachusetts called
rogue chocolate, r, O, g,

1307
01:25:30,941 --> 01:25:35,780
u e, and you can only buy
their stuff preorder by mail,

1308
01:25:36,790 --> 01:25:38,200
12 bucks for a chocolate bar.

1309
01:25:38,201 --> 01:25:42,430
And I'd pay 20 happily because
a party happens in your mouth.

1310
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:47,140
That's like a whole new ball game.
So every day there's,

1311
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:51,340
I have a huge pile of
artisinal chocolates here,

1312
01:25:51,341 --> 01:25:53,770
only dark chocolate please.
And um,

1313
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:58,330
I'm actually an advisor to a new
acumen company called Krakow hunters in

1314
01:25:58,331 --> 01:26:02,830
Colombia. But there are two chocolate
companies I want to highlight rogue,

1315
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:07,860
which mentioned and ask a nosy rogue
because I don't believe it's possible to

1316
01:26:08,241 --> 01:26:11,540
make better chocolate than they are.
I think Satan works with them.

1317
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:17,830
And the second one Aszkenazy because
Shawn who used to be a lawyer is living a

1318
01:26:18,951 --> 01:26:23,000
life that is worth noting
and possibly emulating.

1319
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:28,030
He not only buys his beans from farmers
in the Philippines and other countries

1320
01:26:29,331 --> 01:26:30,530
who he meets,

1321
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:35,160
but he puts their
children to school and uh,

1322
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:40,270
he has built a practice of
creating a worthwhile luxury.

1323
01:26:40,641 --> 01:26:45,050
Good.
That directly benefits people.

1324
01:26:45,051 --> 01:26:50,000
Not sort of, not a little but directly.
Nice. How'd you spell ask? A nosy.

1325
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:53,780
I want to write Ashkenazi, but
that's not the same thing. Right?

1326
01:26:54,110 --> 01:26:55,720
That's what I say in my head every time.

1327
01:26:56,060 --> 01:27:01,060
It's a S.

1328
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:02,010
K. I. N. O. S. I. E.

1329
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:05,000
I don't do the marketing for them
cause if I did it probably would have a

1330
01:27:05,001 --> 01:27:08,840
different name. I'm
just saying. So anyway,

1331
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,650
this chocolate habit is finally the vice
I had been looking for my whole life.

1332
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:17,660
I can, I can tell the difference
between a one continent, another.

1333
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:21,230
I can tell how long they conked it for.

1334
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:25,010
I can talk about [inaudible] Compton.
I don't know what that means.

1335
01:27:25,011 --> 01:27:29,600
I know what I've like a cock, this,
the, this a marine mammal on mammal.

1336
01:27:29,601 --> 01:27:33,690
I'm Moelis is, but so what is conk?
Okay, what does her hands chuck?

1337
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:34,880
Here's how you make chocolate.

1338
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:40,120
Cocoa Pod is like a nerf football and
you throw them on a net for a while and

1339
01:27:42,891 --> 01:27:46,910
they ferment and then your crack them
open and you're driving in the sun and

1340
01:27:46,911 --> 01:27:50,960
inside each one or something about
three times the size of a coffee bean,

1341
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:54,410
the shell, uh, you can't eat.

1342
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:57,770
That means that there's
about to be a lot of labor.

1343
01:27:57,771 --> 01:27:59,660
But before you can take the shell off,

1344
01:27:59,661 --> 01:28:02,750
you roast them and then
after they're roasted,

1345
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:05,780
you have to one by one take the shell off.

1346
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:10,070
And that's really hard. And people have
made these really cool machines to do it,

1347
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:12,650
but it's still hard.
Then you're left with nibs.

1348
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:16,430
These nibs are unsweetened
and but if you eat one,

1349
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:18,260
they taste a little like dark chocolate,

1350
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:23,720
then you take it and you put it in this
machine that grinds them and grinds them

1351
01:28:23,721 --> 01:28:26,510
and grinds them.
And as they are being ground Davey,

1352
01:28:26,511 --> 01:28:31,040
lease a little bit in the oil and the
liquor and it became smoother and smoother

1353
01:28:31,041 --> 01:28:33,200
and smoother. Interesting. Side note,

1354
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:38,180
it turns out that the machine that
you can use to do this at home is also

1355
01:28:38,181 --> 01:28:40,940
capable of making Italy out of rice,

1356
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:44,360
which are those delectable
little Indian Kreps.

1357
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:49,790
So a guy from India who loves chocolate
figure this out and he imports Italy

1358
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:54,791
makers puts a new sticker on them and
sells them as sharklet conking machines.

1359
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:58,340
So you put,
it's to granite stones,

1360
01:28:58,590 --> 01:29:02,610
the they're in there and you
can do it for up to six hours.

1361
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:07,470
And what happens is soon after
40 50 hours in the machine,

1362
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:12,920
it's at a micron size that your tongue
can no longer tell when you make it even

1363
01:29:13,411 --> 01:29:17,070
smaller,
you then take that liquid,

1364
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:21,120
you'll put it if you're adding
sugar in a tempering machine.

1365
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:26,420
Tempering is another really cool device
that causes all of the molecules in the

1366
01:29:27,511 --> 01:29:32,511
chocolate to line up in a
certain direction by taking
the chocolate to a cool

1367
01:29:33,391 --> 01:29:37,770
but not too cool temperatures. So it's
still liquid, not too hot, not too cold.

1368
01:29:37,771 --> 01:29:40,590
And by spinning it around,
all the molecules line up.

1369
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:45,060
And that is why chocolate
bars snap when you break them.

1370
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:49,440
And why they don't turn gray in the air.
If you don't temper it,

1371
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:51,210
you don't get either of those effects.

1372
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:57,400
It's like a, it's like an MRI
machine for Coachella molecules. Uh,

1373
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,230
that, you know, I did some,

1374
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:04,360
I actually did a little bit of tempering
back in the day making truffles ages

1375
01:30:04,571 --> 01:30:07,450
ago and Saratoga,
Saratoga. It was a blast.

1376
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:11,730
I recommend everybody take
a take a chocolate making
class if you can. So this,

1377
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:14,810
this is great. Rogue chocolate.
And where's Rowe chocolate based?

1378
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,200
Just because there's more than one.
The one that you're referring to.

1379
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:18,613
Hold on.

1380
01:30:19,670 --> 01:30:23,690
I just ate up all of my last batch
so I can't look at the label,

1381
01:30:23,691 --> 01:30:27,050
but I can tell you that
they are in three rivers,

1382
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:31,740
Massachusetts. Three rivers
mess. Okay. And, uh, on,

1383
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:36,420
on the, uh, subject of eating, what
do your eating habits look like?

1384
01:30:36,421 --> 01:30:41,370
What does your diet look like? Yeah,
it's really not good. It's not good.

1385
01:30:42,010 --> 01:30:43,750
Not good cause I'm bored by it.

1386
01:30:43,751 --> 01:30:46,180
But people are fascinated when we
go out to dinner because there's so,

1387
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:51,100
I don't eat wheat. I don't eat dairy. I
don't eat Cilantro. I don't eat meat. Um,

1388
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:56,550
because each time I sort of
adjust what I eat, I feel better.

1389
01:30:56,970 --> 01:31:01,970
And so I feel like I am in a happy
place where I can make fascinating,

1390
01:31:02,311 --> 01:31:06,990
interesting food and mostly eat happily
in restaurants without being obsessive

1391
01:31:06,991 --> 01:31:07,824
about it.

1392
01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:12,620
What is the first say, two hours of
your day look like? And what is Breck,

1393
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:14,800
what is your,
what does a typical breakfast?

1394
01:31:15,610 --> 01:31:20,060
Uh, breakfast is one more decision I
don't make. So it's a frozen banana,

1395
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:22,460
hemp powder,
almond milk.

1396
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:26,410
I dried plum and some walnuts in,
uh,

1397
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:30,620
the blender. And, um,

1398
01:31:31,190 --> 01:31:36,190
then I make coffee for whoever comes
over that morning and for my lovely wife,

1399
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:37,490
uh,

1400
01:31:37,490 --> 01:31:42,490
meanwhile I've probably done an hour and
a half of stuff online before seven 30.

1401
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:49,940
Um, so then I know the world didn't break
when I was asleep and then I can get to

1402
01:31:49,941 --> 01:31:50,774
work.

1403
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:54,060
What is the half hour of triage,

1404
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:57,000
Internet triage or computer
triage look like? What do you,

1405
01:31:57,001 --> 01:31:59,830
what types of things are
you doing in that half hour?

1406
01:32:00,170 --> 01:32:04,400
Well, the most important thing is, uh,
did the blog work because if it didn't,

1407
01:32:04,401 --> 01:32:08,720
I have to take evasive action.
But I love the guys at typepad.

1408
01:32:08,810 --> 01:32:13,810
It's the best 29 bucks a month I spend
because it doesn't crash and it works.

1409
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:18,980
Um,
and then I tried to clear the email box.

1410
01:32:19,670 --> 01:32:23,690
Uh, I live, I've lived
in inbox zero since, uh,

1411
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:28,260
before it was coined and um,

1412
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:29,990
now my brain is free.

1413
01:32:30,530 --> 01:32:35,530
And so then I try not to be an email
hound until I've done actual productive

1414
01:32:35,871 --> 01:32:40,790
work. And then I come to the apartment
where I work and other people join me here

1415
01:32:40,791 --> 01:32:45,680
sometimes. And we work on the Alt
Mba, which is a school I am building.

1416
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:49,820
And um,
that's what I do for work.

1417
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:55,160
And, uh, when was the last time
you worked at home if you ever did?

1418
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,240
Well, if there's a laptop
or I'm not unconscious,

1419
01:33:00,270 --> 01:33:04,200
I'm at work in the sense that what
I do for a living is notice things.

1420
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:07,360
Right, right. I guess the
reason I ask is I've, I've,

1421
01:33:07,390 --> 01:33:12,390
I've long considered getting an office
as opposed to operating out of coffee

1422
01:33:12,821 --> 01:33:16,350
shops and miscellaneous locations.
Uh,

1423
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:20,140
and that is the,
the context behind the,

1424
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:24,310
yeah, it's, I do much better in this room.

1425
01:33:24,790 --> 01:33:28,660
This room is, I couldn't recreate
this room for $10 million.

1426
01:33:28,690 --> 01:33:32,530
It's got so much Patina,
it's got Patina on the Patina.

1427
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:38,220
And that sets a bar for me about the
fact that I don't want to compromise just

1428
01:33:39,731 --> 01:33:43,300
to do the next thing. Because I look at
the last thing or the thing before that.

1429
01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:47,950
And I said, damn, I'm proud of that. Don't
do something you're not proud of. So,

1430
01:33:47,951 --> 01:33:52,240
you know, the alt Mba w I
wouldn't be running. It's still,

1431
01:33:52,241 --> 01:33:56,230
if it wasn't the single most important
educational thing I've ever done,

1432
01:33:56,500 --> 01:34:00,760
and that's what I keep trying to do is
the next thing's gotta be worthy of it or

1433
01:34:00,761 --> 01:34:02,230
else I might as well just take a break.

1434
01:34:02,690 --> 01:34:03,740
Could you elaborate?

1435
01:34:03,741 --> 01:34:07,970
Because a lot of the questions from my
fans on Twitter and Facebook were related

1436
01:34:07,971 --> 01:34:12,220
to education and they, they
generally came in the form of, uh,

1437
01:34:12,950 --> 01:34:14,780
in a number of themes. One was, you know,

1438
01:34:14,781 --> 01:34:19,400
could you have him elaborate on his
education manifesto on the other was,

1439
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:22,070
hey,
I have a kid who's in fourth grade.

1440
01:34:22,071 --> 01:34:24,860
I have a kid who's just
going to be entering school.

1441
01:34:25,130 --> 01:34:27,320
What would Seth do in my shoes?
Um,

1442
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:30,590
and you don't have to tackle
those right off the bat,

1443
01:34:30,650 --> 01:34:33,860
but as that is context,
could you,

1444
01:34:33,861 --> 01:34:36,500
could you tell us more
about what you're up to?

1445
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:40,830
All right, so this is a rant
and is not about what I'm up to.

1446
01:34:40,831 --> 01:34:43,530
It's about what I was up
to and the rant is this,

1447
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:48,770
sooner or later parents have to take
responsibility for putting their kids into

1448
01:34:48,781 --> 01:34:53,730
a system that is indebting them
and teaching them to be cogs in a,

1449
01:34:54,570 --> 01:34:57,210
in a economy that doesn't
want cogs anymore.

1450
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:00,920
And parents get to decide,
uh,

1451
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:04,070
I'm a huge fan of public school,
send my kids to public school.

1452
01:35:04,071 --> 01:35:07,760
I think everyone should go
to public school cause it's
a great mix master of our

1453
01:35:07,761 --> 01:35:11,900
world.
But from three o'clock to 10 o'clock,

1454
01:35:11,901 --> 01:35:15,020
those kids are getting homeschooled and
they're either getting homeschooled and

1455
01:35:15,021 --> 01:35:18,830
watching the Flintstones or are they
getting homeschooled in learning something

1456
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:23,330
useful. And I think we need
to teach kids two things.

1457
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:28,400
One, how to lead and to how
to solve interesting problems.

1458
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:32,300
Because the fact is there are plenty
of countries on earth where there are

1459
01:35:32,301 --> 01:35:37,280
people who are willing to be obedient
and work harder for less money than us.

1460
01:35:38,030 --> 01:35:41,000
So we cannot out
obedience the competition.

1461
01:35:41,930 --> 01:35:46,930
Therefore we have to out lead
or out solve the other people.

1462
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:49,250
I don't care what country they live in,

1463
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:53,750
Wyoming or across the world who want that.
Whatever is scarce.

1464
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:58,370
The way you teach your kids to solve
interesting problems is to give them

1465
01:35:58,371 --> 01:36:02,000
interesting problems to solve and then

1466
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:08,610
don't criticize them when they
fail because kids aren't stupid.

1467
01:36:08,820 --> 01:36:11,850
If they get in trouble every time they
tried to solve an interesting problem,

1468
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:16,530
they'll just go back to getting an a by
memorizing what's in the textbook that

1469
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:20,910
it's so important here. And I spend
an enormous amount of time with kids.

1470
01:36:21,330 --> 01:36:24,810
Uh, I produced the wizard of
Oz, the musical in fourth grade.

1471
01:36:24,990 --> 01:36:27,130
I used to help run a summer camp.
Uh,

1472
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:32,200
I think that it's a privilege
to be able to look a trusting,

1473
01:36:33,210 --> 01:36:34,770
energetic,
smart,

1474
01:36:34,771 --> 01:36:39,390
11 year old in the eye and tell him the
truth and what we can say to that 11

1475
01:36:39,391 --> 01:36:40,224
year old is,

1476
01:36:40,770 --> 01:36:45,660
I really don't care how you
did on your vocabulary test.

1477
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:50,660
I care about whether you have something
to say and we can teach our kids from a

1478
01:36:51,211 --> 01:36:56,211
young age to be the kind of people we
want them to be and anything that's worth

1479
01:36:58,141 --> 01:36:59,850
memorizing is worth looking up now.

1480
01:37:00,330 --> 01:37:04,260
So we don't need to have them spend a
lot of time getting good grades so they

1481
01:37:04,261 --> 01:37:09,010
can go into a famous college because
famous colleges don't work anymore.

1482
01:37:09,370 --> 01:37:12,490
Famous college isn't the point anymore.
The point is,

1483
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:18,340
is there an entity that will have trouble
living without you when you seek to

1484
01:37:18,341 --> 01:37:21,010
earn a living? Because if there is,
you'll be able to make a living.

1485
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:22,121
If on the other hand,

1486
01:37:22,121 --> 01:37:25,150
you're waiting in the placement
office for someone to pick you,

1487
01:37:25,450 --> 01:37:27,520
you will be persistently undervalued.

1488
01:37:29,340 --> 01:37:33,330
You talked earlier about
writing daily as a practice,

1489
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:35,490
listening to the audio
books as a practice.

1490
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:40,520
Are there any practices that you would
suggest to the kind of overwhelmed,

1491
01:37:41,310 --> 01:37:44,760
busy parent who wants to start to be
more proactive in this department?

1492
01:37:44,761 --> 01:37:48,210
They have an 11 year old. Are there
any practices or exercises that they,

1493
01:37:48,211 --> 01:37:49,080
that you would suggest?

1494
01:37:51,110 --> 01:37:51,351
Well,

1495
01:37:51,351 --> 01:37:56,190
you know super well that busy
is a trap and the is a myth.

1496
01:37:56,760 --> 01:38:00,630
So what could possibly be
more important than your kid?

1497
01:38:00,631 --> 01:38:02,160
Please don't play the busy card.

1498
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:08,250
If you spend two hours a day without an
electronic device looking your kid in

1499
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:14,750
the eye, talking to them and
solving interesting problems,

1500
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:18,590
you will raise a different kid
than someone who doesn't do that.

1501
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:24,760
And that's one of the reasons why I
cook dinner every night because what a

1502
01:38:26,211 --> 01:38:31,211
wonderful semi distracted environment
for the kid to tell you the truth for you

1503
01:38:32,271 --> 01:38:33,440
to have low stakes,

1504
01:38:33,441 --> 01:38:37,550
but super important conversations
with someone who's important to you.

1505
01:38:38,030 --> 01:38:41,120
Right? That this idea, get home from work,

1506
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:44,370
put on your sneakers and go
for a walk with your kid.

1507
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,940
You know my friend Brian walks
his daughter to school every day.

1508
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:52,120
That's priceless. Well, how
can you be too busy to do that?

1509
01:38:53,050 --> 01:38:54,880
And the work you're doing now.

1510
01:38:55,840 --> 01:39:00,430
So I did a couple of courses for
skillshare. They worked really well.

1511
01:39:00,431 --> 01:39:04,360
They were very highly rated and
they had an 80% dropout rate,

1512
01:39:04,930 --> 01:39:08,530
which is way better than anybody else
because other online courses that have a

1513
01:39:08,531 --> 01:39:12,280
97% dropout rate than I did,
of course for you to me.

1514
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:14,920
And the same thing
happened and I'm thinking,

1515
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:18,820
I loved making these courses and you know,
there I am on screen,

1516
01:39:18,821 --> 01:39:19,870
it sounds like me.

1517
01:39:20,410 --> 01:39:24,220
But why are people dropping out
of my courses and everyone else's?

1518
01:39:24,850 --> 01:39:28,540
And the reason is because when it gets
hard and there's no social pressure,

1519
01:39:28,570 --> 01:39:29,403
you leave.

1520
01:39:30,250 --> 01:39:34,300
So what I said was how do I make
the opposite of an online course?

1521
01:39:34,930 --> 01:39:39,160
And that meant instead of a million
people a hundred it meant instead of being

1522
01:39:39,161 --> 01:39:42,130
free, it's expensive. Instead
of letting everyone in,

1523
01:39:42,131 --> 01:39:45,340
you have to apply instead of being easy.
It's hard.

1524
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:47,020
And instead of being on your own,

1525
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:52,000
it's a group thing where there are
coaches watching you all the time.

1526
01:39:52,390 --> 01:39:55,720
And instead of lectures,
it's 100% projects.

1527
01:39:56,530 --> 01:39:57,970
So I built it to see what would happen.

1528
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:01,990
And so the Alt Mba is for
people at big companies.

1529
01:40:01,991 --> 01:40:05,830
We've got people from whole foods and
Microsoft and it's for people that tiny

1530
01:40:05,831 --> 01:40:08,470
companies,
and it's not for everybody,

1531
01:40:08,530 --> 01:40:12,110
but we get this cohort of people and uh,

1532
01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:17,110
there's a coach for every 10. We put
them in slack, we put them in wordpress,

1533
01:40:17,380 --> 01:40:20,680
we give him 14 assignments
over a 28 day period of time.

1534
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:25,030
And we sprint as fast as we can.
And it's unbelievable.

1535
01:40:25,510 --> 01:40:29,290
Tim, I just gotta tell you
it's an unbelievable, cause
I'm not actively involved.

1536
01:40:29,291 --> 01:40:34,291
I just watch and because eventually the
goal is to have more of these sessions.

1537
01:40:34,481 --> 01:40:39,481
I can't be in them if they have more of
them and people change because we don't

1538
01:40:40,091 --> 01:40:41,140
give them any other choice.

1539
01:40:42,690 --> 01:40:45,720
Could you, could you expand
on the social pressure piece?

1540
01:40:45,721 --> 01:40:50,280
I think this is such an important
point and I was asked recently,

1541
01:40:50,281 --> 01:40:52,320
I get asked all the time,
maybe you get asked this too,

1542
01:40:52,321 --> 01:40:56,920
but like how do you maintain
the discipline or how do
you change this habit?

1543
01:40:56,921 --> 01:40:59,530
How do you do this?
And my answer is almost always the sound.

1544
01:40:59,531 --> 01:41:04,360
Like you have to have a punishment or a
reward for following or not following it

1545
01:41:04,361 --> 01:41:07,300
for doing it or not
doing it. And it's, it's,

1546
01:41:07,301 --> 01:41:11,140
it's just incredible to see how people
who have never been able to lose weight

1547
01:41:11,141 --> 01:41:11,471
before,

1548
01:41:11,471 --> 01:41:14,760
as soon as they have $100 of their own
money on the line and it's a betting pool,

1549
01:41:14,790 --> 01:41:17,500
five other people who will be
able to heckle them at the office,

1550
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:21,900
all of a sudden they figure it out really
quickly in the how to isn't as hard.

1551
01:41:21,910 --> 01:41:25,840
But uh, in, in, in this
particular example,

1552
01:41:25,841 --> 01:41:29,860
could you expand on the, uh, the social
aspect because I think it's really,

1553
01:41:30,130 --> 01:41:33,400
really important and transfers and
applies to a lot of other areas.

1554
01:41:34,940 --> 01:41:39,940
There are some people in some areas who
have this self discipline necessary to

1555
01:41:42,661 --> 01:41:46,500
get the work done that needs to get
done. You know, those people and I need,

1556
01:41:46,530 --> 01:41:49,830
I know those people and
when we find one of them,

1557
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:51,690
it's fabulous.

1558
01:41:51,691 --> 01:41:56,691
Like I think I am like that with certain
parts of my craft in that no one would

1559
01:41:57,271 --> 01:42:00,810
notice if I didn't do it the way I do it.
I just choose to do it.

1560
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,540
When it comes to education though,

1561
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:08,960
all of us have 12 to 20
years of brainwashing going
on with which is epitomized

1562
01:42:09,811 --> 01:42:13,050
by one sentence.
I hate with a passion,

1563
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:15,750
which is will this be on the test?

1564
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:23,030
Right? So as soon as you say
will this beyond the test,

1565
01:42:23,060 --> 01:42:26,780
you've instantly defined
why you are doing something.

1566
01:42:27,410 --> 01:42:32,410
And then when we invite you to an
online course for free on artificial

1567
01:42:33,441 --> 01:42:35,540
intelligence in which
there is no certificate,

1568
01:42:35,810 --> 01:42:40,250
which there is no accreditation and
you get to problem number four and it's

1569
01:42:40,251 --> 01:42:44,570
really hard and you ask yourself,
will this be on the test?

1570
01:42:45,110 --> 01:42:48,920
And then you realize there is no test
and no one even knows you're taking the

1571
01:42:48,921 --> 01:42:53,210
course. Then you stop and you go eat
some m and m's and you turn on the TV.

1572
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:58,860
And so the goal here was,
um,

1573
01:42:59,310 --> 01:43:01,980
if you need,
if you benefit,

1574
01:43:01,981 --> 01:43:06,981
if you thrive from being in an environment
where you will push yourself to get

1575
01:43:07,921 --> 01:43:11,670
what you wanted all along,
I'll give you people who will push you,

1576
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:15,390
your fellow students and your
coaches and there won't be a test.

1577
01:43:15,391 --> 01:43:17,400
And there won't be great.
It's this is better than that.

1578
01:43:17,670 --> 01:43:22,670
This is teaching you to internalize
the narrative of my mom's not here,

1579
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:27,660
my mom's not watching,
but I should act like she was,

1580
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:32,070
who do you in, in, in your life,

1581
01:43:32,071 --> 01:43:37,071
who helps tell you you're wrong or point
out when your work isn't good or uh,

1582
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:43,080
otherwise, you know, talk
to the emperor so to speak,

1583
01:43:43,081 --> 01:43:45,390
because you've had so much success.
There's,

1584
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:48,450
there's always the risk that people will
tell you what you want to hear or just

1585
01:43:48,451 --> 01:43:53,000
give you, uh, give you praise in,

1586
01:43:53,001 --> 01:43:54,500
in all circumstances.

1587
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:59,810
Who Do you lean on for the,
the truth,

1588
01:43:59,870 --> 01:44:02,480
when you,
when you need bitter truth sometimes.

1589
01:44:03,430 --> 01:44:03,731
Okay.

1590
01:44:03,731 --> 01:44:08,731
So I would break this
into two kinds of people.

1591
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:14,580
I have been blessed by being surrounded
by very skeptical people and,

1592
01:44:16,030 --> 01:44:20,170
um, you know, people who
turned to me and 1991 and said,

1593
01:44:20,530 --> 01:44:24,550
this internet thing's never going to
amount to anything or an English teacher

1594
01:44:24,551 --> 01:44:28,270
who wrote in my yearbook, uh,
you are the bane of my existence.

1595
01:44:29,590 --> 01:44:31,570
You will never write
anything worth reading.

1596
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:33,830
Well, hold on, let me just
pause there for a second.

1597
01:44:33,950 --> 01:44:36,830
What did you do to this guy or the woman?

1598
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:41,960
I dedicated one of my books to her.
Did you send it to her?

1599
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:44,280
Yes, I did. How did, how did she take

1600
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:48,860
that? She was, she was, she had a tongue
in cheek. How long? She was fine. Um,

1601
01:44:49,630 --> 01:44:53,110
but so that they're sort of uninformed.

1602
01:44:53,111 --> 01:44:55,150
Skepticism is easy,

1603
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:58,660
at least for me to find partly
cause I don't live in San Francisco,

1604
01:45:00,530 --> 01:45:02,810
not fully in the echo chamber,
drinking the Koolaid.

1605
01:45:03,250 --> 01:45:07,420
Um, but the other kind
is so rare, so scarce,

1606
01:45:07,421 --> 01:45:11,650
so precious. I only get little
dribs of it now. And then,

1607
01:45:12,130 --> 01:45:14,620
which is someone who gets you,

1608
01:45:14,950 --> 01:45:17,920
someone who can see right
through to your soul,

1609
01:45:18,220 --> 01:45:22,120
who with generosity and care can
look you in the eye, hand you back,

1610
01:45:22,121 --> 01:45:25,300
something that you say, I think this
would be better if you did it again.

1611
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:29,620
And um, I had a business partner, Steve,

1612
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:34,920
who was like that in
1979 and 81 80 and 81.

1613
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:43,080
And finding that again in a consistent
way is really precious and really hard.

1614
01:45:47,780 --> 01:45:49,990
Yeah. That is difficult. Um,

1615
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:55,600
what advice would you give your 30 year
old self and if you could place us for

1616
01:45:56,631 --> 01:45:58,220
you, like where you
are, what you're doing.

1617
01:45:59,330 --> 01:46:03,140
Um, I'm going to cheat because I've
been asked this question before.

1618
01:46:04,010 --> 01:46:08,240
Cheating's allowed. So first, do you know
about the science fiction book replay?

1619
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:14,240
Uh, no, I don't really hunt. Brilliant
game changer replay. All right.

1620
01:46:14,390 --> 01:46:16,790
Is, uh, I will tell you it's a,

1621
01:46:16,850 --> 01:46:19,970
it's the best time travel
book ever written anyway.

1622
01:46:21,290 --> 01:46:25,070
I had so many bumps starting
when I was 30 years old.

1623
01:46:25,430 --> 01:46:30,430
They lasted for nine years and I wouldn't
tell my 30 year old self anything

1624
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:37,490
because if I hadn't had those bumps I
wouldn't be me. And I'm glad I'm me.

1625
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:41,390
What was the, if you're
comfortable telling us, I mean,

1626
01:46:41,391 --> 01:46:44,990
what was the hardest or one of the
hardest bumps in that period of time?

1627
01:46:46,850 --> 01:46:48,480
Um,
you know,

1628
01:46:48,481 --> 01:46:52,500
I was trying to shift my dream of
what I wanted to do for a living.

1629
01:46:52,530 --> 01:46:57,150
I was growing up, I was
failing at business. Uh,

1630
01:46:57,151 --> 01:47:00,810
I had some quiet,
relentless,

1631
01:47:01,050 --> 01:47:03,420
repeated failures of no,

1632
01:47:03,690 --> 01:47:08,690
I had failures of sloppiness
where if I knew what I knew now,

1633
01:47:10,171 --> 01:47:13,230
I wouldn't have done something and they
would have saved me a year of my life.

1634
01:47:13,620 --> 01:47:14,190
Um,

1635
01:47:14,190 --> 01:47:19,190
there were failures of how big does
something need to be and all sorts of

1636
01:47:21,390 --> 01:47:25,230
visible scarring that,
um,

1637
01:47:25,860 --> 01:47:26,693
was hard.

1638
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:31,440
But it was part of the deal when you have

1639
01:47:32,330 --> 01:47:35,800
a protracted difficult
period of time like that is,

1640
01:47:35,860 --> 01:47:40,860
is there any particular activity or
technique or self talk that you use to try

1641
01:47:42,801 --> 01:47:43,850
to get back on your feet

1642
01:47:44,770 --> 01:47:45,603
more quickly?

1643
01:47:46,030 --> 01:47:51,030
While now I'm so much better at it because
of Pema and because of meditation and

1644
01:47:51,251 --> 01:47:52,760
because of,
um,

1645
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:57,960
knowing how to sit with it and not
insist that the tension go away.

1646
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:02,720
The other thing that's important here,
uh,

1647
01:48:02,830 --> 01:48:06,130
as long as we're getting personal
is I had to make a decision, uh,

1648
01:48:06,190 --> 01:48:11,190
after I sold my company about whether I
wanted to continue facing professional

1649
01:48:11,981 --> 01:48:15,730
existential crises because

1650
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:21,490
Yoyodyne and the projects before that
we're right on the edge for a really long

1651
01:48:21,491 --> 01:48:26,020
time. One more mistake. You're out
of the game. And I like the game.

1652
01:48:26,290 --> 01:48:27,580
I didn't want to be out of the gate.

1653
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:32,080
There's a thrill to dancing
with existential crises.

1654
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:36,070
And I know plenty of people who
have been lucky, like I was,

1655
01:48:36,250 --> 01:48:39,460
who got right back in.
So they get more existential crises.

1656
01:48:40,300 --> 01:48:43,960
And I made the decision that I liked
the game too much to bet all the chips.

1657
01:48:44,140 --> 01:48:44,973
So I never do

1658
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:51,530
meaning that it could, could you
rephrase that? Yeah, I'm well,

1659
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:54,730
I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Sure.

1660
01:48:54,990 --> 01:48:59,640
So if I understand what you mean about
the existential crises 100% because I

1661
01:48:59,641 --> 01:49:03,620
know so many people who just, they're
addicted to that roller coaster. Uh,

1662
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:07,440
but when you said not betting all
the chips, right, so let's say I took

1663
01:49:07,970 --> 01:49:12,970
100% of the trust I have in my brand and
put it behind something really daring

1664
01:49:14,481 --> 01:49:19,460
and huge, that might not work. And
so if at the end it doesn't work,

1665
01:49:19,461 --> 01:49:22,860
and now no one ever trusts me again,
uh,

1666
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:25,610
that's an existential crisis that's going
to get you out of bed in the morning,

1667
01:49:25,611 --> 01:49:29,930
isn't it? Um, I don't
want to do that. Right.

1668
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:34,250
I don't want to violate the trust
I've earned with people or risk risk,

1669
01:49:34,251 --> 01:49:36,710
violating that trust risk,
violating that trust.

1670
01:49:37,070 --> 01:49:42,070
So that keeps me from doing certain
things that people with resources could

1671
01:49:42,771 --> 01:49:46,520
choose to do.
But I don't want to play that game.

1672
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:48,400
What is your meditation

1673
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:49,270
practice look like?

1674
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:53,350
It's sloppy. It works. It's
nothing worth writing home about.

1675
01:49:53,870 --> 01:49:58,610
That's okay. Maybe it's worth mentioning
briefly. I just, even if sloppy, I,

1676
01:49:58,670 --> 01:50:02,890
I, I mean, I, and look in, in
full disclosure when people, I've,

1677
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:05,710
journalists asked me, you know, can I,
but we want to follow you for a day.

1678
01:50:05,890 --> 01:50:09,830
And I'm like, no, you don't. You
really don't. It, it's going.

1679
01:50:10,630 --> 01:50:14,380
It'll be like watching a adaptation
with nic cage and was like,

1680
01:50:14,620 --> 01:50:18,120
it's going to be so boring
for you. Uh, but what,

1681
01:50:18,121 --> 01:50:19,960
what does the sloppy
meditative practice look like?

1682
01:50:20,410 --> 01:50:25,410
My friend Susan Piver runs the largest
online meditation center in the world,

1683
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:29,090
and so every once in a while
I dropped in on her thing. Uh,

1684
01:50:29,091 --> 01:50:34,091
I go to the Shambala Center on Sundays
in New York sometimes and sit for half an

1685
01:50:34,330 --> 01:50:39,000
hour. But usually, uh, I'm pretty
good at getting into this data.

1686
01:50:39,001 --> 01:50:40,270
I need to pretty quickly.

1687
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:43,330
So I'll just sit and I'll
close my eyes and I'll breathe.

1688
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:46,570
And when I've had enough of that,
I'll go back to what I was doing.

1689
01:50:46,910 --> 01:50:50,090
Do you have a set time for that? Do you
tend to do it in the morning? So, no,

1690
01:50:50,250 --> 01:50:53,370
I don't quantify that stuff.
I quantify almost nothing in my life,

1691
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:59,060
which I'm okay with the, not that you
care, but the work should care. But the,

1692
01:50:59,470 --> 01:51:03,380
the, is there a state that triggers
you to sit down and meditate?

1693
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:08,680
Well, yeah. If the narrative is getting
in the way of what's actually happening,

1694
01:51:09,310 --> 01:51:14,310
you need to make it so that the narrative
gently backs off and it's really hard

1695
01:51:17,290 --> 01:51:20,920
to yell at the narrative and make it back
off right away because that just makes

1696
01:51:20,921 --> 01:51:21,940
the narrative louder.

1697
01:51:23,020 --> 01:51:28,020
So instead I will undermine it by making
it surrounded by nothing until it sort

1698
01:51:30,671 --> 01:51:31,504
of melts away.

1699
01:51:32,750 --> 01:51:37,430
I took a, uh, an acting club,
my first ever acting class.
I have no plans to act. Uh,

1700
01:51:37,490 --> 01:51:40,730
with this, uh, incredible
guy named Josh Paice,

1701
01:51:41,170 --> 01:51:46,010
very successful actor classes
called committed impulse. And when,

1702
01:51:46,910 --> 01:51:50,780
when people's mind mind's wandered,
we were instructed to say, you know,

1703
01:51:50,781 --> 01:51:55,040
I'm back and there were a
bunch of exercises intended
to make us fully present

1704
01:51:55,041 --> 01:51:57,830
to our bottle,
a bodily sensations and whatnot.

1705
01:51:57,831 --> 01:52:02,810
And it struck me how applicable all
of that was to exactly what you're

1706
01:52:02,811 --> 01:52:03,381
describing,

1707
01:52:03,381 --> 01:52:08,360
which is not trying to fight
the riptide of this narrative,

1708
01:52:08,690 --> 01:52:10,640
but to just be acutely aware of it.

1709
01:52:10,730 --> 01:52:13,130
And I never really thought
of it as meditation,

1710
01:52:13,131 --> 01:52:15,620
but I started doing this thing and
I don't know how I started doing it,

1711
01:52:15,621 --> 01:52:17,540
but just a three breath break,

1712
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:20,390
like literally just cause I
was always told I count to 10,

1713
01:52:20,391 --> 01:52:23,210
do 10 breaths and for whatever he says,
too impatient for that. I was like,

1714
01:52:23,211 --> 01:52:27,560
all right, it's just three breaths.
And uh, it found it incredibly,

1715
01:52:27,561 --> 01:52:32,561
incredibly helpful as someone who has
some extremely self defeating narratives,

1716
01:52:32,811 --> 01:52:35,210
attend to surface all the time.
Uh,

1717
01:52:35,930 --> 01:52:40,850
if you could have one billboard anywhere
with anything on it, what would it say?

1718
01:52:42,450 --> 01:52:46,040
Uh, Jay Levenson, another old
friend who passed away recently.

1719
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:51,340
I look guerrilla marketing and he liked
to say the best billboard in history

1720
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:54,350
said, free coffee. Next exit

1721
01:52:57,180 --> 01:53:00,360
free coffee. Next exit. Uh,

1722
01:53:02,430 --> 01:53:04,590
have you given commencement speeches?
Seth,

1723
01:53:04,970 --> 01:53:07,370
I have been asked.
Let's go over this.

1724
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:11,060
A whole bunch of people who
don't want to hear from you

1725
01:53:13,230 --> 01:53:15,000
waiting for you to be done.

1726
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:20,820
I suppose that's one way to look at it.

1727
01:53:22,590 --> 01:53:25,720
So that's the reason why you have
not done commencement speeches.

1728
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,060
Ding, Ding, Ding. Let's,
all right, so let's say,

1729
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:34,900
uh, with, with your class,
right, with, with uh,

1730
01:53:34,970 --> 01:53:38,480
with your MBA you have, you are giving
the commencement speech to them.

1731
01:53:38,481 --> 01:53:40,400
They're motivated.
They do want to hear from you.

1732
01:53:40,420 --> 01:53:44,930
They're not waiting to get shit faced
two hours later, or maybe they are,

1733
01:53:44,931 --> 01:53:49,730
but not all of them. Uh, what would, what
would you, what would you say to them?

1734
01:53:50,350 --> 01:53:53,140
Well, I would like to believe
that one out of every three days,

1735
01:53:53,230 --> 01:53:55,840
my blog is a commencement speech,
right?

1736
01:53:55,841 --> 01:53:58,330
When it's not talking about
technology or marketing,

1737
01:53:59,050 --> 01:54:01,750
I'm talking about respect
and talking about choice.

1738
01:54:01,751 --> 01:54:06,700
I'm talking about the impact we can make.
And you know the,

1739
01:54:06,730 --> 01:54:11,520
the problem with commencement speeches
is the only ones we hear are the ones

1740
01:54:11,521 --> 01:54:14,670
that were transcribed and
written for people like us,

1741
01:54:14,671 --> 01:54:17,080
not for actual graduate.
Right.

1742
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:22,260
Because what we really want to say to
actual graduate is just a reminder of what

1743
01:54:22,261 --> 01:54:25,770
they should have heard at
least three times a day and
every one of their classes.

1744
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:30,540
And that is you are more
powerful than you think you are.

1745
01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:32,730
Act accordingly.

1746
01:54:34,790 --> 01:54:38,750
I like that. Just if, just a few
more questions. This has been,

1747
01:54:38,850 --> 01:54:41,160
you're doing great. It feels like
we've only been talking for 50.

1748
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:43,150
Oh yeah, no, this is super fun.

1749
01:54:43,180 --> 01:54:47,980
I just love every opportunity that,
that I have to chat with you.

1750
01:54:48,340 --> 01:54:49,270
Just a few more.

1751
01:54:50,050 --> 01:54:53,560
Do you have any ask or
request for my audience?

1752
01:54:53,561 --> 01:54:55,510
And the next question is just going
to be where people can find you.

1753
01:54:55,511 --> 01:54:57,700
So this is effectively the last question,

1754
01:54:57,701 --> 01:55:02,701
but do you have any ask or request for
my audience suggestion for the people

1755
01:55:03,130 --> 01:55:05,920
listening? Anything at all? You'd
just like to transmit to them.

1756
01:55:07,010 --> 01:55:09,520
Uh,
send someone a thank you note tomorrow.

1757
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:15,270
Do you have any particular way that
you like to send thank you notes?

1758
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:19,360
No, that's, I'm, I'm giving
people a lots of freedom here.

1759
01:55:21,430 --> 01:55:26,200
Well freedom. I think that's a great place
to actually wrap up. I think your work,

1760
01:55:26,230 --> 01:55:30,880
you're thinking, uh, the,
the daily contact that people
can have with your blog,

1761
01:55:30,910 --> 01:55:33,190
even if they get some type of anx by,
by,

1762
01:55:33,220 --> 01:55:37,600
by skipping one or two a week instead
of sending you an angry note, uh, is,

1763
01:55:37,601 --> 01:55:39,620
is really significant. So, uh,

1764
01:55:39,730 --> 01:55:42,910
I would just want to thank you for putting
it all out into the world and I think

1765
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:47,850
are able to create greater freedom for
themselves and the people they care about

1766
01:55:47,851 --> 01:55:51,450
as a result of it. So I'd say it's
a meaningful thing that you do.

1767
01:55:52,140 --> 01:55:56,820
And where can people were,
where can people find you online?

1768
01:55:56,850 --> 01:55:59,820
The basics, where would you like them
to learn more about what you're up to?

1769
01:55:59,821 --> 01:56:01,140
And of course for everybody listening,

1770
01:56:01,380 --> 01:56:06,210
we will put a tons of links in the show
notes and I'll give out that URL when we

1771
01:56:06,211 --> 01:56:07,500
wrap up. But Seth, where can,

1772
01:56:07,530 --> 01:56:10,890
where can people find you on
the interwebs were elsewhere?

1773
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:16,280
My mother's plan was to name me
Scott and my grandfather said to her,

1774
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:19,380
don't do that.
That's a brand of toilet paper.

1775
01:56:20,370 --> 01:56:23,430
And so she named me Seth instead.

1776
01:56:23,431 --> 01:56:26,730
And if you type Seth into
the Google there, I will be

1777
01:56:29,180 --> 01:56:32,880
well that it would not have worked if
my name was Scott. That's very true.

1778
01:56:32,881 --> 01:56:37,500
Well that keeps it simple. Seth.
Thank you so much for the time. Uh,

1779
01:56:37,530 --> 01:56:39,050
and you know what,
we should,

1780
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:44,060
we should maybe I really want to recommend
this because I almost ate an entire

1781
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:47,910
box. Can we talk? Can we touch on
the almond cookies for one second?

1782
01:56:48,150 --> 01:56:52,350
Let's talk about, all right, so you
want to take it from here. I just,

1783
01:56:52,740 --> 01:56:54,580
my wife was a gluten free or not.

1784
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:59,840
My wife was a workaholic lawyer for 25
years and then she quit and she decided

1785
01:57:00,421 --> 01:57:05,250
to open a bakery, but our little town
probably wouldn't attract enough people.

1786
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:08,730
So it became a gluten
free dairy free bakery.

1787
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:11,850
And now there's three of them,
two in Manhattan,

1788
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:15,600
one in Hastings on Hudson called
by the way, they don't ship.

1789
01:57:15,900 --> 01:57:18,720
So you're going to have to get yourself
on an airplane and go to the, by the way,

1790
01:57:18,721 --> 01:57:19,554
bakery,

1791
01:57:19,590 --> 01:57:23,550
don't bother telling them that I sent
you because you will not get a discount.

1792
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:27,110
And why is why the name,
by the way.

1793
01:57:27,770 --> 01:57:30,560
So, uh, the idea, I was, uh,

1794
01:57:30,710 --> 01:57:35,710
teaching naming one of the long form
free seminars I ran years ago and the

1795
01:57:38,061 --> 01:57:39,260
bakery was just getting started.

1796
01:57:39,261 --> 01:57:43,730
So we used it as a case study and one
of the students understood that you

1797
01:57:43,731 --> 01:57:46,850
shouldn't call it the gluten
free dairy free bakery in town.

1798
01:57:46,851 --> 01:57:51,170
You should come up with a name that
carries value. And the value here is,

1799
01:57:51,410 --> 01:57:53,270
by the way, it's gluten
free. Who would have known?

1800
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:55,510
And the,

1801
01:57:55,510 --> 01:58:00,510
the question that I asked your wife
that I will give the answer to was,

1802
01:58:01,651 --> 01:58:04,500
if I could only have one thing
at the bakery, what should I try?

1803
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:09,000
And the almond cookies were
the first answer. I'm Sh and
I've heard, uh, we have a,

1804
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:11,910
we with a mutual friend,
Jeff Jeffery Zurawski.

1805
01:58:12,190 --> 01:58:16,680
Jay Z and the four hour chef for those
of you have read it, uh, who's named,

1806
01:58:16,860 --> 01:58:19,320
named off a whole list of
others that I need to try.

1807
01:58:19,321 --> 01:58:23,310
But the Allmond cookies are amazing.

1808
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:28,080
You just have to try them. And, uh, I can
tolerate dairy, I can tolerate gluten.

1809
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:32,230
These are just a home
run. And I remember, uh,

1810
01:58:33,210 --> 01:58:35,490
having a box in the,
uh,

1811
01:58:35,700 --> 01:58:39,960
in a hotel in New York City and I sat
down and I opened it and I knew it was

1812
01:58:39,961 --> 01:58:43,300
trouble as soon as I saw the cookies
and I had one and I was like, okay,

1813
01:58:43,660 --> 01:58:47,110
that's enough. Put it away. It wasn't
one of my cheat days. And you know,

1814
01:58:47,111 --> 01:58:49,450
three quarters of a box
later, I'm like, all right,

1815
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:54,340
I have to give these to the staff or
I'm going to eat this entire box. But,

1816
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:59,380
uh, the, uh, yeah, I will,
I will leave it at that.

1817
01:58:59,381 --> 01:59:01,690
And for those of you who
follow my, my, my stuff,

1818
01:59:01,691 --> 01:59:06,580
you know that I love pastries and I have
a high bar. So, uh, on that note said,

1819
01:59:06,581 --> 01:59:10,450
thank you so much for all the time.
Hopefully get to see you again soon.

1820
01:59:10,780 --> 01:59:11,980
And to everybody listening,

1821
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:16,180
you can find the show notes with
links to everything that Seth has

1822
01:59:16,181 --> 01:59:21,181
mentioned@fourhourworkweek.com
forward slash podcast and a Seth.

1823
01:59:21,461 --> 01:59:25,630
Any other parting words? You know, I
usually end by saying go make a Ruckus,

1824
01:59:25,690 --> 01:59:28,480
but in your case I don't need
to because you always do.

1825
01:59:28,510 --> 01:59:32,620
Thank you for leading us
this. Ferris. Thank you. So,

1826
01:59:33,070 --> 01:59:35,200
until next time guys,
thank you for listening.

1827
01:59:41,110 --> 01:59:44,510
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

1828
01:59:44,870 --> 01:59:47,510
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1829
01:59:47,780 --> 01:59:50,780
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1830
01:59:50,781 --> 01:59:53,390
Would you enjoy getting a short
email from me every Friday?

1831
01:59:53,660 --> 01:59:57,920
That provides a little more soul of
fun before the weekend and five bullet

1832
01:59:57,921 --> 02:00:02,540
Friday is a very short email where I share
the coolest things I've found or that

1833
02:00:02,541 --> 02:00:04,130
I've been pondering over the week.

1834
02:00:04,340 --> 02:00:07,130
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

1835
02:00:07,131 --> 02:00:10,580
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1836
02:00:10,581 --> 02:00:14,900
somehow dug up in the, uh, the
world of the esoteric as I do.

1837
02:00:15,170 --> 02:00:20,170
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1838
02:00:20,870 --> 02:00:23,570
close friends for instance,
and it's very short.

1839
02:00:23,660 --> 02:00:28,610
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend,

1840
02:00:28,670 --> 02:00:30,830
so if you want to receive that,

this episode is

1859
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:42,890
brought to you by audible,
which I've used for years.

1860
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:46,850
I love audiobooks and I've two
to recommend right off the bat.

1861
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:50,780
Number one is perhaps my favorite
audio book of all time and that is the

1862
02:01:50,781 --> 02:01:52,880
graveyard book by Neil Gaiman.

1863
02:01:52,940 --> 02:01:57,140
The only audiobook I've wanted to
immediately listen to a second time.

1864
02:01:57,141 --> 02:02:01,490
As soon as I finished. It's amazing.
You will thank me the graveyard book.

1865
02:02:01,550 --> 02:02:04,250
The second is vagabonding by Rolf Potts,

1866
02:02:04,280 --> 02:02:08,870
which had a huge impact on my life and
formed the basis for a lot of what became

1867
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:09,920
the four hour workweek.

1868
02:02:10,010 --> 02:02:15,010
