1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,890
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,891 --> 00:00:06,200
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,190
I'm a cybernetic organism.

4
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,040
This episode is brought
to you by four sigmatic.

5
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,890
You might remember four sigmatic
for their mushroom coffee,

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,060
which was created by those clever finished
founders and when I first mentioned

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,480
that coffee on this podcast,
the product sold out in less than a week.

8
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:41,530
It lights you up like a Christmas tree,
which can be really useful. However,

9
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,940
recently I've been testing the opposite
side of the spectrum and new product and

10
00:00:45,941 --> 00:00:50,770
that is their Reishi mushroom elixir
to help me end my day to get to sleep.

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,680
As you guys may know,
longtime listeners,

12
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:57,400
at least I struggled with insomnia for
decades. I have a largely fixed that,

13
00:00:57,401 --> 00:01:00,490
but still shutting off my monkey
brain has never been easy,

14
00:01:00,491 --> 00:01:03,220
still isn't easy very
often and I found Reishi,

15
00:01:03,221 --> 00:01:06,610
which I've been fascinated by for
a few years now, has been very,

16
00:01:06,611 --> 00:01:10,540
very effective and calming
their old formula. However,

17
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:15,430
four sigmatic old formula included
Stevia and I like to avoid sweeteners,

18
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,250
all sweeteners for a host of reasons,

19
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,240
and I then just ping them and asked,
hey guys,

20
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,990
I would love to experiment with
this and maybe actually suggested,

21
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,410
but I'd like a version without
sweeteners if you'd be open to it,

22
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,700
if too much of a headache,
don't worry.

23
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,840
And they are always game
for experimentation.

24
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,780
And so they created a special
custom version without the Stevia,

25
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:41,140
without sweeteners.
Now it is part of my nightly routine.

26
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,260
Their ratio elixir comes
in single serving packets,

27
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:47,200
which are perfect for travel and in fact
I'm about to leave the country right

28
00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:48,730
now and I have a packet in front of me.

29
00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:52,270
This just going to sit in
the end of my carry on bag.

30
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,230
You only need hot water and it mixes very,
very easily.

31
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,000
Here's some recommended copy
that they put in the read,

32
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,780
so I'm going to read it and then I'll
give you my take quote, a warning.

33
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:06,340
For those in the experimental mindset,

34
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,850
Reishi is strong and bitter in
parentheses like any great medicine.

35
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,410
So if the bitterness is too much,

36
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:15,740
I recommend trying it with honey and or
nut milk such as almond milk and quote.

37
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,920
So I'm going to say no,

38
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,420
you should suck it up and you should drink
the tea because it's not that bitter.

39
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,990
And maybe you should take the advice
of all Chinese people when they're

40
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:29,170
criticizing young ins.
When they say Boone should a cool,

41
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,570
which means you're not
able to eat bitterness.

42
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Bitter is in many cases and indication
of things that help liver detoxification

43
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:39,490
and so on.
Not saying that's the case here,

44
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:44,290
but I've tested this ratio
lecture on family members,

45
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,750
on friends, everybody has liked
it. It's a little bit, or if the,

46
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:50,590
it's not that hard.
So I would just say suck it up and no,

47
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,760
don't put in honey or not milk or any of
that shit. Just drink the goddamn tea.

48
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:57,880
It's delicious I think. Right? If
you like poo air, that kind of stuff,

49
00:02:57,881 --> 00:03:01,420
that type of tea, you're going
to dig it. So just try it. Okay.

50
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,530
Back to then my read. If you'd like
to naturally improve your sleep,

51
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,450
both onset and quality,

52
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:12,451
I think naturally you might just
enjoy this ratio lecture without any

53
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:17,200
sweeteners. It has organic, Reishi
extract, organic fueled, mint extract,

54
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:21,670
organic rose hips extract, organic
Tulsi extract, and that's it.

55
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,830
No fancy stuff, no artificial watching
McCall at anything. So check it out.

69
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,150
This episode is brought to
you by five bullet Friday,

70
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,400
my very own email newsletter.

71
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,000
It's become one of the most popular email
newsletters in the world with millions

72
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:31,580
of subscribers and it's super,
super simple.

73
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,630
It does not clog up your inbox every
Friday. I send out five bullet points.

74
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,300
Super short of the coolest
things I've found that week,

75
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,890
which sometimes includes apps, books,
documentaries, supplements, gadgets,

76
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:44,750
new self experiments, hacks, tricks,

77
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,400
and all sorts of weird stuff that I
dig up from around the world. You guys,

78
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:53,180
podcast listeners and book readers have
asked me for something short and action

79
00:04:53,181 --> 00:04:56,420
packed for a very long time because
after all of the podcasts, the books,

80
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,750
they can be quite long and that's
why I created five bullet Friday.

81
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,850
It's become one of my favorite
things I do every week. It's free.

82
00:05:04,851 --> 00:05:07,760
It's always going to be free and
you can learn more at Tim. Dot.

83
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:12,110
Blog forward slash Friday. That's
Tim. Dot. Blog forward slash Friday.

84
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,610
I get asked a lot how I
meet guests for the podcast.

85
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:19,910
Some of the most amazing people I've ever
interacted with, and little known fact,

86
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:23,860
I've met probably 25% of them because
they first subscribed to five.

87
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:27,680
We'll have Friday, so you'll be in
good company. It's a lot of fun.

88
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,370
Five bullet Friday is only available
if you subscribe via email.

89
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,490
I do not publish the content on
the blog or anywhere else. Also,

90
00:05:34,491 --> 00:05:38,180
if I'm doing small in person meetups,
offering early access to startups,

91
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:41,600
Beta testing, special deals, or
anything else that's very limited,

92
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,160
I share it first with five bullet Friday
subscribers, so check it out, Tim. Dot.

93
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:49,630
Blog forward slash Friday.
If you listen to this podcast,

94
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:54,410
it's very likely that you'd dig it a lot
and you can of course easily subscribe

95
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:57,380
any time. So easy peasy. Again,

96
00:05:57,381 --> 00:06:01,940
that's tim.blog forward slash Friday
and thanks for checking it out if the

97
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:06,680
spirit moves you.
Hello,

98
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:07,281
boys and girls.

99
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:10,880
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

100
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,850
Longtime. No, see, long time no hear.

101
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,920
How'd you cope with gin or should I say,
how'd you owe me a [inaudible]?

102
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,790
Something along those lines.
Little rusty, but I digress.

103
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,530
The Tim Ferriss show is typically where
I share the habits and routines of world

104
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:31,531
class performers as well as try to spot
and discuss the patterns amongst them.

105
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,800
This episode is going to be a role
reversal and since I am a professional

106
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:39,650
dilutant professional amateur of sorts,

107
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,710
a little self conscious about this.
However,

108
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,300
recently cal Fussman at Cal
Fussman, F, U, s s, m, a,

109
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:51,800
n the man who's transformed oral history
into an art form. That's not my quote.

110
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:52,431
And it's not his,

111
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:55,910
that's what people say about him because
he's interviewed everyone from Clooney

112
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:59,870
to Gorbachev to Reagan to you name it.
He's a big deal.

113
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,040
And uh,

114
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:05,420
he is also one of the principle writers
or was one of the senior writers behind

115
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:08,150
the, what I learned column
for Esquire magazine forever.

116
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:13,510
Just how he got to kick the tires and
meet many of these folks interviewed me

117
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,890
for his podcast.

118
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,330
He interviewed me in two separate
interviews and in true cal fashion,

119
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,410
he took the conversation to places
I never could have expected.

120
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,650
He really is a master of the
craft of asking questions,

121
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,420
and I love speaking with him as a friend,

122
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,750
but I also love studying
him as an interviewer.

123
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,430
Cal said this interview was one of his
favorites he's ever heard from me because

124
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:45,320
the way he put it was quote, we get
to learn what made Tim Tim and quote.

125
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,570
We dug into some of the childhood
stories that I typically hold back.

126
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:55,571
I don't like to talk about some of
the early days and childhood stuff.

127
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,790
Uh,
but cal can pry it out of me.

128
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:04,160
Cal said he wanted to build a story to
understand what happened to me on my

129
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:06,950
journey, how it explains where
I am now, what makes me tick,

130
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,680
and where I still hope
to improve and grow.

131
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:12,020
And I think he was able
to unearth all of that.

132
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:15,020
So if you're looking for a
true world class performer,

133
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,210
someone who's the best at what they do,

134
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:20,690
then you should probably look for
one of my other episodes, Tim. Dot.

135
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:24,110
Blog forward slash, podcast, there are
300 other people you can find Jamie Foxx,

136
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:25,880
you can find Arnold Schwarzenegger,

137
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,370
you can find chess prodigies
like Josh Waitzkin.

138
00:08:28,371 --> 00:08:32,030
But if you want to hear
about my somewhat odd,

139
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,750
maybe quirky path that took me from my
days as a wee lad to where I am now,

140
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,140
then this may be an episode of interest.

141
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,510
Cal is really,
really a fascinating specimen,

142
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,380
and I've interviewed him twice.
If you want to hear cal side of the story,

143
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,320
his entire insane meandering
adventure of life,

144
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:00,350
which includes taking shots with hunter
s Thompson and working alongside hunter,

145
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,940
uh, for a period of time, you
can hear that at Tim. Dot.

146
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:07,941
Blog forward slash cow and you should
absolutely listen to more of cows

147
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:12,630
interviews. So check out his new
podcast for which I was interviewed.

148
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,090
Big questions with cal Fussman.

149
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,800
So does Google big questions with
cal Fussman, F, U, s, s, m, a, n,

150
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,060
where he interviews all sorts of folks
like Coby Bryant and Daymond John and

151
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:28,530
Seth Goden and on and on and on.
And then there's me odd man out.

152
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:33,270
So without further ado and preamble,
I'm kind of stalling with this intro.

153
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:37,230
I apologize guys.
Here is my interview,

154
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,400
Aka being interviewed by Cal Fussman.

155
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,800
Just went off to spring board
rather just one off the springboard.

156
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:53,460
So I've been thinking about
this conversation for a
long time and I basically

157
00:09:55,541 --> 00:10:00,280
had two ways to prepare.
I thought I won.

158
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,450
I know you, uh, we been
in the sauna together.

159
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,620
We have met your mom.
That's right. Met Your Dad.

160
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,420
They've gone out to eat.
You won't let me pick up the cheque.

161
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,390
Listen to your podcasts,
read your books.

162
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,360
So I do in some ways,
no,

163
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:25,660
you and I thought,

164
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:30,750
well I could do even more research or I
could try to just wipe my memory clean

165
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,730
and approach this in a way
that I really don't know Tim.

166
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:46,710
And I'm going to try and forget a little
about what I know and just act like I

167
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:53,990
bumped him to Tim Ferriss on the
train. Holy Shit. This is Tim Ferriss.

168
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,100
How are you doing?

169
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,010
You're pretty good at trains for my term,
my memory here. There you go. I'm good

170
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,930
trains. So, and it's funny, when I
went out to see you, I went on a train.

171
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,530
And so I thought that would
be an interesting way to go.

172
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,950
And the more I think about it,

173
00:11:10,951 --> 00:11:13,470
that thing that really hits me about you

174
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,560
goes to a story

175
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,720
about Brian Grazer and Ron Howard.
Okay.

176
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,400
So one is a producer and
the other's a filmmaker,

177
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,360
their partners,

178
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:33,140
and I'm interviewing them and
the Claridge Hotel in London,

179
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,080
and we're talking,
we're having a great conversation.

180
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:39,180
And in the middle of this interview,

181
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,010
a fire alarm goes off and waters.
