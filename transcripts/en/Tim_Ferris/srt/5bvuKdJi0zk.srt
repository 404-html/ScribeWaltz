1
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,400
Tim morgan with the show.

2
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,210
So you sent me a photograph on route or
I guess just after arriving here and uh,

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,470
you had a gian open and blood
running down your face. Yeah.

4
00:00:24,471 --> 00:00:26,860
And where were you and what happened?
Oh,

5
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:31,861
I was not but four miles away from
here and we just had the IBJ GGF world

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,850
Jujitsu competition this weekend.

7
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,930
And so last week we are doing very sports,
Jujitsu training,

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,770
getting people ready for the tournament.
Um, I hate sports, Jujitsu. Um, I,

9
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:49,620
I think Sports Jujitsu is the abomination
to what martial arts is where like it

10
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:54,390
takes something that's really cool and
then they make it sporty, you know,

11
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:56,910
it's like, oh, let's give some
points to do some stupid things.

12
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:59,580
And then people that, you
know, the mutation, the evolve,

13
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,610
like how evolves it be it like it loses
its balls and I don't like things that

14
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,570
had balls and then no longer have balls.
Kind of like the emasculated man.

15
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:13,740
And that's what Jujitsu, it's almost
become like Jujitsu to me is like,

16
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,170
I'm going to get in mount or site control.
I'm a pick your face up,

17
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:19,470
I'm a smash it into this cement and then
I'm gonna push your eyes out and then

18
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:22,920
my bite your cheek off. That's Jujitsu
to me cause they, you know that,

19
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:26,790
that's the origin of it. The gentle
art. Yes. The gentle locked. Um,

20
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,080
and so today we did combat.
You did too.

21
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,950
So just to have a total paradigm shift
just to make people's heads explode

22
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,450
instead of like talking about, you know,
getting four points for back controller,

23
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,060
getting four points from mount or
getting a take down and get to,

24
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,950
it's like find a place that you can
hold somebody down and then hit them.

25
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:52,350
That's it.
I was watching a video in prep for this.

26
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,740
I think it was from sheepdog response.
She can, we can talk about in a second.

27
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,240
But you, you had control on someone.
You're right on top of them.

28
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:03,300
They're all turtled up on the ground and
you sort of wiped your fingers on their

29
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:05,970
eyes and you're like, okay.
Yeah, I just took your eyes up.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So something along the lines of like old
man Jiu Jitsu leads to all men time or

31
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:16,020
something like that. But there's just a
huge, such a huge Delta between the two.

32
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,160
I think you have to look at the
origin of what things are and then the

33
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:24,120
abomination of what they become. You know,
what you, you, you see as he's really,

34
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,150
the genesis of a martial art was they
had to learn how to protect themselves or

35
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,080
they didn't have weapons,

36
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,610
so they had to create something to fight
the dictators that we're killing them.

37
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,920
Or there were, um, the Samurai
that were really good with swords.

38
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,320
So then the ninjas came along to use
stealth because if you fight a Ninja head

39
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:46,530
on, you're going to die. So
let's create something new. Um,

40
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,820
and then over time that loses what it is,
you know,

41
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:54,930
like you have to be able to competitively
practice something to get good at it.

42
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:58,320
So then you can implement
sport and that would,

43
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,990
that's what kind of differentiates a lot
of these different Jujitsu. You're all,

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,830
a lot of these different martial arts, uh,
are just really tiny little rules. Like,

45
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:10,090
what's the difference between judo and
Jujitsu and Jujitsu and Greco Roman

46
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:11,320
wrestling and Greco Roman wrestling,

47
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,940
freestyle wrestling and
collegiate wrestling.

48
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:17,080
And so they're very small differences.
That's to make them a sport.

49
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,040
But if you take those rules away,
you get back to what the martial art was,

50
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:25,400
which was how to fight for your life
and not get murdered, you know? Yeah.

51
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:25,780
And I think,

52
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,780
I think it's also a misleading when
people think of the term martial art and

53
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,340
they turned it into some
type of performance art daily
body paint. And I'm like,

54
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,480
start putting my chest all over this
window. I'm like, I'm doing martial arts.

55
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,870
And it's actually when you go back to the
translation from say whether it's like

56
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:50,860
Woo Shu in Chinese or any of these
like boot Jujitsu in Japanese.

57
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:51,760
I used to live in Japan.

58
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,650
It's actually Marshall Technique
that then got translated to art.

59
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,630
So it's, it's lost. It's uh,

60
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,980
some of its impact through
a mistranslation in a sense.

61
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,460
And when I look at your career,
I saw you fight live and uh,

62
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,110
some early Strikeforce events
when I was living in San Jose.

63
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,120
And then became fascinated by your
military career, which we'll talk about.

64
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:21,590
It seems like you're very good at game
time decisions and acting under pressure.

65
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,250
So I want to talk about
training though for a second.

66
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,530
Could you talk about what you
say to yourself when you train?

67
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,480
And at least my understanding is it
begins with hurry up. Got Dot. Yeah.

68
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:37,340
Hurry up and fail.
Um,

69
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,600
funny enough as I send you that picture
of me dripping blood out of my face and

70
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:45,670
like I've blood already clotted in my
mouth, you know, and like, you know,

71
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:49,430
like he gets like stuck as it starts.
Congealing you know,

72
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:52,370
it turns into that gelatin up inside
of the kind of weird cavities inside of

73
00:04:52,371 --> 00:04:56,720
your nose. Um, so if you like
cough, like chunk, start flying. Um,

74
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,740
as I was trying to explain
what it means to train,

75
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:03,020
so somebody came up to me at the end of
practice today and they're like, man,

76
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:06,830
I keep,
I'm getting tired or I keep quitting.

77
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:10,130
Or I had a couple of people that just
tapped from the position that I was in or

78
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:12,440
that they were in. And, uh,

79
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:17,470
so hurry up and fail is this mantra of
I want to get to the breaking point of

80
00:05:17,991 --> 00:05:22,280
where I can't go on any longer and I
want to stay there because then the next

81
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:26,150
time I train that that wall has moved.
I mean ever so slightly, but it's,

82
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:26,990
it's moved.

83
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,300
So then the next time I can go in and I
can get to that point as far as hard and

84
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:34,130
as fast I can and I can stay there.

85
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,570
So the next time it's gonna
move and repeat until finally,

86
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:42,810
if you look back months later,
you've progressed so far today as,

87
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,420
as that Onnit academy and we did the
exact same workout we did two months ago,

88
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,960
same weight and what two months ago left
us on the ground like almost heaving

89
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,480
in,
in nauseous,

90
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:01,510
couldn't stand about to throw up today
we blew through effortlessly and Juan

91
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,830
Shane and I looked at each other like w w,
w what are,

92
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,940
what are we supposed to do right now
because we have an extra 16 minutes.

93
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,230
Cause we went through it so fast.

94
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:14,540
So in two months there was a such a clear
change of looking back and seeing like,

95
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,760
man, I got bigger, I got
faster, I got stronger,

96
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:20,420
and I ultimately got harder to kill.
So in Jujitsu it's the exact same.

97
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,460
You you rush to that breaking point.

98
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,680
And by no means do I want to say someone's
going to break me because if somebody

99
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:30,320
can break me, I welcome it. Like bring it.

100
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:33,380
I see I go all over the world to try
and find people that can do that.

101
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,400
So I can find that point where I'm going
to fail and then the next time I do it,

102
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,380
it's going to move.
You know?

103
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,010
So when you then fast
forward to an example of

104
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,880
an environment which the
stakes are a little higher.

105
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:49,100
So I'd love to talk about hydro.

106
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:53,270
Gracie started with an r for the
use of non Brazilians out there.

107
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,540
It's chatting with a mutual acquaintance.

108
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,370
Actually before we get
to mutual acquaintance,

109
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:01,370
I owe credit to the person
who made the introduction,

110
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:05,180
who is Donald [inaudible],
who I went to college with,

111
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:09,320
who used to be a super lightweight blue
belt that I could throw around because

112
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:09,681
of judo.

113
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:12,890
Now I can no longer throw
him around because he's a
black belt and co owner of a

114
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,360
school,
which is where you were training today.

115
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,990
What's the name of the school and
grace? Who am I to, I think it's, um,

116
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,770
it's where the Gracie is,
is it's in his lineage.

117
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:23,240
Show him coiler Gracie black belt.

118
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:26,870
But Donald Parks and Paula Brendao
are the ones that run the school.

119
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,591
And you know,

120
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:32,591
it is a shark tank of passionate people
that love family and martial arts.

121
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,080
And that's, uh, that's what that place is.

122
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,760
And for those of you don't
want staph infections.
