1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,790
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:06,000
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,380
Now it does seem like I'm
a cybernetic organism,

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,940
living tissue over metal.

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,080

Ferriss show with Rolf Potts.

31
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,600
What are some of your favorite
books or commentaries on writing?

32
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,620
Uh, what is this funny? Because I, I
teach writing in various contexts. I,

33
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,670
but I teach at a summer writing
program in Paris and then I'd been, uh,

34
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,190
doing a class at Yale the last
couple of years. And, uh, so I,

35
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,190
I'd been reading a lot of craft books
recently and I realized that I had crossed

36
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:35,480
my carrying capacity that I needed to
stop freaking reading books about writing

37
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:39,560
craft. That like I had learned all
the metaphors there. There were,

38
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,670
um, and so, I mean there's some,

39
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,700
there's some journalistically minded
books like Roy Peters Clark has the

40
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:54,500
writer's tool kit, I think it's
called a, and Philip low paid,

41
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:54,890
uh,

42
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,890
has a book called a collection of essays
about the writer's craft called to show

43
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:04,750
and to tell, I think, uh, because
you know, the old adage goes, I show,

44
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:08,530
don't tell, but he's a believer in
the idea of strategic telling and in,

45
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:12,070
and he's a brilliant SAS team
stuff. Spell his last name, a.

46
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:16,670
L. O. P. A. T. E. Got it. Uh,
he sort of the modern father of,

47
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,570
of the Bella touristic essay,
the personal essay and he,

48
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,870
he actually came up from New York
to talk to my El students in, in,

49
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,640
in person earlier this
year. Um, and he's, he's,

50
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,980
he's kind of writing is very different
from what you and I do and he might sort

51
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:31,840
of frown on it to a
certain extent that he's,

52
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,220
he's really about that old going back
to Montana high art of the essay.

53
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:38,850
But he really has some
good advice on writing and,

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,630
and jumping back to screenplays.

55
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,070
The breakthrough for me in my writing
when I took my first vagabonding trip and

56
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:47,980
thought I was going to be the new Jack
Kerouac and tried to write about it and

57
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:52,060
realize that one chronological retelling
of what I did was not going to work

58
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:54,010
regardless of how beautiful
the sentences were.

59
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,920
A with stumbling into screenwriting,
uh,

60
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:59,560
20 years ago and learning
the importance of structure.

61
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,210
And so those classic screenwriting,
the tomes, like, you know,

62
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,940
the student field's screenplay
book or Robert McKee Story,

63
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:11,140
which is actually ridiculed in the
movie adaptation. Right, right, right.

64
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,250
I think Cox actually plays a
Robert McKee and that movie. Um,

65
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:22,350
I think that those are useful because
they go back to the very core of how we

66
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,570
communicate as humans,
how we tell stories.

67
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:27,670
And you can get tired of the three act,

68
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,760
a screenplay structure or
the needs of the audience,

69
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:35,320
but the audience is damn important. And
I'm a big believer, uh, and you know,

70
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:37,150
I'm not a believer in cultural hierarchy.

71
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:41,890
I think that the high literature
is important and good, but, um,

72
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,300
I mean I just wrote a Popey B
movie. Uh, I think that, uh,

73
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,310
that it's good to know how Raymond
Chandler stretchers his narratives in the

74
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:55,300
same sense that it's good to know how
Montaigne's structure is his narratives as

75
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:59,740
well. So I would say if people are
looking for writing craft books,

76
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,100
don't be afraid of any kind of book that
just talks about how to tell a story.

77
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,290
And I think that movies are great
metaphors for how to tell a story.

78
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:15,140
And there's crappy movies out there and
you know, adaptation. It's sort of a,

79
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,580
a lampoon of how we invariably
tell stories in movies.

80
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,270
But just because you learn a very basic
and formula, what formula way of say,

81
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,340
telling a cinematic story doesn't mean
that you have to use that every time.

82
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:32,341
It just means that you understand the
rules and then within the structure of

83
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:34,720
those rules, then you
can shine. As a writer.

84
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,200
I very much concur. I, uh,

85
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,450
I have an embarrassing confession,
which is,

86
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,190
has been agonizing over a
screenplay for several months now.

87
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,640
And, uh, I think partially
because I've loaded,

88
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,020
I've loaded the expectations,
uh,

89
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,690
and the burden so large on my shoulders,
it's,

90
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:58,190
it's roughly

91
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,400
an adaptation of the four hour
workweek and a lot of the backstory,

92
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:06,401
and it's intended to be comedic but
instill or at least convey a lot of a sort

93
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:11,560
of philosophical takeaways that hopefully
will, will spur viewers to do, uh,

94
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,600
interesting things in their lives and
make big changes, blah, blah, blah. Um,

95
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,440
but I've been agonizing over at the one
thing that did help me to at least get

96
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:22,730
started. And I have quite a lot
on paper. It was a save the cat.

97
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,410
I thought that was,
I don't know if you've seen this book,

98
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:28,760
but I found it so helpful
because I also read,

99
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,900
I took McKees story seminar
actually, uh, which was,

100
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:37,190
which was a quite an experience in
and of itself. Uh, I mean the, the uh,

101
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:40,330
the portrayal and adaptations
not far off the mark. Yeah.

102
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,770
Uh, but, uh, uh, uh, a fun
experience. Then the last,

103
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:46,641
uh,

104
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:51,641
I really found a save the cat to hold
your hand and walk you through at least

105
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:58,460
getting things down on paper by saying
are right by this page and this minute

106
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,810
you should have this type of element
and really allowing you at least get,

107
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,720
um, I wouldn't consider
what I have a first draft,

108
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:10,230
but a skeleton structure down that I can
use to fill in the blanks with all of

109
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,390
these random ideas that I have. Um,
totally agree. I think that, uh,

110
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,680
you know, become recently
interested in, in Joseph Campbell,

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,840
had a passing familiarity with Joseph
Campbell, watched a few documentaries. Um,

112
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,780
but the, the hero's
journey and, uh, the, the,

113
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,160
the Mono myth I find very interesting,
uh,

114
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,960
just as a way of getting started,

115
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,530
if you can sort of lay out these markers
for different stories that you're

116
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:40,760
considering telling. Um,
but, uh, you know, another,

117
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:41,930
another thought that I had,

118
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:44,510
which we don't have to go too deep
into unless you have thoughts on it,

119
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:47,420
but is that that beginner's
mind that you mentioned,

120
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,820
which is achievable through
travel or vagabonding, uh,

121
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,240
is also, I think one of the
primary benefits of, uh,

122
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,130
what you might consider therapeutic
use of psychedelics. Um, and that's,

123
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:01,701
uh,

124
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:06,260
it'd be part of the reason that people
often describe with the right set and

125
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:10,220
setting a psychedelic experiences. One of
the best experiences of their lives is,

126
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:15,221
I think the same reason that many people
would describe their first vagabonding

127
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,670
experience as one of the best
experiences of their lives.

128
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:23,680
And that's the present state
awareness and the beginner's mind. Uh,

129
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,040
and the appreciation that both of
those experiences tend to catalyze. Um,

130
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,780
but yeah,
well,

131
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,950
I touched on that a
little bit in vagabonding.

132
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:37,951
I sort of gently dissuade readers of the
necessity to say smoked marijuana when

133
00:08:40,091 --> 00:08:45,091
they travel because reality is giving
you this present state awareness.

134
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:45,461
You know,

135
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:48,790
if you allow yourself to be bored or
if you allowed yourself to be lonely or

136
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:52,510
just, if you allow yourself to
have experiences by accident,

137
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,310
then suddenly you're having,

138
00:08:54,311 --> 00:08:59,311
you're discovering in a vivid way that
don't need a artificial enhancement.

139
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,270
Definitely.
The,

140
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,940
one of the pieces of advice that
you gave, I'm pretty sure that, uh,

141
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,640
you gave this advice, I feel
free to, to, uh, to correct me,

142
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:16,641
but was getting lost the benefit of
getting lost and heading out of your,

143
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,720
your housing, whatever that might be.
And just walking off in one direction,

144
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:22,560
maybe with a map,

145
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,400
maybe without a map and just walking
and taking random turns for a few hours.

146
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:31,410
And I have found that so invaluable,
not only while traveling,

147
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:35,250
quite frankly, but even in San Francisco
and places where I've lived or live,

148
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,300
uh, exploring by foot. Um,

149
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:44,220
a terrain that you might otherwise for
the sake of convenience use taxis for,

150
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:49,020
for instance. And it's, it's been, uh,

151
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,730
I think a major priority
for me when I travel,

152
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,230
uh, not for business but
for this type of, uh,

153
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,650
experiential reflection
and exploration to,

154
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,940
to try to catalyze
discomfort whenever possible.

155
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,920
And uh, that doesn't mean a pebble
in the shoe, but, uh, to, uh,

156
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,641
for instance,

157
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:16,560
to purposefully go out of my way
to encounter language difficulties.

158
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,520
And one of my favorite ways to do this,
uh,

159
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,020
I'm typically a night owl like
I mentioned, but when I travel,

160
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,590
I try to switch it up. So I like to try
to wake up in some cases very early.

161
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,660
And I did this in Greece.
My first trip to Greece,

162
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:31,290
I was traveling with a close friend
and I started waking up really early.

163
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,680
I would just leave the blinds open
and I'll wake up as early as possible.

164
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:36,360
And my habit was to,

165
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,420
to go for a walk and just hand
wave and try to ask the locals.

166
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:46,140
These were on some very small islands
where I could find a cafe or a bakery.

167
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,600
And inevitably I would go
to these bakeries or coffee
shops and there would be a

168
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:56,601
small group of really old Greek
guys sitting outside debating what,

169
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,710
whatever old Greek men debate.

170
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,860
I would imagine it's probably complaining
about politicians and so on and so

171
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:06,630
forth. Much like every other
sort of gaggle of old men
early in the morning, uh,

172
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:09,300
everywhere else in the world. Um, and, uh,

173
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,870
and then I would just proceed to kind of
sit down and try to have a conversation

174
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:13,501
with these guys.

175
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:18,501
And it was always hilarious
and extremely fun.

176
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,160
And, uh, I ended up being basically
the court jester for these guys for,

177
00:11:23,161 --> 00:11:26,800
for a period of time in the morning and
they always got a kick out of it. So, uh,

178
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,960
I think that, um, yeah, I
mean I said that, that, that,

179
00:11:31,961 --> 00:11:36,961
that's seeking out of a mild discomfort
or uncomfortable situations I think is,

180
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,960
is really one of the main, um, values,

181
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,070
um, uh, and benefits that
I've taken away from,

182
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,950
from travel in the last,
certainly last 10 years or so.

183
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:50,830
Yeah.

184
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:55,360
This ties into a lot of ideas that are
really close to my heart and that I've

185
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:58,940
sort of embraced even since
I discovered vagabonding.

186
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,620
And it's fine that you're talking about
the old Greek guys because as a travel

187
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:06,460
writer,
one of my biggest strengths,

188
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,000
and it could be an accidental strength
as a person who wanders out with purpose

189
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:14,200
of getting lost,
is that whatever town I'm in,

190
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:18,790
inevitably the town Weirdo finds
me like the most eccentric by,

191
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,750
and if you read my second book,
Marco Polo didn't go there.

192
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,990
Like one third of the stories are about
me with a really strange dude in Lebanon

193
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:31,750
or Burma or someplace and it,

194
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,570
it's sort of connected to the idea of
the old Greek guy sitting there is that

195
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:36,520
they,
they see each other every morning.

196
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,410
But the chance for an American to stumble
in and sort of have a semi comical

197
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:45,460
exchange with them is the most exciting
thing that's happened to them all week.

198
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,490
You know, it's like their wives
have stopped listening to them,

199
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:50,290
their children have
stopped listening to them,

200
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,810
and so they can take you under their wing.

201
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,910
And just the things that you learned from
these guys is amazing. Um, and so that,

202
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,330
that's funny that, that's,
that's very relatable because I,

203
00:13:00,331 --> 00:13:04,210
I feel like for whatever reason,
I don't know if I, if it's my,

204
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,780
my Midwestern tendency to,
to,

205
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:10,240
to talk a little bit less and maybe
listen a little bit more something that I

206
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:15,160
always meet these guys who just have
the weirdest, um, view of the world.

207
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,860
But you were talking about
walking out and getting lost in,

208
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:20,890
in vagabonding I talk
about how if in doubt,

209
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,690
just walk until your day
becomes interesting. And this,

210
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,320
and this is sort of tied into a concept
that I've discovered since then and as a

211
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:33,400
concept set that I teach in my Paris
classes because we're in the city where it

212
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:37,390
was invented and it's the idea of the
flinor. Are you familiar with the flinor?

213
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:37,630
Yep.

214
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,440
Only reason I'm in passing.
I want you to expand on it.

215
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:46,150
The only reason I know I recognize
that word is because, uh,

216
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:51,490
a friend of mine named Nassim Taleb
who's very famous for having written the

217
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:56,380
Black Swan sure. And a number of other
books describes himself that way.

218
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,310
Yeah. Uh, and um, so maybe you could, uh,

219
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,850
expand on that because I would
love to hear more. I quite frankly,

220
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:04,900
I didn't know much about the term.

221
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,280
Yeah.
It's a,

222
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,280
it's a wonderful idea that they get in
a sense when I was walking until my day

223
00:14:12,381 --> 00:14:15,500
became interesting, I was being a
full neuro before I knew what it was,

224
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:20,750
but it goes back to it's a bode layer
and in, in, in, in, uh, uh, you know,

225
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,440
over a hundred years ago in Paris,
uh,

226
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,410
and it's connected through
French ideas through the,

227
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:30,020
the situationist of the 1960s.
And the idea is that,

228
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,500
and flaring is something that
I use in travel, but it was,

229
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,640
it was really invented as a
concept in your own hometown.

230
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:42,170
And the idea is that you become so used
to and inured to your hometown that

231
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:43,520
you're not seeing it anymore.

232
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:48,440
That is to become a purely utilitarian
space in between point a and point B.

233
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,080
You've seen,
he's living that in your routine.

234
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,110
You're not really live in your routine.
You're just sort of,

235
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:57,380
and this is a paraphrase, but you're
sort of Zombie walking through your day.

236
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,070
And so being a full neuro,

237
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:02,570
if Linda is not someone who
walks through his own city in,

238
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,480
in a utilitarian or pragmatic way,

239
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:09,430
a full or someone who goes out
in search of experience, uh,

240
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,550
and there's someone,
um,

241
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,620
it's also tied into the
idea of psychogeography that
instead of walking through

242
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:16,850
a city,
uh,

243
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:20,000
with the idea that you're going to say
see tourist attractions or that you're

244
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:21,980
going to go to visit your friend
on the other side of town,

245
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:25,550
is that you're going to walk through the
town psycho geographically and you're

246
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:28,880
going to collect the color red and you're
just going to see how many forms the

247
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:33,110
color red con can take, are going to
look for every parking meter in town.

248
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,470
Where are you going to look for license
plates with the letter Q on them?

249
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,140
Or are you gonna look for
every immigrant restaurant?

250
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,850
And that is going to organize your day.

251
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:45,851
That psychogeography being a flaneur
is even less structured in that you're

252
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:49,190
just, you're just wandering. Um,

253
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,440
and it's a wonderful,

254
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,250
it was invented to be done
in your hometown to break
out of your own habits. Um,

255
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,260
it's a great thing.

256
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,160
It's a great way to break out of your
tourist habits where you go to a city and

257
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:04,160
there's 100,000 things you
can do at any given moment.

258
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:06,620
And you do the obvious thing which
is go to the tourist attractions and,

259
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:07,820
and I'm not going to knock that.

260
00:16:07,821 --> 00:16:11,760
There's a reason why there
are tourist attractions, but
people talk about how, oh,

261
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,840
there's the beaten path.
Everything's been discovered.

262
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,970
Everything has already been done. And
it's like, actually that's not true.

263
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,640
You know, Paris is the most
tourist city in the world,

264
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,580
but you wonder for 10 minutes and
pretty soon you're going to be finding

265
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,160
something that's unique to itself.
Even along the Sean's,

266
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:28,070
all these [inaudible] even you know this
Shawn do mar with the Eiffel Tower is

267
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,170
if you just embrace the idea of the flinor
and walk until something catches your

268
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:38,120
eye and stay open to experience instead
of your plans, then you're going to,

269
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:38,840
um,

270
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,530
you're going to be living in a way where
you previously had only been consuming

271
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:46,560
those moments. And
Flinders. F, l A. N. E. U.

272
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:51,561
R that's right with a little hat
over the a got us caught my eye.

273
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:57,260
All the languages I've attempted,
although this one very halfheartedly,

274
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,380
I just cannot seem to get a grasp on the
French because I panic when it starts

275
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:07,010
to erase any of my Spanish or confused
anything and I'll sort of studied.

276
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:11,060
But Paris, what does it like
to teach in Paris and art?

277
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:15,710
What type of students are you teaching?
Oh, I teach it at the American Academy.

278
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,770
I'm actually the, the course director
and it's sort of become my baby.

279
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:23,120
I've been running this writing workshop
for the last 10 years on roofs on shock

280
00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:27,560
in Paris and my students
are like age 18 to age 70.

281
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,730
And it's just, it's a large
number of people. I mean,

282
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,220
some people are there because of they
know vagabonding or my writing or they

283
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,620
know some of the other writers
who teach there. I have two,

284
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,950
one other nonfiction teacher and
two fiction teachers, so they can,

285
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:40,860
it's not just travel,
right.

286
00:17:40,861 --> 00:17:45,170
And they can study poetry or a
screenwriting or short stories. Uh,

287
00:17:45,171 --> 00:17:46,940
and so a lot of people have just,
it's,

288
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,400
it's sort of a bucket list thing for them
is that they want to come to Paris and

289
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:52,080
be a writer for a month.
And it's,

290
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,380
and it's one of the exciting parts
of the program is that it delivers,

291
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:56,610
you're there on the left bank,

292
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,900
you're in the University of district
of Paris and you're, you know, you're,

293
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,020
you're firing in all cylinders that
you're, you're writing all the time,

294
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:05,280
you're interacting with writers,

295
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,340
you're reading a lot and you're
being a flaneur is, and this,

296
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,010
it's funny that I discovered the
flinor in the context of Paris,

297
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:14,700
even though I'd already been doing it.
And I, even when I'm not teaching travel,

298
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:18,360
writing the flinor is such
a great creative exercise
for my students who might

299
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:22,230
be writing a poem rather
than a travel story. Um,

300
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,340
and evil and Wa talked about how a
city like Paris is sort of like a house

301
00:18:26,341 --> 00:18:29,640
that's been wallpaper and over so much
that the only thing holding it up is the

302
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:33,990
wallpaper, is that there's no,
everybody's written about Paris.

303
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:37,200
And so you have to find a way
that is against expectations.

304
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:40,890
And the only way to find that is to
get out and wander and find your own

305
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,880
interests.
You know,

306
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:44,850
and I've had students who have
brought their skateboard and through

307
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:48,390
skateboarding and Paris had discovered
sides of it that nobody else is seeing.

308
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,490
And they've discovered, you know,
uh, the French skateboarding culture.

309
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,680
Um, and so yeah, my, my students are
just there for the romance of Paris.

310
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,590
And the great thing is that it's
a great, you know, July in Paris,

311
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:05,100
his romantic place to be, but it's
a great place to deliver. You know,

312
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:08,710
you can walk outside of a classroom and
in 90 seconds you're aware of victory.

313
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,580
Hugo lived when he was 11 years
old. Um, and, and so there's
this huge, I in, in, in,

314
00:19:13,581 --> 00:19:17,040
in, in three minutes, you can go to a
place where Hemingway got shit faced,

315
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:20,620
you know, cause like, we're literally,
we're on the street, you know,

316
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:23,670
that he describes, you
know, in a movable feast.

317
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,570
And so I think that energy,
I mean,

318
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:31,680
it's like we could teach the same thing
in North Dakota and it would still be a

319
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:35,550
very professional, I'm very proud of
what our teachers are doing, but there's,

320
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,050
it's almost like a catalyst.

321
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:42,051
Paris puts people in a mental state
and almost like an athletic performance

322
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:45,330
thing is that people are in Paris and
they're not going to blow it, you know?

323
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,010
Right.
They don't live in Paris.

324
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,860
They're were going to come to Paris and
they're going to do something special.

325
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,840
Um,
and it creates this energy that,

326
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,370
that amazes me every year of people
just uncorking some really, um,

327
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:01,290
some really good stuff. And, and just
having some, going back to time, wealth,

328
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:05,630
just an experience that is, that is
very specific and very, very Parisian,

329
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,760
but very unique to
themselves. So, uh, I've,

330
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:11,040
I've really loved my
association with that city.

331
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,200
Sounds amazing.
How many students are in the course?

332
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,370
It varies from year to year. Um,
we've been averaging about 24. Uh,

333
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:22,100
it's capped at 32.
Uh,

334
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:26,030
and so probably anywhere
from 18 to 32 students.

335
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,260
God, I feel like I should take the
course. It sounds amazing. I, uh,

336
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:34,300
I fantasized a fairly frequently about,
uh,

337
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,480
going to graduate school or a attempting
something like an Mfa for creative

338
00:20:39,641 --> 00:20:43,960
writing because I really haven't ever
explored to fiction outside of elementary

339
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:48,280
school doing some exercises in elementary
school. Um, what do you find of,

340
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:52,520
of the students who take this
course, uh, what are the care,

341
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,630
what are the shared characteristics of
the people who get the most out of it?

342
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,730
Then I'm going to leave
that open ended on purpose.

343
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:02,820
I think it's, it's an earnest desire, um,

344
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,810
to do their best combined with sort of a,
a humility,

345
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,320
almost a beginner's mind, tight
humility towards writing. Um,

346
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:17,260
and sometimes I can get it very young
and brilliant college students, um,

347
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:22,350
who will come in sort of a leg above
maybe sort of a mid career professional,

348
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,760
but because the college student is,
has not quite cultivated, it's, it's,

349
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:28,990
it's a strange thing to think,

350
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:33,460
but there's this sort of confidence and
self assuredness that college students

351
00:21:33,461 --> 00:21:37,930
have that like a mid career professional
doesn't have and that can get in the

352
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:38,980
way of the beginner's mind.

353
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:43,270
And so that sort of know
it all is a wrong word,

354
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:45,440
but like the overconfidence of a,

355
00:21:45,441 --> 00:21:49,190
of a brilliant college student
might impede his or her, uh,

356
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,320
advancement where like someone who's
35 or 45 and is just there to soak in

357
00:21:54,371 --> 00:21:58,170
everything and work as
hard as they can. Um, I,

358
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,610
I think it's the person going
back to the beginner's mind,

359
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:04,390
it's the person who is willing to embrace
the beginner's mind and work hard and

360
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:09,220
synthesize the creative aspect with the
parts of Paris that you can't overlook.

361
00:22:09,221 --> 00:22:11,860
You can't just come to Paris and sitting
in your room and write all the time,

362
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:15,190
any more than j j p Morgan should have
been reading TeleTech's is the whole time

363
00:22:15,191 --> 00:22:16,024
he was in Egypt.

364
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,440
That that interactive going out and
having fun and having a bottle of wine by

365
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:21,730
the Sen and Flynn during,

366
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:24,340
through the city and discovering things
by accident is going to feed what's

367
00:22:24,341 --> 00:22:26,410
happening when you're alone in your room.

368
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,100
And so I think it's the students
who can find that balance. Um, and,

369
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,650
and the students,
I think to a big extent,

370
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:36,460
it's the students who have been almost
like vagabonding who'd been saving their

371
00:22:36,461 --> 00:22:39,130
money and this, this
means something, you know,

372
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:43,990
they're not just gathering from their
limitless pool of resources, uh,

373
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,870
to pay for their month in Paris, but
they have earned this with their sweat.

374
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:50,440
It's like a chapter in vagabonding and
talk about how the work you do makes your

375
00:22:50,441 --> 00:22:51,400
travels meaningful.

376
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:55,060
I think it's the people who come in
and know the value of what they have in

377
00:22:55,061 --> 00:22:55,894
Paris,
that this,

378
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,370
this one month is a special time that
can catalyze them into a new creative

379
00:23:00,371 --> 00:23:00,701
state.

380
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:04,540
Those are the people who are gonna who
are going to get things delivered for

381
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:09,450
them. And, and you mentioned MFAs.
I, I got a mid career MFA. Um,

382
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:14,350
and I don't know, there's, there's
some advantages of that sort of thing,

383
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,900
but I think there's an extent
to which that creatively,

384
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:21,820
a one month program like this can
cover a lot of those MFA basis without

385
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,340
compromising two years of your life.

386
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,830
Right, right. Agreed. I mean, I'd
love to hear your thoughts. I mean,

387
00:23:27,831 --> 00:23:32,600
my basic feeling is that,
uh, the benefits, uh,

388
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,810
would be, and I mean, it's, it's
maybe sounds ridiculous that, uh,

389
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:43,380
I feel very isolated writing a lot
of the time and, uh, it's, it's,

390
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:45,470
it's sort of odd that I'm,
you know,

391
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:48,620
the access to more people than
I've ever had access to in my life.

392
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:53,650
Yet I spend a lot of my time
feeling quite isolated and lonely.

393
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,500
And, uh, there's, and I don't know
many writers in San Francisco, I just,

394
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,330
that's not in my social sphere.
Uh, which maybe is a good thing.

395
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:03,081
Maybe it's a bad thing,

396
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:08,081
but the idea of being any group of
people going through the same experience,

397
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,273
um,

398
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:16,390
having that sort of
shared study experience,

399
00:24:16,701 --> 00:24:20,120
I'm sure with some degree of
commiseration every once in a while with a

400
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:24,680
structure that actually facilitates
experimenting with new types of writing is

401
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:27,470
very appealing to me. So
maybe the month, maybe that's,

402
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,200
maybe that's a great solution as
opposed to two years, like you said,

403
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:31,580
which I don't,
I don't think I could,

404
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,970
I think that will remain
a fantasy in my hand.

405
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:40,000
I think they both, they're
both good for that social, um,

406
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:43,180
that community of writers situation.
I'm just like this,

407
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:47,740
the friend that I'm swapping houses
with w who lives in Brooklyn is a Grad

408
00:24:47,741 --> 00:24:52,360
school friend and I just, you
know, in my late thirties,

409
00:24:52,361 --> 00:24:53,860
I was able to make very,

410
00:24:53,861 --> 00:24:57,730
very dear friends through my two years
of Grad school where there's an extent to

411
00:24:57,731 --> 00:25:02,731
which at that that like
MFA programs aren't really
designed for 38 year olds who

412
00:25:03,011 --> 00:25:07,000
are already successful as writers.
Um, yeah. And that, and then that, um,

413
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,260
that a month program,

414
00:25:08,261 --> 00:25:12,700
I mean obviously I have a vested
interest in my own one month program,

415
00:25:12,701 --> 00:25:17,380
but a one month program can deliver both
the community and a more concentrated

416
00:25:17,381 --> 00:25:22,000
spark of uh, of inspiration, uh,

417
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:27,070
without having to go through a two
year cycle that isn't necessarily um,

418
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,650
tailored to someone in your situation.

419
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:34,490
One thing a two year program can give
you is his structure, like deadlines,

420
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,230
monthly deadlines.
But if you've already written a book,

421
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,370
I think there's an extension to witch
dyke that exposure to poetry or fiction or

422
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:47,380
screenwriting and just 30 other people
who are gung Ho and are locked in on that

423
00:25:48,551 --> 00:25:53,551
similar creative openness that that one
month catalyst can be more youthful,

424
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:59,010
useful in both senses then then a more
extended no certificate program the last

425
00:25:59,681 --> 00:26:00,514
two years.

426
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:05,500
You know, it's, I, I am happy
that you misspoke for a second,

427
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:10,090
said useful because in a way I think
it's almost appropriate because like you

428
00:26:10,091 --> 00:26:10,421
said,

429
00:26:10,421 --> 00:26:15,421
the charge of a group
in Paris recognizing,

430
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:20,170
uh, for most of them that it's a very
unique opportunity that required a lot of

431
00:26:20,171 --> 00:26:25,171
sacrifices to make happen would charge
it with a certain useful energy,

432
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:31,330
which I'm trying to reinfuse
into a lot of what I do because,

433
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,150
uh, and I don't think this
is purely a function of age.

434
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:39,010
Maybe it's exposure to just the doom
and gloom of just general Internet

435
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,500
bullshit. Uh, but, uh,

436
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:46,560
I'm trying to beat back my own cynicism
with a club and really try to prevent

437
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:55,140
myself from becoming apathetic. That's
a very strong word. But there's just,

438
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,680
there's a lot of instability and,

439
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:02,130
and craziness in the world if you go
looking for it or if you were spending a

440
00:27:02,131 --> 00:27:05,790
lot of time, uh, on
social media for instance,

441
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,640
and I want to combat that with,
uh,

442
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:13,890
a pipe positive and charge
you youthful energy. Uh,

443
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,140
so it's very interesting.

444
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,570
Well, I think that that goes
back to the idea of, uh,

445
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:24,280
of success versus lack
of six test and that, um,

446
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,900
as certain kinds of successes,

447
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:28,030
more meaningful when you're
30 than when you're 40,

448
00:27:28,031 --> 00:27:31,150
because you have a different relationship
to that success after you've been

449
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:32,260
steeped in for awhile.

450
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,480
So finding the screenplay that you
can bang your head up against or,

451
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:40,740
or embracing poetry or any or,
you know,

452
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,980
Samba dancing or, or anything else
with that, didn't, that vulnerability,

453
00:27:44,981 --> 00:27:48,640
that beginner's mind, uh, that
youthfulness. I think that, that,

454
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:54,100
that is so useful to use the
right word this time, uh, in,

455
00:27:54,101 --> 00:27:57,130
in rejuvenating your
relationship with yourself.

456
00:27:57,131 --> 00:28:01,390
Just like when I started out as a travel
writer and there were certain by lines

457
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,520
that were really important to
me that aren't now, you know,

458
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:07,660
and by by lines you mean
publications and credits?

459
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,210
Yeah, yeah. I'm going to write
for the San Francisco Chronicle.

460
00:28:10,211 --> 00:28:13,240
I'm going to write for national
geographic traveler, good publications.

461
00:28:13,241 --> 00:28:17,830
They do good work. But I realized that
once you took away the, the, the, um,

462
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,140
the thrill of that initial success of
having a major publication acknowledged

463
00:28:23,141 --> 00:28:27,290
the quality of your work, then
the h shifted, you know, what,

464
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:30,440
what I was doing with the content, uh, I,

465
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,540
I guess transformed a
little bit. And so, um,

466
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:39,220
so now I'm writing a screenplay with,
with zombies in it.

467
00:28:39,221 --> 00:28:42,370
Not that I'm going to become
a a B movie screenwriter now,

468
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,890
but it brings me joy,
you know,

469
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:49,891
sort of that childlike joy in the creative
process that doesn't exist anymore

470
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:53,350
with what I've already become
professionally successful at. Right.

471
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,180
And so I think you get into that pattern
and it sounds like you're experimenting

472
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,920
with this already,
um,

473
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:03,070
that you become successful in a certain
manner of, of creative expression.

474
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,790
And, and a, and a certain
matter of expertise. Um,

475
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:11,740
and then I think a way to keep yourself
fresh is to try activities that you

476
00:29:11,741 --> 00:29:13,920
might fail at. And a, I think, right,

477
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,370
if you aren't failing at something
a fairly substantial once a year,

478
00:29:18,371 --> 00:29:19,840
then you're not pushing yourself enough.

479
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:24,220
And of course travel is a great
venue for inviting failure and, um,

480
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,230
you know, mild humiliation. Uh,
but, but, but sure. I, you know,

481
00:29:29,231 --> 00:29:31,660
I think,
I think it's great that you're,

482
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:35,090
that you're bashing your head against a
screen play that might not work out. Um,

483
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,570
10 years ago or maybe eight years ago,

484
00:29:37,571 --> 00:29:41,020
I sort of had my vagabonding screenplay
where I was sort of expressing

485
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,990
philosophical ideas of,
of a,

486
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:47,650
a vagabonding through a coming of age
story and it didn't quite work. You know,

487
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:48,730
maybe I'll go back to it,

488
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:53,760
but it was a good thing to have
tried and not quite succeeded at.

489
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,610
And I'm not saying that that's where,
where your screenplay is going,

490
00:29:57,611 --> 00:30:01,570
but that process I think is important
for keeping yourself sharp and keeping a

491
00:30:01,571 --> 00:30:02,404
perspective,

492
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,580
a mid certain jadedness
to other kinds of success.

493
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:12,490
Definitely. Uh, the,
the, the, the adjective,

494
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:15,460
well, the adjective successful
has come up a couple of times.

495
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,410
When you think of the word successful,

496
00:30:17,411 --> 00:30:19,840
who's the first person
who comes to mind and why?

497
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:25,410
Oh Man. I don't know if, I don't know
if a person comes to mind. I, you know,

498
00:30:25,411 --> 00:30:28,520
I think when I was 28,
I may have a,

499
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:33,230
I may have been able to name like a travel
writer that I wanted to be like Pico

500
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:38,040
Iyer or Tim Cahill. Um, and I
think the reason that a person,

501
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:39,190
when you asked that question at first,

502
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:42,780
it didn't pop into my head because I have
that different relationship to success.

503
00:30:42,781 --> 00:30:47,730
You know, that the hunger
to be like Pico or Tim, um,

504
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,020
played itself out in
a very integrated way.

505
00:30:50,021 --> 00:30:53,610
It became a part of the energy
that made me a travel writer. Uh,

506
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,290
and so now I don't think,
you know, it's funny, I,

507
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:03,510
um, I feel like our backgrounds are
fairly similar. I'm from Wichita, Kansas.

508
00:31:03,511 --> 00:31:07,890
You're from springs, right? That's
right. But Bullseye Middleclass families,

509
00:31:07,891 --> 00:31:09,040
it feels like that's right.

510
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,930
And you had your Ivy League [inaudible]
league experience right out of high

511
00:31:12,931 --> 00:31:15,870
school.
And I didn't it like I did my,

512
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:20,250
I taught at Penn and then Yale for a
couple of years really recently. Um,

513
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,810
and that became a part of me felt like
I needed to measure myself against that

514
00:31:24,811 --> 00:31:27,710
standard and it was a great experience.
Um,

515
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:31,680
but now that has also been
folded into my idea of success.

516
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:36,030
And so I think this might
be a little bit tied into

517
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,500
talking about the creative process
and sometimes it can be difficult.

518
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:44,270
That what my notions of success,
how are,

519
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,320
are slightly different and
it has a different energy.

520
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,140
So I'm not thinking about
someone I want to be necessarily,

521
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:53,250
but it's back into that.
I think it's more about appreciation.

522
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,680
Like my role models and I,

523
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:58,650
I'm still blanking on who I might
point out are not achievement people,

524
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:00,630
but appreciation people,
you know,

525
00:32:00,631 --> 00:32:05,631
people who have found the success and are
synthesizing it in sort of a good life

526
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:06,983
kind of way.

527
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,820
Definitely.
I think this is just somebody who can't,

528
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,380
who comes to mind? Uh, I've, I've asked
this question of a lot of folks and, uh,

529
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:20,330
more, uh, more than a few times,
Steve jobs comes up, but he's,

530
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:24,350
he's actually not a in many ways,
um,

531
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,710
exemplary, uh, based on
what you just described.

532
00:32:28,711 --> 00:32:32,700
And I think Steve Wozniaks
cofounder very much is, uh, I've,

533
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:37,701
I've met was on a number of occasions
and I even gave him a little tango class

534
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:43,230
prior his dancing with the
stars experiment. And, uh,

535
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:48,250
he released savers and
loves life and has built a,

536
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:55,450
as built a life for himself where he is
able to enjoy or experience the joy of

537
00:32:58,551 --> 00:33:02,960
discovery and, uh, is a
genuinely happy human being.

538
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,390
Um,
and this is going to sound funny,

539
00:33:05,391 --> 00:33:10,240
but despite all of his material success,
uh, because I think that, uh, the,

540
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,550
the material success,
not to say that that's a bad thing,

541
00:33:13,551 --> 00:33:18,410
I think that it enables more than it
disables, but, uh, it can become a,

542
00:33:18,411 --> 00:33:20,530
it can make people very defensive,
uh,

543
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,470
where they spend the vast majority of
their time managing the protection and

544
00:33:24,471 --> 00:33:29,360
growth of their assets as opposed to the
growth in other areas of their lives.

545
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,370
And I've, I've certainly, I've been,

546
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:33,050
I don't have hundreds of millions
dollars or anything like that,

547
00:33:33,051 --> 00:33:36,680
but I've been very fortunate to have
enough success with publishing and

548
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,470
elsewhere that, uh, I don't
have to worry about where the,

549
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,840
the next month's rent is coming
from. Um, but I've, I've,

550
00:33:42,841 --> 00:33:46,490
I've witnessed that in myself and
I think that there's a possibility,

551
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:50,710
and maybe this isn't true,
but I'd be curious based on
your observations, if you,

552
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,530
if you've noticed this
in your coming from, uh,

553
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,800
a very middle class background
where there were many,

554
00:33:57,801 --> 00:34:00,860
many times when money was tight in
the family and we weren't able to take

555
00:34:00,861 --> 00:34:02,220
certain trips or,
uh,

556
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:06,170
get certain birthday presents or
whatever it might be a go out to certain

557
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:08,780
restaurants that, uh, my,

558
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:13,250
my inclination is to be very,
um,

559
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:19,610
to focus on the, the, the defense
and protection of assets more per,

560
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,790
more than perhaps those people I met,

561
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:27,791
for instance at Princeton who grew up
as Bluebloods where money is a known

562
00:34:27,921 --> 00:34:29,510
quantity. It's, it's a,

563
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:34,040
it's an element that for multiple
generations, the family is,

564
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:38,560
it has become comfortable with,
um, so, uh, unless you're,

565
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,970
if that's worth exploring, but, uh, that,

566
00:34:40,971 --> 00:34:45,650
that's something that I try to be very
cautious or aware of because I think it's

567
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:49,100
a, it's a, it's a terrible
inclination that I have.

568
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,140
Wait, will, you touched on
a couple of things, a couple
of new concepts I've come,

569
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:58,880
I've sort of wrestled with very recently
and it actually made me realize who my,

570
00:34:58,881 --> 00:35:02,200
who my role models are going to be
to your earlier question, but yeah,

571
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:05,390
get light teaching at Yale for example,
which is such a good institution.

572
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:05,991
You know,

573
00:35:05,991 --> 00:35:10,991
I came into into Yale in my early forties
and my excitement at being at this

574
00:35:12,651 --> 00:35:15,200
institution after all these years,
you know,

575
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:19,970
after being a person when I was 17 at the,
at the college fair in Wichita, Kansas,

576
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,390
I remember looking at the Yale table
and feeling sorry for the guy who had to

577
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:25,790
come to Kansas and not even going there,
you know,

578
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,760
just because I came from
a family that, that, um,

579
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,790
that you don't spend money on an
ivy league education. There's,

580
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:35,450
there's more practical ways to get your
IB education if it wasn't an expectation.

581
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:39,180
But me sitting as a
teacher in a class at Yale,

582
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:43,500
this is very recently who's excited
about being at this institution in a way

583
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:45,810
that the 18 year old student isn't,
you know,

584
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:49,440
the 18 year old student is just relieved
to be there because they've been

585
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:53,760
expected to be there for years and it's
a part of their socioeconomic status.

586
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:58,560
Um, and they, they didn't have to go to
their safety school sort of situation.

587
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,110
Right.
And so in a way that's sort of a,

588
00:36:01,111 --> 00:36:03,750
a gift of middle class in
this is that you're not,

589
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,140
you don't have those expectations.
Nobody's going to be disappointed. Sure.

590
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,900
You don't end up at Yale and
then you can actually have this,

591
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,140
this beginner's mind,

592
00:36:11,141 --> 00:36:14,610
that experience of being a 42 year old
who over the moon about being a Yale

593
00:36:14,611 --> 00:36:16,600
professor all of a sudden.
Um,

594
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:21,090
and actually the other thing you
asked about when you think of success,

595
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:21,960
who do you think about?

596
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:26,040
Actually I've been really fascinated
just like in the last couple of months of

597
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:29,550
the stories of Dave
Chapelle and John Hughes,

598
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:34,970
Dave Chappelle being the comedian who had
turned away 15 $50 million and society

599
00:36:35,031 --> 00:36:38,070
sort of said, oh, what's wrong
with him? And then John Hughes,

600
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:42,600
who in the 1980s made all of the best
team movies ever and then just sort of

601
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:44,280
disappeared to become a quiet person.

602
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,360
And did he make home alone or am I
making that up? He made home alone.

603
00:36:48,361 --> 00:36:50,580
He made all of those
brat pack teen movies.

604
00:36:50,581 --> 00:36:53,280
He made hump alone or did
he also make that one?

605
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,030
He may have been involved as a screen,
I might be making that up.

606
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:02,360
But he had involvement with movies through
the 90s and then just sort of stopped

607
00:37:04,051 --> 00:37:08,460
doing that altogether. Um,
in the two thousands. And we,

608
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:13,050
and I'm still in the
process of researching this
personality type because I'm

609
00:37:13,051 --> 00:37:16,080
really interested in the relationship
that these guys have to success.

610
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,120
And they were both judges sort of harshly.

611
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:23,370
And I think that these are guys who are
really trying to wrestle with the idea

612
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:28,200
of who they were versus who their success
dictated they were supposed to be.

613
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,380
Right.
And so Dave Chappelle,

614
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,850
we live in a society where you have
to be insane to turn down $50 million.

615
00:37:35,851 --> 00:37:39,360
People were questioning Dave
Chappelle's mental health.

616
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:44,170
That was a very prominent feature
of the whole discussion. Yeah.

617
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:48,930
Whether or not he had gone literally
insane when in fact it could have been.

618
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:50,760
And again,
I'm still researching these guys.

619
00:37:50,761 --> 00:37:54,630
That could have been a
radically sane thing to do. Um,

620
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,480
a friend of mine,
Rachel cods Egon side who's a,

621
00:37:57,481 --> 00:37:59,640
who's a great up and coming journalists,
wrote a piece,

622
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,820
a profile of him for the believer where
she went to his hometown and yellow

623
00:38:02,821 --> 00:38:06,210
springs and talk to his mom,
yellow springs, Ohio. Uh,

624
00:38:06,211 --> 00:38:09,750
talked to his mom who is a professor and
actually ran into them in a coffee shop

625
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:13,800
but sort of wanted to respect
his privacy sort of thing. Right.

626
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:18,780
And Dave Chappelle is a fit happy
guy living on a farm in Ohio,

627
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:23,640
hanging out with his friends and it feels,
again, I need to do some more research,

628
00:38:23,641 --> 00:38:27,180
but it feels like he's a guy who
decided what would make him happy and he

629
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:30,840
realized that $50 million and
getting locked into a show wouldn't.

630
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:35,230
And similarly,
John Hughes is a beloved guy.

631
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:36,880
And then these are two examples there.

632
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,740
There's other examples
that one could throw in,

633
00:38:38,741 --> 00:38:41,980
but he was beloved for his team movies.
But I think there came a point at which,

634
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,540
especially by people of my generation,

635
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:48,130
there came a point at which that he didn't
want to be beholden to the breakfast

636
00:38:48,131 --> 00:38:52,040
club and 16 candles anymore.
That he, he's a family man and a,

637
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:56,800
and a guy who was passionate about
his creativity and I think he chose,

638
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,193
um,

639
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:03,370
being happy in a city that he loved
Chicago with family members that he loved

640
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,980
over making, you know, the breakfast club
three and making another $10 million.

641
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:09,821
Uh,

642
00:39:09,821 --> 00:39:14,821
and so while I wouldn't say while these
guys didn't pop into my head as examples

643
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:16,330
of success,

644
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:20,530
there are guys that have sort of captured
my attention because I think the,

645
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:24,580
the sort of public perception of,
Oh,

646
00:39:24,581 --> 00:39:28,130
here are these guys who have disappeared
with these two examples there.

647
00:39:28,131 --> 00:39:31,600
These guys aren't disappeared
there. They're not people
who disappeared, but they,

648
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:35,460
they return, they realized
that they had, they had the,

649
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,850
the structure in place to live the lives
they wanted to live and they quietly

650
00:39:39,851 --> 00:39:40,870
have been doing that.

651
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,290
I love it. It makes me want to
immediately start researching.

652
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,670
But if you're on, if you're
on the job than a, and I,

653
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:53,260
given that I enjoy your writing so much,
I'll probably just wait. Well actually

654
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,610
it's funny but I'm not researching
it from a writing point of view.

655
00:39:56,611 --> 00:39:59,760
So go ahead and take it. It's just like
from an intellectual point of view,

656
00:39:59,761 --> 00:40:02,220
you know, there were at all
points that Heraclitus said,

657
00:40:02,221 --> 00:40:03,510
you never step into the river,

658
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,060
the same river twice because it's a
different river and your different men,

659
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,010
and that's probably not a direct quote,

660
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:10,380
but you're always trying to make sense of,

661
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:13,290
of how you're living and
how other people are living.

662
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:16,590
And suddenly this is just
a random intellectual thing
that I probably wouldn't

663
00:40:16,591 --> 00:40:19,830
have thought about in the context
of success until you brought it up.

664
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:24,390
And here's two guys that I think, you
know, we're crazy like foxes. You know,

665
00:40:24,391 --> 00:40:27,720
that that said,
no thanks American idea of success.

666
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,270
We're going to take real success.
We're going to take time, wealth,

667
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:34,090
and live in ways that make us
happy instead of trying to, to, um,

668
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,630
live up to artificial ideas of success.
So I wouldn't actually, you can have it,

669
00:40:39,631 --> 00:40:44,400
Tim, and I want to read this. I want
to read this book or article on the,

670
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:48,440
uh, on success management, you
know, management and I like it.

671
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,510
It feels like an important topic.
Yeah,

672
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:55,570
yeah, I agree. Especially
because it's such a,

673
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:58,600
it's such a nebulous term that

674
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:04,700
I think there's a, there's a
lot of insidious potential, uh,

675
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:09,190
for such a heralded,
pressured,

676
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,520
nebulous term in particular.
Uh, interesting. All right. I'm,

677
00:41:12,521 --> 00:41:16,210
I'm going to assure that seed will,
we'll just sit in my head and not go away.

678
00:41:16,211 --> 00:41:17,890
So I might have to scratch that itch.

679
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,250
Well, I mean, if, I mean, if
so many ways of looking at, at,

680
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,740
at prospective in success,
but in dental terms,

681
00:41:23,741 --> 00:41:28,430
we're all more successful then the kings
of Europe 500 years ago, you know? Right.

682
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:34,370
So there's that. The keeping up
with the Joneses idea of success,

683
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,900
you know, that comparing yourself to
other people, idea of success, um,

684
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:41,360
is useful to an extent,
but it's also toxic.

685
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,540
And so it's a part of this
idea of success management,

686
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,940
which is a phrase I only just now said,

687
00:41:46,941 --> 00:41:50,780
but it feels like it's the other half.

688
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:54,650
There's a million books about
how to become successful,
but perhaps there's not.

689
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:58,590
Perhaps the idea of how to
manage one success in a,

690
00:41:58,591 --> 00:42:02,000
in an enrichening and in life enhancing
way is something that more thought needs

691
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:06,020
to be, uh, you know, addressed that topic.

692
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:09,140
Definitely. Uh, well this, this is a,

693
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,400
this has been a fantastic conversation.

694
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,870
I have just a few more
questions I'd love to ask.

695
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:18,710
I want to be respectful of your
time, but, um, I think, uh, I'm, I'm,

696
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:19,710
I am very hopeful

697
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:21,800
full that people will

698
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:26,890
enjoy this and they should
definitely, um, let us know if they,

699
00:42:26,891 --> 00:42:30,100
if they want to round two at some point
if you're up for it because this has

700
00:42:30,101 --> 00:42:34,390
been a blast. Uh, but the,
the, uh, the questions I have.

701
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:37,870
So there are a couple of rapid fire
questions. Uh, you walk into a bar,

702
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,190
what do you order from the
bartender? What's, what are your,

703
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,130
your drinks of choice or drink of choice?

704
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,440
I have turned into a,
into a whiskey guy and I'm,

705
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:48,930
I'm actually giving myself a
little vacation from whiskey

706
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:55,250
just because almost like with internet
connectivity and became too easy to like

707
00:42:55,251 --> 00:43:00,251
have a nightcap that compromise my
morning productivity and you know,

708
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,200
being in the middle class
guy, I am, you know,

709
00:43:03,201 --> 00:43:08,120
I love Woodford reserve and I'm talking
about the bourbon, any types of whiskey,

710
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,360
but Evan Williams black label,
it makes me happy.

711
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:17,090
Um, but I'm taking a little vacation from
it just because it became my, you know,

712
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:21,800
my booze version of the Internet where
it just became unnecessary for me to be

713
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:25,310
having, you know, another Evan
Williams and you know, I like,

714
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,560
I like this single malts
and stuff like that too.

715
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:31,900
But as far as something like I needed
a freedom app for my bottle of Evelyn

716
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:37,940
just duct tape over the mountains.
Right, exactly. Exactly.

717
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:41,450
Like an anti booze pacifier.
I should sell one of those.

718
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,340
And it's not,

719
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:47,240
it's not alcoholism because I've been on
my whiskey fast for about two weeks now

720
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:50,540
and I never think about it. I just
needed to get my monkey brain off of,

721
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:51,550
off of my,

722
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:56,580
my whiskey night cap because it was
delightful and unnecessary and completely

723
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,050
counter to my own creative life.
You know, there's a very lazy,

724
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:07,460
it was like checking my feast Facebook
feed for the third time in 20 minutes,

725
00:44:07,461 --> 00:44:09,020
you know.
Anyway,

726
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:13,640
eventually I will return to whiskey
with pleasure, but I'm on a,

727
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:18,590
I'm on a little mini retirement
from whiskey.

728
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,910
I, uh, I understand. I just took a,

729
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:25,650
took a month off of booze
entirely for similar reasons. Uh,

730
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:29,090
do you have a favorite
documentary or documentaries?

731
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:34,440
What into my head is,
is Verner Hertzog grizzly man.

732
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:39,040
Oh boy. Have you seen this? I've,
I've, no, I've heard of this.

733
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:40,930
This is the one with the,
uh,

734
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:45,790
I think part of the reason I may have
avoided it with, with a horrific, uh,

735
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:49,370
epilogue if I'm not mistaken, is
this, is this the same movie that, uh,

736
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:54,020
um, uh, the epilogue,

737
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:57,590
well, let me, let me rephrase that.
Our, our people eaten by bears.

738
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:05,070
It's eccentric fellow named Timothy
Treadwell who spends 13 summers,

739
00:45:05,071 --> 00:45:08,460
I believe it's 13 summers in Alaska
with grizzly bears. And the 13th summer,

740
00:45:08,461 --> 00:45:11,100
he's actually eaten by a grizzly bear.
And it's something,

741
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:13,890
this is not a spoiler because you
know that from the end of the movie.

742
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:18,420
And one reason I like it is that it's
such an interesting experiment in story

743
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:18,961
telling.
And I,

744
00:45:18,961 --> 00:45:23,961
and I use as an example with my students
about how you infuse narratives with

745
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:24,690
mystery,

746
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:28,200
with the idea that you're going to get
certain information later on in the

747
00:45:28,201 --> 00:45:30,690
narrative.
And he hurts all,

748
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:34,320
gives us the answer to the mystery
almost immediately, which is the what,

749
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,380
what happens?
Timothy Treadwell gets eaten by a bear,

750
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:41,190
but then it's like the how it gets
answered, but then it's the WHO,

751
00:45:41,191 --> 00:45:42,180
it turns into this,

752
00:45:42,181 --> 00:45:46,150
who the hell is this guy who had hang
out for Grizzlies for 13 summers? And,

753
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:50,040
and I'm not saying it's not my
favorite or it's not one of my favorite

754
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:55,041
documentaries from the standpoint of like
sort of life changing model for how I

755
00:45:55,681 --> 00:45:59,940
want to live or even how I want to make
a documentary. But it's such a brilliant

756
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:05,530
use of narrative. Verner
Herzog is just so good. Um,

757
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,740
literally yesterday I was looking at
like these spoofs of like Verner Herzog,

758
00:46:10,741 --> 00:46:14,940
reading, curious George, which it's
just, it just killed me. It just,

759
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:16,290
it was so funny if you've seen,

760
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,570
if you've seen grizzly man with his
sort of Germanic voiceover here,

761
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:24,810
this spoof of him leading Kuli
as George was Achilleas monkey.

762
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:30,970
So it's so uncanny. Anyway, that
that's sort of an aside, is that he's,

763
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:35,100
he's another one of these role models
of someone who is so brilliant.

764
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:40,050
He is sort of an replicatable.
He brilliant in the way he uses narrative.

765
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:45,390
And it's such a subtle and simple and
brilliant way of telling the story of

766
00:46:45,391 --> 00:46:50,010
Timothy Treadwell, you mostly through
Tim Treadwell's own video, um,

767
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:50,670
that it's just,

768
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:55,560
it's just a fantastic documentary and
it doesn't really tie into lifestyle

769
00:46:55,561 --> 00:46:55,921
design,

770
00:46:55,921 --> 00:47:00,921
but as far as using it as a model for
using found footage and existing resources

771
00:47:02,131 --> 00:47:05,020
for telling a really, really, um,

772
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:10,220
profound story about human nature and
the people who sort of go against human

773
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:14,760
nature and nature itself and
the assumptions of nature,
it's just fantastic. And,

774
00:47:14,761 --> 00:47:17,610
um, yeah, a guy gets
eaten by a bear, but, um,

775
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:19,620
it's less macabre than you might think.

776
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:24,400
Uh, this is a random one, but, uh, we,

777
00:47:24,401 --> 00:47:26,570
we mentioned adaptation earlier. If, uh,

778
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,380
if nick cage came to your house
for dinner, what would you them?

779
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:33,960
Oh God.
Well I'd probably,

780
00:47:33,961 --> 00:47:37,990
I'd probably go to all these and
find some cheese brought worsts um,

781
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:40,470
just because that's sort of how I roll,
you know,

782
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:45,900
it will be the same if you showed up at
my doorstep in any number of friends or

783
00:47:45,901 --> 00:47:49,290
celebrities. Um, that,
that's an interesting guy.

784
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:50,880
And this is another complete aside,

785
00:47:50,881 --> 00:47:53,430
but I'm a little bit obsessed
with the movie con air.

786
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,130
That requires some elaboration.
Okay.

787
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,440
Because I saw it on a bus
in Syria and that movie,

788
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:04,250
like if you took every,

789
00:48:04,251 --> 00:48:09,251
if a computer took every action movie
cliche and turned it into an algorithm and

790
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:11,900
spit out a movie, it would
be con air, you know,

791
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,120
with a cast full of Indy
actors. I mean, Steve,

792
00:48:16,121 --> 00:48:19,550
who sent me is in that movie and uh,
John Malcovich isn't that movie,

793
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,310
but I watched it on a bus full of Syrians.

794
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:27,110
And they didn't have any of the
snarky, self-aware, judgmental,

795
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:29,120
hipper than now attitude towards it.

796
00:48:29,121 --> 00:48:34,070
And they cheered at the end and then
they cheered in the middle and as an,

797
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:38,270
and that became a part of my
emotional experience of Syria, which,

798
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,660
and this has been 14 years ago,
which is this amazing place.

799
00:48:41,661 --> 00:48:44,900
And it's become this
heartbreaking place because, um,

800
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:48,980
I know that the people I met there
and who were so wonderful are,

801
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:51,850
are living hard lives now.
Um,

802
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,550
and so I want to write an essay about
this at some point about my emotional

803
00:48:55,551 --> 00:49:00,551
relationship to con air that is somehow
tied into the experience of travel along

804
00:49:00,741 --> 00:49:05,180
with like the helplessness of
seeing what's going on in, in Syria.

805
00:49:05,181 --> 00:49:06,980
And sorry for this to take a serious turn,

806
00:49:06,981 --> 00:49:10,700
but it's one of those limitations
of travel, you know, for all of the,

807
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:13,790
of the beauty of humanity
that I experienced in Syria,

808
00:49:13,791 --> 00:49:17,930
which was such a wonderful place years
and years ago that I have this dumb nick

809
00:49:17,931 --> 00:49:22,780
cage movie tie it in to my emotional
experience of the Syrian people. Oh, so

810
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,920
you should absolutely right
that I think that'd be a,

811
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:30,550
I think that'd be a fascinating piece,
Roger that,

812
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:35,410
uh, so to cheese bratwurst,
that's it. Come on over.

813
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:39,430
It's signed me up. Uh, what,

814
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,110
what is the,
uh,

815
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:45,850
the most gifted or the few
most gifted books in your life?

816
00:49:45,851 --> 00:49:49,430
Meaning aside from the books that
you've written and of course, uh hmm.

817
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:52,360
People who followed me for a while know
that I've given away hundreds if not

818
00:49:52,361 --> 00:49:56,740
thousands of copies of AGB OnDeck.
But, uh, and thank you for that.

819
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:01,390
Of course. Yeah, of course. I think
it's, I view it as, as a, as a must read.

820
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:04,480
Of course. You know that, uh,
aside from your own books,

821
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:08,260
what books have you gifted
to other people the most?

822
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,540
Well, you could probably guess. Um, Walt
Whitman's leaves of grass. Definitely.

823
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,130
And, and, and this is,

824
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:19,870
this was especially a young
adults to mid thirties gift,

825
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:21,520
and this is going to sound funny,
but I,

826
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:26,790
I probably gave it to every woman
I dated for like six to 10 years.

827
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:30,980
Not because I was some sort
of jaded pickup artists,

828
00:50:30,981 --> 00:50:35,240
but because I felt it was
so true to my own, you know,

829
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:36,710
you know,

830
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:41,300
joyous attitude towards how I wanted
life to be and just sort of the openness

831
00:50:41,301 --> 00:50:46,301
like this 19th century gay dude capturing
these ROVs straight guy emotions

832
00:50:48,951 --> 00:50:50,990
towards, you know, the joy of life.

833
00:50:50,991 --> 00:50:53,510
And so I apologize if I sound
data to my ex girlfriends,

834
00:50:53,511 --> 00:50:58,130
but there's a point at which that
I felt so connected to that book,

835
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:03,080
you know, that I would give it to people
I was falling in love with, you know. Um,

836
00:51:03,081 --> 00:51:07,140
and so that continues to be a book that,
especially for,

837
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,280
for young people who are just sort of
coming into wrestling with what's in store

838
00:51:12,771 --> 00:51:15,070
with them for life,
leaves a rass this,

839
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:19,010
this great reminder that joy and,

840
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:24,050
and openness to experience and
inclusivity is something that is going to,

841
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:27,740
is going to be that catalyst that makes
every, every experience more exciting.

842
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:30,410
I love it.

843
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:34,240
Yeah. Any, any others? What do you, what
have you been gifting to your, uh, your,

844
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:36,060
your girlfriends for the last while?

845
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:43,460
Let me think. You know, I've, I have
so many writer friends now, um, that I,

846
00:51:43,461 --> 00:51:44,620
I,
um,

847
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:49,870
like I have really good friends from my
Grad school program who are poets and

848
00:51:49,871 --> 00:51:50,500
like you're,

849
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:55,150
you have a poetry bestseller if you
hell out to sell 150 books of poetry.

850
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:59,010
Right? Uh, and so I've been
buying a lot of poetry, uh,

851
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:03,790
by my friends or even just by poets I
respect simply because that one purchase

852
00:52:03,791 --> 00:52:08,170
and handoff is meaningful to them in a
way that other people might not be. Right.

853
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:09,850
And this is something
we haven't touched on,

854
00:52:09,851 --> 00:52:14,851
but poetry is useful for non poets
in the way that it uses language.

855
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:15,161
You know,

856
00:52:15,161 --> 00:52:20,161
there's nothing more pure and distilled
in a way that every single word operates

857
00:52:20,291 --> 00:52:25,290
in poetry. And so my friend Eli
Burrell just came out with a book I'd,

858
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:29,140
I've been buying that for friends. My
friend Heather, Heather Dobbins comes,

859
00:52:29,141 --> 00:52:33,490
had a book that came out with a
poetry and I think poetry is a good,

860
00:52:33,491 --> 00:52:35,920
and hopefully my friends who are
receiving these books or reading them,

861
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:40,120
it's just a good reminder about how
important language is and how much you can

862
00:52:40,121 --> 00:52:44,050
do, um, on a single
page with language. Um,

863
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:47,290
and so that would be, I guess
leaves. We were asked as poetry too.

864
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:50,950
So somehow I'm this po prose writer who's
besotted with poetry for the last 20

865
00:52:50,951 --> 00:52:54,440
years. Um, that, that's
a big thing too. Um,

866
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,940
definitely I need to,
I need to read more poetry.

867
00:52:56,941 --> 00:53:01,050
I've never been much of a consumer of
poetry. Partially I think because I, uh,

868
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:06,590
I dealt with a lot of sort of holier
than now liberal arts majors and at

869
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:13,670
Princeton who seemed to
imply that if I understood,

870
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:17,730
if I, if I insisted on understanding
the poetry, that it was,

871
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,193
uh,

872
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,500
above me that I was lacking
the intellect or somehow if,

873
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:26,220
if I couldn't appreciate what I considered

874
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,400
to be nonsensical,
right.

875
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:34,620
Rose that I did just, I just
didn't get it. Uh, and, uh,

876
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:38,640
that I think gave me a bit of an
allergy to poetry that I should probably

877
00:53:38,641 --> 00:53:42,840
revisit. Uh, besides, uh, Walt
Whitman. Any, any other poets that, uh,

878
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:46,200
that you would recommend to
the intrepid reader of poetry?

879
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:47,470
Well,

880
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:52,050
I'm actually a guy who speaks most every
summer in Paris is a guy named Stuart

881
00:53:52,051 --> 00:53:54,070
does shell.
How do you spell his last name?

882
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:59,520
D.

883
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,370
I. S. S. I. S. C. H. E. L. L.
It's very dude like poetry. Um,

884
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,930
I mean it's like a country song about
the pickup and the dog or what are we

885
00:54:06,931 --> 00:54:07,380
talking about it?

886
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,750
I mean, he, he's from Jersey.
He's from Atlantic city. Okay. Um,

887
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:15,590
and it's not dude like in
Bro, like poetry, but it's
just like if, if you're, uh,

888
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:19,760
you know, like a, a straight male who's
encountered bigger questions in life.

889
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,970
There's something very relatable about it.
Got It.

890
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:26,210
Penguin Po publishes him also a guy who
was born in Kansas and he was sort of

891
00:54:26,211 --> 00:54:28,940
out there and his poetry is really
infused with a lot of pop culture is,

892
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,050
is Michael Robbins who wrote up a
poetry book called Alien vs. Predator.

893
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:37,320
That's just sort of a trip
to read. In fact. Yeah. Um,

894
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:41,090
it's a fun book to just read by and
read out loud to your friends because

895
00:54:41,091 --> 00:54:43,550
there's so much.
He's like using this,

896
00:54:43,551 --> 00:54:48,551
these strange meters and rhymes
with poems about axl rose,

897
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:53,480
you know, rhyming, axl rose with
something else. Really interesting guy.

898
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:55,220
He's also published by Penguin.

899
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:59,630
So those are a couple of dude poets that
I think would be accessible or at least

900
00:54:59,631 --> 00:55:02,950
appealing to people who aren't
usually vested in poetry. Um,

901
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:05,780
Billy Collins being another example.
These are all men. Actually.

902
00:55:05,781 --> 00:55:09,100
There's a woman named
aiming at Duke who Motl. Um,

903
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:13,780
in easy, h, u k. You,

904
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:18,920
m. A, t. I, T. I l, great woman.
I've spoken with her at a,

905
00:55:18,921 --> 00:55:23,240
at a writing and environment
con conference and very
accessible and beautiful

906
00:55:23,241 --> 00:55:25,760
poetry. Um, one recommend mandation.

907
00:55:25,761 --> 00:55:27,650
I might have people for people
who are interested in poetry,

908
00:55:27,651 --> 00:55:29,930
which I would imagine
for your and my audience,

909
00:55:29,931 --> 00:55:34,080
both is maybe not a huge priority of
people who will read our books. Right? Um,

910
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:37,190
just get an, get an edition
of best American poetry any,

911
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,690
anytime in the last 20 years.

912
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:41,330
And read through the palms and
the ones that you don't like,

913
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:43,550
forget about them and the
ones that are appealing,

914
00:55:43,551 --> 00:55:46,310
find other poems by those authors.
Um,

915
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:48,800
and that's how I've found some
of some of my favorite poets.

916
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,860
That's great advice.
And I,

917
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:56,680
I just wanted to raise also one other
poet and I've, I've, and this is,

918
00:55:56,681 --> 00:56:01,220
this is one of the rare poets
you broke through my PR,

919
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:05,470
probably unfounded bias against poetry.
Uh,

920
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:09,970
Naomi Shihab Nye, uh, a s, h, I h a,

921
00:56:09,971 --> 00:56:13,570
B and y e two words.
Um,

922
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,490
her father is a Palestinian
refugee and just a really enjoyed,

923
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,750
have enjoyed her poetry and kept it quiet.
This is so stupid,

924
00:56:22,751 --> 00:56:27,480
but it just goes to show how early
bruising can affect how you behave as a

925
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:31,190
supposedly mature adult. Uh, right. Uh, I,

926
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:36,270
I enjoy her poetry
because I understand it.

927
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,240
It's beautifully written, but
I, I get it, there's sort of a,

928
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:45,250
a message being conveyed or a point or
a description of something concrete.

929
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:49,570
And, uh, I suppose I was based on the, uh,

930
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:52,000
sort of condescending,
uh,

931
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:55,510
lectures that I would get from people
at Princeton who were probably very

932
00:56:55,511 --> 00:57:00,340
similar to the guy in the bar in
goodwill hunting, who's reciting, uh,

933
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,390
you know, right. Plagiarized classics. Uh,

934
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:07,550
just like imagine that
dickhead and multiply it by a
couple of hundred people up.

935
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:13,000
I guess I've never really talked
about it. But Naomi, she have NY, uh,

936
00:57:13,001 --> 00:57:16,690
is a poet that I've, I've come to
really appreciate. Uh, so I need to,

937
00:57:16,691 --> 00:57:17,590
I need to read more poetry.

938
00:57:17,591 --> 00:57:20,770
I'm glad that you were sort of
lighting of lighting a fire for that

939
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:25,370
and those poets are out there. A major
Jackson is another guy edited, cursing me,

940
00:57:25,371 --> 00:57:29,210
African American guy from Philly, um,
who actually taught at the MFA program.

941
00:57:29,211 --> 00:57:32,870
I didn't study poetry, but he was
there. Great Guy. Um, and, and you know,

942
00:57:32,871 --> 00:57:37,550
for every completely abstract poem that's
playing with language in a way that is

943
00:57:37,551 --> 00:57:40,860
almost meant to be pretentious,
you have Porphyria,

944
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:45,470
it's very soulful and accessible
and great. Um, and uh,

945
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:49,490
people might bag, well people
deeply voice, vested in poetry.

946
00:57:49,491 --> 00:57:52,370
My bag on the accessible stuff, but
there's a lot of it out there and again,

947
00:57:52,371 --> 00:57:56,180
the best American series
or other anthologies might
be a good way to find it.

948
00:57:56,210 --> 00:58:00,650
Or even just going to poetry daily and
ignoring the poems that seem completely

949
00:58:00,651 --> 00:58:05,190
inaccessible and following up on
poems that seemed to really be, um,

950
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:09,130
delivering something relatable. Donald
Hall is another great one. He's, he's in,

951
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:13,730
he's pushing 90 now, but he's a wonderful,
wonderful poet based up in New England.

952
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:18,470
Well, Ralph, I want people to, uh,

953
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:23,660
to continue exploring your thoughts.
How can they,

954
00:58:23,661 --> 00:58:27,320
what is the best way for them to, to
learn more about you, find you online,

955
00:58:27,321 --> 00:58:28,154
et cetera.

956
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:31,820
Uh, my author website is
[inaudible] Dot Com uh,

957
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:35,290
that links to all aspects of my travel
writing career and also my career as a

958
00:58:35,291 --> 00:58:39,100
journalist and an essayist if they want
to know more about vagabonding hey,

959
00:58:39,101 --> 00:58:42,940
they can buy the book. They can also
go to vagabonding.net which I can,

960
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:45,250
we should probably remind them,

961
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:50,110
has resources that go in tandem with
the vagabonding audio book that you

962
00:58:50,111 --> 00:58:54,500
published and are also more updated
than the print book that came out, uh,

963
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,830
11 years ago. So vagabonding.net/resources
will allow you to,

964
00:58:58,831 --> 00:59:01,000
to follow up in a lot of the stuff
that we've talked about today,

965
00:59:01,001 --> 00:59:03,850
a lot of these websites like
boots and all. And then finally,

966
00:59:03,851 --> 00:59:08,140
anyone interested in my Paris a course
which takes place in the month of July

967
00:59:08,141 --> 00:59:11,760
and every summer is Paris
writing workshop.com, um,

968
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:15,970
which is also linked from, uh, my author
websites with Paris writing workshop.com.

969
00:59:15,971 --> 00:59:19,870
We'll give you all the basics about that.
And Twitter is at Rolf Potts.

970
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:22,140
So a many ways to find me.

971
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:27,440
And that is Ralph with an f,
uh,

972
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:31,410
for those people who might be wondering
what the spelling is with an o and an

973
00:59:31,411 --> 00:59:34,600
app with an o and an f in an R and
a couple of tees as well. Yeah.

974
00:59:34,601 --> 00:59:38,890
So Rolf Potts and a few folks who,
uh,

975
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:42,070
are interested in the,
the book club.

976
00:59:42,071 --> 00:59:47,071
So I do have a book club and vagabonding
was the very first book I used to

977
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,890
launch that book club.
And a,

978
00:59:49,891 --> 00:59:54,660
you can hear a sample of the audio
book and a and check it out@audible.com

979
00:59:54,661 --> 00:59:58,080
forward slash Tim's books. So
you can, you can, you can get a,

980
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,870
get a scope on some of the books that have
had a huge impact on my life and I'll,

981
01:00:01,871 --> 01:00:05,910
I'll thank you once again are off because
vagabonding certainly hit me at a very

982
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:09,540
important time in my life where I could
have gone many different directions and

983
01:00:09,541 --> 01:00:12,120
I feel like it steered me in
a very positive direction.

984
01:00:12,121 --> 01:00:14,730
And if I hadn't read
vagabonding quite frankly,

985
01:00:14,731 --> 01:00:18,080
I don't know if the four hour workweek
ever would have been written. So, uh,

986
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,460
so thank you once again for,
uh,

987
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:25,350
for having that impact on me and many,
many thousands of other people as well.

988
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:29,110
Well, I appreciate it that and I
appreciate you championing the book too,

989
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:29,771
that I've really,

990
01:00:29,771 --> 01:00:32,530
it's really gotten to people who
