1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,790
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:07,660
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking. Now

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,530
I'm a cybernetic organism.

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,380
This episode is brought to
you by Wealthfront and this
is a very unique sponsor.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,180
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive
in a good way, set it and forget it.

6
00:00:32,181 --> 00:00:36,530
Investing service led by technologists
from places like apple and world famous

7
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:37,280
investors.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,000
It has exploded in popularity in the last
two years and they now have more than

9
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:44,000
two and a half billion dollars
under management. In fact,

10
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,380
some of my very good friends,

11
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:48,560
investors in silicon valley have millions
of their own money in Wealthfront.

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,650
So the question is why? Why is
it so popular? Why is it unique?

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,940
Because you can get services previously
reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

14
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:57,920
pay pennies on the dollar for them,

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,640
and this is because they use smarter
software instead of retail locations,

16
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:04,400
bloated sales teams, et cetera. And
I'll come back to that in a second.

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,560
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com
forward slash Tim take the risk

18
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:12,800
assessment quiz which only takes two to
five minutes and they'll show you for

19
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:16,610
free exactly the portfolio they'd put
you in and if you just want to take their

20
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:20,540
advice, run with it, do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

21
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,430
you can set it and
forget it and here's why.

22
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,720
The value of Wealthfront is in the
automation of habits and strategies that

23
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:31,190
investors should be using on a regular
basis but normally aren't great investing

24
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,810
is a marathon,
not a sprint,

25
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:36,500
and little things that you may or may
not be familiar with like automatic tax

26
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:38,630
loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

27
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,130
cross more than 10 asset classes and
dividend reinvestment add up to very large

28
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:46,820
amounts of money over longer periods
of time. Wealthfront, as I mentioned,

29
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:49,460
since it's using software
instead of retail locations,

30
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:53,630
etc. Can offer all of this at low
costs that were previously completely

31
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:55,130
impossible right off the bat,

32
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,650
you never pay commissions or
account fees for everything.

33
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:02,651
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above
the first 15,000 which is managed for

34
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:07,010
free. If you use my link,
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim,

35
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,140
that is less than $5 a month to invest
a $30,000 account for instance. Now,

36
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:15,680
normally when I have a sponsor on the
shows because I use them and recommend

37
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:17,330
them, in this case,
it's a little different.

38
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,620
I don't use Wealthfront yet because
I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal.

39
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,880
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of sec regulations,

40
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,540
companies that invest your money are
not allowed to use client testimonials.

41
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,360
So I couldn't be a user end
have them on the podcast,

42
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,470
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront
that I've invested a significant

43
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:40,340
amount of my own money, at least for me,
uh, in the team and the company itself.

44
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,460
So I am an investor and hope
to soon use it as a client.

45
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,970
Now back to the recommendation
as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

46
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:50,840
you'll get $15,000 managed for free
if you decide to open an account.

47
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,870

that they would suggest for you.

It's there's

50
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,730
no downside that I can think of. Now I
do have to read a mandatory disclaimer.

74
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,000
Amelia Boone has been called the Michael
Jordan of obstacle course racing since

75
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:33,990
the sports inception.

76
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:37,920
She's a mask and she's laughing more
than 30 victories and 50 podiums.

77
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,330
Her major victories include the Spartan
race world championship 2003 Spartan

78
00:04:42,331 --> 00:04:47,100
race series point champion 2013 and 2015
and she's the only three time winner of

79
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:50,610
the world's toughest mudder,
2012 14 and 15.

80
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:54,270
She's also three times finisher of the
death race and dabbles in ultra running

81
00:04:54,271 --> 00:04:58,740
in all of her first pair of time,
which I'm sure is massive,

82
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,080
uh, and has a flourishing and
high velocity career to boot.

83
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,390
Emilia, welcome to the show. Thank you.
Yeah, I appreciate you taking the time.

84
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,510
And I thought we could start with a photo.

85
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,620
So I was doing research for
this and went to your website,

86
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,740
which is Amelia Boone racing yes.com.

87
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,280
And can you describe the photo that
takes up most of the real estate on that

88
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:26,604
page?

89
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,370
Well, so the website needs a
bit about dating. I'm not, um,

90
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,410
a great website person. So
if, you know, if anybody wants
to volunteer, be my guest,

91
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,070
but it's a picture of me.
I'm,

92
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,580
I'm in the middle of barbed wire and I'm
crawling on my hands and knees and I'm

93
00:05:43,581 --> 00:05:47,250
just kind of looking
around, semi perplexed. Um,

94
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,860
and to me that just kind of encapsulates
everything that I do. I'm bleeding from,

95
00:05:51,861 --> 00:05:53,660
you know, my knees, my elbows,

96
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:58,580
and it's just crawling through the mind,
having a good time.

97
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,400
Microcosm. Exactly. The face of
obstacle course racing. Exactly.

98
00:06:03,401 --> 00:06:04,300
It's not pretty.

99
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,250
And we met through Scott Keneally who is
putting together and may be finished by

100
00:06:09,251 --> 00:06:12,970
the time people see this in
available rise of the suffer fests.

101
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,650
So suffer fest mentioned the blood, you
mentioned the dirt, the barbed wire.

102
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:18,940
Uh,

103
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,940
maybe we can explain to people who are
unfamiliar what obstacle course racing is

104
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:27,850
with the example of the
world's toughest mudder.

105
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,120
You describe what on earth that is.

106
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,930
Well, so that's kind of like the extreme
of obstacle course racing, right?

107
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,220
But in general, I mean, I think people
have been familiar with Spartan races.

108
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:42,060
With tough mudders,

109
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,110
you see people jumping over fire and
crawling under barbed wire and um,

110
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,900
it's just,
you know,

111
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:52,920
you're running along and you have a wall
to climb and you're jumping through mud

112
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:55,420
and you're using everything that you have,
um,

113
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:00,030
like it's just completely
physical experience. Um, but,

114
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:05,031
so I got involved back in 2011 when I
ran a tough matter with friends and then

115
00:07:07,801 --> 00:07:08,730
signed up for,

116
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:11,460
there was this race that was announced
called world's toughest mudder,

117
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,323
and they're like,

118
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,480
you for 24 hours are going to
run as many laps of a course,

119
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,950
a tough mudder course as you can,

120
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,360
and it's going to be in
December in New Jersey. Um,

121
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,290
and so it like a bombing. I was like, man,

122
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:33,120
I can't think of anywhere. I'd rather
go. Then, uh, uh, New Jersey in December.

123
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,930
Um, and, uh, so a bunch of us sign,

124
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:39,420
I think a thousand people
signed up for this, like,

125
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,420
and nobody had any idea what
they were getting into. You know,

126
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:45,710
we'd all run like a tough mudder
or run a spartan race. Um,

127
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,110
but nobody had ever really
done it for 24 hours. Um,

128
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,740
so we went out that day and people
were trying to figure out like,

129
00:07:55,561 --> 00:07:59,650
how do you stay warm for 24 hours when
you're in and out of water and, um,

130
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,520
you know, and it's December
and it's New Jersey. Um,

131
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:06,750
so we decided that we would wear wetsuits
or that wetsuits would be the way and

132
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,110
to stay warm and other people form
of triathletes, we're like, oh,

133
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:13,560
there's no way you can run for 24 hours
in a wet suit. You'll die. You know,

134
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:18,450
like the how your thermo regulation
will be all off or whatever.

135
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,660
Um,
but we did and,

136
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,370
and like halfway through,
so we all go out. Um,

137
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,810
and it's like 30 degrees outside
New Jersey. After the first lap,

138
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,640
there are about a thousand
people that would start,

139
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:37,530
I'd say maybe 850 people
dropped out first lap,

140
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,840
like,
like done

141
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,560
what,
like an hour or like a few hours into it?

142
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,210
Probably like an hour and a half.

143
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:50,080
And I remember going back in my tent
and like just shivering uncontrollably

144
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:54,530
being like, what am I doing? Like what,
what is going on here? You know, um,

145
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,560
you like walk past like the Med tense
and there were just people and they're

146
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:04,020
like lane on cots. They were using
like céline bags to like warm,

147
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:08,430
say lean to put under people's arms,
like a, like armpits to keep them warm.

148
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,520
And, um, so a few of us decided to keep
that we, you're going to keep going.

149
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,700
Um, and I think by, you know,

150
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,740
the night descended on us,

151
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:24,330
it was like 2:00 AM we were like walking
through the Wa wading through water and

152
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:29,100
like there was ice forming where like,
you know, breaking holes in the ice.

153
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,430
And I'm sitting here being like, what
am I doing? Like what am I doing?

154
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:35,040
But at the same time he's
having so much fun, um,

155
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,570
and out of a thousand people that
started that race, 12th finished

156
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:47,280
and I was one of two women.
Um, and uh, so that was,

157
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,240
that was the start of it all. And
I, uh, for some unknown reason,

158
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:55,440
I remember when I finished that race,
24 hours later, I was like, never again,

159
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,190
never again. And then like two weeks
later I'm like, sign me up. What's,

160
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:03,450
what's next? Sign me up. So, and the,

161
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,520
the drive to do this type of thing.

162
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,820
There's so many different approaches
I could take to try to dissect this.

163
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:12,850
But are your parents very surprised?

164
00:10:12,851 --> 00:10:15,430
Not surprised at all or
somewhere in between?

165
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,290
Um,
I would say somewhere in between because,

166
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:23,310
so I've always been like
the high achiever type A,

167
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:28,160
you know, um, you know, I'm, I wouldn't
be at the top of my class. I wouldn't be,

168
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,090
you know,

169
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,540
like graduating summa cum loud and going
to law school and everything like that.

170
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,510
So I think,
yeah,

171
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:38,570
I read that one of your law
school classmates said that
you would find a way to

172
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:43,340
be competitive or to win in anything if
it were folding laundry or otherwise.

173
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,600
Oh yeah. Hey, I like if
I was like in law school,

174
00:10:46,601 --> 00:10:49,540
these set of like my exercise is like
getting on the elliptical, you know,

175
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:53,440
like everybody else and I would like
find a way to compete next on the person,

176
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:57,960
like on the elliptical next to me.
Um, him, those are the days. Um,

177
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:02,400
but so I think the drive and
the determination like that
doesn't phase, you know,

178
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,780
like my parents like par for the course.
Um,

179
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,470
but in terms of like how
it manifested itself,

180
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:12,010
cause I've always been kind of like a
creature of routine and like I don't like

181
00:11:12,011 --> 00:11:14,920
surprise.
It is and I want to be able to like,

182
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:19,630
like plan everything and know everything.
And with obstacle course racing,

183
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:24,120
it's so unknown when you go out
there, like for the most part, um,

184
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,740
when it first started, like they won't
even show, you wouldn't see of course map.

185
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,450
So you want to know what was out there.

186
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,510
And so I think that part
of their kind of like, wow.

187
00:11:31,511 --> 00:11:35,230
Or like when I would sign up for the
death race and they would be like 72 hours

188
00:11:35,231 --> 00:11:35,651
in the wood,

189
00:11:35,651 --> 00:11:38,620
it's then you don't know what you're
going to be doing but have at it.

190
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,420
And so that was very kind of like
a typical personality for me. Uh,

191
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,280
where did you grow up? I grew up
in Portland, Oregon and Portland.

192
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:50,590
And what did your parents do growing up?

193
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,100
So my dad was an insurance

194
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,240
adjuster and, uh, my mom was, uh,

195
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,620
an environmental consultant.

196
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,670
Where did the competitive edge come from?

197
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,350
I have not said it's funny. He's like,
they have no idea. And like I have,

198
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:13,150
I think it's gotta be a Nate to be totally
honest because my parents were always

199
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:16,570
like, you can get C's,
that's fine or you can,

200
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:19,750
you can play this sport or you don't
have to play this sport or as long as

201
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:24,160
you're happy you just do what makes you
happy. And so there was more Portland.

202
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,370
It's never, it was never like, if
you think of like sage parents,

203
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,460
I was like the opposite of that.
Um,

204
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,710
so they were always telling me to
like calm down and take a break. But

205
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,370
Stat, I just thought it worked well.
Yeah. Right. Do you have siblings?

206
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,310
I do. I have an older
sister. Older sister, yeah.

207
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,220
She also competitively driven.

208
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,390
I mean we're pretty much like in terms
of personalities, like opposites,

209
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,180
polar opposites, polar opposites.
She's extremely successful.

210
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:57,970
But she came out about it
from a very like, you know,

211
00:12:57,971 --> 00:13:02,470
way more laid back and you know,
like low key approach.

212
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,510
What to do you want to
be when you were a kid,

213
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,610
what did you want to be when you grew up?
I wanted to be a lawyer when I grow up.

214
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,520
And you nailed it.

215
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,400
I nailed it.
I was one of those people that I was like,

216
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,670
if I set my mind is something
that I'm going to do it.

217
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:22,671
So I would for lunch every day when I
was like at home during the summer and my

218
00:13:23,371 --> 00:13:27,270
mom and I would always watch
Perry Mason and I was like, man,

219
00:13:27,271 --> 00:13:31,830
Perry Mason like being an attorney,
he gets the bad guy to confess

220
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,060
every single episode.
That's gotta be cool.

221
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,150
Pretty amazing. It's great.
I remember Perry Mason,

222
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:43,200
so then I went to law school and then
realize that's not actually what happens.

223
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,573
And Yeah,

224
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,660
you were more a Perry Mason
than about lock person. Yes,

225
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,750
yes I was a Perry Mason person.
The,

226
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,200
so you decide you want to be a lawyer
and did that change that waiver or did

227
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:01,620
that stick with you all the way up until
the point that you became a lawyer?

228
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,460
I think it it pretty much,
you know,

229
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:06,730
I kind of thought of different
things in college. I really got,

230
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:12,090
I really fell in love with
anthropology and primates and so like,

231
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:17,080
you know, I really love
studying. Yeah. Monkeys.

232
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,940
And I thought for a pardon me,
I'm like,

233
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:23,980
maybe I should go to Madagascar
and hang out with the Lemurs, um,

234
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,780
or I could go get a lot degree.
Um,

235
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,750
so I double majored in anthropology and
political science and then decided to

236
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:34,480
take the safe route and
go with a lot of degree.

237
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,160
You Washington, uh, Washington
University University, yes. Right.

238
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,720
And uh,

239
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,870
what did you do athletically
in high school or college?

240
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,610
So growing up I was kind of like a,

241
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,040
I would say like a Jack
of all athlete and that

242
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,710
I played,
I was always on like a club team,

243
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:58,700
like asa softball or club
soccer, um, you know,

244
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:03,290
traveling basketball. And so I'd play
year round. Um, and I was always good.

245
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,320
I was on like the competitive,
the highest level teams.

246
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:11,420
I was never like a super standout
Allstar in any one single sport. Um,

247
00:15:11,421 --> 00:15:13,340
so, you know, I played year round,

248
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:15,950
I know would shuttle back and forth
from practice to practice, um,

249
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,140
throughout middle school and high school.

250
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:23,030
But I started like paring that down and
I actually as high school progressed,

251
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:28,031
I got more and more into musical theater
and show choir and singing and I kind

252
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:31,820
of gave up sports and athletics.
So in college I actually,

253
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:34,430
I sang in an acapella group,
but I know sports,

254
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,940
no sports in college, no
sports recreationally. Were
you a runner? I would go

255
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,020
run to like stay in shape,
but running in St Louis kind of sucked.

256
00:15:43,021 --> 00:15:45,120
So I mean it just like,

257
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,830
it was either like hot and muggy
or like freezing cold. Um, so yeah,

258
00:15:49,831 --> 00:15:52,590
I didn't really,
didn't really do anything.

259
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:58,210
Let's say I'm going to jump around a
little bit like memento, but, uh, if,

260
00:15:58,211 --> 00:16:02,120
if we were to look at say the
world's toughest mudder. Yeah.

261
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,410
What do your routines look like?

262
00:16:05,411 --> 00:16:08,380
You said you're a
creature of habit as am I,

263
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,400
the hours before the competition,
let's just say like the day of.

264
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,420
What are your routines?

265
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:19,380
Um, so I always get up
like super early before.

266
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,680
Well I get up super early in
general every morning, super early.

267
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,520
So my alarm typically goes
off like right around 4:00 AM.

268
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,160
Um, that's what you didn't flinch on
us. We were talking about Jocko Willink,

269
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:37,380
the seal commander, and he wakes
up at four zero response. I'm like,

270
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:39,090
Oh, another one. Here we are

271
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,360
4:00 AM. Um, and uh,

272
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,960
so actually on race days it's
almost like I sleep in a little bit.

273
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,670
When did the races start?
Typically?

274
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,700
Um, they generally will start. World's
toughest mudder is a little bit different.

275
00:16:56,701 --> 00:16:59,220
That one starts at two in
the afternoon now. But um,

276
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,500
like just a regular obstacle was raised
with generally be like seven 30 is the,

277
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,710
I got starting at 2:00 PM. So let's
use that example. You wake up at four.

278
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,263
Oh yeah.

279
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,690
Then I drive myself crazy for the next
however many hours twiddling my thumbs.

280
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,880
What, uh, what other
type of body prep, uh,

281
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,330
or mental prep do you do? Yeah, we use

282
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,400
the distraction technique.

283
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:27,000
So I tried to not think about really,

284
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:29,400
cause I can sit there and make
myself miserable over and over,

285
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:34,400
like like picturing the race or whatever.
But I find it helpful actually. Um,

286
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,490
I actually do a lot of work in
the mornings before races. Um,

287
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,720
so I'll catch up on emails and I'll
do things from like my attorney life.

288
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,490
Um, and um, then in terms of
like body prep, I, you know,

289
00:17:47,491 --> 00:17:51,750
I do a lot of like foam
rolling, things like that. Um,

290
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,710
the older I get,

291
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:56,610
the more I realized like I can't just
like jump out of bed in the morning and

292
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:59,670
like, yeah, be spry as a chicken. So

293
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,380
you're 32, is that right? At 32 32 32

294
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,360
I would imagine you still have a
couple of good years left in you,

295
00:18:08,361 --> 00:18:11,540
but is the whole lot worse cell over time,

296
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,930
the mobility work that you do,
what, what, what does that,

297
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,180
what does that actually
look like and in detail?

298
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,220
Um, so I generally carry like
an arsenal of every single,

299
00:18:22,221 --> 00:18:27,080
like from a golf ball, a Lacrosse
Ball, a softball, a foam roller.

300
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,610
Um, and so I'm really
focused on loosening up hips,

301
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,500
loosening up hamstrings,
um,

302
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:37,190
and every single different little
torture device has, you know,

303
00:18:37,191 --> 00:18:38,720
it's the golf ball is for the foot,

304
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,020
the Lacrosse ball works for
awhile on the glutes, you know,

305
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:46,400
the softball is great for the
hamstrings. Um, so I'm just, you know,

306
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,750
getting the muscles kind of warmed
up and loosened and perhaps, um,

307
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,880
and um,
I do,

308
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:57,050
I actually from a lot of various and
nagging injuries that I've always had,

309
00:18:57,051 --> 00:19:01,520
I have like little physical therapy
routines that I always do too. You know,

310
00:19:01,521 --> 00:19:05,510
like to get your glutes
activated and Ben thinks that,

311
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,460
yeah. What type of movements
do you do for glute activation?

312
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,420
Others is fantastic exercise called Jane
Fonda's that if anybody's ever been at

313
00:19:13,421 --> 00:19:14,790
least for Glick,
glutamine or

314
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,540
where you're sitting there
and you're like, man,

315
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,920
I should really have leg warmers on.
Right.

316
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,740
I said the you're talking about, is
this like the bent leg sort of, uh,

317
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,450
the reverse thighmaster pretty much,
yeah.

318
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,560
It's the reverse thighmaster
[inaudible] on your side.

319
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,280
Yeah. Yeah. And like variation, like doing
fire hydrants like that too. You know,

320
00:19:34,281 --> 00:19:38,280
like a dog lifting his legs. There's
all super sexy things that people like.

321
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,330
Like if you're, if you do them
in a gym, people are like,

322
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,370
oh God that was that girl.

323
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,650
Well I tell you,

324
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,040
I think that you probably get more
attention to in fire hydrants than I do,

325
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,680
at least unless I'm in
a gym in the Castro.

326
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,860
It might be a similar experience.
Uh,

327
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,770
and do you use any other modalities
for prep? Do you use any stem,

328
00:19:59,771 --> 00:20:03,910
do you use anything like that pre-race
or is that set aside for other,

329
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:04,923
other purposes?

330
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:09,570
Pre race, not so much. No, that's
more like recovery, like recovery.

331
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:14,270
I'll like compression boots and stem.

332
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,590
Now our compression boots, the
compression socks are these actual boots,

333
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,700
the boots that inflate the
air pressure chambers that um,

334
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,710
you know, like kind of like flush
at supposedly flush out lactic acid.

335
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,600
So,
um,

336
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,210
that's, and that's post race. That
would be post race. Yeah. So, well,

337
00:20:35,211 --> 00:20:36,560
let's talk about post race then.

338
00:20:36,561 --> 00:20:40,160
So in terms of facilitating recovery
and so you finish the race. Yeah.

339
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And is it true that you have not slept
for days on end after races or is that an

340
00:20:46,641 --> 00:20:48,000
exaggeration?
It is

341
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,950
true.
So any long race that I've done,

342
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:53,040
like we're always having a
matter as a 24 hour race. Um,

343
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:58,060
I've done other races that are
longer 48 that are 60 hours. Um,

344
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,920
and I feel like it's,

345
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,250
I can't sleep afterwards and you feel
like you should be able to, you're like,

346
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:07,450
wow, I was just up for three days
straight, um, running around in the woods.

347
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,990
But my mind,
your body is so physically exhausted,

348
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:15,991
but my mind is still on so much
like on overdrive that I just,

349
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,090
I can't, so I mean, for
instance, this year, um,

350
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:25,060
after worlds have a smarter, we all went,
there was a group of staying at a house,

351
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,890
um, sat around, we're drinking
beers, watching football
game and I was like, man,

352
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:32,980
I should really be getting drunk right
now or something like that because like

353
00:21:32,981 --> 00:21:36,460
I'm drinking, I've been running around
in a wetsuit all night long. I'm like,

354
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,750
I don't feel anything.
Like,

355
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:40,330
I don't feel any effects of the booze
or anything like that. I was like,

356
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:44,180
it just must be this adrenaline
still pumping through me. Yeah.

357
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,690
Um, did other people have the same similar
experience for, is that unique to you?

358
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:53,300
I think no, because everyone else just
kind of passed out and went to bed.

359
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:59,920
So I was like, hey guys, like say
okay, everyone's asleep right now.

360
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,783
Okay.
Okay.

361
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:05,240
And would indeed when you cross
the finish line, yeah. Uh, as such,

362
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:09,980
you're done. W W what type of
recovery starts? What are the,

363
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,800
what are the actions that you take
in the hours following the race?

364
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:16,740
So I think one of the most important
things that people should do,

365
00:22:16,741 --> 00:22:19,050
that they don't have to stay moving.

366
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,820
People want to finish a race
and especially a long one. Um,

367
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,180
and just like Lana couch or go to sleep
is the worst thing you can do cause

368
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:30,570
you're gonna wake up and like
not be able to move anything.

369
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:35,340
So I generally try and stay
walking. I try and stay active. Um,

370
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,590
you know, I will hop again on like a
foam roller or something like that.

371
00:22:40,591 --> 00:22:42,870
And try it. You don't want to
be too aggressive afterwards.

372
00:22:42,871 --> 00:22:45,720
Like you're not going to like hop on a
softball and roll out your glutes because

373
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,620
that's going to hurt really
bad. Um, but then just try,

374
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:54,600
just try and stay active.
And that is in like the next day too,

375
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:58,050
you know,
like gentle movement and things like that.

376
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,210
Um, do you use, do you,
are you a proponent of ice,

377
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:04,460
ice baths or anything like that or not?

378
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,450
If I can't, so I mean, I'm
not a scientist. Whatever.

379
00:23:09,451 --> 00:23:13,560
I all I know is what works for me.
I know people have different opinions.

380
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:17,820
If I can get into an ice bath, I will,
but it needs to be like immediately.

381
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,650
So there have been races where there's
like a lake right next to me and I'm like,

382
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,371
if it's called enough,

383
00:23:23,371 --> 00:23:27,090
then I'll just go jump in the lake
and kind of use that as an ice bath.

384
00:23:27,091 --> 00:23:28,800
But if you're waiting
like four or five hours,

385
00:23:28,801 --> 00:23:32,040
I don't really think it's going
to end up helping you in the end.

386
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,950
And, uh, I want you to
correct me if I'm wrong, 2012,

387
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,250
[inaudible] world's toughest mudder.
How did you place,

388
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,910
uh,
I one for females,

389
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:47,300
but I was second overall in
2002nd place overall. Yeah.

390
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,760
How did that feel? So it was
a really interesting race. Um,

391
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,680
how many competitors?
This was again,

392
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:59,240
there were about 1200 people I believe
is is generally every year. Um,

393
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:04,040
so there are about 1200 people. Uh,
it was once they moved it to November,

394
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,770
so it was supposedly a tiny bit warmer,
but actually it wasn't,

395
00:24:06,771 --> 00:24:09,760
it was actually colder in
2012 and it was in 2011. Um,

396
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:14,060
and uh,
I guess I didn't realize,

397
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:18,440
I knew I was winning for women and at
this point we were about 24 hours or

398
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,740
getting close to the end and I was
about 80 some odd miles in and a,

399
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,600
as on the last lap, they were like,
okay, well you've won for women,

400
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:33,050
but the guy that's winning is
like nine minutes ahead of you.

401
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:36,860
So we're on this last
lap. Um, you know, going,

402
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:41,690
we'll end up with 90 miles and there
are all these people from tough mudder

403
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:45,140
headquarters and like all these
matters just like yelling at me,

404
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:49,610
willing me to go on because all they
want me to do is to win overall,

405
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,473
you know,

406
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:55,310
and you're so tired at that point and
like so kind of delirious that I guess it

407
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:57,200
didn't even realize like

408
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:03,560
the import of that situation. Like
how massive that would have been. Um,

409
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,700
cause I was just like, leave
me alone. I hurt, I'm tired.

410
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,540
Freezing.
Like I'm covered in like 10,

411
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:16,550
like millimeters of neoprene. Like
just, you know, and I'm like, I get it.

412
00:25:16,551 --> 00:25:19,610
I'm trying to move fast for my
body, won't let me. Um, but yeah,

413
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:23,780
so I ended up finishing about nine minutes
behind the male overall winner. Um,

414
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,140
and uh, yeah, so it was pretty, I,

415
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:30,230
it didn't really hit me until like a
day or two later where I was like, oh,

416
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:33,920
I was that close. Ah,
okay. So did you not,

417
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,080
did you feel pride about finishing
second overall or where you just,

418
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:42,320
were you more disappointed that you
didn't finish first? Overall, no, no, no.

419
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:44,600
I completely felt pride and it's actually,

420
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:49,700
it's one of these things now that
when I race, um, it's almost,

421
00:25:49,701 --> 00:25:54,320
I kind of look at the standing is cool
to win, you know, as it, as a female,

422
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:57,770
you know, it'd be like, Oh, I'm, I'm the
female winner, but I more look of like,

423
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:02,060
I have a con consistent goal of try and
place like top 10 overall, you know,

424
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:06,290
I want to be, I don't care, sex,
gender, like I just want to be,

425
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,580
I want to compete to the
best, you know, overall. So

426
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:17,630
the next female finisher, what
place was she? She actually in 2012.

427
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:20,890
She was third. Oh, no kidding. Yeah. Yeah.

428
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:26,750
Deanna Blagg. She's amazing. She, uh,
she's amazing. She's absolutely amazing.

429
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:31,130
And um, and she's like 46 year
old is years old from Australia.

430
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:36,580
Yeah. Just crushes it up
there. Yeah. All my excuses.

431
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:41,540
Right. And she's like the nicest
woman in the entire world too.

432
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,910
So how does her strategy

433
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:50,860
for training or in the race
itself differ from younger,

434
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,120
a younger competitor?

435
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,700
I would say, I think probably anything.
As you get older, you realize you,

436
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,260
you don't go out as fast, you
know, it's kind of like as you age,

437
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:09,210
you're never going to like out sprint,
you know, at 20 something year old. Um,

438
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,990
but you tend to have more mental
strength and more mental grit.

439
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:16,860
The older you get. I'm just,
because you're like, whatever,
this isn't a big deal,

440
00:27:16,861 --> 00:27:21,120
you know, like you're more mature and
you can deal with pain and suffering. Um,

441
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:26,280
so I think that it's just kind of more
like a slow and steady, you know, and,

442
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:30,420
but just keep going one foot in front
of the other. Um, but to that extent,

443
00:27:30,421 --> 00:27:33,270
that's kind of how I operate too,
is that I'm never,

444
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,140
I'm notoriously slow out of
the gate. Um, you know, in,

445
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,300
in the beginning of races I'm always like
struggling to catch up with everyone,

446
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,470
which is why I like longer
racist. Um, so then, you know,

447
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:49,680
but it's just kind of like, you
know, picking them off one by one

448
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:54,680
when,
when you are actually before that,

449
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,520
so suffering. Let's talk
about suffering. Yeah. Uh,

450
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:04,570
I was just reading a letter of Seneca's
is that guy that's the bust on the

451
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,450
kitchen counter over there.
Uh,

452
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:14,510
related to think it's on fasting and
celebrations, something related to that,

453
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:17,090
but it talks about exposing
yourself to suffering

454
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:22,340
along the lines of the more,
the more you sweat during peace,

455
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:24,080
the less you bleed during war.
Right.

456
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,300
And so I practice fasting among,
for,

457
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,230
for many reasons among those
being practicing hardship, right.

458
00:28:33,231 --> 00:28:35,120
So I can endure it in
other areas of my life.

459
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:40,390
Do you do that in other places in your
life where you deliberately expose

460
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:44,570
yourself to different types of
pain or suffering as a practice?

461
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,430
Or is it limited to the suffer fest?
I mean,

462
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,370
with the, with the amount that I race, um,

463
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:55,770
there's plenty of suffering involved
in and, uh, in that sufficient, I know,

464
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,200
um, I guess, uh,

465
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,060
I can't do the fascinating thing I
got and I'm not good with that. Um,

466
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,870
once you're burning a lot
more calories than I am,

467
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,690
and like if I don't eat every few hours,
like it's,

468
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:13,440
it's trouble for anyone
around me. Um, but I,

469
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,760
I always try to train in less than
ideal conditions if I can. Um,

470
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,620
because I think that that,
uh, adds a lot to me.

471
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,480
It's super easy to go out for a
run when it's 70 degrees and sunny.

472
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:29,980
But like when I was living in Chicago,
which I did for the past six years, um,

473
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,850
if there's like a windstorm
or a thunderstorm, I'm like,
let me out, you know, like,

474
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:37,480
let me perfect time to go around.
There was one time that I, um,

475
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,580
they had shut down the lake front path
because the were coming over and I was

476
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:46,900
like, fuck it, I'm running anyway. Um,
and apparently police don't like that. Um,

477
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,110
so as I'm like,
okay.

478
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,550
Yeah, I'd love to see that. Please tell
me the police tried to catch you on foot.

479
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:53,640
Did that?

480
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,670
No. Well, there was a,

481
00:29:54,671 --> 00:29:57,830
it was a bicycle cop who I was actually
surprised that he was like out in the

482
00:29:57,831 --> 00:30:02,540
weather as well. Um, but
uh, yeah, and he was like,

483
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:07,250
you can't, this is shut down.
I'm like, I'm just training.
No big deal. No big deal.

484
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:11,690
Yeah. Did that, did that sway his,
know his position and no, not at,

485
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,830
not at all.

486
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,663
Uh,

487
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,420
so training in less than ideal conditions,

488
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,443
uh,

489
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,270
when you look back at

490
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,200
okay,

491
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,970
the races that you've run,
the obstacle,

492
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,033
uh,

493
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,663
of course races,

494
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,680
what has been the most
challenging obstacle for you
and what has been the most

495
00:30:34,681 --> 00:30:35,514
dangerous?

496
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:38,863
MMM,

497
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:45,730
I would say in terms of challenging,

498
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,230
I always send you, so there's always, um,

499
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,890
I'm notoriously awful at
throwing a spear. Um, and uh,

500
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:57,550
it's well known communities that I
can throw a spirit saved my life. Um,

501
00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:58,960
and so inspiring races,

502
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,410
there's always a spear throw and it's
actually his costs me like tons of

503
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,880
different races.
Um,

504
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:08,560
and it's funny because like it's one of
those things that if you practice you

505
00:31:08,561 --> 00:31:10,570
would probably be pretty good at it.
But

506
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,540
like the, I like puzzled right now.
Okay. How about a throat? His fear? No,

507
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,950
like super come loudy

508
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:25,790
like ace lawyer and I thought it
was like world champion racer.

509
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:31,420
Okay. So continue not to interrupt
and I can throw spirit. No, no, no.

510
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:33,800
But it seems like the other thing you
would sit down and study and master,

511
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:35,471
you would think so.

512
00:31:35,471 --> 00:31:38,590
I actually think that I'm playing
softball my entire life kind of screwed me

513
00:31:38,591 --> 00:31:41,020
because I would like try and throw
it like you throw a softball,

514
00:31:41,021 --> 00:31:42,190
which we do under,
yeah,

515
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,260
the underhand spear

516
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:51,270
Wah Wah Wah. She throws like a
girl. No, no, no. But come on,

517
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,540
the pitching does is completely different.
Right?

518
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:56,460
It's completely you referring to the
pitching folks don't get, don't get,

519
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,630
don't get all riled up.

520
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,400
Um,
so that's always been,

521
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,830
it's always been a challenge for
me and I finally figured it out.

522
00:32:04,831 --> 00:32:07,920
But it's one of those things that like,
it's a,

523
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:11,040
it's such a silly thing to
struggle with, I think. Um,

524
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:15,960
but I guess that also could be the most
dangerous because if you miss a spear,

525
00:32:15,961 --> 00:32:19,560
throw, throwing somebody
around. No, I'm joking. Uh,

526
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:22,950
but there are some,
in terms of danger for obstacles,

527
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,590
like there are times where
I'm sitting there being like,

528
00:32:25,591 --> 00:32:28,410
why hasn't somebody died? And
these w Oh, I take that back.

529
00:32:28,411 --> 00:32:31,130
That's really bad because to me
it did die. Um, but, uh, yeah,

530
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:37,350
but dangerous spart yeah.
Um, you know, when you're,

531
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,150
when you're racing for 24 hours are like
really long and you're like climbing

532
00:32:41,151 --> 00:32:43,580
super tall things.
Like in the middle of the night,

533
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,410
I'm always thinking they're being like,
man,

534
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:48,170
one misstep and I'm falling
backwards and I'm, you know,

535
00:32:48,171 --> 00:32:51,410
and I've taken some big diggers off
of walls just because you're so tired.

536
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:54,530
You just said diggers meaning
falls, awful falls, you know.

537
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,590
So how, then these are walls
that you're climbing over,

538
00:32:57,591 --> 00:32:59,840
similar to a military obstacles,

539
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,740
correct? Correct. Yeah. Yeah. How tall
are they? Um, they very, um, you know,

540
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:07,460
some are AP, some are 10 feet, some are
12 feet, some have ropes to help you up.

541
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:12,560
Then, you know, others, you know,
there's big, like kind of like ladders.

542
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:17,230
I'm, you know, like military tack ladders,
you know, that like climbing out, um,

543
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:22,220
climbing out of water. So there was
one time, I think it was in 2012,

544
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:25,490
world's toughest mudder as you climbed
one of those out of a lake and it was

545
00:33:25,491 --> 00:33:29,330
like 20 feet up, but it was in the middle
of the night. It was like frozen. Um,

546
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:33,650
and so you're like, it's like iced
over and you're like, I'm going to die,

547
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,130
I'm gonna die. Um, but yeah,

548
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:39,540
so there's all these little
dangerous and people, you know,

549
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:43,640
talk about the electricity
involved in tough mudders. Um,

550
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:47,330
which is like a very disconcerting,

551
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:50,740
because I've been hit so hard sometimes
that I'd like blacked out from the

552
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,570
electricity. Yeah. This,

553
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:57,860
this obstacle to folks. So, well,

554
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,180
so there's a couple
variations of it, but, um,

555
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:04,790
basically there's these wires hanging.

556
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,510
The worst variation was
called electric eel. And um,

557
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,720
you crawl through water
that's about like two,

558
00:34:11,721 --> 00:34:16,721
three inches deep and there's
wires hanging down over your head.

559
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,940
Um,
and so you're,

560
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:23,950
you're army crawling through it and your
head is hitting these wires and we'll

561
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,250
occasionally, we'll like
shock you, Vacu, and it's,

562
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,720
is it 10,000 bolts? I don't, I don't,

563
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,660
or there's the difference between
voltage and wattage and I don't really

564
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:35,690
understand what it is, but one
will kill you in one won't. Um,

565
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:39,110
so this is supposedly the
stuff that won't kill you. Um,

566
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:44,060
but if you get hit and just the right
way and you're in water, I'm like,

567
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:45,530
I got hit so hard and like I,

568
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:49,700
my face smacked down through the water
and hit my head and then I like blacked

569
00:34:49,701 --> 00:34:51,410
out.
I started crawling the wrong way.

570
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:55,160
And now it's one of those things
that like once you like do like that,

571
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,410
like something like that happens to you.

572
00:34:57,411 --> 00:35:01,370
You just have like this insane fear of it,
you know?

573
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,320
And so it's the worst for me now.

574
00:35:03,321 --> 00:35:07,680
Like trying to pressure the
trepidation beforehand. Yeah,

575
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:11,880
the people who get injured or
even the fatalities. What are,

576
00:35:11,881 --> 00:35:13,530
what are the most common causes?

577
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:18,290
Honestly, I think the vast majority of
injuries are things like rolled ankles,

578
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:22,550
broken ankles. You saw what
you would expect. I mean,

579
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:26,000
I don't think they've never, and
the, and the, you know, the one,

580
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,150
the one unfortunate death that I think
that we know of that have occurred or

581
00:35:29,151 --> 00:35:33,710
deaths that have occurred have been like,
you know, heat, stroke, dehydration,

582
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:37,320
like the things that you would like
ultra marathon. Exactly. Exactly.

583
00:35:37,321 --> 00:35:42,321
It's not surprisingly for something that
is fraught with electricity and spears

584
00:35:43,621 --> 00:35:48,330
and you know, like climbing up super
tall things and crawling Barb wire,

585
00:35:48,331 --> 00:35:52,620
like nobody's like lost. And I don't
think from a Barb wire, you know,

586
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,090
so my buddy's got zapped in the eye with
one of those electric, uh, when, uh,

587
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,720
one of those electric lines, he was
not, he was not super happy about it.

588
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:00,211
Well,
I mean,

589
00:36:00,211 --> 00:36:04,890
the worst of the worst extent of my
injuries are really like my body is just

590
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:09,270
covered in barbed wire scars like
scratches. You can, I can show you them.

591
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:10,290
But you know,

592
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:14,380
I looked like I was attacked by a tiger
that was wondering what kind of cat you

593
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:18,840
had everywhere. Rope Burns, you know,

594
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:23,100
I'm never going to be a leg model.
50 shades of tough mudder. Yeah,

595
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:24,530
I've heard of,

596
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,630
uh, the, uh,

597
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,210
surgery. I want to talk about
your knee surgery. Yeah.

598
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:35,800
Why did you get knee surgery and uh,
let's start with that. What was the,

599
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:39,400
what was the reason for
the knee surgery? So I, um,

600
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:44,750
last summer heading into like world
champion seed Shep season ended up tearing

601
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:50,430
my meniscus and, um, it was in
training, it was in training.

602
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:53,610
It was like, I was like running in Chicago
and they're like, potholes everywhere.

603
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:54,361
And then the like one of those,

604
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:57,750
like free is one of those freak things
where you'd like step in something and

605
00:36:57,751 --> 00:37:01,440
you're like, ah, ah, my leg and I'm,

606
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:05,670
then I'm like running it off. I'm like,
oh wait, this actually isn't okay. Um,

607
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,140
and uh, so, you know, I went and I had
an MRI. I thought it was like, okay,

608
00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:14,280
but they're like my leg. I kept locking
and I had to like physically unlock it.

609
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:19,290
And so I think with certain meniscus
tears that happens. And so, um, they just,

610
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,150
they had to go in there and, um, you
know, shaved down the meniscus and then,

611
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:29,010
um, there were some like tibial
plateau fracture and whatever fancy.

612
00:37:29,011 --> 00:37:30,660
So I just had to stay off it for a bit.
Yeah.

613
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:35,250
When did, you said that happened? How
much long, how much later did you compete?

614
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,790
So,
so I raced again,

615
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:43,860
eight weeks post surgery.
Um, and I remember asking my

616
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:48,170
surgeon, this was the world's
toughest mudder, correct? 2014,

617
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,930
correct?
I did.

618
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,820
So I remember asking my
surgeon and I was like,

619
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:58,240
so how long until I'm back running? He
was like, maybe like four weeks and I go,

620
00:37:58,241 --> 00:38:03,190
so could I feasibly run our race like
eight weeks later? He's like, yeah.

621
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:05,980
And I was like,
how long of a race?

622
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:09,740
And cause he was like thinking like
I was going to run a five. Yeah.

623
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:15,070
I was like, why? It's like 24 hours.

624
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:20,940
It was just like, so I never got his
blessing for it, but I did anyway. So

625
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:22,650
what did you do,

626
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,893
uh,

627
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:28,450
between the, what steps did
you take to rehab it? I mean,

628
00:38:28,451 --> 00:38:29,920
what were the most important
things that you did?

629
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:34,870
I mean, I, I think most importantly
for me it was, it was getting into,

630
00:38:34,871 --> 00:38:37,210
I got into physical
therapy like the next day.

631
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:39,970
Like I had the best physical therapist
in Chicago and she was fantastic.

632
00:38:39,971 --> 00:38:42,280
She'd worked with me through other
injuries and things like that.

633
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:44,320
So we were pretty
aggressive and rehabbing it.

634
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,280
And then I just did whatever else I
could to work around it to stay in shape.

635
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:49,780
You know,
I think when people get injured,

636
00:38:49,781 --> 00:38:54,460
they forget that there's so much
that they still can do. So, um,

637
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,670
I had a gym that had a skier,
um, which if you've ever seen,

638
00:38:57,671 --> 00:39:02,560
it's like a rower turned upside down and
you pull it like you're cross country

639
00:39:02,561 --> 00:39:04,900
skiing. Um, so you know,

640
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:08,860
for two weeks that was the only like
really like thing I could do to like keep

641
00:39:08,861 --> 00:39:13,400
my heart rate up. Um, and
standby skier, hand bikes gear.

642
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:18,190
Um, I could row with one leg, but
then that kind of like throws.

643
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:22,390
Then my other leg was just getting
massive. Um, but you know, and I would do,

644
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,500
I like wrote a 10 K on
earth skier did 10 k,

645
00:39:26,501 --> 00:39:31,090
which is the worst kind of torture you
can like do to yourself, you know. Um,

646
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:35,170
and just finding another,
finding other ways to work around it.

647
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:40,310
What other rehab modalities did
you find most helpful personally?

648
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,003
Um,

649
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:47,670
did a lot of like stem for to kit cause
I think when you go in you do electrical

650
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:50,200
stimulation. Yeah. Um,

651
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,550
so when you go in and you like
cut open your knee or whatever,

652
00:39:54,551 --> 00:39:55,750
it shuts down your quad.

653
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,850
And so the main thing is getting your
quad to then come back and function again.

654
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:06,090
And so stem is really helpful and um,
you know like retraining that um,

655
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:10,690
to get it to fire. Um,
so that was, you know,

656
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:12,310
that was helpful.
Um,

657
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,640
I'm really like I'm a huge fan of
like art graston them with those

658
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,390
people and not from their air t active
release technique type of myofascial

659
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,253
release,

660
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:28,390
which is super depending on how you
have it done can be super unpleasant if

661
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:31,900
you're having like your, so as worked
on, Oh my God, I love that pain though.

662
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:34,100
I think it's like you like
having some like, yeah,

663
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:37,720
like therapist and with their like
ridge hand knuckle deep into your,

664
00:40:37,721 --> 00:40:40,390
so as I had, just as a
side note, all right,

665
00:40:40,391 --> 00:40:43,660
so I'm going to give a shout out to
this Guy Jesse Burdick who was a power

666
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:46,750
lifter who trains with a
friend of mine named Mark Bell.

667
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:50,050
I mean they do a lot of training
separately, but I think he pulls a, Jesse,

668
00:40:50,051 --> 00:40:51,080
I apologize if I get this wrong,

669
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:55,600
but maybe he can dead lift more and more
than 700 pounds. He's a big unit. Yeah.

670
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,330
And we were getting ready to do,
he also does manual therapies.

671
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,780
We're getting ready to do
an art session and the end.

672
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:04,690
So he puts me on a table and kind of
drapes like one leg off and he goes,

673
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:10,080
the safe word is brisket and then
just proceeds to annihilate my hips.

674
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,220
So the basic idea folks,
if for those of you don't know it,

675
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,310
they are t and please correct me if,
if I get this wrong,

676
00:41:15,311 --> 00:41:18,190
but if you have adhesions,

677
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,790
let's just say with scar tissue between
adjacent tissues you apply pressure,

678
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,970
manual pressure, a therapist applies
pressure between those tissues.

679
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:29,050
Then has you perform motions like an
overhead kind of reaching movement for the

680
00:41:29,051 --> 00:41:31,180
lads to break apart those adhesions.

681
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:36,940
Graston which is having really thick
butter knives scraped all over you. Right.

682
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:40,400
Uh, I read that you use
something and I'm embarrassed.

683
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:44,270
I actually don't know what this is.
Dry needling. Oh yeah. What is that?

684
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,300
Sounds terrible.
Apparently

685
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:48,820
legal in California,
which is why you probably don't know.

686
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:53,630
It's like acupuncture on crack.
Um,

687
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:58,470
so an acupuncture is actually rightfully,

688
00:41:58,471 --> 00:41:59,820
probably hate it cause I think they,

689
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,700
they think they think it's kind of
like a bastardization of what they do.

690
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,930
But so when you go and you get acupuncture
and the goal is like to not feel the

691
00:42:06,931 --> 00:42:08,460
needle dry needling,

692
00:42:08,461 --> 00:42:13,110
you actually are sticking the needle in
the muscle valley to try and get it to

693
00:42:13,111 --> 00:42:17,640
twitch. And the twitch
is like the release. So,

694
00:42:17,641 --> 00:42:20,280
um, it's like, and you don't
leave the needles in there,

695
00:42:20,281 --> 00:42:24,230
so you're basically like poking
at a muscle to try. Yeah.

696
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:29,020
And the worst ever don't ever let anybody
dry needle your calf, your gas struck.

697
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:33,240
Because like if you get in underneath
like right and like the hamstring

698
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:37,020
insertion, like you will feel like
you got shot in the back of your legs.

699
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:40,890
And it can also be kind
of addictive because like,

700
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:44,610
you have somebody like poking around your
group meet and you feel as twitch and

701
00:42:44,611 --> 00:42:49,050
it's almost like this like release of the
muscle. And what does it do for you? Um,

702
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,280
it's supposed to, you know,
for super tight muscles.

703
00:42:53,281 --> 00:42:57,870
The idea a really. Yeah. Huh. So, yeah,

704
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:01,900
I had the, I had this,
this nutty experience, uh,

705
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:06,610
and if people want to see photos of me
in excruciating pain getting art done by

706
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,490
Charles Poliquin, and you can
see that in the four hour body,

707
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:14,140
it's kind of hilarious. But the IDA
separate experience with something called,

708
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,270
uh, let's see. I guess
it would be called, uh,

709
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,190
I want to say neuro puncture,
but I might be getting that wrong.

710
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:26,910
This was done with Dr. Lee Wolfer many
years ago with shallow injections of

711
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:32,470
prolo solutions. So, yeah.
And what happened though,

712
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:37,060
and we improvised this point is she
was working on my infraspinatus.

713
00:43:37,061 --> 00:43:40,710
So this is a rotator cuff muscle that
at all that always gets sore for me.

714
00:43:40,711 --> 00:43:41,230
And I read it.

715
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:45,410
I had reconstructive shoulder surgery
and I probably sit like a collage,

716
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:48,990
like chest collapsed, uh, the, you know,

717
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,110
Gollum when I'm typing also,
which is no good. But, uh,

718
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,900
she was working on my infraspinatus
and she was doing the,

719
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:59,660
the kind of sewing machine approach with
these, these shallow injections. And,

720
00:43:59,661 --> 00:44:00,494
and we both here,

721
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:06,070
and it sounded like someone was
scraping ice off a windshield.

722
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:08,110
And it turned out that I had these,

723
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:13,140
these just this huge clump of calcium
deposits at the back of both shoulders and

724
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:18,460
shit. So we ended up just, well, we,
it's the royal we, she ended up, uh,

725
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:23,620
using the needle basically as a scraper
to kind of break down these calcium

726
00:44:23,621 --> 00:44:24,131
deposits.

727
00:44:24,131 --> 00:44:29,080
And what was fascinating is no shoulder
pain for months afterward after

728
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:33,180
chiseling these out wasn't the most
pleasant thing in the world. Uh,

729
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,920
so the dry needling, now that you're
here in California, no more sad,

730
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,840
sad times. No more
gluten meet posts. Yeah,

731
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:44,780
yeah. I go back to my lack of market dry
needling. Yeah. Well sometimes they'll,

732
00:44:44,781 --> 00:44:47,730
I'll get acupuncture done and I'm
going to be like, can you guys like,

733
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:51,710
and like they'll accidentally, a muscle
will trigger and release and I'm like, oh,

734
00:44:51,711 --> 00:44:56,690
that's fantastic dude. But
I'm honest people, I'm like,

735
00:44:56,691 --> 00:44:59,720
I'll try anything once. And in terms
of like recovery or like, you know,

736
00:44:59,721 --> 00:45:00,830
I'll just throw the,

737
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:06,560
especially because for most professional
athletes that they do, you know, they,

738
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:09,980
their job is like to be a professional
athlete and then to like Rehab and

739
00:45:09,981 --> 00:45:11,450
recover and spend all that time.

740
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,950
I'm like training early in the mornings
I go and I sit at a desk for 10 hours a

741
00:45:15,951 --> 00:45:18,320
day and then I like try and like
train and get in the evenings.

742
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,540
It's not an ideal,

743
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:25,580
like I'm not doing my body any favors for
like with what I'm putting it through.

744
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,270
What uh,

745
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:33,360
what, what is your
nutritional look like? Uh, and

746
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:39,400
then we were were were you serious earlier
when I asked you about breakfast? Hey,

747
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,470
we'll,
what was your answer?

748
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,950
And we were doing a sound check and I
asked her what she had for breakfast.

749
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,793
What was your hazard?

750
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:48,270
Uh, pop dot pop tarts. Um, no,

751
00:45:48,271 --> 00:45:53,271
that's actually the poptarts has become
kind of this like running joke in the

752
00:45:53,491 --> 00:45:56,790
obstacle racing community with me
because when I won the spartan race world

753
00:45:56,791 --> 00:45:59,850
championships in 2013 I was so far ahead,

754
00:45:59,851 --> 00:46:04,110
I was like 2030 minutes ahead of the
next woman and the race director yells at

755
00:46:04,111 --> 00:46:07,140
me, he goes, million, what'd you have
for breakfast this morning? And I'm like,

756
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:08,100
pop tarts.

757
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:12,840
And I actually did randomly that day
cause they're really good source of easy,

758
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:17,460
easy Millie, digestible carbs.
Billy. I said, what's that?

759
00:46:17,461 --> 00:46:19,790
You said or did you say your full
name? Sorry, I heard you say, sorry.

760
00:46:19,791 --> 00:46:24,420
You said it Amelia. Oh, okay.
Got It. Sometimes I can't
say my own name. Um, and uh,

761
00:46:24,421 --> 00:46:29,421
so it kind of became this thing that
like I would just like pre race ritual,

762
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:34,890
um, that would be like a good luck thing
to like a pop tart because I'm a soup,

763
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,970
I'm a really big person
into superstition and um,

764
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,690
it's kind of grown from there.
And now I see like I was at,

765
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,470
I was at a race the other weekend and
like everyone around me was eating pop

766
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:50,040
tarts.
What have I started?

767
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,390
Like what is it?
Everything,

768
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,400
like these pictures on Instagram of them
eating pop tarts and like they tag me

769
00:46:57,721 --> 00:47:01,320
in it. Yeah. And I'm like, Oh
my God, I've created a monster.

770
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:06,830
This actually could be an incredible
opportunity for you to do whatever you

771
00:47:06,831 --> 00:47:07,191
want.

772
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:10,160
Because I remember watching pumping
iron and Arnold Schwarzenegger's talking

773
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,740
about the guys would come up to him and
ask him for advice and he'd give them

774
00:47:12,741 --> 00:47:14,450
the wrong advices.
And he was like,

775
00:47:14,451 --> 00:47:18,230
tell them to go into the shower at the
gym and like scream all they're posing.

776
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:23,150
So you could, you could
actually, you could pull an
incredible April fool's joke,

777
00:47:23,151 --> 00:47:26,700
but announced it a year later after
everyone has already embraced it. I know.

778
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:30,550
So now I'm like, okay, well what's
the thing? Like what's the, you know,

779
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:35,500
what other superstitions do you have?
Um, not limited to racing necessarily.

780
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,910
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I'm one of those
people that, so it's the same,

781
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:45,250
like I will wear the same sports bra,
like,

782
00:47:45,251 --> 00:47:48,310
so we raised pretty much in like sports
bra and like compression shorts because

783
00:47:48,311 --> 00:47:52,540
you want as little clothing to
like cut down the mud as possible.

784
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:56,920
So I'll wear the same, you
know, if I did well in a race,

785
00:47:56,921 --> 00:47:59,340
like I'll wear the same outfit
for like the next race, um,

786
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:02,950
and especially at the same headband.
Um, and then if I don't do well,

787
00:48:02,951 --> 00:48:05,350
then that one gets discarded,
you know? And so it's,

788
00:48:05,351 --> 00:48:10,100
it's that kind of like your
typical, um, sports stuff. Um,

789
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,210
I actually have,
this is kind of embarrassing,

790
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:18,600
but a small little stuffed dog that
travels with me to all races and I'm,

791
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,310
because I'm typically by
myself and really cheap,

792
00:48:21,311 --> 00:48:25,960
sketchy hotels because these races
are like in the middle of nowhere. Um,

793
00:48:25,961 --> 00:48:30,340
so it's like my little guard dog.
And how big is the stuffed dog? Oh,

794
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:31,370
it's like fits in the palm.

795
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:38,580
Where did you get that? It was given
to me as again as a protection,

796
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,900
as a partisan.
The Guardian has a garden,

797
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:45,680
Doug. Um, so yeah, I mean it's,
it's just, it's, it's silly.

798
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:47,870
It's silly stuff like that.

799
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:53,190
I can be outside of pop tarts. Yeah.
What am I actually lead? Yeah. What is,

800
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:53,881
what is your,

801
00:48:53,881 --> 00:48:58,770
let's just say your four
weeks out from a race. Yeah.

802
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:01,500
What is your,
what does a day of food look like for you?

803
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,800
That's hard to say. Honestly. Like I,

804
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:07,740
it's one of those things I've struggled
with that I've, I've tried every,

805
00:49:07,741 --> 00:49:09,660
like I tried to do Paleo,
I tried to be like,

806
00:49:09,661 --> 00:49:14,130
maybe I can become a fat adapted athletes
because for longer races I didn't want

807
00:49:14,131 --> 00:49:16,850
to have to like rely on gels,

808
00:49:16,851 --> 00:49:19,950
gels and stuff like that
because after a while it can,

809
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:24,390
it can be too much in your stomach.
But I just never,

810
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:30,810
I'm never going to be the paradigm
of good eating of like an and um,

811
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:34,480
I couldn't, couldn't stick
with like, you know, um,

812
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:36,830
the whole like, you know, trying to,

813
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:39,750
I couldn't go far enough
into like the fat adaptation.

814
00:49:39,751 --> 00:49:44,020
Like it was just miserable. Um, I
like ice cream way too much. Um,

815
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,640
it's somewhat contra indicated
for Ketosis and adoption,

816
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:50,560
but much to my chagrin

817
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:55,790
boy, and I think I realize, I'm like,
you know, I'm, I'm performing well. Um,

818
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,720
I'm winning races.
So why change?

819
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:03,220
If it gets to the point where
I'm not doing well right then,

820
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:07,540
then I'll take another look at my diet
and, and switch it. But at this point,

821
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:11,650
it's like I run so much, I
put in so much, you know,

822
00:50:11,651 --> 00:50:16,340
time that I'm like, whatever. I
enjoy food and Ali, kind of whatever.

823
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:20,950
What do you consume during a 24 hours?

824
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,233
MMM.

825
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:26,460
What is your, and this is actually
a question from a fan. Yeah.

826
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:31,590
Which was how does your gear that you
bring with you differ in an obstacle

827
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:34,370
course race versus an ultra marathon?

828
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,780
Yeah. Instance. Yeah. Um,
aside from the wet suit.

829
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,520
So I think it really depends.
Um, if you're running, I've,

830
00:50:41,521 --> 00:50:46,470
as I've learned from like dabbling in
ultra marathons is that my body does it,

831
00:50:46,471 --> 00:50:48,030
especially if you're running hard.
I'm,

832
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:52,710
my body isn't going to handle solid food
as well as like the stomach will like

833
00:50:52,711 --> 00:50:56,670
stomach acid and stuff like that.
So there's a lot of like liquid,

834
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,100
like tailwind is a good,
you know,

835
00:50:59,101 --> 00:51:02,730
something that a lot of people use to like
that it's really easy on your stomach.

836
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:08,460
That's a good name. Yeah.
Yeah. Um, and, uh, so,

837
00:51:08,461 --> 00:51:12,270
but I also just find, you know, like
simple, I actually really love like, um,

838
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:17,070
like I like chewing on things like, like
cliff makes these blocks. So, you know,

839
00:51:17,071 --> 00:51:20,820
like I do, I take in simple
sugars that, that um,

840
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:23,340
like fuel me through that.
Um,

841
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:26,750
how often do you eat
during a 24 hour race?

842
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:28,653
Um,

843
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:33,030
I try and fuel every,

844
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:38,000
like I try and fuel every 30
minutes to hour, get something in,

845
00:51:38,001 --> 00:51:40,090
but little bits.
Um,

846
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,390
and then I'm telling you sometimes are
the best things during like a long race

847
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,130
are like,
Oh God,

848
00:51:45,131 --> 00:51:48,280
I had a Krispy Kreme doughnut during
world's toughest mudder this past year and

849
00:51:48,281 --> 00:51:52,910
it was like the most phenomenal thing
I never had. I'm salty things. Um,

850
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:56,590
you know, like you want to make
sure that you, you like, you, um,

851
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,030
your electrolytes are give you,

852
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:01,600
especially if you're running in a
wetsuit because you're losing, I mean,

853
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,920
you're losing summons.
It's such an incredible amount of fluids.

854
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:09,310
Yeah, I mean, so, um,
pickle juice, mustard,

855
00:52:09,311 --> 00:52:12,220
things like that. You carry that
with you, their stations regrowth.

856
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:16,600
That there are stations there are
imagining like a camel back full of pickle

857
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:20,770
juice. Well I actually do, I carry mustard
packets with me. I'm a small package.

858
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:25,450
So because vinegar is it if you ever
have issues with cramping, um, you know,

859
00:52:25,451 --> 00:52:29,170
they say that like the vinegar,
the salt and stuff like that.

860
00:52:29,171 --> 00:52:33,520
Can pickle juice as well known
to stop cramps in their tracks?

861
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,230
Um, his old yes. Yes. Was that
makes sense. Yeah, I mean it,

862
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:42,130
that's a pickle juice is harder to carry
with you is you have like a little vial

863
00:52:42,131 --> 00:52:46,210
or something like that. Um, but yeah, so,

864
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,780
um,
I think that for the longer the race gets,

865
00:52:49,781 --> 00:52:53,790
you obviously need more gear
and especially depending
on like the cold and the,

866
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,780
and the weather and what your
conditions are. Um, and so, you know,

867
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:00,940
sometimes it's,
it's pretty massive.

868
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,680
You mentioning electrolytes.
It's,

869
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:09,920
it's fascinating when you look at
sort of the record of health issues in

870
00:53:10,351 --> 00:53:11,310
endurance races,

871
00:53:11,311 --> 00:53:15,060
most people assume that a lot of
it would be related to dehydration,

872
00:53:15,061 --> 00:53:17,970
but oftentimes it's the complete
opposite where a lot of people,

873
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:20,430
the many people consume too much water.
And they get,

874
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:23,450
I guess hypernatremia yeah,
yeah.

875
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:27,300
Where are you dilute the sodium to the
extent that in some cases your heart

876
00:53:27,301 --> 00:53:30,360
stops functioning. Okay. And, uh, the,

877
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:35,361
I recall I was doing this Kettlebell
certification years ago and it was just

878
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:38,880
like thousands and thousands of swings
and whatnot outside, right. In Minnesota.

879
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:41,640
And people were getting horrible
cramps and they're like, oh,

880
00:53:41,641 --> 00:53:43,560
we're not drinking enough water and
heat shrink more. And I'm like, no,

881
00:53:43,561 --> 00:53:48,270
that's not the issue.
You need some potassium tablets and uh,

882
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:53,010
it's, uh, but God, that could just
be the worst if, I mean, do people,

883
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:57,030
I would imagine there must be
a fair number of competitors
who just have to drop

884
00:53:57,031 --> 00:54:01,340
out because they get it.
Quatre or hamstring cramps.

885
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:05,550
Zach cramps can be like super
debilitating. Um, and I think,

886
00:54:05,551 --> 00:54:08,380
and especially like in
really hot races and,

887
00:54:08,381 --> 00:54:12,960
and also I'm really cold races and
stuff like the extremes. Um, so that,

888
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:16,710
you know, it happens. It's the reason why
the longer the race is to get, you know,

889
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:21,630
like the more unknown and things
like that go into it. And so, um,

890
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:25,620
it can be, it's always kind of a crap
shoot, you know, like you're like,

891
00:54:25,621 --> 00:54:29,820
come on body, please cooperate with me
this one time. But sometimes you can't,

892
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:31,410
you can't predict it.
So

893
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:36,320
what, uh, what supplements
do you use on a daily basis?

894
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:40,500
Um, caffeine, no, I like coffee.

895
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:43,310
So I am actually really,
uh,

896
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:48,200
have really kind of bought the hype and
the science behind beets. Beets. Yeah. Um,

897
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:51,840
so I actually,
I work with a company called [inaudible],

898
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:56,660
which is it's powdered beat,
um, concentrated beet. Um,

899
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,510
and so it's really that like if you,

900
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:03,030
I remember the first time I ever had
beet juice, which just tastes like death.

901
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:07,170
I'm like, yeah, I mean I, some
people like beet juice, but I,

902
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:11,100
I can't handle it. But like you feel
this weird like head rush almost.

903
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:14,200
And so I was like, wow, there might
be something to this shit. Um,

904
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,730
so it's a,
so I am really,

905
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:20,010
it's something that I
actually like drink ever,

906
00:55:20,011 --> 00:55:22,410
like before workouts and
stuff like that and you know,

907
00:55:22,411 --> 00:55:26,280
delivers the nitric oxide to help the
breathing and everything like that. Um,

908
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,250
so I think for endurance athletes,
you don't need,

909
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:34,890
I don't need the massive dose of caffeine
before I go out, you know, and Ron,

910
00:55:34,891 --> 00:55:38,980
because he wants to be jittery while like,
you know, running for several hours. Um,

911
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,480
you need more of like the,
the,

912
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,700
like the help with the breathing and
keeping the heart rate low and stuff like

913
00:55:44,701 --> 00:55:48,570
that. Um, and then I
also take, um, you know,

914
00:55:48,571 --> 00:55:52,620
I try to stay away from
like antiinflammatories like
Advil and stuff like that,

915
00:55:52,621 --> 00:55:55,530
just because I, you know,
it's, it's hard on the body,

916
00:55:55,531 --> 00:56:00,180
but big believer on like
tumeric. Yup. Um, and uh,

917
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:02,220
other things like that.
Um,

918
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:06,690
then anything to try and help with
like bones and joints and, um,

919
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:10,410
so you've just taken her at like
glucosamine or MSM or what type stuff.

920
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:13,070
But I, I try and get a
natural, I'm like, uh,

921
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:18,290
like bone broth and gelatin and
things like that. Um, you know,

922
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,460
but it's bone broth as inexpensive habit
until I like bite the bullet and make

923
00:56:22,461 --> 00:56:26,860
my own. Then I have to like handle
chicken feed and not really into that. So

924
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,130
you're in a good place for the,
for the, for the bone broth.

925
00:56:30,131 --> 00:56:31,340
And I'm in the bay area.
I was like,

926
00:56:31,341 --> 00:56:34,510
it was the three stone hearth
I think in Berkeley. Yeah.

927
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:38,160
Further down the peninsula. You got
some really good sources as well, right?

928
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:42,270
Unfortunately, yeah. Hippies love
bone broth. Oh God. It's like the,

929
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,430
it's the new thing.
And for anybody in New York,

930
00:56:45,431 --> 00:56:49,240
I'll just give a shout out to a new,

931
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,060
I guess it's kind of a side Gig.
Started by a chef friend of mine,

932
00:56:52,061 --> 00:56:57,061
Marco Canora who was in the four hour
chef Brodo they serve hot bone broth in

933
00:56:58,571 --> 00:57:01,600
the winters in New York City,
Bro. D. Oh, it's amazing.

934
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:06,450
And you can get turmeric and or cumin.
You can get different flavored. Yeah.

935
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,540
You getting it. You can, you
can pay for the ad odds. Uh,

936
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:13,630
what is your prehab routine look like?
So the exercises,

937
00:57:13,631 --> 00:57:17,740
what exercises do you
do to prevent injuries?

938
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,760
Yeah, so the main injuries
that I've kind of dealt with,

939
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,920
I've always been kind of
revolving like hips, um, and uh,

940
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:30,560
uh, you know, glutes, leg, most
runners, glutes that don't fire. Um,

941
00:57:30,561 --> 00:57:35,510
so like the irony.
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Uh,

942
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:39,790
so, uh, like Jane Fonda's
are the, you know, the,

943
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:43,560
the gold standard. Um, but
it is, it's a lot of, um,

944
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:48,950
like kind of like stability work. Um, so
I try and do a lot of single leg stuff.

945
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,280
Um, what type of single leg stuff? Uh,

946
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:55,950
so single leg squats, you know, you
don't, you see like crossfitters,

947
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:57,690
do you like pistols all the way,
like asked to grab it.

948
00:57:57,691 --> 00:57:59,240
You don't need to do that kind of stuff.
You know,

949
00:57:59,241 --> 00:58:03,050
he's just like small little like,
you know,

950
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:07,880
mini single leg squats. Um, I try into,
like, whenever I'm standing around,

951
00:58:07,881 --> 00:58:12,380
I'm trying to like, just stand on one
leg, like balancing and things like that.

952
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:16,460
Um, I do a lot of like
band, you know, like the,

953
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:21,380
the physio band like walks, so like
monster walks, right? You're the ex walks.

954
00:58:21,381 --> 00:58:24,380
Yeah, the x walks. That's
that kind of staff. Um,

955
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:29,000
and then a lot of work, especially if as
a trail runner you really want to work.

956
00:58:29,001 --> 00:58:29,834
Like you're,

957
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:34,070
I'm going to say what is your transverse
abdominis or like the really deep core

958
00:58:34,071 --> 00:58:37,130
muscles muscle. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um,

959
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:41,150
so a lot of exercises that will
like engage that, um, you know,

960
00:58:41,151 --> 00:58:46,080
like bird dogs, um, and
uh, things like that. Just,

961
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,240
I mean,
they're there,

962
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:51,620
they're super like not fun
and little tiny movements,

963
00:58:51,621 --> 00:58:54,440
but I think most people would
rather go like, you know,

964
00:58:54,441 --> 00:58:57,610
squat 200 pounds and ignore those.
And that's not gonna help you.

965
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:59,660
So you're working on glue bead,

966
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,770
you're doing sort of ice
lateral or single leg movements.

967
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,830
Do you do step ups and he'd work on boxes?

968
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:11,740
I do. Um, I do too. I think.
I think and like lunges, um,

969
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:16,480
things like that. Uh, anything
that's requiring you to,

970
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:19,600
um, that is a required, yeah,

971
00:59:19,601 --> 00:59:22,100
that like unilateral movement too.
So.

972
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:26,490
And how much time would you say you spend
on those types of prehab movements on

973
00:59:26,491 --> 00:59:31,020
a weekly basis? It's probably about
15 to 20 minutes a day. 1520 days.

974
00:59:31,021 --> 00:59:34,450
Did you do that pre workout?
Is it a separate workout

975
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:39,290
or after it's generally like,
I'll do a few like activation.

976
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:40,640
Um, one, you know,

977
00:59:40,641 --> 00:59:45,360
like fire hydrants before and then after
it's generally afterwards at all kind

978
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:49,580
of devote 15, 20 minutes.
Um, to kind of that,

979
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:52,970
those like small little
strengthening baby exercises.

980
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:57,110
And how many miles on
average do you run per week?

981
00:59:57,790 --> 01:00:00,440
Yeah, it's changed a lot. Um, I used to,

982
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:03,890
a few years ago I actually didn't really
put in that much manager. I was like, uh,

983
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:06,830
you know, running too much is not
good for you or whatever. I did,

984
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:11,860
I switched my training from to be more
running intensive because I realized that

985
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:17,090
if you're going to run for 24 hours,
she probably should run you ever. Right,

986
01:00:17,091 --> 01:00:19,760
exactly. Cause I was just joking.
I'm like, I'm not a runner.

987
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:24,440
But then I realized that I actually,
I love running on trails and I love long,

988
01:00:24,441 --> 01:00:26,230
long runs. And so, um,

989
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:31,940
now I'm probably putting in
probably about 60, 70 miles a week,

990
01:00:31,941 --> 01:00:35,030
which actually is not
that much for a lot of UC,

991
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,520
a lot of runners who put in
like a hundred mile weeks, but

992
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:39,960
60, 70 miles away. Yeah.

993
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,960
How much time do you spend
doing other types of training,

994
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:47,060
like weight training or otherwise?

995
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:51,740
Yeah. Um, I do. So I used to,

996
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:53,540
I I do.
Um,

997
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:58,160
I generally will like crossfit
three to four days a week, um,

998
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:00,470
so,
you know,

999
01:01:00,471 --> 01:01:04,790
or some kind of bastardized
version of my own, um,

1000
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:08,930
if I'm not actually gonna make it
to a crossfit gym. Um, and to also,

1001
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,580
cause I kind of pick and choose
what I like to do from that. Uh,

1002
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:17,530
so I mean, I guess it would
be probably, I don't know,

1003
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:20,990
five to six other hours of
other strength training. Um,

1004
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:23,570
like interval training,
things like that.

1005
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:29,810
What does your morning
routine or routines look like?

1006
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:34,610
First, first 60 minutes of
your day you wake up? Yup.

1007
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:39,240
Punched the roosters and
make them crow for him.

1008
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,330
Uh, what happens? What is your,

1009
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,210
what does your day look like
between say four and five 30?

1010
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,710
Yeah. Um, I mean, I wish I could give
you an answer that's like, you know,

1011
01:01:48,711 --> 01:01:52,850
I go out and I do sun salutations. So
like breathing exercises or what? Well,

1012
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:56,660
the sun's not even out of that hour,
but it's nothing really.

1013
01:01:56,750 --> 01:02:01,100
It's nothing really that interesting.
I mean, I wake up, um, you know,

1014
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:03,720
I'll generally,
at that point,

1015
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:07,910
I'll actually typically answer some work
emails that since I go to bed pretty

1016
01:02:07,911 --> 01:02:12,500
early,
probably I try and get to bed by nine.

1017
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:16,820
So, um, sometimes I'll work emails
that'll come in like later than that.

1018
01:02:16,821 --> 01:02:20,350
So I'll answer those and I'm just,
you know,

1019
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:25,290
gathering everything up and heading out
to if I'm going to the gym that day or

1020
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:29,490
from hitting up the trails that
day. Um, so because I'll typically,

1021
01:02:29,491 --> 01:02:34,491
I'll train in the morning and then I'll
get ready and go straight into work and

1022
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:38,430
you get to work about seven 30 or so.
Um,

1023
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:43,230
and so if you eaten breakfast at
this point, are now, um, I will eat.

1024
01:02:43,231 --> 01:02:45,560
So Lee,
so I'll wake up the boards

1025
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,980
just race days. Um, and this morning,

1026
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,300
because this is the only thing that trunk
of my car as I was driving up here, um,

1027
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:58,620
high temp pop charts in the
trunk of my car. Um, but, uh,

1028
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,550
no. Also I'll generally wake up and, um,

1029
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:06,480
I actually typically eat a few spoonfuls
of like nut butter to fuel before I go

1030
01:03:06,481 --> 01:03:10,480
out for like, if I'm going to go
run, you know, 10, 15 miles. Um,

1031
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:13,760
it's a good source of, you
know, fuel to keep me going.

1032
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:17,130
She'll just have like a few tablespoons
of almond butter or something like that.

1033
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:21,920
Pretty much. Hmm. And
uh, and then, uh, yeah.

1034
01:03:21,921 --> 01:03:22,880
And I found out that,
you know,

1035
01:03:22,881 --> 01:03:26,150
it sits well and then I'll eat breakfast
after I train and then get to the

1036
01:03:26,151 --> 01:03:29,120
office, things like that. So what
does a non pop tart breakfast?

1037
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:33,800
Uh, generally, um,

1038
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:37,820
I'm a big fan of like omelets and eggs
and things like that in the morning. Um,

1039
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:40,610
mainly because I really like catch
up and I always put ketchup on it.

1040
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,740
It's just a vehicle for the
ketchup pretty much. I see.

1041
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:49,670
You sense a sugar theme going on here?
Let's see,

1042
01:03:49,671 --> 01:03:52,510
don't take diet advice from a million.
Okay.

1043
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:58,040
I want to just take a perhaps a
few of these fan questions. Yeah.

1044
01:03:58,041 --> 01:04:02,480
And we've hit on a number of them already,
but I didn't know I had fans.

1045
01:04:02,481 --> 01:04:06,710
But yes you did.
Unless they're all coming from Scott.

1046
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:10,880
Uh,
you have a lot of fans among my fans

1047
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:16,370
so that, this is a question that I'd be
interested to hear the answer to as well.

1048
01:04:16,371 --> 01:04:20,980
This is from Cindy, Paul Louis and
I'm probably masking that. What is,

1049
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:26,080
what is your self talk during training
and during the challenges sound like the

1050
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,420
moment when you want to quit?
No,

1051
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,840
just to head this off at the pass that it,

1052
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:38,200
the answer may be that you don't feel
like you want to quit but during it

1053
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:43,430
extremely hard races or challenging times.
What is your self talk?

1054
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:47,780
Yeah look like, cause I found like
many athletes and maybe not you,

1055
01:04:47,781 --> 01:04:52,730
but have sort of consistent routines
in terms of their self talk.

1056
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:54,401
What's interesting,

1057
01:04:54,401 --> 01:04:57,310
especially with the long races is that
you're always going to hit a low part.

1058
01:04:57,350 --> 01:04:58,160
It's like,

1059
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:03,040
and there's always going to be a part
where you want to quit, you know,

1060
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:06,490
24 hours at like,
and for me it generally comes early.

1061
01:05:06,491 --> 01:05:11,030
It's like four hours in and I'm like,
God, I gotta do this for 20 more. When he,

1062
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:16,090
um, you know, the sun setting and it's
getting cold, the wind's picking up,

1063
01:05:16,091 --> 01:05:19,930
there's a massive sandstorm,
whatever. Um, uh, for me,

1064
01:05:19,931 --> 01:05:24,400
I think I generally, it's hard because
people talk asked me about self talk.

1065
01:05:24,401 --> 01:05:28,840
I generally just shut my brain off and
I feel like that, that's what keeps,

1066
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:31,670
I don't, um, don't really
think about anything. Um,

1067
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:36,550
but I think when is that always
been the case? I think so.

1068
01:05:36,551 --> 01:05:39,040
I think that you just
will that into being.

1069
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:44,080
I think I just kind of go, I, I, well
I use different coping techniques.

1070
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:46,930
I sing to myself a lot when I'm out there.
Um,

1071
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:52,720
just tell me you sing out loud
sometimes. Yes. Yeah. If I have,

1072
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:57,710
if I'm not, if I have enough
breath, like, you know, um, so yeah,

1073
01:05:57,770 --> 01:05:59,050
you know,
there'll be like,

1074
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:02,590
there'll be like a certain song for
every race that we'll just kind of like

1075
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:05,410
replay it through my head. So, um,

1076
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,470
2012 world's toughest mudder
was Macklemore's thrift shop.

1077
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:13,360
It was like right before it hit big. No,
like right before it like busted out,

1078
01:06:13,361 --> 01:06:17,120
like, and I swear to God, I sing
that song over and over again.

1079
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:18,370
I can't listen to it the same way.

1080
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:25,890
What other songs is, so those like
your mantra was Macklemore? Yeah.

1081
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:29,790
It was like your meditative mantra.
Pretty much 24 hours. 24 hours.

1082
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:32,430
That's dedication of what
other songs have you used?

1083
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:35,850
Oh God, they range like
all over the place. Um,

1084
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:39,660
sometimes it's,
um,

1085
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:43,140
sometimes it's just like
all kind of like seeing,

1086
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:48,030
sometimes it will be like,
so my favorite hymn ever is,

1087
01:06:48,031 --> 01:06:50,940
I was raised Catholic and
whatever. And I love, you know,

1088
01:06:50,941 --> 01:06:55,850
I've always loved church music. Um,
so there's a Christmas Kong like low,

1089
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:58,380
how arose? Air Blooming.
And it's like an old hymn.

1090
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:02,730
So not at all what you would think
would be like running through my head,

1091
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:08,360
like running a race. Sometimes
it does, you know? Um,

1092
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:13,420
and uh, but then there's
other raise, it was Kanye.

1093
01:07:13,421 --> 01:07:17,970
It was like Kanye is monster was, or like
the song was called Monster, you know?

1094
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:18,863
So

1095
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,890
what do you do other racers do that
as well that you're aware of or do,

1096
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:28,350
do you, do any other top
racers have coping, uh,

1097
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:30,870
approaches that you think are interesting?

1098
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:36,400
Do you know? I think that

1099
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:41,740
a lot of people have like that self talk.
Like I've always tried to,

1100
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:43,300
and I think this is pretty common,

1101
01:07:43,301 --> 01:07:46,780
is that like a lot of us will try and
break up the race into small segments

1102
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:48,430
because if you look at the whole picture,

1103
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:50,680
it will get overwhelming if you're like,

1104
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:55,060
I have a hundred miles to run and you're
like crap, you know, but if you're like,

1105
01:07:55,061 --> 01:07:55,271
no,

1106
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:58,990
I only have three miles or I'm just going
to focus on getting through these next

1107
01:07:58,991 --> 01:07:59,890
10 minutes.

1108
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:04,330
And so I've always found that a lot of
people who do long endurance events,

1109
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:08,860
we'll break it up into small,
manageable chunks, you know,

1110
01:08:08,861 --> 01:08:11,470
and just focus on the next
few minutes ahead of them.

1111
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:13,540
And I think that works pretty well.

1112
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,240
Do you,
I mean,

1113
01:08:16,241 --> 01:08:20,020
it sounds like you probably have some
form of meditation when you run and I

1114
01:08:20,021 --> 01:08:22,210
think that in terms of just mindfulness,

1115
01:08:22,211 --> 01:08:25,900
I'm sure it's a very present
state or where to start with,

1116
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:28,210
but do you have a separate
meditative practice if anytime?

1117
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,130
I don't,
I've tried.

1118
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,160
I went to this like retreat
thing that was fantastic.

1119
01:08:34,161 --> 01:08:39,161
And I tried to do this meditation session
and I just like 20 minutes and I was

1120
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:42,530
like, I got it, move and do something
and they didn't get out of here.

1121
01:08:42,531 --> 01:08:45,950
So for me it's almost like
the meditation is like,

1122
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:51,290
is, is working really
hard. Like, you know,

1123
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:54,050
like sprinting or running
or lifting heavy weights.

1124
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,690
Like that's like my yoga practice,
you know?

1125
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:02,620
Uh, no. I don't know what this refers
to, but since we'll, Hicks is asking,

1126
01:09:02,621 --> 01:09:05,680
are you going to do the 24
hour battle Frog in March?

1127
01:09:05,681 --> 01:09:06,610
Does that mean anything to you?

1128
01:09:06,970 --> 01:09:09,550
It does, yes. It's a, it's a race.

1129
01:09:09,551 --> 01:09:14,370
It's another 24 hour a obstacle race.
You know, maybe, I don't know. My,

1130
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:18,370
my schedule next year is, is
kind of up in the air. I really,

1131
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:24,690
I really want to kind of like venture
and challenged like myself in new ways.

1132
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:29,620
And so I think I'm going to be doing
a lot more like pure trail races too,

1133
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:31,750
which I haven't really had a chance,

1134
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:36,400
especially without being out
here in California. Um, you
know, it's a much better,

1135
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,910
like I love climbing,
running up mountains and stuff like that.

1136
01:09:39,911 --> 01:09:44,740
So why did you decide to move to
California? Um, a variety of reasons.

1137
01:09:44,741 --> 01:09:48,150
I think the main was I, I'm from the
west coast, I want to get back here. Um,

1138
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:52,930
and then it was a time for a transition
and a career for me. Um, you know, uh,

1139
01:09:52,931 --> 01:09:56,950
I had been at a law firm for six years
and it was great and they were fantastic,

1140
01:09:56,951 --> 01:10:00,730
but kind of wanted to try
a new, like, you know,

1141
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:03,820
going in house and working,
working for a company there. And,

1142
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:07,180
and then I actually, I'll
be honest, it totally,

1143
01:10:07,181 --> 01:10:10,330
the training and having mountains and
hills around me, it was really hard.

1144
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:15,960
I am the happiest when I am out on a
mountain running around somewhere and I

1145
01:10:15,971 --> 01:10:17,880
couldn't do that in Chicago.
So

1146
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:22,410
are you able to disclose the
company that you're working for?

1147
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:24,630
The I uh, yes. Um,

1148
01:10:24,631 --> 01:10:29,490
so it's this tiny little company
you may have heard of it.

1149
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,880
Um, maybe not, I don't know.
I worked for apple. Yeah.

1150
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:36,890
It's a good company. I have, I have a lot
of, a lot of friends at the mothership.

1151
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:40,510
I just wanted to make sure they would
allow you to at least admit that you right

1152
01:10:40,511 --> 01:10:45,010
there on like my linkedin and
Facebook profile. It's public. Yeah.

1153
01:10:45,650 --> 01:10:50,450
Uh, this is a very racing
specific questions. Steven McKee.

1154
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:54,450
How do you keep your body limber after
ice or water immersion during a race?

1155
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:59,850
Keep moving. Just keep moving.
I mean, because, yeah, I don't,

1156
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,830
yeah.
Otherwise if you slow down,

1157
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:05,910
that's when your body temperature
goes down and then you're going to get

1158
01:11:05,911 --> 01:11:07,080
hypothermic.
So,

1159
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:12,870
so let's, let's, uh, let's
go to the third act. Okay.

1160
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:17,940
Which is rapid fire questions.
They don't have to be rapid fire answers,

1161
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:21,570
but the word successful,
and you hear the word successful.

1162
01:11:21,571 --> 01:11:23,160
Who's the first person who comes to mind

1163
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:27,060
and why it's so hard because,

1164
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:30,260
and this is going to be your typical
lawyer answer where I'm like, well,

1165
01:11:30,261 --> 01:11:33,830
because successful can have
so many different definitions.
No, that's fair though.

1166
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:37,130
But just, just, yeah, sort of reflexively.

1167
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:41,600
So this is going to be kind
of strange answer probably,

1168
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:46,630
but I always find people who have like
transitioned their careers throughout

1169
01:11:47,901 --> 01:11:50,990
their, who've had like, who've,

1170
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,950
I guess you have been flexible in their
careers and who have transitioned.

1171
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:59,330
This answer's not coming out right. Okay.
Here we go. I'm going to use an exam,

1172
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:00,530
do that all the time.
Don't worry.

1173
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:04,483
Um,

1174
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:05,491
Australian record,

1175
01:12:05,491 --> 01:12:10,491
like a 22nd intro for this little audio
book yesterday and it probably took me

1176
01:12:10,711 --> 01:12:11,544
47 ticks.

1177
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:13,290
Right.
Well,

1178
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:19,400
um, so the example, yeah.

1179
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:24,401
So I'm going to give you an example of
a person who I find successful and then

1180
01:12:24,921 --> 01:12:29,090
I'll explain why. Perfect.
Um, triple h, triple h.

1181
01:12:29,091 --> 01:12:33,530
So I am a huge wrestling fan, huge
professional wrestling fan. Um,

1182
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,890
and, uh, the reason why
I'm in using, I could use,

1183
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:40,190
I could use a number of
people as this example,

1184
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:45,430
but the reason that I'm going to use this
is because I find people who have had

1185
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:47,030
like one who,

1186
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:50,570
so he had a very successful wrestling
career but then transitioned into the

1187
01:12:50,571 --> 01:12:53,440
business aspect of it.
You find so many people on it.

1188
01:12:53,441 --> 01:12:55,790
This is interesting being in,

1189
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:59,620
I guess you could technically call me
kind of a professional athlete. Um,

1190
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:03,080
you see a lot of people who I find are
very kind of short sighted in that,

1191
01:13:03,290 --> 01:13:07,040
in that they're like, well, I,
you know, I'm racing now and that,

1192
01:13:07,070 --> 01:13:09,920
but they don't think about what happens
when they can no longer do that.

1193
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:15,460
So people who have been able to have
very successful athletic career and then

1194
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:21,410
transition to the business side of things
or to think far ahead, you know? Um,

1195
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:24,500
and so those are the people that I look
to that I'm like, you know, they have,

1196
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:26,630
they have everything,
they have the athletic side of it,

1197
01:13:26,631 --> 01:13:31,631
but then they also have the business
acumen and are smart enough to know that

1198
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:36,490
their body isn't going to
be there for them. You know,

1199
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:40,150
Oscar, Delaware, a good example
too with golden boy productions,

1200
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:43,800
right? Very savvy. I mean, if we want
to keep going professional wrestling,

1201
01:13:43,801 --> 01:13:45,360
you know, it's like the Rock, you know,

1202
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:49,470
like things have transitioned to being
an actor. It's done. All right, so true.

1203
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:54,010
Which is a great example of that. Uh,
so Paul avascular, really smart guy.

1204
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:58,930
I had him on the podcast a listen
to it. It just blew my mind. Really,

1205
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:00,250
really,
really savvy guy.

1206
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,700
Right, right. Okay. So triple h I,

1207
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,380
I agree. I also view him,
he works out at I think,

1208
01:14:07,381 --> 01:14:10,920
midnight every day with Joe to Franco.

1209
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:15,790
Like after his entire right. He
is very, he, you guys have, right?

1210
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:18,160
You have the OPP,
you have the opposite schedules,

1211
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:23,030
fan of routine and which I know
and I've heard him talk about too,

1212
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:26,480
and that's how I get by and like,
I don't care where I am in life,

1213
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:28,430
if I'm traveling,
if I'm on the road for work,

1214
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:32,930
like I'm going to create a routine there
and stick with it, you know? And so

1215
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:37,930
what is something that you believe
that other people think is insane

1216
01:14:42,450 --> 01:14:44,310
or any controversial
beliefs that you have?

1217
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:47,673
Interesting.

1218
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:52,460
And if nothing jumps to mind,
we can also come back to that,

1219
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:56,103
right?

1220
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:58,533
Hmm.

1221
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:03,340
Yeah. I may need to come back to that
one. Okay. We'll come back to that.

1222
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:07,660
What book or books have you
gifted most to other people?

1223
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,133
MMM,

1224
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:13,780
I'm going to butcher this author's
name because I always do. Um,

1225
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,260
house of leaves by marks. Um, Mark Daniel,

1226
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:22,130
Daniel Lew ski. Um, so,

1227
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:24,750
and the reason that I say this and that I,
um,

1228
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,180
and that I would give this is that so,

1229
01:15:26,181 --> 01:15:30,020
so many people now read on like kindles
or technology or things like that.

1230
01:15:30,021 --> 01:15:35,021
This is a book that you have to hold
because there are parts of it where you

1231
01:15:37,041 --> 01:15:39,380
need to turn it upside down to read it.

1232
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:44,060
And I forget the style of what is
called the style of writing. Um,

1233
01:15:44,061 --> 01:15:45,320
there's actual like Shondra for it,

1234
01:15:45,321 --> 01:15:50,321
but like there are certain pages where
you are reading it and it turns in a

1235
01:15:50,511 --> 01:15:52,220
circle.
So it's in like an entire,

1236
01:15:52,221 --> 01:15:55,820
I think that reading a book and you know,

1237
01:15:56,300 --> 01:16:01,010
holding the physical book and turning
the pages is such a lost art, you know?

1238
01:16:01,011 --> 01:16:02,570
And so there's something that,

1239
01:16:02,571 --> 01:16:05,960
this is a book that's like
an entire sensory experience.

1240
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:10,490
It's a fantastic story. It's brilliant.
It's kind of like a story within a story,

1241
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:15,820
but then it requires you as a reader
to be like active and involved,

1242
01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:16,341
you know?

1243
01:16:16,341 --> 01:16:21,210
And I think that's just so cool because
you don't see stuff like that anymore.

1244
01:16:21,230 --> 01:16:25,610
And especially now when people read
things on their iPads or their kindles or

1245
01:16:25,611 --> 01:16:26,650
whatever.
Um,

1246
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:31,910
and kind of like holding a book
is something that we no longer do.

1247
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:32,850
So

1248
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:37,140
House of leaves. Very cool. Do you have
any favorite documentaries or movies?

1249
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:42,720
Uh, my all time favorite movies.
The Goonies, the Goonies.
I mean, it's quality film.

1250
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:45,210
It's the quality. It's not, it's
not, it's not going to like,

1251
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:47,940
it's not life changing,
but you know, it's uh,

1252
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:52,860
any favorite character
from the Goonies? Um, data,

1253
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:57,450
data, data is great. And
just power. I mean, like,

1254
01:16:57,950 --> 01:17:02,750
yeah, I've grown up in Oregon and you just
had to like, that was, that was my jam.

1255
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,870
We didn't have much to claim being from
Oregon, but we could claim that movie.

1256
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:14,210
What is the, uh, purchase
that is most, uh,

1257
01:17:14,211 --> 01:17:17,480
for less than a hundred dollars
purchase of less than a hundred dollars.

1258
01:17:17,481 --> 01:17:22,370
It has most positively impacted
your life in recent memory.

1259
01:17:26,370 --> 01:17:31,320
Um, this is really funny. So menuca honey,

1260
01:17:31,321 --> 01:17:35,640
bandages and uh,
the,

1261
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:39,270
so I get banged up a lot.
Um, racing I've seen,

1262
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:43,160
yeah, there's some of the
photos that you sent me.

1263
01:17:43,161 --> 01:17:47,050
So before we do these interviews,
you know, I ask for short Bios,

1264
01:17:47,051 --> 01:17:51,920
some photos that might be a usable,
and I'm looking at one of them.

1265
01:17:51,921 --> 01:17:54,470
You're climbing up this red and
you're just covered in blood.

1266
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:57,950
So yes,
you get banged up.

1267
01:17:58,670 --> 01:18:02,360
So, um, this past summer I actually,

1268
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:06,740
there's this one obstacle called Shirleen
traverse where you basically called

1269
01:18:06,830 --> 01:18:09,380
tyrolean traverse. Prolean. Yeah.

1270
01:18:09,381 --> 01:18:11,990
So it's like you've seen like in the
military guys, they like it's a rope.

1271
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:15,800
Then you either go under it and
it's just a rope traverse. Yeah. Um,

1272
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:20,060
but you can also go on top of it. It saves
your crib. Um, and I decided one day,

1273
01:18:20,061 --> 01:18:21,350
one race to go on top of it,

1274
01:18:21,351 --> 01:18:26,351
saving my grip and I was wearing just
a sports bra and massive rope burn all

1275
01:18:26,811 --> 01:18:31,190
down the front of my, and like the
worst pain is like a second degree burn.

1276
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:35,900
And I discovered that the only thing that
would take away the steam where these

1277
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:39,860
like honey bandages and there's only
cvs was the only place that sold them.

1278
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:44,720
CVS has manuka honey bandages and the
only visit, or I can find him online too,

1279
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:47,270
and a sweater.

1280
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:50,790
It was the only thing that got me through
like the next few weeks in like no pay.

1281
01:18:50,791 --> 01:18:53,770
But now I use them all the time for
all of like my scrapes and it's,

1282
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:56,240
they're great, like antibacterial
and blah, blah, blah.

1283
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:58,850
I mean with a number that I bought,
I'm sure it's over.

1284
01:18:58,910 --> 01:19:01,390
I've spent way more than a
hundred dollars on them, but

1285
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:06,820
I knew Connie Benn and just cool. Uh, no,

1286
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:09,820
I usually ask about morning routines.
We already covered quite a bit of that.

1287
01:19:09,850 --> 01:19:13,930
What other routines or habits do you

1288
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:17,900
find important in your day or week?

1289
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:25,420
Um, I, it's very easy for me to,

1290
01:19:25,450 --> 01:19:29,620
or I think it's very easy for a lot of
people to get disconnected from, you know,

1291
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:33,730
people around and especially now in our
like social media type of world is that

1292
01:19:33,731 --> 01:19:37,870
like you, you know, like something
on Instagram or you know,

1293
01:19:37,871 --> 01:19:42,340
favorite something on Twitter or whatever,
whatever the things are that you do.

1294
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:44,740
Um, so it's very
important for me to, like,

1295
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:48,370
I always set a time every single week
and I called my parents like at the same

1296
01:19:48,371 --> 01:19:52,540
time and I called my sister
and, um, to try and make those,

1297
01:19:53,170 --> 01:19:54,760
those, um, you know,

1298
01:19:54,761 --> 01:19:58,960
personal connections and stuff like
that because it can be so impersonal now

1299
01:19:58,961 --> 01:20:01,420
with everything that we have,
you know,

1300
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:04,780
technology that you can be like friends
with people that you've never met in

1301
01:20:04,781 --> 01:20:05,614
real life.

1302
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:10,020
So I always try like me that routine
like every Sunday at the same time,

1303
01:20:10,021 --> 01:20:13,160
calling the parents, you know, just
kind of like keeping me grounded,

1304
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:14,063
things like that.

1305
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:18,070
Do you have any wind down routine?

1306
01:20:18,071 --> 01:20:21,610
What does the hour before bed look like?

1307
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:27,580
So I generally, um, okay,

1308
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,660
can't wait to hear this.
No, I was just like,

1309
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:37,030
I was just trying to think of like if I
actually had, cause generally I'll be, um,

1310
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:40,660
you know, watching Monday night
raw, um, some other fresh,

1311
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:45,110
I don't watch a lot of TV, but it's
either sports or professional wrestling.

1312
01:20:45,111 --> 01:20:49,190
When I do, um, you know, I,

1313
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:53,470
I am generally one of those people that's
like so tired by the time is I'm going

1314
01:20:53,471 --> 01:20:58,370
to go to bed. I don't really
need a routine. It's just
like, it's like, all right,

1315
01:20:58,371 --> 01:21:02,150
it's time to go to bed.
Oh, cool. Yeah. Got It.

1316
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:06,960
Uh,
if you could have a billboard anywhere,

1317
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,540
what would it say you put anything on it?

1318
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:12,603
Okay.

1319
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:19,990
I think I would say,
um,

1320
01:21:20,410 --> 01:21:24,550
I think it would be
something along the lines of,

1321
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:27,940
um,
no one owes you anything.

1322
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:33,850
And I think that this has been something
that lately I feel like there's such a

1323
01:21:33,851 --> 01:21:38,200
level of entitlement now
in people like that, that,

1324
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:43,000
oh, I, I deserve this, or I
blah, blah, blah, this. Um,

1325
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,900
and at the end of the day I'm
like, it's hard work. You know,

1326
01:21:46,930 --> 01:21:50,110
the people that I find the most
successful people that I think,

1327
01:21:50,111 --> 01:21:52,570
one thing that I've always
prided myself on is that like,

1328
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:57,610
I've worked really God damn hard
for everything that you know,

1329
01:21:57,790 --> 01:21:59,920
that I've gotten or that
I've done in my life.

1330
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:03,820
And you can't expect handouts from people,
you know, the, at the end of the day,

1331
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:08,440
all that you can,
that you can count on really is yourself.

1332
01:22:08,650 --> 01:22:13,510
And so like, I don't expect
people to give me anything. So,

1333
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,810
and I really wished like, you
know, so you see people now, like,

1334
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:21,070
I don't know the level of entitlement
that people think that they deserve a

1335
01:22:21,071 --> 01:22:25,240
handout or deserve help sometimes.
Sometimes I'm like, no, make it yourself.

1336
01:22:25,241 --> 01:22:27,020
Make your own opportunities,
you know?

1337
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:30,440
Yup. That's very pronounced
here in Silicon Valley too.

1338
01:22:33,670 --> 01:22:36,160
It's like, I know you just had a great
idea when you went to the bathroom,

1339
01:22:36,161 --> 01:22:41,070
but it's not worth $50 million yet.
I'm sorry. Exactly. Uh, so this,

1340
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:41,500
this is,

1341
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:44,560
this is not one of my normal rapid fire
questions and I'm sure I'm getting a lot

1342
01:22:44,561 --> 01:22:48,300
of grief for this from my fans,
but I have to ask because, uh, I,

1343
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:53,400
I know a lot of very successful
women CEOs and so on,

1344
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:58,840
uh, so 2012 second
place overall. Yeah. Uh,

1345
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:01,420
I mean you could, you could
have potentially, I mean it's,

1346
01:23:01,690 --> 01:23:03,850
well within the royal possibility
you could have won the whole thing.

1347
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:08,740
Do find it hard to date. Is
it, I mean, is it that I,

1348
01:23:08,741 --> 01:23:11,590
because I'm imagining if I
put myself in your shoes,

1349
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:16,390
it must be in, you're in, you're
extremely successful in your career.

1350
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:19,600
Is it hard for you to find someone
you respect enough to date?

1351
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:24,730
Because I mean then they're like the
mental, physical, emotional toughness.

1352
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:26,250
I don't spheres,

1353
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:28,750
so I don't think that it's so much me.

1354
01:23:31,870 --> 01:23:33,070
That's how it always starts.

1355
01:23:36,590 --> 01:23:39,110
No, I honestly, I,

1356
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:42,220
so I tend to be attracted to
people that are almost like,

1357
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:44,410
I don't want to say the
exact opposite then me,

1358
01:23:44,411 --> 01:23:46,630
because then that sounds like I'm
attracted to people who were like aren't

1359
01:23:46,631 --> 01:23:47,464
successful.

1360
01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:51,940
But what I found is that I need somebody
who's very complimentary to me in terms

1361
01:23:51,941 --> 01:23:53,950
of like very kind of,

1362
01:23:53,951 --> 01:23:58,951
I admire people that are super laid back
and go with the flow and very adaptable

1363
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:04,630
and just, you know,
everything that I'm not.

1364
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:08,200
And so I think that like for me,

1365
01:24:08,201 --> 01:24:12,370
it's not so hard to find people like
that. I think I though, you know,

1366
01:24:12,371 --> 01:24:14,770
sometimes you do get,
you'll hear, you know,

1367
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:17,800
it takes a certain type of
guy who can be secure with,

1368
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:21,910
with being with, you know,
a woman who, you know,

1369
01:24:21,911 --> 01:24:26,790
beats 99% of the dudes at like
a sport or whatever. Um, and,

1370
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:29,260
and that feels weird to say because
that feels like, I'm like being like,

1371
01:24:29,261 --> 01:24:33,550
look at me, I'm sending to the
facts are the facts. But um,

1372
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:34,930
you know,
it's,

1373
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:40,320
I think that it tastes actually a guy
who's very secure in his own right.

1374
01:24:41,471 --> 01:24:46,270
You know, you can't, I can't like date
somebody who's like, who's not, um,

1375
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:50,620
you know, secure in who he is because
then that would just be disastrous.

1376
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:55,280
It sound like it would get very far.
And then what,

1377
01:24:55,370 --> 01:25:00,370
what advice would you give your
25 year old self and place?

1378
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:07,910
Place us 20 and 25 I'd be
interested to get it for both ages.

1379
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:10,640
So wait, where were you? What
were you doing at 20 and then 25?

1380
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:15,210
So 20, I was finishing up college. Um,

1381
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:19,950
probably just getting ready to apply
to law school. Super, you know,

1382
01:25:19,951 --> 01:25:21,840
like hardcore driven,

1383
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:27,300
going to be partner in a law firm one
day, you know, like all those things. Um,

1384
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:33,480
I think at that time I would
tell myself to relax. Um,

1385
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:35,910
and uh,
you know,

1386
01:25:35,911 --> 01:25:40,530
that you can't predict where
life is going to take you.

1387
01:25:41,090 --> 01:25:45,690
Um, and because now looking at him like
would I ever expect that I'd be like the

1388
01:25:45,691 --> 01:25:48,740
world's top obstacle racer.
We didn't even know what the fuck off.

1389
01:25:48,741 --> 01:25:53,220
So where it wasn't even around at night
wasn't, you know, wasn't even a thing.

1390
01:25:53,730 --> 01:25:56,340
Um,
and uh,

1391
01:25:56,970 --> 01:26:01,620
so and I think at 25 I was finishing up
law school and I was starting my career

1392
01:26:01,621 --> 01:26:05,780
as an attorney. Um, so I
would probably be similar,

1393
01:26:05,781 --> 01:26:08,840
but I think what I would tell, I'm
actually going to give you, I would,

1394
01:26:08,841 --> 01:26:10,580
I would tell my 28 year old self,

1395
01:26:10,581 --> 01:26:14,900
which is when I started all
of this obstacle racing stuff.

1396
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:16,723
And

1397
01:26:17,650 --> 01:26:18,100
okay.

1398
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:23,020
I would tell myself it really doesn't
matter at the end of the day. Okay,

1399
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:28,120
that sounds bad, but like
don't take it so seriously.

1400
01:26:28,630 --> 01:26:33,570
Um, you know, and at the
end of the racing itself,

1401
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:34,710
the racing itself,

1402
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:39,300
because when you reach it started out
as totally fun and then you reach a

1403
01:26:39,301 --> 01:26:43,020
certain level of success and everyone
then it becomes this pressure and

1404
01:26:43,050 --> 01:26:44,040
everything like that.

1405
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:49,980
And I think that it's not
all of the stress and the
pressure and everything that

1406
01:26:49,981 --> 01:26:52,890
I would put on myself from
it. It's, it's not worth it.

1407
01:26:52,891 --> 01:26:57,780
It doesn't change the outcome. I'm either,
you know, ready or I'm not to like,

1408
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:01,440
you know, beat somebody. Um,
so at the end of the day,

1409
01:27:01,441 --> 01:27:06,240
kind of keep it all in
perspective and I'm like,

1410
01:27:06,241 --> 01:27:08,970
it's kind of hilarious.
I'm running around in the mud,

1411
01:27:08,971 --> 01:27:13,020
being shocked by electrical things like
running around for 24 hours in a wetsuit.

1412
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:16,770
Like, just keep that in
perspective, you know,

1413
01:27:16,771 --> 01:27:20,910
like it's kind of ludicrous
what I'm doing, you know,

1414
01:27:20,911 --> 01:27:23,500
so have fun with it.
You know,

1415
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:28,380
cause there's so much time that I think
that it wasted not like putting so much

1416
01:27:28,381 --> 01:27:29,640
pressure on myself and not having fun.

1417
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:33,210
And now I've kind of like
come full circle. I'm like,
ah, it's just fun. You know?

1418
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:36,880
Who would you,

1419
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:41,920
who is someone or who are people
you would like to meet some day

1420
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:45,633
if anywhere?

1421
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:50,010
God, I see that light list
is like massive. You know,

1422
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:52,210
who's, who's, who's up
at the top of the list?

1423
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:56,640
Ronda Rousey,
Ronda Rousey.

1424
01:27:57,810 --> 01:27:59,490
I like to me strong,

1425
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:04,620
I have an entire list like strong females
who are at like the top of what they

1426
01:28:04,621 --> 01:28:09,420
do. Um, she's on my list too. Right.
Um, but then I that also extends to,

1427
01:28:09,421 --> 01:28:14,250
you know, just other things
that are like not athletic,

1428
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:16,170
really inclined,
you know,

1429
01:28:16,171 --> 01:28:20,520
so you see like Sheryl Sandberg and like
that the females that have made names

1430
01:28:20,521 --> 01:28:25,440
for themselves and you know, as top
executives and things like that. Um,

1431
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:29,670
so I, I'm not like Rah Rah
girl power type of person.

1432
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:31,140
But you know,

1433
01:28:31,141 --> 01:28:34,860
finding other women like that and seeing
what makes an tech and seeing how they

1434
01:28:34,861 --> 01:28:37,830
survive is,
is always really interesting for me.

1435
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:45,720
What, if any, asks or requests
do you have for the audience?

1436
01:28:46,050 --> 01:28:50,370
And this is the, this is the
last question or request. Yeah.

1437
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:51,570
Anything you'd like them to do

1438
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:57,400
or think about or
consider or all the above.

1439
01:28:58,050 --> 01:29:01,020
Right. You know, I think, um,

1440
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:03,690
one of the things that
I've learned is like,

1441
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:07,980
and what I would tell people is like,
be open to experiences, you know,

1442
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:11,220
and especially with, they're
probably like sitting, oh, people,

1443
01:29:11,221 --> 01:29:15,480
if they're sitting here listening to this
are either already in obstacle course

1444
01:29:15,481 --> 01:29:19,320
racing and are like, man, this
shit's bananas. It's great. You know,

1445
01:29:19,321 --> 01:29:20,970
so I don't need to
convince them of anything.

1446
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:23,190
Or if they've happened
upon this and they're like,

1447
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:27,900
we don't understand what this
chick is doing. Actually. Um, like,

1448
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:33,000
I don't know. I would say go out there
and like, you know, try something new. Um,

1449
01:29:33,001 --> 01:29:36,290
and you know, so if that's off, if
you want to go out and run off score,

1450
01:29:36,291 --> 01:29:37,710
which of course like great,

1451
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:42,840
but I wouldn't be where
I am today without,

1452
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:46,820
you know, just like saying
sure. And trying something and,

1453
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:48,600
and seeing where that leaves me.

1454
01:29:48,601 --> 01:29:53,190
So I think that's always kind of important
to keep in mind. So try something new.

1455
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:58,260
Yeah, that's good advice. I'm
asking them to do something there.

1456
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:01,490
I think it's good. Good advice. I mean,

1457
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:05,270
do something just for the fuck
of it I think is kind of right.

1458
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,580
Coming back to your,
don't take it so seriously.

1459
01:30:07,581 --> 01:30:11,650
Like not everything has to
figure into your five year plan.

1460
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:12,653
And I think that's hard

1461
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:16,670
because for me it's like I've always
been not like super plan or five year

1462
01:30:16,671 --> 01:30:19,910
person. So it was something that I
actually have to remind myself. It's like,

1463
01:30:19,911 --> 01:30:22,700
try something new, Amelia.
Like just do it. Yeah, why not

1464
01:30:22,930 --> 01:30:26,230
do it. That was, that was one
of my, I call it a resolution,

1465
01:30:26,231 --> 01:30:27,580
so it wasn't a new year's resolution,

1466
01:30:27,581 --> 01:30:32,500
but when I've done did a lot of
unusual experiments last year, uh,

1467
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:36,030
we won't get into right now,
but one of the,

1468
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:38,710
one of the realizations was be playful.

1469
01:30:38,740 --> 01:30:42,310
Like you don't have to be so God damn
serious about things all the time.

1470
01:30:42,311 --> 01:30:47,311
I mean the psych do something that doesn't
have an explicit point or an angle or

1471
01:30:47,501 --> 01:30:48,590
whatever it might be.
Right?

1472
01:30:48,830 --> 01:30:51,130
Yeah. If somebody told
me the other day, um,

1473
01:30:51,650 --> 01:30:55,580
that the only thing at the end of the day,
the only thing we have is time.

1474
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:59,480
If you really cut through all the bullshit
out there and like this is funny when

1475
01:30:59,481 --> 01:31:02,510
you asked me about like who do
you think is successful? I'm

1476
01:31:04,310 --> 01:31:05,780
like,
seriously,

1477
01:31:05,781 --> 01:31:09,050
I think the most successful people who
are out there are people that are happy

1478
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:11,490
that are just like,
they may not have it all,

1479
01:31:11,510 --> 01:31:14,630
they may be dirt poor or they may
not be educated, they may, whatever.

1480
01:31:14,810 --> 01:31:18,830
But if they can art everyday life
smiling and just generally happy.

1481
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:23,090
Like when, if you break it
all down, all we have is time.

1482
01:31:23,390 --> 01:31:24,920
So why spend it been miserable?

1483
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:29,390
So like go do something that
makes you happy and like,

1484
01:31:29,930 --> 01:31:33,700
and have fun with it because
you're not taking it with you.

1485
01:31:34,430 --> 01:31:38,690
That's your, your, your most valuable
non renewable resource. Exactly.

1486
01:31:38,691 --> 01:31:39,524
As far as we know,

1487
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:45,200
when the my time finally comes and I
realize that there's like a super cool

1488
01:31:45,201 --> 01:31:47,810
world on the other side, I'm
going to be like, God dammit.

1489
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:51,290
Well Amelia,

1490
01:31:51,291 --> 01:31:55,490
thanks so much for taking the time
and work working people say hello,

1491
01:31:55,491 --> 01:31:58,010
find you on the interwebs and so on.

1492
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:02,680
Uh,
my grossly needs updating website,

1493
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:07,030
[inaudible] dot com. Um, but I
actually am most active on, um,

1494
01:32:08,050 --> 01:32:12,080
Twitter. Uh, it's just the
handles Amelia Boone. Um hmm.

1495
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:16,210
It's funny what Buddhists, any,
any at the end? Emilia Boon.

1496
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:17,850
B. O. N. E. Correct.

1497
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:21,180
Um,
but you fair for Warren?

1498
01:32:21,181 --> 01:32:24,540
I tweet a fair amount about the
Seahawks and professional wrestling.

1499
01:32:24,541 --> 01:32:27,840
So if you're not into that, you
probably don't want to follow me. Um,

1500
01:32:28,770 --> 01:32:31,950
and uh,
then I'm on Instagram as well.

1501
01:32:31,951 --> 01:32:34,140
It's a a our Boone 11,

1502
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:39,120
because Emily Boone was already taken
by the time I joined that a are been 11.

1503
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:43,860
Correct. Um, and I'm on Facebook. Um,

1504
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:47,550
I don't have an athlete page because I
don't really like that or believe in that,

1505
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:51,840
but you can follow me but I don't really
become friends with people I haven't

1506
01:32:51,841 --> 01:32:55,470
met before in life cause that
weirds me out. So Twitter,

1507
01:32:56,100 --> 01:33:00,350
so Twitter and Instagram are your
best friend. Instagram. Cool.

1508
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:01,550
Well this has been a blast.

1509
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:06,720
Everybody listening we will link
to the books and so on the Menuca,

1510
01:33:07,151 --> 01:33:09,850
honey,
bandages and whatnot,

1511
01:33:09,851 --> 01:33:13,190
everything mentioned in the show notes
and you can just go to four hour work,

1512

podcast and that will have all episodes

1513
01:33:17,291 --> 01:33:21,040
including this one. And I'll
create just a short, a short link.

1514
01:33:21,041 --> 01:33:23,380
You can go to ourself short link,

1516
01:33:26,681 --> 01:33:29,410

And [inaudible] once again,

1517
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:32,910
thank you so much for
taking the time. And, uh,

1518
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:34,390
I would say let's go for a run sometime,

1519
01:33:34,391 --> 01:33:37,900
but I have some training to do before
I'm prepared for that and to everybody

1520
01:33:37,901 --> 01:33:39,430
listening,
as always.

1521
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:42,100
Thank you so much for sticking
around and we'll see you soon.

1522
01:33:48,610 --> 01:33:51,980
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

1523
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:54,950
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

1524
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:58,250
Do you want to get a short email from me?

1525
01:33:58,251 --> 01:34:02,390
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

1526
01:34:02,391 --> 01:34:05,930
little more soul of fun before the
weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

1527
01:34:05,931 --> 01:34:10,280
short email where I share the coolest
things I've found or that I've been

1528
01:34:10,281 --> 01:34:11,780
pondering over the week.

1529
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:14,570
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

1530
01:34:14,571 --> 01:34:18,020
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

1531
01:34:18,021 --> 01:34:22,340
somehow dug up in the, uh, the
world of the esoteric as I do.

1532
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:27,640
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

1533
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:31,010
close friends, for instance.
And it's very short.

1534
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:36,080
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

is brought to you by 99 designs when
your business needs a logo, website,

1541
01:34:56,550 --> 01:35:00,680
business thumbnail, or any other design.
I recommend checking out 99 designs.

1542
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:03,200
I use them myself.
I've used them for many years.

1543
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:06,860
I used them to create book cover
prototypes for the four hour body,

1544
01:35:06,861 --> 01:35:09,230
which went on to becoming number
one New York Times bestseller.

1545
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:13,490
I've also used them for
banner ads, illustrations, and

Tim

1553
01:35:44,930 --> 01:35:48,950
this episode is brought to
you by Wealthfront and this
is a very unique sponsor.

1554
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:53,750
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive
in a good way, set it and forget it.

1555
01:35:53,751 --> 01:35:58,100
Investing service led by technologists
from places like apple and world famous

1556
01:35:58,101 --> 01:35:58,850
investors.

1557
01:35:58,850 --> 01:36:02,540
It has exploded in popularity in the last
two years and they now have more than

1558
01:36:02,541 --> 01:36:05,540
two and a half billion dollars
under management. In fact,

1559
01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:06,920
some of my very good friends,

1560
01:36:06,950 --> 01:36:10,100
investors in silicon valley have millions
of their own money in Wealthfront.

1561
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:13,190
So the question is why? Why is
it so popular? Why is it unique?

1562
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:17,030
Because you can get services previously
reserved for the ultra wealthy,

1563
01:36:17,031 --> 01:36:19,430
but only pay pennies
on the dollar for them.

1564
01:36:19,970 --> 01:36:23,210
And this is because they use smarter
software instead of retail locations,

1565
01:36:23,211 --> 01:36:25,940
bloated sales teams, et cetera. And
I'll come back to that in a second.

1566
01:36:26,450 --> 01:36:31,100
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com
forward slash Tim take the risk

1567
01:36:31,101 --> 01:36:34,370
assessment quiz which only takes two to
five minutes and they'll show you for

1568
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:38,180
free exactly the portfolio they'd put
you in and if you just want to take their

1569
01:36:38,181 --> 01:36:42,080
advice, run with it, do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

1570
01:36:42,081 --> 01:36:43,940
you can set it and forget it.
Here's why.

1571
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:48,290
The value of Wealthfront is in the
automation of habits and strategies that

1572
01:36:48,291 --> 01:36:51,710
investors should be using on a
regular basis but normally aren't.

1573
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:54,350
Great investing is a marathon,
not a sprint,

1574
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:58,040
and little things that you may or may
not be familiar with like automatic tax

1575
01:36:58,041 --> 01:37:00,200
loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

1576
01:37:00,350 --> 01:37:04,670
cross more than 10 asset classes and
dividend reinvestment add up to very large

1577
01:37:04,671 --> 01:37:08,390
amounts of money over longer periods
of time. Wealthfront, as I mentioned,

1578
01:37:08,391 --> 01:37:11,000
since it's using software
instead of retail locations,

1579
01:37:11,010 --> 01:37:15,170
etc. Can offer all of this at low
costs that were previously completely

1580
01:37:15,171 --> 01:37:16,700
impossible right off the bat,

1581
01:37:16,850 --> 01:37:19,220
you never pay commissions or
account fees for everything.

1582
01:37:19,221 --> 01:37:24,221
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above
the first 15,000 which is managed for

1583
01:37:24,861 --> 01:37:28,550
free. If you use my link,
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim,

1584
01:37:28,850 --> 01:37:33,680
that is less than $5 a month to invest
a $30,000 account for instance. Now,

1585
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:35,300
normally when I have a
sponsor on this show,

1586
01:37:35,301 --> 01:37:38,870
it's because I use them and
recommend them. In this case,
it's a little different.

1587
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:43,160
I don't use wealth front yet because
I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal.

1588
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:47,420
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of SCC regulations,

1589
01:37:47,630 --> 01:37:51,110
companies that invest your money are
not allowed to use client testimonials.

1590
01:37:51,111 --> 01:37:53,900
So I couldn't be a user and
have them on the podcast.

1591
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:58,020
But I've been so impressed by Wealthfront
that I've invested a significant

1592
01:37:58,021 --> 01:38:01,890
amount of my own money, at least for me,
uh, in the team and the company itself.

1593
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:04,980
So I am an investor and hope
to soon use it as a client.

1594
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:08,550
Now back to the recommendation
as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

1595
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:12,390
you'll get $15,000 managed for free
if you decide to open an account.

1596
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:15,420
But just start with seeing the portfolio
that they would suggest for you.

1597
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:19,590
Take two minutes, fill out their
questionnaire@wealthfront.com
forward slash. Tim,

1598
01:38:19,890 --> 01:38:23,280
it's fast. It's free. There's no
downside that I can think of. Now,

1599
01:38:23,281 --> 01:38:25,260
I do have to read a mandatory disclaimer.

1600
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:29,130

1605
01:38:40,291 --> 01:38:44,100
most innovative companies coming out of
Silicon Valley, and they're killing it.

1606
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:47,130
They've become massively popular.

1607
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:49,080

would create for you,

01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:51,030

information however you want.
