00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,650
This podcast is brought
to you by Mizzen and main.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,470
Don't worry about the spelling.
All you need to know is this.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:10,630
I have organized my entire life around
avoiding fancy shirts because you have to

4
00:00:10,631 --> 00:00:14,860
iron them. You sweat through
them, they smell really easily.

5
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:16,030
They're a pain in the ass.

6
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:20,440
Mizzen and main has given me
the only shirt that I need.

7
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:23,380
And what I mean by that and Kelly
Starr at loves these shirts as well,

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,630
is that you can trick people,

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,380
they look really fancy so you can take
them out to nice dinners, whatever,

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,560
but they're made from athletics,
sweat wicking material.

11
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,520
So you can throw this thing into your
luggage in a heap or on your kitchen table

12
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:40,600
like I did recently and then pull it out,
throw it on with no ironing,

13
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:42,040
no steaming,
no nothing.

14
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,300
Walk out and you could probably wear
this thing for a week straight or make it

15
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:50,770
your only dress shirt and take it on
trips for weeks at a time. Never wash it.

16
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:52,870
It will not smell.
You will not sweat through it.

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,280
You got to check these things out.

21

22
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,490
This episode is brought to you by 99
designs or one stop shop for all things

23
00:01:12,491 --> 00:01:14,050
graphic design related.

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,060
I've used 99 designs for everything
from banner ads to book covers,

25
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:22,780
including sketches and mock ups
that led to the four hour body,

26
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:26,770
which later became number one New York
Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,611
the brainstorming.

28
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:30,940
A lot of it took place with designers
from around the world and here's how it

29
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:35,140
works. Whether you need a t
shirt, a business card, a website,

30
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,690
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

31
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,440
you submit that project and
designers from around the world.

32
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,110
We'll send you sketches
and mock ups and designs.

33
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,770
You choose your favorite and you have an
original that you love or you get your

34
00:01:47,771 --> 00:01:49,480
money back.
It's that straight forward.

35
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,170
And many of you who are listening have
already used it and created some amazing

36
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:55,570
things that I'll be sharing in the future.
But in the meantime,

37

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,920
I'm a cybernetic organism.
Living does show what method.

43
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,130
Hello Ladies and germs.

44
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:36,430
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

45
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:40,660
I deconstruct world class experts,
whether they be chess prodigies,

46
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,730
incredible billionaire investors,

47
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:45,760
celebrities like Arnold
Schwarzenegger or in this case,

48
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,500
one of the most capable and notorious
computer hackers on the planet who happens

49
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:55,360
to also be a good buddy of mine,
Sammy Kamkar. He is a beast.

50
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,270
He's also a well known whistle
blower and entrepreneur.

51
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,780
So we could start with what he's
probably best known for her,

52
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:05,230
which is creating and releasing the
fastest spreading virus of all time,

53
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:09,100
which was the,
my space worm called aptly enough Sammy.

54
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,670
And of course he was subsequently raided
for it by the United States secret

55
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:15,970
service. Yes, he was prevented from
touching computers for three years,

56
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,240
but he's also done many other things.
He created skyjack,

57
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:24,270
which is a custom drone that can hack
into other nearby parrot drones and uh,

58
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,050
basically create a swarm of drones
that someone like Sammy can control

59
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:32,380
completely. Uh, he's also
known for creating ever cookie,

60
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:35,680
which appeared in top secret NSA
documents revealed by Edward Snowden.

61
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,800
And he has also spotted some what
you might consider bad behavior.

62
00:03:39,801 --> 00:03:44,050
So He'd discovered elicit mobile phone
tracking where apple and the case of the

63
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:47,440
iPhone, Google, android and
Microsoft windows phones,

64
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,650
we're transmitting gps and Wifi
information to their parent companies.

65
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,060
And his research on this has led to a
series of class action lawsuits against

66
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:57,520
the companies and a privacy
hearing on Capitol Hill.

67
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:02,430
So he is a controversial figure and
for those interested after this, uh,

68
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,710
interview in delving more into a
lot of what I've done with Sammy,

69
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:11,070
he is one of the experts that I relied
on in the dating game episode of the Tim

70
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,450
Ferriss Experiment, which is the number
one TV season on iTunes. As I record this,

71
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,400
he helped me to hack my online dating
and test a bunch of things that seemed

72
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:24,670
ridiculous and ended up working and of
course we had Neil Strauss of the game

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,460
and a high end matchmaker and
other people that we tested.

74
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,620

84
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,680
So without further ado, I want you
to enjoy the very thought provoking,

85
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:10,540
terrifying and instructive
conversation with Sammy Kamkar.

86
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,080
Sammy, tell welcome to the
show. Thank you. Awesome.

87
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,780
It is so great to see you again.

88
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:24,760
It has been awhile since our
adventures and TV land and,

89
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,570
and I wanted to,

90
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,630
I've wanted to introduce you to my fans
and this audience for so long already

91
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,900
and I think a great way to do that is to
explain a few things that are right in

92
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:38,720
front of me. So you haven't, you
have a necklace on? Yes, I do.

93
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,260
Can you explain what is on your necklace
and I hadn't seen this before today.

94
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,930
Sure, sure. Um, so this is something,
uh, it's actually a microcontroller,

95
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,620
so it's basically a little mini
computer that sits around my neck, um,

96
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,370
that I've programmed to into
something that I call a USB drive by.

97
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:00,110
And basically what Usb by is is it's
something that I wear around my neck

98
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:02,270
obviously,
and any computer,

99
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:05,780
I plugged this into it
within about two seconds,

100
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,000
takes it over forever.
Um,

101
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,310
essentially if you've ever plugged
in the keyboard into your computer,

102
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:13,010
you know that you can just
start typing keys. Well,

103
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,310
the awesome thing about computers are
that and keyboards that you can do

104
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:19,940
anything from a keyboard.
You can open windows or Osx.

105
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:23,870
You can open like a spotlight or start
menu and start typing. You can say,

106
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:28,490
open a terminal, go into the network
preferences, make all my network traffic,

107
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:31,580
go to another server.
So now if you plug this in,

108
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,630
all of your Internet traffic,
whatever website you go to,

109
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:39,680
any email you check goes through my
computer so I can see where you're doing,

110
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:42,800
where you're going. Um,
additionally, it evades a firewall.

111
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,660
There's like a firewall
where it actually asks,

112
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,000
do you want to allow this
connection to this random servers,

113
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:50,900
sammy.pl that you've never heard of?
Well, you thanks to this firewall,

114
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:54,710
you can just hit enter right to hit
the accept button. So it's like, oh,

115
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:58,850
I'm just going to hit accept. And this
thing is, you know, it's like two inches,

116
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,420
two inches by the interesting,

117
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,070
barely even notice it as
anything other than decorative.

118
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:07,700
But of course you're not a steam
punk burner. Last I checked.

119
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,930
So it actually has a function. Right,
right. So I've, I've, you know,

120
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,460
I've actually made a video on this.

121
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:16,670
I've released an entirely open source
for anyone to see how it works,

122
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:17,690
actually use it.

123
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,570
And the idea is not to actually be
malicious and uses against people,

124
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:24,630
but to demonstrate sort of the flaws
that exist in our every day computers in

125
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,800
system like USB that have existed for
years and years and years and that we

126
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:30,620
don't really think about it. Yeah.
I've, you know, and uh, there's,

127
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:34,820
there's another toy I want to get to in
a second. And which also blew my mind, a,

128
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,910
although didn't entirely surprise me
given the conversations we've had in the

129
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:40,070
past, but, uh, I,

130
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,670
I at one point was chatting with a former
intelligence officer for think it was

131
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:49,220
[inaudible] and he now does private
security in a silicon valley.

132
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,040
And other places and he said that if you,

133
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:57,020
if you were to go to say a Facebook
or a company like that and drop off

134
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,520
malicious USB drives that were branded
with the company logo on them and just

135
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:04,190
drop them in the lobby where
people check in that you know,

136
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:08,350
75 to 80% of them will get picked up
and plugged into a computer. Oh sure.

137
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,530
On campus somewhere. But yeah, it
seems like a high percentage, but I,

138
00:08:11,531 --> 00:08:13,490
I believe that,
I mean man,

139
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,380
the problem is you'll plug in, I'll
plug in almost anything. Right.

140
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,260
The lobby is key because you also get
visitors who think they're getting,

141
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,350
they found something valuable.
Oh,

142
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,480
all the dignitaries. Oops.
Yeah, there's a couple,

143
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,690
there's a couple of music artists,
you know,

144
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:32,270
I love going to shows and then there's
a couple of artists I think like

145
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,810
Bassnectar is thrown out to USB
sticks, which I think is great, right.

146
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,380
With like unreleased music and I just
want to go to Coachella and just throw

147
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:40,214
these things out

148
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,850
to dry by USB cheeses.
Sammy, you terrify me,

149
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,530
but you also delight me. Tell me, tell
me about this. This other toy is a toy,

150
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:56,430
right? This is a toy. I mean,
it's not a toy. It's a toy.
It was a toy. It was a toy.

151
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,820
Okay. So this is, uh, you know, I haven't
released any of this stuff out yet.

152
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,800
And where can people find the video? Just
to backtrack for a second. Sure, sure. Um,

153
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,820
my website has everything. So
samy.pl, that's s a m y. Dot. P L

154
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,870
and I will link to all these things in
the show notes as well for everybody.

155
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,410
So this is called the Mattel.
I am me.

156
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,750
This is a product for essentially
tweens and it's this pink,

157
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,750
you know, it was, I call it,
I think it's Fuchsia, but, uh,

158
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:30,000
it says girl tech on it and you can
essentially text your friends and it's

159
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,190
Mattel, you know, came out
with this many years ago.

160
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:37,050
So that sort of teen kids could
text their friends, um, without,

161
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,220
you know, finding, you know,

162
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:41,940
running into the wrong thing creeps and
the wrong people restrict it to who you

163
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:42,774
can communicate with.

164
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,800
But it happens to have a really cool
wireless chip that a couple other people

165
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:49,320
out there, I'm Mike Lawson
and a few other people have,

166
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:52,800
have found that this wireless chip
is actually really, really powerful,

167
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,290
much more powerful than
texting teenage girls. Um,

168
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:01,370
it's actually able to listen and
transmit on a wide number of frequencies,

169
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,960
including some things that
I found recently, like a
ton of almost all garages,

170
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,580
a high end luxury vehicles.
If you ever used,

171
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,470
let's say a remote, you know,
a lot of cars these days,

172
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,370
you hit a remote town like your
car less. Exactly. Yeah. Um,

173
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,960
so that's all with radio frequency and
normally that's supposed to be encrypted

174
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:26,280
or at least it's felt to be really hard.

175
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:31,170
And the thing about security that I've
learned over time is that if we don't see

176
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:35,620
it, we just assume it's safe. Right?
If you can't see it right away,

177
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,150
if it's not an open door to your house,
right.

178
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,290
As long as you don't know
what's happening. This is kind
of, and I mean, it's true.

179
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:47,280
Ignorance is bliss, but not until
someone steals your car. Uh,

180
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,830
so this is something that
I've been working on too,

181
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,090
and that's something I've
been demonstrating a and
we'll come out with pretty

182
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:57,750
soon, um, with being able
to take this Mattel toy,

183
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,340
which is now discontinued, but you
can get on Ebay for pretty cheap. Um,

184
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,451
modify it.

185
00:11:03,451 --> 00:11:07,590
So like here we're actually seeing a
just different frequencies and I'll tell

186
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:12,330
you and I'll take a photo of this for
you guys as well. Cool. Um, so like,

187
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:12,720
uh,

188
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,920
Michael Osman is another hacker who builds
a amazing stuff and he's built this a

189
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,820
spectrum analyzer which shows us
frequencies and I've modified it here to

190
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,690
actually record things. So
like if I take a car key, uh,

191
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:28,080
we'll actually see a spike here whenever
I hit the button. And a lot of cars,

192
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:28,800
you hit it,

193
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,410
you hit the key to unlock and then you
get in your car and you just press a

194
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:34,680
button now. And that's wirelessly
communicating with your key as well.

195
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,050
You don't even have to put a key
in the ignition in most cars.

196
00:11:37,051 --> 00:11:38,940
It was very confusing to
me when I first used it.

197
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,880
I just leave it in the
center console or whatever.

198
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,880
We were stuck in there for like 30 minutes
trying to figure out how to turn the

199
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:47,300
car on. Yeah. Showing my age.

200
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,140
Uh, so essentially that's
also with radio frequency.

201
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:56,140
You press the button and it sends a signal
to your key to ensure that it's there.

202
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,030
So this device, I've
essentially programmed it to
record that information, um,

203
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,860
and it has to do a few more tricks and
get over a few hurdles and then I can now

204
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:10,740
start your car, unlock it and
drive away. And fortunately,

205
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,040
this only works on nicer cars.

206
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,640
You know, this is a, I
remember when we did the,

207
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,510
on some of our experiments
in online dating and we'll
definitely talk about some

208
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:26,380
of your amazing adventures in the
world of online dating. But, uh,

209
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,040
when I did an episode that
involved a breaking into cars,

210
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,350
which is a whole separate story, but, uh,

211
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:37,630
noticed that a lot of the higher end,
in this particular case,

212
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,380
Japanese vehicles are
really easy to break into,

213
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,950
easier than like old broken down
pickup trucks in some cases.

214
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:50,310
And it's just astonishing to
realize that in certain cases,

215
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:51,221
you know,

216
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:56,050
the security with the most expensive
category of a product is the most

217
00:12:56,051 --> 00:13:00,940
vulnerable. Uh, it's, it just, it really,
it really astonished me to realize that,

218
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,110
well, you find a lot of
Nice neighborhoods. The
doors are unlocked. Oh yeah.

219
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:09,540
You didn't know exactly ended what I found
in this particular case, this was a, a,

220
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,383
a,

221
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,350
a week of experimenting with
urban invasion and picking
locks and getting into

222
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,970
handcuffs and all this stuff. And, uh,

223
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,650
by the end of two or three days
with a very minimal set of tools,

224
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:26,190
I could open all of the cars that
the staff had rented who are,

225
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:27,970
who are working on the show,

226
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:32,971
including like GMC Yukons and like
some very expensive higher end cars.

227
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:38,150
Uh, how did you learn to do this
kind of thing? I mean, where,

228
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:42,470
where did you start to develop this
interest in this skillset? Yeah,

229
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,410
because you have such a breadth,
I mean,

230
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:47,740
you have familiarity and comfort with
software, obviously, and programming.

231
00:13:47,741 --> 00:13:50,440
But now with hardware,
where did all that start?

232
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,160
The hardware or just the, all the
software hacking. The hacking,

233
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,830
the hacking, I mean it started,
it started early on. Uh,

234
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,040
so yeah, I just live with my
mom when I was younger. Um,

235
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:08,620
and she worked a lot, you know,
she had, well typically two jobs.

236
00:14:08,621 --> 00:14:11,410
And um,
she got me a computer one day.

237
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,170
It was probably like eight or nine that
she got me like a brand new computer. Um,

238
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,880
and I said, hey mom, you know,
like, can I have internet? Can I go?

239
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,210
And she spent all her money on this or
on this brand new computer because she

240
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:25,360
knew that I had nothing to do.
Right, right. Has It home is summer,

241
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,270
I know summer camp or anything.
It was just at home. Um,

242
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:31,720
so she knew how the computers and uh,
she spent everything.

243
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:35,860
She had to get me a new this computer
and I got the Internet and I was one of

244
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:39,640
the best days of my life.
And I go on there and I find that man,

245
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:44,350
there's like so many amazing websites
dedicated to the x files, which,

246
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:48,610
which was awesome because I love
the x files. So I spent all day on,

247
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,500
on these websites. About the
x files. And I thought, man,

248
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:56,030
I'd love to really talk to people
about the x files. So I got into a,

249
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:59,870
I found a message board and I pumped
about the x files. So I posted on there,

250
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:03,230
it's like, hey guys, I really like,
so I was to let's talk. And I,

251
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:07,190
he kept hitting refresh, right. He's back
back in the day of message boards. Um,

252
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,610
I guess we still have them, they're
called the forums now. And uh,

253
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,330
I was refreshing and refreshing it or
I wasn't getting the immediate response

254
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,590
like I would on Yahoo or
metacrawler back then when I search.

255
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,620
So I found something
called the chat room IRC.

256
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,540
And I got in there and I went into a
chat room and I was like, hey guys,

257
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,300
I want it.

258
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,710
Who wants to talk about the x files and
which is my favorite show at the time,

259
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:35,480
if it's not obvious. And, uh,
someone said, get out. I said,

260
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,250
what? What do you mean? I just
wanna I just wanna chat. Okay,

261
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,470
let's just hang out and, and
chalk chat about stuff. He's
like, get out. And I said,

262
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:46,580
no, I mean, I'm not sure if I said
no, but I didn't. And then he said,

263
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:50,060
you have 10 seconds to get out.
And he's like, okay, random person,

264
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:54,050
I don't know on the Internet, where are
you going to do? And 10 seconds later,

265
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,050
something happened,
my computer crashed

266
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,600
and I panicked. I turned
beet red. I s you know,

267
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:08,140
couldn't speak with sweating and I'd
never encountered a computer crash before,

268
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,750
especially on the first day that my mom
had just bought this and spent all of

269
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,050
her savings and money on this thing,
right.

270
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,670
That I just destroyed potentially.
I waited for like 10 minutes. Uh,

271
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,170
didn't want, didn't want my mom to
find out, disconnected from the power,

272
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:28,520
connected back in. Thank God is still
worked. And as it was coming up, you know,

273
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:33,110
adrenaline rushing, kind of like
a fight or flight mode. I said,

274
00:16:33,111 --> 00:16:35,990
that was, that was the coolest
thing ever. How do I do that?

275
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,620
You were hit by a wizard. Yeah. How
do I develop my own magic? Yeah.

276
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,240
And not that I want to destroy
people's computers, but
the, the sh the ability, uh,

277
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,030
the power,

278
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,860
I mean there's something
really intoxicating about
that feeling about being able

279
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:52,400
to do that. And that's what got me down
to say, okay, well how do I do that?

280
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,290
And then what was the
next step after that?

281
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,170
The next step I learned about these
things called dos attacks now of service.

282
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,090
And this was like windows 95,
right?

283
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:02,660
It was a long time ago and I was going
to say it's pretty good one to attack

284
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:08,400
the, you know, I download a program
that did this and then windows, uh,

285
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,470
Adidas, just, no, just a
dos. Okay. Not distributed.

286
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,630
New DDoSs is like a newer thing.
Um,

287
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,150
maybe that came out in like
10 years ago because dos is,

288
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:18,410
we're no longer effective.
Right.

289
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,930
This was just a dos attack and a
denial of service, denial of service,

290
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,400
making a website unavailable
to other people. Exactly.

291
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:29,030
Website or computer or computer. Yeah.
And this wasn't even overwhelming.

292
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:29,660
It was just a,

293
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,960
a specially crafted packet that you had
said to somebody and Microsoft patched

294
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:36,470
in one day. And I was like,
oh no, my, my mat, why wizard?

295
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,190
My electronic letter bomb doesn't work
anymore. Exactly. And I said, well,

296
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,820
someone devise a way to create
this program. How can I do that?

297
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,060
How can I make my own, it was called wind
nuke. How can I make my own wind nuke?

298
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,490
So I then learned how exactly.

299
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,450
So back then you called it nuking
it not dossing nuking. And uh,

300
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,570
I started learning how that specially
crafted packet him modified memory on a

301
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:03,750
windows computer and properly corrupted
something in the kernel and then would

302
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:07,770
cause it to crash. What is the
kernel just for those not familiar,

303
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,300
which might include me, I've heard
the word a lot. Sure. The kernel is,

304
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:16,550
is basically just the brain.
It's the brain of a computer
typically. Um, so, uh, uh,

305
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,190
typically more advanced operating
systems like windows, Mac, Linux,

306
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,980
they'll have a kernel that
handles all the system functions.

307
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:26,640
Like it makes sure your keyboard
works and your monitor works, um,

308
00:18:26,641 --> 00:18:29,910
versus your normal software that
sits on top of the colonel. Got It.

309
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:35,010
And that from there,
I mean I had learned how to uh,

310
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,770
learn how to start running software. And
a lot of it also came from gaming. Um,

311
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,090
you know, I played counter strike a
lot, actually got into quake and doom,

312
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,900
then quake,
then counterstrike,

313
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,530
it's probably like 14 playing
counterstrike all day and all night. Uh,

314
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:55,530
and I was, you know, I played so much
that I got good, but it wasn't the best.

315
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,160
I thought,

316
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,780
how could I be the best and and playing
one day and I had two speakers left and

317
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:04,500
right and someone comes up behind me and
in counter strike you can see where all

318
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:06,330
your teammates aren't.
You have like a little radar,

319
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,360
a heads up display where you can see
your teammates but you can't see enemies.

320
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,250
And I heard footsteps,

321
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,940
they came from my right speaker and then
came and then you pan to the my left

322
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:16,980
speaker.
But I didn't see someone on my radar,

323
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,110
so I knew if they're not on my radar,
it must be an enemy.

324
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,600
But since I couldn't see them,
they must be behind me.

325
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,800
And I thought about that for a moment.

326
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,310
There's information going from my
right speaker two I left speaker.

327
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,700
That means there must be positional
information about the enemy.

328
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,980
How do I get access to that?

329
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,330
So that's when I learned the fact that
these packets from these other players

330
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:40,560
are coming to my computer
over the Internet and they
have positional information

331
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:43,020
of where to play footsteps.
So if you have surround sound,

332
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:46,680
you'll properly here how far,
how you know the amplitude,

333
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:49,260
the volume of those footsteps
and where it should we panned.

334
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,890
And once I understand a understood and
learned about packet sniffing where you

335
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:56,580
can just see the packet, see to the
actual traffic going over the Internet,

336
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:01,440
I could then locate every person
that on the map, enemy or friend.

337
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,940
So I then created my own cheat software
and that placed everyone on the map.

338
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,640
I mean I could see through walls,
I actually added opacity.

339
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:11,820
I started learning about how to
reverse engineer. I'm the open GL,

340
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:13,740
which was the graphics
library that was used.

341
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:17,070
So all the graphics that are displayed
when when something says it should be a

342
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:21,570
wall, I said, you know what? You should
actually have a 50% alpha transparency.

343
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,220
I should be able to see
through it a little bit.

344
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,590
You see some Guy Drowsy,
a superman. Yeah, exactly.

345
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:33,591
See some guy crouching and behind a box
and I know exactly where he's crouching.

346
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,430
So I just run and do like a matrix flying,
jump and shooting, you know, a headshot.

347
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:43,820
And then the game wasn't fun
anymore. Um, and actually, you know,

348
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,840
soon after that I was
probably 15 at that point.

349
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,910
There's a software called punk buster.
And just to, just to take a quick pause,

350
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:56,510
you were in Pittsburgh, where were
you at the time? 15. So I was born,

351
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:01,480
I was born in Pittsburgh. Correct
when I was 13. My mom was like,

352
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:05,770
do you want to move to la? And I
said, okay. And uh, we got in there,

353
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,030
we got in her car and moved to Los
Angeles because she wanted to be in la.

354
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,190
And I thought that was cool.
It's a hell of a drive. Okay.

355
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:15,190
So 15 that's interrupted. So now
you're in La at this point? Yeah.

356
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:19,570
15 Nla and like Arcadia,
Pasadena area. Um,

357
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,040
and at this point is about far enough
that I had kind of had enough of high

358
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,950
school, um, not for any good
reason. I just didn't enjoy it.

359
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,450
So I just stopped going. Uh, my mom
was working a lot, so they like,

360
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,390
cause she was at work.
I mean she can tell me not to.

361
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:39,660
So I would go, I would just stay
home and play counterstrike, uh,

362
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:43,750
and then work on cheats and
characteristic immediately became unfun.

363
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,120
I don't know if you've ever played with
cheats, but like when you have cheat,

364
00:21:46,121 --> 00:21:49,540
when you have this God mode, it's
not fun anymore. And fortunately,

365
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:55,050
God mode should be the name of your
memoir by the way when you write it.

366
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:03,340
So as soon as this, uh, as soon as the
cheap, as soon as, as it using the cheat,

367
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:06,730
I would also release it as open source
so anyone else could use it and just see

368
00:22:06,731 --> 00:22:09,820
how to do this kind of
stuff. Uh, I found, uh,

369
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,900
they actually created this software
called punk buster that prevented my cheat

370
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:17,620
from working. And all of a sudden it
became fun again because now it was,

371
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,940
it was like a cat and mouse game.

372
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,940
How do I modify my software
so that they can't detect it?

373
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,870
And we went back and forth. So I'd
release a new version that's fun software.

374
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:26,291
Very.

375
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:31,291
So the game became the cloak and
dagger defeating of the punk buster.

376
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:35,350
Yeah. And similar applications. They're
similar software and I mean it was that,

377
00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:37,450
you know, at this point I'm
fighting against it, you know,

378
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:42,451
a company full of employed developers
and engineers and I get to sit in my room

379
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:49,930
and just, uh, play against
them. Right. And that,

380
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:54,410
that I would say, taught me to understand
this stuff kind of pretty, you know,

381
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,361
at that point,

382
00:22:55,361 --> 00:22:58,840
just a understanding how to break down
a problem and how to break down those

383
00:22:58,841 --> 00:23:00,400
types of problems.
Reverse engineering,

384
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:03,190
you're trying to modify something that
you don't actually have the source code

385
00:23:03,191 --> 00:23:06,040
to, you know, uh, counterstrike
wasn't open source.

386
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:11,770
So when you hit a wall or
had a block of some type,

387
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,130
how would you learn? How would
you problem solve? How would you,

388
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:20,650
how would you try to address that?
Uh, if I hit a block of some sort.

389
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:23,470
So I think,
uh,

390
00:23:23,471 --> 00:23:28,060
I think it broken down things too.
I pretty much, if I have a problem,

391
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,640
whatever that may be, whether it's
technological or in, in life, uh,

392
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,380
and I will take something and I
will try to look at two things,

393
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,410
inputs and outputs and
that's how everything in a
computer works. And that's,

394
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,880
that's why I think this way probably
there are always the number of endpoints

395
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,080
puts sometimes none,

396
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:47,840
but there Stickley's that goes in and
something that comes out and I usually

397
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:51,620
want something to come out a certain
way. Um, and I look at that and I say,

398
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:54,860
what else comes out that way?
Under what input conditions?

399
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,810
Can I make something come out this way?

400
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:00,620
Have I actually tested all the possible
input conditions you might think with

401
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:03,320
the computer? Okay, well
if I give it, you know,

402
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,210
if I want to take something out of memory,

403
00:24:05,211 --> 00:24:08,030
if I went to like read a program
that I'm not supposed to,

404
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,760
what are all the inputs I
can like mash the keyboard?

405
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:13,910
I can send every possible key stroke,
maybe there's no keyboard,

406
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,280
how can I use the mouse in a certain way?

407
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,370
But then you think you just
think a little bit further.

408
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:23,630
Like what if you take all those easily,
readily available inputs away,

409
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:24,950
what other inputs are available.

410
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,660
And then you start to think
about like the environment.

411
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,910
What about the temperature?
You know,

412
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:33,100
if you actually three is if you actually
take nitrogen and apply it to a memory,

413
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,860
you can freeze memory and then
you can pull it out. Uh, you know,

414
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,940
they didn't have to do
this with, uh, with uh,

415
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:46,190
Ross Albridge, uh, Alberta and if
I'm pronouncing that properly, uh,

416
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,510
the Silk Road, uh, you
didn't have to, but if you,

417
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,600
that's a whole separate story who was
apprehended less than five miles from my

418
00:24:56,241 --> 00:25:01,150
house. It's such a
crazy story. Yeah, yeah,

419
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,500
no, definitely. Sorry.
Continue. Oh, um, so yeah,

420
00:25:04,501 --> 00:25:08,360
I'd say pretty much looking at all the
possible ways I can send information and

421
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:13,160
I can control the input.
That's, that's how I, uh,

422
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,670
what would be an example of that from
your counterstrike days or any other days?

423
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:24,470
What would be sort of a real
world example of, of how you say,

424
00:25:24,471 --> 00:25:25,490
all right,
hold on a second.

425
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:30,200
Let me look at the inputs and outputs
in this particular scenario. Okay, sure.

426
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,370
Um, so let's take, uh,

427
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:36,680
something new and new that I'm working
on right now that has some demonstrations

428
00:25:36,681 --> 00:25:41,180
up. Um, and that's
hijacking cars. Perfect.

429
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,780
So, uh, first it was how
can we start cars? Like how,

430
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,840
what, what is my goal, right?
What is my intention? Um,

431
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:53,030
and obviously my goal
is not to steal cars,

432
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:56,750
but to just show fallacies in ways that
we can protect against this as well. Uh,

433
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:59,170
but to protect against it, you
have to understand it, right? Um,

434
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:04,120
so how do I start my car normally and
I'm looking at these cars were, uh,

435
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,940
you either use a key or
you don't use a key. Now,

436
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,920
when cars that use a key,

437
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,600
it's actually pretty simple because
it's pretty easy to replicate keys. Uh,

438
00:26:14,601 --> 00:26:16,220
there's plenty of bump keys available,

439
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,370
the number of ways to break
into the car bump keys make,

440
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,750
make getting into cars really easy.
You've learned that.

441
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,730
You've learned that my car safe out there,
it's gone.

442
00:26:28,731 --> 00:26:32,620
That's all right. I want to
have it for long. Awesome. Uh,

443
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,300
so that's, uh, and that's,
and that's actually really
interesting. A lot of hackers,

444
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:41,610
you know, every year there's a really
big conference in Vegas called Def Con.

445
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:46,690
It's been going on over 20 years and they
actually have a huge lock picking area

446
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,490
where it's cool. Yeah. And it's not
even, a lot of them are hackers.

447
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:53,070
A lot of them aren't. A lot of them
are just straight lock pickers.

448
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,980
That's what they do. They want to
be able to break every type of lock.

449
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:59,640
And it's very much the same as
hacking. Right? It's how, what,

450
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,610
how can we control the environment in a
way to produce the output that we want

451
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,270
this, you know, tumble, lock, turning. Um,

452
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,110
even though I don't have the
proper equipment, the key,
so for the car it's like,

453
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:13,920
okay, well I'm pushing a button that must
be doing something and I know that it

454
00:27:13,921 --> 00:27:17,000
communicates with my key somehow.
I don't know. I don't know how, um,

455
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,780
because there's nothing else,

456
00:27:18,781 --> 00:27:22,290
because one of my keys not there and I
push a button, the car does not start.

457
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,400
I you're talking about the non insertion
key in this case. Yeah, correct.

458
00:27:26,401 --> 00:27:27,061
For in this case,

459
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:30,440
I'm talking about the non insertion
key just because the doing it with the

460
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,540
insertion key has been done over and
over again. Right. Um, so now it's the,

461
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:37,680
the newer models of everything. Or now
you don't have a key that you insert.

462
00:27:37,681 --> 00:27:40,230
You just keep it in your pocket.
So as long as you have the key on you,

463
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,040
you can start the car. So I wanted to
say, okay, well how is that communicating?

464
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,030
And, uh, I look at the key
and in some cases the key,

465
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:52,290
we'll actually have like a model number
in the u s you actually have the FCC,

466
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,620
you're actually regulated where you can,
what you can transmit and receive.

467
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,080
So pretty much any device, you know what
the band is, you know what the band is.

468
00:27:59,081 --> 00:28:01,920
If you look at it loved back of any phone,
it'll have an FCC id.

469
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,440
And at least in the u s oh yeah.

470
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,840
Look I think is looking at
the back of an iPhone. Yup.

471
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:10,560
And because it transmits and receives,
so from here you can actually look,

472
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:13,590
look up that a band like you
said, right. The frequency band.

473
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:17,590
Then you look at how can I listen
to that frequency band. Um,

474
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,000
and I found some devices, I found
some. Awesome. Would you just Google,

475
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:25,470
how do I listen to Xyz band or like I
mentioned earlier, I Google everything.

476
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,640
Okay.
Can you share what we were talking about?

477
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:36,750
My car is really small and
it's loads go you specific.

478
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:40,350
It's very low. It is
low. It's a Lotus Lotus,

479
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:46,250
which I just like scrambled and struggled
to get out of earlier and just look

480
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:48,780
like a complete idiot
trying to get out of it.

481
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:52,110
It's a great car but it's very hard for
me to get out of. So yeah, the top is on.

482
00:28:52,111 --> 00:28:56,600
It's pretty hard to get out of
when the top is on. And uh, I man,

483
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,860
when I got it, I loved it. Um,

484
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,340
that's another time I really use Google
immediately because I'd never driven

485
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:06,690
stick before. So they shipped it
to me, they delivered it at uh,

486
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,290
like there's some place in Hollywood
and I had to drive it home and I'd never

487
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:15,291
driven stick sitting sitting in it
on my iPhone looking at like Wiki,

488
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:20,130
how.com, I think some, you know,
I googled how do I drive stick

489
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:25,620
and that's so I learned on the way
I didn't learn well that's a hard,

490
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:31,020
that's a really rough entry into
manual transmission. Yeah. Drove,

491
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:35,380
drove home, stalled a few times
on the one and a half miles home.

492
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,020
But um,

493
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:42,020
I got out and just was an idiot and just
like stumbling for five minutes trying

494
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:46,030
to figure out how to pull myself out
of these buckets. Seats because yeah,

495
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:47,080
it's just,
it's kind of like,

496
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:50,920
imagine that you have like your pants
pulled down to just above your knees and

497
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:55,260
you go down to a full squat and then
you have to like dive forward. It's,

498
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:58,060
it's like ergonomically very similar.

499
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:03,810
So you googled know I drove it around
the first week and man I've pulled up

500
00:30:05,501 --> 00:30:07,750
somewhere nice place,

501
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:12,010
a bunch of people and my brand new car
about this and this felt good and not

502
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:16,960
just a brand new car. Brandon
Lotus, brand new lotus.

503
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:19,000
And I'm like this,
this feels good.

504
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:24,270
I opened the door and I
like struggle and I'm like,

505
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:28,060
should I just get back in and drive away?
I think some people saw me.

506
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,160
So after a week of this
embarrassment I Google,

507
00:30:33,161 --> 00:30:34,930
how do I get out of a lotus?

508
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,910
And to my surprise and delight,

509
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:44,230
people have documented how I found a
youtube video that was very instructional.

510
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,180
I gave it a like,
um,

511
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,380
I did not believe a comment
that I needed to learn,

512
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,310
but I learned how to get out of my car
through the youtube video and online

513
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:58,030
because it was, it's just
really embarrassing. And
Yeah, I learned how to you,

514
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,230
I've used one arm,

515
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,350
you use one hand on the steering wheel
and you pull that cause that is firmly

516
00:31:02,351 --> 00:31:05,260
connected to the car as the other
hand on the side of the chair.

517
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,720
And then you just thrust,
thrust of your arms,

518
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,890
you urge you superman out of the phone to,
yeah,

519
00:31:11,891 --> 00:31:14,440
he's superman and then
smoothly catch your balance.

520
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:19,510
And the sort of the parallel
here with the band, if,

521
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:23,830
if you look at the back of a phone or
device, the back of a key and you're like,

522
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,330
oh, look at this, there's
an FCC registration, right?

523
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,700
And I can identify with the band and the
frequency band is right for this, uh,

524
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,980
this wireless key,
right,

525
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,140
for whatever brand x car happens to be.
Uh,

526
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:43,290
and then the next step is googling or
determining how to listen in on their

527
00:31:43,431 --> 00:31:46,260
frequency. Correct. And you know,
you don't, if you don't know that,

528
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:49,150
I don't know much about frequency
bands, but I know that, you know,

529
00:31:49,151 --> 00:31:50,260
when you're listening to FM radio,

530
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,240
that's a frequency band FM that's actually
frequency modulation. It's a type of,

531
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:58,420
it's a way to communicate
data's am amplitude modulation,

532
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:02,620
amplitude modulation it, they actually
adjust the way that they're sending data.

533
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:05,800
Amplitude is like volumes. So they're
changing the volume to send data.

534
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,570
We're frequency to actually
changing the frequency.

535
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,040
So when you listened to one oh 5.9 FM,
you're listening to one oh 5.9 megahertz.

536
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,630
And your,
the,

537
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,640
the frequency is actually changing
from one oh 5.8 to one oh 5.106.

538
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,970
That's actually why, you
know, you can listen to FM
radio a little bit off, right?

539
00:32:24,971 --> 00:32:28,500
Sometimes you hear FM if you're
a little off. So, uh, that's,

540
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:33,440
that's another frequency. And a lot
of these actually car keys use am,

541
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,520
um, they're not an aim that a
radio in a car with listened to,

542
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,640
but they are a m so it's size of the
way of not the number of the waves in a

543
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:45,830
given timeframe. For amplitude, it's,
it's essentially like how much, uh,

544
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,590
how powerful that wave is. I
see. It's like volume, right?

545
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:52,860
It's like yelling versus being quiet.
Right? Um, so that's the different in,

546
00:32:52,861 --> 00:32:57,210
in amplitude modulation is just
a fancy word for change. So,

547
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:02,960
and uh, and then we'll do the next
step after that. It's not, so,

548
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:03,261
yeah.

549
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:07,960
So I found a few different devices that
I can use that are low cost and a couple

550
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,000
people, you know, a couple of security
researchers have made a lot of this stuff,

551
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,430
uh, readily available. I mean, uh,

552
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:16,730
it was other researchers who found that
you can use this Mattel toy to actually

553
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:20,630
listen to and wide number of frequency
bands, right. Rather than, you know,

554
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,990
in the past just a few years ago,
it costs thousands,

555
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:27,410
thousands of dollars to get something
that could listen to all of the frequency

556
00:33:27,411 --> 00:33:31,400
bands that like something like this would
output and for you to actually access

557
00:33:31,401 --> 00:33:34,700
all that data.
So once I got to a device like this,

558
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,010
I'm actually able to see the data.
I can actually get turn,

559
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:43,030
turn that when you press that button
and it sends a signal in 433 megahertz,

560
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:47,360
um, that I can see that data,
what that binary data is.

561
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,910
And if I send it a bunch,
I hit the button a bunch of times,

562
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,970
then I see it over time and I see
what changes, what doesn't change.

563
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,730
And I can make assumptions because then
I can compare it to another car and say,

564
00:33:55,731 --> 00:33:58,790
Oh wow, this beginning is always
the same between these two cars.

565
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:01,400
So that must mean it's this type of car.
Uh,

566
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,830
but this part here is
different between the two cars.

567
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:07,850
So that must mean this one specifically
for this car and this other identifier

568
00:34:07,851 --> 00:34:11,150
is for this other car.
And usually there's actually,

569
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:13,460
there actually is decent
security in most cars.

570
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:16,010
It's called rolling codes where
the code changes every time.

571
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:20,190
It's kind of like a Google authenticator
or something like that. Yeah, yeah.

572
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:24,240
It's um, it's a, yeah, it's
like an additional factor
of authentication where the,

573
00:34:24,241 --> 00:34:25,970
the number changes.
So if I,

574
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:31,030
let's say there's only a thousand possible
ids or passwords that would work to

575
00:34:31,551 --> 00:34:36,050
open this car, turns his car on.
If you send id 10 it turns on,

576
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,530
but the next, but if I
listened to that and replay it,
replay that 10, it says, oh,

577
00:34:39,531 --> 00:34:43,370
I've already seen 10 we're on a new code
now, so it's not going to allow that.

578
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,270
So that was the first problem I ran
into where I can't send the same code.

579
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:50,120
So if you go up to your
car and you turn it on,

580
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,720
I can listen and I can store that.
But if I replay it,

581
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,350
it's not going to work because
the car knows that that's been,

582
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,270
that code's been used.
Now is the car recognizing,

583
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:01,950
is it the uh,

584
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:06,650
frequency or the tune effectively of that,

585
00:35:06,651 --> 00:35:08,450
like good quick cook,
that type of uh,

586
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,350
electronically like a bird song that
is triggering the car. Therefore,

587
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,650
if it didn't change from
a 10 to whatever was next,

588
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,360
you'd be able to replay that
sound auditorily? Uh, not,

589
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:25,040
not with audio. Okay. I
mean, so, um, audio is a,

590
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:29,110
is a, is essentially vibration
of air, right? Where uh,

591
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,160
this is radio frequency. I see. Right.

592
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:34,880
So the audio is really just a cue for the
human to be like, exactly. It's my key.

593
00:35:34,881 --> 00:35:37,710
My key did something. Yeah. Yeah. It's
just a really silly sound that they used,

594
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,710
which I like to reenact.

595
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:44,160
Some of you may have noticed that will
increase with the moral wine that we have

596
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:49,200
most likely. Got It. So you ran into
the problem that this is, this is,

597
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:53,400
this is a rolling code prefix or whatever
it might be. That's changing over time.

598
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,200
But there's,
there's a couple of exploits here.

599
00:35:55,201 --> 00:35:59,490
There's a couple of
possible vulnerabilities.
If your away from your car,

600
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:02,700
if you're not close to it and you
hit the button and I capture that,

601
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,563
I can play it.

602
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:07,470
So if I came into your house and I had
my device and I pressed the button on

603
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:08,400
your key,

604
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,550
I can then record it because your car
is far enough that it didn't see that.

605
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,310
So now I can use the code,
right?

606
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,650
But that's not good enough
because now me in your house,

607
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:19,030
I have access to your key.
That seems a,

608
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:23,610
it seems like I already have physical
access them. I just live here.

609
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:28,030
It's a brute force approach.
It forcetech. Uh, so, uh,

610
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:30,540
that's just not good enough as an
exploit. Really familiar, at least for me.

611
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,230
So I want to take it from very
elegant. It's not elegant at all. Um,

612
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,060
so how can we make this better?
Now,

613
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,940
another thing that I've
seen is that these fee,

614
00:36:38,941 --> 00:36:41,360
a lot of these devices
are very inexpensive. The,

615
00:36:41,361 --> 00:36:42,990
they don't want to spend
too much on these parts.

616
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,540
They want to make it work and work well.
Um,

617
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:48,540
so if you actually send a bunch
of other data on that frequency,

618
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,350
it will not work because now the car's
confused and it sees too much information.

619
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,540
Now if you stop,

620
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,940
you could call that jamming and you don't
need to send a big signal. But I could,

621
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:00,510
if you take another car
with that communicates on
the same frequency with the

622
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:03,900
key and you just hold down your lock
button while someone else is trying to get

623
00:37:03,901 --> 00:37:06,600
into their car, you'll prevent
them from getting into their car.

624
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,150
Oh my God. So you can actually hold and
for totally different manufacturers,

625
00:37:12,151 --> 00:37:15,180
most of them are using the same frequency
because it only certain frequency

626
00:37:15,181 --> 00:37:18,630
bands you can use fixed and stuff.
So if you see someone and you have like a,

627
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,150
like I was using a Cadillac,
a car key,

628
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,970
and it transmits so far.

629
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,180
If you have one of those really powerful
transmitters that hits your car from

630
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:30,180
far away and you just hold unused
hold lockdown, it's holding lock.

631
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:33,840
So you could just sit in the parking
garage drinking, drinking your coffee,

632
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,420
holding down the lock button,
watching people lose their shit.

633
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,310
You got the not being able to turn
on their cars sitting in there.

634
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:46,530
So ostensibly, is there a way,
and this is just me with my, uh,

635
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:52,200
my science fiction cap on a or
conspiracy theorist calf on perhaps, uh,

636
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,870
is, is there a sensibly
a way if they're limited,

637
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:00,140
if that band is so uniform that someone
could deploy some type of a wide

638
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:08,430
reaching jamming to incapacitate cars
over an extended period of time? Um,

639
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,920
yes. I mean you need a lot
of power, right? The further,

640
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,560
the further you want to go, you
need a lot of power. That's why,

641
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:20,240
that's why FM stations, right,
they have such big towers. Um,

642
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,880
a m can actually go longer.
Uh,

643
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:27,690
and so there are a couple of ways
that you can do this. Um, but yeah,

644
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,580
you could with enough
power and an antenna,

645
00:38:29,581 --> 00:38:33,720
you could prevent a lot of
cars from starting. Wow.
Uh, at least if it requires,

646
00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:36,700
if it's using the radio frequency based
stuff right now, not in normal key,

647
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:37,690
normal key will work fine.

648
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:42,880
And I'm sure there are people out
there listening to this who are asking

649
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:43,271
themselves,

650
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:48,271
why on earth would these
security researchers make
these exploits known to the

651
00:38:48,971 --> 00:38:51,550
general public? Isn't that just
giving a blueprint to be blue,

652
00:38:51,551 --> 00:38:56,110
want to exert malice in the world
or create chaos? AndW how would you,

653
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,550
how would you respond to that?
I mean,

654
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,370
that's an infant now keeping
in mind and full disclosure,

655
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,850
I'm one of those kids who bought the
anarchist cookbook and was looking at like

656
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:08,390
improvise munitions and put himself in
advertently on every watch lists on the,

657
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:12,990
in, in the, in the domestic United States.
But, uh, so I'm fascinated by exploits.

658
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:16,150
I find them infinitely interesting.
But at the same time, you know,

659
00:39:16,151 --> 00:39:20,410
this is a question that comes up. So
yeah, yeah. Fair. Say, Oh, what as a kid,

660
00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:22,660
I was like 12.
Then once I was 12,

661
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:25,540
I had my own website and I
found the anarchist's cookbook.

662
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:27,850
So I put a copy of it up cause
I thought this was awesome.

663
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,270
And one day my mom comes home from like,
one of her jobs is like Sammy,

664
00:39:31,271 --> 00:39:35,680
like someone at work was look, you know,
found this thing on your website. And uh,

665
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,000
he was actually looking up this thing,

666
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:39,340
anarchist cookbook and found on
your website like, why are you,

667
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,280
why do you have this thing? I
was like, well it's awesome,

668
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:46,870
but why was he looking like he had
found it inadvertently? Not On my site,

669
00:39:46,871 --> 00:39:51,350
but just through a wave is searching
for it. Cause I don't know.

670
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:55,840
I'm not sure. And I mean it's interesting
information, but you ask a question,

671
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,500
you ask a good question, right? Um,
is this a blueprint for, you know,

672
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:04,420
malicious people to act upon? And
it can be, but I don't think so.

673
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,270
And the reason I say this is a,
I've been doing,

674
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,470
I've been in security and hacking
long enough that many years ago.

675
00:40:11,471 --> 00:40:13,660
What I would do is I,
if I found a new exploit,

676
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:17,380
I would sometimes I would contact the
company and I would let them know about

677
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:20,830
this and say, Hey, like totally
fried. Just just want to let you know,

678
00:40:20,831 --> 00:40:24,550
I found this vulnerability.
You guys should patch this
because it's uh, you know,

679
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:27,460
battered customers, your customer data
could be leaked, you could be hacked,

680
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:30,400
it could hurt you. Um, I haven't
done anything. I just found it.

681
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,000
And sometimes you get a
response, sometimes you
don't, sometimes they fix it,

682
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:34,834
sometimes they don't.

683
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,320
And then I found they found some other
vulnerabilities and then I would write

684
00:40:38,321 --> 00:40:41,170
publicly about it and say, hey, like,
here's some things that we need to fix.

685
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,010
This is a general problem, not something
I can just email a company about. And,

686
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,570
you know,
nothing would really happen.

687
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,960
A couple of security people would
read my blog and say, oh, neat.

688
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,940
That's like some really interesting
information. Thank you Sammy.

689
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:55,180
And nothing changes. Um, and
then one day I said, you know,

690
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:58,420
like nothing ever changed.
A lot of these things don't change when I,

691
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,820
when I talk about them,
when I contact the right,

692
00:41:00,821 --> 00:41:03,790
the proper people who have the block,

693
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,250
when you're going through
official channels,

694
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:09,310
when I can do it going through official
channels. So I released this time,

695
00:41:09,311 --> 00:41:11,410
not only a blog and this is uh,

696
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,280
there was something I released a few
years ago and it's called the ever cookie.

697
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:19,360
And essentially what this does is it
plants a tracking cookie on your computer.

698
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,250
Kind of like when you go
to a website and you know,

699
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:24,670
if you go to Google and you make a search
and then you go back to Google a week

700
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:24,700
later,

701
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,970
it knows who you are and knows that you
did that search last week and that's

702
00:41:27,971 --> 00:41:29,680
through a cookie,
but you can delete your cookies.

703
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,860
And I found that some
companies we're also doing,

704
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,830
they would install a different type of
cookie called like a flash cookie so that

705
00:41:36,831 --> 00:41:39,890
if you deleted your normal cookies,
they would still know who you are.

706
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:44,000
It's a bit surreptitious. That's creepy.
Yeah, it's a little, a little creepy. And,

707
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:44,810
uh,
you know,

708
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,720
a number of people knew about this for
many years and it got talked about and

709
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:51,210
talked about and talk about for years. I
thought, I mean, these aren't, you know,

710
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:54,200
someone had released a little bit
of software to try to prevent it.

711
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,330
And I thought there's some
other ways of doing this.

712
00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:59,540
And I was in Dublin at the time,

713
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:03,560
first time I left the U s we're
talking about earlier and I, uh,

714
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,830
I thought it'd be cool to create
something that can really plant itself,

715
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,740
like in every possible way that I can
think of. And I sat down and was like,

716
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:11,330
there's gotta be at
least four or five ways.

717
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,830
And I thought about for about 14 or 15
ways to plant software, or not software,

718
00:42:15,831 --> 00:42:19,160
but a unique identifier that will then
track you every time you come back to

719
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:23,930
that website or any site that has the
tries to attract you using that software.

720
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,560
So it would install a unique
identifier in your cookies,

721
00:42:27,561 --> 00:42:31,550
in your flash cookies and your Silverlight
and Java in your history and your

722
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:35,450
cash just everywhere. And if you
deleted almost everything except one,

723
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,940
it would then respond.
It would recreate everywhere.

724
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:39,500
So you could never get rid of it.

725
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,950
Literally most rousers
could not get rid of this.

726
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,420
So if someone wants to track you,

727
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:47,660
they would always be tracking your web
presence at least on those sites that

728
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:51,060
hosted.
And this got it.

729
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,330
Press this.

730
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,450
I mean this was interesting to the
security community because the security

731
00:42:57,451 --> 00:43:01,320
community had been talking about this for
years, but no one really listened. Uh,

732
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:06,350
people had been demonstrating companies
that were doing more mediocre measures

733
00:43:06,571 --> 00:43:10,820
of this though. What University
version. Exactly. Yeah.
That they were going Jv. And

734
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,690
this was finally something that
anyone could use entirely open source.

735
00:43:15,691 --> 00:43:19,730
I made entirely free, um, kind
of a lot of hate mail for.

736
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,450
But what was interesting was it was a few
months later that every browser vendor

737
00:43:24,451 --> 00:43:27,120
had changed.
Every major browser had changed.

738
00:43:27,121 --> 00:43:29,910
I don't know if you remember a few
years ago when you want to delete your

739
00:43:29,911 --> 00:43:32,610
history, you deleted in one place.
If you want, delete your cash.

740
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:34,860
You have to go into a different
dropdowns and delete it there.

741
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:39,000
If you want to delete your, uh, down the
recent downloads you go somewhere else,

742
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,700
all of this stuff was
segregated and no cute,

743
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:45,390
no sane person would actually go
to all through all this effort.

744
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:48,420
Now when you delete your
privacy information,

745
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:52,080
it's all centralized sort of file one
privacy, one checklist, one checklist.

746
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,213
And that's,

747
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:58,080
I saw that change and that's probably
the biggest thing that made that impacted

748
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:02,400
me to understand this
actually produces change. Yes.

749
00:44:02,401 --> 00:44:04,500
Maybe someone will be able to use
it maliciously for a little bit,

750
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:04,981
but you know what,

751
00:44:04,981 --> 00:44:08,730
people have been using it maliciously
for years and no one actually knows that

752
00:44:08,731 --> 00:44:12,440
because talking about it
doesn't do enough. Okay.

753
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,570
Yeah. It's not just enough to talk. Yeah.

754
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:17,120
And you need people to listen and
there are definitely different,

755
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:21,020
different levers you can pull to
make that more effective. Sure.

756
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:25,400
So speaking of which,
uh, and I, I do want to,

757
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:26,630
if you're open to it,

758
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,720
a chat about my space at one point
because that's a hell of a story.

759
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,720
Oh my God. Folks, don't go away.
Coming right back. Uh, the,

760
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:40,350
the next subject I thought we could,
we could dig into a little bit is,

761
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:43,140
is a online dating.
So getting people to listen.

762
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:51,240
Uh, we had a lot of fun with the, uh,
the episode on Tim Ferriss Experiment,

763
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:54,270
which is now digitally available by
the time people are listening to this,

764
00:44:54,271 --> 00:44:58,620
which is amazing. After so much
effort and lawyering and everything,

765
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,320
uh,
we'd a lot of fun on that episode.

766
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,680
And you take this same scientific approach
and I really feel like what you do

767
00:45:07,861 --> 00:45:11,500
is, uh, using the scientific method,

768
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:14,550
it really at a high level to,
to attack some of these,

769
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,570
these engineering problems and challenges,
uh,

770
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:22,540
in the world of mating and dating. So, uh,

771
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,410
could you talk about some of the,

772
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:30,330
some of the ways you have thought
about online dating and improved your

773
00:45:30,331 --> 00:45:34,050
prospects online dating? And we
can dig from there. All right.

774
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,870
I don't even know where to begin.
My, my mind is flooded with,

775
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,950
with all the possibilities that we
could discuss. Okay. So, so I used, um,

776
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,000
I used online dating, maybe I'd done a
long time ago, 10 years ago, 11 years ago.

777
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:47,220
And, uh, I,

778
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:50,820
I met someone great and had a great
relationship for a few years and that was

779
00:45:50,821 --> 00:45:55,380
awesome. And, um, I think I got
back to it maybe, let's see.

780
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:59,850
I think five or six
years ago I had gotten,

781
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:03,960
you know, meeting people.
It's frustrating. Uh,

782
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:08,880
I wanted to meet, meet more women. So
I thought, okay, I'll, I'll do online.

783
00:46:08,881 --> 00:46:10,940
Did again. I had good
experience. It was painted,

784
00:46:10,941 --> 00:46:13,500
it was hard as a lot of work is painful,
uh,

785
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:18,560
but also fun at times and it was
successful. So I thought, okay,

786
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:19,351
I'll do it again.

787
00:46:19,351 --> 00:46:24,351
So I went on sort of the hip dating site
at the time and I had that was okcupid.

788
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:28,403
Okcupid.
Yeah.

789
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:33,590
And I made a profile on there a few
years ago and I started reaching out to

790
00:46:33,841 --> 00:46:38,400
people, um, doing searches and
you know, I was doing a lot of,

791
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,460
I have also a lot of work.
I had a lot of stuff to do in my life.

792
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:45,600
A lot of stuff I like doing.
I did not like going messaging people,

793
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:49,110
not getting messages back scrolling,

794
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:52,290
just like scrolling through endless lists,
having so many,

795
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,540
so much data to go through and
then not even knowing whether,

796
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:00,410
I mean, I guess the biggest problem was
I wasn't getting messages back. Right?

797
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:05,010
And I'm like, what happened?
I thought I was eligible,

798
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:10,590
puts the failure point in there and
you're like, dammit. So I thought, okay,

799
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,780
well, you know, how would I,
how would I approach this?

800
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,730
And this was after a few
frustrating weeks, I thought,

801
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:17,010
how would I approach this if
this were a problem with my,

802
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,870
let's say my company's
website or something.

803
00:47:18,871 --> 00:47:21,290
What if I were trying to
make sales online? Um, how,

804
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,830
how would I approach this differently?
And I thought, okay, well if I,

805
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:27,900
if I were doing something for my own
company or my own business or on my own

806
00:47:27,901 --> 00:47:30,340
product or whatever,
I would probably,

807
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:34,000
I'd start with some basic ab
testing or multivariate testing. Um,

808
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:38,980
I would try comparing what one group
of people did versus another group of

809
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:43,390
people. So I didn't have, I didn't
want to spend too much time in this,

810
00:47:43,391 --> 00:47:47,950
but I wrote a little script and all
that did was every day that would cycle,

811
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:52,540
that would change my photo,
my primary photo and uh,

812
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,090
okay Cupid, we'll show you how
many hits you would get that day.

813
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,770
So everyday I would check back and that
it's stored in a database and you know,

814
00:47:59,771 --> 00:48:04,440
I had it, I had throw up a couple of my,
you know, bad photos just as a, I dunno,

815
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:09,160
control or something and had my,
my best photos and some medium photos.

816
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,980
My best photos were awful.
They were terrible.

817
00:48:11,981 --> 00:48:13,840
I thought performance without performance.
Why?

818
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:18,850
What I thought looked great with this
stupid smirk on my face was terrible just

819
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,700
by bombs. Right. No one clicked. Right.

820
00:48:21,701 --> 00:48:24,070
And this isn't in searches
and probably messages as well.

821
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:28,450
Nobody clicked the photos that I thought
were good and a couple of these photos

822
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,080
that I just thought were mediocre,
subpar,

823
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:36,570
just they got clicks and there's
certain certain things I learned that,

824
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:43,480
I mean, I will say our chick
crack. Yeah. Things that, you know,

825
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:46,360
when guys see certain things
on the website, they click any,

826
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,510
their brain shuts off and they click
and there are the same things for girls.

827
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:54,190
So what are, what are some of those
things? Well, um, the thing that did best,

828
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,710
I mean just land slide was

829
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,630
a picture of me and a cat
sitting on my shoulder.

830
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,950
So they weren't clicking for me and this
had nothing to do with me. Let me, let's,

831
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,820
let's be clear. It was, they
saw a cat, but that's okay.

832
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:12,700
I'm just trying to get you one step
further, right? Once it further word,

833
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:15,220
then you can learn a little bit of my
personality. Maybe you'll, you know,

834
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,490
you'll try to read this,
uh, this text I put up. Uh,

835
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:23,860
so that was that instantly after learning
that I was just blown away. I was like,

836
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:27,590
wow, I've been doing this
wrong. I am not as, uh,

837
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:32,200
I have no idea what other people like
apparently. Um, and that's fair. I mean,

838
00:49:32,201 --> 00:49:36,760
I don't, so I should use data and try to
help help myself and help other people.

839
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,480
I mean, I think this is,
this is beneficial. And A,

840
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:42,760
we did some absurd permutations of this

841
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:48,070
for the TV show. I'm not going
to spoil it. Uh, but we, uh,

842
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:52,840
we went for the gold with some of
these proof opics uh, the, of you,

843
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,680
the big to be clear.
And there were other people involved,

844
00:49:56,681 --> 00:50:00,790
like Neil Strauss who really
was not in favor of any of this,

845
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:05,720
but, uh, who's the author of the game?
For those people who don't know the, the,

846
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,510
what are,
what are some of the,

847
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:13,440
now at one point you didn't you create
a female profile to observe what came in

848
00:50:16,661 --> 00:50:21,130
as inbound in terms of,
absolutely. I mean, I'll, I'll
start with this. I'm, I'm not,

849
00:50:21,131 --> 00:50:26,050
um, I tried to be as transparent and
honest with people. Um, I, you know,

850
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:30,360
I hate deception and I don't
try to deceive people, but
for ab testing, it's, it's,

851
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:34,210
it's for science. So I
created a profile of, uh, uh,

852
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:37,790
of what I thought would be someone
I would like to date. Right.

853
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:42,440
Someone who's attractive. Um, what is you,
what did you call her? Do you remember?

854
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,640
Oh, I don't know. I'd have
to look that up. All right
here. I'm pretty sure I stole.

855
00:50:46,641 --> 00:50:50,900
I'm pretty sure I stole another girl's
username. And then you changed a number.

856
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:54,230
Got It. Um, I used a text from
a profile that I really liked.

857
00:50:54,231 --> 00:50:57,170
They use a friend's pictures
who allowed me to, and uh,

858
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:02,800
I put that up just to see what if I
were a female that I personally would be

859
00:51:02,961 --> 00:51:06,200
attracted to. What are they
experiencing on an online dating site?

860
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,160
Because I have no idea.

861
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:11,960
I thought my woody messages would
really wear it can they weren't. So,

862
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:15,430
you know, I'd, I'd always
start with the subject hello.

863
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:20,410
And then a really great message and a,
after the first day I got over,

864
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,210
nope.
Close to a hundred messages,

865
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:27,830
close to a hundred emails as
this, you know, attractive,

866
00:51:27,831 --> 00:51:30,890
interesting female.
That's, I mean, terrible.

867
00:51:30,891 --> 00:51:33,770
There's no possible way anyone's going
to go through all these messages.

868
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:38,510
And now I'm looking at the messages
and the first thing I see is the same

869
00:51:38,511 --> 00:51:43,511
subject over and over and over that I
probably use over and over and over.

870
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:48,410
They're all saying basically four
thing, three or four things. Um,

871
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:52,980
hello my idea, you know,

872
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:57,960
hey wink, winky face, um,

873
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:05,110
thought we should chat
and wanna fuck nice.

874
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:06,860
It's a strong,

875
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:11,580
it's a strong opener and it's actually
all of those were used a lot. It was that,

876
00:52:11,581 --> 00:52:15,560
it was surprising and I
felt that I was offended.

877
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:21,320
I as a fake female on this website
has offended. And I thought, wow,

878
00:52:21,321 --> 00:52:23,900
like these are all the say
they're all the same. Right.

879
00:52:23,901 --> 00:52:27,260
Even if it were interesting, if it's
all the same, then it's irrelevant.

880
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,030
So I immediately learned,
okay,

881
00:52:29,031 --> 00:52:31,880
my subject line has to be different and
that's be interesting as we, you know,

882
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:34,680
not offensive and it has to be not boring.
Um,

883
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:37,010
so then I went into another city.

884
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,840
I wanted to actually another state
and I tried mailing lots of people,

885
00:52:41,841 --> 00:52:43,430
different subject lines as a man,
right.

886
00:52:43,431 --> 00:52:46,160
As my own profile and estate
that I wasn't even in.

887
00:52:46,161 --> 00:52:48,890
I'm not actually going to meet these
people. I'm sorry if I emailed you,

888
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:53,150
but I just wanted to know what subjects
had the best read rates and then

889
00:52:53,151 --> 00:52:55,310
response rate.
Um,

890
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:59,330
I found a little exploit that allowed
me to get the read rate because normally

891
00:52:59,331 --> 00:53:03,560
you can't see how many people open your
message. Right? And once I found this,

892
00:53:03,561 --> 00:53:06,860
I found how many people open a message
and then I can also track how many people

893
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:11,630
responded, right? And that the open
rate allows me to measure how well,

894
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,760
how good is the subject
doing the subject line.

895
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:19,110
And I tested a ton of different subject
lines to see what worked best and uh,

896
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:23,060
I'm sorry to say it, uh, and
I've been trying to curse less,

897
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:25,830
but the best subject line was fuck you.

898
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:29,140
Now not saying that,
that,

899
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,250
that obviously not elicit a
positive emotional response,

900
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:36,720
but that's not immediately the goal.
That's on immediately the goal. And,

901
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,370
and that's okay because,

902
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:42,960
and I found if you're
still a dick in the email,

903
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:48,000
the response rate is zero or
very little and some mean things.

904
00:53:48,001 --> 00:53:50,730
And I don't think you should ever be
mean to someone. And my intention again,

905
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:53,040
is not to be mean.
I'm trying to see,

906
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:57,220
it's like clapping in front of their
face really, really hard openness.

907
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,120
And I found the best research,

908
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:03,390
the best way to get a response
in a positive response is to say,

909
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:06,270
I only did that.
So you'd read this message,

910
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:10,800
you're probably getting a ton of emails
from other guys that are saying, hey,

911
00:54:10,801 --> 00:54:15,690
or want to fuck. And she's
like, how did he know?

912
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:18,630
How did he know? Exactly.
So, so it's really, I mean,

913
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:21,780
it's just trying to understand
what someone else is going
through and how can I,

914
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:26,730
how can I knew her that better? And then
also, ultimately I'm always transparent.

915
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:31,230
You know, whenever I meet anyone, I tell
them whenever I meet anyone, I tell them,

916
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:35,880
uh, you know, exactly all the, all
the tactics, just because, I mean,

917
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:39,250
if anything else, it's interesting
conversation, especially with a woman. Um,

918
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:42,060
it really, it, it was the best first date.

919
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:44,220
Every time you just get
to talk about something,

920
00:54:44,221 --> 00:54:45,810
like immediately you have
something to talk about.

921
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,280
You're both on this dating site,

922
00:54:47,281 --> 00:54:51,570
you're both trying to meet somebody and
you're both upset about the results.

923
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,090
However,

924
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:56,310
how inefficient the whole thing is so
immediate that that was always really

925
00:54:56,311 --> 00:55:01,200
positive. So, yeah. You know, I, I'm not,
I'm not suggesting me an asshole. I'm,

926
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:05,790
but I am suggesting that a,
it's good to learn about ways to,

927
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:06,540
you know,

928
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:10,500
just be a maneuver past and actually
get someone to read you read that letter

929
00:55:10,501 --> 00:55:13,770
and see whether you are an interesting
person, whether you would drive,

930
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:15,480
we know with,
uh,

931
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:21,330
with online dating for someone
who does not have technical chops.

932
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:25,200
So super someone who cannot personally
doesn't have the capacity to write

933
00:55:25,201 --> 00:55:27,470
scripts or whatnot.
Uh,

934
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,480
what would your advice to
them be in this day and age?

935
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:35,090
That's great because there's, there's a
wide variety of toolkits available, right?

936
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:39,150
You have the Okcupid's is the
match.com Tinder. Oh, sure, of course.

937
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,840
Uh,
what would your advice to,

938
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:44,880
to a nontechnical person B,

939
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:49,910
and let's assume for the sake of argument
that since they would waste as a guy,

940
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:56,400
you're going to waste hundreds of dollars
on drinks and dinners that go nowhere.

941
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,300
So let's assume they have a budget. Okay.
A little bit of a budget, like 500 bucks.

942
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:03,890
Okay. What would your advice
to them be? Okay. So, uh, the,

943
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:08,070
the first thing you do is you get
a record player and you take a,

944
00:56:08,071 --> 00:56:12,510
you take your iPhone and you
attach one of those, um, those,

945
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:15,070
those pens that have the conductive tip.

946
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:18,450
So you can draw on your iPhone with it
and you attach it to the record player

947
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:23,040
and you put Tinder beneath it.
So the record player just spins and just,

948
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:26,230
you know how you swipe right,
swipe over to them.

949
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:29,200
I saw the video of this and it was
the funniest thing I've ever seen.

950
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:34,600
Somebody who attach this little nub to
a record player that would just swipe on

951
00:56:34,601 --> 00:56:38,980
Twitter. Tinder. I thought that was
really funny. Okay. No, so realistically,

952
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,420
I don't know, the site might
not be around anymore, but um,

953
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,730
instead of writing a program, you can use
a site like hot or not, or if there are,

954
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:51,640
there are any sites like that, that, you
know, unfortunately measure appearance,

955
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,870
but that's important.

956
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:57,820
It's very important to your photo is
the most I learned Okcupid critical,

957
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:01,300
which allows you to upload
the photos to do, uh,

958
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:06,220
my cupid or my best face. They have
that now. Correct. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

959
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,080
So, uh, my best, you're right.

960
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:11,440
My best face on Okcupid allows you to
essentially do the same thing where you

961
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:15,790
can upload a number of photos, you
rate other people's photos essentially,

962
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,670
and other people rate yours.
So it's a,

963
00:57:17,671 --> 00:57:20,470
it's a really cool system
where you learn what, you know,

964
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:22,450
what a photos of you or most attractive.

965
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:25,100
And I found the photo of
Brad Pitt was my most of

966
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:33,490
the right picture of my picture of a
Jason Statham with just doing a scrooge

967
00:57:34,331 --> 00:57:36,700
McDuck backstroke.
And a pool of money was

968
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:41,700
trying to buy penguins.
I don't know the why the penguins were so,

969
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:48,520
so first identify which photos
work the best for them. The photos,

970
00:57:48,521 --> 00:57:51,430
the first thing anyone sees,
and we did this in the episode too,

971
00:57:51,431 --> 00:57:55,330
so there's a for people who
want to see how off I was,

972
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:59,890
how incredibly off I was
in my predictions. Uh, you,

973
00:57:59,891 --> 00:58:03,640
you can check that out. It's on
iTunes probably at this point, but uh,

974
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:07,210
so you identify your best photos.
Absolutely. What's next? Okay.

975
00:58:07,211 --> 00:58:10,000
So now if you, if you're a low, any light,

976
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:13,300
if you're like me and had a terrible
photo, you're now receiving messages.

977
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:17,290
So you're already here already, like
happy. Um, but if that's not enough,

978
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:21,490
you need to because you know, you're, you
need to be a little bit more selective.

979
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:26,650
Um, so what's next is I would say
testing different subject lines. Um,

980
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:27,603
you know,
I,

981
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:31,420
I wanted to test so many people that I
went to a different state and I automated

982
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:34,510
that. But you can, you can
test it yourself, right?

983
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:37,780
You can use the same message and some
of these services allow you to pay a

984
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:41,260
little extra to see read
rates and open rates and um,

985
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:44,980
essentially analytics for
your dating profile. Uh, pay,

986
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:49,900
pay that extra amount and make changes
make changes often and record that data

987
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:54,500
always recorded, keep it an XL
spreadsheet. You will learn so much. Um,

988
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:58,830
so the next thing is how do
you communicate, um, the,

989
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,370
this is just the way it is.
If you're a guy,

990
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:02,950
you need to be reaching out to
people, right? And you should be,

991
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,470
if you haven't figured that out yet,

992
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:10,040
the hot chicks and not going to come
knocking on your door. I hate to tell Ya,

993
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,000
if you want to be selective,
you need to work for it. So,

994
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:18,940
so I'm testing different
subject lines and uh,

995
00:59:18,941 --> 00:59:20,520
another thing that I learned,
the,

996
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:24,800
that you should use immediately
is while messages are great, uh,

997
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:27,200
what I found was very,
was really,

998
00:59:27,201 --> 00:59:30,800
really effective as you could go messaging
for weeks with someone who's really

999
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:33,950
interesting and if you're,

1000
00:59:33,951 --> 00:59:38,660
if the service you're using a has
chat, like Okcupid has chat, chat,

1001
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:39,411
you know,

1002
00:59:39,411 --> 00:59:42,840
select people as your favorites so you
see them whenever they're online. Um,

1003
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:45,530
don't stock them. Just like when you
see them once, then talk to them,

1004
00:59:45,531 --> 00:59:49,130
communicate with them. And
what's a good opener, uh,

1005
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:53,740
in your experience? Uh, I, I tried to make
it relevant to their profile. Right? You,

1006
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:56,960
you, you don't want to appear
like you don't want to use,

1007
00:59:56,961 --> 00:59:59,750
you don't want to be the people who
don't actually read the text. Right?

1008
00:59:59,751 --> 01:00:01,430
You actually want to learn
about that person. Right?

1009
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:04,400
There's a high probability she's looking
for someone who has read the text,

1010
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:07,820
who has read her profile. Right?
She put it in time on that.

1011
01:00:07,821 --> 01:00:12,020
You put in time on that, so read it.
Um, don't, you know, if you're just,

1012
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:13,730
you might find you might
not like this person.

1013
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:17,540
So read the texts and then trying to,
you know,

1014
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,310
try and make some simple conversation.

1015
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:23,030
I would say immediately the best thing
I learned is it's not even about the

1016
01:00:23,031 --> 01:00:26,870
opener at this point because you're
chatting. So where a message,

1017
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:30,140
the subject line is so critical
because if it's not good enough,

1018
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:34,280
she's not going to open it in a chat.
The chats open,

1019
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:38,540
you can get a couple lines of texts
before she closes. It goes in and says,

1020
01:00:38,541 --> 01:00:42,650
I'm not, I'm not listening to this. A
little bit more margin for error. Exactly.

1021
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:46,880
And I find the chats are
always red, right? If you're
saying is something in chat,

1022
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:47,743
it's always red.

1023
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:52,250
Do not sit around and talk and just
wait for them to respond to everything.

1024
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:56,960
Instead have an interesting story and
it should be your legitimate story and

1025
01:00:56,961 --> 01:00:59,870
your life. But everyone has, everyone
has something. And if you don't,

1026
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,480
I mean go and talk about your life more,

1027
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,480
but find an interesting story in your
life or do something interesting or do

1028
01:01:05,481 --> 01:01:07,720
something absolutely go.

1029
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,880
If you don't have at least one good story,

1030
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:14,870
you need to get outside mark to go
running naked in the quad. Okay.

1031
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:21,800
So have a short but sweet story prepared,
you know,

1032
01:01:21,801 --> 01:01:26,360
a true story about your life and just
dish it. Just start talking. Who cares,

1033
01:01:26,361 --> 01:01:29,360
who cares what the other person thinks
right now because they're probably not

1034
01:01:29,361 --> 01:01:31,490
going to respond anyway. Right? If you're,

1035
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,770
if you're listening and
you care about this,

1036
01:01:33,771 --> 01:01:36,380
this is probably because it
hasn't been working. So try this.

1037
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:41,330
So I have to ask and feel free to,
to uh,

1038
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:45,980
to reject this question. But what
was, what was your go to story.

1039
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:49,880
Oh, go to story. Okay. Um,

1040
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:57,350
uh, okay. I think, I think we
may have done something similar.

1041
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:02,060
Um, was it on point? Tactical? Oh
yeah, yeah, yeah. With Kevin Rave.

1042
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:05,830
Yes. So I had recently done this, uh,

1043
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:09,560
urban escape and evasion class that it
sounds like you have taken and are an

1044
01:02:09,561 --> 01:02:14,360
expert in which we've done a, an
amateur. I'm like a green belt.

1045
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:16,460
You, you've actually, you've
done more things than I learned.

1046
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:21,330
I learned when I went to him. So he,
he's, he's up up the game and that's,

1047
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:23,190
that's really cool.
I'm going to ask you some questions later,

1048
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:27,300
but I wa I took this,
this course,

1049
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:32,280
urban escape innovations three days
in la. And uh, he, like you mentioned,

1050
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:37,140
I mean he taught me how to
escape out of LAPD handcuffs,

1051
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:42,270
right. Get out of riot flexi cuffs.
Um, you know, my time when I went to,

1052
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:46,080
he did not, we didn't learn about the
newer cars. You remember I'm older cars,

1053
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,150
so I was stuck in like a 70,

1054
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:53,540
75 how you name you so that I stole.

1055
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:58,640
Uh, and that was, I mean
the fact that on the,

1056
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:02,590
on the third day of this class, you know,
we got, I got picked up in a van and a,

1057
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,630
the, they put a hood over my head. Uh,

1058
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:08,020
strange cause it's Kinda
like the ecofriendly,

1059
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:13,030
the green environmentally friendly type
of like they put like a whole foods bag

1060
01:03:14,121 --> 01:03:14,954
over your head.

1061
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:19,910
It was exactly that whole foods bag
over my head so I can see they took my

1062
01:03:19,911 --> 01:03:23,420
wallet and flown and drove
around La and I had to get out,

1063
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:27,140
escape from the handcuffs and run
around Los Angeles without money.

1064
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:31,250
And I would tell some
tidbits of the story about,

1065
01:03:31,251 --> 01:03:36,050
you know how I know this is all in chat,
all in chat. So was like, Hey, what's up?

1066
01:03:36,051 --> 01:03:36,884
And then you're like,

1067
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:39,860
let me tell you about the time I
got got out of lap BD handcuffs.

1068
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:43,220
What's the transition? Okay.
Yeah. Good question. No,

1069
01:03:43,221 --> 01:03:46,790
I'm like I'm so into the specifics because
when it comes to all of this, sure.

1070
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:51,470
I remained to this day complete like I
three finger monkey fumble all of this

1071
01:03:51,471 --> 01:03:56,210
stuff. I'm such a fucking idiot. So I'm
really interested in the specifics. Okay,

1072
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:00,780
sure, sure. So, so I say, Hey, what'd you
do today? That's, that's pretty much it.

1073
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:03,540
That's pretty much how I would start
that conversation. What did you do today?

1074
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:08,490
Not, what do you do? No, no one cares.
This is not, it's not an interview.

1075
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:12,210
Right? What did you do
today? Uh, if you know,

1076
01:04:12,211 --> 01:04:15,570
she's either going to say something
interesting and you can add on that or,

1077
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:20,370
or you are too afraid to comment on
what she said or she's not saying much

1078
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:24,660
saying went to work, right.
Went to school. Uh, you
know, did nothing. Watch him.

1079
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,550
Not much. Lol, winky face. Hello.

1080
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:32,670
I tried that. That didn't work
well when I answered that.

1081
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:38,750
So, okay, so you ask what do you
mean when did you do today? Um,

1082
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,490
you're saying, you know,
she's saying something, just
saying something often it's,

1083
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:47,060
it's irrelevant. Often it's the same
thing that everyone else says, righty?

1084
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:51,680
As a guy, you're also receiving a lot
of the same thing too. Um, so as a girl,

1085
01:04:51,681 --> 01:04:55,370
you know, if you really care, then also,
you know, pay attention to be different,

1086
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:58,630
be different if you can be,
and you know,

1087
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:01,730
interesting because you probably are,
so show that,

1088
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:06,550
so what did you do today? And then
maybe they'll ask what did you do?

1089
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:10,540
And if they don't, it doesn't
matter. You can still say,

1090
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:15,150
because at this point that she didn't
ask, she is not interested. She only,

1091
01:05:15,151 --> 01:05:18,130
when she's already not interested,
it can only go up from here. Right.

1092
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,670
There's the only upside. Exactly.
And if she asks them, she asked,

1093
01:05:21,671 --> 01:05:26,480
so answer and I said, you know, oh,
well just recently this happened. Um,

1094
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:28,570
and if it's six months ago,

1095
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:32,770
fib say just recently this happened and,
and that's,

1096
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:37,000
that's the transition. Got It.
Last weekend or, yeah. You know,

1097
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:42,450
I've just been going over this crazy
class that I took. Cool. Definitely. And,

1098
01:05:42,451 --> 01:05:45,550
and talk a little bit, right.
He will do more talking, um,

1099
01:05:45,551 --> 01:05:49,180
offer some something interesting. So
we've never talked about this, but I, I,

1100
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:51,100
I will ask anyway,
uh,

1101
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:56,310
the jump to in real life IRL quick.

1102
01:05:56,710 --> 01:06:01,000
All right, quick, quick. Tell me more.
Every time I, and how do you and what's,

1103
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:04,300
what's the verbiage? What's,
what's the transition?

1104
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:08,200
So every time I would have like emails,
messages go back and forth,

1105
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,350
it would be great because the
emails you actually get, you know,

1106
01:06:11,351 --> 01:06:14,290
you get good information back and if
you're doing back and forth emails,

1107
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:17,410
you're actually communicating a lot.
And a lot of people are, um, uh,

1108
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:22,390
I mean I think it's not so much anymore.
Right. I started, you know, I was,

1109
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:27,340
I did online dating maybe three times
in my life and, um, it was all great.

1110
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,890
I like it actually was successful
every time. And then glad,

1111
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,400
I'm glad I always did it. And back then,
I mean, when I first started I was 18,

1112
01:06:33,401 --> 01:06:36,830
I'm 29 now,
so it 11 years ago and uh,

1113
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:40,440
people were more fearful of meeting
someone on the Internet. Right. Uh,

1114
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:42,910
that was a little different. It
was different back then. Right.

1115
01:06:42,911 --> 01:06:46,000
You didn't use her full name as long
until Facebook came out that people use

1116
01:06:46,001 --> 01:06:47,320
their full name because they had to,

1117
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:53,230
but you didn't want to miss out on this
social network. I mean, I didn't, uh,

1118
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:56,680
so I'm sorry, what was the question?

1119
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:01,630
The jump to in real life,
the jump to IRL I, okay.

1120
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:06,960
So what I learned was messaging back and
forth was comfortable and it actually

1121
01:07:07,211 --> 01:07:11,530
made it more difficult to
jump into a meeting on chat.

1122
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:14,470
You've quickly communicated if
you had an interesting story,

1123
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:18,010
you've quickly communicated that you have
interesting things to talk about, your,

1124
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:20,800
you know,
confident enough to talk about it.

1125
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:25,480
At least if you have other stories like
this, you're probably interesting person.

1126
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:28,510
I mean, you're, you're probably
already are an interesting person. Um,

1127
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:32,170
and after about five minutes and don't,
don't linger,

1128
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:35,270
don't wait until the
conversation dies down. Um,

1129
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:37,210
there's a Seinfeld episode
where I think George,

1130
01:07:37,211 --> 01:07:40,630
because sands found that it was best
when he left at the top and the heights,

1131
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:45,310
I'll just like the rocky Marciano
approach to dating. He's like, all right,

1132
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:48,200
that was my best joke and I
got to go out actually. Right,

1133
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:50,020
because you let it linger,
then it's this boring.

1134
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:54,160
Here's remembering though how it
ended. Well make it good, right?

1135
01:07:54,161 --> 01:07:58,810
He just had this awesome story, you
know, the edge of her seat and he's like,

1136
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:02,140
oh wow. That's like, that's really cool.
It's really interesting. It's like, Hey,

1137
01:08:02,141 --> 01:08:04,930
you know, I have to run, I have to
go do some other interesting thing.

1138
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:09,460
I've your rescues, I'm getting this
down the street from some penguins.

1139
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:15,800
And uh, from there you say, you
know, I have to run right now. Um,

1140
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:16,750
you know,

1141
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:19,550
get some information because you don't
want to meet someone just because they

1142
01:08:19,551 --> 01:08:23,450
said lol smiley face. Right. You also,

1143
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:28,280
they need to feel like they've favor in
that value as well. Like no one wants to,

1144
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:31,280
I don't like it when someone comes up and
just offers me a bunch of stuff for no

1145
01:08:31,281 --> 01:08:34,250
reason. Like, what do you want from me?
Right? Right. You want something from me.

1146
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,760
So that's just trying to think in their
position and try to put yourself like

1147
01:08:37,761 --> 01:08:42,210
reverse the role and what would
happen if that happened to you. Um,

1148
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:46,640
so I conversation a little
bit more, try to, you know,

1149
01:08:46,641 --> 01:08:48,020
learn some interesting things about them.

1150
01:08:48,021 --> 01:08:52,100
Ask them questions that are not common
and you can learn some questions from the

1151
01:08:52,101 --> 01:08:53,090
emails, right? If you,

1152
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:56,390
if you create a fake profile and
another state don't respond to people,

1153
01:08:56,391 --> 01:08:59,300
I think that's deceptive. Just
let emails come in, right?

1154
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:02,510
And see what people say and learn from
those because you'll see the sand,

1155
01:09:02,511 --> 01:09:03,650
the common questions,

1156
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:06,710
the questions that you think are really
unique that everyone else is asking.

1157
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,100
Don't ever ask those.
Um,

1158
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:12,910
you'll learn those overtime instead tried
to think of something different. Um,

1159
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:15,500
and I didn't, I thought I was being
unique, but I was asking him the same.

1160
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:19,930
Are there any unique questions that you
relied on consistently? Uh, I mean, you,

1161
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:24,170
you, I would say I would
just ask about the thing,

1162
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:26,720
things that I actually wanted to
know. Like, I want you to know,

1163
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:29,150
would you rather lose your front
teeth or cut off your thumbs?

1164
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:33,240
Would you ask them questions like that?
I'm just kidding.

1165
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:39,410
That's a dude. One type
question I'd probably not
appropriate for online dating.

1166
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:44,780
Um, no. I just asked her like, how's
your day? Not, not what did you do today?

1167
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:47,670
Or like, what was the most, I mean, uh,

1168
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:50,480
implore them to give you the
interesting information about your life,

1169
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:51,373
about their life.

1170
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:54,490
What is the most interesting thing that
happened to you in the last week? Yeah.

1171
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:57,980
And now they're going to
recall and re feel like,

1172
01:09:57,981 --> 01:10:01,280
have the same emotions that they felt
at that most interesting time of their

1173
01:10:01,281 --> 01:10:04,280
life in the last week. Yeah. Got It.

1174
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:09,100
So I have to go to do this other
interesting thing and then what? Uh,

1175
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:11,530
so I have to go, I have
to go and do x, um,

1176
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:15,050
make a joke if he can have to go save
something wins. That's funny. Right?

1177
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:18,830
I think that's funny. Um,
maybe it's not ab test that.

1178
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:24,890
Um, but you know, let's, let's grab a
quick coffee this week. Uh, you know,

1179
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:27,560
I did dinners a few times
and I quickly ran it,

1180
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:31,040
ran into having a dinners with a bunch
of people I really didn't want to have

1181
01:10:31,041 --> 01:10:34,700
dinner with. Yeah. It's a one to three
hour plus commitment. Yeah. Yeah.

1182
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:39,020
So then it's coffee, it's coffee, it's
easy. No, it's easy to, easy to leave.

1183
01:10:39,021 --> 01:10:42,030
It's quick. You don't,
you don't have to, uh,

1184
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:45,470
it's not a big deal if you pay for it,
right?

1185
01:10:45,471 --> 01:10:47,360
You're not setting any stage or anything.

1186
01:10:47,361 --> 01:10:51,260
You can pay for it and be nice and it's
not a big, you know, it's not a big event.

1187
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:54,830
What, uh, if, if those,

1188
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:59,060
some people listening to this and
we'll certainly of the male variety,

1189
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:03,510
um, but not definitely. Hello ladies.
I know you're listening to you,

1190
01:11:03,511 --> 01:11:08,511
but just try to go out and hit on guys
for a day and you will see how brutal

1191
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:14,240
that side of the game is.
It's fucking terrible. Uh,

1192
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:18,660
let's just assume that there are
guys listening to this. Maybe women,

1193
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:21,420
it could be either and they're
saying, you know, I need a Sammy.

1194
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,910
I need someone to help me automate this,

1195
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:28,500
to swipe right on all these profiles to
automatically like all these people to

1196
01:11:28,501 --> 01:11:33,501
simplify this process because dating
online seems to be a sort of high volume,

1197
01:11:34,891 --> 01:11:39,600
low yield proposition. I
want to stack the deck. Uh,

1198
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,950
how would they find someone to help?
What would they look for?

1199
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:45,210
Ask for it.

1200
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:48,930
Sure, sure. I mean, I don't know
of any because I haven't used any,

1201
01:11:48,931 --> 01:11:52,910
but I would look specifically for
dating services that use analytics. Um,

1202
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:56,130
if you like to play with this kind
of stuff, if you'd like to, you know,

1203
01:11:56,131 --> 01:11:59,040
if you'd like to be analytical or if
you'd like to see how you can stack the

1204
01:11:59,041 --> 01:12:02,310
deck yourself. I think playing
cards is interesting. Uh,

1205
01:12:02,311 --> 01:12:07,311
use existing dating services like Okcupid
or match and Hay for their pay for

1206
01:12:07,351 --> 01:12:09,220
their additional software
there, there, there,

1207
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:11,490
there are a premium
service premium services.

1208
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,600
Or now if you wanted to find, say
a freelancer, a programmer, a,

1209
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:19,190
what are the qualifications that someone
would look for if you're like, okay,

1210
01:12:19,191 --> 01:12:23,120
I want you to write a script to say,
hypothetically if I,

1211
01:12:23,121 --> 01:12:25,730
if I live in Chicago,

1212
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:31,090
I want to auto like everyone in Chicago
who fits the following specifications,

1213
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:35,670
but I don't know how to do that
because I'm not a techie. Uh,

1214
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:40,140
who would I look to hire?
Like if I went to elance or one of the,

1215
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:41,810
one of these sites,
uh,

1216
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:45,900
what would my sort of project request?

1217
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:48,290
Like, uh, I mean there's
two things I'll say to that.

1218
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:52,160
The first thing I'll get quickly
out of the way. Uh, you, it's,

1219
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,040
that always seems like the best
idea and that's what I want to do.

1220
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:58,400
I want to get as many people. I wanted
to cast the widest net as possible.

1221
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:03,830
And until you do it, you think of the
great idea and I would tell you to not to,

1222
01:13:03,831 --> 01:13:06,500
but you're going to so ah,
do it.

1223
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:10,070
Learn that you're then spending all your
time with people you don't care about.

1224
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:12,560
Right? So then you actually
have to spend time filtering.

1225
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:17,270
And I spent the next half of my, that time
filtering. But to answer your question,

1226
01:13:17,271 --> 01:13:20,060
because I understand, like if someone
told me not to, I still would.

1227
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:23,100
So to get that knee, now
you have to sometimes. Um,

1228
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:26,540
I would look for somebody a go on,
Ilana said, go on Craig's list.

1229
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:31,490
I would try to find someone who's
developed software who can develop web

1230
01:13:31,491 --> 01:13:33,030
crawlers,
um,

1231
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:38,090
who can develop backend web software
and who can develop may, you know,

1232
01:13:38,091 --> 01:13:42,140
maybe basic analytic software you don't
need. They don't need to be a genius.

1233
01:13:42,141 --> 01:13:45,980
This is, this is very simple stuff
that you're doing PR programmatically.

1234
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:50,950
Got It. Uh, if you are using,

1235
01:13:50,951 --> 01:13:55,420
do you, I don't even, uh,
if you were on Tinder,

1236
01:13:55,450 --> 01:13:58,150
hypothetically or otherwise,
uh,

1237
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:00,910
does any of the advice change?

1238
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,620
Um, you know, I don't yet. I don't
use Tinder. I'm not on Facebook,

1239
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:10,690
but if I were to use Tinder,
uh, what would I do? Let's see.

1240
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:15,460
Well, I mean lately I've been playing
around with computers and algorithms.

1241
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:19,360
A computer vision that lets you
actually see a, you know, let's,

1242
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:24,100
you may make a computer
actually see things and
interpret things. But on Tinder,

1243
01:14:24,101 --> 01:14:25,250
I mean,
I mean,

1244
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:29,280
you could have the computer decide
hot or not for you after putting,

1245
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:33,280
adding in some inputs. I think
you could, you could do some,

1246
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:38,890
I guess yes, the answer is yes,
you can do some basic things there.

1247
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:42,670
Um, but I think what I'd want to do is
does Tinder have descriptions of people?

1248
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,000
I'm not sure. Very short
description sort of descriptions.

1249
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:48,640
So the thing you want is a Dataset,
right?

1250
01:14:48,641 --> 01:14:51,180
You want to know who are the people
and maybe you have, you know,

1251
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:55,000
maybe have girlfriends who are on Tinder,
like look them up,

1252
01:14:55,001 --> 01:14:56,440
look up their information,

1253
01:14:56,441 --> 01:15:01,441
look up anything that would help provide
information to people who you think you

1254
01:15:01,481 --> 01:15:04,390
would like to date and people who you
would think you would not like to date

1255
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:08,500
because you need to be able to
have, uh, information on both.

1256
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:10,710
So you can write some sort of algorithm.
Um,

1257
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,410
because Tinder has such little
information, I would say, you know,

1258
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:18,070
for a friend I wrote actually a Tinder
script that would essentially swipe until

1259
01:15:18,071 --> 01:15:20,680
I saw that video. And that video
was just, it was hilarious.

1260
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:23,770
So if you want to just swipe,

1261
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,590
you can use a record
player and a one of those

1262
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:32,020
iPhone nubs to swipe for you.
Um, but then after that it's,

1263
01:15:32,021 --> 01:15:34,720
I believe it's chatting. Is that
right? Yeah, it's all chatting. Okay.

1264
01:15:34,721 --> 01:15:38,440
So most applications on
mobile, a iPhone, android,

1265
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:39,850
they're actually web based.

1266
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:45,000
So you're actually dealing with a lot of
the same web software or web protocols.

1267
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:49,960
So if you wanted to automate some of that,
man,

1268
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:52,750
I guess what I would personally
do if I were on there,

1269
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:58,000
I would create or hire someone
to create a Bot that would

1270
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,730
swipe yes swipe correctly. Yes, I
want to communicate with this person.

1271
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:08,970
And when we were matched up then I would
have it automatically communicate and

1272
01:16:09,401 --> 01:16:13,300
then I would have it texted
me and I could probably,

1273
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:18,540
what I might do is actually automate a
few like have a story or two that I could

1274
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:22,630
text back to this device. Uh, wherever I,

1275
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:27,220
wherever I was like that was not as if
I was on a date. If I were on a date,

1276
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:31,630
I will be able to text back and say,
turn this story on it.

1277
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,100
We just communicate with something.
Right. Go on, go on time to go.

1278
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:38,290
But you would still see the messages
so you could still actually communicate

1279
01:16:38,291 --> 01:16:40,480
with that person live from
your phone. Right, right.

1280
01:16:40,481 --> 01:16:44,290
You might not be or I guess you could
open the APP at that point. But yes,

1281
01:16:44,291 --> 01:16:48,820
I would again find the same
type of person, someone who
can create web software,

1282
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:51,760
not just a website but a web crawler.
I think that's the,

1283
01:16:51,761 --> 01:16:55,690
that's the differentiation. Someone who
knows how to sort of crawl an automate,

1284
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,200
right. Produce something that's atonomous
that can communicate with this website.

1285
01:16:59,201 --> 01:17:00,034
With this app,

1286
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:06,250
how would you vet the people who respond?

1287
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:10,130
So if you go to say craigslist or,

1288
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:11,533
uh,

1289
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:16,540
an Odesk or elance and you put up looking
for web crawler specialist for dating

1290
01:17:19,171 --> 01:17:22,530
project you described roughly
we were trying to accomplish.

1291
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:25,950
So you get 37 responses from people
who are saying, I can do this. Yeah,

1292
01:17:25,951 --> 01:17:26,784
no problem.

1293
01:17:26,910 --> 01:17:31,910
Is there something that you could have
them do as a test to assess their yeah,

1294
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:38,110
competency? Um, I would ask them,
I'd find a website that you like,

1295
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:40,380
maybe,
you know,

1296
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:45,110
a news website or something and I would
something that has other content on it.

1297
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:48,780
And I would say, write me a script
or don't write me a script. You know,

1298
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,380
if you can do this quickly,
I will hire you.

1299
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:57,250
Please have it go to every
news article for the last week,

1300
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:01,400
right? It's something that
has to hit click back, right.

1301
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:06,650
And take these elements of the page,
take the, the sub, the headline,

1302
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:10,500
um, and take the fifth word. Okay.

1303
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:13,540
And put those in an XML document,

1304
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:17,050
something that clearly is not that
valuable, may make it not valuable. Right?

1305
01:18:17,051 --> 01:18:18,400
You don't want them to work too hard.

1306
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:22,620
You don't want to abuse their time and
you don't want to suck the value from

1307
01:18:22,621 --> 01:18:25,800
them. Right. If someone, I would not
want to do free work for someone,

1308
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:28,350
but if it's a test that they
clearly get no value out of,

1309
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:29,850
I'm more likely to do that.

1310
01:18:29,850 --> 01:18:31,770
So I'd say it's something
that you can't actually use.

1311
01:18:31,771 --> 01:18:33,510
It doesn't have any interesting.
That's interesting.

1312
01:18:33,511 --> 01:18:36,440
So it's not even a time issue. It's
really a utility question. Yeah.

1313
01:18:36,441 --> 01:18:39,080
I feel like if someone, you know,
if I'm working with someone, right,

1314
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:41,460
if I were asking for something
that gave me a real ROI,

1315
01:18:41,461 --> 01:18:43,320
you'd be less inclined to
do it. But from saying, Hey,

1316
01:18:43,321 --> 01:18:47,790
this is just a test of your competency,
you know, I can't use the output. Yeah.

1317
01:18:47,791 --> 01:18:50,520
I'm happy to. I'm happy to
demonstrate that of my capabilities.

1318
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:53,080
I'm not happy to provide free services.
Free,

1319
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:55,710
right value and in exchange for nothing.
Correct.

1320
01:18:57,230 --> 01:19:00,920
Yeah. Huh. That's really interesting.
I never thought about that before. Uh,

1321
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:05,830
very cool. So, uh, two things. I think
we should definitely talk about my space.

1322
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:09,730
Okay. And it looks like we've,
we've temporarily run out of wine,

1323
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:14,620
so I'm going to pause this for just
one moment and we shall be back.

1324
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:15,483
Don't go away.

1325
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:23,210
We are back after a bathroom break
and an alcohol refill with Sammy.

1326
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:26,450
Sammy, how the hell are
you? I'm great. And Hey,

1327
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:30,470
I promised the fine people at home
that we talk about my space and, uh,

1328
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:35,480
so I don't even know where,
how to introduce this story.

1329
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:40,370
Tell me a little bit about
your involvement with my space.

1330
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:45,290
Okay. So my involvement,
I was a user of my space.

1331
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:49,760
Um, so back in the day, this was, this
was probably, this was 10 years ago,

1332
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:53,510
so I was 19 at the time. Uh, and my space,

1333
01:19:53,511 --> 01:19:58,250
there's 2005 my space was the
number one site on the internet,

1334
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:03,080
number one of Google above anything else.
And I thought this was interesting.

1335
01:20:03,081 --> 01:20:07,650
This is kind of cool. Um, all
of my friends used it pretty
much everyone, you know.

1336
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:11,150
Yeah. Pretty much all my friends
used it and I hadn't used it yet. Um,

1337
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:14,760
and I thought, okay, you know, everyone's
using it. I should get on here.

1338
01:20:14,761 --> 01:20:16,350
Just see like, see what it's about. Right.

1339
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:20,850
A little social proof and to check it out.
And I created in my space,

1340
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,810
added a couple of friends, made a
profile. It was like, this is Kinda cool.

1341
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:28,530
And I'd like a started uploading photos.

1342
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:32,780
I finally had a digital camera and
I took a bunch of random photos,

1343
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,470
my friends and would post them.

1344
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:39,780
And once I uploaded the 12th photo
and I tried to upload the 13th,

1345
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:44,880
it said, you've hit our limit
now, today, today. That's insane.

1346
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:49,530
That's insanity. If a website
told you if Instagram said, oh,

1347
01:20:49,531 --> 01:20:54,360
12 photos, you've hit our Max,
huge, no one would use it. Yeah,

1348
01:20:54,361 --> 01:20:58,080
he'd be gone. Right. But back then,
it wasn't, it wasn't relevant. Uh,

1349
01:20:58,081 --> 01:21:00,630
not that many people had that many photos.
I mean,

1350
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:04,080
digital cameras were
getting cheaper and um,

1351
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:08,580
but for the most part that wasn't an
issue and I thought it was an issue.

1352
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:12,120
So I said, okay, well how do I get around
this? I don't like having 12 photos.

1353
01:21:12,121 --> 01:21:16,350
I want, I want 14. I think
that's, that's a solid number.

1354
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:18,590
Um,

1355
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:23,280
and I found a way to upload a 13th photo,

1356
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:28,380
so I uploaded it to 13th and it wasn't
a big deal. It's just I wanted to,

1357
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:33,050
I didn't like the limitation.
Um, so I went around it and uh,

1358
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:37,980
on the front page you have, um, you
know, sort of description of yourself,

1359
01:21:37,981 --> 01:21:41,180
like your bio, your
relationship status, uh,

1360
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:46,660
your favorite books and stuff.
And I thought, okay, we'll
be cool to, to change. Um,

1361
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:49,680
there's the relationship status.
And uh,

1362
01:21:49,681 --> 01:21:53,550
I was dating someone and so I had in a
relationship and that was a dropdown.

1363
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,340
You can choose from like single,
divorced, married, et cetera.

1364
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:59,820
And I thought it'd be funny if I could
change that to in a hot relationship,

1365
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:03,420
subtle change. But if someone
saw it, that'd be funny. Um,

1366
01:22:03,421 --> 01:22:06,450
they might think it's interesting
or funny. Uh, at least I do.

1367
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,720
And they wouldn't let me do that.
So I thought,

1368
01:22:09,721 --> 01:22:13,080
I wonder how it could get around this.
So I played around on the website,

1369
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:16,460
you know. How old were you at
the toast? I was 19, 19. Um,

1370
01:22:16,730 --> 01:22:21,180
as though my sec second year of my
company. So it's working fulltime,

1371
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:25,830
uh, in La. What did your
company do? My company, uh,

1372
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:30,390
did and still does a phone system.
So cloud-based,

1373
01:22:30,391 --> 01:22:33,870
actually now it's cloud
based phone systems, but we
sorta voiceover Ip company,

1374
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:38,460
uh, called finality about, wow. 11,

1375
01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:42,360
12 years ago now.
That's up 700 Internet years ago.

1376
01:22:42,361 --> 01:22:47,250
That was so many internet years
and calves ago. So you were 19?

1377
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:52,260
Yeah, I was 19 and I would work sort of
night and day. So it actually, you know,

1378
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:54,030
go to work,
go to the office,

1379
01:22:54,031 --> 01:22:57,930
come back at night and I'd play around
in the smiley face site because that was

1380
01:22:57,931 --> 01:22:59,640
the cool thing at the time.
That was the hip thing.

1381
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,000
So I was messing around on the site and
I finally found a way that I execute

1382
01:23:05,831 --> 01:23:10,000
javascript. And javascript is
a web coding language and um,

1383
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:12,880
javascript allowed me to modify the page.

1384
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:16,530
So my space never allowed
you to answer javascript,

1385
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:20,230
but I found a vulnerability within the
myspace filters and within web browsers

1386
01:23:20,231 --> 01:23:24,250
that allowed me to inject javascript and
it's allowed me to just modify the page

1387
01:23:24,251 --> 01:23:28,750
more than you'd be able to. Um,
unfortunately my space gave a lot of, uh,

1388
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:31,480
creative freedom, uh, back then.

1389
01:23:31,481 --> 01:23:35,170
So you could actually make the page look
really ugly butt and not do things like

1390
01:23:35,171 --> 01:23:37,060
change the relationship
status like I wanted.

1391
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:41,920
So once I figured out I could do this,
I actually realized this,

1392
01:23:42,190 --> 01:23:44,380
this exploit I found is
actually extremely powerful.

1393
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:45,970
I can actually do a lot more.

1394
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:50,290
I can make the user do virtually
anything in the web browser. Uh,

1395
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:54,790
without their consent. I could, I
could in fact steal their bank details.

1396
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:58,770
I had no interest in their bank details,
but I could take their pink, you know,

1397
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:03,130
their bank details and have a
bunch of peoples bank information.

1398
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:06,220
So what I found was that whenever
someone visits my profile,

1399
01:24:06,221 --> 01:24:08,740
I could make it say in hot relationship.
And I was like, that's cool.

1400
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:11,620
What else can I do?
And I played around further and further.

1401
01:24:11,621 --> 01:24:15,460
And finally I realized,
well, I can actually, since
I can control their browser,

1402
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:18,460
I can make them add me as a friend.
It's kind of funny.

1403
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:22,060
So someone visits my profile and they're
not yet my friend, they just add me.

1404
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:25,450
So yeah, that's, you know, it's just
cute and just playing around on here.

1405
01:24:25,451 --> 01:24:28,570
It's a social network.
Um, and I thought, well,

1406
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:32,680
the next day I had like one new friend.
I was like, wow, that's not that cool.

1407
01:24:32,681 --> 01:24:35,830
Like what else can I do? And there's
different, there's different sections.

1408
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:39,160
For example, your favorite
books, movies, TV heroes.

1409
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:43,810
And I thought it'd be funny
if I added something. Uh,

1410
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:47,380
and there's this hero section. Most
people didn't use it, but some people did.

1411
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:52,450
And you could list your favorite heroes.
So someone who might have like, you know,

1412
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:54,770
uh,
Buddha and Tim Ferris,

1413
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:00,220
some people might not,
I'm not sure.

1414
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:06,790
So I found a way that when
someone would visit my profile,

1415
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:08,500
not only would they add me as a friend,

1416
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:12,370
but they would add me as a hero and it
wouldn't delete their existing heroes.

1417
01:25:12,430 --> 01:25:16,460
So if their heroes said, you know, my
mom, my dad and my grandma and say,

1418
01:25:16,461 --> 01:25:21,100
I mean it would add it with
a pen to the end. My Mom,

1419
01:25:21,101 --> 01:25:24,730
my dad and grandma. But most
of all, Sammy isn't a hero.

1420
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:30,320
They would append that to their hero
section. That was kind of funny. You know,

1421
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,380
this would happen to a couple people,
you know,

1422
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:37,150
show off to my nerd friends and
we'd get a laugh and that was that.

1423
01:25:37,690 --> 01:25:39,580
And the next day,
you know,

1424
01:25:39,581 --> 01:25:44,000
I had so few friends on there that one
person had hit it and one person had this

1425
01:25:44,001 --> 01:25:45,940
and it's like, man, how do I
make this go a little faster?

1426
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:49,510
I just want to show a few friends
like, Hey, I made 10 people say this,

1427
01:25:49,930 --> 01:25:51,970
I'm on their profile. So I thought, okay,

1428
01:25:51,971 --> 01:25:55,030
well if I could make someone added me as
a friend and I can make them add me as

1429
01:25:55,031 --> 01:25:57,760
a hero.
Well the codes on my profile,

1430
01:25:57,761 --> 01:26:01,600
I could probably make them add
the code to their profile. So Tim,

1431
01:26:01,601 --> 01:26:04,490
if he visited my profile, you add me
as a friend and I know he's a hero,

1432
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:09,290
but you'd also had to code
to your profile. If then
someone visited your profile,

1433
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:11,270
they would add me as a friend,

1434
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:15,200
added me as a hero and also the
code would go onto their profile.

1435
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:17,330
So it became a worm.

1436
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:21,950
I believe that's like the
technical definition of a
worm or a virus and it's not

1437
01:26:21,951 --> 01:26:25,550
a big, our worms and viruses different.
Ah, man, that's a good question.

1438
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:29,000
I'm not sure what the
technical difference is. Um,

1439
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:32,060
I think usually when they're,
when they're referred to,

1440
01:26:32,061 --> 01:26:34,860
at least online that I see,
you know, viruses or buyer,

1441
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:39,290
I are usually referred to when they're
kind of malicious and destructive and

1442
01:26:39,291 --> 01:26:43,280
worms or they just spread really quickly
and not necessarily with malicious

1443
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:47,600
intent, not necessarily with malicious
intent, but I guess there aren't too many,

1444
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:50,990
too many things out there that's
spread without malicious intent.

1445
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:54,050
Not to interrupt though. So, so,
all right. So you're like, Hey,

1446
01:26:54,051 --> 01:26:56,230
let me make this move a little faster.
Yeah.

1447
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:58,640
So I made it move a little faster
and I figured, okay, in a month,

1448
01:26:58,641 --> 01:26:59,870
maybe I'll have like 50,

1449
01:26:59,871 --> 01:27:04,640
50 new friends and heroes and someone will
complain rights as someone unintended,

1450
01:27:04,641 --> 01:27:08,490
we'll hit it and complain and
they'll my sniffles, we'll remove it.

1451
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:13,460
Sounds not like a big deal.
And I put it up, I put this,

1452
01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:16,070
this worm on my,
on my profile,

1453
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:20,260
and I woke up and thought I'd have
like probably four new friends. Um,

1454
01:27:20,330 --> 01:27:24,290
and I had 200 and I said,
oh shit.

1455
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:30,470
And I would, an hour later I had
another 200 and I said, oh no,

1456
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:34,520
because after eight hours it was
200 but it was exponential. So it's,

1457
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:36,220
at first I thought it was,
oh,

1458
01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:39,710
like going to be a thousand in a
day after I saw the 200 but now it's

1459
01:27:39,711 --> 01:27:44,420
exponential. An hour later I
had another 400 an hour later,

1460
01:27:44,421 --> 01:27:49,421
another 800 these are people who have a
add me as a friend and then be at same.

1461
01:27:50,181 --> 01:27:51,230
He's my hero to their profile.

1462
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:57,590
And then the worms spreads to them
and you know, it, it wasn't malicious,

1463
01:27:57,591 --> 01:28:01,460
right? There was no malicious intent.
It's clearly a prank gone wrong. Uh,

1464
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:03,290
and I didn't know what to do.

1465
01:28:03,470 --> 01:28:07,100
So immediately I emailed my space
anonymously and I said, hey,

1466
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:10,430
something weird just having it in
my profile. Someone just added me.

1467
01:28:10,431 --> 01:28:13,370
Their name is Sammy and
it says same as my hero.

1468
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:17,990
And I found this weird piece of code
that's on my profile and it seems to do

1469
01:28:17,991 --> 01:28:22,991
this detailed explanation of exactly what
this crazy big piece of code is doing.

1470
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:28,410
I'm no professional,
but here's my

1471
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:34,060
slice of code appears to be doing the
following 17 things I tend see, yeah,

1472
01:28:34,061 --> 01:28:36,200
if I had to make an assumption
about this off, he skated

1473
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:39,500
piece of worm,
um,

1474
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:44,030
and I think you can fix it most easily
and efficiently by doing this one simple

1475
01:28:44,031 --> 01:28:46,100
change.
This is what I'd suggest.

1476
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:49,670
One simple change to
stop it in its tracks.

1477
01:28:50,690 --> 01:28:54,500
I don't know if it ever got to anyone.
I have no idea to this day. Um,

1478
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:58,250
an hour later went by,
it doubled.

1479
01:28:58,910 --> 01:29:01,530
And I figured at some point
it's going to stop, right?

1480
01:29:01,531 --> 01:29:03,330
At some point you're going to hit your,
you know,

1481
01:29:03,331 --> 01:29:06,840
you're going to hit a maximum because
there are only so many people on my space,

1482
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:08,730
right, right. You can't get it twice.

1483
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,460
You can't get the cold twice
at the same time. Right.

1484
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,490
So you're going to hit a max
and that's going to be that.

1485
01:29:14,970 --> 01:29:17,130
So at about a thousand hours,

1486
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:21,330
I think it was gonna Max out
and I get to work and it's 2000,

1487
01:29:21,930 --> 01:29:23,790
and I'm just refreshing.
And I'm like, man, okay,

1488
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:26,220
I should at least deep delete
my profile. It was like, man,

1489
01:29:26,221 --> 01:29:30,270
I should delete the worm. So I immediately
delete the word, but like a cold,

1490
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:33,300
you might be cured, but you
spread it. It doesn't matter.

1491
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:36,300
All these other people don't have
it and you can't stop that. Um,

1492
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:37,740
for a moment I thought,
okay,

1493
01:29:37,741 --> 01:29:42,741
maybe I should like red another worm that
then go transmits to all these people

1494
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:46,920
and then deletes the first one.
I thought I shouldn't write to worms.

1495
01:29:46,921 --> 01:29:50,970
And like a 24 hour period. That's another,
I don't think that's a good idea. Uh,

1496
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:57,000
so I just kind of waited around and I,
I did send that an anonymous email.

1497
01:29:57,001 --> 01:30:01,590
I tried to get it to stop.
There's nothing, not much I
could do at that point. Uh,

1498
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:05,800
I did, oh wait, wait more, you know,

1499
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:10,910
jumped to 2000 and then 4,000 and 8,000
it's now there's 8,000 people that says,

1500
01:30:11,131 --> 01:30:11,381
Sam,

1501
01:30:11,381 --> 01:30:15,300
he is my hero on their profile and now
I'm getting messages from people because

1502
01:30:15,330 --> 01:30:18,180
they're deleting me. They're like, Oh,
who's this Sammy Guy who's on my profile?

1503
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:22,230
So the delete me, which when you
delete a profile in my space,

1504
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:24,930
it immediately takes you back to
your profile where the code is,

1505
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:29,280
which reextend every adds me
there must have loved that.

1506
01:30:29,310 --> 01:30:33,950
And that was an accident. But I mean
in software you call it by, you know,

1507
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:34,860
a feature when you,

1508
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:38,160
when you have a nice accident like
that so you can't delete it really.

1509
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,660
And it's spreading further and further
and further. And I don't know what to do.

1510
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:46,800
Just a 19 year old kid trying
to build some software,

1511
01:30:46,801 --> 01:30:50,370
the voip company and voiceover Ip.
And uh,

1512
01:30:50,550 --> 01:30:53,160
they just kept going and I
decided, okay, I'm going to have,

1513
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:56,880
I called my girlfriend at the time. I
said, hey, let's have lunch. It's like,

1514
01:30:56,910 --> 01:31:01,800
what's wrong? I was like,
I just want to see you.

1515
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:07,710
So we had lunch and I said that, I don't
know what's going to happen, but, um,

1516
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:13,920
this worm thing happened on my space
and it's been growing pretty quick.

1517
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:15,060
Um,

1518
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:20,040
and also there's this company called Fox
that had purchased my space maybe two

1519
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:24,340
months prior for over half
a billion dollars. Um,

1520
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:27,350
so I don't know what's going to
happen. I don't know if, you know,

1521
01:31:27,450 --> 01:31:31,350
Mr Murdoch was very happy about
this, uh, in his brand new company.

1522
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:35,670
So I had lunch with my girlfriend and
went back to work and now it's probably

1523
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:41,150
40,000 people, 40,000 people infected
with this, and I'm just like, my space,

1524
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:44,430
please stop. So I'm like, okay, at least
let me delete my profile. So I just,

1525
01:31:44,431 --> 01:31:47,040
picture has gone and I deleted.
And it says,

1526
01:31:47,041 --> 01:31:49,470
are you sure you wanted to leave
profiles? Like, yes. It's like,

1527
01:31:49,471 --> 01:31:53,190
are you absolutely sure you cannot
undo this? I was like, yes. Like, okay,

1528
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:58,320
we are deleting your profile in 24
hours and watch how all these people are

1529
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:02,140
still the profile still fully up.
I can't do anything about it.

1530
01:32:02,141 --> 01:32:06,370
It's locked now and online. I say, okay,

1531
01:32:06,371 --> 01:32:11,290
I just have to wait it out.
Literally waited out. So by
just sit through the day,

1532
01:32:11,330 --> 01:32:16,030
I can't really do much,
can't really think clearly and by uh,

1533
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:20,710
by the time work is done I'm like,
it's probably time to go home. I have,

1534
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:21,633
I don't know,

1535
01:32:21,850 --> 01:32:26,170
half a million followers on my
space now that all say same.

1536
01:32:26,171 --> 01:32:29,680
He's my hero man.
I go home and before I go home,

1537
01:32:29,681 --> 01:32:33,880
like it's probably my last meal.
So I go to AAA, have a Burrito,

1538
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:39,200
it's could be my last like delicious
dinner and I drive home and I drive home.

1539
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:44,380
I opened the browser 900,000 and like,
oh my God,

1540
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:47,320
I didn't even know there were this many
people on my space. This is insane.

1541
01:32:48,190 --> 01:32:50,710
This point,
our refresh.

1542
01:32:50,711 --> 01:32:54,100
And now I'm just purely interested
in how quickly is it growing.

1543
01:32:54,730 --> 01:32:58,510
So now refreshing every second. It was
like, I'll take a snapshot every second,

1544
01:32:58,511 --> 01:33:00,370
but browsers in load that fast back then.

1545
01:33:00,371 --> 01:33:04,960
So I take a snapshot every three seconds
and it was going two or 3000 people per

1546
01:33:04,961 --> 01:33:09,480
second that fast. I mean,
it was insanity. Uh,

1547
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:14,980
and it hit a million. I took
a screenshot, just say, okay,

1548
01:33:14,981 --> 01:33:19,750
cool. Still scared. Don't know what
to do. I have nothing to do. I mean,

1549
01:33:20,230 --> 01:33:22,050
there's no way to stop this.
I made it.

1550
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:25,900
I made a horrible mistake where I created
a monster. I have great imposter. Yes.

1551
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:31,930
And at about a million, you know, 50,000.

1552
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,940
I refresh my profile and says, this
profile has been taken down and I say,

1553
01:33:36,941 --> 01:33:41,800
Hallelujah, it's guys down. They took
it down. Thank you. And uh, I was like,

1554
01:33:41,801 --> 01:33:44,950
I wonder what happened to the profiles
that also said, Sam, he's my hero.

1555
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:46,030
I wonder if they removed it.

1556
01:33:46,090 --> 01:33:50,230
So I go to another profile says this
profile has been taken down temporarily.

1557
01:33:50,470 --> 01:33:53,090
Oh No,
it's,

1558
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:56,230
I go to myspace.com the site is down,

1559
01:33:56,350 --> 01:33:58,990
the whole team here is here working on it.
That's what it said,

1560
01:33:59,290 --> 01:34:02,050
the number one website
on the Internet in 2005.

1561
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:06,070
And I felt bad. I felt, I
felt awful because, hey,

1562
01:34:06,190 --> 01:34:09,460
I know what it's like to have a website,
a company that's down.

1563
01:34:09,730 --> 01:34:11,170
I know what that's like.
It's awful.

1564
01:34:11,171 --> 01:34:14,290
It's an awful feeling and emotion that
I would never want to put onto someone

1565
01:34:14,291 --> 01:34:18,040
else. And I had done that inadvertently.
Um, so immediately I'm like,

1566
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:21,640
I need to bring coffee and donuts to
these people because they're in la.

1567
01:34:21,670 --> 01:34:24,370
I'm in La. I'm like, maybe I
shouldn't go there and just start,

1568
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:27,180
maybe we shouldn't go there right now.
Um,

1569
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:30,790
I don't know if security is going
to tackle me or what, but I can't.

1570
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:35,810
So I just sat around and a day went by and
a week went by, I thought, okay, I have,

1571
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:40,240
I have two options. Maybe
I can, you know, uh, I,

1572
01:34:40,241 --> 01:34:43,750
I mean I can talk about this or not
and I didn't really say much about it.

1573
01:34:43,751 --> 01:34:48,440
And someone emailed me and said, hey,
I saw this thing on my space, this is,

1574
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:51,670
did you make this?
And I couldn't really hide because hey,

1575
01:34:51,671 --> 01:34:55,870
I wasn't trying to be anonymous. It was
a prank. They gone horribly wrong. And,

1576
01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:58,850
uh, I said, sure.

1577
01:34:58,850 --> 01:35:03,080
And I did a little interview and I did
an interview for a couple of different

1578
01:35:03,081 --> 01:35:06,500
web thing, you know, little
websites and someone was like, Hey,

1579
01:35:06,501 --> 01:35:08,930
you want to do the interview for,
for our site? And it's like, sure.

1580
01:35:08,931 --> 01:35:12,260
Like who's it for? And they're like
wired. And I'm like, Oh, uh, I dunno.

1581
01:35:14,110 --> 01:35:19,010
And I heard that you guys have
heard of you guys. Yeah. And it,

1582
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:22,000
I never heard from my space.
Um,

1583
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:25,070
and a week went by and two weeks went
by and someone asked, hey, you know,

1584
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:27,440
people are selling shirts that say same.
He's my hero.

1585
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:33,440
I like, that is awesome. And like, you
know, you making money off that like, no,

1586
01:35:33,441 --> 01:35:34,280
but that's okay.

1587
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:38,510
A good in my book.

1588
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:44,420
And a month goes by, two months,
three months go by and I'm, you know,

1589
01:35:44,421 --> 01:35:48,650
I'm, I'm pretty stoked. Um, you know,
I'd be comfortable in free and the free,

1590
01:35:48,651 --> 01:35:51,800
I'm feeling great. Like
never doing that again. Uh,

1591
01:35:53,930 --> 01:35:56,990
and a six months go by and I said,
you know,

1592
01:35:57,470 --> 01:36:01,670
I just bought a new car
and company's doing well.

1593
01:36:01,671 --> 01:36:04,520
And at this point I,
I walked down to my car,

1594
01:36:04,950 --> 01:36:07,190
I'm gonna drive to work today
and six months later from them,

1595
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:11,870
from the worm and as you guys standing
next to my car and I'm like, oh no,

1596
01:36:12,290 --> 01:36:16,430
I'm getting carjacked.
And I walk up to them and they're like,

1597
01:36:16,431 --> 01:36:21,020
Sammy the same, my name Sammy. And I
said, no, carjackers only now your name

1598
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:26,420
and two guys behind. Very
well educated. Carjack yeah,

1599
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:32,450
no, it's all on my license plate.
And two other guys come up behind me.

1600
01:36:32,770 --> 01:36:36,680
Let me see Sammy, we have
a, we have a search warrant
for you. And was like, what?

1601
01:36:36,770 --> 01:36:40,700
And they all show me badges and
one shows me secret service.

1602
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:45,320
One shows me electronics crimes
task force and other shows. Me, uh,

1603
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:48,560
district attorney La Da,
uh, another shows me,

1604
01:36:48,561 --> 01:36:51,360
it was LAPD is a,

1605
01:36:51,410 --> 01:36:54,140
we have a search warrant and
I don't know anything about,

1606
01:36:54,170 --> 01:36:56,870
I don't know why they think the law,
anything about law or search warrant.

1607
01:36:56,871 --> 01:37:01,010
I'm a high school dropout. Right. I
served maybe one year in high school,

1608
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:06,710
served like a prison
sentence. I did, I did,

1609
01:37:06,711 --> 01:37:10,220
but a bunch of homework and
did some of the tests and

1610
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:16,880
they said, we have the search warrant
and I just, he don't like what can I do?

1611
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,670
What can I do? And I recalled an
episode of 24 where they said,

1612
01:37:19,671 --> 01:37:23,930
show me the search warrants. So I
said, show me the search warrant.

1613
01:37:23,931 --> 01:37:27,380
I don't know if that actually applies
and law or if it was like CGI.

1614
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:32,660
Excuse me. They're like,
wait, what? Oh, okay.

1615
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:34,880
It's upstairs. I was like, oh, okay.

1616
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:39,440
And they started talking to me and they
didn't mention any specifics and I was

1617
01:37:39,441 --> 01:37:42,320
hoping it was,
my space actually had points.

1618
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:47,050
So he was a hacker. You play around,
you know, you play around anything,

1619
01:37:47,090 --> 01:37:49,400
you go through different things that
maybe you're not supposed to go into.

1620
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:51,980
Never malicious,
never like causing harm,

1621
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:55,010
but you want to see what you can
get into. It's a puzzle. It's a,

1622
01:37:55,170 --> 01:37:59,130
an real world applicable puzzle.
Um, what you can break into.

1623
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:02,670
And after about half an hour,
I'm like, guys, you know,

1624
01:38:02,671 --> 01:38:04,590
do your search and not going to obstruct.

1625
01:38:04,650 --> 01:38:08,360
Just show me the search warrant and
do your thing. Um, so we go upstairs,

1626
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:11,480
these four guys and me and uh,

1627
01:38:11,790 --> 01:38:16,790
we walk up to my place and my girlfriends
in it wrapped in a sheet crying and my

1628
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:19,260
roommate is in your
apartment? My apartment? Yeah,

1629
01:38:19,261 --> 01:38:23,090
man apartment at the time in the,
in the Marina del Rey and my,

1630
01:38:23,390 --> 01:38:27,210
my roommates. Good friend of mine,
like naked, weeping girlfriend.

1631
01:38:28,070 --> 01:38:30,750
Good start. And my roommate,
he's an a bath towel.

1632
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:35,490
But what is going on here and verse?
I suspect it's something,

1633
01:38:35,491 --> 01:38:37,800
but other than that,
she's, she's, you know,

1634
01:38:38,310 --> 01:38:43,310
she was in bed in my room and he was in
the shower getting ready for work when a

1635
01:38:44,581 --> 01:38:48,600
dozen agents busted into my
apartment that I had not known.

1636
01:38:49,050 --> 01:38:52,140
So while I was going down,
while you were done with the car,

1637
01:38:52,141 --> 01:38:55,440
they were already going into the
apartment while I was downstairs.

1638
01:38:55,470 --> 01:38:58,500
Unbeknownst to me, they were in my
apartment going through everything

1639
01:39:00,690 --> 01:39:04,140
and they finally handed me the search
warrant and I read through it and they

1640
01:39:04,141 --> 01:39:06,540
finally mentioned something of
my space and I was like, okay,

1641
01:39:06,541 --> 01:39:10,920
it's my space related obviously.
Uh, and after that there,

1642
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:13,180
they just went through
everything and from, you know,

1643
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:16,710
my roommates and girlfriends respected
to date, just came in with guns.

1644
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:21,120
It finally, finally something
in the movie hackers was a real,

1645
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:25,440
like a dozen agents busting
into your place to, you know,

1646
01:39:25,530 --> 01:39:30,300
get a computer crime guy with a bunch
of, you know, s semiautomatic weapons.

1647
01:39:30,870 --> 01:39:34,920
And, uh, I watch it, what am,
what am I going to do with
like a DVD, like note aid,

1648
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:36,803
I'm not sure.

1649
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:40,530
But they had the search warrant and it
said they could pretty much take anything

1650
01:39:40,531 --> 01:39:45,240
that had data on it. So they went through
my, they took my computer, my laptop,

1651
01:39:45,241 --> 01:39:49,500
my iPod, my x box, any cds, DVDs,

1652
01:39:51,690 --> 01:39:55,980
and sat me down and I'm reading the
search warrant further and further.

1653
01:39:57,030 --> 01:40:01,350
And finally it comes to this part
and it says they can search my body,

1654
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:06,750
my car, my, my home. And this other
address, like what's this address?

1655
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:10,910
Oh No, my company, and at this point is,

1656
01:40:10,911 --> 01:40:14,890
is two years in, probably had 30
employees and investors, we hit,

1657
01:40:14,980 --> 01:40:16,170
there's a legitimate company,

1658
01:40:16,930 --> 01:40:20,610
a legitimate tech startup that company's
depended on for their phone service lot,

1659
01:40:20,611 --> 01:40:24,330
the, a decent number of companies
dependent on us. And I was like,

1660
01:40:24,331 --> 01:40:28,470
you guys are going to my company. And
they're like, no, we're already there.

1661
01:40:29,710 --> 01:40:31,560
Now, I never, I never
knew this, but you know,

1662
01:40:31,561 --> 01:40:34,170
I heard this second hand from 20 people,

1663
01:40:34,860 --> 01:40:38,730
but simultaneously and other dozen
agents went to my company and said,

1664
01:40:39,290 --> 01:40:44,040
who runs this place? And Chris,
the CEO came out and he said, uh,

1665
01:40:44,041 --> 01:40:48,410
and they said, what does Sammy Kamkar
have access to? And he said, well, yeah,

1666
01:40:48,411 --> 01:40:51,840
he's cofounder, I mean everything. And
the guy looks back to another agent, says,

1667
01:40:51,841 --> 01:40:56,060
all right guys, take.
And I'm like, no. Right.

1668
01:40:56,290 --> 01:40:59,920
I don't know what Chris did, but
he, I don't know what he did,

1669
01:41:00,070 --> 01:41:04,250
but for two hours he somehow,
and Chris is,

1670
01:41:04,340 --> 01:41:07,950
I mean he like mentored me for
years and I mean the Chris Lyman,

1671
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:09,390
this guy's awesome and uh,

1672
01:41:09,400 --> 01:41:12,760
taught me so much about are not the
droids you're looking for her. Yeah.

1673
01:41:13,210 --> 01:41:16,300
I don't know what magic he
is because I didn't have any,

1674
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:21,850
but he got them to ultimately not
take the server room and turned down

1675
01:41:21,851 --> 01:41:24,700
essentially all these companies that are
depending on a phone system for their

1676
01:41:24,701 --> 01:41:27,730
company that are, uh,
you know, call centers.

1677
01:41:28,510 --> 01:41:30,700
They didn't take down all of these
companies call centers. Instead,

1678
01:41:30,701 --> 01:41:35,701
they just took my computer and
my phone and put everyone in a,

1679
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:39,040
put. Everyone in the conference room
had guns out and said, you know,

1680
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:42,100
he'd get off that
keyboard. Terrifying. Yeah.

1681
01:41:42,210 --> 01:41:44,410
A friend of mine who was his first day.
It was that his,

1682
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:48,250
one of my best friends is actually,
I didn't, I met him online. Well,

1683
01:41:48,251 --> 01:41:52,240
like we met online and it like a form
or something and he emailed me and what

1684
01:41:52,241 --> 01:41:55,170
did you do today?
What did you do?

1685
01:41:56,420 --> 01:42:01,350
That's the most interesting thing
is let me tell you a story. Um,

1686
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:02,980
and I said,
I actually,

1687
01:42:02,981 --> 01:42:07,981
I convinced him to leave his job in Denver
and he came out with a u haul to come

1688
01:42:08,591 --> 01:42:12,180
work at my company. And I said, hey,
while you're, while you're, uh, you know,

1689
01:42:12,190 --> 01:42:14,800
come stay at my place.
So I was actually crashing at my place.

1690
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:18,610
He didn't run to the secret service
because we had in my apartment complex,

1691
01:42:18,611 --> 01:42:22,090
we had to, uh, to play two garages,

1692
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:23,980
one for guests and one for residence.

1693
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:27,070
So I went to the residence where they
were waiting, he went to the guests,

1694
01:42:27,130 --> 01:42:29,830
drove to work, didn't know anyone.
It was his first day. It was Monday.

1695
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:34,390
So he goes to like shake his
hand to someone and she's like,

1696
01:42:34,391 --> 01:42:37,390
hand off the mouse and keyboard.
Go in the conference room.

1697
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:40,240
Secret Service and he's like,

1698
01:42:40,241 --> 01:42:44,230
what he is as you haul out the
back format with all this crap,

1699
01:42:44,470 --> 01:42:46,570
all his crap,
he just quit his job,

1700
01:42:46,690 --> 01:42:50,950
drove out from Denver to this company,

1701
01:42:50,951 --> 01:42:54,730
you know that he met me once. It's
like JT, Marlin and associates.

1702
01:42:56,260 --> 01:42:58,570
I hear this boiler room
here, this, you know,

1703
01:42:58,571 --> 01:43:02,230
later on because he's like not
talking to me for a little bit.

1704
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:06,060
Come down to this company that he
thinks is getting shut down here.

1705
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:10,750
No one has any idea why a dozen
agents are at their company. Nobody.

1706
01:43:10,810 --> 01:43:15,270
They just know that my name was said
they took my computer and they left, um,

1707
01:43:15,670 --> 01:43:16,440
poor guy.

1708
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:20,440
So he didn't know what the thing I
explained to Terry wine and it was like,

1709
01:43:20,470 --> 01:43:24,620
oh yeah, that's weird. That's
funny. But unexpected. And,

1710
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:28,180
uh, I, so they took my computer.

1711
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:30,490
Worst part was the Dick my iPod.

1712
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:34,150
That was probably the worst because all
my music was on my computer and my iPod

1713
01:43:34,151 --> 01:43:36,220
and it's just really hard
to get music back then.

1714
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:42,400
So I then got a lawyer and you know,

1715
01:43:42,401 --> 01:43:46,800
for six months I fought with the DA
and, uh, I, you know, I was, pardon me.

1716
01:43:46,801 --> 01:43:48,110
It was like, well, you know, I,

1717
01:43:48,111 --> 01:43:52,580
I think it was a bit much, right? I did,

1718
01:43:52,581 --> 01:43:54,830
I did something wrong and this is
no doubt about that. I, you know,

1719
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:58,790
I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that
again. And uh, but they were being,

1720
01:43:58,880 --> 01:43:59,780
it was very harsh.

1721
01:44:00,170 --> 01:44:04,070
I felt it was very harsh and what they
were trying to do was to take away my

1722
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:07,700
computer use for the rest of my life
for the rest of your life in my life.

1723
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:11,900
So again, I didn't have a
high school diploma. Uh, I,

1724
01:44:12,650 --> 01:44:17,180
you know, I help my mom, like
I send money to my mom. Uh,

1725
01:44:17,450 --> 01:44:21,070
you know, I moved out when I was
15 and I think, you know, I've,

1726
01:44:21,071 --> 01:44:24,080
I've foraged emancipation
documents so I could actually live,

1727
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:28,040
live by myself and sign up,
get a cell phone in her apartment,

1728
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:32,610
and I had just to support myself and
help support her a little. And, uh,

1729
01:44:33,530 --> 01:44:37,040
so I couldn't do anything.
Like, if I conduct computers,
I don't know what I'd do.

1730
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:41,120
I'd have to, I dunno,
finished high school.

1731
01:44:41,690 --> 01:44:44,450
I just got an imagine that in
this day and age also, I mean,

1732
01:44:44,451 --> 01:44:47,240
just with the exponential
growth of these technologies,

1733
01:44:47,241 --> 01:44:52,241
it's like how can you possibly
avoid touching a computer?

1734
01:44:52,341 --> 01:44:52,910
I mean,
you wouldn't,

1735
01:44:52,910 --> 01:44:57,910
you would have to just go into a
live in Pennsylvania with the Amish.

1736
01:44:59,380 --> 01:45:02,780
Yeah, yeah. Um, so they,

1737
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:06,800
they were trying to take away your
access to computers for this year of your

1738
01:45:06,830 --> 01:45:07,780
natural life.
Uh,

1739
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:10,610
I mean at first it was like they were
talking about prison and all of these

1740
01:45:10,611 --> 01:45:14,780
things. I don't know if they're scaring
me or what, but, um, ultimately, you know,

1741
01:45:14,781 --> 01:45:15,560
I had a choice I'd do to,

1742
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:18,260
I could like spend a lot of time and a
lot more money fighting it. You know,

1743
01:45:18,261 --> 01:45:22,940
he'd spent all my savings. It was 19 to
to fight this and get a good lawyer. And,

1744
01:45:23,450 --> 01:45:24,050
uh,

1745
01:45:24,050 --> 01:45:28,940
ultimately we were able to come to an
arrangement and that was an agreement

1746
01:45:28,941 --> 01:45:33,080
where I would not be able to use computers
for the rest of my life. However,

1747
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:37,460
I would go on Bay probation and I would
visit her probation officer once a week.

1748
01:45:37,730 --> 01:45:41,630
And if I were on good behavior, I would
be able to get that reduced and again,

1749
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:44,970
be able to get her potentially
even removed. And it was really,

1750
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:45,980
it was within reason.

1751
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:49,850
It was like if I don't commit any
crimes or releasing any other worms,

1752
01:45:50,150 --> 01:45:54,440
then I would be able to get that
removed. After a few years, it was like,

1753
01:45:54,770 --> 01:45:56,390
okay,
that's reasonable.

1754
01:45:56,630 --> 01:46:01,040
I could focus on my company right now.
I had at that point,

1755
01:46:01,070 --> 01:46:02,870
it was bigger.
It was another six months later.

1756
01:46:02,871 --> 01:46:07,070
And I had a team and I could communicate
with my team every day and I could

1757
01:46:07,071 --> 01:46:10,560
actually work without necessarily using
the internet and doing that much, uh,

1758
01:46:10,561 --> 01:46:14,690
on the Internet and, um,
you know, computers, um,

1759
01:46:14,990 --> 01:46:16,010
and just manage right.

1760
01:46:16,011 --> 01:46:20,420
And that point I kind of just
manage and I took it, uh,

1761
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:24,890
that agreement. And after three years
I went back to court and I said, Hey,

1762
01:46:25,190 --> 01:46:30,080
my probation officer loves me.
I paid all my restitution.

1763
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:35,150
I've done my 720 hours of community
service picking up trash. Uh,

1764
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:38,900
and because of some, you know,
they didn't document it properly,

1765
01:46:38,901 --> 01:46:40,910
so I did another extra few hours.
You're welcome.

1766
01:46:43,310 --> 01:46:48,170
Like 800 hour go slam.
That's all. I was like,

1767
01:46:48,171 --> 01:46:53,100
wait, what? Oh Man. All this time.

1768
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:58,230
5:00 AM every Saturday. You know, it
means, I didn't know. It was awful.

1769
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:03,170
It was tough. You have to
wear an orange jumpsuit. Yes,

1770
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:07,620
it was. I would, I would
park, I would park my car,

1771
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:12,930
put it in an orange jumpsuit at 6:00
AM and then walk to the waist refuse

1772
01:47:12,931 --> 01:47:16,320
management facility. Um, I made
friends with the guys who ran it there.

1773
01:47:16,321 --> 01:47:19,830
They were actually pretty cool.
And I would, because they liked me,

1774
01:47:19,831 --> 01:47:23,700
they would let me go on the trash runs
where we would drive around Santa Monica.

1775
01:47:23,790 --> 01:47:26,020
And that means we've got to say that,
see the ocean a lot and driving,

1776
01:47:26,410 --> 01:47:30,040
driving a dump truck,
basically picking up trash. Uh,

1777
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:32,610
you think I'd be able to like
help more effectively. You know,

1778
01:47:32,650 --> 01:47:37,430
I'd be happy to help in other ways. But
uh, that was the task lead before you.

1779
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:40,650
Yeah. So you did your community
service, your restitution.

1780
01:47:41,370 --> 01:47:46,230
So after three years I went back to court,
I went back to court and uh, you know,

1781
01:47:46,350 --> 01:47:51,350
I said I'm a model computer not
touching the citizen and uh,

1782
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:54,390
I would love to get,
get some of that access back and you know,

1783
01:47:54,391 --> 01:47:58,500
we got everything removed and uh,
I was able to touch computers again,

1784
01:47:58,590 --> 01:48:01,980
just kind of randomly one
day everything came back.

1785
01:48:02,430 --> 01:48:06,390
I could touch computers, I wasn't
a felon, I had no more probation,

1786
01:48:06,391 --> 01:48:08,010
I had no more community service.

1787
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:12,690
Now what was it like after three
years in technological time

1788
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:17,880
to
get back up to speed?

1789
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:22,470
I was probably 22 or 23
at this point and I was,

1790
01:48:22,471 --> 01:48:25,920
I think a is really cool because
it was very fortunate. Um,

1791
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:27,360
the thing that I had exploited,

1792
01:48:27,390 --> 01:48:32,370
the thing that I had exploited when I
wrote the worm was something called Ajax

1793
01:48:32,371 --> 01:48:36,510
or some term called web 2.0.
And I don't know if you remember,

1794
01:48:36,511 --> 01:48:41,511
but this was right when Google maps
came out before we had mapquest.

1795
01:48:41,730 --> 01:48:44,100
And what would happen on mapquest? You'd
go somewhere, he'd make directions.

1796
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:47,130
And if you want to like zoom out,
you click a button and you'd,

1797
01:48:47,460 --> 01:48:48,570
it would refresh the page.

1798
01:48:48,571 --> 01:48:52,260
You had to click the plus or the minus
actually huge pain in the ass and the

1799
01:48:52,261 --> 01:48:55,830
page would refresh. And like if you want
to go right, you couldn't scroll right,

1800
01:48:55,860 --> 01:49:00,120
you'd hit it right. What
does Ajax asynchronous helped
me out here? No, leave.

1801
01:49:00,121 --> 01:49:03,150
It's asynchronous Java's giants,

1802
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:08,460
Aix, Aix, Armani exchange.

1803
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:17,490
I believe that's camex art rx.
Sorry. It's American Express.

1804
01:49:19,030 --> 01:49:21,400
Um,
so,

1805
01:49:21,530 --> 01:49:26,300
so were you able to catch up quickly
after that? Well, so, so the, the,

1806
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:29,700
the warm that I wrote
actually abused or used Ajax,

1807
01:49:29,730 --> 01:49:33,540
because I saw a Google maps came
out and you could scroll your map.

1808
01:49:34,230 --> 01:49:37,920
It was amazing. You could scroll, you
didn't have to refresh the page every one,

1809
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:39,120
every time you went to go.
Right.

1810
01:49:39,150 --> 01:49:41,790
This was the coolest thing on
the web at that point. Yeah.

1811
01:49:41,791 --> 01:49:46,260
And for people listening who may
not be familiar with the term Ajax,

1812
01:49:46,261 --> 01:49:47,320
and please correct me if I'm wrong,

1813
01:49:47,321 --> 01:49:50,980
I've had plenty of wine and which leads
to overconfidence and matters of my

1814
01:49:50,981 --> 01:49:55,690
total incompetence. Uh, but Ajax
would be, for instance, where you,

1815
01:49:56,410 --> 01:49:59,590
you select from a dropdown,
an item,

1816
01:49:59,591 --> 01:50:03,670
let's say if you're buying a domain
name and you're able to see that value

1817
01:50:03,671 --> 01:50:06,460
change on the page without
refreshing the page. Exactly.

1818
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:09,220
That'd be a consumer experience
of Ajax, right? Right.

1819
01:50:09,221 --> 01:50:10,930
It used to be you have the refresh,

1820
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:15,010
you might hear the click right whenever
that information would get refreshed and

1821
01:50:15,011 --> 01:50:19,060
now you can just seamlessly get new
information on your page updating without

1822
01:50:19,061 --> 01:50:23,580
you changing pages. Right. Without the
whole thing. Refreshing. Uh, it was,

1823
01:50:23,730 --> 01:50:26,590
it was beautiful and I use that so that,

1824
01:50:27,010 --> 01:50:29,860
because I could write the worm in a
way that it would refresh the page,

1825
01:50:29,861 --> 01:50:32,310
but that's just annoying.
I want to happen in the background.

1826
01:50:32,330 --> 01:50:34,870
The user shouldn't be bothered that
there's a virus turning on their computer.

1827
01:50:35,710 --> 01:50:40,330
It should just happen, you know,
seamlessly. She'd be very comfortable.

1828
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:43,380
Infiltration.
It's an,

1829
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:48,370
it didn't cause them harm or annoyance,
then a man that clicks annoying. Uh,

1830
01:50:48,371 --> 01:50:52,250
so that was Ajax. And by the time
it came back to computers, uh,

1831
01:50:52,251 --> 01:50:57,070
this was three years later,
something had come out called drum roll.

1832
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:03,170
The iPhone. Ah, nothing had
changed between then. I mean, for,

1833
01:51:03,171 --> 01:51:04,004
for the most part,

1834
01:51:04,180 --> 01:51:09,180
the biggest technologies
to hit tech was web 2.02,

1835
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:15,460
three years later I phone.
So I came back,

1836
01:51:15,461 --> 01:51:20,050
I was standing in line at of the
grove waiting for the iPhone.

1837
01:51:20,790 --> 01:51:25,660
So you really, you really, uh,
in a way threaded the needle.

1838
01:51:25,661 --> 01:51:27,970
I mean you really, you, you came,

1839
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:33,280
you exited and then re entered the scene
in such a way that you really didn't

1840
01:51:33,281 --> 01:51:36,940
miss a lot of the major
developments. Yeah. I wish I
could say that was by design,

1841
01:51:36,941 --> 01:51:40,300
but, well, what is it? I,

1842
01:51:40,301 --> 01:51:44,470
if I could be good or lucky, I'll
take lucky. Right. But I will,

1843
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:49,290
I will say this, um, you know,
before then I was, I was, you know,

1844
01:51:50,610 --> 01:51:54,790
really introverted.
I was an introverted nerd and I'm still,

1845
01:51:54,791 --> 01:51:59,140
I'm still a nerd and I love that.
But those three years,

1846
01:51:59,590 --> 01:52:01,350
I wasn't allowed to touch computers.

1847
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:04,630
The thing that I spent my night and day
ever since I was nine years old and got

1848
01:52:04,631 --> 01:52:08,830
kicked out of a chat room, um,
that, that changed my life, right?

1849
01:52:08,831 --> 01:52:11,860
I had to spend my time doing something
else. So during the day I was working,

1850
01:52:11,861 --> 01:52:15,130
but then, you know, that at that
point I was 20. I turned 21.

1851
01:52:15,550 --> 01:52:19,090
So I started going out and uh,
then I started going, you know,

1852
01:52:19,091 --> 01:52:23,680
making friends and communicating
and socializing. Uh, you know,

1853
01:52:23,990 --> 01:52:28,840
I went out and I said, oh, what is that
thing? What's that bright thing? Ah,

1854
01:52:29,020 --> 01:52:30,050
oh,
it's a son.

1855
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:34,170
They're going outside and doing all
these outdoors things and I, you know,

1856
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:35,860
learned about what a gym was.

1857
01:52:35,861 --> 01:52:38,890
And I did these things because
I had nothing else to do. Right.

1858
01:52:39,610 --> 01:52:42,550
The one thing was taken away. I mean,
they took my, they took my Xbox.

1859
01:52:42,940 --> 01:52:46,790
That's not cool. I was like, okay, let's,
let's roll with it. Right. And I think

1860
01:52:48,290 --> 01:52:50,810
life is good, right? Like life
is good no matter what. I mean,

1861
01:52:50,811 --> 01:52:55,010
at least here in the u s I feel
pretty fortunate. So let's, uh,

1862
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:59,780
let's, we have other facilities
available to us, so let's use those now.

1863
01:52:59,781 --> 01:53:04,310
Cam Card just for those people wondering.
Ethnic background is Iranian.

1864
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:07,120
So yeah, my mom is from Iran. Um,

1865
01:53:07,580 --> 01:53:09,810
my dad is

1866
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:16,310
from Dubai but also Iranian and they
came to the Pittsburgh to study.

1867
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:20,570
They came to view or, um, down
the street, university of Pitt,

1868
01:53:21,290 --> 01:53:26,000
Pittsburgh. Uh, I would have suggested
Carnegie Mellon. What were the tech?

1869
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:30,440
Um, and my dad I I
believe was business. Uh,

1870
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:35,040
my mom, I'm not telecommunications,
I think. Got It.

1871
01:53:35,710 --> 01:53:39,530
And ultimately, how do they
choose Pittsburgh of all places?

1872
01:53:39,531 --> 01:53:43,790
And that's a great question. I have no
idea. What are the unsolved mysteries?

1873
01:53:44,050 --> 01:53:46,820
Alright, yeah. Well, one of
these things, I mean, little,

1874
01:53:46,850 --> 01:53:51,170
little kept secret about Pittsburgh.
Good sandwiches,

1875
01:53:51,370 --> 01:53:53,000
good sandwiches. It's like, Oh,

1876
01:53:53,001 --> 01:53:57,290
you haven at Princeton for all those
Princetonians listening. But yeah,

1877
01:53:57,291 --> 01:53:59,140
they went to school there
and my dad, uh, you know,

1878
01:53:59,150 --> 01:54:04,100
my dad left when I was
younger and uh, yeah, so, so

1879
01:54:06,130 --> 01:54:09,890
they're from Iran. I was born like a
year later after they came, came here,

1880
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:12,710
my mom was like probably 20.
Um,

1881
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:17,480
and we kind of young and I
grew up in Pittsburgh. What,

1882
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:20,960
uh,
or say who,

1883
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:24,470
who are some of the people,
whether you met them or not,

1884
01:54:24,471 --> 01:54:29,240
who most influenced your trajectory
through life besides your parents?

1885
01:54:30,850 --> 01:54:34,740
Um, it's a good question.
Uh, I would say, you know,

1886
01:54:34,750 --> 01:54:38,510
it changes over time. Um, I mean I love,

1887
01:54:38,810 --> 01:54:41,960
there's so many people out there who've
done amazing things or even just have a

1888
01:54:41,961 --> 01:54:46,040
really cool perspective of the
world. So, uh, I tried to, if I can,

1889
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:48,980
if I'm fortunate enough, I tried to glean
some information for people when I can.

1890
01:54:49,450 --> 01:54:53,240
I say it started when I really,
you know,

1891
01:54:53,270 --> 01:54:57,560
the available information on the
Internet, right? Just Internet itself. Um,

1892
01:54:58,100 --> 01:55:01,230
I think it was Al Gore who created
the Internet, sort of hers, you know,

1893
01:55:01,610 --> 01:55:05,500
she did a great job. You did a great,
just tighten it up. I mean, I, you know,

1894
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:07,620
I've ever,
everything I,

1895
01:55:07,700 --> 01:55:12,700
I've a lot of what have I accomplished
or am learning is big from the Internet,

1896
01:55:13,131 --> 01:55:16,280
so thanks to that. But if it were people,
then I would say when I was young,

1897
01:55:16,281 --> 01:55:20,330
when I was like 15 or 16, I got my
first contract on the Internet. And,

1898
01:55:20,660 --> 01:55:25,190
um, just a friend of mine, someone I met
online who had taught me about business,

1899
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:30,260
um, when my mom told me this
is what the cheats, right,
as the cheat codes. Exactly.

1900
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:33,140
Yeah. So I was writing this counter
strike cheats and someone said, hey,

1901
01:55:33,141 --> 01:55:36,860
do you want a job? And this guy, uh,

1902
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:41,230
this guy says Dan, he actually taught
me a lot about business because, uh,

1903
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:44,130
then I needed a job. My mom lost
her job. She said, Sammy, you need,

1904
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:46,650
you're not going to school.
You're just playing games all day.

1905
01:55:46,651 --> 01:55:50,400
You need to get a job and help pay rent.
Um, if you're going to live here. I said,

1906
01:55:50,401 --> 01:55:54,420
okay. So, uh, I, you know,

1907
01:55:54,421 --> 01:55:58,160
I was trying to fill out applications
and Starbucks and Ralph's and um,

1908
01:55:58,470 --> 01:56:01,810
someone emailed me named Stan said,
Hey, I saw your cheat code. I,

1909
01:56:01,850 --> 01:56:04,560
she'd started cheat software. Do you
want to write software for my company?

1910
01:56:04,590 --> 01:56:08,310
We're doing some sort of game development
stuff. I was like, absolutely.

1911
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:12,480
So I contracted with this guy and
met him. He was awesome. And He, uh,

1912
01:56:12,570 --> 01:56:15,810
at that point I did a little contract
for him and then I was contract and for

1913
01:56:15,811 --> 01:56:19,950
another company and they wanted me to
work full time. And my mom said, well,

1914
01:56:19,951 --> 01:56:22,350
if you're gonna work for a company full
time, you know, take, you know, if I,

1915
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:25,500
I was like, mom, what do I do in the
negotiation when they've asked how much,

1916
01:56:26,430 --> 01:56:30,110
if they ask how much, and she
was like, just say, you know,

1917
01:56:30,111 --> 01:56:34,830
whatever you want to just say, you
know, tell them this low number.

1918
01:56:34,890 --> 01:56:38,070
And you know, if they say that's
too much, just accept lower.

1919
01:56:38,640 --> 01:56:41,430
And I had lunch with Stan is like,
oh,

1920
01:56:41,790 --> 01:56:45,630
so you're going to tell them that you
have a base expectation of 75 k and you

1921
01:56:45,631 --> 01:56:47,100
know, when their offer
that you have that's there,

1922
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:50,580
that's what they're offering and
that you're going to get, you know,

1923
01:56:50,581 --> 01:56:54,690
the other offer has, uh, you
know, a five year stock grant, uh,

1924
01:56:54,870 --> 01:56:58,860
with 5,000 shares and that's
what you want. And you're
like, I like Stan's advice.

1925
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:03,750
I have no idea what you just said.
And that's all bullshit.

1926
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:07,000
And he's like, so, and I'm like,

1927
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:09,840
I don't have another offer and I don't
want to lie. I don't want to be deceptive.

1928
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:11,640
And I'll say that that's like,
you know,

1929
01:57:11,641 --> 01:57:14,910
besides fake profiles on
Okcupid the other time,

1930
01:57:14,911 --> 01:57:18,120
it's okay to be deceptive as soon during
an interview because they're being

1931
01:57:18,121 --> 01:57:22,830
deceptive to you. Probably.
So during your, uh, during
your initial interview, um,

1932
01:57:23,670 --> 01:57:26,490
and so I went into this
meeting as a 15 year old kid,

1933
01:57:26,730 --> 01:57:30,150
just repeating the lines because
I had no idea what I was doing.

1934
01:57:31,170 --> 01:57:36,170
Reading verbatim on the other
offer has a five year stuck dread.

1935
01:57:36,330 --> 01:57:39,250
Exactly. Exactly what, say you

1936
01:57:42,190 --> 01:57:46,740
had a six month cliff and the five
year vesting period that's like,

1937
01:57:46,980 --> 01:57:51,840
I don't know what word salad. Hopefully
that compels you to give me more money.

1938
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:55,980
Stock was, and uh, I,

1939
01:57:55,981 --> 01:57:58,430
I thought in my head,
well, the only reason I,

1940
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:02,310
I followed his advice was because
he was a very smart and logical guy.

1941
01:58:02,311 --> 01:58:04,250
I really respected him because of that.
Um,

1942
01:58:04,590 --> 01:58:07,470
and everything he had told
me and taught me, I mean,

1943
01:58:07,471 --> 01:58:09,390
he was pretty much always
correct about things.

1944
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:12,600
And I'm also okay with taking
risks that's acceptable.

1945
01:58:12,630 --> 01:58:16,020
Like there's always another
way to do something. Um,

1946
01:58:16,290 --> 01:58:19,200
so I followed his advice and I walk,
you know,

1947
01:58:19,590 --> 01:58:21,980
and actually I went down for this
meeting and they said, hey, uh,

1948
01:58:22,790 --> 01:58:26,030
they had once with me and I took the
Amtrak to go see them in San Diego is a

1949
01:58:26,031 --> 01:58:27,810
company that I'd been
working with remotely.

1950
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:30,720
They never met me and I want
to take the Amtrak down.

1951
01:58:30,721 --> 01:58:34,020
And it's really like hoping I
got this job, we had dinner.

1952
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:37,590
It was really friendly and just
kind of casual. And that was that.

1953
01:58:37,660 --> 01:58:41,440
I was like guy and I felt like it
was weird. It's like a slap the face.

1954
01:58:41,441 --> 01:58:43,600
Like we never talked about the job.
We never talked about like,

1955
01:58:43,630 --> 01:58:46,690
am I getting this job or are
you guys going to hire me?
I really could use a job.

1956
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:51,040
And I said, so guys, did you want to
talk about like, I don't know, salary?

1957
01:58:51,160 --> 01:58:52,750
And I was really timid.
Um,

1958
01:58:52,870 --> 01:58:56,350
another reason that not having a Peter
was awesome because I was forced to talk

1959
01:58:56,351 --> 01:59:01,090
to people. So they're like, sure,
let's talk. And they're like,

1960
01:59:01,091 --> 01:59:04,600
what would you like? Like, and I just
repeated verbatim what he told me,

1961
01:59:04,630 --> 01:59:07,660
what he taught me. And it was,
you know, I have, uh, you know,

1962
01:59:07,740 --> 01:59:11,710
all my base expectation is 75 k and
another offer for that and another company

1963
01:59:11,711 --> 01:59:12,780
in La.
Uh,

1964
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:17,410
it would be better in la because I
already lived there in my head. I'm like,

1965
01:59:17,411 --> 01:59:20,500
please let me leave out. Oh,
like not la La, I love La,

1966
01:59:20,501 --> 01:59:25,501
but please let me move out of my mom's
place and get my own place if I'm making

1967
01:59:26,321 --> 01:59:30,390
75 gag and afford to place, um, and Pan,

1968
01:59:30,391 --> 01:59:35,230
handle my problems place right and
cover her. So, and, uh, I have this,

1969
01:59:35,231 --> 01:59:39,340
you know, stock grant, whatever,
blah, blah, blah, word garble.

1970
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:44,260
And they looked at each other and
said, okay. And I was flabbergasted.

1971
01:59:44,650 --> 01:59:46,900
And so, so what he, I mean,

1972
01:59:46,901 --> 01:59:49,900
he taught me a ton of woman
in my early years, right?

1973
01:59:49,901 --> 01:59:53,320
That was my first time in a real
job, a full time job. He got me,

1974
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:58,690
he got me a 40 gear, 40 k a
year race. Uh, there just stand.

1975
01:59:58,691 --> 02:00:01,570
Who had hired you based on your
cheat codes, correct. Yeah.

1976
02:00:01,571 --> 02:00:06,571
So he became a mentor and then for the
next job he was it for is for that job.

1977
02:00:06,850 --> 02:00:08,770
He was my mentor.
Like he lived in San Diego,

1978
02:00:08,771 --> 02:00:11,560
so I hung out with them all the
time. He was older. He was probably,

1979
02:00:11,650 --> 02:00:15,340
so he was helping you negotiate it
against his own company or I guess I was

1980
02:00:15,341 --> 02:00:18,280
contracting Pram. I had written
some software for him that was that,

1981
02:00:18,310 --> 02:00:21,970
like he didn't need a lot,
so I helped him, you know,

1982
02:00:21,971 --> 02:00:26,040
did a little contract and after that we
just remained friends. Scott and Scott,

1983
02:00:26,070 --> 02:00:31,030
older guy, scientist. I'm
a doctor, like really,

1984
02:00:31,031 --> 02:00:34,030
really, really smart guy. Uh,

1985
02:00:35,410 --> 02:00:37,780
when you think of the word successful,

1986
02:00:37,810 --> 02:00:42,610
who's the first person who comes to
mind for you? Hmm. Successful. Okay.

1987
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:46,200
Uh, as lot of sessile people. I mean,

1988
02:00:46,210 --> 02:00:50,280
I guess it depends how you
interpret success. Well,
that's, that's up to you. Yeah.

1989
02:00:50,281 --> 02:00:54,430
Yeah. I mean, I'd say, oh, lately
it's like a lot of it's just how,

1990
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:56,170
how can you remain happy,
right?

1991
02:00:56,171 --> 02:01:00,670
What can you do to actually increase
your net happiness while reducing the

1992
02:01:00,730 --> 02:01:04,650
negative, the negatives in your life and
without hurting people? I think that's,

1993
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:06,670
that's kind of like,
I don't have many morals or ethics.

1994
02:01:06,671 --> 02:01:10,750
I have like one pretty strict rule,
which is don't intentionally hurt someone.

1995
02:01:11,390 --> 02:01:12,223
Ahimsa.

1996
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:19,450
It's do no harm. It's also the
hippocratic oath. But yeah. Oh No, no.

1997
02:01:19,690 --> 02:01:23,090
Do No harm. Intentionally tension

1998
02:01:24,690 --> 02:01:27,710
trail of fire,
that's for sure.

1999
02:01:29,270 --> 02:01:32,590
But I'm just thinking as long
as it's not intentional, right.

2000
02:01:34,230 --> 02:01:38,950
No deliberate harm. It's
not you. It's me. So who,

2001
02:01:39,350 --> 02:01:43,460
man, I mean there, there are people
who are like, I think respect and, uh,

2002
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:46,580
I tried to, everyone, I think everyone
I meet has someone to teach me,

2003
02:01:46,770 --> 02:01:48,670
has something to teach me.
Uh,

2004
02:01:48,740 --> 02:01:52,630
I think Richard Branson is really cool
just because it's like every time I read

2005
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:56,900
about him or learn a little bit about him,
he was like having fun and has,

2006
02:01:56,901 --> 02:01:57,734
you know,

2007
02:01:57,950 --> 02:02:02,950
he's on an island or on a ship
or like racing across the ocean.

2008
02:02:04,250 --> 02:02:07,370
I mean, he's doing awesome
things. Um, he's having fun.

2009
02:02:07,371 --> 02:02:11,150
He's not necessarily defining success
for doing things based off what is

2010
02:02:11,151 --> 02:02:13,550
expected of you. Right. He's, uh,

2011
02:02:13,580 --> 02:02:17,660
he's doing I think what he wants and
that's what I really like. I want to,

2012
02:02:17,870 --> 02:02:22,190
you know, that's who I want
to do things that I want,

2013
02:02:22,690 --> 02:02:26,970
um, and have fun and
really enjoy my life. Um,

2014
02:02:27,080 --> 02:02:32,030
and hope maybe I can contribute
in some ways, but who are, uh,

2015
02:02:32,090 --> 02:02:35,240
who are some of the people
who had the biggest influence

2016
02:02:38,090 --> 02:02:41,570
on your worldview besides Stan?

2017
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:47,120
Let's just say after Stan [inaudible]
who was heavy on my worldview. Yeah.

2018
02:02:47,150 --> 02:02:51,530
Or just way of thinking about life.
Are there other people? Well, let's,

2019
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:56,300
let's take it even more
granular. Uh, in the world of,

2020
02:02:56,301 --> 02:02:59,870
and this is a term that's become
unfortunately very overused,

2021
02:02:59,871 --> 02:03:01,160
but in the world of hackers,
right?

2022
02:03:01,161 --> 02:03:06,161
People were finding non
obvious solutions to problems.

2023
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:08,330
Uh,

2024
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:13,720
is there anyone who had a particularly
large influence on you? Uh, in the,

2025
02:03:13,730 --> 02:03:15,200
in the world of hackers?
I mean,

2026
02:03:15,290 --> 02:03:18,760
Kevin Mitnick was kind of the
biggest well known hacker. Sure.

2027
02:03:18,910 --> 02:03:21,920
So I've always followed him.
The Art of deception. Yeah.

2028
02:03:21,940 --> 02:03:26,360
So scarred made of lock
picks. So amazing. Um,

2029
02:03:26,390 --> 02:03:27,290
but if I had to,

2030
02:03:27,350 --> 02:03:31,940
if I had to give specific people
that I think are awesome, uh,

2031
02:03:31,970 --> 02:03:36,070
had been doing awesome things. Um,
Pablos Pablos Holleman is one guy. Um,

2032
02:03:36,140 --> 02:03:39,050
he's part of this, uh, uh,
group called the Schmoo group.

2033
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:41,270
And when I went to Smu,

2034
02:03:41,570 --> 02:03:44,750
Schmoo s h m o o Middle Group,

2035
02:03:45,140 --> 02:03:47,630
and I found out about
them when I was like,

2036
02:03:47,660 --> 02:03:52,650
when I was a kid and when I moved
to La when I was 13. Um, I, uh,

2037
02:03:53,190 --> 02:03:58,130
PABLOS P A, B l o S. Pablos Holeman. Um,

2038
02:03:58,190 --> 02:04:03,190
I feel like I went to an event where he
spoke and he had a device that he waived

2039
02:04:04,461 --> 02:04:09,461
across the front row of the crowd
and captured all of their credit card

2040
02:04:09,831 --> 02:04:12,090
information and their wallets.
That sounds like publish.

2041
02:04:13,910 --> 02:04:18,860
This guy is awesome. I mean,
he's, uh, he's down to Earth,

2042
02:04:19,010 --> 02:04:22,820
right? Sociable. Uh, these are elements
that a lot of hackers lack. Right.

2043
02:04:22,821 --> 02:04:25,380
And I really liked that. I
liked the ability to, you know,

2044
02:04:25,430 --> 02:04:30,430
sit down and sit down in front of like
numbers and just unattractive code and

2045
02:04:31,881 --> 02:04:34,700
also be able to communicate with people
and actually have a real relationship

2046
02:04:34,701 --> 02:04:37,160
with people and socialize more.
Another,

2047
02:04:37,410 --> 02:04:39,780
I love being away from computers
for three years, right?

2048
02:04:39,830 --> 02:04:43,530
It forced me to socialize. And
if I didn't have that, you know,

2049
02:04:44,340 --> 02:04:48,620
this conversation will be very different.
Um,

2050
02:04:48,770 --> 02:04:51,960
so I really like Publix just because
when I learned about the Schmoo Group,

2051
02:04:51,990 --> 02:04:56,420
I was 14 years old and I was at, that
was the first time at my favorite. Uh,

2052
02:04:56,940 --> 02:04:58,440
I had a conference called Defcon,

2053
02:04:58,590 --> 02:05:01,050
one of the biggest hacker conferences
in the world is in Vegas every year.

2054
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:05,610
And they had this robot that
would drive around and it had,

2055
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:10,640
it was two big wheels and a screen and
all it did was show you your passwords.

2056
02:05:11,180 --> 02:05:14,310
Oh God. Drive up to you wirelessly.
And it would just be like,

2057
02:05:14,430 --> 02:05:16,290
this is your password.
And you're like,

2058
02:05:16,291 --> 02:05:19,710
what if you had a phone
or you're on your laptop?

2059
02:05:19,770 --> 02:05:24,510
It would just sniff passwords in the
air and show you that it was beautiful,

2060
02:05:25,310 --> 02:05:30,180
beautiful entire vine. Like so many
things in life. So, uh, you know,

2061
02:05:30,181 --> 02:05:35,130
he's definitely a guy and,
and also Dan Kaminsky is another really,

2062
02:05:35,160 --> 02:05:39,850
really smart, really, uh, I know
that name for some reason really. Uh,

2063
02:05:39,990 --> 02:05:43,080
he's found some huge
vulnerabilities in the internet.

2064
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:46,030
So if you've heard of the Internet and uh,
he,

2065
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:49,980
he had something called the Kaminsky
bug a few years ago where he found a way

2066
02:05:49,981 --> 02:05:51,990
that he could essentially
control any domain name.

2067
02:05:52,290 --> 02:05:56,340
If you wanted google.com to point
to his website, he could, um,

2068
02:05:57,020 --> 02:06:00,840
it seems reasonably powerful. Yeah.
Very powerful. Any, any, you know, he,

2069
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:04,890
he made a huge effort to resolve it
very quickly and effectively. Um,

2070
02:06:05,060 --> 02:06:09,330
so I think he's been someone I've watched
at def con ever since I was 14 years

2071
02:06:09,331 --> 02:06:14,070
old. And, uh, some of the people attend
difficult on each year. Now it's over.

2072
02:06:14,100 --> 02:06:17,880
It's over 10,000.
It's probably like 15,000 per year now.

2073
02:06:17,881 --> 02:06:21,570
Is it from the standpoint of a,
a non techie,

2074
02:06:21,650 --> 02:06:24,830
I have a severe,
uh,

2075
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:29,900
anxiety related to this. I've heard of def
con for quite some time. Okay. And, uh,

2076
02:06:29,940 --> 02:06:32,540
we were talking about, you know, the,

2077
02:06:32,541 --> 02:06:36,600
the magazine that you read
for quite some time, 2,600,

2078
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:38,210
2,600,
which I,

2079
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:43,280
which I picked up years ago but
lacked a much to my embarrassment,

2080
02:06:45,571 --> 02:06:49,590
sort of the technical chops to
appreciate even though I picked it up.

2081
02:06:49,990 --> 02:06:50,823
Uh,

2082
02:06:53,250 --> 02:06:58,080
should someone be intimidated and
afraid of going to say a def con?

2083
02:06:58,480 --> 02:07:01,740
Yeah. Are there risks involved?
That's a great question.

2084
02:07:02,070 --> 02:07:05,490
If you turn off your phone,
you should not be afraid.

2085
02:07:06,910 --> 02:07:11,460
Everyone is actually really cool because
I would love to attend. I've never been,

2086
02:07:11,461 --> 02:07:15,330
but my fear is that as a non
techie I would just be, you know,

2087
02:07:15,450 --> 02:07:19,470
caught with my pants down and bent over
a barrel every which way from Sunday

2088
02:07:19,471 --> 02:07:23,730
because I am so easy to exploit
in that respect. I would say,

2089
02:07:23,731 --> 02:07:25,920
I would say turn off seriously,
turn off your phone,

2090
02:07:26,220 --> 02:07:30,450
turn off your laptop and talk to
people like people a everyone.

2091
02:07:30,540 --> 02:07:33,440
It's almost like all the
hackers are among friends. Um,

2092
02:07:33,450 --> 02:07:36,010
I know I am like when I'm there it's it.
These are my friends.

2093
02:07:36,390 --> 02:07:38,140
Whether I know them or not.
These are,

2094
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:42,090
these are people who have
similar interests, can be
sperm in even you, right?

2095
02:07:42,090 --> 02:07:45,500
Even if you find it interesting
enough that you'd want to attend. Um,

2096
02:07:46,530 --> 02:07:48,130
and some really smart people,

2097
02:07:48,131 --> 02:07:51,730
some really interesting people
from all walks of life. Uh,

2098
02:07:52,330 --> 02:07:56,620
but there are definitely
people who are here we go with,

2099
02:07:56,650 --> 02:07:59,720
they're called script kiddies
in the community and the heck,

2100
02:07:59,770 --> 02:08:02,650
I want you to elaborate on this. All
right? So, yeah, I mean, I grew up,

2101
02:08:02,651 --> 02:08:03,910
I was a script kitty.
You know,

2102
02:08:03,911 --> 02:08:07,420
when I learned about a denial of
service attack and I had a letter when I

2103
02:08:07,421 --> 02:08:11,950
downloaded wind nuke and knew I could
crash someone's computer or that I could

2104
02:08:11,951 --> 02:08:15,250
open someone's CD Rom,
that wasn't one of the fun ones.

2105
02:08:15,670 --> 02:08:18,790
I can just open any of my friends,
just draw calls or guys to your friends,

2106
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:20,590
the ones that came, right. You know,

2107
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:25,290
just like cop out and they'd be like
surfing the web and boom, see rom open.

2108
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:32,770
Uh, that a, a script kitty is
someone who doesn't necessarily,

2109
02:08:33,250 --> 02:08:35,530
doesn't necessarily
know what they're doing,

2110
02:08:35,531 --> 02:08:39,410
but they've downloaded some programs or
script that is doing something, you know,

2111
02:08:39,550 --> 02:08:44,050
out of, out of there a hacker paygrade
right? It's out of their technical chops.

2112
02:08:44,410 --> 02:08:47,050
And that's okay. I mean, that's,
that's how we, how you learn.

2113
02:08:47,080 --> 02:08:48,440
That's how you learn anything, right? You,

2114
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:52,840
you take what you can and there's nothing
wrong with using the tools available.

2115
02:08:52,841 --> 02:08:54,970
I don't think there's anything
wrong with that. So I,

2116
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:57,550
I don't think you should be a malicious,
I'm not a malicious hacker.

2117
02:08:57,551 --> 02:09:01,000
I don't want to a destroyer
or hurt people. Um,

2118
02:09:01,300 --> 02:09:04,360
I really want to, you know, sort of, uh,

2119
02:09:04,660 --> 02:09:06,560
I wanted to show people the,

2120
02:09:06,680 --> 02:09:10,450
the lack of security that exists today
and hopefully help protect them and teach

2121
02:09:10,451 --> 02:09:15,350
other people like what they can learn.
So you have, I think in the, uh,

2122
02:09:15,430 --> 02:09:20,410
let's just say the mainstream
perception of hackers, the white hats,

2123
02:09:20,860 --> 02:09:24,400
just like spy versus spy. I got the
good guy. Sure. We got the black hats,

2124
02:09:24,700 --> 02:09:28,120
the bad guys, Eh, the malicious folks.

2125
02:09:28,121 --> 02:09:32,030
And then you have the gray hats
or the people in between. Uh,

2126
02:09:32,830 --> 02:09:37,830
how do those different
groups think philosophically?

2127
02:09:39,250 --> 02:09:42,610
Because like I guess the idea being,

2128
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:48,430
if you look at the stones of the world,
the Hitlers of the world, they absolutely,

2129
02:09:48,431 --> 02:09:50,680
and I'm not equating
that to black hat at all,

2130
02:09:50,681 --> 02:09:54,760
but I'm just saying they believe
themselves to be doing the right thing.

2131
02:09:55,750 --> 02:09:56,380
Right?

2132
02:09:56,380 --> 02:10:00,880
So what are the philosophical
orientations of those different groups?

2133
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:07,030
Um, you know, I'd say if you're black cat,

2134
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:10,810
you know, perhaps ignorance, you
know, perhaps ignorance is bliss.

2135
02:10:10,811 --> 02:10:14,500
And I've learned that I'm ignorant of a
lot of things when I don't think about

2136
02:10:14,501 --> 02:10:17,080
it. If I don't actually take the time
to sit down and think, how does this,

2137
02:10:17,081 --> 02:10:18,310
let's say,
effect someone,

2138
02:10:18,670 --> 02:10:20,800
how would I feel if I were
in this other person's shoes?

2139
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:23,720
I can remain a grant about something.
Um,

2140
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:28,300
and sometimes you want to write a,
sometimes I don't want to know that. Well,

2141
02:10:28,301 --> 02:10:32,590
right? If you're a guy in Las Vegas
who's remotely flying drones in Iraq,

2142
02:10:33,170 --> 02:10:35,780
billowing up dozens or hundreds of people,

2143
02:10:36,290 --> 02:10:40,130
you think of it as a first person shooter
game. Not as a rival world exercise.

2144
02:10:40,160 --> 02:10:44,430
I mean, I gotta be honest, like every
time I eat a steak, I'm like, I don't, uh,

2145
02:10:44,750 --> 02:10:48,380
I'm financially not thinking about what
happens. Yeah. Right. More and more.

2146
02:10:48,381 --> 02:10:52,190
I do think about this now. Um,
but I love his stake, so I'm like,

2147
02:10:52,191 --> 02:10:55,310
maybe I should just be a little black
cat in my food, my food etiquette.

2148
02:10:55,680 --> 02:11:00,440
A black cat carnivore.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Oh man,

2149
02:11:00,460 --> 02:11:04,190
I love it. So, um, you know, I'm
being ignorant and now I'm just,

2150
02:11:04,250 --> 02:11:08,160
I'm just being silly. But uh,
I'd say yeah, black hats are,

2151
02:11:08,630 --> 02:11:12,620
aren't really f and I think
that's true of anything.

2152
02:11:12,620 --> 02:11:15,140
If you don't think about how
it actually affects somebody,

2153
02:11:15,170 --> 02:11:20,130
then you are doing that. Um,
I'm no more wine. I won't,

2154
02:11:20,150 --> 02:11:23,060
there's, there's more wanting to
be had. So I shall pour one. Oh,

2155
02:11:23,061 --> 02:11:26,180
what's this one called? Oh, this is a,

2156
02:11:26,181 --> 02:11:31,181
this is a somewhat amusing a label and
I may be abusing my housemates wine

2157
02:11:33,171 --> 02:11:35,950
collection. Sorry,
housemate. Sorry. Housemates.

2158
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:39,890
So there's a very trippy
tattooed chick on a,

2159
02:11:39,891 --> 02:11:44,891
what appears to be a motorcycle
on the label and the brand is,

2160
02:11:45,710 --> 02:11:50,510
if you see Kay, I, F y, O, u, s, e, e,

2161
02:11:50,540 --> 02:11:55,370
k, a, Y, which spells of
course f, U, C, k, I, e,

2162
02:11:55,371 --> 02:11:56,204
fuck,

2163
02:11:56,630 --> 02:12:01,340
which is such a delectable flexible
curse word in the English language.

2164
02:12:01,910 --> 02:12:02,840
Uh,
for those understood.

2165
02:12:02,841 --> 02:12:07,841
There is a book called English as a second
fucking language all about the use of

2166
02:12:07,971 --> 02:12:10,130
the word fuck, which is
really, really fascinating.

2167
02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:15,110
But I digress and we've killed our
second bottle. Can't wait. Well done.

2168
02:12:15,111 --> 02:12:19,850
Good work. Salmon. He'd worked.
So we were talking about,

2169
02:12:19,910 --> 02:12:24,450
uh, black cats, steaks.
Uh, another thing you,

2170
02:12:24,460 --> 02:12:27,470
were you ever a black hat?
Oh Man. I mean, uh, you know,

2171
02:12:27,650 --> 02:12:30,470
I guess people might see
black head differently.

2172
02:12:30,471 --> 02:12:33,590
I think if you're trying to
sort of a lot of black hats,

2173
02:12:33,591 --> 02:12:37,640
typically what they're doing is
they're hacking for financial gain. Um,

2174
02:12:37,641 --> 02:12:40,640
I've never hacked for financial gain,
uh,

2175
02:12:40,670 --> 02:12:45,310
except for all the jobs I've
gotten fracking of that,
not hacking maliciously. Uh,

2176
02:12:45,311 --> 02:12:49,030
I would say a lot of hackers and
I find a lot of them, you know,

2177
02:12:49,070 --> 02:12:52,850
a lot of the black hats were actually
in like Romania and Russia and a lot of

2178
02:12:52,851 --> 02:12:57,050
countries where maybe they
don't, uh, I don't know,

2179
02:12:57,051 --> 02:13:00,740
hit you so hard for doing that. Maybe
there aren't that many laws around that.

2180
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:04,850
Romania seems to be a real hotbed
for yeah. A lot of that we live,

2181
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:09,960
they have like western union's
every like happy blocks just stop.

2182
02:13:10,950 --> 02:13:13,490
Staunching I mean it's
really become a sort of a,

2183
02:13:13,750 --> 02:13:17,750
a nexus for a lot of that
activity. Yeah. Yeah. And uh,

2184
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:20,330
that's why I'm Romanian nine
months a year. Just kidding.

2185
02:13:22,060 --> 02:13:26,630
It's where your several homeless,
my first home is. No, just kidding.

2186
02:13:26,920 --> 02:13:30,710
Um, uh, but I would say so black hats
are typically doing it for financial,

2187
02:13:30,740 --> 02:13:32,410
financial gain.
Uh,

2188
02:13:32,490 --> 02:13:35,730
and there's so many ways to do it for
financial gain and I learned that a long

2189
02:13:35,731 --> 02:13:40,230
time ago. And, um, what are
some of the ways to do it
for, for financial gain? Okay,

2190
02:13:40,231 --> 02:13:43,380
so a, for one, stealing credit cards, uh,

2191
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:47,850
hacking into companies is actually,
is almost trivial.

2192
02:13:48,270 --> 02:13:51,000
I'll just say that anyone
can learn how to hack. Um,

2193
02:13:51,100 --> 02:13:52,320
anyone can learn these things.

2194
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:55,150
And that's one thing that I'm trying
to teach people. It's like how the,

2195
02:13:55,170 --> 02:14:00,120
how computers work, how
technology works. And anyone can,

2196
02:14:00,121 --> 02:14:04,380
let's say break into a company. If
you try a company that, for example,

2197
02:14:04,740 --> 02:14:07,800
does retail and if you do retail,
then you can,

2198
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:11,010
let's say you've saved
your credit card somewhere,

2199
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:14,420
you can then see that database
full of credit card numbers. Um,

2200
02:14:14,850 --> 02:14:15,900
and you can then sell that.

2201
02:14:16,140 --> 02:14:20,160
You can either monetize it yourself and
you can produce credit cards using a mag

2202
02:14:20,161 --> 02:14:22,740
stripe writer and create your
own credit cards and use them.

2203
02:14:22,950 --> 02:14:26,970
Or you could sell it to someone else
who already has that. Has that handled,

2204
02:14:27,240 --> 02:14:30,390
I mean, there's sort of a little
distribution chain that goes down.

2205
02:14:31,410 --> 02:14:35,940
That's one simple example of someone
who could be an entire novice. Uh,

2206
02:14:36,030 --> 02:14:39,810
you know what you might call a script
kitty and who can steal databases just

2207
02:14:39,811 --> 02:14:44,780
enough to be dangerous of credit
cards and sell it and make money. Um,

2208
02:14:44,940 --> 02:14:47,200
this is a huge thing. This is
actually why, you know, well,

2209
02:14:47,220 --> 02:14:50,280
this is a lot of what the secret service
does besides protecting the president.

2210
02:14:50,281 --> 02:14:54,240
It's also protecting it like money and
online is the easiest way to steal money.

2211
02:14:54,600 --> 02:14:58,710
Um, also like as you saw Pablos
right? He probably, he waved,

2212
02:14:58,711 --> 02:15:02,220
he probably waived something
as my guests where RFID based,

2213
02:15:02,370 --> 02:15:06,750
he stole totally credit card a number
because these are, yeah. Just to,

2214
02:15:06,751 --> 02:15:09,090
just to explain one more time to folks,

2215
02:15:10,230 --> 02:15:12,840
this was many years ago
to this is not recently,

2216
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:18,200
and he had a small handheld device that
he waved at the front row while giving a

2217
02:15:19,711 --> 02:15:23,070
keynote and was able to capture all
their credit card information from their

2218
02:15:23,071 --> 02:15:27,690
wallets. Amazing. Oh God.

2219
02:15:28,050 --> 02:15:30,240
Yeah. You're just getting credit card
numbers. I mean, the, the beautiful,

2220
02:15:30,330 --> 02:15:33,710
beautiful thing about that that are
of id, that RF radio frequency, right?

2221
02:15:33,770 --> 02:15:36,060
Same thing is stealing cars.
Um,

2222
02:15:36,120 --> 02:15:39,840
you can just walk through times square
and just steal numbers without ever

2223
02:15:39,841 --> 02:15:43,890
touching a person. It's insane.
So you can then sell those, right?

2224
02:15:43,940 --> 02:15:45,000
There's a black market,

2225
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:48,150
there's a market that we're someone
go to sell credit cards. Uh,

2226
02:15:48,370 --> 02:15:53,130
I can give you a list of sites now. Uh,
there, there's a lot of, there's forms,

2227
02:15:53,940 --> 02:15:57,780
typically fright, private forums.
There's also government governments, uh,

2228
02:15:57,810 --> 02:16:00,310
definitely in those forums as well.
But yeah,

2229
02:16:00,340 --> 02:16:03,480
Darwin's who buy those credit cards new
by those credit cards who tried to fuck

2230
02:16:03,481 --> 02:16:06,210
track those credit cards.
I had subcontracted for a company

2231
02:16:07,950 --> 02:16:11,730
for 13 years ago that,
uh, worked with FBI.

2232
02:16:12,180 --> 02:16:14,370
And what,
uh,

2233
02:16:14,371 --> 02:16:18,630
what we were doing was tracking
down a huge thief of credit cards.

2234
02:16:18,660 --> 02:16:23,660
And they had not only penetrated
a company that had credit cards,

2235
02:16:23,761 --> 02:16:26,220
you know, like a retailer.
They had penetrated,

2236
02:16:26,630 --> 02:16:29,410
the hacker group had penetrated a gateway.

2237
02:16:29,740 --> 02:16:32,590
The gateway is who your
credit cards go through to.

2238
02:16:32,930 --> 02:16:37,930
It would be like a stripe or a paypal.
Her and I'll throw size. Exactly. Um,

2239
02:16:38,410 --> 02:16:40,600
so it's a credit card processor.

2240
02:16:40,690 --> 02:16:44,410
The people who get all the credit
cards from all the money, you know,

2241
02:16:44,411 --> 02:16:48,400
all the companies online. And they
had penetrated one of those servers.

2242
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:50,240
And we had found this,
uh,

2243
02:16:50,241 --> 02:16:55,241
the FBI told us and we investigated and
we had a little bit of authorization to

2244
02:16:55,721 --> 02:17:00,400
hack these Romanians
servers. Surprise, surprise.

2245
02:17:00,960 --> 02:17:04,720
So essential misc yeah.
So I,

2246
02:17:06,110 --> 02:17:10,000
I essentially chick Foche, I'm spending
a little bit of time rather manuals,

2247
02:17:10,480 --> 02:17:15,460
they're fun, fun group talk.

2248
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:19,900
Uh, so they would, uh, Eh, and
I, you know, essentially the,

2249
02:17:19,901 --> 02:17:23,860
our job was to track them and find them.
And um,

2250
02:17:24,370 --> 02:17:25,203
we did,

2251
02:17:25,510 --> 02:17:30,510
after I found this one of the hackers and
found their chat room and chatted with

2252
02:17:30,731 --> 02:17:35,140
them and became friends and they'd send
me pictures and I saw this guy's new

2253
02:17:35,141 --> 02:17:39,400
viper and is in his garage,
brand new viper cash.

2254
02:17:39,640 --> 02:17:42,670
Oh Wow.
Nice Romanian cash horror movie.

2255
02:17:43,030 --> 02:17:47,950
It's like new Jack City Style and Romania.
Yeah. And uh, that's how we found them.

2256
02:17:47,951 --> 02:17:49,330
And um,

2257
02:17:49,390 --> 02:17:52,240
that many crazy thing is so many things
are hacked on a daily basis and we just

2258
02:17:52,241 --> 02:17:53,990
don't know. And a lot
of the times, you know,

2259
02:17:54,250 --> 02:17:57,400
the companies are required
to tell there were users,

2260
02:17:59,050 --> 02:18:02,560
not everyone tells you
that you got hacked. Right.

2261
02:18:02,561 --> 02:18:06,040
We hear about hacks all the
time now and it's unfortunate,

2262
02:18:06,041 --> 02:18:08,530
but so many companies are
being hacked and don't know it.

2263
02:18:09,100 --> 02:18:13,270
What do you think of using services like
a one password or lastpass or whatnot?

2264
02:18:13,870 --> 02:18:17,950
Try to improve your security
with passwords? Yeah, that's a,

2265
02:18:17,951 --> 02:18:22,780
that's a tough question for
me just because I'm unsure
how I feel about them. Um,

2266
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:23,500
I don't,

2267
02:18:23,500 --> 02:18:28,500
I personally don't subscribe to them
just for the fact that they are,

2268
02:18:29,470 --> 02:18:33,610
it seemed like a big target, right? If
I were, if I were to high value target,

2269
02:18:34,560 --> 02:18:38,140
SVT is, it's a, I would be like
analyzing their code every day,

2270
02:18:38,141 --> 02:18:41,230
trying to find a flaw so that when I want,
I could then get,

2271
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:45,580
when I do have computers,
when I do drop some malware on a website,

2272
02:18:45,880 --> 02:18:50,570
I didn't get all your passwords, not just,
you know, not just one. So the ideas,

2273
02:18:51,340 --> 02:18:52,660
however,
in general,

2274
02:18:52,661 --> 02:18:56,230
I think they're doing a good thing because
I believe if you're a person who uses

2275
02:18:56,231 --> 02:18:58,210
the same password for every website,

2276
02:18:58,540 --> 02:19:03,540
I believe it's superior to use a program
like last pass or I'm a buy and a bean

2277
02:19:04,691 --> 02:19:09,520
has a, as another password manager
went on one password, whatever.

2278
02:19:09,550 --> 02:19:11,410
Yeah.
So I believe it's better to use those.

2279
02:19:11,411 --> 02:19:15,820
Then they use the same
password everywhere. Uh, what
I would suggest to everyone,

2280
02:19:15,940 --> 02:19:16,930
that's something I do.

2281
02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:20,680
I don't make ridiculous passwords
that are hard to remember.

2282
02:19:20,740 --> 02:19:24,040
I make it really easy passwords to
remember and they're just really long,

2283
02:19:24,460 --> 02:19:29,210
usually lyrics in the song. Yeah.
You know, welcome to the jungle baby,

2284
02:19:29,420 --> 02:19:32,070
exact Cetera, et Cetera,
et cetera. You know,

2285
02:19:32,120 --> 02:19:35,930
favorite puff daddy song,
you know,

2286
02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:40,030
Dr Dre and
owe money.

2287
02:19:40,031 --> 02:19:44,450
I don't need to choose some lyrics.
Uh, it doesn't matter if there's not a,

2288
02:19:44,480 --> 02:19:47,960
you know, crazy like exclamation
marks and like capital letters.

2289
02:19:47,961 --> 02:19:49,940
You don't need all that.
If it's really long,

2290
02:19:50,270 --> 02:19:55,270
but you'd remember that's much better
than an exclamation mark in the middle for

2291
02:19:55,401 --> 02:19:57,710
a short password. And you can
remember it right. For Your Bank.

2292
02:19:57,740 --> 02:20:02,390
You use stuff related to blink, you know,
for a different website. Just Oh, what's,

2293
02:20:02,391 --> 02:20:04,340
you know,
what makes you think of that website?

2294
02:20:04,700 --> 02:20:08,150
What other precautions you freaked me out.
I,

2295
02:20:08,151 --> 02:20:09,920
I had mentioned my name before Monday.

2296
02:20:09,940 --> 02:20:14,900
We'll know with the hijacking
of laptop cameras. Okay.

2297
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:19,010
So I just got a new computer.
I need to cover up that camera.

2298
02:20:19,160 --> 02:20:24,160
But uh, what other precautions would
you suggest that people take? Well,

2299
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:26,630
I'd say there's a pretty
advanced technology that you can,

2300
02:20:26,631 --> 02:20:28,890
you actually use to protect you against,
um,

2301
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:33,590
someone invading essentially the
camera. And it recently someone, uh, um,

2302
02:20:33,950 --> 02:20:37,820
people have found that they've been able
to enable the Mac book cameras without

2303
02:20:37,821 --> 02:20:40,550
the light coming on. Wow. And the,

2304
02:20:40,700 --> 02:20:44,510
and supposedly the FBI has
been able to do this for years,

2305
02:20:44,570 --> 02:20:49,420
but now it's been found by other people
demonstrating demonstrated. Right. Um,

2306
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:51,910
so there's a pretty advanced technology,
uh,

2307
02:20:52,220 --> 02:20:56,630
that came out a long time ago called the
posted and you can fly the posted just

2308
02:20:56,631 --> 02:21:01,190
above, just over the camera. And
when you wish to Skype or facetime,

2309
02:21:01,590 --> 02:21:06,290
um, you can lift said most
exactly. Or masking tape. Correct.

2310
02:21:06,291 --> 02:21:10,340
Which was my, my goto.
Correct. What's, uh,

2311
02:21:11,510 --> 02:21:16,510
are there any software
programs or applications that
you use to improve security

2312
02:21:19,011 --> 02:21:23,300
or anonymity? Oh, man. On your
computer. This is a weird one.

2313
02:21:23,330 --> 02:21:26,780
And this is something that I will,
this is,

2314
02:21:27,770 --> 02:21:31,580
it makes me feel funny. Um,
this software can be the one,

2315
02:21:31,640 --> 02:21:35,990
there's a software called true crypt.
True crypt. Correct. True crypt.

2316
02:21:36,330 --> 02:21:38,960
This is a, uh, software,
uh, it's open source.

2317
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:44,200
It's been developed to help you encrypt
your either hard drive or folder or

2318
02:21:44,750 --> 02:21:48,530
flashdrive and it allows you to say, okay,
if you have information on our protect,

2319
02:21:48,531 --> 02:21:52,080
you can encrypt it with this
software called true crypt. Um,

2320
02:21:52,640 --> 02:21:56,900
it requires a password and no
one knows who created truecrypt.

2321
02:21:57,530 --> 02:21:58,820
It's always been open source.

2322
02:21:58,850 --> 02:22:03,440
It's probably been a team of
developers and that's really cool. Um,

2323
02:22:04,130 --> 02:22:09,130
recently maybe a few months ago the
website changed and it said true crypt is

2324
02:22:10,580 --> 02:22:12,380
insecure,
don't use it,

2325
02:22:14,630 --> 02:22:17,660
go use something else.
And that was it.

2326
02:22:17,720 --> 02:22:22,310
The authors said that and it was done.
This is one of the craziest things.

2327
02:22:22,311 --> 02:22:23,144
There were very few.

2328
02:22:23,150 --> 02:22:26,400
There are very few products or pieces
software out in the world that are

2329
02:22:26,401 --> 02:22:28,740
anonymous that are run by non Hummus.
You know,

2330
02:22:28,741 --> 02:22:33,090
a nun's group and that are successful.
Truecrypt is a success.

2331
02:22:33,300 --> 02:22:35,220
Lots of people,
when I say success,

2332
02:22:35,221 --> 02:22:38,570
I mean people who want
protection use true crypt.

2333
02:22:39,720 --> 02:22:42,780
So it's kind of scary to hear
the thing that you've been,

2334
02:22:43,060 --> 02:22:45,540
at least if you're in my world,

2335
02:22:45,630 --> 02:22:49,770
you would be using true groups if you
want to protect information because it has

2336
02:22:49,771 --> 02:22:54,100
a wide base of users of smart users who
already understand cryptography, um,

2337
02:22:54,690 --> 02:22:58,530
and who want to protect their stuff
and aren't just using something random,

2338
02:22:58,531 --> 02:23:01,690
the off the shelf that just
may or may not have flaws. Uh,

2339
02:23:01,770 --> 02:23:04,530
because stope and sourcing me
analyze and audited by other people.

2340
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:09,750
And just recently, probably within the
past few days, an audit of few days,

2341
02:23:09,790 --> 02:23:10,980
the past few days,
uh,

2342
02:23:11,100 --> 02:23:15,510
an audit of true crypt has been completed
because for a long time people have

2343
02:23:15,511 --> 02:23:19,000
been saying, we need to audit your
cup just to make sure it's secure. Um,

2344
02:23:19,380 --> 02:23:22,200
and your auto some uncompleted.
And there were some minor flaws,

2345
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:25,470
some flaws that can be exploited, but
nothing, nothing huge, nothing wearing,

2346
02:23:25,471 --> 02:23:28,770
nothing. Like, oh, there's
a backdoor in here.

2347
02:23:29,190 --> 02:23:33,990
So why do you think that message was
put out? Oh Man, I have no idea. I mean,

2348
02:23:34,020 --> 02:23:35,400
the question is did someone,

2349
02:23:36,300 --> 02:23:39,600
there've been some interesting
things that have happened recently,

2350
02:23:39,630 --> 02:23:43,320
especially with the revelations
of Snowden. Uh, for one thing,

2351
02:23:43,321 --> 02:23:47,370
there's these gag orders that we've now
learned about that sometimes the NSA can

2352
02:23:47,371 --> 02:23:49,560
send a gag order and say, uh, you know,

2353
02:23:49,561 --> 02:23:53,520
we want information and you
can't tell your co your users,

2354
02:23:53,550 --> 02:23:57,630
you can't tell the public that we gave
you that we gave you this gag order. Um,

2355
02:23:58,200 --> 02:24:01,410
so I think some sites are actually
employing something where they say,

2356
02:24:02,340 --> 02:24:07,340
we have never been asked by the government
to provide any information or just so

2357
02:24:07,650 --> 02:24:12,060
completely, if they ever encourage
you, get, well, they asked this,

2358
02:24:12,061 --> 02:24:15,960
they put this up before they've ever
been asked. Uh, so if they're ever asked,

2359
02:24:16,170 --> 02:24:19,020
they have to take it down.
Ah,

2360
02:24:19,021 --> 02:24:23,550
so that this hasn't been tested in court.
But the idea is that's clever though.

2361
02:24:23,551 --> 02:24:26,730
So no, no. It's like a plausible
deniability thing. Exactly. Oh,

2362
02:24:26,731 --> 02:24:31,500
one of the cool things about true
crypt, um, is that true crib,

2363
02:24:31,501 --> 02:24:36,100
t r u e C R y p.
T.

2364
02:24:36,101 --> 02:24:40,610
Jesus Christ one.
Uh,

2365
02:24:41,170 --> 02:24:45,360
one thing that's really interesting
that true crypt is that it has a feature

2366
02:24:45,630 --> 02:24:48,990
called the about plies of
plausible deniability. For example,

2367
02:24:48,991 --> 02:24:51,990
if you're at a border and
someone requests you to give,

2368
02:24:51,991 --> 02:24:56,790
you give them your password, you have to
in border crossings, you, you have no,

2369
02:24:57,420 --> 02:25:01,470
I mean they have full jurisdiction,
they can do whatever they want. Um,

2370
02:25:01,770 --> 02:25:03,150
so if they ask you for your password,

2371
02:25:03,180 --> 02:25:07,410
you have to give it or you can just
like go to Mexican jail. I mean not,

2372
02:25:07,411 --> 02:25:11,910
not an attractive option,
generally speaking, right? So,

2373
02:25:12,710 --> 02:25:15,450
uh, you can comes back to our losing your
friends and you're losing your thumbs.

2374
02:25:15,451 --> 02:25:18,000
Question
14.

2375
02:25:18,780 --> 02:25:23,780
So if there's an interesting feature
with true crypt where you can apply to

2376
02:25:24,641 --> 02:25:28,600
passwords to hidden drive or I'm sorry,
not hidden drive, an encrypted drive.

2377
02:25:29,800 --> 02:25:32,950
So let's say you have an encrypted folder,
it has a password that unlocks it.

2378
02:25:33,400 --> 02:25:36,190
And if you go to the border and they say,
give us your password,

2379
02:25:36,340 --> 02:25:37,570
you have to give it up.

2380
02:25:38,140 --> 02:25:42,010
And now those files are for
them to use as they please.

2381
02:25:42,540 --> 02:25:47,540
A true crypt has a feature where you can
use two passwords and it decrypts the

2382
02:25:47,741 --> 02:25:50,890
same drive with two different passwords.
So one is a decoy,

2383
02:25:51,400 --> 02:25:53,140
one is essentially a decoy.

2384
02:25:54,520 --> 02:25:59,140
And the beautiful part about the way it
works is that the data is all randomized

2385
02:25:59,141 --> 02:25:59,974
when it's encrypted.

2386
02:26:00,100 --> 02:26:03,520
There's no way to prove that you're
using the secondary password.

2387
02:26:03,940 --> 02:26:06,280
It's impossible to prove today.
It's impossible. We don't,

2388
02:26:06,340 --> 02:26:09,640
we know of no possible way today,
uh,

2389
02:26:09,641 --> 02:26:13,900
with the existing technology to show
that there is one or two passwords used.

2390
02:26:14,110 --> 02:26:15,160
Most people only use one.

2391
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:19,510
Most people only need one because they
don't care if they don't care if the

2392
02:26:19,511 --> 02:26:21,010
government gets this information,

2393
02:26:21,011 --> 02:26:24,670
they're protecting corporate secrets for
example, or they're protecting, you know,

2394
02:26:25,030 --> 02:26:29,860
private pictures or whatever.
Some people do care and if they do care,

2395
02:26:29,861 --> 02:26:33,070
they can use this additional feature
where it uses essentially the same

2396
02:26:33,071 --> 02:26:36,460
encrypted method.
And when you give up a password,

2397
02:26:36,910 --> 02:26:41,570
there's no way to prove whether there's
a secondary password in use or not. Um,

2398
02:26:41,800 --> 02:26:43,890
so that's a really cool
feature I think when,

2399
02:26:43,930 --> 02:26:45,850
and I think plausible deniability
is really interesting.

2400
02:26:46,330 --> 02:26:48,640
So it really interesting thing
to play with. Super interesting.

2401
02:26:48,700 --> 02:26:50,720
I know guys who uh,

2402
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:55,800
these are CEOs of companies who go
to China and they will always bring a

2403
02:26:56,710 --> 02:27:01,600
effectively blank net book with them
China because they assume whenever they

2404
02:27:02,050 --> 02:27:07,050
check into a half decent hotel in China
that their data is immediately being

2405
02:27:08,561 --> 02:27:12,640
downloaded yeah. From their
computers. Absolutely. Uh,

2406
02:27:13,110 --> 02:27:15,940
and a man having spent some time in China,

2407
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,900
that would not surprise me in the least,
so absolutely. Yeah. I mean just recently,

2408
02:27:19,901 --> 02:27:23,660
uh, I mean literally in the
past few days as well, a Goo,

2409
02:27:23,980 --> 02:27:26,350
China's a certificate agency.

2410
02:27:26,350 --> 02:27:31,350
The people who encrypt all the web traffic
in China gave out a fake certificate

2411
02:27:32,291 --> 02:27:35,440
for google.com so that
they get essentially,

2412
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:38,710
oh well they claimed that it
was an accident. Who knows?

2413
02:27:39,820 --> 02:27:42,910
But essentially if you're,
if you're using them,

2414
02:27:42,911 --> 02:27:46,900
if you're in China and you
go to a google.com domain
or like Gmail for example,

2415
02:27:46,901 --> 02:27:49,900
that you believe is encrypted,
they can decrypt everything. Oh,

2416
02:27:50,080 --> 02:27:53,160
I read your email for
example. That is a, a,

2417
02:27:53,161 --> 02:27:56,500
a very literal example of those
of you who speak Chinese. That is,

2418
02:27:56,800 --> 02:28:01,150
it's a whole month, the whole
month. This is taking the back door,

2419
02:28:01,151 --> 02:28:02,070
which is Nick's a,

2420
02:28:02,090 --> 02:28:07,090
which is an expression used
typically to refer to say,

2421
02:28:09,191 --> 02:28:11,320
you know,
bribing officials or something like that,

2422
02:28:11,560 --> 02:28:16,200
doing something very unofficial
that gets official results. But uh,

2423
02:28:16,560 --> 02:28:18,740
accidents I'm on.

2424
02:28:19,590 --> 02:28:23,690
So I'll say when it comes to tools,
if you're looking for more tools,

2425
02:28:23,720 --> 02:28:24,560
I keep it private.

2426
02:28:24,880 --> 02:28:29,120
It's just my personal list of what I'm
using today and it's if you want to see

2427
02:28:29,121 --> 02:28:33,320
it, Sammy dot. Pl slash tools.
This is a rad list. I've,
I've looked at this before.

2428
02:28:33,321 --> 02:28:37,040
Gas, so you should check it out. It's
just a Google doc. I keep it. Uh, I don't,

2429
02:28:37,100 --> 02:28:38,450
I usually just send it to my friends,

2430
02:28:38,451 --> 02:28:42,020
but if people are interested
in what I'm using today,

2431
02:28:42,230 --> 02:28:45,980
this is my updated lists of what the
software I run pretty much. Cool.

2432
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:50,360
Send me that. Pl slash slash. Tools. All
right, cool. I will link to that as well.

2433
02:28:50,870 --> 02:28:55,760
Uh, do, uh, do you read
much? Do you read? I don't,

2434
02:28:55,850 --> 02:29:00,170
um, I, I was about to say
I used to, no, I never did.

2435
02:29:02,670 --> 02:29:07,480
No, I've read, I've read, I read
here and there. Um, and I'm,

2436
02:29:07,550 --> 02:29:11,030
I hate pretty much what I do is like
I'll read a few pages and I love Amazon

2437
02:29:11,031 --> 02:29:14,180
because they let you read a
few pages and if I'm, you know,

2438
02:29:14,300 --> 02:29:17,990
if I feel dead dictate
it and sometimes I do,

2439
02:29:18,020 --> 02:29:19,650
then I keep reading it.

2440
02:29:19,910 --> 02:29:23,950
What are the last books that have
caught your attention that way? Mm.

2441
02:29:24,290 --> 02:29:28,860
Caught my attention. Um, were books
that come to mind that have, okay.

2442
02:29:29,260 --> 02:29:31,760
Okay. Yeah, I mean lately I've been
like into mechanical engineering,

2443
02:29:31,761 --> 02:29:33,800
so I've been re reading
mechanical engineering books,

2444
02:29:34,040 --> 02:29:38,870
but I would say things that like
have affected me and changed,

2445
02:29:39,050 --> 02:29:42,900
changed me that I think are really cool.
Um,

2446
02:29:44,090 --> 02:29:47,840
I would say one book is called
influence by Robert Cialdini.

2447
02:29:48,740 --> 02:29:51,170
Definitely. Uh, I learned that about, uh,

2448
02:29:51,171 --> 02:29:55,430
I believe it was Stan who told me about
that and when I was 16 and I read that,

2449
02:29:55,431 --> 02:29:58,760
I mean this was, canvas came out before
I was born. It was in the early eighties.

2450
02:29:59,180 --> 02:30:03,350
Um, Jesus Christ, we wonder,
you're born again. 85. Good God,

2451
02:30:04,610 --> 02:30:07,700
young and little sea monkey pup

2452
02:30:10,940 --> 02:30:15,440
continue. So sure, sure. Um, so influenced
my age. Come crashing down upon me.

2453
02:30:16,610 --> 02:30:21,220
Please continue. Uh, so chow,

2454
02:30:21,320 --> 02:30:22,730
uh, influence, uh,

2455
02:30:22,750 --> 02:30:27,750
it's a book about influencing and how
humans can be influenced and persuaded to

2456
02:30:28,011 --> 02:30:29,420
do things. I mean, I don't know.

2457
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:34,010
I don't recall whether it's a book for
salespeople or for like manipulating

2458
02:30:34,011 --> 02:30:38,870
people or how to protect yourself. It's
a little bit of all of it actually. Um,

2459
02:30:39,050 --> 02:30:44,050
and I love it because it was a very
systematic and analytical approach to the

2460
02:30:44,061 --> 02:30:48,320
most common ways that human beings
have been known to be influenced and

2461
02:30:48,321 --> 02:30:50,930
persuaded to do something.
You could use it for sales,

2462
02:30:51,080 --> 02:30:54,890
you could use it to attract
people you'd use it for. I mean,

2463
02:30:54,920 --> 02:30:59,390
these are life skills. I believe these
are life skills. Definitely scarcity,

2464
02:30:59,750 --> 02:31:04,550
absolute time restrictions. Sure. Social
proof have to run to save some penguins.

2465
02:31:04,580 --> 02:31:08,360
But I, you're right.
Yeah, yeah. These are,

2466
02:31:08,361 --> 02:31:11,540
these are common principles and
that's like ability to write,

2467
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:16,220
to save some penguins, like, like
ability. So the, I mean, those,

2468
02:31:16,221 --> 02:31:19,470
like those shaped me. I mean
to, to understand how I could,

2469
02:31:20,140 --> 02:31:23,790
and it's not influenced people
in a negative way. I mean,
it can be used that way,

2470
02:31:23,791 --> 02:31:28,080
but it's how can I socialize with the
humans around me and how can I like be

2471
02:31:28,081 --> 02:31:30,900
friend people and how can I, um, you know,

2472
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:35,550
I'm going to use reciprocity too to
have people in my life who I like and

2473
02:31:35,551 --> 02:31:39,210
respect and appreciate and I want
them to respect me back. Right?

2474
02:31:39,211 --> 02:31:40,440
I want them to appreciate me.

2475
02:31:40,441 --> 02:31:43,920
So how can I use these tactics and
methods appropriately to do that?

2476
02:31:45,720 --> 02:31:47,280
What,
uh,

2477
02:31:47,310 --> 02:31:52,050
when you need to be in the zone
for coding or anything else,

2478
02:31:52,110 --> 02:31:56,430
what music do you listen to?
Ooze this. Okay, cool. That's
a great question. I Love,

2479
02:31:56,760 --> 02:32:01,330
love music. I go to, I have new,

2480
02:32:01,410 --> 02:32:05,850
a blog, audio moll, uh,
audio, molly.com audio,

2481
02:32:05,851 --> 02:32:10,710
Molly audio, molly.com. That's an
amazing, I am, we can take that.

2482
02:32:10,711 --> 02:32:13,710
A lot of directions,
Edm.

2483
02:32:13,711 --> 02:32:18,120
So it's all a lot of electronic
dance music and um, they have, uh,

2484
02:32:19,090 --> 02:32:23,700
it just sort of like the, it's
the latest stuff, but it's not,

2485
02:32:24,480 --> 02:32:28,200
it's not poppy. It's, man. I mean,
I don't care if it's popular or not,

2486
02:32:28,201 --> 02:32:31,110
it's just if it's really good,
then I really like it.

2487
02:32:31,260 --> 02:32:36,150
So I'd say lately I've listened
to a lot of electronic music, so,

2488
02:32:37,210 --> 02:32:41,930
uh, I know we've had, man, you had
someone from the glitch, mob Beretta.

2489
02:32:41,960 --> 02:32:45,720
Justin, great guy, man. I love
the glitch mob. Yeah, they're
great smile. But I mean,

2490
02:32:45,721 --> 02:32:48,310
they came out with an album maybe
a year ago or two years ago,

2491
02:32:48,311 --> 02:32:52,500
and there were my favorites. So I
would say that kind of music. Um,

2492
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:55,650
uh, like the glitch mob, I mean,

2493
02:32:56,070 --> 02:32:59,910
infected mushroom mushroom.
Yeah.

2494
02:32:59,920 --> 02:33:04,370
Another Molly Molly washroom

2495
02:33:07,400 --> 02:33:10,500
out. Those guys are amazing.
They play every year.

2496
02:33:10,501 --> 02:33:13,320
I'd never heard them play
every year at Avalon.

2497
02:33:13,321 --> 02:33:16,650
And they're always in kind of the
latest technology. And they use, um,

2498
02:33:16,860 --> 02:33:21,720
like they have these massive, uh,
most Djs, they just hit, you know,

2499
02:33:21,900 --> 02:33:24,510
some people say they hit play, some
people say the scratch, whatever.

2500
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:26,190
These guys have these massive,

2501
02:33:26,191 --> 02:33:30,870
like 42 inch plexi glass screens
in front of them that you,

2502
02:33:30,871 --> 02:33:33,420
as the audience can see,
you can see what they're doing.

2503
02:33:33,720 --> 02:33:37,830
They're plexiglass with a projection of
what they're doing on top. That's cool.

2504
02:33:37,870 --> 02:33:41,340
Sorry. Minority report. Oh, so
minority report. It's, yeah, it's,

2505
02:33:41,341 --> 02:33:44,910
it's a device called the emulator they're
using and they're tapping so everyone

2506
02:33:44,911 --> 02:33:47,580
can see what they're doing.
They're on the stage,

2507
02:33:47,640 --> 02:33:52,290
live right deejaying and uh,
it's like so futuristic.

2508
02:33:52,320 --> 02:33:56,400
It is exactly mine. Your minority
report, you know, in Edm.

2509
02:33:56,570 --> 02:34:00,750
So a electronic music cause what else?
New Lot. What was it? Infected mushroom.

2510
02:34:00,780 --> 02:34:04,800
Infected mushroom. They've been around
for many, many years in an Israeli duo.

2511
02:34:05,590 --> 02:34:09,570
This is really
proactive and they,

2512
02:34:09,571 --> 02:34:12,300
they're always keeping up to
date with sound and I think they,

2513
02:34:12,570 --> 02:34:17,190
they appreciate quality in their work.
Like I really like that. Very cool. Um,

2514
02:34:17,500 --> 02:34:20,230
I'll ask you a question I
haven't asked in a while. A,

2515
02:34:20,231 --> 02:34:25,231
if you had to conjure a face and
a name to correlate to punchable

2516
02:34:32,500 --> 02:34:37,180
punchable yeah. Okay. What
comes to mind? Oh, I don't,

2517
02:34:37,540 --> 02:34:41,350
I don't know. I don't, I don't
usually want to punch people.

2518
02:34:41,990 --> 02:34:46,990
It could be a conceptual
punchable man fo of sometimes

2519
02:34:49,150 --> 02:34:53,540
Tim. Tim, that's a fair answer.
People want to punch me.

2520
02:34:55,330 --> 02:34:59,950
I don't really want to of people shake.
You want to shake him really hard,

2521
02:35:00,190 --> 02:35:05,020
Chris? Rock stone. Yeah. Okay.
Okay. Okay. I go, I got one.

2522
02:35:05,590 --> 02:35:08,350
I don't know who they are. I
don't know their names. All right.

2523
02:35:09,130 --> 02:35:11,650
And I'm not upset at them because
I know it's not their fault,

2524
02:35:12,190 --> 02:35:17,170
but people making these maps
software's for our phones.

2525
02:35:19,690 --> 02:35:24,490
Just having driven with you recently,
this is perfect. When I phoned,

2526
02:35:24,491 --> 02:35:28,240
came out, Google maps was
there and it wasn't Google,

2527
02:35:28,241 --> 02:35:30,010
it was apple slash Google maps,

2528
02:35:30,040 --> 02:35:34,330
which was one of the most beautiful
harmonies I've ever seen. It was enough.

2529
02:35:34,360 --> 02:35:37,480
It was the most effective map
software for a mobile phone ever.

2530
02:35:38,320 --> 02:35:42,370
And then apple said, no, we
don't want your Google stuff.

2531
02:35:42,490 --> 02:35:46,240
We're going to come out with her own naps
and removed this original map software.

2532
02:35:46,540 --> 02:35:50,140
And instead of apple coming out with
beautiful software like they normally do,

2533
02:35:50,320 --> 02:35:53,830
they're like, here's some shitty
software for you. Copy your hands.

2534
02:35:54,840 --> 02:35:57,280
Uh,
and that was awful.

2535
02:35:57,430 --> 02:36:01,030
And then Google maps came out and
they came out with, they're amazing.

2536
02:36:01,031 --> 02:36:04,510
They're amazing. Google
backend. And then they're there.

2537
02:36:04,780 --> 02:36:08,470
They had to design their own APP.
So they had their Ui people and,

2538
02:36:09,010 --> 02:36:12,640
and there are UX people.
I'm not sure what Ux people,

2539
02:36:12,641 --> 02:36:16,790
but they came out their user experience
and they're like, here's like a seal.

2540
02:36:16,790 --> 02:36:19,770
It's trying to tell you how
to like get around town seal

2541
02:36:22,550 --> 02:36:24,720
with amazing backend. Like
that's what I think. Oh,

2542
02:36:24,730 --> 02:36:27,730
that's what I love about Google.
It's a bunch of engineers but that's it.

2543
02:36:28,420 --> 02:36:30,550
I need more,
more than a dozen years there.

2544
02:36:30,551 --> 02:36:33,310
I know it's so show me
more than the engineer,

2545
02:36:33,370 --> 02:36:35,770
but like I understand
the engineering backend,

2546
02:36:36,190 --> 02:36:37,900
but there's this beautiful
creative front end.

2547
02:36:37,901 --> 02:36:41,080
It's like people who actually
sit down and use their software.

2548
02:36:41,470 --> 02:36:46,470
And it was when I was shaking my phone
in anger recently and I was like yelling

2549
02:36:47,531 --> 02:36:51,190
at my Google maps and I was like,
why won't you just tell me where to go?

2550
02:36:51,670 --> 02:36:55,950
Why do I have to seven times to get
to a new directions? And it said,

2551
02:36:55,970 --> 02:36:58,990
do you have a suggestion for us? And
was like, what are you talking about?

2552
02:36:59,080 --> 02:37:01,320
What do you mean? Do I have a
suggestion? How do you know what?

2553
02:37:01,560 --> 02:37:05,100
You know what I'm saying? Are you
listening to me as possible? Um,

2554
02:37:05,320 --> 02:37:07,380
and a few days later it happened.
He be like a week you,

2555
02:37:07,381 --> 02:37:11,310
I shook my phone or naying or
yelling at it. Google maps said,

2556
02:37:11,490 --> 02:37:14,940
do you have a suggestion? And
I said, how do you know this?

2557
02:37:14,960 --> 02:37:16,880
How do you know I'm upset?
Are you like reading?

2558
02:37:17,180 --> 02:37:21,090
Is it like Scientology where the ethic
e meter and they can lay recovery your

2559
02:37:21,200 --> 02:37:25,160
like spiritual harmonics or something?
And I was like,

2560
02:37:25,161 --> 02:37:27,290
well did they must be like
listening to me. That's not cool.

2561
02:37:27,291 --> 02:37:30,830
That's an unacceptable. And then I should
have the phone and it did it again.

2562
02:37:30,850 --> 02:37:34,730
I said, oh wow. Someone
who, someone exactly.

2563
02:37:34,740 --> 02:37:38,000
Someone at Google was pissed off
enough that they're like, oh yeah,

2564
02:37:38,001 --> 02:37:42,190
I Shaked by my phone when I use
Google maps all the time about this.

2565
02:37:45,230 --> 02:37:47,720
So I mean,
you know,

2566
02:37:47,721 --> 02:37:51,140
I do love Google maps and I love Google
and they do some really cool stuff.

2567
02:37:51,141 --> 02:37:53,830
But I, I checked my
phone a lot. You went up,

2568
02:37:53,890 --> 02:37:57,650
you want to punch Google
maps and face sometimes. Uh,

2569
02:37:57,740 --> 02:38:02,170
what advice, how old are you right
now? Twins? I'm 29. Ooh Man. Again,

2570
02:38:02,230 --> 02:38:06,170
old getting old, but, uh, I think
I can reverse it. We'll see.

2571
02:38:07,110 --> 02:38:09,920
You've reversed it. I know. No,
I'm working on that. I'm just,

2572
02:38:10,190 --> 02:38:14,980
I'm just going to keep up with your
blog and all of my drug regimens.

2573
02:38:15,460 --> 02:38:20,150
Uh, what would, what advice would
you give your 20 year old self? Oh,

2574
02:38:20,180 --> 02:38:24,890
the 20 year olds subcommittee. Felonies.

2575
02:38:26,080 --> 02:38:30,290
Okay. Use a computer.
Idiot. You're sitting there.

2576
02:38:31,730 --> 02:38:34,520
What about 15? 15. Oh, okay.

2577
02:38:38,290 --> 02:38:42,770
Substance stop wasting time in
school. Uh, wasting time in school.

2578
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:47,390
I mean, it depends who, it depends who
I'm talking to. If I'm talking to myself,

2579
02:38:47,391 --> 02:38:49,340
what would I say?
Um,

2580
02:38:50,970 --> 02:38:53,560
a man. I mean, so,

2581
02:38:53,570 --> 02:38:57,290
so much I could tell
myself invest in apple.

2582
02:38:57,580 --> 02:39:02,060
Uh, exactly. Um,

2583
02:39:02,210 --> 02:39:06,680
I would say, I dunno, just, uh, you know,

2584
02:39:07,040 --> 02:39:07,880
go with the flow.

2585
02:39:08,030 --> 02:39:10,910
Like I've always tried to go with
the flow and I learned early on,

2586
02:39:10,940 --> 02:39:15,290
I think learning, like reading about
people meditating or something that just,

2587
02:39:15,291 --> 02:39:17,090
everything's kind of cool
and everything's okay.

2588
02:39:17,091 --> 02:39:21,750
If you allow that to you pretty much
in control of your own destiny. Uh,

2589
02:39:21,760 --> 02:39:25,280
I wish I could say that for myself
as much as I like, but you know,

2590
02:39:25,850 --> 02:39:26,900
you're controlling your emotions,

2591
02:39:26,901 --> 02:39:31,460
so try to not worry about things so much.

2592
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:34,300
Um, and I really try and, yeah,

2593
02:39:34,310 --> 02:39:39,310
I try not to worry about things like try
to try to be good and at this point in

2594
02:39:39,771 --> 02:39:42,260
my life, yeah. I guess I would
say I would say one thing,

2595
02:39:42,380 --> 02:39:43,640
I would say the same thing I said earlier,

2596
02:39:44,680 --> 02:39:49,490
trying to do whatever the hell you
want to feel good without intentionally

2597
02:39:49,491 --> 02:39:53,360
hurting someone else. That's what I'd
say. That's good advice. So I told myself,

2598
02:39:53,840 --> 02:39:58,840
so where can people find
you on the interwebs?

2599
02:40:00,050 --> 02:40:04,190
Other eds, your site, youtube,
all of the above. Yeah.

2600
02:40:04,910 --> 02:40:07,940
So I'm doing a, her web
doing, you know, one thing.

2601
02:40:07,941 --> 02:40:12,941
Now I'm doing a new youtube videos
and a teach and also just write very,

2602
02:40:13,951 --> 02:40:17,910
very detailed the write ups and teaching
people how to hack, how to code,

2603
02:40:17,940 --> 02:40:22,050
how to reverse engineer, uh, and
also teaching just regular consumers,

2604
02:40:22,051 --> 02:40:26,520
everyday consumers who have things
like phones and computers and cars,

2605
02:40:26,700 --> 02:40:28,510
how to protect themselves,
um,

2606
02:40:28,560 --> 02:40:31,200
and then demonstrating them really
cool exploits and vulnerabilities.

2607
02:40:31,201 --> 02:40:36,160
Like how to steal cars. Um,
so I'd say the best way,

2608
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:39,360
ways to follow me, uh, you
can follow me on Twitter.

2609
02:40:39,820 --> 02:40:44,040
I'm at Samy Kamkar, s a m y. K. A. M.

2610
02:40:44,040 --> 02:40:47,940
K are um,
or follow me on youtube,

2611
02:40:47,941 --> 02:40:52,290

Youtube username, s four, m y.

2612
02:40:52,320 --> 02:40:55,610
K. O. Jesus is terrible.
No, no, no. Say it again.

2613
02:40:55,620 --> 02:41:00,210
What does that worry is like is like a
in hacker speak. Oh wait, sorry. Sammy.

2614
02:41:00,211 --> 02:41:02,280
Can you give it to me again?
It's like Sammy Kay.

2615
02:41:02,700 --> 02:41:07,650
But Sammy Kay was taken so I
had to take s four, m y. K. Oh,

2616
02:41:07,651 --> 02:41:12,240
that's not so bad. It's, it's
Kinda bad. It's bad that it
could be worse. It wasn't,

2617
02:41:12,330 --> 02:41:16,680
he was just like, I never thought
I'd use this for m y k. Yeah.

2618
02:41:16,681 --> 02:41:19,990
I used to play like halo and Xbox.
And also as,

2619
02:41:19,991 --> 02:41:24,270
as far as a quick side note on Halo,
I had a chance at one point,

2620
02:41:24,310 --> 02:41:28,320
I really played halo once before
and then I had a chance to play,

2621
02:41:28,350 --> 02:41:30,150
I think he was a world
champion at the time.

2622
02:41:30,150 --> 02:41:34,460
A guy named fatality
and just got familiar.

2623
02:41:34,650 --> 02:41:38,060
Fucking obliterated. Oh
yeah, he's totally pro.

2624
02:41:38,061 --> 02:41:40,060
I think that's all his billboard on,
uh,

2625
02:41:40,120 --> 02:41:44,910
like lost like a Highland avenue
and Ho yeah, he's well known.

2626
02:41:44,940 --> 02:41:45,780
And I got,

2627
02:41:45,781 --> 02:41:49,980
this was a couple of years ago and it's
like wait a second game ever and just

2628
02:41:49,981 --> 02:41:51,870
got so manhandled.

2629
02:41:52,020 --> 02:41:56,790
It was utterly embarrassing.
Beyond embarrassing. Awesome.

2630
02:41:56,840 --> 02:42:01,110
All right, so we got you on Youtube.
We have you on Twitter. I will,

2631
02:42:01,170 --> 02:42:03,900
I will link to all those in the show
notes as well. And just anywhere else,

2632
02:42:03,901 --> 02:42:08,160

Dot. P L a Sammy. Dot Pl.

2633

People can find the tools as well.
You can find all my tools.

2634
02:42:11,371 --> 02:42:14,250
Almost everything I do is
open source. It's free. Uh,

2635
02:42:14,251 --> 02:42:19,251
I have a mailing list where I just send
me a sneak peeks of new vulnerability

2636
02:42:19,831 --> 02:42:22,860
research and tips on how to
protect yourself. Awesome.

2637
02:42:23,610 --> 02:42:26,050
This is a super fun. Uh, I,

2638
02:42:26,110 --> 02:42:28,910
we needed to do more of these and uh,

2639
02:42:28,950 --> 02:42:31,890
for those interested also did a TV show.

2640

This episode is brought
to you by 99 designs.

2647
02:43:01,141 --> 02:43:04,440
Your one stop shop for all
things graphic design related.

2648
02:43:04,470 --> 02:43:09,450
I've used 99 designs for everything
from banner ads to book covers,

2649
02:43:09,451 --> 02:43:12,100
including sketches and mock ups that led

2650
02:43:12,100 --> 02:43:13,150
to the four hour body,

2651
02:43:13,151 --> 02:43:17,140
which later became number one New York
Times Number One Wall Street Journal and

2652
02:43:17,170 --> 02:43:20,770
the brainstorming. A lot of it took place
with designers from around the world.

2653
02:43:20,800 --> 02:43:25,510
And here's how it works. Whether you need
a t shirt, a business card, a website,

2654
02:43:25,780 --> 02:43:28,090
an APP thumbnail,
whatever it might be,

2655
02:43:28,270 --> 02:43:31,840
you submit that project and
designers from around the world.

2656
02:43:31,990 --> 02:43:34,480
We'll send you sketches
and mock ups and designs.

2657
02:43:34,660 --> 02:43:38,140
You choose your favorite and you have an
original that you love or you get your

2658
02:43:38,141 --> 02:43:39,850
money back.
It's that straightforward,

2659
02:43:40,180 --> 02:43:43,570
and many of you who are listening have
already used it and created some amazing

2660
02:43:43,571 --> 02:43:45,940
things that I'll be sharing in the future.
But in the meantime,

2661
02:43:45,941 --> 02:43:47,710
if you want to see some
of my competitions,

Tim,

2665
02:43:59,500 --> 02:44:01,930
this podcast is brought
to you by Mizzen and main.

2666
02:44:02,200 --> 02:44:04,750
Don't worry about the spelling.
All you need to know is this.

2667
02:44:05,070 --> 02:44:09,910
I've organized my entire life around
avoiding fancy shirts because you have to

2668
02:44:09,911 --> 02:44:14,140
iron them. You sweat through
them, they smell really easily.

2669
02:44:14,141 --> 02:44:15,310
They're a pain in the ass.

2670
02:44:15,640 --> 02:44:20,620
Mizzen and main has given me
the only shirt that I need.
And what I mean by that,

2671
02:44:20,621 --> 02:44:24,910
and Kelly Starr at loves these shirts
as well, is that you can trick people,

2672
02:44:24,940 --> 02:44:28,660
they look really fancy so you can take
them out to nice dinners, whatever,

2673
02:44:28,990 --> 02:44:31,840
but they're made from athletics,
sweat wicking material.

2674
02:44:31,870 --> 02:44:35,800
So you can throw this thing into your
luggage in a heap or on your kitchen table

2675
02:44:35,801 --> 02:44:39,880
like I did recently, and then pull
it out, throw it on with no ironing,

2676
02:44:39,881 --> 02:44:41,320
no steaming,
no nothing.

2677
02:44:41,620 --> 02:44:45,580
Walk out and you could probably wear
this thing for a week straight or make it

2678
02:44:45,581 --> 02:44:50,050
your only dress shirt and take it on
trips for weeks at a time. Never wash it.

2679
02:44:50,051 --> 02:44:52,150
It will not smell.
You will not sweat through it.

2680
02:44:52,480 --> 02:44:53,560
You got to check these things out.
