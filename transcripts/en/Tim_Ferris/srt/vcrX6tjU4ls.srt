1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,870
Optimal,
minimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,871 --> 00:00:06,050
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,940
Don't know how else you
would posting a question.

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:13,590
Now it does seem like I'm a
cybernetic organism living tissue.

5
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:15,670
Oh,
we'll never interstellar.

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,560
This episode is brought to you by convert
kit, my go to email service provider.

7
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:32,250
A lot of you have asked me what I use
for email and I've been hesitant to tell

8
00:00:32,251 --> 00:00:35,100
you because I don't want to give them
the hug of death and have my own service

9
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:39,480
drop. So after much consideration
I finally said yes to convert kit.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,720
Being a sponsor email is a huge priority
for me and I trust convert kit as my e

11
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:47,610
s p my email service provider.

12
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:52,611
It's the only platform that
I can completely control
and customize and I need a

13
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:56,010
service that ensures the right information
is sent to my followers and listeners

14
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:59,670
and I cannot afford downtime.
I have very little patience for it.

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,110
So I tried all sorts of
different platforms and
ultimately selected convert kit

16
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:08,460
because they deliver on what matters most
to me and my team. Easy to use systems,

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,120
split testing,
super important and resending technology,

18
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,150
say to unopens high rates of
deliverability and excellent
customer service when

19
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:20,100
I've needed something from them when
my team has needed something from them,

20
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:21,000
they've always been there.

21
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,820
So whether you run a business or
just have a professional blog,

22
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:27,810
let's say convert kit offers email
automation which allows you to send well

23
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:31,260
timed, targeted content to your
audience or your customers.

24
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,120
The platform has all sorts of integrations
with more than 35 services including

25
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:40,170
say, hosting sites such as wordpress,
ecommerce platforms like Shopify,

26
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,760
lead capture technology like bounce
exchange or sumo and many, many more.

27
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,650
They offer plans that can adjust to meet
the size of your business and they can

28
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,484
scale with you.

29
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,050
So convert kit can handle you whether
you have a thousand people or 1 million

30
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:59,910
people on your email list. Let's take a
look, convert kit.com forward slash Tim,

31
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,680
that's Con v,

I t.com forward slash Tim and you
can get your first month for free.

33
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,280

34
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,420
make sure that it works for you and
your business and if you're like me,

35
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:16,440
hopefully fingers crossed because I only
like to recommend things that scale and

36
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:20,040
do really well for everybody. I hope
that you find they get the job done.

37
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,110
That's certainly been the case for me.

38
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:27,111

40
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,620
This episode is brought
to you by four sigmatic,

41
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,800
founded by the Genius Fin's who lit the
Internet on fire and you may have heard

42
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:43,100
of their mushroom coffee,
which features Chaga and lion's mane,

43
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:45,290
which has taken Silicon Valley by storm.

44
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,200
I use it pretty much every day,

45
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:52,070
either that or the Chaga,
which is decaf.

46
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:56,000
There's a separate version and I use
both of these primarily for focus and

47
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:56,691
productivity.

48
00:02:56,691 --> 00:03:01,060
They just get you going let
you up like a Christmas tree,

49
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,800
so definitely check it out.

50
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,450
People are always asking me what I use
for cognitive enhancement and for right

51
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:12,130
now this is the answer. I try to
force this on all of my house guests.

52
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,510
It is a hell of a thing.

53
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:17,230
If I have employees or people come over
who are working on projects with me,

54
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:21,100
I always try to feed it to them because
I'm going to get the limitless effect

55
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,750
and get a lot more out of them.

56
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,820
The first time I mentioned this product
and four sigmatic on the podcast,

57
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,980
their product sold out
in less than a week,

58
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,230
so you may want to check them out soon.

59
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:35,530
If you're listening to this and
the coffee tastes like coffee,

60
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,250
it takes just seconds to
prepare with hot water.

61
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,420
And oddly enough only includes
40 milligrams of caffeine,

62
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:46,270
so it has less than half of what
you'd get in a regular cup of coffee.

63
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,650
I don't get any jitters, acid reflux
or any stomach burn, any of that.

64
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,740
It's very unusual and very, very
cool. So if you don't like caffeine,

65
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,460
they also offer very strong,
but caffeine free mushroom elixirs,

66
00:03:59,461 --> 00:04:03,330
which I will sometimes have
in the evening. I find Chaga
specifically to be very,

67
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:06,270
very grounding and earthy.
So that is another option.

68
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:09,930
And I have a cupboard full of
their products, uh, at the moment,

69
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:13,020
which is right around the corner of
my kitchen. You can try something.

70
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:14,070
You can try sample pack,

71
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:19,020
which is great also right now by going
to foursigmatic.com forward slash. Tim,

72
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:23,610
that's foursigmatic, F, O,

73
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,271

if you are in the experimental mindset,

76
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,430
I do not think you'll be disappointed,
so try them out.

77
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,130
No ladies and germs.

78
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:43,640
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

79
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:47,000
it is my job to interview
people from many diverse fields,

80
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,150
different arenas of
competition or lack thereof,

81
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:55,400
to dissect what makes them the
best at what they do, the habits,

82
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,270
routines, philosophies,
beliefs, et Cetera, that you
can apply in your own life.

83
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:04,220
This episode we have
Sharon Salzberg as AOL, z.

84
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,280
B. E. R. G. You can find her on Twitter.

85
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,580
I believe it's just at Sharon Salzberg
and Sharon is a central figure in the

86
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:14,900
field of meditation,

87
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,140
a world renowned teacher and New
York Times bestselling author.

88
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:22,700
She has played a crucial role from
the very beginning in some respects in

89
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:27,050
bringing meditation and mindfulness
practices to the West and very much into

90
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:32,051
mainstream culture since 1974 when she
first began teaching c is the cofounder

91
00:05:32,871 --> 00:05:34,940
of the insight Meditation
Society in Barre,

92
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:38,600
Massachusetts and the author of several
books including the New York Times

93
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:41,540
bestseller, real happiness for
seminal work, loving kindness,

94
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,730
which we'll get into in
real happiness at work,

95
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:49,510
very well known for her down to Earth
Style and you'll get a firsthand view of

96
00:05:49,731 --> 00:05:50,750
that when you listen to this.

97
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,080
She offers a secular and modern approach
to Buddhist teachings making them more

98
00:05:56,361 --> 00:06:01,240
accessible than I think some of the
esoteric varieties would be two,

99
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:06,250
type a personalities like you friend
listening to this podcast probably she's a

100
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:09,920
columnist for on being a contributor to
Huffington post and the host of her own

101
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:14,590
podcast, the Metta hour,
m, e, t, t a, and a.

102
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,040
We will get into what that means.
Her newest book is real love,

103
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,480
the art of mindful connection.
And I wanted to speak with
Sharon for a long time.

104
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:24,380
I've read her work,

105
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,590
I've heard her audio and it's very
meaningfully impacted how I operate in the

106
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:31,070
world,

107
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:36,070
how I perceived myself and others and
ultimately that has made me both more

108
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:39,920
effective and given me a
greater sense of wellbeing.

109
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,980
So I hope that you pull some
of that from this conversation.

110
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,450
We bounced all over the place.

111
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,320
I ask some very personal self
interested questions, uh,

112
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:52,880
which I think make the
answers practical also and a,

113
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:53,840
there you have it.

114
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,900
So I hope you enjoy as much as I did this
wide ranging conversation with Sharon

115
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,130
Salzberg. Sharon, welcome to the show.

116
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,213
Thank you.

117
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:11,030
I have been looking forward to this
conversation for some time and I'm glad we

118
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:15,170
could finally make it happen.
The construction around
your apartment in New York,

119
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:17,950
not withstanding and uh,

120
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:22,940
I know that you have to
be out, uh, at a set time.

121
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:27,941
So I'd like to just jump right into it
and begin at the beginning in a sense

122
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,850
with a question related to your youth
and if you're comfortable sharing the

123
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:39,050
story. Could you tell us about
your experience that you had?

124
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:43,400
I think it was at nine years old when you
were dressed in your Halloween costume

125
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:44,780
and watching Nat King Cole.

126
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,240
Yes. I, uh,

127
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,690
my mother died when I was nine and it
was that night when I was nine that my

128
00:07:51,691 --> 00:07:56,010
mother started hemorrhaging. I was alone
in the house with her and, and she, uh,

129
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:00,060
I got ended up getting an ambulance and
she went to the hospital and she died

130
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:02,180
about two weeks later.
And um,

131
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,060
it was much later when I was
writing a book called faith,

132
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:11,061
which is kind of like my faith journey
that I looked back over my life from the

133
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:13,890
time it was born till the
time I went to college at 16.

134
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,640
And I realized that I had lived in five
different family configurations along

135
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,111
that time.

136
00:08:19,111 --> 00:08:24,111
And each one of them had been
altered by trauma or death or a,

137
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,090
some kind of really no
terrible circumstance.

138
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:32,810
And what, what was your relationship like
with your father when you were younger?

139
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,280
Well, my parents had had
divorced when I was four.

140
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:42,500
And my father, as far as I can recall,
it was really like my hero, you know,

141
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:46,460
he was, he was the love in my
life. And then he was just gone.

142
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,810
He completely disappeared and there
was no contact whatsoever. Uh,

143
00:08:50,811 --> 00:08:54,640
from the time I lived with my mother
after I was, after they split up, uh,

144
00:08:54,641 --> 00:08:58,520
on her siblings from the time I was
fortunate the time I was nine. And, um,

145
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,450
at that point, after she died, I ended
