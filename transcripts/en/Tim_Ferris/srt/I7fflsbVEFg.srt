1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,580
I guys, this is Tim Ferriss. Going
to cover some basics of dog training.

2
00:00:03,581 --> 00:00:04,361
I'm not a dog trainer,

3
00:00:04,361 --> 00:00:08,110
but I thought I would share what I've
learned from going over 2030 books and

4
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:11,620
working with a number of trainers.
The first is a prerequisite skill.

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,210
This is Molly. Good Molly.
So the prerequisite skill
number one is attention.

6
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:19,000
You want to get eye contact,
and I have mentioned this once before,

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,800
but this is how this works.

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,070
So let's just say she comes over
prerequisite skill number two.

9
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:28,630
I'll show you what this is is.
So that's called hand targeting.

10
00:00:28,631 --> 00:00:29,860
We're going to talk
about that in a second,

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,100
but let's just say we come down
and pretending that she's not.

12
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:37,390
This is a clicker pretending that
she's no, no, that's a different trick.

13
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,120
Then we have eye contact
and you go out to the side.

14
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,680
She looks at me and I give her the treat.
All right.

15
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:47,860
So I am training her to
constantly check in with her eyes

16
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,430
and the clicker makes it very fast,

17
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:58,540
very consistent because if
you're like nice doggy, good
doggy, Yay, Molly, whatever,

18
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:02,200
it's not consistent and it's not going
to impart the conditioning that you want.

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,040
Okay. The way that that
then develops, leave it.

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,150
Okay.

21
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,680
So then you can start to instill self
control in your dog and discipline.

22
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:16,420
This is very,
very important for safety.

23
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:19,450
Now she might have some water
because this stuff is dry.

24
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,940
So you can see the,
okay,

25
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,980
the [inaudible] is a stop
or the eye as a stop. Uh,

26
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:32,140
I was also negative reward marker.
I'm going to get to that.

27
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,700
But the hand targeting is number two.
So first in India,

28
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,830
she's constantly checking in with me,
looking at me, waiting, waiting, waiting.

29
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,450
And I'll have her sit to
say please for everything.

30
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,940
So if we come over, Yup. Okay.

31
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,540
And then down. Up. All right,

32
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,980
so sit is pleased. That's true.
Coming out of the door. That's true.

33
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,900
Getting out of the car before going
through a door. Always. I have her sit,

34
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,650
I walk through.
I always go through first,

35
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,040
then she checks with me and then okay,
and that's the release word.

36
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,380
And there's a lot of debate about
using okay as the release word,

37
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:17,510
I think it's fine. 99 times out of 999
times out of a thousand. All right,

38
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,720
so hand targeting and this is
something you can do very easily with,

39
00:02:20,721 --> 00:02:24,920
say puppies also get them used to poking
your hand with their nose and you use

40
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:26,630
the clicker to tell them when
they're doing it correctly.

41
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,850
So if you want it to get a dog to heel,
for instance,

42
00:02:28,851 --> 00:02:31,760
you could put peanut butter on your hand
and I haven't done this with her so it

43
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:33,620
may not work.
But watch if I do this,

44
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,880
she'll follow the hand and then poke it
with their nose and then I gave her a

45
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:39,410
treat. So it would have clicked. Right?

46
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:41,780
If you're working with a puppy and trying
to get it to follow the taste on your

47
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:44,300
hand,
that's a very good way to train heel.

48
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,500
You can also do it with a wall on this
opposite side. Very, very common. Okay.

49
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,750
But still is kind of a, a
vanity trick. All right,

50
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll show you another vanity trick.
Okay.

51
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,210
Yeah. So she's, she
loves jumping into heal.

52
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,400
But another vanity trick would be stay

53
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,140
stay as a safety trick. Okay. So safety
behaviors, safety tricks and number one,

54
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,800
vanity trek or something like
this. I thought, all right.

55
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,770
Okay. So high fives and catches
do not keep the dog alive,

56
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,330
but they might impress a dinner guest
or something like that. Right? So down

57
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,350
I do like rollover, that kind
of stuff. Also vanity tricks,

58
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,560
very simple stuff.
And uh,

59
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,590
but I'll show you how we would use a
clicker to teach something like rollover.

60
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,740
Okay. And then this is true for many
different tricks and it's a progression.

61
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:49,420
It's really just conditioned
response. Okay. Down is,

62
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,120
so she knows this trick obviously already,

63
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,650
but you would use the food to get the dog
to follow your hand like this and then

64
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:02,530
click as they get closer
and closer to the behavior,

65
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:03,700
they don't have to complete it first.

66
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,690
They just have to make an inch of progress
in the right direction. Click, click,

67
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:10,930
click. And then eventually
you would fade the lure.

68
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,450
So you lose the food
and use the same motion,

69
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,040
give the food, and then you start to
make it smaller and smaller. Sorry.

70
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,370
It's sorry food. It's like sign
language. It's conditioned now. Uh,

71
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,280
and that way you get to the point where
you can do something. For instance,

72
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,640
another vanity trick would be turning,
right? So you get your doctor's spin.

73
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,420
Now you start by using the food to get
them to follow it and then you get to the

74
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:44,210
point. So this is her default.
This is a new default behavior. Um,

75
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,990
when I walk with her outside and
I do a lot of off leash training,

76
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,920
but you can see that the spin,
I just need this type of emotion.

77
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,510
And it started off like this,

78
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:54,460
getting rid of bu effectively
chase their tail staying.

79
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,640
And you do the same thing where as you
provide the food and get them to move

80
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:04,090
their body or head in a certain way and
then you lose the food and then you make

81
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:08,080
it smaller. You can get them to do
things like any Molly take a bath.

82
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,780
So as to take the bow, uh, and, and,

83
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,920
and you can really get
creative with this stuff.

84
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:19,150
The clicker is incredibly important.
And Karen Pryor don't shoot the dog.

85
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,330
And then command performance are really,
really helpful.

86
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:25,690
But let's just say using the clicker,
I'll show you some stuff you can do.

87
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,231
You can,

88
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:29,320
you can get into very what people might
think of a sophisticate behaviors.

89
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:34,180
These are actually really simple. So
cute. Alright. And then let's say she's,

90
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,400
I want her to do a quarter
turn. Okay. Quarter term.

91
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,040
So a quarter turns pretty easy. Let's
say we want to do backwards turn, okay.

92
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,880
Or I want to do through the
legs, spin around, back to heal.

93
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,810
And then let's say she's a little
bit too far forward back girl.

94
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,220
So, so those are some basic
trick that you can see.

95
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:02,140
She's very well behaved and if I give her,
say good about.

96
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,670
All right, so let's say this
was something poisonous. Okay,

97
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll give her one just cause
she went to bed, but okay,

98
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,960
leave it.
All right,

99
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,380
so let's just say that was something
covered with paint or arsenic or some

100
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:20,240
miscellaneous object.
On the side of the road.

101
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,580
I want to be able to keep
her from eating that,

102
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,720
which I can do because we've practiced
all of this hundreds and thousands of

103
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:30,560
times, and then she checks in and I go,
okay. And then she can eat it. Right?

104
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,190
So priority number one with training
your dog is keeping your dog safe.

105
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,250
Priority number two is keeping other
people safe prior to number three is

106
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:42,200
entertainment or anything else.
Okay?

107
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,580
So those are some of the
basics of doctrinal. Be Nice,

108
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:51,740
be consistent, and good luck. Thanks for
watching guys. I hope you enjoyed it.
