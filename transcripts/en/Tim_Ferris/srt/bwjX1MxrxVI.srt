1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,790
Optimal at this altitude,

2
00:00:02,791 --> 00:00:05,970
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,530
I'm a cybernetic organism.

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,380
This episode is brought to
you by Wealthfront and this
is a very unique sponsor.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,180
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive
in a good way, set it and forget it.

6
00:00:32,181 --> 00:00:36,530
Investing service led by technologists
from places like apple and world famous

7
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:37,280
investors.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,000
It has exploded in popularity in the last
two years and they now have more than

9
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:44,000
two and a half billion dollars
under management. In fact,

10
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,380
some of my very good friends,

11
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,560
investors in silicon valley have millions
of their own money in Wealthfront.

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,650
So the question is why? Why is
it so popular? Why is it unique?

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,940
Because you can get services previously
reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

14
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:57,920
pay pennies on the dollar for them.

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,640
And this is because they use smarter
software instead of retail locations,

16
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:04,400
bloated sales teams, et cetera. And
I'll come back to that in a second.

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,560
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com
forward slash Tim take the risk

18
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:12,800
assessment quiz which only takes two to
five minutes and they'll show you for

19
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:16,610
free exactly the portfolio they'd put
you in and if you just want to take their

20
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:20,540
advice, run with it, do it yourself,
you can do that or as I would,

21
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:22,430
you can set it and
forget it and here's why.

22
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,720
The value of Wealthfront is in the
automation of habits and strategies that

23
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:31,190
investors should be using on a regular
basis but normally aren't great investing

24
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,000
is a marathon,

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,330
not a sprint and little things that you
may or may not be familiar with like

26
00:01:35,331 --> 00:01:38,630
automatic tax loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

27
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,130
cross more than 10 asset classes and
dividend reinvestment add up to very large

28
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:46,850
amounts of money over longer periods
of time. Wealth Front, as I mentioned,

29
00:01:46,851 --> 00:01:49,460
since it's using software
instead of retail locations,

30
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:53,630
etc. Can offer all of this at low
costs that were previously completely

31
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:55,130
impossible right off the bat.

32
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,650
You never pay commissions or
account fees for everything.

33
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:02,651
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above
the first 15,000 which is managed for

34
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:07,010
free. If you use my link,
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim,

35
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,140
that is less than $5 a month to invest
a $30,000 account for instance. Now,

36
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:13,740
normally when I have a
sponsor on this show,

37
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:17,330
it's because I use them and
recommend them. In this case,
it's a little different.

38
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,630
I don't use Wealthfront yet because
I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal.

39
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,890
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of sec regulations,

40
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,550
companies that invest your money are
not allowed to use client testimonials.

41
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:32,370
So I couldn't be a user end
have them on the podcast,

42
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,480
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront
that I've invested a significant

43
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:40,320
amount of my own money, at least for me,
uh, in the team and the company itself.

44
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,470
So I am an investor and hope
to soon use it as a client.

45
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,950
Now back to the recommendation
as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

46
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:50,850
you'll get $15,000 managed for free
if you decide to open an account.

47
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,850

that they would suggest for you.

downside that I can think of.

50
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,710
Just take a look,

51
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,010
see what portfolio they would create
for you and you can use that information

Hello Ladies and germs.

69
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:10,600
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

70
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,380
This is a special edition where I'm going
to share an excerpt from my favorite

71
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:17,290
book of all time and in fact
it is a collection of letters,

72
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,620
roughly 2000 years old that I reread
at least once a quarter from Seneca,

73
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,280
the younger,

74
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,390
these are the moral letters to Achilleas
that I've compiled into the town of

75
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:33,391
Seneca and this particular example is a
letter 17 on philosophy and riches and

76
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:38,350
Seneca takes a little while with
his preamble to get warmed up,

77
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:43,510
but my favorite portion begins with,
I might close my letter at this point.

78
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,340
Say you can use that as a bookmark.

79
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:50,200
I might close my letter at this point
and I was talking to a friend of mine,

80
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,730
uh,
about Seneca.

81
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:56,230
He's a huge fan also and he said what
I agree with and that is I went back

82
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:58,990
through my notes and start to compile
a list of the ideas I had the biggest

83
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:00,430
impact on me letter by letter,

84
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,760
but going through I realized that what
makes Seneca so unique is the common

85
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:10,780
threads that flow through
different letters.

86
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,870
So it's very hard to just take one
letter although they are valuable.

87
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,710
So I encourage you to check out all
of these letters and you can find

88
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:21,880
them@ataudible.com
forward slash Tim's books.

89
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:25,900
It's a three volume set of all of these
letters because I wanted to listen to

90
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:28,930
them in audio and could not find
it and that's how it got created.

91
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:34,410
So please enjoy on philosophy and riches
by Seneca and I hope you find it as

92
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:36,010
valuable as I have.

93
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,130
Let her 17 on philosophy and riches

94
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,840
castaway,
everything of that sort if you are wise,

95
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:53,470
nay rather that you may be wise strive
toward a sound mind at top speed.

96
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:55,600
And with your whole strengths.

97
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,500
If any holds you back tired or severance,

98
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,670
but you say,
my estate delays me,

99
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,080
I wished to make such disposition of it
that it may suffice for me when I have

100
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:13,760
nothing to do last, either poverty
be a burden to me or I myself,

101
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:18,350
a burden to others.
You do not see him when you say this,

102
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:21,830
to know the strength and power of
that good which you are considering.

103
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,860
You do indeed grasp the
all important thing,

104
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,500
the great benefit which
philosophy confers,

105
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,640
but you do not yet mr an
accurately its various functions,

106
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,230
nor do you yet know how great is the
help we receive from philosophy in

107
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:41,210
everything, everywhere, how
to use CICERO's language.

108
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,360
It not only suckers us
in the greatest matters,

109
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:48,260
but also descends to the smallest.
Take my advice,

110
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,870
call wisdom into consultation.

111
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,160
She will advise you not to
sit forever at your ledger.

112
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,230
Doubtless your object,

113
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,850
what you wish to attain by
such postponement of your
studies is that poverty may

114
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:03,440
not have to be feared by you,

115
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:09,250
but what if it is something to be desired
which is of shut off many a man from

116
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:13,730
the attainment of wisdom.
Poverty is unburdened and free from care.

117
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,200
When the trumpet sounds, the poor man
knows that he is not being attacked.

118
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,630
When there was a cry of fire,

119
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,280
he only seeks a way of escape and
does not ask what he can save.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If the poor man must go to see the
Harvard is not rezoned nor to the wharves

121
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:33,890
bustle with the retinue of one individual.

122
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:39,490
No throng of slaves surrounds the poor
man slaves for whose mouths the master

123
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:42,680
must covered the fertile crops
of regions beyond the sea.

124
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,930
It is easy to fill a few stomachs when
they are well trained and crave nothing

125
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:51,320
else but to be filled.
Hunger costs,

126
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:56,321
but little squeamishness costs much
poverty is contented with fulfilling,

127
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,360
pressing needs.

128
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,800
Why then should you reject
philosophy as a comrade?

129
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,670
Even the rich man copies her
ways when he is in his senses.

130
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,550
If you wish to have leisure for your mind,

131
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,660
either be a poor man
or resemble a poor man.

132
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:20,410
Study cannot be helpful unless you take
pains to live simply and living simply

133
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:23,180
is voluntary poverty oh way.

134
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:28,181
Then with all excuses like I have not
yet enough when I have gained the desired

135
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:29,090
amount.

136
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:34,090
Then I showed the vote myself wholly to
philosophy and yet this ideal which you

137
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:38,810
are putting off and placing second
to other interests should be secured.

138
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:43,370
First of all, you should
begin with it. You retort.

139
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,810
I wish to acquire something to live on.
Yes,

140
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,640
but learn while you are acquiring it
for if anything forbids you to live. No.

141
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,010
Nobody. Nothing for bids
you to die. No Glee.

142
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,680
There is no reason why poverty, you
should call us away from philosophy. No,

143
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:05,670
nor even actual wand for
when hastening after wisdom.

144
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,890
We must endure even hunger.

145
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,140
Men have endured hunger when there are
towns were besieged and what other reward

146
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:16,800
for their endurance did they obtain then
that that they did not fall under the

147
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:17,970
conquerors power.

148
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,100
How much greater is the promise of the
prize of everlasting liberty and the

149
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:26,400
assurance that we need fear.
Neither God nor man.

150
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,390
Even though we starve,
we must reach that goal.

151
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,890
Armies have endured all manner of want,
have lived on roots,

152
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,430
and have resisted hunger by
means of food to revolting.

153
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:41,760
To mention all this,
they have suffered to gain a kingdom.

154
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:47,030
And what is more marvelous to gain a
kingdom that will be you and others will

155
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:52,440
any man hesitate to endure poverty in
order that he may free his mind from

156
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:56,370
madness. Therefore, one
should not seek to lay up.

157
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:59,940
Rich's first one may attain to philosophy.
However,

158
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,090
even without money for
the journey it is indeed.

159
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:06,720
So after you have come to
possess all other things,

160
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,910
should you then wish to possess wisdom?

161
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,990
Also his philosophy to be
the last requisite in life,

162
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:17,370
a sort of supplement, nay.
Your plan should be this.

163
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,620
Be a philosopher.
Now,

164
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,580
whether you have anything or
not for if you have anything,

165
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:28,140
how do you know that you have not too
much already, but if you have nothing,

166
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,440
seek understanding first
before anything else,

167
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,760
but you say,
I shall lack the necessities of life

168
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,700
in the first place.

169
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:43,701
You cannot lock them because nature
demands but little and the wise man suits

170
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,480
his needs to nature.

171
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,140
But if the utmost pinch of need arrives,

172
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:52,650
he will quickly take leave of life
and cease being a trouble to himself.

173
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,090
If however his means of
existence are meager and scanty,

174
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,410
he will make the best of them without
being anxious or worried about anything

175
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,240
more than the bare necessities.

176
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:08,870
He will do justice to his belly and his
shoulders with free and happy spirit.

177
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:12,930
He will laugh at the bustling of Richmond
and the flurried ways of those who are

178
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:17,931
hastening after wealth and say why of
your own accord postpone your real life to

179
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:22,620
the distant future.
Shall you wait for some interest to fall,

180
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:26,340
do or for some income on your
merchandise or for a place in the,

181
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:30,300
we'll have some wealthy old man
when you can be rich here in now.

182
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,810
Wisdom offers wealth in ready money and
pays it over to those in whose eyes she

183
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:38,210
has made wealth superfluous.

184
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:44,160
These remarks refer to other men.
You are nearer the rich class.

185
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,910
Change the age in which you
live and you have too much,

186
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,040
but in every age,
what is enough remains the same.

187
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,370
I might close my letter at this point
if I had not got you into bad habits.

188
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,560
One cannot greet Parthian royalty without
bringing a gift. And in your case,

189
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:06,990
I cannot say farewell
without paying a price,

190
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,070
but what of it I showed
borrow from Epicurus?

191
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,240
The acquisition of Rich's has
been for many men, not an end,

192
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,000
but a change of troubles.

193
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:24,230
I do not wonder for the
fault is not in the wealth,

194
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,910
but in the mind itself that would should
made poverty a burden to us has made

195
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:34,780
riches also a burden just
as it matters little,

196
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:39,781
whether you lay a sick man on a wooden
or on a golden bed for whither soever he

197
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:42,430
be move.
He will carry his malady with him.

198
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So one need not care whether the diseased
mind is bestowed upon riches or upon

199
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:52,510
poverty.
His malady goes with the man

200
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,633
stairwell.

201
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,440
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

202
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,410
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

203
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,710
Do you want to get a short email from me?

204
00:13:10,711 --> 00:13:14,850
Would you enjoy getting a short email
from me every Friday that provides a

205
00:13:14,851 --> 00:13:18,390
little more soul of fun before the
weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

206
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:22,740
short email where I share the coolest
things I've found or that I've been

207
00:13:22,741 --> 00:13:24,060
pondering over the week.

208
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,060
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

209
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:30,510
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

210
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:34,800
somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

211
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,100
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

212
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,470
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

213
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,540
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

214
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,760
So if you want to receive that,

223
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:21,120
I used 99 designs to get book cover
prototypes for the four hour body,

235
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,180
This episode is brought to
you by Wealthfront and this
is a very unique sponsor.

236
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,980
Wealthfront is a massively disruptive
in a good way, set it and forget it.

237
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:14,360
Investing service led by technologists
from places like apple and world famous

238
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:15,110
investors.

239
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,800
It has exploded in popularity in the last
two years and they now have more than

240
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:21,770
two and a half billion dollars
under management. In fact,

241
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,180
some of my very good friends,

242
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:26,360
investors in silicon valley have millions
of their own money in Wealthfront.

243
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:29,450
So the question is why? Why is
it so popular? Why is it unique?

244
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,740
Because you can get services previously
reserved for the ultra wealthy but only

245
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:35,690
pay pennies on the dollar for them,

246
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,440
and this is because they use smarter
software instead of retail locations,

247
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:42,200
bloated sales teams, et cetera. And
I'll come back to that in a second.

248
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:47,360
I suggest you check out wealthfront.com
forward slash Tim take the risk

249
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:48,111
assessment quiz,

250
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:52,010
which only takes two to five minutes and
they'll show you for free exactly the

251
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:54,950
portfolio they'd put you in.
And if you just want to take their advice,

252
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,340
run with it, do it yourself.
You can do that or as I would,

253
00:15:58,341 --> 00:16:00,230
you can set it and forget it.
Here's why.

254
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,550
The value of Wealthfront is in the
automation of habits and strategies that

255
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:07,940
investors should be using on a
regular basis but normally aren't.

256
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,610
Great investing is a marathon,
not a sprint,

257
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,300
and little things that you may or may
not be familiar with like automatic tax

258
00:16:14,301 --> 00:16:16,430
loss harvesting,
rebalancing your portfolio,

259
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,930
cross more than 10 asset classes and
dividend reinvestment add up to very large

260
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:24,650
amounts of money over longer periods
of time. Wealthfront, as I mentioned,

261
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,260
since it's using software
instead of retail locations,

262
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:31,430
etc. Can offer all of this at low
costs that were previously completely

263
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:32,930
impossible.
Right off the bat,

264
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,480
you never pay commissions or
account fees for everything.

265
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:40,481
They charge 0.25% per year on assets above
the first 15,000 which is managed for

266
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:44,810
free. If you use my link,
wealthfront.com forward slash Tim,

267
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,940
that is less than $5 a month to invest
a $30,000 account for instance. Now,

268
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:51,560
normally when I have a
sponsor on this show,

269
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:55,130
it's because I use them and
recommend them. In this case
it's a little different.

270
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,420
I don't use Wealthfront yet because
I'm not allowed to. Here's the deal.

271
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:03,680
They wanted to sponsor this podcast,
but because of SCC regulations,

272
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,370
companies that invest your money are
not allowed to use client testimonials.

273
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:10,160
So I couldn't be a user end
have them on the podcast,

274
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,270
but I've been so impressed by Wealthfront
that I've invested a significant

275
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:18,140
amount of my own money, at least for me,
uh, in the team and the company itself.

276
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,200
So I am an investor and hope
to soon use it as a client.

277
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,770
Now back to the recommendation
as a Tim Ferriss show listener,

278
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:28,640
you'll get $15,000 managed for free
if you decide to open an account.

279
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,610
But just start with seeing the portfolio
that they would suggest for you.

280
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,840
Take two minutes, fill out their
questionnaire@wealthfront.com
forward slash. Tim,

281
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,460
it's fast, it's free. There's no downside
that I can think of. Just take a look,

282
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,380
see what portfolio they
would create for you,

283
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,360
and you can use that
information however you want.

284
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,440
wealthfront.com forward slash
Tim and until next time,

285
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,670
thank you for listening.
