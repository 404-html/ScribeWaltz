Optimal at this altitude,

00:00:02,851 --> 00:00:07,830
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking it.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,400
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

this episode is brought
to you by wordpress,

45
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:14,980
my goto platform for blogging. Writing
Online, creating websites, everything.

46
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,940
I love wordpress to bits.
My site,

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
every site just about that I have is run
on wordpress and the lead developer of

48
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:29,410
wordpress, Matt Mullenweg has
appeared on this podcast many times.

49
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,710
The very first episode
in particular is amazing.

50
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:37,270
The second I took a ton of notes on,
so he's checking out, but wordpress,

51
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:41,770
where do I even begin? I mean the
New Yorker uses it, Jay z, Beyonce,

52
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:45,250
they use it five 38 tech crunch,
Ted CNN time.

53
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,440
Whether you are looking to create a
personal blog, a business site, both,

54
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,090
neither,
something else,

55
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,180
you'll make a huge impact when you
build your website on wordpress.com and

56
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,720
directly from some friends at Google.
I'm not going to quote them by name,

57
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:06,670
but they say that wordpress offers
the best out of the box SEO.

58
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,960
That's search engine optimization
imaginable, so if you're on wordpress,

59
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:16,230
you immediately have a leg up on everybody
else on search engines and so forth.

60
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,440
In my experience, I'm no medical
doctor of search engine optimization,

61
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:26,460
but I will say that I used wordpress
for years and fell in love with it.

62
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:31,720
To the extent that I became very
close friends with Matt and then uh,

63
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,860
became an investor slash
advisor to automatic,

64
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:39,070
which runs wordpress sock on that is how
much I believe in this and that's how a

65
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:44,071
lot of my most successful products and
investments have come about because I'm

66
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:47,440
in love with x and then I seek out x.

67
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,680
Nearly 30% of the Internet
is run on wordpress and that
includes everything from

68
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:57,610
the huge sites that I mentioned to
neighborhood sites and it is super easy to

69
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:01,330
get started. There's no need to worry
about security or upgrades or hosting.

70
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,840
They offer 24 seven support
and handle all of that,

71
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,700
which allows you to focus on creating
the highest quality content that you can

72
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,360
with the least amount of friction.
I don't have to worry about downtime.

73
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,440
I don't want to have to
worry about getting emergency
emails if I'm on vacation

74
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:21,850
or something like that. And wordpress
is my goto solution for all of this.

75
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,880
I trust all of my most important text
on the Internet to wordpress and they

76
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:31,510
can't buy that with a sponsorship.
They can't buy that with anything.

77
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,900
I want uptime, uptime,
uptime, and quality,

78
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:38,050
and that is what I have selected
after everything that I've looked at.

79
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,270
So check it out.
Go to wordpress,

80
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,330
that's w o r d p r e s s.com wordpress.com

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,890
That's wordpress.com forward slash Tim.

83
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,171
Hello boys and girls.

84
00:05:57,171 --> 00:06:00,230
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to another
episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where

85
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:04,460
it is my job each and every episode to
deconstruct world class performers of all

86
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:07,340
different types, whether from
chess, athletics, entertainment,

87
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:10,280
military or otherwise, to
tease out the habits, routines,

88
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:14,270
favorite books and so on that you
can test and apply in your own life.

89
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,980
This episode is a little bit
different by popular request.

90
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:23,981
We have Rhonda Patrick Phd at found my
fitness on the socials who is an American

91
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:27,830
biochemist and scientist.
Now,

92
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:32,390
whether you want to extend
life inexpensively by a
stem cell insurance policy,

93
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,810
you have read about that in tools
of titans or guard against cancer.

94
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:39,590
Rhonda has some very valuable
insights and experiences as well as

95
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:41,780
recommendations in this episode.

96
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,950
She tackles many of your most
popular requested topics.

97
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:49,850
This includes many things I've talked
about before that you guys have wanted

98
00:06:49,851 --> 00:06:54,290
more detail and specifics on best
practices for fasting. For instance,

99
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,650
what blood tests are most important
for analyzing overall health?

100
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,870
The minimum effective dose
for the benefits of Sauna
and different types of heat

101
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,520
exposure, heat versus cold exposure.
We've talked about cold baths before,

102
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,850
how can they be used and how
should they be used effectively?

103
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,180
The most effective smart drugs nootropics,

104
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,800
thousands of you have asked me for this,
the latest fat loss research and much,

105
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:21,050
much more.
A little background on Rhonda.

106
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,830
She is known for her studies of the
mechanistic link between Vitamin D and

107
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:28,670
Serotonin production research that may
have important implications for the

108
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:33,080
understanding of autism and other
disorders and she also has a very popular

109
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:37,580
podcast found my fitness.
Dr. Patrick also conducts clinical trials,

110
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:41,810
has performed aging research at the Salk
Institute for Biological Studies and

111
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:45,230
did graduate research at St Jude's
Children's Research Hospital,

112
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,590
which I've had some involvement
with where she focused on cancer,

113
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,320
mitochondrial metabolism and apoptosis.

114
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,560
So I hope you enjoy this conversation,

115
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:58,820
which is really a master class with
Rhonda Patrick as much as I did.

116
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,953
Thanks for listening.

117
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,290
Hi Guys. Rhonda, Patrick here. Happy
to be here today to get things started.

118
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:11,060
Let's take an opening question from
Tim Ferriss. Tim Asks, what new areas,

119
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:15,260
experiments, discoveries, or hypotheses
are you most excited about these days?

120
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,770
Thankfully because I put a certain
percentage of my brain out here on the

121
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:19,250
Internet,

122
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,460
much of what I'm actively interested in
these days or have an interested in is

123
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:26,720
actually elucidated a little
bit as necessary context
for some of the questions

124
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:28,160
I'm going to answer here shortly,

125
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,360
but Tim's question does sort of give
a nice opportunity for an overview.

126
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,291
As a rule,

127
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:37,250
the things that usually get me really
revved up are ultimately optimizations

128
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:40,400
that we can make to our lifestyles that
might increase our functional health

129
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:44,660
span, our wellbeing, and lastly,
cognitive and physical performance.

130
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,180
Usually through deeper
understandings of biology,

131
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,080
health span or healthy functional
lifespan is especially of interest to me.

132
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,450
I sort of lead with that.
To me,

133
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:57,420
health span is living for as as we
can while doing our best to prevent

134
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:59,610
deterioration from the diseases of aging.

135
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,910
Talking about increasing health span is
one thing though often achieving it is a

136
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:04,080
different thing altogether.

137
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:08,490
The reason this is tricky is that the
most reliable way to treat aging is to try

138
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:13,200
to instead prevent it and
natural extension of that
fact means that the earlier

139
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:16,890
we start the better shot we have of
making a large cumulative effect over the

140
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:17,970
course of our lives.

141
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,330
Now the specifics of how to best
mitigate the damaging effects of aging

142
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:25,530
specifically is subject to a little bit
of individual variation as a consequence

143
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,780
of each of our little
genetic idiosyncrasies,

144
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,420
the combination of which
are unique to each of us.

145
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,780
This is an area that I'm especially
interested in and that I plan to invest a

146
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,270
little bit more into intellectually
in the coming months,

147
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,770
especially the interface between nutrition
and genetics known as nutrogenomix.

148
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,370
But the good news is there are certain
rule of thumb strategies that are able to

149
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:47,250
have a positive effect on health
and possibly even longevity.

150
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,870
In some cases it might mean optimizing
our diet around inclusion of specific

151
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,704
nutrients.

152
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:56,490
One of the most interesting and exciting
of which to me right now is a compound

153
00:09:56,491 --> 00:10:01,470
known as Sulforaphane, spelled
s, u, l, F, O, r, a, p, h, a, n,

154
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:06,180
e, but also other related compounds that
fall into the same class of compounds,

155
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:08,100
broadly known as isothiocyanates,

156
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:12,510
all of which including sulforaphane being
derived from cruciferous vegetables.

157
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,320
What's interesting about so for Fran
is at this compound richly found in

158
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:18,810
Broccoli sprouts at about
50 to a hundred times.

159
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:22,800
What's found in mature Broccoli is that
it activates a special genetic pathway

160
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:27,630
in our cells known as NRF two and it does
so more potently than any other known

161
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,080
naturally occurring dietary compound.
This gene,

162
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:35,520
a master regulator controls over 200
other genes affecting whether or not

163
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:36,990
they're activated and doing work.

164
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,580
These include genes that are affect
our own antiinflammatory processes,

165
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:42,990
antioxidant processes,

166
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,340
and even the ability to inactivate
potentially harmful compounds that we're

167
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:51,330
exposed to on a daily basis from breathing
in carcinogens like benzine from air

168
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:53,100
pollution.
In a sense,

169
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,630
we're talking about an on switch from
some of our most native stress responses.

170
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,930
Our ability to cope with physiological
stress down to the cellular level

171
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,780
ultimately affects how rapidly
we accumulate the damage,

172
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:07,260
which we often refer to as aging.
But, and here's the interesting thing.

173
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,450
The reason NRF two a stress response
pathway is activated by Sulforaphane is

174
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:17,040
because the compound itself functions
as what we know as a Xeno hormetic a

175
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:21,630
compound that by virtue of being actually
slightly stressful to cells elicits a

176
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:23,010
biological stress response,

177
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:27,240
it has a cumulative effect that is
otherwise a net gain in resilience that

178
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:29,430
creates a benefit to
the organism as a whole.

179
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,610
This is actually somewhat unintuitive
if you really think about that.

180
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,450
We sort of have this very natural notion
that because excess stress is bad,

181
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,980
we should venture to avoid stress at all
costs. It turns out though that in fact,

182
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:44,640
perhaps as a consequence of
having received stressful
compounds in our diets for

183
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:45,750
millions of years,

184
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,160
things that evolved in plants such as
insect Antifa dance that help ward off

185
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:53,010
insects, we sometimes function
better for having them.

186
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,340
They can even induce neuro
stress responses that boost
neurotrophic factors that

187
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,970
lead to the growth of new neurons and
promote the survival of existing neurons

188
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,210
which may function to help make
compounds likeso for her pain,

189
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,880
potentially a candidate
as a mild nootropic.

190
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,740
We'll probably come back
to this in a little bit,

191
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:12,550
but the bottom line is is that if we
take this same concept that stress can be

192
00:12:12,551 --> 00:12:17,380
beneficial known as hormesis and apply it
to other things like exercise, fasting,

193
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:18,670
heat, stress, cold stress,

194
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:22,750
some of the various benefits that
may be had from these many strategies

195
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:27,370
similarly come about as a consequence
of sometimes overlapping stress response

196
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,204
pathways.

197
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:33,040
This idea of hormesis and trying to
improve our capacity to be resilient to

198
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:37,030
environmental stress and even the stress
generated as a byproduct of normal

199
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:41,350
metabolism and immune function in
particular is a very useful framework for

200
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:45,160
evaluating the potential strategies that
might have promise in preventing even

201
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:46,900
aging. Okay. All of that said,

202
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:50,380
this is a great opportunity to jump from
these sort of big picture ideas back to

203
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:53,800
things of a more practical
application variety. Specifically.

204
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:57,070
The next question evaluates
a straightforward technique
that has caught my

205
00:12:57,071 --> 00:13:01,420
interest and also happens to be broadly
applicable to almost anyone. All right,

206
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:04,960
so Brandon Beckett asks,
Doctor Rhonda Patrick,

207
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,990
you interviewed Doctor
Valter, Longo, doctor Satchin,

208
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:11,770
panda and Dr. Ruth Patterson on
time restricted feeding and fasting.

209
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,120
Can you summarize your best practices
for time restricted eating and who it

210
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:19,330
might not be a good fit for?
Okay, this is a fun question,

211
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,840
but before we dive right into best
practices on time restricted eating,

212
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,500
it probably helps to know what it is.
For the rest of you that may be listening.

213
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,460
Time restricted eating as it's called
an humans or time restricted feeding as

214
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:34,660
it's referred to an animal research is
this idea that by constraining our eating

215
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:36,640
within a certain time
window during the day,

216
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:41,080
ranging from only eight hours up to 12
hours per day, usually earlier in the day,

217
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:43,120
to align better with our circadian rhythm,

218
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,330
we stand to benefit from a
variety of different angles.

219
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,040
On the more extreme end of eight hours,

220
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:51,040
you're engaging in a slightly more
extreme type of time restricted eating,

221
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,670
which is more well known in the
fitness world in particular as 16 eight

222
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,240
intermittent fasting simply maintaining
a slightly more conservative time window

223
00:13:58,241 --> 00:14:01,660
than you usually might has started to
show advantages as well potentially

224
00:14:01,661 --> 00:14:04,780
functioning as a lifestyle intervention
that may be able to protect people from

225
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:09,220
obesity, metabolic related disease and
more at the population level. For example,

226
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,420
even an 11 hour eating window has been
associated in one study with a reduced

227
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:18,070
risk of breast cancer and potentially
recurrence by as much as 36% in women.

228
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,940
We'll get back to what the research both
mouse and human says about the duration

229
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:24,310
of the time windows involved,
but first,

230
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:26,950
let's talk a little bit
about the circadian aspect.

231
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,890
When healthy adults eat meals that
are identical in terms of both their

232
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:33,250
macronutrient and calorie content
at breakfast, lunch, or dinner,

233
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,080
the postprandial glucose increase is a
lowest after breakfast and highest after

234
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:41,950
dinner, even though the meals
were a hundred percent identical.

235
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,210
This is just one example that suggests
metabolism changes throughout the day.

236
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,160
We also know that in humans,

237
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,710
metabolic genes are more active during
the day and less active at night.

238
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,010
The underlying reason for this is
because humans are diurnal creatures,

239
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:57,980
which means that we conduct most of
our activities during the day including

240
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:01,040
feeding, exercising, and working,
and then resting at night.

241
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,150
What makes humans diurnal creatures is
the presence of an internal clock in the

242
00:15:05,151 --> 00:15:09,350
brain referred to as the super
charismatic nucleus or Scn for short.

243
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,590
The part of this internal clock that
interacts with the external cue of light.

244
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:15,470
The SCN is also referred to
as the master Oscillator,

245
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,140
but light isn't the only
external cue we have.

246
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,070
We also have food influencing what are
known as peripheral oscillators that

247
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:25,880
occur in peripheral tissues such as
the liver and influence metabolism,

248
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,120
whereas light is the major
cue for circadian rhythm.

249
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:34,130
Timing of food intake regulates circadian
rhythm in peripheral tissues as well.

250
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,730
This facts sort of helps to explain why
time restricted eating as it's defined

251
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:41,720
by doctor Pan does work and that of
others begins with the eating period with

252
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:46,721
the very first bite or drink of anything
non water because even compounds that

253
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:51,110
exist in black coffee such as caffeine
can be reasonably expected to produce

254
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:55,280
metabolic effects that influence these
peripheral oscillators including activity

255
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:56,060
in the liver.

256
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,660
Everything from making neurotransmitters
to insulin to glucose transport inside

257
00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:04,220
of cells to oxidizing fatty acids to
repairing damage is on a 24 hour cycle

258
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:07,910
clock that is influenced by these
external cues involving metabolism.

259
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,730
To sort of illustrate the
importance of circadian rhythm,

260
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,550
these clocks regulate thousands
and thousands of genes,

261
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:17,210
which is somewhere in the neighborhood
of around 10 to 15% of the expressed

262
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:18,044
human genome,

263
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:22,100
which means that our most basic metabolic
physiology is meant to be tuned to

264
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:25,160
behave differently depending
on the time of day that it is.

265
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,880
Even the bacteria that we harbor in
our guts have circadian rhythm with the

266
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:31,580
species of bacteria changing
according to the time of day.

267
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,910
Some bacteria dominate during the
morning and others during the evening.

268
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,030
Unfortunately with the invention of
artificial lighting and the varying work

269
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:38,511
schedules,

270
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:41,720
it has extended peoples eating times
to occur much later in the evening,

271
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,150
and this can have very
negative consequences.

272
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,680
Eating late at night may
also reset peripheral clocks
and result in misalignment

273
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:50,990
of metabolism,
which means when you wake up,

274
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:53,600
your metabolism is already
at the end of its cycle.

275
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,880
So that's the logic behind
the circadian aspect,

276
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,850
which gets left out of some
of the intermittent fast
and philosophies that are

277
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:03,110
popular and explains why time restricted
eating emphasizes an earlier eating

278
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:07,010
window and includes [inaudible]
xenobiotics as breaking the fast.

279
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,610
Something I've learned as a specific
point if it contention for people. Okay,

280
00:17:10,611 --> 00:17:14,120
but shifting away from the xenobiotics
and circadian aspects to talk more about

281
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:15,260
the time window itself.

282
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,770
Animals that have been limited to a nine
to 12 hour feeding window in which they

283
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:22,250
can eat, but otherwise allowing them to
eat the same amount of calories that they

284
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:23,084
normally would.

285
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,510
They have shown that they can attain
some pretty amazing benefits including

286
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:30,710
decreased fat mass, increased lean
muscle mass, improved glucose tolerance,

287
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:33,530
improved lipid profile,
reduced inflammation,

288
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:37,640
higher mitochondrial volume protection
from mild age related fatty liver

289
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,170
protection from obesity,

290
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,370
generally favorable improvements in gene
expression and increased production of

291
00:17:43,371 --> 00:17:44,210
ketone bodies,

292
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,300
which is interesting for another reason
we'll get back to in a minute time.

293
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,040
Restricted eating also has a
growing body research in humans.

294
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,250
Recent studies suggest that
mentioned briefly earlier,

295
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,510
eating within an 11 hour window was
associated with a decreased breast cancer

296
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:01,950
risk and reduction in recurrence by
as much as 36% earlier meal timing

297
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:05,820
associates with improved effectiveness
of weight loss therapy in overweight and

298
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:09,480
obese people for each three
hour increase in nighttime,

299
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:14,481
fasting duration was linked with a
20% lower odds of elevated glycated

300
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:19,551
hemoglobin Hba one c which is a more
longterm marker for Blood Glucose levels

301
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:25,020
for each 10% increase in the proportion
of calories consumed after 5:00 PM there

302
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:28,980
was a 3% increase in the inflammatory
biomarkers. C reactor protein,

303
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,140
otherwise known as CRP
eating one additional meal
during the day instead of the

304
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,530
evening was associated with an
8% decrease in c reactor protein.

305
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,520
Eating within a 12 hour window improves
sleep and increased weight loss in

306
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,500
normal weight people.
As a rule of thumb,

307
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,010
anything that has the potential to
mitigate chronic systemic inflammation is

308
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:49,680
something I personally consider
worth trying to dial in.

309
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,250
Since depression of inflammation is
thought to be one of the most important

310
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:57,600
predictors of successful longevity that
increases importance with advancing age

311
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:01,500
and also influences the risk of cancer
and even potentially mental health.

312
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,400
So putting aside the potential to have
better blood glucose control or protect

313
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:09,180
myself from obesity without actually
changing the composition of my diet.

314
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,230
Reducing systemic inflammation has a lot
of appeal to me now that we're all on

315
00:19:13,231 --> 00:19:16,530
the same page in terms of what some of
the research shows on the benefits of

316
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:17,400
time restricted eating,

317
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,520
I would like to go back and address
Brandon's question about what my best

318
00:19:20,521 --> 00:19:22,920
practices are surrounded
time restricted eating,

319
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,010
how you choose to implement some of this
information is ultimately going to be

320
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:29,760
dictated by life circumstances
that include practical
realities surrounding work

321
00:19:29,761 --> 00:19:33,630
schedule and probably a million other
things. The flexibility of my schedule,

322
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:34,021
however,

323
00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:38,310
has made implementing time restricted
eating admittedly a bit easier unless I

324
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:41,220
have a social reason that forces
me to eat later in the day.

325
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,740
I usually start my clocks
as soon as I wake up.

326
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,880
Thus I don't concern myself a whole lot
about what counts as breaking the fast

327
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,320
and what doesn't and I go by the strictest
of definitions. If it's not water,

328
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,620
it breaks the fast unless it's just
brushing my teeth. I don't count that.

329
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:00,060
If I wake up at 8:00 AM and have my first
sip of coffee at eight 15 then I make

330
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:03,870
a note to myself or I set an alarm on
my phone to go off one and a half hours

331
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:04,920
before the clock ends,

332
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:09,180
which is usually around 6:15 PM since I
aim for around a 10 hour eating window

333
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,920
and a 14 hour nighttime fasting window
when I'm feeling especially motivated,

334
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,830
I eat within an eight or nine
hour time window and fast.

335
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:18,930
We're 15 or 16 hours during the night,

336
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:23,370
which means if I have my first sip of
coffee at 8:15 AM that I stopped eating by

337
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:28,050
either four 15 or 5:15 PM I follow
the same procedure on days I sleep in.

338
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,530
Even though animal research shows
that this pattern has benefits,

339
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,270
even if you cheat on the weekend.
Now,

340
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:36,690
the reason why I chose a 10 hour window
is because it's a sufficiently tight

341
00:20:36,691 --> 00:20:40,500
window of time to likely confer some of
the advantages of time restricted eating

342
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,600
without being unduly burdensome.

343
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,770
Personal compliance here being the issue
stretching for the nine hour or even an

344
00:20:46,771 --> 00:20:50,260
eight hour window. However, it can be also
be interesting and may appeal to some.

345
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,580
Some animal research has shown that a
certain aerobic endurance benefit for time

346
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:58,270
restricted feeding in this nine hour
range but not for shorter fasts,

347
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,530
and if you think about it,

348
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,730
mice that only feed for nine hour periods
and are fasting for the other 15 hours.

349
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:04,803
It makes sense.

350
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,770
It takes around 10 to 12 hours for
liver glycogen stores to be depleted,

351
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:12,160
which is then followed by fatty acids
being liberated from adipose tissue.

352
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,070
These fatty acids are then transported
to the liver where they are converted

353
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:17,200
into ketone bodies like
Beta hydroxybutyrate,

354
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,100
which are then transported
to a wide variety of other
tissues such as the muscle

355
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:21,940
and used for energy.

356
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,020
So it sort of makes sense that eating
within a nine hour window and fasting for

357
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:28,870
15 hours overnight may lead
to endurance enhancements.

358
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,290
If we've managed to kick off a little
more ketone production the evening before

359
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:32,860
a run.

360
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,460
Anecdotally I've observed that personally
I feel an improvement in endurance

361
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,850
ranging from slight to pretty significant
in my morning runs when I've tried a

362
00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:43,330
little bit harder to eat strictly within
an eight or nine hour time window.

363
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,010
Just as a closing thought,

364
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:48,730
I think there's still a lot of room for
more emerging research in this area to

365
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:50,170
teach us things that may be important.

366
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:54,550
Questions like what influence later
day endurance or weight training has on

367
00:21:54,551 --> 00:21:58,780
mitigating the deleterious effects of
other suboptimal parameters like a later

368
00:21:58,781 --> 00:21:59,890
in the day eating window.

369
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:05,200
How large the effect of xenobiotics like
caffeine and black coffee is compared

370
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:09,130
to potentially more important factor like
just keeping an otherwise tighter time

371
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:12,610
window with a slightly looser
definition of what is considered eating.

372
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,640
If you'd like to see interesting questions
answered about time restricted eating,

373
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:19,450
you can actually participate in a mobile
APP powered distributed clinical trial

374
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,960
by heading over to doctor
Satchin Panda's lab website,

375
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:27,961
which can be found@mycircadianclock.org
available for iPhone and android.

376
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,410
Basically you commit to a baseline
and then one of the patterns of time

377
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:36,130
restricted eating and then proceed to
submit timestamp pictures of your food

378
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:38,350
over the course of 12 weeks.
Of course,

379
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:41,530
I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention
that a mutual friend and someone that has

380
00:22:41,531 --> 00:22:43,180
repeatedly been on the Tim Ferriss show,

381
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:47,140
Kevin Rose has developed a cool mobile
app to help keep track of intermittent

382
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:49,210
fasting in time restricted eating windows.

383
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,700
You can also check that out
if you're an iPhone user,

384
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,360
it's in the APP store under the name
zero as in the number of calories you

385
00:22:55,361 --> 00:22:58,240
consume while fasting.
To sort of finish off this question,

386
00:22:58,241 --> 00:23:01,000
as for who time restricted
feeding may not be a good fit for,

387
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:05,470
I'm not sure as an intervention, I
believe it is actually broadly applicable.

388
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:06,250
However,

389
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,030
I'm 100% certain that there is someone
somewhere for which a unique medical

390
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:13,090
condition may make time
restricted eating inappropriate,

391
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,780
especially if you expand the definition
of time restricted eating to me long

392
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,110
multiday fast, which should the
subject of Doctor Valter Longo,

393
00:23:20,111 --> 00:23:23,140
his research in particular.
Definitely checking in with the physician,

394
00:23:23,141 --> 00:23:26,710
particularly if you're going to do a
prolonged fast or if you're thinking of

395
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:29,920
trying time restricted eating but may
have a medical condition that for some

396
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:33,340
reason might somehow make it
unsafe. Okay. Next question.

397
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:38,020
Jassi seeing asks for all those that
don't understand the benefits of fasting,

398
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,010
how does doing a fast differ
from say eating a diet low carb,

399
00:23:42,011 --> 00:23:46,700
high fat that puts you into Ketosis
and what key metrics, for example,

400
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:50,000
blood tests should someone look
at to know it is benefiting you?

401
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,240
Very interesting question because
as implied by the question,

402
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,210
there are at least a few
similarities between a low carb,

403
00:23:56,211 --> 00:24:00,410
high fat diet and fasting, but there
are also obviously some key differences.

404
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,550
Probably the main similarity between
the two is that metabolism shifts from

405
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:08,990
using glucose as the major source of
energy to primarily oxidation of fatty

406
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:12,380
acids and ketone bodies as energy.
When it comes to fasting,

407
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:15,560
there are a few things that really
differentiate it from a low carb high fat

408
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:19,550
diet. One of the major benefits of
fasting, particularly prolonged fasting,

409
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:23,630
which is around four to five
days in humans that is not
found on a low carb high

410
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:28,580
fat diet is a dramatic increase in
autophagy and a pop ptosis followed by a

411
00:24:28,581 --> 00:24:30,920
massive boost in stem cell production.

412
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,130
I toffee g is a genetic
program that is very important.

413
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,810
It clears away damaged cells to use for
energy while a pop ptosis is a genetic

414
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,450
program that causes damaged
cells to self destruct.

415
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:45,470
Both of these processes prevent damaged
cells from becoming cancer cells.

416
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,060
When we clear away damaged cells,

417
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:49,820
this also means those cells are
less likely to become senescent,

418
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,820
which is what can happen when
too much damage accumulates.

419
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,430
A senescent cell is
technically a living cell,

420
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:58,640
but it is not functioning in a way
that is consistent with maintaining the

421
00:24:58,641 --> 00:25:01,670
overall health of an organ.
In fact, quite the opposite.

422
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,870
Senescent cells can accelerate the
aging of nearby cells and promote tumor

423
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,590
growth by secreting proinflammatory.
