1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,500
I guys, Tim Ferriss here, I am
asked a lot about evening routines,

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,620
so I'm going to show you what my
current routine looks like pre bed.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,060
So let's say that I'm about 60 minutes
out. I want to go to bed 60 minutes.

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,950
I am going to make myself some tea.
There's decaffeinated these days.

5
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:20,790
It is Douglas first spring
tip by Juniper Ridge.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,550
The stuff right here.
It is fantastic.

7
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:27,900
I first bought it at the San Francisco
very building farmer's market,

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,490
which is on Thursdays and Saturdays.
This stuff has become a real favorite.

9
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,350
Now into that t once I've
steeped it and taken out the bag,

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,980
I will put in apple cider vinegar,

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,640
one or two tablespoons
and then I will also put,

12
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:47,520
this is assuming I'm having trouble
sleeping and need to get to sleep and a

13
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:50,610
tablespoon of unfiltered honey.
All right,

14
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,970
this is a tip borrowed from my late friend
Seth Roberts and amazing guy and I am

15
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:02,430
not a hundred percent sure on the
biochemistry behind why this works,

16
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:04,470
but it knocks you out like that.

17
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,100
Many of my friends who are chronic
insomniacs have credited this with better

18
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,980
sleep than even prescription medications.
So I'm not a doctor,

19
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:14,200
don't play one on the Internet, so stay
on your meds, talk to your doctors, blah,

20
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:18,630
blah, blah. But this combination of
apple cider vinegar plus the honey,

21
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:22,710
which I would just add to this tea, is
literally a knockout. It's incredible.

22
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,130
Now at that point I will turn on my
downstairs soaking tub and we're going to

23
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:29,610
get some footage of that in a second.

24
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,410
That takes about 15 minutes to fill and
I'll sit down and I'll read fiction,

25
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,550
right?

26
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,640
I'm not going to read something like a
nonfiction business book that's going to

27
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:42,720
keep my problem solving apparatus
in sixth gear. That's not helpful.

28
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:44,820
I need to turn that off.
So I'll read fiction.

29
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,590
This is a book that I just finished,

30
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,130
which was recommended to me by a
billionaire investor named Chris Sacca,

31
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:54,870
who's also a friend and has been on the
podcast on the Tim Ferriss show and it

32
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:58,860
is called how to get filthy rich
in rising Asia by, I'm guessing,

33
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:03,060
pronounced Mohsin Hamid. This
is a fantastic book. I mean,

34
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:07,490
it is just incredible. Uh,
pros, so pure and purposeful.

35
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:09,180
It passes straight through
into the bloodstream.

36
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,130
It intoxicates the New
York Times book review,

37
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,260
a globalized version of the great Gatsby.
His book is nearly that good. NPR,

38
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,460
it's fantastic and very hilarious.
So I just finished this fiction.

39
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,700
Then that point,
I'll set an alarm.

40
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:26,130
Let's say it's 13 minutes in,

41
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,640
I will fill up this thermos effectively
with water and a ton of ice.

42
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,570
Now this hydroflask 40 ounce hydroflask
is also something I traveled with.

43
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:40,344
Why?

44
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,620
This is actually kind of cool
because it doubles as a foam roller,

45
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:47,851
but it's not fun.

46
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:52,851
So I will use this to actually roll out
my hip flexors and whatnot when I'm on

47
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:56,040
the road and it saves me,
they filled with packing both.

48
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,940
So I can just clip this onto my carry
on with the carabiner and off I go. No,

49
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,760
I have this,
which is going to be a core,

50
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,370
literally core component
of thermoregulation. And
then I had downstairs,

51
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,390
it says we're going next.

52
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,270
So here we are downstairs,
got the Houdini, you have
all sorts of other artwork.

53
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,410
This room used to be just like a
dirty futon room with a playstation.

54
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,540
The previous owners didn't
know what to do with it.

55
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,780
So I stripped out everything and I built
something that I've wanted since I was

56
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:28,990
15 and lived in Japan and had a nightly,
oh Hoodo.

57
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,500
So this is what it looks like.
And uh,

58
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,860
try not to completely kill

59
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,010
lighting here,
but if you come in

60
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,890
you can see that this has
been made into my spa room,

61
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,640
effectively complete with the shelves,
with towels and everything.

62
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,000
So this is a soaking tub.
And

63
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,310
each night I would get in here,
I have my ice water.

64
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,180
This will sit at this point right here.

65
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,430
I have a thermometer. If I really
want to check water temperature,

66
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:11,340
because I know sometimes alternate this
with ice baths in the other room. And uh,

67
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,870
then you have steps that
give you a different depths.

68
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,530
So I can go from about here
to here to here. All right,

69
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,730
now there are no jets.
This is not a Jacuzzi.

70
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,290
This is a soaking tub.
And to that end, I have

71
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,590
a bunch of stuff in here and these
are different types of Epsom salts and

72
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:36,520
medicinal salts that are in
dog food rolling containers.

73
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,930
So this is Epsom salts are magnesium
sulfate that I buy bulk and I will just

74
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:48,490
take two gigantic glasses worth or jars,

75
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:51,340
mirth of this and put it into the tub.
I also have

76
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:57,870
a number of different oils and so
on that depending on my training,

77
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,350
I can use a,
and if we come around the corner here,

78
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,530
you can see that we have

79
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:13,030
cozy little sauna.
So this is a dry sauna for two people.

80
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,320
It's a tight fit.

81
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:16,810
You could get someone on the floor
also if they're a little overheated.

82
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:22,170
And I will play with this for not only
just regular Banya should sing purposes,

83
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,730
but also for increasing endurance.
Uh, and if you're interested in that,

84
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:30,480
you can look up Rhonda
Patrick, rh, O, n, d,

85
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:34,720
a Rhonda Patrick Phd and a Sauna.

86
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,040
And Ferris,

87
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,520
there's an entire 10 page post on how to
use heat exposure for a growth hormone

88
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,050
increases and improved endurance.

89
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,550
And that is in effect my evening routine.

90
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,060
So it starts upstairs and down here.

91
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:56,290
I will consume the ice water every
two or three cycles into that bath.

92
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:01,770
I'll usually listen to an audio book
of some type or presentations that are

93
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:07,871
motivational in some capacity and then
shower and off to bed and having already

94
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:13,460
had the cocktail with the apple
cider vinegar and the honey.

95
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,383
I'm out like a light.

96
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,570
I am a lifelong insomniac and I no longer
have it sent me in part due to having

97
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:24,290
a consistent nightly ritual.
