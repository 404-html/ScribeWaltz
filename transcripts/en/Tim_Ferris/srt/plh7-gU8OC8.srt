1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,850
Optimal, minimal. At this altitude,

2
00:00:02,851 --> 00:00:06,210
I can run flat out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,360
I'm a cybernetic organism.

4
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,330
I get asked all the time, if you could
only use one supplement, what would it be?

5
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,240
And my answer is
inevitably Athletic Greens,

6
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:32,730
it is your all in one
nutritional insurance.

7
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:34,470
I recommended it in the four hour body,

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,490
did not get paid for that and I
travel with it to avoid getting sick.

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,520
I take it in the mornings to
ensure optimal performance.

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,990
It just covers all my basis.

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,010
If I can't get what I need through whole
food meals throughout the rest of the

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,020
day. If you want to give
athletic Greens to try,

This episode is brought
to you by freshbooks.

way to deal with their numbers and

ultimately this helps you to
focus on what you are best at.

25

It is used by many of the fastest growing
startups I've invested in or advise

26
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:39,150
and it's equally used by many of the best
freelancers I work with on a daily or

27
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:43,530
weekly basis. It is one of the easiest
ways to send invoices, get paid,

28
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:47,430
track your time and track your clients
if you're self employed and managing

29
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:50,250
business sometimes means
wrestling with spreadsheets,

30
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:54,150
crumbled receipts and other scattered
pieces. Freshbooks can really help.

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,590

34
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:05,280

other things. Tracking your time,

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,350
late payment reminders so you don't have
to chase people. Automatic expenses,

40
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:26,310
sharing files and messages with your
client's award winning customer service.

41
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,190

This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to
another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

53
00:03:10,021 --> 00:03:12,870
Or is my job to deconstruct
world class performers,

54
00:03:12,871 --> 00:03:16,740
people who are the best at what they
do to tease out the habits, routines,

55
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:18,270
life lessons,
favorite books,

56
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:23,250
favorite cooking pans and so on that
you can use in that last little bit with

57
00:03:23,251 --> 00:03:25,380
some heavy foreshadowing for this episode.

58
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,440
My guest today is Samine knows rot.

59
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,550
You can find her at Chow Samine,

60
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,440
C I a o at Chelsea and
on Instagram and Twitter.

61
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:39,441
Facebook forward slash just I mean dot
knows route and the website is salt fat

62
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,560
acid,

63
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,150
heat.com which we'll be getting
into and Simien is amazing.

64
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:49,860
She is a writer, a chef and a teacher
in my mind, first and foremost,

65
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,960
absolutely masterful teacher and excellent
at turning complexity into simplicity.

66
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,110
Her in New York Times
bestselling at first book, salt,

67
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,820
fat acid heat or if the James Beard
award that's like at the Oscar's best

68
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:07,821
picture for best general cookbook and
was named cookbook of the year by the

69
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,443
International Association
of Culinary professionals.

70
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,570
But this episode is about so
much more than just cooking.

71
00:04:12,571 --> 00:04:16,500
It is about the creative process. It
is about creative, highest creative,

72
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:21,450
low is pushing through rejection, you
name it, it's very, very vulnerable.

73
00:04:21,451 --> 00:04:24,240
If you liked the Brandon Stanton episode,

74
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:28,050
you are going to love this episode
and it covers some heavy stuff,

75
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:30,940
some really important stuff.
But back to the bio a,

76
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,700
Simeon has been called quote the next
Julia Child and quote by Nprs all things

77
00:04:35,701 --> 00:04:40,701
considered and she has been cooking
professionally since 2000 when she first

78
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:44,280
stumbled into the kitchen at blank,
blank blank.

79
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:48,000
We're going to cover what that blank
blank blank is like Hanukkah restaurant

80
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:52,170
that no doubt you've heard of and a what?
An amazing genesis story.

81
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:56,250
It is an eat columnist for the New York
Times magazine, so I mean lives, cooks,

82
00:04:56,251 --> 00:04:58,410
reads and gardens in Berkeley,
California.

83
00:04:58,411 --> 00:05:02,550
Her latest project is absolutely gorgeous.

84
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,470
It is a Netflix original documentary
series that may sound familiar.

85
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,270
Salt,
fat acid heat,

86
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,100
same title as the book produced by
a jigsaw productions. And I heavily,

87
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:18,810
heavily recommend that you check it
out. It is absolutely gorgeous. Salt,

88
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,820
fat, acid, heat on Netflix. So without
further ado, please enjoy this.

89
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:26,970
Very wide ranging and very vulnerable.
And to my mind,

90
00:05:26,971 --> 00:05:30,180
very important conversation
with Simien no syrup.

91
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,480
Simon, welcome to the show.
Thanks for having me, Tim and I,

92
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,060
I know that people are gonna say,
wait a second,

93
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,750
he just mispronounced her name and I want
them to know that I double and triple

94
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:45,130
check that with you beforehand.

95
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,360
A lot of people say some mean because
that would be English friendly,

96
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,820
but the correct pronunciation of
your full name is what I mean. Yeah.

97
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,460
You have like a graduated
past the American

98
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,480
pronunciation into, you're going for
two Persian right now. So it's good.

99
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,030
I will get there,
I will get there

100
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,770
and I struggled with deciding
where to begin topically,

101
00:06:14,071 --> 00:06:14,970
this conversation.

102
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:19,710
But one thing really jumped out at me
and I wanted to begin there since I like

103
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:24,570
to follow my interest and that
is the manifestation journal.

104
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,380
Can you tell me about your
manifestation journal?

105
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,460
I'm so happy you're asking. Um, um,

106
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,540
so I don't know where the idea for
my manifestation journal came from.

107
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:42,370
I think it may have been like a self
help blog in approximately 2008, but,

108
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,710
um, it's just a notebook that I
bought him, like art supply store,

109
00:06:46,711 --> 00:06:47,710
it's just a sketch book.

110
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,740
And I just decided to start writing
down the things that I envisioned for my

111
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:58,300
life and whether they were really big
and I would ever be like too embarrassed

112
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,650
to articulate them to anyone or
whether they were really little.

113
00:07:02,651 --> 00:07:07,480
And I tried, I sort of knew initially
that I should be as specific as possible.

114
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,380
And what's pretty bananas is
sometimes I'll misplace the journal,

115
00:07:11,381 --> 00:07:14,140
like it'll slide under my bed and I'll
forget about it for, I don't know,

116
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:16,870
six months or something.
And then I'll pull it out.

117
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:21,400
I think at one point I lost it for about
two years and I'll pull it out and I'll

118
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:24,310
look and I'll be like, oh
my gosh, like word for word.

119
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,270
So many of these things have
happened, you know, and I think, um,

120
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,920
and there were also many things in there
that have not come true yet or like

121
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,160
maybe I was misguided and I changed and,
and goals shifted.

122
00:07:36,161 --> 00:07:41,161
But it is really sort of mind blowing to
go back and look at how specific goals

123
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,640
sort of come to life.
When you plant a seed,

124
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,780
you know the or you achieve things when
you plant a seed and you're really clear

125
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:54,130
about it. And I've always known that
and I've always really adhere to that.

126
00:07:54,131 --> 00:07:57,190
And so it's just one little
practice that I have at this point.

127
00:07:57,191 --> 00:08:00,220
I like to look at it around my
birthday and around the new year.

128
00:08:00,221 --> 00:08:03,460
Those are sort of the two times of year
that I have pretty diligently we'll

129
00:08:03,461 --> 00:08:05,930
check in and right into
it. But it's not, you know,

130
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:10,090
it's not a big thing that I do all
the time, but it is really incredible,

131
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:13,210
especially as I've started to sort
of achieve bigger goals in my career.

132
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:14,950
To go back and look at it and say,
wow,

133
00:08:14,951 --> 00:08:19,390
like I wanted always to write for
this publication and now I am,

134
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:22,960
or I really specifically wanted,
you know,

135
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:27,130
a book deal with a certain amount of
money and I achieved it. And you know,

136
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,703
and it's,
yeah.

137
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,450
Well I've, I've so many followup
questions because I'm a nerd.

138
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:37,800
When it comes to journaling and notebooks
and it's something that the comes up a

139
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:42,690
fair amount in this podcast from profile
in the California Sunday magazine.

140
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,680
Uh, this was discussed in
a few lines and when the,

141
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,870
the interviewer in this case flipped
through the notebook, which uh,

142
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:55,590
I'm jealous of immediately, Eh, it,

143
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,100
it

144
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,240
give a few examples.

145
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,130
Next in quote next to small candid
instructions to herself. Example,

146
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:03,180
Chin hairs under control,

147
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:07,110
exclamation point in general life notions
in parentheses, Bay Leaf Pin, Yada,

148
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:09,270
exclamation point.
I'm not sure what that is but that's okay.

149
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:12,270
We'll come back to it. There were goals
that I found striking in their precision.

150
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:14,700
Go to Italy, write and publish
at least one story in print,

151
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:19,350
start writing her first book. Those
were dated 2008 and all have come true.

152
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,020
So my question is when you were,
do you still use the journal?

153
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,890
If, so, generally speaking,
say from 2008 forward,

154
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:33,891
how frequently do you write in the journal
and then what does the review process

155
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,763
look like?

156
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,980
Um,
I do still use it.

157
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,370
I probably write in it
two or three times a year.

158
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,870
And I also probably look at
it two or three times a year.

159
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,490
Um, and it's a treat to look at it now
it's become this amazing treat where,

160
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,960
where I get to,
um,

161
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,270
go back and see did something happen,
you know,

162
00:09:57,271 --> 00:10:02,271
did I achieve something or
did some thought or notion
that I had had at sometime

163
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,480
come true. Um, and it really is,

164
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:10,440
and often it's a nice thing to sort
of help me refocus where I'm headed.

165
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,090
I feel like with my career.
Um,

166
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:19,160
in a lot of ways it's how to really, uh,
what's the word I was going to say? Like,

167
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,910
Oh,
a more fifth shape.

168
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,940
There has not been one super clear goal
or one super clear path that I can model

169
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:31,290
my career on. There aren't a lot of
other writers, chef, teacher, you know,

170
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:35,100
often people are just write about
food or just cook or just teach.

171
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,020
And so I have done all those things and
more and I've always just followed my

172
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:44,240
gut. And that can be really
overwhelming because, um,

173
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:49,140
I get really distracted quite
easily by shiny objects, you know,

174
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:53,280
or like a lot of money or the opportunity
to work with somebody or make a

175
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:57,900
decision because of I'm worried what
will happen if I say no. And um,

176
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,590
so I feel like the clearer I
am about what I do want to do,

177
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,590
the more easily I can say no or,

178
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,290
or just make a better decisions
about where I'm headed.

179
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:12,291
So even just a couple times a year having
like a little bit of quiet time and it

180
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:16,740
usually I'll pick up the thing a couple
of days before my birthday and start

181
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:21,120
thinking about like what I've done in
the past year where, what, uh, where,

182
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:25,800
you know, good choices, I've made
bad choices I've made. And um,

183
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,780
yeah, I, and it sort of as a nice sort
of personal check in, I don't know,

184
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:32,460
there's a million names for these things.

185
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:36,210
I don't know why I wrote manifestation
journal, but it really is that like,

186
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:40,190
you know, it's also just like
a journal. I don't, yeah.

187
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,260
And when you look at,
when you look at a page,

188
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:47,290
is it date and then under that just a
series of bullets for things that you hope

189
00:11:47,901 --> 00:11:48,734
to achieve?

190
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:49,970
Yeah,

191
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:54,490
I mean if I were a little more organized
and there would probably be like some

192
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:58,000
sort of method of the
math, but it's, you know,

193
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:03,001
it started out as bullets and the
other day I was telling somebody,

194
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,890
I was reading some of the ones from the
very first page for someone and then I

195
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:12,300
always saying how, oh, there's
all these things like I dunno, um,

196
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,340
published four books,
you know,

197
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,190
popular well-reviewed books that I'm proud
of by goodwill, non publishing houses.

198
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:23,020
And then in at the very bottom in
tiny, tiny writing, like so small,

199
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:24,400
I could barely admit it to myself.

200
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,860
And I certainly can't believe
I'm about to tell you,

201
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,240
but I wrote in the tiniest writing,

202
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,960
MacArthur genius grant. Like, like,

203
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,450
it's so embarrassing. Do
you know what I mean? Like,

204
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:41,290
so like I can't believe it's just so
embarrassing. And then, yeah, I wrote,

205
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,090
I had a page for long term goals.

206
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:46,480
I had a page for what I
hoped to do that year ideas.

207
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,730
There's the bailiff Kenyatta, which
was I wanted to make a penny, Yada.

208
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,140
That was covered instead of
with crepe paper with Bailey of,

209
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:57,160
so when you hit it with a baseball bat,
it smells really good and we did it.

210
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:59,080
We did it on my 30th birthday.

211
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,600
If you're looking at this journal
to picking it up three times a year,

212
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:06,890
let's say two or three times a year,

213
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,990
is the significance that you are
planting a seed in your subconscious more

214
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:17,450
smooth because it sounds like you're not
going back and sort of reviewing it and

215
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:19,030
some type of spreadsheet fashion.

216
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,690
Looking at the progress towards the
end goal in each of these cases,

217
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,470
you're visiting it two or
three times a year. Is,

218
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,520
is the importance then that you're
planting a seed in your subconscious that

219
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:38,420
will somehow very subtly
direct your choices in a
different fashion? I know that,

220
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,720
that, uh, a number of people who've been
on this podcast, my friend Josh Waitzkin,

221
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:44,480
who is the basis for searching
for Bobby Fischer, Reid Hoffman,

222
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,970
do quite a bit of a intention setting
or journaling either right before bed or

223
00:13:49,971 --> 00:13:53,630
first thing upon waking up,
which has that flavor to it.

224
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:58,520
But why do you think this has had an
impact in your life if it has had an

225
00:13:58,521 --> 00:13:59,354
impact?

226
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,120
I definitely think this lines up with
idea of planting a seed in my subconscious

227
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,990
and also helping me like
remain accountable to myself.

228
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:13,420
And then I also have all manner of
other intention setting and goal making

229
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:18,010
unless making just at my office, above
my desk, I have lists of, you know,

230
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:20,150
actually it's funny,
I had a list of um,

231
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,590
interviews I would like to do
and yours was on the list, right?

232
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,950
And so I looked at that list, they
looked at that list, you know,

233
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:29,350
every day I went to work
and sat at my computer.

234
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:33,340
There's a list right next to that of
maybe projects I would like to do. Right.

235
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,760
And then right next to that is a list
of collaborators I would like to have,

236
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,430
you know,
and there's people on there like wildly,

237
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,670
I sort of just stopped being embarrassed
at some point about having sort of what

238
00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:49,330
seemed wildly unachievable dreams or,
or you know,

239
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:52,310
I put Esra and Ava Duvernay on that list.
Do I know them?

240
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:55,490
Is there any possibility that, you
know, I don't know, like what do I know?

241
00:14:55,491 --> 00:14:57,980
I just put them on there because there
are people I would like to maybe work

242
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:02,840
with whose work I respect.
And so, um, there is,

243
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:07,400
I just had to stop being afraid that
someone would come into my office and see

244
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:11,750
that and judge me, you know,
like, and so for a while,

245
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,650
when I first started writing the book,
I wrote visualize Oprah's book club.

246
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:18,500
And I had that on a post it
note above my desk for years.

247
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,600
And then Oprah's book club ended. But, um,

248
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:26,150
and also I don't think she puts cookbooks
on, but you know, I've never dare,

249
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:29,300
I wouldn't say I've ever been
embarrassed to, to dream big.

250
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,080
And I think the better I have gotten at,

251
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,200
at articulating my dreams and words and
then I'm really just being mindful of

252
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:43,580
them and whether it means coming back to
them once or twice a year or looking at

253
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:44,181
them every day,

254
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:47,240
I do feel like it makes a difference
and it helps me stay on track.

255
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,240
And then if I look at that list and after
a while some goal or some name or some

256
00:15:53,031 --> 00:15:56,930
idea, it doesn't feel right anymore,
I can cross it off, you know?

257
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:01,070
I don't know. It's just
um, it's a nice thing,

258
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:04,040
especially when I'm in the,
you know,

259
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:08,570
in those sort of rock bottom
part of the creative process.

260
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:12,440
Like where you're just sort of
doing the draft, the boring stuff.

261
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:13,760
You're doing the accounting,

262
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:17,000
you're doing the like terrible
writing that's not coming out easily.

263
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,460
It's just nice to look up and be like,
Oh yes,

264
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:24,350
I am a creative person who
has big ideas and you know,

265
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:27,860
sometimes makes things happen.
So I don't know. It's not,

266
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,680
it's like a little bit of
cheerleading for myself, I guess.

267
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,290
This is really important.

268
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,760
So I want to explore it for a moment.

269
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:41,690
This and this is going to
be very non chronological.

270
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:45,350
We're going to bounce all over the place.
I do have questions about San Diego,

271
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:49,010
but we're going to come to that first
since you said the rock bottom of the

272
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:49,910
creative process,

273
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,960
so when you are in the rock bottom of
the creative process and almost anyone

274
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,690
except for a few mutans here or there
who just seem to always operate in the

275
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:03,261
proper gear,

276
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:08,261
but for most people with any large
or unfamiliar creative project,

277
00:17:08,511 --> 00:17:11,360
there's going to be maybe one rock bottom,

278
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:14,120
maybe many different rock
bottom difficult moments.

279
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,160
Do you use anything we're talking
about in some ways future tense,

280
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:22,850
the things you want to do when you
were in that rock bottom place,

281
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,910
do you use anything from the past,

282
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:30,940
things you've achieved or milestones
you've accomplished or anything from the

283
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:36,911
present tense to also help buoy your
spirits or is it mostly the keeping your

284
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:42,500
eye on the ball that is ahead of you,
that future tense that helps you?

285
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,740
I think I wish that,

286
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,250
I think I need some more therapy and
meditation to get to be the kind of person

287
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:55,610
who can feel good about my
past accomplishments and
let them bully me to um,

288
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,990
to buoy me forward.

289
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,050
I think I sort of achieved the
thing and then I forget about it.

290
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:04,710
Like it's even part hard for
me when I receive praise,

291
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,460
I get so many emails all the time,
which are so meaningful in a way.

292
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,390
These are maybe the most meaningful kind
of feedback that I get is from people

293
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:12,931
who are like,

294
00:18:12,931 --> 00:18:17,490
I read your book and Now I Cook
Vegetables for my kids and they eat them,

295
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,000
you know, and it tastes good.
And that kind of stuff is really,

296
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,210
I think the most powerful for me. But
still there's a way where I'm like, oh,

297
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:25,460
somebody else did that I had.

298
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:30,590
And it's really hard for me to accept
praise or really fully feel in my body

299
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,790
pride and happiness at
having achieved these goals.

300
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:39,130
I have listed on papers
all over the place. So I,

301
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:43,740
I do a lot of work in therapy and
meditation and just like, you know,

302
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:48,270
trying to be better about my body and
connecting with my body and feeling that

303
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:50,910
stuff. So here, up until now,

304
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:56,510
I have not historically used those things
to get me through the creative lows.

305
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:58,650
I often,
um,

306
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,450
once I do have to sort of
keep my eye on the prize,

307
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,800
I think in therapy and
in just my own life,

308
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,860
I have had to do a lot of
work in reframing what success
means and what it looks

309
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:18,180
like. So that as I work
toward quote unquote success,

310
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,433
um,

311
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,240
I'm working towards something that will
be positive for me rather than then also

312
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:28,770
beat me down. Like I'm a crazy
perfectionist child of immigrants who,

313
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,760
you know, like was raised in a family
where nothing was ever good enough.

314
00:19:32,761 --> 00:19:35,220
Nothing I did was ever like
perfect, you know, it was just, I,

315
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:40,221
I'm perfectionist from childhood and
then I entered a profession and in

316
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:45,120
particular like began working at an
institution which is run by like a

317
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,920
worldclass perfectionist. And so, and so,

318
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,970
nothing that any of us
ever did was good enough,

319
00:19:50,971 --> 00:19:54,300
which is good because it keeps us
pushing all toward doing better.

320
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:59,280
But I haven't historically had a lot
of like positive feedback and really

321
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,650
allowed myself to feel that.

322
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:06,480
So I'm doing a lot of my own work to
sort of be proud at the things that I do,

323
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:10,260
whether they're perfect quote unquote
or just good enough or whatever.

324
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,420
And um,
you know,

325
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:16,100
I had a lot of fear before my
book was released that, uh,

326
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,020
because it was the biggest
project that I had ever worked on.

327
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:23,880
It was a la the longest dream
that I had ever worked toward. Uh,

328
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,900
I had put everything I had into it and
because it took me so long to do a lot of

329
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:29,650
people,

330
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:34,650
at least I felt the pressure of a lot
of people looking at me and at this book

331
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:38,610
and people were waiting for it and I knew
they were ready to respond in whatever

332
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:43,340
way. Right. I didn't know what
way. And I have always, you know,

333
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,920
like worked for external
praise and I'm aware of.

334
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,630
And so I went to therapy and
I told my therapist, I said,

335
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:54,990
I'm really worried that when this book
comes out that I am going to sort of sink

336
00:20:55,181 --> 00:21:00,160
or swim on the world's reception
of it and I don't want to do that.

337
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:04,000
So how do I get out of that?
How do I exist in a way where,

338
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,680
um,
whatever the reception is of this thing,

339
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:13,600
I will still be okay and not like break
into 1 million pieces. And so he said,

340
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:17,260
well, we have to create a definition
of success that's on your terms.

341
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,660
So it took me a lot of
months and a lot of thinking.

342
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:21,730
And eventually I came back to
him and I said, you know what,

343
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:26,770
I'll feel totally successful with this
if I know that I've done everything I

344
00:21:26,771 --> 00:21:30,220
could possibly do to make it
as good as I possibly can.

345
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,850
And that means never,
you know,

346
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,960
being lazy and not doing another revision
or never not doing the research or

347
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:42,010
never not hiring the fact checker or
never not testing the recipe again or

348
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:46,540
whatever. And that once I know I've given
everything and like turned every stone,

349
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:51,220
then I will be able to
respond to any criticism.

350
00:21:51,221 --> 00:21:55,210
I'll be able to accept any praise because
I'll know that I did anything right.

351
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,253
To me,
a big,

352
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,340
big thing about responding to criticism
is if there's a reason I made a choice

353
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:04,430
and I can speak to that articulately,
then um,

354
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,540
I'm happy to accept criticism because
sometimes it's just a difference of

355
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:08,200
opinion.

356
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,940
But if I felt pressured to do something
or I know that I didn't do my best or

357
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:13,450
whatever,

358
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,630
then a lot of times that criticism
like really sort of gets me in the gut.

359
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,620
And um,
and so I really did that work.

360
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:25,650
And I also sort of committed to not
reading reviews and you sort of,

361
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,700
you know,
and not reading comments and stuff.

362
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:30,250
And so I've sort of shielded
myself from a lot of stuff,

363
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:35,550
but I have felt to generally really
safe and strong since the book came out.

364
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,970
And it's nice that there is all
of the sort of praise or whatever,

365
00:22:39,971 --> 00:22:43,570
but I also just feel, um, yeah,

366
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:47,230
I feel good about what I've done and I
know the ways I could've done it better.

367
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:51,310
There's always an I get to go do more
work in the world and try and do that

368
00:22:51,311 --> 00:22:53,140
better, you know? And it's okay.

369
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,360
How did your therapist help you or how
did you put systems in place so that that

370
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:03,290
definition of success would be
at the forefront of your mind?

371
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,410
I don't know,
of course,

372
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:08,990
because I don't have a telepathy,

373
00:23:08,991 --> 00:23:13,910
but I suspect there had to be some
point where you saw maybe it wasn't a

374
00:23:13,911 --> 00:23:14,750
negative review,

375
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:19,700
but maybe just a lukewarm response or
perhaps just some idiot on the Internet

376
00:23:19,701 --> 00:23:22,100
with a loud voice yelling
something or other.

377
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:27,550
And for at least a moment you were
back in your old mindset of looking for

378
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:35,690
external validation and in this case not
finding it. I it, did that happen at all?

379
00:23:35,691 --> 00:23:37,750
If so happens all the time.
So yes.

380
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,730
How do you take that?

381
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:46,060
I think very enabling
definition of success and kind
of bring it onto the front

382
00:23:46,461 --> 00:23:48,770
lines with you.
Are there any exercises that you did?

383
00:23:48,771 --> 00:23:53,340
Was it the speaking to the therapist
on a weekly basis? How did, how did,

384
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,430
because this is something I struggle with.

385
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,150
I also be have historically beaten
the hell out of myself for the,

386
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:04,350
the smallest mistakes and always looked
for the things that can be improved

387
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:08,810
rather than the things
that were done well.

388
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,230
So this is also just selfishly
something I'd love to

389
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,760
Tim, I want to give you a
hug. It's true. It's true.

390
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:21,620
It's true. I mean I feel you're
like it's, I don't know why I'm,

391
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:26,200
we are wired this way, but we are and
it's its own struggle. I absolutely,

392
00:24:26,201 --> 00:24:30,400
you know, I still get those emails. One
really clear example that I can think of.

393
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,950
Oh here. You know what, this is so epic.

394
00:24:32,951 --> 00:24:37,951
So I had to separate fact checkers
checking my book for Science,

395
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,060
um, for the cooking science, just
because I'm not a scientist and I,

396
00:24:42,061 --> 00:24:45,010
I'm sure I got some things wrong and it
turned out I got a bunch of things wrong.

397
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,440
And so luckily we caught
almost all of them.

398
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:51,940
And in the last minute sort of shuffle
to like input all of their changes.

399
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,970
I accidentally, um, what's the word
when you invert? Aye. Aye. Aye.

400
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,910
I said something positive when sh sorta
you should have used a negative, right.

401
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,870
Inverted the thing.

402
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,400
And it ended up being like on the very
first page of anything science related in

403
00:25:06,401 --> 00:25:11,401
the book page 29 and it was like the
most basic definition of osmosis.

404
00:25:11,771 --> 00:25:16,150
Right? And I accidentally inverted
it and gave the opposite definition,

405
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,310
which really sets me up to look like an
idiot, you know, for the next 400 pages.

406
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,600
And,
and so and so,

407
00:25:25,601 --> 00:25:28,060
and it happened in,

408
00:25:28,061 --> 00:25:31,990
and I didn't realize that this
had happened until the very first,

409
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:35,050
the day of publication when like
the first Amazon reviews went up.

410
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:39,430
And someone very kindly mentioned it
in an Amazon review and I lost my mind.

411
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,420
I was like, this is going to, you know,
cause 70,000 books had been printed.

412
00:25:43,421 --> 00:25:43,691
I was like,

413
00:25:43,691 --> 00:25:47,380
70,000 people are going to get the
wrong information and understand us.

414
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:50,560
Moses wrong because of me. Um,
you know, think I'm stupid.

415
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,880
And um, and I sort of just
was like, everyone, you know,

416
00:25:54,881 --> 00:25:59,680
this is comes true that my greatest fear
that I'm not a brilliant food science

417
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:03,190
person, you know, which I'm
not as brilliant food science
person, like all of this.

418
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,580
And so really sort of was,

419
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:10,750
and that was really hard for me
to let go of and be like, well,

420
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:14,980
I made a mistake. It's a mistake. I
tried my best and everything else.

421
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,290
There's going to be many
more copies of this book.

422
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:19,510
We're going to fix it for the future.
And,

423
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,340
and so I sort of was able to work through
the idea that I had made a mistake,

424
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:27,370
you know, and a mistake is totally
different than making a bad choice.

425
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,060
Or I had just forgive myself
for making a mistake. And then,

426
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,410
so maybe a year after that,
um,

427
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:39,510
I received this really nasty email
from somebody who took the time to,

428
00:26:39,551 --> 00:26:41,770
you know, and he was a
scientist, he's a scientist.

429
00:26:41,771 --> 00:26:46,771
And so he took the time to this really
angry email about this mistake and how if

430
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:49,800
on page 29 it was basically like he,

431
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:54,860
he actualized the things that I had been
so afraid of a year before and he made

432
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:59,130
it, he made it true, right? He
manifested my worst nightmare.

433
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,620
And so he wrote me this
really mean email about how,

434
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:06,240
how could this have made
it to publication and what,

435
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:10,170
how lazy was I and my publisher
and don't we do fact checking.

436
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,630
And if this mistake is on page 29,

437
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,590
then he couldn't possibly trust anything
else I have to say and all of this kind

438
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:19,800
of stuff. And by that time,
like I had been so sort of,

439
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,570
I had forgiven myself for this mistake
so clearly that I was able to write back

440
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:29,040
to him and say, listen, you know, this
was a mistake. I'm sorry for this mistake.

441
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,740
We've remedied it since
in future printings.

442
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,790
And I really hope that the
next time you make a mistake,

443
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:40,440
people treat you with more compassion
than you just treated me, you know? Yeah.

444
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,230
And so, and so, and then he wrote back,

445
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,290
he actually wrote back and he was
super sorry, but it was just, you know,

446
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,280
that he took, it was a, it came on like
the official letterhead of his university.

447
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,610
And so,
um,

448
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:59,310
that was a good practice for me to sort
of understand the cycle of this thing,

449
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:03,780
you know, and um, you know, of
course I'm going to beat myself up,

450
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:07,860
but like then what do I do right after
that? And so how do I reframe it?

451
00:28:07,861 --> 00:28:12,600
And like often what I like to do is think
about how I treat somebody else or how

452
00:28:12,601 --> 00:28:16,650
I would talk to a friend of mine who
made a mistake is such a mistake or got

453
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:20,520
received such criticism and I would
always be way nicer to anyone else.

454
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:24,900
So I'm trying my hardest to
treat myself like that now too.

455
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,490
But that's easier said than done,

456
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,050
you said, than done. But it's, it's,

457
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:36,470
I think it gets easier with the,

458
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:42,110
the addition of examples like that and
people hearing that so that they don't

459
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:47,181
feel quite as alone a but also be enabled
in a sense because they see that it

460
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:52,480
can be improved. Uh, and I have to,

461
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,250
I have to share one, one book
story because it's, it's, uh,

462
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,550
it's not entirely dissimilar,
but I don't,

463
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,230
I don't know if I've shared it before it,

464
00:29:00,231 --> 00:29:02,790
I just feel compelled because
I'm over caffeinated, which is,

465
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:05,190
I remember when my first book,
so the four hour work week,

466
00:29:05,191 --> 00:29:10,191
it's getting printed and I'm going
to get my first real copy and I,

467
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,570
I come home for lunch at
one point and there's this,

468
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,150
there's this thick yellow,

469
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:23,310
a padded envelope that has been shipped
to my house and owns on the doorstep and

470
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:26,610
I pick it up and I know it's the
book and what I said to myself,

471
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:30,300
it did not open it. I said to myself,
I know when I opened this book,

472
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,620
I'm going to find a typo and I
need to prepare for that typo.

473
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:39,540
So I waited all day until like 7:00
PM like poured a glass of wine,

474
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:41,680
like sat at my kitchen
table and this book.

475
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:46,900
And then right in the fucking dedication,
huge type of like first,

476
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,630
like even before we get to
the front matter, I'm like,

477
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,040
you have to be fucking kidding
me. I'm glad I have my wine. But,

478
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,410
and at that point, the same
thing, you're like, okay,

479
00:29:56,411 --> 00:29:59,230
there are however many tens of thousands
of these flooding or a hundred people

480
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:02,800
are going to open it before they even
get to my first paragraph of pros.

481
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,673
I'd be like,
what?

482
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:05,820
Okay.

483
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,420
Oh my Gotcha.

484
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,420
Oh Man. I mean it's still gets me, I mean,

485
00:30:10,421 --> 00:30:13,840
I write a column for The Times
magazine where, you know,

486
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:15,100
it goes through two editors,

487
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:20,101
at least a fact checker and the copy
editor and still mistakes get through,

488
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,220
you know,
and,

489
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,020
and people really take the time to write
to me about grammatical errors and so,

490
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,480
and so I just,
and it always,

491
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:31,990
I have a little punch in my gut and then
I'm just like, well, it was a mistake.

492
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,170
You know, I, I haven't had,

493
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,410
I'm getting better at one small
way in which I'm getting better at.

494
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:42,130
Being Nicer to myself is letting
go of mistakes. And it is,

495
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,460
I do think it's really funny for people
like me in here when we're literally

496
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:49,510
faced with them on the very first page.
Like it's just a good reminder, you know?

497
00:30:49,511 --> 00:30:50,344
No one's perfect.

498
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,290
Yeah.
No matter what.

499
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,890
Like every single time you have a piece
of writing that is important to you,

500
00:30:56,891 --> 00:31:00,160
there will be some error that I think has,

501
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:05,220
has like a conscious of its own and just
will's itself through all of the copy

502
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:10,660
editors to make its way into,
into print. But so it goes,

503
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:14,740
have you found any particular I've,
and I'm not proud of this,

504
00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:18,610
but I've never gone to
therapy. Uh, I've, I've,

505
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:21,820
I've actually had a few
sessions here and there,

506
00:31:21,821 --> 00:31:25,480
but really something like three or four
sessions over the course of my life and

507
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:28,300
it never,
I never took to it.

508
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:32,500
Have you found any particular type
of therapy to be helpful for you?

509
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,230
Um, I love my therapist. I,

510
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,260
he's the only one I've ever been to.

511
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:42,650
I met him because he was my friend's
boyfriend's therapist. So, um,

512
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,660
and as,

513
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,860
and being an insane
person who I'm just like,

514
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,170
I'm just really highly anxious and
highly, you know, kind of neurotic.

515
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,383
Um,

516
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:59,490
I googled his name a whole bunch of times
before I went to go see him and after

517
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:03,190
I started seeing him to try and figure
it out as much information about them and

518
00:32:03,191 --> 00:32:06,190
the kind of therapy that he
practices as possible. But he's,

519
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,600
he's definitely old school therapists.

520
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:10,390
There's no information on
the Internet about him.

521
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,880
So I actually don't even really know.

522
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:16,420
I've asked him so many times and he's
really evasive about the specific kinds of

523
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:20,770
things cause he incorporates, I
think so many different types of, um,

524
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,540
methods into his work. And even in, we've
been together I think almost almost,

525
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:30,730
maybe not quite 10 years yet,
but um, he's changed a lot.

526
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:34,570
I can tell that he's going out and
learning and the things that he focuses on

527
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:39,130
change a lot so far, very frustratingly
to me for a really long time.

528
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,900
His answer to almost anything.
I would say would be like,

529
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:43,940
and how do you feel in your body?
And I was like,

530
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:48,590
I don't want to talk about how I feel my
body. I want you to tell me what to do.

531
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:53,240
Like, what's this
illusion? And so, and so.

532
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:58,130
Um, but it's like over many years he has
trained me to really be attuned to my

533
00:32:58,131 --> 00:33:02,600
feelings and my body, which I think
that's a lot of somatic work. And, um,

534
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,760
and I think technically what he does
is CBT, cognitive behavioral therapy.

535
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,040
And so that's sort of
the larger framework.

536
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,640
And then within that we do a lot of
meditation and a lot of lives at this

537
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:16,460
somatic work. And, um,

538
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:22,060
I feel like for somebody like me who
is so much in my head and so much about

539
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,380
action,
um,

540
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:29,450
it is such a nice practice and
such a great gift to myself, um,

541
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,480
to have this place where I go once a week
where I am just led back into my body

542
00:33:39,081 --> 00:33:44,081
and into my feelings and have trained
myself to really be aware of my feelings

543
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:50,200
and not just my thoughts. Um,
I think for, yeah, I, and,

544
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,540
and so I'm so grateful to
him and to this work for that

545
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:54,711
this,

546
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:57,830
this is something that's top of mind for
me because a friend of mine just came

547
00:33:57,831 --> 00:33:58,750
back,
uh,

548
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,320
I want to say about a month ago from a
going co Vipassana meditation retreat.

549
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:07,820
And I've never gone to
Goink meditation retreat,

550
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:09,620
but it seemed,

551
00:34:09,621 --> 00:34:13,130
at least in his experience
to focus almost,

552
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:18,131
if not completely a exclusively
on bodily sensations.

553
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,700
You're not following your thoughts,

554
00:34:19,701 --> 00:34:23,720
you're always returning to focusing
on these different bodily sensations.

555
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,050
And I'd love to hear if you're willing,

556
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:32,080
because I do think this is very important
for me and potentially for a lot of

557
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:37,010
people listening how
this somatic awareness,

558
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,040
this reconnecting to the body and the
feelings ends up translating to your life.

559
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,090
Right? So whether it's, whether it's,
could you give an example situation?

560
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,940
Yeah, sure. So, um, well, and this, Tim,

561
00:34:51,941 --> 00:34:56,941
it's so crazy because this is not that
different of a conversation than where we

562
00:34:57,611 --> 00:35:01,570
started with the manifestation
journal to be honest. So, um,

563
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:08,050
I have always been a really
like gut lead person,

564
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:13,390
you know, intuitive person. And
especially in my career, like where I'm,

565
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,130
I'm making decisions about,
well,

566
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:18,550
it doesn't feel right to go work for
this or it doesn't feel right to accept

567
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:20,950
that job. And so, um,

568
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:25,270
and anytime I've regretted doing
something or I've gotten myself into some

569
00:35:25,271 --> 00:35:28,600
complicated professional
pickle or a personal pickle,

570
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:33,550
it's often because I ignored
that gut feeling, that gut voice.

571
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:39,090
And so what this work teaches me to do
is I'm basically just strengthening the

572
00:35:40,021 --> 00:35:44,400
muscle of that gut feeling. You know?
And sometimes it's not just my gut,

573
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,040
it's sometimes my heart feeling.
Um,

574
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,680
but I'm teaching myself to listen to the,

575
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:53,460
to like really like quiet everything
else really as much as possible,

576
00:35:53,461 --> 00:35:56,430
quiet my mind and all the
things telling me, well,

577
00:35:56,431 --> 00:36:01,320
you should do this or there was this much
money, or shouldn't you do this thing?

578
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,360
Because then you would get to be on a,
you know,

579
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,930
billboard with so and so or whatever,
you know, all these other reasons.

580
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:11,160
It sort of gets rid of the reasoning and
it helps me listen to my heart and my

581
00:36:11,161 --> 00:36:15,090
gut. So let me think of an example. Um,

582
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,560
that recently happened. Uh, Ooh,

583
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,690
well here, here's a, here's

584
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,890
something you could disguise
details to protect. No, I'm
just, I'm trying to, no, no,

585
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:32,940
I am, I mean there are, I'm
just trying, they're like, I
have a friend who recently,

586
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:36,810
so I have been, I've been
in a lot of emotional pain
for the last several months.

587
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:40,560
I've been in a really sort of just
like feeling the weight of the world.

588
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,200
I have been,
um,

589
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,770
learning a lot of things about my own
life and things that I feel responsible

590
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:51,270
for in terms of ways that
I've participated in,

591
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:54,630
in sort of, I don't know, um,

592
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,960
systems that have put me down,
you know,

593
00:36:57,961 --> 00:37:02,070
as like a immigrant kid with
a funny name and sort of,

594
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:07,071
I had made decisions to maybe if I just
achieve enough that people won't notice

595
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:10,530
that I'm different and
then they'll accept me.

596
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,240
There's been a lot of
that in my life of like,

597
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:16,710
let me infiltrate this elite institution
and make my way to the top and then

598
00:37:16,711 --> 00:37:21,120
there will be no way that anyone
can deny that I belong here.

599
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,620
So that's sort of been looking back at
my life. That's been the pattern of,

600
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,820
of everything that I've done and I,

601
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:31,680
I'm sort of reckoning with what that's
meant for me and how I want to continue

602
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:35,250
moving forward. And there, there's
a lot of pain in that for me.

603
00:37:35,251 --> 00:37:39,210
So I've been really down and a lot
of my friends can really tell that.

604
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:43,060
And to the point where a lot of them
started checking in on me like the other

605
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,950
phone via text,

606
00:37:43,951 --> 00:37:48,951
via email and I didn't know why a lot of
people were checking in on me because I

607
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:54,120
just have been in such sort of rage
and pain and I have had this boulder of

608
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:00,060
anger and sadness and hurt in my chest.

609
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:04,410
And about a month ago I went to go talk
to a friend who reached out to me and

610
00:38:04,411 --> 00:38:06,960
she said, please come talk to me.
Like I want to talk to you about this.

611
00:38:06,961 --> 00:38:11,070
I'm worried about you. I'm worried that
you don't have the kind of supportive,

612
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,181
you know,
deeply,

613
00:38:12,181 --> 00:38:15,690
mutually supportive relationships in
your life that will support you through

614
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:16,051
this.

615
00:38:16,051 --> 00:38:19,950
And also through all of the stuff that's
coming your way with this show coming

616
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:21,000
out and all this kind of stuff.

617
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,570
So I went there and I thought she was
going to give me a hug and tell me how

618
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:25,404
much she loves me

619
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:31,920
and tell me how great I am and I deserve
all this great friendship or whatever.

620
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:35,130
And she actually sat me down
and she said, you know, these,

621
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,900
these ways in which you've
been letting down me,

622
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,920
you've been letting down the people
around you and I know that you're in pain

623
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:44,200
cause you feel really
lonely on separate from us,

624
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,890
but you're actually doing it to yourself.
And um,

625
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,920
and so if you can work
on some of this stuff,

626
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:55,090
I think it will not only improve your
relationships, but you'll feel better.

627
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:59,320
And I mean, I was not, it was
a real intense come to Jesus.

628
00:38:59,321 --> 00:39:00,890
We were standing on the side of the,

629
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,490
like on the corner of the street
and San Francisco and cry.

630
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,680
We were both crying for like two
hours. It was really intense. And,

631
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,460
and um, I did not expect
it at all. And, you know,

632
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:13,450
and she said all this stuff.

633
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:15,940
And my immediate reaction
was to be really defensive.

634
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,380
And then as soon as I started to form
the defensive sentences and, but this,

635
00:39:20,381 --> 00:39:23,560
but that I realize like,
well,

636
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:26,650
it doesn't even matter because
her experience of me isn't,

637
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:31,150
it has nothing to do with my reasons
for why I have not been there for her in

638
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:34,720
this way or that way.
So I just sort of like deflated.

639
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:37,930
And I looked at her and I said, well, what
do I do? Like, how do I be better for us,

640
00:39:37,931 --> 00:39:41,770
for you, for me, for our friends. And so
she told me, and she said later, she said,

641
00:39:41,771 --> 00:39:45,550
I can't believe you didn't even have a
single defensive reaction like it was. I,

642
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:48,790
I was really prepared for that.
And it was really amazing that you did it.

643
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
So we had this very intense sort of three
hours together where we unpacked all

644
00:39:54,611 --> 00:39:57,130
of this stuff.
And I asked her what I could do,

645
00:39:57,131 --> 00:40:01,930
she gave me a whole list of basic ways
in which I could be a better friend. And,

646
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,550
um, and ultimately I felt very loved
because I think it's really hard to tell

647
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:09,070
somebody, you know, those
to have those hard talks.

648
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:14,340
So I felt really loved and cared for by
the fact that she took the time and the

649
00:40:14,351 --> 00:40:19,150
energy and set the intention of setting
me straight in these things. And,

650
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,430
um,
as I was driving home,

651
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:27,190
I got back into my car and I had this ice.
I sat and I buckled the safe.

652
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,970
I think when I buckled the safety
belt and it went across my chest,

653
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:36,420
I realize that this pain that this
boulder of pain that has been in my chest

654
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:42,070
probably at least since December, you
know, six or seven or eight months, um,

655
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,473
was gone.

656
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:48,040
And it wasn't that I felt
so great all of a sudden,

657
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:53,250
but this rock that has been weighing
down every breath was no longer there.

658
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,070
And I, um, it,

659
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,480
it sort of maybe had been broken
up and dispersed into my body.

660
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:05,050
And I woke up the next
morning and I cried. I mean,

661
00:41:05,051 --> 00:41:09,880
I was still really upset about get
receiving this sort of very difficult

662
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:14,650
feedback. But I also felt realized
I felt really empowered because she,

663
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:19,690
you know, so much of my pain has been
about a feeling of powerlessness.

664
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,613
Um,

665
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:24,340
a feeling that like there are so many
things going on in the world that I have

666
00:41:24,341 --> 00:41:29,200
no power to change or improve.
And this,

667
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:33,680
she gave me something I could do something
about and not only could I do about

668
00:41:33,681 --> 00:41:33,831
it,

669
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:38,831
but I could make my life better and my
friends' lives better in the process.

670
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,710
And so,
um,

671
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:47,670
I think having power and feeling,
feeling, feeling the, you know,

672
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:52,870
very strong and pure love of my friend
really hoped to dissolve this bad

673
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:57,200
feeling. And this is not to say
like my depression has lifted.

674
00:41:57,201 --> 00:42:01,190
I suddenly feel so much better, but I
will say there was a market difference,

675
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:05,990
a market immediate difference. And
everyone who I'm around is like, wow,

676
00:42:05,991 --> 00:42:08,420
you're so much lighter.
And I really do feel a lot lighter.

677
00:42:08,421 --> 00:42:12,240
So I don't know if that was
really clear for you, but um,

678
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:17,750
uh, it's, I think this is
important territory to explore.

679
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:21,590
So I appreciate you
being game and we will,

680
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:26,210
we will probably come
back to some of this,

681
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:27,370
but I don't want,

682
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:32,410
I want to make sure that we explore the
entire map of the terrain up and down.

683
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:38,540
And you mentioned,
you mentioned a love a few times,

684
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:42,590
so I thought perhaps if
you'd be willing to share,

685
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:44,780
if you could answer the question,

686
00:42:44,781 --> 00:42:48,830
when did you first fall in love with food?
I mean,

687
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:50,360
was there any particular moment,

688
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:55,361
any particular meal where it just really
kind of grabbed you by the collar and,

689
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:02,500
and it made you become as a involves
or excited about food as you are today?

690
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:08,990
Oh Wow. I don't know. You know,

691
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:14,020
I don't know because my mom is such
an incredible cook and it was um,

692
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,410
cooking for us and shopping for us and
spending time on food was the primary way

693
00:43:21,411 --> 00:43:26,000
that my mom really showed us her love.

694
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:26,900
Um,

695
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:31,900
I think I've always associated cooking
and eating with that feeling of like

696
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:37,040
maternal warmth, you know? And it's
what I try to put out into the world.

697
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:41,080
There was, there is, I don't remember
eating less, but the story is out.

698
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,130
I have so many pictures
of myself as a little kid.

699
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,490
And the stories also for me now as a cook,

700
00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:50,960
there's so many things that I understand
about the lengths that my mom went to

701
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:56,330
to make this really delicious
and nutritious and culturally
meaningful food for

702
00:43:56,331 --> 00:44:00,020
us every day. And how much work went
into that and how much time and labor.

703
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:03,470
And so, um, there's a lot of
things that in retrospect,

704
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:08,420
I have so much appreciation for her
about that I probably just couldn't have

705
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,680
ever imagined. But there's this dish
that she, quote unquote invented

706
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:19,280
called Salmon Polo and Polo just
means rice. And so, and it was,

707
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:22,070
I think the food she fed me
when I was teething, you know,

708
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:24,590
and it was this like Mushy,
right?

709
00:44:24,591 --> 00:44:29,480
It was a long like bus Marty rice with
like really soft pieces of potato and

710
00:44:29,481 --> 00:44:34,380
tomato and chicken. And so it was just all
these like, you know, typical kid foods.

711
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:35,850
Um,
but really,

712
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:39,270
really soft so that you could eat him
even if he didn't have teeth. And,

713
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:41,390
and,
um,

714
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,910
and I would eat that with yogurt and I
loved it so much and I loved that there

715
00:44:44,911 --> 00:44:49,590
was a dish named after me,
you know, like, and um,

716
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,430
and I still sometimes go make
that for myself. Like, so to me,

717
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:58,020
I think the Salmon Polo is a,
is a great example of that. Um,

718
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:01,860
and it's funny because
there have been for sure,

719
00:45:01,861 --> 00:45:05,760
some really meaningful
meals that I've had. Um,

720
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:10,820
and there's the one that sort of led me
to become a cook that was I think really

721
00:45:10,921 --> 00:45:14,660
important in the story and
in the timeline. But, um,

722
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,310
very rarely is,

723
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,800
is a meal for me about the food.

724
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:22,890
It's almost always about what
happens at the table, you know,

725
00:45:22,891 --> 00:45:27,420
in the conversations and the feelings
and all that kind of stuff. So I think,

726
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:29,340
yeah, for me, like, yeah,

727
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,000
it's maybe also not the healthiest thing
to associate foods so deeply with love,

728
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:39,750
but, so you were, uh,

729
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,700
well, let me just ask the question. Where
did you grow up? I grew up in San Diego.

730
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:45,540
I was born there.

731
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:50,040
My parents came from Iran in
the mid seventies to San Diego.

732
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,330
And then,
um,

733
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:57,050
I was born in 79 and I have
lived this really funny,

734
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:02,850
you know, in retrospect, this
really funny life where I was art,

735
00:46:02,851 --> 00:46:05,250
my high school was two
blocks from the beach.

736
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:09,870
I grew up going to the beach all the
time. I eaten fish Tacos, you know,

737
00:46:09,871 --> 00:46:14,460
hanging, driving around in cars with
all my, like very American friends.

738
00:46:14,461 --> 00:46:18,270
And then I would come home and my mom
always said, when you come back home,

739
00:46:18,271 --> 00:46:23,010
this is Iran. And so at home we spoke
Farsi or Persian rugs everywhere.

740
00:46:23,011 --> 00:46:24,750
We Ate Persian food,
you know,

741
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:28,470
she insisted that we like follow the
traditions of the culture and respect our

742
00:46:28,471 --> 00:46:32,400
elders. And so I, I
very much had this, um,

743
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:36,690
these two worlds that I
was very aware of and,

744
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:41,150
and still sort of look back and think,
think a lot about and,

745
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,410
and think a lot about
how that's defined me.

746
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:47,910
And I think it led to me feeling like an
outsider no matter where I was because

747
00:46:47,911 --> 00:46:51,600
I'd never quite belonged. And I, in a way,

748
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:56,601
I think that feeling of never quite
belonging has come into co is one of my

749
00:46:59,041 --> 00:47:01,320
super powers because I,

750
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:05,010
it's very easy for me even
as I become more like,

751
00:47:05,011 --> 00:47:10,011
quote unquote popular or successful or
whatever to imagine what it's like to be

752
00:47:11,641 --> 00:47:12,600
on the outside.

753
00:47:12,601 --> 00:47:17,601
And so it really has made inclusivity and
inclusion be a fundamental part of all

754
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:20,070
of my work.

755
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:24,630
And so whether I'm writing a recipe
for the New York Times magazine and I

756
00:47:24,631 --> 00:47:29,370
constantly put myself into the shoes of
someone who doesn't live in California,

757
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:31,750
have access to the world's best produce,
you know,

758
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,020
or what ingredients can anyone
buy at any grocery store?

759
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:40,050
Or will these instructions make sense to
anyone or am I using language that will

760
00:47:40,241 --> 00:47:44,830
make you feel like you don't
belong here or, or, um,

761
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,570
or whatever.
So to me,

762
00:47:46,571 --> 00:47:51,571
it's this funny thing where these things
that caused me so much sort of pain and

763
00:47:52,151 --> 00:47:56,060
confusion as a kid have ended up being,
um,

764
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,060
really wonderful tools and my work.

765
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,670
I'm so glad you're,

766
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:04,730
you're talking about not fitting
in being a gift and it's just,

767
00:48:05,251 --> 00:48:07,830
it's so timely and I feel like we should,

768
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,570
we should definitely hug
it out at some point. But

769
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:12,900
literally just a week ago,

770
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,960
I was reflecting on how many of the
things that I've viewed from my past as

771
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:25,470
having damage to me or resulting in me
being damaged have actually been gifts

772
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:30,980
and w and one of them was always feeling
in a sense that I didn't fit in and

773
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:35,610
being an observer,
right?

774
00:48:35,611 --> 00:48:37,650
Because at least I don't know
what your experience was like,

775
00:48:37,651 --> 00:48:42,480
but I very often ended up standing in a
room and feeling like I wasn't actually

776
00:48:42,481 --> 00:48:46,140
there, but I was like a camera on the
wall observing what was happening.

777
00:48:46,141 --> 00:48:50,790
And what I noticed for instance,
in your writing, and I,

778
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,870
I've read a million cookbooks,
uh,

779
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:59,240
except I certainly would not consider
myself a real chef as you are,

780
00:48:59,401 --> 00:49:01,020
but have read a lot.

781
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:05,730
I keep very few in my actual kitchen.
And,

782
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:06,060
uh,

783
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:11,060
your book is one of those books because
you are so good at putting on the Lens,

784
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:17,400
uh, of beginner's mind. And

785
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:24,020
really putting yourself in the place
of whoever it is you are writing for,

786
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:28,500
who's intended to receive the teaching
that you are putting down on paper or on

787
00:49:28,501 --> 00:49:28,921
the screen.

788
00:49:28,921 --> 00:49:33,921
So I wanted to dig into that a little bit
because I feel that that reframe is so

789
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,850
powerful and it's easy to forget too.

790
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,580
It's easy to forget to put those
glasses on with that reframe. Okay.

791
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:48,490
For sure. I have, I definitely
have a response to your question,

792
00:49:48,491 --> 00:49:53,491
but also you said something so beautiful
and so crazy that I feel like I needed

793
00:49:54,941 --> 00:49:59,500
to read you this quote that I just saw
on Instagram. No, I'm ready. I'm ready.

794
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:04,180
Okay. So I just pulled it up. Um,
it was by Marco Pierre White to I,

795
00:50:04,181 --> 00:50:07,600
do you know who he was? Yeah, that's
what, is it? White heat or white hot.

796
00:50:07,601 --> 00:50:12,270
What was the book that he, was this
like, um, he is, he's not, he's not,

797
00:50:12,271 --> 00:50:16,410
he's still alive. Sorry, sorry.
Marco Pierre White. Um, he,

798
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,710
he, I don't even know how
to describe him. He was a,

799
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:24,720
a trendsetting avant garde chef in
London in the eighties and nineties.

800
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:26,910
He was kind of the original bad boy,
if you will,

801
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:32,060
a pro tow Anthony Bordain in some ways
just like known for his aggressiveness

802
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:36,170
and um, and his sort of
brilliance and his creativity.

803
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:39,710
And I think he's just sort of this
like tortured bad boy kind of guy.

804
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,430
And so there's this beautiful
picture I saw of him on,

805
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:48,140
on this account called niche on
Instagram and this quote from him.

806
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,520
So he wrote, I believe there's
really two species of human beings.

807
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,730
The first species is the most common.
There's more of them.

808
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:57,500
They're individuals who like,

809
00:50:57,501 --> 00:51:01,400
we all are born into a certain world
and they become a product of that world.

810
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:05,900
They absorb that environment they're born
into, they become an extension of it.

811
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,740
They become part of it. The
rarer species, in my opinion,

812
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:12,350
is the individual who has
been damaged as a child.

813
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:15,320
They have suffered
misfortune and great tragedy.

814
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:19,250
This doesn't mean that they're better
people, it just means they've suffered.

815
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:22,400
And very few individuals
suffer that tragedy.

816
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,150
But what happens is an
invisible shell covers you.

817
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:29,900
It protects you so you don't absorb
the world you're brought into.

818
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:34,840
You don't become part of that
world. You observe that world. Wow.

819
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:39,080
It was like exactly what you just said.
That's incredible.

820
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:41,960
And so it was really,
I mean,

821
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:45,410
and I don't know that my life has been
so dramatic to have been filled with like

822
00:51:45,411 --> 00:51:50,360
that level of tragedy, but absolutely I
think even small pains and small traumas,

823
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:54,760
you know, or whatever, just like the
circumstances of our lives, you know,

824
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:57,890
can make us feel. And also the
whole idea of being an outsider.

825
00:51:57,891 --> 00:52:00,080
Lately I've been thinking, I'm like, Oh
yeah, I've always felt on the outside,

826
00:52:00,081 --> 00:52:04,580
but I'm like, does anyone really feel
on the inside? Like I don't know.

827
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:06,320
So I don't know.

828
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:10,280
But in terms of the beginner's
mind and that you know, that work,

829
00:52:10,281 --> 00:52:13,610
I think I have to, there are two
sort of parts to that for me.

830
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:16,730
I think when I started
teaching people how to cook,

831
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,740
like I never forgot what it's,

832
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:23,720
what it felt like to be 19 years old
in a worldclass kitchen and not know

833
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:27,380
anything. I didn't know the difference
between Parsley and celery. So,

834
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:31,160
or parsley and Cilantro. I didn't
know personally and celery, but,

835
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:36,020
but you know, I didn't know anything.
I didn't know any fancy terms.

836
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:38,150
I didn't know even the most basic things.

837
00:52:38,151 --> 00:52:41,390
Everything just was sort of
overwhelming and too much information.

838
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:46,720
And so I've never forgotten the feeling
of being so overwhelmed and lost and

839
00:52:48,501 --> 00:52:50,060
having nothing to cling to.

840
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:54,620
And I feel like as long as I can
remember that and return to that,

841
00:52:54,621 --> 00:52:58,910
every time I go to teach
or talk or write that,

842
00:52:58,911 --> 00:53:02,510
then I'm really serving the people
that I'm trying to serve, which,

843
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:04,400
who are the people who don't know?
You know,

844
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:09,500
there are so many times where I had
to re set myself and remember I wasn't

845
00:53:09,501 --> 00:53:13,760
writing my book or doing my work
to impress my peers. You know,

846
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:17,000
it's not for them. You know, it's not, uh,

847
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:21,110
also like their way their million
better chefs out there then, then me,

848
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:23,090
and I'm not out there
to compete with them.

849
00:53:23,091 --> 00:53:27,990
I'm there to sort of be a translator
from the professional, you know,

850
00:53:27,991 --> 00:53:29,880
for the amateur,
from the professional kitchen.

851
00:53:29,881 --> 00:53:34,881
So if I can remember that and remember
the feeling of being the beginner,

852
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:39,330
then I can do my job right.
And as a writer, this, um,

853
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:45,020
the way I would say the person who really
has served as a model for me in that

854
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:47,940
more than anyone else is Michael Pollan.

855
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:54,330
And we're definitely going to
definitely get a dig into, into Michael.

856
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,820
Yeah. And so I talked to him, I talked
to him right after he recorded with you.

857
00:53:59,821 --> 00:54:03,840
And He, yeah, he had such a great, great,
he just, I think like you blew his mind,

858
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,200
but, um, feeling is mutual.

859
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,690
I don't know how that guy
speaks and finished prose,

860
00:54:09,691 --> 00:54:14,280
but maybe I'll figure it out.
But he,

861
00:54:14,281 --> 00:54:19,200
um, he really taught me,
you know, and this wasn't
something he actively taught me.

862
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:24,180
I learned by reading his work and really
sitting with what it was that was so

863
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:27,840
moving and effective about
the way that he writes.

864
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,930
And it's that he is not,
um,

865
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:35,760
it's a old time timeworn journalistic
tool to put yourself in, you know,

866
00:54:35,761 --> 00:54:37,740
to go do the experiential journalism.

867
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:42,741
He just has this incredible way of
immersing himself in really complicated

868
00:54:44,131 --> 00:54:49,131
worlds and being able to
articulate them the war,

869
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:53,700
like what he's experiencing and what
he's learning in a way for anybody.

870
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:55,020
And so,
you know,

871
00:54:55,021 --> 00:54:59,310
he did that with really
complicated things about GMO corn.

872
00:54:59,311 --> 00:55:02,040
He did that with the botanical world.

873
00:55:02,041 --> 00:55:04,320
He's done that with the
architectural world. And you know,

874
00:55:04,321 --> 00:55:06,360
most recently he's done it
in the psychedelic world.

875
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:11,100
And so when I first sat down to write,
I was like, okay, I'm going to do this,

876
00:55:11,101 --> 00:55:14,790
the Michael Pollan way.
And I tried to do what he would do,

877
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:18,360
which was to be this guide,
you know, this new, big guide.

878
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,810
But I realized that wasn't who I was,
you know,

879
00:55:21,811 --> 00:55:25,230
what I needed to do was establish
some authority as a teacher.

880
00:55:25,231 --> 00:55:29,130
So I couldn't take you on this
journey with me. You know, he's,

881
00:55:29,131 --> 00:55:32,820
he's so good at doing it in a way where
he's not condescending at all and he's,

882
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:34,950
but yet he's so informative.

883
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:40,260
And so I really had to sort of sit with
that and let it distill through my bones

884
00:55:40,261 --> 00:55:44,580
and through my mind and figure out how
can I take that kernel of not being

885
00:55:44,581 --> 00:55:48,840
condescending of being really clear
and articulate of holding your hand and

886
00:55:48,841 --> 00:55:52,140
bring you through here yet
also having some authority.

887
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:56,910
And so the best way that I found to do
that was to do what I did when I teach

888
00:55:56,911 --> 00:55:58,950
people how to cook.
And when I talked to them,

889
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:02,310
which is to tell the stories
of when I didn't know anything.

890
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:07,350
And all of the 9,000 times I've messed
everything up because that is the closest

891
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:12,380
that I can be to being in your shoes as
a person who maybe doesn't know how to

892
00:56:12,571 --> 00:56:15,690
deep fry, you know, or as afraid you're
going to burn your house down or whatever.

893
00:56:15,691 --> 00:56:16,830
So,
um,

894
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:21,990
so ultimately I couldn't be Michael Pollan
and that's fine for both of us, but,

895
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:25,720
but I could learn from him and,
and really sort of put,

896
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,240
put some of his techniques into action

897
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,570
and we are going to revisit
that. Uh, because I'm,

898
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:34,890
I'm fascinated by writing process,
which really for people read it, uh,

899
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:37,110
for people reading,
if you're reading them this,

900
00:56:37,111 --> 00:56:40,080
then I want to figure out how
you're achieving synesthesia.

901
00:56:40,081 --> 00:56:43,650
But the listening to this writing process,

902
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:46,050
you can just substitute creative
process. It's same, same,

903
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:50,490
I mean same with experimenting in
the kitchen. Same with you name it,

904
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:51,840
composing new music.

905
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:56,580
But you had mentioned age 19 and I,

906
00:56:56,670 --> 00:57:00,240
this might be a good
segue to the question.

907
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,240
How did you first get
exposed to Alice Waters?

908
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:04,840
Um,

909
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:09,250
so the very first time I ever heard of
Alice Waters was when I moved to Berkeley

910
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:12,190
in 1997 to attend college.

911
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,520
And at my freshman orientation
somebody was like, oh.

912
00:57:15,521 --> 00:57:18,730
And there's a famous restaurant
with a famous chef in town.

913
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:22,240
And to me,
coming from San Diego,

914
00:57:22,241 --> 00:57:26,590
eating mostly home cooked food and
sometimes fish tacos and Mexican food and

915
00:57:26,591 --> 00:57:28,840
Chinese food or whatever.
There was no,

916
00:57:28,841 --> 00:57:32,500
I had no concept of what a fancy
restaurant or a famous chef was.

917
00:57:32,501 --> 00:57:34,930
So that sort of went in
one ear and out the other.

918
00:57:34,931 --> 00:57:39,670
And then the following year I fell
in love and my boyfriend was from San

919
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:43,360
Francisco and we spent all of our time,
like all of our free time eating.

920
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:48,450
Yeah, totally. And so
he took me, you know,

921
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:52,150
to his favorite ice cream place and his
favorite pizza place and all of the sort

922
00:57:52,151 --> 00:57:56,020
of childhood places. And he had
always wanted to go to Chez Panisse.

923
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:00,460
And so I still didn't really
know what it was and I,

924
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:03,520
but we decided to save. We
just, I knew it was expensive,

925
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:07,270
so we saved $220 over the
course of seven months.

926
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:11,200
And we, um, there's a
whole thing where it,

927
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,920
you have to reserve your table at
Chez Panisse a month in advance.

928
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:19,030
But the menu which has fixed only
is published a week in advance.

929
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:22,540
And so I was not yet a really
adventurous eater, you know,

930
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:23,610
and the definitely things,

931
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:28,150
so we did this complicated thing where
we reserved for like four nights in a row

932
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,750
and then when the menu was published,
we,

933
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:36,040
we chose the one we wanted and canceled
all the other ones because the menu is

934
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:39,860
different each day. Yeah. It's different
each night. And so I was like, Ooh,

935
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:42,340
that one looks like it,
you know? And so then we,

936
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:46,540
so then we went in and
I was, yeah, I was 19.

937
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:50,170
I was wearing a black
tank top and denim skirt.

938
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:54,700
We were very out of place in this
very probably a Berkeley is fanciest

939
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:56,640
restaurant. Um, I,

940
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:01,090
I think everyone probably knew
that we were not regulars. And, um,

941
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:06,190
and we had this really special meal and
I grew up eating really delicious food.

942
00:59:06,191 --> 00:59:11,191
So it wasn't that this food was like
the most amazing thing I'd ever eaten.

943
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:17,010
It was just the entire experience was
unlike any I had ever had in a restaurant.

944
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:22,640
I really felt like I was at somebody's
house and they were caring for me and

945
00:59:22,641 --> 00:59:24,980
they were so attentive to everything.
You know,

946
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:30,210
the bread and butter was never empty.
The water was never empty like the, the,

947
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:32,540
the plate.
The second we were done was whisked away.

948
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:36,770
There was just this sort of attention
that I had never received in a restaurant

949
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:41,360
before. And I think that
really got me. And, um,

950
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:46,100
so when the dessert came,
it was a chocolate souffle and I,

951
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:50,690
the server asked if I had ever
had souffle before and I said no.

952
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:55,490
And she said, would you like me to show
you how to eat it? And I said, yes,

953
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:57,290
please. Sure. And so she said, well,

954
00:59:57,291 --> 01:00:00,920
you poke a hole with your spoon in the
top and then you pour the slim like

955
01:00:00,921 --> 01:00:03,920
raspberry sauce in.
And that way every bite has sauce.

956
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:08,630
So I did that and I took a bite and
she said, how is it? And I said, oh,

957
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:10,220
it's really good,

958
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,400
but it would be a lot better
if I had a glass of cold milk.

959
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:20,980
And I had no idea that it was like so
rude to tell this person and this fancy

960
01:00:21,081 --> 01:00:25,130
restaurant what would make my thing
better. You know, like I, you know,

961
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:30,920
and also I had no idea that in
fancy, you know, dining fine dining,

962
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:35,090
it's considered like a total full
pause to drink milk after 10:00 AM.

963
01:00:35,091 --> 01:00:38,780
That's why in Italy if you order a
Cappuccino after 10:00 AM they know you're

964
01:00:38,781 --> 01:00:41,510
American cause only babies
drink milk after 10:00 AM.

965
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,580
So this idea of like,

966
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:49,600
so like even having like the idea of
like asking for milk with chocolate after

967
01:00:49,601 --> 01:00:54,370
dinner is like so gross to you know,
to people and fancy food. And so,

968
01:00:54,371 --> 01:00:56,950
um, she kind of laughed. She was like,
you want to milk? And I was like, yeah,

969
01:00:56,951 --> 01:00:59,860
like hello hot chocolate.
Then cold milk like good combo.

970
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:03,670
And so she went and she brought me milk
and then she also brought us each a

971
01:01:03,671 --> 01:01:06,380
glass of dessert wine to sort
of teach us the refined to come.

972
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:09,030
Amen. And there was this really
sweet gesture. If you get,

973
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:14,090
once you've enjoyed your cold milk,
you may want to sample another option.

974
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:19,610
It was just this really, I don't
know, it was like a little education.

975
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,260
And so I was so moved by this whole
experience and this whole dinner that I

976
01:01:24,261 --> 01:01:27,710
wrote this letter to Alice
Waters and I said, Oh, you know,

977
01:01:27,711 --> 01:01:31,370
I brought it in a few months later
asking for a job as a busser.

978
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:34,880
And so I always had sort of like a basic
job that I worked throughout college.

979
01:01:34,881 --> 01:01:36,860
So I brought it in and they said,
oh,

980
01:01:36,861 --> 01:01:39,010
you have to bring that
to the floor managers.

981
01:01:39,011 --> 01:01:42,380
So they led me to the four managers
office and when she opened the door,

982
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:46,940
it was the souffle lady. And
so, so she remembered me.

983
01:01:46,941 --> 01:01:48,830
I think I, you know, in retrospect,

984
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:50,780
I think she was probably really
desperate because she was like,

985
01:01:50,781 --> 01:01:54,470
you want to start tomorrow?
So I started,

986
01:01:54,471 --> 01:01:59,471
I started the next day and
pretty immediately I was
just so enchanted by what

987
01:02:00,051 --> 01:02:04,250
was happening in the kitchen and
that I just, I wanted to learn,

988
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:06,680
I wanted to learn what those people knew.
I mean,

989
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:10,640
that restaurant really exists like a
pyramid and the cooks are at the top.

990
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:15,260
They're the most respected, most
skilled people who work there. And, um,

991
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:19,870
I wanted to, I wanted that, you know,
I was so attracted to that with,

992
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:24,750
what did the letter say that
you wrote to? Oh Man, I'm Amy.

993
01:02:24,751 --> 01:02:26,640
Do you remember any of it?
Because you have

994
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:31,290
your letter thing as far as I can
tell him the homework that I've done.

995
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,120
But do you recall at any of the
elements of that letter? Sure.

996
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:37,170
I use the word magical.
It's a very similar,

997
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:38,880
it's a very like semi word is I'm like,

998
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:41,190
I had a magical dinner at
your magical restaurant

999
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:44,970
and I was so inspired.

1000
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:48,660
And I also don't think Alice
Waters ever saw that letter,

1001
01:02:48,661 --> 01:02:52,080
I think at like stopped with the
foreign manager probably. But, um,

1002
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:54,810
I had never worked in a restaurant.
I'm sure I revealed that,

1003
01:02:54,811 --> 01:02:59,010
that I was just so moved
by this incredible dinner
that I wanted to work there.

1004
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:01,080
And could I please have an opportunity?

1005
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:02,880
I think it was a pretty
straightforward one.

1006
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:05,190
I'm pretty good with like the flattery.

1007
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,180
I would say that's like an important part
of these letters in my life where I've,

1008
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:14,450
where I've like, you know, I'm writing
to someone cause I'm a huge fan and um,

1009
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,720
and I'm like looking to collaborate
or for some opportunities.

1010
01:03:17,721 --> 01:03:20,910
So I start like really with like
laying it on thick, you know?

1011
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,440
And I mean it's genuine
but like, and then, um,

1012
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:30,180
and then I do my big ask and so yeah,
I had Dallas waters letter.

1013
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:32,610
Then years later I had
the Michael Pollan letter.

1014
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:38,700
Let's pause on the Michael
Paul, sorry. This is please,

1015
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:43,970
please says sort of time and place when
you get a letter to Michael Pollan.

1016
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:50,160
Oh, I'm in when? When's the
letter to Michael Pang? So, oh,

1017
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:53,770
so that was you about 10 years
later? About 10 years later. Yeah,

1018
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:55,050
almost 10 years later,

1019
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:59,460
I was working at a different restaurant
in Berkeley and I saw Michael Pollan's

1020
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:03,540
name in the reservation book
and I was a huge fan of his.

1021
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:07,020
And I had met him a couple of times that
shape a niece. And he was, he, you know,

1022
01:04:07,021 --> 01:04:11,610
he'd been involved with Alice and,
and her work,

1023
01:04:11,611 --> 01:04:13,890
like their work really
sort of intersected.

1024
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:18,410
And so they were big supporters of
one another. And I remember, you know,

1025
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:21,960
before botany of desire came out
that like for whatever reason,

1026
01:04:21,961 --> 01:04:24,210
we had a copy of a galley
at shape and he said,

1027
01:04:24,211 --> 01:04:27,720
we were passing around and
eat and reading. And I was
like, who is this person?

1028
01:04:27,721 --> 01:04:31,110
This is amazing.
And so since I had read that book,

1029
01:04:31,111 --> 01:04:34,440
I had been a veracious reader
of anything that he wrote.

1030
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:39,470
And I really admired the way that he was
an advocate and so eloquent about the

1031
01:04:40,651 --> 01:04:45,540
things that I care so deeply
about and, and work on. And,

1032
01:04:45,541 --> 01:04:47,850
um,
and so to me,

1033
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:51,960
he was somebody who I really looked
up to also because even though I began

1034
01:04:51,961 --> 01:04:56,280
cooking, I never let go of the
idea of wanting to be a writer.

1035
01:04:56,281 --> 01:04:59,370
Like I always wanted to be a writer
since way before I was a cook.

1036
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:03,960
And that was something that I
really kept pursuing in small ways,

1037
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:05,880
even as I was cooking.

1038
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:10,530
And so by the time that Michael Pollan's
name appeared in our reservation book,

1039
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:16,260
I had applied to a few different creative
writing programs and gotten in and

1040
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:18,640
deferred and never taken a leap.

1041
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:22,450
And I knew that he was teaching at
the UC Berkeley School of journalism.

1042
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:26,770
So I wrote this, I like quickly
scrawled out this card saying, you know,

1043
01:05:26,771 --> 01:05:29,680
I'm your number one fan.
Um, you mean so much to me.

1044
01:05:29,681 --> 01:05:33,880
I would love to come audit one
of your classes. And you know,

1045
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:37,540
basically that it wasn't even a
super big letter. But then, um,

1046
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:41,680
I gave it to the servers and I went home
that night and I asked them to give it

1047
01:05:41,681 --> 01:05:45,730
to him when he was eating.
So then, you know, they did.
And then a few weeks later,

1048
01:05:45,731 --> 01:05:50,260
I mean, this speaks so directly to
who Michael is. He wrote me back,

1049
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:55,180
he wrote me an email and said, why don't
you come in and talk to me? And so, um,

1050
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:56,380
he wrote me back.

1051
01:05:56,410 --> 01:06:01,410
I went in to go talk to him and I asked
him to audit his class and he said,

1052
01:06:01,781 --> 01:06:02,081
you know,

1053
01:06:02,081 --> 01:06:04,900
it might be a little bit tricky because
a lot of people want to audit the class

1054
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:09,250
and, and, and, and so he's
like, but there's one spot,

1055
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,240
there's one extra spot, so why don't
you come on the first day and we'll,

1056
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,610
you know,
you guys can all vie for that spot.

1057
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:19,150
So I showed up first they have this tiny
class and there was like 11 people in

1058
01:06:19,151 --> 01:06:23,740
the class, I think. And I think over
200 people showed up for that last spot.

1059
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:25,870
And so,
um,

1060
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:30,130
and so we each had to write an
index card saying why we w you know,

1061
01:06:30,131 --> 01:06:32,860
why we wanted to audit. So we
did. And then we went away.

1062
01:06:32,861 --> 01:06:36,670
And later that day I was lamenting to
my friend that there was no way that I

1063
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:40,900
would ever get the spot. And my
friend said, don't you know anything,

1064
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:44,500
don't you know anything about academics?
And I was like, I don't, I don't tell me.

1065
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:46,211
And she said,

1066
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:50,980
you need to write him right now and say
that he needs to give you this precisely

1067
01:06:50,981 --> 01:06:55,420
because you are a cook and you
will bring a different, you know,

1068
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:58,630
you will bring a different viewpoint into
this class and the conversations will

1069
01:06:58,631 --> 01:07:01,030
be different because you're
from the inside of this world.

1070
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:02,500
Because the class was about,

1071
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:05,380
it's called following the food chain
and it was about the food industry.

1072
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:09,820
And so I did that even though it felt
so wrong to write to Michael Pollan and

1073
01:07:09,821 --> 01:07:12,190
tell him that what he needed to do,
you know,

1074
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:17,470
like from, you know, some 23 year old
or whatever. I Dunno, I would hold,

1075
01:07:17,471 --> 01:07:22,240
I was 29 maybe. But, um, so I did. And he,

1076
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:25,660
he was like, okay. Like it
was so simple and we're like,

1077
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:28,420
you know,
I asked,

1078
01:07:28,421 --> 01:07:32,230
I did the thing that I was so scared to
do and I asked and then that led to me

1079
01:07:32,231 --> 01:07:33,370
auditing this class,

1080
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:38,590
which ended up being a really
incredible and pivotal moment for me.

1081
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:42,310
But I, I don't know that I could've
put my finger on at that time.

1082
01:07:42,311 --> 01:07:45,850
But now I look back at it
and it's not only when I got,

1083
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:50,400
got to work with Michael and what led
to, you know, us working together, um,

1084
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,500
on writing and cooking,
but also I am,

1085
01:07:53,501 --> 01:07:58,030
became part of an incredible community
of journalists and writers and which is a

1086
01:07:58,031 --> 01:07:59,710
thing I had always wanted by then.

1087
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:04,240
I had a really vast network of
cooking people and I was part of a,

1088
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:05,890
an incredible cooking world,

1089
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:10,600
but I didn't have a community at
all to support me as a writer.

1090
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:13,840
I didn't know what a pitch was.
I didn't know anything about writing.

1091
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:17,870
I didn't know articles are
measured in words, you know,
I didn't know any of that.

1092
01:08:17,871 --> 01:08:20,660
So I learned a lot of that,
not only from that class,

1093
01:08:20,661 --> 01:08:24,080
but also just from being around these
people and having peers who I could ask

1094
01:08:24,081 --> 01:08:27,670
all these questions of. And now
I work in an office, you know,

1095
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:31,760
shared writing space with so many of
those people I've gone on to collaborate

1096
01:08:31,761 --> 01:08:33,980
with them. We, you know, they're,

1097
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:38,360
they're my community who I am
constantly sort of reaching out to.

1098
01:08:38,361 --> 01:08:40,400
And now I'm able to
support in my own ways.

1099
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:45,500
And so that was a really
important thing that I asked for.

1100
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:50,370
Well, let's, let's look at the nitty
gritty of that. So you start with a,

1101
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:55,210
a note in the restaurant that says,
I'm your biggest fan.

1102
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:00,910
Can I audit your class? It w. W. W were
there any other ingredients in that note?

1103
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:02,620
I'm going to, I'm going
to hit, I'm going to hit,

1104
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:06,570
oh, it was a card. So it wasn't,
I remember that it was a card.

1105
01:09:06,571 --> 01:09:10,200
It was not like a letter on paper that
was folded card. Like hallmark card.

1106
01:09:10,201 --> 01:09:13,080
Are we talking about business
cards? Yeah. Like I went to the,

1107
01:09:13,081 --> 01:09:15,540
I think because on the street
where that restaurant was,

1108
01:09:15,541 --> 01:09:18,990
there was a couple of stationary stores.
So I think I bought a card, like a, yeah,

1109
01:09:18,991 --> 01:09:23,160
like a Ho, like some sort of greeting
card. So I, it wasn't so long.

1110
01:09:23,161 --> 01:09:25,790
Whatever I wrote, I think I just,
I think really it said like,

1111
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:30,480
my name is [inaudible]. I'm
a huge fan of yours. Um,

1112
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:36,000
I have always wanted to write. I really
would like to call it at your class.

1113
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:40,260
Um, it would be so mean. It would be,
it would mean so much to me. I mean,

1114
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,420
they're honestly, I don't know why.
There's no reason why Michael Pollan,

1115
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:47,960
I'm not sure you're giving yourself
enough credit. So that's, that's,

1116
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,710
that's part one, part two.
He, he writes you back,

1117
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:53,760
you show up.

1118
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:59,160
It's like the gladiatorial games with
200 competitors and you write in the next

1119
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:02,370
card. Do you remember any of
what you put on the index card?

1120
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:06,040
I don't. Oh man, I
don't remember that. No.

1121
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:12,440
So then your friend says,
Hey, don't you know anything
about academics? No, I don't.

1122
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:17,480
Just tell me you need to write this.
And so you send this followup email.

1123
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:21,110
Do you remember like subject line?

1124
01:10:21,111 --> 01:10:23,060
Anything else that you put in that email?

1125
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:28,590
Uh, no. Should I see if it's
in my, I don't know if I
had this email address then

1126
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,400
I search for my oldest emailed him.
I bond right now.

1127
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:35,560
Well, you know what, we
could, we could look at it, we
could, uh, I could look it up.

1128
01:10:35,850 --> 01:10:37,930
You get it to me later and I can,
if you find it,

1129
01:10:37,931 --> 01:10:39,340
I'll put it in the show notes for people.

1130
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:44,190
I think the thing for me is that
I know that I'm very verbose,

1131
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:49,050
so anytime I sit down to ask
for something, I think, um,

1132
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:52,560
and I intuitively knew this before
and now I know it really clearly and

1133
01:10:52,561 --> 01:10:54,360
articulate it to myself and other people,

1134
01:10:54,361 --> 01:10:57,630
which is like if you're writing an email
to somebody to ask them for something,

1135
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:02,330
just get to it, you know, don't
beat around the bush. And so and so.

1136
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:05,440
I don't need your whole backstory.
Like I don't need the booboo booboo.

1137
01:11:05,441 --> 01:11:06,750
We would just like say the thing.

1138
01:11:06,990 --> 01:11:11,730
So I'm pretty sure I did that one pretty
tightly because we were already in this

1139
01:11:11,731 --> 01:11:13,370
conversation and

1140
01:11:14,110 --> 01:11:16,120
me and the class,
because I'll bring,

1141
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:19,060
yeah, because I'm broke
and I have this, you know,

1142
01:11:19,061 --> 01:11:22,060
and I work in the sustainable
food world and I'm going to bring,

1143
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:24,970
because what he had told me,
I sort of glossed over this before,

1144
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:28,600
but what he had told me when I had come
to his office hours before I went to

1145
01:11:28,601 --> 01:11:30,460
that first day of class was he said,
listen,

1146
01:11:30,461 --> 01:11:34,240
I know you want to take this class but
it's never going to happen because I have

1147
01:11:34,241 --> 01:11:37,900
obligations to a long list of people.
And you're at the very end of that list.

1148
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:42,460
Because first my obligations are to the
students of this graduate school and

1149
01:11:42,461 --> 01:11:46,420
then of the other graduate schools of UC
Berkeley and then to the undergraduates

1150
01:11:46,421 --> 01:11:48,670
of UC Berkeley and then the community.

1151
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:53,940
And so there are so many other like
paying students ahead of you that you are

1152
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,730
low priority to me.
I mean he didn't do it in a mean way,

1153
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,780
but it was just like he was telling
me, telling me what it was. And so,

1154
01:12:01,781 --> 01:12:05,680
but he was like, but if you want, you
can come to to this day. So I did,

1155
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:09,370
I saw it in action.
The fact that there were so many people,

1156
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,390
I also think he's a softie at heart even
though he's like comes across as a rule

1157
01:12:13,391 --> 01:12:16,630
follower. So even though there were only
supposed to be 12 people in that class,

1158
01:12:16,631 --> 01:12:21,550
I think there ended up being 15
of us, you know, and so, so, um,

1159
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:23,680
but,
but yeah,

1160
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:28,090
I don't think if I had not followed
up with that email and, and said,

1161
01:12:28,450 --> 01:12:28,871
listen,

1162
01:12:28,871 --> 01:12:33,400
like you need me precisely because I'm
not one of those people further up on

1163
01:12:33,401 --> 01:12:37,480
this list. Um, that, that,
that was why, you know,

1164
01:12:37,481 --> 01:12:42,100
I was so enthusiastic and in,
in sort of since the class,

1165
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:44,050
like during the class and since the class,

1166
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:47,950
it became really apparent that
I did do it precisely that,

1167
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:51,880
that I did bring a viewpoint that
nobody else in that room could have.

1168
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:54,730
And I helped arrange for us a field trip,
you know,

1169
01:12:54,731 --> 01:12:58,840
to this like wackadoodle sustainable farm.
And there were ways where,

1170
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:01,990
because I had an insider's perspective,

1171
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:06,310
I could connect other students with like
the kinds of stories that they probably

1172
01:13:06,311 --> 01:13:09,730
wouldn't be able to find on their own
because I was living it, you know,

1173
01:13:09,731 --> 01:13:14,080
and immersed in it. So I don't
think he regrets it. I hope not.

1174
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:15,461
So we're talking,

1175
01:13:15,461 --> 01:13:20,461
we're talking about a writer who's had
a big influence on your writing your

1176
01:13:21,371 --> 01:13:22,204
career.

1177
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:27,310
Let's backstep for a second to two
books that have had a big impact on you.

1178
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:31,390
And, uh, in the course
of doing my, my homework,

1179
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:32,830
I don't know when this came about,

1180
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:35,800
but you can't believe everything
you read on the Internet,

1181
01:13:35,801 --> 01:13:37,460
so feel free to correct.
Okay.

1182
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:40,960
But a list of books that the
shape and he's chefs gave you,

1183
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:44,190
or was this something that
came up and then there were,

1184
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:49,060
there were a few folks who came up,
I guess, uh, Marcel has on patients.

1185
01:13:49,061 --> 01:13:50,230
Gray could,

1186
01:13:50,231 --> 01:13:55,231
could you describe how that
list got to you and what were,

1187
01:13:57,220 --> 01:13:59,680
what were some of the books on that
list that had a big impact on you?

1188
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:03,300
For sure. I mean, those are also
just cookbooks. So I have other,

1189
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,140
other books I can talk about too. If
you want both. Both. Let's do both

1190
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:09,260
then you can do in,
in whatever order you like.

1191
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:10,840
Yeah.
But in terms of the,

1192
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:15,880
that have been deeply formative
I think I don't before.

1193
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:19,090
So one of the incredible things
about [inaudible] is that,

1194
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:21,880
and this is absolutely
comes from Alice and the,

1195
01:14:21,881 --> 01:14:26,881
and the world that she's created
is she is an artist above all else.

1196
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:32,010
And so she really surrounds herself with
deeply creative people and artists of

1197
01:14:32,231 --> 01:14:33,310
all different kinds.

1198
01:14:33,311 --> 01:14:38,311
And so food is just one part of this
lifestyle that she really tries to create

1199
01:14:39,821 --> 01:14:43,220
and teach people and
immerse people in. And, um,

1200
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:46,420
so beautiful writing
is a big part of that.

1201
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:51,810
And I think I had a pretty limited
exposure to cook books before I came to

1202
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:58,120
[inaudible] where I just knew them as
the thing that you look up the recipe in

1203
01:14:58,121 --> 01:14:59,020
to make for dinner.

1204
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:04,060
And so when I begged the chefs
there to teach me how to cook,

1205
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:07,570
you know, and just to like set
the scene at the time was about,

1206
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,210
I think this was 2000,
um,

1207
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:13,070
the restaurant kept winning,
you know,

1208
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:15,460
best restaurant in America
from Gourmet magazine,

1209
01:15:15,461 --> 01:15:19,750
which at the time was like the biggest
sort of, um, award of its type.

1210
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:22,970
And so it really,
if there,

1211
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:27,550
there was no reason for these chefs to
let me into the kitchen. There was a line,

1212
01:15:27,551 --> 01:15:32,551
a mile long of much more experienced
people than me trying to get this job.

1213
01:15:32,801 --> 01:15:36,460
And I knew that and they knew that.
Everyone knew that. And so, um,

1214
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:37,850
I knew nothing and I,

1215
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:42,730
all I had was my enthusiasm really and
my dedication and like my work ethic.

1216
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:43,800
So I,

1217
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:48,860
I asked the chefs what I needed to do
in order to earn an unpaid apprentice

1218
01:15:49,051 --> 01:15:53,710
ship. Like if that's what I was
competing for. And, and they said,

1219
01:15:53,711 --> 01:15:55,570
you need to cook every day.

1220
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,120
You need to watch these cooks
everyday day you're here,

1221
01:15:58,121 --> 01:16:01,780
you need to learn how to taste and develop
your palette and you need to go home.

1222
01:16:01,781 --> 01:16:05,440
And read all these books and they gave
me a stack of like probably 30 bucks.

1223
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:07,540
I mean,
they didn't actually give me the books.

1224
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:10,090
They told me about 30 bucks to read.
And so they're like,

1225
01:16:10,091 --> 01:16:13,270
these are the books that are the
shape and east canon and things like.

1226
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:16,540
There were books, there were books
unlike anything I had ever seen.

1227
01:16:16,541 --> 01:16:19,740
So patients gray, who
was an incredible, um,

1228
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:24,070
incredible writer in the mid century
who traveled with her husband throughout

1229
01:16:24,071 --> 01:16:26,470
like Turkey and Greece and Italy.

1230
01:16:26,471 --> 01:16:30,670
And Spain wrote this beautiful book called
the hunting from a weed that is just,

1231
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:35,590
it's like a poem. And yes,
there are recipes with like
cups and measures in there,

1232
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:39,400
but there is just a way that
sort of one country to the next,

1233
01:16:39,401 --> 01:16:44,401
she connects all these dots and it's
so beautiful and moving and it's,

1234
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:50,220
it's put together writing and food in
a way unlike I had ever seen before.

1235
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:55,450
And so that was a really, really formative
book for me. There was another one,

1236
01:16:55,451 --> 01:16:57,460
kind of in the same vein called,
um,

1237
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:02,500
the [inaudible] bears of the flowering
hearth by a person named Roy Andrews.

1238
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:05,860
De Groot, I think it's his pen
name. And this, this one was a,

1239
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:08,800
like if a novel met a cookbook kind of,

1240
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:13,070
because it was an imaginary world that
this guy had sort of created about this

1241
01:17:13,071 --> 01:17:14,030
like Magical,

1242
01:17:14,031 --> 01:17:18,130
oh bears somewhere in the mountains and B,

1243
01:17:18,970 --> 01:17:21,260
which is like a,
like a,

1244
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:25,100
like a mountain hotels
somewhere in France. Yeah.

1245
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:31,010
And so, um, and a mountain
in a country in I guess like,

1246
01:17:31,011 --> 01:17:32,000
uh,
you know,

1247
01:17:32,001 --> 01:17:37,001
and so there were just these kind of
like beautiful narratives that were

1248
01:17:37,191 --> 01:17:42,140
intertwined in talking about food
that were so moving to me. Um,

1249
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:45,540
and then there were the basic cookbooks
that I had to learn, you know,

1250
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:50,090
history and tradition and
culture from things like, um,

1251
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,350
Richard old knees writing and yeah.

1252
01:17:53,530 --> 01:17:56,840
Martella Hassan and S.
Oh gosh.

1253
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:59,950
I mean all of the shape
and ees books. So, um,

1254
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:05,050
it was really a kind of a world that I
had never been exposed to because we at

1255
01:18:05,421 --> 01:18:06,950
my house had,
um,

1256
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:10,760
growing up we had two Persian
cookbooks are culinary tradition,

1257
01:18:10,761 --> 01:18:12,080
was entirely oral.

1258
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:16,100
And then we had like a sesame street
cookbook that had a banana bread recipe

1259
01:18:16,101 --> 01:18:18,530
that I used to make when I was little.
And that was about it.

1260
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,920
There was not this like deep tradition
of cookbooks that I grew up around.

1261
01:18:21,921 --> 01:18:26,870
So this was a really moving an
influential thing for me. And then,

1262
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:31,490
um, yeah, writing wise
I have read, I mean,

1263
01:18:31,491 --> 01:18:36,320
so many, I read so much
nonfiction. I mean, I love, love,

1264
01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:40,820
love John McPhee. I love, love. Yeah.

1265
01:18:40,821 --> 01:18:44,060
I mean to me I've learned so much
about structure from John McPhee.

1266
01:18:44,061 --> 01:18:48,230
So do you have a favorite one or two
favorites filled levels of the game

1267
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:53,870
to all people? If you read the book
description, people who are like,

1268
01:18:53,871 --> 01:18:57,110
what's an entire book on a
single tennis match? Trust me.

1269
01:18:57,830 --> 01:19:02,690
And trust is so good. It's so good.
And it really taught me that, you know,

1270
01:19:02,691 --> 01:19:04,670
there was a period where I was like,
maybe I write my book,

1271
01:19:04,671 --> 01:19:07,610
like the levels of the game and I
find a way to tell a story. You know,

1272
01:19:07,611 --> 01:19:12,140
there's just, he is a master of
structure and I find, you know,

1273
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:16,850
I for me a challenge as a writer and
also as as now just like a creative

1274
01:19:16,851 --> 01:19:17,600
thinker,

1275
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:22,600
probably one of the most thrilling
things for me that I am so excited by,

1276
01:19:23,151 --> 01:19:28,060
but also to intimidated by his coming up
with structure for things. And so, and,

1277
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:32,030
and in being in search of
always like the simplest,

1278
01:19:32,031 --> 01:19:37,031
most elegant structure and I feel like
you can convey information so much more

1279
01:19:38,001 --> 01:19:41,020
clearly when a structure,
um,

1280
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:46,580
is right and, and simple, you
know, and so, and it's fun.

1281
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:47,331
It's a fun practice.

1282
01:19:47,331 --> 01:19:50,960
Right now I'm figuring out like if I'm
going to do another show and I've, and,

1283
01:19:50,961 --> 01:19:55,910
or another book and I think I figured out
an idea. And so now I'm just like, okay,

1284
01:19:55,911 --> 01:20:00,140
how do I structure it? So it's just
that kind of stuff where I, I love,

1285
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,480
I love those.
And very randomly,

1286
01:20:02,481 --> 01:20:05,600
this book I saw one day at a
store when I was struggling,

1287
01:20:05,690 --> 01:20:10,290
like on the 900th the draft of my own
book and it has been so meaningful and

1288
01:20:10,291 --> 01:20:10,921
moving to me.

1289
01:20:10,921 --> 01:20:15,150
It's called several short sentences
on writing and it's by a writer named

1290
01:20:15,151 --> 01:20:17,370
Verilyn Klinkenborg who teaches at Yale.

1291
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:20,460
And he used to have a column in the
New York Times, I think it was called,

1292
01:20:20,461 --> 01:20:23,820
like on rural living where,
and he's written about writing.

1293
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:29,000
And the entire point of this whole small
book is make your sentences shorter and

1294
01:20:30,031 --> 01:20:31,770
it really is so good.

1295
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:37,360
If one is to look at your bio,
it's a very impressive bio,

1296
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:40,480
right being called the next Julia Child
by empires, all things considered,

1297
01:20:40,481 --> 01:20:43,480
you're in New York Times best selling
author, you have this TV show,

1298
01:20:43,481 --> 01:20:48,481
you have all of these various accolades
and I think it's easy for someone

1299
01:20:49,481 --> 01:20:53,140
perhaps to look at that be
very intimidated and uh,

1300
01:20:53,141 --> 01:20:58,060
assume that you've just been getting
up at bat and hitting home runs,

1301
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:02,020
uh, since, since, since you
began one after the other.

1302
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:04,210
So if you'd be open to it,

1303
01:21:04,211 --> 01:21:08,260
I'd love to talk about failures,

1304
01:21:08,261 --> 01:21:12,010
whether those are failures, failures
that set you up for later success.

1305
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:15,790
And of course those people who've read
Trump's mentors will recognize this

1306
01:21:15,791 --> 01:21:17,290
question or heard the podcast.

1307
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:21,160
I like to ask this question in
terms of like a favorite failures,

1308
01:21:21,161 --> 01:21:24,310
past failures that really taught you
something that seemed like a failure,

1309
01:21:24,311 --> 01:21:27,250
but in fact if they hadn't
happened something else,

1310
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,960
which was a success wouldn't
have happened later.

1311
01:21:29,620 --> 01:21:32,010
Can you give us any examples that sa

1312
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:39,170
there's so many options here.
Um, yeah. I mean I was just,

1313
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:43,010
I was thinking, you know, I
came really close to writing to,

1314
01:21:43,011 --> 01:21:47,910
to cowriting two other books before
I ended up writing my own book.

1315
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:50,400
And though neither of those felt right,

1316
01:21:50,401 --> 01:21:54,270
but I was just so desperate to work on
a book that I almost did those ones.

1317
01:21:54,271 --> 01:21:57,960
And I kind of messed up both of those
opportunities and I felt really bad.

1318
01:21:57,990 --> 01:22:00,510
Like I would never get an
opportunity to write my own book.

1319
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:04,980
And if I had done those, I don't think
that I, how did you mess them up?

1320
01:22:04,981 --> 01:22:07,160
If you don't mind me? Um, well, um,

1321
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:10,920
well the one that I can
remember more clearly was, um,

1322
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:13,960
it was going to be a book about pickle and

1323
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:19,920
specific it was going to be a book about
pickling and I was going to do it with

1324
01:22:19,921 --> 01:22:24,150
a friend and there was a way where I,
um,

1325
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:29,820
we met with this agent of book literary
agent who had brought the idea to her.

1326
01:22:30,330 --> 01:22:34,710
And, um, sometimes I just
didn't, I don't know,

1327
01:22:34,711 --> 01:22:38,430
I couldn't have put my finger on it, but
to me at that time I was like an agent,

1328
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:43,020
like that's a high powered, you know what
I mean? Only fancy people have agents.

1329
01:22:43,021 --> 01:22:46,710
And so I felt like I needed to prove
myself to this agent and there was

1330
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:47,670
something about like,

1331
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:50,660
our relationship just didn't feel
right and I don't know that I,

1332
01:22:50,661 --> 01:22:54,500
I don't think I trusted her
completely and I felt really, um,

1333
01:22:55,380 --> 01:23:00,120
kind of put down by her. It just
didn't feel very good. And so I think,

1334
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:03,450
I can't, this was so long ago, I
can't remember exactly what happened,

1335
01:23:03,451 --> 01:23:08,200
but I think I like inelegantly
extracted myself from that.

1336
01:23:08,201 --> 01:23:09,610
Like I had committed to it and then I,

1337
01:23:09,611 --> 01:23:13,750
and committed because I just didn't
feel like it was the right thing.

1338
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:15,910
And then I just worried like,
oh no,

1339
01:23:15,911 --> 01:23:19,120
does this mean I'll never find an
agent or I'll never get to do a book.

1340
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:23,140
So that was one I'm trying to remember.
And then,

1341
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:28,000
um, then, oh, there was actually another,

1342
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:32,050
another age man, I have like really have
like a trail of burnt agents behind me.

1343
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:32,650
Um,

1344
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:37,650
there was another agent
who came to me and um,

1345
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:39,160
and again,

1346
01:23:39,161 --> 01:23:43,330
she made me feel like I needed to prove
myself to her and that my ideas weren't

1347
01:23:43,331 --> 01:23:47,620
that good. And I had this one idea
and she didn't want me to do that.

1348
01:23:47,621 --> 01:23:51,670
And she found me.

1349
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:56,990
I used to do these dinners,
uh,

1350
01:23:57,150 --> 01:24:00,430
at tartine bakery in San Francisco,
which is its own cult place.

1351
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:04,300
And so because of that, these
dinners that I had, it was called 13,

1352
01:24:04,301 --> 01:24:08,080
after hours became like this other,
it became a little cult thing.

1353
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:11,860
And so in a very small world,
it was a very popular thing.

1354
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:17,350
And so I think she sort of was in that
world. And so she found me through that.

1355
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:20,710
And um,
there was just a way,

1356
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:24,460
I think what it was was I,
yeah,

1357
01:24:24,461 --> 01:24:26,260
I've never actually spent
the time to think about it,

1358
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:29,920
but in both of those situations,
the relationships,

1359
01:24:29,921 --> 01:24:33,490
the fundamental primary relationship,
which at that time was with the agent,

1360
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:37,840
like it wasn't so much with an editor
yet or anything. It just was so, um,

1361
01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:39,220
on uneven ground.

1362
01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:44,050
And it was this thing where I was
struggling to prove myself as a creative

1363
01:24:44,051 --> 01:24:47,830
thinker to them. And um, it was just,

1364
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:52,860
I didn't very much feel supported and
that is not a great place for me or maybe

1365
01:24:54,791 --> 01:24:58,540
for anyone from which to
do your best creative work.

1366
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:03,270
I've learned that for
sure in my career now as,

1367
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,710
as a writer whose worked with so
many different kinds of editors.

1368
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:10,980
Like my current editing situation at the
Time magazine is so wonderful because

1369
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:12,993
my editor,

1370
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,410
I love her so much and she knows
exactly how they lay it to me.

1371
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,870
Like she tells it to me straight,
you know,

1372
01:25:19,871 --> 01:25:22,180
she knows how to give me a
smack down when I need it.

1373
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:25,750
But she also is so kind and supportive.

1374
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:30,100
And so there's just this very fundamental
trust that we have where I used to

1375
01:25:30,101 --> 01:25:32,800
turn stuff into her every,
every month, my column.

1376
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:37,990
And I would have like a one page apology
that I would write this like college,

1377
01:25:37,991 --> 01:25:41,230
email the fort with the, with
each draft. And she was like,

1378
01:25:41,231 --> 01:25:44,260
you have to stop sending these apologies.
This is insane.

1379
01:25:44,261 --> 01:25:46,660
Like you're doing your best.
I know you're doing your best.

1380
01:25:46,661 --> 01:25:48,520
I also know you're not
going to phone it in.

1381
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:52,630
And also the stuff you're turning in
is not bad. So stop apologizing. So,

1382
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:55,060
but I had sort of,
um,

1383
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:58,390
there's just been all so many
different experiences I've had where,

1384
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:02,800
where I have been made to feel like I'm
dumb or I'm not trying hard enough and I

1385
01:26:02,801 --> 01:26:04,790
actually, I'm trying so hard, you know?

1386
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:08,990
And so I now have learned
from my own self that I, I,

1387
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:14,080
I need to be smarter and very careful
about what kind of creative collaborations

1388
01:26:14,661 --> 01:26:19,661
I enter because I need a kind of a
relationship that's vulnerable and open.

1389
01:26:20,031 --> 01:26:21,950
And it's not that I don't want criticism.

1390
01:26:21,951 --> 01:26:25,250
I actually do want your criticism
because I do want to make it better,

1391
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:27,980
but how do you convey that to me,
you know,

1392
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:33,350
and also do we have a fundamental trust
between the two of us that were both,

1393
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:33,711
you know,

1394
01:26:33,711 --> 01:26:38,711
that we both are aiming
toward the same goal of,

1395
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:43,590
you know, making the best
possible thing. So I think, ah,

1396
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:47,890
I don't know. I, sorry, I've completely
veered away from your original question,

1397
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:50,480
but I'll be,
I'll be the guide rails.

1398
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:57,290
I want to actually hone in on something
that you said about your editor at the

1399
01:26:57,361 --> 01:26:59,580
Times who can deliver the smack down,

1400
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:04,581
but do so with a delivery that you find
very palatable that you do want the

1401
01:27:04,681 --> 01:27:05,520
criticism,
but it's a,

1402
01:27:05,521 --> 01:27:09,570
it's a question of it being constructive
and delivered in the right way.

1403
01:27:09,571 --> 01:27:12,520
Can you give any examples of,

1404
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:16,070
of how that editor might
deliver criticism or it can,

1405
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:21,080
it can be a hypothetical made up example
or just what makes it so walk that,

1406
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:27,570
uh, you know, thread the needle of
being both affective criticism but,

1407
01:27:27,630 --> 01:27:31,020
but not making you
defensive or deflating you?

1408
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:35,960
Um, yeah. I wish I had
a very specific example,

1409
01:27:35,961 --> 01:27:40,700
but I can set the emotional tone of it,
which is that there is, we have developed,

1410
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:43,340
I mean it's been over a year now
that we're in constant contact.

1411
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:48,341
So we have at this point developed an
understanding that I know that she wants

1412
01:27:48,621 --> 01:27:51,950
the best for me and she knows
that I'm always gonna do my best.

1413
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:56,210
And so if she tells me something,
even in shorthand sometimes,

1414
01:27:56,211 --> 01:27:58,370
now she does this thing where
she just writes, do better.

1415
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:04,100
And so now I know, okay, like that's a
phrase that I need to do better, you know,

1416
01:28:04,101 --> 01:28:04,940
or it's not working.

1417
01:28:04,941 --> 01:28:09,740
Like I think so much of it isn't an
emotion as like a fundamental, um, um,

1418
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:13,400
the emotional work that we had done
earlier and that had come through these

1419
01:28:13,401 --> 01:28:16,940
vulnerable exchanges where I, where
I had said to her, I'm really sorry.

1420
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:18,950
And she said, listen, I
know you're doing your best.

1421
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:23,210
So once I was able to trust her
in that way, I think I have,

1422
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:25,760
I've let go of a lot of the defensiveness.

1423
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:27,800
I'm trying to think of some of the early,

1424
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:32,960
she was a lot more gentle in the beginning
and I think that had a lot to do with

1425
01:28:32,961 --> 01:28:34,670
it.
She was very gentle and she would,

1426
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,810
she would sort of write out more complete
sentences about why something was

1427
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:40,850
overexplaining or,

1428
01:28:41,930 --> 01:28:46,400
or maybe like tube too, I don't
know, snobby or whatever. She,

1429
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:51,520
so I think she really did
the work initially to allow
me to trust her and feel

1430
01:28:51,681 --> 01:28:55,490
safe with her. And then that now we
have a such a nice shorthand where like,

1431
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:58,220
I can just be like, can you just
do this, you know, or whatever.

1432
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:02,560
Yeah. I'll keep it short and sweet.
Before, before you came to writing though,

1433
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:06,570
we've talked about the cowriting,
uh,

1434
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:10,680
opportunities which did not manifest or
that you extricated yourself from and

1435
01:29:10,681 --> 01:29:13,260
then ultimately having
the opportunity to do,

1436
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:15,360
to write the type of book
that you want to write it.

1437
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:20,390
Do you have any failures or missteps
from what proceeded that I assume or,

1438
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:26,580
yeah, like the, uh, from the culinary
world or restaurant world or otherwise?

1439
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:31,460
Yes. So many. I mean, I would say the
two biggest failures of my career,

1440
01:29:31,730 --> 01:29:34,370
our culinary, um, and they,

1441
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:37,310
they sit and beautiful
contrast to one another.

1442
01:29:37,670 --> 01:29:42,440
So one of them was I helped
run a restaurant for five
years that was struggling

1443
01:29:42,441 --> 01:29:45,960
financially the whole
time it existed. And, um,

1444
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:51,230
there was a way where it
was not my restaurant. I was
helping my mentor run it.

1445
01:29:51,231 --> 01:29:54,440
I felt very loyal to him. And in
the beginning I had, you know,

1446
01:29:54,441 --> 01:29:59,090
like restaurants are often, um, lose
money for up to five years, you know,

1447
01:29:59,091 --> 01:30:03,670
before they sort of hit.
It's a, it's really just a
terrible financial models. So,

1448
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:05,470
so there's a way where like they,

1449
01:30:05,471 --> 01:30:08,900
they often lose money for a long time
before they sort of hit steady ground.

1450
01:30:08,901 --> 01:30:13,070
And we actually hit steady ground
after three years. But then in 2008,

1451
01:30:13,071 --> 01:30:13,970
the economy crashed.

1452
01:30:14,330 --> 01:30:16,850
And so it was sort of just this
thing where we weren't going to,

1453
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:20,000
we knew we were never going to make it
okay. And there were a lot of sort of,

1454
01:30:20,001 --> 01:30:21,350
I think community,

1455
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:25,070
there was a culture issue
in that restaurant that um,

1456
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:30,670
now with so many years of distance I can
see it was almost insurmountable and,

1457
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:34,990
and if a culture and a place
isn't sort of support there,

1458
01:30:34,991 --> 01:30:37,850
it's really hard to turn the
culture of a place around I think.

1459
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:42,260
And so in some ways to me
I was ready to like cut it,

1460
01:30:42,261 --> 01:30:45,140
call it quits after three years,
but for my mentor,

1461
01:30:45,141 --> 01:30:48,260
this was like his big shot that his
career had been working, you know,

1462
01:30:48,290 --> 01:30:51,640
aiming toward and he wasn't
ready to give up. So I,

1463
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:56,700
I stayed for two years longer than I
wanted to and I was really unhappy.

1464
01:30:56,931 --> 01:31:00,920
I was really unhealthy, like
just physically at really. Um,

1465
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:05,870
I feel like it took a toll on my adrenal
system. I had a really bad temper.

1466
01:31:05,930 --> 01:31:07,430
This was right, you know, write book.

1467
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:11,120
This was eventually like led to the
breakdown that led me going to therapy.

1468
01:31:11,121 --> 01:31:13,100
Like I was emotionally just out of touch.

1469
01:31:13,101 --> 01:31:16,970
I was not that kind to the people
who worked for me. It was not great.

1470
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:18,530
It was not my greatest hour.

1471
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:23,890
And so I think staying through something
and feeling how bad that made me feel,

1472
01:31:25,431 --> 01:31:30,270
how bad it made other people feel and
that it ultimately sort of fizzled to the

1473
01:31:30,271 --> 01:31:30,951
slow,

1474
01:31:30,951 --> 01:31:35,951
painful death really taught me that I
don't ever want to be part of that kind of

1475
01:31:37,401 --> 01:31:41,480
situation again. Like I want to be the
one calling, calling quits, you know,

1476
01:31:41,481 --> 01:31:44,450
I want to be the one who like
determines the end of a story.

1477
01:31:44,780 --> 01:31:48,020
And when I think about it, you
know, in any creative project,

1478
01:31:48,021 --> 01:31:52,490
which even or business probably in some
ways a business is not so different from

1479
01:31:52,491 --> 01:31:56,510
a creative project. Like things have a
beginning, a middle and an end. You know,

1480
01:31:56,511 --> 01:32:00,550
like even when people sit down to
write a movie, to write a series,

1481
01:32:00,551 --> 01:32:04,690
even if you want to pitch
a TV series, um, you know,

1482
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:08,560
an ideal life span for a TV
series is five to seven years.

1483
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:12,610
And so before you even start, you know
how the series is going to end, right?

1484
01:32:12,611 --> 01:32:16,450
Like there's a way where
it's not a bad idea.

1485
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:18,760
An ending is not necessarily a failure.

1486
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:23,500
And so I really got to put
that into practice a couple
of years later when after

1487
01:32:23,501 --> 01:32:24,311
the restaurant closed,

1488
01:32:24,311 --> 01:32:29,311
I started this like kind of small food
market that immediately became a huge

1489
01:32:29,681 --> 01:32:34,330
success and got so much media
attention and all of a sudden was um,

1490
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:38,560
I started it because I just missed
cooking for people and I wanted to cook a

1491
01:32:38,561 --> 01:32:42,340
little bit in my spare time while I
was figuring out how to be a writer.

1492
01:32:42,670 --> 01:32:46,260
And then all of a sudden all of
my time and resources and energy,

1493
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:48,460
we're going toward
running this food market.

1494
01:32:48,461 --> 01:32:51,130
That wasn't even the main thing I
wanted to accomplish in my life.

1495
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:56,260
And so even as it grew and we got more
followers and more customers and we're

1496
01:32:56,261 --> 01:33:00,280
making more money or whatever,
I knew that it wasn't what I wanted to do.

1497
01:33:00,310 --> 01:33:03,190
So instead of letting
that also fizzle out,

1498
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:07,900
I ended after two years and people
really wanted like all the food media was

1499
01:33:07,901 --> 01:33:12,040
like, what's the gossip? Why
is this closing? I was like,

1500
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:14,140
it's not closing. You
know, nothing's wrong.

1501
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:17,380
Like I'm just closing it cause I
want to do something else. And so

1502
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:22,980
sudden easy decision, a hard decision. I
like walk us through, I don't know the,

1503
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:27,210
the, the like the weeks before
making it official. This is

1504
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:32,890
okay. Yeah. So, so, so I knew in,

1505
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:37,900
in one way it wasn't easy decision because
my gut told me that I didn't want to

1506
01:33:38,301 --> 01:33:41,000
do it.
In practical terms,

1507
01:33:41,001 --> 01:33:44,840
it was much more difficult because
there were a lot of people who I felt

1508
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:49,400
responsible to who relied on this
market for their income. And so, and,

1509
01:33:49,430 --> 01:33:51,530
or they thought they relied on
the market for their income.

1510
01:33:51,890 --> 01:33:55,640
And so there was a story that we all
were telling about how important to this

1511
01:33:55,641 --> 01:33:58,970
market was in all of these people's lives.
And I feel,

1512
01:33:58,971 --> 01:34:00,680
I have very maternal instincts.

1513
01:34:00,681 --> 01:34:05,070
Like I feel a lot of responsibility
for the community that I create and,

1514
01:34:05,190 --> 01:34:08,570
and to them. And so if
anything, I want to,

1515
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:13,100
I felt a need to stay for them
rather than for myself. And,

1516
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:17,990
um, and that was really brutal. And around
this time I was like really into yoga,

1517
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:21,950
like super into yoga and,
and when you go to yoga class,

1518
01:34:21,951 --> 01:34:24,650
like often what they talk
about is setting an intention.

1519
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:27,980
And so I was really like doing
a lot of yoga talk and um,

1520
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:33,370
and I had this thing where I realized
that because my career was so a morphous

1521
01:34:35,031 --> 01:34:39,740
because there wasn't some like other
person on whose career I was modeling my

1522
01:34:39,741 --> 01:34:44,540
own, there wasn't an easy way for me to
know that I was moving. I don't know,

1523
01:34:44,570 --> 01:34:48,200
in the right direction toward anything
I wanted to actually accomplish. Right.

1524
01:34:48,201 --> 01:34:50,810
There weren't like these landmarks of
like, when you want to be a doctor,

1525
01:34:50,811 --> 01:34:54,140
you do this, this and this and this. When
you want to be a lawyer, you do this,

1526
01:34:54,141 --> 01:34:56,990
this and this. And so I didn't
have that. So how did I,

1527
01:34:57,350 --> 01:35:02,210
I was on the right track to where I
wanted to go and I really started to hone

1528
01:35:02,211 --> 01:35:07,000
this thing for myself, which was, well
since I don't know where my ultimate, um,

1529
01:35:07,610 --> 01:35:11,120
ending point is,
are my ultimate goal is I,

1530
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:16,180
what I do know is that it's a feeling I
have a feeling in my belly that I want

1531
01:35:17,330 --> 01:35:19,010
to work toward and so,

1532
01:35:19,070 --> 01:35:23,450
and that and that when an opportunity
comes to me or a professional decision

1533
01:35:23,451 --> 01:35:24,284
comes to me,

1534
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:29,650
I can think about it in terms of
if I say yes or no to this thing,

1535
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:35,020
will it take me closer to or farther away
from this feeling that I tried to feel

1536
01:35:35,931 --> 01:35:37,250
and also create in the world.

1537
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:42,500
And so probably the biggest conflict in
deciding to close that market was that

1538
01:35:42,501 --> 01:35:45,650
that feeling has a lot to do with
community and supporting people.

1539
01:35:45,651 --> 01:35:50,540
And I knew that closing,
closing the market would sort
of temp in the short term,

1540
01:35:50,541 --> 01:35:53,360
maybe like take me farther away from that.

1541
01:35:53,361 --> 01:35:58,130
But I also had to flip fundamentally
believe that it would give me the space to

1542
01:35:58,190 --> 01:36:02,630
like in a different way. On a
larger scale, go back toward that.

1543
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,730
So a few questions relate to that.

1544
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:09,760
Why was the food market so quickly popular
or were there any particular reasons

1545
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:16,130
that uh, that come to mind? I think
part of it was timing of it. Um,

1546
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:21,020
so what was was I was really good
at making pasta. That's like,

1547
01:36:21,021 --> 01:36:23,690
I lived in Italy for two years.
I Made Pasta every day for 10 years.

1548
01:36:23,691 --> 01:36:26,990
I really love making Pasta and um,

1549
01:36:27,290 --> 01:36:30,350
and so people,
when the restaurant closed,

1550
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:32,810
I would sort of bump into people
in town and they'd be like, well,

1551
01:36:32,811 --> 01:36:36,310
we really miss your pasta. And
so, and I really enjoy that,

1552
01:36:36,311 --> 01:36:40,670
like beautiful sort of manual labor of
making it and the folding and the cutting

1553
01:36:40,671 --> 01:36:43,850
and the whole thing. And
so, um, I thought, well,

1554
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:48,380
what if I cut out all of the parts of
having a restaurant that I hate and I just

1555
01:36:48,381 --> 01:36:50,810
make the pasta and sell it to people.
So we had,

1556
01:36:50,811 --> 01:36:55,811
I had these friends who had a commercial
kitchen that was empty a lot of

1557
01:36:55,851 --> 01:36:58,250
evenings, so they let me use
it. And I was like, okay,

1558
01:36:58,251 --> 01:37:01,070
well how do I sell this pasta to people?
So this was,

1559
01:37:01,071 --> 01:37:04,400
I think it was 2009 so it was before,

1560
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:07,490
I think it was before Instagram or it
was certainly before Instagram was really

1561
01:37:07,491 --> 01:37:10,640
big and I maybe had a Twitter
with like five followers.

1562
01:37:10,641 --> 01:37:14,060
But like really Facebook was
the main thing that I used.

1563
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:17,720
And so I think I put on Facebook
like I'm in a cell, some pasta,

1564
01:37:17,721 --> 01:37:22,520
does anyone buy it? And I made a Google
doc and people started buying it. And so,

1565
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:23,510
um,
we had the,

1566
01:37:23,511 --> 01:37:27,050
I opened a little like Shopify storefront
where people would order the stuff

1567
01:37:27,051 --> 01:37:32,051
online and then I would know exactly
how much to make because it was a big

1568
01:37:32,091 --> 01:37:33,590
thing.
And food is like,

1569
01:37:33,591 --> 01:37:37,550
if it's already so hard to make money
and really if you're not efficient in

1570
01:37:37,551 --> 01:37:40,640
terms of every decision of
how much labor and ingredient,

1571
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:44,570
you'll really lose money.
So by sort of taking my orders in advance,

1572
01:37:44,571 --> 01:37:49,160
I knew exactly how much to make and
nothing was going to go to waste and then

1573
01:37:49,161 --> 01:37:50,630
people would come pick up their stuff.

1574
01:37:50,660 --> 01:37:55,660
And so then very quickly it grew from
just pasta to pasta and sausages to pasta

1575
01:37:56,251 --> 01:37:57,270
and sausages and cookies.

1576
01:37:57,271 --> 01:38:01,860
Cause everyone else that I knew who was
an unemployed cook who maybe wanted to

1577
01:38:01,861 --> 01:38:06,240
start their own food business also
wanted to do these things. So we,

1578
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:09,540
we started doing this and all of a sudden
it became this like online marketplace

1579
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:13,590
where you could preorder your and prepaid
for your food and then come and pick

1580
01:38:13,591 --> 01:38:15,030
up your stuff like a week later.

1581
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:19,740
I know it was sort of this way
to get beautiful restaurant
quality stuff at home,

1582
01:38:20,070 --> 01:38:22,800
but it was before,
it was certainly before caviar.

1583
01:38:22,801 --> 01:38:26,220
It was certainly before like a
lot of these internet food things.

1584
01:38:26,610 --> 01:38:28,890
And it was also before good eggs,

1585
01:38:28,891 --> 01:38:33,891
which is like a food tech startup
that was sort of born out of,

1586
01:38:34,050 --> 01:38:35,640
of this thing.
Um,

1587
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:40,700
and so it was definitely like one
of the first online like I dunno,

1588
01:38:41,970 --> 01:38:45,030
order your food thing. I don't
know. It was just a weird time.

1589
01:38:45,031 --> 01:38:48,750
And so then we had a mailing list from
the restaurant and I started sending it

1590
01:38:48,751 --> 01:38:49,310
out to that.

1591
01:38:49,310 --> 01:38:53,460
And very quickly because of the press
sort of was like very interested in this

1592
01:38:53,461 --> 01:38:57,120
weird way that I was operating this thing,
the mailing list grew to like,

1593
01:38:57,180 --> 01:39:01,430
you know, many, many tens of thousands
of people way more than I could support.

1594
01:39:01,550 --> 01:39:03,330
And so it was just,
it was,

1595
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:08,370
it was a whole thing that grew out of
control beyond the resources I had very

1596
01:39:08,371 --> 01:39:09,204
quickly.

1597
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:13,110
And so I was always struggling to keep
up and that became such a source of

1598
01:39:13,111 --> 01:39:16,620
stress and all I had wanted
to do was to make some pasta

1599
01:39:19,130 --> 01:39:24,130
and I'm like managing like 9,000
business licenses and permits and health

1600
01:39:25,351 --> 01:39:28,800
department and you know,
sh taxes and sales tax.

1601
01:39:28,830 --> 01:39:33,030
There was just like an vendors and vendor
infighting and people wanting their

1602
01:39:33,031 --> 01:39:34,290
beans Vegan or whatever.

1603
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:39,320
Like it was so much more
than I ever wanted to do and
it took so much energy and

1604
01:39:41,311 --> 01:39:45,000
I couldn't do it anymore and I knew,
I knew I couldn't do it anymore.

1605
01:39:45,090 --> 01:39:48,360
So you have, see you have this
feeling, I can't do this anymore,

1606
01:39:48,361 --> 01:39:53,361
which I think a lot of people have and
yet they keep doing it right for a long

1607
01:39:53,581 --> 01:39:57,370
time and maybe, maybe forever. Uh, it,

1608
01:39:58,050 --> 01:40:02,220
it to a certain extent
now while this is happening,

1609
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:07,280
you have these maternal instincts kicking
in your which make you feel obligated

1610
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:11,890
on some level to uh,

1611
01:40:12,210 --> 01:40:16,200
help these people who at least in your
head at some point and in their heads

1612
01:40:16,201 --> 01:40:18,240
depend on this income.

1613
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:23,490
When do you remember like the meal,
the drinks you had with a friend,

1614
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:28,230
the walk you took where you're just like,
you know what, fuck it. Like I have to,

1615
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:30,540
I have to say hello.
I have to close this down.

1616
01:40:30,541 --> 01:40:35,490
When you went from thinking about winding
it down to like, okay, tomorrow morning,

1617
01:40:35,550 --> 01:40:37,240
like that's it,
I'm doing it.

1618
01:40:38,730 --> 01:40:40,380
Therapy. Okay. All right.

1619
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:44,010
I'm pretty sure it was therapy
and I'm pretty sure I realized,

1620
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:49,100
I think the like thought that sort of
like really hit my body that I realized,

1621
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:51,473
um,

1622
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:55,990
it was that I had by that
point spent 10 years cooking.

1623
01:40:56,170 --> 01:40:59,890
I had been wanting to be a writer for,
you know,

1624
01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:02,650
since I was 15 years old.
Um,

1625
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:06,850
I finally had a chance to like
make the time to be a writer.

1626
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:10,250
I even had an office that I had
that I shared with other writers.

1627
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:12,100
Like I had everything in place,

1628
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:15,820
but because this thing was ruining
my life and making me miserable,

1629
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:21,640
I couldn't do the thing that I always
had wanted to do and was like basically

1630
01:41:21,641 --> 01:41:23,500
ready to do.
And so,

1631
01:41:23,501 --> 01:41:26,590
and not that it was some easy thing to
just go be a writer because like what I

1632
01:41:26,591 --> 01:41:30,270
was going to write, I ended up writing
blog posts for Yoga journal.com for $25.

1633
01:41:30,410 --> 01:41:34,630
Like it wasn't so much income or
anything, it was just this, I had this,

1634
01:41:34,870 --> 01:41:39,870
I knew that this thing was making me like
emotionally and almost physically ill.

1635
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:44,800
So I had, I just had to
stop. And I think, um,

1636
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:50,640
in that now I'm just so much more
attuned to that moment to that feeling of

1637
01:41:51,311 --> 01:41:54,160
knowing like, this thing
is bad for me, you know?

1638
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:56,980
And no matter how many other people,
it's a good for.

1639
01:41:57,010 --> 01:42:00,970
It's making me sick and it's
making me feel really bad.

1640
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:04,410
So I think, um, I,

1641
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:07,210
I try to be a lot more aware of that.

1642
01:42:07,211 --> 01:42:11,210
And sometimes now I get into situations
or projects or jobs where like I,

1643
01:42:11,290 --> 01:42:14,560
that feeling comes up again,
but I'm already in it.

1644
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:18,430
And often now a lot of the work
that I do is temporary. You know,

1645
01:42:18,431 --> 01:42:22,540
like it's a one I'd make, I do one
project, I do one article, I do one story,

1646
01:42:22,541 --> 01:42:27,340
I do one, whatever. Um, so now
for me it's more about learning,

1647
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:32,500
um, and being really attuned to what's
happening. Even just for example,

1648
01:42:32,501 --> 01:42:35,740
in the process of making the show,
like I had never made a show before.

1649
01:42:35,770 --> 01:42:38,290
This was this incredible
opportunity that came to me.

1650
01:42:38,291 --> 01:42:43,150
I was so excited and felt so lucky
to go make it and go do it. And,

1651
01:42:43,180 --> 01:42:46,210
um,
and I still feel so lucky and so excited,

1652
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:49,540
but a lot of things happen throughout the
making of the show that I was like, oh,

1653
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:53,710
this doesn't feel very good,
or this doesn't feel very fair.

1654
01:42:53,770 --> 01:42:57,940
Or I don't ever want to be in a
situation like this again, you know? And,

1655
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:02,260
and so now that I know what this
situation, what, what's possible,

1656
01:43:02,290 --> 01:43:06,850
like I know that when negatively and also
positively I know what to ask for and

1657
01:43:06,851 --> 01:43:10,000
I know how to articulate
that. And so, you know,

1658
01:43:10,001 --> 01:43:12,640
like I will affirm ever insist,
you know,

1659
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:17,700
like to me I'm going to insist on working
with a lot more people of color in the

1660
01:43:17,831 --> 01:43:18,250
future.

1661
01:43:18,250 --> 01:43:22,960
Like I'm going to insist on making sure
that I have a lot more power creatively

1662
01:43:22,961 --> 01:43:24,780
in anything that I do because I,

1663
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:28,900
I realized I became very frustrated when
I didn't have as much power as I needed

1664
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,030
or wanted. So, um,

1665
01:43:31,210 --> 01:43:35,020
there just things like it's a constant
learning thing. Nothing's perfect.

1666
01:43:35,021 --> 01:43:38,120
We figure things out as we go and,

1667
01:43:38,180 --> 01:43:42,130
and like we try to do our best and
like what is failure? I don't know.

1668
01:43:42,131 --> 01:43:44,410
I mean it's not that big of a deal if,

1669
01:43:44,411 --> 01:43:48,880
especially if there's some
sort of positive takeaway
that you have and maybe my

1670
01:43:48,881 --> 01:43:50,200
therapist would be really proud of me.

1671
01:43:50,201 --> 01:43:52,880
Maybe it's really bad me to even say
that my therapist would be proud of me,

1672
01:43:52,881 --> 01:43:54,800
but like,
but like,

1673
01:43:54,830 --> 01:43:59,270
but I do feel like all of these stories
and all of these experiences really

1674
01:43:59,271 --> 01:44:03,590
always come back to me sort of
paying attention to my feelings.

1675
01:44:05,230 --> 01:44:06,710
Yeah. Here, here, that's,

1676
01:44:06,730 --> 01:44:10,360
that's something that I've also personally
been been working on because I think

1677
01:44:10,361 --> 01:44:13,570
I muted my feelings are viewed them
as a liability for so long and I've,

1678
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:18,830
I've realized Holy Shit,
you cannot spreadsheet your
way out of everything. No,

1679
01:44:19,410 --> 01:44:22,540
no. We're into everything. You
really have to pay attention to that.

1680
01:44:22,870 --> 01:44:25,540
I mean I came,
I think about that all the time.

1681
01:44:25,541 --> 01:44:30,541
Like I came from a culture that's like
very much about sort of appearances and

1682
01:44:31,241 --> 01:44:35,740
not very touchy feely and a lot of ways
I came from a family that wasn't super

1683
01:44:35,741 --> 01:44:38,770
touchy feely.
I came so like what did I learn to do?

1684
01:44:38,771 --> 01:44:42,300
I learned to shut down all of my
own feelings and then I made myself,

1685
01:44:42,340 --> 01:44:47,260
I made my way into a profession who
literally tells you to shut down your

1686
01:44:47,261 --> 01:44:49,360
feelings.
Like when you're a cook in a restaurant,

1687
01:44:49,690 --> 01:44:53,050
you don't have time or room or space
for feelings. Like, and not only that,

1688
01:44:53,410 --> 01:44:56,980
not only emotional feelings,
but if you actually burn or cut yourself,

1689
01:44:57,010 --> 01:45:00,370
there's not time or space to address that.

1690
01:45:00,371 --> 01:45:02,320
You just sort of wrap your
hand up and keep going.

1691
01:45:02,470 --> 01:45:07,470
So there's this way where like I have
been trying to unravel the many years of

1692
01:45:08,921 --> 01:45:13,921
sort of emotional shutdown that
I have been conditioned to be in.

1693
01:45:14,650 --> 01:45:18,490
And so now I'm like, I'm gone. I'm like
on way to the other end where I'm like,

1694
01:45:18,491 --> 01:45:22,610
what is the field? You know, I read
about Jill Soloway always sets and uh,

1695
01:45:22,670 --> 01:45:26,090
she's the director, the director and
creator of transparent. And I read about,

1696
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:28,670
or the other day I was listening
to an interview with, um,

1697
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:33,020
one of the actors from Atlanta and I
read about these TV sets where everyone's

1698
01:45:33,021 --> 01:45:36,710
real touchy feely and I'm like checks in
with each other all the time. And like,

1699
01:45:36,711 --> 01:45:39,920
they have an emotional check in
every morning. And, and I'm like,

1700
01:45:39,950 --> 01:45:44,560
that's the kind of place where I
want to work like that. I'm like,

1701
01:45:44,810 --> 01:45:47,870
I just want to work where
like the camera man is like,

1702
01:45:47,871 --> 01:45:49,640
and we are crying together.
You know,

1703
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:54,200
if you are,

1704
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:56,320
if you do have that experience,

1705
01:45:56,380 --> 01:45:59,380
I want to have a followup conversation
to see if you're like, okay,

1706
01:45:59,381 --> 01:46:01,850
that's my home. Or if you're like,
you know what, a pendulum swing

1707
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:02,770
too far the other direction.

1708
01:46:02,771 --> 01:46:07,210
Like I think I want somewhere in the
middle I can only have half the camera

1709
01:46:07,211 --> 01:46:09,560
people crying.
Uh,

1710
01:46:10,110 --> 01:46:11,340
you,
you,

1711
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:15,930
you have tackled so many different
projects and so many different ways.

1712
01:46:16,770 --> 01:46:18,890
You've had some missteps,
a,

1713
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:21,990
you've made your mistakes
as we all have a,

1714
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:24,780
your book was,

1715
01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:28,580
I at least from the outside looking in a,
I mean,

1716
01:46:28,590 --> 01:46:33,590
a real flag in the ground that has
allowed you to do a lot of things.

1717
01:46:33,751 --> 01:46:36,390
And it's a very, very, uh, it's
a very good book. Like I said,

1718
01:46:36,391 --> 01:46:41,391
it's one of the few I keep in my kitchen
and I'd love to chat just a little bit

1719
01:46:43,441 --> 01:46:47,360
about the genesis because
I think it was what,

1720
01:46:47,370 --> 01:46:51,630
let's say around 2006 when
slip this note to pollen.

1721
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:54,210
And when did, uh, when
did your book come out?

1722
01:46:55,050 --> 01:46:59,610
20, uh, La last year was last year. Yeah.

1723
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:01,340
Plus your 2017. Okay. Yeah.

1724
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:05,880
And this is not a book that you,

1725
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:08,700
uh,
churned out really quickly.

1726
01:47:08,701 --> 01:47:12,210
You didn't just assemble another cookbook,

1727
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:16,910
which you and I both know are everywhere.
Uh,

1728
01:47:16,911 --> 01:47:19,290
and,
and it did make a mark.

1729
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:22,500
So I'm really curious to know you,

1730
01:47:22,610 --> 01:47:25,320
your auditing this class
with Michael Pollan,

1731
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:30,800
what are some of the early ideas for the
book or really titles for the book that

1732
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:33,360
never saw the light of day?

1733
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:37,450
So after I audited the class with my goal,

1734
01:47:37,451 --> 01:47:41,860
he started writing a book about cooking,
which ended up being cooked.

1735
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:47,050
So he asked me to teach him how to cook.
So when I would come over to his house,

1736
01:47:47,170 --> 01:47:50,230
we would cook together and
talk about cooking. And I,

1737
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:53,980
every week when I went over there
I'd bring over a different book idea.

1738
01:47:56,230 --> 01:48:00,640
And there were smart, Ho, many
bad ones, so many bad ones.

1739
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,640
Like, um, I can't remember all of them.

1740
01:48:03,641 --> 01:48:08,110
I do remember there was one where I had
this sort of mentee employee who was

1741
01:48:08,111 --> 01:48:11,620
kind of like this like,
um, bipolar gutter punk,

1742
01:48:12,370 --> 01:48:15,430
what is a gutter punk?
I got her punk is like a,

1743
01:48:15,470 --> 01:48:18,210
well we have a lot of
them in Berkeley. Um, he,

1744
01:48:19,180 --> 01:48:23,710
he was just this kind of punky kid who
was like, had all the tattoos and um,

1745
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:28,240
and listen to like, you
know, like loud music.

1746
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:31,900
I don't know, like he called
himself, I got her punk and so he,

1747
01:48:31,901 --> 01:48:35,680
and he had a lot of like
learning disability is an,

1748
01:48:35,950 --> 01:48:39,160
I had given up hope on him as an employee.
I don't even know why we hired him.

1749
01:48:39,161 --> 01:48:40,870
And eventually I just was like,

1750
01:48:40,930 --> 01:48:43,930
I give up such hope on him that
I couldn't look at him for.

1751
01:48:44,050 --> 01:48:45,730
I couldn't look him in the eye for months.

1752
01:48:46,180 --> 01:48:50,920
And at some point there was some moment
that he had where he turned himself

1753
01:48:50,921 --> 01:48:53,530
around and he came to work and suddenly,

1754
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:58,060
I think it had to do with taking honestly
his, um, his mental health medication.

1755
01:48:58,510 --> 01:49:00,070
And so,
um,

1756
01:49:00,130 --> 01:49:04,900
and so he just like became
this incredible student and,

1757
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:09,250
and I felt really bad for not having
been a better supporter of his,

1758
01:49:09,251 --> 01:49:13,540
but then I also became motivated to
really teach him and support him.

1759
01:49:13,930 --> 01:49:16,840
And this incredible moment was when he
came to work one day and he was like,

1760
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:19,780
I don't want you guys to be
mad at me, but I, you know,

1761
01:49:19,781 --> 01:49:24,781
I've been going to community college and
I signed up for a study abroad program

1762
01:49:24,941 --> 01:49:29,320
and I'm going to Italy. Like I was
like, we are not mad at you. I was like,

1763
01:49:29,321 --> 01:49:31,300
this is the most amazing
thing that you like.

1764
01:49:31,301 --> 01:49:34,840
Somehow it went from basically being
nearly homeless when you started coming

1765
01:49:34,841 --> 01:49:38,830
here to caring about food so much that
you like sign yourself up for community

1766
01:49:38,831 --> 01:49:40,540
college,
you got yourself to go to Italy.

1767
01:49:40,541 --> 01:49:43,780
Like this is incredible and we're gonna
help you as much as we possibly can.

1768
01:49:44,170 --> 01:49:45,280
So he was really,

1769
01:49:45,281 --> 01:49:48,820
this I learned probably as much from
as he learned from me and I was like,

1770
01:49:48,821 --> 01:49:52,480
I'm going to write a memoir of teaching
Robin how to cook. And Michael was like,

1771
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:56,580
that's a terrible idea. It was like
nobody wants to read them. And then,

1772
01:49:57,320 --> 01:49:58,840
and so then,
you know,

1773
01:49:58,841 --> 01:50:01,750
and then I had this other idea where
I was going to write the tartine after

1774
01:50:01,751 --> 01:50:06,310
hours cookbook cause they're like menu
cookbook of all these dinners that I had

1775
01:50:06,311 --> 01:50:10,390
made that I was making an in tartine
bakery. And Michael was like, you know,

1776
01:50:10,391 --> 01:50:11,310
and that's fine.
Like,

1777
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:15,640
but I know you're thinking it's going
to be easy and no books are easy.

1778
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,520
And eventually he would sit
down. Yeah. He's just like,

1779
01:50:18,521 --> 01:50:22,630
there's no such thing as an easy book
for. Yeah. And so, um, he said to me,

1780
01:50:22,631 --> 01:50:24,940
he was like, I, I know you. Oh,

1781
01:50:24,941 --> 01:50:29,410
he would interview me periodically so
to get quotes for his book. And he said,

1782
01:50:29,530 --> 01:50:32,620
what's the deal? You're so obsessed with
these four elements. And I was like,

1783
01:50:32,621 --> 01:50:34,300
oh yeah, salt, fat, acid, heat, you know,

1784
01:50:34,301 --> 01:50:36,820
that's the system that I
used to teach myself to cook.

1785
01:50:36,821 --> 01:50:40,300
I used to teach other people. I always
thought I'd write a book about it one day.

1786
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:45,790
And he was like, well, there is your
book, write that. And I was like, no, no,

1787
01:50:45,791 --> 01:50:49,120
no, no, no. I was like, that book's
going to be really hard to write.

1788
01:50:49,270 --> 01:50:53,320
It won't have beautiful photos because
it's not about that kind of cooking.

1789
01:50:53,350 --> 01:50:57,940
And it just, I, I can't do
that. And he, he's, he just,

1790
01:50:57,941 --> 01:51:00,040
I remember this so
clearly. He said, listen,

1791
01:51:00,041 --> 01:51:04,630
like you live in a delusional
universe where everyone who you know,

1792
01:51:04,631 --> 01:51:07,870
who's written a successful book is
already a celebrity of some kind,

1793
01:51:07,871 --> 01:51:10,210
either a celebrity chef or
like some famous writer.

1794
01:51:10,630 --> 01:51:15,630
And so you have this really confused
notion that book and celebrity are somehow

1795
01:51:15,941 --> 01:51:18,490
like tied together or
notoriety or something.

1796
01:51:18,850 --> 01:51:23,260
But really what publishers want
is a unique and strong idea.

1797
01:51:23,710 --> 01:51:27,520
And that's what this is. I've never heard
this before. It makes so much sense.

1798
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:31,480
And so this is your book. And he's like,
stop messing around and go do this.

1799
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:32,980
And I was like,
right.

1800
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:37,870
And so I just felt the weight of this
like huge task being set before me.

1801
01:51:38,260 --> 01:51:41,650
And, um, and so, you
know, and like I said,

1802
01:51:41,651 --> 01:51:43,690
I didn't really have the tools
in the beginning. I mean,

1803
01:51:43,691 --> 01:51:46,690
I sort of knew what went into a book,
went into a book proposal.

1804
01:51:46,691 --> 01:51:47,740
He sort of told me,

1805
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:51,400
but I also knew that this was would look
much different than any book proposal

1806
01:51:51,401 --> 01:51:52,450
he had ever written.

1807
01:51:53,230 --> 01:51:57,550
And so I just sort of started
going to my office. I have got a,

1808
01:51:57,610 --> 01:52:00,490
I got a writing residency and
I went to go figure this out.

1809
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:02,600
It was my first writing resident,
sorry.

1810
01:52:03,930 --> 01:52:05,530
It's just like,
uh,

1811
01:52:05,590 --> 01:52:09,670
it was like an opportunity to go
right for two weeks uninterrupted in,

1812
01:52:09,671 --> 01:52:12,370
in a beautiful setting and
like be housed and fed.

1813
01:52:13,210 --> 01:52:18,070
And that was maybe a mistake to go so
early in my writing process because I

1814
01:52:18,071 --> 01:52:21,310
wasn't really writing,
I was still very much like idiating.

1815
01:52:21,460 --> 01:52:24,790
So I just had like a wall of post it
notes and then everyone else at the

1816
01:52:24,791 --> 01:52:26,710
residency would come down to
the dinner table and be like,

1817
01:52:26,711 --> 01:52:28,480
I wrote 5,000 words today.
And I'd be like, yeah,

1818
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:33,000
well I like, I always want
to slap those people. No,

1819
01:52:33,001 --> 01:52:36,980
no offense to anyone listening as
well as people. They're like, Oh man,

1820
01:52:37,340 --> 01:52:39,650
had a pretty tough day.
Only knocked out 5,000 words.

1821
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:44,390
What I barely figured out,
which fought to use on the first page.

1822
01:52:45,710 --> 01:52:46,100
I like

1823
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:49,760
laying in a hammock a lot.
And um, and that first round,

1824
01:52:49,761 --> 01:52:52,220
like anything I wrote during
those two weeks, I was,

1825
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:55,280
that was definitely the time when I
was attempting to be Michael Pollan.

1826
01:52:55,730 --> 01:52:59,480
And so eventually I realized that
wasn't working for me. And so then,

1827
01:52:59,540 --> 01:53:03,470
and then I tried for a short while to
be another writer and then that wasn't

1828
01:53:03,471 --> 01:53:06,230
working either. And then eventually I
was like, oh, I just have to be myself.

1829
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:09,560
Who the other, if you don't mind.
And it's my friend Tamara Adler,

1830
01:53:09,561 --> 01:53:11,060
who's an incredible writer.

1831
01:53:11,061 --> 01:53:14,840
She just has such a beautiful way of
writing that I very much enjoy reading,

1832
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:18,680
but it's not me. So you
know, and so, and um,

1833
01:53:18,770 --> 01:53:22,850
and it's so good that I
want it to be my word,

1834
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:27,020
but it's not my words.
And so I had to,

1835
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:32,090
I had to just be okay with whatever
comes out of my mouth or on, you know,

1836
01:53:32,091 --> 01:53:34,070
under my page is,
is my thing.

1837
01:53:34,070 --> 01:53:36,710
And I'm still learning that
like there are so many times,

1838
01:53:36,711 --> 01:53:39,680
even when I got this get
column for The Times magazine,

1839
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:43,790
which at the time when I started cooking
was really like the highest sort of,

1840
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:48,440
I dunno, like writing that was
coming out about food. It was me.

1841
01:53:48,441 --> 01:53:52,280
It was like the thing that I had always
dreamt of was to be able to write the

1842
01:53:52,281 --> 01:53:53,600
food column for The Times magazine.

1843
01:53:53,601 --> 01:53:56,480
So I couldn't believe it when
it finally became my job.

1844
01:53:56,481 --> 01:53:57,740
And I still can't really believe it.

1845
01:53:58,100 --> 01:54:01,880
And I still have so much terror every time
I sit down to write it where I'm like,

1846
01:54:01,881 --> 01:54:04,190
this is going to be published in the
New York Times magazine. Oh my God.

1847
01:54:04,191 --> 01:54:08,210
Like I'm not smart enough for this.
And so I'm not good enough for this.

1848
01:54:08,240 --> 01:54:12,260
And so then, um, and there's this
way where sometimes I'll turn,

1849
01:54:12,290 --> 01:54:15,940
I'll just be lazy and I can't figure
out a different way to say something.

1850
01:54:15,950 --> 01:54:18,740
So I'll write the silly,
stupid way that I would say it.

1851
01:54:19,460 --> 01:54:23,450
And that's the stuff the
editors are always like, this
is amazing. You're so good.

1852
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:27,050
And I, every time I'm like, oh, I thought
that's what you were going to cut.

1853
01:54:27,051 --> 01:54:30,300
Like there was this one time when I said
something like, hello, my name is Simien.

1854
01:54:30,460 --> 01:54:31,790
I basically wear it like,
hi,

1855
01:54:31,791 --> 01:54:34,370
my name is [inaudible] and I'm an
artisan bread hoarder, you know,

1856
01:54:34,371 --> 01:54:38,810
which is such a silly dumb thing to
say. And she was like, this is amazing.

1857
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:41,510
And I was like, I don't, and so
eventually I had to ask her, I said,

1858
01:54:41,511 --> 01:54:45,830
why is it that you always like this
really silly stuff that's not crafted?

1859
01:54:45,860 --> 01:54:47,450
You know?
And she said,

1860
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:52,130
because it's you and because you're
here because we like your voice.

1861
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:56,510
And so the more true you can beat your
own voice, the better that is. And I said,

1862
01:54:56,511 --> 01:54:58,700
but isn't that like the
cheesiest possible stuff?

1863
01:54:58,701 --> 01:55:02,120
I figured he would cut all those like
dumb jokes that I make and she said,

1864
01:55:02,121 --> 01:55:04,370
you know, maybe if it came from
someone else we would cut it.

1865
01:55:04,371 --> 01:55:07,250
But when it comes from you,
it sounds so true to what,

1866
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:10,820
how you would actually talk or what
you would actually write that we,

1867
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:14,540
it makes sense for us to keep it and I
said it is how I actually talk. She said,

1868
01:55:14,541 --> 01:55:14,841
yeah,

1869
01:55:14,841 --> 01:55:18,980
so that's why we want it so I'm still
getting it through my head that the thing

1870
01:55:18,981 --> 01:55:21,080
that people value about me is me,

1871
01:55:21,170 --> 01:55:25,970
you know me trying to be of
MacArthur genius or whatever.

1872
01:55:26,210 --> 01:55:28,910
Right.
You mentioned,

1873
01:55:28,911 --> 01:55:33,770
you mentioned earlier how Michael said
to you something along the lines of

1874
01:55:33,771 --> 01:55:36,830
publishers are looking for
unique and clear ideas.

1875
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:38,990
I just want to

1876
01:55:41,870 --> 01:55:44,160
take that and expand it a bit because

1877
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:45,780
for people who are listening,

1878
01:55:46,390 --> 01:55:51,060
I would also say that what any
audience or potential audience,

1879
01:55:51,061 --> 01:55:55,590
the people out there who are part of your
tribe or who want the version of you,

1880
01:55:55,591 --> 01:55:56,580
that is the true you,

1881
01:55:56,581 --> 01:56:01,530
that you can put on the page also
want not just unique and clear ideas,

1882
01:56:01,531 --> 01:56:04,050
but they want a unique and clear voice.

1883
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:08,970
And that I've had friends come to me
who have incredible stories and are well

1884
01:56:08,971 --> 01:56:11,220
spoken, but they say, I'm
not a writer. I can't write.

1885
01:56:11,910 --> 01:56:13,740
I don't know if I could
ever tell my story,

1886
01:56:13,741 --> 01:56:15,900
although people tell me I should write a
book, I should do this, I should do that.

1887
01:56:15,901 --> 01:56:17,040
And that's a longer conversation.

1888
01:56:17,041 --> 01:56:18,970
Like whether you should
write a book or not as is

1889
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:24,350
most miserable. Four years of
your life. Yeah. Yeah. Right.

1890
01:56:24,610 --> 01:56:25,770
If it, if, if it, if,

1891
01:56:25,820 --> 01:56:29,800
if for whatever reason it exercises more
demons than like a year is it pulls out

1892
01:56:29,801 --> 01:56:32,560
of your life then. Yes,
but, but what, what, uh,

1893
01:56:32,740 --> 01:56:36,160
what I try to convey,
and this was set to me actually,

1894
01:56:36,161 --> 01:56:40,410
is that you don't need to be John McPhee.
You don't need to be Michael Paul.

1895
01:56:40,411 --> 01:56:42,250
You don't need to be,
uh,

1896
01:56:42,370 --> 01:56:46,840
anyone who's writing you admire
so much that intimidates you, uh,

1897
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:51,100
to actually be a good writer, if
that makes any sense. Like if you,

1898
01:56:51,101 --> 01:56:55,870
if you have a unique and clear voice
and you can consistently be you,

1899
01:56:55,900 --> 01:57:00,010
then you've won more than half
the battle. And the SEC, if you,

1900
01:57:00,090 --> 01:57:02,980
if you don't know how to use a semi colon,
it's fine.

1901
01:57:04,210 --> 01:57:08,830
Not the most material
problem. Uh, and it's, uh,

1902
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:12,250
I think you, you accomplish
that really well in your book.

1903
01:57:12,610 --> 01:57:17,140
And I would be curious to know as someone
who has dabbled in television a few

1904
01:57:17,141 --> 01:57:17,974
times now,

1905
01:57:18,610 --> 01:57:23,610
what did you find most
rewarding and challenging
about the television format and

1906
01:57:26,331 --> 01:57:27,940
it,
and why did you decide to say yes?

1907
01:57:27,941 --> 01:57:32,440
Because you go from a relatively solitary,

1908
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:37,570
uh, queen of the castle environment.
When you're writing a book right now,

1909
01:57:37,571 --> 01:57:41,500
granted you have editors and so on,
but it's, it's kind of your Gig, right?

1910
01:57:41,501 --> 01:57:44,890
In a lot of ways to holy shit.

1911
01:57:45,810 --> 01:57:49,750
Who are all these people? What
am I going to do? Do I, how do I,

1912
01:57:49,751 --> 01:57:51,920
am I supposed to interact with everybody?
How do I meant it's,

1913
01:57:51,921 --> 01:57:56,340
it's completely different environment.
So why did you decide to do TV and,

1914
01:57:56,450 --> 01:57:58,960
and uh,
what were things that surprised you?

1915
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:02,660
Well, in terms of this,
like solitary versus social,

1916
01:58:02,661 --> 01:58:07,661
I have always been both and which is
why I continue to cook because I really

1917
01:58:07,731 --> 01:58:10,550
enjoy both the manual,
like physical part of it,

1918
01:58:10,551 --> 01:58:14,960
but also the really communal part of it
where I get to go be in conversation and

1919
01:58:14,961 --> 01:58:18,500
ask other people what they're cooking and
eating and learn new things from other

1920
01:58:18,501 --> 01:58:18,951
cooks.

1921
01:58:18,951 --> 01:58:23,951
So I think I'd go bananas if I was
only sitting at a desk all day,

1922
01:58:24,081 --> 01:58:27,950
every day, you know? So I enjoy
having both things. So to me,

1923
01:58:28,340 --> 01:58:32,620
the decision to go work on some
collaboration that would bring me in to,

1924
01:58:33,310 --> 01:58:36,110
you know,
work with a lot of people all the time,

1925
01:58:36,111 --> 01:58:40,400
that really wasn't a
negative thing at all. Um,

1926
01:58:40,610 --> 01:58:44,920
and then, I don't know,
you know, I was so excited.

1927
01:58:44,950 --> 01:58:45,850
I um,

1928
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:50,950
I was so excited about the opportunity
to bring this philosophy of cooking to a

1929
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:51,491
broad,

1930
01:58:51,491 --> 01:58:56,260
broad audience that that was ultimately
the thing that I was seeking.

1931
01:58:56,290 --> 01:58:57,580
And to me,

1932
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:02,410
I think after the first or second
cooking class I ever taught,

1933
01:59:02,411 --> 01:59:05,650
which I think was around 2006 or 2007,

1934
01:59:06,220 --> 01:59:11,220
I remember coming to work one day with
my friends with these other chefs and I

1935
01:59:12,731 --> 01:59:16,030
said, you know, this is really
inefficient. I was like,

1936
01:59:16,031 --> 01:59:21,010
here I am like teaching 12 ladies,
you know, 12 wealthy ladies how to,

1937
01:59:21,011 --> 01:59:22,840
I don't know,
use the right amount of salt or whatever.

1938
01:59:23,850 --> 01:59:26,950
Like how many of these 12 person cooking
classes I'm going to have to teach

1939
01:59:26,951 --> 01:59:30,070
before I actually teach people,
you know,

1940
01:59:30,280 --> 01:59:31,960
a really a broad audience.

1941
01:59:31,961 --> 01:59:35,740
How this kind of fundamental and
really life changing information.

1942
01:59:35,770 --> 01:59:38,620
It seems like it's going to be
hard to reach a large crowd.

1943
01:59:38,621 --> 01:59:42,580
Plus just the economics of it that like
for my time and the ingredients and

1944
01:59:42,581 --> 01:59:46,060
renting a kitchen or whatever,
it wasn't inexpensive, you know,

1945
01:59:46,061 --> 01:59:47,200
I had to charge a lot of money.

1946
01:59:47,890 --> 01:59:52,890
And so that meant that it was already
like naturally narrowing down the group of

1947
01:59:52,991 --> 01:59:55,870
people to whom I could teach this stuff.

1948
01:59:56,200 --> 02:00:00,880
So I came into work one day and I
was like, I think if I had a TV show,

1949
02:00:01,180 --> 02:00:03,940
I think if I had a cooking show
where I taught people how to cook,

1950
02:00:04,060 --> 02:00:06,040
I could reach so many more people.

1951
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:10,870
I could do it so much more efficiently
and it would really make a difference.

1952
02:00:10,900 --> 02:00:15,580
And being Berkeley, my two friends
were like, that's a terrible idea.

1953
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:19,450
You are a terrible capitalist
who you know, has totally,

1954
02:00:19,490 --> 02:00:22,840
totally like sold out because the idea,
they're like in Berkeley,

1955
02:00:22,841 --> 02:00:24,340
most people like don't have television,

1956
02:00:24,341 --> 02:00:25,750
they don't let their
kids watch television.

1957
02:00:25,751 --> 02:00:30,070
So the idea that I could possibly want
to do television was just like so sort of

1958
02:00:30,071 --> 02:00:32,170
morally uncouth or whatever.

1959
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:35,140
And so that really sort
of stung me at the time,

1960
02:00:35,141 --> 02:00:37,180
but I now I recently
remember it, I was like, oh,

1961
02:00:37,181 --> 02:00:40,090
this has been something I've thought
about and wanted for a long time.

1962
02:00:40,090 --> 02:00:44,110
So when the opportunity to turn the
book into a show presented itself,

1963
02:00:44,380 --> 02:00:47,830
I was like, yes, this is amazing.
I get to do something different.

1964
02:00:47,860 --> 02:00:51,910
I think there's a lot of
food TV out there. Um,

1965
02:00:51,940 --> 02:00:53,440
they're sort of two types of it.

1966
02:00:53,470 --> 02:00:58,150
There's like the really accessible
sort of everyday cooking stuff that is

1967
02:00:58,210 --> 02:01:03,210
generally shot in a studio with like
not so great lighting and is meant to be

1968
02:01:03,431 --> 02:01:06,700
sort of like getting you to
make some simple stuff at home.

1969
02:01:07,180 --> 02:01:12,010
And then there's the really aspirational
like cinematic stuff like chef's table,

1970
02:01:12,250 --> 02:01:16,660
which is not so much about cooking as
it is sort of like a hagiography of a

1971
02:01:16,661 --> 02:01:21,100
different chef. And it's really
like aspirational and quite elite.

1972
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:26,220
And so I was really upset when I thought
about it that there was nothing that

1973
02:01:26,291 --> 02:01:30,520
existed that was beautiful and
cinematic, but also accessible. You know,

1974
02:01:30,521 --> 02:01:32,980
why I didn't exist at the
intersection of these two things.

1975
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:38,050
And so I knew that I wanted to
make something gorgeous and, um,

1976
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:42,530
just inspiring and,
but also be for everyone.

1977
02:01:42,620 --> 02:01:47,540
And there were ways in which that was
very easy for me to translate because I

1978
02:01:47,541 --> 02:01:51,620
had already been distilling those ideas
into the book and into the way I wanted

1979
02:01:51,621 --> 02:01:56,150
the book to look and the Vision I had for
the way the book would be in the world

1980
02:01:56,151 --> 02:01:57,590
and function in people's lives.

1981
02:01:57,860 --> 02:02:01,250
And then there were entirely new things
that I had to learn throughout the

1982
02:02:01,251 --> 02:02:04,340
process of, um, because I've
never made a show before.

1983
02:02:04,670 --> 02:02:09,670
So one of the things that I like looking
back after having gone through both all

1984
02:02:09,681 --> 02:02:12,800
of the pre production and then 40 weeks
of like production and post production,

1985
02:02:12,980 --> 02:02:15,470
I mean I kept saying to people, they'd
be like, when will you have time?

1986
02:02:15,471 --> 02:02:19,490
I was like, imagine I'm pregnant 40
weeks. Like imagine I'm pregnant,

1987
02:02:19,491 --> 02:02:21,070
call me when the baby's born.
Cause like,

1988
02:02:21,110 --> 02:02:25,100
that's how and how intense this
thing is going to be. And so, um,

1989
02:02:25,610 --> 02:02:26,443
they,

1990
02:02:26,570 --> 02:02:31,570
that one of the things that I did not
anticipate but realized pretty quickly

1991
02:02:31,971 --> 02:02:36,320
that I was so good at and I
really enjoyed doing was I,

1992
02:02:37,010 --> 02:02:38,570
for some weird reason,

1993
02:02:38,571 --> 02:02:43,571
I don't know why I have this ability
to ignore the cameras and just be me.

1994
02:02:43,880 --> 02:02:48,050
Like I don't change at all. And so
there's a way people kept saying, Oh,

1995
02:02:48,051 --> 02:02:49,610
you're a natural,
you're a natural.

1996
02:02:49,611 --> 02:02:54,080
And so I think that's what
they were referring to was
that I'm the exact same on

1997
02:02:54,081 --> 02:02:58,980
camera as I am off camera.
And I had to learn, you know,

1998
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:02,840
some basic things like where to stand
and what's light and where do I look and

1999
02:03:02,841 --> 02:03:07,040
where do I not look? But,
um, that was great. Perfect.

2000
02:03:07,220 --> 02:03:09,110
One more for safety.
You're like, yeah, totally.

2001
02:03:09,111 --> 02:03:13,280
I mean everything like 50 times.
And I also,

2002
02:03:13,281 --> 02:03:17,330
because I'm a perfectionist would take
it really personally at first and I'd be

2003
02:03:17,331 --> 02:03:20,600
like, oh no, I did it wrong. I have to do
it again. And pretty quickly I realized,

2004
02:03:20,630 --> 02:03:21,830
oh,
we're doing it again.

2005
02:03:21,831 --> 02:03:24,020
And it has nothing to do with
me doing it right or wrong.

2006
02:03:24,050 --> 02:03:27,530
It's because they need a different
angle or he messed some to the sound guy

2007
02:03:27,531 --> 02:03:30,110
messed something, you know,
there are just so many variables.

2008
02:03:30,380 --> 02:03:34,640
So the way that like I could
deliver the energy high every time,

2009
02:03:35,010 --> 02:03:36,700
but you know,
and that was a,

2010
02:03:36,710 --> 02:03:40,610
that was stuff that I
guess isn't something that
everyone has. So I had that.

2011
02:03:40,611 --> 02:03:44,390
So that was great. And then can I pause
for one second? All sorts. I think that,

2012
02:03:45,120 --> 02:03:50,120
and this is pure speculation, but
you've taught so much, I think that you,

2013
02:03:50,390 --> 02:03:55,370
I think that you hone that ability
also in the process of teaching. Uh,

2014
02:03:55,430 --> 02:04:00,260
I just, I've seen that overlap,
uh, for, for some folks.

2015
02:04:00,290 --> 02:04:04,610
So I don't know how much of it is
nature versus nurture. But yeah,

2016
02:04:05,150 --> 02:04:08,150
I definitely think for sure,
and also even just cooking itself,

2017
02:04:08,151 --> 02:04:09,770
cooking is a repetition,
right?

2018
02:04:10,010 --> 02:04:12,830
Like cooking is everyday you
come in and do the thing again,

2019
02:04:12,831 --> 02:04:16,640
whether you did it perfectly yesterday
or really badly yesterday and so,

2020
02:04:16,641 --> 02:04:19,250
and there's, you just have to put
your head down and do it again.

2021
02:04:19,251 --> 02:04:22,730
And so I feel like there were
certain, like, I don't know,

2022
02:04:22,731 --> 02:04:27,140
callouses that I had formed just
from my other jobs that made,

2023
02:04:27,170 --> 02:04:31,910
made me be like ready to
be good at this. But, um,

2024
02:04:32,930 --> 02:04:34,340
it's funny that

2025
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:39,420
there were so many things I didn't know
because I'd never done it before and

2026
02:04:39,450 --> 02:04:43,860
also nobody explained to me. And so
there are, in retrospect, I'm like,

2027
02:04:43,890 --> 02:04:47,430
because maybe I'm a teacher who likes
to put people at ease and explain things

2028
02:04:47,431 --> 02:04:50,700
to them throughout the process. There
would be these things that I would learn,

2029
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:54,390
like distill an articulate and then
at the next day, the next shoot,

2030
02:04:54,391 --> 02:04:55,560
the next time we were with someone else,

2031
02:04:55,561 --> 02:04:59,310
I would be able to explain this cause
we were going around the world and

2032
02:04:59,311 --> 02:05:03,420
bringing all sorts of different people,
um, onto the screen with us. And so,

2033
02:05:03,630 --> 02:05:07,710
and almost none of them had ever
been on camera before. And you know,

2034
02:05:07,711 --> 02:05:10,890
we show up with this crew of 25 people
and all these trucks and all this

2035
02:05:10,891 --> 02:05:14,820
equipment and lighting. It's so much
stuff and it's so overwhelming for people.

2036
02:05:15,240 --> 02:05:19,020
And especially in some of the places
that we went where it was really off the

2037
02:05:19,021 --> 02:05:22,470
beaten path, like very rural
places in Japan and in Mexico.

2038
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:27,270
And so I kept trying to do,
it's that beginner's mind
thing where I'm like, okay,

2039
02:05:27,271 --> 02:05:31,470
how do I put myself in this person's
shoes and imagine what it feels like to

2040
02:05:31,471 --> 02:05:36,380
have this whole like Rodeo show up. You
know, it's like a circus and so, and what,

2041
02:05:36,590 --> 02:05:40,050
what, what is that making you
feel like? And when, you know,

2042
02:05:40,051 --> 02:05:42,090
when it's not explained to these guys,

2043
02:05:42,450 --> 02:05:45,210
oh we're going to have to
do everything 17 times,

2044
02:05:45,211 --> 02:05:47,370
but it's not because you did it wrong,
you know?

2045
02:05:47,371 --> 02:05:49,980
So the things that I learned along
the way, I would say to everyone like,

2046
02:05:50,340 --> 02:05:52,260
don't worry,
like we have to do it a lot of times,

2047
02:05:52,350 --> 02:05:54,690
but it has nothing to do with
you. You're perfect, you're fine.

2048
02:05:54,720 --> 02:05:56,700
Or just look at me like
don't look at them.

2049
02:05:56,701 --> 02:06:00,270
Or there's a lot of sort of talking in
the background that you have to tune out.

2050
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:02,040
And a lot of the time
they're calling your name.

2051
02:06:02,041 --> 02:06:05,100
Cause if they're talking to each other
about focusing the camera on you.

2052
02:06:05,250 --> 02:06:08,610
So I had to be like, just ignore
if you, if you hear your name,

2053
02:06:08,611 --> 02:06:10,050
they're not talking to you,
you know,

2054
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:13,910
cause you're natural human responses
to turn to whoever is talking about,

2055
02:06:13,960 --> 02:06:14,820
you know,
saying your name.

2056
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:19,080
So there are these like little things
that I learned that made it easier for me.

2057
02:06:19,081 --> 02:06:19,770
And then I,

2058
02:06:19,770 --> 02:06:24,330
I took a great pleasure in being the
guide for whoever we were sort of because

2059
02:06:24,331 --> 02:06:26,800
it's my job to put that person that cooks,

2060
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:31,740
that grandma I'm cooking with at ease
so that she can be her best self and we

2061
02:06:31,741 --> 02:06:36,120
can get the best footage from
her and it's, I don't know,

2062
02:06:36,121 --> 02:06:39,000
it's that maternal thing or whatever.
It's that teacher thing. And um,

2063
02:06:39,180 --> 02:06:43,470
I realized that I was really good
at that. And so I, I I, yeah.

2064
02:06:43,471 --> 02:06:46,260
And it was just nice to
have an entirely new field,

2065
02:06:46,261 --> 02:06:50,340
an entirely new skill to hone in terms
of just like, what is it to be on camera,

2066
02:06:50,341 --> 02:06:55,320
what is it to like work
with these different people.
That part was really fun.

2067
02:06:55,350 --> 02:06:56,370
I really,
really enjoyed it.

2068
02:06:56,980 --> 02:07:00,460
Really excited for you. And I'm also
really excited for everybody to see this.

2069
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:04,540
I'm excited. Uh, can you
just, just to look at the,

2070
02:07:04,660 --> 02:07:09,010
the overall structure of the,
of the show,

2071
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:10,930
how many episodes are there total?

2072
02:07:11,430 --> 02:07:16,020
There's four episodes and each one's
about like 50 ish minutes long.

2073
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:20,640
And um, it, it sort of
matches the structure of the
book. So there's salt, fat,

2074
02:07:20,670 --> 02:07:21,690
acid and heat.

2075
02:07:22,050 --> 02:07:26,790
And in each episode we go to a different
country to sort of explore the nuances

2076
02:07:26,791 --> 02:07:27,660
of that element.

2077
02:07:27,930 --> 02:07:32,930
But then through voiceover
and storytelling and a
beautiful archival imagery,

2078
02:07:34,930 --> 02:07:39,820
like really our, our team who was digging
up the archival did such a good job. Um,

2079
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:44,350
we're able to connect everything back
to some sort of a universal message of,

2080
02:07:44,530 --> 02:07:47,590
you know, like I couldn't, we went
to Japan for salt, but honestly,

2081
02:07:47,591 --> 02:07:51,040
we could have gone to any country
for salt. We went to Italy for fat.

2082
02:07:51,041 --> 02:07:52,420
We could have gone anywhere for fat.

2083
02:07:52,450 --> 02:07:55,690
So it's this way where
like through the specific,

2084
02:07:55,691 --> 02:08:00,110
I find a way to then connect it
to the universal. And I do, I, I,

2085
02:08:00,190 --> 02:08:04,570
my hope for the show and what I think
from like early small feedbacks that I'm

2086
02:08:04,571 --> 02:08:09,310
receiving is that what I wanted it to
do was to give you a few little nuggets

2087
02:08:09,311 --> 02:08:13,540
that you could like put in your pocket.
And like same as the book,

2088
02:08:13,690 --> 02:08:16,510
never have to return to the book,
never have to return to the show,

2089
02:08:16,511 --> 02:08:18,610
never have to like refer to me again.

2090
02:08:18,910 --> 02:08:22,540
And that these are going to be the little
things that change the way that you

2091
02:08:22,541 --> 02:08:22,960
cook.

2092
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:27,960
And so from what I've heard is that
people are doing it like they're doing the

2093
02:08:28,211 --> 02:08:33,090
stuff I told them. Do you know?
And so if, if, um, you know,

2094
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:35,620
I think especially where like
where Netflix is concerned,

2095
02:08:35,621 --> 02:08:38,560
there's so much beautiful like
food documentary and food,

2096
02:08:38,561 --> 02:08:40,750
this and even like food
competitions on there.

2097
02:08:40,990 --> 02:08:45,310
But I think this is the first show that
is really sort of aimed to like get you

2098
02:08:45,311 --> 02:08:46,380
cooking.
You know,

2099
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:51,980
I'm so excited. Yeah. I need
a reboot. I've been, I have,
I mean, I do enjoy cooking.

2100
02:08:52,610 --> 02:08:55,190
Uh, but this, this I think is,

2101
02:08:55,460 --> 02:08:57,890
is such a fun,

2102
02:08:58,190 --> 02:09:02,540
culturally rich way to do it.
Uh, so I want, let me ask you,

2103
02:09:03,110 --> 02:09:04,550
as people are listening
to this and they're,

2104
02:09:04,610 --> 02:09:09,320
and they're getting excited to not only
see these various locations and cultures

2105
02:09:09,321 --> 02:09:14,321
and learn from you as you're
pulling them into these stories,

2106
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:18,440
salt, fat, acid, heat.
So I read somewhere,

2107
02:09:18,530 --> 02:09:22,310
I think it was on the kitchen.com that uh,

2108
02:09:22,510 --> 02:09:24,830
as one of your indulgences
and maybe you've changed,

2109
02:09:24,831 --> 02:09:28,460
you can feel free to change
is a local olive oil,

2110
02:09:28,461 --> 02:09:32,060
meaning local to you over on
the west coast from cats winery.

2111
02:09:32,061 --> 02:09:33,170
And then there are a few other things.

2112
02:09:33,410 --> 02:09:38,360
Could you recommend as people who
want to just grab a few tools?

2113
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:42,080
Oh yeah. Uh, you know,
there's no budget limit,

2114
02:09:42,081 --> 02:09:45,520
but we're not going to be buying a,
you know, the latest and greatest, uh,

2115
02:09:45,650 --> 02:09:49,370
super expensive, you know,
immersion circulator or
something. But like something,

2116
02:09:49,580 --> 02:09:53,150
are there a handful of things?
Maybe they overlap like a nice salt,

2117
02:09:53,210 --> 02:09:55,010
like some type of fat acid,
big.

2118
02:09:55,090 --> 02:10:00,090
Anything that you can think of that most
home cooks may have neglected her or,

2119
02:10:00,381 --> 02:10:05,381
or not incorporated that people can
just run out and grab and preparation.

2120
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:11,780
Yes. Okay. Oh, this is exciting.
Okay. For Salt, I think, um,

2121
02:10:11,900 --> 02:10:13,070
that Maldon salt,

2122
02:10:13,071 --> 02:10:16,550
which is the British salt is the little
pyramid flakes that comes in a little

2123
02:10:16,551 --> 02:10:20,750
white box. Yeah. That is now more
readily available in grocery stores,

2124
02:10:20,751 --> 02:10:25,400
but also you can buy it on Amazon. And I
feel like that not only tastes amazing,

2125
02:10:25,401 --> 02:10:27,520
but it has this incredible
texture that you,

2126
02:10:27,590 --> 02:10:31,610
you just putting a little bit on top of
cookies or even ice cream is amazing.

2127
02:10:31,611 --> 02:10:34,790
But also any salad, tomato
toast, I don't know.

2128
02:10:34,791 --> 02:10:38,810
I have a huge jar of it
that I just reached into all
the time at home. So good.

2129
02:10:39,500 --> 02:10:40,191
It's so good.

2130
02:10:40,191 --> 02:10:45,050
I think one thing that I learned about
on the show that sort of blew my mind is,

2131
02:10:45,090 --> 02:10:47,170
um,
that I really hope will,

2132
02:10:47,200 --> 02:10:52,200
will catch on after the show is
how different and how far superior,

2133
02:10:54,050 --> 02:10:56,120
uh,
good soy sauce is too regular.

2134
02:10:56,120 --> 02:11:00,020
So I saw us like the regular
everyday sorta Kiko man. And um,

2135
02:11:00,080 --> 02:11:01,040
and the way you know,

2136
02:11:01,041 --> 02:11:05,330
it's a good one is that it's been aged
in a wooden barrel versus a stainless

2137
02:11:05,331 --> 02:11:07,250
steel tank.
So often it'll say like wooden,

2138
02:11:07,310 --> 02:11:10,760
wooden barrel age or barrel aged
on the thing. There's a brand,

2139
02:11:10,761 --> 02:11:14,720
probably the brand that's the easiest
to come by in the states is called Nama

2140
02:11:14,721 --> 02:11:18,800
show you. And again, you
can buy that on Amazon.

2141
02:11:19,130 --> 02:11:23,000
And so, um, but it's also like,
probably in like higher end stores.

2142
02:11:23,001 --> 02:11:25,250
I've also seen it at whole
foods and it's a little bit,

2143
02:11:25,251 --> 02:11:29,420
it's like $9 versus two 50, you
know, but it's one of those things,

2144
02:11:29,510 --> 02:11:34,510
the flavor is so much richer and so much
deeper and like bounces off all of the

2145
02:11:35,011 --> 02:11:38,990
sort of, um, like angles of
your mouth. It's amazing.

2146
02:11:39,020 --> 02:11:43,130
It's so incredible. And so I would
say that soy sauce is really special.

2147
02:11:43,460 --> 02:11:46,730
Um, olive oil wise.
Yeah, I would say cats.

2148
02:11:46,731 --> 02:11:49,580
Olive oil is really delicious.
Um,

2149
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:53,330
and also there's another one that's
local to here to us in California called

2150
02:11:53,331 --> 02:11:56,840
Seiko Hills, which is made on
an Indian reservation. It's so,

2151
02:11:56,841 --> 02:12:01,841
it's like amazing Scca like dry Eka Eka.

2152
02:12:02,750 --> 02:12:03,110
Yeah.

2153
02:12:03,110 --> 02:12:07,580
And those two are some two of the like
nicest California olive oils and Seiko

2154
02:12:07,580 --> 02:12:09,800
Hills is actually I think
relatively expensive,

2155
02:12:09,890 --> 02:12:12,300
inexpensive and you can
buy it in bigger things.

2156
02:12:12,301 --> 02:12:16,790
So that's kind of my everyday
olive oil now. Um, um,

2157
02:12:16,850 --> 02:12:21,560
and then acid wise, I mean
I a lime, it's my favorite,

2158
02:12:21,561 --> 02:12:26,450
but if you're going to buy again
vinegar wise, I think I'm a nice rice.

2159
02:12:26,451 --> 02:12:27,890
Vinegar is really delicious.

2160
02:12:27,910 --> 02:12:32,240
Like I'm just discovering
how much more delicious,

2161
02:12:33,230 --> 02:12:35,060
you know,
I tried in my recipe testing,

2162
02:12:35,061 --> 02:12:38,150
I try to cook with the everyday stuff
that you can buy at any grocery store so

2163
02:12:38,151 --> 02:12:38,450
that it,

2164
02:12:38,450 --> 02:12:41,960
my recipes are pretty accurate to like
what anybody is going to make anywhere in

2165
02:12:41,961 --> 02:12:46,040
the country instead of rent,
like very specific niche ingredients.

2166
02:12:46,400 --> 02:12:48,860
But sometimes, you know, when
I'm making my own dinner at home,

2167
02:12:48,861 --> 02:12:53,690
I just want to have like the delicious
rice vinegar. So that same brand nom nom,

2168
02:12:53,691 --> 02:12:54,524
a shot show you,

2169
02:12:54,550 --> 02:12:59,210
they make a really delicious rice
vinegar that's just so fantastic.

2170
02:13:00,110 --> 02:13:04,400
And there. Yeah, so that's a really good
one. And then he is really, oh here,

2171
02:13:04,430 --> 02:13:09,050
this is a luxury. This is a little bit
expensive, but it's the most amazing,

2172
02:13:09,110 --> 02:13:12,620
the most amazing,
the most stuff.

2173
02:13:13,700 --> 02:13:17,690
So I would say like, you always want to
have a great pan. And so for me, I'm,

2174
02:13:17,691 --> 02:13:20,420
I'm generally,
I often say just have a cast iron pan.

2175
02:13:20,421 --> 02:13:22,820
It's the most used pen in
my house as a cast iron.

2176
02:13:22,821 --> 02:13:26,460
I bought at a flea market
for like 25 bucks. But um,

2177
02:13:26,510 --> 02:13:30,950
if you want to graduate up from a
cast iron, there is a company in,

2178
02:13:31,050 --> 02:13:35,790
I believe they're in Virginia. It's
called a blank creatives, B, l, a.

2179
02:13:35,791 --> 02:13:36,624
N.
C.

2180
02:13:36,930 --> 02:13:41,430
They make these beautiful
hand forged pans that are um,

2181
02:13:41,910 --> 02:13:45,300
they're steel. There's some sort
of a cast steel. They're like,

2182
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:49,230
have this beautiful bluish tint and they,

2183
02:13:49,320 --> 02:13:51,540
this pan is unbelievable.

2184
02:13:51,541 --> 02:13:54,720
My best friend gave me one
for a gift a few years ago.

2185
02:13:54,990 --> 02:13:59,130
And for whatever reason I didn't start
using it really regularly until recently.

2186
02:13:59,910 --> 02:14:04,770
It blows my mind how good it is because
it browns just like a cast iron pan and,

2187
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:06,840
but it heats up.
It's much lighter,

2188
02:14:06,841 --> 02:14:11,790
it heats up a lot more quickly and um,
and it just,

2189
02:14:11,791 --> 02:14:14,640
it retains its heat.
They're just a delight to use.

2190
02:14:14,641 --> 02:14:18,060
These pans are a delight to use. I have
no, I don't know how else to say it. Like,

2191
02:14:18,410 --> 02:14:21,090
and it just, everything that
comes out of it is so good.

2192
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:25,770
Do you cook everything or can
you cook, for instance, if,

2193
02:14:25,910 --> 02:14:28,290
would you cook eggs in this
or would you have said yes

2194
02:14:29,510 --> 02:14:31,310
and your eggs wouldn't stick?
Nothing would like,

2195
02:14:31,460 --> 02:14:35,420
because it's definitely has a seasoning
that you have to um, keep up, you know,

2196
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:38,390
and it will rust. It will rest
even a little bit more easily.

2197
02:14:38,391 --> 02:14:41,180
Like sometimes if I don't dry mine
really well out in the morning,

2198
02:14:41,190 --> 02:14:43,250
they'll be a little rust forming,
so I have to wipe it away.

2199
02:14:43,670 --> 02:14:47,840
But it's that seasoning that makes it
so beautiful and perfectly nonstick.

2200
02:14:47,870 --> 02:14:52,870
They're also just very gorgeous and look
like a beautiful handmade object and

2201
02:14:53,500 --> 02:14:57,900
they're, you know, I think they're in
the $200 range, but like a pen, I dunno,

2202
02:14:57,980 --> 02:15:01,220
people buy the liquor is a pots for 300
bucks and they use him for 30 years.

2203
02:15:01,221 --> 02:15:06,060
So I feel, I feel okay giving a
one expensive pen recommendation

2204
02:15:07,230 --> 02:15:09,680
by seasoning.
Are you say like heating it up,

2205
02:15:09,681 --> 02:15:13,430
putting salt in it and
like kind of scratching the
surface or is it really just

2206
02:15:13,431 --> 02:15:15,710
letting it absorb the
various oils and so on?

2207
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,620
Yeah,
it's just the fact that it like I,

2208
02:15:19,720 --> 02:15:22,910
I'm not so good with the science of
metal and then these pans and stuff,

2209
02:15:22,911 --> 02:15:27,170
but I think what happens is as you cook
or if you intentionally like rub it with

2210
02:15:27,171 --> 02:15:30,050
some fat and then put it in
the oven and let it get warm,

2211
02:15:30,110 --> 02:15:34,010
the fats turn into Paul.
It's called I think polymerization.

2212
02:15:34,340 --> 02:15:37,820
And so the sort of almost
like fill in the little,

2213
02:15:37,821 --> 02:15:40,310
any holes that might be in the metal,

2214
02:15:40,311 --> 02:15:44,240
like invisible minute tolls and
then create a really smooth surface.

2215
02:15:44,270 --> 02:15:47,450
And so that smooth,
the smoother that surface is,

2216
02:15:47,451 --> 02:15:50,150
the more non stick the thing
will be. Which is why, you know,

2217
02:15:50,151 --> 02:15:52,670
when you buy a cast iron
that's not yet seasoned,

2218
02:15:52,700 --> 02:15:54,500
if you even touch it with your fingers,

2219
02:15:54,501 --> 02:15:57,740
you can feel that it's a little
bit pebbly in there, you know,

2220
02:15:57,741 --> 02:16:01,310
and that Pebble Enos
is where things stick.

2221
02:16:01,340 --> 02:16:05,420
Is it like that Pebble Enos
is stick sticking stuff and
tough lawn exists at the

2222
02:16:05,421 --> 02:16:09,200
complete other end of the range where
there's, it's like almost entirely smooth.

2223
02:16:09,470 --> 02:16:12,860
So the smoother the thing is,
the less sticking you'll have

2224
02:16:14,580 --> 02:16:16,010
here here.
Uh,

2225
02:16:16,580 --> 02:16:20,670
well I mean I think that this is,

2226
02:16:21,350 --> 02:16:24,230
I think this is an exciting
place to probably tie up.

2227
02:16:24,231 --> 02:16:28,610
I encourage everybody to check out
the book and the show. Of course.

2228
02:16:29,050 --> 02:16:29,650
Uh,

2229
02:16:29,650 --> 02:16:34,650
they can find you on the interwebs and
it's Instagram and Twitter at Chow Samine

2230
02:16:35,830 --> 02:16:40,210
or seminar. So I'm now,
now I'm working on,

2231
02:16:40,480 --> 02:16:43,760
I'll just say something to keep it easy,
but at Chelsea and C,

2232
02:16:43,761 --> 02:16:47,200
I a o Semyon on Instagram,
Twitter on Facebook,

2233
02:16:47,530 --> 02:16:50,680
forward slash so mean dot.
No route.

2234
02:16:50,950 --> 02:16:53,200
And then a salt fat acid,

2235
02:16:53,201 --> 02:16:57,310
heat.com is where they can
find information about, uh,

2236
02:16:57,530 --> 02:16:59,790
the TV show as well on
that, uh, at the euro

2237
02:17:01,780 --> 02:17:03,850
and all the wonderful people.

2238
02:17:03,851 --> 02:17:07,810
I'm like writing profiles
of all the people that we
got to meet so you can learn

2239
02:17:07,811 --> 02:17:12,811
more about the people from the
show when the website launches.

2240
02:17:12,881 --> 02:17:17,470
Yeah. And I will also link to
everything we've talked about in the,

2241
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:19,690
in the show notes as per usual for folks.

2242
02:17:19,690 --> 02:17:23,500
So people listening can go
to tim.blog/podcast for the
links to everything we've

2243
02:17:23,501 --> 02:17:27,220
discussed, including the show
at the products, the books,

2244
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:30,650
everything that has come up with a
email to Michael Pollan. That's right.

2245
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:32,410
And if you can find it,
the actual,

2246
02:17:32,411 --> 02:17:36,820
the actual wordsmithing that you use
with Michael Paul and I would love to see

2247
02:17:36,821 --> 02:17:38,800
that. So I'll put that in the
show notes if we can find it.

2248
02:17:39,370 --> 02:17:44,370
Is there anything else that you would
like to say or ask of people listening or

2249
02:17:45,281 --> 02:17:49,270
suggest to people listening, uh,
before we, before we wrap up?

2250
02:17:50,710 --> 02:17:52,600
Gosh, no, happy cooking.

2251
02:17:55,670 --> 02:17:57,460
Use where? Salt. Don't forget the lime,

2252
02:17:57,910 --> 02:18:02,050
all your feelings and don't forget
your feelings. Uh, well what,

2253
02:18:02,051 --> 02:18:06,470
what a gift to spend time with you.
Thank you so much and so much.

2254
02:18:06,520 --> 02:18:11,520
This was so like emotionally resonant
and fun and just really beautiful.

2255
02:18:12,161 --> 02:18:16,360
So thank you. Oh my pleasure.
Entirely. Uh, this, this is maybe,

2256
02:18:16,361 --> 02:18:19,560
maybe my therapy is doing this podcast.
Maybe that's why we're

2257
02:18:21,370 --> 02:18:25,210
here. That's my version of
therapy. Uh, well once again,

2258
02:18:25,240 --> 02:18:29,080
really appreciate you taking
the time today. Uh, the, the,
the show looks beautiful.

2259
02:18:29,081 --> 02:18:33,970
I really hope people check it out and uh,
to be continued.

2260
02:18:34,060 --> 02:18:35,500
I hope we have many more conversations

2261
02:18:37,060 --> 02:18:40,900
and to everybody listening as always.

2262
02:18:40,950 --> 02:18:43,720
And until next time,
thanks for tuning in.

2263
02:18:45,780 --> 02:18:49,170
Hey guys, this is Tim again. Just a
few more things before you take off.

2264
02:18:49,500 --> 02:18:52,140
Number one,
this is five bullet Friday.

2265
02:18:52,470 --> 02:18:55,400
Do you want to get a short email from me?

2266
02:18:55,450 --> 02:18:58,050
Would you enjoy getting a short
email from me every Friday?

2267
02:18:58,350 --> 02:19:02,580
That provides a little more soul of
fun before the weekend and five bullet

2268
02:19:02,581 --> 02:19:07,200
Friday is a very short email where I
share the coolest things I found or that

2269
02:19:07,201 --> 02:19:08,760
I've been pondering over the week.

2270
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,790
That could include favorite new
albums that I've discovered.

2271
02:19:11,791 --> 02:19:15,240
It could include Gizmos and gadgets
and all sorts of weird shit that I've

2272
02:19:15,241 --> 02:19:19,530
somehow dug up in the uh,
the world of the esoteric as I do.

2273
02:19:19,830 --> 02:19:24,830
It could include favorite articles that
I've read and that I've shared with my

2274
02:19:25,471 --> 02:19:28,190
close friends for instance.
And it's very short.

2275
02:19:28,310 --> 02:19:33,260
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness
before you head off for the weekend.

2276
02:19:33,320 --> 02:19:35,510
So if you want to receive that,
check it out.

2277
02:19:35,780 --> 02:19:40,430
Just go to four hour work week.com that's

2278
02:19:40,431 --> 02:19:43,610

2279

And if you sign up,
I hope you enjoy it.

2280
02:19:46,940 --> 02:19:49,130
This episode is brought
to you by freshbooks.

2281
02:19:49,190 --> 02:19:52,970
Freshbooks is become the goto cloud
accounting software for literally millions

2282
02:19:52,971 --> 02:19:55,220
of small business owners
who found a faster,

2283
02:19:55,221 --> 02:19:58,430
more efficient and much less stressful
way to deal with their numbers and

2284
02:19:58,431 --> 02:20:02,240
ultimately this helps you to
focus on what you are best at.

2285
02:20:02,780 --> 02:20:06,110
It is used by many of the fastest growing
startups I've invested in or advise

2286
02:20:06,111 --> 02:20:10,010
and it's equally used by many of the best
freelancers I work with on a daily or

2287
02:20:10,011 --> 02:20:13,760
weekly basis. It is one of the
easiest ways to send invoices,

2288
02:20:13,761 --> 02:20:17,930
get paid to track your time and track
your clients if you're self employed and

2289
02:20:17,931 --> 02:20:21,110
managing business sometimes means
wrestling with spreadsheets,

2290
02:20:21,111 --> 02:20:24,980
crumbled receipts and other scattered
pieces. Freshbooks can really help.

2291
02:20:25,670 --> 02:20:28,310
Freshbooks allows you to do many,
many different things very easily.

2292
02:20:28,340 --> 02:20:32,030
Preparing and sending a polished branded
invoice. It takes about 30 seconds.

2293
02:20:32,360 --> 02:20:35,450
You can set yourself up to receive online
payments from your clients in about

2294
02:20:35,451 --> 02:20:36,140
two clicks,

2295
02:20:36,140 --> 02:20:39,830
which on average we'll get you paid
twice as fast they're new proposals.

2296
02:20:39,831 --> 02:20:43,040
Feature means you can include a project
summary and timeline is part of your

2297
02:20:43,041 --> 02:20:45,890
estimate. There are many, many
other things. Tracking your time.

2298
02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:49,460
The quick proposals that I mentioned,
formatting free, super easy,

2299
02:20:49,490 --> 02:20:53,180
late payment reminders so you don't have
to chase people. Automatic expenses,

2300
02:20:53,210 --> 02:20:57,170
sharing files and messages with your
client's award winning customer service.

2301
02:20:57,530 --> 02:21:00,020
They are extremely responsive.

2302
02:21:00,170 --> 02:21:03,950
The interface is super intuitive and
there's almost no learning curve,

2303
02:21:04,370 --> 02:21:07,220
so in short it's easy.

2311
02:21:35,541 --> 02:21:37,700
If you could only use one supplement,
what would it be?

2312
02:21:38,030 --> 02:21:40,640
My answer is inevitably athletic Greens.

2313
02:21:40,641 --> 02:21:43,130
It is your all in one
nutritional insurance.

2314
02:21:43,131 --> 02:21:44,810
I recommended it in the four hour body,

2315
02:21:44,900 --> 02:21:48,830
did not get paid for that and I
travel with it to avoid getting sick.

2316
02:21:49,100 --> 02:21:51,860
I take it in the mornings to
ensure optimal performance.

2317
02:21:52,130 --> 02:21:53,360
It just covers all my basis.

2318
02:21:53,390 --> 02:21:57,380
If I can't get what I need through whole
food meals throughout the rest of the

2319
02:21:57,380 --> 02:21:59,390
day. If you want to give
