25
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,660
Hello Ladies and germs.

26
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:51,160
This is Tim Ferriss and welcome to a
very special episode of the Tim Ferriss

27
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,160
Show where each episode I attempt to
deconstruct world class performers to find

28
00:01:57,071 --> 00:01:58,180
what makes them tick,

29
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,740
the tools and tricks that you can
use in your daily life ranging from

30
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,850
professional athletes to chess prodigies
to billionaire investors to in this

31
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:11,680
episode. That's right, Arnold
Swartz and Negar the man himself,

32
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,330
the governor later the terminator,

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,750
the man who killed the
God Damn Predator people.

34
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,020
This was an amazing experience for me.

35
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,770
Of course there are many things
that I associate with my upbringing,

36
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,650
if you want to call it that
in the 80s guns and roses,

37
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:29,610
but of course there's commando, there's
Predator. The list goes on and on.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,210
This man is a force of nature
and I had the opportunity,

39
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:37,830
the rare opportunity to visit him at
his home in southern California at the

40
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:38,700
kitchen table.

41
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,940
We dug into everything and I really
wanted to dig into areas that had not been

42
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:50,211
explored widely in any other interviews
that I could find and that ranges from

43
00:02:50,911 --> 00:02:55,080
the art of psychological warfare. He
is a master. How did he apply that?

44
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:59,010
What phrases to use questions that he
used to get inside the heads of his,

45
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,330
we cover that. What was his most
lucrative movie? I'll give you a hint.

46
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,990
Twins. How the hell did that happen? Well,

47
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,930
there's a lot that goes
into the backstory of that.

48
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,940
How did he make millions of dollars fresh
off the boat before his acting career

49
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:16,451
took off?

50
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:19,450
A lot of people don't realize he was a
millionaire before his acting career took

51
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:21,910
off. How did that happen? We dig into it.

52
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,500
How did Arnold use meditation for one
year and just one year to completely reset

53
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:31,880
his brain and prime the
stage for massive success.

54
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,210
And of course mailing
cow balls to politicians,

55
00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:38,300
but that's just the tip of the iceberg.
This was an amazing episode.

56
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,750
I want to let you get right
into it. The show notes, links,

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,520
please enjoy a wild romp through
the life of Arnold Schwartzenegger

62
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,410
kind. Sir, I want it to start with a
thank you for welcoming me to your house,

63
00:04:09,411 --> 00:04:10,700
number one.
But number two,

64
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,620
I felt awkward all morning because I
don't know how I should address you and I

65
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:17,390
wanted to ask you how
I should address you.

66
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,510
Well, are you going to visit me in any
way you want? You can call me governor,

67
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:26,650
the governor Schnitzel.
I'm old,

68
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,140
but I think would be right.

69
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,730
Go with Arnold. It's, it's, I felt like
my first year in Japan when I was 15,

70
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:39,110
cause I didn't know how to
address anybody. Uh, so I
figured we could start with

71
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,720
a favorite topic.
Well,

72
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:43,790
it's become a favorite topic is
I've been thinking about this,

73
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:48,791
which is big balls and cow
balls and bull testicles.

74
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,130
So you've mailed,
uh,

75
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,720
sculptures of bull testicles to
people before. Is that right?

76
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,440
Well, there was one incident, uh, and uh,

77
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,610
but the color,
this was when I was governor

78
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,570
and there was a, you
know, one of the leaders,

79
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,800
legislative leaders, John
Steinberg, uh, and I,

80
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:19,770
we both had the huge challenge. Uh,
California was hit then and norm was,

81
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,930
uh, you know, economic decline.

82
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,980
There was a worldwide recession
that was hitting us in 2008,

83
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,360
and everyone kind of was caught by
surprise of what effect that had, did.

84
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:34,840
All of a sudden we had $20
billion less in revenues,

85
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,140
therefore we had to make big cuts in
education and in various different areas

86
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:44,320
that really hit the vulnerable
citizens, um, of Cody fornia.

87
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,630
And so when we did the budget,

88
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:52,140
I basically sent him up before we
negotiated in know a set of balls and,

89
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:56,800
uh, and uh, you know, kind
of just be the note that say,

90
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:59,890
I hope you have that when
we negotiate the budget.
